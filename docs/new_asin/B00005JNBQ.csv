1541066,5,B00005JNBQ,"When I first saw this movie advertised I was like, what the hell is that? Then my friend made me go see it with him and from the first second all the way through I was hysterical. YOu can't get enough of how unbelievably hilarious this guys' personality is. The tater tots was the best part in my opinion. If you are open minded and want to see a brand new kind of humorm or at least to me, then definitley check this one out you will love it.",1096588800,2,443,3.9887640449438204
1541067,5,B00005JNBQ,I laughed even harder the second time I saw this movie. An instant cult classic.,1096329600,,80,4.4
1541068,5,B00005JNBQ,"This has got to be one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I was laughing the entire time.

If you have not seen this movie (limited theater release initially) you definitely should buy this DVD!!!",1096243200,2,199,4.351351351351352
1541069,5,B00005JNBQ,"One of the earlier reviewers did an excellent job of critiquing the frequently clueless Roger Ebert for his complete misunderstanding of this character and this movie.  Napoleon is a rural supernerd who doesn't want or need the acceptance of those around him.  He doesn't long to be popular, he doesn't really care what people think of him, he just wants the space to be himself.

What's great about the character is that Naploen doesn't really change at all through the course of the movie.  Sure, he helps a friend win a student election and manages to find a girl; but these are the result of Napoleon being who he is, not because he changed or grew into something else.  He starts the movie as an almost monotonal, oblivious, strangely dressed little boy - and that's exactly how he is at the end of the movie.  He doesn't even seem to realize it, but he's changed a lot of the people around him.  Pedro gets some self confidence, Deb finds a guy who accepts her, Kip is happy, and even uncle Rico manages to stumble into a good deal.

Not that I care one way or the other, but the movie manages to be enormously entertaining without resorting to potty humor or wholesale swearing even once.  An impressive feat considering the status quo of ""comedies"" these days.

My only gripe would be with the ""extra"" scene that was added in after the credits when the movie started earning some bucks.  It really just seems tacked on and kind of pointless.  I would have rather seen a few more minutes at the chicken farm, or some time spent showing how Rico met his girlfriend, or even some more of Napoleon as the biggest kid on the school bus. The tetherball game was the perfect ending for this movie, and nothing was gained by the addition of the new post-credits scene.

If you want something to compare it to, it carries a lot of the same pleasantly deluded loser vibe that ""Bottle Rocket"" had, along with a similarly great soundtrack.  It's a great date movie, and a superior original low-budget comedy.

Now if I can only get my hands on a D-Qwon's Dance-grooves VHS, I'll be OK.",1096243200,10,2081,4.526737967914438
1541592,3,B00005JNBQ,Napoleon Dynamite was a transcendent movie. It moved me. It truly inspired me to be myself in the school setting and to show off my splendid dance moves. I wish I could attach a video to this review because my dance moves are superb. Napoleon Dynamite's dance moves are a motif and imagery for high school. #,1524441600,,308,4.421052631578948
1541593,5,B00005JNBQ,"Naturally, as the most iconic movie of the century, Napoleon Dynamite far outranks any other movie in international history.  In fact, that is a huge understatement, this film is the best work of art that has ever been seen by living species in the entire galaxy, let alone the universe. To be fair, you have to have a pretty high IQ to understand the complex elements of humor that are present in this work of visual narrative art -- the bare naked eye cannot truly comprehend the depth of its infinite beauty.",1524441600,,511,4.554347826086956
1541594,3,B00005JNBQ,This movie is so incredibly cringey but that's what makes it funny. The plot itself isn't too interesting but it's the characters and the way they act is really funny. It's shot well and the design is great for the time.,1524441600,,220,4.390243902439025
1541595,5,B00005JNBQ,"A low budget film that exceeds expectations. Attention to detail, production quality, and creative cinematography make up for a film that lacks narrative purpose. However, it is made clear that this is exactly the point, so this does not subtract from the film. The point is to relax and enjoy the quirky characters, their stories, and the elements used by the film makers to portray these aspects beautifully.",1524441600,,410,5.044117647058823

1541730,5,B00005JNBQ,"I try to get my son to watch quality movies all the time and he won't. One night, I said, ""Do you want to watch Napoleon Dynamite?"" without even looking up from youtube, he said ""No, you made me watch Bill and Ted's and I hated it."" There is no accounting for taste in most instances. But, I started the film, he heard it playing (which was amazing as he never hears ""Take out the garbage"" even when he isn't watching youtube and is looking directly at me), and came out to join me. He loved it. My payback for this moment of bonding was to have the lines repeated back to me for weeks on the way to school, the way home from school, at dinner, through the bathroom door, and get responses in the Napoleon style whenever I asked him to do anything.

All words from the movie, and all describe the movie.  I saw this at the theater in the initial run in 2004, and I watch it every couple of years.  Somehow it gets funnier, and both my wife and I quote it on a daily basis.  I think in some ways we all can identify with Napoleon.  Awkward, stupid, loveable, and human.

1542170,3,B00005JNBQ,"Starts off boring, but then the jokes start pouring in.
It's a Funny Movie.

The only reason I didn't give it 4-stars was because some of the plot choices were kind of lame.
It didn't have a great ending, and there was a lot of time wasted on his Uncle that didn't really amount to much more than awkwardness.

I just realized that his girl forgave him for no reason, at the end. (LoL)
Total misunderstanding, and she got insulted, but then it was like she utterly forgot about it.

Kip's girlfriend was a bit of a silly choice, as well.
It could've been a lot funnier when they finally met, but they tried too hard, I think.

Once she came into the picture, it was like Kip left the movie, which was a bummer, because he was one of the funnier characters.
This could have legitimately turned into a larger series.

If it were made, nowadays, it'd be filled with hipster-indie-rock-emo-kids, and their struggles.
Also, I thought it was interesting how there was a range of periods involved.

It was, like, farm-boy desolate west Texas kind of area, but then his Uncle looked like he was dressed for the 70's, and the soundtrack was totally 80's, yet, I think it was based in the early 90's. (I'm not really sure)
That was pretty entertaining.

There are a lot of funny moments in this movie.
I saw this in theaters when it first came out, and everybody was ranting and raving about it at the time.

Re-watching it, I half expected to be somewhat disappointed, but there are quite a few moments that are really funny, and the comedic timing really brings it all together.
It doesn't have much replay value, but after not seeing it for a while, it's worth re-visiting.

P.S.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone actually play Tether-Ball. (LoL)",1513900800,,1741,4.519108280254777

1542498,3,B00005JNBQ,"Some of the scenes are really cute and memorable. The dance scene from Napoleon Dynamite is one of the best dance productions ever caught on video, for better or worse there is some real raw, funk dancing that is quite soulful, regardless of whether he is a nerdy white boy in the movie or not. It should serve as an example that you can get down, no matter your race, color, or creed. That said, there are parts of the movie that are a bit dark or violent, not explicitly, but just kind of a downer with a bully sort of vibe. It's part of the movie, but I think it brings it down quite a bit. Rico is a bit of an *** personality. He didn't eat meat, as an actor, but in the movie he chewed the steak. I heard he spit it out afterwards. Still pretty gross. I could do without him in the movie. Kip is absolutely outstanding, my favorite character. Napoleon is kind of a dick sometimes, a bit sour and salty. But overall not a bad guy. Kip and Lafonda, they are the real winners at the end of the movie, but it doesn't show much of them. Napoleon's grooves are the highlight, but this aspect isn't emphasize too much. He's just a geeky personality, a bit too losery for my taste, not very realistic, but at the sametime, it was the first real portrayal of this type of character that wasn't over the top in terms of Urkality, a la Steve Urkel or Screech. Less annoying than those too. So that was a plus.

I saw this way back when it was only playing in indie theatres. My girlfriend at the time brought me to it, and boy am I thankful to her that I was exposed to this nerdy *** movie. It was too much fun. Yep, too much. It got old. But it's still a positive reminder that movies can be done that are simple, cute, and not too expensive.",1506988800,,1738,4.126843657817109

It grows up in the Truman Show world and meets The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers. They get involved, fall in love, but much like Vince Vaughn's and Jennifer Aniston's characters in The Break Up, they break up.

I think Amazon charges too much for rentals so I give this a star reduction for that. The movie has a lot of funny one liners and is weird and at times you feel embarrassed for the characters but maybe that's why it's so funny. You can see a little of yourself and your own weirdness and laugh at it.

Be sure to watch past the credits for kips wedding. I never saw that scene when this movie first came out so it was something I got to see with the rental.",1481500800,,605,3.959016393442623

Throughout the following week, they were quoting the movie until my youngest son asked me, ""Dad, what was that movie about?"".  I laughed because I didn't know what to say.  I never thought about the meaning.  My kids and I have watched this movie at least 6 times this year.  We laugh harder each time now that we know what is going to happen.

If you're in your 40's and are looking for some nostalgic movies to watch with your kids, put this movie in your queue, along with The Goonies, Gremlins, Jaws, The Holy Grail, Joe Dirt, Time Bandits, Stand by Me, and the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.

1544756,5,B00005JNBQ,"I remember those days in high school when it was just as hard for others to understand you as it may have been for you to understand them.  I went to a somewhat big school so their were quite the mix of students, clubs, and unfortunately and inevitably clique's.  Their were the jocks, the nerds, the eccentric artistic types, pompous snobs,Goths, class clowns and pranksters, and even some foreign students.  No doubt one could always feel themself in a much better social status by belonging to a clique.  Sometimes you'll belong to either one that's not especially popular and/or has few members or just not be clique material at all.  Other than that some will feel that their worth doesn't need to be measured by a clique in the first place.  High school has it's many posers and real people.  I feel that this movie finds a fascinating way to make one think about all of those elements.

Also this movie does a good job of examining the poor and struggling versus the higher class and more well to do.  The exaggerations that this movie goes into with all of that are quite funny and relatable without being too mean-spirited.

As this movie is in no way plot heavy it does showcase some funny, interesting, and all around zany characters.  Also it's quite quotable as well.  In this movie you are introduced to Napoleon Dynamite.  A social outcast who's moody and deadpan, gets bullied at times, likes to make up stories, and has few friends.  Napoleon's brother Kip is a suck up, a dork, he's self-righteous, is only a little more tactful than Napoleon, and in general is an all around loser.  Uncle Rico who frequently relives his high school football hey days, he's a free-loader, an instigator, and while he and Kip get along just fine, Uncle Rico and Napoleon totally hate eachother.  Deb is a sweet girl who's just as socially awkward as Napoleon if not more, she was given the task to sell friendship bracelets door to door, she works at a local photo shop, and she has a deep connection with Napoleon.  Pedro is a lively and lovable Mexican teen of whom was sent  locally to Idaho, he and Napoleon become fast friends, Pedro wants a girlfriend, other than that Pedro shares in Napoleon's interests and wishes to win as school president to be respected and to stand out.  Grandma is the caretaker of Napoleon and Kip who loves to do dangerous and extreme things to the point of  getting wounded.  Summer Wheatly is gorgeous, hot, outgoing, highly popular, but unfortunately she's a big snob.  Those are the central characters to focus on.  The rest aren't as important.

Some Facts About The Film:  Director: Jared Hess, Producers: Jeremy Coon, Chris Wyatt, Sean C. Covel, and Jory Weitz.  Musical score by John Swihart.  Distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures for North America and Paramount Pictures internationally.  Budget: $400,000.  Box Office: 46.1 million dollars.  Cinematography: Munn Powell  Theatrical release: June 11, 2004.

The funniest scene of all will always be when Napoleon disco dances on stage to Cosmic Girl by Jamiroquai.  Certainly Napoleon and Uncle Rico locking horns is really hysterical.  Kip's ridiculous poser behaviors are very hilarious.  When the grandmother says,""Makes yourselves a freakin' Quesadilla"". is another good laugh.

The friendship between Napoleon and Pedro is a great reminder of what a worthwhile and loyal friendship in high school is like.  Deb may not be very pretty but she is that sweet girl that is the right kind of girl to want to have as a girlfriend.  Napoleon keeping his tater tots in his pocket certainly reminds me of any time that I didn't have time to eat all of my lunch so I would bring a ziploc bag and pack it for later.

All in all, as I don't normally find movies with clean humor to be funny nor do I normally care for a movie that's plot light and character heavy, I can't deny that with this movie's charm, zany and quirky characters, quotable lines like ""Sweet or ""Lu-cky"", it's hilarious exaggerations about clicques, class, and popularity, chief characters that are likable and only a couple that aren't, Jon Heder staying perfectly in character throughout the movie, great cinematography, and it's non mean-spirited nature, are all things that make this movie one that's worth giving a try.  Hopefully one day there will be a sequel.",1472515200,5,4327,4.802435723951286

1546220,3,B00005JNBQ,"Napolean Dynamite is a low budget indie movie that certainly has gained a huge fan base over the years and has a lot of hype.  At lot of people obviously love it but for me although there are a few funny moments and Napolean stepping up for his only friend on stage to allow him to remain in the race for school president was a cool visual scene, but overall when it was all over I can't say it's a movie I'll make any effort to watch again.  I'm not saying I'd leave the room if someone else put the DVD on but for me most iconic movies that have become part of popular culture, even if you own the DVD, if you turn on the TV and they happen to be on, for some reason you just keep watching, thinking I'll just wait until this scene, then I'll turn it off after this scene, and you end up watching the whole thing.  Napolean for me, doesn't have that appeal.

It's a movie with no real plot, rather you're just along for the ride of a couple of days in a guy who just doesn't fit ins world of home and school.  You could argue the getting Pedro his only friend elected school president and beating the popular girl who has that same goal is the plot, but it's not really.  In some ways it's different to the Hollywood/TV sitcom norm of high school days in an American school.  Most films would have made Summer Wheatley a villain, she would have been a nasty person, but in this one, the worst she really does is reject Pedro's offer with a note to take her to the prom, and I'd imagine a girl who looks like her probably had a date already anyway. But when you consider before handing the note to Napoleon she did ask where Pedro was, and Pedro pretty much did the same thing just with a cake instead of bit of paper, you can't really fault her for not communicating one on one.  Her friend who ditched Napoleon at the prom, perhaps was a villain but really she was being forced to take him and the two weren't friends anyway. I guess it's rare to see a movie have it's main characters as skinny unmuscular males and gives a go at representation to the people who actually looked like this in high school.  Perhaps this refreshingness and not putting a nerd who is still chiseled and ripped when he takes off his shirt is part of this film's popularity.  Although they still had Deb the shy female nerdy girl played by a hot actress (Tina Majorino) who was probably only second to Haylie Duff in the most attractive actresses in the film, all they did was put her hair into a weird side ponytail, that most guys would have thought well I'll just ask her to wear her hair down if I date her.  So they haven't really abandoned the ""regular' people with hot actors thing completely.

I thought Diedrich Bader (the karate instuctor) was a bit underutilised, although granted his whole career outside of the Drew Carey Show and Outsourced probably has been.  But when I saw his name on the DVD cover I was looking forward to seeing what he could bring to this movie.  It did have some storyline surprises, I thought his brother's computer girlfriend was going to play out a certain way and was surprised with where that part went, although that storyline sort of fizzled out.  I didn't really get though how Napoleon couldn't grow a mustache like Pedro's when his brother could.  Surely they have the same genetics, although perhaps Napoleon's character was supposed to be younger than the actor was, but this wasn't a big thing anyway.

It's a film that is part of popular culture and people rave about but for me Napoleon Dynamite, it just didn't do anything for me.",1453161600,,3565,4.352941176470588

1546287,5,B00005JNBQ,"There already are more reviews of this delightful film on the various Amazon sites than anyone is likely to read all or most of. I'll just limit my contribution to comments about the movie to noting that I enjoy all the visual humour in this film, among its many other great ingredients.

I come from an Utah family on my mother's side and this film, set in Idaho, which is a single cultural entity, also highly L.D.S. Mormon, along with Utah itself; I admit gladly that some, maybe even many, Idaho folks, even some among those whom I know personally, disagree with that or resent that fact. There are lots of little clues that Napoleon and his family, and surely others in the cast of characters, are L.D.S. Mormons.

As for that amusing outdoor interracial wedding ceremony between Napoleon's older, very nerdy, pipsqueak brother, Kip, and very tall Lafawnduh, for those who wonder about the matter, one should realise that less than half of L.D.S. Mormon weddings take place in one of the L.D.S. Temples, so Kip's and Lafawnduh's is not surprising at all. My L.D.S. grandfather married twenty-two times (mostly in civil ceremonies in the days, before computerised records, when polygamists could be difficult to apprehend) and so far as I know, most or none of those times did he marry his mostly polygamous wives in the Temple; by his time, at any rate, polygamy was a ""no-no"" in the L.D.S. cult. Anyhow, grandpa was too much of a boozer to be able to obtain a ""Temple recommend"". Mormon bye-ways and folk culture do not  necessarily comply with what many outsiders expect.

Among the funniest of the sly indicators of the Mormon culture underlying this comedy is one of Napoleon's t-shirts, which says ""Ricks College"" on it. Ha! Who even would want to identify so openly with that notoriously mediocre institution, which is on the low-brow end of Mormon education (B.Y.U. being at the high, VERY HIGH end)? Ricks College was a junior college, oriented towards business, education, and other middle-class quasi-professional or trade studies rather than at anything very intellectual or artistic soever. (However, Ricks has become an university in recent years.) So, wearing a t-shirt for Ricks is a sign of low aspirations.

Anyway, I love the movie. Westerners especially will enjoy it, but it is fun for all and sundry.",1451865600,,2326,4.893401015228426

1546537,5,B00005JNBQ,"I can totally understand how some people may not get this movie at all. It's beyond quirky - it's genteel and totally sympathetic to a social wavelength that some people went to extreme lengths to avoid. Basically, if you are Summer Wheatly and her beau Don, this is definitely not for you.

If you relate to Napoleon or (horrors,) his older brother Kip, and you recognize the various cultural references - such as an 8' tangled phone cord, moon boots, a 70's camper van, cassette tapes, dial-up internet access, bust development magazine ads, tater tots, quintessential 80's prom songs, and (wait for it,) TETHER-BALL. then you will at least be in the same area code as this movie.

It's really odd, and yet in an extremely gentle and sympathetic manner. You have no profanity, (unless GOSH! is still on your radar,) no violence, (sorry TOTS,) and an ending that is reminiscent of all those golden age comics and movies that ended so neatly and nicely. As Pedro says, ""Vote for me, and all your wildest dreams will come true."" Huh? Really? All of them?

Well, at last count, Pedro gets his student body Presidency, Granma gets back home to her precious Llama, Tina, Uncle Rico gets his girlfriend back, (who is quite a looker, and too bad we don't get to see any of her earlier in the picture,) Kip gets his internet chat-babe, LaFawnda, (who is thrilled to be marrying him in the post-credits scene,) and Napoleon and his home-slice girl, Deb, kinda get back to their kinda simple relationship, as Nap proffers this meaty phrase, ""I caught you a delicious bass,"" (which meaning I have yet to adequately discern, but hey, it's truly ""all good"" here.)

It's when the thing is done and you look back and see where you've been is when this movie kind of breaks on you, and you realize you've witnessed something rather special and not really mainstream on any level, (which is the heart of it's magic.) It's a nerdy little movie about some nerdy little people, made by some young nerdy Mormon filmmakers who show what they can do when they've got something interesting to work with. You'll probably never visit the Idaho region where this movie is set and was shot, but you'll instantly identify with all the characters and situations you'll encounter.

This movie is a gold-mine of quotes and character phrases. Who can forget such jewels as, ""Can you pull me into town?"" ""With a 12 gauge, naturally,"" and ""Bow to your Sensei, BOW TO YOUR SENSEI!"" You'll be referencing this movie for quite some time.

I just really like this movie a whole lot. There is this scene where Napoleon tries to jump a makeshift ramp with his bike, and ends up with an epic FAIL with no sympathy whatever. What's so funny about that? Well, wasn't that what happened when you tried it all those years ago? Splat! Right in front of everyone. No sympathy, no mercy, just that special kind of funny reserved for memories belonging in a morgue. Bam! (Funny.)

It was long after it's theater release that I finally saw this. (Always wondered what was with those VOTE FOR PEDRO T-shirts.) Well now I know, and I'm happy to report it has lost nothing in the intervening years. I know they resurrected the cast for an initial season of the animated show, (which was not bad, but had to work much harder than this movie ever did,) but even a sequel would be seriously difficult to pull off. I can't help but think it would be closer to a Harold and Kumar movie, (which was seriously drecky out of the box.)

This one will have to stand alone, but you hope someday the producers find a little more of this and shake the bottle one more time. Would be great to see something like this again.",1445817600,,3656,4.596625766871166

1546921,1,B00005JNBQ,"Let me start by openly admitting that I am an 80's throwback and proud of it. I understand that my era did not produce horribly intelligent, deeply touching movies. That being said, this movie puts the Du-h! in Dumb!!  My teenage daughter had seen it a sleepover, so we rented it so she could show me how silly it is for our girly night.  She actually got tickled at a few spots on her second run through it. I sat open mouthed, amazed at the sheer senselessness of the whole thing...waiting desperately for a plot or growth of a character. None came. Since we had it rented for the weekend, she showed it to her older brother the next night. She giggled again, and he snickered with a confused look on his face once in a while. Then we couldn't let my Hubby miss out on the sheer stupidity of it all, so we watched it with him on Sunday afternoon.  Our daughter and son both snickered here and there, mostly at the looks on their parents' faces.  My husband was, as was I, gobsmackered. We kept looking at each other as if to assure each other that it was indeed that painfully dumb.  The only real emotion I felt was a horribly heartbroken, sick to my stomach feeling for Napoleon and his friends for being so awkward and socially inept...I remember kids who struggled in school that way, and I always almost cried every time I saw them in a tough situation.  If anything it brought back bad memories of school....who needs that?  Anyway, all this to say it is a story about an awkward boy who uses bluster and dumb responses to deal with not fitting in.  It follows (if you can exaggerate and say there is a plot) him as he finds friends (just as goofy as he) and finds romance...sort of.",1439424000,2,1691,4.346031746031746

I wondered if it was a documentary on art house 'anti-movies' where they are deliberately made to be annoying and pointless just so art students can boast to their friends that they managed to sit through it all. But checking the TV guide I was amazed to find I was watching a proper movie.

The main character attempts to be funny by looking dead-pan and that's the trouble - he looks like he's trying to be funny. A good comedian like Steven Wright can do dead pan to perfection because he has the talent to do it, but Jon Heder doesn't. The only reason I watched any of this movie was purely curiosity that this ever got released (or escaped?) and actually made it onto TV. I'm all in favour of free speech and anti-censorship so if people love this movie then good on them because they've seen treasure in someone else's trash.

The best reason I could find for this movie's existence is to make everything else you'll see for weeks afterwards seem brilliant by sheer comparison.",1425945600,,1159,4.436619718309859

1549809,5,B00005JNBQ,"All the schools I attended had somebody like Napoleon: nerdy for certain, often weirdly hostile, but pretty nice if you managed to get to know them. If you ever wondered what it'd be like to be that guy (or girl), Napoleon Dynamite will show you. It will also make you wince, laugh, clap, and maybe even dance for happiness.

Napoleon's home life is odd: he and his 32-year-old brother Kip live in the Middle of Nowhere, Idaho, with their grandmother and her llama, Tina. Kip stays home ""chatting online with babes all day"" while Napoleon starts another grueling school year, teased by jocks and bullies, and bossed around by Grandma. But this time he makes two new friends, glamor shot photographer Deb and Mexican transplant Pedro Sanchez. At last, his life starts to change for the better--even after Grandma gets in an accident and creepy Uncle Rico comes to stay while she recovers.

Most people will either love or hate this movie. The dialogue is stilted (for effect, it seems), the humor is subtle, and Napoleon's actions are often puzzling. As with his real-life counterparts, he can be hard to figure out. Yet he's always true to himself, sometimes with bad results. But more often they're good, and by the end of the movie, you understand what he's all about.

The best part of the storytelling, for me anyway, was how the events of the movie just unfold, without judgment or explanation. The director, in other words, doesn't try to tell us what to think--and that's what makes Napoleon Dynamite refreshingly, wonderfully different from pretty much any other teen movie you've ever seen. The neutral perspective may be what caused many critics, including the late Roger Ebert, to pan the film. I guess that's understandable for people who are more used to codified teen films like Ferris Bueller's Day Off, where Ferris's perspective dominates so much that he even tells the audience when to go home.

But if you have even a little weirdo in your personality--and unless you're Summer Wheatley, you do--you might like Napoleon. I sure did. Here's hoping that this style of storytelling will continue to grow in popularity and produce more classic movies.",1402876800,11,2166,4.893732970027248

1549813,1,B00005JNBQ,"I've heard the raves about this movie, seen the ""VOTE FOR PEDRO"" bumper stickers, and heard my then-girlfriend's nephews say that they wanted to be Napoleon Dynamite for Halloween.  So finally I got a video of this movie, expecting a laugh riot.  Except that I didn't laugh or smile once.  The story was confusing, the acting was awful, the characters were all unlikable and unsympathetic, and there was neither tension or wit, or even any reason to stay interested.  I only waited through the end because I was wondering when I'd find the reason everyone thought it would be so good.  I never found it.

Seeing all the positive reviews here, I could not help but being reminded of a ""Candid Camera"" episode where one person tells a joke that makes no sense, two actors laugh uproariously at it, and we wait to see what the reaction that the ""mark"" will have.  I can relate to ""the mark"".  Also, one man I talked to told me that he found this movie funny as a kid, but as an adult he couldn't figure out why he had thought that way.  I get the impression that people say this movie is supposed to be funny because they're supposed to, even if they don't.

If you're looking for a ""dumb humor"" movie, I recommend ""Dumb And Dumber"" instead.  Much better acting, a surprising degree of wit, and you find a reason to care what happens in the end.",1401580800,5,1342,4.436734693877551

The price was great and I even got a NP devotional to go along with it as it is part of a high school graduation gift for my son. It will be fun to own. We just watch it over an over. You'll either love this movie or hate it. If you hate it, it is because you don't ""get"" it. I have to laugh at the reviews that say ""the actors can't act."" Really? This isn't a drama. Where else do llamas get their casserole dinners chucked at them? Make sure you watch after the credits for Kip's love song! We laugh so hard we cry at this movie.",1399852800,,676,3.801418439716312

The serious aspect of this movie is I guess the social status in highschools, the importance of said status, and the troubles of growing up.  The weird thing is that nobody in the ""lesser"" status seems to care that they're there, it only matters to the higher-up students.  Does that mean they've gotten over this whole charade of ""power"" based on who you are, or that they've accepted their fate as losers?  And is either of those things something that the viewer should learn from as a good example?  There's a lot going on in this movie under-the-cuff that once you notice it really gets you to think.

Then there's the fact that this movie just can't be any more hilarious.  ""Tina... eat the food!""  This movie immediately brightens me up, and I will nevereverever get tired of it!!",1398124800,,1037,4.439153439153439

1550254,5,B00005JNBQ,"Having grown up in a small town in the Midwest, I resonated with this comedy on many levels as a satire of the rural Midwest. I can't even remember how many times I've watched this film . . . I own the DVD and still can't resist watching it whenever it comes on a cable movie channel! If this is a cult comedy, I guess I'm a full-blown cult member!

The movie is hilariious because of the quirky dialogue and outrageous character satire, making fun of the usual cast of high-school types - the popular cheerleader and primo jock, the school bully, the wallflower, the nerd, the alienated immigrant.  There's also the anti-PC jabs, such as eating beef steak for breakfast, lunch and dinner with no veggies in sight! For me the interest lies in how the movie presents a cultural anthropology of the changing rural Midwest.

We know the internet is changing the world, and we see this in the movie when Napoleans' brother leaves for Detroit with an inner-city girlfriend he met through an internet chat room.

Immigration is also changing the rural Midwest, as we see in Napolean's friend Pedro moving to small-town Idaho from Mexico.

The family is also changing - Napolean lives with his grandmother and brother with no parents in sight.

Thankfully, there were no drugs in the movie, even though they are changing rural America as much as anything.",1393545600,,1348,4.690677966101695

It's a very funny film with a number of touching scenes nestled in, filmed as if in some sort of strange 80's vortex.  There are a couple scenes that might be a little inappropriate for young kids, but otherwise this is a great window into the life of a bizarre yet hilarious character.",1391904000,,592,4.628571428571429

My grandson attended most of the filming hoping to be seen in the movie. He is in quite a few scenes. A couple of days before the last day of filming I was invited to be the secretary in the high school scene. (a job I held for 17 years). It has been a fun experience especially when we travel and people find out we were in the movie.  If they like the movie, we tell them we were in it. If they didn't like it we just move on. Their loss! When I say ""we"", my husband was with me in the wedding scene and the other person I travel a lot with is the teacher who tells Napoleon on the stage that he needs a skit. Anyway it has been a great adventure. I live across the street from the Llama, Tina and we have had a lot of people stop in to talk about the movie.

For whatever reason this film was being shown on dvd through an old stereo console television. The volume was blaring and I just so happened to walk in when Rex the television sensai was offering his $300 eight-week program. Kip and Napoleon's reaction to the $300 instantly had me hooked. I mean who can forget Kip volunteering and acting like a complete puss in front of the entire class?

I guess the store owners already knew something I didn't; that ""Napoleon Dynamite"", the template of an original, indie, hippie film produced on an ultra-low budget was one of the most memorable and hilarious rides of its era.

1550749,5,B00005JNBQ,"This is an odd film about odd characters and has now apparently achieved a cult status.  It's been years since I've seen it but the basis is the following.

Dynamite is the nerdy main character and his main connection to the American mainstream is attending high school in rural Idaho.  He is surrounded by odd characters who are always trying some trick to get ahead, everything except hard work or study.  Eventually Dynamite runs into the second main character in high school, who could be an illegal alien from Mexico but the movie never identifies his status.

The movie ends up being a version of the traditional American high school saga where outsiders like Dynamite and his Mexican friend confront insiders like the head cheerleader or the football team captain.  The ending is predictable but the movie is memorable because of its oddity.",1386374400,,848,4.895104895104895

It's a classic that everyone should have. It's weird and really awkward, but that is the fun part about Napoleon Dynamite.

The third time I recognized the movie isn't stupid--its about the average live of an average young man in America today, which, we should face it folks, is all too often stupid and degrading. Ultimately, this film is supportive, touching, and fun. More than one viewing may be required for people like me who are mystified by what is enthusiastically endorsed in American culture.

It has a lulling, dumbing down effect on the viewer that you fear you may become the Napoleon in real life. Yeah, everything was so utterly unfunny and numbing that as time went by I couldn't help but to like it. There was something simple and sincere about this movie. It does not have the bells and whistles and fast action as most, but its nonetheless a good movie. I loved Napoleons dance number. Was is just me or did this movie also have the same lulling effect on you? Someone said on the message board that if people in Idaho were like Napoleon, the state should be left out of national elections. I never laughed so hard at a comment on IMDb.

1551344,1,B00005JNBQ,"THIS motion picture has a very blatant anti-white / pro-whigga message peddled to teens!

A Mexican kid asks a WHITE stuck-up girl to a dance and she snottily declines. A geeky white kid ( who happens to be the title character, if that's of any importance ) asks another girl, also a WHITE girl who likewise turns out to be a stuck-up snotty biatch. She agrees to accompany him to the event but ditches him upon arriving there because she was appalled by his crude drawing of her likeness ( which he erroneously used to woo her ). The two white stuck-up girls, as it turns out, happen to be running together in the high school election as president and mate ( respectively ). The previously spurned Mexican and white nerd decide to team together and run against them. Then at some point later in the proceedings, a certain negress arrives upon the scenario, blowing into town on a transit bus. This newly arrived negress, it turns out, is the lover of the white geeky boy title characters whigga brother. He carries on lewdly and ostentatiously with his negress girlfriend and tells the white geeky boy ""THIS is my soul mate! Yours is out there too somewhere. You just have to wait for her "" , .. . Hmmmmmmmm, . . I wonder WHAT THAT might possibly be a not-so subtle endorsement of , especially taking the two White snotty stuck-up girls, from earlier in the film, into account? The negress gives geeky white boy an audio casset of some hip hop disco funk'abooty type ""music"" and he then practices ""dancing"" to it. Finally, at the high school election ceremony, white nerd Wows the audience and wins majority vote by playing the disco hip hop funk'abooty ""music"" that the negress had imparted to him and doing a ridiculous ""dance"" to it which apparently and inexplicably impresses them greatly ( exclaiming ""YAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" and obnoxiously chanting loudly, repeatedly and in collective unison ""GO WHITE BOY!!!!!! GO WHITE BOY!!!!!!!!!! GO WHITE BOY!!!!!!!! ... .. ."" ), .. . and thus, in the process, CREAMING the duo of stuck up snotty WHITE bitchez who'd scorned them earlier in the film!!

Surely one of the most blatant and flagrant examples of white-self hatred and whiggaism promoted in popular teen-oriented media ""culture"" by contemporary Joolywood that I have yet beheld!!!!!!!",1367884800,,2305,4.847715736040609

Yes, it has some rough edges and a hestant jerkiness in the acting and editing, and Napoleon himself is not entirely sympathetic, to say the least. There is, however, an earnest sincerity about the picture, and its tone and set of messages hit the bull's-eye when it comes to speaking some deep emotional truths. If quirky and offbeat and iconoclastic are adjectives you feel at home with, you'll take to it. I certainly have over the years.",1367020800,2,544,4.561224489795919

I love his brother and uncle in the movie.  I wish the romantic side of the story went a little further, but this movie is so awkward that that may have just ruined the movie.  The other movies from these creators is also good, Nacho Libre, and Gentlemen Broncos are also great, especially Broncos.  There are soo many great lines and scenes in this movie.

The first time I saw this in the theater, there were about ten people in the audience and I was the only one laughing, but I was laughing hysterically.

What they need to keep in mind is that they are not flies on the wall, there is a camera CREW in front of people on reality shows. Ask yourself, could you act normal with a camera crew in your living room? You have two choices, hide, or act.
So the conflict is, these people watch Napoleon Dynamite and think it is a reality show, when in fact it is fabulous acting. Jon Heder and Efron Ramirez have been in several movies, and when you see them you think, wow, they were acting fabulous in N.D. I am a teacher of 20 years, and a parent two. Of course there are nerds and geeks, but never to this level. Thats why this movie is great.

1551486,1,B00005JNBQ,"Edit-Original review below :

I've made my feelings known. Took the kids to my brothers. Got there & was told they heard of a great movie we ALL were going to watch. Heard the name & I was like 'OH NO, I just saw that & it was terrible'. However, wanting them to form their own conclusion along with my kids & theirs (who had no idea I HATED THIS), we watched it. I kept my mouth shut the entire movie. My brother, sister in law, neices/nephews & my kids, along with 3 of the kids friends thought this was awful. The entire movie, all they did was rag on it & say it was 'STUPID' the entire flick. 'STUPID' was an adjective I used but never mentioned so I got quite a laugh hearing adults & 7 kids all use the same adjective, along with many more non flattering ones. & sorry to say, it was just as AWFUL watching it the 2nd time as it was the 1st. What really threw me was this is supposed to be a G rated 'family' flick, & I guess in theory it certainly is.....But needless to say us adults were quite off guard when the KIDS starting making comments about how the characters ALL LOOK STONED...Yep...KIDS made these comments!

Anyway, just thought id edit this & add the above as not 1 of us liked this flick & ALL OF US thought it was HORRIBLE/STUPID...pick your most unflattering adjective & add it in....Even ALL the kids hated this.

I know with movies everybody has different tastes but every now & then you see a flick leaving you wondering how anybody could have liked it. This is it!!! Again, I know everybody has different tastes & I respect the fact some liked or even loved this flick...but it still leaves me wondering how anybody could like this stupid tripe. IT WAS REALLY THAT BAD.....
--------------------------------------------
Saw this on tv. Saw it had 3.5 star rating which means excellent from my provider. Saw the reviews here which were pretty gapping. Not many 'in the middle'. Most are either 5 star or 1 star, meaning most either loved or hated it.

Put me in the hated it camp.

Yes, I forced myself to watch it & although I kept wanting to turn it off, I gave in & watched it all.

I won't say this is the worst movie I ever watched but its high on the list.

This flick was simply one of the most absurdly boring & 'stupid' flicks I have ever seen. While I fully understand everybody has different tastes, im still a bit shocked that anybody actually liked this ridiculous tripe.

But please, watch it for yourself & form your own conclusion, as I did.

But yep, If I tried listing everything I HATED about this flick, I'd be typing for hours. It was that HORRIBLE!!

Glad some liked it, but for the life of me I cant comprehend why. One of the most boring & stupid flicks i've ever watched!",1357689600,3,2723,4.311154598825832

Napoleon helps his friend win the student counsel election, gets a fairly cute girlfriend, and avoids getting wrapped up in his uncle's insane schemes. After that, he successfully goes to the prom and steals the show at the school talent show. This guy is a loser, but he can dance like a mofo.

1551724,5,B00005JNBQ,"NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is a hard movie to describe. It's sort of a teen comedy, but it's not the average teen comedy (especially one produced in part by MTV). There aren't many side-splitting one-liners or over-the-top-gross out gags. The foulest word in the film is either ""freaking"" or ""crap"". The only physical violence in the movie is done by high school bullies or a local martial arts master. There isn't any sex (heck there's hardly any sexual innuendo). The movie doesn't even really have a point.

Yet, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE works and works exceedingly well. It's a hilarious movie filled with some extremely memorable characters. The characters are quirky and filled with foibles. Yet, bizarre as they appear, they are so realistic it's uncanny. Who doesn't know somebody like Uncle Rico? Had my maternal grandmother lived long enough, I bet she would have spent her weekends riding an ATV. Anybody else know somebody who thinks selling ""tupperware"" is a ""real job""? The characters in NAPOLEON DYNAMITE are people sliced out of the real-life heart of America.

The story of the movie resolves around high schooler, Napoleon Dynamite. He has a 32 year-old brother, Kip, who sits around at home talking to girls on the internet 4-6 hours a day. The brothers live with their Grandma, who sneaks out to do extreme sports with her friends. Grandma gets hurt 4-wheeling on some sand dunes and Uncle Rico is sent to ""help"" the brothers while Granny recovers. Rico still lives in 1982, just before the big high school football game when the coach didn't put him in and they lost. There's a girl at school named Deb who runs her own photography studio who has a major crush on Napoleon, though he doesn't figure it out for the longest time. Napoleon's best friend is a recent immigrant student named Pedro. Pedro decides he wants to run for class president and the rest of the movie revolves around Pedro's campaign and what Napoleon does to help his friend.

The actors in NAPOLEON DYNAMITE were pretty-much no names at the time the movie originally came out (Haylie Duff, sister to Hillary was, perhaps the biggest name at the time). Jon Heder, Tina Majorino (who played the girl with the map on her back in WATERWORLD), Aaron Ruell, Jon Gries, and Efren Ramirez are all excellent in their roles. In lesser skilled actors, their roles could have been spoofy, cheesy, or over-the-top. Instead, they grind their characters to reality.

The movie has a lot of great scenes and lines and is destined to become one of the most quoted movies of all time (right up with THE PRINCESS BRIDE, TOMMY BOY, and STAR WARS). The movie also boasts a delightful soundtrack that includes everything from ""Time After Time"" to the ""A-Team Theme"" to ""I Want Candy"". As quirky as the film is, it contains some strong messages about the importance of family, sticking by your friends, following your dreams, and being the person God created you to be. All of that and chicken talons, too. In short, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is one of the most bizarre, but best films from 2004.",1338768000,2,3041,4.808795411089866
1551725,5,B00005JNBQ,Love this movie so much because of the wit and charm. Wish there was a sequel. My whole family enjoyed this movie and everybody I talk to about always laughs when thinking about it. We just had to buy the Dvd.,1338163200,2,209,4.121951219512195
1551726,1,B00005JNBQ,"The actors look as uninterested in this as I was watching it. Really I'm probably putting more effort into this review than the film makers went into writing this junk.

I think the appeal to this film though is when people say some 'in' joke, the 'cool' kids started liking this so the lemmings in grade school followed suit going ""HAHAHA, LIGER! I GET IT! DO YOU GET IT!? BECAUSE I DO""! Some films have a quirky charm to them such as Little Miss Sunshine or Lost in Translation, but this whole movie is nothing but spouting off random non-sequitors that somehow stick with high school kids who's senses of humor is still underdeveloped.

I can see years from now those kids going through their DVD collections and fishing out Napolean Dynamite and muttering to themselves ""I can't believe I watched this crap"".

Edit: I take back everything I said about Napoleon Dynamite, what with 400 copies being pawned off for $0.01 & how everyone involved in this movie's career have really picked up since 2005; Truly a timeless cinematic achievement.",1337731200,2,1043,4.751381215469613

1551812,1,B00005JNBQ,Wow and I thought joe's apartment was bad! MTV has lower there standards from making this film. Never want to see any movies that has Jon Heder in it. Shame on everyone who wasted money on this!,1316822400,,194,4.27027027027027
1551813,4,B00005JNBQ,"I'll be honest, the first time I watched this movie, I thought it was one of the worst movies I had ever seen, while my friend (who recommended we watch it together) was laughing his head off.  I realized that it was supposed to be a comedy, but I just wasn't getting it.  I was expecting some really silly slapstick power comedy.  I really thought to myself I never ever want to see this movie again.

Fast forward a few months later, and I end up forced to sit through it again.  I think during that time I had seen a couple more movies with Jon Heder which I really enjoyed, like ""School for Scoundrels"" and ""The Benchwarmers.""  So I guess I had become accustomed to his acting.  I couldn't believe that I was finding this movie entertaining the second time around.  I guess I was a little bit looser and more open-minded than I was the first time.  It's not one of those comedies that make you laugh until your side hurts, and your face muscles are fatigued from smiling.  But Jon Heder's dorkiness does grow on you after a while.

I think if you go into this movie without expecting too much as far as comedy or story line, because there basically isn't any, and you have an open mind, you'll probably be ok.  Otherwise you may be feeling the same way I felt the first time.  This is a pretty decent flick if you don't really have anything better to do, or if you want to be watching TV, but there's nothing on... except maybe this movie on FX or USA.  Because once you start watching it, it's kinda hard to pull away from it, because of the ""I can't believe I'm actually watching this crap"" phenomenon.

This is supposed to be entertainment, not meant to be a seemingly ""true to life"" story or characters.  Because it is anything but that.  No one is this dorky you would think, but you know, somewhere out there in the world, there probably is and you just don't know them.  It is meant to push the boundarys of dorkiness, dweebiness, and stupidity.  Take it for what it's worth, and don't expect anything deep, or real, or yes you will indeed be disappointed.

As much as this movie has grown on me, I didn't have the heart to give it 5 stars, but I do ""like"" the movie.",1316563200,,2178,4.304668304668304

It has such a sweet humor to it, and a few moments that I'll laugh out loud about just thinking of. I know a lot of theaters across the country used to hold ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" nights where people would come in dressed like the characters and throw stuff at the screen. I think this movie would be a perfect modern update to that tradition. I'd love to go dressed as Deb, and throw Tina's dinner at the screen!",1312416000,2,579,4.178571428571429

1551878,4,B00005JNBQ,"This is a movie I can say is certainly among,if not THE,most quirkiest movie I have ever seen/reviewed. Released in January/04,it stars Jon Heder as the nerd supreme. His world is populated by stereotypical characters of the extreme;the downtrodden and we-don't-fit-in types to the ""popular"" people and bullies. The plot,which if turned sideways would disappear,is as quirky as the characters that populate it.
The story takes place in rural Preston,Idaho in the early 90s,but the Dynamite family,house and decor suggest a definite 70s kiche. Napolean and brother Kip(Aaron Ruell)live with their grandmother(Sandy Martin),ho is most definitely butch in nature. One day their granny tells the boys she is going out on a date but ends up in the hospital for a spell after injuring herself while riding an ATV over a particularly large desert dune. Coming to the baby sitting rescue is their uncle Rico(John Gries)who has the old should've,could've-longing from his high school days. As Napoleon plods along at school Kip,who sits in front of a computer screen all day,is persuaded to forgo his internet chatting/surfing long enough to help his uncle make a little bread.
Meanwhile at school Napolean has befriended a Mexican student by the name of Pedro(Efren Ramirez).The first big challenge to them comes picking and getting someone to take to the prom. The next one is Pedro`s desire to become student president. Pedro ends up taking a girl that Napolean kind of had his eye on to the dance and in the end Pedro actually wins the presidency.
As the movie comes to a close Grandma has returned,Kip has met someone from his chat room who is his ``soul mate`` and that girl Napolean likes,Deb(Tina Majorino),meets up with Nappy to play tether ball. In a post credit sequence Kip and his ``soul mate`` Lafawnduh(Shondrella Avery)get married and a lateto the wedding Napolean rides up on a ``just tamed`` wild horse,which he presents to the bride and groom who ride off as Napolean is heard to utter,``lucky``.
As I said there is just enough of a ``plot`` to give the characters here impetus to go from one situation to another and that is it. But since everyone is soooo quirky you pay not so much attention to where it is going as to enjoying the ride itself. Napolean is the star character and he seems to be an 11 year old wrapped up in a teenager`s body. His eyes rarely make contact with anyone,he says ``flippin` `` alot and when frustrated he makes a deep guttural sigh. His run is like the loping gait of the creatures from the original``Invaders from Mars``,just hilarious;another quirky character trait among many,that endears this character(and movie)to the viewer. This movie made for a paltry $400,000 made over $46,000,000!! Astounding.
This film is presented in BOTH widescreen(1:85:1) and fullscreen versions,which means they have put it on a dreaded two sided disc. There are special features like a making of featurette,an extended video of the wedding,a short film ``Pelica``,deleted scenes,commentary and stills gallery. The transfer is well done and is clear and crisp.
All in all a winner of a film. A more weird and quirky film you will be hard pressed to find but it works wonderfully on many levels. Don`t anaylze it too much,just hang on and enjoy the flippin`ride. Recommended.",1308441600,,3301,4.992740471869329
1551879,5,B00005JNBQ,"I laugh a little bit harder every time I sit down with this one, but can acknowledge that other viewers' enjoyment will depend entirely upon their own experiences in high school. As a proud survivor of the awkward, unpopular farm town geek club myself, though, there's a lot of familiar territory covered between the credits of this little sensation. The film itself is a conundrum; an MTV production that feels like a DIY indie picture, it successfully captures the best elements of each without getting snagged by any of the drawbacks. Napoleon and friends come off as just awkward enough to feel authentic in their small town school, while the studio's big city influence delivers a surprisingly appropriate, not-quite-star-studded soundtrack. It's at once sweet, funny, genuine and flamboyant, with a story arc that always gives me the warm fuzzies. Fellow bully targets who can laugh at their own origins will find a whole lot to like about this one, but members of the other cliques may not find themselves as enamored.",1308268800,2,1025,5.0
1551880,4,B00005JNBQ,"I really like Napoleon Dynamite. I'd have given it 5 stars, but it took me several viewings to understand the movie. On the surface, its just a bonehead comedy about dorks and nerds, and I didn't like it. But there's some real subtle acting that I didn't notice at first because its such a weird movie with quirky characters which are funny, but distract one initially from the theme. Its almost a perfect movie, which will be appreaciated as the years pass by. Some of the scenes which are really subtle are when Napoleon's date leaves him at the dance, and he looks at himself in the mirror.

The movie is about high school outcasts, dreamers and wannabees. It brings you into their world without patronizing them. A world of drawing and dreaming about unicorns and babes and wanting to be accepted and liked. Its about how we judge people, or rather misjudging people'a worth, and the meaning of friendship and loyalty. It's about how everyone has personal worth.  Its about wanting to say the right thing, when you don't have the skills to, and having friends accept one for who they are. In the end, I'm always charmed by Napoleon's courage to be happy with who he is, and Deb's acceptance of him as he is. It's such a charming movie. It's ok to be happy with yourself, no matter how strange your interests, and finding out that you like people for who they are inside. I think the critics totally weren't ready for this and missed it's depth. And to top it off, its fun!",1307577600,2,1476,4.52434456928839

Honestly it should be a .5 star film, but it doesn't hit that level of suck, it has some funny parts (the shooting of a cow in front of a school bus full of young children is hilarious) and it has a weird premise (that the main character is a totally unlikable loser with no redeeming features), but it has no plot, like ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" with all the likability and identifiable characters drained away and replaced with weirdness.

1551971,4,B00005JNBQ,"In ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra,"" Nietzsche wrote ""And man shall be that to overman: a laughingstock or painful embarrassment."" On the surface, Napoleon Dynamite is a silly high-school farce filled with two-dimensional cartoon characters. But its appeal surpasses. While no ""Citizen Kane"" or ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (hence my four stars,) it is nothing less than a brilliant example of how detached humans can be from the reality of the world around them. Those who think they are in the know, such as the adult high-school kid Uncle Rico, or the ""hot chick"" Trisha, are illustrations of individuals still clearly detached from human emotions; therefore, they do not ""get it."" They have created a ""here-ness"" based on external influences, not internal values.

Meanwhile, the dorky Napoleon struggles to understand his place in a reality that is perplexing and most rewarding when fantastical. He clearly has developed values ""Plus you're like the only guy at school who has a mustache,"" but he struggles to understand his place in the featureless Idaho pastureland, his only real world. It is a world largely devoid of external stimulation so he escapes into his world of Ligers. It is a world largely devoid of emotion let alone God, with one exception, the wondrous coupling of Napoleon's brother Kip and his on-line fling Lafawnduh. In them, we see even when detached in the real world, love can grow when itself is real.

At it's climax, Napoleon finds self-developmental breakthrough in creative expression, shocking those who did not ""get it"" and winning the admiration of those who do.

I recommend Napoleon Dynamite. You guys will have a killer time with it.",1291507200,,1662,5.08058608058608

1552044,4,B00005JNBQ,"Napoleon Dynamite is one of those movies you either get or you don't.

Some people will laugh because they think the characters are pathetic and stupid and, well...it's fun to laugh at people so we can feel better about ourselves, isn't it? For people like that, it is probably important to pay attention to Don, the ""cool"" guy at Preston High who laughs incredulously at Napoleon and his friends...but who is also unaware that he's the most pathetic character in the film.

Anyway, I think the genius of this movie is partly in its deadly accurate portrayal of small-town American life for teenagers. I grew up in rural Maine (another potato farming state) and I identified very strongly with many of the seemingly absurd situations in the movie...the wacky characters are not so wacky, really. The way some shots are set up say so much about what a struggle it can be to fit in in a place where the both minds and cliques are pretty closed.

Most of the movie's charm is in its examination of the power of true friendship. Anyone who doesn't think there is a deeper meaning to this somewhat pointless, plotless, random collection of bizarre situations doesn't understand what it means to be willing to do anything for people you care about.

In the end, this is a highly original movie(with a very good soundtrack)that will be enjoyed by the Dons of the world who like to laugh at the geeks (unfortunately) and enjoyed more by those who can see pieces of their own humanity in Napoleon and his family and friends.",1246752000,8,1515,4.662921348314606

I will say this to those who ask ""Why do you like it so much?""  I can't explain humor.  I will say that months after its release, people such as Mel Brooks referred to it as genius.

You need to see it for yourself.  But before you do ask yourself 1) Do you like Tots (the food, not little kids)? 2) School politics? 3) How about Tupperware?  4) or egg-flavored Tang? 5) How about steak?

1552147,4,B00005JNBQ,"If someone had told me an independent film about a geeky nerd--a film sporting a cast of characters who sit around with the most vacuous, blank expressions imaginable, and whose dialogue consists primarily of monosyllabic words--would become a cultural phenomenon. . .I would be asking that person if I could have what he or she is drinking.  Yet such is indeed the case with the extremely strange NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE, a movie so. . .different. . .it's still creating a buzz, as evidenced by the 1400 reviews here (and counting).

Napolean (Jon Heder).  Pedro (Efren Ramirez).  Kip (Aaron Ruell).  Uncle Rico (Jon Gries).  Gentlemen, I salute you.  You have taken your respective characters to the realm of bizzarro (and beyond).  And after my initial shock, after several subsequent viewings, I have thoroughly enjoyed your performances:  Kip's unique method of locomotion; Uncle Rico's love of steak and of videotaping his throwing motion; Pedro's blank gaping; Napolean's ultimate dancing performance.  All of the above now ensconced in film legend; all of the above just plain darn fun to watch.

It's often lame and ridiculous, and sometimes Heder's nerdiness becomes so irritating it's tempting to send the remote through the flat screen, but director Jared Hess knew what he was doing when he crafted this supremely unique film.  NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE, kind of like a mosquito bite, just grows on you, and is more fun to watch as you scratch.

My own high school experience was more like Napoleon Dynamite than other films like American Pie (good grief).

I watched it three times in one day. The first viewing I was confused...it did not seem that funny. The second and third time I watched it I just laughed and laughed through out the whole movie.

1552225,3,B00005JNBQ,"Jared Hess's cult classic from 2004, Napoleon Dynamite, immediately drew me back to such films as Rushmore, Election, and Welcome To The Dollhouse- films that deal with high school life in comic ways. Yet, of those films, Napoleon Dynamite is probably the most off the wall. The film is set in director Hess's hometown of Preston, Idaho, in the southeastern corner of the state, not far from the Great Salt Lake. It is not a parody, but an absurdist tale, as none of the characters are in the least bit realistic. Napoleon Dynamite is the lead character's name (and yes, it sounds like the name of a loser from a bad punk rock band), and he is played by newcomer Jon Heder- a tall, red afro'd, four-eyed geek who is a not too good liar. He lives with his grandmother (Sandy Martin) and websurfing, geeky older brother Kipling (Aaron Ruell), until grandma wipes out in an ATV accident on sand dunes. Then, their uncle Rico (Jon Gries) comes to live with the boys. Rico is a bad Tupperware salesman who lives out of his aging van, and still wishes it was 1982, when he was a backup high school quarterback. He feels his coach's decision not to put him into the game denied him a shot at the NFL. Napoleon's school life is not much better. He's bullied by kids his age and younger, and makes only two friends- a Mexican kid named Pedro Sanchez (Efren Ramirez), who's as passionless as his name is generic, but who has a sweet bicycle, can work up the courage to talk to girls, and has an real mustache, and a cute, but weird brunet girl named Deb (Tina Majorino), who attempts to run her own door-to-door Glamour Shots business.... The film is well written by Hess and his wife Jerusha, and there is a making of featurette not for the film, but the addendum wedding after the credits. This seems wholly in keeping with the film. There is also a commentary with Hess and Heder, but little of note is said, save for the fact that we learn Heder is married in real life, and Majorino (Deb) is a hip hop dance instructor. The film, however, tells much more than other films with seemingly similar subjects because it does not try. What it shows, though, is really, really funny.",1221436800,,2171,4.484848484848484

1552411,4,B00005JNBQ,"In a godforsaken small town in Idaho, Napoleon Dynamite, the nerd to end all nerds, tries to survive high school. Harassed by the school bullies, ignored by the girls, living in a dysfunctional family consisting of his thirty years old brother, his hospitalized grandmother and the con man of his uncle, he clings to his only friend in school, the Mexican immigrant Pedro, and Debbie (Tina Majorino, who made some hit films as a child actress during the 1990s and returns to a major film after a decade), who for some mysterious reason might be attracted to him. When Pedro decides to run for school president, Napoleon Dynamite sees this as an opportunity for revenge from the rest of his class. Napoleon Dynamite seems the impossible: an outrageously funny teen comedy with zero references to sexual humor or bodily functions (maybe this has to do with the writer director being a Mormon). At first, I didn't like the movie much, as most of the jokes were at Napoleon's expense, looking as if the director was joining the bullies. But it very soon warms up to his character. It does have a resemblance to some of the movies of Todd Solondz, but without the self-hate and with a much saner sense of humor.",1204156800,,1206,4.693396226415095

Napoleon and his older brother Kip are loners who don't have many if any friends.  Napoleon is a high school student trying to fit in while Kip stays at home and carries out an odd relationship with an internet chat partner whom he has never met.

1552414,4,B00005JNBQ,"This is a small film, a very good one, told large. The director, Jared Hess, is a 24 year old wunderkind from the barrens of Preston, Idaho, and he has created a gem; a cousin to the Coens. This is a comedy that will sneak up on you, the stuff of belly laughs. Last year he did a 9-minute short film, PELUCA, starring Jon Heder, and it seems to have been the outline for this feature film. Hess is from Preston, and he filmed it as only a resident could; full of empty landscapes, lonely roads, farmers, ranchers, and rednecks. A scene where Napoleon gets a job for the day on a chicken ranch is worth the price of admission.

There have been numerous comparisons for this movie to WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE, and RUSHMORE. But for me this film stands firmly on its own. It plays out like an absurdist straight drama that also happens to be funny. It is reminiscent of some of the best moments in the Coen Brother's RAISING ARIZONA.

The film was a big hit at Sundance, and it has been distributed well; a lucky break for Hess. Wouldn't it be wonderful if more of the youth of our country could rally behind this tiny epic, and create it as a cult film; that for a moment they step away from the commedia del raunchy that they mostly immerse themselves in; that they actually laugh at themselves, the way they really are, just kids struggling to grow up? The 13-30 year old demographic dictates our art, our music, and our movies. This little film could go a long ways in restoring the missing heart, the naivete and grace to the comedic genre.

One real plus for me was the odd wholesomeness of this movie. There was zero profanity. Most of the time when a script deletes realistic high school vernacular, and changes the language to a lot of goshs, dangs, hecks, frigging, and freaking, it usually morphs quickly into the landscape of the lame. But somehow, Hess makes the lack of profanity work, and we don't miss it.

Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Jon Heder,"" geek deadpan perfection."" He loved the film, and directs us,"" to laugh until it hurts."" Heder is a lanky beanpole with a red Afro, all Adam's apple and oversized glasses, and overbite. At first glance one sees a young Yahoo Serious, or a Scott ""Carrot Top"" Thompson. But no, Heder is more natural, more believable, more absurd, and wonderfully unselfconscious. He is less the over-the-top screamer. In his best moments, like when he played tetherball with himself, or practiced his killer dance moves in his room, he reminded me of some of the great clowns; like a young Jerry Lewis, and even the precursory shadings of the great ones like Jackie Gleason in GIGOT, or Jacques Tati. Heder is Napoleon Dynamite, a prince of Preston, a nerdish Conan out to slay demons, or maybe just to get laid.

The setting for the film seems to be the early 1990's. Napoleon, and his older brother, Kip, live with their grandmother, played by Sandy Martin, who does a great turn as a biker grandma, who still dates, eats entirely too much steak, and loves her llama. Aaron Ruell, as the brother Kip, a 32 year old who has been a nerd for so long he is oblivious to it, does a fine job with the role. He lives in front of his computer, logging countless hours in chat rooms, searching for cyber-love, running up huge internet bills. Tina Mjorino, as girlfriend Deb, was wonderfully wacky, off-center, and loveable. A former child star, from films like WATERWORLD, she is 19 years old now, and she is good enough to be slugging it out with the likes of Thora Birch, Jena Malone, and Christina Ricci for those Odd Girl parts. She found the sweet quirkiness and heartfelt honesty of her character. Jon Gries, an actor since 1968, son of famed film director Tom Gries, was very good as the arrogant deluded ignorant Uncle Ricco; a man stuck in the past, reliving a fake fantasy that when he played high school football he might have been a great star, even turned pro...if his stupid coach had not left him on the bench so much. Efrem Ramirez, as Napoleon's best friend, Pedro, is a veteran actor from 10 films. His baby face, and deadpan delivery served him well. He did an excellent job. When he decided to run for class president, against a popular cheerleader, the tempo begins to shift, and we begin to see that this sad and funny drama was going to bend into a kind of fantasy tale; with underdogs rising to the occasion, taking on overwhelming odds, and of course, emerging victorious.

In smaller roles we first find Diedrich Baker as the karate teacher Rex, and he is the most seasoned veteran of the cast, having appeared in 33 films. He had a lot of fun with this part, prancing around in his American flag ""bad-boy"" pants, and pushing around the local kids while taking their money. Then there is Shondrella Avery appearing as Kip's cyberlove La Fawnduh. She is one hot mama, and she seems to like short skinny white dudes. When Kip boards the bus with her, bandana on his head, glasses in his pocket, suitcases in his hands, leaving home for the first time, we realize the film has come full circle, and now is a fairy tale.

I had approached this film skeptically not being sure how I would react or relate to it...but it won me over. It was not just another dumb comedy that would disintegrate two points off my intelligence quotient just by sitting through it.

1552417,1,B00005JNBQ,"I waited for this to come out on DVD and wasted my money renting the bloody thing. Like many reviewers have said: either love it or hate it. I definitely have a sense of humor, but I really don't understand what was so cool or funny about this movie. Maybe had I been involved in the production of it I'd find enjoyment but it just wasn't my cup of meat!

The acting was overkill. Better than your average B-movie, but they all just tried too hard. Napoleon and Pedro were the most annoying, most unbelievable characters I've ever seen. I've known a lot of dorks and dweebs in my life, but these guys were just stereotypical nerdage pushed beyond what was acceptable to me; no one is that dorky, come on!

The plot was pathetic beyond any sense of logic. Maybe I should smoke a joint and try watching it again for it to make sense. Following some dork around who spits out lame lines that everyone quotes, only to have no real change in the end, was a huge letdown and made the movie worthless to me.

The only saving grace was the dorky dance toward the end. Reminded me of the talent show in Revenge of the Nerds.

The bonus features were 1000x's better than the actual movie. You're honestly better off renting this movie and just watching that.

I can see how this became popular, as my generation is moving along and the new batch is coming forth, trying to make their impact in today's society. This movie (seems to me) tries to stamp itself as a classic similar to Fast Times At Ridgemount High or The Breakfast Club, just with a different formula. Maybe it's just that it's too different for me and I don't get it.

Bottom line: this movie is just way overhyped. Only rent it to say you've seen it. But don't buy it because everyone else tells you to.",1200441600,7,1759,4.363914373088685
1552418,5,B00005JNBQ,"I'm only reviewing this because I clicked through 2-3 pages of reviews here, and found a dozen 1-star reviews.  I was amazed to read of people that made it 35 minutes through the movie before turning it off out of utter horror/boredom/disdain.

Many of them essentially said ""how can anyone like a movie where we're supposed to laugh at stupid boring losers"".  I guess that's the difference between loving and hating this film.  Napoleon is just a goofy guy who doesn't fit in with everyone.  I don't understand how that makes him a loser.  He doesn't want to come off as another boring high-schooler, so he brags about having bow hunting skills, hunting wolverines with a 12-gauge, and having a girlfriend who models in another state, but by the end of the movie he's dancing in front of the school, riding a horse, and just having a good time.

Other than being hilarious, the movie is surprisingly tender.  Napoleon is loyal to Pedro, to his brother, and even ultimately to his Uncle.  Other moments:  When Pedro wants to impress a girl, he builds her a cake and leaves it by her door.  Napoleon wants to do the same, so he draws her a picture.  When Pedro is sick, Napoleon calls his place to see if he's okay.  Pedro's cousins give Napoleon and his date a ride to the dance.  Deb nervously tries to talk to Napoleon waiting outside of the school for a ride.  Kip somehow finds true love.  Napoleon sees Uncle Rico's true sadness, and when he sees Pedro at the height of his despair, he takes to the stage on Pedro's behalf.

Some people love this film on the basis of its ""dead-pan"" humor.  Those of us with sense realize that this film lacks any humor at all.  What the former type of viewer has mistaken for humor is a condescending hatred of its own characters.  People who like this film just enjoy laughing at nerds.  It's actually that simple.

There's no plot.  The characters, pathetic as they begin, never develop.  The so-called jokes are so dry that one feels the sensation of dying in the desert as the writers senselessly destroy the spirits of their own characters.

""This one girl told me that the second she saw me pull that (school bus) window down, it brought her right back to school.

Every kid remembers those, like, weird little buttons you had to push that were, like, impossible to get down when it was like, friggin' hot on the bus.

And she's like 'The second you pushed those down, it like, brought me back (to school).'

""And I thought that was funny.""

Or, as one enthusiastic reviewer puts it:

""Just watching Naploeon as he stuffs tater tots into his pocket for a late afternoon snack is enough to create hours of enjoyment.""

The I Hate Gen X site sums it all up better than I can:

""Gen-X film is self-indulgent, tedious, devoid of ideas, weak in its storytelling, pretentiously focused on weird unrealistic characters, celebrates ugliness, and is often crass and vulgar. Again, because they have no politics, their films lack a point of view. Overall, it is so much stylistic and intellectual ma*******tion...They do all of this to perceive themselves as 'kewl'. They've taken us to the nadir of cultural and artistic expression, and have no clue they've done so.

The GenX audience is quick to murmur or talk or in some way indicate - so others notice - that they 'get it.' Often comedy films are not funny, but GenX wants to indicate that they get where the joke was planted so they nervously laugh - as soon as possible after the punchline delivery, when what was said was simply not funny. And the characterizations in often self-absorbed and pretentious GenX films are less than a sketch most of the time. We are given a stereotype, or an outline of a character, and GenX as an audience accepts the draft as the final form. Again they indicate that they get it and can't be bothered with character development...GenX wants cartoon characters on-screen because they don't want to have an actual emotional reaction to fully developed characters...""

Idaho, the films location is a beautiful state and appears almost surreal as a backdrop to the sufferable antics of Napoleon, his geek brother and scheming uncle as they try to live under the same roof when Napoleons guardian is temporarily hospitalized. The film is so light hearted that  it challenges our own minds in what to expect next, in many instances I found myself misinterpreting the intentions of the strange group of characters, usually they ended up being far better people than I expected.
Jon Heder might have drained his whole talent pool on this, I will find it hard to see him as anyone but this well put together title role.

1552589,5,B00005JNBQ,"As an adult over 60 I was not sure if I wanted to see this or not, but it was highly recommended by younger friends, and caught my attention at the beginning. Not only was it ""retro"" but it had meaning of life throughout - everyone wants to be needed, respected, safe and loved. At first I was not sure what all the ""cheese"" and milk and cows had to do with the story, but it becomes clear later on the meaning. All the ""Steak Action"" is with Uncle Rico and always associated with unpleasantness. Cheese somehow signifies happiness in this film.

The story is about the title character, Napoleon Dynamite, who lives in a small rural town with his grandmother and 32 year old shy bachelor brother. Napoleon is a high school student that most of his peers consider weird. His brother is in his 30's and lives in on-line chatrooms. The grandmother taking care of Napoleon and his brother is injured in a dune buggy accident and sends Uncle Rico to take care of Napoleon and his brother.

Napoleon's Uncle Rico is another quirky character their caregiver and ""flim-flam"" man. Always with different schemes to make a buck. Napoleon finally starts to look at life a bit differently when he befriends a new student,Pedro. Pedro is satisfied with his life and comfortable in his own skin. He is not afraid to take chances, ask girls to dances, and run for class president.

I had heard that it was a surprise favorite at 2004 Sundance festival where it was met with non-stop laughing. Since I admire off-beat humor and am a big fan of a good comedy, I was ready to love or at least like ""Napoleon Dynamite"". I was sorely disappointed. The best and the funniest thing about ""Napoleon Dynamite"" (2004) is its title. By the title alone I expected the movie and its main character to be charismatic and brave as Napoleon I and explosive as dynamite or at least, unpredictable, fresh, and original. Guess what, it is none of the above. First and foremost, the movie is so boring, slow, and non-interesting that I could hardly manage to sit through it. Yes, I've read the comments that Napoleon, and his two equally sleep-walking friends, Pedro, the most impossible candidate for school president and Deb, the girl we should believe Napoleon might have a crush on  and few more high school clich characters are exactly like the regular students in a regular high school. Even if it is true and I hope that it is not always the case, I don't have to sympathize with the trio of walking zombies. ND and his friends are so bored and boring that their boredom becomes contagious - for me it was. I did not find anyone on the screen slightly interesting, leave alone sympathetic. Well, there was one exception, Napoleon's and his older brother Kip's, 32 years old Internet chat rooms addict's  grandmother who was injured in a dune buggy accident (that sounded interesting or at least promising) and taken from the screen after the first fifteen minutes. She was lucky - she did not have to endure the presence of her complete idiot-nephew Rico, the ex-jock of the 1982, a door-to-door salesman, whose adventures or projects did not contribute a single funny scene or even a joke to this sophomoric excuse for a movie.

While trying not to fall asleep, I was thinking of the others, more successful and much better first movies that might have been the inspiration for ND. Wes Anderson's debut, ""Bottle Rocket"" (1996) even if not a masterpiece is often hilarious and always original. Todd Solondz's first feature which explores the similar subject, ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" (1995) is a terrific film - brave, and passionate - real dynamite.

The teens and the adults have a couple of things in common: they are nerds and weird people and they are ALL hilarious. They also are unlike a cast of characters you have seen in any other movie. In other words, this movie is an ""original.""

I didn't know any of these actors and I think that helped. It made it even more original, looking at new faces. That begins with the title character, played by Jon Heder. A white kid in Idaho with a afro haircut, over-sized glasses, moon boots and an unpredictable and low-key personality unlike anyone I've ever seen in other films. Even though he's pictured as a huge nerd, he surprises you all the time. Just when you think you have this kid figured out, he does something unexpected. Whatever, he's fun to watch and hear throughout the movie.

Suffice to say ""Napoleon"" and about everyone in this film is totally whacked and all of them - male, female, young, old, good and bad people are extremely entertaining. A lot of the humor is visual, meaning the looks and reactions on these character's faces and the weird deadpan lines they deliver. Are there stereotypes in here? Yes, like the bimbo, prettiest girl in school running for class president , and her stupid, macho boyfriend, but most of the people were pretty unique.

There is a twist. This is probably one of the top five cliched plots in filmwriting school. However, it is worth seeing because of the original characters. Napoleon is the nerds nerd. He dozes through life not so much angst ridden as suffused with ennui. He accepts his lowly status - his lack of 'skills', the regular locker slammings, his rediculous family (such as his older, charisma free brother Chip who chats up 'babes' on the internet) and his lack of friends. His relations with girls are comically stilted 'I like your sleeves'. 'Thanks, I made them myself'. Eventually he finds salvation through his only two friends - monosyllabic Mexican Pedro, who is up against popular and pretty Summer for class president, and the erstwhile Debs, who is the classic beautiful ugly girl, if you catch my drift. The setting is also superbly quirky - dry, stifling rural Idaho complete with red barns and hick farmers who pay a dollar an hour for chicken relocation and reward their workers with raw egg shakes.

The ending is predictable, in the 'School of Rock' mode, though do stay on after the credits for the 'real', hidden ending - I won't reveal, but it's the best scene of the movie!",1175731200,3,1393,4.780082987551867

As a light-hearted comedy it follows the travails of the frustrated, gangly, unseemly, and misanthropic high schooler, Napoleon, along with his circle of similarly weirdo and disenfranchised characters that surround him--his brother Kip who specializes in chat rooms, Pedro the improbable class president, Uncle Rio a door-to-door salesman, and his heart throb Deb. Napoleon is hazed at school, envies Pedro's mustache, lies about having a gorgeous girl friend, and musters his best compliment to Deb at the dance: ""I like your sleeves; they're big.""

1552909,5,B00005JNBQ,"""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a film by Jared Hess and stars Jon Heder. It's an independent film, more or less, featuring quirky characters, but unlike so many other independent films in this vein, it's not depressing or malicious. It's a lighthearted comedy with heart and personality, and a very quotable one at that. I don't remember it coming out in theatres here in Australia (I first heard about it here on amazon), but it has gone on to be a big hit on DVD. I've even seen a ""Vote For Pedro"" t-shirt or two being worn up in the city.

Napoleon Dynamite lives in an American country town. He loves to draw mythical beasts, dreams of numchucks and bo skills, plays tetherball, feeds his aunt's llama every day and doesn't have many friends. After going to a self defense course with his brother Kip, he is told that he has to have someone to watch his back. Fortunately, there's a new kid at school, a Mexican immigrant called Pedro. There's also Deb, a girl who left a whole box of merchandise she was selling on his doorstep for college money. The school dance is coming up, so is the school election, and Napoleon's uncle Rico is in town, a man who is stuck in 1982, in his glory days as a footballer. Also on the calendar is a meeting between Kip and La Fawnduh, his internet girlfriend. Do Napoleon, his family and friends have the skills to get through the year?

The film has a tacky, domestic kind of setting, and in that way it reminds me a bit of the Australian TV series ""Kath and Kim"", though that show doesn't feel quite as detatched and awkward as this film does. It's a good detatched and awkward though, it goes with and adds to the characters I think. They're all a bit out of the ordinary, but there's a kind of sense to what they're doing. Some of the fun I had watching this was trying to figure out what the characters were thinking and how they really felt about each other (Napoleon and Deb's friendship, for instance). Being set in Jared Hess' home town helped a bit, I think. He would have known where to go, what backdrops he wanted against the plot.

I could relate to a few of the characters in this film. I don't know anyone exactly like Napoleon, but I know a few people who have a few ""Napoleon"" elements. I know back in high school I used to draw pictures of weird creatures, and of girls in my class (though I never sent pictures to the girls like Napoleon did). I knew people who were way into the self-defense stuff, and one or two people who have Napoleon's way of replying. Maybe there's a bit of Napoleon (or Kip or Deb or Pedro) in a lot of people.

Special features on the regular edition include a making of the after-credits scene, and an audio commentary with Jared Hess and Jon Heder, recalling anecdotes and influences for the film. A lot of it is actually from Jared's life, it seems.

Definitely worth a look if you're interested.",1163635200,,2875,4.406779661016949
1552910,5,B00005JNBQ,"It seems that ""Napoleon Dynamite"" has a very pronounced polarizing effect on viewers--you either love it or hate it. In my opinion, a film that can elicit such strong responses in an audience (for better or for worse) is worth its salt. Any movie can lull an audience into feeling a predetermined emotion, be it patriotic fervor, paranoia, lust, or nostalgia, and sometimes these movies can be very well done (but often they're two-dimensional cookie-cutter affairs). However, Napoleon Dynamite is one of a tiny group of films that remain emotionally open-ended. Reviewers condemn its ""lack of plot"" and bland texture, but it is only plotless and bland in the sense that you have to do a little thinking and connecting with your own life and experience to appreciate it. And maybe you won't. Maybe it hits a little too close to home, and you'd rather reject it. Maybe Ebert was right (in a sense), and you'll either pity Napoleon or, as several reviewers have proclaimed, want to beat the stuffing out of him (these people are called bullies, and one of them features prominently in the film).

Suffice it to say, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is nuanced. It requires patience and understanding and empathy--there are no explosions or conspiracy theories or crude jokes. It reminded me of Wes Anderson's movies (""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" ""Rushmore,"" ""The Life Aquatic""), especially the polarized audience effect. Watch it for the subtle details, the facial expressions, the pauses for effect. Napoleon, Pedro, Deb, and Kip are average Americans--they are like you and me--we all have quirks, shortcomings, a certain level of geekiness (try as we might to cover it up or pretend otherwise; let's admit it, we're on here reviewing movies). So if you can see the humor in everyday life and laugh at yourself, you'll enjoy ""Napoleon Dynamite.""",1163462400,,1827,5.049668874172186
1552911,5,B00005JNBQ,"Wow! I had no idea that people could be so close-minded and prejudiced--and about a movie for crying out loud! I mean people on here are saying that they would never date a person just because he/she liked this movie. And this from a reviewer who called this movie racist--talk about hypocrite!

Quite frankly, I thought this movie was hilarious. The acting is supposed to be life-less. The movie is supposed to be uneventful. But if you pay attention to the nuances, the slight glances, you might understand a bit more. For instance, when Napoleon is carrying the chickens to their new cages and he puts them in, he does so with the utmost care and then, he looks around at the chaos and filth that these chickens are forced to live and runs from the coop at top speed. For all the dirt and aggravation of working on the chicken farm he gets paid $1 an hour. Now who can't think of other people in our country who have to deal with that in a real-life scenario?

I am not going to get philosophical about the themes of this movie because in my opinion you either get this movie or you don't, either you are a literal or figurative thinker, either you can enjoy things that have a circular pattern or you are more linear. The point is you don't HAVE to like this movie. No one is forcing you to jump up and down with glee! You also don't need to be so spiteful to those of us who do like it. Liking this movie does not mean I don't like other more classic/mainstream comedies. Young Frankenstein, The Birdcage, The Producers, The Wedding Singer etc are all great movies and great comedies.

1552913,5,B00005JNBQ,"I have absolutely no idea how to properly describe this movie. I just know that I had to buy it b/c I rented it so often.

Napolean is such a loser. His brother Kip could have a huge ""L"" on his own forehead.

They have a pet llama named Tina and feed her casserole. Both young men live with Grandma, who broke her pelvis riding a 4-wheeler. So, Uncle Ricco moves in with the boys. He turns out to irritate Napolean and go in business with Kip.

In the end, they all win, despite being awkward outcasts. Kip is especially transformed and finds love with a surprising woman.

The quotes taken from this film are numerous! If for no other reason, rent or buy this movie to watch Napolean dance. There is a lengthy scene of his disco moves. Smooooth.

And as Kip told a poor girl ""friend"" of Napolean's when she said she was selling homemade keychains to get herself through college, ""Your mom goes to college..."" Kip thought that was SUCH a good come back. I, as the viewer, felt sorry for his nerdy, ill-dressed character.

* Especially like Napolean's friend, Pedro. Who shaves his head b/c he was hot - then buys a wig to cover his bald head. Why would have his head b/c he is hot? Isn't a wig hotter? *

1552914,5,B00005JNBQ,"Oh my! How we judge! I like roses - you like daisies...but does that automatically make me superior to you, more intelligent than you, a whiz with proper punctuation (obviously not!)?

I do not believe the trick to appreciating these movies is about ""getting it"". Everyone approaches life AND movies from a different perspective.  Liking or disliking a movie should not be a litmus test for someone's I.Q. I will assume that those who didn't like this movie (and GOD FORBID actually slandered ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"") have reasonable I.Q.'s.  No matter how tempting it is to think otherwise.  All deserve the benefit of the doubt.

As an aside, however, I must protest the application of the word ""retarded"" that was used in one review.  I find the word offensive and respectfully ask that people would refrain from using it in public forums such as these, regardless of the context intended.  It is not a nice word in this day and age to use to describe any thing or any one. Please choose another word from your vocabulary to express yourself, if you would. But I digress.

There is a crowd that will love Monty Python, Best in Show, Spinal Tap, etc. and there are those that will watch these types of movies in a more literal sense, and be unable, for whatever reason, to see the humor in them at all.  To me, that is ok.  Not everyone has to like everything that everybody else does.  The difference here is that some of the ""reviewers"" seem to be steadfast in the idea that if a movie does or does not measure up to their own personal criteria for humor, then the opposing side, by default, MUST be stupid, or wrong, or humorless.  Can we not even practice tolerance for other people's senses of humor?

To me, this kind of humor, as in the other movies mentioned above and scores more like them, is priceless. To others, worthless.  To me, these types of movies, including Napoleon Dynamite, share a theme in that the humor in them is deftly wound around scenes and dialogue that must, in a way, be ""decoded"" in order for one to appreciate the hidden layers of humor hiding beneath the surface. If it is ""about"" anything it is about not taking oneself too seriously, which ever of these films you are watching.

You and you and you -  don't have to like them.  I think they are brilliant.  I say tomato you say toMAtoe....so what????

1552916,5,B00005JNBQ,"...I'm so sorry!  I loved it.  I have to admit, the first five to ten minutes had me thinking, ""What the heck is going on?""  And it took me a while to catch the ""feeling"" of the movie.  It's not really like any other movie I've seen, really.  It kind of jumps from one thing to another without transitions, so I guess some film afficionados could fault it for its uneven, disjointed feel.  Or Pedro's odd, unexplained absences from school, or why he felt so hot when no one else did, and went home to cool off (like that would make a difference).  Why???  But I think it was its total departure from the typical film style that actually drew me in...more like life, a series of unconnected events that eventually lead to something interesting.

True, a lot of its appeal is the fact that people can laugh at its characters' foibles, but if a person is truly honest, they'll have to admit that at some level they relate to him when he does dumb things.  Like hitting on a girl by saying the following line (sure to make you swoon!):

""I see you're drinking 1%.  Is that 'cuz you think you're fat?...(long pause here)....'Cuz you're not.  You could totally drink whole if you wanted to.""

Bring out the smelling salts, baby!  Think I'm gonna faint!  What a sauve character.

There have been many, many ""nerd"" movies, and I don't think most of them ""get it"" when it comes to the real thing.  There's always some kind of magical transformation that says, ""Gee, this person wasn't so nerdy after all"" or some kind of vindication of their great intellect, or something.  At the end of this one, although he is applauded, let's face it, Napoleon is still about the nerdiest guy you'll ever meet.  And, um, sorry, but there's no great intellectual prowess to be had, either.  Even taming a wild honeymoon stallion isn't quite enough to get Napoleon out of nerd-dom, and no amount of ""bling,"" even by his beloved Lafawn""duh"" (as he spells it!) is enough to enable Napoleon's brother Kip to actually be hip when he sings to her.

Okay, so it's a weird movie, full of weird people.  But I have to say, I have met plenty of Uncle Ricos, Kips, Napoleons, and even people like his grandma.  And I lived in a house with 1970's shag carpet, dark wood paneling, and gold foil wallpaper with olive and orange flowers on it.  So yeah, I guess you could say that I was a nerd who didn't ""get it,"" just like Napoleon.

It's not for everyone, but for what it's worth, I loved it.  There's no sex in it other than suggestiveness, and the worst language in it is an improvised, ""I'd be p----- off, too,"" in a quiet conversation.  The people who say they want the 90 minutes of their life back after this movie may not have seen ""American Psycho.""  Now that'a a film which I believe actually warrants saying, it's REALLY not worth seeing!

This is a wonderful movie to watch with friends.  It is funny, and despite the moments (long, long moments) when nothing seems to happen, the timing is impeccable.  If you don't *really* have a funny bone in your body, don't watch this.  (If all you get is put-down humor, stay away.  Seriously.)

Plot Summary.  Napoleon Dynamite is an awkward young man; a skateboard dude who hasn't actually discovered a skateboard.  He is continually bullied by the cool kids in his school, but manages to keep up a level of defiance (a little whiny, though), and somehow you sense that this fellow is not one who needs the endorsement of his peers.  Still, he continues to reach out to an amazing degree; a dude who does not accept that he has been branded a loser.

In his awkward fashion, he befriends a Latino kid, and a slightly eccentric girl.  Despite the cartoon-like style of these two characters, they manage to be quite 3-dimensional in their own way.  Other important people are Napoleon's brother (Kyle?); his uncle, an aging football player wannabe; Tina, a Llama (totally cute), and (last but not least) LaFawndah, a girl Kyle meets on the internet.  There's also Summer what'sername's mother, an indealistic midwestern woman who encourages her daughter to accept Napoleon's invitation to a school dance.

As you will see, none of the 'stereotypes' in the movie are what one expects them to be, exactly.  And when Deb (the girl who turns up on Napoleon's doorstep, selling discount photo portraits) realizes, to her alarm, that a customer is hitting on her, she responds with the kind of grave reproach that is an example to us all!  Oh Deb, what a girl!  And Pedro (who runs for President of the class) has more than meets the eye --perhaps not much more, but still more.  The obnoxious popular kids --cheerleaders and football players, etc-- are not as obnoxious as they could be.  I can honestly say that this movie shows obnoxious wannabees how to be moderately obnoxious.  Moderation in all things is a worthy goal.

Yes, all the characters are cartoons.  The movie is sort of a parable, and parables do deal with cartoons.  Still, they're cartoons with a lot of depth.  A lot.

Quoteable up one wall and down the other, this film is painfully real at the dance.  SO well shot, looking over the shoulders of Napoleon, Deb and Pedro as they watch the popular crowd enjoy the frivolity of their youth while these 3 trudge through their days.

However, Napoleon refuses to give up the fight and makes a stand for Pedro and makes his dreams come true.",1157068800,4,563,4.41747572815534

I was serving as a missionary for my church, at which time I didn't watch any TV or movies or even listen to much music. I heard a little bit about Napoleon Dynamite, and alot of people were quoting it(""IDIOTS""). All I saw was a formula for disaster. Everyone said there was no plot and that there were alot of inside jokes. All of the 10-15 yr old crowd seemed highly entertained while most of their parents did not. So when I got home (which was after the lunacy), I hesitated, even rejected invitations to watch it. Then one day, at Blockbuster, my dad convinced me to watch it. Honestly, I loved it.

The main character, Napoleon does seem like a totally socially inept nerd. But somewhere deep inside this kid has a SOUL He longs to connect. He's not a bad person. He's trying to rise above the swamp that his life is, and to some small extent, succeeds. His romantic interest, Deb, seems a little inept herself, but she has a degree of quiet charm about her, and she is trying to make a life for herself. All the main characters are struggling for a little bit of happiness, and to some extent succeed, even Grandma who has a boyfriend and rides ATV's.

The ending is a vaguely happy one, and if these losers can grab a little joy in life, well hell, so can the rest of us.

Animals are treated cruelly in a gratuitous attempt to make humor out of nothing amusing.

When I think of yucky films that work anyway, ones amused and entertained me, I think of John Waters' ""Pink Flamingoes"" & ""Female Troubles"" and Pedro Almadovar's ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" & ""Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down.""

1553069,5,B00005JNBQ,"This unique movie depicts everyday lives of mostly teenage characters in the small town set in the middle of nowhere. The individuals presented to us are hopelessly handicapped by the limits of their small town's life  - however this is not a movie with deeper meaning in mind, this is movie for laughs. The characters are carefully selected and well portrayed, situations and dialogs flawlessly written without a blank spot, superfluous scenes or empty dialogs. There is not too much of a plot because nothing ever happens in here - the main events are concentrated around the teenage dating attempts, who to take to the big dance, and the class president election at the local high school.

This movie offers intelligent humor in it's best; most big production releases with it's toilet type jokes can't even distantly touch what writers of Napoleon Dynamite were able to do here with minimum budget and little known cast. It appears that people who rate this movie so poorly are divided into two main groups; those who are not able to find any meaningful plot and so they condemn it, and those who seem to judge it way too quickly - and then throw it together into the same bin with Beavis & Butthead type humor - because the teenage characters and small town similarity... these two things are the only common points.

This title is worth your attention and time; my wife and I watched the movie quite a few times and so far we didn't get bored - it is funny & sweet at the same time; hopefully you'll be able to find your way to like Napoleon, Pedro, Deb and others for exactly what they are, and accept their strengths and weaknesses.",1155254400,4,1640,4.628865979381444

He wants to become class president and runs against Halie Duff's character, Summer.  Napolean saves the day when after giving your election speech, it needs to be followed by a skit of some kind, so Napolean dances to Canned Heat and is so funny.

Napoleon Dynamite, from Idaho, is possibly the goofiest character of all time, and not just because he's from Idaho.  The ginger kid afro, the incredibly stupid mouth-open grin, and the ridiculous clothing all make for a character at which I can't stop laughing.  ""Gosh!""

Pedro is the perfect sidekick, barely there, barely audible, and barely normal.  Shaving his head, running for class president, baking cakes, and blasting pi&ntilde;atas, he's a hilarious mockery of many English as a second language immigrants.  ""It's a sledge hammer.""

The other major characters (Deb, Uncle Rico, Skip, and even Summer) are perfect casting choices.  Deb is borderline retarded, and probably a little agoraphobic.  Uncle Rico is living the old days of high school, and he's beyond pathetic.  Skip is the biggest loser alive, with lame poetry, 4-hour chat sessions, and an internet ""girlfriend"".  Summer is perfect as the most popular girl in school who runs for class president because it's almost a guarantee that she'll win.

Overall it's a great movie that will have you quoting lines in numerous situations on a daily basis.  Whether it's the steak throwing scene (that puts me in tears every time I see it) or the on-going obsession with self defense/cage fighting, you'll soon find yourself talking with friends about your favorite scenes.

John Heder in his first performance in a leading role, or really any role period ... shows that he knows exactly what he is doing and should be looked at as one of the new elite comical actors.

The no budget film ""Napolean Dynamite"", honestly doesnt really even have much of a point to it, and if it does than it can pretty much be summed up in three words ... ""VOTE FOR PEDRO"". If you want to watch a comedy that stars an actor like Adam Sandler and has a big budget, than you will most likely be dissapointed because this movie is not meant to be like that ... at all. A low budget movie is a completely different kind of film altogether, A low budget comedy has to have it's laughs 99% from dialouge usually a subtle type of comedy. Napolean Dynamite's Dialouge is outragously sad yet completely comical. The people, plot and setting are all very different but all well thought out and purposely pitiful.

After seeing this film I was hoping for many more of it's kind. In June the Director of this film released his second film ""Nacho Libre"", though it had pretty good numbers in the box office, overall the film tried to be like ""Dynamite"" and pretty much ... failed. Though it had a few laughs the movie was not very good. I think that ""Napolean Dynamite"" is a one of a kind, unique and great comedy that people will remember, love, laugh and talk about for many years to come...

The open-ended one sentence summary: A stupid nerd who lives in Idaho deals with his weird everyday life.

Content Inappropriate for All Ages: Some mild bad language, some bullying, and couple light innuendos.

Characters: 3 of 5 stars. This movie was not a marvel of acting, and I wouldn't go so far as to call the characters loveable, but they were all very memorable. You'll probably just laugh and/or think they're stupid.

Plot: 2.5 of 5 stars. No plot whatsoever. Just everyday escapades and quoteable lines in Napoleon Dynamite's life. It managed to keep my attention, though. I even asked ""Why are we interested in this?"" as we were watching, then continued being interested.

Cinematography: 5 of 5 stars. The high rating is due to the excellent scenery/props/locations. The movie is set in a run-down, rural Idaho, and is complete with 70's shag carpets, ketchup stains, unmown lawns, and quiet flea-market type stores.

Music: 4 of 5 stars. Perfect for the movie. It's that same kind of retro-tacky instrumental music that goes so well with the retro-tacky surroundings.

Impact: 4 of 5 stars. It's a flippin' cult hit, what do ya think? You'll either love it or hate it, and I loved it. The biggest impact is the insanely quoteable lines. PS: watch till after the credits.

The acting is lifeless.  Some have found that funny but not me.  It scares & saddens me to think that Hollywood can put out this pathetic drool & people actually love it.  There is very little plot & you never develop a caring for any of the characters.  I laughed once through the whole movie.  That is a waste of 90 minutes. (180 really - read below)

But I will gladly spend five minutes to hopefully prevent you from buying this film.  I just saw 'Nacho Libre' it was done by the same producers & it too was AWEFUL .  Must be some bad stuff goin round Hollyweird these days because their idea of a comedy has really taken a nosedive with this movie being the biggest crash of them all.

The lead character has no depth of emotion.  And the other characters in the movie are but sideshows for the giant dork.  I know when I date one of my first questions will be how she liked this film. If she liked it even a little I will be heading down the road. I cannot grasp the kind of mind that finds this dribble funny.

Bored out of my mind & stupified from watching this movie twice (as recommended is some ealier reviews) got me to thinking about some reviews comparing this movie to 'Welcome to the Dollhouse'.  NOT even close.  That was a FAR FAR superior movie.

Again I URGE you to rent this movie first.  If you like it, buy it.  If you HATE it like I did thank me in your prayers this evening.  If this is what 60 % of out country finds amusing I am truly concerned for our future as a society.

1553245,4,B00005JNBQ,"This movie is disconcerting because it approaches within a hair's breadth the classic heights of movies like ""Rushmore"" and ""Harold and Maude"" but falls short because it ends too soon.  There is never any final resolution, epiphany, or turning point.  It ends just as you've decided that you love the characters and really care about what happens to them. When the movie ends you find yourself asking: what happens next?  Who wins?  And about a dozen other questions that beg to be answered.

The characters are indeed novel and hilarious.  The dead-pan humor is almost painful to watch it is so funny.  The performances are great by all involved.  My favorite was ""Kip""--Napolean's 32-year-old brother, but I was super intrigued by Kip's beautiful black girlfriend who he met on a web chatroom.  I wanted to learn a whole lot more about her, she is a very intriguing character. She definitely has bad taste in men, because Kip is about the biggest loser to ever walk the planet!  Uncle Rico was a classic with his football fantasies and sales schemes. So was Granny, who we basically only saw two times, the last time flying off her ATV.

Napolean is a fascinating character.  He is different from most nerds: he is comfortable with who he is; one might even say he is brazenly confident.  I like that, he is a truly unique individual.  His little dance in front of classmates took a lot of...confidence, and I think that's why the kids cheered. My favorite scenes, however, were when Napolean is feeding his llama.  That was very amusing.

Unfortunately, the plot never quite went full circle.  I was waiting for the climax, which was never forthcoming.  But this movie, when all is said and done, is a must-see.  It is an almost-classic.  It is a bittersweet movie, because it approaches the realm of the great, and just misses it. It reminds you how quirky people can be, and how even odd-balls can be likeable.  And, it shows you that even if you are an oddball, you have nothing to apologize for, because oddballs can be good people and have lots of fun as well.",1151625600,4,2068,4.673130193905817

You care about the main characters even uncle Rico in the end. The main themes in the movie are alienation and diversity. The movie is completely clean and its success is attributed to its unforgetable characters. The last scene where Napoleon tells Deb ""I caught you a delicious bass"" will be remembered as one of the most romantic moments on film.

The film is made and acted by mostly Brigham Young University (Mormon) film school graduates. This explains why it is so clean. I am also Mormon and the movie is very much an inside joke about Mormons living in the small towns along the Idaho and Utah border. Napoleon wears a yellow t-shirt in the movie that says Ricks College which is an Idaho Mormon college. Napoleon says things like Gosh! and Flippin! instead of cursing and that is typically Mormon and makes me laugh because it is dead on.

Why it took me so long to get on the Napoleon train, I have no idea. But it's now officially over. I have been Napoleoned, and there is no going back. Now I join everyone else, proud of my wisdom in all things Napoleon. It's good to be a member of the club. The film itself?. All I have got to say is that the writer and director of the movie must of been nerds in high school, or at least knew someone who was. Their depiction of Napoleon, and High School in general, is so specific and spot on, that it must of come from both of their lives. That's how good this movie is. Jon Heder plays Napoleon, the biggest geek you ever saw, who lives with his grandmother and older brother Kip(who I swear plays Weigel's serial killer boyfriend on ""Reno 911""). They live in some no name, bodunk Idaho town, that's just as forgettable as the people who live in it. The look of the movie is worth noting as well. The people in the movie are plain, and their environments accompany them. The movie is shot well to go with the people. Whoever scouted this location for the film has a nice eye. But what is the movie really about?. Not sure. There's not so much of a plot going here, just an observance of life. A peek into the life of this nerdy high schooler and the people who populate his existence. But Napoleon does have some missions. Get his new friend, Pedro, elected as class president, and to get a date to the prom. The boys' uncle(played by Jon Gries, wig and all)comes to look over them too. Tina Majorino also appears as the girl who likes Napoleon, and he likewise. She was so real and believeable in her role. The acting and characterizations are done to a T. The movie and people are so real, that you expect to drive to this Idaho town and really find them. That's good praise to the writing and acting of this film. Heder is a marvel. Where did he come from?. He's amazing. He brings this character to life in a way I have never seen a character, nerd or otherwise, achieve. The movie may not be for everyone's taste, but it is worth checking out and sticking it out to the end for. There are so many good scenes, and this has to be the most quoteable movie to come along in a very long time. The film's humor is sometimes odd, sometimes subtle, but always very funny. I am catching new things I didn't notice the first time I saw it. No doubt about it, Napoleon Dynamite is like no other. It's charm, characters, and way of life, is all it's own.

Napoleon is the perennial loser, an unpopular kid in a small (and sometimes backward) town where nothing ever seems to happen.  This is what makes him such a compelling hero-he's the antithesis of the hard-bodied, perfect smiling hunk from the Hollywood cookie-cutter factory that we're constantly expected to relate to

The biggest complaint I've heard of this movie is that nothing happens.  This is absolutely true-nothing really happens through the course of the film.  There's not much action, nothing blows up, there is no outrageous crime or anything like that.  What there IS is a heartwarming story about a smalltown kid trying to make a small difference in his smalltown world.  The characters are hilarious and very well rounded, and the movie is incredibly funny by simple virtue of its simplicity.  Go into this movie with no expectations and you'll be very pleasantly surprised-go in expecting drama or action and you'll probably be disappointed.",1150070400,2,1230,5.044554455445544

1553317,3,B00005JNBQ,"Napoleon Dynamite is one weird film.  You will find yourself laughing hysterically at times and completely bored at others.  There is no real plot to the film other than Napoleon's (Jon Heder) efforts to get his friend Pedro (Efren Ramirez) elected class president.  Napoleon lives with grandmother and his effeminate brother Kip (Aaron Ruell).  After grandma is hurt riding in the dunes, Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) comes to watch after the boys even though Kip is 32.  While Napoleon is an outcast with no friends, Uncle Rico is the saddest character in the film.  He is desperately trying to recapture his glory days and even goes so far to buy a time machine that will take him back to 1982.  What saves this film from being a total bore is the immensely likable cast.  Mr. Heder is great in the title and everyone else makes their characters quirky but fun.",1149552000,,857,4.666666666666667
1553318,5,B00005JNBQ,"I'll start out the review with being blunt: This movie doesn't really have much of a plot. At the beginning it feels like a bunch of scenes of hilarity strung together ( Including Rex Kwon Do ) but once Napoleon meets Pedro and Uncle Rico comes, things begin to progress.

Small laughs and moments make this movie funny. You may not be falling out of you chair but you will have a smile on your face during this movie from Uncle Rico throwing a steak at Napoleon's head or Kip ( Napoleon's brother ) going ""gangsta"". This movie uses its free spirited design to bring the sometimes humilty and sometimes dullness of Napoleon's life to the viewer.

Overall- I guess I can see how some people would be turned away by this movie. Try watching it at home with your family and see if you enjoy  it better. You may find yourself laughing at the subtle hilarity of this movie and enjoying all the great qualities of it.",1149465600,3,911,4.410714285714286
1553319,5,B00005JNBQ,"This is probably one of the best comedies to come out in recent years. It isn't your conventional comedy though. Most of the characters in the movie are extremely strange and are social outcasts. The humor is mostly deadpan instead of charasmatic and wacky. It is probably the most popular among teens even though most teens probably don't relate with Napoleon or anyone else in the movie. It's a very different kind of movie which probably helps contribute to its popularity.

The movie really doesn't have a story. It's basically just about Napoleons everyday life. Napoleon Dynamite is an outcast. Most nerds usually have other nerdy friends but Napoleon doesn't even have those until a new Hispanic student named Pedro arrives. He also becomes friends with a girl named Deb. His life becomes even more miserable with the arrival of his Uncle Rico who constantly screws up things for Napoleon. He stays with Napoleon and his thirtysomething year old brother Kip while their grandma recovers from and accident at the sand dunes.

Napoleon Dynamite is played by Jon Heder, who turns in one the best comedic performances of all time. He makes Napoleon depressed, nerdy and very unlikable. Hes not the kind of person you would wanna hang out with but somehow you root for him throughout the movie. There is something appealing about him thats hard to put a finger on. Hes a unique, memorable, and very quotable character that's not easy to forget.

Aaron Ruell plays Napoleons even nerdier brother Kip. He's not as relaxed as Napoleon and he spends all day chating online with his internet girlfriend when hes not helping Uncle Rico sell tupperware. Efren Ramirez plays Pedro. He always has a blank look on his face and is even more out of it than Napoleon. Jon Gries plays Uncle Rico. Hes probably the most annoying character in the movie. Hes constantly looking for ways to make money and wishes he could relive his college football days. Tina Majorino plays Deb, Napoleon's potential girlfriend. She looks nerdy in the movie but is actually very cute in real life. All in all the whole cast does excellent work making the characters what they need to be for the movie to work.

There is nothing really offensive in the movie to it's probably ok to let your kids see it.

It's a unique movie that, like Napoleon himself, you won't soon forget.",1148947200,4,2344,4.792079207920792

The first time I saw it, I didn't laugh all that much either, but I found myself quoting lines from it and telling people about it.  The humour grew on me bit by bit.

The second time I watched it, I picked up on subtle elements (yes, it has those) that I hadn't seen the first time.  And I enjoyed it even more.

If you do watch it - definitely check out the special features.

Turn the commentary on, and learn the backstory behind the film and the process of writing and filming it.  Jon Heder and Jared Hess both have interesting things to say about the project, and recount stories from their lives which tie in with scenes in the film.

Also, when you realise that half the people in the movie were local towns folk, it gives it an extra dimension.

The teachers are played by real teachers from the school.  The school cafeteria in the movie is real, and apparently makes a decent chili.

The houses are real, inside and out. And just about every scene has a story behind it and features at least one of the seemingly endless number of brothers of the crew.

I was surprised at how many real life residents of Preston they used - they've done a brilliant job and delivered very believable performances.

I particularly loved that every person in the film got a credit - even the kids in the auditorium scene :)

The humor in the movie is very dry - and that's an understatement.  Napoleon is the ""class geek"" that all of us remember from high school.  So far so good, but the film simply didn't do anything for me.  In a word, I found it lame.

I literally nearly fell asleep during this movie - it was that dull for me.  By about 1/4 way through it I could not wait for it to end.  I stuck it out as I kept expecting it to get better and become funny.  It never did.

1553427,4,B00005JNBQ,"This is a more ""realistic"" High School Nerd movie - realistic in that Napoleon isn't a particularly stylized nerd.  His clothing is unique, perhaps, but there are tons of adolescent guys who draw fantasy creatures, sulk, never appear to pay attention, act awkwardly with girls, and/or never quite clue into the intricacies of social interaction.

For those viewers who enjoy plot-driven action movies: this is not the film for you.  It essentially has no plot and is, rather, a series of vignettes and sight gags about a high school boy whose small-town life in Idaho is both mundane and bizarrly embarrassing.  As the commentary states, most of these vignettes are based on people and things that actually happened to the actors/writers/directors, as hard as that is to believe (i.e., the time machine bit).

Napoleon Dynamite is filmed almost in documentary style, which lends a certain wry, understated quality to the many, many sight gags the viewer is treated to.  The movie parodies the absurdity of people and life, but much more intelligently than most other comedies.  This is not Dumb and Dumber.

While watching this movie, I continually asked my husband, ""What the heck is this about?""  Napoleon Dynamite is original filmmaking and rather difficult to describe or even, sometimes, comprehend.  But it is funny and it is well done.  And the explanations the writers/directors/actors give in the commentary add a level of humor to the whole experience as well.

All of my friends had seen it and almost all of them LOVED it, said it was one of the funniest movies they'd ever seen.  Granted, this was before Wedding Crashers came out, but still.

I didn't like it, but that's my personal opinion.
I understand why so many liked it, I think it's a sort of catharsis, which is why people responded to it, even I responded to the character of Napoleon Dynamite.
I admit, I found two scenes hilarious : when he tries to make a jump with the bike, and when he feeds Tina the Llama, which in my opinion is THE BEST character in the movie.

Otherwise, I found it a tad dry, and actually a little offensive.
Watching this movie is like watching a couple of weeks in the life of a high schooler on acid who feeds his llama tuna casserole, which while I agree that some of the humor is subtle, I didn't find it very funny.
Or another view of the movie is that it's poking fun at mentally retarded kids with low IQ's, which is what Napoleon Dynamite pretty much embodies, which I find somewhat offensive, although i'm probably going a little to the extreme here.

Personally, it's not a movie I enjoyed or would recommend, but it is light and if you have nothing else to do, why not?",1144713600,12,1263,4.294117647058823

This is a movie of subtleties, folks. I watched it twice before I laughed at certain parts (usually those involving Uncle Rico, Deb or Kip, not Napoleon). In my opinion, it's not the laugh out loud type of film that some promote it to be. It's more of a human observation film.

The casting was perfect. The acting was skillful, especially when you watch the physical ineptitude of Kip and Napoleon.

I don't think we were supposed to love Napoleon's dismissive, damaged demeanor. Ultra shy Deb barely talks, and then talks with her mouth full. Uncle Rico is lost to a fading dream. Kip can be sadistic (review the 'time machine' sequence - he knew what was going to happen). These aren't cutesy characters you are going to warm to right away.

But the go back and look at Napoleon when he gets stood up at the dance. There's no blatant show of disappointment, but you can tell the guy is hurt.

Nobody tells Napoleon or Pedro that a skit is expected after Pedro's speech. Almost everyone wants Pedro to lose. Like a true friend, Napoleon steps in and helps Pedro out - he 'has his back'.

When Napoleon watches Kip carrying Lafawnduh's luggage onto the bus, he even manages his only smile in the movie.

Napoleon (John Heder) is a high school loser. Napoleon's brother spends most his hours looking for dates on the internet and his uncle, who is temporarily ""babysitting"" them, is mentally stuck in the year 1982, when he was a high school (or was it college) football star.

Napoleon befriends a new student from Mexico, Pedro, and helps him campaign for student body president.  All the while he tries to build up the courage to ask one of his female classmates to the prom.

Basically the movie follows this kid (Napoleon) through a monotony of high school and family situations. Napoleon responds to these situations as if in a drug induced stupor. In this film his loser character/attitude prevails when faced with conflict; hence, his state of stupor is glorified to heroism which is probably why a few teens and young adults think that it's cool to mimic Napoleon's character.

1553535,4,B00005JNBQ,"*Napoleon Dynamite* gives the impression of plotlessness. Don't be fooled. The languid spiritlessness of the acting is a trick -- a kind of brilliant filmic *trompe l'oeils*. Underneath it all, the movie has the tremendous energy suggested by its title character's name.

Even on a kind of literal level, really a lot is happening on screen: Young Napoleon's grandma breaks her coccyx, leaving Napoleon and his dysfunctional older brother Kip under the care of their even more dysfunctional Uncle Rico, who is so desperate to re-enact (with a different ending) an ill-fated football match from his own high school days that he purchases a time machine over the internet. Napoleon makes a new friend at school (the remarkably charming Pedro, played by Efren Ramirez), whose plans to run for school president are disrupted by a hot flash that causes him to shave his head.

That's just the beginning, but it serves to make the point. The pace of the movie never flags, which increases the pleasure of watching it. While the time machine, of course (and quite amusingly), fails to work, the movie does instruct us in the possibilities of happy endings. And that's all I'm going to say about that.

But the real pleasure, of course, comes from the hilarious disconnect between the affect of the actors and the situations in which they find themselves. Visually, the sense of disassociation is an aspect of the relentlessly ordinary and dry landscape and architecture; scenes are short and sometimes purposely confusing until later explanations emerge. Overall, the film's disciplined disengagement both accurately portrays the painful discomfort of adolescence, sweetly represented here as a period of tremendous latency. It also reflects a more profound reality that afflicts all of us. Mundane reality can give the most sophisticated and world-weary human the sense that all of life is just high school over and over again. ND gets at that insight.

As a result -- and this is most important --because the film so adroitly manipulates the distance between experience and response, it is also very funny. I saw this film on my DVD player, but I've heard that the original audiences in the theaters were in stitches.

And the dance scenes, managed with weirdly compelling elegance by Jon Heder, are also worth the price of admission. Again, they demonstrate that grace is the cousin of the grotesque, and that both are part of the human condition.",1143936000,11,2443,5.052109181141439

Making up stories to impress people who will never like him, eating in class, fending off bullies while trying to keep a cool status with the ladies, it's like being back in high school all over again!

None of which were humorous at all. We were both very dissatisfied with the film. I like lame humour, but this type was just pathetic. It's a ridiculously monotonous film with an uninteresting plot.

Unfortunately, for Christmas my uncle decided to buy me something that all the girls at his work were talking about. He bought me Napoleon Dynamite on DVD. ""Thanks, I really love this movie,"" I lied.

Me and my friend decided we'd give it another chance. Sometimes I like movies better a second time. Not Napoleon Dynamite. The only thing we giggled at was when Napoleon sulks, ""Idiot!"".

This movie is lame and hardly a masterpiece. It is full of boring characters and pathetic stereotypes. In a way, it is just another teen movie. Needless to say, I sold my DVD a few days later. Very disappointing for such a hyped up film. Maybe I just don't get it. But I doubt it.",1142640000,8,1357,4.665271966527197

This is actually a very good movie.  It tells the story of dimwitted but kindhearted Napolean and his quirky group of family and friends as he navigates things like the school dance and class elections.  His new found buddy Pedro and he compete, to some extent anyway, for the affection of the same girl.  Napolean's uncle babysits while his grandma's hurt from an ATV accident and buys a time machine.  You get the idea.  There is great depth of character and Uncle Rico is just funny as hell.

I saw it and there were about 50 scenes that tried to make you laugh, and I only laughed at 3 (Napoleon get a steak thrown at his face; his uncle says ""Get some pampers for you and your brother"":the scene with Pedros cousins).

Some people will laugh because they think the characters are pathetic and stupid and, well...it's fun to laugh at people so we can feel better about ourselves, isn't it?  For people like that, it is probably important to pay attention to Don, the ""cool"" guy at Preston High who laughs increduously at Napoleon and his friends...but who is also unaware that he's the most pathetic character in the film.

Anyway, I think the genius of this movie is partly in its deadly accurate portrayal of small-town American life for teenagers.  I grew up in rural Maine (another potato farming state) and I identified very strongly with many of the seemingly absurd situations in the movie...the wacky characters are not so wacky, really.  The way some shots are set up say so much about what a struggle it can be to fit in in a place where the both minds and cliques are pretty closed.

Most of the movie's charm is in its examination of the power of true friendship.  Anyone who doesn't think there is a deeper meaning to this somewhat pointless, plotless, random collection of bizarre situations doesn't understand what it means to be willing to do anything for people you care about.

In the end, this is a highly original movie(with a very good soundtrack)that will be enjoyed by the Dons of the world who like to laugh at the geeks (unfortunately) and enjoyed more by those who can see pieces of their own humanity in Napoleon and his family and friends.",1140912000,6,1681,4.632996632996633

I wish all of the praisers of this film would quit making it out to be something it isn't. There is NO deeper meaning or abstract message to be gleaned from it.

I never made a big effort to be 'popular' and certainly succeeded at fading into the woodwork, so I suppose you could say I identified with the movie in a big way.

These memorable characters made being a geek great and I love them for it. It has a surprise ending, so make sure you don't turn it off during what you think is the 'last scene'.

1553691,5,B00005JNBQ,"Okay, the first time I sat down and watched NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, my reaction was the same as many: ""What the heck was that?"" Aside from some occasional laughs, I wasn't impressed, dismissing the film as overrated and trying too hard to be quirky. But something odd happened. As weeks passed, moments from the film started creeping into my consciousness. Sure the one-liners were memorable, but I started to remember whole scenes...and actually laughing about it. Ironically, I began remembering NAPOLEON DYNAMITE more fondly than when I originally saw it. So I decided to view it again. It was as if I were watching it with completely different eyes. The film is basically a slice-of-life story about an awkward high school kid named Napoleon Dynamite and how he deals with life's little triumphs and defeats. Practically all the major characters...Napoleon's friends Deb and Pedro, his brother Kip and his uncle Rico have their quirks but none quite as colorful as Napoleon himself (so brilliantly played by Jon Heder).But while Napoleon can be characterized as nerdy, he lives so blissfully in his own world that it's hard to feel too sorry for him. Some viewers don't like him at all. They think he's too prickly or unsympathetic. But I like him very much. Napoleon (like Deb and Pedro) is a bit of an outsider and it's possible that's because of his personality, or perhaps his personality was born out of being CONSIDERED different...a sort of defense mechanism developed over time. Or maybe, I'm just reading too much into his character. There's no mistaking the fact that Napoleon, Deb and Pedro are outsiders. During the school dance, there's a moment in which the three characters are in the foreground watching everybody else on the dance floor. At first the shot seems trivial. But after another viewing, the moment really seemed to illustrate their isolation from everyone else. I could very well have been one of them. It was oddly touching. Yet this movie is no downer. After all, the characters don't ultimately fail at all. By staying true to their originality and always being themselves, they have their victorious moments. And the more invested you are in the characters, the more pleasing their victories become. My problem when first viewing this film is that I was expecting the laughs, as you would a normal comedy. But this comedy is anything but normal. As I viewed it the 2nd and 3rd times with a different perspective, it became much more humorous, touching and satisfying. I've seen the loser-becomes-a-winner story done before but never quite like this. There's nothing apologetic or sentimental about NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, which makes it all the more charming. When the ""Promise"" song starts to play during that last tether-ball scene, I actually get a little choked-up. I don't know why, and it's probably best not to analyze...let's just say I love this film! I'm not going to advise people to watch the film again if they absolutely hated it the first time. But if someday out of nowhere you think of a moment from this film and it makes you smile, I say give NAPOLEON DYNAMITE another try!",1140048000,4,3118,4.9184060721062615

Older people seem to hate it, they don't understand it, they see no humor in it, they just don't get it. Now, here's the thing: I'm 35, and I LOVE this movie.

Even if you disregaurd the fact that the ""humor"" in this film is lame the charachters obviosuly don't enjoy their lives so there is no way to laugh with them.

When this film debuted, some of my closest friends told me it was an amazing film, hilarious, and even quite possibly the best movie ever. These are good friends, whose opinions I trust. They have recommended good movies to me before, and I have been content and enthralled with their suggestions.

However, there was a contingent group who hated it. These are good friends, whose opinions I trust. They have recommended good movies to me before, and I have been content and enthralled with their suggestions. Their loathing was only matched by the previous group's love for it.

Napoleon yin to Dynamite yang.

The media said this. Professional movie reviewers said this. Complete strangers I harassed on the bus said this. Just kidding, I don't ride the bus. But complete strangers did come to the same conclusions about this film.

Napoleon Dynamite is either the best or the worst film ever made.

Suddenly, the world is thrown into sharp contrast. There are two kinds of people in the world. Those who love it and those who hate it. I didn't want to know what kind of person I was, if I was a lover or a hater. What would it say about who I am and the structure of my personality and my taste in films and comedy? Which ever would I be? Let the spinning of the Tao commence!

I've now seen it three times. Upon the first viewing, I kept waiting for the punch line. I kept waiting to laugh. It felt like it was a constant set-up with no payoff. (However, the introductory credits were clever and exciting.) It left me feeling blah.

Upon the second viewing, for some reason, I started to giggle more. I paid more attention to the details. I submitted myself to that world. Napoleon's whiny GHAWD seemed less grating. Pedro was suddenly hilarious. And damn, I want that suit.

By the third viewing, I think I figured it out. It's not a constant set up and no punch lines. It's all punch line. That's why it's one of the most quoted movies right now. Every phrase is a one-liner with a subtle punch. I bet the French love that movie. The background, the sets and clothes, the top-loading VCRs, the god-almighty moon boots, the ambiance is the set up for this film. At first I balked over the seeming lack of plot, but the more I've seen it, the less it matters. The wedding is the best part. ""Sorry I'm late. I just got done taming a wild honeymoon stallion for you guys."" Salvador Dali would be proud.

So, what can I say, I liked it. Eventually. It grew on me like an overzealous mole. Like a chia pet. Like bacteria on a forming brick of bleu cheese. The only problem now is that I have a nine-year-old running around occasionally belting out an exasperated whine of, ""I told you! I spent the summer with my uncle in Alaska hunting wolverines!""

He has no friends, he's picked on by bullies, he has a somewhat-odd home life ... but through it all, he's sure things will be just plain okay in the end.

Napoleon and his older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) live with their grandmother, but at the beginning of the film she tells them she needs to take off for a couple days. Enter their Uncle Rico (Jon Gries), a self-starter who's living in 1982 (when the coach of his high school football team declined to put him in as quarterback, thus altering Rico's life forever). Some of the funniest scenes in the film involve Napoleon's often-combative relationship with Uncle Rico; Rico is also bound and determined to return to those halcyon days of his youth via a time machine he's seen advertised on the Internet, and he enlists Kip to help him raise the funds.

Napoleon befriends the new kid in school, Pedro (Efren Ramirez), who has a sweet bike, can talk to girls, and has an actual mustache. But like Napoleon, Pedro is a misfit. Both sometimes hang out with yet another taciturn student, Deb (Tina Majorino, all grown up from Waterworld), who secretly (it seems) likes Napoleon. But there isn't a lot of focus on their relationship, because Napoleon himself is fairly oblivious to how people perceive him. This isn't a story about young love or lust, it's a story about a misfit refusing to fit - while fitting in with others like him.

Jon Heder is perfectly cast as the gawky, dorky Napoleon; he resembles Butt-Head in countenance, although certainly not in temperament or intelligence. Mouth agape and with an awkward gait, Napoleon is about as odd a duck as you'd find in high school, and yet he still manages to survive with his dignity intact. He's a good egg, although he seems to overreact at times: ""What are you gonna do today, Napoleon? Napoleon: Whatever I feel like I wanna do.....GOSH!"" Still, his delivery is perfect. You can readily picture a Napoleon in any high school.

I think where the film ultimately succeeds, aside from the casting of Heder, is that it doesn't fall into the traps of predictability and stereotyping. Sure, it's a high school movie, and there are snobby pretty girls and arrogant jocks, but not much time is devoted to them. Sure, there's a big dance, but it doesn't necessarily turn out the way you'd expect it to. What you're left with, then, isn't a typical coming-of-age story, but rather a unique take on a rather mundane - albeit life-altering - time in a boy's life.",1136505600,7,2592,4.740576496674057
1553981,3,B00005JNBQ,"Napoleon Dynamite doesn't have too much of a plot to start with; A high-school geek and his friend try to find a girl who will want to go to the school dance with them sums it up in a nutshell. There are still lots of laughs to be had throught the movie anyway. The fact that no matter what the situation, the same wierd expression on Napoleon's face never changes got a lot of laughs out of me. I watched it with a group of people of many ages and they all found something they liked in this movie. The younger kids thought things like Napoleon's uncle takeing a self-defense class and the old farmer shooting his cow (with a school bus driving past and covering the scene) were funny, and everyone was laughing when Napoleon started danceing for his friend Pedro's class presidential election skit. There are many great things for the casual viewer to enjoy, but don't come anywhere near this movie if your looking for something with a Lord of the Rings plot depth. I don't think I would pay to see it again, but I wouldn't necessarily avoid it.",1136160000,,1047,4.430051813471502

I think it's hilarious from start to finish with a perfect cast, great soundtrack and memorable lines from the main character.  Also, the interaction between Napoleon and Uncle Rico keeps me laughing my butt off every time I watch it.

I can see how some people may think it's 'lame'.  It's not the kind of 'stand up' comedy movies you see nowadays.  I guess some people need to be hit over the head with humour to enjoy a comedy?

Roger Ebert has said we feel sorry for the characters?  I totally disagree.  I love the characters and accepted them for who they are, where they lived and all their idiosyncracies.  Plus, you'll be too busy laughing to feel sorry for any of them.",1136073600,4,793,4.406896551724138
1553983,4,B00005JNBQ,"Napoleon Dynamite is a king among nerds, a slack-jawed, mouth-breathing high school student who suffers the slings and arrows of perpetual ridicule, yet who gives as good as he gets when the treatment gets too rough.  Luckily, Napoleon is far from alone in his nerddom. He has an older brother who wears buttoned-up short sleeve dress shirts and black-rimmed glasses, and whose social contact is limited mainly to people he meets in internet chat rooms.  Napoleon's Uncle Rick is what might be called a ""muscular nerd,"" a used-up, middle aged football player who dreams of his glory days in 1982 when he was just one play away from a career in the NFL and a life of fame and fortune, and who now spends his time hawking Tupperware products, selling miracle breast enhancement devices, and investing in time travel machines he finds in catalogues.  Napoleon also befriends the school's newest nerd, a transfer student named Pedro, and tries to start up a romance with the shy and awkward Deb, who sheepishly goes door to door drumming up business for her studio that specializes in ""glamour"" photo shots for a decidedly unglamorous clientele.

Set in a small town in rural Idaho, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a quirky regional comedy that achieved phenomenal mainstream success at the American box office.  Its appeal is in its low-keyed, understated look at a group of people that more of us probably identify with than we would like to acknowledge.  This is a movie for anyone who has ever felt unattractive or unpopular, who just never quite ""fit in"" with the people who really counted, especially in those dark ages known as the ""teen years.""  One can't help liking and rooting for these bizarre and eccentric individuals who are really just looking for the same love and acceptance that we all are.

 Director Jared Hess, along with co-writer Jerusha Hess, never feels the need to exaggerate or overstate the comedy.  It would have been easy for them to have turned this into another ""Revenge of the Nerds,"" placing their characters in over-the-top predicaments and situations to appease audience expectations.  Instead, they let the story develop subtly and gradually, making the film feel more attuned to real life in the process.  It may seem like a contradiction in terms, but the writers achieve their humor through a kind of understated hyperbole that allows us to laugh with the characters rather than at them.  These nerds may be nerds to the core, but they reflect the longings and doubts common to all of us at one time or another.  As a result, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is warm and humanistic where it could easily have been cruel and condescending.

The filmmakers are helped immeasurably by a wonderfully talented cast, all of whom play their parts perfectly.  Joe Heder as Napoleon, Aaron Ruell as his brother, Kip, Efren Ramirez as Pedro, and Tina Majorino as Deb all deliver their lines in a flat, emotionless, singsong monotone that perfectly captures the defense mechanism each of them has set up as a shield against a brutal, uncomprehending world.  Yet, Napoleon and his fellow nerds never settle for victim status, as each finds a way to assert his individuality and carve out a little piece of happiness for himself.  As an actor, only Jon Gries as Napoleon's Uncle Rico gets to break through the somnambulist haze and go for the fences in his delivery.

""Napoleon Dynamite"" is clearly not the kind of movie that every audience will appreciate, but those movie watchers with a taste for the offbeat and quirky will have a fun time with it.",1135987200,8,3554,4.8737541528239205

How could you not laugh at the scene when Napoleon started dancing on stage?! I read a lot of the reviews for this movie, and the ones where the people gave the movie 1 star, said that they laughed a little. They still thought some parts were funny. My favorite part of the movie is when the farmer loads up the shotgun, aims it at the cows face at point blank range and then the school bus pulls up and you here the gun shot and all the kids saw the cow get shot in the face and all of the kids screamed.

This movie was recommended to me by my son. So, I finally got it and watched it. WOW. wicked cool. Funny, interesting, insightful.

My son, the Marine, over in Iraq, he loves this movie, and I must agree. This is something! Don't you just get tired of the run of the mill, cranked out Hollywood spatter, that we are suppose to rave over, even if we know in our hearts that it's not that great?

Well, then, this is a breath of fresh air!

The kid, Napoleon, played by Jon Heder, is about as ugly a kid as you'll ever meet. Not terribley bright either. But, there is something loveable about him. Maybe it's the ""Me"" in him. He is me, he is you, he represents all of our insecurities, faults, dreams that go unfulfilled. We all blunder, we all blow it, we all have dreams that get poo pooed by a family member or friend. We pretend that it doesn't bother us. but, I think it does.

Napoleon embodies all our fears and hopes. that is what makes him so special. His idiot-ness is out, in plane sight,  for all to see. we laugh, but we FEEL him, and FEEL his pain. His family, brother, and uncle, are an extension of his painful dumb-assedness. they are a hoot! but, in a way that is embarrassing. like an uncle that is so absurd, you hope your friends don't come over when he's there, because you will be embarrassed by him.

Life isn't all pretty, and we don't all look like Paris or Brittany or Tom or Leonardo.. life is cruel. life is hard. And most all of us can relate to Napoleon. Great acting, great humor. Great humor with a straight face. And great dancing at the end. Which reminds me, I enjoyed his friend, the Mexican kid, can't remember his name. Good on him too!

My dear man, Norman, laughed his bum off (can i say ass?) He liked it too.

It's a slice of real life, that's what makes it great.

Napolean is the dork that we can all relate to in some odd way. From his odd comments (""I love your sleeves, they're real big"") to his quirky habits (""Liger"" drawings) we all have a hidden Napolean Dynamite waiting to be unleashed on the world. The ending of the movie is both uplifting and inspiring.

I also loved the dance scene. My only regret is that we don't witness Dynamite's reaction to the audience's applause as we do his successfully elected friend (Efren Ramirez appearing as ""Pedro Sanchez;"" you may have already seen a ""Vote for Pedro"" tee shirt at a mall near you.)

During the course of the movie, he develops new friendships and a possible romantic interest, and grows enough to put himself out there, literally, for the sake of his new friend, when his friend is on the rocks.

There was nothing clever, fresh, interesting, or funny.  It's an oddly predictable flick about a group of dysfunctional, unlovable losers who finally win out over the typical, beautiful-people snobs at the small-town high school.  Because I was with friends who thought they were doing me a favor, I had to restrain from yawning and checking my watch.  I kept waiting for laughs that never came.  It was like watching a film written by high school kids working on their first script, or one of those tediously long SNL skits (but I repeat myself).  By the end, I could sympathize with Alex from CLOCKWORK ORANGE who was forced to watch videos with his eyelids forced open.

However... this movie is also overrated. I mean, you can't go anywhere without seeing a ""Vote For Pedro"" or ""Gimme Your Tots"" shirt, and almost everyone on facebook.com is in a Napoleon Dynamite group. I think people think a little TOO much of this movie. Like I said, it's a good movie, but wow... people, please...

1554152,2,B00005JNBQ,"For nearly a year, I've had to endure siblings and friends quoting this movie and breaking into uncontrollable fits of laughter, so I finally decided I had to see it too so that I might laugh along. From the opening scene, things looked mildly promising. Napolean, the nerdiest, sleepiest-looking high-schooler you've ever seen hops on a school bus where another kid asks, ""Napolean, what are you going to do today?"" Napolean replies ""Whatever I feel like -- GOSH!"" with a little jerk of his head. Then he pulls a plastic figurine from his pocket, ties a string around its neck, and lowers it out of the window, letting it drag along the ground behind the bus. All right, I thought, this is going to be one of those screwy comedies full of eccentric characters who do random things. I was prepared for that, but I wasn't prepared for the 90-minute borefest that ensued. With no real plot to speak of, and characters that just aren't that likeable or interesting, I found myself longing for the movie to be over only a few minutes into it. I stuck it through in the hopes that it would improve, but no such luck. As far as comedes go, the humor in this one is quite subtle, and consistent in style throughout. If you like the first ten minutes, you'll probably enjoy the rest of the movie. If after ten minutes you find it isn't your cup of tea, stop there--it doesn't get any better.

I was tempted to give only one star, but I felt like being a little generous, perhaps because after suffering through this movie, I finally can understand references to it (those ""Vote for Pedro"" bumper stickers and tee-shirts, my family's quotes, and Heder's recent appearance on Saturday Night Live, which was quite funny after seeing this film). Apparently, this is a film you either love or hate. I can't stand it. If you have not yet seen this move, I'd recommend borrowing it or renting it before buying.",1133568000,10,1895,4.589970501474927

1554157,1,B00005JNBQ,"The longest 90 minutes in history came to a close when this horrifying excuse for cinema finished on my DVD player. I'm not exaggerating here: I removed the shrink-wrap, watched the movie, and put it up for sale in the span of two hours. This from someone who never sells any DVD unless I've picked up a ""deluxe edition"" and need to get rid of the old version. I couldn't imagine a deluxe version of this: two discs of pure drivel instead of one? Where do I sign up?

Early on in this movie, Napoleon is watching his uncle's old football video. He says, ""this is, like, the worst video ever"". That, my friends, is the sweet embodiment of irony. You see, at worst, anything else could only possibly be the second worst video ever. That particular low bar has been set by the very film that contains the line, and it's not likely to be displaced by anything. Ever.

Maybe I just don't get it. Perhaps I'm a cinema snob--someone who actually likes to have things like plot, dialogue, acting, interesting characters, humor, and enough entertainment to avoid slipping into a coma when it comes to movies. If none of those things matter to you, saddle up and ride this broken-legged horse that needs to be euthanized. However, if you are capable of individual thought, enjoy movies that actually have some effort put into them, or hell, even if you're just cultured enough to proclaim Rob Schneider movies as ""awesome"", you are waaaaaaay above this particular disgraceful clunker.

1554158,3,B00005JNBQ,"I really like this movie and the charachters in it.  I even bought the dvd, and I don't own many.  Especially ""comedies"".

When I first watched Napoleon, the blandness and the rudeness took me by surprise at the beginning.  And the immaturity.  I didn't see the appeal of the film at all.  Then, Napoleon danced.  To help his friend, Pedro.  You sense he didn't want to do it and wasn't sure about what to do, but he did it anyway and didn't hang around afterwards to soak in any glory or appreciation for himself. And the film let Pedro have his moment of disbelief and astonished joy. He comes alive.  Then, I liked Napoleon much better.  Whenever I have a bad day, I watch the dance and Pedro's reaction afterwards.  Everything else up that occurs up to that point becomes almost forgivable, because under all the pettiness there is a heart to this movie.  Which almost got lost. If it wasn't for Pedro and Nap's friendship, the movie would have been a zero.

What would have made it better?  I think more depth with why Napoleon was so frustrated with life and relationships in his family.  He's still half asleep even at the film's conclusion.  I'm not asking for him to be drastically changed, but for at least for the poor fellow to gain some self awareness or lesson learned from his ordeal with life.

I did like LaFawnduh.  I keep reading how there is no sex in this movie.  The relationship she had with Kip was full of chemistry, which saved it from teetering between ""yew"" and too cutesy.  The fact that he took off with her was centered completely on sex.  Although Kip finally developed in that aspect of his life, it didn't mean that he grew up. It remains to be seen if LaFawnduh becomes another substitute for Grandma, or if Kip steps up to the plate and delivers on his potential under LaFawnduh's positive influence.

Deb was perfect.  I liked the fact that film gave her a chance to tell Napoleon off, even though she was mislead by Uncle Ric. It's good to know she was learning to speak her mind instead of running off. And that Nap was willing to take responsibility and make amends with her with a ""freshly caught bass"" even though Uncle Ric was ruining his life.

1554293,4,B00005JNBQ,"Within 20 minutes you will know if you're going to love or hate this film.  There is a general story line here:  a particularly nerdy high school boy stumbles through life, aware that he is often treated poorly, but apparently oblivious to his own idiosyncracies.  Various themes are touched upon:  family dysfunction, geeks get girls, and how self-confidence can overpower even near-constant peer negativity.

Nevertheless, the enjoyment Dynamite offers is in the over-all effect of this clumsy, often clueless hero plowing through life, successfully overcoming a constant flow of obstacles.  In the end, good hearts win, and sometimes even jerks can find redemption.

There is no doubt that this offering is quirky, quite weird, and will prove grating to some viewers.  Thus, my 4-stars is Ebert's 1.5.  Napolean Dynamite will either grow on you, or cause you to start pulling out your hair.

Bottom-line:  To thine own self be true.  Either enjoy the ride, or bail out before you require Rogaine!",1132704000,,999,5.136645962732919

If it was possible, I'd give it negative stars.

Not only is this the least enjoyable movie I have ever seen, but it's probably the worst $8.75 I've ever spent at the movie theater. Or anywhere else for that matter.

It feels as though the makers of the film sat there thinking ""what would be funny to see in a movie?"" and then took an hour thinking of a list of things.

Writer A:""oh man! trapper keepers! remember those? hahaha""

Writer B:""yeah! what about moon boots!""

Writer A:""what about a guy on a bike, pulling a guy on rollerblades! hahaha! that'd be hilarious!""

Writer B:""yeah but how do we write that into the movie??""

Writer A:""we don't! we'll just have it happen!""

The movie plays out like a pile of ""funny"" ideas thrown together into an uneven, aimless waste of 90 minutes.

The movie does have one good quality though.

All of these themes have been 'done' and done far better than this. Worst of all this film is clearly self-conscious and pretentious. It thinks that just because it is an 'indie' film somehow everything it does is clever: WRONG. Unfortunately, like the Emperor with no clothes it has taken quite a few people along for the ride, silently mocking them even as they enjoy their feelings of superiority over the characters in the movie.

There are those of us who are just sick to death of big Hollywood romantic comedies......In this we get Napoleon and Deb, two kids who really dig each other (I think) but never hold hands, kiss, or anything, now how much of a nice change is that? no stupid fighting. no boring love scene, no dumb family banter, just two kids tryin' to make it through high school. Then there are also those of us who are sick of the big Hollywood comedies that are never as funny as advertised or previewed. In Napoleon we get hilarious lines and situations you would least expect and takes 2-3 viewings before you can catch all the jokes.

I have seen this over 20 times (we watch it at work all the time) and I still stop what I'm doing several times to watch some of my favorite scenes. How about the big dance number towards the end? If you like this movie you know every time that comes on, you're gonna be watching every second of it. Then there is the school dance where Napoleon gets ditched by the popular girl, but does get to dance with Deb and tells her he likes her sleeves, cuz there poofy.

Napoleon's best friend is a winner as well, Pedro runs for class president and actually wins thanks to Napoleon, but his best scene is where he organizes a picnic and they bash a pinata shaped like his opponents head (the most popular girl in school. Summer)

All these actores are no-namers, but most will soon be huge, I've heard rumors that they might make a sequel, which would be great fun, hopefully all the cast will be back.

You just gotta love Brother Kip and Uncle Rico, Kip is in love with his chat room buddy and Rico is a get-rich-quick schemer who is stuck in the 80's, so much that he orders a time machine that Napoleon unfortunately finds out the hard way that it does not work.

Watch this people, alot of reviewers have dogged it big-time, but it's really funny, very charming and characters you're just going to love.

This movie is unique. Forget the plot; it is a character study of very small town America. The humour is in the ridiculous traits and behavior of some of these desparate people. It's somewhere between Green Acres and Fargo with the charm and low budget, non-Hollywood appeal of Home Alone and the Gods Must be Crazy.

Don't take it too seriously. This movie is extremely funny; you won't be able to get these characters out of your mind for a long time. In fact the thing that stuck me the most was 'where did they get these actors'. Napoleon, Kip, Rico and Lafawndah are brilliant in their roles. Like 'George McFly' in Back to the Future they are just hilarious to listen to and look at.

The odd thing is that . . . neither were they!  I've seen ""Holy Grail"" (for example) about a thousand times, and I still bust a gut.  Don't you laugh when Marty Feldman sticks his head out the door in ""Young Frankenstein"" and says . . . ""Blucher!"".  Yet, this Pedro crowd couldn't even muster a titter at the tater tots scene, or much else for that matter.

The plot: An outsider meets the new kid at school and decides to help him run for class president.

All of my friends at school talked about how funny it was, so since it had such a excellent reputation, I decided to check it out.

You wait for something to actually happen, but honestly, nothing ever does. The dialogue is terrible, the acting is terrible. Only watch this movie if you have a couple of hours that you want to waste, and can't think of anything else that would be more entertaining such as this.

This is a movie that has always sucked, not before every american teenager decided to quote it, or after everyone knew where the line ""GIMME SOME OF YOUR TATER TOTS!!!!!!"" originated from. Not because it has been over-quoted big-time, but because it has no plot or interesting dialogue whatsoever. The movie has no point, except maybe to top Pulp Fiction in being the most misquoted movie ever. The difference is, Pulp Fiction doesn't suck.

For some reason, all of the 'goth' and 'emo' kids like this movie and idolize it. Not because they thought it was funny, but because their friend thought it was funny.

I'd like someone to explain to me what the hell is so funny about some kid who talks like he's someone's bi*ch? And even if it were funny, why would it be funny when you say it? Well, its not. Almost every review on here that is for Napoleon Dynamite includes the words ""frickin'"" ""gosh"", or ""sweet!"". I would rather be blasted in the face with a shotgun loaded with Al Gore's semen than listen to another one of these horrible renditions of this shi*ty movie.

Oh look, the guy needs chapstick! Call everyone! This movie needs to be seen over and over and over!

Why don't you obsessed fans just break down and stalk the mediocre actor who played Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder is his name!) so you can ask him to do the lines over and over for you so you don't have to blather it off to everyone you meet?

Seriously, this sh*t needs to end. I'm so sick of this movie. Shi*ty only half describes it. Take sh*t, add a baboon's ass, and multiply by Michael Moore's weight, and the product is Napoleon Dynamite.

Kid1: Hey! Guess what I got? The Napoleon Dynamite DVD with 12 hours of extra footage of him saying ""IDIOT!""!!!

Kid2: GOSH!! THAT IS LIKE THE BEST MOVIE EVER! LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL!!!!

Kid1: ""Your mom went to the college."" (Do you think I'm funny now?)

Kid2: ""YES OMGZ GOSH GOSH GOSH GOSH GOSH GOSH GOSH GOSH GOSH GOSH I LOVE THAT MOVIE""

Kid2: ""WHAT A GREAT IDEA! GOSH!""

You will not be entertained. You will not be uplifted. You will not be engaged in the storyline as it does not have one. You will not be inspired.

1554393,5,B00005JNBQ,"This movie is like infinity times better than the last million movies I've seen.  You should definitely quit chatting with babes on the internet and check it out!

What happens when you take a cast of unknowns (except for one actor who's biggest other parts were in ""The Country Bears"" and playing Jethro in the movie of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"") and combine them with a script about high school geeks where the entire plot could be described in 3 sentences?

Magic happens.

Jared Hess and wife Jerusha co-wrote the script and John Heder brings to life  Napoleon Dynamite, an awkward Idaho high-schooler who is sooooo far from cool.  He is tall and gangly, all knees and elbows with an unruly mop of orange hair. Like all teenagers, he has dreams about being more than he is, but poor Napoleon is so far from the mainstream that he doesn't bother dreaming about things your average teenager fantasizes about.  When the other kids dream about going to the major leagues, becoming a movie star or getting into medical school.  Napoleon would be satisfied to have ""computer hacking skills"" or ""numchuck skills"".  Like a lot of high-school geeks, Napoleon spends a lot of time drawing fantasy pictures, and because he's Napoleon, they're not very good.  Unlike the geeks in, for example, the ""Revenge of the Nerds"" movies, Napoleon is so clueless he doesn't recognize how far out of the mainstream he is.  At one point he decides to impress a girl by drawing her portrait.  He gives her the pitiful drawing and tells her ""I spent like three hours doing shading the upper lip. It's probably the best drawing I've ever done.""

In the universe of this movie, Napoleon almost fits right in, because his family is dysfunctional in the extreme.  (There's never even a mention of his parents.) Napoleon lives at home with his thrill-seeking grandmother and 30-something loser brother, Kip.  In many ways Kip is more pitiful than Napoleon because he's had an extra dozen years or so to develop into... a guy who spends all his time on the internet ""chatting with babes"". (One of the best sequences of the film comes later on when his online girlfriend, LaFawnduh, actually takes a bus out to the middle of nowhere to meet Kip.)

The film is populated by other lovable losers like Pedro, a dull boy who imagines that he can get the most popular girl in school to like him if he bakes her a cake. Uncle Rico, another odd family member, comes to babysit Napoleon (and 30 year old Kip) after Grandma is injured in a scene that couldn't have been better if Larry, Curley and Moe had been in it.  Uncle Rico dwells on his high-school football glory, when his team WOULD have won the big game if the coach had only put him in at quarterback.

The allure in the film comes from the characters, their situations and especially their language.  You just have to SEE it to get the magic in lines like ""Hey, Napoleon, what are you gonna do today?"" ""Whatever I feel like I wanna do. Gosh!""

Napoleon Dynamite lives in a cow town with his grandma and his thirty-something year old stay-at-home brother Kip.  Napoleon hasn't got much going for him besides his own imagined ""skills"" and a tremendous imagination.  When his grandma gets injured on a day trip, Creepy Uncle Rico comes to take care of Kip and Napoleon.  Add to that Napoleon's accidental friendship with the new kid, Pedro and you've got a recipe for a fine little tale that involves a rip-off time travel machine, disco dancing, true love (over the internet), suit shopping at a thrift store, and chicken farming.  The music collected for this film is eclectic and light.  The soundtrack - with sound bites taken from the movie between songs - is a precious addition to the film.

Doesn't sound like much?  That's the magic.  The ""high point"" of the film is a risky run for class president.  But along the way, Napoleon gets to demonstrate his odd sort of faithfulness to his friends and a willingness to dare to dream.

Oh, and listen to the commentary on the DVD.  Jon Heder (Napoleon) and Jared Hess' commentary are hilarious.  Score one for the little guys.",1131321600,6,1269,4.709090909090909

Predictable cliches, like Napoleon's brother being astounded that his grandma gets annoyed at paying for his hours of internet chat time. Napoleon's constant rudeness was really annoying and off-putting, and I didn't see what was funny about him saying ""sweet"" or ""gosh"" or ""idiots!"" all the time.

The only two funny parts for me were: when the farmer shoots the cow in front of the kid-filled school bus, and Uncle Rico's reaction when Napoleon pelts his van with a grapefruit.

1554524,4,B00005JNBQ,"Napoleon Dynamite is one of the more interesting movies to be made in the last decade.  It is also a good representation of the newly fashinoned post modern hero.  Napoleon floats through life without any motivation whatsoever.  He takes pleasure in the small things in life like `chapstick' and drawing fantasy cartoon characters.  The screenwriter could have organized the plot around a long protracted battle between the nerds and the cool people.  Instead, nobody in this movie seems to care about who wins or loses this battle.  Except for the `Vote for Pedro' campaign, we are left with the notion that the `nerds' and the `dorks' are happy with their lot in high school life.  In fact, we are left to believe that Napoleon's involvement in Pedro's campaign is only to serve as Pedro's bodyguard.  So although Napoleon is focused, his focus is detached.  Uncle Rico, on the other hand, has an undetached focus in his life.  Unfortunately, his focus is on the year 1982 when his football team played in the State championship.  While Uncle Rico concentrates on the past, and Napoleon arguably concentrates on nothing, Kip is the only one that focuses on the future with his relationship and eventual marriage to LaFawnduh.  It seems Kip is the only one to break out of the family's monotonous existence.  The movie is also very family friendly.  There is no violence, no gratuitous sexual innuendos and no drugs.  Hardly the usual fare of the 18-25 year old cohort which has taken to this movie.  (An age group that may be responsible for the ubiquity of the Vote for Pedro T-Shirts)  With the momentum that this movie has gained, it may be considered the first cult classic of the 00's, even though the community in the film seems to be trapped in the 1980's.",1130889600,3,1765,4.772277227722772

Napoleon Dynamite is not your typical highschool student. He is one of those freaks that you made fun of and thanked goodness that you weren't him. But the thing is, Napoleon is completely comfortable with himself and is confident enough to ask the most popular girl in school to play teather ball with him, even though she declined, of course.
Napoleon's friends aren't too average either.
Let's begin with Pedro (finally, the reason for the endless Vote for Pedro t-shirts). Pedro is the new kid. He's spanish and for some reason, he's kinda popular. He is ready to find a date to the dance and actually gets one. He also decides to run for Class President. And wins.
Then there's Deb. The girl Napoleon meets when she shows up on his doorstep selling keychains and Glamour Shots. She's shy and really weird. And she drinks two percent (even when Napoleon says she could drink whole if she wanted). And guess what? Napoleon is in love with her.
Next up is Uncle Rico. He has problems. And lots of them. He gets crazy business ideas and will do anything to get them to sell. Including dragging poor Napoleon along with him.
And then there's Kip. Kip has been chatting online with babes ALL day. And he's found his soul mate, LaFonda (who happens to be a chubby black woman). But hey, we all have our types.
This movie takes place back in the 80's (which I was not alive during so I have no clue what they're talking about). The humor is not presented in an intentional way, but it still gets laughs.

Just don't take it too seriously and you'll enjoy it. The actors do a good job acting like mindless idiots and you'll love learning the one-liners that Napoleon is famous for. Just check it out.

The film basically chronicles a short period in Napoleon's life during which he meets a new best friend whom he helps during a class-presidential running. During this same period, he meets a shy girl from school that he becomes close to and develops an interest in. His brother, Kip, meets a woman online that he believes is his soulmate. He gets married. Napoleon's Uncle Rico steps in to keep an eye on things when his grandmother is injured in an ATV accident at the sand dunes. Uncle Rico and Kip begin selling tupperware to make some sweet moolah.

The storyline is obviously not what engages you. It is the characters and their means of interaction. These interactions are unique and interesting, spurring some of the funniest ideas and lines of dialogue I have heard. It takes a certain sense of humor to appreciate this film. Most parents won't ""get it"", but there is no denying Napoleon Dynamite.

If you grew up in the 80's or early 90's then you can relate to the dialogue, and the various situations (reading a current event, being part of a ""happy hands"" club) that occur in this kid's school. The directors do such a great job in making the set and the dialogue as authentic as possible. This movie puts me straight back into my childhood every time Napoleon calls someone a ""friggin idiot"" or ""retarded"". If you can't relate to the humor, you will have a hard time watching Napoleon Dynamite. This style of movie isn't fast enough for a lot of viewers, and with an absence of a direct plot can make it that much more difficult.

1554612,2,B00005JNBQ,"I have to say, I did not 'get' this film. At all. I sat watching it this morning, after getting up, and thought ""Why?"" But it's also one of those films that sucks you in, and then spits you back out at the end. I ended up half way through, not liking the film, but not wanting to switch it off either. I was giving it the benefit of the doubt, and ended up wasting my time.

Why did I hate this film so much? Probably cos I recognised the lead character, and many other viewers will. There is a Napoleon Dynamite in every school. He's the guy who's not quite grown into his limbs yet, and can't quite work them. He doesn't really have a strong family background, and that reflects into his daily life. He has no friends, and no girls appear to fancy him. Mainly because he needs a serious makeover, contacts, a decent hairdresser, and braces. Poor Jon Heder must have been sick of that dazed look by the end of filming. And even the friend he makes, Pedro, he adopts the same look towards the end.

Also, his 'uncle' Rico, was a complete & utter sleaze. Ladies, while watching this film, you will hate this man. Hate him with such a passion, you will want to make sure he never reproduces. Ugh. He does kinda get his comeuppance, but who's the chick on the bike?

I actually thought Napoleon's brother was quite a sweetie, and although his attire looked really stupid towards the end, it was better than what he started out with!

I'm really sorry to say that I didn't like this. It's one of those films, you've read so many good reviews about it, you WANT to like it.

Maybe the fact that they feel constrained from laughing reveals a deep sense of superiority to the world portrayed in this wonderful film. Why is it that some say we should not laugh at others? Is it bcause they laugh out of derision while others laugh out of self-recognition, sympathy and a good dose of irony? I laughed or smiled through this entire film. The only people I felt deserved derision were the bullies and the self absorbed adults. The bizarre take on the nature of romance that permeates this film is wonderful and offers some truly hilarious moments as well as some very touching, heart warming ones. The technical qualities of this film are superb and really helps to create a picture postcard flatness that enhances the surreal, almost David Lynch like pace and nature of the film.

1554620,4,B00005JNBQ,"Last summer's runaway indie comedy smash ($400,000 budget, $40 million gross to date), Napoleon Dynamite, won't make everyone laugh. OK, maybe most people won't laugh, but this is a film with a fiercely loyal cult following (count how many Vote For Pedro shirts you see on your campus) that will appeal to former teen outcasts, nerds and Aspies (OK, so maybe the Aspie bit is redundant). Napoleon is a geeky high schooler/prodigal Aspie who wears snow boots in summer, draws Pegasus and unicorns in his Trapper Keeper, and lives with his very butch grandmother, a finicky llama named Tina, and Kip, his nerdy older brother who ""chats online with babes all day"" and is training to be a cage fighter (yeah, right).

Napoleon's school life consists of getting beat up by the resident jocks, and his home life isn't much better. (""How was school?"" his grandmother asks Napoleon. ""The worst day of my life, what do you think?"").  He soon meets Deb, a geeky, painfully shy neighbor who is earning money for college by producing glamour shots in her basement and selling those funky boondoggle keychains (I am SO a child of the `80s!), and Pedro, a Mexican fresh across the border, who answers everything in a syllable or less, wears holy medals, and has santo candles ringing his bathtub.

The movie is filled with out-there moments: after Napoleon's grandma breaks her tailbone on the sand dunes (don't even ask!), his obnoxious Uncle Rico (which means ""rich"" in Spanish, appropriate because Rico is full of failed get-rich-quick schemes) comes to stay. Rico and Napoleon engage in heated battle, including flinging steaks and grapefruit at each other from moving vehicles, testing a time machine they bought online (which produces groinal electrocution), and Kip finally meets his Internet chat room honey LaFawnduh in the ample flesh (I thought, after a prolonged setup, that....well, never mind, put the pieces together for yourself. Hint: it involves Kip's comment about never seeing a full bodyshot of LaFawnduh before they meet).

Napoleon now has a gang of loyal geek outcasts, and the trio try to make their way through another horrible school year, including the prom and class elections. This leads to the film's funniest scene involving Napoleon, an awesome Jamiroquai song (Canned Heat), and D-Kwon's Dance Grooves. Actually, I found this film to be hysterical, being a) a child of the `80s and b) an incorrigible social outcast in high school.

1554775,3,B00005JNBQ,"There's something about high school that provides endless fodder for great movies.  ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" ""Sixteen Candles,"" and ""The Breakfast Club"" captured the '80s angst of my high school years.  ""Election"" and ""Rushmore"" may be about the generation after mine, but both movies had so much truth and wisdom that they spoke to a geezer like me as well as their target audience.  I know I'll watch all of these movies in 20 years and they will still ring true to me then.

""Napoleon Dynamite"" tries to be in the same mold as these essential films.  It tries to skewer the dark underbelly of high school, with its baseless favoritism, its soulless disregard for the unpopular, and its mind-numbing tedium.  To a certain extent, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" succeeds - there are a few laugh-out-loud moments about the truth of high school life.

But ""Napoleon Dynamite"" falls a bit through its titular hero.  Napoleon may be the biggest geek ever to have his own film.  To a certain extent, Napoleon is universal.  Like every high school student, his inner talents are bound by insecurity and immaturity.  So Napoleon responds with lies (the fictitious girlfriend from Oklahoma, the mastery of martial arts) and insults to protect himself.  Who didn't do something like that when they were 15?

And while Napoleon has an undeniable sweetness to him, the movie keeps the audience at arm's length.  This is a movie populated by morons, dweebs, and dorks.  They speak in sudden bursts of banality.  While the cast generally has the pent-up insecurity down, the movie screams for someone like Max Fischer from ""Rushmore"" to speak with poetry and spirit about who he is and where he wants to go.

Instead, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" offers no hope for its characters (some of whom it seems to love).  The high school students are varying degrees of cloistered non-entities, and the adults generally seem to be the same.  When Napoleon's older brother gets married to a towering African American, LaFonda, she is played strictly for laughs and he remains the same befuddled twit, only now in gangsta garb.  Sure, it's funny, and LaFonda's devotion to him is as sweet as it is inexplicable.  But it doesn't seem to go anywhere other than to the surreal.  No character offers Napoleon any hope that his future in the wilds of Idaho offers anything other than endless years of frustration and yearning -- playing tetherball, even with your soulmate, gets old after a while.

Indeed, when the DJ plays Alphaville's cheesy ""classic"" ""Forever Young"" at a dance, the lyric ""I want to be forever young"" doesn't seem like an anthem to these kids.  It feels more like a prison sentence.

Yet I'm glad that I've seen ""Napoleon Dynamite.""  Not only did I get some genuine laughs out of the movie, I now understand the point of all those retro ""Vote for Pedro"" T-shirts I've been seeing.

1554904,4,B00005JNBQ,"I've got to go along with the people who liked Napolean Dynamite.  John Heder depicts perfectly the nerdy high school male who is disaffected in virtually every area of life.  Even when his date skips out on him at the high school dance he could give a rat's ass.  Even when he gets pounded up against his school locker by hallway goons, big deal.  He just brushes himself off and goes about his nerdy way.  Pedro is great too, as are most of the cast.  The sleazy uncle is terrific, a loser always on the make trying to recapture past glory that was never really there to begin with.  And the older brother's online romance, and finally meeting his virtual sweetheart--a dominating black female about twice his size--is, well, just great.

Okay, so a universe has been created and we get to observe its characters for awhile.  And it works for the most part.  The only reason I didn't give Napolean Dynamite five stars is because of the awkward and abrupt ending.  It just seemed like the director didn't know how to wrap it up.

I like thick, hard to detect plots, for it symbolizes greatness in the work. May I dare say this movie failed to have a plot at all!!! This just followed a nerdy teen and his friend through days of school. I did not seem to find any of the dumb humor funny, and it only kept interest to finish the film only to see if the characters find out their life is worthless. Instead, the movie comes to an abrupt end, with absolutely no intelligent dialect at all and no story throughout. This is just a badly-put together fictional documentary of a nerd, if you take a step back to look at it.

A movie gets to create its own universe.  That universe must be internally consistent, and follow its own rules.  Napoleon dynamite does this well, creating an entirely unique universe with no Hollywood cliches, no tear-jerking stereotypical themes.  For some people, that could mean that it lacks the signposts with which they are familiar, the action or the jokes or the themes that make something entertainment.

By refusing to adopt those stereotypes, the movie hits the viewer as a refreshing dose of reality.  Movie reality is usually a carefully woven script of lines that fit nicely together.  Napolean Dynamite is not.  It reminded me of all those times I felt out of place or alienated in high school, unable to say anything intelligent.

I don't have time to read them all but I did make time to watch the movie, which I'm happy to report I survived unscathed (I had my doubts). In fact I think it merits at least 3.5 stars, 1) for daring not to follow a totally predictable formula and pattern, 2) for actors who all deserve a ""thumbs up"", 3) for piquing my interest in what it might be like to live in such a place as Idaho. Regarding the last point, it's always assumed that small-town or rural residents are often aspiring to acquire a more cosmopolitan sophistication, but no one ever considers the reverse. Having grown up near a major metropolitan area however, I'm awed by vast stretches of nothingness, and I dare say I'm not the only one.

1554910,4,B00005JNBQ,"Possibly the best High-School Loser movie ever made, Napoleon Dynamite is a film that you will either love or hate but if you are willing to see through some of the silliness of the plot you will see that this is a movie about connecting with your reality whatever that may be. All of the main characters of this film are highly out of touch with mainstream society and even out of touch with themselves.  In a word they are all loners.  As a wise person once told me ""friends keep you sane"" and these people, without friends, are insane.  Living in the past, online, in another culture or just in some other dimension, they all are living lives that aren't checked by the world that goes on around them. This makes conversation, even between each other, disjointed.  Lost, somehow they come together and eventually Napoleon gets a few friends and begins to connect to some sense of reality. Napoleon's moment of revelation comes when he says ""I don't have any skills. Girls only want to go out with guys who have skills... Ninja Skills, Numchuck skills"" ... etc. Here his friend Pedro finally connects with him saying he has drawing skills (which he barely has) and Napoleon begins to have some sense of direction. The setting of the movie is somewhat absurd.  It is set in rural/suburban Idaho with all of its dreary depressingly out of date architecture, which lends itself well to the out of touch feeling the film seeks to develop.
 Is the movie believable? No.  Is the Movie thoroughly enjoyable? Yes.

So why is this possibly the best high-school movie?  The answer is simple:  everyone feels out of touch to a certain degree in high school.  This movie portrays that vividly and humorously.  It isn't the run-of-the-mill cool people - vs. loser film but a film about individuals against the world.  Seeing the film as something other than a lame joke is key to its enjoyment but is certainly a good film for mixed audiences and anyone who has ever felt out of place... maybe even you.

1555011,5,B00005JNBQ,"Christ, it's hard to spell out what makes ""Napolean Dynamite"" a great film as so many of it's successes are on a visual scale, but here goes:First of all, several reviewers have attempted to justify Napolean and the other characters as being likable on some level. It's my contention that for a movie to work the primary characters don't have to be likable, just interesting: you could make an entire Star Wars trilogy with Darth Vader as the main character and people would still eat that sh*t up. Napolean is definitely not likable in the sense that you would have wanted him as a playground chum in high school, and neither are most of the characters likable in this sense, but herein lies the genius of the movie: you can watch all these amusingly annoying characters from a distance without the burden of having to interact with them in real life. Everyone out there had someone in school who they thought were interesting in one regard or another, but refused to hang out with them because the other 90% of their personality was out of whack, and it's the same principle with watching Napolean. John Heder's characterization of Napolean has to be commended first and foremost. We're never required to feel sorry for Napolean because he never seems to care too much what anyone thinks; life is merely an endless series of inconveniences rather than humiliations. Perhaps it's this lack of need for empathy that leads some reviewers to dismiss the quality of the film, but personally I feel that a viewer who can only get something out of a movie if he/she can directly relate the characters and events in the movie to their own life is missing out on much, not only in the realm of cinema but most likely the lessons of life in general. If anyone is even more of a geek than Napolean it's his brother Kip, who talks with an effeminate lisp and, at the age of 32, is apparently content to live with his Grandma and talk in chatrooms all day. At this it should be mentioned that the chronology of the film is somewhat confusing: 90% of the visual and plot cues would lead one to believe the films takes place in the 80s -- most of the soundtrack music is from the 80s, Napolean's wardrobe is definitely old school, and the appearance and mannerisms of the auxiliary characters have much in common with teen flicks of the 80s as well -- but here and there are sprinkled references that are decidedly 90s in character -- Kip's use of the internet to hook up with his ""soul mate"", for instance, as well as a few other key soundtrack tunes. This isn't a crippling defect, however; there is little about ""Napolean Dynamite"" that strives to be a period piece, and if anything the out-of-touch world of his Idaho surroundings portray an existence that time has, for the most part, simply passed by. Of course, all of this would mean little if the characters were merely left to compete for laughs, but what makes ""Napolean Dynamite"" work is it's perceptiveness. Yes, many of the characters are stereotypes in a fashion, but high school hallways are filled with stereotypes yet to be fleshed out into distinct human beings, and neither is there an adolescent stereotype omitted nor a false interaction between any of them. All of the characters behave toward each other exactly as you'd expect them to, although it must be said Napolean and the rest of the ""geeks"" operate on a slightly more unpredictable scale, largely because they are outcasts living in other peoples' world, and it's not their place to shape events but to react to them. The way that Napolean, Pedro, Deb and even Uncle Rico and Kip adapt to their surroundings may not always seem common, but to the extent that their personalities are developed there is never a false movie between them. The film is mostly episodic, necessarily so as it sets up various scenarios and steps back while it's characters react to them, but as there are no dull moments to wade through ""Napolean Dynamite"" can only be considered a major ""flippin'"" success.",1127952000,,4002,4.678014184397163

It was Beavis and Butthead without the innuendo, a Quentin Tarantino movie without the violence, Southpark without the violence or bad language.

This is the kind of movie that most directors think they need to add sex or violence to in order to make it interesting (which, of course, for any thinking person, doesn't ever work).  Indeed, the only two marginally funny parts in the movie are a reversion to this concept (though quite greatly toned down): the cow shooting/school bus childrens' reaction and the piata.

This film is a video yearbook of high school for the kids who were not the jocks and cheerleaders.  It is not an uproariously funny film, but is such an accurate portrayal of real high school life, with all of the subversive idiosyncrasies of teenagers.  The characters are vibrant and real.  Even the extras wear their personalities and hearts on their sleeves.  The film is obviously a work of love by the Hess brothers and the town of Preston, Idaho.

The emotion it brings up in me is to tell the uncle to stick it and f___ off. So it was not funny for me to see someone get hit in the head. It was not funny to see the bullies abusing people in school, like when Napoleon is knocked against a locker (by a school thug, ironically called a ""cool kid"" by another reviewer) or another student is grabbed by the neck and has his head driven towards the floor like 7 or 8 times.  In my life, I had the school thug/bully grab me by the neck and tell me not to speak to him ever again or he would kill me (and I said nothing to him.)

1555072,4,B00005JNBQ,"This movie caught me by complete surprise.  I was expecting a typical dumb teen flick about a lovable nerd with unfortunate hair, slacker wardrobe, and a silly name reminiscent of Yahoo Serious!, but this film is totally its own animal.  Some reviewers have likened it to a male WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE (far from it) or to early Jim Jarmusch.  It's better, in its own way, than both.

The Jarmusch comparison I get, though you could as easily, and as superficially, compare this film's director, Jared Hess, to fellow BYU-alum Neal LaBute.  Or maybe Hess was influenced by Renoir or Kurosawa or Pasolini, who knows?  (Though clearly not by Tarantino.)  And while it's true that when Jarmusch started his career he tended to do scenes in one long take, with fixed camera angles, mostly (or so he's said) to save money on film stock, and that Jared Hess may have had some of the same budgetary restrictions, I don't think that has anything to do with the way the film was shot.  And I'll tell you why: there is a knowing, almost insouciant intelligence behind the mise-en-scene of every camera angle, and of every action that takes place within each frame of this film.

For example, late in the film there's a shot of a road in Idaho, seen from a distance.  The only action?  A yellow school bus enters frame on the left, leisurely travels through the middle of the shot, then exits.  That's it.  There's no real reason for that shot to be there.  It doesn't further the plot, it does nothing to develop the relationships between the characters, all of which means that technically it's a ""waste"" of film.

So why is it there?  Because when you live in a small town in Idaho (as I have), sometimes watching the school bus go by might be the highlight of your morning.  Some Idahoans (and I expect some Iowans and even most small town Californians or New Yorkers) tend to notice these things.

The shot also runs counter to the usual Hollywood storytelling style, which would go something like this:

EXTERIOR: Road.  A yellow school bus enters then crosses the frame.

  CUT TO:

INTERIOR - The Bus.  Napoleon and Deb are sitting on a bench, too shy to talk to one another.  In the b.g. Summer and her coterie are happily making fliers for the election....(etc.)

By inserting just such an (apparently meaningless) shot into his film, and by playing against our expectations of what cinematic grammar dictates should follow (a scene inside the bus), Hess plays a game with the audience, drawing us in, making us into another character in the story, if you will, because in our forcibly detached observations of the action our minds need to fill in the blanks the way a small town observer with nothing else to do is forced to watch a local school bus until it moves out of sight.  With just one shot (though there are many others like it) Hess has turned us all into denizens of small town Idaho.

What really got to me, though, even more than the throwaway shot of the school bus, or the amazing dance ""skit"" Napoleon performs at the election rally, is the game of tetherball he plays with Deb, the girl he likes, at the very end of the film.

It starts off as a lame, incredibly awkward back-and-forth, as if the two actors had never played the game before.  Or perhaps as if the director could only afford to do this scene in one take and hadn't had time to let the actors rehearse beforehand.  But the way that little game of tetherball ends, and the way the camera slowly pulls back as it builds to that ending, you're reminded of the way N.D. threw Summer's campaign button down the school hall.  He did it awkwardly, yes (which is the way he does almost everything).  But he also did it with all his might.  He threw it as hard as he could.

So as he starts to ""cream"" Deb at tetherball you grin and realize that this scene sums up what the entire movie (and what the character of Napoleon Dynamite) is all about.  He loves Deb, so he starts off playing as awkwardly as she does.  But in the end he can't help himself.  He has to hit that ball as hard as he can.  As he does, Deb ducks under it, a little nervously at first, then with a kind of proud wonder at how hard this boy she likes can hit the ball.  It ends up being an awkward teenage love song and more of a dance of joy than the solo he does at the election rally.  And you don't get that kind of result--that distillation of character and theme into one cinematic moment--by sheer accident or through a lack of money or rehearsal time.

There's a reason this little film has attained cult status.  It's a fine first showing for a very talented director/storyteller.",1126742400,9,4634,4.471990464839094

Ah well, I guess the people who have this misperception hated it so much that they failed to pay attention.

I read in other reviews that only if you studied high school in USA you would enjoy this movie. I am glad to say, that being a Mexican, i enojoyed it too.

I recomend it to anybody who has enoyed ""Lost in translation"", ""American Splendor"", ""The Station Agent"".

1555251,5,B00005JNBQ,"Having no expectations I was pleasantly surprised by the power of this little film about nerds in search of a dream.

Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) is the high school nerd who gets pushed around and taunted by the cool kids. He befriends a new kid Pedro Sanchez (Efren Ramirez) and together they form a union that takes them into the political arena, running for school president against the most popular girl, Summer Wheatly (Haylie Duff). But Napoleon must also deal with his missing Grandmother (Sandy Martin), his nerdier brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) and his haphazardly enterprising Uncle Rico (Jon Gries). With a subdued laugh a minute Napoleon's life is revealed with a bang.

This little film may seem rather dull at first but once the Quaalude induced dark humor of the title character makes his point you will beg for more. Jon Heder is absolutely convincing as the buck toothed, pale and athletically inept Dynamite, just looking at him doing nothing will begin the giggles! Along with Aaron Ruell and Jon Gries you can't ask for a better comedic team to marvel at. Gries gets the gist of the cool nerd down, spending most of his time trying to be attractive but falling far short while Ruell is at an even tie with Heder for who plays the perfect outcast. Under all the humor of course lies the dark life of someone who doesn't ""fit-in"" and in a casual way the filmmakers divulge this side of life without making it so harsh as to make a definite statement, although the point is made within the blast that is Napoleon. Make sure to stay until the credits are run for a short hint about the outcome of all the character's lives. This movie is simply a blast!",1125273600,5,1667,4.628378378378378
1555252,4,B00005JNBQ,"I never really expected to like this film. But after seeing it on Cinamax, I was surprised that I loved it. The movie is pretty pointless but it's still pretty funny and often even heart-felt. Roger Ebert claimed that the movie made no attempt to make Napoleon likeable. Well that's totally wrong. He can be a jerk but he also does some good things in the movie. When a kid gets bullied and picked on in school, he offers him protection from his friend Padro's big cousins. When Padro is running for president and doesn't know he's supposed to do a dance number. Napoleon dances for the audience instead. So what's not likeable about that. If he wasn't likeable then why would so many people love this movie and love the character.

  What makes the movie pointless is that it just ends basically and basically just lives with no plot. His annoying uncle moves in after Napoleon's Grandma has an accident. He hands out flyers to women telling them he can help them get bigger boobs. Which makes people laugh at Napoleon more than they do already. So he wants to get rid of his uncle but he won't leave. Does his uncle ever actually leave ? I'm not even sure. But I can forgive a movie this fun and a hilarious for not really leading anywhere. All the characters are original and funny and they're well played by the actors as well. The best scene is when Napoleon and his brother think they actually own a time machine that will send them back to the past. They just casually try it out like owning a time machine would be normal or possible. I also like the scene where his uncle shows off his throwing arm by hitting Napoleon in the head with a rock lol.",1125187200,2,1656,4.405228758169935

This is a layered, nonjudgmental and sweet story that isn't suitable for those who don't understand the nuances of life. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is an aknowledgement of friendship and the sacrifices one makes for it, of acceptance, as well as a statement that appearances aren't everything.

In the DVD features, the director/ writer explains and shows his senior film project, which was a shorter version of this movie. He says in the voice-over that Napoleon is supposed to embody true friendship (in the film-school film, Napoleon gives up buying a fanny pack, which he really wants, to buy a wig for a Pedro-like character).

I've noticed from my own acquaintances that the people who don't like this movie tend to like movies that are more transparent. But this movie makes you think about it long after it's over - and there are no better stories than those that stay with you.",1125014400,2,1102,4.7591623036649215

I am 20 years old and I am immature. I laughed at this movie until I cried. This movie is the best movie I have ever seen.

Aside from the side splitting laughter, this movie also has it's tender moments. You will probably cry when you see Trisha leave Napoleon at the dance...I did. And when Deb and Napoleon dance together, it just looks right.

It looks at the life of a few teenagers in a small town.  You will recognize some stock characters from your own high school days.  The movie pitilessly shows how small and pathetic these people's lives are.  The only scene with any real interest is Napoleon's dance.  You'll have to watch it to understand.

There are a few humorous lines.  I got a couple of chuckles out of it; but that's about it.  Sort of like shoveling all the horse-s**t to get at the pony that must be in there somewhere.  No pony here -- just one of those orange ""Pokey"" bendy-figures :)

Both are centered around a character conventionally described as a ""nerd,"" ""geek,"" ""dork,"" etc.---adolescent pariahs.  Solondz's however is a far darker vision: he treats all of his characters mercilessly, his knife cuts in all directions and the audience is left squirming and cringing the whole way through.  Hess's film while also reveling in long drawn-out awkward moments, is far more forgiving---in fact, if anything it can be faulted for sugarcoating and copping out with the humorous but implausible happy ending.  Yes there is some amount of self-consicously hip dork-worship but he doesn't overdo it, in contrast to films like ""Rushmore.""

Hess treats every one of his characters gently, even as he teases them and exposes all of their flaws.  We do squirm, but not to the extent that we have to look away from the screen like with a Todd Solondz movie---there is no element of sadism present.  So the gentleness extends to the viewer too.  The whole film is full of implausible and absurd situations, but does it so consistently that it actually becomes almost believable by the end---reminds me a little of the Coen brothers' early work.

One aspect of the movie largely unmentioned is the excellent soundtrack, particularly the ""Music for a Found Harmonium"" by the Penguin Cafe Orchestra which is heard after Napoleon's dance sequence.

This movie is the most stupid movie I have ever seen considering that it is a new release and that some idiots gave a good review for that. No offense but only idiots can rate it as a funny movie.

I was waiting for something funny during the whole movie but unfortunately that ""something"" never happened. There is one idiot guy named ""Napoleon"" who pretends to be a cool or funny guy. In fact he is not! He doesn't even deserve to be called an ""idiot"".

If you don't believe me please rent this movie and decide for yourself! I can tell you, I watched this movie with three other people in the room but none of us was excited about it.

This movie has you rooting for the person that everyone has once in their life shunned or looked down on.

The movie Revolves aruound Napoleon Dynamite, a geeky misfit in his small Idaho town. Accomplied By friends Deb and Pedro Napolen sets out to prove he has nothing to prove. His family is just outragous from a cute sleazy uncle to a bullying pounce of a brouther.

It really has no straight forward storyline. This suits the movie better anyway. It really focusses on the life of this kid showing the person he is genuinley.

The characters are just the funniest. I loved Uncle Rico the best with his sleazy and shotty merchandise.

It rerally is fantastic that the whole town is interesting and it is a part of the States that is not featured much.

A great script, broad characteristics and fantastic actors make this the best Movie of 2004. If your not Clapping to a ceratin dance scene you need to wake up and watch it again.",1122681600,2,1073,4.4213197969543145

This movie is about jokes, the people, and the fact that there's a bit of Napolean in all of this, and that this is reality spat in our faces.

It's an original idea and has a different feel for it than most independent films and is, i grant you, better than quite a few indies, but overall it just WASN'T that good.  If you're one of those people sitting there saying, ""Hey it won MTV movie awards best movie of the year!"" ... give me a break.

The movie is about a dorky teenager living in a small town. He goes to school like any other kid and makes freinds and atempts to get a girlfreind for the Prom and some how succeds in doing so.

Because believe you me, MTV screenwriters are so ultra-slick and hollywood gleaming cool, that they can make such a crappy movie about pathetic mid-west retards, and people will think it's cool. That's just MTV. The humor is the crappiness, see? And you're supposed to laugh. That keeps them in the cool. Because otherwise, well, you see, then otherwise they're not cool. They'd be jerks. But far better for you to think they're cool, so the real jerk will be you, and not them. And then far worse, you can think anybody who actually says this is crap-de-la-crap is a real jerk.

This is a movie about people who are so pathetically nerdy that they are clearly caricatures created by those who seem them as such - yet the caricatures will win over the jocks at the end of the movie - thereby attracting a certain type of nerdy retard wannabe to think it's cool; and that's the jocks turned MTV screenwriter plan, because only somebody as truly pathetic as these characters in this story could like it.

There are no punch lines. No laughtrack. No yelling and flailing of the arms while flying through the air. No... I believe this movie will be universally funny to the general crowd, but to those more intuitive and those who can relate to the experiences of Napoleon Dynamite, you WILL laugh until your gut hurts. I already knew what kind of comedy this was before I saw it, just by seeing the previews. My brother saw it before me, and as I bought the DVD he said, ""Now, you won't REALLY be laughing ALL throughout."" Wrong! This sort of independant film makes seeing a PORTRAYAL of a mannerism we all know about fun and funny to watch, and especially so if it is done accurately. As well, knowing that Jon Heder is just a normal guy in real life makes his portrayal of a geek hysterically funny. Right from the start, it shows him waiting for the bus- just standing there with his mouth hanging open, seemingly only half-aware of the goings-on of the world around him. Right then I almost blew the pop I was drinking out through my nose. To those who get it, this is poundingly-funny stuff.

This is exactly how I felt watching this quarky masterpiece. Don't look for a plot or deeper meanings in ND. This film is about its characters, dialog and production/set design.

I think reviewers are wrong to think of Napoleon as a typical nerd; his nerdness is to such an extreme that it kind of comes full circle and puts him in the cool part of the meter (i.e. something so cold it feels hot). Witness the Jamiroquai dance scene at the end of the film: the students finally see the ""cool kid"" in Napoleon that was just waiting for an opportunity to show he was a guy with skills (personally, I think his dance moves are much better than anything anyone could ever do with nunchucks or a bow staff!)

Pedro is admittedly walking through life on half a pulse, but the friendship between him and ND reveals there is much more to his lifeless exterior.

1555815,5,B00005JNBQ,"Napoleon Dynamite is a unique, quirky, and funny study of characters in a small rural town in Idaho. There's the main character Napolean who exists in the strange world of a geeky misfit, his aimless older brother who spends all day in internet chat rooms, and his Uncle Rico who who basically lives in a van down by the river and wishes he could go back and replay his high school football games. And of course there's Napolean's best friend Pedro whose expectations are unrealistic sometimes.

This movie does not conform to any Hollywood template, and some people will see the humor in it while other won't, in the same way some think Woody Allen is hilarious and others can't stand him. The plot, which is really just a week (or so) in the life of Napolean Dynamite, isn't the point as much as the characters and their relationships and conflicts with each other.

REVIEW:

Dude this movie is so cool!!! I know so many people that hate it which is very understandable. It's a very unlikeable movie, but...GOSH! I love it. I mean, I was watching it with my realitives my aunt thought I was funnier whislt laughing at the movie and my grandpa QUOTE: Where the hell is the damn plot! END QUOTE. But, man...the part where he throws the steak....OHHAHAHA! Where he tosses the action figure out the window! What the hell!? Oh it was awesome. The acting is so great, and the movie gives you a kind of natural high just watching it. It just...ah it makes me feel good inside. This movie shows that we all have a little geek inside of us and it put out a good message too:

All people are different. You don't have to like everybody. But the people you don't like (say, someone like napoleon?) you don't need to give them a hard time about it, just accept people for who they are.

And if you sat after the credits you get to see a little extra scene which, oh my god, is SO FUNNY!!! hahaha

1555875,5,B00005JNBQ,"This is a love it or hate it type of movie - which you will. The point is that is a good movie because people are passionate about it - they passionately love it, or passionately hate it. I fall into the first category while my wife falls into the second.

When I initially watched this film, I had heard my brother in law quote it many times and rave about the movie. I sat through the whole thing and rarely laughed out loud. I just kept thinking, ""Why am I watching this"". Now some people (like my wife) would stand up and find something better to do, but once I start a movie I really like to finish it. Even when it was over I was still thinking, ""Why did I watch that?""

Then about a week later it happened. I couldn't help but laugh as scenes from the show started returning to my mind. I had to see it again! ... and again & again & again. It gets funnier every time I see it and you notice the little things that crack you up more after your fifth or sixth viewing - much like Dumb & Dumber.

What you should have said is ""In my opinion, this movie is by far the most hilarious movie I have ever seen.""

To the person saying ""ignore Ebert,"" Ebert is a great film critic. What you should have said is ""I don't agree with what Ebert said about this movie.""

To the person saying ""MTV ARE CHEATING BA*****S"" and ""TEAM AMERICA SHOULD HAVE BEEN MOVIE OF THE YEAR,"" I say: no they are not cheating, and purchase a dictionary. They don't cost much. 1. Team America: World Police was not one of the nominees for best picture. What you should have said was: ""I think Team America: World Police should have been a nominee."" 2. Why is it cheating when a majority of the public thinks a movie is the best movie of the year and it wins? What you should have said is: ""I don't think Napoleon Dynamite should have won best picture."" 3. Sense is not spelled ""Sence.""

Finally, I say: in my opinion, Napoleon Dynamite is not the great movie some people say it is. It's just not right when a movie about a tall, orange haired nerd filmed during his normal life is given a best movie award over a powerful drama about a blind singer, Ray. This is not a classic comedy. Here is a list of classic comedies:

City Lights

Duck Soup

The General

Love and Death

Sleeper

Sons of the Desert

... Almost none of them have ever been an actor,a director, a cinematographer, or screen writer. Doesn't it strike anyone as peculiar, then, that these men and women consider themselves to be the world's foremost authorities in film-making and dramatic liscense? To put it simply, those who can, do... Those who can't, critique. Perhaps they're just jealous.

Napoleon Dynamite looks at the duller, more common world of teen-aged life. Where ""Sixteen Candles"" took all of the dramatic moments of high school-itis and crammed it into one film, ""Napoleon"" chose to focus on the more mundane, nauseating moments of the coming-of-age years. The main character was an amalgam of those closeted mal-contents of whom we were all critical in high school. And while I agree that there wasn't really a plot throughout the film, neither was there ever any point to what REALLY happened in high school. In that sense, Napolean Dynamite is more realistic than any other film about adolescence that we've been fed over the last 25 years.

I will admit that when I watched it the first time, I was fairly uncomfortable because I just didn't get it. It seemed gawdy, pointless, and a bit disquieting. Almost Immediately upon my second viewing, however, everything began to make sense. The fact is, there was really nothing to ""get."" It was there for pure enjoyment and gave it's audience the opportunity to look back and remember a time when absolutely NOTHING made sense.

In the end, watching Napoleon ""cut a rug"" on stage, I was also filled with a powerful message:  that anyone, even the most unlikely people, can have their day in the sun.

As a side-note, let me remind those meandering critics that there isn't one person I've spoken to(educated or otherwise) who didn't thoroughly enjoy this film.

Well, first off, let me say that Jon Heder did a great job as Napoleon. I mean, this was the biggest nerd in the world. With his red hair, big glasses, big boots and stupid remarks.

He's Napoleon, a nerd in Idaho who lives with his crazy grandma, old and pathethic brother and then his insane oncle Rico. Napoleon gets bullied around, isn't popular at all and only has 2 friends: Deb and Pedro. They are both also neat characters. The movie is often very interesting to watch and really fun. At other times, it seems really stupid and pointless. But, in the end, it was great fun and quite funny actually. Napoleon delivers laughs but I thought that ucle Rico was by far the funniest. He delivered loads of laughs. He is a pathethic man obssessed with eating steaks who thinks that he is the best football player in the world. Even though he isn't at all. Pedro is also very funny as are his mean and tough cousins. The movie has some quite hilarious moments that you'll remember forever. From uncle Rico's behavior, to Napoleon's boots and glasses, to everything else. It's just great. Also, Napoleon's brother is quite funny as is his girlfriend La Phonda.

1556106,5,B00005JNBQ,"""Napolean Dynamite"" is one of those films you need to watch a few times to truly appreciate. A single viewing isn't enough to enjoy this film. You need to see it through once, than watch again. After that, you'll likely enjoy this film forever.

Perhaps what is so refreshing about this film is that it is a teen movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family. The story is fresh and real. One can easily relate to Napolean Dynamite, the lovable loner who is the title character and focal point of the film. You can just as easily relate to Pedro, the new kid in school who Napolean quickly befriends and who becomes an integral part of the plot. All of the characters, with their various personalities and behaviors add to the film.

In the end, you find yourself cheering for Napolean, Pedro, Deb, and the unpopular kids who are often ignored in the day-to-day life of teens. You can easily watch this film and look at the high school you attend or attended, finding each of these characters on campus. You can look around your neighborhood and find an Uncle Rico or a Kip.

The film is a true delight and one that shouldn't just be rented, but purchased. It is destined to be a timeless cult-classic and one for the ages.",1120694400,,1224,4.455357142857143

  Hilarious.

  Wonderfully Original.

There you have the box reviews. Now you will have my review. I want to say two things before I press play on the menu to start the movie - 1. The looping Casiotones rock! 2. I'm afraid this is going to be a movie all about my life.

The intro is pretty sweet. I like the foods idea, my favorite one was the edited Lemonheads box.

Wow... I'm seventeen minutes in and I'm really not sure what's going on other than he's a complete dork. Yes, I am scared, because seventeen minutes in, he is me, only with slightly worse fashion sense, and the jocks never beat me up.

Real quick question - since when do llamas eat ham? I love this. It's weird.... the Dynamites live in the eighties, but at the same time in the naughts. They have the Internet and cool shiny bikes, and it's like he fell out of twenty years ago. I love it!

Tetherball is an awesome sport sometimes, but it helps if you have someone to play with.

I love how Trisha's mom is forcing her to go to the prom! I wish I would have asked someone out that was hot and an overbearing control-freak mother that made her go to the Prom.

Mmmm, Tater Tots. I'm hungry now.

Dance - 80s music rules!!!! (Even if it is Cyndi Lauper. :P)

La Fwanda(sp?) - Eww, what an ugly girl! (I've not made it far enough, but I am guessing that she is going to turn out to be a he.) (Well, I guess I was wrong)

I just now officially saw two movies in a row with a sai involved (Elektra). Jennifer Garner I trusted to have some, but Napoleon Dynamite? Yikes!

It's amazing what a change a slight makeover can do. Kip looks relatively cool, yet still dorky as a biker dude. Napoleon should do that. I'm a little shocked at how normal he actually looks. (Jon Heder that is)

Well, this is ridiculous type funny. You'd think I would have gotten that before I rented it, but that's okay.

I am bursting out with laughter right now watching him dance. He does so much better than I ever could!

Overall, pretty good movie. I might buy it someday.",1120608000,,2117,4.25062656641604
1556188,5,B00005JNBQ,"Napoleon Dynamite is the name of this movie AND the lead character depicted on the front. What IS this movie?Well,like 'Seinfield' this is a show about nothing. None of the events have,or are ever designed to have any significant social meaning. It's the story about a painfully mundane small town social outcast Napoleon who lives with his 32 year old brother Kipling,thrill seeking grandmother and is visited by his screwed up uncle Rico.

  His school chum is the kind but empty headed Pedro who's actions actually constitute for some of the films better moments. Even Napoleon's various attempts to find a girlfriend.

Events such as Pedro's funny wig and bizzare attempt to become class president,as well as Rico's equally eccentric money making scemes produce some funny moments.

  Also Kiplings HIGHLY unlikely 'internet girlfriend' Lafawnda and Napoleans highly skillfull dance during Pedro's campaign,in winter boots no less are also great chestnuts. And of course this dance came about due mainly to a 'D Qwuan' dance instruction video purchased at a Goodwill. As you have noticed this is a very offbeat comedy because there is no real point to it all-all the characters are so painfully ordinary and yes-almost boring that their very dullness is what is so humerous.

  It's a film made up of very funny moments and even if many of the lead characters (namely Napoleon and Pedro) are certainly not the sharpest tools in the shed they both have big hearts and try to do their best. And if this movie has any point at all it's that no matter how unattractive you or your general demeaner are (such as is the case with Napoleon)that if you try to care about others around you that you will do okay in the end.",1120521600,,1718,4.832764505119454
1556189,4,B00005JNBQ,"This movie reminded me of a 5-star movie, ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", because of the colorful characters, strange family situation, western location (ND takes place in Idaho) and even goofy name. It didn't have quite the acting caliber (although Jon Gries turns in a great performance as Napoleon's shady Uncle Rico), but a lot of creativity went into this story about those awkward teen years in a typical American High School.

The first part of the movie introduces the characters and their ideosyncracies and is a bit slow-moving. I found it to be very funny and careful not to be too over-the-top, e.g., the antagonists (mainly Uncle Rico and the popular gang at school) aren't portrayed as being the personification of evil, just annoying to Napoleon and his friends who are potrayed as average, nerdy high school kids trying to survive. They've all developed worlds of their own in which terms they frequently express their thoughts, e.g., Napoleon talks about needing ""great skills"" to get dates with chicks and how his favorite animal is a ""liger"" which is one he himself invented.

The second part of the movie is the making of the class Presidential candidate, Napoleon's friend Pedro, who is the most unlikely of candidates. Newly-arrived in town, about all Pedro has going for him is that he's the only guy with a mustache in school. He's up against Summer, the most popular girl in school played by Halley Duff, who seems to hold all the cards. While I refuse to give the outcome away, I will remark that Napoleon plays the biggest part in the wacky outcome of the election.

I was a little bit confused as to when this was taking place. My wife, who watched it with me and also enjoyed the film, kept pointing out the 1980's styles and music which seemed to make sense, but Kip has a serious online, chat-room relationship with his girlfriend which is definitely post-1995. This doesn't detract from the film much - they played ""Time After Time"" at the dance, one of my favorite '80s duets.

It's refreshing to see a movie which involves kids without a lot of extreme grossness or with the kids being engaged in any type of vice other than some bullying and insults. There are some extremely funny scenes involving feeding the pet llama, jumping bikes and drawing less than flattering pictures of the girl you want to date. All the characters in the sub-plots enjoy happy endings, including the notorious Uncle Rico - there's no nasty revenge which sets this film apart from a lot of goofy high school flicks.",1120521600,,2527,4.775743707093821
1556190,1,B00005JNBQ,"I was always a firm believer in the quote ""millions of people can't be wrong"". That is until I saw this movie. Apparently, everyone giving this movie 4-5 stars are all wrong. To me, it seems people say this is a good movie b/c its the cool thing to say. I thought the mannerisms of Napoleon were annoying, and if he were in my school, I'd kick his @ss too. If you have poor taste in eclectic comedies, then this one is for you. However, if your looking for intelligent, offbeat comedy, I would highly suggest ""Dead Man on Campus"" and ""Necessary Roughness"" as two of the more popular films in the genre.

P.S. The only vote for Pedro should be for Pedro Martinez, to the all star game.",1120348800,4,684,4.3023255813953485
1556191,5,B00005JNBQ,"A large number of people apparently hate this movie.  How can you hate something completely original?  If you're going to hate something, at least hate ""From Justin to Kelly"" or ""Spy Kids 3D"" or ""Monster-In-Law"".  I understand not liking it.  I didn't like the original ""Matrix"" when it came out, but I gave it originality points at least, and I understood why people might like it.  ND is assuredly NOT the worst movie ever.  I happened to like it very much.  It's surely quirky, and it's pretty deadpan.  I've read two reviews already that disagree and that name ""Airplane"" as real deadpan.  Well, you can define it how you want, but I'd call ""Airplane"" and ""Holy Grail"" (both great movies) more absurdist and silly than deadpan.  The ability of the characters to keep a straight face and of the film to feign seriousness is not necessarily deadpan in my book, but ND, on the other hand, takes itself absolutely seriously.  There is no implied wink-wink at the audience.  Others who've defended the film, and some who don't, are right to say that there is nothing to ""get""; it just is.  ND exists in an absolutely serious world not very much unlike our own.  That world, inasmuch as it's a mirror of our own  and expertly highlights certain quirky, hilarious aspects of it, makes for an engrossing little film that simply cracks me up.  I suppose that if you can't find anything recognizable to relate to in ND, then maybe you won't ""get it"".  Or maybe you're just being stubborn.  The reaction to ND reminds me of ""Titanic""--most everybody liked it until it became a cultural phenomenon, and then there was a big backlash, especially from those who saw it after everybody else, in the post-phenomenon stage (usually on the recommendation of people who saw it pre-phenomenon).  I'm not ashamed to say I liked ""Titanic"" a lot when I saw it (opening day), and I loved ND just the same.",1120176000,5,1885,4.674772036474164

This movie is much funnier when remembered and quoted the next day.  My children are still quoting this movie many many weeks after having seen it, and I suppose that some of the funnier lines will become a part of their standard vocabulary.  We have all spent hours laughing with tears in our eyes from quoting various lines (there are WAY too many hilarious quotable lines to even start listing them), and it is surprising how many of them are applicable to life's everyday circumstances; just try to have a bad day after someone hits you with a Napoleon quote, it's hard not to laugh, especially if both of you have seen the movie.  Monty Python movies (particularly Holy Grail) are the only things that come close to Napoleon Dynamite in the ""quotable"" category.

Finally my brother went out and bought the DVD.

What a complete and utter waste of my time.

I wanted to shut it off less than twenty minutes into it, but I kept watching it hoping that something...ANYTHING...would be in the least bit funny.  Never happened.  However, there were several times when someone started to say something that sounded like it was about to be kind of funny...but then the movie would cut to something else.

The movie isn't even slightly entertaining, either...it's dull and pointless.  There's no plot at all, horrible acting, and all the main characters act EXACTLY the same...dull and emotionless, with absolutely no distinction between them.

I don't know...maybe I just don't get the humor, but to me, watching some clod with a squint breathe heavily into the camera after saying some stupid thing that everyone's going to repeat while his effeminate brother and sleazy uncle sell Tupperware doesn't really tickle my funnybone much.

This movie is called a ""deadpan"" comedy?  No.  Monty Python is deadpan humor.  Leslie Nielson is deapan humor.  This movie is devoid of anything even remotely resembling humor of any kind.  Basically, this movie is what you get when a lot of really untalented people get together and make a comedy without really trying.

I think this movie was trying to pioneer a new style of comedy...and I really hope it doesn't catch on.  I don't think I could handle another movie like this without assaulting anyone and everyone who had anything to do with it.

1556406,4,B00005JNBQ,"I must say...what type of sad world do we live in where someone can simply post a 1-star review of Napoleon Dynamite, say nothing more than ""This is the worst movie ever! It wasn't funny at all!"", and get a ""4 out of 12 people found the following review helpful""? Has our intelligence and patience really sunk THIS low?! Come on! I know this movie isn't for everybody, and has a style of humor that 1/4th of the people who see it won't get, but seriously! People who post reviews like that are the main reason why this movie shouldn't have become popular. Back when this was still a semi-obscure indie movie, everyone who went out of their way to see it loved it, but now that it's popular, the average mainstream moviegoer/MTV whore is just going to think this movie is ""weird"" and ""pointless"" (If you need proof: Notice that 90% of the negative reviews were posted after the movie skyrocketed in popularity). If you've seen this movie multiple times, have tried to ""get it"", and failed, then that's okay. But if you're just a mindless basher who knows nothing about deadpan/oddball humor...then I'm sorry. I can't respect that at all.

That being said, Napoleon Dynamite was one of the best movies of 2004, besides Collateral and Kill Bill: Vol. 2. At a time where Hollywood has sunk to an all-time low with their endless inferior remakes of classic films (Flight Of The Phoenix, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and nonstop streams of comic-book movies (The Punisher, The Hulk), this delightful indie movie was a gigantic breath of fresh air (and a gigantic slap in the face to Tinseltown's big budget sets and plastic actors). I remember seeing this movie in theatres in July 2004 (before it became really popular) with my equally geeky friends, and accidently spilling my coffee all over the floor from laughing so hard.

Set in the semi-rural town of Preston, Idaho, Napoleon Dynamite is the story of a ranting, nerdy teenager who's simply trying to deal with his crazy life, both at school and at home. His 32-year old brother Kip is obsessed with chatrooms and his internet-girlfriend (as well as ""becoming a cage fighter""), his grandma loves riding dune buggies, everyone at school doesn't know what to make of his bizzare set of interests (martial arts, computer hacking, U.F.O.'s, ""Nessie""), and to top it all off, there's a new kid at school named Pedro who just moved there from Tijuana! Luckily, Pedro's friendship may be all Napoleon needs to help turn his life around.

The end result is 89 minutes of quirky, off the wall humor that you could previously only find in Election or Rushmore. The film turns into a showcase for rookie talent, as Jon Heder & Aaron Ruell are great as the nerdy Dynamite brothers, and first time writer/director Jared Hess gives the movie a deliciously lo-fi feel.

The dialogue alone is something to be marveled at. Like one of my friends said: The ""memorable quotes"" (...)to have the entire script of this movie. Much like in ""Office Space"", pretty much every line is up for grabs, from ""Go make yourself a dang quesadilla"" to ""You guys are retarted!"" to ""Your mom goes to college!"". If you're in high school, you've probably heard (or been bombarded with) these quotes for the last few months, so why not take the time to see the movie that spanwed them?

The only real flaw I see with the movie is that even with the added epilogue, and the deleted scenes...it's just too friggin' short. But what counts is that it's a great ride while it lasts...and it feels far fresher than any other movie I saw last year.

I could only guess that those who grow up in urban or suburban settings see less of the sort of inarticulate, unsophisticated kid that Napoleon is and find the character lacking credibility and cannot empathize with him to any extent. Of course, this is a character in a movie that can be categorized as a ""quirky comedy"" so he's about 30% more dorky and inarticulate than the worst of what I grew up with but he's close enough to the real thing not to be a parody or caricature.

The movie doesn't really have much of a plot but seems more to track a segment of Napoleon's life. Napoleon is awkward, unattractive, and expresses himself in socially inapproriate ways. He's like a 10 year-old stuck in a 16-year old's body. He copes with his lack of ability to relate to others by attempting to form friendships based on very little communication and by drawing fantasy characters of his own invention. The viewer gets the feeling Napoleon isn't quite self-aware enough to be too bothered by anything but is old enough to have certain impulses (like the desire for a girlfriend) that he acts on.

The interesting thing about this movie is that, despite his awkwardness, you don't feel sorry for Napoleon because he doesn't feel sorry for himself. He also doesn't seem to get very angry at the injustice of being placed low in the social pecking order or being randomly hit and harrassed by his schoolmates. For the most part, he simply does his thing. It's not that he's oblivious to what is happening, he's just coping in the only way he can and most of those efforts are what are funny about the movie.

This isn't a movie with obvious or broad humor. It's the antithesis of humor based on wit or clever dialog while not being stupid humor. It's humor much in the same way that ""Lost in Translation"" was a romance. It defies categorization and may or may not be everyone's cup of tea.",1119225600,6,2266,4.492718446601942

The plot, in a nutshell, is...well, there really *isn't* much of a plot.  The film follows a few days in the life of Napoleon Dynamite, uber-geek.  He lives with his grandmother and brother, Kip.  When Grandma gets hurt, Uncle Rico moves in to take care of them (even though Kip is 30!).  Meanwhile, Napoleon befriends the new kid at school, Pedro, who is also a misfit.

I've only seen the film once so far, but I'm sure it will be even funnier the second time because the first viewing is spent ""taking it all in"".  It's very odd, and very funny, and I lost count of all the great quotable lines in the film.  Another thing worth mentioning is that they could show this film on network television without editing anything -- there is no foul language or content that would be inappropriate for young viewers.  I'm not one of those ""holier than thou"" types (who, quite honestly, I loathe, because they tend to be hypocrites), but as someone with a family, I can appreciate a film we can all watch together.

In a time when the big studios of Hollywood fear originality and rely on cheesy remakes, a movie like Napoleon Dynamite provides a breath of fresh air. It's just a hilarious film that's hard to explain. The best you can do is just to tell others to see it. Normally when it comes to things of this nature when I fall in love with a movie, I usually contribute it to my own weird tastes. After all my two favorite heroes are Ernest P. Worrel and Pee-wee Herman. But no, I've come to find there are thousands of fellow Napoleon Dynamite fans out there. The official Napoleon Dynamite fan club itself has over 200,000 members!

His grandma rides a dune-buggy and owns a llama!  You just can't get any more 'out there' than that!""

Please.  Napoleon Dynamite is as ""quirky"" as the Wall Street Journal.  It was distributed by MTV, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Viacom, perhaps the most powerful media conglomerate in the US.  If you want to see a movie that humorously plumbs the essential strangeness of the human condition, try David Byrne's True Stories or the first two Christopher Guest films (Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show).  They're not flawless, but they have heart, and a genuine point of view.  They are the real deal.  Napoleon Dynamite is a pale imitation; a 60-year-old CEO's concept of ""one of those nutty indies the kids seem to like.""  And so many people fell for it.  Sad.",1118361600,7,1067,4.717391304347826
1556688,5,B00005JNBQ,"Many people say they hate this movie. They say the humor is not funny, and then they go on to cite the scenes in the movie that are not funny. For instance, the scene where Napoleon fails to make the bicycle jump and hits his crotch on the bike frame. I agree, not one of the scenes that most people reference as jokes are funny. It's not meant to be funny. It's meant to be nostalgic.

The opening music, ""We're Going to Be Friends"" a sentimental piece about childhood by the White Stripes sets the nostalgic tone for the entire movie. Every scene from the credits onward is meant to evoke sympathy for the main character, not humor. It would be hard stretch for anyone to think that getting hit with food is the pinnicle of comedy. However, to anyone that was alienated in high school, getting hit with food was just one of the things you had to put up with. Seeing Napoleon put up with it in a dignified way allows people who were in his position reclaim some of their own dignity.

All throughout the movie Napoleon is faced with situations that would make most people cry. He perseveres and stays true to himself, just like he tells Pedro to do before the class president speech. It is this process of taking comfort from bitter situations or even courageously quipping a one liner in the face of dehumanizing alienation that gives this film its infectious charm.

If you go into the movie prepared to laugh at Napoleon or anyone else in the movie you will be sorely disappointed. To really find humor in this movie you are forced to find humor in your own past alienation. Unfortunately for some people this is too difficult to do, and they come away from this movie dissatisfied. Those who are able to laugh at themselves will find this movie to be satisfyingly bitter sweet.",1118102400,21,1782,4.493827160493828

I heard this movie was about a boy struggling to be himself in a world full of the same.  When I watched, I found no evidence of the boy struggling at all.  Even if this wasn't the true plot of the story, the movie followed little plot at all.  There were a few funny parts in the movie, but none were wonderful enough to make me laugh out loud...and I laugh a lot!

Halfway through the movie, I became bored.  There was no substance to hang on to and the main character was too awkward and lost in his own world to even follow.  I couldn't figure out what he was thinking!  Did he like the make-up selling girl or did he not care about her at all?

""Funnier than Monty Python and the Holy Grail."" And I thought, wow, if it's funnier than Monty Python, it is a must see. Oh, how dissappointed I was...

The story begins with an extremely nerdy kid walking onto a school bus, where he then shuffles wierdly to the back of the bus. A kid waits for him. When he sits down, the kid asks, ""What are you going to do today, Napolean?"" to which he replies, ""Whatever I feel like, god!"" My friends laughed hysterically at it. I, however, did not.

Now, often, when I told my friends that I really didn't like the movie Napolean Dynamite, they were in shock. They'd ask why? Hmm...Well in all honesty, I don't know. It might be because I could be an old, cruel, mean fart who does not enjoy other people having fun. It might be because...Well, just because. But I honestly don't think that those are the cases. I think it's because I just didn't find this deadpan comedy funny. I'm more into the dark, subtle humor that takes time to appreiciate and recognize.

But alas, it seems to be just me that did not like the movie Napolean Dynamite. I give the creators five stars for truly making an original film, but I give them a very kindly one star for making the original film that sucks on the whole.

Clearly, Napoleon Dynamite has escaped a lot of the independent film traps that make them so slow and amateurish. The question then is what makes this such a great film? First, there is the main character Napoleon Dynamite, a perfectly cast nerd who possesses a steely integrity and loyalty to his friends, which makes him sympathetic. This quality is necessary for the film's climax which you'll have to see for yourself. Secondly, the film does an excellent job of capturing innnocence. There is a purity to Napoleon's character that is infectious and endearing. This quality defies those critics who accuse the film of having no heart. The next great thing about the film is the hilarious anecdotage. The writer/director draws from his life in Idaho to create one comic scene after another without trying to be funny. Napoleon's droll, intense expression as he tries to navigate through girls, his competitive brother and his charlatan uncle is classic.

One of the wonderful things about this DVD is the director commentary where scene by scene he shares his life experiences and explains how they informed his film.

So what if MTV Films was a part of this, it's a great movie. I even find people hating this movie quoting it, which is something that is pretty interesting.

If you're looking for a meaningful movie though, you'll be dissapointed. There is like no real point to the movie, although I find that to be part of what's so great. The title character doesn't reveal it, but he's quite skillful: Good artist, dancer, and used it as part of the support to vote for Pedro, someone he had met from his school when he had first came to the school. A part of this movie involved with Napoleon & Pedro is in my title of this review.

He lives with two people: his computer-loving cousin who is almost thirty and his total jerk uncle. The former character falls in love with a woman, Lafawnda, and the latter tried giving friend Deb some shampoo, which dissapoints her, although they do end up doing a dance together for the prom.

He busts his moves more than anything for the class president thing, which resulted in Pedro's victory. It is part of what's really cool, I thought, along with a speech saying that ""all of your wildest dreams will come true"". I mean, who wouldn't vote for that.

The greatest thing though about this movie is that it's like a home-made video in many ways, although the whole thing is completely acted.

Hilarious).

We all have been there.  High school was uncomfortable enough, but the kids who were die hard goofballs, and they didn't even see it in themselves, were the ones that had it the roughest.  The main 3 main characters in this cute little movie were those kids we all new in high school.  The sweetness of this movie comes from how their friendship develops and where it leaves them.  If you read into it, it tells us the story of by sticking and working together, we can overcome everything. If we have hopes and dreams, they will come true. We should all be so lucky to have friends like Napolean, Pedro, and Deb.

Throw in the equally goofy secondary characters, relax,and take this movie for exactly what it is, you can have a laugh riot.  This held true even for this forty-something and her husband.

Finally, what I loved about this movie is that I didn't have to be afraid to watch it with my 15 and 9 year old sons.  Our 15 year old appreciated it because he's currently living it, his mom and dad appreciated it because they have lived it, and the nine year old loved it just for its pure goofiness.  No swearing, no sex.  Just a good time, with a really sweet ending. Catching bass and chatting online with babes all day could possibly fulfill our dreams.",1116892800,8,1799,4.363363363363363

Before I purchased the DVD to watch with my daughters, I heard so many people saying ""it has no point."" Yet, I found it to have not just one but several quite hard-hitting foundations. Rex Kwon Do, the quintessential martial arts sensei sums it up at the trial lesson...""at Rex Kwon Do, we use the BUDDY SYSTEM. No more flyin solo...you need somebody watchin your back AT ALL TIMES!"" Following that day, we see the ""buddy"" system come together as three loners start watching each other's backs.

I knew Napoleon, Pedro and Deb in high school. It's all about the buddy system, someone getting your back, and you getting theirs.

There are so many quotables it's hard to start. Every character comes to life and even Rex Kwon Do and the greasy Uncle Rico are able to work their way into your heart. We've watched it maybe ten times so far! The seventies retro stuff is absolutely a scream if you remember it.

Jared Hess has created an interesting film with the very essence of the ""indy spirit"" yet with the unusual ability to go mainstream. Napoleon is a classic comedy with a heart that will  cross generations. And how refreshing-they pulled it off in 2005 without one curse or profane word, without sex, and no violence!

Oh, and let those credits roll-don't turn it off. You'll never forget ""The Wedding of the Century.""

Thanks Jared and company for a wonderful and meaningful film. You broke new ground with Napoleon.

The disappointment of the movie not being so great was bad enough. Then everybody around school starting quoting the movie constantly, which got really annoying.

I was definitely not in the popular crowd in high school, I just kind of existed.  But I remember kids taking beatings and abuse all the time for just being themselves.  Napoleon is just such a character.  His hair looks like he hasn't brushed it in years, he openly breathes through his mouth annoyingly, he stores the cafeteria's tater tots in a fanny pack to eat later in class, he has terrible glasses and answers every question seemingly with a mini tantrum, as if it was the stupidest question he had ever heard.  This attitude, along with his appearance, make him a complete loser in school.

There isn't much of a storyline, just Napoleon's interactions during the film with some weird characters.  His brother is a chat room addict, his uncle can't stop thinking of 1982, when he was a high school jock and just missed on his big chance, he has a new friend at the school, a mexican student named Pedro, who is just as quiet and withdrawn as he is.  Eventually Pedro will decide to run for class president and Napoleon will help him.  This brings about the only semblance of a climax to the film, but otherwise, it is just Napoleon and ""the lovely state of Idaho"" on display here.

This is not a bad film.  It is not great, at least not to me.  I teach in a high school now and saw the movie basically because my class talked about it all the time.  I can't say that I know any Napoleons at the high school I teach at, but he's probably there, calling everybody an idiot and going outside to feed his grandmother's llama.

 From the Happy Hands Club, down to the ""Go Ask Alice"" posters on the walls, and the principal whose more concerned about piatas representing real people getting beat up than the real people getting beat up, this is real high school life, not Hollywood fantasy world.

 This movie is funny because it's true.  It also hurts a bit how true it is.  You can't just sit and laugh through this movie.  You can laugh but you have to feel for Napoleon; sympathize with him, be proud when he succeeds.  This should happen naturally, and if it doesn't, you're probably just another Summer.

The story here is that Napoleon is a high school student who seemingly gets no respect.  He makes friends with a hispanic student who transfers in and a girl who one day tried to sell him crap.  After his guardian gets injured in a ATV accident his Uncle moves in to care for them, and all he can think about is a get rich quick scheme.

1557130,1,B00005JNBQ,"On the surface it is a comedy of the ""pick on the nerd"" variety. But really it is an emotional showcase of why kids that are typically defined as losers are that way. I cried because the way that kid grew up is terrible. His parents are either dead or deadbeat(it is never fully explained), he lives with his grandma and his 32 year old brother, and he is constantly ridiculed. It is not his fault that he acts how he does, it is a result of an upbringing where no one ever told him ""I love you"". He does dumb things that people make fun of him for, but those actions are the product of a terrible childhood. Walking out of the movie theater, I wanted to verbally harass all those people that were making fun of his actions and words. Was it a funny movie? Yes, but it made me sick to laugh at such a poor human being. The movie was definately in the vein of Wes Anderson films. I would have thought it was a Wes Anderson film if it were more somber and less ridiculous in some parts. It was very reminiscent of Bottle Rocket and I wish it was more somber so people would not take it at face value and mock the poor kid. This movie should have been about feeling bad for Napoleon but instead it was laughing at Napoleon. There did not seem to be much emotional growth at all for any of the characters in the movie and that left me disappointed. If the director really cared about the characters he would have edited everything into more somber, less over the top scenes. Also, the bonus extended ending, while funny, was also too over the top.

1557131,4,B00005JNBQ,"Granted, this ""revenge of the nerds of the millennium"" is NOT for everybody, but I'm certainly one of those who find it funny as hell, and a tad charming.

For one thing, it takes time to warm up to this film. A lot of really strange vignettes happen in the first half hour that really don't make a lot of sense (our man throwing a toy with a string on it out of a school bus window and watching it drag along the road, a farmer shooting a cow (offscreen, thank goodness) for no apparant reason, Napoleon and Pedro's female friend shyly attempting to sell Napoleon some junk, etc). Plus, the actors playing Napoleon and his best friend Pedro Sanchez look WAY too old to be in high school.

But after you sit through this with some patience, the ""story"" begins to hang together. Bascially, it's a really SWEET (as Napoleon would say) story of the bonds of friendship being established among social outcasts. Also, it's chock full of wild catch phrases (such as the title of this review) with deadpan delivery that you can't help but shout out at repeated viewings.

Of course, there are bound to be ultrasensitive over PC need-to-get-a-life types who will criticize this movie for some ethnic stereotyping. Here I refer to Pedro Sanchez himself and his admittedly hackneyed Mexican-American accent, Pedro's lowriding (apparently) gangbanging cousins, and LaFawnda, the Detroit ghetto queen who Napoleon's brother falls in love with over the internet. As an African-American myself, I would have to say that this is not ""Soul Plane"" or the ""Frito Bandito."" These characters are likeable people who, beneath the superficial cultural differences, anybody could relate to. Plus, LaFawnda (unlike the overtly ghetto fabulous/slum pitiful sisters of UPN and BET) has a touch of class about herself and a good heart (in her advice to Napoleon in particular). As for Pedro, he's a fish out of water that is also a very sympathetic character.

But overall, anyone who has ever felt like they've been on the outside of humanity looking in (and who hasn't felt that way from time to time?) could realte to at least something this film, so see it. There's a reason why so many people are wearing all those ""Vote For Pedro"" t-shirts. After all, you too could drink whole milk if you wanted to!

Napolean lives with his grandma and ver weird brother Kip who is like 30 and goes on internet sites all day. Kip wants to get into Karate and wants to start. Then later Napleon becomes friends with Pedro and Deb. Pedro and Deb are nerds to but Deb knows she is nerdy. The popular kids at the high school are kind of nerdy two. Everyone is really stupid but smart. Later on Napoleans uncle moves in after there grandma had a accident. He was a football god and wants a time machine to back to 82. Then his Uncle and Brother sell stuff and make very little money and even sell stuff for breast enhancements. Napolean gets crushed at the prom after the girl leaves. Then his brother falls in love with a Foxy sista from Detroit. And at the end they get married. It was a great movie. I watched it 3 times,1115942400,2,1037,4.138613861386139

The dry comic tone is nice in the beginning, the problem is that NONE of tha characters are likable. Yes, Napoleon is a goofy kid who gets picked on alot...are we supposed to like him and identify with him because of that?? Or are we just supposed to laugh at him for being so nerdy? This movie never develops the main characters, we never see them happy! How can we root for a character if we have no idea what they want, where they're going, or what makes them happy???

The jokes in this movie might work in a short film or a 3 minute comedy sketch, but drawn out over 90 minutes they just fail to work.

Rather than laugh AT the characters in this film, we should feel like we're rooting for them. Take a television series like ""Freaks & Geeks"" - it took geeky looking kids, revealed their hopes and dreams, and you end up identifying with them.

In the end, this basically serves as a comedic film for meatheads to laugh at people different from them...and its ok, because the geeks in this film have no emotion and they're not like us! Shallow, superficial humor for shallow minds.",1115856000,6,1269,4.3872340425531915

1557135,3,B00005JNBQ,"Napoleon Dynamite will be remembered far into the future. By some, at least, to whom this movie will sit comfortably alongside similar ""cult"" type movies. Others-most, I'd suspect-will watch it and wonder what all the fuss is about. And so, you must ask yourself: what group do you most likely fall into? Are you into the cult-type films? Or more mainstream than that? Your answer to that question probably answers how you'll feel about this movie.

The main problem with the movie, it seems to me, is that it isn't really about anything in particular, plot-wise. Rather, it's a collection of character sketches, loosely tied together by a plot that feels tacked-on because the writer realized that he needed a plot of some sort. Whether Napoleon's friend Pedro does, or does not, win his election (which provides the climax to the movie), is almost completely irrelevant to the film as a whole. Except for the cool `Vote for Pedro' shirts that some people wear now, the election could have been totally removed from the film and I expect that it would seem basically the same. It could also be said that ""Napoleon finding someone to connect with"" is also what the film is about, but really, it's not. That may or may not happen over the course of the film, but Napoleon's character is, himself, so lukewarm about his relationships that it can't really provide a focus.

As a collection of character sketches, the movie is hit or miss. A lot of the characters are very broadly drawn and seem cartoonish. The tone of the film, itself, is not cartoony or slapstick or absurd-it seems to want to portray reality in some way. And so the characters and the film appear to clash at times, providing an interesting if slightly disturbing experience.

And so: why will this film achieve cult status, and why is it so popular? Because the main character sketch-Napoleon Dynamite, himself-is brilliantly conceived and flawlessly executed. Otherwise, this is not particularly a great film, per se. The story is inconsequential, it teaches little to nothing, the writing is average, the direction forgettable, the acting passable to silly, etc. But what it does do is it creates an Icon. Napoleon Dynamite will be remembered because the eponymous character will be remembered. Napoleon Dynamite is a nerd protagonist, but (and strikingly different from the norm) he is not a hero. He really isn't even likable, and is kind of a jerk. Vastly different from, say, the Tri-Lambda house, who were nerds out of a sense of self and integrity and ""being who they are,"" Napoleon is the way he is either out of a philosophical myopia or, because strangely, he's trying to be cool. He's kind of like an arrogant jock character in that he looks down on most people; they differ because 1) no one agrees with Napoleon's sense of the cool and 2) jocks are strong enough to enforce their ideas and Napoleon isn't. Of course, underneath his (ineffectual, funny) bluster, we can see that (just like most of the arrogant jocks) he suffers from low-self esteem and looks for others approval to validate him. That's why he lies about things like ""hunting for wolverines."" In short, Napoleon isn't a movie-nerd, heroic and decent, just misunderstood; he's a real-nerd, struggling and sometimes self-loathing with a patina of false-pride. We have, all of us, known a Napoleon Dynamite at one point or another in our lives, and we've always wondered: why? This movie doesn't ever really answer that question, but it does show us enough reality that we have some evidence upon which to guess. And that's pretty cool.",1115856000,2,3581,4.857610474631751

Just the sort of transparent, sophomoric drivel you'd expect from the director of a film whose horse-power (or Pegasus-power, more likely) is a high-school weirdo that sketches mythic beasts and fancies himself a paragon of athletic prowess on the tether ball court.  What semblance of a point that exists revolves, presumably, around Napoleon's home-life - with 32-year-old brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) training to be a cage-fighter and human steak-vacuum Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) - and his social-life with Hispanic friend Pedro Sanchez (Efren Ramirez) and shy glamour-shot photographer Deb (Tina Majorino).  On the domestic scene, Napoleon clashes bitterly and dorkishly with his Uncle Rico who is there to baby-sit him and Kip while Grandma is in the hospital.  The myriad of pseudo-plots include Kip's online love affair with LaFawnduh (""Well, things are getting pretty serious right now, I mean chat online for two hours every day""), Uncle Rico's torture over what could have been if Coach had only put him in for the Fourth Quarter back in '82 (""I'd have gone pro in a heartbeat, I'd be makin' millions of dollars and livin' in a big ol' mansion somewhere""), and the high-stakes, fast-money business of Tupperware (""Ya see, this ain't your run of the mill crapperware"").  Socially, Napoleon conspires to have Pedro Sanchez elected class president despite the efforts of the popular blonde Summer.

Neither artistic nor anti-artistic, the film simply defies categorization.  Stupid, pointless, and totally lacking in anything resembling a redeeming quality, yet hilarious.  Yes, this is a funny movie after all.  Plot is hardly the point where Napoleon Dynamite is concerned, nor is creativity, unity, or anything else.  In fact, the absence of such things is the point itself.  Could anyone other than Heder have played the part so successfully?  My guess is no.  The actor appears to be exceptionally tuned into the awkward, shameless expressions, posturing, and utterances of the dorkiest of High School dorks.  The type of kid who couldn't say a cool word if Dean Martin himself rose from the grave and took a leisure stroll over to his house to give him a free lesson.

Don't be surprised to see this one turn into a cult favorite, encouraging ""Happy-Hands Clubs"" the way Chuck Palahniuk's novel/movie inspired fight clubs and rivaling Caddyshack as a veritable reservoir of hilarious quotables.  Well, maybe not that big of a cult hit, but still.  The downfall being, of course, the obnoxious little dweebs that once championed the speech patterns of Beavis and Butthead and Ace Ventura who will now almost certainly deliver a Napoleonic corpse to an early grave because of their constant mimicry.

My theory is that the people who were popular in high school are the ones who hate it and those who weren't, love it.  It's often the popular kids' stories who get told, but this film is narrated from the perspective of Napoleon Dynamite, one of the truly original characters in the history of film.  The conventions of film narrative are secondary to characterization, but the film does not choose to portray the conflicted lives of the hotties, but the tortured lives of the high school B crowd: Napoleon and his friend, Pedro, and love interest, Deb, are all strangely peculiar but also representative of the communal ostracism suffered by the unpopular kids in almost any American High School.  The film starts with the hilarious image of the stoically individual Napoleon and just gets funnier and funnier as we get to see all the offbeat mannerisms that make him who he is: he curses the popular kids who taunt him with an exasperated, ""Geez!,"" he is blissfully unaware of the existence of fashion, he seems dimly aware that he is somehow the object of ridicule at the school, but does nothing to alter that perception.  As viewers, we are not laughing at his expense, but at his total lack of inhibition to express himself exactly as he is, not as who he thinks others would want to see.

There were a couple of funny spots in the show, but it is certainly not one that I would recommend. I really thought that it was a total waste of 90 minutes.  Do yourself a favor and get something else instead.",1115596800,10,442,4.214285714285714

1557284,3,B00005JNBQ,"It appears high school hasn't changed much for social misfits since Carrie burned down the gym or even since Jan Brady didn't make the cheerleading squad. The primary goal of this breed continues to be to find acceptance among peers they have empowered to be their superiors by the will of their own self-consciousness. Napoleon Dynamite is merely the latest incarnation in this 2004 MTV-produced comedy. The movie has nice visual touches (like the food-oriented opening credits) and some funny moments, a few even inspired (the sign-language version of ""The Rose"", the chicken farm scenes). It's also admirable that director Jared Hess (who co-wrote the movie with his wife Jerusha) goes neither the smutty nor the slasher route in drawing viewer attention. However, your enjoyment of this film will depend strictly on your ability to relate to a series of episodes that play out like one of those 1950's education films on how to behave on a prom date but reset to present-day, small-town Idaho. For me, the plights of the title character and his friends Pedro and Deb just aren't interesting enough to hold my attention. Accentuating the void is the fact that they are called upon to look very stilted and speak in deadpan, monotone voices. While amusing for about five minutes, it stretches an 86-minute movie into something that feels interminably longer.

Jon Heder certainly looks the part of the supreme geek outsider with his red `fro, aviator glasses and polyester prom suit. But his character is simply not fleshed out enough to root for his success, as he avoids eye contact when he talks and encourages the abuse he gets from the more popular kids. As Napoleon's new best friend from Mexico, Efren Ramirez plays Pedro, who has no qualms about asking a popular girl out or running for class president. Former big-time child actress Tina Majorino (she was the little map-tattooed girl in ""Waterworld"") portrays Deb as a painfully shy girl who fancies herself as an Annie Liebowitz-type of photographer. They're all quirky enough, but you simply pay attention to these characters because no one else will. Usually someone like Napoleon would have a successful big brother to taunt him, but instead we have 32-year old Kip played with equal deadpan style by a pale-white Aaron Ruell. Kip spends most of his free time in online chat rooms and ultimately has a fanciful romance with his cyber-girlfriend, Lafawnduh. In fact, if you wait for the ending credits to finish, they even have a pastoral wedding. While the idea is funny, the ludicrous nature of the relationship feels overly contrived. Providing more honest laughs is Jon Gries as the moronic, self-proclaimed lady-killer Uncle Rico. With his 1980's-style toupee and constantly flexing his non-existent muscles, he lives in past gridiron glories that probably never happened, even buying a mail-order time machine to transport him back. His new career selling Tupperware makes for a couple of funny scenes.

In fact, there are several amusing ideas, but they don't seem to add up to anything that memorable by the poignant tetherball-swinging end. One almost longs for the return of ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Sixteen Candles"". Even the climax is oddly unfulfilling as Pedro's presidential aspirations hinge on Napoleon displaying some pretty impressive dance moves to a song by Jamiroquai. The DVD includes four deleted scenes and a black-and-white short called ""Peluca"", which stars Heder and provides the basis for the movie. There is also audio commentary by the director, Heder and producer Jeremy Coon. This is the first time I encountered a DVD that uses both sides to provide the full and widescreen versions, but it also means you need to flip your disc to see all the features.

1557404,5,B00005JNBQ,"I'd been hearing about Napoleon Dynamite for some time and finally at the urging of one of my friends, sat down and watched it. This film is definitely a sleeper, you will need to watch it multiple times to truly appreciate it. Jon Heder does a bang-up job as Napoleon Dynamite, a not so typical nerd. Napoleon lives with his brother and grandmother who is injured early on in the film during a ATV accident. Enter Uncle Rico who comes to look after the boys during his grandmothers absence. Uncle Rico is stuck in the year 1982 his football glory years and cannot get past the fact that he was on the bench during the State Championship. He's pretty much Matt Foley in other words he lives in a van down by the river. Napoleon and Uncle Rico clash from the get go to hilarious results. There are some side-splitting scenes including the time machine bit, throwing the button and Napoleon's lament over not having any skills that girls would find attractive (""I don't have any good skills...you know like nunchuck skills""). When a new student, Pedro Sanchez, enters the school, Napoleon befriends him and the rest is history. Not much happens during the running time of Napoleon Dynamite but ultimately I could not keep my eyes off it. Heder does such a fantastic job as the main character that we are left wanting to know more about him. The dance sketch following Pedro's speech was no less inspirational than Rocky taking Apollo Creed to the brink in the original. Napoleon Dynamite celebrates diversity and leaves the viewer with a great almost simplistic message...it's not what you look like on the outside that matters, it's what's on the inside that counts. This film is nothing short of a diamond in the rough. A Must-Own addition to your DVD collection. Highest Recommendation.",1115251200,4,1787,4.7491961414791

Actually the nerds come out on top at the end and that made me happy.  I can't explain the affection I have for this movie, but apparently the majority of people who see it feel the same way.  A guy named Napolean Dynamite??? now that in itself is funny.  I don't usually like comedies - I prefer drama or action, but I watched this one with my teenage daughter and like it so much I watched it 3 times!!  Unheard of for me.  It is well worth the money to buy it.  It will become a cult classic!  p.s.

1557406,4,B00005JNBQ,"After seeing so many negative reviews, I had to chime in on this one. This isn't so much a review but a commentary on why or why not someone would love or hate this film.

Napoleon Dynamite is not a ""fall on the floor laughing"" movie. In fact when I saw it I didn't quite look at it as a comedy at all but, just a commentary on life, and how one kid deals with life day to day. I'll have to say most people that probably love this movie were Napoleon or Deb to some extent. Those who werent, or who lived in a more city environment or who were the popular crowd, or jocks, just don't get this I'm sure. Thats not to say they are bad or any such thing, just that you have to have lived in some capacity as Napoleon to get the humor and the wonderful comment on society this film makes. With that in mind I have recommended it only to people who I knew were like that and would enjoy it, and once you sit and see it for what it is, it really is nostalgic.

You see a regular guy trying to deal with reality with some fantasy escapism, but still taking care of everything he must do to get by in reality. Napoleon's sarcastic attitude to people is hilarious, and I remember having the same thing. I remember wearing helicopter t-shirts, and making boondoggles, and crappy school food, and having only one friend in junior high(because of transferring mid-junior high from another school, much like pedro) and just trying to make it and to be a friend to someone and to offer your ""skills"" whenever it was possible.

If you walked this road in the late 80s - early 90s you will love this movie because it brings back all those possibly painful but great memories. It made me look back and reflect on what got me to where I am today, now married and in a successful career. It made me remember how I dealt with those awkward times growing up.

Napoleon Dynamite is a fine movie, though not one I would consider a strict comedy. Call it a documentary in the life of awkward school kid nerdness, and how you can rise to a challenge.

Believe it or not unlike most here, I didn't once find myself wondering why the movie lacked a plot. It just worked.",1115251200,3,2143,4.229828850855745
1557407,2,B00005JNBQ,"Napoleon Dynamite, starring Jon Heder as the title character, is a comedy that is completely reliant upon ""This is so stupid it's funny.""  Now I consider myself something of a stupid-humor connoisseur, laughing (and laughing frequently no less) at movies like BASEketball, Dumb and Dumber, Scary Movie, There's Something About Mary, etc.  However, the difference between those movies and Napoleon Dynamite is that those movies make attempts at a plot, or at least a clothesline to hang jokes on, and they set up their jokes.  In most comedies there is a set-up and a punchline, and the audience laughs.  In Napoleon Dynamite, there's only stupidity, and the audience is expected to laugh regardless.

It would be one thing if the movie at least bounced all over the place, so that even if a viewer like myself found some parts of it dry then at least there would be other sprinklings of humor to choose from.  Unfortunately, the movie also finds repetition funny.  Napoleon saying ""Gosh!"" ad nauseum or his uncle repeating over and over that ""if Coach would have put me 4th quarter we'd'a been state champions for sure"" is not humor.  At least the uncle gets credit for being remotely animated, as most of the characters- Napoleon, his brother, Pedro, and Deb speak in monotones for almost all of the movie.  Again, this is apparently funny.

Unless you like 90 minutes of stupid sketch comedy (with no plot that's is exactly what the movie feels like) then avoid this film.  Unless of course you need to know phrases like ""I caught you a delicious bass"" to make conversation with middle school boys. 4/10",1115078400,7,1605,4.821167883211679

1557410,3,B00005JNBQ,"It's always funny with cult films. Everyone seems to like them and you watch them and you have no idea what the big draw is. Many times I've rented a movie simply because it was named by certain people has the best movie of the year or one of them. Yet I watch it thinking when's this genius supposed to come through?

Napoleon Dynamite(his real name apparently) is one of those nerds that you can't really imagine other nerds thinking he's cool. He talks in a very deadpan way, has a bizarre family and has curious habits such as eating potato tots he stuffs in his pockets.

The main plot from what I can tell is one of his friends(should I say one of his only friends) is running for class president which isn't even introduced until a good halfway or so in. So Napoleon wants to get him to win only they have to compete with Summer, one of those so popular for doing nothing girls that are in high school hallways.

Then there's his bizarre brother(?) who spends a lot of time chatting to his woman on the internet. There's also his uncle who has some weird money making idea all the time and is one of those relatives that embarasses you just by being themselves.

The acting isn't all that bad. I actually liked 2 of the girls: Deb who plays Napoleon's sort-of love interest and Summer, played by Haylie ""I'm Hilary's sister"" Duff. As for our main guy? Well if it was his job to sound bored he certainly nailed it. His eyes tend to be slightly closed half the time and he speaks in a drawling voice even when he's mad. And it sounds like he overacts to certain scenes, especially when there's something that upsets him.

I can't explain it. People love the film, others like me watch it and go ""huh?""",1114905600,,1706,4.352201257861635

It seemed like it was just a bunch of slack jawed vacant eyed losers standing around for an hour and a half. However something within me said to go back and watch it again, simply because everyone had said it was so brilliant. I rarely listen to anybody on matters of taste but I decided to re-watch it because the movie was already sinking it's tentacles into me.

It became better and better with every watching. I don't know how it does it...but that's the effect it has. All I know is I swore I'd never watch it again and now I own it.

What this movie really is is an atlas of the lost types of people that exist in dullsville towns like Preston Idaho. It captures the ennui of these places and takes you into the mind of a weird dude who is a non conformist in a cornfed place where this is in new way a good thing. All of the people in this movie are lost, even with those who are supposed to be cool had a somewhat desperate and pathetic feeling to them. You know that as bad as they can be they'll wind up stuck in this village for life living off their faded glory like Uncle Rico. But then it was easy for me to feel that way living out West. Summer Wheatly may rule Preston high but she would be just another person at the school dance here in California. See the cartoon 'Totally Spies' for any further information on the types of uber preps we have in this place.

It's also a great freakshow. Napoleon with his tot obessions and bo staff skills, Kip and his internet stalking, Pedro and the holy chip scene that never got put in but should have and above all...REX KWON DO.

A great 'loser' movie. Like if Beavis and Butthead were brought to life and then somehow made into even bigger outcasts than before. But I can't give it 5 stars because it like it's setting seems lethargic. You will root for Napoleon and Pedro but the popular crowd (aside from that bullying skinhead thug Randy) seems more dumb than evil. Oh well, it's a still got alot of mocking value and I will re-watch it.

1557496,4,B00005JNBQ,"4.0 to 4.5 stars.

I have a hard time giving out 5 stars to a movie because that means the movie pretty much achieved perfection, whether to me personally or in the grand scheme of moviedom.  However, I do think that the makers of Napoleon Dynamite had goals in mind with this movie and I think they achieved those goals in making a very entertaining movie.  For a lot of people, acheiving your set goals can mean perfection.  For reaching those goals, I think it means they put out a darn good movie.

This is definitely a character driven, as opposed to a plot driven, movie.  The characters and the actors that play them stand out and make the scenes memorable.  None of the characters seem to be like anyone I know, yet I can see a lot myself and others throughout bits and pieces of everyone.  Maybe that makes it hard to specifically identify with them but I did like that even the ""mean kids"" weren't as mean as Hollywood likes to make the bully.  And the ""good kids"" weren't as pure and infallible on the other end.  And because the extremes aren't so far apart, it doesn't put characters far out of reach for us, in spite of their quirkiness.

The script is simple but well written and although there really aren't any punchlines, the ""jokes"" are buried in layers and require multiple viewings to catch them all, whether they are spoken or visual.  And the movie provides plenty of lines that are quotable in everyday life without being filled with innuendo or questionable language.

Finally, I have a theory about this movie.  Most of the characters are in High School, but are really stuck at the stage of life they were in during 5th grade.  Whether it is what they eat at lunch (tater tots), the things they are into (bikes, not cars), the drawings, the ninja stars, etc., I see myself at age 11.  Maybe this isn't even the filmmakers intention, but look at them with this point of view and see if you enjoy the movie even more.

In all, they have pulled off making a film that appeals to a wide range of ages.  It isn't for everybody, like any film, but it has broad appeal for a lot of viewers.",1114473600,3,2110,4.40826873385013

One reason many people down this flick is because they don't connect the scenes the way they connect themselves in the director's mind. One has to actually think, ""Aha, so that happened because this happened,"" and not worry so much as to why the scenes seem unrelated.

Another reason this flick gets thumbs down. It's too close to something that could actually be real, that would actually happen. Napoleon and his family, although disfunctional, are really quite normal. Only some of their odd traits are exaggerated for humor, making them seem unreal at the same time.

1557573,4,B00005JNBQ,"One of the more absurd movies of the decade, Napoleon Dynamite nonetheless manages to be a hilarious comedy in its own right. Featuring a unique brand of alienated-teenage humor, the film relies more on its well-timed pauses and character body language than on zinging one-liners. If you enjoy its subtle humor, then Napoleon Dynamite is a film you'll find utterly hilarious. Otherwise, it might cause boredom or outright confusion. The film has a near non-existent storyline, but what it lacks in plot, it makes up for with its witty and hilarious comedy sequences...

Jon Heder plays the title role of Napoleon Dynamite, an estranged and nerdy high school youth living with his grandmother and older brother, Kip (Aaron Ruell), in Preston, Idaho. Sporting a clueless, unchanging facial expression throughout the movie, Napoleon simply glides through life, getting kicked around, pushed into lockers, and watching life pass by. When a Spanish student named Pedro (Efren Ramirez) moves into town, Napoleon befriends the social outcast. The two drone on and on about myriad subjects, such as who to take to the upcoming dance. Fellow socially-challenged student Deb (Tina Majorino) becomes the object of their affections.

Meanwhile, Kip trolls the Internet chat rooms in search of women, and Napoleon's Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) moves in with the boys while their grandmother is away. Uncle Rico's own exploits add to the hilarity of a film with little in the way of substance, at least until Pedro decides to run for class president against the school's most popular girl, Summer (Haylie Duff). Now, Napoleon and Pedro must work against all odds to win the school election...

The true strength of Napoleon Dynamite is its clan of outrageous characters, characters that are so outrageously ridiculous that every viewer can point out the mirror image of that character from his own high school yearbook or current life experience. The arrested social development of Napoleon and his friends are amplified for effect within the film's context, drawing the viewer into a Lord of the Flies world of Darwinian adolescence. The humor is sometimes subtle, and Napoleon Dynamite is not to be confused with an Academy Award winning drama. But if you like stupid movies such Dumb And Dumber, then this is the film for you.

Napoleon Dynamite is a unique comedy which pushes the boundaries of plot-challenged, immature filmmaking. In short, you'll love it. Most of the characters are so pathetic, you'll find yourself laughing at them simply because they exist. One of the biggest surprises of 2004, Napoleon Dynamite is an oddball comedy that definitely ranks as a must-see movie...

1557575,1,B00005JNBQ,"Ok, I missed this release at the cinemas, but everyone that I knew who wanted to see it went on about how others who saw it found it really funny and how much they wanted to see it.

Comes the release on DVD and I get all excited, time to sit down and check out this laugh-a-rama. Grab some ice cream, grab a comfy chair and wack in the DVD.

What can I say, there is absolutely nothing funny about this particular movie (Tell a lie, there is one scene that almost got a smile out of me when Pedro smiles towards the end...possably becuase it is the only emotion that looks genuine) least in so far as I am concerned. Apparently there are people out there who enjoyed it (And yes you may be such a person) but for myself, the humour value just didn't exist.

So to be fair, who is most likely going to enjoy this movie? That's a hard question to answer becuase I missed the point of it all, based on the type of person who I have spoken to who did get a kick out of it, it appears that those who belittle Hollywood (Such would include people who prefer the original foreign produced film over the Hollywood remakes of such films for no other reason than it wasn't produced by Hollywood), who believe in the good fight against commercialism (the fact that there are vote for Pedro t-shirts available leaves me wondering though) and that no independant film can do any wrong would be the key audience that would find this particular movie enjoyable (Rise up and rebel against the mainstream). Perhaps my enjoyment of this movie was dampened by the fact that I do not view myself as elitest with a need to prove my intellectual superiority or perhaps it is due to my wide ranging enjoyment of movies (Yes...I watch most films that hit the cinemas were I am, many of which are bad (Ugh...only thing worse is seeing a bad movie in a bad cinema that smells), some that are good and I have been doing so a few decades now so yes, perhaps I am just jaded).

If your aged 10-16 (Which fits the age group of the majority of viewers who said to me it was funny), chances are you may like it as you sympathise with Napoleon Dynamite and his dreary life. Fans over this age bracket seem to be more in line with the anti-hollywood crowd, many of which took great pleasure in pointing out that fact.

If you don't like deadpan humour (chances are you won't even spot the humour if this is the case), this film is a definite miss.

If you think your smarter than the average Joe, then hey, maybe you will get something I certainly didn't and you'll love this movie.",1113868800,14,2549,4.3
1557576,4,B00005JNBQ,"I had been putting off seeing NAPOLEON DYNAMITE until very recently, having heard negative reviews such as Roger Ebert's about this movie.  However, I saw the cover of the DVD and thought that it might be one of those ""quirky"" movies that sometimes surprise you.  I was right--but NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is that and so much more.

Some reviewers have suggested that the viewer's enjoyment of the movie is derived from looking down on the protaganist and his relatives and friends.  Yes, Napoleon is something of an oddball, gawky and socially awkward.  However, HE doesn't see anything wrong with himself--in some ways, he's actually quite self-assured, as when, early in the movie, he proclaims that he can ""do whatever (he) wants to do--GOSH!""  And while the eccentricities of Napoleon and his circle may be exaggerated, the film, I think, does make the awkwardness of adolescence that is exacerbated by the social mores of high school in a small town beliveable and relatable--I mean, most of us in high school weren't the ""cool"" kids--maybe not ""geeks"", either, just the vast majority in between.  Napoleon's strength is that he has accepted himself for who he is, although he is sometimes self-deluded (who amongst us wasn't, during high school?).  Thus, I enjoyed the movie because I DIDN'T have to look down on Napoleon and his family and friends--they were just different characters, different kinds of people.

Some reviewers also have suggested that there is no plot to the movie.  I disagree, and suggest that there are several plots running through various parts of the the movie:  (1) How will Napoleon and Pedro find dates for the big dance?  (2) Will Napoleon's brother Kip find his ""soul mate"" on the internet?  (3) Will Uncle Rico get his comeuppance?  (4) Can Pedro really win the election for class president?  (5) Will Napoleon and Deb express their feelings to each other?  And the big plot:  Will everybody find a Happy Ending?

In response to those who feel that the movie is meaningless, I believe that Napoleon sums up the movie's message in one line:  ""Just listen to your heart. . .that's what I do.""  And he does--he lives his life his own way, and he follows his feelings to help his friend Pedro when he really needs support.  He even listens to his heart to catch ""a delicious bass"" for Deb, to express his feelings (in a weird way, I'll admit, but a way that's true to himself) to her.  The thing is, Napoleon may be awkward, socially inept, and sometimes clueless, but he isn't a phony.  Sure, his thoughts are filled with fantasy, but he doesn't betray his true character to ""fit in"" with everybody else.

Speaking of true character, take for instance the big school dance.  Napoleon had the courage to ask the ""cool"" girl, Brittany, to the dance, even giving her a portrait that he drew for her.  When it looked like he might miss the dance, he began running the who knows how many miles to her house to meet her.  Yet, she ditches him as soon as she can.  Sure, she didn't want to be there with him, but he sure made the effort to be there with her.  And while the movie didn't make the common mistake of making the ""cool kids"" irredeemable jerks like in other ""coming of age"" movies, the remark by Summer during her campaign speech against the Hispanic Pedro about not wanting to have  ""chimichangas in the cafeteria"" leaves no doubt as to who the good guys are in this movie.  Also, to conjecture on why the reticent Pedro would suddenly decide to run for class president, I imagine that he may have been a big shot at his previous school in Mexico, but now he's in an alien environment, speaking his second language, just trying to fit in, when he sees the opportunity to reclaim his self-esteem.  The movie doesn't elaborate this point, so I'm just guessing.

Geez, I didn't mean to get too deep with this movie, which is really a very funny comedy.  While most of the humor comes from the ""ah-hah, I can relate to that"" mode, I found the bicycle jump, the chicken farm, and the time machine sequences to be side-splittingly funny.  A lot of the humor is also generated by the eccentricities of the characters themselves.  Kip is obsessed with internet dating.  Uncle Rico is trapped in the year 1982 by his supposed glories on the gridiron.  Pedro cuts off all of his hair.  And Napoleon is Napoleon.  But the filmakers don't go for the easy, obvious laughs.  For example, my wife and I were sure that Kip's ""soul mate"", Lafawnduh, HAD to be a transvestite--we were conditioned by Hollywood movies to expect this ""surprise"".  Yet, the surprise turns out that this little independent movie has the balls not to follow convention and take the easy way out to cheap laughter.  There is no profanity, no sex, no graphic violence--Gosh, not even any flatulence jokes!!!--the humor in NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is truly well-earned and natural, and much the better for it.

Sorry to have gone on so long about this movie, but I really enjoyed it immensely and HIGHLY RECOMMEND it.  It's not quite in the class of such classic comedies as THE PRODUCERS, DR. STRANGELOVE, or SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, so I'll strictly grade it at four stars (I would actually give it four-and-a-half stars, if I could).  But to find such pleasure in a film that was shot for $20,000, produced for an additional $20,000, then wowed the audience at Sundance, grossed over $40 million at the box office, and is doing gangbusters on its video release, makes NAPOLEON DYNAMITE a treasure by any measure.",1113868800,4,5496,4.701882845188284

1557702,5,B00005JNBQ,"Fantastic movie. Although made on a low budget, it combine fantastically unrealistic characters and makes the film into a lovable sequence of hilarious events. Highlights include: the Uncle Rico sequences; when he first meets Deb selling beadwork so she can go to college (your mom goes to college!); and very best the ending dance sequence. It has also sparked many catchphrases repeately heard around the high school, including ""Whatever I want, gosh!"" and ""Tina, you fat tub of lard, get some food!"".

  Along these lines, I also think that this film provides an intersting look on society in general. After I saw this movie, I went to school one day and saw the star football player and the blond cheerleader going down the hall saying ""Frickin Idiot"" and other miscallaneous ND sayings, and I just thought ""This is the most ironic thing that I've ever seen. These popular kids are quoting quotes from a movie all about nerds getting beaten up and made fun of every day, and they think it's cool. meanwhile, in the same school, I can name 2 or 3 kids that are being bullied and harrassed right now."" I think that this shows how some people can think that they believe in a subject or idea, but it turns out that they are just pretending. These homecoming king and queen don't care about the nerds at my school-they just like watching people like them in movies. Also, some of these reviews say things like ""After I saw the movie the 4th time, it started to get old"" Well duh. Then they would give the movie a 2 and write it off as another stupid comedy, when it is actually a fantastic work of art.",1113350400,3,1602,4.555555555555555
1557703,3,B00005JNBQ,"Yeah above in my title I mention my theory's name. Ever watched a house fly at work? It keeps bashing on its own head with its legs. And thats pretty much all it does except when its dead. The nerd soul that resides in Napoleon Dynamite is something similar. He has a few chosen interests and his life activities revolve around absolutely nothing. He seems like a new born with his ""I do not gain anything from what happens around me "" self.

When the movie started , It was difficult to believe such a character. For some reason I wanted him to change and be a little *  * i don't have the word here.

Anyhow,overall this movie can be exhaustive for some. There was no scene I found funny and I'm not a serious guy really. It's just kind of sad,especially. It started at around 5AM in the morning.

What I liked about the film was the sincere effort in portraying the lives of a nerd and the lack of activity. Pedro's good. I think the dance (solo) was quite interesting. It makes me want to be a dancer. Many reviews back on amazon I'd read this movie is nothing like ever shown. I thought it actually must be something that nooone has ever made. Now that I've seen this film , its just there looking me in the face with its ""burn into obscurity"" effect.

Too bad , I can't find a valid comment to sum it up. Watch it,if you think beyond numbers and alphabets.",1113264000,,1362,4.243243243243243
1557704,5,B00005JNBQ,"Preliminarily, I had mixed feelings about this movie. First of all, I was skeptical about watching a movie (especially a comedy) with a ""PG"" rating; this rating struck me as representative of a ""children's comedy"" which, if anybody agree's, are typically underachieving, and undisputedly appropriate for the audience which the rating merits. Myself knowing a few of the ""nerds"" during high school, this movie acts as a magnification of reality, but in a way that doesn't seem too overbearing. I would like to go over a few of the elements which I thought maximized the overall motif that the movie was aiming to create: that theme being, perhaps, a mixture of ""nice guys finish last"" and ""save the world, lose the girl"" (Napolean saves his metaphorical world without actually losing his flame ""deb"")

First of all, the perpetuation of Napolean as a stereotypical nerd is a reoccuring element throughout the course of the film. Everybody remembers their high school years with the ""nerds""; the implicit construction of Napolean Dynamite as a nerd is by no means conventional. Napolean doesn't need a keyboard and a computer screen to be a nerd. So, if you are expecting a reincarnation of ""Revenge of the Nerds"", don't be too surprised when viewing ""Napolean Dynamite"" when quite the opposite is true.

Second of all, the Characters surrounding Napolean Dynamite are all basically characterized in the same way that Napolean is. This is what perhaps adds a little more humor to the movie. Some of the other ""Peeps"" (not a term actually used in the movie, but somewhat relevant to Napolean's colloquial context) that add the most humor to the film are: Napolean's ""sidekick"" Pedro, Napolean's unconscious crush Deb, and his (much) older brother Kip. All of these characters have their own little quirks that just seem to place them apart from the crowed and label them as ""nerds"". My personal favorites were Kip and Pedro. Pedro is so monotanous that he almost begs to audience to put words in his mouth. What was somewhat ironic to me was that he was initially built up as a character who doesn't seem to have very many interests and who appears to be a recluse. However, he quickly turns around and wants to become the class president by the middle of the movie. Kind of a bizarre twist of events and mentalities if you ask me. But then again, this movie didn't make the kind of money it did for it's lack of plot. Which leads me to my next point.

This movie has little to no plot. Don't get too excited Seinfeld fans; this movie has a somewhat weakened plot which is organized just enough so that the viewer doesn't feel the need to turn it off about 5 minutes into it. When I was watching the DVD's extra features, there were a few scenes that were deleted and the express reason (at least what the director's commentary stipulated) was that some of the more descriptive scenes ""didn't fit"". This leads me to believe that the director(s) didn't really want a plot because a plot, in my opinon at least, would have made this movie too boring. Besides, I think that the monotony and spontaneity from which the ""events"" transpire is somewhat hilarious in and of itself.

One more thing worth mentioning.... The Music. Simply hilarious, is all I can say. I liked it so much, I downloaded the album from the Itunes store. The best thing about the music is that it is so tacky, and deviant that it contextualizes the movie in a manner that could not be achieved with ""conventional"" music. The only song that I caught that was conventional was the White Stripe's song that is played at the beginning of the movie. The music almost sounds like something you would hear in a cartoon or videogame from the 80's (I'm assuming that in order to create the ultimate setting, the directors chose this type of music, especially the song that's played during the school dance) The music is corny; but then again, what would you expect from a movie about a bespectacled nerd who draws ""Liger's"" and fights imaginary metaphysical creatures?

So (in the spirit of Hollywood) here are the overall ratings for the movie (out of 4 stars):

Comedy: ****
Characters: ***
Plot: **
Music: ***
Overall: ***

Yeah, I thought this was a kid's movie at first and that's what initially turned me away from watching it. True, it's not the crude nerd movie that was ""Revenge of the Nerds"" but I think this is a more scaled down (albeit more exagerated) contextualization of what it's like to not be ""popular"" at High School. Agreeing with some of the other reviewers, I think that Napolean is the type of nerd other nerd's look down on. Maybe you can look down on him laugh at him too. I and everybody else I know sure got a kick out of the movie.",1113177600,2,4716,4.674698795180723

I couldn't pin point why I thought I had some deap cosmic connection to this movie, I wasn't from Idaho, I was popular in high school,I am a female, never worn moon boots....was it just the good herb that night?

I started reading more about the movie and the writers to discover that they as well as Napolean (Jon Heder)  are LDS (mormon)....that was the connection! Even though I have long since been excommunicated, that is what made the movie make perfect sence to me. Remember the, singing sign language scene? If you were raised Mormon you too know one song in sign language, we all learned it, performed it.....come on sing along .....as I have loved you....loved one .......but I digress. Not that others won't love this movie just as much if they never were LDS....just gives me more inside appreciation for Napolean.

1557707,5,B00005JNBQ,"The above quote should alert you as to the type of quirky dialogue you'll find in this special, and rather precious, movie.  I think the best word for Napoleon Dynamite is ""endearing"" as you have no idea in the beginning how much attachment that will be formed between the viewer and characters like Napoleon, Pedro, and Deb.  It's not your typical coming of age film as it's set in Idaho and none of the actors are glamorous in any way.  Regardless, there are qualities displayed with which we can all relate.  It's a well-directed movie as not a moment is wasted and even the music is purposeful and excellent.

I've noticed that the people who make the biggest deal about it, wearing tshirts, reciting quotes, etc., were the people who liked the movie simply because of the frequent usage of the phrase ""freakin' idiot"", and tater tots. The ones who didn't really talk about it much were the ones with more of a grasp for the ""whimsical"" logic of ""Napoleon Dyanmite"", and the ones who appreciate the original sense of humor in the movie. The movie really has no plot or meaning, and most older adults would probably utterly despise it, or maybe just dislike it. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is also, in my opinion, not a ""kids"" movie in any way. I know too many small children who refer to the movie as ""a really funny movie with tater tots"", and too many kids and teenagers who enjoy the movie because of some of the pretty dumb quotes, often misinterpreted. Although the movie is appropriate for all audiences, I believe that basically the only person who can truly enjoy this movie is a geek, such as myself, or just someone with a somewhat logical appreciation for the past, and good sense of humor.",1113004800,,1258,4.6968325791855206

Besides the occational ""GOSH!"" or something similar from Napoleon they stayed pretty subdued. There wasn't enough vareity in there for me. Put sleepy performances with the little to no plot this movie has and it was all just to downplayed for me.

Jon Heder is magnificent as Napoleon and Jon Gries gives a great performance as Uncle ""Rico"". All charcters seem very lifelike as if you deal with them everyday. I think everyone can relate to one charcter or another in this film in one way or another. That's what makes them so likeable. All jokes are in clean taste, very basic but very funny.

The only reason one would label it a comedy is because it makes you laugh.  But no, comedies make people laugh because it takes a certain level of understanding or logic or knowledge to understand the jokes they make.  They are funny because of irony, puns, hints of stupidity and sometimes crudeness.

This is not funny because of irony, puns, crudeness or just hints of stupidity (while some may argue that the film is just stupid).  It is because of the personalities contained in the film.  The way John Swihart molded these characters is a masterpiece.

It is not only pure genius, capturing flawlessly the daily life of your average nerd, it is my bible, my bible in motion. I love everything about this movie. The subtlety of the humor is absolutely brilliant. I don't think that there are many who can't identify with at least part of this poor boy's struggle with the social scene. We have all felt like outcasts at some point, therefore each and every one of us seems to understand, if you have the mental capacity, the tragedy of Napoleon's situation.",1112140800,,640,4.672566371681416

Actually, one thing I loved about this film is that even though it shows really, really weird people (every single person in the movie except for Deb), it's never mean.  It is funny in its own way, without trying to mock a given genre or time period.  It's never profane or lewd, and best of all, it's just plain weird itself.  I can honestly say that I loved it.",1112054400,,424,4.2625
1557859,5,B00005JNBQ,"I avoided Napoleon Dynamite in theatres, put off by reviews such as Roger Ebert's.  When I finally did give it audience, it was in some hotel suite in LA, a soft robe, a few chuckles, then room service came, my girl came out of the shower, Napoleon went off, and I made a hazy mental note to give it a fair shot at some point.

So, to speed things up a bit...the second time I thought it was very funny, the third time, funnier (and I don't mean just in retrospect, I laughed harder, and enjoyed it more).

I've seen Napoleon like 20 times...eeezy!  It's going down in my regime of cult films with the likes of Office Space.  And, much like Office Space, it's no epic; there aren't any deep moral lessons to be had, any detailed historical accounting that will firm up your academic understanding of our place in the world.  Nope, just a concentrated dose of nostalgic hilarity.  Not in the sense that I wish I could be in High School again, or back in the 80's (a period that this film spoofs heavily), but more in the sense that it reminds you of simpler times and simpler concerns.  Nerd or not, most every reader cared deeply about the opinions of others then, about who they'd take to the dance, about whether they'd have to do ""all"" their chores (like feeding ham to their pet llama Tina).  I think if this movie - which is so oft accused of being devoid of plot - were to be forced to offer up some kind of lesson, or value, it should be just that:  it helps take our constellation of todays problems a bit less seriously by reminding us of how trivial yesterdays problems were.

Plus it's got some sweet scenes!

I'm sorry, but even if some disagree with my premise regarding this films value, how could anyone not find this movie flippin hilarious.  Napoleon Dynamite is NOT slapstick, it's infinitely less obvious.  That fact makes it harder for most to find the film immediately hilarious, but after a viewing or two, when your brain has ample time to digest the enormous volume of absurdity and texture, I think a good number of those who panned this film would be turned around.  This movie is an amalgamation of the High School experience, consolidated into various archetypes, then amplified to an extreme.

Flippin awesome!

If you don't agree with me, you should eat a decroded piece of crap!

Enjoy,

My friend was telling me how hilarious it was in theaters so I decided to wait for DVD to see it and saw it once and thought it was ok.  But I watched it again with some bros and it grew on me.  Its totally a movie to discuss afterwards and reminisce on the funny parts.  Classic part:Steak to the Head. Watch the movie and you'll know what i mean.

Possibly the worst writing ever as well, the characters go nowhere.  You see them throw footballs, sell tupperware and dance in the auditorium.  This film offers nothing.

1557928,3,B00005JNBQ,"Before you just skip over the review becuase i'm not ranting about how good it is, just take the time to read it. I read reviews in magaznes like Entertainment Weekly which said this movie wasn't really that good. They said it was dry and boring. So, i pretty much just ignored it. Then, a bunch of my firends saw it and were telling me how funny it was. At first i just argued with them, saying that it really wasn't that good, but i really had no basis to do so. I eventually gave in and when it came out on DVD, i rented it. It was only about 90 minutes, it would be that bad....

Well i put it in my DVD player and sat there and i watched the whole thing. I laughed, i didn't fall on the floor laughing, but i did luagh, becuase it was funny. But about 45 minutes into it and it started to lose me. It just got boring. There was never really any plot established. There was that thing about the election, but nothing was ever developed. The ending came around, and Pedro wins the election, but i didn't seem to care. It was like the writer just tried to squeeze all this stuff into the last 45 minutes and it just became painful to watch, but i did finish it.

There is one reason people love this and one reason only, and i'm not saying i don't fall into this category. Napoleon is a nerd, and as you probably now, nerds are not the most popular people in shcool. htey get picked on by the ""jocks"" and when those ""jocks"" watch this movie, they laugh at the Napoleon because they feel superior to him, they think they're better. As a matter of fact, anybody who isn't a nerd (or who tries to deny the fact and never accept it) feels the same way. It's the same reason that these people pick on nerds and laugh at them. I'll admit that i am one of these people and do in fact pick on the nerds, so i'm not going to lie to you. Now, the nerds see Napoleon and can realte to him and laugh at him that way, becuase they feel like they share his experinces.

As i said, i did laugh, and i have repaeted SOME of the lines, becuase they were kind of funny. But, it just wasn't a good movie. If you could just look past the Napoleon and Kip and whoever else for just a second and look at the actual movie, you'll realize there is nothing there. The movie is just an excuse to put a bunch of nerds on screen make people laugh at them, not to make a movie. So, if you can accept that this really isn't a movie, you'll enjoy yourself, and i don't mean that as an insult. But, if you're like me, and you watch a movie in hopes that there is something there and that the movie is treated like the art form it really is, you won't make it through the whole movie, you might fall asleep.

If you're looking for some good comedies in 2004, check out ""Shaun of the Dead"" or, despite negative critic reviews, ""I Heart Huckabees"". Also, if you're looking for a mindless comedy that is still extremly funny, and does have some kind of story going on, check out, ""Team America:World Police"". It is a perfect example that is funny the whole way through, has some kind of plot, and has some kind of intelligence.

1557930,4,B00005JNBQ,"A lot of people thought that this movie was a disappointment and had no meaning to it. Clearly this movie has a meaning to it. It's about a guy who gets picked on in high school every day of his life and still decides to live his life no matter how hard things get. When things are as worse as they can get for ND, it seems as if he knows that things can only go up.

Some people say that this movie sucked because this movie was a low budget film, it took only 22 days to shoot, it seems as if it jumps from timeline to timeline or that it has dead humor. Some of the best movies of all time were low budget and took little time to make. And there are some movies that cost over 100 million dollars to make that weren't even good.

The movie does sort of seem like it jumps back and forth from the eighties to the nineties. The movie does use songs from the eighties and fashion that you would've probably recognized from a John Hughes film. But, not everything in the movie represents something from the eighties though. Napoleon does have wierd clothes but I would be pretty sure that they would be clothes that the nerdy guy in school would wear. His best friend Pedro comes from the south, where Latino culture is well known and represented. His clothes are pretty much up to date for being where he is from. How many people down south don't wear jeans and cowboy boots? Then there is ND's friend, Deb. She's her own fashion designer which would pretty much explain how she dresses during most of the movie. Last but not least, ND's Uncle Rico. Rico is a guy, in about his forties, who is pretty much stuck in 1982 and wishes that he had the chance to back in time to change his future. Come on, how many people have wanted to do that? He does dress in eighties attire, only because he thinks he still there.

Let's face it folks, comedy is the genre where Hollywood needs help. We have horror and action films galore. Sometimes I ask myself, how can we have a comedy with so little comedic talent. We do have some funny people on the big screen, but we're seeing less and less of the people that can still make us laugh harder than anyone on the big screen now. Jamie Fox and Jim Carey are playing more serious roles, Chapelle is making a really big impact on his tv show but it would be great to have him back on the big screen. ND does have dead humor and sarcasm, but that was the backbone for comedy for quite sometime. From the Naked Guns to the Ace Ventura's. It would be great to have comedies like Pryor or Murphy used to make, but that's not going to happen. ND is probably the closest we will get to old school humor.

On the contrary, I read something about someone saying that Lizzie McGuire was better than ND. I only have one question, what in the heck were you doing watching that movie? I would suppose that this person watches her show too. And just too let everyone know, if you read the facts about ND, you will read that they do tell you that a Liger is a real animal. to know that, you have to have read the quotes or you have to be a reall geek.......

This movie may seem dumb at frist, but give it another shot and you'll see that this movie is worth owning and why people, who hate or love it, keep on rambling on about Napoleon Dynamite. Pay attention to what people say and enjoy the laughter. This movie is very original in it's own way and has the potetial to win probably just an eMpTy Vision Movie Award.",1111968000,3,3441,4.199697428139183

The gritty honesty in the characters, their ingenuity, their friendship, their loyalty and their bravery all excellent character traits, and displayed in this movie quite well. The honesty from the opening credits let's you know that this is a low budget movie about real people so you know not to expect any fancy special effects or stunts for example. The ingenuity displayed by the characters for example Pedro's use of a cake to ask girls out on dates is perfect. It shows the right amount of thoughtfulness and romance, just exactly the sort of things women of all ages love. The friendship displayed between Napoleon and Pedro helping each other out in the movie. The loyalty Napoleon displays by buying his friend a wig when he wanted something for himself. The bravery Napoleon displayed going on stage to help out his friend.

1558066,5,B00005JNBQ,"In an era of film making where the studio's main concern is the opening weekend box office report, Napoleon Dynamite kicks that mentality in the family jewels with some sweet kung fu moves.

By showing quality movies can come cheap and make a profit hopefully a new trend of big studio gambles on little movies made with more heart than moolah will emerge.  Napoleon Dynamite was made for under a million bucks and grossed over forty million in theaters.  Not to mention its phenomenal success on DVD.

Jon Heder plays Napoleon(in the best performance by a new actor in 2004), a delusional geek who's claim to fame are imaginary numchuck skills and drawing mythical monsters.  He's awesome at tetherball(singles) and a whiz at political campaign strategy.  He's fond of tater tots and his lips are chapped.

I can't remember the last time a movie had me laughing to the point of tears.  Boy was I cryin', I can admit it.

An instant cult classic and 2004's funniest movie, Napoleon Dynamite is a treat for anyone who attended high school or is amused by life's little absurdities.  Even the soundtrack is hilarious.  Watch this movie and laugh.  If you don't there's something terribly wrong with you.

1558068,5,B00005JNBQ,"So far I've read that ND is a male version of WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE, and in many respects, that's true. The major differences are that the main character in WTTD knows she's a dork, knows the other kids ridicule her for it, yet feels powerless to stop it and just unempowered in general. Not so with ND.  Although Napoleon is a dork among dorks, he's oblivious to it all. His apathy with life in general serves as a protective shield, and if he feels victimizes, he doesn't let it get him down and doesn't show it.  In a strange way, he has a lot of self confidence, because in his eyes, he's okay, and that's what matters. The story moves against a backdrop of gorgeous Idaho landscapes.  Who knew there was more to Idaho than just potatoes?Here's the story: Napoleon is an apathetic nerd whose life is inhabited by a daredevil, dune-bike-riding grandma and a cybergeek brother named Kip.  The Dynamite parents are both conspicuosly absent.  Grandma and Kip treat him with a good deal of indifference and apathy.  Even Pedro, the gentle-natured Mexican boy he befriends, is indifferent to a degree.  Then one day Grandma injures herself while riding her dune bike, and Uncle Rico, a washed-up football player yearing for his glory days, commandeers the house.  Undoubtedly he's come to stay so that he can take advantage of Grandma's absence in order to give himself a break from living in his early 80's behemoth orange housevan.  Between eating all the red meat in the house and selling dubious goods door to door with Kip, Uncle Rico makes Napoleon live in complete mortification by screwing up his dating life and just embarrassing him in general. It gets better when Pedro decides to run for class president, but I'll let you watch and see!  The humor is so deadpan in ND that at times you may forget to laugh.

I consider myself to have impeccable taste in comedies: 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' is, hands down, the funniest movie of all time. Close behind is 'Dumb and Dumber' and 'Tommy Boy'. Other faves are 'Airplane!' and 'Police Academy'. In other words, I know a funny movie when I see it. 'Airplane!', for example, has a lot of the dry ""stupid funny"" humour that 'Napoleon Dynamite' attempts but fails miserably. If you haven't seen the movies I mentioned (especially 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'), I highly recommend you see what you're missing. The only reason that this movie can do so well among young people (of which I am one -- 22 years old) is because they (we) have been deprived of quality comedies (1995's 'Tommy Boy' being the last great comedy).

If you think trite jokes about a guy ""stuck in the 80's"" are funny, then, by all means, get 'Napoleon Dynamite'. If you think ""liger"" (Napoleon's favorite mythical creature -- a cross b/w a lion and tiger) is funny, then get 'Napoleon Dynamite'. If you share my tastes in comedies, then avoid. Don't waste two hours of your life and certainly don't waste your money. I doubt this will truly become a cult classic; it simply isn't funny.",1111363200,8,1352,4.609958506224066

But the movie was unique, and there were a lot of characters involved, so things were at least decently interesting.

He's got a crazy motorcycle riding grandma, a web-chatting brother, an Uncle obsessed with 1982, and a Hispanic friend running for Student body president.

I have given this movie five stars even though the movie doesn't really have a plot.  I think that is really what the point was.  Jon Heder played Napoleon Dynamite just right.  Napoleon is one of those nerdy guys that you went to school with that just didn't know how to connect with anyone.  He came from a really strange family that includes his Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) who thinks that he should have been given a better chance in playing football in high school and his 32 year old brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) who liked to spend all of his time in chat rooms on-line.

When we first see Napoleon he is a total loner with no one to talk to, play with, or hang out with.  He hooked up with Pedro (Efren Ramirez) on Pedro's first day of school when the principal asked him to show Pedro where to find his locker.  Teaming up with Pedro gave Napoleon someone to identify with and talk to, although neither one did much talking.  He helped Pedro with running for class president.  Some of the funny parts are due to Pedro's running for president and how they managed to help each other out with some of their ""skills.""

Pedro and Napoleon help each other out when it comes to courting the ladies.  Neither Napoleon nor Pedro knows the best way to go about it and both fall flat.  Both guys like gals that are way out of their league, but that doesn't stop them from trying.  Things take a little turn when Pedro ends up with Deb (Tina Majorino) as a date to the prom.  It doesn't take long for the viewer to figure out that Napoleon and Deb are interested in each other.  In the mean time Napoleon's Uncle Rico and brother Kip are busy with lives of their own.  All of them fall into situations that should keep you laughing.

Anyone who was a teen in the early 80's will love the atmosphere, anyone living in rural America will grin at the scenery, but other than that...c'mon, let's just chalk these characters up to playful cinematic fun.

If it was only Napoleon that was deadpan, then the quirkiness of the others may have worked. The uncle was the only interesting character.  About the only nice thing I can say is that Napoleon put forth a fairly accurate portrayal of a student with Asperger syndrome that also has some serious emotional issues.  He should have been picked on more at school for the film to be accurate.  I may use a scene from this movie when presenting on Autistic Spectrum Disorder because Rain Man was so overrated.

1558274,4,B00005JNBQ,"At some point in our lives, we've all been the geek.  Some of us(like myself), have been the geek one too many times.  This film lets us laugh at those who are geeks, those who beat up the geeks, and the snobby little popular girls who toy with the geeks.

The film is basically about a few days in the life of a not-so-likeable dork named Napoleon, and his more likeable friend, Pedro, as well as his chatroom-happy brother, Kip, and his uncle, Rico.  They are all losers in one way or another.  Rico's trapped in the past, like so many former high school jocks.  Kip has fallen in love with his on-line friend he has never met.  Pedro is just kind of there, too shy to really stand out.  Then there's Napoleon.  He is in a class all to himself.  He draws fantasy creatures(I can relate), likes to save tater tots for later(in his pockets, unwrapped), and is pretty annoying all in all.

Pedro is in love with the school's most popular girl(Hilary Duff's sister), but she doesn't even know he exists, until he decides to run against her for class president.  Even then, she blows him off as no threat.  Napoleon is sort of his campaign manager and his ""secret service captain.""  He also sort of pursues Deb, another geek played perfectly by Tina Majorino.  She's been in a ton of films, primarily playing a child.  The only one that comes to mind right now is ""Waterworld.""  Kip's internet love comes to visit and she turns out to be an amazonian black beauty who changes his life forever.  Rico still clings to what might have been.

The humor of this film is scattered over brief moments in the lives of the aforementioned geeks.  They get beat up, picked on, etc., just like any normal kid who was the outcast in school.  Whether or not you feel guilty for laughing at them, you have to laugh because the best humor is found in the truth, and this film is loaded with that.

Highly recommended to folks who are willing to watch this film more than once because you will definitely catch things that you missed before.  It is definitely worthy of multiple viewings.

Also, stick around after the credits role to see one of the best moments of the film.  Kip steals the show with his ""Lookey, lookey"" line.",1110758400,4,2208,4.46

Basing the movie around him becomes the film's major problem. John Heder does what he can with the character, but doesn't succeed much.

However, the film does feature fascinating supporting characters. The best character is Pedro, who is one of the best low-key comedic characters I've ever seen. The actor does a commendable job. The rest of the cast is also fascinating, and makes the film bearable.

The DVD also features extras that, like the film itself, only require one viewing. If you're interested in low-key comedies, then this film is for you. For the rest, ""Spaceballs"" and ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" are funnier!

Mc'Donalds coorperation, I decided to locate my grampa and his kindred. What I found was a room full of fools watching this movie. This terrible movie! Where is the point in the actors, charactors, or worst of all for this lame excuse for a comedy: Where is the humor? In the behind the scenes someone boasts that ""We made a good clean cut comedy with nothing vulgar."" That is just an admittance that is wasint funny! I laughed only once. It was when napoleon failed his bike ramp, but that was because I thought he just died and the credits would roll! I was too lazy to get up and turn this (...) off. They say you need to watch it twice, which is when the secret subliminal rewiring takes root in you mind! You can watch Bob Saget a 1000 times and
it only gets worse. Did he write this movie too?
The point is this: ""why would you punish yourself again?"" This train of thought is why people in the future call you ""the generation we do not speak of"" ,bad apples taking dumps on film. This idea was sooooooooo simple and lacked any filler. A whole nation is bowing before their ""vision"" I could have written this film. So could you or anyone. Does that make it art? NO! But it makes it a gimmick! Now If you want magnificence, listen to some michael Bolton. People in the future cant get enough of the old recordings of our dictator! My grampa said everyone at his job begged him to see it. I told him that they were possibly trying to dupe him into blowing his weekly welfare budget, and they would all secretly laugh at him if he said it was a ""Funny"" movie.

I found my self smiling twice, and laughing only once, and that was a completely banal scene where Napoleon's attempt at a bike jump results in the ramp crumbling uder him and him crashing. Point is, it had nothing to do with the story, and could have been in any film.

The only saving grace, and in my opinion the only scene worth watching, was the climax, which sees Napoleon defying his nerdiness to put on a great dance routine.

I didn't expect much going in; after all, it's an MTV movie. But I have to say: given the choice, I'd watch Beavis and Butthead 10 times out of 10 before Napoleon.",1110326400,4,756,4.243055555555555

I say go rent or buy it and watch and see if you get the same reaction but after I watched the movie and started talking about I liked it more then when I watched it.

Couple things about watching it, it is very monotone.  No characters in the movie seem to speak up or at a higher level then the next one.  I didn't really see this until my second time watching the film.  I am still unsure when this movie takes place.  Everything has a look and feel of being around the late 80's but there are more modern references and music so I have assumed that it is like that because they live in such a small town.  And the one thing that REALLY surprised me was that there was no curse words.  I have no problem with language but I actually found myself looking for one in this movie while watching a second time around because I was so surprised there were none.

It's not meant to be deep. It's not meant to have a plot. ND says a lot about life in the late 20th century. But, saying a lot doesn't mean saying anything necessarily significant.

1558462,3,B00005JNBQ,"I'm surprised by the cult status and financial success of this film.  So many who claim to love this film, if they were honest with themselves would admit that they love laughing at the misfortune of others and looking down on people in order to feel superior, because let's face it...there are loners in high school who don't have any friends, so the people who love this movie so much...just how many loner/nerdy friends do you hang out with?  Just as I thought...none.

I believe Roger Ebert is correct in his review of this film...it was made to make people feel superior as they laugh at some of the most pathetic characters to ever grace the silver screen.  The only likeable character in the whole bunch is Deb, though she could use some pointers on which direction her pony tail should go (towards the back, not the side).  This film is all over the map...as the clothing styles of the main characters are holdovers from the polyester and butterfly collar 70s; the interior of the house with wood panel walls and top loading VCRs also put this family in league with the Brady Bunch; the school dance plays classic 80s songs; yet we know its in the 1990s because of Kip Dynamite's surfing the Internet for babes.

Napoleon Dynamite is an unlikeable nerd who doesn't have any friends, except for the new Mexican kid, who speaks with all the stereotypical accent of Slow Poke Rodriguez of the Warner Brothers cartoons (cousin of Speedy Gonzalez).  Watching this film, as painful as it is, it shouldn't surprise anyone why Napoleon is always picked on at school and has no friends and can't get a date.  His brother Kip is no better, hanging out at home with no job and getting involved in some salesman schemes when their used-car salesman looking uncle shows up one day with dreams of faded high school glory (""my life would be better if only the coach put me in the game the last quarter of the final game of my senior year!"").  Napoleon and Kip live with their grandmother, who disappears from the movie really quick, as even she can't stand to be around those losers and leaves them to fend for themselves in the cold, brutal, superficial world.

Does this movie have a point?  Not really.  It succeeds only if you consider the idea that the director's whole point of this film is to indite us as having superiority complexes for judging and laughing at the patheticness of these characters.  A lot of the scenes have humor in them, and I can easily imagine it going over really well in the Mormon culture of Idaho and Utah, where this film takes place (Preston, Idaho).  That the director is a graduate of BYU, which censored Hollywood films when I attended there, doesn't surprise me, as this film was made to Mormon specifications of ""morality"" (no profanity).  Unfortunately, they don't have a prohibition on bad taste, otherwise this film would've never seen the light of day.

Having said all that...its not the worst film I ever saw (that would be ""Barton Fink""...the only film I ever walked out of the theater in the middle of).  I loved the opening credit sequence, which I thought was the most creative I've ever seen.  I also thought the ending was so manipulative in that the choice of song was lyrically brilliant and I couldn't help but smile when the film came to an end.  That was aggravating to me...a film I consider in poor taste that ends on such a brilliant note that I can't call it a complete waste of my time.  There were two other points where the director used two of my all time favorite 1980s songs (""Forever Young"" by Alphaville and ""Time After Time"" by Cyndi Lauper), so I must add one star for the music selection of this film.  I also liked the Llama and wished to have seen more of that.  For me, the funniest moments of the film are with LaFawnduh and with Rex and his bodybuilding wife.  So, those characters saved this film from being a complete wash out with me...thus three stars instead of the automatic one that amazon.com gives all reviews.",1110240000,3,3990,4.588732394366197

I knew it was funny, but for some reason it wasn't making me laugh. However, I looked back on the moments in the film, most of which I remember, and thought very fondly of them all. While most people will be praising the comedic side of this film, I was most impressed with the storyline and characters. This movie does have an obscure, rather odd plot. To quickly describe it, it's basically just a deep insight into the life of a nerd, that being the main character Napoleon Dynamite. Of course, from this unveils numerous side plots, the largest being Napoleon's friend running for Class President.

I found the humour to be not filled wih hilarity, but quite suttle and witty. There are certain moments in the film that are especially funny, but no one stands out. The acting is strong, especially the lead role, and we get a great new style of comedy that few of us have ever seen before.

Sure Napoleon is the nerd other nerds avoid, but it certainly doesn't hold him back from doing his own thing without shame. Even the bad kids in this movie are not the traditionally vile little creeps we have come to expect from Highschool comedies.

This movie is mostly noticible for what it lacks: Sex, profanity and cynical mean-spiritedness. The laughs are honest and the movie has a surpisingly satisfying ending when considering that the cast of characters are unapologetic ""losers"". This movie is difficult to predict for first-time viewers since it intentionally gives the reverse outcome to every scenario that we commonly experince in the movies.

True, the film does lag at times, and lacks somewhat in substance, but it is headshakingly original in so many ways...It is a little like cleaned up John Waters, or linear David Lynch..

It's a great setup for a movie, but all throughout, I found myself waiting for something better to happen.

The film stars Jon Heder as Napoleon Dynamite, an intensely weird high school kid who is an outcast in every aspect of his life. He enjoys drawing imaginary animals, like unicorns and ligers, and basically hates everything else. He wants a girlfriend, but who would go out with him? He lives with his grandmother and his 32-year-old brother Kip (Aaron Ruell), who spends his days at home on internet chat rooms with his long-distance girlfriend.

When Grandma Dynamite (Sandy Martin) goes down for the count after a dune buggy accident, Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) moves in to take care of the boys. Rico is about the only fully developed character in the movie, a man trying to get back to 1982 and change the way his life has turned out. Of course, his plan for turning his life around involves selling Tupperware door-to-door and buying a time machine on eBay.

At school, Napoleon's buddy Pedro (Efren Ramirez) is running for class president against the most popular girl in school, Summer (Haylie Duff), while also swooping in and taking Deb (Tina Majorino) right out from underneath Napoleon's limp grasp.

I liked this movie. I really did. There were a lot of hysterical parts, but unfortunately, those parts don't add up to a complete whole. The quirky characters were dying for better situations in which to apply their quirks, but all of the plot devices were gathered from stock.

The movie suffers largely from being plotless and the characters being unlikeable and largely unfunny. The uncle in the movie has some occasionaly funny moments but the rest of it is bland and lifeless.

Don't get me the wrong. The acting is excellent... but the Characters are so fatally annoying that watching the movie becomes a burden.

Reading through the reviews it seems obvious that the majority of people who have given this movie 5 stars are geeks who can relate to the characters in the movie.

But this all changed when it came out on DVD. It was advertised on MTV and probably your local cable provider, so you didn't have to go all the way to your local underground movie theater to see it. Lucky you! And now you can repeat all the same catch phrases over and over again to annoy all your classmates and suck all the fun out of the movie. Good job.

Every character in this film reminded me of someone I knew in high school.  This is what made it so funny to me, the fact that it was like seeing all these people I used to know again.  Napoleon as a character was so complex and masterfully played, I really don't think they could have gotten a better actor for that part.  With all the good things I have said about this film, I don't reccommend it to everyone.  For those who don't really like the ""Seinfeld"" no point in the story script, it's not for you, but if you're just looking for something simple it's a great movie.",1109721600,3,680,4.322834645669292

There is NO plot here whatsoever. Napoleon tries to get together with another outwardly dumb and awkward girl, while his outwardly dumb and awkward friend runs for class president.

1558660,5,B00005JNBQ,"Napoleon Dynamite has been recently released on DVD. The small, independent film has become one with a lot of fans. Buttons declaring, ""I love tater tots"" and ""Vote for Pedro"" are sold in popular stores. T-shirts identical to those worn by cast members are sold at many online websites.

Why has the nation fallen in love with Napoleon Dynamite? For one thing, the characters are incredibly memorable. Napoleon is a classic outcast who walks around with his eyes half closed and his mouth half open saying random things like, ""I caught you a delicious bass"" and playing tether ball by himself. His brother Kip, a thirty two year old man with braces, chats online all day with ""babes"" and meets the love of his life, a black woman named Lafawnduh who teaches him how men behave in Detroit where she lives. The Dynamite brothers are forced to be babysat by their uncle Rico when their grandmother is injured in a dirt bike accident. Rico wishes he lived in the 1980s although much of the movie seems to be set then anyway. Napoleon's friend Pedro, a new kid at school, decides to run for class president. Deb, a shy girl, takes glamour shots and sells boondoggle key chains to raise money for college. Each of the outcast characters has their own unique personality traits that make the movie funny and interesting.

The pacing of the film is slow at times and after viewing it the first time, you might be thinking, ""What just happened?"" Think about the jokes, think about the characters, and you'll be laughing for sure.

Many of the scenes in the film are random. When the film starts, viewers see Napoleon embarking on a children's school bus and tossing an action figure attached to a string out the window. The scene ends and is never made reference to again.

That last scene at the end of the credits is a welcome addition to the film.

The deleted scenes are pretty good too. The best one is where they kids are playing kickball in gym class.

Much of the movie seems to take place in the 1980s although it is not. Deb wears her hair in a side ponytail in several scenes. The school dance features Cindi Lauper's ""Time After Time"" and puffy sleeved dresses. However, more modern things tell that the town is only partially in a timewarp. The Backstreet Boys' ""Larger Than Life"" is played at the end of the film. The confusion over the time period adds to the subtle humor of the film.

Most of the humor is found in Napoleon's own mind. He believes that girls only like guys with skills so he wants to learn how to use nun chucks and hack into computers. He also tells stories about ""ligers,"" his favorite animals which are bred from a lion and a tiger for their magical powers. One of his most common utterances when asked what he is going to do is, ""Whatever I feel like I want to do, gosh!""

Some of the film seems clich&eacute; like the popular girls that are mean to Napoleon and Pedro and some of the jokes but these things are downplayed and take a backseat to the scenes between the outcast characters.

The full effect of the film can only be experienced when one sees the way the actors deliver their lines and maintain their characters. Overall, it is an excellent comedy and a nice change of pace from the standard formula we are used to.",1109635200,12,3257,4.516129032258065

I think people who were the jocks, cheerleaders, bullies and popular kids in high school are the ones who hate this movie because the movie almost seems to ignore them, and you know how much those types hate being ignored.  As for anyone else, you ought to enjoy this movie.  Even folks who were the nerdiest kids in high school ought to love this movie, especially since they couldn't possibly be as nerdy and dorky as this guy.

From the tiny bits and scraps that I had seen of the movie, I was expecting another tired, flat, unimaginative film that took predictable swipes at the socially inept during their high school years. Instead, I found this film almost hypnotic when I wasn't laughing my head off.

Napoleon Dynamite manages to poke fun at ""nerds"" while celebrating their uniqueness.

Sure, the characters seem more like stagnant caricatures than real people. And though they remain so throughout the film (I don't remember ever seeing the Napoleon character ever crack a smile), their journey through the travails of high school somehow paints a human side that lured me into liking them. I discovered myself pulling for Napoleon and his pals while still finding it hard to resist laughing at them.

The film feels fresh as it sidesteps the slick over-polished Hollywood look. The audience isn't bullied into predictable twists and turns by special effects or a foreboding soundtrack. Instead, Napoleon Dynamite's simple music and serene scenery nestles comfortably around the plot.

If you're interested in seeing a film that depends on smart writing and clever (if not a bit off the wall)ideas, I recommend Napoleon Dynamite. The Hollywood whistles and bells are missing from this film. The good news is you won't even miss them.",1109548800,2,1329,5.110599078341014

Being the adult I can further understand more of the nuances of the movie...but I still had to agree with my son!  It was way overdone and if the boring antics had been toned down there would have been much more humor in them.  But this was a monotonous and extremely boring movie that we only watched till the end because we couldn't believe that people we knew had actually liked it, and hoped that at some breaking moment it would dramatically change and actually BE funny.  It never did.",1109548800,2,668,4.26984126984127
1558744,5,B00005JNBQ,"And I say that with complete flippin' sincerity. Anyone who disagrees should just get out of my life and shut up!

Anyone who loves off-the-wall comedy will enjoy this movie. I had never heard of this movie until a buzz emerged, that it was a movie you could quote all day. As a lover of comedy dialogue, from Caddyshack to There's Something About Mary, I could not pass up the opportunity to annoy my coworkers with some fresh one-liners.

This movie is not Adam Sandler/Saturday Night Live funny, it's not Farrelly brothers 'gross-out' funny, and it's definitely not Woody Allen 'thoughtful' funny. It's Kids in the Hall 'weird' funny, but the humor is also very light, very innocent. There is not a single phrase of profanity spoken the entire film. Once you understand the movie's vibe - if you're not laughing after the first scene on the school bus, then forget it - you'll never want it to end. I had the movie for a week and probably watched it 10 times (and I work full time and go to school at night). Some, in fact most, of the lines are so dumb they're funny.

Napoleon is the ultimate nerd. He's such a Poindexter, that even the 'cools' don't know what to do with him. And his gang are all characters who have been alienated, usually by choice, with the exception of Uncle Rico, who blames his failure on something his high school football coach did back in '82. If you were ever picked on in school, ever been ridiculed or teased for ANYTHING, had ever felt lonely or unpopular, then you will identify with Napoleon. If you were a bully and pushed people around, then you'll definitely remember Napoleon!

Yes, this movie basically has no plot. There is no army to defeat, no bomb to diffuse, no girl to seduce. It's a slice-of-life movie where it doesn't matter what happens - we've only been given a window into this bizarre world. And a window is all we'll need.

I was surprised when some of my ""hippest"" friends thought this movie was terrible. Shocked when one told me she turned it off halfway through, and saddened when others told me they just didn't get it. One the other hand, nothing makes me happier than hearing Napoleon being quoted at work, school or out in public. It's like you can exchange Napoleon lines with complete strangers and laugh with the knowledge that you're `in the know.'

People don't like this movie, sure. But they seem to be the cynics who overanalyze, and expect every movie to change their life. Napoleon Dynamite isn't about sweeping the Academy Awards, or appearing in the Top 10 of all-time movies. It's not about sitting on the edge of your seat...It's about ""your mom goes to college!""

Santa Maria!!!! NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE brings to the big screen the experiences and misadventures of the epitome of misfit-dom--the title character (a curly-headed, coke-bottle glasses-adorned outcast played by Jon Heder).  This guy is really like no one I have ever seen.

Napolean  is a young man who lives with his grandmother and 32 year old brother in a small town in Idaho.  His days consist of feeding their llama, seeking out odd jobs (they include working in a chicken farm, hearding the creatures into cages and analyzing glasses of milk to determine what the cows consumed before they were milked), and just trying to survive the ups and downs (mostly downs) of high school life.  Napolean encounters fellow geek Pedro (Efren Ramirez), recently uprooted from his native Mexico, and helps him run for class president.  Napolean also encounters Deb (Tina Majorino), a shy aspiring glamor shot photographer, who becomes his friend.

This film is filled with a kind of humor best-described as ""off the wall"" and ""subtle"" (to say the least).  In fact, when I started watching it, I really wasn't sure if it was really going to appeal to my tastes (though, I try to keep an open mind and enjoy independent films).

Genuis is the best way to describe the writing and directing in this film.  Simple and funny are two words that describe the story.  But there are a few more words that can be included: daring, brilliant, and creative.

Napoleon Dynamite creators, Jared Hess and his wife, manage to offer a story touching on so many real-life high school and rural living situations that hit close-to-home for most people.  Some my find the situations almost too close to home.  I found the entire film to be enjoyable entertainment.

Napoleon is definitley a nerd.  But he is a nerd searching for a way to make his life a little better; he is trying to stand up to his ""looney"" grandmother (at least I think that's who she was), deal with his strangely-geekier-than-Napoleon-himself brother Kip, and fight off the bullies who attack him day after day.  He makes friends with another loner named Pedro, a guy who appears addicted to downers, thought I don't think that's included in the storyline.

Napoleon's uncle Rico ends up coming to visit, and this adds more difficult times for poor Napoleon.  I think each of these characters, including Pedro's and Napoleon's love interests in the movie, interact so well together that the story almost seems like it is a documentary - a bit of an exaggerated documentary though.

It is really cool to watch Napoleon deal with so many situations, which aren't really earth-shattering events, but he treats them as they are.  He handles problems Napoleon's way, and that gives this film a unique freshness that grows on the viewer.

This is a movie that has to be watched more than once to completely grasp its creative juices.  I think John Heder plays this role so well that it may be hard for him to ever be himself again.  Many people will always call him Napoleon from now on.  I would love to see a part two and part three.  Heck, what about a weekly television show!  Napoleon may be one of the most memorable characters to come out of a film since Silence of the Lambs' ""Hannibel the Cannibal"".

Like I said earlier, I didn't ""get"" this film upon a first look, but after another viewing I really think this independent film is going to LAUNCH the career of Jared Hess to a new level.

If you haven't seen Napoleon Dynamite, I suggest you give it a try.  If the first time you watch it, it seems a little ""off"", give it one more try.  I think it such a different kind of movie that it is hard to ""take it all in"" upon the first viewing.

I am glad to have this little gem on my DVD shelf.

1558844,5,B00005JNBQ,"""Napoleon Dynamite"" is so hilariously sweet that I can't get enough of it. Destined to become a classic, ND's lines, characters and scenes are already being burned into memory by fans - a ""buyer"" (not a ""renter"") if ever there was one.

The film assembles a cast of the weirdest, most engaging characters seen on screen in many a day. ND follows the crazy/ordinary life of Napoleon Dynamite, high school giga-nerd, his scrawny older brother Kip, 1982-obsessed Uncle Rico, uptight girlfriend Deb, dim-bulb-yet-ambitious Pedro and a host of other misfit types who should be familiar to anyone who has endured the American school scene. Set in rural Idaho, there's no particular plot other than getting through the school day, fending off jocks and beauty queens, trying to get a tetherball partner and attempting sweet jumps on bikes. Along the way, the film provided dead-on satires of martial arts commercials, school elections, wild grandmas, glamour photography and the inanities of life itself.

Napoleon (Jonn Heder) is a frizzy-haired, bespectacled beanpole who is unpopular but doesn't care. He spends his school day drawing magical animals, yearning for a ""skill"" and ludicrously lying about his dangerousness to others who know better. Heder perfectly captures the type: prickly toward all those who threaten or annoy him (including grade-schoolers), never making eye-contact, mouth always agape, unathletic and uncoordinated. His unironic delivery of exclamations like ""Idiot!"" and ""Whatever I want! Gosh!"" and ""Lucky!""

I found it a little easier to comprehend than Rushmore as far as off-beat character movies go, and there were some funny moments in the film.  I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't put it in my top ten list of funny movies.

Someone mentioned that this movie is so stupid it's funny.  I don't know if that could accurately describe it, because I didn't think the movie was stupid.  It has a very deadpan style about a high school nerd and his friends, his 32 year old brother and his scheming Uncle and their daily lives.  You'll note that the ""popular crowd"" or ""anti-heros"" are jovial personality-wise while everyone else seems half-stoned, half concerned and half asleep.  Napolean intersperses his flatliner demeanor with the occasional ""Fine!"" or ""Idiots!""  Those are probably the most quotable parts of the movies.  No cosmic intelletual themes in here which is nice.  None of the cliched high school expressions of wanting a girlfriend yet still an interesting angle at getting a girl go to the dance with you.  Just every day high school stuff in an 80s flavor.",1109289600,,1193,4.742718446601942

Colleges are having weekend ""Napoleon"" film festivals.  Virtually every kid at my kid's high school has seen this movie at least twice. There is something here.

I remember high school.  Even though I'm fifty, it really wasn't that long ago.  There were kids like Napoleon and Pedro.  What went through their minds? Why did they have to put up with the jocks and those perky cheerleader student government types?  Gaaa, what idiots!  (Hit that ""unhelpful"" button.  Go on.  Geeez.)

So, thou one star reviewers, you are either OLD, or you were a student government type, or went to private school where everyone is perfect. This is how it is (or was).

Sure the film has flaws, but  I was not crazy about the LaFonda interlude, or the tidy ending, but the macho American-flag martial arts instructor had me in stiches for a week.  I had an ex-brother in law who reminded me a lot of the Tupperware salesman. I felt the film was trying to be more episodic than plot driven, which is legitimate.

1558950,1,B00005JNBQ,"Ebert, in his review, was kind to this dull, squalid, pitiful 'movie,' which at best reminded me of a bad reality TV show.  There's not a single likable character in Napoleon Dynamite to be found, however, if you like dwarf tossing you might 'enjoy' this unimaginative gob of drek.

After having read the panyegric online reviews, I watched this (thankfully rented) indie 'movie' through to the bitter finale.  The main characters are the kind of geeks that even nerds and other losers can't stand.  Ever wondered why a pack of dogs will kill one of their own; after watching Napoleon Dynamite, you won't wonder again...

Then, after a long boring hour establishing the absolute nadir of these geeks' lives in excruciating detail, the movie gets stupid.  The ending absolutley destroys whatever cinema verite it previously and painfully established.  One geek' meets his penpal hottie who then magically (I asume) turns this pitiful wretch into a hip-hop dude!  Oh yeah, that's believable; only to someone who still watches Saturday morning cartoons, cereal commercials for fun and American Idol...

If that isn't unbelievable enough, Napoleon (who can't scale a fence without falling on his face) then -- after watching some lame dance video -- turns into a nerdy Michael Jackson...  Sigh.

This isn't a movie; it's a train wreck.  0 stars.  Avoid if at all possible, even at the expense of offending your significant other.",1109203200,9,1425,5.064377682403434
1558951,5,B00005JNBQ,"This isn't a movie to over-intellectualize or read into. This is a movie to enjoy.

Napoleon Dynamite is about a high school student who is the geek of all geeks. Breaking with Hollywood tradition, this Napoleon isn't appealing because he's misunderstood, or because his heart of gold is continually tramped on by school bullies. The whole appeal of Napoleon is that he's completely and utterly pathetic.

His interests range from nun-chucks to the Loch Ness Monster to drawing bad pictures. He is intimidated by the school bullies, but cruel to those who won't retaliate against him. He is completely self-centered, and his self-serving ulterior motives are completely transparent.

Napoleon lives in his rural Idaho home with his dramatically older, and seemingly mentally handicapped, brother Kip, who spends all day chatting on the internet to women. Usually, they are cared for by their grandmother, but she has been called away unexpectedly, and so they are supervised by their uncle, who is constantly reliving his non-glory days on the high school football team and trying to sell tupperware or other things to the local housewives.

There's not much of a plot to this movie; it's mostly just a string of intensely hilarious scenes which feature Napoleon or the quirky members of his growing world. Toward the end, a plot evolves out of a race for school president between Summer, the popular girl, and Napoleon's only friend (and seemingly the only Mexican student).

The 11th hour vindication seems like a cheat, but at least Napoleon isn't carried away on the shoulders on a wave of newfound popularity. Instead, he finds someone to play tetherball with, and this quiet triumph is a good place to end it.

This movie will stick in your mind, and Napoleon will stay with you in the same way that the Billy Bob Thornton character in Sling Blade does. He is so bizarre, and yet so like someone you went to high school with, that he is impossible to forget.

Most of all, the inventive and hilarious character-driven jokes will crack you up. If you're going to rent one movie this year, make it this one. We all need a good laugh.

Yes this movie was different. Somebody is original and you reward them with saying their movie sucks? There are very few, if any, movies out there like Napoleon Dynamite. That's GOOD, I don't want to watch 10 of the same movie under a different title... which seems much like some of the movies out there today.

I understand that it may not be for everyone but this is a very good movie, Jon Heder does a VERY good job portraying a nerd, according to my classmates I'm ""just like Napoleon"", which isn't a compliment but it amuses me.

There's so many dumb movies out there about preps, like Mean Girls, don't the geeks/nerds deserve a movie too?",1109116800,3,760,4.525547445255475
1558954,5,B00005JNBQ,"""Napoleon Dynamite"" is among the surprising wave of successful independent films that America has seen over the past year.  It was written by Mormon filmmakers Jared and Jerusha Hess and directed by Jared Hess.  The film stars newbie Jon Heder in the title role, accompanied by a stellar cast including Jon Gries, Efren Ramirez, Aaron Ruell, and Tina Majorino.

 The story takes place in the quirky town of Preston, Idaho, where everyone seems to be inexplicably stuck in the fashions of the early 90's.  As for a substantial plot... the movie has little in this department.  The vague idea of a battle between the ""popular kids"" and the ""geeks"" is present throughout, but is not really the main focus of the film.  Napoleon Dynamite is more like a collection of various scenes from the odd life of one very strange boy.  The film reaches its peak with the student body president elections and the unconventional self-actualization of Napoleon himself.

 This film is, on the surface, a comedy geared towards a teenaged audience.  But, as the saying goes, this is not another teen movie.  It is refreshing in its originality.  Many teen films glorify the underdogs and the unpopular kids, but Napoleon Dynamite delves deep into the existence of those real people, the stereotypical ""freaks and geeks"", making no apologies for the great amount of painful awkwardness and cringe-worthy moments.

 Compared to other top movies of the season, Napoleon Dynamite may or may not be a worthy competitor.  It certainly has uniqueness going for it, not to mention an enormous cult following in both the teen and college age groups.  However, it may not appeal outside of the trendy, offbeat scene because it lacks typical blockbuster appeal.  While some see the film's lack of profanity, sex, or violence as a positive thing, this type of good clean fun doesn't always sell.

 So what is Napoleon Dynamite really trying to tell us?  While the aforementioned ""power to the unpopular"" message is strong and loud, the film is by no means a tear-jerking homage to the little guys.  It seems to strive more for a good laugh and a quotably fun time with your friends.  However, the audience is not laughing at Napoleon so much as they are enjoying the fact that the main character can be so glaringly ""un-cool"" and still be so... cool!  The lovers of this film want to be Napoleon, and so the message becomes one of encouragement to revel in your own originality.  It's cool to be a dork now.

If you are surrounded by fans of this movie who quote it all day long and can't seem to talk about anything else, then you might have been avoiding it.  You may be thinking that it can't be all that great... And no one seems to be able to put their finger on exactly what makes this movie so fabulous.  In truth, Napoleon Dynamite is one of those movies that you will either love or hate.  So is it worth your time and money?  Absolutely.  There's a chance that it will be your favorite movie ever.

The MTV/Rolling Stone syndicate, as I like to call them, have decided that we're all ga-ga over this ""80's retro revial"" trend they created, and Napoleon Dynamite is tailor made to cash in on the craze.

Jon Heder plays the dislocated Napolean to such an uncomfortable nerdy T that you are hard pressed to imagine the guy acting like anything else.

The whole of the movie is so understated and quirky.  High School angst has an innocent face and you find yourself caring for the outcomes of Pedro, Napolean, and Deb's lives while laughing and laughing.

Napolean's 32 year old live at home brother finds love on-line and Tawonda shows up via Greyhound and brings a whole new life to a once social recluse.

1559076,4,B00005JNBQ,"I didn't really want to see Napoleon Dynamite, but had that sick curiosity reserved for rubbernecking on the freeway and reality television.  Then a friend let us borrow the DVD.

Napoleon Dynamite is about, well, Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder), a tall, frizzy-haired, spectacled geek of enormous proportions.  Napoleon is a new breed of nerd: The Angry Nerd.  Because he's not short, Napoleon is a little too powerful to routinely pick on.  Instead, he's randomly slammed into lockers or mocked in gym.  But Napoleon never curls up into a ball and weeps. He tells people ""SHUT UP! GOSH!"" or ""Freakin idiot!"" through half-closed lids. Everyone knows the Angry Nerd...he's voted Most Likely to Be a Serial Killer by his graduating class.

To be fair, Napoleon never had a chance.  We're never told where his parents are, but he lives with his ATV-riding grandmother (Sandy Martin) and his painfully awkward older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell).  Kip has a long distance relationship over the Internet with a woman known only as LaFawnduh (Shondrella Avery). Adding insult to injury, they own a pet llama named Tina and Napoleon has to take the bus to school with elementary kids.

And oh yeah, his first name is Napoleon and his last name is Dynamite.

Napoleon is also a gamer.  I submit the following evidence:

Napoleon draws a manticore that he refers to as a liger. ""It's pretty much my favorite animal,"" says Napoleon. ""It's like a lion and a tiger mixed... bred for its skills in magic."" When faced with a job putting chickens in cages, he asks, ""Do the chickens have large talons?""

Yep, that's a guy who plays Dungeons & Dragons all right.

Or he would, if he had any friends.  Napoleon eventually makes one friend, Pedro (Efren Ramirez), who is also ostracized at school because he's from Mexico.  The so-white-its-bright faculty and students constantly look down Pedro upon.  But Pedro is confident in his own subtle way.  He asks girls out by baking them cakes and most importantly, he plans to run for school president.

Napoleon is not so lucky.  He openly admits he has no skills (if this were a more up-to-date movie, Napoleon would say he has no ""Mad Skillz""). Well, he has the ability to draw.  Unfortunately, he only THINKS he can draw.  His drawing sucks too.

So Napoleon lies.  He lies about hunting wolverines, about his amazing martial arts prowess, about his non-existent girlfriend, about pretty much everything.  Since everything Napoleon says is utterly deadpan, there's no easy way to tell if he's lying.

When Napoleon's grandmother has an ATV accident, his Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) comes to live with them.  There's a subtle irony here: Rico is a failed football star that is perpetually stuck in the 80s.  He is the ghost of the future, a vicious attack on all those high school jocks who would have gone pro if they hadn't messed up that knee.  Rico's entire life is driven by one goal: to travel backwards in time.  Once he discovers an expensive time travel kit on the Internet that will transport him backwards, he enlists Kip to join his get-rich-quick schemes.  First it's Tupperware, then it's...breast enhancement products.

Yeah, Napoleon never had a chance.

In the middle of this insanity, Napoleon bumps into Deb (Tina Majorino), dressed in full 80s attire and trying to sell her friendship bracelets so someone (her? Her mom?) can go to college.  It doesn't go well at first, but it's clear the two are destined for each other.

Eventually, Kip meets LaFawnduh, a luscious African-American woman from Detroit.  Her arrival transforms Kip and the entire movie from then on, signaling a change from the 80s death by stagnation to an updated, hipper universe.  No literal time travel happens, but suddenly the movie shifts gears and its 2004 again.  And finally, all the characters begin some real emotional growth.

Much of the movie's humor centers on the sympathy or disdain we have for characters like Napoleon.  A lot of the jokes are around mid-Western foils: the white town's reaction to an ethnic student, heavy usage of the word ""sweet,"" and farmers shooting cows (in front of a busload of schoolchildren no less). Not everyone will get the jokes.

Perhaps more intriguing is the parallels between this film and Donnie Darko.  Both films have superhero-esque names, both take place in primarily white high schools, both feature racism against a different ethnicity, both have adults teaching kids confidence building skills, both have a serious 80s fetish, and finally both feature an obsession with time travel.  It's likely more people haven't made the connection between the two movies because few audiences have watched both.

Unlike Donnie Darko, the broad parodies of white Midwesterners are smeared with racist undertones.  The two ethnic characters play to the most awful racial stereotypes: Pedro has a big family, scary relatives in pimped up cars, and is Catholic while LaFawnduh has long painted nails, lots of gold jewelry, and comes from Detroit.

Throughout the film, the director (Jared Hess), makes liberal use of the buzzing sound of a fly.  It's a reminder that whenever we're laughing at Napoleon, we're the big jerks.  Which really argues the point that perhaps this movie isn't supposed to be a comedy after all.

Ultimately, Napoleon Dynamite posits the question: what good ARE people like Napoleon?  He's angry, rude, insensitive, socially inept, and seems to be in a perpetual daze most of the time.  What ARE Napoleon's skills?

We get the answer in a climactic frenzy of events that culminate in the class election. Pedro promises in his speech that he will make ""all your dreams come true,"" and in a sense, the film's conclusion is precisely that.

Watch this movie but don't make any judgements on it until you've had time to think about it!

1559232,5,B00005JNBQ,"Napoleon Dynamite is no doubt my favorite movie.  You will find yourself laughing at Napoleon's uber-geekiness within the first five minutes.  Whether or not you'll enjoy this movie depends on what kind of humor you like.  If you like stupid humor, like SpongeBob SquarePants, you'll love this movie.  On the other hand, if you like actual humorous humor, you may be better off with a movie like Shrek 2 or Dodgeball.  Still, I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to see what it's like living life as a nerd, or just know what the heck is going on when someone tells you that ""You're just jealous because I've been chatting online with babes all day.""",1108771200,3,663,4.632478632478633
1559233,4,B00005JNBQ,"I was laughing althroughout this movie, yet althroughout the whole movie, I was still asking myself: How could I be laughing at this (...)?

Yes, this is a very pointless movie, but it's got my vote for one of the best comedies of 2004.  Unlike other movies, the actors in here don't try to be funny; they naturally are.

Napoleon is a geek who gets slammed into lockers constantly, and who is a big fan of tetherball.  Along comes a newbie; Pedro Sanchez, who is also not so bright.  Alongside them, is a girl named Deb, who drinks 2% milk.  They make a team, and the movie shows you their adventures of Deb trying to be a photographer, Pedro trying to run for president, and Napoleon trying to dance.

On the other side, you have Napoleon's uncle who comes to visit, and Napoleon's brother, who meets a pretty black girl named LaFonDuh.

The movie travels constantly from the stories about Napoleon and his friends, to his brother and uncle.  Watch this movie and you'll be laughing constantly.

P.S. Try not to stare at Napoleon's teeth; I almost threw-up doing it...",1108771200,,1070,4.58421052631579
1559234,5,B00005JNBQ,"Obviously a love it or hate it type of a movie.  I'll tell ya though, I had absolutely NO opinions on this movie whatsoever before I rented it.  Actually it looked sort of stupid.  I watched it and laughed a handful of times.

Well then I waited a couple of days and popped it in again.  CRACKED UP.  I guess you don't pay as close of attention the first time, but the second time you know what to expect and it's hilarious.  I've watched it five times now and it keeps getting funnier.

There is a portion of the population with an odd sense of humor.  I guess I'm one of them.",1108684800,5,578,4.089285714285714
1559235,4,B00005JNBQ,"When my sister rented Napoleon Dynamite at Blockbuster the other night, I didint expect much out of the movie, seeing as the title charachter looked really strange, and the adds that were run during the theatrical release didint help to win me over.  After watching the movie, I admit that it was a plesant little suprise that had me chuckling a lot during my initial viewing.

If you want me to tell you what the plot is, I really won't get anywhere, because the movie has no real plot.  It's just a glimpse at the life of a high school nerd as he goes through a roughtly a month of his life.  As the movie moves from scene to scene, you never really know what to expect.  There's everything from a speech about japanese scientists trying to kill the loch ness monster, to time machines that need crystals to work.  The whole thing is so bizzare that it defies explenation.

In an age where movies routinely have guns and huge explosions, Napoleon Dynamite has none of those things.  There's no special effects at work, there are no CGI elements, nothing.  The movie relies on it's charachters, and all of them turn in stellar performances.  Jon Heder is PERFECT as Napoleon.  With his monstorous 70's style glasses and ever open mouth, he's perfect as your steryotype nerd.  I love how his expression never changes during the movie.  I got the feeling that if he saw a nuclear explosion, he'd still have that bored look on his face.  It's a delight watching him.  The supporting cast is equally good, such as Napoleons dweeb thirty-fivish brother, his 80's obsessed uncle and the lovable Pedro.

Other little things stand out here.  The music is both odd and disturbingly catchy.  The scenery of gorgeous Idaho is, well...gorgeous!  I love how Napoleon's house is retro 70's style, which matches his personality perfectly.  And a special nod must go to the dialoge, which has some of the funniest bits i've heard in years.  My favorite?  A certian scene with tupperware, ""Dangit!""

In conclusion, I find Napoleon Dynamite to be an interesting movie that is really quirky and has a lot of charm.  I'd certianlly be interested in ""Napoleon Dynamite 2"" if they ever create one.",1108684800,,2176,4.695767195767195
1559326,2,B00005JNBQ,"If this was supposed to be social criticism, it's not. If this was supposed to be funny, it's not. If this was supposed to be avant guard, it's not.

This film is weighed down by a desperation to be quirky and esoteric. I can just see the sweat on the screenwriters as they draw up the weirdest people they can imagine, which in reality is a serious case of writer's block. The problem mainly arises when the director refuses to stop assuming that the viewer thinks inactivity and vacuity is infinitely humorous. The acting is overly deadpan, stiff and lethargic-which I assume is on purpose. What ensues is viewer irritation after 10 minutes. This is especially true since the spurts of energy that we do see are irrelevant and gag oriented. This is a series of plotless vignettes,literally plodding on for 1 and 1/2 hours. The humor is odd and the director so self satisfied with his own smugness he didn't step back to think that esoteric for the sake of esoteric is...weird? Weird for weird sake begets confusion and loss of interest. As the Amazon review points out, there is no sense of disgust and anger-so we get twee 8 year old humor.

This is an Indie film for people who don't like indies.",1108684800,2,1200,4.576744186046511
1559327,4,B00005JNBQ,"I started out disliking this movie.  I just wasn't laughing much. Napoleon (Jon Heder) is so awkward that it's difficult for his character to gain traction at first.  He's just not very likable - not even in a sad sack sort of way. OK. But it just isn't Napoleon.  His family is an assorted bunch of nuts you've come to expect now in Indie films, and that means there's plenty of dead air and blank stares.  So much so that you're remembering the same ""realistic"" devices used in Indie films like ""Ghost World,"" ""The Station Agent,"" or ""Welcome to the Doll House.""  Don't' get me wrong, I love all those films - but with ""Napoleon"" there is a studied sameness that lacks the freshness of those movies.  Whatever.  So why did I like this?  Well, the movie's kind of sneaky in how it accomplishes this.  Basically, Napoleon starts to come out of his shell due to friendships he begins to forge (despite himself) - with kids that are almost as awkward as himself - in particular, Pedro, his best friend, and Deb, his budding love interest  (played effectively by Efren Ramirez and Tina Majorino).  And one virtue Napoleon has is loyalty to his friends. Further, most high schools are overwhelmingly populated by Napoleons, Pedros, and Debs, and not by the beautiful few, who always seem to run the yearbooks and win the class elections.  The end of the movie sealed things for me.  Napoleon, in an act of friendship, shows he has the stuff, and all is right with the world.  This is probably a three star movie, but there is a genuine sweetness that bumps it up one for me.  On top of that, my kids loved it (Napoleon is hugely popular with young teens - and it's not hard to see why).",1108684800,,1682,4.4868421052631575
1559328,5,B00005JNBQ,"People quote this movie way too much. It was hilarious when nobody knew about it, but now it's way to over quoted. Jared Hess makes an unforgettable directorial debut with NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, a hilarious, tender, and original portrait of a truly eccentric character. Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) is a high-school outcast in every sense of the word. More interested in playing tetherball by himself and drawing pictures of his favorite animal, the ""liger"" (a combination of a lion and a tiger), Napoleon is ignored by everyone in his tiny hometown of Preston, Idaho. At home, things aren't much better. His uber-nerd older brother Kip and ultra-vain Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) are too busy with their own obsessions to give Napoleon the time of day. It isn't until a new student, Pedro, arrives that Napoleon finds friendship and performs an act of brave defiance that makes him a true hero. Written by Hess and his wife Jerusha, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE masterfully captures the awkwardness of high school without succumbing to condescension. Most of this can be attributed to Heder, who steps into Napoleon's moon boots with a jaw-dropping flawlessness. The rest of the cast is just as natural, underplaying their roles and letting the comedy unfold without forcing any of the jokes. This is also one of the most unusual movies ever to be told on film. People please quit quoting this movie! You're ruining it for others.",1108598400,,1411,4.983050847457627
1559329,5,B00005JNBQ,"In my experience with this film most people who watch it have one of a few reactions. Here they are:

1.""I can't believe how boring and pointless that movie was.""

2.""That movie was so stupid it's funny. I could've made a movie like that.""

3.""That was the most fun I've had watching a movie in a long time!""

A small group of people end up in the, ""Yeah, it was kinda funny"" group. In other words, if you still haven't seen this, chances are you'll either love it or hate it. I loved it. When I walked out of the theater after watching this film I said to my wife, ""That was the most fun I've had watching a movie in a long time."" I watch about a movie a month.

A lot of the people in the first group tend to complain of  the movie's lack of plot. Many of these same people also claim that those of us who enjoyed this movie did so at Napoleon's expense- i.e. we laugh because we feel superior to him (see the above Amazon review.) I disagree with both notions. The plot certainly is simple and it's often obscured by the near continual stream of one-liners and gags. But there is a story here. It's about a nerdy kid and his nerdy friends who end up achieving more  than they  ever expected to and make themselves happy along the way.

But few people, if any, are going around telling their friends to see this movie because of the great feel good story. Most people that enjoyed this film enjoyed it because they laughed so hard at all the gags and one-liners. I know I did.

But I wasn't laughing because I felt superior to Napoleon and all the real life people he represents. I laughed because  I know, to a degree, what it's like to be Napoleon. I sat in class drawing ""medieval warriors"" and whatnot. I set up plywood ramps on the sidewalk in front of my house to ride my bike over. I remember regarding the popular girls as some sort of unattainable goddesses, and the dudes they hung around with as meathead jocks. I'm not alone here, and I'm not trying to portray myself as part of some sort of nerd elite. Most people can relate to what I'm talking about. Yeah, the character of Napoleon took the whole idea to an extreme. But would the movie have been funny if it didn't? Of course not.

So if you haven't seen this movie and you're wondering whether you'll like it, be aware that the humor is simple and the story is simpler. And don't feel guilty for laughing at Napoleon. Odds are you or someone you know probably have a little in common with him. That's why I found it so fun to watch.",1108598400,10,2502,4.24421052631579
1559330,5,B00005JNBQ,"Sometimes the hilarity of a moment comes through a discourse or sentence that cuts through the boundaries of life and stops a conversation dead. Napoleon Dynamite is full of one liners that my friends and I just can't stop saying, and they're the kinds of things that we can equate with so many of the other people we know.

The art of this film is that it portrays its heroes and villains in such a subtle way. We learn to sympathize with Pedro in his rise to glory. Our hearts cry out in anger against the bullish nature of Uncle Rico and the popular kids. Still, we cannot help but leave this movie mourning the sadness of all the lives represented.

This movie is not without happy endings. Redemption comes in the form of relationships as we see healing borne in Grandma and her reuniting with her beloved llama. Rico is found again by a lost love who hated to dwell on the past. Kip draws together two cultures as he marries someone who is so completely different than himself.

I laughed out loud in the theater when I watched this movie, and again when I watched it with my wife. It's great to watch something that can be so funny and yet still not be bombarded with sexual innuendo (with the exception of Rico's prescribed herbal enhancers and the principal's odd smile while watching highschoolers dance) and rampant violence.

The DVD itself is full of wonderful features, great commentaries, and is double sided (full screen or wide screen). If you don't buy it, then at least try it. Be warned, however, as most all either hate the movie or they love it.",1108598400,4,1567,4.5265017667844525

For the most part however, this movie was a complete waste of time.  Keep in mind that I'm someone who would kill to star in a Paul Thomas Anderson movie and count Empire of the Sun and Magnolia as two of my favorite ever movies, right alongside The Shawshank Redemption.  I also have six DVD's of the best of Beavis and Butthead also and the Collector's Edition of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, so you can't say that I don't appreciate dead-pan comedy.  But those works still have some art and love in them and perfect delivery combined with actual PLOTS and PUNCHLINES.  This movie was just plain dry almost all the way through.  The one-liners were lame and monotonous.  There was no plot or point to this whole movie.  You can see that I need to appreciate on a subtle level, which there was none of.  Or maybe I'm just looking for some actual action, drama, or comedy.  I don't know about you, but that's certainly what I watch movies for.  I think the only real reason that this movie was successful was because it was promoted by MTV, yet was so different from what they usually promote.  Hell, if you want good comedy from MTV, watch Orange County.  This was just sad however.  Save your money and go see The Aviator or Ray instead.",1108598400,2,1409,4.344827586206897

The first time I saw Napoleon Dynamite in the theaters, I didn't really like it.  Then I got the DVD as a gift, and enjoyed it much more the second time.  I guess I didn't have any expectations the second time, and the characters take a little time to get used to.  The DVD commentary fetaures the director and others talking about the movie.  Watch it and you'll see just how weird we Idaho/Utah folks are.  The movie is instantly quotable, and proves that a money-making movie can be made without profanity or sex.  The DVD is worth buying, because there's a short, independent film called Peluca on it that Napoleon Dynamite was based on.  The short film is hilarious, more funny than almost anything in the actual movie.  The short is pretty stupid too, but you can't help but laugh.  I still don't understand how this movie got so big.

""Yeah?  Well, who's the only one here who knows illegal ninja moves from the government?""

I don't agree with his assessment that this film is depressing, and the only people who would laugh at Napoleon are people who feel superior to him. I laughed because I think anyone who wasn't part of the ""popular"" crowd in high school can relate to Napoleon's efforts to make a place for himself in his school and get a girl, regardless of how cluelessly he goes about it. Most people who were a little different from their peers as a teenager can relate to Napoleon, Pedro and Deb and their crusade against the shallow popular kids who look down on them. I had a friend in high school who ran for a student council position using a crazy gimmick - it didn't work for him, but this movie made me remember that and laugh. The movie is basically plotless but unbelievably funny. A lot of the humor is ""laugh at, not laugh with"" but does that make it a bad film? No.
I think this compares a lot with ""The Big Lebowski"" (another incredibly funny movie) in that it's a picture about misfits and the lives they lead, and the ham-handed, screwball ways they go about accomplishing a goal. Just like Jeff Lebowski, Napoleon is unlikeable in a lot of ways, but the character is so earnest it's hard not to develop some kind of affection for him.

Most of the people who are giving this movie 1-star reviews are either functionally illiterate or they use lots of really large, complicated words in their reviews so they can sound as pompous and elitist as possible.

Well, once again I find myself asking: Has Roger Ebert lost his mind? He gave this film one and a half stars. That is, frankly, inane. He makes a comparison between this film and films with Adam Sandler, saying that you like an Adam Sandler film because Adam Sandler is in the film, and this is the type of film that falls into that category.

Wow. Was he on drugs?

He has certainly lost whatever edge he had when Gene Siskel passed away, and that's seen in so, so many films that he has reviewed since that sad day. I can't help but think that if ""Siskel and Ebert"" was still a show, if Siskel was still alive, that Ebert would have realized that this film isn't simply a stupid film about a character we're not supposed to like.

OK. Is Napoleon Dynamite a character we're supposed to like or relate to? If you've ever been in high school, which most of us have, we have seen a character like Napoleon Dynamite. He is absolutely clueless, is a ""nerd"" to the thousandth degree - but that's why we like him! If we're still in high school, then perhaps we would laugh at him and think it's not only funny, but appropriate, for him to be picked on and teased by his peers. However, most of us are out of high school, and most of us - if we have any sense of moral decency - regret that we ever made fun of or picked on anyone like Napoleon. To me, THAT is part of what this film is about. His ""victory"" at the end is not something to be mocked. It's more of a victory that would probably come years down the road - but that wasn't the nature of this film, so they showed us that victory in a somewhat shortened sense.

One of the most memorable lines in the film to me was Napoleon's comment that (and this may be paraphrased) ""girls like guys who have skills"". Was that not true in high school? Of course it was! I know many girls that I went to high school with that deeply regret the indifference they showed to people like Napoleon. I myself, while not being a ""jock stud"" feel awful when I think of the people that I completely neglected or poked fun at people like Napoleon. Heck, to some people, I was Napoleon. This was very gutsy and accurate portrayal of high school.

So what's wrong with a film where the ""nerd"" comes out on top? Absolutely nothing.

And what's wrong if we laugh along the way? The humor was so subtle, not side-splitting laughter, but it was there. And that was the essence of the film: subtlety. It wasn't going out of its way to make you laugh, to try and make you feel sorry for Napoleon - it was simply demonstrating a particular existence. And it was done remarkably well. And it gave you several laughs along the way.

All of the actors fit their roles perfectly - again with the same subtlety. If you want Adam Sandler, this isn't the film for you, and Ebert was really off base when he drew that comparison.",1108166400,2,2856,4.256457564575646
1559571,5,B00005JNBQ,"Roger Ebert must have been having a bad day when he reviewed this film because he completely whiffed this one. There is a great deal more to Napoleon Dynamite than may appear with one viewing.

Every once in awhile, a movie comes along that demonstrates an understanding of humanity that is profound.  I believe this is one of those movies.

On the surface, it is a humorous movie about nerdy kids and their daily lives.  The movie is not laughing out loud funny, nor is it a ""nerd kids strike back at the system"" formula movie. Beneath that surface, there is an important message about the inherent nobility and value possible in every human being, no matter what their surface appearance. There are no Hollywood stars or Hollywood pretentiousness. The story is small, local, evenly paced and engaging.

Napolean is pushed around and mocked by classmates, but he seems to accept it as part of his existence. He is perfectly content with who he is and knows, accurately, the problems are with whom everyone else thinks he is.  When he has the opportunity to ""pay back"" those humiliating him, he does it in an entirely creative and satisfying way.

There is no violence and no humiliation in his response to his peers.  He wins because he demonstrates nobility, talent, and loyalty to his friends that raises him above those who demean him.  He uses his innate humanity to shine a bright light on the shallowness of those that would place themselves above him.

His friends and relatives, each on the surface a ""loser,"" get the opportunity to individually rise above the audiences automatic expectations of their ""loser-ness"" and become fully important and credible people.

I would highly recommend this film as an excellent family film, especially for families with kids in middle school and high school. The film asks you to examine your perceptions of others around you.  Are you one of the people who mock those whom you perceive as nerds, or are you more like Napolean?  Perhaps a little of each?

Either way, the movie is a refreshing affirmation of the best aspects of humanity and hopefully, you can watch it and apply its lessons to your own life.",1108166400,13,2156,4.776280323450135
1559572,4,B00005JNBQ,"I found myself snickering a lot during this movie - not so much laughing out loud. It has a real subtle style, some might even call it bland, it's not for everyone. Napoleon is the guy you either ignored or beat up in high school (or you were him) - he tells tall tales of his prowess with a bow staff! His pasty-skinned brother, an uncle stuck in his own past glory days and the shy girl with a crush are all perfectly crafted as well. My favorite scenes were when Napoleon drew the picture of the girl he wanted to take to the dance for her and his note was like 'there's plenty more where this came from' and the drawing is the most grotesque, childish likeness of the girl. Then when Pedro is running for class president, Napoleon gives a nerd getting bullied a boondoggle keychain and says 'Pedro offers you his protection', then when the school bully tries to take the kid's bike, Pedro's cousins in the low rider come by. There are lots of great little moments, mostly when Napoleon is in his own little, oblivious world of Ligers and whatnot.",1108166400,4,1050,4.38974358974359

Jared Hess--you're a genius. Thank you for making me laugh--and yes--I will ""vote for Pedro"" ! I so recommend this hilarious movie.",1108080000,3,651,4.8558558558558556

From the brilliant opening credits by the legendary 70-year-old title designer Pedro Ferro (""Dr. Strangelove, Stop Making Sense, Men in Black"") to the ending disco beat of ""The Promise"" by 'When in Rome', Jared Hess constructs a true-to-life vision of his hometown Preston, Idaho that had me rolling in on the floor, falling in love with characters that I would never go near in real life. Jon Heder (who is clearly too old to play the title character) lets nothing stand in his way of creating the ultimate nerd. With Pedro at his side (Efren Ramirez) the two get mocked, humiliated and asswhupped until the final amazing cathartic ending that shows the small joys of friendship and affection. Jon Gries (from 'Get Shorty') as Uncle Rico is a scream as over the hill jock and coniving tupperware salesman. DVD transfer is quite good and the deleted scenes are awesome.

Hell, some of us were Napoleon Dynamite in high school. It's that feeling of connection that makes this film so fun and heart-warming. There were a few moments in the movie in which I knew I was laughing at the awkwardness of this geeky kid, but more often, I knew that I was laughing at myself, at the awkwardness that I felt as  a kid.

There was definitely a deliberate quirkiness to the characters that seemed a bit formulaic in the indie/cult genre and was rather annoying at first. Creating characters so cartoonishly geek ridden and over the top for its own sake is simply not enough to carry a movie. I just hope the next generation of such films doesn't resort merely to funky hair, tacky clothes, and a spazoid demeanor and merely ride those JC Penny coattails. That being said, I have to admit Aaron Ruell's Kip character really grew on me like a matted down fungus. I can't get his lame poetry, weak nasal speech, and bad posture out of my head. I actually worked with someone who was eerily similar and planned to buy a missile silo so, in that sense, his character was believable. Also, kudos to Tina Majorino for taking a break from the pratfalls of the child actress to come back with a valiant effort as a relatively invisible high school student.

As for the plot, hmmmm. What actually happened? Napolean gets Pedro elected class president, wins the cute wallflower, and his brother Kip, transformed into a hip hop philosopher, leaves town with his internet babe LaFawnduh. Even Uncle Rico is joined by some oddly intrigued cameo babe while videotaping himself throwing the pigskin in a field.

I wasn't sure what to expect from this film going in, having heard it was an indie favorite.  Yes, it was quirky but was it likable?  Not really.  Oddball outcast Napoleon Dynamite struggles in a world he never made, while is simpering brother and nostalgia ridden hairpiece of an uncle provide backup fodder.  Character development was minute to non-existant.  Granted, Napoleon and brother `came out' of their shells, but we are left wondering about the rest of this odd Idaho world.  Uncle Rico while at times amusing should have stayed in the basement of Real Genius.  The lead is simply not very compelling and a bit too force clichd for those of us who did our high school time in the 80's.

It deterred me even more when I saw the ""MTV Films"" logo jump into the screen at the beginning. But to my surprise, Napoleon Dynamite turned out to be a smart, and uniquely funny independent film.

You can't help but feel pity for most of the characters in this film. Uncle Rico's delusional dreams of being an all-star quarterback circa 1982. Pedro, the quiet pinata smashing Mexican, or poor Deb, who's just trying to raise money for college. Kip (Napoleon's Brother) is one of the stranger characters in the film, who seems to be gay, but is in love with LaFawnduh, a voluptuous black woman he met over the internet. For whatever reason, these characters are very appealing to the average movie watcher.

Although the movie has little to no plot, it doesn't pale in originality. So many of the jokes are different, dry and satirical, that some of them slip through the cracks. This film is great for repeat watching, just because it is so unique, and so many of the jokes are like ""What!?""; it just makes you want to see them again. I would say that young geeks like myself would like this movie the most, but it seems that geeks of all ages relate to the movie equally.

1559651,5,B00005JNBQ,"Napoleon Dynamite is a loser who goes to high school and is treated fairly well considering how much of a loser he is.  He wears t-shirts tucked into perfectly-fit jeans, the bottoms of which are tucked into snowboots, which is interesting considering not a flake of snow falls in the entire film, although he is from Idaho, where perhaps snow is something that if it's not falling outside, it's falling in your mind.  His one friend is Pedro, the only Latin-American student in a school filled with blonde-haired, blue-eyed wunderkinds.

Actually the people who makeup the school, and the surrounding town, are quite fascinating.  They're not gorgeous, or classically beautiful, but grotesque.  That is; they could be beautiful, or at least considered attractive, but there's an element of ugliness to them, some sort of black smudge on the colorful canvas.  Napoleon is emblematic of this in that he is grotesque himself; his hair is curly and uncontrollable, his clothes are almost purposefully unattractive, his slouch and his half-closed eyes make him look as unalert as a rock.  So is everyone around him; unalert to the qualities that make them grotesque (although that is essentially what being grotesque is; you have to not know you are).

Enough about grotesqueries!  Pedro decides to run for class president to bring balance to the darkness that is the other candidate, the plucky Summer.  She is the ""most popular girl"" in school, and is surely a lock to win.  The futility of Pedro's chances of winning lend a pity to his character that we might feel for Napoleon if he wasn't so blatantly unconcerned with his own popularity.  Pedro has no idea what to say in his pre-election speech; but Napoleon says, either out of exasperation or genuine concern, ""Tell them if they vote for you then all their wildest dreams will come true.""  Hmm.  Sounds like a throwaway line at first, but Pedro delivers it at the end of a speech that is sure to lose him the election.  It makes you wonder why he really cares about winning the election, especially since he seemed to understand how futile it all was.  To make things even more hopeless, after his speech, he must deliver a skit.  A skit?  Pedro has no clue, and he's even less animated than Napoleon.

Then comes one of the most touching scenes I have ever seen.  Napoleon gives a dance-mix tape to the guy running the PA, goes on stage, and dances to ""Canned Heat.""  Then you realize that underneath that facade of unawareness and passivity is a genuine friend.  He basically lays his life on the line if you think about it; for how would the entire school treat him afterwards if they took it the wrong way?  He could barely set foot in that High School if it failed, his life would be made miserable day after day.  But it works!  They roar with applause; and Pedro becomes class president.

Amazingly all ends meet, in a movie without a punchline.  What happens to Napoleon now though?  I assume he keeps going down his own path, where he'll stumble into greatness, whether he knows it or not.",1107734400,8,3053,4.720226843100189

It is not your typical ""teen nerd gets revenge on the cool kids"" fare.  The main character, Napoleon, is not a doormat for anyone and truly lives his life without needing acceptance.  His friends Pedro and Deb are also very interesting characters, along with Napoleon's quirky family.

1559753,3,B00005JNBQ,"It's fairly safe to say, this far into the 21st century, that the decade of '00' seriously lacks a cultural identity/movement of its own, at least in contrast to the past five decades: the war years of the 40's, the isolationist Americana of the 50's, the Aquarius Ideals of the 60's, the decadence and disco-tinge of the 70's, the Me-Decade excess of the 80's, the angst and 'alternative' option of the 90's.  Thus, over the past couple years, an increasingly wistful, decidedly kitsche assimilation of the styles and media-motifs of the immediate-past has crept into the mass-consciousness, especially for those of the '00' youth, inexperienced and adrift on the ripple-shock tides of a simultaneous informational over-abundance and widespread social repression/reactionary meme in the wake of 9-11.  The ridiculous visual hubris and innocuous ignorance that seem intimately tied to the 70's and the 80's have become attractive to those seeking career revitalization (Gwen Stefani and Outkast being prominent recent examples) and for those wishing to ape a personal neo-retro style that, in equal measure quirky and twee, turns back from the sterile fashions of futurism, the devastating deconstruction of knowing too much, too soon (or, perhaps more truthfully, knowing too much and not nearly enough).  To wit: so chaotic and complex is our contemporary social animal, that retreating into golden-hued nostalgia, as propagated by VH1, is incredibly seductive to the scions of the Post-Cold War Information Era, a womb of unrepentant confidence and social ideal so sorely lacking in these trying times.  You know, back when our plutocratic-puppet president was actually a ~good actor~; back when men teased their hair with aplomb and were considered the macho quintessence; back when the cultural identity was safe, with easy pickings for either path of conformity or rebellion.  ""Things were better back then"" - which is all nonsense, of course, like most nostalgic reflection: despite the more fantastical Hollywood archive of the 70's and 80's, that era was plagued with just as much uncertainty and threatening factors as we are now: AIDS, Nuclear Holocaust, economic depression/inflation, Iran-Contra, corporation corruption and drug-addled inner city denizens...  The Grass is always Greener two decades past.

Thus the timely release of *Napoleon Dynamite*, a movie that capitalizes on this retreat into the past, reveling in unabashed kitsche and resurrecting the hoary Revenge of the Nerd archetype within a firmly-80's teen-comedy structure.  The look of the film is carefully, meticulously crafted: fashion from the late 70's, video cassette players from the early 80's, the fake-organic interior decoration made popular in the 60's; complete with knick-knacks and kitsche of any era, including plastic green toy-soldiers and the random thrift-store sai.  Yet late-90's elements insinuate themselves into the film, defying our attempt to define it to this or that era: chat-rooms and the music of Jamiroquai and the Backstreet Boys inform the audience that the environment of *Napoleon Dynamite* is actually that of a time-warp Idaho local, past and present intrinsically woven via cultural artifacts, verbal expressions and the overall ambience of the film total, much like Wes Anderson's uber-quirky exegesis *The Royal Tenembaums*.  Past and the just-past merge; the threatening cloud of the future is utterly banished in this ugly-duckling fairy tale.  In this regard, I find *Napoleon Dynamite* to be a brilliant example of our retro-seduction, a borderline-exploitative wish fulfillment juggernaught with the ability to tempt the kitsche-craving of any age or temperament.

And yet, as a film, I found Napoleon Dynamite sadly lacking, ineffectual as entertainment and about as deep as anything else stamped with the MTV seal of production, a somewhat boring affair that only incidentally rises above its trend-conglomeration ethic to produce a surprised chuckle.  Obviously I'm in the minority here, given the glowing reviews both on this page and from most mainstream critics; to give further example, this film was recommended to me from a high-school work associate who claimed he'd watched it four times in just two days.  It touched him, quite deeply, for reasons I suspect are congruent with my beginning-paragraph thesis.  I, however, struggled with this movie.  Napoleon himself is an unsympathetic caricature of the everyman geek; the fact that he so obviously ""lacks skills"" means that almost all comedic triggers associated with his actions and attitudes are a matter of laughing ~at~, rather than laughing ~with~.  Even worse, Pedro is the ultimate construction of a stereotype, tiptoeing around offensiveness.  Why does he want to be class president? Even Pedro doesn't know.  More interesting are Napoleon's brother, the grandmamma's boy seeking soul-mate status, and his uncle, a football-jock relic lost in the glory-days of `82.  Nearly all of those surprised chuckles I mentioned before stemmed from these two characters, but even they are not enough to sustain the movie as a whole.

Now, it may seem that I'm being overtly harsh with this film, but I couldn't escape the notion that a good deal of *Napoleon Dynamite* was crippled by artistic laziness, an inescapable developmental ~complacency~ in regard to the core material.  Again and again, moments of potential humor lose substance; doubtless profound connotations are laid waste by the need to be clever.  This could have been a five-star classic, instead of the naval-gazing faux-indie anticlimax it ends up being.  Alas.

To my surprise, the movie disappointed me thoroughly.  Begining slow and coming to an even slower pace, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is the pitiful and longwinded story of a highschool nerd and his struggle for girls and class presidency.  Filled with random bouts of what is supposed to be comedy and cheap-shots at high school satire, this movie breathes endless monotony and undeveloped emotions.  The characters are boring and without feelings (although the acting on the mexican student character's and the photography girl's character was done quite well) and i found myself constantly being bored with Napoleon's continuous cynisism.  The script itself wanders all over the place, giving most of the interaction no purpose or consequence, so most of the scenes are pointless.  This film may be found funny by those who see themselves as better humans than Napoleon and his friends, but for the rest of us who just want to enjoy well-made, well-written indie films, this heap of trash is at the substratum of my list of horribly bad films.",1107561600,11,1185,5.1139896373057

These three works, more than most any others, put you in the skin of similarly alienated and isolated adolescents, and make it clear that whoever you are, all you can do is your best (like Napoleon and Rushmore's Max Fisher, unlike Catcher's Holden Caulfield).

Speaking of Napoleon Dynamite specifically, let me just say that while far from a perfect product, this film restored my faith in the System to find and reward the efforts of those who ignore the big studio gate-keepers and star-driven, formulaic, Hollywood pablum machine.

Everyone was urging me to see it, claiming it was the ""funniest movie ever!"". So I succumbed, (no, not agreed, SUCCUMBED)and saw the movie.

It generally started off slow, and then took a gradual dip in pace- before stopping completely! This movie was awful. Horridly filmed and acted(even for a dumb movie) with a slow, boring pace, and a script pockmarked with failed humor.

I tried to laugh, I really did, but nothing came out. I just couldn't. Something was missing, besides a plot and a good joke.

Now, this review may prompt you too see it just so you can witness how dumb it really is, but even that is a waste of time. This movie is a disgrace to the film industry, and fails even as a movie trying to be dumb. It's worse then dumb: it's bad.

With trapper keepers and caboodles and wacky t-shirts and off color matching wardrobes, I was sure it was 85 or 86. Only to come and realize near the end that Napoleon Dynamite ( every high schools nerd ) and all his friends weren't actually living in the 80's but only in Idaho and anytown that hasn't exactly progressed with the rest of America. It is a hilarious and completely unique funny film with mostly unknown actors ( which just adds to it's believability )

and there is no profanity, no nudity or sexual references, all the humor lies within an open mouthed, eyes wide shut when speaking teenager, a shy girl, Deb who promotes herself door to door and offers to take ""glamour like shots"" for a discount at up to 75% off. Pedro, a simple English speaking kid who dreams of asking out the popular girl Summer and becoming school president.

There were times where I thought to my self, ""Am I supposed to laugh here?"" and I also kept one eye on the timer to see how much longer there was. Overall, though, I wasn't as happy with the presentation of the movie and the thoughtfullness of it all. There were times where I knew it was supposed to be funny, but it wasn't.

Remember the paper-thin plot, and how some scenes (shooting the horse?!) didn't make all that much sense? Here's your Animal House for the new century--Napoleon Dynamite.

  Perhaps you have to have grown up with a certain type of ""boy"" (a stupid-acting brother, a joking dad, an annoying next door neighbor kid) in your household to really get the humor in this movie...and it helps to have grown up in a small rural town like Preston where absolutely NOTHING happens for months on end.  This is Napoleon's life, and while his life isn't as bad as some reviewers have made it out to be (where DID these people grow up? obviously, somewhere more exciting than I did), it's certainly one filled with everyday annoyances: dumb older brother still living at home, weird uncle, sexually suspect grandma, and an arrogant llama. He escapes via his imagination: he draws unreal animals and visualizes himself as a numchuck-swingin' stud.

  The performances make this movie, as its plot is the visual equivalent of a to-do list. Jon Heder's brilliance as Napoleon, the nerd in search of imaginative life, complements perfectly  the rest of the cast's offbeat, but  very real, performances of everyday people doing everyday things.

  Only someone  young could make this--Jared Hess is 24-- but I've met several middle-aged folks who said it was priceless, and one of the funniest films they've ever seen.

The film from a technical standpoint has some very memorable scenes, well executed in many ways.  The acting isn't flat, but the characters are very socially awkward (extremely so) and I believe that, mixed with the setting of the Main Character's home and ""style"" makes this movie difficult for some.  I know some of my students couldn't figure out a time frame, thinking it was in the early 80's, but its a matter of missing the setting and character traits.  Pay attention.

Plot:  Teen movie of loner who doesnt fit in, finds a friend, finds romance, wins the day.  The interesting dynamic is that he stills stays within himself, transforming himself within the confines.  Instead of stepping into new territories and new identity, he retains who he is and gains ""skills.""  Its the misconception of the acquiring of skills that's funny.  Look at the culture and the role models.

Laugh out loud moments you've seen, but there are better ones in it not seen.  Some lines are obviously going to be picked up by HS crowd and repeated and repeated, and frankly, that's sad because it turns people away.

1559979,1,B00005JNBQ,"I think Clarissa Garcia's review was spot-on.

While everybody has a different sense of humor, I simply do not understand how this movie is considered ""funny."" Most of the characters appear bored in their roles, reciting their apathetic lines in emotionless monotone. This can be funny if done well, but only when well-written. If just about any conversation in the movie were removed, it wouldn't significantly effect the (alleged) flow of the movie.

An example of a conversation (paraphrased since I don't recall the exact lines--they weren't very memorable).:

Napoleon to Pedro: What will you do when you ask her out.

Pedro: I don't know, maybe make her a cake or something.

Napoleon: Oh, okay.

In general, the rest of the dialogue is similar--eventless and mostly pointless. Some movies are intentionally funny (American Pie and similar pure comedy movies), some are not meant to be funny but end up being so due to clever writers, and some try to be funny and fail miserably due to mindless stupidity (Big Mama's House, Undercover Brother). Napoleon Dynamite is none of those--it doesn't seem to try to be funny and doesn't succeed in being funny--it just exists

While nobody watches this kind of movie expecting a deep plot or insightful dialog, most people at least expect more than a string of unrelated events that have no tie-in due to the lack of some measure of plot, point, or reason for existance. This film seems to me little more than a documentary on a few weeks of the lives of a few boring people. I'd compare it to Blair Witch in some ways, mostly in the ""waste of time"" department.

The pariah could be an ugly duckling teen girl as in She's All That or a whole cast of teen misfits of both sex's as in Things I like About You.  Napoleon Dynamite takes these concepts to their logical conclusion thereby closing out any possibility that future teen saga's could be original.

Are there mentally challenged adolescents in modern civilization like Napoleon or his dim internet-dating brother?  I always asked that question about the Three Stooges.

I'm not claiming any intellectual superiority or great film taste... it's just that I get it.

Perhaps because I see elements of Napoleon Dynamite in me.  For instance... his response on the bus ""whatever I feel like.  Gosh!"" When I was in 4th grade I moved from a northern town in Illinois (Geneseo) to a small town called Lousville (pronounced Lewis-ville) in very southern Illinois where the culture was very different and people had Alabama-like accents.  When I was riding on the schoolbus, my first day in mid-semester, I was petrified.  Everyone stared at me as they stopped at my delapidated trailer to pick me up.  A little girl turned around and asked ""What's your naaaaame?"" To which I replied ""shuuuuuuuuuuuut uuuuuup!"" And from that day on was greeted by everyone in unison shouting ""HI SHUUUUUTUUUP"" as I walked on the bus.  My reply was out of a vain effort at self-defense... not mean-ness.. and so was Napoleons.

Napoleon's journey was a remarkable, willful transformation, as was that of Deb and Pedro.  Kip was amusingly transformed, but not so much with self-awareness.  Uncle Rico was the only static character, which made it all the more funny because he had not changed since 1982.

Of all the lines, the one where Napleon told Deb to get her stuff  because there wasn't enough room for his nunchucks made me laugh the most hysterically.

Almost all the humor, other than ""the dance"" was rooted in hilarious subtlety and satire.  I mean, how could I not be floored by someone bragging about chatting with hot babes online.... ALL DAY!

The bizarre time-period (An elegant collage of the 70's, 80's, and 90's) gives this film a wide audience and uses silly things from all decades to make it more hilarious.

My conclusion is that people who don't like this movie are either  1) TOO nerdy to realize they are only the one side of the nerdy characters  2) They ARE Summer Wheatley 3) People like Roger Ebert who are absolutely clueless about the level of subtle humor in this film.

To the people comparing this to laughing at clowns... their reviews had me laughing as much as the movie... it's a total comedy in itself.  ND is not a clown, he's flippin Superman in moonboots with a fro!

The ONLY other DVD I own is Monty Python's the Holy Grail... which also has incredibly intelligent subtle humor woven into the surface silliness.

For the intellect and the funny bone, I give ND a 5/5 stars.  As far as those complaining about the ""terrible"" soundtrack, I wish I could give it 6/5 stars for having ""Forever Young"" by Alphaville and ""The Promise"" by When In Rome as too of the main songs in the soundtrack.

This thing just gets funnier the more I watch it.

P.S.  Dear Roger Ebert... please watch this film again, then watch the piece of junk that ""Garfield"" is, and look at yourself in the mirror and cry.",1107043200,56,2908,4.650980392156863

The first words out of Napoleon's mouth in response to a question about what he's going to do that day were, ""I'll do whatever I want to do. Gosh!"" Then he proceeds to throw an action figure out the window of the school bus tied to a piece of string. My brothers-in-law who had already seen the movie repeated the line and then all started laughing hysterically when he threw the GI Joe out the window. I said to myself, ""This is stupid."" My wife muttered to me, ""I can't believe we're wasting out time watching this.""

Then you start to realize that the stupider the movie got, the funnier everybody who had seen it thought it was. By about twenty minutes in, I started laughing out loud. By the end of the DVD, I started watching it again and found myself repeated the lines. Now, three weeks later, I find that Napoleon Dynamite's ""dorky,"" ""geeky,"" ""nerdy,"" and all the other adjectives that reviewers have used to describe him have become part of my vocabulary. My wife and I regularly find ourselves responding to each other like Pedro, ""Yes,"" ""No,"" ""Build her a cake or something,"" and ""Is she hot?""

1560204,5,B00005JNBQ,"I'm probably 30-35 years older than this film's optimal audience, but I loved ""Napoleon Dynamite.""

The obvious comparison is ""Welcome to the Doll's House,"" which turned the pain of being a geeky kid inside out into a horror show; but I don't think ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is that ambitious. It's basically follows the model of dozens of nerd wish fulfillment movies and TV shows, to the point of parody. It works because of its unique rhythm, odd characters, constant surprises, funny deadpan dialogue, inventive sight gags, and outrageous performances.  Napoleon is a nerd, but he's a stalwart nerd who basically doesn't want to change any more than is absolutely necessary.  He's stoically willing to pay the price, and he spends half his time dealing with people who are even stranger than himself--especially equally out-of-it brother and his smarmy uncle. Kip Dynamite, the older brother, looks like Wally Cox on the Atkins plan.  The uncle is Napoleon's true nemesis, a pathetically overconfident salesman of products that nobody wants.

The story pivots around two events:  Napoleon's realization that to win the girl he seems, ambivalently, to want, he needs ""skills""; and the arrival of Kip's girlfriend, a woman he met in an internet chat room. Shortly after her hilarious arrival, and her transformation of Kip into a mutant hip-hopper, she hands Napoleon a crucial gift.  The result is a huge comic payoff that, on reflection, makes no sense, but is such a bizarre and hilarious surprise, you buy it because it's too good to question.  The film makes Idaho seems like another planet, but that's because of the filmmaking ""skills"" on display.",1107043200,9,1650,5.107806691449814

Sure, he is the biggest dweeb this side of the Mississippi (for Easterners that's the other side.) Now, his brother nearly matches him pencil case for pencil case, but overall life is simple, and just a bit annoying for Napoleon.

This film is filled with at least a few of the traditional high school stereotypes, and overall it is just the same ""average Joe"" story. Yet, this film focuses for once more on the nerd, yet without banding them together like in ""Revenge of the Nerds."" Instead, this small band of diversity even incriminates within, for a brief moment.

I thought this film was ok, but the voice of the main character got on my nerves after the first ten minutes.  Plus, there's nothing really to the characters till the end, and by then it's all a simple wrap-up of the story. I would say the ending was too predictable, if it was not for the fact that there was no ""story"" of conflict until the end; everything else in Idaho up to that point was just average.

I am too a fan of independent style films, but like some reviewers have said it is hard to actually care for the characters.  If you feel like it then buy the film; however, I would just view it once and see if it touches your retro-twanged emotions.",1107043200,,1354,4.396

True, there isn't a hugely climactic arc to the film (the somewhat listless ending could be one of its main , small, flaws), but it isn't a static movie by any stretch of the imagination. It has the rhythm of ordinary life, rather than the high-octane career of a car chase. I challenge anyone to isolate a few months' period out of their lives, and try to find the ""point"" in it.  There may not be one obvious, but we can agree that plenty happened.

As other reivewers have mentioned, the movie is really one long chuckle, full of both subtle jokes and broad slapstick. I think it appeals to some people the way abstract art, jazz, free verse, and gamelan appeal to some and drive others to distraction. I've heard viewers from semi-high brow types to typical 10th graders rave about the film, suggesting it doesn't hit too many false notes if you aren't expecting it to be a heart-pounder.

Some reviewers claimed that there was no character development, and rather than just a matter of taste, I believe that is simply not an accurate assessment. From Napoleon to Pedro (that smile was like the sun rising) to Deb to Kip to Uncle Rico, all the main characters evolved and changed. There was far more emotional movement in this film than in my current least-favorite film, Mystic River, unless you consider being killed or killing an old friend character development.

Oh my God, Napoleon Dynamite was awful.  Let's list all the reasons it stank with bullet points, since that would be just as lazy as the film itself.

1. There's no plot.

2. There are no characters, only people with ""hilarious"" quirks.

3. The guy playing Napoleon is about ten years older than your average high school student.

4. Napoleon is a geek and a loser.

5. No really, I mean it.  If I saw him walking down the street, I'd beat him with my boot.  He's not a charming nerd.  He's a moron who walks around with his eyes barely open.  I wanted to run him over with my Accord.

6. Oh yeah, the acting was miserable.  But i can excuse that, since the script was apparently written on the back of a cocktail napkin.

7. Bringing up numchuks is not a joke.  Putting your main character in an ugly suit is not a joke.  You see, a joke actually has to have a thought behind it.  People who like this movie also think Donal Logue is hilarious on the I Love the 80's.

1560348,4,B00005JNBQ,"I have to admit that when I first saw the trailer for this film. I didn't know what to make of it. It looked like it was supposed to be a comedy, but the trailer, which was supposed to be a condensed and ""best of"" version of a movie (in this case the funniest moments of ""Napoleon Dynamite""), wasn't really that funny at all, at least not immediately and apparently. I was still intrigued, nonetheless. And finally curiosity got the better of me and I decided to give it a look at home, and I must say while I don't remember falling out of my seat from laughing at any point during the movie, it did bring a almost perpetual smile to my face with its sense of subtle and dry-witted humor. And it carried a feel good message throughout too.

The film brings the trials and tribulations of high school adolescence to a level of quirkiness that is unseen in any other films that I've seen in this genre. Most of the film's delightfully eccentric humor can be attributed to its colorful cast of weirdoes: The main character Napoleon Dynamite who's friendless and painfully un-self-conscious about his nerdiness; His brother Kip, who's a 32 year old live-at-home self-professed lady's man; A self delusional uncle Rico, who peddles herbal breast size enhancement to the local women, and dreams of traveling back in time to the glory year of 1982, when he was the football star of his high school; just to name a few. One would also be exposed to the life of rural Idaho, where the next house is always a mile away, and where Napoleon earns a 6-dollars a day salary with the chicken farmers. The movie is funny because none of the characters are aware of their flaws and awkwardness, but somehow in the end good things happen to those who happen to be doing nothing but just being their weird little selves.

While some may argue that there's no character development in this movie, I disagree. Napoleon for one clearly goes through a transformation during the film. He is a nerd and a conceited loser in the beginning, throwing around petty lies like claiming the girl in a promotional glamour shot is his girlfriend. But eventually he learns to be truthful to others, and most importantly to himself, by building meaningful friendships with those who can identify with him, and through unabashed self-expression.

The moral message of self-expression is central to this movie and very admirable.  But ultimately I liked this film due the superb and genuine performance of its cast. The portrayals of the characters are very dead-on and that's a big part in what makes this movie funny and watchable.",1106784000,2,2595,4.684210526315789

A nerd.  Who will risk his last scrap of dignity to defend his friend's honor?  A nerd.  And who, other than a nerd, can possibly have a life that, without forced plots and fancy filming, is interesting enough to sell?

Napoleon Dynamite makes us laugh because the producers very accurately capture an underappreciated subculture--the subculture that is at best disregarded and at worst supressed daily in American high schools.  Nerds.  They have an excessive fixation with all things medieval and fantastic.  They combine fashions from different decades in one mismatched ensemble.  They retain their passion for youthful entertainment.  I don't think we're laughing at Napoleon Dynamite in mockery, rather we laugh because we recognize in him someone we know who we're appreciating for the first time.

True there's not much plot in this movie.  But there are only so many plot lines in the world, and we've seen them all, so who cares?  The tone of the production is lighthearted, not cynical; it captures every aspect of nerdiness, without prompting us to scorn the characters.

1560549,4,B00005JNBQ,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It was along the lines of Rushmore, but with quite a bit less to the plot.  It was, however, VERY funny, very unique, and heartfelt.  The main characters are not to be pitied, but admired for their kindness, uniqueness, and good attitude (except when feeding a pet llama...) ;)

I don't know why some folks don't seem to like it, unless they can't get past the indie vibe oozing from the movie.  It's quirky, choppy, and it almost seems ""homemade"", but it's a wonderful movie and I would say almost ANY age could watch this movie safely.  There are very few ""adult-like"" themes and no swearing whatsoever.

Just a good buddy, feel good, hilarious movie.  I took away one star because the plot could have been punched up quite a bit.",1106611200,,762,4.551470588235294

I never found their treatment to be condescending or pitiful.  Uncomfortable sometimes, but not as uncomfortable as, say, a lot of Michael Moore moments.  These characters have good hearts, and the film promotes an appreciation for that above appearances and social graces.

Boring?  I couldn't take my eyes off it.  Sometimes because it was like a train wreck, sometimes because the teen plot moments caught me up.  With a 4 star average on over 500 reviews, it's worth a look.",1106611200,2,669,4.954954954954955

I kept expecting the main character to be a hero, instead he's just a loser.  I can appreciate a movie without a hero (i.e. Being John Malkovich) but can't they at least make the loser character someone who does something...anything...interesting?

Also, the other characters are really weak.  The best potential characters, the grandma for example, are barely ever on screen.

I  thought this movie would be like Rushmore, and I couldn't have been more wrong.

I will say one thing positive about it, though, there is a scene where Napolean goes to jump his bike on a ramp and instead just plows through it - a really funny gag, I have to admit...most of us have done something like that.

Couple of funny parts sprinkled in to a story that seemed to have been made up as they went along. To be honest with you I think I laughed at parts that weren't meant to be laughed at.

I hadn't heard a whole lot about it nor did I recognize anybody in it, but that's not surprising for an indie flick. I had heard somewhere that this movie, along with ""The Incredibles"" were the 2 best movies of the year. I had also read someone's review that likened it to a ""teenage Wes Anderson"" movie, to which I sure as heck hoped not, as I have tried twice to watch ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" only to abandon the effort both times. So, ready for anything, I sat down to watch it.

Well, I have to say I laughed pretty much throughout ""Napoleon Dynamite"". This movie is definitely not for everybody, but I didn't find it to be anything close to a Wes Anderson movie except for the dead-pan humor. I kept waiting to see what the main character Napoleon Dynamite, played superbly by Jon Heder, with his very odd delivery, would say next. Everything that came out of this ubernerd's mouth was pretty funny, actually. I even thought the supporting characters were pretty good. There's not a great deal of plot here, but in this movie, I don't think plot development was the main goal. If anything, it's a very well-done, if slightly bizzare, character study, and I was totally entertained the entire time.

I loved this movie, but I wouldn't be surprised if you ended up totally hating it either. It just depends on what particular vein your sense of humor is geared towards. A lot of people are not going to like this movie. And that's fine if you don't. Some people like egg nog, some can't stand it.

If you do not love this movie, then you will find it to be the worst film ever made.  The humor of this film is not for everyone, either you find it funny or you do not notice that a joke has been made at all.  If you begin watching this movie and are not laughing at all, I advice that you watch no further because the lame jokes you didn't laugh at are the only worthwhile points of this film.  There is no chance for character development or any deeper plot as the movie is set only in a single average day of a nerdy teenagers life.  However, the people who did laugh will notice Napoleon is a completely deadpan character lacking any emotion what so ever, this quality adds to the hilarity of the movie's jokes.  With a character like Napoleon, who needs a story?  All you need to watch this movie is a little bit of patience to wait for the next unintentional joke from Napoleon.  If you can manage through the slow moving pointless parts, the jokes are worthwhile.  If you find that the jokes are not worthwhile, it is pointless for you to watch.  Within five minutes you should know which way you will be leaning in you opinion of this film.  In truth, the first five minutes all but develop the plot to it's fullest and show you the form of humor that will be repeated the entire film.  The movie overall...is a hit or miss.  Even if you don't like the movie, you should at least watch the dance scene.  If you do not like the dance scene, you are totally beyond being helped.  You will never laugh again.

This movie isn't even a movie - I have to say that it was slightly worse than Red Zone Cuba but slightly better than Manos:  The Hands of Fate in terms of plot, jokes, and action.  (Both films are MST3k fodder; I am referring to the non-MST treated originals - obviously, the MST treatment turns these into comedy classics and invalidates this comparison.)

Basically, this movie is about as far from Three O'clock High (possibly the best down/out teen nerd comedy in this vein - i.e, dry as opposed to the superb Better Off Dead's more wacky approach) as one can get.

If you need a plot and deep, insightful commentary to guide you through a movie...uhhh go see another one. But if you liked Monty Python and the Holy Grail, then you might like this one. Napoleon Dynamite is one of the weirdest kids ever brought to life. He wears unicorn shirts and these boots that are...ski boots?? I have no idea.

The disc jockeys would reference some saying from the film like, Gosh!  I felt like I was missing out on a rip-roaring movie. The disc jockeys said it was destine to be a cult classic. So, I had to rent it.

I found out, Napoleon Dynamite (John Heder) is actually a person. Napoleon's appearance is right out of the 80's. I thought this movie was set in the early 1980's. But when Napoleon said Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) is stuck in 1982 the setting had to be present day. There are so many quotable phrases like gosh and freakin' idiot that they might become part of normal conversation.

Napoleon is a high school geek. He is no longer affected by any cut down remarks or being picked on by his schoolmates. He reciprocates with his own gestures and comments. Other characters include Napoleon's love interest Deb (Tina Majorino), his 32-year-old brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) and school friend Pedro. (Efren Ramirez) Are they all geeks or unique in their own way? But all of these characters are relatable to everyone now or from the past. That is why this movie is so interesting. It gets the viewer thinking! You might have to view the movie a couple of times to catch all of the comedic, quotable dialogue.

The movie takes place in the Director's (Jared Hess) old hometown of Preston, Idaho. The bonus features include the original short ""Peluca"" from which this movie came alive.",1106438400,2,1532,4.569343065693431

I'll be the first to admit that the Napoleon Dynamite quoting craze is getting a bit ridiculous, but why not, there are more classic quotes in this movie then one mind could possibly think of. I've read alot of the negative reviews for this movie and I totally understand most of them. ND is not for everyone. Especially if you need comedy shoved down your throat. It moves quite slow and has no real plot at all but taht is also what makes this movie great. Its like no other comedy that has ever come out.

The characters first of all is what makes this movie great. All i was thinking the first time i saw this movie was Where in the hell did they find the actors to play these characters? Every character is so funny in their own way it's hard to choose a favorite. My personal favorite is Lyle, the old Idaho farmer. The script of this movie and the way the lines are delivered from the actors is also esquisite. This movie are contains alot of physical comedy taht makes it great.  Deb runnign across the yard, Uncle rico making videos of himself, napoleon all sweaty drinking the energy drink, napoleon taking the VOTE FOR SUMMER button and chucking it down the hall, the principal bobbing his head during Summer's skit, the stupid look on coolguy Don's face the whole movie, ND flapping his hands during the Happy Hands Club presentation etc. the list goes on and on. I also love how the story all pulls together in the end with napoleon learning to dance then using his ""skills"" to help Pedro win the election and then Napoleon finally finding someone to play tetherball with him. And the dance scene i think will go down in history as an alltime classic scene. What alos made that scene enjoyable is if a nerd like ND would have danced like that at my  high school we would have given him the same standing ovation.

The music in the movie also pulls it together quite well. The cyndi lauper song at the school dance scene is awesome and so is the acoustic song after the ND dance scene. My favorite though is the song played at the end when ND and Deb are playing tetherball. Kip's song after the credits is awesome Too.

All in all Napoleon Dynamite really is a hero taht is hard not to fall in love with.

Every character in this movie is memorable in my mind, whether it be Napoleon with his taste for drawing fantasy figures or Uncle Rico with his apparent desire to go back to a simpler time (that time being the 80's).  Simply put, this movie is hilarious thoughout, a shear pleasure to watch.  The fact that it is free of any sort of obscenity or profanity is refreshing in a time when no good movie is capable of getting anything less than a PG-13 rating.

As someone who had the unfortunate experience of enduring 7th grade in Columbia Falls, Montana (pop. 4,000)...I feel this film right down to the fanny pack/moon boot ensemble, the perpetual corn dog cafeteria lunches, the evil 'big hair girls' (as I called them) and the nary foreigner kid who befriends the rest of the outsiders in school.

I admired those outsiders, not for their smarts or 'knowing what it's like', but for their simplicity of just being and not giving a hoot on being popular. To me, this film seems to embrace that notion, while spontaneously filling you up with right-on-target irony and sarcasm and hilarious small-town satire that, you'd might just have had to 'be there too once' to *really* know.

If you liked Welcome To The Dollhouse by Todd Solondz, you'll love this film just the same. The pure genius of these guys who pulled it all together- newcomer writer/director Jared Hess, and first-time actors Jon Heder and Aaron Ruell (who happens to be an amazing, hip photographer in real life)- is not only extraordinary, but inspiring for soon-to-be indie filmmakers as well.

This movie, though it has little rising action, was captivating through it's unorthodox approach to story format. The comedic sense of the writers for this movie is very avant-garde.

1560829,4,B00005JNBQ,"Jared Hess' Napoleon Dynamite is, without question, the sleeper comedy of the year.  Influenced by Wes Anderson's ""Rushmore"" and Paul Feig's ""Freaks and Geeks"", Napoleon Dynamite is a study in isolation that clearly distances itself from the two.  Napoleon, played by newcomer Jon Herder, is a quirky geek from rural Idaho who, like many before him within the genre, has problems relating to others.  His obvious disregard for the way in which others view him, including the audience, isolates him further.  The fact is that Napoleon Dynamite is a character study that never actually studies a character.

It nestles itself within the genre of alienated teen comedy by taking 85 minutes to deliver and repeat a one liner.  Situations present themselves whereby Napoleon is put on the spot.  His obvious disregard for how others receive his words deliver the joke, as there are no consequences for his action.  Things here stay stagnant, a journey that takes us nowhere except to the realization that we are laughing out loud, situation after situation.

What distinguishes this film from others within the genre is that there is no revenge from this nerd; there isn't even any change in his disposition.  Rather, Jared Hess takes us through a week in the life of a geek leading up to the prom.  The anxiety pertaining to this, as seen in so many other films, is totally underdeveloped, which works.

To suggest that Napoleon is comfortable with the way he handles himself is an understatement, but i guess that is fitting since this film is a total understatement.  Despite being the center of attention, he does not allow a possible error in judgment to affect him. The audience laughs at him the same way his onscreen peers laugh at him. Napoleon remains unshaken, it truly doesn't stir him.

Napoleon Dynamite is a comedy that is quirky enough to keep you entertained from start to finish, even though you end up in exactly the same place.",1106092800,2,1942,4.8810975609756095

I know three people who watched it the first time and said...uhhh how can you find it funny. But then I convinced them to watch it again and we are still laughing. This is probably why critics knocked the movie...they didn't have a good enough sense of humor to enjoy it the first time.

This film is hysterical, bizarre, and hits you from many different angles.  Everyone has known nerds like Napoleon - they are timeless although the fads and cliques of highs schools forever change.  So everyone can relate to it.  But liking the movie is a different matter. ND's character as an ""anti-hero as hero"" works (as does his ""stuck in the past"" Uncle), but somehow Pedro and Kip almost push the movie in another direction, which to me is the film's only ""flaw"".  Pedro just ""doesn't work"" and Kip's nerdiness (unlike ND's, which is brilliant) is too stereo-typical, reminiscent of some early Saturday Night Live skit.

The real key to enjoyment of this movie is not to take it seriously.  I even laughed at many of the 5-star reviews, some of these critics read far more into this film than I would ever dare.  Same with the ND ""haters"" - they either have no sense of humor at all or see it as ""cruel"".

I saw the movie 4 times in the theater (twice for the new wedding ending) and 3 times on DVD. I think the first time I saw it I was with friends who thought it would be a cross between ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and ""Sixteen Candles."" It's not.

It takes place in the director/co-writer's (Jared Hess) hometown of Preston, Idaho -- a town where time forgot. Sure there's the Internet for Kip to chat online with babes. But everyone dresses like Sears hasn't gotten any new clothes since 1987. The characters are something out of a David Lynch movie, without the horror. If Jerri Blank from ""Stangers With Candy"" had a fmaily just like her, this would be it. Nerdy just doesn't do it justice. What makes this film endearing and addictive probably has something to do with the fact that all the weird little moments in the film are based on things that really did happen to the director growing up in rural Idaho.

So here's my list of interesting trivia and reasons why you should get this flick, now!

* Best opening credits ever using condiments and school supplies to spell out cast and crew names!

* The actor who plays the lead of Napoleon Dynamite -- Jon Heder -- actually drew all those bizarre sketches of unicorns farting, ligers and the portrait of the girl he asked to prom.

* Big Jakes -- best strawberry shakes you'll ever down -- in Preston.

* All Uncle Rico consumes during the film is steak and milk. The actor who plays him -- Jon Gries -- is a vegetarian who hated milk.

* Check out the tacky retro decor in the Dynamite home -- lots of odd wallpaper, dual portaits, and a bobcat hide on the wall.

* Longest telephone cord EVER!

* Ebay-bought time machine or torture device?

* A closer look at what it takes to earn a ribbon from the FFA!

* Napoleon's t-shirt collection is IMPRESSIVE! And let us not forget the moonboots!

* Rex Kwon Do!

* Happy Hands Club!

* Music in the film includes White Stripes, old-school Cyndi Lauper, Money Mark and tons of odd Woolsworth type tunes.

* Teatherball!

* Tina the llama (the director's mom's llama).

* D-Qwon's Dance Moves are really moves improved by actor Jon Heder. Check out those spirit fingers!

* Vote for Pedro A-Team montage!

* Kip's love song: ""Yes, I love technology/But not as much as you, you see.""

The only bitter feelings this movie has provoked is the fact that my sister Cait did not buy me the DVD for Christmas! The same girl I raised, pretty much single handed! I sang Don McClain (sp) songs to her while I changed her fouled diapers,put warm water on her meat gravey flavored chow(softens the nuggets) and routinely fished her out of the mud hole we rode our dirt bikes through, heck I'm the one who put the carp in there so she would have someone to play with.  If you did continue to read when I suggested you stop understand this is all based on fact.

1561028,5,B00005JNBQ,"The wonderful thing about ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is the humanity of the characters.  Perhaps those who did not find this movie funny were either (a) like Summer Wheatley, so wrapped up in themselves that they never took any effort to really know the people around them, or (b)have yet to learn to laugh at themselves and their own shortcomings.  The characters are well-developed and deeper than they first appear, and the actors have perfected their characters' personas. The situations are what makes this film so funny, and when you stop to think about the things that you thought were so important to you in High School, it makes this film even funnier.

This movie is bursting with heart, and carries two important messages that could be heard loud and clear above the laughter: (1) IT TAKES TREMENDOUS PERSONAL FORTITUDE TO RISK LOOKING LIKE A FOOL TO HELP A FRIEND, and (2) REGARDLESS OF HOW GEEKY, HAPLESS OR DIFFERENT YOU ARE, THERE IS SOMEONE IN THIS WORLD WHO WILL LOVE YOU.  When it comes down to it, those are the core teachings of Christ: ""There is no greater love than to lay down your life for a friend"", and ""Love your neighbor as yourself"". For anyone who has ever suffered humiliation at the hands of those who did not have the courage to be themselves, or to take any stand whatsoever, this movie rings true.

Moreover, like ""The Breakfast Club"" and other teen movies that came after, ""Napolean Dynamite"" gives us a glimpse of adolescence through the actions and reactions of characters who have no idea that they are living some of the best times of their lives.  As sad and frustrating as Napoleon's existence seems to be, there are two characters in the film who affirm that the future will be more and less than he imagines. Older brother Kip finds true love in his chat-room soulmate (""LaFawnduh is the best thing that ever happened to me... Napoleon, I'm sure you will find your soulmate one day"").  Uncle Rico so longs for his lost youth and a second chance that he resorts to a ""time machine"" that he buys on-line (""If coach had just put me in for the fourth quarter, we would have won state. I just know it!""). In each case, the elder characters' lives serve as confirmation and caution for the future.

One last thumbs-up for this film:  It proves that a film can be entertaining, funny and meaningful without coarse language, gratuitous sex or violence, or a $20 million budget.

Well done Mr. and Mrs. Hess!  We anxiously await your next project.

These two things, to me, indicate two possibilities; a) They are either young and have no scope of cinematics to be making ANY judgement on ANY film. b) Just plain cannot relate to something due to (a).

If you cannot relate to this movies' quirks, which have so many parallels to reality, then you just simply won't understand the humor. For the people who been immersed in the clique-laden world of high school elitism, this movie will draw laughs from familiar situations with stereotyped characters. The fact that every character fits so neatly into their preconceived societal niches' makes this film hilariously nearsighted. The shallowness and superficial world of a high schooler is captured perfectly through the eyes of Napolean. Overall, this movie accomplishes what it was meant to do; show you a familiar setting through unfamiliar eyes, giving Napoleans' self absorbed, and warped perception of it many comic translations.

Finally, I rented Napoleon Dynamite and sat down and saw a pretty nice little story about some simple lives in a place I'll never get to go. When I got back to my friends, I told them it was a cool little movie and that i really enjoyed it, but they had forgotten to tell me it is about autism and functioning with that disorder.

Now I am locked in disagreement with my friends. They say Napoleon and Pedro are not playing autistic teens but are just dumb nerds. I say Napoleon, Pedro, and possibly others, are very autistic and the signs are right there in the audio and video.

Napoleon is not really ""connected"" to people or the normal flow of life. He tries to communicate but cannot connect anything more complicated than a question and an answer. Napoleon has a fascination with rythmic movement (dance) and spinning rotations (tetherball) - that's autism. Napoleon sometimes experiences rushes of emotion that he has no idea how to process and it freezes his brain - key the scene when he first sees the suit of clothes in the thrift store. Pedro is similarly also in his own world. It's very obvious.

1561135,4,B00005JNBQ,"There are two rival trends today in Mormon comedy. The first, and more unsuccessful, IMHO, embraces the ""Singles Ward"" family of films. There are a mixture of the solid Hale Family of thespians, with a mixture of the Brigham Young University's ""Divine Comedy"" and ""Garrens"" troupes.  They have the more slapstick, and even  Church Talent Night feel to them. In essence, they are the Jay Leno's of Mormondom.

The other trend are the independent humorists, such as [...] and this film Napoleon Dynamite.  They are outside the normal institution and organs of Mormon humor, and therefore had to struggle to make their comedy work.  They are the David Lettermens of the Mormondom.  Which is why they are actually funnier.

What can I say about this film?  When you present an anti-hero as hero, your competition is primarily the ""Revenge of the Nerds"" franchise.  To his credit, Hess is able to have the same vibe, transplant it to southern Idaho, and throw in some Theater of the Absurd to boot.

That is what you are getting, and that is why the film works with so many people.  If, as Carl Matheson assets, ""The Simpsons"" humor is ""hyper-irony,"" then this film's humor is ""hyper-quirkiness.""  It melds Seinfeld ""A show about nothing,"" with Babbitt's mediocrity.  The dialogue is two steps above drivel, but that is the charm of the movie.  You get a series of ""A Slice Of Life"" themes that are like the prop GNDN tubes on Star Trek: ""Goes Nowhere, Does Nothing.""

Sometimes I got he feeling that I was watching a so-called ""reality show,"" where a person makes no real intellectual or moral development in the process of the film.  Maybe ND is just a good natured Forrest Gump shipwrecked in Idaho.

I think the key to the movie is ND's conceptual reference point. He reminds me of Calvin from the funnies-some panels Hobbes is a stuffed tiger, but in the more interesting panels Hobbs is as alive as Calvin's parents.  C. S. Lewis mentions that he had this same problem growing up: he had the external realm of studies and family, but he has the vibrant inner world of Wagner and Boxon, which at times, was more real than the so-called real world (Surprised By Joy, Chapter 8).

ND has the same problem. He speaks of the liger, with it's magical properties, has the retro-80's ""Pegasus Crossing"" sign on his door, and the poster to the classic film ""Dragonslayer.""  He is obsessed with nun-chucks and judo skills, but doesn't quite understand why he should wear the kung-fu pants.  He buys the suit at the Deseret Industries thrift store, but doesn't see that it looks weird, even with his retro 70's looks in the retro 80's town.  For ND, his clothes have become so old, they are back in style again.

So there you have him: the fluctuating reference point-he has not quite left the magical stage that most of us leave in out early teens (See ""The Road Less Traveled, p. 86-87).  This magical point of view is his charm is. He is a man-child like Brian Wilson or Wildman Fischer.  If Napoleon grows up, he will either be a total failure, or a monumental success.  With the white horse, things for Napoleon is looking up.

NOTE:  for the love of mud, DO NOT DO A SEQUAL!  This film has to end as abruptly as it began.  ND has to stay a retro 70's teenager in a retro 80's town lost somewhere in the retro 00's.

Ebert hated it. He claims it to be depressing. In a way, he's right. If one were to view this movie as a drama of a urban small town still stuck in '82, well, we got one of those Sundance indie flick right now.

This movie transcends beyond the conventions of any cliches you find in modern cinema. The characters, close ups or medium, are simply placed right smack in the middle. There is a sense of symmetry going on here. Relationships between characters are kept within a minimal physical contact. The dialouge is absolutely inane, insipid and mundane. But let's face it, in a sleepy town like this, what sort of small talk would you expect?

Napoleon Dynamite represents the epitome of an ultimate high school geek still stuck in fourth grade. Still obsessed with doodling pictures of mythical beasts (not very well drawn IMHO), feeling all icky about going out with girls, standing by like minded friends through thick and thin.

Eventually, what won me over and had me re-evaluating this movie again was this single line near the end of the movie, before the ""grandslam finale"" on stage, whereby Pedro was about to lose all hope of winning the School President election. Napoleon asked him to go for it, ""Just follow your heart, that's what I do."" Such simple lines, but yet it validates all of Napoleon's actions throughout the movie.

As an independant film maker, I walk into any such film with an open mind, and wish them the best of luck. This time, it was all I could do to contain myself. Now everyone I know has heard about Napoleon Dynamite.

There are many incredible things about the picture. First, its a simple story without any extravagances. No melodramatic overtones, nor the cardboard cut-out characteristics, just a laid back comedy. Can I get a ""Sweet?"" Plus the intention non-use of bad language. It's possible after all...

When I had the opportunity to meet Roger Ebert, I wish I had seen this film and known his viewpoint of it. There would have been some serious questions. I have read through many critics likes and dislikes. (Cause apparently this is an ""everone loves it or hates it"" kind of movie.) Mainly those that dislike it want ""form."" Dynamite needs no form. You jump into his mixed-up life for a couple of days, then jump back out again.

I guarantee those that love silly humor will be quoting lines for weeks. If lines like: ""Ow, I think your bruising my neck meat!"", puts a pedro-sized grin on your face, then you will be rolling.

1561238,4,B00005JNBQ,"This movie is a refreshing alternative to the standard format of over the top gross-out humor and language that has become standard in teen/20 something comedies.

While movies like American Pie have their good points, the same old jokes and derivitive plots are getting tired.  In contrast, Napoleon Dynamite's sureal deadpan feels like a breath of fresh air.

Although devoid of gross-out humor, everything about this movie was designed deliberately to make the viewer cringe.  Every character is their own brand of loser...not one is without glaring outward faults.  Every character is immersed in their own brand of misery, ridiculousness, and/or sense of dilusion.

Right smack in the middle of this hellish reality you have Napoleon, who at first glance seems the biggest loser of the lot.  However, by the end of the movie it becomes clear that it's not the case.

Rather than attempt to fit into what is at best a painful reality, Napoleon simply chooses to reject most of it and substitute his own.  In doing so, he creates an island within himself and a means to filter the world around him.  His blank expression reflects this well.

In contrast to the apathy that he shows towards most of the world, Napoleon proves himself a good friend to to those he cares about, and capable of hate towards those whose adverse actions penetrate his ability to ignore them, or harm the ones he cares about.

In the final scene, his impromtu ""skit"" in front of the school illuminates his character clearly.  Rather than see his friend let down, he intervenes without thought to himself.

In a film with a diverse cast of losers, the ones that ultimately end up with a measure of happiness and redemption have two things in common:

1) They recognise the core quality in the people they care about regardless of how others might percieve them.

2) The are able to live in a bubble of their own reality and shut out the rest.

While a humor of film like this might be missed by some of its audience, it leaves the rest laughing out loud.",1105660800,3,2032,4.711048158640226

1561241,5,B00005JNBQ,"This movie is one of my favorites of 2004 and all-time, despite my having low expectations before watching it.

 Even a levelheaded viewer who didn't enjoy this film would have trouble claiming that it was ""flawed."" The execution is pretty much perfect -- there are no throwaway lines, all of the loose ends in the plot tie back to each other, and every character has a genuinely satisfying arc. Despite the surreal nature of these characters and the world they live in, I really did care about their fate and was touched by the ways in which their lives unfolded. In any movie, let alone a comedy of this nature, that is a tremendous accomplishment.

 The problem is, though, that some people simply will not want to watch these characters for two hours. They are very strange and awkward, and while I myself found all of them except for villain Uncle Rico to be likable, it's understandable that some folks might be left scratching their heads and wondering what the fuss is about.

 With that disclaimer, I will move on to the movie's rating. This is one of very few PG movies I have ever seen that is worth watching. Usually, if you see ""PG"" on a box, you can expect braindead kiddie films that will harm young viewers more than any nudity or violence ever could. This, though, was immensely creative, intelligent, and funny. If you're a parent concerned about content, but also want your child to develop a respectable sense of humor, this should be the first disc you drop into your DVD player for the little ones.

 One last note for those who liked the movie but might be on the fence about buying it: the actual DVD is a great purchase loaded with extras. With commentary, the original short film that the feature is based on, deleted scenes, and both widescreen and full screen versions, you are getting your money's worth.",1105660800,3,1833,4.618461538461538
1561242,5,B00005JNBQ,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I put this DVD in the player. In the first 15 minutes I was expecting the typical comedy to script itself out. After about 20 minutes I realized that I was watching a movie about nothing, and that it was all about the characters, and the story was only about the way things happened in this place at this time. There was no plot, no story, no revelations...it was just about the people. And the people were people that I knew. People that everybody knows and people that everybody is. We knew these people and the recollection either makes us happy or makes us cringe because we remember how we reacted to them...Gosh.
While the script probably shouldn't be given Oscar consideration, it is too bad that the actors won't be. There should be nominations here for lead actor and at least 2 supporting, but that ain't gonna happen. It's really sad. Because ""Napoleon Dynamite"" wasn't a mainstream movie, the performances here will be ignored for others of lesser merit.",1105660800,2,1000,4.655367231638418

I smirked in ONE part of this movie and it had nothing 2 do with Napolean.  The Uncle Chico...Rico...Pico...whatever his name was, was somewhat funny.  So after getting through watching MTV make what in their mind was the worst possible nerd ever.  But you can tell it was done by the original MTV Generation cuz this Napolean was based on nerds in the 80's.  And that is when this movie takes place.  Why in the 80's?Acting was bad, almost every person in this movie had a self pity all over the place.  Almost everyone was the same character.  Tater Tots in jeans?  I tried several times to like this movie and it has all been the same IT SUCKS!!  Yeah maybe if you are an MTV junkie either in the past or now, and laugh at the same drone duplicated in 10 characters, no jokes, no real plot but u like laughing at characters that are made up in Hollywood???

So rushed out and got the DVD, only to find out that this movie is just as stupid as the local paper made it out to be.

And, I would caution anyone that is dry humored to stay away from this one. You can not really appreciate it unless you or someone you know could relate to it. It is off the wall funny. Each scene gives you a taste for what to expect next. But, I think the opening line, of the movie, says it all! This is not the first time I've seen this and it probably won't be the last.

From the start this movie exudes the kind of quirky and off-beat humor that makes you despise and fall in love with the characters at the same time. Their simple misadventures, in a way, make you appreciate your own life. When I first saw this movie on DVD, I turned it off after 45 minutes because it just seemed so stupid and lame. Then I realized though what this movie had to offer and I was able to find the humor in some of the parts of the movie and then I turned it back on and continued watching. This movie has a lot of ""1-liners"", which you will find yourself and others who have seen this movie repeating for weeks.

1561358,5,B00005JNBQ,"Hollywood nerd movies tend toward a formula: High-IQ nerds suffer humiliation, approach despair, then organize to exact revenge on their jock-prep-cheerleader tormentors. If it worked for Revenge of the Nerds, why mess with success?

Napoleon Dynamite offers an intriguing diversion from that formula. By abandoning convention (and plot), the filmmakers take you on an ultimately richer excursion into the world of ordinary nerds, a place where people dress just as badly, but prefer tetherball to programming. The filmmakers ratchet up the tragicomic tension, unfolding scene after scene of deadpan absurdity. It delivers the goods for your underdog-cheering habit, but gets there in quirky and unpredictable ways.

Napoleon, Pedro, Kip, and the other characters aren't self-aware MENSA nerds from central casting. Rather, they are sad and sometimes abidingly strange, interacting awkwardly with one another while enduring headlocks, devastating put-downs, and sundry indignities.

Through their humiliations, they exude the unsettlingly calm certainty that this is the Way of Things and always will be. You can see it best in their thousand-yard stares. Any actors could play this strictly for laughs, but here they almost suggest a state of -- go figure -- enlightenment through cluelessness.

This is one of those rare movies that is enjoyable on a second or third viewing because you keep finding new details and angles. Recommended very highly.",1105488000,10,1450,5.577272727272727

The next day I watched it again, and found myself chuckling, while rewinding parts to watch them over again.  After the third time viewing the film, I was convinced.

I was about doubled over during the ""glamour shots"" by Deb. And the climax, the ""skit"" at the elections is classic. It's just one of our favorites.

This movie looked like it would be the classic geek movie (etc. Revenge of the Nerds) but it turned out to be a whole new kind of comedy.  This is Dumb and Dumber, but stupider and funnier!!  I can't understand why anyone could say this movie is trash, unless you have no sense of humor.  Just listening to anything Napoleon says is funny...his pickup line is ""Are you drinking 1% because you think you're fat, because you're not...you could be drinking whole milk if you wanted.  By the way, you should come get your stuff out of my locker, I can't fit my nunchucks in there anymore.""  That's not even the funniest scene. When Kip runs over the tupperware and just drives off, I coudn't stop laughing.  The music went along perfectly and some of the songs are actually good.  I had to buy the soundtrack too...42 tracks (including a lot of dialogue) for 13 dollars was a steal for Napoleon Dynamite fans.  This is my favorite DVD out of my collection, and I have some great movies..I'll end my favorite quote- ""(Napoleon)I made like an infinity of those at scout camp last year"" ""(Deb)I'm trying to raise money to go to college.""

Napoleon Dynamite, however, seems to have traded in its precursor's chuckle and spark for little more than ironic elbowing and guffaws. This feature length version felt so heavily forced and the gags n setups so mean-spirited, I think my one true-felt moment of ironic laughter was seeing the MTV Films logo float by. (Wha??? MTV would bankroll something as aesthetically, culturally, morally, bankrupt as this film? Gasp!) No, audience sympathy isn't asked for till far into the picture, but Anti-hero comedy this aint. The film is marketed as and initially presents itself as a ""Hooray for the Underdog"" or ""High-5 for Geek Culture"" flick, but within the first 10 minutes, this pretense is shed and all we're left with is a chance to point and chuckle, and many chances to hope that, in our youth, at our worst, we were still so much cooler that that guy.

After viewing this strange flick in more or less bewilderment, I thought about it.  I have come to believe that the strangeness of the flick is less the focus on some nerds than its treatment of them.  The movie doesn't make them the object of ridicule or irony.  And that is what is strange.  Whenever you see characters like these on the screen they are the butt of jokes, made ridiculous, or destroyed.

Look, Napoleon and his family and friends are some of the weirdest people you will ever see on screen and maybe in real life as well.  You will find yourself mystified by their approach to their problems.  They seem to either not understand the way out of their situation or they lack the energy to get out.  Maybe it is both.  What you will love them for is that they do not knuckle under or accept the badge of loser that the ""cool"" kids want to impose on them.  My favorite scene involves Napoleon asking one of the bullies for one of Summer's campaign buttons and then heaving it down the hall.  Glory!

Pedro is another great character.  Strange and great.  I mean, how could the desire to run for class president and the need to cut off one's hair because it is making you too hot reside in the same individual?

The ending of the movie has more poetry in it than you might catch on first viewing.  Remember Pedro's campaign promise and then look closely at everything that happens as the movie ties things up.

I recommend seeing this movie.  Just don't expect seeing anything like you have ever seen on screen before.  And if you find yourself rejecting the images at first, I encourage you to stick with it.  I think you will get it by the end.  Younger folks seem to get it easily.  A baby boomer like me has to work at it a bit, but I think it is worth it.",1105401600,8,1941,4.35754189944134

I can't believe some people actually think this is actually a good movie.

I was skeptical about the whole plot and humor it was talking about. The first time I watched it, I only saw about one half of it, the second time I only saw about one half of it again, but the third time I watched it all the way through. The part where he dances in front of the whole auditorium is priceless. My friends and I laugh hysterically everytime. Everyday, we recite lines from it on a regular basis. I even suggested the theme of our winter semi-formal to be Napoleon Dynamite, but nobody took me seriously, so now we're having one of our spirit days be ND and 80's Day. Anyways, the movie had a lot of funny parts in it and NOT just the part where they're riding on a bike and when the kid slams him into a locker. If you watch the deleted scenes, the kickball scene is the BEST. It's so hilarious, you won't be able to NOT laugh. It has a plot, even if it is very faint, and the music is funny in its own way.

But beyond that, if you like stories with a plot, you'll hate this movie.  If you like stories with a resolution, you'll hate this movie.  If you like movies where the characters have good distinct personalities, you probably won't like this movie.  If you dislike barely defined mellodrama, you probably won't like this movie.

1561813,4,B00005JNBQ,"This film lacks a point, fails to make any statements and has no desire to make the world a better place.  The plot is non-existent, the characters are cartoonish clichs and the production looks like it was thrown together during a weekend.  But with that said, I must say I enjoyed ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and have found myself laughing with friends over some of the more memorable scenes for the last several days.  The film is like that annoying hangnail that won't go away.  You can't stop playing with it, even though it bleeds when you tug at it.

Napoleon Dynamite's title character exists in all high schools across the country.  He lives in his own world of mythological drawings and ninja gear.  His reality grows from a healthy imagination and a way of coping with the daily attacks from the ""cool kids"" and his inescapable existence on the outside of social circles.  The portrayal of a social outcast is so genuine, it at times becomes uncomfortable to watch, as viewers will see how easily a character like Napoleon could end up becoming a Columbine-like killer.

A bold choice by writer/director Jared Hess is to refrain from making Napoleon into a hero.  Most often compared to characters in ""Revenge of the Nerds"", Napoleon isn't given a triumphant conclusion where the school realizes he was cool all along.  The film lacks sentimentality in this respect and appears to be the product of individuals who have experienced alienation first hand.

The emphasis placed on a realistic portrayal of a ""loser"" also helps build most of the humor in the film.  Napoleon is so consistently bizarre and socially inept that viewers can't help laughing at him (even though we all want him to succeed).  From the first moment when Napoleon opens his ""Trapper Keeper"" and performs an experiment on an action figure, audiences will find him as irresistible as that hangnail that just won't go away.",1105142400,7,1896,4.8478260869565215
1561903,1,B00005JNBQ,"Raves Peter Travers of Rolling Stone.  As if I needed another reason to think he was a complete schmuck.  I hated Napoleon Dynamite, but that's not saying you will, it's just my two cents.  It's one of those films where you have to like the main character or else you're screwed, coz you have to spend the duration of the film with him.  Some people feel this way about Woody Allen, some Jerry Lewis, to me it's Napoleon Dynamite.  Now I'm all in favor of films that show the underdog/outcast getting his/her shot at glory, and I also like to think I have a pretty broad sense of humor.  This movie only seems to have one joke that they stretch out for 84 minutes-Look at the dorky guy looking dorky, saying and doing dorky things.  Dorky can be funny, but Napoleon is downright unpleasant, unlikable and unfunny.  Plus he has a dorky brother, dorky uncle and dorky semi-girlfriend, so we get to push the whole dorky joke even further.  There are alot of hypocrites who really like the Napoleon character and think he's cool, yet if this same guy went to your high school as opposed to being a movie character, you'd hate him.  Napoleon's friend, Pedro is from the Cheech and Chong school of funny.  If you like Mexican characters that speak as though they're stoned, drunk or just dumb, you'll find Pedro funny.  I just think he's a stereotype myself.  He's a live action version of Speedy Gonzales' drunk cousin, Slowpoke Rodriguez.  I barely smiled at this film, let alone laughed.  Considering MTV productions had a hand in this ""independant"" feature, you can kinda guess what kind of humor we're talking about.  And seeing the MTV name attached to this film makes me worry about the future of independant films.  It has one or two chuckles(not surprisingly the laughs came from every character but Napoleon), and Napoleon's dance at the end was pretty well done, but it just didn't do it for me.  Already I've noticed the extremely annoying epidemic of people freely quoting from this film.  There's nothing worse than people quoting unfunny lines from an unfunny movie, then cracking up at their own joke.  You'll notice this happens with people who quote Monty Python and The Holy Grail(complete with rotten English accent), only difference being that Monty Python manage to be funny.  More than likely I'll be brushed off as one who ""just didn't get it"", but that's cool coz I'm sure I can think of many films you won't ""get"" either.

But Napoleon, his brother kip, and uncle Rico have to be the best drawn dorks I have every seen.  There is no secret ""cool"" person waiting to be let out.  They are just wonderful, lovable, dorks.  Plot?

I'd heard about it when it was making the rounds on the festival circuit last year and wondered what it was like.  Since it was successful in festivals, I wondered if it was going to be a dry, insufferable ""comedy"" like THE ROYAL TENNENBAUMS, perhaps the most overrated, pretentious film I've ever seen.

But NAPOLEON is funny.  The characters are so off-the-wall that the story looks like pure chaos for the first half.  But there is a story and it's fun to watch it all come together.  (Be sure to stick around for the wedding sequence following the end credits).

But this wasn't another movie like that.  ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a quirky movie about a nerd who is a jerk yet has a soft spot.  The humor is really random, which brings up memories from movies like ""Airplane"" and ""Monty Python and the search for the holy grail"".  Napoleon's Uncle Rico is probably one of my favorite characters for he brings an extra sense of quirkiness and fun to the movie.  When Pedro runs for president you pull for him and you decide you want to hate Summer, and I died laughing when Napoleon did that dance for Pedro's campaign.

Sorry Louis but it's true, you were (and I'm assuming, still are) the biggest dork out there, GOSH! From the clothes, hairstyle, Moon Boots, and general demeanor, the portrayal of Heder as the 'Dork Extraordinaire' is exemplary. The lack of social interaction skills, and subsequent affiliation with other dorks is clearly right on target. I watched this film over and over again (got it for Xmas!), truly hilarious once you get over the lack of plot. The dance sequence is incredible!

I rented this movie at home and watched it with my old and haggard and saddle-bag-thighed ex-wife, who was also poor in her dealings with money.  She laughed, but AT Napoleon, in a kind of dumb-founded way that was always wondering what he was going to do next.  I laughed too, but because I've always rooted for the misfit, for the underdog, for the loner.  For the secret, naive-moron that we all are deep-down.  Whether it was drawing expertly-shaded pictures of the beautiful Trisha or giving a report on the exploits of our ""underwater ally"" (Nessie), I felt like I endured a million hours of junior high and high school with him sitting in the back of the class.

I'm a professional firefighter, and I brought the DVD into work the next day.  Before we watched it, I was concerned that it would have too much ""dork appeal"" for a bunch of alpha-male men-of action.  But it soon dawned on me, as the room exploded in laughter again and again, that Napoleon was not so much a dork as he was a little boy who never really grew up.  And almost every man can remember what it was like to be 8 years old.

The smarmy ""Summer Wheatley"" and her unctuous boyfriend looked like real people I went to school with.  That guy could've been a blonde version of Sherwin Adams from my class of 1993.  It was not difficult to want to see them fall from grace, especially at the hands of the dynamic and well-coiffed Pedro.

The dance scene climax gave me chills to watch, because it reminds us that even the awkward, even the graceless, even the silly or stupid or ugly can do something well.  Can do something to admire, even to the point of being envious of it.

This is a sweet, funny, unconventional film made by unorthodox people who poured their brains and heart into it.  You will laugh your head off at this movie, or it will miss you completely.  Like ""Bottle Rocket"", you cannot explain what is funny about it.  Kudos to Jack White for allowing them the use of the White Stripes song ""I think we're going to be friends"".

The same goes for this movie.

Supposedly this film is set in present day, but the backdrop is right out of the early '80s. Napoleon's brother uses a computer which looks like an original Apple, yet he is chatting with babes on the Internet. That scene and many others like it are par for the course here.

Yeah, I realize this film is absurb and I realize it asks you to suspend reality. Yet, it tries so hard to be a genuine reflection of high school life.

What a complete disappointment. Other than the opening credits sequence, this movie has not a one redeeming quality. I hate to paint broad brushstrokes and subject people to simple labels, but I simply can't help myself here. This move is liked only by people who take delight in being different and counter-cultural JUST BECAUSE. The reason why I can say this is that I used to be like that.

But then I grew up. Just because it's ""not Hollywood,"" does not make a movie de facto good. This movie is a textbook example of that principle. The diaglogue is inane, the characters are underdeveloped, and every joke--every joke--falls flatter than a Euclidean plane. When you have to try this hard to be clever, you aren't.

What these people don't ""get"" is that this movie is actually a joke being played on them.  I am a big fan of subtle, sarcastic humor, and this movie contains none of that.  This was the most boring, worthless movie i have ever seen in my life.  Do not listen to the other reviews as they were probably written by a bunch of 13 year old idiots.  I saw a review where someone actually compared this movie to Seinfeld, because its ""about nothing.""  The difference is that while Seinfeld was in fact about nothing, there still were things going on, and there were plenty of jokes.  In this movie, there is absolutely nothing happening, and none of the dialogue is even remotely funny.  At times I felt like I was having a staring contest with people in the movie, because they weren't even moving or talking.  Just sitting there.  If that's your idea of ""subtle,"" then what you need to understand is that when something is subtle, there is an underlying idea or joke.  Things aren't just automatically funny because nothing is happening.  I also enjoy how this movie is already being called a ""cult classic"" even though it just came out a few months ago.  Maybe its because anyone that likes this movie only likes it so they can say tell all their friends that they are very cultured, have great taste in movies, and are in love with a subtle, dry ""cult classic"" because thats what MTV told them this movie was.

The movie isn't really about anything, but the characters are what make the movie funny.

Napoleon - he's got red frizzy hair, his lips don't touch, wears Unicorn tshirts and wierd moon looking boots (No, they aren't Uggs)

Kip - his 30 year old something brother (I think) that lives with Napoleon & their Grandmother.  He is the total white guy down to the knee socks with deck shoes.  He's addicted to chat rooms and finds the love of his life there.

The Uncle - an 80's has been football player who just wants to go back in time to become a famous athlete.

Summer - Hillary Duff's sister - was suppossed to be the ""Popular girl"" in school, but wasn't impressed with her performance.

Pedro - answer's in ""Yes's"" and ""No's"" most of the time and manages a smile at the end.

It's so bad i don't even know what to say.  There are literally about 2 funny parts in the entire movie, and they are barely funny enough to elicit a chuckle.  The movie is sooo slow.  There were probably 7 or 9 scenes in the movie where at the end of them, i just wanted to scream out ""WHAT THE #@$*%@ WAS THAT?!?!""  One example would be a scene that is about a minute or two long that consists of napoleon sitting in a truck waiting for his uncle.  He looks at his watch.  Then they show the truck for about 10 seconds.  Then they show napoleon's goofy face.  Then they show the inside of the truck for a while.  Then he looks at his watch again.  This goes on, in complete silence, for way too long, and there are so many pointless ""filler"" scenes in this movie that i started to think the entire movie was pointless filler.

Napoleon is an awkward nerdy kid that has the typical ""duh, of course i knew that, you idiot"" adolescent attitude.  The entire movie consists of him making comments with as much or less substance than the one i just created to describe him, and these are supposed to be the funny parts.  Literally, that's all you get.  He doesn't have many friends at school, he befriends a mexican student, and he has a weird uncle that sells tupperware and an older brother that has an online girlfriend.  The mexican student ends up running for class president.  The hilarity ensues.

Seriously, I am at a loss as to why so many people think this movie is funny.  It probably has something to do with the fact that there hasn't been a decent comedy movie written in years.  I lost respect for a lot of friends' taste in movies after seeing this.  As for the amazon rating, maybe all the people reviewing it are MTV reps.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie.

He's living at home with his brother (training to be a cage fighter and talks to hot chicks over the Internet), and his grandmother and her pet llama Tina. If he's got any great ambition or goal in life, you can't tell what it is.

Then the bottom falls out, and his shady Uncle Rico moves in. Uncle Rico engages in various money-making ventures and relives his supposed football glory days. At the same time, Napolean befriends a new kid in school, Pedro, and helps him run for class president.

You just have to have a certain sense of humor for ""Napolean Dynamite."" Yes, it's slow, the camera work is pretty static, and it makes no sense often. But, on the other hand, when it drops a line, it makes it count! And Jon Heder has such a great style delivering these lines. (""Come on, Tina, eat your ham!"" is one of my favorites.

And you know the uncle. The ex-highschool jock who wasn't all that great to start with but still finds his high school athletic days to be the high point of his wretched existence.

MTV Movies has assembled this film to go after the cult movie business: that is the business that keeps-on-a coming! As in ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and ""Showgirls"": films so bad that they are good.

The problem here is that both the makers of the ""RHS"" and ""Showgirls"" tried to do something important and wound up on their a**; whereas MTV bypassed the important thing and went directly for the a** heap which is calculating at least and pandering at best.

But, as I've always said: it's what is up there on the screen that counts and what there is up there in ""ND"" is dull, dumb and disastrous...the three deadly d's.

I happen to belong to the latter category.  I only watched the first 15 minutes of the movie, and then gave up waiting for something to happen.  The ""movie"" was plot-less, the characters flat and dimension-less.  It was like sitting in front of a wall and watching fresh paint dry.  Scenes ended with nothing happening, dialog rolling from the most boring of characters.

I usually look for an Amazon review average of 4 or greater, reasoning that a movie that gets a low vote of 2 and a vote of 5 averages 3.5, which just glancing at the summary vote looks like a pretty good movie, but might be a real dog.

This film is, you've probably already guessed it, one of my son's all time favorite films.  He could be a salesman for it, he's sent dozens to rent it or see it at the show.  He bought the sound track.  He's seen it a dozen times already, and when he got me to sit and watch it today with him, he was constantly saying the punch lines right before they happened.  The turd.

Probably my problem.

Maybe I'm too cynical, perhaps the movie is such genius that it really is brillant after all.  Perhaps you'll have to find out for yourself, I mean, even Pulp Fiction was hated by some and loved by others.

I'll say this; the last major scene of the film, a dance number done by the nerd in front of the school, that was well done.  You have to be really good to dance well in a bad way, if you know what I mean.  Anyway, good luck figuring out if this movie is worth seeing.",1104624000,,1633,4.17948717948718

1562449,5,B00005JNBQ,"As someone who has been to Preston Idaho, has a good friend from there (who is currently in Afghanistan), and currently lives in Utah, (but went to High School in semi-rural Massachusetts, class of 84), this movie moved me quite a bit.  I won't say I was a Napoleon in school, but the situations, and the characters, should be familiar to anyone who went to a small town high school.  While it does not have a plot in a normal literary sense, it very definitely has a meaning.  It is a humorous, subtle, revenge of the nerds.  Everyone who was not a jock or cool dude in High School can probably relate and enjoy.

For those people who are confused about the setting of the movie -- it is in the current time, probably 2004 (in the opening credits the HS ID card is labeled 2004-2005).  This is ""small town"", and in Idaho, where, like Utah, trends take 10 years to show up from the West or East coast.  The everage student at Preston High in the movie looks like they are from the current age -- Napoleon, who seems to shop at the local ""DI"" (Deseret Industries -- Idaho, Utah, NV, Arizona thrift store chain), like many people in small towns who don't have lots of funds, probably do -- looks like the 80s some of the time because of his economic ""class"" which leads to his choice of stores to shop at (see above).

All the ""Flip"", ""Fetch"", ""Sweet"" and such words bring a smile to anyone who has lived in Idaho or Utah.  There is a ""local"" feel but excepting some of the Idaho/Utah culture that sometimes shines through, this could have been set in Indiana or Nebraska or Iowa or anywhere else with small rural towns.

I thought it was great.  My brother back in New Hampshire thought it was funny, but probably would have given it 3 stars. My wife, who is from Japan, left after the first 30 minutes -- she doesn't have the cultural background to relate at all...

The last scene of the movie, with the dodgeball, brought it all to a touching conclusion for me.  In their own ways, the geeks or nerds find friendship and ""love"" as well...",1104537600,15,2040,4.365079365079365
1562450,5,B00005JNBQ,"I had a bit of skepticism going into watching this film because of all the praise it had received. Usually those types of movies don't live up to the hype after all. It is true that there are two types of comedy: those that rely more on slapstick humor, and those that are more of a deadpan kind of humor. This movie definitely is the latter, and based on which kind you find more appealing may determine whether this movie is for you. However, as far as being in a class all its own, Napoleon Dynamite definitely deserves that distinction, as it is one of the more refreshing comedies to come out in a long time. It does not rely on nudity, profanity or potty jokes to get its laughs; rather, it uses the oddities of its characters and their unlikely situations.

 Napoleon Dynamite, which was made by MTV, is a movie that chronicles the high school life of one geeky teenager (Napoleon), and uses odd characters and situations to gain much of the humor Some notable characters are Pedro (the new kid at school that Napoleon befriends, who eventually decides to run for class president), Napoleon's 32 year old brother Kip (who lives at home with Napoleon and chats online to women) and Uncle Rico (Napoleon's sleazy and macho uncle, who apparently is still living in the 80s).  Napoleon is the kind of guy that some may classify as being odd, weird, eccentric, unusual or maybe a little of all of those. His mangy orange hair and monotone voice seem to add to his unusual personality.  Both at school and at home he tends to get himself into unusual circumstances and predicaments.

This is one movie that really didn't need a plot, mainly because its strength is its characters and their ridiculous situations. For instance, there is a segment where Kip talks Napoleon into going to a self-defense program called Rex Kwan Do that is hilarious. Rex is a loud, aggressive, obnoxious body builder type who wears a bandana with stars on it, yellow glasses, a polo shirt with his name on it, and work out pants that are red, white and blue. After Kip volunteers to be the guinea pig while Rex demonstrates his methods on him, Rex exclaims boldly to the class of listeners, ""No more flying solo! You need someone watching your back at all times!"" There is also a funny scene where Pedro runs for class president and Napoleon, who had been practicing dancing, does a solo dance for the class after Pedro's speech.

Uncle Rico's character really stole the show in many respects. After Napoleon's grandmother leaves town for a few days, Uncle Rico comes to watch over Napoleon and his brother. Rico is obsessed with the idea of going back to 1982 so he could relive a high school football game and make the critical pass in a game.  He eventually gets Kip to buy a time travel machine online, which, of course, doesn't work. He also invites Kip into a little business endeavor where they are selling items door to door. Eventually Napoleon becomes angry because Uncle Rico is pestering everyone around him, even the girl at school who likes Napoleon, with his business.

Although the movie seems to be stuck in two different time periods, I thought the film was an original idea for a comedy. Far too often comedies have become formulaic and this is one movie that doesn't have a predictable mode to it. Normally these types of odd characters in a film only go so far (as we have seen with many of the Saturday Night Live skit based movies), but Napoleon Dynamite works well, and doesn't try too hard for laughs, which probably gives it more of an appeal. Overall I thought it was hilarious, and would recommend at least giving it a try.",1104537600,8,3631,4.601236476043277

I think that the cast said it best that everyone can relate with at least one of the people portrayed in the movie. For me, it's Napoleon, for my sister, it's Kip, and for my senior friend, it's Deb.

I am not much of the going-outter since I have a strict mom, but nevertheless after months of seeing Vote for Pedro tshirts and endless quoting from my peers, I bought the movie on DVD and it surprised me. This movie is really a breather from the endless list of teenage high school movies about boy/girl lusting after girl/boy and what they would do to get there. Not to mention all the drug/alcohol/etc references made in between. This is not a love story, though there are romantic tie-ins, but simply, the dork of the school having to deal with a unusual family, mean bullies, and helping Pedro win the school election against popular Summer Wheatly.

When my friend made me see this movie, I had never heard of it, but once i'd scene it, I loved it. It was funny, strange, and has a large number of people who either love it, or hate it. I suppose it all depends on your sense of humor.

In a way, it's hard for me to understand why some people seem to dislike the characters so much. It kind of seems like your not even supposed to like them, and to me, that makes them loveable in their own weird way. Napoleon seems to have this idea that the popular kids are the ones who are losers, which in this case, they are. Sure he's kind of a jerk sometimes, but how do you expect someone to be that has never really had someone be nice to him.

Another thing that I've heard people say about this film, is that Napoleon is an unbelievable character. Sadly, I have to disagree. I have know someone almost exactly like Napoleon, weird afro, and all. He was also a jerk and thought everyone else was kind of a loser. He was treated just like  Napoleon by his peers. To me, this movie was very truthful about people and even though it's presented in a strange, yet delightful way, it is a movie worth watching.",1104451200,2,1261,4.1387755102040815
1562558,5,B00005JNBQ,"Easily the latest cult classic.

I must admit, when I first heard of this movie I had no idea it even existed! Upon

watching the trailer on television some few days later, I was literally in stitches on the floor. Just the look of Napoleon's face (""You better watch it; it's the greatest movie ever"" or something like that) was enough to send me into hysterical laughter.

It's plotless; completly pointless, I am totally admitting. But the way it revolves around Napoleon's strange and twisted life, from his stay-at-home, Internet-obsessed older brother to his out-and-about grandmother and his living-in-the-past uncle (1982? Need I say more?), I found myself not looking for a plot. Simply observing the way they lived and engaged with other people was so hysterical I didn't even think of a plot (save for Pedro's race against Summer).

Napoleon Dynamite is confusing. It has a kind of dry humor that I haven't really seen in many other kinds of films. Personally, Napoleon wasn't the easiest character to love; he often barked at family members and randomly expected people to do orders for him (which is later explained in the DVD commentary), but in the end I found myself rooting for Napoleon as he won over his school during Pedro's skit.

Before I end, I'd like to personally address reviewer Donna who totally criticised the movie over the Mexican ""racism."" I am Mexican and found absolutely nothing offensive. It appears to me that you don't watch absolutely any TV since that is how most Mexicans are portrayed and while I don't act like that at all, I do know many who do just like in the movie(s). This movie isn't trying to make a point. It's just trying to be funny; it's not trying to piss anybody off.

I highly recommened this film. While some may not immediately understand the film's rather dry sense of humor, those who do take part in it will eventually see it and find themselves laughing all the way.",1104451200,8,1928,4.740298507462686

1562652,5,B00005JNBQ,"Here's a review from a 41 year old man.  I've read lots of reviews of this movie that absolutely trash it. And obviously, it's become quite a ""cult"" hit amongst a younger crowd.  In fact, it was my 17 year old son who insisted my wife and I see it.  And we immediately loved it, from the delightful opening credits to Napolean's first line ""Whatever I want to!  Gosh!!""

The critics who have trashed it frequently say that it makes fun of its characters...that it condescends to them. I'm surprised at that attitude.  In so many movies, oh, let's cite ""Revenge of the Nerds"" as an architypical example, the ""nerds"" are losers who aren't really.  They're just different from the jocks or the ""beautiful people,"" but by the end, they've changed, become winners and made fools of the bad guys. Everyone learns a lesson.

The fact is, these movies are untruthful, however ""uplifting"" they may be.  We all know that in life, there ARE ""losers.""  People with not a whole lot to offer the world in general.  Napolean and his family and friends ARE losers. And Napolean KNOWS it. He doesn't seem to dream of being accepted. His ambitions (to draw, to be a martial artist / bow staff wielder, etc.) are things he is deluded about, but he seems to know it.

The movie isn't about how Napolean rises from the lower depths to become some sort of hero. Essentially, we see him pull himself up by his own moonboot-straps, primarily to take a few steps into to a world where he connects with people.  He's not about taking on society or arguing that he's ""different but just as worthy"", as the NERDS movies would.

When his brother Kip takes him to a Tae Kwon Do class, Napolean is inspired by the ridiculous owner's words, ""Everyone needs a buddy, no more flying solo.""  He goes out and makes friends with the friendless Pedro, and says to him, ""We're pretty much buddies now, right?  So you've got my back and stuff, right?""  Napolean just wants someone to have his back and vice-versa.

Later in the movie, Napolean shows his character when he gets Pedro's back by providing entertainment during the school elections.  I won't say more, except to say that Napolean's bravery and reluctance are palpable in the hilarious and touching scene.

And what about his ""enemies?""  There is one jock who beats up on Napolean for no good reason, and this guy never really gets a comeuppance.  This guy doesn't get any support from others at school,either, and we certainly know that this ""jock"" is a loser too.

Part of this comes from the fact that the movie is set in a small town in an ""obscure"" state (Idaho), that appears to offer few prospects to anyone.  No one dreams of going to Hollywood or becoming a star or a computer whiz, doctor, etc. etc.  There aren't any dreams. (Although, to Napolean and Pedro's credit, they seem to have quite a knack at agriculture...which may be what lays in their future; Deb is a natural entrepreneur.)

Napolean, basically, is a loser comfortable in his own skin, and beneath his sullenness, is...a sullen teenager.  He's a pain in the neck sometimes, but through his modest strength of character, he makes a close friend, and takes tentative (and VERY sweetly convincing) steps towards a first romance.  But only tentative...the final shot of him playing tether ball with his female friend tells us all we need to know about how ready he may or may not be for love.

Also, this is a rare movie that shows people who don't have a lot of money.  The lack of money is dealt with constantly (they can't afford martial arts lessons, an extra car, a new suit, etc.) This is very refreshing, because in most movies dealing with teens, most of the kids (winners and losers alike) aren't exactly hurting for money.

The movie is packed with indelible characters (each more self-deluded than the next) and gentle affirmations of how there is someone for everyone...even Napolean's more hapless brother Kip. It's also very funny (Napolean teaching himself to dance, the farmer shooting his cow, the llama, Uncle Rico's almost pathological desire to travel back in time, etc.)

I don't know why this movie connects to today's teens. I'm not a teen, afterall.  But I sure see teens I know in Napolean.  His bursts of ""Idiot!"" ring quite true.  But I appreciate the quiet, unexpected heart of the movie, and I believe the filmmakers aren't poking fun at these characters...they are just staying true to who they are.  I also appreciate that the film is PG rated and doesn't need to show teens all obsessed with sex, drugs, inappropriate music, etc.  They probably are, but the filmmakers aren't interested in examining the usual...they're shedding a little light in humerous corners we don't usually look.

This movie is also very unique in that it has mild cussing and no sex, which is practically unheard of these days in media.

1562654,4,B00005JNBQ,"In high school, I was one of the nameless, faceless rabble who drew little attention, maintained a low profile, and caused little trouble all in the hopes of getting out relatively unscathed, a goal I managed to accomplish, partly due to my sometimes intimidating presence, but mainly because I was able to fit in, sort of like a fish within a shoal...but there were those who weren't so fortunate, as obvious physical characteristics or personality traits (or both) tended to enunciate their presence regardless of vain attempts to `blend in' or enjoy the anonymity I, and those like me, tended to take for granted.  Napoleon Dynamite (2004) is a film about one of those individuals.

The film, written and directed by Jared Hess, takes place in a small Idaho town and stars Jon Heder as the title character (he reminded me a lot of Timothy Busfield's character of Arnold Poindexter in the 1984 film Revenge of the Nerds).  Also appearing is Jon Gries (Real Genius, Fright Night Part II), Aaron Ruell, Efren Ramirez (Kazaam), Tina Majorino (she played the little girl with the map on her back in Kevin Costner's flopperino Waterworld), and Haylie Duff, sister to the more famous Hillary Duff, who both share a surname that's the same as Homer Simpson's favorite alcoholic beverage, Duff Beer.

Napoleon Dynamite is an odd character for sure, with his shaggy red afro, moon boots (he wears them year `round), and t-shirts usually featuring those glossy iron-ons so popular in the 70's (he seems to purchase much of his wardrobe at the local thrift store) with a penchant for drawing mythical creatures, boasting about fictional girlfriends who live in other states (don't they always?), and touting his non-existent martial arts abilities, ""You know, there's like a b*tt-load of gangs at this school. This one gang kept wanting me to join because I'm pretty good with a bowstaff"".  Oh yeah, he breathes mostly through his mouth, and his vernacular includes, but isn't limited to, the liberal usage of such words like sweet, flippin', gosh, freakin', and heck, and he, along with his 32 year old brother Kip (Ruell), live with their grandmother, who owns a llama named Tina.  After an ATV accident sends grandma to the hospital, Uncle Rico (Gries) arrives to watch over the boys, and involves Kip in his schemes to make some sweet cash.  Napoleon, meanwhile, finds a friend in a newly arrived Hispanic student named Pedro (Ramirez) and he and their shy and kinda dorky friend Deb (Majorino) assist Pedro in his bid to become the next student body president, their competition being Summer (Duff), member of the cheerleading squad and the most popular girl in school.  Do the trio have a chance in beating the juggernaut that is Summer?  Perhaps, but it requires Napoleon to pull forth from within something no one would have realized he had, not even himself...

The film is very odd...it's kind of a mix of the Coen brothers (Fargo, Raising Arizona), John Waters (Crybaby), and the earlier films of John Hughes (Sixteen Candles).  There's not much of a story at the beginning, more of a series of innocuous, unrelated, comical events, but later on we do see some development in this area with regards to Napoleon and Deb helping Pedro in his running for student body president.  Some scenes will make little or no sense in relation to what you may perceive as the story, so my recommendation is to just let it go, and enjoy the film for what it is, whatever it is...the real fun lies within Heder and his complete submersion into the character of Napoleon, wallowing in his own uncoolness.  Initially most will probably find him annoying and off-putting, but he sort of grew on me, and I actually found myself quietly rooting for him, in his most simple of endeavors (like trying to find a sweet fanny pack at the local thrift store), but don't get the wrong impression.  This isn't a triumphant nerd film (the nerd beats the jocks and/or gets the head cheerleader in the end), but a character-driven slice of weirdness that has a tendency to amuse.  The dialogue contains tons of quotable lines, and comes across genuine sense of realism.  The composed music by John Swihart and chosen pre-recorded material used to make the soundtrack complemented the film very well.  I think my favorite scene is when Napoleon discovers his uncle's crude time machine (which he purchased of the internet), and decides to give it a try...does it work?  Well, it does something, but I won't tell you what...one thing I really noticed was an absolute absence of profanity.  I'm not against its' usage in films, and have even become used to it (for better or worse), so it was kinda refreshing.

The picture quality, presented in both 1.85:1 anamorphic wide screen and 1.33:1 full screen (both sides of the DVD are used), looks sharp and clear, with the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio coming through very well.  Special features are numerous and include a commentary track by the director/writer Hess, actor Heder, and producer Jeremy Coon, along with deleted scenes (with optional commentary), a short film entitled `Peluca' (basically the original concept for the character of Napoleon Dynamite, also with commentary), a number of MTV promotional spots, a still gallery, a featurette on the shooting of the final scene (keep watching the film after the credits to see a newly filmed 4 minute sequence shot a year after the film was released, made especially for the DVD release), and a promo for the FOX television series Arrested Development.  The special features are split between the two sides of the discs, so be sure to flip it over once you've finished one side.  My recommendation is to rent the film before buying, as it's not for everyone (I wouldn't bother showing it to my mother, as I know she wouldn't attempt to understand the where the humor comes from within this film).

1562655,3,B00005JNBQ,"The director Jared Hess brings the viewers a minimalistic comedy about a complete loser, Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder), with no self-esteem, skills, or friends.  The film is on occasion offensively straightforward as it pokes directly on Napoleon through the way he dresses, behaves, and how people around him act toward him.  Several geek films has been made in the past such as Revenge of the Nerds (1984), Rushmore (1998), and American Pie (1999), but Napoleon Dynamite delivers a film unique in the sense that it is directly making fun of the nerd.  This is, on occasion, hilarious as the things that Napoleon does seem awkward and embarrassing, yet there is a finer touch of compassion for him as he struggles with his daily endeavors.  In a sense it becomes much like a clown show at a circus.  It is funny, but at the expense of the main character.

The film displays a number of episodic events that comprise a cinematic montage of Napoleon's lifestyle.  Through the montage the audience learns that Napoleon lives with his grandmother and his older brother, that is a nerd much like himself.  The mise-en-scene and the script also lays out the groundwork for why Napoleon is a nerd, as nobody really offers him help with anything.  This tall gangly high school kid that constantly has his mouth open while he peaks through his glasses like a mole attempts to separate the shadows in order to distinguish what is in front of him.  It is impossible not to feel sorry for him while laughing at his idiosyncrasies.

The audience is presented with how he becomes friends with Pedro (Efren Ramirez), a new student in his school, and with Deb (Tina Majorino).  Through their minute help Napoleon finds an insignificant amount of courage as it provides him with enough hope to begin regaining some of his lost self-esteem.  The quest for something better also has it's difficulties as Napoleon must deal with his scheming uncle Rico, who brings his older brother into his schemes, as they also offend him in public.  The struggle that Napoleon is fighting is for his own place in society as he wants something better, yet his awkwardness within society makes it difficult for him to adjust.  Besides Napoleon's struggle there are several amusing situations such as when he must feed his grandmother's lama and the drawing he sends to a girl he wants to ask out to an upcoming school dance.

The opening credits seem to have been influenced by Dogma 95 as it uses food and pictures in order to introduce the cast and crew of the film.  Nonetheless, it is a fun and clever beginning that sets the tone for the rest of the film.  The camera work and story bear some similarities with Rushmore (1998) and Royal Tenenbaums (2001) by Wes Anderson, but it does not copy these films as it remains unique.  The story is fragmented in chronological order and Napoleon leaves a lasting imprint with the audience.  Yet, the story itself does not seem to leave much of anything for the audience to ponder, but maybe the film will give some extra laughs with friends thanks to Jon Heder's character in the film.",1104364800,,3098,4.744402985074627

I know a few people who really like this film, but they were still in onesies when most of the ""kitsch"" depicted was reality... Furthermore, there are so many eras depicted here at once that only those who were too young to understand what was going on in the 70's & 80's would find 'Napoleon Dynamite' amusing.  I gave a 1 star rating for the milk tasting scene & and the way Napoleon power chugs Gatorade after his ""work-out"" - probably the best parts of the entire film.",1104364800,7,524,4.336734693877551
1562660,4,B00005JNBQ,"i'm one to usually spring for polarizers.  this is to say unintentionally i usually fall for films that have some audacity, that get many people split.  i call these ""black licorice"" films.  there's black licorice in everything, though...art, music, people.  a lot of cool smart people will be taken aback by movies i like, and i usually think i'm a cool guy of fair intelligence.  i liked napoleon dynamite, and it appears that many others do, but many also hated it.  i must say that i liked it more than ""office space"" and ""rushmore"", names that keep poppping up on this list.  the reason being is that there are no ""speilberg"" sentiments here as there are even in many fairly ok movies like ""rushmore.""  this is a bleaker yet not mean spirited type of movie.  it's a little bit like the recent scottish movie ""rat catcher"", yet not as dark and way more american and retarded.

 i like blank open ended movies that plod along.  they help me relax, because my mind just goes where it goes, perceiving, not being manipulated by musically enhanced hollywood reverent emotions.  ""napoleon d."" does get a little heavy handed with 80s retro, which, while never cloying, makes me slightly leery of MTV's (the producers of this movie)smarmy calculation with the 80s retread phase going about these days(the movie even contains a time machine set for 1982).  but i'm happy to say that even though this is an ""MTV Film"", it's not a turd, but pretty great.

there is a very flat feeling to the whole movie, but not in a bad way. it reminded me of herzog's ""heart of glass"", where the cast was hypnotized before shooting the rushes.  while not aspiring to ponder profound things like herzog, ""nap. d."" does dish out a lot of atmosphere.  just putting you into a time and place for a few hours.

this is a good movie for people who are chill and don't have a chip on their shoulder and take themselves so seriously that that they run to their computer after they see a movie and flame everyone else for having an opinion contrary to theirs.

i like black licorice movies because they inspire thought.  this could have been a typical movie, but i must admit, the teen misfit movie was given a new dimension here and i just recommend that people check it out.

incidentally, i went to a rural high school, and i found a lot of the movie to be spot on.  people get pretty quirky when there's nothing to do but drive around back roads and hang out with one's pals etc, not to mention when decent jobs of any kind are far and few between!  the ""locals"" are not abused here, but dealt with tenderly.  don't be so sanctimonious....like you've never laughed at trashy white people culture!!",1104364800,5,2672,4.553459119496855

1562751,4,B00005JNBQ,"Napolean Dynamite is the sleeper hit of the year.

A tale of an absurdly unpopular kid named Napolean Dynamite who lives around losers; his brother who spends his entire time on the internet chatting with his ""girlfriend"" who he has never met in person, his uncle who hasn't got over the loss of a football career 20 years past and shoots himself on camera throwing some lousy passes, his grandmother who goes on motorcycle ventures, a girl interest who has a pony tail on one side of her head, and a friend named Pedro who does not speak good english and goes out 'building' cakes for girls he wants to ask out to the dance and later runs for class president against the most popular blonde in the school. Pretty much, all the characters in Napolean are wierdos! But that's what makes them likable, and that's what makes the viewer not take the movie seriously and just laugh it away.

However, the movie does end with a nice resolution for all the characters' deficiencies. The movie wraps with the class presidential campaign where Napolean gives his remarkable dance and blows everybody away!

All the actors in the movie are unknown or just not famous. This movie will change that for most of them including John Heder, who plays Napolean.

You know what, just watch this movie already, Gosh!!!

This is my favorite movie of 2004, possibly my favorite movie ever.  I am an educated, intelligent, mother of three.  My 12-year old daughter and I are crazy about Napoleon Dynamite-every time we watch it, we are doubled over with laughter.  I suspect this is one of those movies you either love or hate, there's no middle ground. If mainstream humor is more to your taste (I'm thinking Austin Powers or, uh, I don't know, that kind of thing), maybe you should skip ND.

1562753,4,B00005JNBQ,"Napoleon Dynamite is one of the funniest movies I've seen in the last few years.  Its very deadpan humor might rub some people the wrong way -- but for me and for many, the humor hits the bullseye.  Napoleon is a nerd who hits the pinnacle of nerdiness and yet seems to exude a common sense sadly lacking in his brother and his uncle.  His classmates are all easily recognizable for us all because they bear such a close resemblance to reality.  I think just about everyone has had a Pedro, a Napoleon, and a Summer in their past.  The film is funny because the characters are real.  The barebones and almost plotless story is hilarious because it, too, is real.

In a tongue and cheek sort of way, Napoleon and his friends are elevated, in a certain sense, to a new level of respectability.  Without giving away the plot, we are are rooting for Pedro and happy for Napoleon.  Nerdy beyond nerdiness, ordinary beyond ordinariness, both characters win our hearts because they don't seem to be actors in the latest comedy film.  They seem to be real people.

Best of all, the film keeps any crude humor to the bare minimum.  Instead, it finds its humor in the bizarre happenings of everyday life.  It is genuinely funny in its own right -- a rarity these days.

Those who are looking for arthouse cinema, as some other reviewers have, are looking in the wrong place.  I'm a big fan of some great filmmakers, including Ozu, Kurosawa, and Satyjit Ray, but this film is not meant to be high art.  Instead, it is a comedy piece that is fresh, original, and sure to be a cult classic.  Enjoy",1104192000,5,1584,4.463414634146342
1562754,4,B00005JNBQ,"I am 36 and loved this movie. Why 4 stars and not 5? Well, its not a masterpiece, but it delivers a lot of laughs with unknown actors, with good acting and poking fun at elements of American society that are never touched in most movies. The critiques some reviewers give are true: it has no plot, and the characters are all dimwits. But that doesn't mean it isn't hilarious. I won't badmouth the people who hated it, because my wife is one of them. This movie requires a certain sense of humor. If you have my wife's sense of humor, and think Shrek is really funny (I watched the entire Shrek 2 movie plus the DVD extras, and I think I laughed twice), then you won't appreciate this film. If you like silly/quirky humor like me, you will probably laugh a lot with this film. I like comedies that are silly, quirky and relatively clean. Some that come to mind are Airplane!, Three Amigos! and The Emperor's New Groove. If ridiculousness makes you laugh, there is plenty here. Rent it first, then if you like it, buy it to encourage the filmmakers to produce more. As for the acting, those who say these guys can't act somehow don't seem to realize that these actors are not the dopey people they seem to be in the movie. It takes talent to pull this off. These are not over-the-top Jim Carrey performances. These characters are completely believable, and I don't laugh at them, as one reviewer suggests, out of any sense of superiority, but because the things they do and say are so ridiculous and at the same time believable. I would eat lunch with Napoleon and Pedro any day, and I was never a nerd. Classic moments include Pedro shaving his head one afternoon when he realizes that his hair is making him hot, then realizing that his chances of winning the student body president spot will be hurt by his bald dome, so he gets a girl at school to find him a wig. The way these characters approach the whole ridiculous situation in a totally matter-of-fact, deadpan way is what makes it funny. They don't appear to see anything funny here. They're just reacting the best they know how to their circumstances. Most comedies, on TV and in the movies, are very predictable, with cute jokes and lots of grinning at the camera. If that's American comedy, this is the anti-comedy, about awkward people dealing with awkward circumstances in what seems to them a very logical way. I still love my wife, and she still loves me. Different people find different kinds of things funny. It's good to know there are a lot of others out there who enjoy this kind of more subtle but much more hilarious comedy.",1104192000,6,2596,4.51380042462845
1562755,4,B00005JNBQ,"If you are looking for overt, laugh aloud humor, then you will be disappointed in Napoleon Dynamite.  Any real verbal or visual humor is very deadpan and subtle, and hard to miss if you are seeking out a belly laugh.

The funniest part of the entire movie is the characters themselves, who go beyond nerd into the land of dweebs so inept that they are the ones that pass beyond the notice of society.  They are not handsome or beautiful, they are not smart, they have no talents, they are not social, and they are not even gifted with humor or likeable personalities.  They quite literally have absolutely nothing going for them except an exchange of oxygen and an ability to ambulate.

There is Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) who is a skinny, slack open-mouth-breather with frizzy orange hair and pants worn so high they look like they are eating him.  He is sullen and caustic, making up ridiculous stories that make him seem more important.  He lives with his fast-living Grandmother (Sandy Martin) and his 32-year-old unemployed brother Kip (Aaron Ruell).  Kip is skinny, poorly dressed, distinctly stupid, and spends his entire day in chat rooms on his PC.

Grandma gets injured while jumping her Quad over a sand dune, and sends Uncle Rico to watch the ""boys"".  Uncle Rico (played by Jon Gries) is an even older loser who lives in a hideous orange van, and constantly wishes he could time travel back to 1982 to change the outcome of a football game that he believes would have made him famous.  He makes his living doing door-to-door sales of everything from Tupperware to bust-enhancers.

Don't forget to watch this movie all the way to the end of the credits.  After the final credits, there is another entire scene to watch that you won't want to miss.

Napoleon Dynamite is well acted and well filmed, but is more a study in human ineptness rather than an outright comedy.  I would have liked to have seen more of Grandma in the movie, I believe she could have brought a little action and a few more laughs to the film.  Over all, not bad, but not good either.  My preference would have been to give it only 3.5 stars, but gave `Napoleon' the benefit of the doubt.  Recommendation: rent, don't buy.",1104192000,,2208,4.632390745501286

I saw this film in the local community theatre when it first debuted and I received it today from my friend Paul for my birthday, in addition to Katamari Damacy for PS2, and this film completely blows my socks off. The film is Napoleon Dynamite, an indie film by brothers Jared and Jerusha Hess, both Mormons, that is constantly hilarious without resorting to ""dick and fart jokes."" The film is also one for the kids as the closest to swearing is when a character, usually Napoleon, says ""Gosh!"" or ""Dang!"" Not only is the film hilarious but it tackles many important issues that lie just beneath the film's surface. The issue of economic wealth, racial harmony/disharmony, social and class harmony/disharmony, and rural American life.

My friends and I laughed throughout the entire film at the community theatre in a nonstop laughfest. Tonight was a repeat, albeit solo, laughfest.

A conventional plot involving a student election and a prom sub-plot, never really materialize in a decent climax (albeit, the wedding scene could be construed as such, though it does not even appear until after the movie credits).  But this misgiving in some measure is balanced by the bizarre performances, for Napoleon and his cronies are quite remarkable and memorable.  Napoleon is a character who appears to be in a perpetual state of angst and/or oblivion, and is very hilarious in his own right (not to mention the stoned expression on his face which he wears throughout the whole movie). At times Napoleon Dynamite feels like it was made in the late seventies or early eighties, there is a definite retro quality to it that is difficult to articulate.  One should take heed, however, if one is bored by the film after half an hour of viewing it.  The pace remains very slow, and character development is basically established and finalized within the first quarter or so.  But the comedic elements are very curious and subtle, and, at times, unrelenting which makes for Napoleon Dynamite's unique stature as a film that effectively synthesizes drama and irony.",1104019200,,1221,4.931707317073171

Napoleon Dynamite chronicles the life of a quirky teenager as he manages a unique home life, a budding romance, and a presidential campaign at his high school.  It is not the typical movie, and this is the strongest point.  In an era where most popular movies rely on special effects or gratuitous sex to entertain, Napoleon Dynamite employs neither.

However, other movie standards, like a moving plotline or even a story, are not present.  Despite, or maybe because of these shifts, the random and dry humor of the movie shines through.  The characters are unbelievably unique and at the same time familiar.  The acting is convincing, making these incredibly random characters completely believable.

I end this review with a warning; Napoleon Dynamite is not the typical blockbuster.  If you put the DVD in your player with those expectations, you are sure to be entertained by Napoleon Dynamite.",1103932800,6,943,5.032258064516129

The beauty of this movie is the fact that it didn't have to rely on any special effects, turn in plots or points it was trying to make with the viewer.  This movie is pure genius.

If you don't have a broud sense of humor, or appreciation for every little thing that make a movie great, then you better skip this one.  Jon Heder (the actor who played Napoleon) is not like this in real life, in fact he's married and quite down to earth.  In this movie you never once find him even close to out of character.  Yeah this isn't a drama, but the acting it incredible.  The whole cast is convincing to the point that you forget they are acting and in your mind you can't picture them any other way.

But one thing confuses me about what some people have to say about this movie. They call it hilarious. Sure, I got a couple chuckles here and there for the overall pathetic-ness of some of the characters, and the dance scene with Napoleon at the end of the movie is worth seeing, but I cannot pinpoint a single joke in the entire movie. The characters aren't loveable, and they're pathetic and exaggerated in their lack of energy, but there's also very little personality, and there's just no comedy in this film at all.

Perhaps people who find this film funny relate to this Napoleon character and his small town... I feel bad for you!

Keep in mind that some people who enjoy this film so much thought Anchorman with Will Ferrel was ""stupid"". I sincerely hope that people who share this opinion develop a real taste for comedy some day. I can't even call this film quirky.

Want a real comedy with real actors and a more intelligent comedic approach to benign every day life? Try Bartleby with Crispin Glover. That movie made me laugh hard and it evokes some sort of thought.

Napoleon Dynamite does neither.

The only complaint that I had was the timing.  There were very large chunks of time that nothing really happened, and there really isn't a plot. The story seemed a bit drawn out and thin, too. On the other hand it stands out from other comedies in its originality and focus on detail.  Just looking at John Heder,(Napoleon)is enough to make you laugh.  My favorite scene, is the one where he is thirsty and sweaty from dancing in his room! Final say: You have to develop a taste for this one.",1103846400,2,659,4.512605042016807

He's such a dork-- he's flippin' clueless and, what other reasons do you need, God! That's the way he talks. It's actually pretty funny!

Without John Heder, I don't think this movie could have survived or gained the momentum that it did. He IS Napoleon. Anyone else would have just been way under par. So Napoleon lives with his grandmother, his nerdy skinny brother, and a pet llama named Tina. He meets Pedro, a new kid a school and Deb, a shy girl who ""left all her crap on [his] porch,"" an assortment of bracelets and what not. They float along together, as Napoleon battles his Uncle Rico, tries to get dates, and also attmpets to elect Pedro as president of the school.

Hard to say whether or not you'll like this. My punk rocking sister loved it. My dad enjoys movies overall and called it ""quirky."" Which usually means he liked it. My mom hated it, but she's apt to dislike any comedy unless it has Jim Carrey in it. I liked this one. It's weird, but Napoleon was too interesting for me to turn it off.

For example: ""don- hey napoleon, what did you do last summer?

napoleon- I told you, i spent it with my uncle in alaska hunting wolverines!

don- did you kill any?

napoleon- yes like fifty of them, they kept trying to attack my cousin what the heck would you do in a situation like that?

don- what kind of gun did you use?

napoleon- a frickin twelve-guage what do you think!? GOSH!""

Napoleon will remind you of at least one of your K-12 chums (where are they now?). He's no hero, but it is fun to watch him blunder through a bad couple of days. Surrounded by familiar characters that almost need no introduction (Uncle Rico, a study in casting/character acting perfection), he sets off on an explosive, action packed effects extraviganza.

Well, maybe not, but the fact that you can almost smell the tater tots and soiled elasto/parachute/hammer pants makes this a trip down memory lane. Any more, I enjoy getting thrown a curve ball when I go see a movie. Napoleon Dynamite satisfied that, and should be considered among the great works of restrained, simplistic, comedic genius.

The first time I saw it was a couple months ago in the theatres with a couple guys. We were at the mall and didn't know what to do, so we went to this movie called Napolean Dynamite because another guy recomended it. And let me tell you, I couldn't thank this guy enough. This is easily one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I've seen it like 7x on dvd because we rented it. Its just a story about a couple nomral people living their boring lives. My favorite scene from the movie isn't funny, but very deep. The shot when the three of the main characters (Napolean, Perdo, and Deb) standing at the side of the dance, (shot from behind them) watching everyone else have fun and watching the world go by. But I have to say the best thing about this movie was that it was made by just normal guys. Listen to the commentary, its just three normal guys sitting around laughing about the movie and their experience making it. Its not some director saying ""Now the symbol in this scene is that the fire is above the ice, meaning that Joe's battle with himself...""
But anyway, I'm rambling again. So I'll end by telling you that this was a very funny movie. And it's highly recomended.

1562995,4,B00005JNBQ,"On alternate sites, I've read great and lousy reviews of this movie.  The reviewers who panned it simply don't get it.  This film takes an eyes wide open (unlike Napoleon) view of high school nerdiness and alienation.  I know kids like Napoleon and it's about time they were presented in an unsanitized way, in full, naturally comedic splendor.  ""Napoleon Dynamite"" doesn't look down at these characters, nor does Napoleon have an insider's insight to Columbine, as one reviewer suggested.  It unapologetically presents the characters in an only slightly exagerrated way.  The story (what there is of it) is as existential as the backdrop of Preston High School, Idaho.

One other note -- I've read several times that the setting for the movie is vaguely the 1980's.  That is clearly not the case, despite the use of Cyndi Lauper's ""Time after Time"" and other music.  For one thing, Kip's internet chatting and Uncle Rico's online purchase of a time machine would have been unheard of until the 90's.  Instead, the movie is set in a vaguely 90s to present day period, with the characters hopelessly stuck in a ""time warp"" -- again, played for comedic purposes.  Also, Rico repeatedly refers to his football glory days of 1982.  His character is easily in his mid to late 30s.

My son explains that this is a movie you have to see more than once to ""get"".  I didn't experience gut-busting laughs during my time in the theatre, but when my son said ""Your mom goes to college!"" on the way home, I began to understand the inexplicable humor I'd just witnessed.  4.5 stars!",1103760000,8,1568,4.7555555555555555

1562997,4,B00005JNBQ,"This is actually a great movie to watch with your young teens. This C movie, C because it has a budget cheaper than a B movie, is almost a twisted version of ""Leave it to Beaver"" without the hominess of the 1950's nuclear family. The Dynamite family is a fractured group of relatives living in the wide-open spaces of Idaho surrounded by farms. The High School and community seem to be in a time warp since the ""hip kids"" in school actually look relatively like squares particularly the designated good looking guy antagonist who looks like he is sporting popular fashions from the mid 60's and he looks like Eddie Haskell (Leave it to Beaver) if Eddie had worked out (Son of Eddie?). Napoleon is handicapped by a family without parents that are never mentioned, he lives with his 32 year old unemployed computer nerd brother, his tough often absent grandmother, a sleazy visiting uncle who still wishes it was 1982 and he was a HS quarterback, all made worse by their poor economic situation. In addition, Napoleon has a tall-uncoordinated body, ill-fitting clothes, a bad haircut, an often-scrunched leer of a face and he possesses severely limited social skills. He is hopelessly antagonistic towards the in crowd, who he tries to combat by using over way over the top sarcasm. Although aware of his limitations, he naively strikes forward in attempts at dating and political school relationships. The movie is full of stilted dialogue that is sometimes painful (""you gonna eat your tots?)but fitting with the characters. The movie meshes surprisingly well with Napoleon and his friends Pedro, who runs for School President, and Deb, the nerd princess who pleasantly turn into an attractive young girl, surprisingly making headway although fighting extreme odds. Somehow this low budget flick got Hillary Duff's sister to play the antagonist sweet girl. A unique feature of the film is the periodic cameo like appearances of Pedro's cool and hip and slightly dangerous looking older cousins in a real ""boss car"" with great sounds. The cousins seemed to have transcended from our time into this Idaho time warp making their brief appearances startling but effective. On first take as an adult, you may reject this movie, but watching it with your kids you are more likely to pick up on this ultimate stark underdog movie that is extraordinarily unique.

Special visual effects are nonexistent.  At first glance, a strong narrative is lacking.  So, why would anyone want to sit through this movie?

The characters in this film appear to be two dimensional, but there is more going on here than your typical high school movie.  The characters, setting and plot are trapped on a banal merry-go-round.  Scenes often include boring neighborhoods, thrift stores, mundane high schools, and uninviting tracks of land.  There is nothing in the scenery that is really appealing.  The protagonist initially appears to a high functioning autistic, lacking in all but the most basic conversational skills.  He is surrounded by other family members who are lost on the trailing edge of internet chat room and various get rich quick pyramid schemes.  So what makes Napoleon Dynamite appealing?  Napoleon's adventure is just to make it through the next day - his world consists of the geek high school companions, thrift stores and family members who are poster children for dysfunction.

It's definitely funnier than most mainstream comedies -- particularly the scenes involving the Time Machine, the horse and the schoolbus, and the portraits on the wall in the living room -- but it chafes me and before you slam the non-helpful button, consider this:

1) The movie owes a lot to the spirit and style of Wes Anderson, right down to the precious opening credits, but it's not nearly as funny as ""Bottle Rocket,"" as unique as ""Rushmore"" or as moving as ""Tenenbaums.""

2) This is basically a quirky commercial stretched to 90 minutes.

3) Would anybody really like to spend time with Napoleon if they knew him in real life?  He's mean, unlikeable and his interests all seemed to be designed by writers into kitsch and irony.

4) Having most of the characters act like they're on serious meds or retarded doesn't make them endearing, it makes them seem self-conscious.  Seriously, what exactly is the intention of Pedro's constant ""the sedatives just kicked in"" demeanor?

Commendable aspects of this movie were that it was outstandingly hilarious, in fact I think there are never any periods of three minutes or more in the movie that go without an amusing comment from Napoleon. One such amusing comment is when Napoleon is asked by a kid on his bus what he is going to do today and he replies ""Whatever I feel like doing!

I mean I totally loved last year's Pieces of April, because the story and the cast touched me a great deal. So with this movie, I found it to be quite enjoyable, because the characters are well written, and the jokes worked. It's a movie that I can relate to, because I have been in Pedro and Napolean's shoes in high school as a outcast.

Napolean is a wierd and corky on the outside, but he's very sweet and kind on the inside. Nobody wants to be his friend, and he eventually became Pedro's(a Mexican immigrant) best friend, and he helped him run for President in school! A lot of funny things happen in the process of the campaign, and it was great when Napolean does his skit on stage. He danced with a Michael Jackson style to a song that stole the audiences' hearts and votes.

Napolean eventually falls in love with the sweet girl in school, and Pedro won the election. His friend found his soul mate named La Sofauwnduh, a sexy and sultry Black girl. His pathetic uncle who sells breast enhancement products also found the love of his life. So in the end, everyone is happy.

1563219,5,B00005JNBQ,"You don't have to be a hopeless geek or a hapless nerd to appreciate what might be the funniest film of the year.

Already a certified cult hit, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE (Fox) has given new meaning to ""Gosh!"" as an all purpose expression of exasperation.

I've seen this film three times and in spite of my alleged sophistication and maturity, I still laugh out loud at the perfectly captured teen 'tude that pervades this very rural comedy of manners.  Jon Heder is wonderful as Napoleon, a Preston, Idaho, high schooler coping with the mundane day to day problems of family, friends, and school.  But mostly it's the terminal boredom and growing anger of Napoleon's woefully unfulfilling circumstances that drive the quirky and weirdly charming story.  Listening to the straightforward commentary by Heder and screenwriter-director Jared Hess, it becomes clear that there's apparently little intended irony in the fact based events that make up this slightly twisted tale of not coming of age.  I hope there's a sequel. Maybe ""Napoleon Goes To College""?",1103500800,,1048,5.099415204678363
1563220,3,B00005JNBQ,"My fifteen year old son insisted that I see this film with him.  He had already seen it three times.  He is obviously a very big fan.

It can be safely said that ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is not a typical Hollywood production.  Rather it is a dead pan comedy that runs very much counter to what one might expect of an American film.

Napoleon is a sixteen year old nerd attending high school in the back blocks of Idaho - beautiful scenery but relentlessly boring in terms of lifestyle.  He is picked on at school and clearly doesn't fit in.  His only friend is an alienated Mexican also trying to come to grips with mid west America.  However, together they ultimately succeed despite Napoleon also having to deal with his dysfunctional family.  He has a crazy thrill seeking grandmother, a loser geek brother and an uncle whose mind still dwells in 1982.  Yet, somehow, this bizarre mix is conquered.

Despite protestations from my son, I'm unable to give this film more than three stars.  Perhaps it's me that doesn't fit in?  For a film that started out at art house cinemas it quickly went mainstream and with generally positive reviews.  See it to understand a world that many of us left behind many years ago.",1103328000,3,1210,4.593457943925234

Most of the humor is directed at and some might argue, against, the main character Napoleon, who is depicted as a nerd to end all nerds. But, the humor isn't cruel, because the audience loves and roots for Napoleon's success. The film is absolutely loaded with one-liners that you will catch yourself running back and forth with your friends long after you see the film. As far as longevity goes, after two viewings, the humor is not as grabbing as the initial. It probably won't hold up to a film like ""The Big Lebowski"".

I'm not sure how they chose to market this film, but I could not believe that it did not get the notoriety that I believe it should have. I don't want to get too much into the synopsis since it's probably covered in the Amazon Editorial Review, but I can say that Napoleon Dynamite is a film that everyone from 16 to 60 can relate to because we all go through at some point in our life what this main character goes through. I highly recommend this film and if I could give 100 stars I would. Some are already calling this a future Cult Classic and I would have to agree.",1102636800,3,666,4.053030303030303
1563305,5,B00005JNBQ,"As a college student, going to the movies is a little above my price range, but I am surrounded by people who can get anything off the Internet in a matter of hours. A friend of mine gave us a housewarming gift this semester: our very own copy of Napoleon Dynamite. He had downloaded it before it had even come out in major theaters here. None of us had seen it before, but over the months to follow we became intimately familiar with every line and character. There's no other way to put it - this movie is brilliant. It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over again. In fact, you have to. It creeps up on you. The first time you watch it it's pretty funny, but you don't think it's anything special. You go about your life. But over the next couple of days you find yourself saying strange things that you've never said before... Things like ""I wish you would get out of my life and SHUT UP!"" and ""That's true, that's true."" and ""How much you want to bet I could throw a pigskin over them mountains?"" Everyone frustrating in your life is easily brushed off with a ""GOSH! What an IDIOT!"" No one knows what you're talking about, but you know that someday they'll all understand.

The soundtrack is also amazing. Many songs I've known for years and loved on their own merit -- Most notably Jamiroquai's ""Canned Heat,"" have taken on new meaning.  Before, the song made me have to get up and dance whenever I heard it. It still does, but now it makes me laugh also. This movie is so amazing that I intend on purchasing a copy of the DVD -- or at least getting my parents to buy it for me for Christmas! While that may not seem like a big deal to many of you readers, let me tell you that for a college student, with limited funds but unlimited ability to get any form of media off the internet or college network, it is.

There's really no way to describe the actual content of this movie. Suffice it to say that it's set in an ambiguous time period (Sometime between the 80s and the present) with characters of ambiguous ages (Napoleon could be in middle school, or he could be a high school senior. It's believable either way). Each and every character is absolutely priceless, including the periphery characters like the ubiquitous public school jock, the little boy on the bus who asks ""What are you going to do today, Napoleon?"" and good old Lyle.

1563308,5,B00005JNBQ,"For the past few years there has been a movement in American film you could call ""The New Mormon Cinema.""  Young Latter-day Saint filmmakers (definitely inspired by the Sundance Film Festival which is held right in their own backyard) have been making inexpensive independent films that are targeted at the Mormon population that stretches in the west from Alberta in Canada down past the Mexican border (the so-called ""Mormon Corridor."")  Most of these movies have been really bad, cheaply done sit-com influenced ""comedies"" that have had absolutely no influence on non-Mormon audiences.  (With the honorable exeception of Richard Dutcher, the director of good movies like the missionary drama ""God's Army"" and the thriller ""Brigham City."")  Things began to change this year with widespread recognition going to the tough-minded World War II drama ""Saints and Soldiers"" and this twisted little comic  masterpiece, ""Napoleon Dynamite.""

Jared and Jerusha Hess are products of Brigham Young University's film school and they made ND with a bunch of their friends.  The unspoken assumption of this film is that most of the kids are Mormons.  Some critics who misunderstood the movie as ""condescending"" have no experience with real people like these.  I live in rural Utah and I can testify that Hess is only mildly exaggerating.  The critics somehow miss the love with which the characters are drawn, just as some Minnesotans weren't too thrilled with the Coen brothers' ""Fargo.""  Napoleon's pathetic older brother Kip has been singled out as particularly unbelievable.  But believe me, Kips are a dime a dozen in Idaho (and Utah, too.)

Napoleon himself is not so much acted as incarnated by Jon Heder, who would win some sort of Oscar if people could only see he was playing a role, not living it.  Napoleon is the real nerd deal, not some idealized John-Hughes-style Hollywood version.  You really feel the anguish of his life, even as it provokes guilty belly laughs.  The genius of the movie is how the Hesses take the angst of Todd Solondz (""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and ""Happiness"") and put their triumphantly uniquely Mormon spin on it.

Hess is the second Mormon director, after Neil LaBute in ""The Shape of Things"", to make reference to singer Elvis Costello (""Napoleon Dynamite"" is one of Costello's aliases.)  The movie Napoleon is as physically unprepossessing as Costello is, until he starts to sing.  You see, Mormons are always worrying about what other people think of them, because of their long-time outsider status in American society.  This overwhelming self-consciousness can make them feel as awkward and crushed by the culture as Napoleon is.  But inside they just know they are as dynamic as the very name ""Napoleon Dynamite.""  The opportunity awaits for them to strut their true stuff.  An individual like Napoleon can't be destroyed if he doesn't want to be.  There's something eternal in him that will win out.  The importance of this thought is why the Hesses avoid the very appearance of sentimentality in their presentation of Napoleon.  You have to learn to love him in spite of his monstrous imperfections, because he is human.  And you rejoice in Napoleon's final dance, which is five or six of the most joyous minutes in a movie this year.

It's also important that Kip and Napoleon redeem themselves by reaching out to others not like them.  Kip hilariously to La Fawnduh, and Napoleon to Pedro and Deb.  The Hesses are brave enough to make sympathetic jokes about multiculturalism here.  Certainly, Preston Idaho, won't save them; but maybe Detroit and Mexico will.  I left ""Napoleon Dynamite"" with genuinely earned good feelings about humanity in general and the future of Mormon movies in particular.",1102377600,68,3738,5.077049180327869

This movie is not funny.  It has an occasional moment here or there, and the ending is really, really funny.  But for the most part?  Terrible.

Again, the biggest problem is it isn't funny.  The main character is an unlikeable loser.  Usually a movie will have a loveable loser, but this guy is a jack-off and a half.  Meanwhile, so is his brother and his uncle.

There are only two characters that don't make you want to kill them, or yourself.  Those are the love interest and Pedro.  Both characters are nice people.  EVERYONE else in this movie is a terrible character and NOT funny.

Then there are the jerks at the high school including the arrogant, big-fish-in-a-little-bowl, cheerleader and wannabe class president, Summer. How many times have we seen those people in our everyday lives? Then there's the butchy looking grandma and the blatant mispronunciation of Mexican food names. Uncle Rico with his get-rich-quick-schemes. Anything sounding familiar yet? And of course, there's Pedro, the innocent, even keeled and socially detached teenage Mexican who serendipitously slogs through the high school social strata to ""make all your dreams come true"".

This film relies on sheer wit in creating its humour, which it certainly does not lack.  Napoleon Dynamite is funny in its own way.  It's the little things like the characters mannerisms and reactions that make this movie a sure cult classic.

Napoleon Dynamite is a teen movie that throws all of the formulaic teen movie elements out the window giving this genre a fresh breath of life.  Ultimately it is the superb performances from the actors/actresses that make Napoleon Dynamite as great as it is.

The premise of the movie is small town life shown through the eyes of anti-heroes.  And that is what makes Napoleon Dynamite different from other movies.  The laughs are endless and the characters are fascinating (in an ordinary way).

1563661,5,B00005JNBQ,"What a wonderfully inventive honest and hilarious movie this was, particularly when compared to the Hollywood sap that graces our screens these days. It was unbelievably deadpan, completely orginal and right from the opening credits made of various foods, i knew it was undoubtedly one of the best movies I have seen this year. Yet totally underrated.

It was wonderfully acted, from Napoleon to his afeminine brother and Spanish friend to his side ponytailed love interest/friend. The entire production was graced with a 1980s air that lends itself to social commentary about the progression (or lack thereof) of rurality, and even the costumes etc are incredibly well thought out and contribute to the entire work.

But the point, is there is no point. Nothing is learnt, developed, and the story is hardly plot driven. Yet the entire piece works magnificantly to go absolutely nowhere, and clearly, there should be a deemphasis on the complete conclusions and perfect Hollywood stars. This film is incredibly unique and should be viewed to understand why it works so wonderfully.

The humour is very remincient of 'Welcome to the Dollhouse' or 'Ghost World', and yet this work is perhaps more approachable and likable.",1099094400,4,1221,5.156565656565657

1563664,5,B00005JNBQ,"I knew absolutley nothing about this flick when my 14 year old red-headed math whiz son said Dad let's go see this movie. From the opening credits I was entertained. This movie, is essentially a ""day in the life of an Idaho high school nerd as he moves through various life cycle events and characters.""  Though the word ""nerd"" hardly seems to do justice to the timeless nature of title character Napoleon Dynamite. With little or no plot, Napoleon turned out to be more than part nostalgia. It was a stroll down memory lane. If I did not know that the writers in fact lived in Idaho, I would have sworn they had gone to my High School in South Florda in the late 70's. Our Senior Class Vice-President was in fact PEDRO from Mexico, our class Secretary, Melanie a blonde buxom cheerleader incarnate of this films' fictional ""Summer"" character and our Treasurer sported a huge Afro and all were clad in their finest disco outfits.

I guess this is why this sleeper film has gained such popularity. Forty-something dads and their teen kids can both see this movie together and come out repeating its hysterical dialogue.  The current crop of teen viewers are living these absurd stereotypes and situations (dating, class elections, high school dances, the cafeteria). The oldsters in the audience either were, or knew one or more of this film's quirky characters.

The acting and dialogue are pure genius in their simplicity and absurdity. As other reviewers have mentioned, lines from this flick will become folklore. I found myself sitting around our family dinner table spouting off Napoleonisms reminiscent of the best of Monty Python.

There's no plot, there's little direction, and there's little actual story taking place.  Despite those things, this movie was one of the most enjoyable and entertaining movies I've seen in a while.  I think it's great because it's a comedy out of the sheer lunacy of every character in the movie, not because of ridiculous gags that American cinema has overused to death lately.

I recommend this movie for everyone,  especially if you're drunk.  Really really really drunk.  When I buy this movie, I'm going to get drunk and laugh for hours!!",1098144000,,652,4.716814159292035
1563668,2,B00005JNBQ,"This film has been at our local independent theater for about six months now.  I could be exaggerating, but I do not know the exact time.  All I do know is that it has been there for a very long extended period of time.  I have heard from several kids (children between the ages of 10 and 15) that this was a very funny movie and it seemed like the parents were in agreement.  Normally, this would turn me off a film, but since it was a ""independent"" film, I thought that perhaps we had stumbled onto a goldmine and I was the last to reap the benefits.  So, without delay, I gathered up some friends and sat (with cackling girls behind us) as nearly two hours of my life was drained from my soul.  Between the inconsistent story, the jumbled themes, the off-beat pacing, the teenage girls laughing before the joke happened, and the ""must-seem-independent"" feel Napoleon Dynamite just didn't work.

I know, I know, let the gasping of air commence.  I have trouble seeing what everyone has loved about this film.  To begin with, why were we laughing at this character?  I remember the audience similarly laughing hysterically at Sandler's character in Punch-Drunk Love.  Is this character made to be laughed at?  Didn't anyone in the audience feel sorry for this underprivileged teenager?  While others were laughing hysterically at the overused and uncreative words that vomited from Napoleon's mouth, I was feeling sad for this guy.  He was constantly getting pushed around in school, he had a disorder of some kind that nobody seemed concerned about, and at first he had no friends.  He was a product of a dysfunctional family that we found funny.  It wasn't funny.  This film wasn't funny.  This film was sad, with some elements of humor mixed in to cover up the inhumanity.

Perhaps I am being too harsh on this film.  Perhaps I should just take it as a light comedy that speaks to the insecure teenager in all of us.  Sadly, I cannot.  Even if you look past the characters, which all seemed forced by the actors playing them, the cinematography and story was not very strong.  Napoleon did things that made no sense to me.  At first I thought he was a very intelligent person, just misunderstood in school, but later I discovered that he was just an idiot.  Education came last behind tetherball, girls, tots, and Pedro.  I never once understood the time frame of this film.  Were we watching a film set today, but seemingly still lost in the 80s or were we watching an 80s film?  Was the director paying homage to the 80s, or simply making fun of them?  These were key issues that needed to be explained that never were developed.  The music and costume pointed to the 80s, yet the music and calendars pointed to 2004.  There needed to be a set time for this film and it needed to be released so that we, the audience, were not confused by this idea.  Even the dancing seemed dated.

Next, while we were outside watching Napoleon create more insecurity for those unlike others, his family also co-existed with him.  This meant that while we were watching Napoleon at school, his family was continuing with life whether we knew what was going on or not.  This was a major downfall to this film.  I wanted to see more of a story with Kip and LaFawnduh.  I wanted to know more about Uncle Rico and the life that he led. I can honestly say that Uncle Rico's character was the least developed character that I have encountered in film in a long time.  I wanted to know more about Deb.  There was so much exploring that could have happened with this film that I felt cheated when the film was finally over.  Napoleon's world was huge, and maybe if we did more than just scratch the surface of his life I would have enjoyed this film much more.

Overall, this was a very poor film.  I could not relate or get involved with the characters in any way.  I felt the director was trying too hard to make the film seem independent with amateur shots and oddball antics.  Near the middle of this film I began seeing images that other directors have used especially like Wes Anderson (see Bottle Rocket) and Sophia Coppola (see Virgin Suicides).  But instead of actual creativity and some smart and witty writing, this film just fell short by substituting lines like ""sweet"" and ""GOSH"".  This was a sad excuse for character development.  I felt like I was watching a high school project that felt (and was) plagiarized and uncreative.  This was not the film that everyone spoke of, this was a petty excuse for a film by cheating us into thinking it could be more by having low budgets and a seriously challenged main character.  This is not a comedy.  While I did grin a brief moment during the FFA testing, the rest of the time I was counting the minutes until it was over.  I do not recommend this film to children unless you are suggesting that they laugh at those that are less fortunate.  If this is your goal, then Napoleon Dynamite is the film for you.

It's a Wes Andersen type character study with very little really of a story until about the halfway mark. Instead, we get slice-of-life moments as we watch Napoleon deal with new friendship, girls (especially shy but provocative Deb (Tina Majorino) who has eyes for our hero), bullies, martial arts and dance.

1563838,5,B00005JNBQ,"The summer movie season is gone and with it came the usual onslaught of action flicks, big-budget thrillers and even a few hilarious comedies. Matt Damon, Will Smith, Tom Cruise, Tobey Maguire and Will Ferrell all had big hits. However, in the midst of all the robots, amnesiac hit men, mustachioed newscasters and web slinging, a different kind of leading man set quite a unique landmark: Filmdom has a new reigning nerd, and his name is Napoleon Dynamite.

Newcomer Jon Heder stars as the protagonist in the title role of director Jared Hess' debut film about a tall, moon boot-wearing geek with thick glasses and a curly red hairdo trying to make it through his high school days in rural Idaho. He lives with his older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell), an equally clueless loser who spends his days chatting with babes on the Internet, and their grandmother, a four-wheeler enthusiast played by Sandy Martin.

After an accident in the sand dunes leaves granny with a broken coccyx, Napoleon and Kip's uncle Rico (Jon Gries) becomes their temporary caretaker. Uncle Rico assumes this responsibility the only way he knows how: by showing the boys boring videos of himself throwing footballs past the camera (his team almost won State in 1982) and recruiting Kip to help him sell plastic kitchenware and breast enlargement pills door-to-door.

In between receiving nonstop ridicule and alienation from his classmates, Napoleon spends most of his spare time touting his nunchaku skills, drawing flatulent fantasy creatures, feeding his pet llama Tina scraps of ham, sloppily chugging cranberry juice, testing out a time machine Kip bought online (complete with power crystals) and learning ""flippin' sweet moves"" from an ancient hip-hop dance tape he finds at a thrift store.

Rest assured, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" does have a plot, minimal as it may be. He befriends Mexican transfer student Pedro (Efren Ramirez) and manages his campaign to run for class president against the token popular girl Summer (played by Hillary Duff's sister, Haylie). There's even a love interest for Napoleon named Deb (Tina Majorino), a quirky girl who wears a ponytail on the side of her head and specializes in Glamour Shots photography and making cheap vinyl key chains.

You'll be too busy, however, watching Heder steal every single scene he's in while at the same time, destroying all the clichs of how characters like him are supposed to act. After all, any movie nerd can have a pocket protector and fawn over Gillian Anderson, but how many have ever stuffed tater tots in their pocket or tied fishing line to an action figure and dragged it from a moving school bus? Add to that Heder's throaty, deadpan delivery of lines like ""Are you drinking 1 percent milk because you think you're fat?"" and what you end up with is a new cinematic hero for the Star Trek-quoting, comic book-collecting masses.

Hess' directorial style and dialogue have drawn comparisons to both Wes Anderson's ""Rushmore"" and Todd Solondz's ""Welcome to the Dollhouse."" But his film has indie cred coming from almost every angle and just enough slapstick (including a hilarious cameo by Diedrich Bader as the instructor of his own brand of martial arts, Rex Kwon Do) to distance itself as an extremely original and entertaining movie.

If you want to see this hidden gem of a movie (and I highly recommend you do) you'd better hurry because it's likely to be knocked out of theaters soon by the slew of upcoming blockbusters that, most likely, won't contain any tater tots or llamas.",1097107200,9,3531,4.97457627118644
1563839,5,B00005JNBQ,"When asked what my favorite movie of the year is, it's no contest here. Napolean Dynamite easily surpasses anything that has been out so far, and I'm sure, anything yet to come. The best comedy I've seen since Office Space, I'd say. Any bad reviews are to be ignored. It's one of those films where a plot simply isn't necessary, and you almost forget there isn't one until walking out of the theatre. The humor is so dry and random, not to mention the hilarious elevator music that seems to correspond with the crazy nature of the film. The charactar I most enjoyed was Kip, because his transition from dork to gangster was so enjoyable, and somehow managed to be believeable as well. Just the tone of his voice was enough to keep me in stitches. I also think Summer (Haylee Duff), was especially great to watch on screen in her role. You instantly saw her as every Summer you may have had in your school, and automatically rooted for her demise. Yes, I'd go so far as to say this movie is about to become a cult classic.",1097020800,114,1021,4.407407407407407
