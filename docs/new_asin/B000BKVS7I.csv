8088271,4,B000BKVS7I,"The transfer quality of this Tekila release is decent, but not great.  Darker, shadowy scenes of castle interiors suffer from lack of saturation, and thats a real shame since the sets are as good as anything you would expect to find in this genre.

I still haven't learned to speak spanish, so Im not entirely clear on plot particulars, such as why Dr. Frankenstiens remote-controlled monster is given the likeness of Joaquin Cordero who plays the scientists criminal partner.  Mexican special effects technicians herein achieve the time honored split-screen effect seamlessly, with Cordero playing two different characters in the same scene.

Orlak: The Hell of Frankenstien first came to my attention in the pages of Mad Monsters magazine while I was a kid during the early 60s. [The MM editors concocted their own original gruesome plotline to accompany the photos, as there was apparently no English language pressbook synopsis available].  Some of the violence in this film is disturbing, so I wouldnt recommend it for children.",1434412800,,1033,5.198795180722891
8088272,4,B000BKVS7I,"A suspected murderer named Jaime Rojas, finishing his time in prison for a minor charge, meets a scientist named Dr. Frankenstein and helps him escape from prison.  He plans to use the scientist's creation, an artificial man made from assorted body parts, to avenge himself against the various officials and former partners of real or imagined offences.  The good doctor has only honorable intentions and has no idea of Rojas's actual plans.  The creation, made to look like Rojas, is sent out by him to kill the aforementioned offenders while Rojas always make sure to have an ironclad alibi.  Not bad Spanish-language Mexican-made horror film.  Played completely straight and not a comedy or spoof.  The Tekila Films DVD release is fine quality.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1402790400,3,783,5.0703125
