6230905,5,B00HW3EI3I,"I got to watch this on DVD last night as a early rental and I loved this Tyler Perry production! It was hilarious, touching, powerful and many other things I can't explain! I felt the kids pain the foster mother ensued on them! Tyler does it again with Madea and Madea never gets old for me. The singers were phenomenal in every sense and I hope he turns this into his next Madea movie! You're going to laugh, sing and probably cry! HIGHLY recommended!!!",1397865600,47,454,4.416666666666667
6230906,4,B00HW3EI3I,"It seems the foster mom next door mistreats her kids. This is another play. Madea makes an entry about 30 minutes into the production. This is a 90 minute play extended to 2 hours for the numerous spiritual songs. Good Fun. TP breaks character with a manly laugh.

Pretty much the same old TP stuff. Fun to watch.",1397347200,49,313,4.396551724137931

The play is hilarious but thought provoking and the manner in which Tyler Perry does that is genius.  (Of course if one views it only as a man dressed as a women, they will miss the message in these plays and that is very sad.)",1496361600,,401,4.465753424657534

6231366,4,B00HW3EI3I,"If you don't actually read the title closely you won't see that it says play.  So yes it is a play/ musical.  One of the better ones I've seen although not as creative as Most made a movies.  But there were some very funny parts,  although a very serious movie.  All the characters broke out of their characters many times.  A lot of going off the script on this play.  But it was still a great play and I would recommend watching this.  Just remember it is a musical too so many musical numbers.  But definitely  raises awareness about child abuse.  So please watch this movie",1460073600,,577,4.349056603773585
6231367,5,B00HW3EI3I,"I love this play! The singing is amazing as usually in a TPS production! I always love Madea and Aunt Bam together. The theme was worthy of the recognition Mr. Perry gave it! The flawed foster care system is real, whether unfit adults or youth emancipated out. It also gives us a picture of child protective workers that are sincerely concerned about youth, as well as foster parents who truly have the best interest of the kids in mind. Hopefully, when it comes to children, we will all be nosey, but prayerful neighbors.",1459209600,,522,4.623655913978495

6232093,5,B00HW3EI3I,"Another remarkable Madea play. There is a heart-wrenching story that needs to be told. Tyler Perry tells it well in this play. The idea that adults wreak havoc in the lives of undeserving children is a concept that can be difficult to spend time with. This play sheds light on the issue of child abuse and their abusers. It would be a great vehicle to use to start a conversation about understanding and working through it. There are messages for the abused, the abusers and those who become aware of the abuse. A painful topic softened somewhat with the clueless Aunt Bam and the intuitive Madea. Great play.",1425254400,,609,4.648148148148148

Obviously this guy was playing some baffoon role. The mannerisms were just embarrassing. Lips poking out. Eyes closed. No balance. Spike Lee was right. This is like malt liquor for the masses.,1419638400,,358,4.983333333333333

I expected to see how they were neighbors from hell and see Madea's classic quirky wisdom. I know that plays have less time to develop a deep story line but I just didn't get the correlation between the title and the context of the play. I loved the singing and the acting in general but the play did not measure up to what I am used to from Mr. Perry. If this becomes a series like his other plays, I would love to see how he makes it work. BTW I Love Aunt Bam!",1408060800,,604,4.084033613445378

No ruining the plot, so . . . new people next door (a given), foster mother sent from heaven above, 3 kids with issues. House is located between Aunt Bam & Medea, who isn't home until later in the day. Songs in plenty, Medea raising a ruckus, good old Aunt Bam (kinda nosy).

I was inspired and hopefully it will lift you up, and give you something to think about.  In mostly all of Tyler Perrys movies there is inspiration.  I think that is what matters the most.

I Love Madea. Almost all my friends love Madea.
Oh my gosh!
This movie is hilarious. From beginning to the end. Usually, Tyler Perry's Madea plays and movies are really deep then funny.
Like Dr. Phil deep, which I like from time to time, they always have an inspirational message.
However, this one is light on the issues and the only crying you'll have is by laughing a lot. This movie is the one movie you pop in after an annoying day. I need to buy this movie for myself.:).",1402963200,,702,4.131386861313868

The message is that all children need to be supervised, loved, and protected.  Especially poignant is the fact that the movie and play portray the ongoing struggles of foster children who are often neglected, abused, or just tokens in a game of profit.  Social workers are shown as caring.  Madea, as always, is wonderful.  Tyler Perry brings lessons in life with humor and the enduring lessons of humanity guided by Godly wisdom.",1402358400,,547,5.033333333333333

I don't know why, other than perhaps there never seems to be enough of Madea in them. Maybe I haven't seen all of them? Anyway, I rented this play for my husband and I to watch.

6233594,3,B00HW3EI3I,"Megawatt director, writer and producer Tyler Perry continues to have a tremendously successful career in stage plays, film, and television shows.  More recently, Tyler Perry collaborates with Oprah Winfreys OWN Network producing the popular television drama series, The Haves and the Have Nots.  Tyler Perry draws millions of viewers because of relatable storylines.  Whether a renter or homeowner, have you personally experienced the anguish of challenging neighbors?

Diehard fans can anticipate heaping portions of gospel music and a playful exchange of joviality in Tyler Perrys Madeas Neighbors From Hell (The Play).  Known for her sobering wit, Madea is a Southern matriarch with strong opinions on parenting and family values.  Tyler Perry stars as Madea, teaming up again with busy body town gossip Aunt Bam (Cassi Davis, previously seen in TVs House of Payne).  Although the filming of this staged play was in front of a live audience at the Cobb Center for Performing Arts in Atlanta, GA, the camera angles were focused solely on the stage.  Tyler Perry fans will once again enjoy the spirited music and the capable performers who sing with zeal and conviction.  The lyrics are meaningful and easy to follow along as the story develops.

At first glance, the new neighbors residing next door to Aunt Bam, appear to be an intact family. The foster mother, Ruth, is played by actress Rhonda Davis.  Ruth purports to be employed at the local hospital and personifies a friendly demeanor.  According to Aunt Bam, Ruth is polite but the three foster children are unruly and rude. Actor and singer, Wess Morgan (Laugh to Keep From Crying), convincingly plays one of the committed social workers that wants to safeguard the foster children.  Over time, both Aunt Bam and Madea become suspicious from the frequent visits of social workers at the neighbors home.

When Madea returns from vacation to discover her home has been unlawfully entered, Madea and Aunt Bam skyrocket into a relentless pursuit of the perpetrators.  In the role of Aunt Bam, Cassi Davis is crafty in her portrayal of passive aggressive behavior.  When the plot abruptly shifts from focusing on the adult characters to unveiling the root problems of the troublesome youth, Madeas tough love approach shifts into full throttle.  Eventually, Madea uncovers that the mischievous deeds in the neighborhood are directly linked to Ruths disruptive foster children.

In Neighbors From Hell, Tyler Perry inserts zany humor to ease the sting of addressing touchy subjects like abandonment, abuse and dysfunctional relationships.  Occasionally, Tyler Perry will lose character and burst into laughter. One recurring theme in all of
Tyler Perrys Madea movies is that Madea has an answer for anything and everything.  Buried underneath her tough faade is a caring and concerned heart for all.  While theres no guarantee that Madeas advice or actions are always right, she saves the day by imparting tidbits of wisdom for the neighbors family crisis.  Tyler Perry fans will undoubtedly get the uplifting comedy theyve grown accustomed to.

Tyler Perrys Madeas Neighbors From Hell (The Play) DVD run time is 138 minutes and includes a behind-the-scenes featurette.",1401235200,,3224,5.229571984435798

6233713,4,B00HW3EI3I,"Once again Tyler's gained the upper hand as only Medea can do.  To me Tyler is right up there with Flip Wilson & Geraldine, love them both and would definitely recommend. Quick with the shipping and packaging was protective for the contents.",1400803200,,241,4.738095238095238

6233716,5,B00HW3EI3I,"This message is clearly about abuse and about reporting it. Madea readily admits her shortcomings, but there are others who don't and seek to profit from them.",1400716800,,159,4.925925925925926
6233717,5,B00HW3EI3I,Although I was not able to watch it in its entirety due to mechanical difficulties It was a very good play and I enjoyed it very much looking forward to watching it to the end next time.,1400716800,,186,4.054054054054054

6233781,4,B00HW3EI3I,Great play! It was not as funny as I expected but when Tyler Perry(Madea) laughs at his/her own jokes it's makes it more entertaining!,1400544000,,134,4.625
6233782,5,B00HW3EI3I,"I laughed and I cried.  This a such a great play, and Tyler Perry has a way of getting a point across.  Everyone needs to watch this play.  We also need to get involved when we see something that is not right.  Too many children are getting abused and killed, and most of it would be prevented if we paid attention and report what we see that is not right.",1400544000,,356,4.042857142857143

6233787,5,B00HW3EI3I,I enjoyed the play even though I don't think it was his best by far.  Mr. Perry continues to strive for excellence and still stay true to the many facets of the human condition.,1400457600,,177,4.205882352941177
6233788,4,B00HW3EI3I,"Tyler has one thing that is likeable by anyone and everyone, he is continually giving advice to young kids, to adults and the general public. He injects religious believes that affect those who are watching any of Tyler's movies. It's great the way he depicts the life that is typical of African Americans. He has done a great job. He surrounds himself with singers that you don't find easily. Great singers. Tyler and all his crew, CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!",1400371200,,453,4.896103896103896

6233821,3,B00HW3EI3I,"I thought it was a good story like madea witness protector which is a good story.  This video is just crap talk and no teaching or meaning, can I ship it back to amazon.",1400284800,,169,3.9705882352941178
6233822,3,B00HW3EI3I,"This play was okay; seems it was missing content and meaning. The play seem somewhat rushed, a rewrite would make it better but I understand with plays it has to shorten but it still needs to be executed properly.",1400284800,,213,4.487179487179487
6233823,5,B00HW3EI3I,"Yes, it's Madea, but the story and message are fantastic. This is a DVD of a stage play with music. The cast sings several original numbers--and all are fabulous vocalists. The story covers many social issues--foster children, lying and deceit, abuse, and neglect. However, the final message is that through Jesus all can be made new.
I'd recommend this film to anyone who is working through these issues with teens. Madea uses the word ""hell"" a great deal, but if you can overlook her bad mouth and hear the message, you will enjoy this reproduction of this play by Tyler Perry.",1400284800,,579,4.742574257425742
6233824,3,B00HW3EI3I,"Did not make me laugh at all. I don't know why, I wanted Madea to make me laugh and learn a lesson in the misty of my laughing. I don't know what computer put movie on cd, but the quality  was not 100 percent, which I have found in a lot of his movies. Especially  the one from Walmart. the house of payne just so bad and not getting money back was painful.",1400284800,,357,3.8767123287671232
6233825,3,B00HW3EI3I,"The play was goof for the message it presented about advocating for the proper treatment of foster children. But Tyler Perry is getting so full of himself in the sense that he thinks everything he says and does is funny, when it fact it looks like he's trying too hard to make folks laugh.",1400284800,,289,4.37037037037037
6233826,5,B00HW3EI3I,Good lessons learned. Heartwarming awesome film for family and friends. Very good moral of the story and points of views made. 5 stars tyler!,1400198400,,141,4.916666666666667
6233827,5,B00HW3EI3I,A very good play like always good job Tyler. Everyone should buy this play. Thie storyline is so true we need neighbors like that.,1400198400,,130,4.458333333333333
6233828,5,B00HW3EI3I,"True Tyler Perry style, it makes you laugh and cry while getting the message across. Good work as usual!  I can't wait for next play!!",1400112000,,134,4.36
6233829,4,B00HW3EI3I,"I don't think this was one of his best plays, but due to the important subject matter, I'd highly recommended it.

A neighbor and her three foster children move into a house near Aunt Bam and Madea. The new neighbor fools Aunt Bam into believing she is a caring, churching-going foster parent, but the savvy Madea isn't fooled for a moment. This was like many of Tyler Perry's productions, with a social message attached. I enjoyed it, particularly the three young actors, and other new members of the TP ""team"" never seen before.",1400025600,,530,4.698924731182796
6233830,5,B00HW3EI3I,I love Tyler Perry and this one kept me laughing.  A very serious topic with appropriate laughter along the way.,1400025600,,112,4.6

6233917,5,B00HW3EI3I,Very Funny. I laughed so hard I cried. My teenage son also doubled over with laughter.  Madea and Aunt B.A.M. are at it once again.,1399939200,,131,4.24
6233918,5,B00HW3EI3I,Tyler Perry at his best.  Madea is a hoot to say the least.  The story line really makes you think. Pulls at your heart while laughter brings tears to your eyes.,1399939200,,161,4.161290322580645
6233919,5,B00HW3EI3I,Tyler Perry and his cast is fantastic I love all his Play and his movies if you have not seen his play please buy this !!!!,1399939200,,123,3.769230769230769

6233994,3,B00HW3EI3I,"I purchased this DVD for my mother as a gift, at the age of 80 she really enjoyed it and experienced non stop laughter , as for me it was just ok the message TP was trying to get across was very clear. which I truly respect.",1399680000,,224,3.7872340425531914
6233995,4,B00HW3EI3I,"I love Madea and all TP movies and plays,  but the Plays have too much singing. This was a funny one because Tyler couldn't keep it together and laughed a lot and even in his own voice. Hilarious as always. Love his Movies because they always have a message of the world and God. Wish he did more of them...heck even a ongoing show.  Great play with a strong message...",1399680000,,369,4.257142857142857
6233996,5,B00HW3EI3I,"I have watched this play twice and will be watching it again.  I loved the reality that shows why some people became Foster Parents.  It did move a little slow at first, but even the slow parts were funny.  First the mail man and then Wes Morgan took us to church.  If you didn't know God before, by the end you sure did.  Great play Mr. Perry.",1399593600,2,344,4.074626865671642

6233998,5,B00HW3EI3I,"There wasn't as much singing in this particular play like in the past.  Not to say that I don't like the singing, but sometimes it looks like everybody is going to sing every 10 minutes so you can't stick to the story line.",1399593600,,223,4.186046511627907
6233999,5,B00HW3EI3I,This was a great play to watch. I enjoyed the singing actually it brought me to tears. Maybe I was going through something at the time but it's very touch and uplifting all at the same time. Certainly is one for the collection.,1399593600,,227,4.3023255813953485
6234000,5,B00HW3EI3I,"Tyler Perry is so busy he can't do plays on the road any more, so I guess to keep Madea alive, he does DVDs' and I ain't mad.  I love anything Tyler Perry does and this was just as good.  I recommend this to all Tyler Perry fans!",1399507200,,229,3.75
6234031,5,B00HW3EI3I,Did it again !! Left me wanting more. This seemed more like a skit than a play. Should had been longer and had more than just one story line going on.,1399507200,,150,3.870967741935484
6234032,3,B00HW3EI3I,"not up to his usual standard, Kind of boring at first. Then it picks up after first quarter, then starts being like his usual shows.",1399507200,,132,4.32
6234033,4,B00HW3EI3I,I like all of Tyler Perry's plays. This one was eye opening on what really goes on in foster homes. But there was laughter to lighten up a really serious situation.,1399420800,,164,4.32258064516129
6234034,5,B00HW3EI3I,Great play. Very funny. Tyler knows how to make you laugh. Highly recommend. This is a keeper. Gonna add this to my collection,1399420800,,126,4.521739130434782

get your copy.",1399420800,,262,4.24
6234037,3,B00HW3EI3I,"I thought it would be a movie rather than a play.  However, it has some very funny moments.  Even the characters come out of character laughing.  Nice songs, very good singers and story line is very good.  Just very, very long.  Good to put on if you on a long bus ride.",1399334400,,270,4.115384615384615

6234040,5,B00HW3EI3I,This play is comedy but has depth of meaning. How a neighbor who has never learned how to love cannot give love to anyone else. You can never give what you do not have. It causes soul searching and allows us to see what it really means to love  and also the meaning of neighbor and being community and not being silent but confronting the problems around us and not ignoring the signs that may be all around us prompting us to a problem that may exist. The singing is par excellence! Each song has so much meaning and touches the soul!,1399334400,,535,4.245098039215686
6234141,5,B00HW3EI3I,This play is very inspiring to see because of the content that is shared.  When you pace a child in foster care you expect that child to receive the best of care. The foster parents should be people that love children and want to give them the best life they can offer.  Background checks don't determine the type of person you are on the inside.,1399248000,,346,4.3076923076923075

6234145,5,B00HW3EI3I,"This play was good as always with an excellent theme of child abuse. There are all forms of child abuse and this play brings to light abuse in foster care, which is definitely going on. I like the way Perry and others feel the liberty to laugh when they can't contain it. It truly draws the viewer into the play even more.",1399248000,,322,4.209677419354839
6234146,5,B00HW3EI3I,This play is good for the entire family especially family night. The story line was great. Madea was funny as usual.,1399248000,,116,4.571428571428571

6234149,3,B00HW3EI3I,I've seen most if not all of Tyler Perry plays and movies. I find this just ok. Its still worth watching. I will always support his movies and plays. Madea ia always great but the storyline could have been a little better. I got a bit bored. Great music though.,1399248000,,261,4.24

6234166,5,B00HW3EI3I,"The play was outstanding, it was one of his best plays always has a meaning and a lesson in it.",1398988800,,95,3.8
6234167,3,B00HW3EI3I,"personally i like Tyler Perry but its not as funny after the first couple movies and plays he did, thats my opinion its kinda like Mrs. Doubtfire for black folks with a bust a cap in yo` you no what attitude ,Bought this for my wife because she wanted it not me so much gotta keep the wife happy too...3 stars from me but wife i am sure will love it.",1398902400,,350,3.943661971830986
6234168,5,B00HW3EI3I,Well I like all of Tyler Perry movies and plays.  I was really looking forward to seeing this movie but unfortunately it was delivered but I never got it. perhaps someone stole it out of my yard. Previous movies have been left in the mailbox and seems like this package should have been small enough to fit in the mail box also.,1398902400,,328,4.290322580645161
6234169,4,B00HW3EI3I,I really enjoyed watching Madea's Neighbors From Hell and Madea - is always laugh out loud funny! My 9 year old daughter loved it.,1398902400,,130,4.458333333333333
6234170,5,B00HW3EI3I,As always Tyler Perry delivers a great message to his audience! This is a must see play that has new characters with great vocals.,1398902400,,130,4.458333333333333
6234221,5,B00HW3EI3I,We had not heard of this project until checking out Amazon Fire's request by producer name. A great feature!! Hilariously funny and so true in many instances where it relates to communities. Tyler has  raised the bar again!!,1398902400,,224,4.894736842105263
6234222,5,B00HW3EI3I,Great funny movie with a great message. Will definitely watch again.  Kept us laughing.  Another great Madea Play. Hope it will be made into a movie.,1398816000,,149,4.6923076923076925
6234223,5,B00HW3EI3I,"I really loved the play, this is one of the most powerful plays that he has done so far.  I can' wait for the next play.",1398816000,,120,3.6153846153846154
6234224,4,B00HW3EI3I,I truly enjoyed this play. He took a real life situation and displayed it within his play.  Teaching such a valuable life lesson that the audience should have come away come away from this play knowing that it is everyone responsibility to protect children because they are our future.,1398816000,,285,4.816326530612245
6234225,5,B00HW3EI3I,Great movie haven't been disappointed by Tyler Perry yet!!!! Great family show everyone needs to watch!!!! You won't be able to stop laughing!!!!!,1398816000,,146,5.391304347826087
6234226,5,B00HW3EI3I,"Tyler Perry is always A hit with me as he portrays Madea, I've seen most of his movies, and I laugh every time",1398729600,2,110,3.8260869565217392
6234227,3,B00HW3EI3I,"It was just okay for me, there was a good message as always but some things never change in his plays.",1398729600,,102,3.9047619047619047
6234228,4,B00HW3EI3I,"As expected, Madea's Neighbors from Hell was funny and entertaining. It is high quality and produced well. I am a huge Tyler fan and it was nice to see him work with new actors, especially the young girl that I've seen singing in internet videos. The story line was tough to watch at times as it deals with children that are being mistreated, but these issues should be brought to life to raise awareness. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star was because I feel it would have been perfect had Madea been able to have a stronger role in the story line.",1398729600,5,557,4.214953271028038
6234229,4,B00HW3EI3I,"Good message about foster care. Sadly there is so much of that going on, especially the sexual abuse of girls.",1398729600,,110,4.55
6234230,5,B00HW3EI3I,"Tyler, you did it again!  You brought us back to the first time when you started your wonderful plays.  I was thrilled and I enjoyed every moment.  I can't express to you how grateful I am to you for doing what you do.  Please don't stop!  God wants you to keep going!

I love you and I truly enjoyed this play!  I can't express my appreciation enough!

God Bless You and Keep Them Coming!",1398729600,,389,4.162162162162162
6234261,3,B00HW3EI3I,I think this play wasn't as deep or funny as previous plays . The cast was excellent.  Story line could have been stronger.,1398729600,,123,4.3478260869565215
6234262,5,B00HW3EI3I,"I absolutely love all of that God is doing through Tyler Perry and Im just as excited about his future. I have laughed and cried through every play, movie, and tv sitcom but this particular play had me laughing so hard (Aunt Bam and Madea together are some fools). I cant even end this review without saying the songs of choice, the anointing behind the voices and the words of wisdom blessed my soul. Awesome Job!!!!!",1398729600,,418,4.5131578947368425
6234263,5,B00HW3EI3I,Madea did it again.  This play is sooooo.... funny. Also has very good singing as usual in all of his plays.  This is a must buy.,1398643200,,129,3.923076923076923
6234264,5,B00HW3EI3I,Madea's Neighbors from Hell was yet another amazing play by Tyler Perry! I loved it! Keep em coming Mr. Perry! The play was funny but yet sad at the same time. There's always a message in each of the Tyler Perry plays.,1398643200,,218,4.214285714285714
6234265,5,B00HW3EI3I,"I love Tyler Perry's plays.  This new one is really good and as always, provides a good message, great songs and great acting.  I give it five stars for good laughs, good songs, good acting and a good storyline.  For the first time, Madea doesn't need her gun/guns to save the day.  Cassi Davis is A-one as Aunt Bam.  She'll have you rolling in the aisle.  There's a great message here about foster children and young people who are out on their own without the skills and assistance to take care of themselves.  My mom loves this play so much that she's looked at it twice and I just got it last week.  I rate this play A-one and worth the price, which is very reasonable.",1398643200,,673,4.285714285714286
6234266,4,B00HW3EI3I,"Good play!  Addresses subject matter not usually addressed in mainstream media.  Also, most mainstream media tell story from a different point of view.  Refreshing to hear the other side.

Unsure when produced during the run of the show.  It was quite evident the skills of some actors were not as polished as in some of the other plays.  It was a challenge to get through some scenes when actors were just standing around while only one (1) had dialogue.  Most of the actors did not appear to have synergy.  The ""mailman"" is a keeper--he appears to fit.  Cassi Davis was top notch as usual.",1398643200,,591,4.605769230769231
6234267,5,B00HW3EI3I,Just when you think you have seen all Tyler Perry has to offer he does it again. This play was touching and made me shed a few tears. Anyone that grew up in the system can relate to this play. Excellent job Mr. Perry!!!!!!!,1398643200,,223,4.090909090909091
6234268,2,B00HW3EI3I,"I am a huge Tyler Perry supporter, so when I HEARD that he had another play on DVD, I decided to rent it.  I thought the play would be nice and entertaining. But, it lacks the quality that I've seen in his prior plays. I loved the set and the actors were great singers, but the story line was quite weak. Furthermore, most of the scenes were over the top. I'm glad that I rented it before I purchased it. I'm sure that I will not purchase this one. Sorry",1398643200,,454,4.044444444444444
6234269,5,B00HW3EI3I,"Love Tyler Perry movies very much! There so funny an inspirational, all his movies r a must see!!! Love it",1398643200,,106,4.35

6234341,4,B00HW3EI3I,I like the child actors and I LOVED the mailman!!!! I really felt the sense of fellowship with the music. It gives you an opportunity to reconnect with GOD.,1398556800,,156,4.413793103448276
6234342,5,B00HW3EI3I,Tyler perry movie always has a good meaning behind them with a great laugh and talent to bring it all together! Loved the movie!,1398556800,,128,4.375
6234343,4,B00HW3EI3I,"It was a good play the singing though. I rather see a play without singing and that is any play. No matter what play it is or who it is written, produced or directed by.",1398556800,,169,3.857142857142857

6234346,5,B00HW3EI3I,"I don't really have a dislike on this play. Though its not the only one, its good to see something other than the abused wife  or the cheating boyfriend or girlfriend. It brings an, unseen by most, issue to the forefront.",1398556800,,221,4.390243902439025
6234347,3,B00HW3EI3I,"I liked this play, but it seems to have the same premise as all of madea's plays of course there is funny moments, sad moments and moments that will make you mad.  As always Tyler Perry is hilarious as Madea!",1398470400,,208,4.2
6234348,5,B00HW3EI3I,"Yes! Yes!Yes! The movie is awesome. Very happy
I would recommend to family and friends. This is a DVD collection for years to come",1398470400,,130,4.458333333333333
6234349,5,B00HW3EI3I,"I thought it was another movie, I wasn't paying attention, and now I am so glad. The music and message was
fantastic. Very soulful, heart touching powerful. Thank you! I am so glad I rented this now, the music was great!",1398470400,,220,4.390243902439025
6234350,5,B00HW3EI3I,Very well written and play about the abuse that most children deal with when placed in foster care. a lot of very funny puns but a very serious problem that we have in the world.,1398470400,,178,4.114285714285714

6234362,3,B00HW3EI3I,Only the top two main characters carried the play which were Madea and Aunt Bam. I must say the story line was very good but the other actors not so much. Watch only if you like Aunt Bam and Madea.,1398384000,,197,3.95
6234363,5,B00HW3EI3I,"I thought that this was a really good play. It hit on a big issue (mistreatment of foster children).  Aunt Bam was very funny.  I think she really made the play.  And as always, the music was great.  I was really happy to see that Tyler Perry used children play a vital role in this play.  Overall, good play to watch.",1398297600,15,318,4.147540983606557

6234365,5,B00HW3EI3I,"Tyler always has a meaningful message. His plays capture topics that need to be addressed and ""talked out"". As usual, he incorporates comedy appropriately. This play is another great example of Tyler addressing a subject matter that there is no ""quick fix"" solution; however, the solution comes from  recognizing our own demons, breaking the vicious cycle of abuse, and striving to be better people to ourselves and others we encounter along the way.",1398211200,,450,5.164383561643835
6234366,5,B00HW3EI3I,"Will definitely touch your heart. I laughed, I cried, I was angry,but the play ultimately lifted me up.
You did it again Tyler Perry.",1398211200,,133,4.583333333333333
6234367,5,B00HW3EI3I,"Tyler Perry/Madea is at it again. Bringing a great message, praise and worship to God, and hilarity all at the same time. The man has such a talent from God that no one can match. Get ready to laugh your backside off! I highly recommend watching all of the Madea plays, especially 'Madea Goes to Jail'. While the movies are great, the plays are just so much funnier! Especially when he breaks out of character for a few seconds. Just make sure you go to the bathroom before watching. If you don't, you may have an accident! lol",1398211200,20,527,4.387755102040816
6234368,5,B00HW3EI3I,Thank you for messages Tyler Perry the play was awesome. Please continue to use the character Madea. God bless you in Jesus name.,1398124800,,129,4.6521739130434785

6234370,5,B00HW3EI3I,"Tyler Perry's Madea-themed plays/movies just do not disappoint.  This play, about a foster parent and her foster children moving into Madea's neighborhood, was hilarious.  I enjoyed the music, the acting (Aunt Bam was impressive!), and everything about this production.  People who are looking for high art or some other sophisticated fare, need not look here.  Mr. Perry could do high art if he wanted to.  He is gifted that way.  But here, it is all about the message.  That is why I love it so much.  There is a moral to his story!  He takes full advantage of the gifts God has given to him, and praises God while entertaining us.  Excellent combination!  Black stories, and especially black women, are so underrepresented in American cinema/television, but Tyler Perry, thankfully, is changing all of that.  God bless him.  I wholeheartedly recommend this play and cannot wait for his next production.",1398124800,21,905,4.993288590604027

8636757,5,B00HW3EI3I,I didn't like the caregiver she was so mean all because she was treated the same way like Madea said that should of made her know better because she went through it herself but that real life some people are just out for a paycheck and don't care to become part of the solution instead of part of the problem You're never to old to learn and be taught. Remain teachable is a very important lesson to obtain,1523491200,,406,4.217948717948718
