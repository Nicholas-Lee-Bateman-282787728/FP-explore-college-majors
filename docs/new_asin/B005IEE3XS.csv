8474525,3,B005IEE3XS,"If you have heard about Deeksha (blessing from the One), possibly experienced it in one of the Deeksha gathering which is spreading like wild fire world wide and wondering what's behind all this and who started it. Then these 4 DVDs will provide you more background. Unfortunately, the interviewer-host Arjuna Ardagh was not an enlightened being and wasted a lot of footage in asking inappropriate questions. The ""Ego"" and ""Big American Self"" keep blocking his spiritual development. Arjuna just could not imagine that all is one and everyone is responsible to what is going on. It is like the golden opportunity of producing a living Bhagavad Gita down the drain. There are better footage in YouTube about Deeksha and Sri Bhagavan, Amma Bhagavan. On the otherhand, Sri Bhagavan did shine through in each opportunity, hence the 3 stars.",1332892800,3,836,5.065217391304348
