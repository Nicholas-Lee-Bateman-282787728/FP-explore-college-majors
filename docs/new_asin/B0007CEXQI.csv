8171637,2,B0007CEXQI,"The first movie I viewed in this collection is Private Lies. I couldn't believe how badly edited this movie is. As soon as they start getting to the 'steamy' scenes, after about 15 seconds, (YES SECONDS!!!), the scene is abruptly cut, soundtrack and all.

To add insult to injury, the packaging claims the film is supposed to be 95 min in length, when in actuality this highly edited version is barely over an hour! So, of course we know that over half an hour of adult passion has been cut. What's the point? We all know films of this genre rely on the 'passion' scenes for their appeal - cut those and what's left? And no, in case your wondering, I did NOT have the parental control on my DVD player turned on. Well, needless to say, after viewing this film, I was highly skeptical about the rest of the lot. Fortunately, the other 3 films were slightly better - still very edited, but at least the running times of the movies on the other disk were mostly accurate, and the editing was less obvious. There were also longer 'intimate' scenes in the other films, but nothing much is shown from the waist down. (In one film, only when the subject is swimming underwater do we get to see full frontal). Believe me, as far as skin goes, you can see more on late night cable. The visual quality of the films is inconsistent, ranging from blurry to sharp to grainy, but overall, o.k. And to the films' credit I do give it 2 stars because in spite of the ridiculous amount of editing, the overall package contains more 'skin' then you will find in most erotic films for the money. As far as acting, sadly another mixed bag of some who look like they're trying for an Emmy, and others act like they're reading their lines for the first time. Mellara Gold and Jodie Fisher are great assets to the films' in both acting and beauty. So as long as you keep your expectations low, I recommend them. Otherwise, steer clear.",1130371200,,1911,4.4289772727272725
