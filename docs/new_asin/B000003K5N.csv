8588111,5,B000003K5N,"Besides featuring some of the most effective and creepy images from the TNG series, 'Phantasms' is also one of the very best episodes to focus on Data.  The sixth season of ST: TNG had a number of episodes with dark themes and disturbing images and this show seems to have been created in its aftermath.  In the sixth season's two-parter 'Birthright' Data experienced a surreal vision that turned out to be part of a dream program he had been unaware was installed.  That storyline resurfaces here and is dealt with in much more depth and provides us with a good mystery also.
Since Data's dream program initiated several months ago he has had 111 dreams before experiencing his first nightmare, and a rather unsettling one at that.  Both Geordi and then later Troi tell him it is only natural to occasionally experience fantastic and upsetting images during dreams; that evening however he has a similar disturbing dream and then suddenly finds himself being awakened by Troi, Geordi and Worf because he has overslept - a programming impossibility that further perplexes him.  Data then begins having waking dreams and in a catatonic state attacks Troi, stabbing her right shoulder several times before Riker and Worf fortunately intervene.  Remembering nothing about the incident Data is confined to quarters while a solution is developed; during Troi's recovery in Sick Bay Beverly detects the presence of interphasic creatures feeding on the cellular peptide of humans.  Picard and Geordi deduce that there is a connection between the dreams Data is having and the presence of the alien species.  Using the holodeck to implement Data's dream as a projected image Picard, Geordi and Data find the solution to the problem - with somewhat of an assist from a holographic Sigmund Freud!
The opening sequence to 'Phantasms' is an immediate attention grabber.  The use of the wide-angle lens is a telling tool that informs you instantly of the surreal nature of the episode; the dream sequence that unfolds is quite shocking with Data being literally ripped apart before he bolts wide awake in his quarters.  Each of the following dream sequences gets more horrifying and outrageous causing a sense of trauma within Data.  Though he is unable to experience fear he is acutely aware of his instability and that is conveyed superbly in the scenes where he attempts to either understand or explain his nightmares.  Troi as a cake, Beverly sucking fluid out of Riker's head through a straw, Worf eating cellular peptide cake (with mint frosting), Data having a mid 20th century telephone inside his chest and Sigmund Freud insisting to Picard he should ""Kill zem!  Kill zem all!"" are all truly memorable providing shocks and laughs.  The use of Freud in this episode is inspired even though it does seem he would be out-of-sync with 24th century scientific thought.  The sideline stories dealing with Picard desiring to avoid attending the dreadfully boring Admiral's Ball and Geordi having to gratuitously accept the admiration of a young female ensign come off very well also.  'Phantasms' was one of  four shows to deal primarily with Data during the seventh and final season, the others being 'Inheritance', 'Thine Own Self' and 'Masks'.  In an unusually weak season of TNG these episodes provided a much-needed shot of adrenaline for the series' many discriminating and demanding fans.",1039564800,2,3384,5.055755395683454
8588112,3,B000003K5N,"Data finds himself very worried as he starts experiencing nightmares, but no-one takes his concerns seriously. When a strange discovery threatens the lives of the Enterprise's crew, it seems that Data's dreams may hold the key to saving everyone. But can they figure out what is going on in time?
The director did a good job in bringing a dream-like quality to many of the scenes in this episode, and all the dream imagery played out nicely in the real world. But the scene in the turbolift that was meant to be shocking wasn't half so scary as it should have been, and there were too many unanswered questions. There were some good comic touches in this episode, though, particularly those involving Worf, Data, and Spot.
One final note: Counsellor Troi got it wrong yet again! And I think they all owed Data an apology for not taking him seriously.",1028764800,3,850,4.673333333333333
8588113,5,B000003K5N,"Man!  Data can be downright frightening when he wants to be!  In his dreams, everyone's favorite android cuts a slice out of a cake that looks like Deanna Troi.  Mere hours later, he begins cutting into the REAL Deanna  Troi with a knife--a detached, blank look in his eyes the ENTIRE time!  We  are now entering . . . the Twilight Zone.
As an aside, this episode gives  some indication that Deanna's not a big fan of Sigmund Freud.",944179200,10,432,4.3924050632911396
