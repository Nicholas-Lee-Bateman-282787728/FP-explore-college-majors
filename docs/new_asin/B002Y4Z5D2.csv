Great soloists & orchestra & chorus. Imaginative staging! Great fun all around.",1388361600,,277,4.431372549019608

8384073,5,B002Y4Z5D2,"Voici! Herv Niquet et Le Concert Spirituel traitent des vaches sacres britanniques, Henry Purcell et John Dryden, tandis que John Bull observe constern. Mais en ralit, Matre Dryden n'a gure de rle dans ce spectacle. Le vrai directeur n'est autre que le gnie du thtre britannique moderne, Monty Python. La musique de Henry Purcell n'a jamais sonn ... bien, alors, tellement ... originale! Authentique! Britannique! Et aucun orchestre n'a jamais joui avec plus de brio une performance. Pour ne dire rien au sujet des machinistes! Mais le public? Le public est une bte capricieuse. Peut-tre que les gens sont venus pour quelque chose de grave? Classique? Un concert solennel de style baroque primitif? Si c'est le cas, ils ont eu une mauvaise surprise! C'est le plus outrageusement drle semi-opra jamais produit. Je propose que,  partir de maintenant, tous les opras britanniques devraient tre mis en scne par des ralisateurs et des chanteurs du got franais. Ainsi seraient limines toutes sortes de manires pompeuses.

Pardon my French. It's no better than the English accents of the singers in this uproarious spoof of the incidental music by Henry Purcell for John Dryden's play King Arthur, which incidentally is not included. A bit of a warning: if you can't stand to have great art treated derisively, avoid this DVD at all cost!",1354147200,2,1331,5.073059360730594
8384074,5,B002Y4Z5D2,"King Arthur is a crazy rewriting of English history after the English revolutions to give some kind of a national identity to that United Kingdom that was nothing but the result of successive invasions and constant European strife. Just that is funny today, but that is Dryden's play and we will be deprived of it. We'll just have the musical intermezzi by Henry Purcell. This composer is the typical and main composer of the Restoration and the Glorious Revolution. The theaters were reopened and censorship was going down quite a lot. They will even invent the copyright a couple of decades later. But the play and the subject were not funny at the time. It was dead serious and no one was supposed to laugh at this new version of English history. The Celtic past of England is laughable when we know they were once and for all dominated and colonized by Julius Caesar and that will not change with the invasions of the Angles, the Jutes and the Saxons, and ""marginally"" the Danes, and of course not with the invasion of the Normans. The Celtic language will only survive in the Welsh mountains. To evoke the Bretons as the ancestors of the modern Britishers is a fable and a farce. But to that very long play by Dryden, that so serious subject at the time, Henry Purcell gave some dynamism and some fun. The musical interludes and intermezzi are first of all distractions, entertainments. Niquet with the help of two buffoons, I was going to write baboons, Corinne and Gilles Benizio, turns those musical pieces into a real farce by reinventing some kind of funny dramatic line among them, and the line is what happens to a poor stage manager when he is invaded by a band of lurid en lubricious singers. A few extras are added in front of the curtain just for our pleasure. Niquet goes one iota further by turning the musical pieces into some kind of big feast, more of an orgy actually with two perverted monks and a barbecue. This production is a farce and wants to be a farce. That does not serve the music by Purcell badly, wrongly or well. Purcell's music can be served with any sauce you want, it remains Purcell's music but it makes the whole show so much more like what it probably was: a celebration of dramatic freedom and of dramatic entertainment in those troubled years of the end of the 17th century, after they had nearly been re-colonized by the French of Louis XIV. They will remain Germanic, or Anglo-Saxon if you prefer, for ever. Enjoy the farce. Enjoy the music. Enjoy the show and don't forget the show must go on... go on living not being a putrefied and petrified baroque classic, which it is by the way, but let us de-petrify that composer a little. The question is to know whether Niquet went too far. For me he had a black-out moment at the right time though it would have been funny to see King Arthur in his underwear or even in his under-underwear. But well, I guess the opera in Montpellier is not the Moulin Rouge.

8384075,2,B002Y4Z5D2,"This is the 2nd DVD of Purcell's King Arthur which I've purchased and the 2nd which I'm sorry I did.  The first is a Vienna production conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt and directed by Jurgen Flimm.  The sung portions are in English, but the spoken parts are in German.  At least you can filter out the spoken portions and hear the music without them.

This latest purchase is a French production with sung portions in highly French-accented English and spoken portions in French.  The nonmusic portions in this production are a joke, but a not funny one.  They make no sense at all and have no relationship to the opera other than ""entertaining"" the audience.  (They did not entertain this audience member!)

The orchestra is conducted by Herve Niquet, who comes on stage during an interlude (scene change) to sing some popular song from the White Horse Inn(?).  Once the curtain comes up on a ""forest"" scene,  the audience gets involved in making it more authentic when they are asked to provide forest noises.

The whole mess is a waste of time and money.

My advice - stick to the sound only recordings.

Too bad that I can't get my money back on both DVDs  So much for purchasing anything before it's released and reviewed.",1263513600,15,1228,4.677570093457944
