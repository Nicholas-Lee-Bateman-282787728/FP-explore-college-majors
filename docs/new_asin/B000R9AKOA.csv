2862707,1,B000R9AKOA,"i remember this movie from the 70's
 and really looked forward to seeing it. It's too bad it didn't happen. There was no picture or sound at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.I tried everything.still no luck. I didn't bother to send it back. The price of returning it was more than it was worth too me. Oh well maybe next time.",1307059200,2,317,4.56140350877193

2862709,3,B000R9AKOA,Good Scary movie except for Clint Walker being killed.  He should have had the lead role.,1237507200,4,89,4.5625
2862710,5,B000R9AKOA,"This is a great Movie for the Fans of late 70's early 80's horror. I remembered as a kid it would scared the hell out of me every time i tried to watch it or peek a look. This movie makes you the viewer use your imagination to fill in the blanks it's not a movie based around ""gore"" but more about suspense and eeriness. If your more into 2008 ""gorror"" of the last 10 years, it's really not a movie for you,in other words it's not for the lazy minded

this would be a good remake for the winter season or winter holidays,it would be quite interesting to see if Steven Spielberg or some other high profile director could come up with a decent remake for 2009 or sometime in the near future

there's also another low budgeted,eerie & scary 1978 movie[Canadian made,i think]along the same idea as this but based around ""Sasquatch"" that was also very good....but at a loss for the name",1228953600,8,881,4.333333333333333
2862711,4,B000R9AKOA,"Classic 70's horror movie about an abominable snowman that begins to terrorize a snow resort by killing guests out and about the resort.  The movie is a little slow but if given a chance, it's an ok movie.  You never really see the snowbeast except for it's massive claw or far off shots of it running away but it's all in fun.  Campy but still fun.",1221868800,10,349,4.257575757575758
2862712,5,B000R9AKOA,Great movie.  I like the way that they kept me in suspense that monster had them all all scared for their lives,1403913600,2,111,4.045454545454546
2862713,4,B000R9AKOA,"This is in my opinion: this is for those that enjoy for some unknown reason, to berate the taste of others; forgetting that we are all unique.  Thats why there are a variety of movies a little something for everyone.  I remember watching this movie when I was a child and I enjoyed it then.  I like watching some of the old movies.  Its refreshing to see that there isn't so much filth coming from the actors mouths.  This was a movie that I could enjoy with my young children together as a family.  It has its suspenses and scary moments that we as adults know are coming but our children don't.  They can use their imagination as to what is about to happen (its not all splayed out there for them to see).  If you read reviews that I have written before you know I don't like to give details.  When the suspenseful music comes on, I like to see the light in my kids eyes go on as they start asking questions or trying to guess what is going to happen next.  It makes them think (not be drones, just taking in what they see with no thought).  This is an old movie about a ""Snow Beast"" attacking people at a resort on vacation and as usual the owners wants to keep their heads in the sands about what is going on around them and no one noticing disappearing people.  Its a movie sit back relax and remember the days of before, then discuss how things have changed from then to now with your family.  Its a method we use to bring and keep our family together.  We watch something of our children's and they watch something of ours to laugh and discuss.  But keep in mind the little ones still have an active imagination and can get scared at times while watching the movie (which is the intent of the movie).",1403913600,,1707,4.2253086419753085
2862714,2,B000R9AKOA,I remembered this video from my childhood.....It wasn't as good as I remembered it.  But it was fun to watch as a retro.,1398124800,,120,4.217391304347826
2862715,5,B000R9AKOA,"this is by far better than the remake with John Schneider.  I would recommend it to everyone.
It has it all, and then some.",1388966400,,123,4.125
2862716,4,B000R9AKOA,"Snowbeast effectively uses the monster's point of view, and the soundtrack to creep us out. While a big event is bringing in lots of people to a ski resort, a Sasquatch who has ADD, rampages through the countryside slaughtering people. Pissed off because humans still refuse to believe that he exists and after not inviting him to their assembly, bigfoot presses into the gym window what can only be described as a shaggy BA- scaring and temporarily blinding some children. Before sasquatch can learn anything more degrading from civilization, and because they cannot sue him for sexual harassment, a hunt is planned to eliminate the rude, offensive and psycho ""squatch"". With Bo ""walking tall"" Svenson and Clint ""Cheyenne"" Walker in the same movie together, you'd think there wouldn't be enough room for bigfoot! If you like Night Gallery, the Night Stalker, or most other 70's scary TV movies, all my jokes aside, this is for you. The beautiful Colorado mountains (I think) is where the action takes place. Svenson gives an intense performance as usual and Robert Logan, Walker, and Yvette Mimieux are also good. This Synergy dvd is worse than vhs! Thankfully there are 2 much better alternatives-Retromedia's Sasquatch triple feature collection has a much better picture. Also a pal dvd from Vipco is just as good.",1385769600,3,1317,5.045871559633028
2862717,5,B000R9AKOA,"Essentially the story-line of ""Jaws"" set at a Colorado ski area where a ""Snowbeast"" is killing skiers. Cheesy and bad FX but great scenery and groovy 70's skiing shots filmed on location at a rather new Crested Butte...",1364601600,,219,4.7894736842105265
2862718,3,B000R9AKOA,OK but not great.  The death scene for the monster is could be better and they changed it roar for that scene also.,1360454400,,115,4.0
2862719,3,B000R9AKOA,"Yep it is another formula ""stay in the car"" movie. Everyone sees the creature and does not believe what they see until they get dispatched; then they do not care. Most of the victoms are too clumsy to get away and become creature chow. I am surprised they did not try to make a pet out of it like a stray cat or maybe give it religion so it will change its carnivorous ways.

The underlying themes are how people behave under pressure.  A girl thinks her father is not listening. The father thinks the girl has a rotten attitude. The female scientist thinks everyone is a pansy and armed with a camera will force the beast to say cheese. The third wheel male scientist spouts wisdom and then falls prey to altruistic machoism.

Will they ever learn their lessons or will the beast get fat and die from clogged arteries?",1351900800,,819,4.410596026490066
2862720,1,B000R9AKOA,"This is the 50th anniversary of the annual winter snow carnival, a festive occasion filled with tourists eager to spend their money. The festival includes the reigning Snow Queen as well as the original Snow Queen (Sylvia Sidney). Tony (Robert Logan) manages the resort. Gold Medal Ski champion Gar Seberg (Bo Svenson) shows up looking a job in the skiing industry because former champions have a hard time getting work. He is accompanied by his wife Ellen (Yvette Mimieux) who is so good looking Tony comes on to her in front of Gar.

Meanwhile Jennifer goes missing, the victim of the Colorado Yeti. Not wanting the tourists to leave, the resort is quiet about the incident. The film drags on with little action concentrating on the relationship thing with Tony, Gar, and Ellen. You see very little of the beast, almost like a Soupy Sales ""White Fang.""  There is some killing and blood, but most of the action takes place off camera. Long and boring, not very good camp value to boot.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1351123200,,1031,4.748603351955308
2862721,3,B000R9AKOA,"A feature of made-for-television movies beginning in the 1970s was loading up on B-list and former A-list actors.  The most awarded actor in this 1977 movie is Oscar nominee Sylvia Sidney, who was awesome at the end of her career as Grandma Florence Norris in ""Mars Attacks.""  Bo Svenson, a veteran actor of dozens of movies and television shows, including ""Kill Bill 2"" and ""Heartbreak Ridge,"" plays a former skiing champion looking to redeem himself.  Yvette Mimieux, who I will always remember as Weena in the original, and better, ""The Time Machine,"" as well as Dr. Kate McRae in ""The Black Hole,"" is Svenson's faithful wife.  Robert Logan, who was quite popular in the 1960s and 1970s and starred in a number of films about a family living in the wilderness, is part of the family that runs the ski resort where the snowbeast appears.  Then there is the sheriff, played by Clint Walker, who was the star of ""Cheyenne"" in the late 1950s and early 1960s and had an up and down career appearing in films such as ""Killdozer"" and ""The Dirty Dozen.""

The snowbeast makes an auspicious appearance at the beginning of the movie by attacking, and apparently eating, a beautiful young female skier.  The skier's friend skis away as quickly as possible to try to get help (too late!) and to warn everyone about the monster.

Then follows the stereotypical interlude where no one believes the report of a beast, followed by the realization that there is a beast, especially after the beast appears at a school and breaks a window in the gymnasium.  This scene then sets up the exciting climax where our heroes set off into the wilderness to track down the beast and, with a little luck, kill it.

Sadly, we only get to see brief glimpses of the snowbeast.  On the other hand, since the budget for this movie was likely minimal, keeping the appearance of the snow beast to glimpses was likely a wise and effective move.  It is better to see less of a cheesy costume.  In this movie, the parts we do see are a bit scary.  I loved it when the monster's face appeared in the window, which may have been the scariest scene in the entire movie.

In the monster subgenre of the horror genre, most monsters have ended up in some awful movies.  Somehow, big foot, Yeti and other snow-related beasts seemed, to me, to fare better than most other monsters in that many of the directors of these low-budget films have used their monsters very carefully and effectively.  Such is the case in this movie.  Throughout most of this movie, we see events through the snowbeast's eyes, so we know where it is in relationship to victims as well as hunters.  These scenes often make you want to yell, ""Run!""  We also see partially obscured or brief glimpses of the snow beast that tantalize us while avoiding overexposure of a potentially cheesy costume.

I do have two minor complaints about this movie.  The first is the clich subplots regarding several of our main characters.  One subplot is about a former relationship between two of our heroes before she married another of our heroes.  The other subplot is the need for one of the main characters to find redemption for some supposed failure or psychological issue.  My other complaint is the clich involving how the monster catches victims.  In every case our victims fall, stop, and, in one case, sit, waiting for the monster to amble up and grab them.  When people fight back or run, they generally live.  There is a moral in there somewhere.  On the other hand, if people did not do stupid things, how would the monster eat?

There are not very many movies featuring shaggy creatures running around in the snow and attacking people, so if you enjoy these kinds of movies you have to watch this one.  Even better is that the director handled his monster reasonably well using the ""less is more"" philosophy, though I would have liked to have seen the entire creature at least once.  Even the acting seems better than average for this type of movie, which should hardly be a surprise given the experience of the main characters.  This movie is one that you should consider watching if you have yet to see it.  You may find that you want to keep this one in your library.

Side notes:  The picture and the sound are reasonably good, though not remastered.  I believe this film is in the public domain, so it is unlikely that anyone will remaster it any time soon.

Enjoy!",1345766400,,4400,4.622422680412371
8199533,4,B000R9AKOA,"I thought it was a very good show. I like the shows that you don't see the creature till the end, it makes for more suspense. It's better when there is no build up music when something is about to happen, wait till the last second, it makes it more frightening.",1501372800,,261,4.137254901960785
