8669277,4,B00M0B6M4U,"A GLARING absurdity in this dvd is when Weiss recounted the story of when a wife had asked him ""why?"" her husband was drawn to looking at pornography? He replied with the most outrageous, ridiculously absurd answer: that it was because her husband was looking for and longing for those women's HOLINESS! He will find not in the Bible even the tiniest shred of any teaching which even remotely supports this insanely bizarre idea of his (it really makes one wonder if it came out of a yet-unhealed part of his old sex addict brain). And it makes about as much sense as the following...let's say a person wants to become a physically healthy, trim, and fit person - i.e. 'holy' in his physical body - and in his seeking for this, he seeks out a bag of chips and a soda for breakfast, a large greasy burger and large order of fries for lunch, and dinner is a large greasy pizza...he is seeking all of these foods because he desires the 'holiness' of a healthy, trim, fit body?? This person is seeking 'holiness' in his physical body
as much as a man viewing nude female bodies is seeking a woman's 'holiness.' This idea that he promotes in one part of the dvd is baffling...hmmm, sex addiction is well-known for being baffling and cunning. But overall, this dvd has a good amount of helpful information, as does the book by the same title.",1524960000,,1336,4.502057613168724
