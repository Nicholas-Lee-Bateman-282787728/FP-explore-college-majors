8106379,5,B000E6EHMW,"There's so much to know about Ernest Hemingway and his family - ""Papa"" Hemingway and his rich and courageous life.
I've read at least three books on the family members myself, and found each book to be Better than Fiction. They are so relatable.
Unbeknownst to me at the time, I even lived walking distance from Margaux's modest apartment during her last year. I even briefly attended the church of the minister who officiated at her funeral by the Sea. The Pacific Ocean. It's a small world. She was reportedly incredibly kind.
I was surprised that Ernest didn't bond with F. Scott Fitzgerald and other contemporary writers like we had thought. But no, according to his son Patrick.
Ernest Hemingway went to Cuba eventually, after his divorce from wife No. 2 in Key West, and was very happy there. But he had to leave because of the Cold War. This may have triggered the last Major Depression.
Valerie Hemingway, his daughter-in-law: ""Ernest was tough, very interested in Warfare [he had said All War Is Bad] but very sensitive and shy and helpful and kind. He was taken with the idea of man against nature, man against a force greater than himself, with death being at stake. These are situations which require total concentration - otherwise that's when accidents occur.""
This biography or documentary is unpretentious, direct, not sentimental. Fitting for a Man's man who lived life on his own terms as long as he felt he could.  They help us understand features of his art and craft as Mr. Hemingway had described them. He was SUCH a purest. No one knows where these gifts come from, said his son Patrick.
I will re-read A Farewell To Arms, Movable Feast, For Whom The Bell Tolls, ect. but above all The Old Man and the Sea.

I would have removed the guns from the home though.",1475280000,,1782,4.671974522292993

8106383,5,B000E6EHMW,"I am stunned at some of the negative reviews posted here. I am a longtime member of the Hemingway Society and have read everything by Hemingway and nearly everything about him. Having said that:  I loved this film, loved it. The film caught the spirit of the man and his work.  I show it to students every year and they are mesmerized by it. If you are considering buying this video, I would encourage you to shrug off the negative comments by those who were clearly expecting something of a different nature.",1363392000,6,509,4.521739130434782
8106384,2,B000E6EHMW,"I'm no Hemingway expert, so I watched this for an overview. However, it's not particularly well done, gets off to a very boring start and is handicapped by absolutely nothing from Hemingway himself except some audio of a speech for the Nobel prize. We see bits and pieces from the mostly awful movies made from his books and short stories, but we don't get a good sense of much, except that he was an expert at boiling things down. That we are told repeatedly here. The section on his Cuba years is probably best, and I appreciated the interviews with screenwriter Peter Viertell, but the others interviewed aren't very good, including his son and sister. I'm sure there are better short documentaries out there.",1292716800,2,712,4.75
8106385,2,B000E6EHMW,"If you want your high school students to watch a biography of Ernest Hemingway, do not choose this one.  It will put them to sleep.  I showed it to my freshman and quickly realized the error of my ways.  I have never seen the students so disinterested.  This biography is for viewers who already have a basic knowledge of Hemingway's life and the times in which he lived.  Most of the allusions to other writers and books went over their heads.  Additionally, the mood of the piece is somber and sad--it didn't seem to capture Hemingway's spirit.  Trust me on this one--unless you have a group of serious, mature students who already know the main details of his Hemingway's life, don't buy it for the classroom.",1196208000,8,712,4.603174603174603
8106386,4,B000E6EHMW,"The reason to have this is the interviews -- both those included in the 1 and 1/2 hour film, and in the additional snippets appended afterwards.  A.E. Hotchner, much maligned friend and author of Papa Hemingway, always has new and insightful things to say.  Daughter in law and sometime secretary Valerie Hemingway has genuine insight into EH's aesthetic affinity for bull-fighting.  Patrick Hemingway has his father's directness although a quite different personality.  Peter Viertel was good to see and hear.

Unfortunately the academic commentators, while fine, were a little chatty and did not include anyone from the handful of very top scholars now available.

The treatment is typical PBS post-Ken Burns music/words over pictures montage.  As Chief Dan George said in Little Big Man, sometimes the magic works, and sometimes it doesn't.  The female reading EH manuscript was fine in short, early stuff like the Three Shots opener; being female gave appropriate distance to young Nick's distance.  But it didn't work for later fictions.  The music, sure, will offend some; with me it goes in one ear, out the other; I expect it on TV.  Maybe I shoudn't; as one prior reviewer noted, this can all get crass.  Particularly deplorable is the lone gunshot heard out in the distance as the closer -- bad taste apparently combined with some kind of implicit commentary that a writing career beginning with 3 shots, ending with one, is all about guns.  Or maybe National Propaganda TV means to lecture us on gun control.

Obviously you can't pack EH's work and adventures or complex personality into this amount of time.  Quite a bit of what would help ordinary viewers new to EH (which you have to assume with a film like this) is included.  Main faults though:  (1) over-simplifying the Spanish war to the modern viewer; (2) mindlessly parroting the critical line on many books, particularly Across the River; (3) failing to highlight the divergance between what EH published in later years with the vast, major literary experiments he was undertaking, but which would remain unpublished until his death.  But all in all, the only really critical mis-statement was a minor piece of fluff -- ""EH was the father of film noir.""  The 2 main strengths: (1) highlighting the direct influences of Fitzgerald and Stein; (2) not flinching from personality problems of EH, but putting them in context of his overall emotional sensitivity.

I would give it 3.75 stars.  It is certainly safe for students and an improvement over what has previously been out there, but needs further explication.",1171411200,11,2584,5.0329411764705885
8106387,3,B000E6EHMW,This documentary was a good introduction to Hemingway's life and writing but left a lot out.  I was expecting a more exciting overview of his life than this.  I also didn't like the fact that there was a female voice reading from his work.... it almost felt like I was listening to a female author rather than the beloved Papa.  I would recommend this DVD only to hardcore Hemingway readers who want everything.,1152489600,9,411,4.602739726027397
