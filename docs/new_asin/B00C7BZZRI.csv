5694347,4,B00C7BZZRI,"Despite the blood, guns, and dead bodies in Danny Boyle's Trance, you can't help but get pulled further and further into the film as it kaleidoscopically delves into subplot after subplot. James McAvoy narrates the opening sequence with a smug look on his face, those famous blue eyes gleaming with deceit. His involvement in the plot to steal a 27 million painting soon goes awry, and his business partners (including the suavely menacing Vincent Cassel) direct him to a hypnotherapist in the hopes that she can to help him recover the memory of the lost painting.

Many, if not all, of Danny Boyle's films take on a frame tale character. Slumdog Millionaire, perhaps Boyle's best-known movie, creatively relates the tale of Jamal Malik through an Americanized game show. Question by question, the audience slowly pieces together the narrative of his life. So, too, is Trainspotting filled with simultaneous and contradicting plot developments as a group of heroin addicts (alternately deplorable and hilarity-ensuing) attempt to navigate 1980s Edinburgh. Even 28 Days Later is filled with confusing camera angles and ambiguous characterizations.

Trance, though, perhaps represents the director's ultimate wish to create as mysterious a film as possible. Even the use of color in the film is magnificent-watch for hints of orange, red, and blue throughout. The three main characters play beautifully against each other in what is essentially a game of Russian roulette. And all under hypnosis, of course. Half dream-sequence, have revenge plot, Trance is the slightly better orchestrated version of Side Effects, a film released mere weeks ago by Steven Soderbergh. (Aside: Groups of similar films seem to be released around the same time-do studios purposefully record and release similar versions to see which one fares better? In this case I wish Side Effects and Trance had been released further apart, since each is meritorious enough to stand on its own).

I found myself as mesmerized as McAvoy himself, desperate to sort out the motivations of the hypnotist and the rest of the team. Like all great films, Trance is open to a multiplicity of interpretations about who really did what to whom. Satisfyingly fast-paced, yet unnervingly ambiguous, it is a film that confounds and mesmerizes from beginning to end. And Rosario Dawson's seductively soothing voice will follow you even after you leave the theater wondering, perhaps, if you've been hypnotized yourself.

5694348,5,B00C7BZZRI,"Trance (2013) - James McAvoy, Rosario Dawson, Vincent Cassel

Director: Danny Boyle (Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, Sunshine, Slumdog Millionaire, 28 Days Later, and 127 Hours)

Premise: Simon (James McAvoy) is an employee at an auction house in charge of managing and protecting expensive paintings. When his auction house comes under attack by Franck (Vincent Cassel) and his henchmen, Simon is struck in the head and forgets the location of the painting. After Simon's release from the hospital, Franck is determined to jog his memory - taking him to a professional hypnotist (Rosario Dawson) to recover the painting.

Thoughts: This film is quintessential Danny Boyle - break neck pace, stirring visuals, frenetic style at times and brimming with ambition. The film's story is layered with hypnotic sequences which overlap with real sequences. At times, the film can be a bit murky and confusion, mirroring Simon's own state of confusion after the attack - as the layers of hypnotism take their toll we, the viewer, is left wondering what, if anything, is real and if Simon is being manipulated or simply losing his mind. When the final act begins, the ""reveal"" flips the entire story on its head - changing our perspective but informing the entire journey up to that point.

Should you buy this film: Are you a fan of any of Boyle's previous films? Ambitious, erotic and thoroughly entertaining it is a worthy addition to any collection. On the fence? Give it a rent. But if you're a fan of repeat viewings and intense thrillers, this is a must have.",1366761600,27,1554,4.988416988416988
5694349,4,B00C7BZZRI,"This has been a pretty good year already with twisty psycho-dramas.  Following on the heels of the earlier ""Side Effects,"" Danny Boyle shifts his directing gears from ""127 Hours"" and ""Slumdog Millionaire"" to this confusing thriller.

Simon (James McAvoy) works for a high end auction house that specializes in expensive art.  The real expensive kind.  During an attempted heist headed by Franck (brilliant Vincent Cassel), Simon tries to safeguard the most expensive work, a Goya, but is hit in the head by the butt end of Franck's rifle.  He lands in the hospital and when he recovers, has amnesia regarding the events.

As it turns out Franck and company only got an empty frame.  Franck searches Simon's house and car but comes up empty.  He then tortures poor Simon.  When that doesn't work, they hire a hypnotherapist played by Rosario Dawson in an award-worthy performance.  As a veteran of these type films filled with false leads and premises, I can usually get close to what is going on.  I will admit, I couldn't figure this one out.

Confusion and manipulation is always on the table but I thought Boyle and company had maybe one too many twists.  This film is well acted and visually beautiful.  And then there is Dawson as Elizabeth who shows off her acting skills and plenty more.  And it's all good.",1366588800,24,1314,4.777777777777778
5694350,5,B00C7BZZRI,"Viewed at the cinema, Trance is sure to be awesome on Blu-ray.

Trance is directed by Danny Boyle and adapted to screenplay by John Hodge from Joe Ahearne's film of the same name from 2001. It stars James McAvoy, Vincent Cassel and Rosario Dawson. Music is scored by Rick Smith and cinematography is by Anthony Dod Mantle.

Art auctioneer worker Simon (McAvoy) does the double-cross on Franck (Cassel), his partner in an art heist, but after taking a blow to the head suffers amnesia and can't recall where he has hidden a stolen Goya masterpiece. Franck and his thug side-kicks decide to send Simon to hypnotherapist Elizabeth (Dawson) in the hope of unlocking the painting's hiding place. However, once the therapy starts, secrets come tumbling out and nothing is ever as it at first seems.

Already this early in the day after the film's release, we know for certain that Danny Boyle's foray into neo-noir is going to split his fan base considerably. Admired for his ability to turn his hand at any genre he fancies, Boyle reaches back to his earlier movies and comes up with a mind bending neo-noir that crackles with the kind of sexual edginess that Paul Verhoeven thrived upon. It sounds snobbish I know, and I have been called a neo-noir snob recently, but if all things noir are not your thing then this really is a film you should stay away from. Think Basic Instinct meets Inception and they take out a 40s Heist movie for drinks and you get an idea where we are at with Trance.

All the hallmarks of noir, both neo and conventional classics, are evident here, from characterisations to visual smarts, it's a noir head's dream and very much a must see on the big screen or on Blu-ray formats. Forget any notion of having someone to root for in this, there is scarcely a decent human bone on show. Characters are either fuelled by greed, lust, jealousy or vengeance, or quite simply just not smart enough to operate in the circles they move in. Amnesia is a key component of the story, something which again features a lot in olde noir, as does the central character being a complete dupe...To expand upon more would be stupid of me, the less you know the better it actually is upon first viewing. It really is a difficult film to discuss without delving into why it is such a trippy and deliciously cheeky piece of film. That's not to say that narratively it's smarter than a brain pie, because that's not the case. For as the threads untangle, several times, the mind meld aspect will fall apart if plot dissection is your thing? Also cramming so much ""brain food"" into the last quarter of film kind of feels like too much, overkill if you will. While Franck's side-kick bad boys are irritatingly disposable. Yet it's a film that begs to be seen more than once, twice, thrice even...

Visually it's superlative, it's clear that Boyle and Mantle know and admire noir's visual splendours, with an awareness of atmospheric importance (noir is an atmosphere, not a genre. There's the snob in me again!) pulsing throughout. Set in London but filmed out of Dungeness in Kent, the backdrop is a city of steel and mirrors, a thriving city of wealth and mistrust. The tricks of the trade are here but never once is it style over substance, the visual ticks matter to the narrative. Night time overhead shots of a bustling city come and go, different colour tones for different character's apartments are clever, oblique camera angles ensure distortion of frame is equal to distortion of antagonists/protagonists minds (whose trance is this, really?...). Smudgey silhouettes through bronze glass, outrageous POV shots and caressing camera shots of the human form, no shot is wasted in the name of adding detail. Rest assured, Boyle brings his ""A"" game here. All of which is covered over by Smith's slow rumbling score that acts as a foreboding observer ready to unleash itself when the carnage begins.

The three principal actors come out firing and clearly are enjoying themselves. McAvoy cements his ""A"" list credentials with a multi layered performance, Cassel is as usual a mighty presence and Dawson, in a bold role, does her best work so far and hints she's ready to move into the big league. While it has to be noted that all three actors have to play their cards very close to their chests throughout; and do so admirably. Boyle's action construction is kinetic, with the pre-credits sequence one of the best opening sequences lately, and Hodge's script has a playfulness about it that ensures those paying attention know the film is self-mocking and not taking itself half as seriously as some film fans seem to think. An audience splitter it is sure to be, but for those with a bent for noirish sexy mind bending heist capers? Get in there! 9/10",1365897600,5,4756,4.731001206272618

5694375,4,B00C7BZZRI,"What is unique about this film is the surprises that we do not expect. Everything seems straight forward, but it is not. The James McAvoy character tells us at the outset of the film that nowadays many procedures have been developed by auction houses to assure that expensive paintings are not stolen. We are told what they are. However, when a twenty- seven million five hundred-thousand-dollar painting is auctioned, thieves come to steal it. And it seems that they know how to be successful.
At the last part of the protective procedures, the head thief confronts McAvoy before he can do what he is supposed to do and demands the painting. Despite what McAvoy told us a couple of times, he tries to stop the thief and is hit on the head. He spends time in the hospital. It turns out that he was part of the plot to steal the paintings.
The thieves try to get him to reveal what he did with the painting, to tell them where it is, because it is obvious that he must have done something to hide it. McAvoy agrees that this makes sense, but insists that because he was hit on the head, he cant remember. When the thieves see that torture does not help, they decide to force him to undergo hypnosis, because psychologists say that hypnosis can reveal thoughts that are held in the subconscious. McAvoy agrees, and the film takes still another interesting turn.",1493856000,,1359,4.551020408163265
5694376,5,B00C7BZZRI,"(Contains no ""spoils"") I was curious about James McEvoy & looked at some movies & trailers.  Decided on TRANCE & very, very happy with choice!!!

I had anticipated more of an action/thriller, but TRANCE is even better...more of a psychological suspense!!!  The plot ""almost"" revolves around an art heist, but, don't think...""oh, another 'art heist caper' film"", because it's very far from that.  The art heist itself could almost be another character.

The writing and performances are all masterful!  James McAvoy is the magnetic lead, playing Simon, who stole the painting (I'm not giving anything away here), received a fierce blow to the head from Frank, a wicked bad-ass, very well done by Vincent Cassei, which results in Simon losing his memory of what he did with the painting.  Giving a bewitching & captivating performance is Rosario Dawson, playing the hypnotherapist Simon is brought to, in order to try hypnotherapy to coax & recover his memory, and, therefore, the painting....

This is where TRANCE really begins playing with viewers' minds, teasing and tantalizing us with each step Simon takes!!!  Here's what TRANCE'S plot is really all about...memories: real, ""suggested"" perhaps even false memories & suppressed memory.  This recipe proves deliciously entertaining!!!  For we're taken along on a twisting, turning, taunting, engrossing ride of what's real & what's imagined!!!  While it may sound extremely confusing, the brilliant writer(s) of  TRANCE and the director, Danny Boyle, ""almost"" answer one question at a time during each new scene as it unfolds...(or do they)?!

TRANCE builds & builds the suspense throughout the film, culminating in an invigorating thrill throughout, tying it all together neatly & very satisfyingly for the viewer.  TRANCE is everything & more a psychological suspense should be and it's exceptional!!",1490918400,3,1855,5.370242214532872

This is basically a suspense story, involving the theft of a very valuable piece of art.  The auctioneer, who is knocked out during the theft, is believed to know where the painting actually went, because when the thieves open the packing, only the frame is in it.  Despite some torture and the threat of death, he just doesnt remember what happened after he was knocked out.  So they end up hiring a hypnotist, to see if she can help him recall [they being the thieves].  James McAvoy, who appeared in X-Men First Class, has the lead role as the auctioneer and Rosario Dawson, who appeared in Sin City, is the hypnotist who purely HAPPENS to also be knockout beautiful.  And yes, theres one full-frontal nudity scene with her, which Id have to say was gratuitous, not that Im complaining of course.  This is one of those puzzler films in which the plot keeps twisting and turning, but the main plot device here is hypnosis, so after a while you have to start asking what is real, what is hypnotically induced memory, or just plain fake, and just whose story is it, actually?

5694500,5,B00C7BZZRI,"Well done English production with an international cast.  McAvoy (English), Cassel (French) and Dawson (American) together with a intriguing and original plot is what makes this film interesting to watch.  However, I have to say that I watched better performances  by both McAvoy and Cassel.  It is definitely not McAvoy's and Cassel's best. About the film. This is not a typical heist flick, and it certainly can not be compared to other films that deal with art stealing.  I can not think of any other movie I could compare this one to.  At first the plot might seem very familiar and even clich, but as the movie progresses and reaches its climax it will surprise you. It is nearly impossible to guess the ending, it sort of borderlines with something that Hitchcock would think of.  Those who are interested in hypnosis will probably find something that will interest them.  As for the rest of you, if you like surprise endings, complex stories, and films with multiple protagonists than this film is definitely for you.

Basically the film is about a young and cunning security guard for one of the London's high-end auction houses played by McAvoy.
At the start of the film it seems that he is the main protagonist.  Than we quickly find out that he is mixed up with the wrong kind of people led by Cassel, who lets just say do not believe in honest living and 9 to 5 work.  Soon afterwards, we are introduced to the third main character Dawson, a sexy female psychiatrist who specializes in hypnotherapy.  All three want one thing, and that is a painting worth few million English pounds, but only one of them knows where it is hidden, the problem is---------- he does not remember...",1412121600,,1691,4.694915254237288

5694505,3,B00C7BZZRI,"Three seconds out of 142 minutes of film -- that's the amount of time Rosario Dawson appears full frontal nude.  And believe it or not, it is relevant to the story line.  But the story with all of its unbelievable twists & turns -- especially the ending -- is not worth 142 minutes out of your life.

To follow this movie, you are asked to believe that a British hypnotherapist (Rosario Dawson) can put anyone into a trance and manipulate their subconscious to the point that she can add or subtract memories, and enhance positive personality traits and eliminate negative personality traits, the result being a dramatic change in their conscious personality.  If she had those super powers she would be a multimillionaire.

Throughout the movie, the director tricks the audience.  He often does not let us know if a person is in a trance or not, especially the ending.  In other words, we don't know if a scene is real or the person is dreaming.  Very aggravating and not needed.  The movie would have been more interesting if the director had let us in on the joke.

And speaking of the ending, the plot asks the audience to lower our IQs 50 points.  It is absurdly illogical.  Consider ""Sixth Sense"" with Bruce Willis.  That ending we did not see coming and it was a wonderful surprise.  This ending we did not see coming and is a WTF!

So, if you have 142 free minutes and you are bored, watch this movie.

But of course McAvoy wasn't the only good job in this film...everyone put up a great performance.  Believability....well...I will say that is where this falls short.  I doubt anything like this could happen - particularly the fact that in the movie, the crooks do NOT do poor Simon in early on.

5694512,5,B00C7BZZRI,"Most people who gave this movie a negative review judge this movie on the constraints of reality. The point of a movie is for a director to tell you a story, and take you into the creation they have constructed, for you to enjoy. If you watch this movie with an open mind, it becomes more than just a story, but in my eyes a cinematic masterpiece among the ranks of Skyfall, Les Miserables, Full Metal Jacket, and other films which leave you mesmerized in their depth and scope.

I will not explain the plot; this is not a thriller for those who are into horror. This is a psychoactive thriller; one that has you chasing the plot in ways that you don't see coming. There are many red herrings, and many turns that despite the complexity, are very easy to follow. But you never get the lead on where the plot goes; you are always left in a state of confusion, but not lost. That's a very hard feat for any thriller to pull off, and this movie does it in spades that humiliate so many films that try too hard to either be complex for the sake of complexity, or artsy.

Cinematography wise, this movie was a solid 100%. Color grading and visuals were superb, the sound quality is phenomenal (I believe this movie has a Dolby Atmos mixdown) and the image quality is off the rails. While there was a bit more dutch angle than most films, it was tastefully used. However, the cinematography was just absolutely sublime. I cannot express how much attention to detail with the camera and VFX crew there was.

The acting was absolutely solid. While some B-actors had room for improvement, this is more of me finding fault with something that honestly was still solid. I suspect that my gripe only even comes up because of how phenomenal our three main leads were. I'd liken it to any performance where Judy Dench is placed up against a cast, and everyone else just seems weak compared to her. It's most likely the same phenomenon. The actors had you in their grasp the entire film.

Finally, when the ending arrives, it completely changes the game and leaves you caught in such a cinematic masterpiece of plot that for the first time, I leaped out of my chair, yelling at the screen.

I finished watching it about 14 minutes ago, and I'm coming here to buy a copy on Blu-Ray. This is also going to be my stocking stuffer this holiday season for all of the cinema buffs in my family.",1407715200,,2373,4.43348623853211

5694517,4,B00C7BZZRI,"One of the best modern thriller movies, that combines excitement, sexy, intrigue, mystery, suspense and elegance.  If you enjoy Spellbound ( 1945 Ingrid Bergman in Alfred Hitchcock film ,) American Psycho, Mulholand Dr., A Beautiful Mind, Inception, ( and if you hate ""Memento"" ) then this movie is for you.  It started out as the usual insider art heist, then it gets convoluted into an is-it-a-dream-a-perception-or-reality a psycho thriller...and how all the conflicts get resolved.

Except for Vincent Cassel, the remainder of the casts are newcomers or unknown ( at least to the American general audience like me,) which is a good thing.  Fresh faces are needed to put authenticity in the characters.  Rosario Dawson was perfect for the role.  She is beautiful, professional, sensual, elegant, just absolutely wonderful in this role.  To be a black leading lady in an all white male cast, which is tough to pull off, Rosario was angelical.  James McAvoy's performance was exceptional ( although I'd much like to see Tobey McGuire play this lead role - but Tobey might have to pull off the steamy sexy scenes with another actress to play Elizabeth.  There were some short full frontal female and back male nudity clips - all in good taste.

A beautiful movie shot in London, based on strong foundation of a good story, script writing, casting, is a good get away for American audience who is so used to the NYC and LA scenery.  Even the Blu-ray movie cover poster was captivating.  Somehow, it could have been even better with an alternative conclusion.

It is a great idea for a plot *spoilers* bf/ gf problem and the gf just happens to have the power of hypnosis and uses it to her advantage. The movie was very action packed, filled with complex twists and turns that not only kept me emotionally and mentally captivated but also was very entertaining. The actors were great, the directing was great, plot was great. The movie actually reminded me a bit like inception and those type of movies (ex. vanilla sky). There's also some huge advantages like Rosario dawson being nude (no idea her breasts were so big). After the movie ended I waited for the credits to be over because I kept thinking there was going to be some kind of twist ending or something as in some movies they have something after the credits. But nope nothing. I felt the ending was more than a little disappointing. I like how they unraveled everything. But I was left feeling like james mcavoy's character was the good guy and got screwed. They are basically saying the ends justifies the means and 2 wrongs= a right. I myself enjoyed the movie but would have more if it was a positive/semi positive message. I actually though that she was james and Rosario were playing the criminals or Rosario had them all hypnotized. They could have written the ending so many different ways but again was let down. So turns out james killed a girl he thought was his ex they drive somewhere and she conveniently runs him down while pushing the car conveniently into the river. Come on do something awesome like she yells strawberry and it was just a session trying to find his car keys or something. Or maybe she could have programmed some word for James to shoot himself or whatever but no they had her run him down ...... Where's the creativity ? wheres the rewrites haha. It's amazing how many movies I loved but the end ruins it for me. But that is just what I personally wanted. All in all. Most people should find it entertaining and ""spell binding,"" as it pertains to intriguing the mind. Very exciting and I applaud the good writing(until the ending), actors, and directing.

There are twists upon twists, and multiple levels of reality, memory and dreams going on one right after another.  Sort of like Inception,  but smaller, more intimate, and revolving around a heist.

I can see why some might not like it.  It (intentionally) gets outright confusing for stretches, and there are admittedly few cheats in the logic, though far fewer than most films of this type.  But I had a great time; the energy is high, the photography is excellent (Boyle used multiple types of cameras and color schemes to highlight the different realities), the acting is fun, and I found myself more emotionally involved with the characters and more invested in the outcome than I expected for a head-trip type of film.  One of those rare films where I really had no idea at all how things were going to turn out  the price of a lifetime of watching too many movies!

SLIGHT SPOILERS! Between the science of hypnosis being COMPLETELY misrepresented and used as a blanket excuse for plot holes, the characters all being deplorable sociopaths, and the ending asking us to forgive every evil deed and walk away with a whimsical sense of flirtatious mystery simply because of the gender of the one character, this is the first movie in a while that I was genuinely enraged by. Here is a test I apply occasionally to movies to see if I am being pandered to: If you reverse the gender of every major character and change nothing else, would the protagonist still be a hero or just be a self-serving monster? In this case...monster. And there was ZERO reason for the graphic nature of the nudity in this movie. Now, I don't care if you include some nudity in your movie as long as it serves the story, and in this case the nudity is mostly in service of the story, BUT when you make the scenes so blatant and graphic that it comes across as an EXCUSE to show graphic nudity, you go way past artistic expression and wind up right back on the level of a 70s exploitation film.

This was a truly awful movie with no sense of itself that thought it was smarter and bigger than it was. it comes across as though written by an immature film student with social issues and fetishistic tendencies and no sense of restraint. The movie you see in the previews is better. Just watch the ads for this film and imagine a better story. It'll save you the frustration, time, and cash you'd just wind up wasting on this mess.

It appeared Boyle was going back to his earlier style making something with his visual style present in his earlier works such as Transpotting. Having seen the film, I would say that I found it entertaining, but left me feeling somewhat empty when it was over. The film has a great concept and the first 30 minutes or so is exactly what you'd expect it to be. Unfortunately, it all goes downhill a bit after that. I can't go into exact details without spoiling the film, but lets just say at a certain point you realize the characters actions don't have much effect on anything and the whole film ends up feeling kinda pointless. With that said, Boyle's hyper-visual style gives the viewer enough to keep the viewer entertained and there's always something visually appealing happening on screen to keep you from getting bored.

Overall, would I say that I enjoyed Trance? Yes. Did I find it to be disappointing? You bet! But, it's still a film worth watching for it's unique style that Boyle is known so well for. Just don't expect it to be anything great.",1395187200,,1242,4.594594594594595

5694559,4,B00C7BZZRI,"Taking time off from creating `that' Olympic opening ceremony, Danny Boyle has brought his trademark visual flourish to this heist thriller / psychological thriller.  It's lightweight by Boyle standards, being more mindbending than thought provoking, but succeeds as an entertainment, and will still spark those conversations in the pub afterwards on what works and what doesn't.
It's not a bad thing to go into the movie knowing as little as possible.  Suffice to say it centres on James McAvoy's character Simon, who finds himself at the centre of an art heist.  The thieves headed by Vincent  Cassel soon realise they don't have what they came for and the only person who knows where it is has amnesia - time for hypnotherapist Rosario Dawson to enter the scene.  Thereafter you just have to fasten your seatbelts and stay focussed.
In this sort of thriller that relies more on keeping the audience on their toes as to who did what, the actors are critical in selling the premise, and all three leads are convincing here with McAvoy a revelation, and Dawson revealing.  Basked in a neon world it really is hard to tell what is reality sometimes.. Ultimately, how you will feel about Trance will probably depend on where you sit on the `style' versus `substance' debate.  The substance here is fun, but too clever to be a B movie and not smart enough to be a classic.  There's a bit there in the middle where the activity is frantic but somehow the pace of excitement slacks off.. Style wins the day though, as the pace, visuals and music carry you dizzyingly from one scene to the next, until you're as mesmerised as the hypnotees in the movie.  With an ending that will divide opinion, Boyle has added another singular movie to his filmography, which is well worth a watch.  How many movies have full frontal nudity as a key plot point..?  What will he fit next into his packed schedule..",1392422400,,1892,4.720364741641338

You spend the first half even why this movie's happening until a mid-movie twist begins to clarify why everything was so silly and forced prior to that. But still, sequences drift in and out of continuity and reality, while characters change their morality by the second in the middle of a completely contrived love triangle. There are many supposedly big twists and passionate emotions, but they're all lost in a sea of pseudo-sci-fi psychobabble claptrap.

The quality actors certainly give it their all - Rosario Dawson even goes full-frontal for her commitment - but unfortunately the film is a complete sloppy shamble of undercooked ideas. It wants so hard to be a mind-bending caper, but is really just a confusing jumble of mismatched nonsense.

The movie changes character focus a few times and it's a great hand off to see what other people are up to. The ending fit within the story but was based on a terrible, weak and silly foundation.

There were some bold scene decisions in the film. Those came from left field and started the downward slope that led to the plop of  a finish.

The power balance of characters changes late in the film and that was great, but the way it happened wasn't very good. The name of the film gives it away but that doesn't ruin it. The basis of the film ruins it.

5694590,1,B00C7BZZRI,"I'm usually up for 'mind-bending' movies:Memento, Looper, Spotless Mind - loved them all. What makes them all work is that you're drawn in - you don't understand what's going on, but you WANT to, and you stick with it to see what happens. That's what makes this one different, at least for me: it started off OK, and it was clear from exposition at the beginning that there would be more to the movie than a simple heist. But then, there's some really hard-to-swallow twists that just don't work. I had to quit after the first half or so, I couldn't take it any more.

It's not just that they don't make sense - I'm OK with it not making sense, as long as I feel I need to just go along with it. Some of these twists just seem in service to some show-off-y film-making: the fMRI machine that is available to the crooks and apparently for their private use; the fact that criminals would allow shrink into their group (I didn't watch till the end, but I'm going to guess that there'll be a scooby-doo moment at the end where it's revealed that she master-minded it all). The scene that made me turn it off was where Simon is in the MRI machine thinking he's getting shocked. There's some really wooden dialog, there's no chemistry between any of the characters, and that just piled on top of the overall non-sensicality of it,, and pushed it over the edge for me.

I've read rottentomatoes.com, and many of those who liked it commented on the cinematography, by which I think they mean the sunrises and overal decor. For my money, that's a REALLY minor element in carrying a movie. You want stunning cinematography, check out Top of the Lake, the miniseries set in New Zealand.",1387756800,3,1676,4.491803278688525

The first half seems ridiculously simple and gets a bit draggy; nevertheless, there are some surprising complications later on. This film keeps you guessing who's really on whose side, who's in control and who's being controlled. TRANCE is definitely one of the more intelligent films to come out in recent years. The soundtrack and general mood don't always seem to fit the plot, but they help distinguish the film in the end.

5694598,5,B00C7BZZRI,"From Director Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, Slumdog Millionaire) comes a brilliant crime thriller. With a complex and completely enthralling plot we follow James McAvoy (X-Men: First Class, The Last King of Scotland) as he tries to piece together his fractured memory of an art theft gone wrong. Pushing his fragile hold on reality is Rosario Dawson (Sin City, Rent) who thru sessions of  hypnotherapy attempts to find, for the violent mastermind of the heist, Vincent Cassel (Brotherhood of the Wolf, Black Swan) what went wrong and why, and more importantly where. With heavy Lynchian overtones this is a fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable film that is totally geared towards mature audiences looking for more than explosions, car crashes and giant robots. And I have just watched this film once so far! McAvoy/Dawson/Cassel are all a treat and provide the types of performances necessary as their characters make up probably 90% of this wonderful, dark and surprising masterpiece.",1385337600,,983,5.341935483870968
5694599,3,B00C7BZZRI,"This is an engaging movie.  The acting is brilliant, the plot is complicated, and the effects are attractive.  The psychological twists do leave you wondering what is real and what is not, but the story isn't too hard to follow IMHO.  The twists are unpredictable (save for the fact that the nature of the story lets you know there WILL be twists) and intriguing.

Spoiler alert!

So why only three stars?  Because the characters are TERRIBLE people.  Don't get me wrong, the actors did a fantastic job.  They are supposed to be terrible people.  At the beginning of the film, I liked some of them and distrusted others (as was appropriate for the plot line).  I found James McAvoy's hapless Simon to be particularly endearing.  But as the film progresses and secrets are revealed, you find out those people who seemed to be the 'good guys' aren't so good.  In fact, they aren't good AT ALL.  And I'm not talking about relatively normal people having a dark side or character flaws.  They are just bad people.  By the end of the film, I didn't really like any of them, which it made me hard to care about what happened to any of them.  The last scene of the film involves my two least favorite characters (by that point) having what I guess is supposed to be a sweet, romantic moment--but it really rang sour for me because I'd been rooting against them.

But that might not bother some viewers.  I was raised on a steady Hollywood diet of heroes and happy endings, but I know some people prefer darker characters and darker stories.  If that's you, Trance might be just the movie for you.

Update:
The film stuck with me, I'll give it that.  I wrote the initial review right after watching the film, but I've continued to think about it in the days since.  The more I think about it, the sorrier I feel for McAvoy's Simon and the less I like Dawson's Elizabeth.  The film now feels more a tragedy with a psychological aspect than a thriller for me so, again, if you like dark tragedies, I recommend this film.  If you would prefer a happier ending, maybe not so much.",1385078400,3,2068,4.482573726541555
5694600,5,B00C7BZZRI,"Back to back winners for me by way of the always engaging James McAvoy.

Screened '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Welcome-to-the-Punch/dp/B00CBFB8VW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Welcome to the Punch</a>' not too long ago - great film! Had a sincere blast watching him battle another of my all-time favorite actors, Mark Strong. The two were just fantastic as hardcore opposite numbers in the continual game of cops and robbers.

But this - wow - this was a complete bleeping trip.

Tells the tale of Simon Newton. And Simon is an art house auctioneer. Through his hands passes billions of pounds sterling worth of oil and canvas, pencil and ink, polished stones and ground ancient ceramics. He's the gatekeeper to the treasures of the elite 1%.

Unfortunately, he's also an inveterate gambler. Worse, he's lost money he can never hope to pay back to people who aren't the forgiving type.

A deal is cut. A plan concocted. And a rare Goya painting worth in excess of 25 million pounds is going to be stolen.

Twice.

His plan to double-cross his partners goes off with near perfect results; save for one unexpected event. While making for a good show protecting the artwork - he receives a crushing blow to his cranium. Again, not part of the plan. Now suffering brain damage and traumatic amnesia, Simon honestly cannot remember what the plan was, who he was working for, and most critical for his survival - he has no idea what happened to the painting.

After several long weeks waiting patiently for him to recover, his criminal partners pick him up with malice in their hearts. Understandably, they want the painting and believe this memory loss to be nothing more than an elaborate scam. And they're more than willing to torture him to death if he doesn't come clean. But it soon becomes clear to the boss, this is no act. Their inside man honestly doesn't remember anything. So a new angle of attack is hatched. They're going to hire a hypno-therapist to literally pull that information out of his wrecked brain.

But is this new plan all it seems?

A truly enjoyable film. Outstanding performances built on a wonderfully crooked screenplay - creating a twisted tale that will have even the most jaded of viewers guessing to the very end what and where the truth lies.

No question at all - 5 Stars.

Movie Notes:

- The one weakness to the film, from my perspective alone, was casting Rosario Dawson. Not a favorite actress, I give her credit as she pulls off a performance with conviction and believability. Personally, I would've appreciated seeing someone like Cote de Pablo or Marin Aguilera in that role. But I do understand that doing a full frontal nude scene may have turned away many actresses.",1384732800,,2747,4.945652173913044

5694606,2,B00C7BZZRI,"A gang of armed robbers steals a precious Goya painting from the auction house and runs away. Their perfect plan goes terribly wrong, however, when one of the criminals, who had concealed the painting, lost his memories including the location of where he hid the painting.

Its a good idea for a crime noir, but when a hypnotherapist enters the story, who attempts to help the amnesiac thief remember what he did, the story gets convoluted more than necessary. Without revealing too much about what follows, I can say that the story involves a love romance or two, and a certain characters past.

Also, the film shows us how sometimes some people could do things including crimes, for the most implausible reasons. Danny Boyles thriller, or whatever it is, takes confusion for mystery, and inconsistency for surprise. To bolster the thin storyline, three principal characters played by James McAvoy, Vincent Cassel and Rosario Dawson show their unexpected side. They all sort of change, not out of character development, but simply because the director wants to move on, regardless of the illogicality of their actions.

After all, Trance is a movie directed by Danny Boyle. It has style, and lots of it. I give credit for that. But the rest of the film only shows us that even the great director of Slumdog Millionaire can do almost nothing with this poorly written material.",1383523200,,1376,4.922413793103448

The problem with this film is the script writer and the director didn't know which direction they wish to take their film towards.
It started with a multi-viewpoints robbery with the mean Vincent Cassel trying to force James McAvoy to tell where he stashed the painting by pulling out his nails.  As the film progressed, the Vincent Cassel character lost all his meanness and directions.

5694681,3,B00C7BZZRI,"In Trance, the latest offering by Danny Boyle, the underground world of stolen art is explored as Simon, an art auctioneer, becomes entangled with a group of criminals. After sustaining a head injury which has caused memory loss, he visits Elizabeth, a hypnotherapist, to try to recover the memory of where he has hidden a painting. But things are not as they seem. Who is Elizabeth and what is her relationship to Simon and his band of thugs? I'm not going to spoil it for you, but it's worth a watch to see.

I've always been a Danny Boyle fan, all the way back to the Shallow Grave days (by the way, it's hard to find, but if you can watch it, you should). While Trance isn't as good as Trainspotting or Slumdog Millionaire, it is entertaining. The cast is nearly perfect. James McAvoy is sympathetic as Simon. He does an excellent job of conveying his desperation and fear while being threatened by Vincent Cassel's Franck.

Vincent Cassel was born to play the bad guy, but he demonstrates his range in this film. He plays quite a multi-dimensional character, and his screen presence cannot be ignored.

I'm not a huge Rosario Dawson fan. I find her physical attributes to be distracting. And it's hard not to think that she got the role due to the fact that she is the director's girlfriend. I hate to be cynical, but I can't help but wonder what another actress would have done with this role. And she didn't have the chemistry with McAvoy or Cassel that she needed. She seemed out of place.

The direction was very good, as one would expect from Danny Boyle. It was taut, thrilling, and kept me on the edge of my seat. There were even some surprises along the way.",1377993600,,1671,4.5049504950495045

Rewatched both of them a few times and still like them. The visual style of this is off, too. It looks like a car/perfume/luxury watch commercial, and the framing doesn't help the acting. Rosario Dawson, however is excellent. She commands attention and her smooth delivery is perfect for her character as a hypnotist.

5694687,5,B00C7BZZRI,"Unlike Mullholland Drive or Momento, there is a ultimately only a metaphorical logic here to rely on - at least most certainly in the conclusion with Vincent Cassel's character. If the painting is where it is, certain events must have taken place, yet there is this dream awakening of this same real character in his swimming pool. I'll forgive the film that, if for no other reason the last 60 seconds of the film are unexpected and brilliant. Regarding a certain dichotomy here of 'non-linear logic' versus creative metaphor, this is Dylanesque (as in ""Under the Red Sky""); where disparate points of view are made with no connectivity; perhaps an impressionist painting is more what it is...

Vincent Cassel is awesome; upping his presence from Black Swan and too small a role in the CG Jung movie. He portrays a bad-guy who does what he has to - and not with a heart-of-gold, but with a growing admiration for Dawson's character, which meets its ultimate test at the end of the movie. James McAvoy is equally brilliant, totally drawing you into what you think he is, till a darker side begins to be shown in a really unique manner. McAvoy plays his character with such boyish appeal in the first ten minutes that you VERY QUICKLY find yourself lost and glued in an GREAT opening 15 minutes and in the ""spell"" of a master story-teller. McAvoy's reaction when - under hypnosis - he finds himself seeing all the stolen paintings brought tears to this viewer, especially as he cries out to see the masterpiece by Rembrandt. Great stuff. Rosario Dawson is fantastic and proves you don't have to create the usual Hollywood behaviors to accomplish a truly sexy, mysterious and intelligent female character.

The twists and turns are quick, intelligent and creative; the cinematography and direction of one scene after another were in many cases so well thought-out; even to a small part of the opening, when the thieves are about to see what they got, the scene opens in blur, and quickly sharpens. These kind of metaphors are delightfully mixed in with dream symbolisms and a creative juice that (with the exception of a rape-scene), never sold-out for the quick and easy solution; opting for a rather intriguing climax. While the power of hypnotism may be debated, the central theme of facing oneself; ie. not 'forgetting, repressing, etc' is as new as HS Sullivan 1930's bringing schizophrenics into recovery through 'moments of illumination' or expressed 2000 years ago with ""The Truth Shall Set You Free."" The ending drives this home perfectly in a more personal way.

BIG SPOILER ALERT: Three members of the group silently agree to a rape of the therapist. This act was very surprising as there is absolutely no foreshadowing that these characters, who are about to retrieve a $40,000,000 painting which will make them all millionaires, would nonchalantly agree to rape the woman most responsible for helping them get the painting. It strikes me as a last minute add-on by the movie-makers. They could have offered foreshadowing of the characters lusting after her, with additional jealousy as Cassel's character has sex with her - which would have been useful. They regard the rape with the same aplomb they would ordering a pizza. This did not seem real at all. They needed a way for these characters to be killed, and the movie-makers took an easy way out, looking amateurish in the process.

A couple of technical blunders also annoyed me. Director Danny Boyle is of an age of people who don't readily adapt their thinking to the computer age. I have a degree in Info Technology but most high-school kids could school this very creative Director in these matters here: When the robbery was going on, one hood smashes the monitors in the Hi-Tech/Information Services Security Room. Since the goal of the hood is to apparently somehow disconnect / destroy their security camera apparatus, smashing monitors certainly won't destroy the data one bit, nor will bashing in a single CPU (as he does), as even your local drugstore with the sign saying ""Video Surveillance"" has a redundant off-site connection that is duplicating the digital feed in real-time. A better real-world solution would've been using an electro-magnetic device that will totally zap the hard drive after previously interrupting the off-site backup system; thereby making data recovery impossible; and would have made both the art thieves and the movie-makers appear intelligent rather than ignorant, lazy or arrogant in this regard.

I cant help but think Im NOT THE ONLY ONE - during production - who recognized how silly that is, and perhaps the Director is just too aloof to take suggestions? A shoot the messenger kinda guy? Take for example the shotgun Cassel's character carries: This is ridiculous: a full-length solid stock!?!  A folding ""paratrooper"" (or pistol-grip) stock would take an additional 12-16 inches off its length and would have allowed the character to do the intelligent thing: put the shotgun in the same bag the art satchel is placed in. Then you would have avoided the viewer being forced to believe he's carrying a full-length shotgun down a London Street hiding it while walking.

It kind of reminded me of Guy Richie in ""Snatch;"" where, after directing a great scene beautifully showing the gangster with his .50 cal Desert Eagle compared to his opponents' ""Replicas,"" Richie goes out of his way to show he's never shot a gun in his life, by having 'Bullet-tooth Tony"" shoot this monster weapon using the ghetto twisted-one-hand style, which amusingly guarantees you'll miss your target and sprain your wrist in the attempt. I have personally shot that weapon and know the kick it has. As someone who's been shooting for 50 years, it's laughably amateurish to shoot any handgun in that ghetto manner, no matter how ""cool"" it may look to some; unless you're a movie director.",1377734400,3,5877,4.948328267477204

5694695,2,B00C7BZZRI,"I'm not sure if this is a B movie or not, but it certainly seems like it. The acting wasn't horrible, but just about every other aspect of the movie was poor.",1377475200,,158,3.96875
5694696,3,B00C7BZZRI,"Let me preface this review by stating that the only film Danny Boyle has ever made that I've really enjoyed is 127 HOURS. Everything else has left me pretty cold in one way or another. His films tend to teeter on the precipice of stylized pretentiousness and overblown self-importance. But after a triumpth like 127 HOURS, it was hard for me to pass up another effort from Boyle.

TRANCE, at its very best, kept reminding me of better films thematically, such as Christopher Nolan's INCEPTION and some of the different works of David Cronenberg, such as eXistenZ, SPIDER and even NAKED LUNCH. James Mcavoy essentially plays Ewan McGregor 2.0 here as Simon, a cocky auctioneer at a prestigious London art gallery who is involved in a heist of a multi-million dollar painting, but because of a head injury he suffers at the hands of the ""villain"" of the piece, Franck (a terrific Vincent Cassel), he can't remember where he hid the painting. He goes to a hypno-therapist (the talented and lovely Rosario Dawson), who Simon and Franck believe to have the key to discovering where the painting is. As the film progresses, though, it becomes harder and harder to distinguish between reality and imagination as implanted memories and suggestions begin to swerve through Simon's mind until it comes to an ultimate revelation as to exactly who's the real villain.

Again, if I hadn't seen a few films like this before, and that were done better, I would have had a better time with this film. Boyle does some fine work here as a storyteller who is determined to screw with the mind of the viewer as much as is possible, but he steps maybe too far over the line and gets tripped up by his own cleverness. Cassel and Dawson are captivating as the brutal thief and the innocent therapist caught in a web of deceit and violence, but as with most of his performances, Mcavoy comes off as the weak link of the cast despite him being trusted to carry the film. Mcavoy is not without charm and his baby face keeps the audience a little off-balance through this film, but he just seems to flounder without stronger performers to keep him afloat (just look at him and Michael Fassbender in X-MEN: FIRST CLASS or him and Keira Knightley or Saorise Ronan in ATONEMENT).

TRANCE is a decent enough film, and certainly has some moments that will stay with you... certainly one for the men in the audience, if you get my meaning... but it's a tale often-told and often better.",1377388800,,2453,4.673611111111111

5694711,5,B00C7BZZRI,"This movie is brilliant.  That's not subjective; it is simply a brilliant piece of art.

However... Art appreciation IS a subjective thing.  No matter how brilliant something is, a viewer may hate it.  I, for instance, despise  NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.  Not because it isn't any good; it's fantastic.  I hate it so much because I was enjoying it until the end, then they pulled the carpet out from under my feet -- just to make it more artistic and unexpected -- it eas such a negative ending, I left the theater suicidally depressed.  But that is still one of the best movies I've ever seen.

So back to TRANCE:  It's brilliant AND I enjoyed it very much, so I gave it five stars.  I find it fascinating how most of the people reviewing it give it high marks, but a good percentage really hated it.

Most of the hater's reviews are very subjective -- just gut reactions.  Some recognize it's artistic quality, but hated it anyway.

I'm a writer, so I know how badly an artist wants their work to be universally loved, or at least appreciated for the skill of the artist.  Yet the sad truth is, if you're not the target audience, you will feel left out of this film.

It was written for people like me, people who think deeply and are not easily surprised by stories.  I confess, to having guessed much of what was going on, but Danny Boyle still managed to pull one over on me in small ways anyway.  That made me happy.  I also enjoyed the acting and direction very much.

But if you're just looking for an action flick to munch popcorn to, this is not it.  You will not be able to sit back and switch your brain off if you have any hope of enjoying this film.",1377302400,,1660,4.290322580645161

Excellent work by McAvoy as an apparently easy-going Auctioneer haunted by deadly secrets, and Dawson as a continuously hypnotizing presence on screen (pun intended).  Sound and cinematics complement them beautifully.

Much like Memento, in the end, everything (the main plotline anyway) becomes clear.  There are sequences in the middle that continuously trick the viewer - one must simply sit back and enjoy.

Then James McAvoy's character, who ends up being a character you are intended to hate.  Then you have the Rosario Dawson's character, who's motivations and apparent actions make her extremely easy to hate as well.  I think you're supposed to empathize with her, but I really don't see how.  It's like they wrote the story with absolutely no plan as to where they wanted it to go or what roles they wanted the characters to fill.

The movie is not for a a quick laugh or something to have on in the background. This is a movie that requires thought and concentration and all of your attention. The story is every evolving. You believe one thing is going on, then lead to believe another thing, then another, until the truth finally comes out. This makes the movie fantastic because by the end, you understand the exact same sequence of events, but you understand them for much different reasons.

Overall, this is a thought provoking movie that won't get many laughs, but will leave you in awe at the presentation of a mildly predictable climax. Good guys turn bad, bad guys turn good, and no one at the end is who they seemed at the beginning.

This movie is definitely worth a watch!",1375833600,,1018,4.433155080213904
5694762,5,B00C7BZZRI,"I'm not going to waste time with summaries and critical analyses. Others have posted really good detailed summaries for reference. Movies are entertainment and some people enjoy it, some people don't. That's how the entertainment industry works. Therefore, being critical about this movie isn't relevant. Keeping that in mind, here's my opinion on Trance that might help fellow psychological-thriller junkies like myself decide on watching this.

Albeit the very mixed response, I found this movie well done and enjoyable. The focus was on quality acting along with the intricate script and story, not CGI or mindless action. It was balanced with plot twists at good times and just enough clues for you to develop your own theory on the story while leaving just enough information absent so it's up for interpretation. Psychological thrillers like these (e.g., Looper, Inception, Paprika) are not meant to have a definite ending. They're meant to bend the mind to think abstractly. Trance did just that.

However, here's my advice. In my opinion, Trance is best watched knowing nothing more about it than what the official trailer shows. Remain oblivious to the mixed feedback that's rampant online. Watch this movie relaxed but attentive. Don't become discouraged if you become confused during the movie, and don't delve into deeper thinking until afterwards. Just sit back and let it take you on a journey. I suggest deciding if you liked it, or not, after watching it. If you can't decide, then wait a few days and watch it again.

To me, this movie was a compelling, cinematic, and dark masterpiece. Definitely worth watching at least once.",1375833600,,1644,5.126865671641791

True, the characters in this movie range from deplorable to unlikable, but, once you get yourself comfortable in this range, it shouldn't be too hard to make them relatable. That's what makes this movie a tad bit more complex than the usual hum-drum candy-cane variety.

The cinematography is artsy and texturized. The music is top-notch and atmospheric. The story will keep you on the edge of your seat. The acting is impeccable.

However, if you need a vanilla storyline, this movie is not for you. It is not the edgiest plot out there, but if your cup of tea are movies like the Notebook, please steer clear of this one.

However - (backstory on me) as a child many years ago, my parents would tell me to go to my room when a movie got to 'romantic.'  So I would make up plot lines and endings to these movies as a way to finish the movie.  I still do this to this day when a movie is playing out.

During this movie I came up with numerous endings and while I enjoy a movie beating my own endings, this movie disappointing spins a tale of chaos that when the roulette ball final falls in place... you left with 'seriously? that's it.'

5694794,3,B00C7BZZRI,"The beginning of this film (what you see in the extended preview) is spectacular:  The cinematography, the pace--everything.  I was hooked, and rented the film.  What a let down.  If I can use that expression, since there was little down. Just one audio-visual assault after another.  All made almost unwatchable due to the fact that none of the characters proves likableso who cares what happens to them?

  We began Trance believing that the lead character will be some kind of a hero, but he proves the worst of the worst.  As a person, he is a gambling addict and an abusive boyfriend.  As a thief, he has absolutely no honor and an almost maniacal desire to destroy everyone around him in the most vicious possible way. The hypnotist as a woman-wronged-getting-revenge, well, if she can make everything all right with the acquisition of a painting, that really says it all.  The subject of the painting--witches --is meaningful.  If this film was for real, hypnotists would be ruling the world.

This film really could have been so much more than it is.  Boyle is proving that he loves blind, senseless violence.  Which generally seems to be a growing trend in Film;  all these huge, visually gorgeous, movies with what really should be called torture sceneswhere the level of sheer brutality really isn't warranted.  Think of the bathroom scene in Red Lights. After youve knocked a guy down once, twice, twenty timesdo you need to completely bash his brains in? Or set him on fire?
 The beginning of Trance was notable in showing how much can happen from just one sharp blow to the head.  The operating room scene really showed the impact of trauma on the human body.  So, why do we need all this unrelenting pummeling?  No one can survive all that and keep walking; and yet, we have all these films where people are smashed to bits and still get up, keep walking and even save the day.  Is this sort of thing really what makes for great cinema?  One might argue that this sort of violence raises the audiences stake in the outcome, as it certainly seems to create a desire for it to all endfor relief.

Some have said that Boyle was going for an Inception effect, but Nolan achieved a grandeur with his film that Boyles movie never touches.  With Inception, Nolan generated several character arcs that genuinely move the viewer.  There is a sense of a nobler purpose at play.  We love the characters despite their flaws, and they are able to surf the waves of violence because Inception has heart. Trance has cujones, sure, but very little heart.
 With Slumdog Millionaire, Boyle struck a much better balance of darkness and light and gave us a character to cheer for.  There are flickers in Trance.  The choice of centering this film around works of Art was brilliant and the repeated reference to Rembrandts Storm on the Sea of Galilee with the artists cameo appearance, was a deft touchyou can feel a lot of play with that.  Also, the hypnotic trance scenes are surrealistically intriguing fun. But there is very little fun in the characters, who one by one prove to be rotten at the core.  I mean, come on, Boyle, give us somebody to root for.  And don't expect us to forgive you if you dont, just because everything looks amazing and theres a nice soundtrack.

By the end of this film, and I only kept watching to see how Boyle would pull this maelstrom to conclusion, I didn't like anyone and I really didn't care what happened to any of them.  Except maybe Franck.  Though he had seemed like such a bastard at the films commencement, he was coming from behind in the homestretch.  Give that character another film, who knows, he might prove a hero.",1375056000,,3662,4.64797507788162

in a professional hypnotherapist to extract its whereabouts from the subconscious of its [seemingly] severely-concussed thief.

Much like the hypnotherapy depicted in the film, you're given an outcome, but damned if you know over the course of 100 minutes how you got there.

Visually impressive, sure - he can frame and light a shot really well. And all three of the major performers here - James McAvoy, Rosario Dawson, and Vincent Cassel - do a really good job with the material they've been given. But the story has about five too many twists and double reverses; even diehard noir fans, usually a group who'll put up with a lot, will probably find themselves shaking their heads and saying, ""Oh, COME ON NOW."" And that's even if you're willing to accept the movie's idea that hypnosis is basically one finger-snap or safe-word shy of total mind control. I enjoyed it for a while, but by the end I was a little weary of the constantly shifting loyalties, false memories, fantasies, etc., etc. Basically, this movie attempts to deceive the viewer in every possible way, from beginning to end. And for an hour or so, that's fun. But eventually, after it shifts from a heist movie to a psychological thriller to a tale of long-term (long-con, really) revenge, it all becomes a little too hard to swallow.",1374883200,,1229,4.6422018348623855
5694798,4,B00C7BZZRI,"Danny Boyle (director of 127 Hours, Slumdog Millionaire, Sunshine, Millions, 128 Days Later..., A Life Less Ordinary and Trainspotting) comes up again with a mind-bending, action packed, kaleidoscopic vision of how the mind can be altered/twisted/confused/bent by hypnosis to create out of body experiences that provide clues and solutions to a story of a heist (and love affair) gone wrong. In many ways the film assaults the senses, but the story is so well crafted that it defies rational explanation until the very end.

The setting is London and we are introduced to the fine art of fine art auctions by one Simon Newton (James McAvoy, fully immersed in his native Scottish brogue). Simon teams up with gangster Franck (Vincent Cassel) and his gang (Danny Sapani, Matt Cross, and Wahab Sheikh) in the heist of a valuable Goya painting from the auction house where he works. In the getaway, Simon does not deliver the painting (as so carefully planned) to Franck: Franck hits Simon's head and takes his package. Then Franck discovers that the painting is not in the package and he abducts Simon and tortures him with his gang in an attempt to discover where the painting is. Eventually it becomes evident that Simon's concussion caused amnesia and Franck decides to hire a hypnotherapist to help him to remember where he hid the painting. Franck shows a directory to Simon and he selects the American hypnotherapist Elizabeth Lamb (Rosario Dawson) and they have a hypnosis session. Soon Elizabeth contacts Franck and tells him that she wants to be their partner and receive her share of the painting. The creative thinking Elizabeth has sex with Franck and she tells Franck that Simon is obsessed with her. She also tells him that she believes that he may recall where the painting is if she has sex with Simon. Elizabeth has sex with Simon and hypnotizes him into the beginning of his blurred journey between reality and daydream: `The choice is yours. Do you want to remember or do you want to forget?'

Written by Joe Ahearne and John Hodge the plot is a blur of reality and delusions mixed to a fare-thee-well by Boyle and his cast. Though this is one of Rosario Dawson's better roles, the role of Elizabeth would have been better served by a more subtle actress who could have added another dimension of credibility to this wildly hallucinogenic crime caper. The others in the small cast are excellent. This is an art house movie bumped up to the big screen concept. It requires a lot of thinking from the audience in order for all the twists and turns to fall into place in this immensely entertaining puzzle of mind manipulation Grady Harp, July 13",1374883200,,2659,4.816192560175055

They all evidently have a greater tolerance than I for thin premises (just one of these premises is that hypnosis can access a human mind like the average person can access the Internet) (another one is that a bump to the head causes amnesia--YAWN!)
I tried to stay with this thing, I really did, but by about the 45 minute point, I was so damn bored (and fed up with the ""hypnosis,"" the fantasy sequences, the unbelievable character behavior) that I fast forwarded to what looked like an ""intriguing"" ending that made me glad I had cut out when I did.

5694802,4,B00C7BZZRI,"This was a movie that will take you on a ton of twists and turns throughout. For me, these plot alterations are what make the movie exciting and entertaining. The movie itself though also makes you think somewhat about what is happening and for some it may seem confusing (not for me though). For some that I have spoken to who did see this movie as confusing, I believe that much of it comes from the way that the story is laid out. The movie is not linear and can jump around a bit to set up and take you through the action/events. You simply have to ride this out and go along for the ride, taking everything in and exploring the thrilling mystery that it is.

The actors in this movie gave great performances and truly embodied their roles. They were able to draw me deeper into the story and connect me at a deeper level in regards to what was happening in the movie, just like a good actor should be able to do.

All-in-all this was a movie that I was surprised by, not because I wasn't expecting great things, but I had no expectations going in. I was happily surprised to how solid the movie was and as long as you are able to let go and just go along for the ride, I know you too will find this to be a spellbinding movie also!

Instead, I got a stupid, grotesquely violent mess that wasted its stars' talents. If you like movies that are obnoxious, loud and purposely breakneck speed to avoid having to have a coherent plot, then you'll like this one. Far worse than Slumdog or any of Danny Boyle's early films. Any type of intelligent use and context of the art work that is meant to play a central role in the film?

5694807,4,B00C7BZZRI,"It's not often I'm left unsure of how I feel about something. I think most people much like myself will waver between two opinions--either this movie is needlessly confusing/tedious and the director was just getting off on being clever, or this movie is a fantastic graphic psychological thriller. After having mulled on this for a while though, I've decided that I am in the latter camp.

British director Danny Boyle of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and ""Trainspotting"" has created a world that is both paradoxically grounded in a gritty R rated visual, yet is on a whole different dimension when it comes to the plot and sequencing of events. Much like ""Inception,"" ""Trance"" can be interpreted several different ways. The time frame of events, what is actually real, and who is ""telling"" the story are all subject to discussion. Unlike ""Memento"" where the story is clearly told backwards, it's possible that ""Trance"" is not linear either backwards or forwards. But at the same time, it could be. This is both part of the fun, as well as part of the frustration I felt when watching for the first time.

I tend to gravitate towards mysteries or plot twists that are shocking due to their relationship to the rest of the story, yet ""Trance"" is different. Its plot twists are not something that you can definitively figure out like a good mystery, nor are they related to the story so much as the very method of filming. There was a point while watching the movie though, where I just accepted the complexities and relaxed into enjoying the stylish and dream like narrative though. Strangely, once I let go of forcing things to make sense--the movie actually picked up and I started really noticing details that helped in my understanding.

James McAvoy as the intriguing art auctioneer who comes by a head injury/amnesia, and Rosario Dawson as his hypnotist with ulterior motives absolutely nail their respective roles. Their minute facial expressions and body language are spot on, and really push depth into the script and into their characters. The soundtrack by Rick Smith is appropriately scattered and the electronic edge serves the mood of the movie as well.

At the end of the day, this movie really stuck with me despite having seen it a while ago. While it didn't really effect me emotionally, it was mentally interesting enough that I kept going through the events in my head and wanting to discuss my latest theories with my friends. Visually and musically, it's a feast. I would highly recommend this movie to people who enjoy movies like ""Inception"", ""Memento"" or even ""Donnie Darko."" If you're willing to go along with the ride, that ride can take you places no other movie I've seen this year has been able to do.",1372636800,60,2722,4.834763948497854
5694808,4,B00C7BZZRI,"This movie really could have been better than it was. A fascinating premise seemed to lose steam as the movie progressed and became more and more convoluted. I felt it strayed way off base when Elizabeth wanted her piece of the action from the heisters. To me that was unrealistic. How could a professional woman get the drop on hardened criminals? Well that question is answered by the end of the movie. Unfortunately how we get to that point is where things seemed to go awry.

I was originally going to give this movie a Two oe Three-Star review. I changed my mind when I realized how solid the performances were. A major quibble I have had with the movie is I felt it did not deal enough with the stolen painting itself. Too, how could a corpse lie in the back of a trunk in a metropolis like London nad not be discovered (Smelt)? That being said, I believe this is a movie that needs to be seen twice or thrice in order to be understood.

Rosario Dawson and James McAvoy do a remarkable job in their roles. I've said it before and I'll say it again, Dawson is the most underrated actress in Hollywood. I really wish she would get meatier roles. I've been a fan of hers since Spike Lee's 1998 film called He Got Game. Dawson could be the next Meryl Streep. She's that great of an actress! As Elizabeth she mesmerises the baddies in this movie with her brains shows the power of the mind of a resourceful woman. Elizabeth is not above using her feminine wiles to conquor the hapless lads. In the end we find out just how calculating and manipulative she is.

I give this movie Three and a Half Stars. A more solid script would have had me rate it much higher.

5694809,4,B00C7BZZRI,"I had a tough time deciding whether to give three or four stars to this one...TRANCE is one of those movies I will have to watch at least once more before I truly BEGIN get a handle on it.  I'll tell you this: every time you think you've know where this movie is going it knocks you right on your butt.  It's as twisty and slick a movie as I've seen in quite a while, and I'm not sure that's always good.  Entertaining, yes...but good cinema?  Let's wait until I get that one last look.

As for now, suffice it to say that this is a movie that begins fast and then seldom takes its foot off the throttle.  Art house auctioneer Simon (James McAvoy) is in charge of securing Goya's ""Witches in the Air"" when the alarm goes off: they're being robbed.  Though repeatedly warned to let the thieves have their way - ""No painting is worth your life,"" they say - Simon steps in the way of one burglar and gets hit hard on the forehead for his effort.  He's a bloody mess, and that's only the beginning of it: as he wakes up and staggers away he gets hit by a car.  And that's not all...when the thieves realize the bag containing the framed painting is absent one canvas, they kidnap him and begin a series of exquisitely horrible torture methods to force the painting's location out of him.

The only problem is Simon's initial head injury was so serious that he's developed amnesia, and a top flight and - natch - extremely sexy psychologist Elizabeth (Rosario Dawson) is brought in to tackle it.  But she's a sharp cookie and quickly realizes she might be able to make a little more than her flat fee if she strikes a deal with the burglars - that is, especially with their boss, Frank (Vincent Cassel), who may or may not be a boob. And it is from here on in that, as the saying goes, mayhem ensues.

And that was the straightforward part.  The problem here is that it's a Danny Boyle film, so it's all Zip Zap Kerflammy quick editing, and it's almost impossible to get your footing. It's entertaining and extremely watchable, but the problem is that it's very hard to believe what you're seeing. There are times you'll see characters die, but then they're back again the next scene. Or the painting's found, but then it's actually a body. Relationships may or may not exist between two characters, and assumptions made about this person or that person are just as well likely to be true as they are likely to be false: this is a PSYCHOLOGICAL movie, you see, and the mind plays funny tricks.  And just when you are about to cry foul, you realize that it's not reality that's changed, but only the character's perception of it.

It's a tricky movie, slickly shot and edited and patched together, but it is an altogether watchable movie....just don't expect to know what's going on all the time.  I wasn't even really sure who the protagonist was after a while: the movie's change of perceptions allows for at least three different characters to wear that crown.  The problem is there is really no one to root for in this movie...they're all one variation or another of creepy, and no one here is admirable.  I heard one critic call it a nihilistic movie, and the term fits: there is really nothing here to ""value"" other than being the character to come out on top.  There is no evidence of any real morality, and not a shred of a code of ethics...unless one's ethics consists of being the last one standing with the painting.

Like I said, I'll reserve final judgement for my next and perhaps final viewing.  For all of my nattering negativism, the movie is slick and fun to watch.  And it has an ending that I am sure many will dislike, but I thought was entirely appropriate, given the last one hundred minutes.

But as for right now...hand on my heart, I'll tell you this: you could do a lot worse than watch this film: it is fun, fast, and a total mind fracture.  I enjoyed it... I'm just not entirely sure what ""it"" was.",1368316800,3,3921,4.421418636995828
5694810,4,B00C7BZZRI,"Simon (James McAvoy) is an art auctioneer who participates as the inside man in an art heist. He double crosses his partners and hides the painting himself. However, due to a nasty bump on the head he gets amnesia and forgets where he stashed the painting. After some unsuccessful torture, his partners in crime take him to see hypnotherapist Elizabeth Lamb (Rosario Dawson) as a way to restore his memory. Elizabeth quickly figures out these guys are the art thieves and wants a piece of the action when they recover the painting.

Now at this point the plot develops layers. People go in and out of trances and see things and you try to figure out what is real and not real. This film is a crime/mystery/thriller/drama that keeps you thinking. Franck (Vincent Cassel) is the ring leader and wants the painting. Worth a view.
