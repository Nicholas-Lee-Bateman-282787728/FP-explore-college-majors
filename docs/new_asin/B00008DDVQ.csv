1839379,5,B00008DDVQ,"I love this work out. I love Barbra she explains things so wonderful. It's a tough workout but you will definatley FEEL it the next day! You're not bouncing around a pumping up a sweat but you are using muscles that you never knew existed! I use this dvd as well as aerobics so I do both tapes one for cardio and the Lotte Berk method for toning, elongation, as well as definition! If you want a tough work out that you will feel and get results? Then this one is for you Barbra explains things so wonderfully.",1073865600,6,510,4.214285714285714
1839380,1,B00008DDVQ,"I own dozens of DVD workout videos ranging from pilates, yoga, aerobics, kickboxing, strength training, weight training, etc.  This was by far one of the worst videos ever owned and wish could return!  The program was over before I realized it!  The moves are redundant, short, and ineffective.  Don't waste your MONEY!",1073001600,9,319,5.076923076923077
1839381,5,B00008DDVQ,"I LOVE this vid! It's so much fun to work out to (Barbara is an excellent instructor, I love her little ""I don't mean to be a nag, but...""), and really effective too. I've been belly dancing for over twelve years now, so my thigh muscles are pretty developed from that, plus hula for the last year, and these exercises still feel like they work your legs. I also do Pilates to give me some calm workout time, so I guess I'm already in good shape. Now for more critical analysis:
1. Warm-up: Knee-chest lifts. This seems to be the primary Lotte Berk warm-up, and it does get your blood pumping if you've been sitting all day. Not bad.
2. Upper body: The tricep extension is the only one that felt like it did anything for my upper arms, to be perfectly honest, but I lift weights so my biceps are pretty well-developed as is. Still, for someone who does this as their only workout, I think it should give you enough to get definition.
3. Lower body: If you don't already have strong thigh muscles, this will give 'em to you! Definitely strengthening.
4. Knee Dancing: This wasn't much for me, if you've ever done floorwork in belly dancing you'll think this is easy, but I liked the segment anyway.
5. Shape by stretch. Nice ending to the workout, and like the instructors say, don't skip the stretch section!
Overall this video is worth the money. I quite enjoyed it and will keep going with it. I'm easily bored but I love doing this workout. And like I said, I love the instructor. Good video! Buy it!",1069977600,20,1503,4.410071942446043
1839382,4,B00008DDVQ,"Like any exercise, if you don't focus, this workout can be pretty easy (if you're already in reasonable shape--if not, prepare to sweat and quiver!).  But if you really establish your foundation like the instructor says (on this one and all the Lotte Berk DVDs), you'll know full well why dancers look like willow trees--you're working those muscles harder than you have ever done before.  I'm a big yoga exerciser and tried Pilates for a few years, but I get bored with Pilates since all my instructors take themselves so SERIOUSLY as if it were some dictatorial, overly pious religion.  Lotte Berk's method is simply more FUN.  You work like a dog and, by doing the regular program and adding the ""bonus blast"" program you'll be shaking...a good thing.  Really pay attention to how they tell you to set up, just like you would in yoga and Pilates, and you'll protect your joints, spine, and truly get the most out of these exercises.  If you just go through the motions, you'll not get much out of it.  Try it...the Method is a great complement to running or your other exercise.  If this is your only exercise, do it every day instead of once or twice a week, and you'll see a big difference within a few weeks.  Really!",1064016000,72,1223,4.573394495412844
1839383,4,B00008DDVQ,"This DVD has some great exercises.  They do lots of stretching and some fun, interesting strength exercises.  This DVD is great for people that are not used to strength training.  It is a little too expensive, but I think Ill probably order a secong dvd because the excercises are so effective!  If you follow the instructor, you will really challenge your muscles.  The instructor seems a bit tough, but she helps you push yourself.  Great DVD for motivation.  It is not a total body workout but you will work your thighs, triceps and your abs and butt a little bit.",1058227200,5,567,4.61
1839384,4,B00008DDVQ,"I liked this workout quite a bit. It's different than anything else I've done; sort of like a ballet workout.  The instructor gives clear, complete instructions, though she does tend to yell at you at a couple of points.  You really do have to hang in there though, because some of these moves are *tough*!  For the areas that it is targeting, it is a terrific, low-impact workout that you will definitely feel. I do wish, as someone else mentioned, that it included more than just a legs and arms workout. Guess you have to buy the other Lottie Berk tapes for that. I do recommend this DVD, though it is a bit pricey. See if you can get a deal on the whole set, and you'll have a fun, challenging, complete workout.",1058227200,8,716,4.368421052631579

1839419,4,B00008DDVQ,"Although dated now, I have been doing the Lotte Berk Method of exercises for years and continue to benefit from them. This one, Muscle Eats Fat, is for beginners but is NOT for people with weak or bad knees because a lot of pressure is put on the knees.

However,  it is still an exceptional workout that is non traditional in every way yet incorporates some barre, some ballet, and some Pilates into the workout. It seems at first almost too easy. You don't huff and puff or contort into a pretzel. You do very small pulses generally with your legs slightly bent. When I first started doing this workout, I laughed because it didn't really feel like I was doing much. But the next day, I wasn't laughing. I was sore.

After that, I started doing this workout three times a week and my lower body toned up very quickly. I stopped doing the workout in favor of other more contemporary workouts but found my way back to it in the past year or so and I still love it. It works my entire lower body as well as core and it's almost soothing to do as compared to the high intensity workouts that I am used to. This workout doesn't really do a lot for the arms but it hits the glutes, thighs, calves, waist area, and helps with balance and discipline.

Dancers used this method many years ago and still do to this day incorporated with more contemporary exercises. The goal is long, lean muscles rather than bulk. It's a not a workout everyone will enjoy or need but I think it's pretty awesome. I like that there is a girl in the back who does modified versions of the exercises and another who does more extreme versions. The instructor is not at all what you would expect but an older woman who has been teaching the Lotte Berk Method for many years. She's tough as nails though and shows people that you don't have to be 22 years old to be strong, lean, and in shape. I am now 50 and have enjoyed this workout for many years and it never gets old for me. I am slim but want more muscle which is why I am back to doing this and other workouts after switching to mostly cardio work. My lung power is great but I don't feel like I have enough muscle so I am back to callanetics, Pilates, some yoga, and workouts such as this which challenge the tiny muscles as well as the larger ones.

You need more than this workout for an all around good exercise program but, for strengthening and toning the legs and butt, this method works and it works fast if you stick to it. If you have bad knees though, even the modifications may be too tough and could cause you pain.",1444521600,11,2557,4.263917525773196

1839421,2,B00008DDVQ,"This workout depends on you being able to keep your knees bent practically the whole time, while exercising, stretching, etc.  Unfortunately, bending my knees at all is painful, let alone putting stress on them while bent and trying to stay that way for 20 mins or so.  Otherwise the exercises are very easy (so easy not really a workout).  I would not recommend this product to a friend, especially if they have knee issues!",1442102400,,425,4.716216216216216

1839449,5,B00008DDVQ,"I've been taking barre classes at a local fitness studio 3 times a week for the past few months. Due to scheduling and the ongoing cost, I decided to try some videos at home. I like the Lotte Berk videos, this one in particular, because they are similar to the style of class I was taking. I wish they were a bit longer (this is about 30 minutes, the classes I take are and hour). You spend a good deal of time getting into position (VERY important with these types of exercises) but do very few reps. I do wish there was a bit more of each exercise because I'm used to the motto ""shake to change"" where you work your muscles to exhaustion take a little break and join back in the class to push out a few more reps. I do feel a burn with this DVD though, which is great.

The components of the workout are:
- warm up (swinging arms with leg lifts),
- upper body weight series (you need a set of 1-3lb weights) and some planks,
- lower body (a few plies with diamond legs),
- knee dancing (sometimes called thigh dancing - they don't do very good job showing the details of proper positioning, you want to keep your back straight and your seat over your heels)
- stretch (pretty standard, on the floor)
In addition to weights and something for balance (like a chair or bar), you'll need a mat if you work out on a hard surface since you are on the floor for some of the exercises and stretches.

Overall, this is a good bar workout to up into the rotation.",1382054400,6,1455,4.174377224199288
1839450,2,B00008DDVQ,"I was very excited to receive this DVD but after a few times through it I just couldn't put it back on again. It is great core work and isolation of parts especially the pelvic area & quads, but it has 2 major faults. First of all it is published by Journey's and there is a VERY LONG commercial at the beginning of the DVD that you can NOT forward through so there you sit ready to workout and have to watch the whole thing every time every day. Second; As I was listening to the instructor I couldn't help thinking she was sounding ""seductive""? and it was kind of creeping me out. The positive messages were supposed to be inspiring and challenging but the direct eye contact was also very intimate and again just a bit creepy for a workout video. I don't recommend this video when there are so many others to choose from.",1381363200,8,824,4.288461538461538
1839451,5,B00008DDVQ,"The Lotte Berk method really gets the job done, although I'd hoped that some of the exercises flashed in the beginning of the video would have been included.... they're ones that were obviously taken from belly dancing.

1839455,4,B00008DDVQ,"This is a good supplement to your workout. I run and lift weights , so I didnt' feel anything later, but totally different muscle work than what i am used to. It's slightly challenging, I found it was best after at least 10 minutes on treadmill.
I wanted to trim down- after years of weightlifting i am larger than i'd liek to be so I wanted to maintain tone while losing some inches. This seems to be working- positive reviews from my husband!

1839476,3,B00008DDVQ,"I tried it, but maybe I'm just too out of shape for this one. The positions are hard for me to balance and the series jumps from one position to another so I have to pause it so that I can prepare myself for the following position or to get a chair or a mat.

I work out twice a day after I wake up and right before bed....I know that this is a good investment along with changing bad eating habits.  I love the sweat and the feeling of the ""burn"".

1839480,5,B00008DDVQ,"I don't have much time to workout as a single parent who's also going to school.  I wouldn't call it a ""total body workout"", but it does work out your lower body, arms, and some core (with the plank exercises).  It's a mix of Pilates, barre, and stretching.  What I love about it is that I get a good workout in a short amount of time and I feel very relaxed afterwards.. from all the streching.  Cardio-wise, it makes you sweat, but your not drenched or anything.  From the Lotte Berk Series, I 've tried ""Muscle Eats Fat"" and ""High Round Assets""... and I love them both!  I would highly recommend this video to someone who wants to tone muscle and get a nice stretch.. all in under half an hour!!",1300492800,6,698,4.290076335877862
1839481,5,B00008DDVQ,"I have a large frame and while it's fairly easy for me to put on muscle, I tend to bulk up when I work out (particularly my legs). This is the first workout I have ever done that has the opposite effect- I am getting stronger and longer and it's happening very quickly.  Almost daily I notice a difference in the mirror and in how my clothes fit, and my posture is phenomenal.  I usually do my cardio workout first so that my muscles are already warmed up before I do this, which gives me more flexibility and prevents soreness after. I highly recommend this workout for anyone who wants a strong, lean body.",1265155200,12,608,4.324561403508772
1839482,5,B00008DDVQ,"All 4 of the Lotte Berk dvd's are worth their weight in gold.  Though they're aimed at beginners, I've been using them for over 2 years now, and still get superb results.  That's because the toning work is isometric, so you can continue to work harder as you get stronger.  Also, you get better at positioning, and understanding how to make the exercises work, thus giving better results.  I also enjoy the fact that the workout is only 30 min long.

This is the only one in the set that begins with light weights for the upper body, rather than push-ups & tricep dips. so on days when my wrists are bothering me, I chose this one.  If you have any foot issues, wear shoes during the first part of the workout until you've completed the planks -- you'll be up on the toes of one foot while you raise the other foot.

The instructor in this one is the ""elder statesman"" of the group, and does a great job.  She says she's close to 50, and she looks terrific.  She's personally engaging and precise in her instruction.  Both workout and instructor get an A++++++++.",1245542400,29,1063,4.4051282051282055

However, she moves too quickly through the sets and talks too much. She doesn't do as good a job of setting up the exercises as the other instructors. Also, you will need a set of hand weights (or substitute 1-pound cans of food the way I do) to do the bicep curls and arm work. The first time, I did not use any weights, and I felt nothing at all. I give this workout only 3 stars because Barb rushes through it, and because it has no ab workout and no push-ups.",1229385600,,611,4.016393442622951

1839516,2,B00008DDVQ,"Honestly, if you've done The Bar Method DVD series, then this DVD is not that great in comparison.

I like the technique that the instructor is using, which is why I bought the DVD. Unforunately, The Bar Method is a superior set. The Bar Method has a longer run time, similar challenging excercises, and I find the instructor more tolerable.

This instructor seemed to be a bit arrogant.

Anyway, if you are choosing between this and The Bar Method series, I'd go with the TBM. I might use this DVD to add variety to another short workout though.",1184889600,4,546,4.551020408163265
1839517,5,B00008DDVQ,"MUSCLE EATS FAT is a no-nonsense, full-body workout led by Barbara Boolukos, one of four Lotte Berk instructors who appear on the four DVDs available.  Barbara is my favorite because she is in her late forties and hardly looks any older than her twenty-something counterparts.  Barbara is beautifully sculpted, strong, agile, and amazingly flexible.  She says on the tape she is nearly 50, had a bone density test that showed she ""didn't have a trace"" of osteoporosis, and has been practicing the Lotte Berk Method for 21 years.  She is a testament to what a woman in reasonably good health and without serious physical limitations can look like if she eats sensibly and consistently follows this program.  The Lotte Berk Method features 30 minute workouts that combine the best of Pilates, yoga, anaerobic resistance training, ballet moves, and physical therapy exercises.  I look forward to using this DVD over and over.",1183939200,17,922,5.072847682119205

I am planning on purchasing other Lotte Berk DVD's based on my success of this one.  It is motivating and you want to do the routine and any DVD that motivates you to use it is GREAT!!!!  It just the right amount of time for a beginner too, not to long or hard, but you definitely get results.",1172188800,8,470,3.9157894736842107
1839521,4,B00008DDVQ,"For anyone who is already familiar with other similar exercise methods such as Callanetics and The Bar Method, the movements of these exercises will be familiar. As others have stated, the exercises of the Lotte Berk Method mostly consists of small, controlled and precise movements, isometic holds and pulses, which not only look easier than they are, but actually become more challenging as one progresses, or better masters their form. Each exercise is also followed by deep stretching.

This video is about half an hour long, and while there are a total of four Lotte Berk Method DVDs that can also be purched as boxed set, all of the DVDs focus on either one or two areas of the body. ""Lotte Berk Method: Muscle Eats Fat"" focuses on the upper and lower body, but does not include an abdominal-only workout (even though you do engage your abs throughout the entire workout). This means that these workouts should either be combined or alternated with, unlike the two very similar Bar Method DVDs, which each offer a total body workout. As for the instructors, my feelings about them were very neutral. Sure, they do seem a bit stiff and even come off as somewhat snobbish, although their personalities do kind of compliment the workout.

Overall, I think ""Muscle Eats Fat"" is a beneficial workout for beginner to intermediate exercisers, and like The Bar ""Method: Designer Sculpting"" DVD, you'll also use light dumbells for the upper body portions. Recommended.",1169078400,12,1465,4.951219512195122
1839522,5,B00008DDVQ,"The instructor is likable, and explains the movements well.  The DVD is broken into five segements.

The warmup is the typical Lotte Berk warmup, with the high marching with swinging arms type step, etc.

Upper Body uses light to moderate weights (I would not recommend heavy weights with this due to the movement of the rotator cuff), for bicep curls, static movements, and bringing the weights just off the thigh to above the head, while keeping the arm relatively straight.

Lower body uses barwork, and a series of controlled, ballet inspired squats, both facing the bar and at an angle.

Knee dancing is as it sounds--from a kneeling position, moving the hips left to right, front to back, and in a circle.

Shape by Stretch is an integral part of the Lotte Berk program, and is a series of intense stretches.

In the extras, is an intense bonus blast, which is a series of harder exercises based off of the ones in the previous workout, along with the ability to do the workout without narration.

I like to alternate this one, Lotte Berk Hip Hugger Abs, and also Callanetics, and I really do notice a difference in the shape of my body.

Please note, with the ""shape by stretch,"" these are done to decrease the amount of bulk one would get in their muscles, so if you are looking to create cuts or cording in the body, or to bulk up, these are the antithesis--they create firm, streamlined muscles, but will not give you the ""bulging biceps when my arms are at rest"" look.",1167177600,10,1479,4.571969696969697
1839523,5,B00008DDVQ,"Hey, I was skeptical, I'll admit it.  I bought this on amazon in January and didn't begin to use it until about March.  Well, I take that back, I think I used it twice in February and then didn't do anything for the next few weeks. Ok, first here's the boring history of my body: My size has fluctuated from a 6/8 to 8/10/12.  Currently I'm around 120 at 5'2"". I have this odd condition called PCOS and in essence my body gains weight very easily, worsening the condition and then making it even harder to lose the weight. (""insulin resistence"" it's called.) Anyway, I'm also short and have the bulky leg look.  It's very hard for me to work out and trim the thigh area because I tend to build up muscle in the thighs very easily.  Over the past year I've been on spironolactone which has helped me with my condition and controls the weight gain problem.  Before I was on medication, I worked out RELIGIOUSLY with all kinds of cardio work such as step aerobics using the Firm videos, Taebo w/ Mr. Banks, running, weights, etc.  (I do have a point I'm getting to...) Over the past years after graduating college and settling into a marriage and job I quit working out. Since the meds helped me control my weight I didn't see the need to squeeze work out sessions in.  Part of this excuse of mine was due to my body not taking extra-hard cardio workouts as good as it did when I was in my teens/early twenties.  Taebo began to cause my feet great pain (flat feet...thanks Dad.) and running, even on a treadmill, jarred my back too much.  I would join a gym to lift weights for toning and then never use the weight machines because the gym would be too crowded or I'd find some other reason to put it off. Within the past year I discovered I had a bulging disc in my back and have been told not to do jarring exercise but to walk instead.  Walking on the treadmill was too boring for me so I used my back problem as an excuse not to do anything.

I was in a dressing room last night and saw my once-curvy muscled arse shimmering like jello under the harsh dressing room lights and I didn't like it.  I knew I needed to get toned but in a low-impact way, and money spent on gym memberships for weights was a waste for me.  So, I went home and popped the dvd back in last night and completed the work-out for the third time in a LONG time. It's not very long (30 min) and it is so low-impact you perform it without shoes.  (I recommend gripper socks if you're on a hard floor) It doesn't seem possible that you would get results from something so low impact but even the very next day you will feel a difference.  Also, the workout can be performed at night with no worries of a rev up feeling that would prevent you from falling asleep.  I love to use this after work since the toning and stretching seem to help me unwind from the day. If you do have back or knee problems, doing these exercises incorrectly and rushed may injure you further.  Take your time and don't think that just because you're not sweating you need to push it.  The last time I did this I got stupid one night and did the advanced bonus workout after the regular one because I thought the first one wasn't hard enough.  This caused me great pain the next day and that was another contributing factor to me not doing the workout again until recently. Trust me, you will feel an effect after the first workout. There is quite a bit of stretching involved.  DO stretch because lengthening of the muscles is one of the most important aspects of this workout.  During the stretching session my legs are usually so shaky from the work out that it is hard to tell when I'm forcing the stretch so I really work hard on trying to not mimic the stretches of the instructors.  They are experienced dances and LIMBER doesn't even begin to cover it.  They're like female Stretch Armstrongs.  I think you will be pleased with this workout.  Some of the movements seem very awkward to set up at first so I had my husband watch me from a side view during set up while he watched the instructor on the video so he could correct my form where needed.  Once you get a feel of it from repetition the moves/positions don't seem that strange.  I'm really enjoying this dvd and can't wait to use the high round assets dvd. (this is a great workout to do in combination with swimming/walking for those of you, like msyelf, who need more cardio but require low impact) It is really helping to shape my thighs, butt, and abs without adding bulk to the thigh area.",1146614400,27,4507,4.31435349940688
1839524,4,B00008DDVQ,"I've been trying this exercise for a few times already. I can't see any results yet, maybe because I don't follow any diets as well. But it is worth to practice these exercises at home. It seems to help you to strenghten and slim down your body. It's not too much but you can feel you have done some workout if you have a busy schedule. However, i found it's too short (less than 40mins) so I have to add another aerobic activities in to complete my own daily workout.",1140998400,5,468,4.211111111111111
1839525,4,B00008DDVQ,"I have a short attention span. Period.  After twenty minutes, I'm in my own world.  I adore Callanetics, but the workout is an hour long and one's mind (namely mine) starts to go elsewhere.

The Lotte Berk Method is extremely effective, and after two weeks I noticed a difference in my strength and ability in my own dance.  When added to the others in the series, it's an excellent workout.  It may not seem like much at first, but if you TRULY concentrate on what you're doing, tucking, and holding that stomach in, in perfect form, it's amazing what this video can do.

I recommend the DVD version due to the blast at the end.

The only thing that prevented me from giving this 5 stars is that there should be a little bit more of a safety warning about knee dancing, as well as an alternative for those who may have had previous knee or thigh injury.",1125446400,18,854,4.367088607594937
1839536,5,B00008DDVQ,"I really like this workout. It's pretty effective. She's very good at explaining what she wants. The emphasis on stretching is really nice. The workout's not terribly long (30 min?) It feels pretty reasonable. There's no real aerobic component. Lots of weights/toning and stretching.

The instructor is very good. My favorite part is when she says (in this serious guru-diva voice): Stretching is NOT relaxation... Its's elongation. Cracks me up! But I'm easily amused.

One small warning:

If you have knee problems, this might not be the video for you. Most of the exercises have an obvious dance like origin. If you can't comfortably bend your knees, you won't be able to do the lower body section, and if you can't sit on your heels (legs completely bent at the knees), you won't be able to do the Hip Dancing(?) section. This being said, I have somewhat sensitive knees; the instructor talks about how not to injure one's knees when she's doing the lower body excercises; and I've suffered no ill effects.

All in all: I love this workout, and I'm considering buying more of this type.",1122681600,21,1090,4.81283422459893
1839537,4,B00008DDVQ,"We all know who the irreverent Lotte Berk was and that she designed these deceptively simple work-outs to help herself get back into shape after a paralyzing car accident. Lydia Bach brought the Method to the U.S. where other programs were spun off (Callanetics, The Bar Method, Core Fusion, etc) These are the originals and these gals are serious about sculpting and reshaping your body. I know there are a few comments regarding snob appeal and snootiness but I honestly did not detect any of that from the instructors. They seem genuinely involved and invested in getting you to understand the Method and do it correctly. Not all of the instructors appear comfortable as background exercisers but each as the lead instructor is absolutely confident in what she's doing.

So. Having babbled all that, here we go. (I do tend to compare them to The Bar Method and that instructor Burr Leonard, which is where *I* started so indulge me.)

These workouts are approximately 30 minutes each and the time  flew. You are working hard right away. There is no easing in.

Muscle Eats Fat is led by the most advanced instructor, Barbara. She is 49 and incredibly strong and shapely. Her waist must be 16"" honestly. Really.

There were a couple of exercises you know from Bar Method and Callanetics, such as the tuck work at the barre; however, the instructor really explains what she's doing and why what you're doing is important. She also explains why the stretch after each exercise is crucial. While Burr has us gently tucking while doing the arm exercises, this chick has you intensely tucking while each time, asking you to bend your knees and lower yourself a few more inches with each set. So you are tucking, holding hard and periodically dipping a bit lower ALL THE WHILE working the arms with weights. They're light weights but by the second set, you're trembling and shaking (and taking her name in vain, lol)

The only issue I had here (and what prevented me from giving her five full stars) is the commentary during the arm work. She wasn't on beat while she was counting and some of her ""encouragement"" was distracting. You grow accustomed to it and after a while it doesn't bother anymore at all. Her personality does grow on you because you can tell that she really wants you to understand what you're doing and why so that you do it properly and don't waste time. She gives more reminders than Burr and she points out where you should be feeling the work. But initially, to be honest, you just wish she'd shut up so you can scream and curse in peace.

There is an exercise called The Plank (and if you do Yoga, you're already very familiar with it but in Yoga, you go down much lower and hold just an inch off the ground.) and what makes it so difficult is that you're lifting the opposite leg and raising and lowering it while keeping your abs pulled in and your weight balanced on your arms. It looks like a full-blown push-up but you're on your forearms rather than your hands. Very challenging, very tough, very effective.

The knee dancing, according to the instructor, is the key to the workout. It seemed very challenging and did make me laugh, unlike Burr's knee dancing and marshmallow punching. I didn't initally like sitting on my heels and this bothered me at first but by the third set, I was pretty well stretched and it actually was kind of fun. Now (I've been doing Lotte Berk since 5.13.05) I can sit easily on my heels and I'm far more flexible now. I can do the knee dancing easily. I'm still winded and grateful for the respites but I don't think I'm going to fall over the way I did at first.

The stretches, she reminds you are not for relaxation but for elongation and you do stretch each and every time. There are three instructors and one does a modification for beginners. This workout was exhausting but in a completely relaxed and gratifying way. You understand what I mean, lol. You feel as if you have worked every muscle in your body but you're strangely calmed and refreshed at the same time. Not sure how they accomplish this mind/body/spirit relaxation and serene reaction to the workout but they do it marvelously.

The Bonus Blasts are kick-your-bum tough. In *all* of them, particularly this one.

I've changed my body to the point at which people in my office are asking me what I'm doing. They don't want to do the work, though. People always expect a quick fix and when I explain the workout, I can see the disappointment in their eyes. BUT, if I'd known how difficult these exercises were initially, I wouldn't have done it either. But I'm glad that I didn't know because this program is outstanding. What Burr Leonard began in The Bar Method, this program finishes with a lithe and strong body. My goal is Labor Day and I know I'll be in my tiny goal size because I've already dropped to an 8 (I'm 5'9"").

I wholeheartedly give it a thumbs up. BUT be warned: it's tough, it's challenging and you will work very hard. But the body you create is well worth it. I promise.",1121126400,100,5020,4.577951002227172
1839538,1,B00008DDVQ,"I got this DVD after reading many reviews on the Lotte Berke Method. I love to find DVDs that have challening and unique moves for toning. However, I was very disappointed with this video. I did not find it challening at all and the ""knee dancing"" segment is dangerous because it puts too much pressure on your knee caps. And also, I found the instructor to be extremely annoying.  Do not waste you money on this DVD when there are so many other great ones out there. See the rest of my reviews.....PS - The Bar Method, which is supposedly based on the same concepts as Lotte Berk -  is a MUCH better workout.",1116288000,18,609,4.333333333333333
1839539,4,B00008DDVQ,"I found Lotte Berk by accident and thought I'd give it a try.  I really like the format.  There are three ""demonstrators"" showing advanced, intermediate, and beginner variations.  The workout goes very quickly as the exercises are very concentrated and there aren't a lot of reps.  They are very effective and do work I have found.",1114646400,19,331,4.857142857142857
1839540,4,B00008DDVQ,"The Lotte Berke Method is a non-traditional type of toning developed by a dancer of the same name. It emphasizes the creation of long, lean (not bulky) muscles through the use of small, precise movements, and it has inspired similar methods such as Callanetics and The Bar Method; this particular video is very similar to TBM Designer Sculpting.

In MUSCLE EATS FAT, the focus is on whole-body toning. The workout begins with a warm-up, a type of high-legged marching in place, and includes simple stretches. The first section targets the arms using light weights. The movement are similar to traditional toning (eg, bicep curls and tricep extensions) but are made unique by both the preciseness of each movement as well as the use of the ""Lotte Berk tuck,"" an isometric stance which works the legs while working the upper body. The arm section finishes on the floor with some tough plank moves which also work the buttocks.

The leg work comes next; although the moves are displayed using a ballet barre, a sturdy, high-backed chair works fine. These exercises clearly derive from ballet and really target the thigh muscles. Again, the Lotte Berk tuck is used to increase the work on both the legs and the hip area. The final exercises for the lower body are done on a mat using the signature Lotte Berk movement, Knee Dancing--again, you will really FEEL this in your thighs. The workout ends with a final stretch, although in the Lotte Berk Method, stretches are also woven throughout following each strength move.

The video is led by three Lotte Berk certified instructors. The main instructor, Barbara, looks amazing for her age, which she says is close to 50. She's a bit goofy in her comments (eg, repeatedly saying ""did you feel that?"" and ""I love this workout!""), but she provides good information and cuing. The remaining two instructors do not speak, but one shows modifications. The Lotte Berk Method is great for all exercisers who are looking for a different but challenging strength workout, including those at a beginning level; for full-body toning, this is a very good workout.",1110844800,96,2096,4.898591549295775
1839541,3,B00008DDVQ,"The premise of this video is building and lengthening your muscles to increase your metabolism even while at rest, and providing definition to your body. I agree with the other reviewers in that this video is what you make it, and it WILL work your legs. I can see why the title includes ""For beginners,"" tho, as I am intermediate/advanced and found it a little below my level.

This 30 minute toning workout is broken down into three sections: (warmup first, then) upper body, lower body, and floor dancing (their ""signature"" move). The workout ends with a good stretch and can be increased to 40 minutes if you do the bonus workout included in the ""special features"" menu. The exercises are unique and work the legs quite a bit but the arms are left a little neglected. The few bicep curls can be modified for your level by using appropriate weights but I still needed to add some pushups to feel I had really worked them. One of the nice things about this video is stress put on the purpose of flexibility to lengthen your muscles as you develop them.

Having a sturdy piece of furniture handy is essential, and a mat/towel/carpeting is also necessary.

This isn't one I will do regularly but will occasionally use to shake up my routine a little.",1110844800,5,1250,4.596412556053812

1839544,5,B00008DDVQ,"After working out with ""Muscle Eats Fat"" trainer Barbara Boolukos every other day for several months, I wholeheartedly support her claim. By pairing this DVD with ""Lotte Berk: Hiphugger Abs"" and exercising with one of two aerobic dance videos on most other days, I have toned and streamlined my body. The results are not extremely drastic, but I'm satisfied, and I definitely feel better, even if I don't look like a completely different person. As a reference point, I wasn't out of shape or flabby at all before I started the regimen, but I knew I wasn't as healthy and strong as I could be. I don't want big, bulging muscles, so the Lotte Berk Method is perfect for me, since it creates long, lean muscles. I convinced myself that I didn't have enough time to exercise during the last few hectic months of this school year, so I went on a Lotte Berk hiatus (the workouts are only about thirty minutes each, though, so I was really just being lazy). I started up again about two weeks ago, and I can really notice a difference between my body with and without Lotte Berk, which goes to show how fast and effective the workout is. Aside from the wonderful results, the program itself is enjoyable and not at all tedious, thanks to Barbara's energy and charisma as well as to the uniqueness of the exercises. I love the Lotte Berk Method so much, that I hope to someday take a lesson in person from Barbara or one of the other trainers at the Lotte Berk studio in New York City where the DVD was filmed.",1086220800,10,1503,4.469090909090909
