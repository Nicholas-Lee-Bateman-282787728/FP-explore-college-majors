8397828,4,B003J3JUOM,"Nearly all of the Alfred's PLAY series books  (e.g Acoustic Guitar 1,2, Rock Guitar 1,2, 3, Jazz Guitar 1,2,3, etc.) come in two product versions -- DVD only and DVD+Book.

For any given title, like this ""PLAY Guitar Basics"", the DVD content is identical, including a digital .pdf version of the paper manual.

The only difference is the DVD+Book version comes with a glossy printed paper manual (in addition to the DVD).

Therefore if you like a printed version of the manual buy the DVD+Book  version.  If you don't mind printing out your own manual (or looking at it electronically) buy the DVD only version.",1388966400,,611,4.771428571428571
