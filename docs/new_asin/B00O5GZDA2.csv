6724870,5,B00O5GZDA2,"In this brilliant film, Judith B. Shields, the writer and producer of Frankenstein's Monster  takes Frankenstein in a steampunk direction, bringing the monster to life by steam. As it's mentioned in Shelley's Frankenstein, Victor studied many types of science, it is plausible for him to have used steam to reanimate the Monster. That's a minor difference with the film and Mary Shelley's book. It is a wonderful difference as it adds steampunk elements to the film which I love and also updates the story to a modern audience.

Aside from the light steampunk elements, I have to say this film is the closest movie adaptation I've ever seen to the tone and feel of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. The film focusses on the drama and emotion of this incredible story as did the book, rather than the horror monster angle. I give this film the highest honor I possibly can by saying Mary Shelley would be proud. I highly recommend the film Frankenstein's Monster.",1423180800,6,956,4.858895705521473
6724871,5,B00O5GZDA2,This film shot in the Houston/Galveston area for a low budget film is entertaining and engaging.  I especially recommend it for anyone who wants to see a real classic with a steampunk twist !,1423094400,4,191,4.617647058823529
6724872,5,B00O5GZDA2,Good movie for very tiny budget movie. It doesnt have a fast Hollywood-style action action but tells an original story of Victor Frankenstein and his creation.,1419206400,,159,5.153846153846154
6724873,1,B00O5GZDA2,The filmmakers took one of the great classic works of 'speculative fiction' and turned it into something that I can only describe visually and dramatically boring.  I have seen several adaptations of the 'Frankenstein' story; this is the only one that I found unwatchable.,1472947200,,272,5.181818181818182

6724876,1,B00O5GZDA2,Terrible! Even worse then people say. At least they tried.,1453852800,,58,4.9
6724877,5,B00O5GZDA2,In some cases ridiculous... (like i like it...) but a blast to watch - loved it,1430265600,,79,4.0
6724878,4,B00O5GZDA2,"Bottom Line:  It may not win any Oscars, but I highly suggest it for classrooms and libraries that want a visual companion for the novel. It will likely keep younger viewers attention better than a recorded play thanks to its score and sweeping artistic landscape shots.

6724879,4,B00O5GZDA2,I first saw this movie being screened at the Gulf Coast Mensa Regional Gathering in 2014.  I was amazed at the quality of cinematography produced with such a low-budget. This is proof that you don't have to spend big bucks to make a good film.,1423353600,,243,4.4
6724880,5,B00O5GZDA2,"I got a chance to watch this at ApolloCon in Houston last year and really enjoyed it. It was clearly a ""project of the heart"" by everyone involved. Not perfect, but for me, that added to its charm.",1423267200,,197,4.2105263157894735
6724881,5,B00O5GZDA2,"Great movie, excellent acting, directing, the whole thing.  The closest adaption to the original book I've ever seen.",1423180800,,117,5.5
6724882,4,B00O5GZDA2,"Considering their budget, the crew did remarkably well.  We enjoyed the movie.",1423180800,,78,5.5
8682281,5,B00O5GZDA2,Very good especially for the low budget they had.,1525737600,,49,4.555555555555555
8682282,1,B00O5GZDA2,"I'm used to amateur acting and can enjoy amateur plays, but this is just not good - best non-insult I can think of.",1524700800,,115,4.043478260869565
8682283,5,B00O5GZDA2,This is a fun film to watch considering what went into making it. The musical score is excellent.  Don't knock it til you try it!,1524700800,,129,4.16
8682284,1,B00O5GZDA2,"Yes, the acting was horrible.  But it was pretty faithful to the novel. Nothing really ""steam punk"" about it other than the steam coming from the monsters neck. But as a Frankenstein movie collector,  I had to add it to the collection.",1516579200,,235,4.571428571428571
8682285,2,B00O5GZDA2,I wish I had fallen asleep during this movie.,1514073600,,45,4.111111111111111
8682286,1,B00O5GZDA2,"This movie is so awful I dare you to try to watch the first 20 minutes of it.

On the bright side, if you have spent your life committing unspeakable evil, maybe watching it till the end will cut some time off of your sentence in hell.

Yes, it is that bad....",1489968000,,260,3.980769230769231
8682287,1,B00O5GZDA2,Amazingly bad. So bad it was a blast! I couldn't tear myself away. These folks were in dead earnest. The acting was arkward consistently across the cast. Every intention was shot at and missed. It was totally devoid of humor. I love the fact that these folks got it made. Has to be a cult sleeper.,1484611200,,297,4.321428571428571
8682288,1,B00O5GZDA2,Acting is really bad.,1476230400,,21,4.5
8682289,4,B00O5GZDA2,"The abysmal acting ruined what could have been the definitive film. It followed Mary Shelly's book more faithfully than most, steampunk or not. Visually pleasing and the music was spot on. The most powerful and enjoyable scenes were the silent ones. Maybe someday they can remake this movie with competent actors",1473811200,,312,5.137254901960785
8682290,1,B00O5GZDA2,Wish I could have given it a zero.,1473033600,,34,3.375
