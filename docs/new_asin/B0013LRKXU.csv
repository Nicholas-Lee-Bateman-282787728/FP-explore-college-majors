8252091,5,B0013LRKXU,"Love Trevor Romain- I write the strategies on the board as the kids are watching. By the time the video is over, you have a practical list of solutions for doing your homework without throwing up.",1379894400,,196,4.472222222222222

8252093,3,B0013LRKXU,My grandson has Aspergers and i was hoping this dvd would help him to want to do his homework.  It was just okay.  Not something he would want to watch a second time.  It;'s kind of a rapid speed...........all over the place approach that I personally found hard to follow.,1357776000,,273,4.42

I would recommend it to anyone.",1297814400,,189,4.081081081081081
8252095,5,B0013LRKXU,"I have been showing this video to my 3rd and 4th grade Lunch Bunch kids, and it's gotten lots of guffaws.  The boys especially seem to appreciate the ""gross"" humor parts.  And Skye's line about the blue ribbon at the county fair had all my 4H kids chuckling.  And almost everyone has been trying the math problems from the tomb of doom.
Although Lunch Bunch is not a formal study skills group, they all seem to get at least one or two ideas out of it.  I will use it in SS next year.",1241395200,2,483,4.1063829787234045
8252096,5,B0013LRKXU,"My 9 year old son totally enjoys all of the Trevor Romain products.  We have borrowed his books from our library and DVD's from Netflix.  Now we are building our own collection.  We were introduced to Trevor Romain while researaching books on stress and anxiety to help my son deal with difficult situations.  My only negative comment is... since the dvd's were sold through a vendor and not amazon, I had to pay shipping on each dvd instead of one shipping charge for all three dvd's purchased.",1232150400,3,495,4.655172413793103
