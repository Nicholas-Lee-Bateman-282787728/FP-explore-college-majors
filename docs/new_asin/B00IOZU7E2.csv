If you don't already know blues scales, triads, and chord shapes all over the neck, you'll have trouble. You must be very familiar with SRVs music and style and perhaps already playing it well. This rounds out the edges and takes you In Deeper than standard tab and DVD learner stuff. If you are an experienced player and gigging, you'll enjoy the little secrets and tips here. If you're a tab reader or whatever this is not for you, there are other simpler tutorials out there.",1421625600,2,552,4.585858585858586
8644319,1,B00IOZU7E2,Very poor. Just shows how well he can play and does not explain what he is doing. Only when I play it frame by frame can I tell what he is doing. The hand positions are very difficult to see what he is doing. What a waste of money and time,1417910400,2,239,3.7058823529411766
