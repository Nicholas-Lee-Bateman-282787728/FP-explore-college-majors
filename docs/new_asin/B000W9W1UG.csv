8221915,5,B000W9W1UG,"John Gottman, Marriage Expert, gives an excellent overview of how to change patterns of arguments for couples. He uses the stories of 2 couples along with his research data to give a clear understanding of ways couples can get along better.",1464307200,,240,4.878048780487805
8221916,4,B000W9W1UG,"I bought this product without being able to preview - but when I presented it to my audience - in my couple conflict module - the response was great, and participants were interested in more of John Gottman's work -
the DVD is short/long enough to transfer to interested couples the mission of how to solve/try to find other ways of couple fighting - is right for presenting it to couples who start off their relationship -but good also for couples in long term relationships, who lost fairness to one another in conflict situations.
DVD good for presenters - but also good for self help.
It would be great if John Gottman would produce more of this.",1213920000,6,650,4.564102564102564
