6988693,5,B00SJFCL78,"Tiny Giants is definitely a film that brings the small animal kingdom to life in a big way.  The film immediately brought to mind Jane Yolens&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trash-Mountain/dp/1467712345/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trash Mountain</a>&nbsp;where little red squirrel, Nutley, struggles to survive in the harsh world around him.  This is a small world we seldom get to see close up, but in Tiny Giants it burst into my world in a big way.  Stephen Fry narrates the tale of a chipmunk and a small southern grasshopper mouse.

I marveled as I saw the mouse attack what would be a formidable opponent for many, the scorpion.  Its an exciting battle filled with danger, a battle that only one can win.  The little mouse, of course, is the unexpected winner because hes immune to the deadly scorpion venom.  The southern grasshopper mouse is a predator, but there are those who seek him out for lunch.  Can he make it through the day?

We follow both of these little critters through a single, exciting day in their lives.  We are now privy to their worlds through the amazing, up close world of 3D.  The film can also be played in 2D, but not on any DVD player.  These two little heroes are fun to watch, a film that will entrance people of all ages.  A magnificent film in which we can learn about the animal kingdom up close.

6988704,5,B00SJFCL78,"The 3d is solid and overall the movie was enjoyable to watch.  If you're looking for a cheap 3D to watch on your TV, this isn't a bad nature one.",1508889600,,145,3.8333333333333335
6988705,5,B00SJFCL78,"Having seen many BBC nature specials, I've come to expect nothing but the best from that company. Even so, the photography in this video was surprisingly breathtaking. The scenes are so poignant, that you would have thought that only a cartoon could have captured these dramatic slices of natural life. It's short (~45 minutes), but totally worth it.",1495843200,,350,5.051724137931035
6988706,5,B00SJFCL78,"Great flick.  Filming almost seems fake in spots, but somehow it's all real.  Now that PSVR lets you watch 3d blurays in the headset, these have gotten new life.  I'll probably pick up the whole BBC 3D collection, as they're all absolutely outstanding.

No flickery / shimmery 3D here.  GREAT depth, and well-directed / narrated content.  It's not David Atternborough, but it's damn good.",1493856000,2,388,4.984375

6988737,4,B00SJFCL78,"This story follows part of one year of life for a chipmunk in what appears like an old growth northern california forest and a small rodent that lives in the desert near Tucson Arizona.
Excellent macro photography in 3D video also using HDR stop motion to film and illuminate scenes at night. I'm sure these scenes and stories are totally contrived and shot using multiple animal actors in completely man made scenes.
It shows the life risks tiny creatures deal with trying to not become a meal for large birds, snakes, spiders, and other 4-legged critters. There is no blood or gore, the good guys win, the story has a happy ending.
If you are a videophile and 3D buff this is a great short film for the entire family, worthy of repeat watching. Narrated by Stephen Fry.
I believe both of the stars of this film would be considered rodents if that matters to you.",1469404800,9,864,4.544871794871795

6988763,5,B00SJFCL78,My wife and I love this Tiny Giants 3D video. We've shown it to more people than any other 3D video in our collection and everyone has thoroughly enjoyed the film. The photography is amazing and the subjects are adorable. I've seen it myself more than half a dozen times and am happy to sit through it again whenever any of our friends want to see it. The enjoyment it has brought to this house has been well worth the cost. I hope the BBC makes many more 3D films like this one.,1440460800,8,479,4.161290322580645

6988767,5,B00SJFCL78,"This is another very well made BBC nature documentary. The story follows lives of a Canadian chipmunk and Arizona desert mouse. Interesting commentary and video footage recorded most of the time from the perspective level of those small animals, together form a movie that can be admired by all nature lovers. And if you have a 3D capable viewing system (BD player and TV) then with this disk prepare yourself for a memorable stereoscopic viewing experience. All closup video clips are recorded with great attention to 3D composition and demanding 3D technical details, plus they are seamlessly mixed with green screen special effects. Even ""Making of"" bonus track is unusually recorded in 3D. Highly recommended.",1436313600,,713,5.208695652173913
6988768,4,B00SJFCL78,Super good and well thought out 3-D nature film. So much fun and a good way to showcase your 3-D system to friends.,1435708800,2,115,4.043478260869565

6988771,5,B00SJFCL78,"Just finished watching this with my wife, we were both blown away at how interesting this film was.  It's short but it reminds me of some of the better IMAX movies that have come out in years past.  In 3D it's pretty interesting to see these creatures out in the wild.  Given how much I hate scorpions, I've become a giant fan of the Scorpion Mouse.",1428710400,11,349,4.257575757575758
6988772,5,B00SJFCL78,"TINY GIANTS 3D consists of amazing photography, capturing the adventures of many small creatures, including chipmunks and scorpion mice. Watching this excellent film, I never stopped marveling at how cameras were able to follow animals, track them into their burrows, capture turf battles, and showcase deadly confrontations.

The single disc contains both Blu-ray 3D and Blu-ray 2D versions. The images are pristine and include slow tracking shots as well as traditional stationary shots. Editing is simply incredible, as it creates mini-stories of events in the lives of these small animals. Zoom lenses get the viewer right up close to the action.

Filmed largely in the Sonoran Desert, some of the photography reminded me of John Ford Westerns as the camera rose slowly to peek over a hill into the vast expanse of cactus-strewn land. Juxtaposed are the absolute beauty of nature with the dangers posed by predators, sudden rainfall, stolen food, and winter.

The filmmakers don't just point the camera. They take time to make the lives of these critters dramatic. Music appropriately enhances the visuals and is often amusing in its grandeur. Unlike PLANET DINOSAUR 3D, this release is composed of actual photography, not computer-generated images. Its a testament to patience, planning, and precision.",1428451200,9,1307,5.365853658536586
