8299300,5,B001EPY3IK,"I bought the Gimme a Break on dvd with Nell Carter and I love it. The show was
funny and touching. The cast was great. Nell Carter was perfect for the role she
played on this show. I can't wait till the rest of the series comes out on dvd.
I want to buy the complete season of the show as soon as Amazon gets it which I hope
is soon. I am so looking forward to it.

  Thanks Amazon,
