In my opinion the Tea Party's most creative and darkest period were the years when ""Edges of Twilight"" & ""Transmission"" were recorded. This live performance has a nice little selection of songs from both these albums.

The opening track `Army Ants' really sets the scene. I have heard the studio version of this song over 100 times, but nothing prepared me for the sonically charged sound that comes from Jeff Martin's guitar in the introduction. There are also some good bonus performances and interviews.

Highly recommended purchase",1211846400,7,639,5.066666666666666
8220796,5,B000W00Y18,"Great set of live songs performed to perfection.  For a glimpse of The Tea Party in their element here it is, you won't be sorry.  This is when Much music actually had talented guests perform on their show live.",1205366400,5,211,4.384615384615385

8220798,5,B000W00Y18,"A Very Good piece of The Tea Party within this DVD.
I've never seen them live so this product was a must, now more than ever since they are no longer a band. With this little sample of live show you will listen to some fine tunes like ""Transmission"" which i was very curious to see live.
Although it's not very long, you will enjoy it ""intimatly and interactively"" XD",1203206400,4,367,4.257142857142857
8220799,5,B000W00Y18,As a Tea Party admirer I never get tired of what comes next.  When the Tea Part puts out a DVD they set out to please. You feel like part of the audience when you are watching this DVD. A MUST HAVE!,1196294400,9,198,3.7142857142857144
