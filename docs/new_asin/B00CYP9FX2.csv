8587579,2,B00CYP9FX2,I enjoy the Hatchet Movies.  The only thing I found distasteful were the racists comments and the actress spitting in the black cops face.  Why were they needed?  Spitting in someones face is just nasty.,1519257600,,203,4.742857142857143
8587580,4,B00CYP9FX2,A lot of action and information. Very entertaining.,1483574400,,51,5.5
8587581,3,B00CYP9FX2,"While a heavily-armed team of mercenaries takes to the bayou surrounding Crowley's home, Marybeth finds herself begrudgingly teaming up with a local policeman (Zach Galligan) and his ex-wife (Caroline Williams) - an expert on the maniac who may have uncovered the secret to ending his murderous rampage once and for all. Please let this end! The typical continues, I get they were trying to do an omage to the 80's horror movies but please, enough is enough. Danielle harris is still awful as the, still only survivor trying to get Victor for what he did to her father and brother in the first one. One clever thing in this look carefully toward the end in the canoe....saying no more. The acting has, believe it or not gone downhill with each movie. and the first wasn't too terrific.",1462752000,,785,4.737226277372263
8587582,5,B00CYP9FX2,"Great movie, this guy newer dies no matter what you do to him!!!!!!!!!!",1446595200,,71,4.538461538461538
8587583,4,B00CYP9FX2,"This story picks up with Marybeth (Danielle Harris) ""killing"" Victor Crowley (Kane Hodder) again. It was nice of the producers to use the same person to play Marybeth this time. She is in jail while local police check Honey Island Swamp only to find a bloody mess. Like Jason, Victor never dies so you can figure out the rest.

Sid Haig has a bit part in this film having comedic ""Paula Deen moments."" I did not enjoy this as much as the one with Tony Todd. This film had its comic and dark comedy moments, but was pretty much an over the top slasher with blood spraying unrealistically all over the screen as if it was coming out of a pressure washer. The characters were decent in this one, but the film lacked a certain eye candy. Plenty of blood and gore, easy on plot.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Danielle Harris being hosed in shower with discreet arm and leg placement.",1380240000,2,891,4.426829268292683
8587584,4,B00CYP9FX2,"Victor Crowley takes a gunshot to the face, has Danielle Harris's fist go through his head, and gets cut in half by a chainsaw. Throw in a little GWAR, and you have the first five minutes of Hatchet 3.
Is it original? No.
It is however bloody, gory, and often funny and should please any fan of old school slasher horror flicks.",1379548800,,328,4.306451612903226
