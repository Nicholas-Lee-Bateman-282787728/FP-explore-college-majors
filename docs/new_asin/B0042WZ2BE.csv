8603649,4,B0042WZ2BE,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

PROS:
This workout was just right for my level, sweated a lot but able to follow throughout.
Liked this instructor a lot.  Non-annoying, not too smiley/peppy, did not talk too much, cued well, good tips, strong form.
Nice variety of moves.  Rather high impact with no real lower intensity mods but not a con for me.  Besides, they gave fair warning of target level on the cover of the DVD.
Music was quite good --- strong beat that helped you keep time to the moves.  Started a bit shades of miami vice or something but got better and better as it went on.  I actually enjoyed the music towards the latter half (liking workout dvd music is very rare for me, so worth a special mention.)
Stetch segment includes splits --- I usually do my own stetching because most videos don't go here and I'd rather just get to it so it was nice to follow along for a change.

CONS:
At 30 minutes, too short and not enough cardio.  Instructor should have cycled through all the moves one more round and that would have brought it to an hour, probably.  Better yet, add on a second 30 minute segment focusing more on cardio since this had more emphasis on strength moves and the cardio portions were too short and few for me.
Production quality was on the rather bad side.  Not only seemed slightly unfocused but color saturation seemed a bit off.  I'm not sure if that was deliberate.  If so, it missed the mark for me.  Since I'm on the subject, the messy looking locker background also was a miss for me, as well.

Overall, pros outweighed cons on this one.  Looking forward to more from this instructor.",1302652800,4,1647,4.461538461538462

8603651,1,B0042WZ2BE,"This workout was not as I expected.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  The video quality was poor.  Often the camera was focused on the wrong thing when an exercise was being explained.

Very disappointed.",1291680000,,210,4.75
8603652,5,B0042WZ2BE,"This is a great workout video. But just like anything that is worth while, it does take a little dedication and effort. This is the best workout vid I have ever tried. I am in much better shape now than I was before I started working with this program. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to get in better shape.",1291334400,2,329,4.238095238095238
8603653,5,B0042WZ2BE,"I love this workout! It was really different and harder than I expected in a good way.  My kids were trying some of the moves and we were all cracking up.  I could feel it in my abs the next day.  I plan on purchasing ICE for several friends as holiday gifts!!!  There are exercises in this video you need to try!  The break dance circles and elbow taps were very unique.  Fastest 32 minutes ever!  I hope Jody makes more, they'll be on my wish list.",1291161600,,450,4.103448275862069
