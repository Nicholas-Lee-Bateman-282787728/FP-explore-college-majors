These are mostly great episodes. Its odd they included both Coast-to-Coast Big Mouth and Ray Murdock's X-Ray as Coast is a partial remake of Ray. My favorites in this set are Coast to Coast Big Mouth, October Eve, Laura's Little Lie, The Curious Thing About Women, and Show of Hands. My least favorite are My Mother Can Beat Up My Father, My Husband Is a Check-Grabber,and See Rob Write - Write, Rob, Write. Instead of one of these I would have liked them to include the episode 'Too Many Stars"" where Rob is forced to direct the annual PTA variety show and must choose between Laura and another talented dancer for the lead role.",1390262400,6,2996,4.647619047619048
6219009,5,B00HUG74OW,"Hey, this disc has *got* to be pretty good (no matter what the video quality). Why? Because it contains episodes of the very best situation comedy ever made in TV history (in my own opinion, mind you). :)

""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" ran for five seasons on CBS-TV from 1961 to 1966, with 158 episodes produced and aired. And there are very few misfires in the whole lot, if you ask me. They are all very well-written and acted. The show exhibited (and still does in re-runs or on VHS video or DVD) a ""timeless"" quality, with very likeable characters and realistic situations -- situations that could just as easily be occurring today rather than in the early to mid-1960s when the show was made. Best yet, ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" is just flat-out fun to watch, time and again! The ""re-watchability"" factor on this TV series is very high, making ANY Van Dyke Show video or DVD you might purchase a true collectible in my view, and a bargain, especially considering how often you'll end up replaying the video product.

This bargain-priced, one-disc DVD collection houses 6 of the ""public-domain"" episodes of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" (all six of which aired during the second season of the series [1962-1963]) ............

1.) ""Never Name A Duck""
2.) ""Bank Book 6565696""
3.) ""Hustling The Hustler""
4.) ""The Night The Roof Fell In""
5.) ""A Man's Teeth Are Not His Own""
6.) ""Give Me Your Walls""

My favorites from the above batch of programs are: ""The Night The Roof Fell In"" and ""A Man's Teeth Are Not His Own"". .... In ""Roof"", Rob and Laura Petrie, the show's normally-congenial husband-and-wife duo, have a rare spat; and each one tells friends and neighbors very different versions of the squabble. When Rob brings home Laura's favorite Chinese take-out dinner to try and mend fences, another fight just might erupt, because Laura's attempt at making up is going to clash with Rob's -- she has prepared an elaborate dinner for two!

In the ""Teeth"" episode, Rob busts a tooth on a bone hidden in his ""soft chicken sandwich"" while his dentist (neighbor Jerry Helper) is out of town. .... ""You broke your tooth on a bone?"", inquires Sally Rogers. ""Well, I don't think he broke it on the mayonnaise!"", Buddy Sorrell replies. (LOL!)

This episode prominently features actor/director Jerry Paris on screen. Paris would go on to direct most of the Van Dyke Show episodes in the latter years of the series. Which, in a way, is kind of a shame, because it limited (to an extent) the amount of on-screen air time given Paris during the later seasons of the show. I've always enjoyed greatly watching the ""Jerry Helper"" character as portrayed by Jerry Paris. He and Rob/(Dick) worked very well together; there was a genuine bond of friendship between these two neighbors that came across on the TV screen.

Even if the video quality on this disc is a bit on the rough side in spots and not equal to the pristine discs put out by Image Entertainment/Paul Brownstein, the high quality of the episodes themselves, IMO, trumps any video defects seen here. After all, we're talking about Rob and Laura and Company -- so you know the shows are gonna be tops!

And always remember, my Van Dyke Show-loving friends --- ""A second with you (Mel Cooley) is like a year with an ugly mob!""  :-)",1101600000,5,3269,4.651646447140381
6219010,3,B00HUG74OW,"This DVD is a mere sprinkling of what the actual series has to offer it's fans. Although the quality is far better than the typical VHS copy (from cable) that we are all used to, it's still far from the quality that is possible. It is a real novelty to be able to choose what episode you want with a click from the remote, and not have to edit out commercials etc. Don't expect any extras from this DVD. There are NONE. Then again, this show has always withstood the test of time and technology by having a brilliant story performed by brilliant actors. No glitz, just glamour.",1051747200,5,577,4.351851851851852
6219011,1,B00HUG74OW,"Let me answer everyone's question as to why only these episodes were chosen....the producer of this DVD did NOT pay any royalties on these episodes!!!  Due to an error many years ago, these episodes slipped into the public domain, as therefore, are being produced without any authorization or payment of royalites to the owners of the show.
Let me tell you that each and every episode will be available in the next several months - created from original copies of the show for the highest quality...and they will be produced will the full knowledge of Carl Reiner and Dick Van Dyke.
So, don't lose your sense of humor or your thumbs!!  But keep an eye out for the entire collection of 158 shows sometime very soon.",1011484800,160,714,4.658730158730159
6219012,4,B00HUG74OW,"This DVD has six fairly representative but certainly not classic episodes from the second season of the ""Dick Van Dyke Show.""  While ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" was finishing #1 in the Nielsens, this was the sitcom that was picking up the Emmys.  Included on this disc are: (1) ""Never Name a Duck"" (Episode #31, September 26, 1962), where Richie (Larry Mathews) is grief stricken over the death of his pet duck, thus the sage advice of the title of this episode, written by series creator Carl Reiner; (2) ""Bank Book 6565696"" (Episode #34, October 17, 1962), in which Rob (Dick Van Dyke) becomes too suspicious for his own good when he discovers Laura (Mary Tyler Moore) has a secret bank account with a nice little balance in it; (3) ""Hustling the Hustler"" (Episode #35, October 24, 1962), has Buddy (Morey Amsterdam) worried that his brother (Phil Leeds), the reformed gambler, is going to take Rob for big bucks during a friendly little game of pool; (4) ""The Night the Roof Fell In"" (Episode #39, November 21, 1962) does an homage to ""Rashomon"" as Rob and Laura tell their very different accounts of the marital fight that led to him storming out of the house; (5) ""A Man's Teeth Are Not His Own"" (Episode #43, December 19, 1962), another Reiner gem, has Rob convinced his best friend and neighbor Jerry Halper (Jerry Paris) will never forgive him for letting another dentist perform emergency dental work on his teeth; and (6) ""Give Me Your Walls!"" (Episode #53, February 27, 1963) has Laura hiring a flamboyant artist (Vito Scotti) to paint the walls in the living room and becoming worried when it looks like a con man is taking over her home.  I have no idea why whoever put this collection together looked only at the show's second season or picked these particular episodes.  I mean, they could have done the one where Rob and Laura get married, Richie finds out his middle name is ""Rosebud,"" Buddy and Sally disappear every weekend, Rob becomes allergic to Laura, or Rob's classic nightmare about an alien invasion headed by someone who looks a lot like Danny Thomas and has a thing for walnuts.  So this collection could have been a whole lot better.  Clearly it is time that this show was given the same sort of treatment when it comes to DVD/Video that are accorded all of the other classic sitcoms.",1008806400,67,2311,4.693827160493827

I don't know why they put the lower left photo of the three of them in black and white tuxedo-like costumes dancing, because that episode is not even on this disc! I thought I was getting three episodes, including that one, but no. There are only TWO episodes. I really feel like those back photos are deceptive. You get two episodes, and really only one is a true ""Christmas"" one. We were so disappointed.
** update - I contacted the company and (to my surprise!) received a very nice response. The fellow apologized about the misleading photo saying it was not supposed to be on the label. He said they could not offer me a refund, but offered instead to send me the Dick Van Dyke Halloween Classic DVD. I must say I was SO impressed!

6219051,3,B00HUG74OW,"As a fan of The Dick Van Dyke Show who already has the complete series on DVD, I was a little puzzled when I saw there was this apparent compilation of ""Classic Christmas"" episodes.  To the best of my knowledge, there was only one true holiday episode during the series' five-year run: The excellent ""Alan Brady Presents.""  But I love to collect Christmas-themed shows on DVD, and it was pretty cheap, so I decided to pick it up.

And yep, I was right.  There is only ONE true Christmas episode.  There are, in fact, only two episodes on this DVD.  The other, ""Uhny Uftz,"" while a really good and funny episode, has nothing to do with Christmas.  There is (minor spoiler) ONE mention of a toy that is supposed to say ""Merry Christmas,"" but nothing else about the episode is holiday-themed.  In fact, if you dig around the internet a bit, you'll learn that this fifth-season episode actually aired in September, 1965, so it was never intended to be viewed as a Yuletide story.

Anyway, I give it 3 stars simply because these are two admittedly very good episodes.  And if you don't want to invest in complete seasons sets, and just want an hour of classic sitcom laughs, you could do much worse.

The Cat Burglar-Rob and Laura are frightened by a strange noise in the night, while there has been a burglary in the neighborhood.
Long Night's Journey into Day-Laura spends the night in the Petrie house while strange noises abound.
