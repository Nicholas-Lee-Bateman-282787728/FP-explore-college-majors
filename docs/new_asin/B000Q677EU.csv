8194499,4,B000Q677EU,"We own a horse that cameos in this movie, too much swearing so not for kids but otherwise an OK western",1374624000,,103,3.9523809523809526
8194500,1,B000Q677EU,"I love a GOOD western...have seen many.

This film gives westerns a bad name.

I could go on but I won't as a couple of other reviewers are bang on.",1257638400,,148,3.9
8194501,5,B000Q677EU,"Ok this is not your run of the mill Western. But the storyline of the three widows/sister-in-laws and their situation and mishaps, is so different that it worked. This a shoot'em up, action filled ruthless Western with a very dark humorous side. A Little House on the Prairie it is not. More on the lines of Deadwood. But what made this unique was the main story is about three completely different but very determined women, all out of their element. I love watching Westerns, but rarely add them to my collection. This one I purchased. If you loved the series Deadwood I think you will enjoy this one. If you thought Deadwood was too raw you might want to pass on this Western.",1231718400,7,679,4.528455284552845
8194502,4,B000Q677EU,I'm just a sucker for westerns. Patrick Bergin and Suzanne Andrews are great in this.,1201564800,9,85,4.733333333333333
8194503,1,B000Q677EU,"I agree with the previous reviewer about everything to do with this movie but especially in wishing I could give it a negative rating.  It's far from being even remotely decent.

I recently was stuck watching this movie at a family gathering. The only thing I can think this movie would be good for is either using it as an example of a REALLY bad movie or using this at a ""Mystery Science Theatre"" party.  Frankly that was the only amusing aspect of the viewing experience, as we ended up making fun of the whole thing--that is when I wasn't wishing I could put my eyes out with a sharp stick.

Don't expect to see anyone particularly famous in this.  The only one I (barely) recognized was Julia Roberts' abusive husband in ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" (Patrick Bergin).  His character has not improved much in this movie and his attempt at ""singing"" of the end credit song was so bad I could do nothing but laugh.  The acting is....pathetic...IF you can even call it acting by any and all involved.  The plot is thin at best and I actually cringed several times due to the absurdity of it all.

Also, be warned, the language is really bad and out of context.  I am far away from being easily shocked by foul language in a movie but I was not alone in feeling that it was excessive and completely out of place, especially in a ""movie"" that claims to be of the western genre.  Whatever you do, IF you do end up viewing this wretched movie, I highly recommend you do not allow small children or verbally sensitive folks to watch this.

The only decent part of this movie as far as I'm concerned was the scenery it was filmed around.  Clearly it was filmed around San Ysidro, New Mexico which is a lovely area, it's just sad that this movie disgraced its sand.

Save your money and your time and move on to something more worthy.",1200182400,2,1825,4.392857142857143
8194504,1,B000Q677EU,"Both the story and acting are very poor. Some of the scenery was good, but only if you have a large TV. The appearance of ghosts only served to take the movie down another notch. If there were a negative star rating, I'd have given it a minus 3 just for wasting my time.",1188864000,3,270,4.018518518518518
