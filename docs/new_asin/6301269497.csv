Don't expext an in depth, elongated affair. These are just enough for a short jaunt into that victorian world that can really capture your imagination.

7810969,4,6301269497,"Charles Dickens' Ghost Stories, was one of my personal favorite movies of my childhood. While, I was getting ready to have a yard sale, when I stumbled over this little movie. And I couldn't have the heart to sell it! So now, I am watching it for the first time in eight years. And well as looking at it, in comparision to the animated films of today. The film is kinda mucky, and the animation is kinda blane. But it's actually very good. Its only 60 minutes long, and contains three stories by the famous novelist, Charles Dickens - The Ghost in the Wardrobe, The Mail Coach Ghosts, and the Goblin and the Gravedigger. My persoanl favorite is the Mail Coach Ghosts, in which a drunken man wanders to a abandoned area occupied by coaches. And he falls asleep, and wakes up to find that he has stepped into another dimension. But together all of theses tales are extremly entertaining, and also eerie",1057881600,2,900,4.52760736196319
7810970,3,6301269497,"Better known for his epic novels of greater length, Dickens captures a more insular atmosphere with his humorous and  possible satirical Pickwick Papers.  This animated collection of the ghost stories from this work is a charming introduction for any audience that has not already been exposed to this particular work, or any works of Dickens.  The vignette that stands out is the Sexton that was kidnapped by the goblins.  Yet again he peels back the layers of human psyche by means of the supernatural to give his central character a change of heart.  I highly recommend this film.  I plan on purchasing a second copy and look forward to purchasing the live action Pickwick Papers of 1952.",976492800,4,691,4.863247863247863
7810971,5,6301269497,"Surprisingly good adaptations of three stories from The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens. These stories actually inspired me to read the book!
If your kids want something a little bit scary but not TOO scary, this should  be just right!  Very atmospheric, but nothing gross.",961718400,5,276,5.111111111111111
