8077911,5,B000ADKWIW,"Here, on the last disc of the series, Peacemaker achieves stunning success.  Finally we are able to witness the best fight scenes in the show and see how this story ends. (Possibly some SPOILERS ahead)

This is the darkest and most violent disc of all 7.  ""Decision"" is not meant to be taken lightly.  Characters we have come to care about are now seen in action.  The viewer begins to wonder if these Shinsengumi really are the good guys.  Shinpachi, Okita, and Kondo truly are demons as they attempt to foil the Choshu's intentions.  Yoshida flickers back and forth.  At times he is admirable when he does what is best for his page, Suzu.  Then he is completely mad in battle, utterly ruthless and terrifying.
The battles are very well animated.  Despite the digital effects which usually annoy the heck out of me, I found myself enjoying these episodes a lot.  It is gory, however, and the near ending of the first episode on the disc was difficult to watch.  The sound effects added something in that scene.  It's not fun hearing a ribcage being broken.

The first episode on the disc is the initial attack on Ikedaya.  The second episode wraps up the battle in a surprising conclusion.  Tetsu finally does find what had been lost in his heart.  He at last realizes what he had been trying to do during all of his time spent with the Shinsengumi.

The final episode does not completely finish the series.  It leaves several loose ends.  Thankfully, it is not an ending I cringed at while watching.  It is not poorly done, but it is still not entirely satisfying.

Once again, the Japanese voice acting is the best choice. The extras are okay.  The video clip wasn't something I loved and the Character Collections weren't as good as past ones.

This disc is definitely worth purchase.  It ends a great series in a good fasion and boasts some spectacular fight scenes.  If you've been with Peacemaker this long, you don't need me to persuade you to buy this.

It feels a bit off topic, but I would like to mention this as one last thing.  The Peacemaker Kurogane manga series is being released here in the US and is the actual conclusion to this entire story.  If your desire for more Peacemaker leads you there, you should take something into consideration: it is not a happy ending.  Main characters die and betayal and vengance are two key plot elements.  It is very different from the anime.  I don't wish to say don't read it.  If you do decide to pick it up, just realize it is very different and very dark.",1127865600,6,2516,4.532293986636971
8077912,5,B000ADKWIW,"If you are a fan of Samurai mvoies or anime, you have to pick this movie up. The amount of amazing battle scenes and the animation that it is drawn with is astounding. I am a huge fan of samurai type shows such as Ruruouni Kenshin and Samurai Deeper Kyo. This is a must buy for any anime fan.",1127779200,,292,3.9661016949152543
