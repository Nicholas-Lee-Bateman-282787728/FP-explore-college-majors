7868661,1,6304359969,"The Amazon description for this item confuses two films on the Foreign Legion:
1. 1950s British TV dramatic series, called ""Assignment Foreign Legion,"" on stories of individuals in the Fl, starring Merle Oberon;
2. 1990s documentary on the training of FL soldier.

I thought I was ordering #1 and got #2.",1310256000,2,304,4.96078431372549
7868662,1,6304359969,"I purshased this video which is advertised by Amazon as starring Merle Oberon.  Instead I got a documentary on the Foreign Legion.
I didn't return it nor criticize the seller but I think Amazon needs to take more care in how they describe and item.  The first four reviews if I had read them actually related the ture contents.

7868663,4,6304359969,"As said before the tape contains two films. The first is about a englishmen joining, and his time in the selecting- and ""boot camp""-phase. This film is really interesting and good. It shows some of the training (the singing lessons too!). The second film is about some fresh legionaires coming straight from Castelnaudary to 3e REI in french Guyane. It is very interesting too but what I really miss is to see something from the other regiments, not only this. Although worth putting your money on!",975888000,4,498,4.8023255813953485
7868664,2,6304359969,"Having trained with FFL troops, I must say I was quite let down by this  video.  It was kind of boring and not really that intriquing.  Found myself  fighting off sleep more than anything else.  A good video on FFL would be  the World of Valor series which use to show on the Discovery channel.  Who  ever made this video needs to take some hints from the Discovery guys.",969321600,7,371,4.27536231884058
