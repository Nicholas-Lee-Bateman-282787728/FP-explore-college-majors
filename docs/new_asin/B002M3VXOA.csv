3951725,5,B002M3VXOA,Mark Knopfler was born to play the guitar. Watching him makes this whole DVD terrific. I've seen him live and it is positively uplifting.,1358899200,,137,4.75
3951726,2,B002M3VXOA,"I have read several of the reviews prior to purchasing this DVD.  Did I receive the same DVD?
I am an avid Dire Straits/Mark Knopfler fan, and as far as the actual content is concerned, the song selection is decent.  The sound is supposed to be Dolby Digital, and it is not.  The video is worse.  Fuzzy and amateurish production.  The DVD came without any literature or other content to describe the event, participants, band, history, etc., etc., etc......I was very disappointed and do not recommend this DVD.
Even the cover photo was of a more recent Mark Knopfler.",1357344000,,568,4.696969696969697
3951727,5,B002M3VXOA,"Dire straits are one of my favourites groups and I did not have dvd's with live performances of them, so I came across this one and was not really decided to buy it, read some reviews and order it thinking it  was a relatively recent performance as Mark Knopfler looked old with short hair and playing a Les Paul, once I received I put it straight in to my DVD player and once the first images appeared, I noticed with great surprise this is an old but very nice concert from Dire straits at the famous Rockpalast venue in Germany, Mark is in his twenties ( the best age range for a guitar player) slim and with long hair,and playing a red Strat ( the guitar sound I like the most) I can guess this performance is from the late 70""s as he is wearing high heel shoes and tight pants. The sound quality  is great ( I'm playing it through my 5.1 receiver) great bass sound and crisp highs, well balanced mids. and Dire Straits are playing at the top of their game.
This is a great addition to my Rock Concerts collection and I will recommend to anyone who likes Dire straits and Live Concerts, No hesitation to rate this DVD 5 stars",1353542400,,1129,4.246511627906977
3951728,3,B002M3VXOA,"Nice addition for a Dire Straits fan - video so/so but the audio was very good and the choice of numbers was great,  Liked it enough to order another DS concert DVD",1352937600,,164,4.125
3951729,5,B002M3VXOA,"This video was created only after their Communique album. Mark refers to the songs from that album as new songs in this concert video. Sometimes during the concert, the video image is blurry, but gets into focus when the music plays. I guess this was somehow an intended effect, during the lapses between songs, but I don't like it that much. The overall atmosphere is intimate as it is a small crowd, a club in Germany that seats about 100 I guess. Sultans of Swing gets performed twice. Mark says he messed up the first time, but I didn't detect what was wrong the first time he played it, but nevertheless Sultans gets performed twice in this concert video. I am a fan of Dire Straits, and this is a great concert video, and am happy I made this purchase.",1350345600,5,758,4.421428571428572
3951730,5,B002M3VXOA,"Love this concert DVD !!!! It has some ""blurry"" moments but who of us hasn't !!!! A classic rock gem !!!! Just talked myself into watching it again,see ya !!!!",1345507200,2,159,4.333333333333333
3951731,5,B002M3VXOA,"What is not to love about the early Dire Straits albums.  Rock and Roll with a touch of rockabilly highlighting Mark knopfler's one of a kind vocal expression and seemingly endless supply of great guitar chops never gets old to me.  Mark Knopfler has remained one of my all time favorites ever since I first became familiar with Dire Straits in the Mid 80's and the early recordings of DS is where I like him the most.

As the other reviewers have noted the video picture quality is more than acceptable.  The audio sounds good too.  Considering the time when this was recorded, it is not very realistic to expect anything better in regards to quality, just don't expect anything close to todays standards of high definition (that didn't exist back then you spoiled member of the HD generation).  Then there is the picture on the cover...  Who knows why the company putting this video out chose to go with a more aged version of Mark Knopfler holding a Les Paul and not a Stratocastor as is played on the recording.  Probably because of his wonderful smile.  While this is a bit odd from a packaging standpoint I didn't let it distress me.  Actually it adds to the overall charm of this product in my mind.  Anyone who is familiar with the electric guitar as an instrument and Mark Knopfler as a guitarist knows that all throughout DS first few recordings he played almost exclusively on a Strat.  You just won't get that kind of twang out of a Les Paul.  I suppose the best way I can put it is ""don't judge a book (or in this case a DVD) by it's cover.""

The show itself is, of course, very good.  It includes most of my favorite old DS tunes, such as ""Down to the Waterline"", ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", ""Water of Love"", and ""Where Do You Think You're Going"".  What I enjoyed most about this set, however, was the inclusion of some material that I've never heard on any of their CD's.  To discover previously unheard old DS songs or cover's, as the case may be, was thrilling to me.  The most notable song in my opinion is the straight up rockabilly ""Eastbound Train.""  I had always described their sound as having elements of rockabilly only to be told by more ""educated"" musicians, ""That isn't rockabilly.""  It's funny how those people seemed to miss the inclusion of the term ""elements of.""  Just goes to show that people tend to be too quick to judge, therefore not understanding the finer points of what they are judging.  Well, now I can show those stuffy poo poo heads an actual rockabilly song performed by Dire Straits.  How great is that?  Pretty damn cool if you ask me.  Oh, by the way, ""Eastbound Train"" is my favorite song on the DVD, also making it my all time favorite DS song (although I suspect that it is a cover but cannot confirm that due to the fact that there are no liner notes).

My complaints are:  Why are there no liner notes?  It would be great to have information included with the DVD.  Also, why aren't there any CD's available of this show?  It is a shame that there are some old DS songs that can only be heard by DVD, but that is no fault of this product.  There is no way that this gets any less than 5 stars.  Actually, they probably didn't include liner notes to keep it from necessarily being marked more than 5 stars, which is not possible.  I guess that makes sense in some parallel universe.",1340496000,3,3339,4.40359477124183
3951732,5,B002M3VXOA,"First off, I buy a LOT of off the wall hard to find DVD's so I know what I am talking about. I bought this dvd fron the reputable Movie Mars. This is the BEST Classic Rock ""non-mainstream"" DVD I have ever purchased. I have heard reviews that say the picture or sound could be better? RUBBISH! The Picture and sound of this DVD are EXCELLENT! What an awesome show. Dire Straits on Rockpalast in a small club setting. Fantastic! Great sound, great picture, and a classic performance. As far as I know, this is the only Dire Straits pre-1980 performance availabe. Never mind the cover, Mark Knoppler plays a Strat the whole show. BUY THIS NOW before they are gone!!

3951733,3,B002M3VXOA,"My biggest problem with this is that it's listed on Amazon as an audio CD, but it's not! It's just the same DVD as the other ""live In Germany"" disc, but with a newer photo of Knopfler on the cover. I hoped to get a CD of this show to play in my car, which is why I bought both versions. The seller needs to be more careful about how things are listed.

Having said all that, this is a really good show, and worth getting if you're a Dire Straits fan, as the songs are from the early albums and most of them didn't get played in the band's concerts of the 80's and 90's. I thought the quality of the picture was fine considering it's from 1979. It's way better than how I've seen it in the past.

I'd recommend getting the other disc though, with the older photo of Knopfler on the cover. The disc contents are the same (right down to the menu), but the other DVD came with a small insert inside with additional information about the band.

I give the show 5 stars, but this particular offering of it is misleading, hence my 3 star rating.",1326585600,2,1038,4.128712871287129
3951734,5,B002M3VXOA,"Loved the musical DVD of DIRE STRAITS:SULTANS OF SWING/LIVE IN GERMANY;  listened to it many times. It has 3 audio settings to fit your player:  Stereo, Dolby Digital and DST.  It automatically uses DST unless you choose another audio option.  I love this music.

  However, I was confused about one thing:  this DVD was labeled 1999, and has picture of an older Mark Knopfler on front, and I did not notice that it was the 1979 performance, remastered in 1999- I thought it was a 1999 performance.  But I do think it has a better sound quality than 1979 original.  Fun to compare. I highly recommend this DVD.

I ordered this DVD and original 1979 version of SULTANS OF SWING from Movie Mars, who are always reliable - I receive  materials from them quickly and of excellent quality.  Sometimes I have paid a few cents more to order from Movie Mars than another supplier.",1301443200,9,872,4.584415584415584
8373530,3,B002M3VXOA,Almost lo-fi video quality and sound.  This was a TV special shot in a German club.  The energy is typical German reserved but despite that the band tries hard.  Better to hope for a big concert in Blu-Ray...if and when.,1429574400,,220,4.45

8373532,4,B002M3VXOA,"Fair quality video although nowhere as good as Alchemy which is also available.  For the earliest incarnation of Dire Straits this is good but not essential compared to Alchemy or if you can find it, On The Night.",1417219200,,213,4.605263157894737
8373533,5,B002M3VXOA,Nice hearing and seeing the old songs performed !,1413763200,,49,4.555555555555555
8373534,5,B002M3VXOA,This is actually one of my favorite bands as I feel that Mark Knopfler is one the all time greatest guitarist of that time period.  I am really fond of their early music as well as their later stuff!,1389312000,,199,4.102564102564102
8373535,4,B002M3VXOA,It was great. The DVD was likely filmed around '79 -'80 and contains songs from first and second album. I enjoyed this DVD.,1372032000,,123,4.391304347826087

8373537,2,B002M3VXOA,"Dire Straits are great of course (*****), but the quality of the picture and sound on this dvd are terrible. I realize it is an old recording but was still bad for the day! Sound is low, distorted and camera work is lacking.",1368144000,,224,4.232558139534884
8373538,3,B002M3VXOA,The quality of the picture and sound was dissapointing.  I gave it a OK as listening and watching the songs brings back fond memories.,1360108800,,134,4.583333333333333
8373539,5,B002M3VXOA,"I had always wanted a live show of early Dire Straits; a very young Mark Knopfler and all the original members (Pick Withers on drums).  Finally, I have a live version of ""Single Handed Sailor"" and ""In the Gallery,"" although they didn't play ""Setting Me Up"" (oh well). Like some other reviews mentioned, the cover picture is definitely not from the show, and the picture is reversed (he plays guitar right handed).  Not sure why, but the same is true for ""One Night In London"" another must have DVD (the picture on that DVD is from a Dire Straits show, not from the solo concert). Anyway, if you're a true fan, this DVD is well worth the money.  I hope they release more early shows.",1360022400,,683,4.448
