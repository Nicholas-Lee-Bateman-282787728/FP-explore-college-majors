You can get the basic plot of the show from the blurb in the description above, so I'll skip that. This show is well animated, and has some very great characters. And you'd better enjoy those aspects, because the story is lacking in some respects.  By which I mean, it's like they took a 26 episode anime show that was fantastic, handed it to a first-year film school editor, and told him to cut it down to 11 episodes. The story is there, and it's a good story, but none of it is ever given enough time.  You can still follow what's happening, and unlike many animes, there is a resolution reached by the end.

But the very fact that it is so well animated, and the characters so well done, makes it all the more obvious that so much of the story potential was just not realized. This could have been a great show, instead it is merely a good show. A couple of the individual episodes are very very good, which make watching the whole thing worth your time.",1444521600,5,1088,4.344827586206897
