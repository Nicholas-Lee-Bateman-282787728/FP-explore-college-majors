8672230,5,B00MH26NG4,"Bought this for my all time favorite horror movie, Anaconda.  This is a cult classic, with a little age to it, but if you want to see Ice Cube and Jennifer Lopez kicking big snake butt, this is the movie for you.  Very stylish, which is, to me anyway, what makes for a cult classic.  No one is glammed up, in full makeup and pressed shirts  As the trip down the river progresses, everyone gets down and dirty and the two leads have never looked so good with snake goo on their heads.  I never noticed how snakelike Jon Voight is.

The other two movies with Ice Cube are good, Ghosts of Mars (John Carpenter) and XXX State Union are great too.  But you know my favorite already.",1523836800,,677,4.2421875
