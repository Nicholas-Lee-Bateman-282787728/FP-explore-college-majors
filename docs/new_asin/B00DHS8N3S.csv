5813652,5,B00DHS8N3S,"My daughter is a HUGE Scooby fan. Even though I didn't think it possible, I got tired of watching the classic Scooby episodes from the 70s. There are some changes in Mystery Inc story, but I like the more complex story lines ... keeps me tuned in when I'm watching with my 4 year old.",1382227200,7,284,4.181818181818182
5813653,5,B00DHS8N3S,"I've never been a huge fan, but this version was extremely well thought out, detailed, layered, witty, funny, and even at times emotional. Not bad for a cartoon that featured a talking dog. I am sorry to see it go.",1381881600,4,214,4.375
5813654,5,B00DHS8N3S,"I think this was a show written for the long time fans. There's definitely more character development and some adult themes, but my 3 year old does fine with the show. I like that there is now a story arc and character development. The mysteries are, as expected not terribly hard to solve for an adult, but the sheer number of voice talents from Harlan Ellison, George Takei, Lewis Black, Vivica A. Fox, Mark Hamill and Patrick Warburton and others. This isn't just a cheap thrown together show. Everything seems to have been fairly well thought out and plotted, keeping to the spirit of the original series while adding just a bit more meat to the story. It makes the series and characters seem so much more than 2 dimensional cartoons. I'm looking forward to seeing season 2.",1381017600,13,778,4.644927536231884
5813655,1,B00DHS8N3S,"The Scooby Doo franchise has already been overdone with too many direct to video films but THIS?! This is the absolute worst Scooby Doo series or any part of the franchise I have ever seen! I myself am not a huge Scooby Doo fans because I already thought the characters were bone- dry but this show is AWFUL! The monsters are gruesome, the setting is dark, the gang is not traveling and stuck in a dumb town, the characters are mean- spirited, the dialogue is awkward, and when it isn't, it is stupid! The ""dad"" wants nothing to do with his son, too. Here's my biggest problem with the show; Shaggy having to choose between Velma or Scooby! Not only don't I like the torn between two things story, but when Scooby accuses Shaggy of "" cheating"" on him--it's just STUPID!!! You can't date a dog! What the heck?! Overall, I really hate this show.",1380153600,5,843,4.445161290322581
5813656,3,B00DHS8N3S,"I was pleasantly surprised with Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated when it debuted on the Cartoon Network. The clever writing paid homage to the original series and much of the cartoon's long history. We even saw glimpses of other vintage Hanna Barbera cartoons pop up now and then. The animation style of the characters is a little too stylistic for my taste, being a bit too angular but it is nice to see them in their original clothes. The backgrounds are bright and a bit impressionistic but they work well and add greatly to the artistic feel of the series.
Unfortunately much of this artistry is greatly diminished on standard definition DVD. These brilliant colors and great animation scream for Blu-Ray presentation. As a long time collector of nearly every Scooby presentation from Warner Brothers, I struggled to put off buying the piecemeal release of this iteration of the franchise but succumbed eventually. Now we have a new release of the first season in a complete package, but still no BD option. Come on guys! I'm waiting for Mystery Inc. in all it's beautiful glory.",1378857600,25,1083,4.923497267759563
5813657,5,B00DHS8N3S,"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated is probably the biggest animated surprise I've seen in recent years.  Before watching it I would have never thought there was a way of recreating these characters in a new, interesting way.  The show managed to not only breath new life in to archetypal characters everyone already knows by heart, but also manages to put them in engaging stories and develop them as characters.  I cared about the characters in Mystery Incorporated, and wanted to know how they'd get through things.  Pretty impressive given this is the Scooby gang we're talking about.

I'm 20 years old now, and I'm not a hardcore Scooby fan.  Of course I loved the Hanna-Barbera cartoons when I was a child, but they didn't exactly have incredible lasting power as I got older.  Various other attempts to revise the characters likewise didn't impress me much either.  2002's ""What's New Scooby-Doo?"" tried updating the stories, and character designs for modern viewers but fell flat, failing to capture my imagination as an older viewer (although the character redesigns were pretty good).  After ""What's New"" I figured that any other Scooby-Doo revival would fail in the same manner.

Boy, was I wrong!

Scooby-Doo!:  Mystery Incorporated is different.  It follows the general concept that we all know by heart, but it has a great sense of humor, and creates arcs for the characters to go through.  And I can't overstate how awesome it is to see this in a 'Scooby-Doo!' cartoon!  I feel for the characters, I want to see how they develop, and want to know how the overarching plot of the series is going to play out.

Characters are an important part of the series.  While the slapstick and Scooby's antics are always good for young audiences I found that -for a family targeted cartoon- the show effectively tackled issues of growing up, and what being a teenager is like.  Issues such as first dates, remaining friends with someone after a break-up, self-confidence, and deciding who you want to be as an adult.  The writers perfectly bring these issues down to a level that children may understand, but they don't dumb it down to the point that older audiences can't relate to the gang.  In season 1 every character goes through changes and must make hard decisions and it pulled me in so that I was rooting for them from episode 1 to 26!

Mystery Incorporated has smooth, streamlined character design, and returns the cast to their retro-1960s wardrobe (yes, Freddy is rocking the ascot).  These designs work as an update while remaining true to the designs embedded in our pop culture subconscious (only noticeable difference being that Velma now has red bows in her hair).  But the real star of the animation is the monster designs!  Many of these are so good that I honestly wished they weren't just people in masks.  Take note, Warner Bros.: Put this team on production of a fantasy series.  I want to see what they can do outside the shackles of the ""someone in a mask"" formula.

The setting seems to be a mix of the 60s and modern times.  Devices like laptops and cellphones appear, but I believe the creators made the wise choice of giving Mystery Incorporated a setting that makes it feel as if it could be set in multiple eras.  We got the 60s fashion, we got modern technology, a 1970s style radio DJ, and episodes devoted to goth bands, the fiction of H.P. Lovecraft going up against tween vampire novels, the films of Vincent Price, and many more!  No matter what decade you owe your childhood to odds are you'll find something to connect to in Mystery Incorporated.  In that way I feel this series is going to age remarkably well compared to others series in the franchise.

'Scooby-Doo!' is such a recognizable franchise that they could have slapped anything on the screen and cashed in.  They didn't need to write engaging character stories or narrative that branches across multiple episodes, but they did and it makes the series one of the most enjoyable cartoons in recent memory.  I am happy to see Warner Bros. is releasing Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated's first season in a single boxset just in time for Halloween.  It is well-written, funny, and provides greater depth to the character than any other series in the franchise's long history.  If you have kids, or just want to watch a great revival of these classic characters.  I can't recommend Season 1 of Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated highly enough.",1378080000,46,4438,4.822751322751323
5813665,5,B00DHS8N3S,"I always enjoyed watching Scooby-Doo! Where Are You? and Whats New, Scooby-Doo?, but I always wanted a more darker tone for the series. Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated delivers just that, exploring darker themes and focusing on character development between the gang. Dont get me wrong, this show is still made with the child audience in mind, but its more directed towards teenagers and even young adults this time around. I love this show, and if you like Scooby-Doo, I highly recommend it. It is not even a smidgen a waste of time! ",1522022400,,536,4.8901098901098905
5813666,3,B00DHS8N3S,"I agree with most others that this series is probably the best of the newer Scooby shows produced since Where Are You was cancelled.  It's just a little disheartening that Warner hasn't released it in it's full fidelity on Blu-ray, considering the series was made for HD.  A number of episodes are included as extras with the various DTV movie releases on Blu-ray and they look SO much better, it's almost disappointing spinning one of these antiquated low def discs in the machine by comparison.  Oh well, here's hoping that maybe the next series or new DTV movies will be full-on computer generated animation like Disney's Tinker Bell movies.  The visual style of this series still looks great as is, in 1080p (2160i) BD anyway, less so in 480i DVD, but I'd still love to see Scooby and the Mystery Inc gang comes to life with a bigger animated budget.",1521849600,,854,4.673333333333333

Great story arc, throwbacks only adults will recognize, goofy silliness that makes everyone laugh and the music is surprisingly good. I could go through each episode and pick out numerous bits ... but you'll discover for yourself. My teen son and I have watched both seasons with all 52 episodes and we are on the second go-round, taking a break every now and then as to not get burned out.

5813731,2,B00DHS8N3S,"I dislike the new take on this series. The gang are teenagers and all the episodes are set in their Crystal Coves hometown. Fred's dad is the shady mayor who will do anything for publicity, and doesnt want mysteries solved. Fred himself is comicly obsessed with traps. Daphne has attitude and in one episode joins a goth girls band. Her parents are shallow and rich and she lives in a mansion complete with indoor pool. Velma has more attitude, and is stubborn, sarcastic, and demanding. They introduce a storyline where she's dating Shaggy and she hates Scooby, demanding Shaggy choose between them. When Scooby goes to jail in another ridiculous episode, she celebrates. She's a demanding brat. Nothing like the sweet, shy Velma from before. Only Shaggy and Scooby remain unchanged. The mysteries all take place in their town, and an informant sends them to cases. Underneath each case is a bigger mystery of the dark town's past. Standalone, this wouldn't be so bad. But as a Scooby series, it makes the characters we know and love into something else. It seems geared at kids with it's sarcastic humor that at times, seems to poke fun at the character's sheer ridiculousness. Maybe they should have just made this Scooby Generation 2; kids of the original scooby gang.",1447459200,3,1272,4.8663594470046085

Its Crystal Cove, not Sunnydale High, I know some people call the Buffy team the ""Scooby gang"" but I and my 6 year old thought the contrived romances detracted from what makes Scooby Doo great-binge eating, running scared from the monster of the week, bribing Scooby with scooby snacks and Velma saying jinkies!",1445904000,3,617,4.775700934579439

I liked the first season best, where it's strictly men in masks. My kids like the second, which features some real monsters like reluctant werewolf and ghoul school do.

I put off buying this series even though Amazon kept recommending it to me because I thought from the covers the animation quality would be something like power puff girls. It's not, it's similar to the newer Scooby movies like Scooby doo wrestlemania. Shading, clear backgrounds ect.

5813756,5,B00DHS8N3S,"I was a fan of A Pup Named Scooby Doo back in the day, one of my favorite shows. My little brother watched Scooby Doo almost religiously. So when I found out about this series, I decided to take it upon myself to rekindle our mutual love for Scooby Doo.
We were not disappointed.
This series is damn-near perfect. It has the old-fashioned, campy fun of the original series and adds on to it with an over-arching story that, in itself, gets darker the further it progresses. The characters are rebuilt from the ground up and given personality, while maintaining their over-all look and feel. There are even some big-time cameo voices in the series: Lewis Black, Vivica A. Fox, Harlan Ellis, George Takei, James Hong, and even Casey Kasem (Rest in Peace, Casey, you were THE SHAGGY!) as Shaggy's father.
The series is definitely worth watching, even if you're an old-time Scooby fan, this series will make you relive the good old days of yore, and there's an episode a lot of children from the '60's and '70's would appreciate. Granted, the episode alone was kind of throwaway filler, but it's still worth watching for the amount of nostalgic insanity it would invoke in parents who grew up with the old Scooby Doo.

5813759,5,B00DHS8N3S,"Scooby Doo has undergone many different formats from its original incarnation in 1969. This is a great tribute to the original series and probably the closest to ""Scooby Doo Where are You"". While there is a little too much love drama going on, but the characters development is very good. The monsters/villans are either very creative or very ridiculous...depends on the episode. Overall the series is written very well and if you love Scooby Doo than this is a must have for your collection",1401494400,2,491,4.857142857142857
5813760,5,B00DHS8N3S,"Being a 21 year old, I was fearing that this reboot would be too obnoxious/ridiculous/cartoony to watch, but when I watched the first episode, I was instantly hooked!

It certainly plays homage to the original 'Scooby Do: Where are You?' series in the very first episode when Velma showcases some of the villains from the first series, such as Miner 49er. A whole episode is even dedicated as a homage to The Creeper from the first series. Even younger fans can appreciate references from the surrounding Classic Hannah Barbera cartoons, and my personal favorites from 'The Witchs' Ghost'/'What's New Scooby Doo', The Hex Girls. I also love the classic homages to horror, such as Cthulu, the Mummy, and Fright  Night.
But despite the amazing homages to its own series and horror, it sets its own image with witty writing, humor that reaches all ages, and intriguing plot. To revamp the series, they had the classic 'every episode is a new mystery to trap' ordeal, with a season long mystery regarding a ""Mr. E"". I also applaud the visual quality, and the over-all ""scary-ness"" of the episodes.
My only critique is the stereotypes of each character, particularly Daphne's obsession with Fred, where in multiple episode, she did not feel as a stand-out character, but more of a compliment to Fred's character development.

I think the series wrapped up nicely, but I hope they bring it back!

TL;DR: this revamp can certainly be enjoyed by all ages, particularly avid Scooby Doo fans!",1399939200,7,1482,4.916

5813762,5,B00DHS8N3S,"No spoilers, just generalities.

Mystery Incorporated is easily the best of the various Scooby Doo series.  The visuals and character designs are updated but still easily recognizable.  The stories include both recognition of classic Scooby episodes and series and modern takes on the traditional formula.  There is a central mystery which takes two seasons to resolve, as well as character arcs that take multiple episodes to resolve.

All in all, the series is a modern update to Scooby Doo, both honoring and winking at the classic series.

Enjoy.",1398470400,2,550,5.193181818181818

My children keep asking for it and we find ourselves popping in a disc after they've gone to sleep at night.  As much as we liked the original Scooby Doo, we're enjoying the Mystery Inc. version just as much.  There's a lot of little quips, subtle humor, a good ongoing storyline and all the fun of the original characters.  Probably our only objection would be ... where's the Complete Second Season?",1398297600,4,472,4.7073170731707314

I for one was fairly impressed with the dark tone of it, and the characters get some new additions. In this series, there's an intriguing back story in regards to mysteries Inc. and this series, even animated, does have some creepy scenes to it. But why couldn't this season have been released in one pack to begin with? Well, your guess is as good as mine.

5813770,4,B00DHS8N3S,"This version has continuing storylines, recurring characters, occasional CGI enhancements, and some famous voices. After more than 40 years of this franchise, here comes an 11th incarnation which seems more for adults than kids, which makes sense, because those of us who saw the original as children when it first aired in the late 1960s are now in our 50s. This set contains the first of two seasons of this series, which concluded in April 2013.

The time setting of this new series is hard to figure out. The gang seems to still be in high school, but the vehicles seem pretty contemporary and theres computers and cell phones, and the characters still dress like they're stuck in the 60s. Theres also occasional visual references to villains from past versions of the show.  So the writers have decided to pick and choose what elements to include from Scoobys long history and present them in this new show without any explanation. But does it really matter?

This time around, the human members of the Scooby gang all have parents, who we see occasionally, some more than others. Their main function seems to be to frustrate their offspring, none more than Freds father, who is the mayor of their hometown, Crystal Cove (didnt previous versions reference a hometown of Coolsville?). The animation is more stylized and many of the character designs have been simplified from the classic Scooby versions. For example, Fred seems even more lantern-jawed than before. Fred is also more flawed than before - this time around, hes obsessed with trap making. All the characters seem to be a little more complicated, as do their relationships (theres even drama over a Velma-Shaggy-Scooby love triangle of sorts). Scooby also talks more often and more clearly than in previous versions.

Despite the updates, the gang apparently has still never heard of trespassing or personal property laws, or at least they never let such things hamper their meddling, er mystery solving...

The series ongoing storyline involves a legend of cursed conquistador treasure, Babylonian weirdness, and The Time of Nibiru. Theres an ongoing search for something called a Planispheric Disk, comprised of several pieces which when assembled, will point the way to the cursed treasure beneath the town.  In this version, Crystal Cove had a previous mystery-solving quartet of young people who had a talking animal companion, in this case a purple talking parrot called Professor Peracles, who seems to have since evolved into something more.

Matthew Lillard, who played Shaggy in two live-action Scooby Doo movies, now voices the character in this animated version. Other famous people also lend voices to first-season characters. Linda Cardelini, who played Velma in the live action films, now voices a recurring character with the unlikely name of Hotdog Water, who is very Velma-like, and who might not be entirely what she seems. Patrick Warburton voices Crystal Coves incompetent and emotionally raw Sheriff Bronson Stone (as in dumb as a...). Vivica Fox voices a local DJ named Angel Dynamite, who has some serious skills beyond playing music. Casey Kasem, the original voice of Shaggy, now voices Shaggys father in a few episodes. Other famous voices who show up as characters include: Marion Ross, Dwight Schultz, James Hong, Jeffrey Combs, Harlan Ellison (as himself), Mark Hamill, and George Takei. Another famous contributor is Michael Sweet, previously of the Christian glam metal band Stryper, who composed the shows catchy new title music.

The shows setup includes an evil polluting corporation called Destroydo (subtle, huh?), and there are commonly references from movies, shows, and pop culture including, Vincent Price, wire-fu movies, Gremlins, Johnny Quest, Carrie, Night Rider, and many more. (See what I mean about this series not being aimed primarily at kids?) Theres also a recurring electric guitar musical motif towards the end of several episodes which sounds to me like Totos music from the old David Lynch movie version of Dune. My least favorite episode of this season is one in which Scooby meets Hanna Barbera characters from the 1970s including Speed Buggy and company, Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels, and Jabberjaw. I didn't like those characters and shows then, and now they're even more annoying.

Would it really be much of a spoiler if I told you that every episodes mystery now concludes with a variation on the line from the old Scooby Doo, Where Are You series where the unmasked villain basically says I would have gotten away with it if it hadnt been for you meddling kids and your stupid dog, too?",1389744000,4,4625,5.099075297225892
