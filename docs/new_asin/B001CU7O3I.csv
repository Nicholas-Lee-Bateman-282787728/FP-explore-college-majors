3520110,5,B001CU7O3I,"""Gold Mines"" presents an overview of gold-mining history, as well as current underground vs. open-pit mining.

South African gold mines pursue both the world's richest veins and do so at the deepest levels - 2 miles. Mine temperatures reach 128 degrees w/o cooling, 96 degrees with - at 100% humidity.  (A mine cooling system could instead cool a city of 100,000 people.)  Tunnel facings at that depth are under tremendous pressure and sometimes explode.  Miners take ten minutes descending down the mine elevator to get to their work depth; explosive methane gas is also sometimes a problem.  Mining engineers, meanwhile, are considering even deeper gold mines, probably to be worked by robots.

Early History:  The oldest evidence of gold processing was recently found in Bulgaria - 6,000 year-old sold gold figures.  Egyptians created the first underground mines.  Peruvians created early gold-plating.

Early mining improvements included use of horses to move underground ore, use of water-powered wheels to power hoists.

Early expeditions to the U.S. and the New World were all motivated by gold.  Until 1799 gold mining was done for king and country; after the 1799 gold discovery in North Carolina (17-lb. nugget), gold mining became a matter of personal enrichment.

U.S. mining began as placer mining, then moved underground when the easy sources played out.  The Sutter's Mill strike in California brought miners from all over the world.

Hydraulic mining of river banks created large-scale pollution and was banned in California in 1884.  The 1850 Comstock Lode mine discovery led to square beam supports for interior walls and the devastation of large sections of forest.  Comstock Lode miners took a break every half-hour and were allotted 95 pounds of ice/day.

Compressed-air drills allowed much faster progress, but were also known as ""widow-makers"" because dust created led to serious lung diseases.  Fortunately, water was added to the drills about ten years later.

The Alaskan/Yukon Gold rush of 1896 quickly played out the rich ore, leaving low-grade (1 oz./22 tons) requiring crushing, stamping, and refining with mercury and cyanide.

Deregulating the price of gold in 1968 led to new vast open-pit mines and refineries that profitably processed ore for the 1 oz./45 tons of ore, and cost $200,000-$1 billion to create.",1223337600,4,2343,5.278378378378378
3520111,5,B001CU7O3I,"""The World's Fastest"" takes viewers through a brief summary of record-setting speed records on the earth's surface - both land and water.  Each vignette portrays not only the record-setting feat, but also earlier versions as long as a century prior.

The first story is that of the world's fastest production car - the Swedish CCR that hit 241 mph on an oval track with its 806 horsepower V-8 and mostly carbon-fiber body.  Cost - $590,000, and it beat the seven-year-old record of 240 mph.

Then its the 270 mph Shanghai maglev train developed in Germany.  The train's cars are lifted by electromagnetic fields created by magnets under the cars and the track.  No rails, wheels, onboard driver, nor locomotive is used.  Construction took three years for a 20-mile track.

Not as fast, but still impressive is the older Japanese electric Bullet Train that reaches 186 mph.

Jet powered speedboat racing is quite dangerous due to waves and wind unexpectedly lifting the superfast and relatively light boats.  The current record-holding boat (317 mph) was built in its owner's Australian backyard of plywood, using jet engines bought at auction for $60.  This record has remained intact for a number of years.

The fastest roller coaster exists in N.J. and takes riders to 128 mph and through brief periods of weightlessness.  Five-hundred foot high cranes were utilized in its construction.  Its launch technology was borrowed from aircraft carriers, the the coaster is braked at the end of the ride by magnetic fields.

Finally, viewers get to the fastest ride on earth - the rocket-powered sleds at Holloman AFB in New Mexico.  ""Slippers"" instead of wheels are used to hold the sleds onto the rails, which themselves are aligned to within 25 thousandths of an inch over its nearly ten-mile length.  Using four rocket stages, a top speed of 6,453 mph was achieved while creating forces of 150 g's; no living entity can survive such forces.",1220486400,,1939,4.972049689440993
3520112,5,B001CU7O3I,"""The Lumberyard"" begins with a short tour of a modern lumberyard processing the rough output from a sawmill.  Thirty-foot blades, power planers and molders transform the wood into attractive, ready-to-install material.

The DVD then moves onto to lumberyards that specialize in recycled/reclaimed wood from barns, old homes, and pilings - attractive because of their unique appearances.

Colonial lumberyard tools are illustrated (incredibly labor-intensive), and their role in supplying shipyards and the growing railroad industry outlined.  I was surprised to learn that until lately, the San Francisco Bay area was a major lumberyard location.

A recent innovation is that of engineered woods, though plywood actually dates back to the Egyptians who used pegs to hold the sheets together.  Plywood's strength derives from alternate layers placed at right angles to each other. Oriented-strand wood, comprised of shredded wood, arranged approximately parallel and again in layers at right-angles to each other, is replacing much plywood and making use of pieces that used to become scrap.

Most interesting of all is ""glu-lam"" - long, large pieces such as beams and trusses comprised of wood layers glued to each other and then joined via finger joints.  The output is quite impressive and ready to install at the job site.

Next, ""The Lumberyard"" shows us so-called exotic woods - mahogany, teak, rosewood, etc.  Finally, its on to woods coming from rather exotic sources - eg. logs sunk up to 100 years in the Great Lakes (preserved by the cold water, and also uniquely colored) and located through sonar.  The record, however, is held by New Zealand bogs (also providing a preservative shield) holding huge kauri logs that are no longer commercially available.  It offers rich gold and cognac colors and a finish that is luminous and glistens as if lit from within; pieces are up to 12' wide.",1220400000,4,1897,5.245033112582782

They go through all the topics that you'd expect: stoning, gas chambers, Old Sparky, fire squads, etc.  You can learn things here.  Only six countries still allow hanging.  The guillotine was last used in the 1930s.  They mention executioners, including those who used dull blades.  Christians being fed to the lions for Roman crowds comes up.  Still, they never speak of lynchings used for racist reasons; this oversight can be read as disturbing.  I saw an MM installment about weapons like nuclear bombs and poisonous gases.

3520145,4,B001CU7O3I,"This whole series uses the term ""modern"" very lightly.  I mean, there's an episode on the Egyptian pyramids too.  I think they use ""modern"" because scholars are using new techniques to study these old structures.

I learned some good stuff here.  Hadrian never saw the completion of the wall.  There are only two Roman references to the wall in ancient writings.  The British of the Dark Ages didn't even know the Romans built it.  The best part of the work is when a scholar says, ""People are amazed when we pull sandals from the wall, but we have about 2,000 pairs of sandals from our excavations.""

The work doesn't mention Stonehenge or the Great Wall of China.  One scholar made it sound like the Romans  consciously decided to no longer expand their empire.  I'm skeptical of that.  Rome began regulating itself and citizens more than pursuing outer goals.  I think they may have softened/fudged the facts to keep a certain demographic from getting upset.

I always assumed the wall was in the south of the UK, but this work made it sound like it's near Scotland.  In the same way that modern Americans knew the best place to put the Panama Canal, the Romans knew the best place, which was the shortest distance from the English Channel to the Irish Sea.  That's phenomenal cartography or measuring for 2,000 years ago!

The wall itself is quite dull-looking.  Still, this is one of my favorite episodes in the series.  I recommend it.",1332979200,,1441,4.692
3520146,3,B001CU7O3I,"The work stated that when Ortzi man, a 5,000-year-old corpse, was found, he was wearing waterproof, leather boots.  The program later states that leather products on the Titanic survived the sinking undamaged.  The work shows Europeans, Native Americans, East Asians, and others making leather products to prove what a universal item this is.

The work focuses on leather production.  It shows modern techniques before the ancient or classic ones.  Perhaps this is why this item is called ""modern"" in the series.  WARNING!: This is not about ""leather culture.""  There is no mention of Tom of Finland or Frankie Goes to Hollywood anywhere here.

What's great is that the work also speaks about the downside of leather.  It states that producing leather creates a lot of toxic materials.  In older times, leather makers could only work on the edge of town for that reason.  They give an upbeat spin saying some of the toxins can now be used as fertilizer.  Then it says alligators in the US almost went extinct in the 1960s due to leather purchasers.  Again, the positive spin is that they are now up in numbers and off the endangered species list.

The program expands things by talking about the other animals whose skin can be used for leather, besides cows.  It then says while nylon has replaced silk, non-animal leather products have never replaced real leather.  The fake stuff doesn't ""breathe.""

This work did want to make me buy some leather, but I'm too poor for that right now.",1324080000,,1487,4.837301587301587
3520147,3,B001CU7O3I,"One time a friend called me a Mariah Carey fan.  As I was about to protest, I thought about how excited I get when I see her videos or hear about her in the news.  Similarly, I didn't identify as one of the millions who are facinated by the Titanic and its sinking, yet when I hear about a new Titanic documentary, I always want to see it.  So, yes, I admit that I can never learn to much about the tragedy, so I grew from seeing this documentary.

This work basically works from the outside of the ship inward and up.  It speaks about the metal on the outside of the ship long before it talks about the ornate staircase or stuff like that.  After it speaks about the ship's making, it almost instantly jumps into the iceberg ahead.  I don't think the title of this doc is deceptive, but if you expect to see a poor, little rich girl or the Unsinkable Molly Brown, you will be disappointed.

Here are things that were new to me.  It wasn't just about not having sufficient lifeboats for aesthetic reasons; the work said lifeboats are meant to be temporary vessels.  One would assume that lifeboats would take a handful of people from one ship to another and then go back for another load.  James Cameron's epic film ignores the issue of the Morse code typer telling other ships not to bother him.  Here, however, they say the Morse code device was inoperative for about six hours, which backlogged messages.  Even when Titanic was sending its distress signal, other ships would have had trouble hearing it.  I saw a Titanic doc that said if the rivets binding the ship together weren't so cheap, then the tragedy would not have occurred.  This work says that even with perfect rivets, it would have.  In the film, Victor Garber's character says, ""The ship has 5 sunk compartments and it can't stay afloat with more than 4.""  This work said 6 compartments were flooded.  I learned that the ship had a Turkish bath and a huge swimming pool, but only for the first class.  In fact, the first class passengers could use the elevators, but the third-class could not.  (I don't think this work ever refers to them as ""stearage."")  In fact, it said the third-class couldn't even use the bathtubs aboard the ship, but since they bathed only weekly, that wouldn't have bothered them.

The doc spends the last few minutes speaking about the regulations that were immediately set so the tragedy would not occur again.  The ship's company even took some ships off the market after the accident.  It rebuilt many others, despite the heavy costs of improvements.

If you can't get enough about the 1912 controversy, and have come to terms that you are fascinated, then you should see this doc, for your edification.",1322784000,,2701,4.5654885654885655

3520150,4,B001CU7O3I,"I stumbled across this documentary on Netflix and I'm really glad I gave it a try.  It was incredibly interesting to hear about the design of the super highway and how there are curves and changes in elevation to keep driver's alert.  It's amazing to think that a highway that has many sections with absolutely no maximum speed limit that it's one fo the safest in the world.  In fact, you are ticketed for driving too slow.  There is a price for speed, however.  A German driver's license costs between $1500 and $2000 US dollars.  The one thing that police officers focus on is aggressive driving.  There are cops stationed along the highway and video cameras placed inconspicuously along the highway to ticket drivers who tailgate, yell at another driver($500 minimum fine), cut someone off, or make frequent hazardous lane changes.  Ticket  fines are based on a sliding scale of wealth.  The more you earn, the higher the ticket.  There was a report of a wealthy driver who received a ticket in the amount of $21,000 US dollar equivalent for tailgating.  You will learn that German drivers take their driving seriously, as you must, driving at such high rates of speed.  Therefore, there is no need for cup holders or mirrors on the visor.  German drivers are too busy concentrating to eat or drink, put on make-up or talk on their cell phones while driving.  That, in itself reduces fatalities.
Hitler did many horrendous things during his reign over the Nazi party, but one thing he did to help Germany boost it's economy was to begin work on his dream of the autobahn.  When Eisenhower returned from WWII, it was his suggestion that the US begin work on an interstate system.

3520153,5,B001CU7O3I,"""Ice Breakers"" takes viewers from early polar explorations with reinforced-hull wooden sailing ships to today's computer-controlled 13,000+ ton 2"" thick reinforced hull constructed of special steel made for low-temperature strength. Some have the capability of injecting a large volume of bubbles under the ice, or rocking back and forth (shifting water from one ballast tank to another) to help break up the ice. Most of the heavy-duty ice breaking comes from the heavy ship riding up onto thick ice and then breaking it from the heavy weight - not from simply plowing into it. Yet, especially thick (over 8') or hard ice (eg. several years old - salt leaches out over time, creating greater strength) may require repetitive 'ramming' - back and forth about 1 - 2 ship lengths to succeed. Strengthening and protecting the propellers, or replacing them with electrically-driven steerable pods under the ship (also eliminates the need for a rudder) is important. Propulsion systems in today's icebreakers include standard diesel, diesel-electric, turbine, and nuclear (Russian).

The major use for U.S. icebreakers is aiding in the supply of researchers at the two polar regions. European nations, including Russia, use icebreakers for the support of normal living in the northern-most areas.",1253664000,,1291,5.391089108910891

3520163,5,B001CU7O3I,"""The Autobahn"" tells the story of Germany's Autobahn and explains why, despite having a lower death rate than U.S. Interstates, has no speed limits on nearly half its length.  One scene in the program included an auto modification shop testing its product - 212 mph at night, with three occupants.

Original portions of the Autobahn were built between 1933-1942, primarily as a public works activity.  Its curves were banked and gentle, and the median was guarded by double-sided crash barriers (vs. single in the U.S.).  Mostly built by hand until 1938, one-third its cost was spent on bridges.  Surprisingly, the Autobahn had little military value for Germany (railroads were much more important - particularly since they readily linked into other nations), though the U.S. Army found it helpful.

Why is the Autobahn safer than U.S. Interstates?  Reasons include a smoother surface (27"" thick, vs. 11"" in the U.S.), less multi-tasking (driver drinking and eating, cell-phoning), strict enforcement of a ""drive right, pass left"" rule, mandated driver training, more expensive licenses ($1,500-$2,000), and a police focus on tailgating.

Today much of the Autobahn is clogged with heavy traffic, especially during peak hours.  Those locations have speed limits - set by computers according to conditions as of the moment.  Traffic is further alleviated by freeing up the breakdown lane for trucks during heavy traffic - if cameras show the lane is clear.

Police cars and motorcycles have video cameras that help quickly resolve court disputes.  Fines vary according to income - a rich tailgater was recently fined $20,000.  Fines for obscene gestures are also handed about, averaging about $500.

Montana's Interstates formerly were the U.S. equivalent of the Autobahn - ""reasonable and prudent"" was the limit.  This stopped in 1998.

Producers of ""The Autobahn"" see its speed-limit free future threatened by Germany's ""Green Party"" - they're concerned that mpg at 120 mph is about half that at 60 mpg; however, most believe the Germans' love of speed will continue to win out.",1224288000,,2079,5.254545454545455
3520164,3,B001CU7O3I,"""Brewing"" provides a somewhat interesting, though largely repetitive, history of brewing with an emphasis on the U.S.

The Budweiser brewery in St. Louis produces 16 million barrels of beer/year.  Barley is soaked in warm water until it begins to germinate, then it is roasted.  Etc., etc., until after aging in a storage tank for 21 days its poured into cans, bottles, and kegs.

The earliest evidence of brewing dates back 3,500 years in what now is Iran.  Beer became a form of liquid bread, a means of storing grain after harvesting.  Eventually brewing spread to Europe where it was also appreciated for being cleaner than water.  ""Brewing"" also identifies a German brewery that has been functioning since 1040, dating back to when the site was also a monastery.

Viewers then receive an overview of the fine points of differences in various beers - lagers, ales, pilsners, etc., as well as the introduction in the U.S. of refrigeration, ice cars, pasteurization, bottles and caps.

In 1880 there were 2,300 breweries in the U.S.  Prohibition brought this down to 160.  However, after microbreweries (1970s) and home brewers began, we now have 1,400.

History Channel or Amazon.  This issue needs to be addressed.  I am seeing this on a lot of Modern Marvel DVDs.  P.S.  I did purchase Lumberyard due to the one single review.",1525478400,,427,4.467532467532467

8289408,2,B001CU7O3I,"This documentary has some great historical information that is worth everyone in America knowing about; however, when they make the statement several times that the scientists developing products from oil, and miners following their own greed to do anything necessary to find oil at a time when just about anyone with some backing could drill a well did as much to win the war as any soldier fighting on the front lines...they lose my support completely. I am a soldier who fought in the Infantry in Viet Nam and I can tell you this: creating new products in a lab has nothing to do with getting shot at and putting your life in danger. The guy who told them to put that in this documentary was probably the egotistical old jerk who kept appearing in this film to tell his version of successful greed.",1468022400,,801,4.569444444444445
