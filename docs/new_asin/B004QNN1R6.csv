8438313,5,B004QNN1R6,Great Bluray,1422748800,,12,5.5
8438314,5,B004QNN1R6,If you weren't there - this is the best you can get.  Up there with another great Farewell Concert (Crowded House).  Even if you're not a fan - you will enjoy this.,1394323200,,164,4.09375
8438315,5,B004QNN1R6,"This was not only the best Simply RED concert, all of the songs were excellent and more importantly, the sound quality was excellent.",1388793600,,133,4.826086956521739
8438316,2,B004QNN1R6,"In case of concerts like this, picture is the last thing to be bothered by. There aren't any outstanding effects, so eye isn't the first to be satisfied. Ears are those who shoud enjoy the most. When it comes to the soud, it's quite well. But who's gonna explain me who's singing backing vox (especially female ones on ""Out on the range""), and on Jercho, and many other songs. Is it completely live since I can hear back vox and see no one sing them ? That's what bothers me. Well, when I occasionally hear the trumpet I'm aware it's live, but isn't it better to put onstage three beautiful ladies with even more beautiful voices to do all the backing vox, than sampling ?",1383350400,,672,4.384
8438317,5,B004QNN1R6,A wonderful goodbye concert for Simply Red. Nice song choices and well rounded show. A must for all Simply Red Fans.,1373760000,,116,4.571428571428571
8438318,5,B004QNN1R6,Simply Red is one of my all time favorites and this is a wonderful addition to my DVDS collection of his work.,1361750400,,110,4.045454545454546
8438319,1,B004QNN1R6,"I just wanted to add my name to what must be a very long list of dissapointed buyers of: Simply Red: Farewell - Live in Concert at Sydney Opera House (on Blu-Ray) it is without a doubt the worst quality Blu-Ray not even close to DVD, quality more like VHS !
Still and always will be a huge fan of Simply Red and Mick !",1359072000,,318,3.9076923076923076
8438320,1,B004QNN1R6,"Not even close to a DVD quality!
Just forget this ""BLURAY"", and buy the DVD format one. Hope the Sicily Concert comes soon on BluRay!",1333497600,3,133,4.36
8438321,2,B004QNN1R6,"The concert itself is good. Simply red never let's you down, but goodness...for a blue ray disc is much better video-quality to expect. This brd doesn' even meassure up with an average videotape as most of us played 20 years ago and longer...London, Cuba  and Sicaly are much better options. I am afraid I will not put this on very often.",1324857600,2,338,4.540983606557377
8438322,3,B004QNN1R6,"Nice concert, but a little below my expectations specially considering the occasion and to the youtube videos of the last concert in London...

Poor video quality for a BluRay; I would say that buying it in DVD would give you the same sound/video quality for a better price!",1308528000,4,274,4.708333333333333
