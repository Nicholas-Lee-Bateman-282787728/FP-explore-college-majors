7825703,4,6302453119,"1953's EASY TO LOVE captures Esther Williams at the very peak of her film career, and was one of the star's personal favourites.  I also believe it features Ms Williams at her most beautiful, in some of the loveliest clothes she ever wore.

Williams plays Julie Hallerton, a Cypress Gardens swimmer and model, trying, quite unsuccessfully, to gage the romantic interests of her workaholic boss Ray Lloyd (Van Johnson).  During an unexpected whirlwind trip to New York, which Ray promises will be a pleasure trip but turns out to be anything but, Julie meets Broadway star Barry Gordon (Tony Martin), who offers Julie bigger job opportunities, not to mention the chance for romance.  Firmly wedged in a love triangle, exactly who will win Julie's heart?

EASY TO LOVE presented a few new challenges for the statuesque swimming star - namely a big skiing finale.  Williams wasn't a skier, and quickly learned that, despite her strong swimmer's muscles, she'd have to go right back to the drawing board and start from scratch.  Consummate professional that she was, Williams performed the skiing duties, except for one terrifying stunt, dreamt up by choreographer Busby Berkeley, which would have required Williams to dive off a helicopter's trapeze swing, suspended 80 feet above the water at Cypress Gardens.  Williams was in the early stages of a pregnancy and, fearful for her unborn child, requested a stunt double for that sequence.

Whilst Williams reigned supreme in the water, musical duties were handled by Tony Martin in his best fashion, including several memorable numbers - ""Look Out! I'm Romantic"", ""Didja Ever"", ""Coquette"", ""Easy to Love"" and ""That's What a Rainy Day is For"", the latter shared with a group of delightful elderly ladies.  Martin's wife Cyd Charisse also has a fun unbilled appearance in the last scene.

Williams always looked glamorous and well-put together on the screen, but the clothes she wears in this film are really something else.  Starting off with a deliciously frou-frou lilac Cypress Gardens hostess gown, Williams later sports a series of luxurious evening gowns, not to mention a stunning white lace peignoir set.  Designer Helen Rose was noted for her romantic, ultra-feminine clothes and worked closely with her assigned actresses, taking care to complement their colouring.  The clothes in EASY TO LOVE flatter Ms Williams extremely well.

For a ""swimmingly"" good time, you can't go past EASY TO LOVE.",1375660800,3,2449,5.133501259445844
7825704,5,6302453119,Esther Williams is always awesome to watch.  This movie is a time capsule with Florida's Cypress Gardens show and the scenes set in a New York nightclub.  Enjoyed the vintage clothing and excellent supporting cast.,1373328000,,214,5.085714285714285
7825705,3,6302453119,"Julie Hallerton (Esther Williams) is a model at a ritzy resort who works night and day for her demanding boss Ray Lloyd (Van Johnson). She is tired and feels mistreated, so she demands a vacation. Ray relents and takes her to New York-- to work. Furious, Julie attempts to secure a new job with singer Barry Gordon (Tony Martin) who takes a romantic interest in her.

But Julie can't accept Barry's offer because she's in love with Ray in spite of the way he treats her. She returns to him, hoping he'll one day grow to love her too. Barry won't take no for an answer, so he follows her and does his best to win her heart.

This movie is mildly entertaining, but it is frustrating to see the protagonist being dumped on constantly. Martin's performance is somewhat creepy, so his romantic scenes with Williams are uncomfortable to watch. Johnson plays a selfish pig, so it is difficult to like him either. Overall, the reason to watch this film is for the fantastic aquatic sequences, especially the grand finale directed by Busby Berkeley. The man was a genius.",1296172800,2,1062,4.613756613756614
