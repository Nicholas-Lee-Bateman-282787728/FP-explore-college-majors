8480751,4,B005NRNCEG,"Jones vs Rampage, Hughes vs Koscheck, and Diaz vs Gomi were all fights that I wanted to see and I thought they turned out great! Overall from top to bottom the card was a good one. If you're buying this just for the main events only, they all three were excellent fights.",1339632000,,271,4.230769230769231
8480752,4,B005NRNCEG,"So, there's a NEW UFC Light Heavyweight Champion, and his name is Jon Jones! Anybody have something to say about that? Well, those that do are lining up, and ""Rampage"" Jackson is first in line to go for what used to be his belt. He's got no respect for Jon Jones, because he thinks Jones has his head up his ass. Jones has a goal in mind, and that goal is to MAKE Rampage respect him after he beats him. That is the Main Event for UFC 135.

The Co-Main Event was Matt Hughes taking on Josh Koscheck. Hughes sees Koscheck as a self-promotor, while Koscheck is looking forward to taking Hughes out. Would this actually get interesting, or would this one go quickly?

There was a time or two where this got a little bit dumb, but not a whole lot. I enjoyed most of this event, and I'll list the 10 fights featured!

James Te Huna vs. Ricardo Romero: Both of these guys had impressive debuts, both finished their opponents. But before this, Te Huna got finished quick by Alexander Gustafsson, and Romero got finished even quicker by Kyle Kingsbury. This ends with a KO before it goes even a minute!

Cole Escovedo vs. Takeya Mizugaki: Both of these guys bring it, come to fight, and love putting on a show. This is a good scrap that ends with a 2nd round TKO.

Eddie Yagin vs. Junior Assuncao: This really pissed me off! The weigh-in for this fight was more exciting than the fight itself. Not exactly the way you want fans to remember you coming back into the UFC for Assuncao, and Yagin at least tried to make something out of his UFC debut. Unanimous decision for the winner. Who cares? I didn't!

Nick Ring vs. Tim Boetsch: After squeaking out a decision win that a lot of people thought he lost, Nick Ring DOMINATED his last fight, eventually getting a finish. Tim Boetsch looked incredible against Kendall Grove, and is ready for his 2nd step in the Middleweight division. This is a great fight, and an impressive unanimous decision the whole way around!

Tony Ferguson vs. Aaron Riley: Both of these guys looking to make a statement. Riley want to show the new TUF Winner how a real veteran hangs in there. Ferguson wants to give Riley a dose of ""El Cucuy,"" just like he did to everybody else on the show. At the end of the 1st round, a broken jaw gives one man no choice but to pack it up and fight another day. But it was a great scrap!

Nate Diaz vs. Takanori Gomi: If anybody would know how to fight Gomi, it would be Nick Diaz's brother, TUF 5 Winner, Nate. You think I'm kidding? Not to be the spoiler, but just saying that a 1st round display of brilliance, topped off with a submission should be more than obvious who won this fight!

Travis Browne vs. Rob Broughton: These guys have fought hard, and know how to win, but this isn't the most impressive win out there. One man simply gets the job done with a unanimous decision. It wasn't anywhere near as bad as the Assuncao fight, I can at least say that much for this one.

Ben Rothwell vs. Mark Hunt: I think everybody had to know if Hunt's fight before this one was simply a one-hit wonder. Rothwell didn't exactly look impressive against Yvel, but he won. Despite this not being what you might think it could've been, it was impressive. And the winner deserved the unanimous decision he got!

Matt Hughes vs. Josh Koscheck: Ok, yes, this was a 1st round KO. Not exactly that impressive, because it was expected. But that's what he wanted. And that's what he got!

Jon Jones vs. Rampage Jackson: WOW! The best of both guys, and it ended with a submission in the 4th round! This fight was enjoyable, it was FIGHT OF THE NIGHT, and I could watch this time and time again and not get bored!

So, what can I say? Check this out! You won't be completely disappointed, unless, of course, you can simply never be pleased with anything. I enjoyed most of it. It doesn't always have to be perfect, which is why I gave it 4 stars.",1330214400,,3885,4.3717059639389735
8480753,5,B005NRNCEG,As long as there are 3 finishes on the Main card and 3 finishes on the Under card. It is a good event to me. As long the finish wasn't by DQ.,1327795200,2,141,3.4375
8480754,3,B005NRNCEG,"UFC 135 was a showcase of their newest Champion Jon Jones versus an Icon of the sport Rampage Jackson.  Jones was on the rise since he entered the UFC by displaying a unique and exciting skillset. At this point in 2011 he had beaten another serious prospect Ryan Bader at UFC 126 before winning the Lightweight championship in defeating Shogun Rua (known mostly as an icon from the Japanese promotion Pride) at UFC 128 .  Now Jones was facing Rampage Jackson (also an icon from Pride as well as a former UFC Lightweight champion) who had recently defeated former UFC Lightweight Champion Lyoto Machida at UFC 130. Also add in some trash talking and a little controversy about Jones having a spy in Rampage's camp and it was set up well. SPOILERS AFTER THIS.

In my opinion the main event was well worth the hype and it was Jones most calculated victory. He obviously respected Rampage's power and was quick to avoid his power shots and counter. He used his long reach well and slowly tired Rampage out. Rampage had some good moments but if it had gone to points I am sure Jones would have won. Beyond that I won't say much else as you will have to watch for yourself.

For the remainder of the fights I always think of each event not in just the main card but every fight on the card including the prelims on Facebook and Spike. For UFC 135 I would say there were some good fights and others not so good. Other standouts of the night include a quick match with Josh Koscheck (a late replacement) vs. Matt Hughes (the Hall of Famer), Nate Diaz vs. Takanori Gomi (a former top pound for pound Lightweight), Takeya Mizugaki vs.  Cole Escovedo and Tony Ferguson (recent Ultimate Fighter winner) vs.  Aaron Riley. My least favorite fights were actually on the main card which included the heavyweight match-ups Travis Browne vs.  Rob Broughton and Ben Rothwell vs.  Mark Hunt. The reason is these fights were very slow and the fighters got tired early in the fights. I know it was in Colorado and the air is higher there (which does not play well for heavyweights) but these were hard to watch.

In any event if you are new to UFC or MMA its one to watch to say you saw it.",1323907200,2,2168,4.454545454545454
