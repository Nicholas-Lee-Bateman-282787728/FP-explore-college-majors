7921233,1,B00004REJ4,I thought I was getting a video about St Saens and it was a poorly done video on animals and even the music wasn't good. Huge disappointment. I would have sent it back but I had opened it.,1371340800,,188,3.973684210526316
7921234,4,B00004REJ4,"I got this video used and we really liked it. It has ""Radar"", from Mash, (can't think of name), reciting poetry about different animals, great classical music, with the musicians shown playing their instruments and great footage of animals in the zoo, dinosaur bones in a museum, etc. Lots of real footage of kids and adults and animals. I'd recommend this.",1223596800,,357,4.868852459016393
