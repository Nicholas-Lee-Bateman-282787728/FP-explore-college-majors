8585353,3,B00005ASO9,"The second DVD about fishing that I know exists and  consequently own. This is in contrast to the DVD  ""Fishing with John"" a serious DVD about walleye and  smallmouth bass fishing. The video quality is well.. video (not to bad) but appereantly overexposed at some shoots. Two videos are on this discs which has proper DVD menus. One video is about walleye fishing  in spring and summer and also goes in to midrange  water fishing. The second video is about smallmouth fishing near spawn beds, pre spawn fishing and fishing after cold  fronts. The music score sometimes got on my nerves since it was not always in tune.  What I didn't liked about this DVD was the lack of detailed info about the fishing tactics and lures that where used. The guy who fished also used the word  ""this is a good fish"" about a thousand times. I have seen other fishing programs about fishing with a lot more quality and content than this one. That said I must also say that this is the second fishing DVD around at this time and this is the best you will get now. The video quality is not to bad and the DVD menu's are easy to navigate.
I hope that some other companies will finally issue some proper fishing DVD's on the market (with some better quality please).  I find it hard to believe that I am the only fishing nut waiting for this to happen.",990748800,17,1329,4.391836734693878
