1421961,5,B00005BCKK,What a nice story and good performance by the actors.  Jon Bon Jovi can act.  He is entertaining in this movie.,1074643200,4,111,4.238095238095238
1421962,5,B00005BCKK,Jon Bon Jovi is soooooooooooooo sexy. Especially in the opening scene where he goes shirtless. And his acting in this movie is really good.,1074124800,7,139,4.833333333333333
1421963,4,B00005BCKK,"Row Your Boat is a very moving film. The cast played their parts very well. In particular, I thought Jon Bon Jovi was excellent. He plays the part of the main character, a poor, homeless, ex-con who is trying to get back on his feet. He plays the part so well; it is as if the movie is more about an actual person rather than just a movie. The movie is a little hard to follow because different scenes are cut in different places (you can tell by the actors' clothes), which is a bit annoying. There is a nice sense-of-humor in this movie. It is a little weird, but if you are not too rigid, you will laugh and have a good time watching this film. To sum up, the acting is great, the story is great, and when these factors are put together, it makes for a great film. Row Your Boat is a movie that I watched more than once, and would recommend to others whom I think would/could appreciate it.",1053475200,11,893,4.137931034482759
1421964,5,B00005BCKK,"This is just a real good film from Jon,probably one of my faves (comparing with others from Jon).It's a sweet story full of emotion and Jon really makes a good performance on it,the role just suits him. There's some others good films in which, thought Jon do good,the role he plays doesn't suit with his own character,in this case it does,you can realize there's part of him on it,and there's a feeling on this film difficult to explain,couln't help of crying at the end. You gotta get the video if you want to know what I'm saying...",1028332800,9,534,4.515463917525773
1421965,4,B00005BCKK,"I purchased this movie purely knowing that Jon Bon Jovi had a lead roll.  Being from Australia this movie is not available here, so I purchased it through Amazon blind, knowing very little about it (pretty risky).  Jon is pretty convincing as an ex con trying to go the straight and narrow.  Mixed in with a soppy love story is always a winner with me.  Highly recommended viewing, those dreamy blue eyes just reel you in, if nothing else the perve value was worth the extra cost (with the exchange rate being so poor).  I'm happy to have this movie in my home movie collection.",1004832000,18,578,4.466666666666667
1421966,5,B00005BCKK,"When I watched this movie, Jon Bon Jovi's great performance made me forget that he was an international rock-star! His great performance as a homeless ex-con in this film made me think of him as a bona-fide actor, and nothing else. His acting, along with the good story-line, is what sells this film. The story depicts a true-to-life drama that is not overshadowed by exorbitant special-effects or other ubsurdities. I believe this is the reason why it did not receive the recognition it deserves; it wasn't marketable to today's public. However, please do not let this stop you from buying, or at the very least, renting this film. The story is awesome, the support cast is great, and the lead role played by Jon Bon Jovi will make you sympathize with his situation. Personally, this film may just be the stepping stone for Jon Bon Jovi into a great film career. You do not want to miss this film, and above all, you do not want to miss Jon's performance.",999734400,28,956,4.629411764705883
1421967,3,B00005BCKK,"Iv'e only seen the VHS version of this, but it's a good film, that should have got some kind of Cinema Release. It's got a good story line, and some good performances, especially from Jon Bon Jovi, who continues to impress as an Actor. If only somebody would take a decent shot on him, and give him a role in a film with a budget. The only thing that let's this film down is the slightly improbable ending, but if you like a bit of a weepy, this films for you.",987897600,9,460,4.065934065934066
1421968,5,B00005BCKK,"Sollance Mitchell (writer of Sundance Film Festival's 1992 Grand Jury Prize Winner, ""In The Soup"") brings us a rich story of redemption and unrequited love. JAMEY MEADOWS (Jon Bon Jovi) is freshly released from Rikers Island prison after taking the fall for his burglar brother, GIL (William Forsythe). Back in Manhattan, Jamey is determined to lead a new crime-free life and to become a productive citizen.
Jamey loses his first job when he stands up to his racist boss. Broke and homeless, Jamey is forced to clean windshields on Houston Street for money. He encounters Gil and his girlfriend, PATTI, driving in their luxury car. Gil, a church-going burglar who prides himself on being non-violent, feels a fatherly responsibility to Jamey desperately needs money, he rejects Gil's pleas to help him rob stores again - but Jamey's weakening.
Jamey lands a job as a New York City census taker and slowly saves money to get out of his homeless shelter. He meets and falls in love with CHUN HUA (Bai Ling), a beautiful, young Chinese woman. To spend time with her, Jamey pretends that he's a successful writer and becomes her English teacher. He discovers that to support her baby, Chun Hua has married LIU WEI-YAN, a cruel, elderly Chinese businessman who treats her only as a showpiece. Chun Hua longs to return to her baby's father, an improverished graduate student in China.
Meanwhile, Gil is trying to save his wife from TONY LO FAT, a Chinese gangster to whom Gil owes $50,000. Gil goes after Jamey to steal Chun Hua's keys and rob her rich husband's townhouse for the money. Jamey refuses and stalls Gil with a fake house key. Nonetheless, Gil breaks in and kidnaps Chun Hua's baby as ransom for the money he owes to Tony Lo Fat.
In the film's thrilling climax, Jamey steals the baby back from Gil, but not without terrible consequences. While escaping with the baby in a dinghy on the Hudson River, Jamey loses his own life. Just before he dies, Jamey hides an airline ticket to Beijing, purchased with his saving money, underneath the baby's clothes. He has given Chun Hua and her baby a way back to China. The film closes poignantly with Chun Hua teaching Jamey's favorite childhood song, ""Row Your Boat,"" to her baby as they board the airplane.",987638400,10,2255,4.7698209718670075

1421982,5,B00005BCKK,This was a really good movie.  I was surprised at how good of an actor Jon Bon Jovi did.  He seemed like a natural at it.  The story line was sweet and touching.  I would highly recommend it.,1330041600,,191,3.9473684210526314
1421983,5,B00005BCKK,"I had previously read some reviews prior to placing my order.  My expectations were high.  Jon did such an amazing performance in this movie.  From the minute the movie starts and you see him, it seemed as though I was right there.  He drew me in.  I was feeling what his character was going through and dealing with.  Superb job !!!

Jon Bon Jovi astounds me with all his diversified talents. He always delivers, taking you on the journey with him in whatever it is he's doing, ie., music, acting, or his philanthropic work.

Once you have been to his concerts, watched his movies and see all that he does, it seems to inpire you do the best you can at whatever your endeavors are.  To be kinder, reach out and lend a hand to those in need, and above all to love.

Jon is definately one of a kind.",1297123200,2,798,4.26

1421985,5,B00005BCKK,the movie was okay for how more of a simple movie with an okay build up. good for the price that it was.,1260748800,,104,3.5652173913043477
1421986,3,B00005BCKK,"Obviously, this movie has not been edited very well because it is a screener's copy.  I think, actually, that JBJ does some of his best acting because it is so out of character for a rockstar.  There is real tragedy here but the ending is so unrealistic that it takes away from the heartbreak of these two people and the sacrifices one is willing to make for someone you truly love.",1224547200,,382,4.366197183098592
1421987,2,B00005BCKK,"When looking at the cast list for this film, I originally intended to construct my review entirely from lyrics of Jon Bon Jovi songs.  Unfortunately, it turns out that I don't know any Jon Bon Jovi lyrics.  But I suspect that even if I did, no one reading this would recognize them anyway.

In any event, in ROW YOUR BOAT Jon Bon Jovi plays a guy recently released from prison.  He isn't quite ready for the path to the straight and narrow in the newly found freedom he has in New York City.  His hobbies include breaking into people's apartments, drinking their wine, stealing  their peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and then jumping out the fire escape when the owners come home.

However, a chance encounter with his brother pushes him towards improving his lot in life. You see, the brother he went to prison to protect is still mixed up in crime and Mr. Jovi resolves not to follow in those footsteps. Exactly what kind of crimes his brother commits are left a little vague. His antics include breaking into empty Chinese restaurants at night, having a crummy apartment full of boxes and boxes of CD players, and getting pushed around by an Asian gangster with bleached hair. (The Asian gangster, incidentally is named Tony Lo Fat. Which I presume is what you get when you put a Soprano on a diet.)

While sleeping in a homeless shelter, he happens along a US Census official, and gets the bright idea of working for that government department.  In one of the movie's unintentionally fun moments, the frustrated and over-worked federal employee is played by  Thomas Lennon - better known as the cop in the really small shorts in RENO 911.

So Jovi begins his life as a census-taker, which puts him in all manner of apparently funny situations.  At one point, he is forced to shout ""No, I'm not  crack-head!  I work for the United States government!"" at people who refuse to take his clipboard seriously.

Eventually, his job causes him to cross paths with the Chinese immigrant (played by Ling Bai) he will be forced to share awkward and unwieldy romantic dialog with for the rest of the movie.  Yes, apparently, not only will censor-takers count the number of baths and bedrooms you have, they'll also scope you out and presumably take their research back to the big babe-o-meter database back in Washington, DC where they and their decedents will plan generations of inappropriate questioning.

Now, to understand the next bit, you must realize that ROW YOUR BOAT is the kind of romantic movie set in a world very similar to, but ultimately completely different to our Earth.  Using his job, he gains access to her house.  His position allows him to as Bai all kinds of personal questions (none of which are on the official forms, of course).  Using his creepily-gotten information, he then sets himself up as an English teacher (something he has zero experience with) and offers to give her lessons in linguistics for virtually no money.

Is this behavior charming?  Well, apparently it is in movie land.  However, I suspect that the kind of guy who does this sort of thing in real life will one day find himself in a model home full of hidden cameras with Chris Hanson asking him if he wouldn't mind explaining himself.

I digress, but the rest of the film is relatively ordinary anyway.  The main sources of conflict are between Jovi and his brother and also between Bai and her husband.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention above that Jovi is pulling this stuff on a married woman.  I suppose the fact that it's an unhappy marriage to a high ranking member of the Chinese Communist Party gives Jovi a free license to creep.

The film is slightly difficult to watch in places.  I'm honestly not sure if the Digiview Productions version of the disc is edited for content, or the director had a dose of narcolepsy in the editing room.  Scenes (particularly in the first half of the film) tend to jerk around randomly.  In one notable portion, it's unclear whether a shoving match takes place inside or outside.

This odd editing is representative of the film as a whole, particularly the script.  This leaves the actors with very little to work with.  Jill Hennessy has nothing to do as the girlfriend of Jovi's brother.  We can't seem to figure out whether the gangster bother is really playing in the big leagues or not (or just in over his head in a very small racket).  By the end of the movie, Jovi and Bai actually display some romantic chemistry, but the script has no idea what to do with it.

ROW YOUR BOAT is pretty much a waste of time.  The romance is unsure of itself.  The gangster scenes are never as tough or gritty as they need to be.  The film as a whole seems to take itself much more seriously than it has any business doing.  While it's sometimes funny to watch a high-flying movie take a flop, I had very little fun with this train wreck.

(On a personal note, I'd like to extend my condolences to the career of William Forsythe.  This is how he is mentioned on the back cover of the DVD: ""[...] his brother, played by William Forsythe (DICK TRACY, THE ROCK, DEUCE BIGALOW: MALE GIGALO) [...]""  Can you imagine how you'd feel if that was your career trajectory?)",1179792000,,5188,4.598476605005441
1421988,5,B00005BCKK,"I was highly impressed with this movie. Yeah, it was low budget, but sometimes those are the best.

The actors did a outstanding job!!!!!!!

Jon Bon Jovi has come a long way since Moonlight, I just hope that he will continue making great music and great movies, since he has the talent for both.

He was a natural in this one. The story was good, acting was excellent!!!! Throw in some comedy and you have a hit with this one!!!!!

Great job.......Jon........How you doin'....haha!!!!!

I would recommend this movie who enjoys a feel good, do the right thing kinda movie.

Two thumbs up on this one!!!!!",1135382400,6,603,4.6415094339622645

Although he wants to go straight and not be involved with his brother is his crimes, we are introduced to him committing a break in, apparently thinking this was not bad because all he did was eat the food that belonged to another person. We see him homeless and rejecting his brother's offer to join his gang. He tries to make money in various ways, which are at times funny. This includes being a census taker - where we see how people cheat the government. Complicating the situation is that he becomes disappointed and joins his brothers gang and he makes a mistake that may cause the death of his brothers girlfriend.
