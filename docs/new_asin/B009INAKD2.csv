8541936,1,B009INAKD2,"This was totally not what I was expecting. I was hoping to use this DVD to provide additional context for my history lessons on US presidents. Instead it only covers Washington, Lincoln, Kennedy, Clinton, Air Force One and 9/ 11. With Clinton, it only covers his impeachment which I thought was pretty sad . The review on Lincoln and Kennedy was pretty good but again this DVD was very disappointing",1435363200,2,399,4.714285714285714
