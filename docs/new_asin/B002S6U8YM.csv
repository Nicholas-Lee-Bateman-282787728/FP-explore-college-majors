3978326,5,B002S6U8YM,"I can sum it up in one word - WOW!  This DVD is fantastic and is a MUST HAVE for any dancers video library. Ruby has proved to be a master instructor and her dancing is exquisite. And on top of being absolutely amazing, she is such a down-to-earth and generous instructor. I would have bought this DVD for the Pilates-based workout alone, and after going through that extensive warm-up, there was instruction enough to fill a 3-hour workshop!  What I love about the instructional section is that it's so thorough, offering dancers clear postural alignment, and safe progressions to more advanced movements.  And the dance movements and combinations are so much fun to do, my personal favorite is the ""Hip Spin.""  I especially valued the 10-minute back stage warm up, and as if that wasn't generous enough there was a costume tutorial as an added bonus!  This is one DVD that I will go back to again and again and is a permanent favorite in my video library.",1259625600,36,957,4.6390532544378695

Ruby is a great dancer, I had the pleasure to see her live a while back and she blew my mind. I was very excited to learn this DVD was coming out.

The DVD includes a great instructional on floor work, no filler, just lots of good information, and some great extras  including costuming help, a wonderful performance (my only wish is she had worn a color other than red, as it makes her harder to see at some points) and a great in costume warm up.

I will continue to buy DVDs from Cheeky Girls.",1257724800,5,626,4.3247863247863245

3978329,5,B002S6U8YM,"As someone who originally learned to dance back in the early 70's, I'm glad to see floor work make a comeback.

First there is a pilates-based strength workout which is great for core and upper body.  I would have liked to see more emphasis on building strength in the legs as well.

Ruby gives a large enough number of moves that you will be able to create a flow for your own music.  She demonstrates several ways to get up and down from the floor. She even has a dramatic drop that looks a lot less dangerous than the classic turkish drop.  Next there are two ""combos""  which are actually sequences or flows for you to adapt to your own music, one relatively easy, one a little more advanced and dramatic.

She also offers a 10-minute warm-up that you can do in costume for those who perform.  No getting on the floor!

Ruby is a lovely dancer to watch and she definitely vibes with the slow music.

This dvd would be great for anyone interested in American Classic bellydance and could be adapted for tribal-fusion.  Not good for those with weak or damaged knees.",1257120000,54,1067,4.448453608247423

3978333,3,B002S6U8YM,"Okay, so I'm 3/4 through this DVD, and I had to stop and write a review. Ruby is a great dancer with a signature American style, let's just get that out of the way. I feel like Cheeky Girls told her, ""This better be two hours!"", which is why she wasted so much time on the fluff in the beginning. I probably would have picked a more extreme core regimen that didn't take almost an hour. the posture talking was good - I don't always agree with her exhales and inhales, but that's more personal.

Finally, when you get to the actual moves, it's nice to have all of these in a virtual notebook, so I'm glad the DVD exists. I like her talk about ascending and descending, which I am terrible at doing gracefully and not getting my heel caught in my skirt. However, it would be exponentially more beneficial if she had explained FACING the mirror so the individual practicing can do it with her from the same direction as opposed to mirroring and wondering what's going on in the back, which is more important to the practicioner. The viewer likes the front angle; the dancer likes the back. I find myself spending more time looking at the back of her in the mirror, which is only about a fourth of the screenshot.
Well, eventually she wanted to see herself in the mirror, so that made things better. This was a really good DVD to remind you of the vocabulary of movement you can use on the floor, but the really impressive stuff (fluttering while bent over, mayas on your side) are never explained, and it's 50 percent fluff so we could get to 2 hours. The actual moves and the performance are good, though.",1357689600,5,1604,4.4006734006734005
3978334,5,B002S6U8YM,"I like Ruby Beh's work and would pretty much recommend any of her DVDs, but this DVD is a must have if you want to do floorwork.  She breaks everything down so well, so easily, and so gracefully.  I love it.

This DVD is wonderful and I'm all about it, but two things I tend to disagree with: number one, she does these movements on a smooth floor, so you might want to watch it in the kitchen if you can (carpet can be a problem for some of the moves), and number 2: I'm a HUGE fan of knee pads.  I get the whole, dancing in your outfit and doing these moves the way you would perform them - but freaking perform them in opaque genie pants and wear knee pads!

That said, you can't beat this DVD for floor moves!",1339286400,2,713,3.992957746478873
3978335,1,B002S6U8YM,"I was really eager to start FLAWLESS FLOOR WORK when my dvd arrived however, after I began to watch it the instructor was wearing black over her torso.  When she began talking about the abs and obliques I could not see her muscles which left me in the dark.  I didn't get past the first 20 minutes.  Very frustrating.

I received my dvd by SADIE yesterday and I began with her because I could see her muscles and could put my mind in my muscles. Very good work out I'm still sore. I will continue with Sadies dvd.

I may try to fast forward though FLAWLESS FLOOR WORK till I can see the instructors body and can get a visual aid on what she's demonstrating. Otherwise, I'll be sending this one back to amazon for a refund.

3978337,4,B002S6U8YM,"All in all the DVD is great.
Ruby is a lovely instructor and the moves she teaches are beautiful. The extras are good.

My only reasons for not giving it 5 stars is that I found the Pilates strengthening section weak (it's been a while since I did Pilates, I've been unable to train much lately and I had no difficulty following it through at the first run, although IMHO I lack a lot of strength both in core and legs); and that for all the importance she gives to posture etc, Ruby fails to explain some basic concepts, like how she aligns her legs at certain moves (she speaks of the torso but not of her legs and the angle to the mirror is not clear enough), or how to achieve fluid moves such as belly roles or flutters when you're supposedly pushing your belly button in and lying on your back.
Everything she does can be achieved with just some work, but since she puts so much emphasis in Pilates and explaining the history and part of the posture & mechanics for the moves it's a shame she leaves out some points.",1330387200,2,1022,4.268041237113402
3978338,5,B002S6U8YM,"No turkish drop. Or, lebanese-style drop-and-kick on the floor.
However, this is a great compendium of slow floorwork moves- and the performance in the end is tantalizing.
It is not a beginner's dvd- it kind of assumes you are comfortable with all the standard stand-up belly dance moves- however, it does explain in detail all the moves related to how to get to the floor and move there.
Most moves, for example the ondulation to the back while kneeling on the floor is well explained step-by-step. One of the most useful things are tip on how to position your knees or your back in order not to hurt yourself.

It contains an extensive pilates workout which, performed a few times, really improves not only the floorwork but also the standard moves. In fact, doing the isolations on the floor obliges to clean the technique and this turns out
useful also for usual standing up moves.

Instructions are extremely clear, and the video is taken from  a corner in order to always show simultaneously Ruby and her image in the mirror.

There is a lot of material to practice- most parts of the technique sections need far more repetitions than the ones shown on the dvd.",1311724800,6,1167,4.678048780487805

It is thorough without being annoyingly slow. Ruby is personable and friendly without being ditzy. She is no-nonsense without being cold.  The warmup is fantastic. She goes into great detail on the proper way to do things/avoid injury which in a floorwork DVD is vitally important. One wierd twist and kiss your knees goodbye.

Drills! Drills! A complete workout with finger cymbals for belly dancers of all levels</a>&nbsp;by Michele Joyce were kind of a wake-up call for me. I've been a lazy practitioner of belly dance for a couple of years now and, in the last few months, started doing practice for an hour a day. Ruby and Michele are kicking my butt.

I can't do the Pilates strengthening routine all the way through yet, but I'm getting a little better every day. I know this DVD is really for advanced students of the dance, but it gives me something to work toward and challenge myself with. The material on this DVD is inspiring, to say the least, and extremely helpful in getting your body into peak condition. During the Pilates workout, Ruby prompts you to remember your shoulders and obliques almost exactly when you find your attention wandering away from them. She also explains why doing a particular move wrong is bad for your body (par for the course for Cheeky Girls, but not necessarily belly dance instruction DVDs in general) and what the wrong move looks like.

One thing that every buyer needs to know: this is not a play-through DVD. The information here is best in bits and pieces, pausing in between techniques to put on some music and drill yourself before moving onto the next part. The in-costume warm up is great, but since I'm not performing, I prefer to do a floor-based warm up before I start the DVD.

Overall, one of the best belly dance DVDs I've had the good fortune to come across. This is about pushing your body to the limit in the most graceful and beautiful way possible and showcasing your strength. I love it.",1274832000,16,1856,5.263513513513513
3978345,5,B002S6U8YM,This video is excellent. The strength building exercises are just what's needed. The floorwork techniques are perfect for building choreography.

3978346,5,B002S6U8YM,"Flawless Floorwork

Flawless Floorwork is really quite a gorgeous video. From the cover to the menu, to the content - to the dancer-instructor, Ruby. A very elegant and graceful dancer, she's a great choice as a teacher for this very challenging area of belly dance.

Strengthen first!
Floorwork is zero-tolerant of clumsiness. You have to do moves that are difficult and require a lot of strength and control and any lapses can result in your looking terrible at the very least, and getting injured at the most.

After a good long introduction and explanation of what the video program contains, Ruby goes into an all-important strength section. This is based entirely on Pilates. Unlike on other videos, it isn't just about three ab strengthening exercises. From the breathing to the imprinting of the spine, you go through the principles that make Pilates effective and safe. The actual exercises include some of the basic favorites - the hundred, criss-cross, single and double leg stretch etc. In my opinion many more exercises could have been included = and some tougher ones, in fact. The core really does need strengthening for floorwork and it wouldn't have been at all out of place to have a few more challenging exercises.
I also think that the preparatory section could have been about twice as long. Many yoga exercises or the usual dance conditioning routines would fit well here because you need flexibility to the max here. Of course, it's only because I have so many other videos that I can easily just use another one and work on it before getting into Ruby's Pilates based routine.

But thank god there isn't an entire section on the isolations from scratch. No beginner should be doing floorwork anyway, so it's perfectly in order to have left all that out.

It's technique time
The Technique section, the heart of it all, is where Ruby explains how it's done. From how to kneel and place your feet and toes, to kneeling isolations and spins and crawls to extensions, hip spins, undulations, and layouts, Ruby explains, demonstrates and practices each technique carefully with safety tips throughout. The section is broken into sub sections accessible from the menu, in case you want to work with one. There's no skimping on the safety tips, thankfully, and wherever needed, there's alternatives are given. These sub sections don't include separate practice sessions but there are a few repetitions of each move. This works well, actually. You focus full time on observing, trying out, learning, taking note of precautions instead of dancing along too much and missing out on important information. All in all, I'm very impressed with how much advice Ruby gives while explaining technique.

Descents and Ascents
Often the toughest part of floorwork, ascents and descents need special attention, which is what they get on this DVD. Again, sticking to the same style as with the technique, Ruby explains different methods for each and spells out what you should be careful about. I particularly love her ""Dragon Down"" method of lowering to the floor, a slow graceful spiraling method that looks very elegant.

Two combinations
Giving you more than enough to work with, the two combinations are long and meaty. There's a basic and an advanced one and they're both full of moves that you can draw from to shorten or lengthen or make your own combinations. My only protest, as with other Cheekygirls DVDs, is that one needs drills to also have some cues and call out. A separate music only section is fine for when you've reached a certain level of practice, but before that, you do need voice cues as you go through a long combination. Specially so with a floorwork combo where you can't possibly be keeping track of what's happening on screen and must give all your attention to your form and accuracy if you're to avoid injuring yourself.

Extras
Extras can come in all varieties and are often fairly useless. But on this DVD, you get a nice 10-minute backstage warm up. There's also a costuming tutorial and tips on how to avoid wardrobe malfunctions. Finally of course there's a performance by Ruby.  And yes, of course it includes floorwork.

I'll say again that I find Flawless Floorwork really well-instructed and one of CheekyGirls' most content-rich DVDs. I'm not sure I can do any of this because of issues with my knees, but even so one can learn a lot about grace, arms and the dance in general.",1273104000,8,4423,4.8774966711051935

3978348,5,B002S6U8YM,"Glad I got this dvd.  Ruby gives clear instruction, at the same time leaving room for more advanced dancers to elaborate on what she's taught.  For the price, the information covered is fair.  I would like to see more descents and ascents presented in the future as I am sure Ruby is a most capable performer and instructor.",1270684800,5,324,4.551724137931035
3978349,5,B002S6U8YM,"Flawless Floorwork is designed for the dancer with some belly dance background and a moderate degree of physical ability. Instructor Ruby is thorough and articulate. She generously offers tips from her experience in dancing floorwork and she is gentle in her pace of teaching.
Flawless Floorwork begins with a verbal history and purpose of floorwork. Ruby shares her philosophy and an explanation of her Pilate's technique for floorwork. This introduction is coupled with tantalizing videos of Ruby in performance and practice of her floorwork steps that are explained in the instruction portion. The introduction is rather lengthy for dancers who may play the DVD for the first time dressed and eager to practice and dance right off. I suggest watching the introduction and the Pilates terminology sections in a relaxed fashion when you are not expecting to actively dance. It is good information that does not need to be reviewed in each DVD dance session.
The Strengthening Routine section is the next best thing to having a certified Pilates instructor guiding you through the exercises and giving personal feedback. It is clear that Ruby has seen enough beginner level Pilates to know what instruction to give. She explains what to do and how to do the exercises safely. That being said, the exercises are challenging. Many Pilate's exercises are designed to use multiple muscle groups, which means that they are a lot of bang for your buck. Ruby does mention that floorwork is a dancer's opportunity to show her (or his) strength, endurance and balance abilities. This program prepares participants for an impressive demonstration of strength. Please begin gently and follow Ruby's suggestion to consult your health care provider if you have any questions regarding your fitness level and appropriate exercise programs.
The DVD is set in a studio with a wood floor and mirrors. This is helpful because Ruby can be viewed anterior and posterior as she faces the mirror and is recorded from behind in most demonstrations. The Prone Hip Extension and the Swan are initially awkward to view because it they are done facing the floor, but they can be learned by watching the exercise first and performing them with Ruby's verbal instruction.
The Technique section covers multiple belly dance steps and combinations that can be done on the floor. This is not a beginning level DVD, and Ruby assumes knowledge of basic steps such as undulations, Maya's, and hip circles. However, floorwork specific movements are given thorough instruction. She repeats each step enough to practice the movement a few times. Ruby covers descents, ascents, costume tips, and a performance.
Flawless Floorwork's total running time is 113 minutes.  It is a generous arrangement of quality material that surpassed my hopes for a floorwork instruction DVD. Although I find it too lengthy to play through and work with in one dance session, it is valuable when practiced regularly in pieces manageable for a dancer's time allotment and fitness level. This DVD delivered both the inspiration and the quality instruction that I anticipated from a masterful dancer.

And her technique section????  WOW, that is my favorte.

8379118,5,B002S6U8YM,"When I first learned Belly Dance as a teen, quite some time ago, floor work was an integral part of the dance.  At some point, people began to focus more on the drum solo, and the sensuous, sinuous movements of floor work began to fall out of favor.  Fortunately, Ruby can show you how to excel at this lost art.

Not all instructional videos are created equal.  This is one of the better ones, although it does assume that you already have some experience with basic belly dance.  Still, Flawless Floorwork s a very thorough, very easy to understand tutorial.  It doesn't just show you the performance steps, it teaches you exercises that will ensure your body is up to the demands the dance will make of it; and takes you through warm-up exercises to prepare you to execute the steps of the dance.  The steps themselves are broken down simply and thoroughly so they are very easy to follow.

Very easy stuff that could be taught as a section of a dvd rather than the whole deal. The performances weren't that great. She seems as if she hasn't done alot of actual bellydance herself. Alot of her moves are not very defined. I think it's an ok starter dvd, but I'm sure I'll outgrow it very fast. There's a section of floorwork on the tribal fusion fundamentals dvd that I thought was was much more informative. There's also a section in the last 2 minutes or so that show girls from a show they did? None of them were doing structured movements...very sloppy and beginner mistakes. And I say that being an intemediate strictly taught from dvds. I have other cheeky girls dvds and they all seem to be of the same quality. Kind of informative, but not very experienced dancers and no explanation of how the moves are supposed to work or feel, which has helped me improve tremendously through the last year or so. I'll stick with Rachel Brice and Asharah.

Update: January 2018
I have done the instructional part of this dvd and I still give it only 3 stars, possibly 2. This is more of a dvd of ideas to try. The ""drills"" are not even on each side of your body. For example she did side extensions on the floor on the right side, but zero for the left. The motions were gone through pretty quickly. Her explanation on the floor drop was almost nill and gave no instruction on how to get up smoothly. Basically just memorize the stuff she did and then you do it on your own until you've got it. The main thing I was excited to learn more on was leaning back and she gave no warnings about hurting your back, no tips on how to get stronger, nothing. Basically she just shows you how she does it. Other than giving me ideas, this dvd has been a  waste for me.",1362787200,2,1901,4.322128851540616
