7967990,5,B00006FMDG,"I wish there were more episodes in the series!  The story lines keep the imagination and innocence of children.... not to mention, teaching the respect of parents/authority, having the diversity of friends and tenderness to take care of animals. Great animation and bright colors to keep toddlers (or older children) interested.",1389052800,,328,5.431372549019608

7967992,5,B00006FMDG,"Maurice Sendak's Little Bear is a wonderful show to ignite the imagination of little ones and parents alike.  The open-ended intermingling of magic and reality that makes the show great is especially evident in the ""Mysterious Moments"" collections.  Plenty of episodes are available on this DVD.  They  aid children in social situations, provide parents with ammunition against childhood fears (""Thunder Monster"" and ""Little Goblin Bear"" have come in handy for us), and, most importantly in my opinion, reawaken the wonder of childhood.  A great show, and a great collection of magical episodes.",1368230400,,595,5.423913043478261
