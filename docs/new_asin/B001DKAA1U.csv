8293926,5,B001DKAA1U,"Wow, for the price this is a terrific buy. I do not know why Amazon would allow Gustavo to complain about a purchase when he did NOT buy it on Amazon but he is dead wrong. This set came all in one box, shipped quickly, and played perfectly with NO logo on the screen. You can tell by the quality of the picture that is was factory made and it was factory sealed when I received it. It did have subtitles when I first put each disc in but it was very easy for me to turn them off under the menu on my DVD player. All in all I would pay another $100 for this set in an instant!",1246579200,,575,3.8
8293927,2,B001DKAA1U,"All the CDs worked which was the good part.  The downside is that one whole season had subtitles which I could have done without.  All in all, it was an okay purchase.",1244592000,,167,4.1875
8293928,5,B001DKAA1U,Great version of seasons 1-4 of House MD.  Definitely worth the cheaper price compared to the other boxset.  I don't know why anyone would pay more.,1234569600,,148,4.653846153846154
