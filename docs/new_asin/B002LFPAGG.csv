8372689,1,B002LFPAGG,"This DVD is 60 minutes long explaining the rail lines in the West of Scotland - a beautiful, magnificent area. The problems arise in the first few minutes with irksome  music that is no where near Scottish or even appropriate to the subject., which could have been done very easily. Amazingly they have managed to make one of the most superb and stunning areas of the world look lack luster and washed out. Believe me I have taken pictures of the region in fog, rain, clouds and sunshine and none of them look this bland. The colour is washed out.
It does not show inside the trains which you are able to journey on or even the views from them. You get to see pictures of the trains going through the countryside and pictures taken of the surrounding country, but its' beauty is not very visible. The narration will tell you some of the historical facts and show you some sights, such as distilleries and power stations and cable cars you can visit.

There are no extras on this DVD, it gives you probably what is outdated train information and does not show the splendor of the country. Do not depend on this for your journey.",1279670400,2,1127,4.466019417475728
8372690,4,B002LFPAGG,"Unexceptional but very pleasant entry in the British Rail Journeys series filmed in 1995. Plenty of scenery and occasional stops at historic sites, lochs and villages. Glasgow. Fort William, Oban and Mallaig are those places highlighted. The price is right for this railway ticket!",1260921600,,281,5.409090909090909
