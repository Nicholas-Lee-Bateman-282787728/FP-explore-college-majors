7622669,5,B01B80LO5U,"Great documentary about the man who took down the untouchable WWE.  You would think that this guy would be a jerk and he admits that he was.  But, you understand why he did what he did.  A ton of extras are included in this set.  The Blu-ray version has even more extras than the DVD.  Pick it up if you want to see and hear about David taking down Goliath.  Great job by the WWE for this set!",1467158400,2,393,3.9743589743589745
7622670,4,B01B80LO5U,"During the opening video of this presentation, many names past & present of the wrestling industry were shown through various past clips giving their opinion of this match which definitely was ""controversial"" to say the least as that's the one name that's always followed this man throughout his career as his life story has been told in parts by different people but never the entire story until now by the name himself...Eric Bischoff.  This is another unique presentation done by WWE not just because it's a rarity to do this type of documentary on a talent who made his life in this business through various areas of the business but also hear from various names throughout including his family (brother Mark, wife Loree, sister Lori), Sonny Onoo, Greg Gagne, Jason Hervey, Diamond Dallas Page, Kevin Nash, ex-WCW President Bill Shaw, Steve Austin, Hulk Hogan, Cody Rhodes, Chris Jericho, Madusa, ex-Turner Sports President Harvey Schiller and archival comments from Dusty Rhodes & Ted Turner.

The documentary starts out discussing growing up in different cities & how the certain people there had an influence on him to this day before going into him being a successful business man at an early age along with various types of work he would do including one that led to him meeting his wife.  How a business venture lead to him working in the AWA & overnight becoming the lead announcer was discussed next before going into how his loyalty was hurting him leading to his WCW run as an announcer from how it started with a guy he had a physical fight with only months earlier & the actual reason he was hired to the details of how he eventually became the Executive Producer followed by a very detailed steps he had in order to change the problems that had plagued WCW for the previous years.  A major part of the presentation was discussed next from how the idea of ""Monday Nitro"" came about & using the formula of S.A.R.S.A. to become the top of the industry & beyond with the different amounts of branding WCW had throughout pop culture before going into the different issues of what caused the downfall of it all from WCW itself to the parent corporation followed by his return months later causing him to attempt to purchase the company & why the deal fell through with an interesting fact stated of what other network offered to air the show but why they couldn't take the deal.  His WWE run was discussed next from what he remembers about the initial phone call from Vince McMahon, the difference between his character here & in WCW, and the only time he offered a change in anything presented to him before the documentary concluded discussing his Bischoff/Hervey Entertainment company & reflecting on his life.  Also shown throughout the documentary was Bischoff talking about other subjects in his personal life such as his current hometown, his Buffalo Bill Cody Beer brand, love for motorcycles, and responding to the comments made about him in previous WWE projects.

DVD extras include his WWE Network television specials of his two part interview with J.B.L. & a countdown of his Top 10 Controversial Moments; various television promos & interviews throughout his entire career in different promotions as both an interviewer, executive & talent; a bonus match featuring himself against Larry Zbyszko with Bret Hart as the special referee (Starrcade '97); and bonus stories of what he was selling at a young age; a family tradition of hunting; who was the original wrestling fan in their family; his education troubles in high school; what he learned about believably from Verne Gagne; how his first memories of the AOL Time Warner merger came from a celebration party; Chris Jericho talking about a one liner Bischoff gave him in regards to his contract; addressing specifically what ""creative control"" was in contracts; stories behind the favor & image of his beer; his love of horseback riding; and comparing his life to a spider web while also reflecting on different moments throughout his career from firing referee Randy Anderson; his feud with Jay Leno; memories of his WWE debut; how the Billy & Chuck wedding was the funnest moment of his career; Kevin Nash remembering powerbombing him through the stage; and Chris Jericho reflecting on their Highlight Reel with Steve Austin.  Blu-Ray extras include more television promos & interviews and his ""matches"" against Mr. McMahon (Slamboree '98 & ""RAW"" Feb. '04) & Hair Match against Eugene (Taboo Tuesday '05).

Eric Bischoff's story is something that has been told numerous times over the years through different presentations so most of what was said here in regards to his WCW tenure which was what a majority of this presentation covered so there isn't much more to say that hasn't already been said minus a few specific details or that we hear Bischoff's point of view for one of the first times while other subjects in regards to Bischoff that have been talked to death (ala lawsuit with Ric Flair in '98) were left out & whatever wasn't covered or given enough details on in the presentation I felt was covered in the J.B.L. interview in the extras with the only other negative I can say is that some of his most significant/infamous moments were still missing in the extras (i.e. Roddy Piper revealing him as a member of the nWo).  In the end, this that was one of those presentations similar to to Paul Heyman's where you got different perspectives & views on the behind the scenes of the wrestling industry through different promotions & positions so I recommend this for those fans who are interested in hearing about wrestling from either a behind the scenes or executive point of view.",1465948800,,5674,4.864389233954451

7622672,5,B01B80LO5U,"Great set chronicles his entire career, even his martial arts days,great collection on his 10 most controversial moments.  Really captures what the 3rd disc extras missed in my opinion  (ie Starrcade 1998 Eric Bischoff. Vs. Ric Flair and the storyline itself.) Great release.  Good job WWE.",1465430400,,290,5.260869565217392

7622675,5,B01B80LO5U,"Honestly a GREAT documentary, everything you would like to know plus more (with the exception of TNA). Bischoff has been a hero of sorts of mine for 2 decades now because of his business sense and I'm definitely proud to own this Best Buy Exclusive Steel Book.",1465344000,,260,4.553191489361702
7622676,5,B01B80LO5U,"As a WCW fan, I was excited to hear this was coming out. The documentary is an hour and a half (which is much more generous than the recent documentaries from WWE) and covers it all.
Fans of WCW, Eric's best selling autobiography, his run in WWE or even in how television has transformed over the years will be delighted with this wonderful documentary on one of the greatest, last renegades in Sports Entertainment.
The honesty, the brutal truth of it all is laid out here. Steve Austin and Chris Jericho provide insight on how Bischoff was then vs how he is now. These are two superstars that really didn't like him, and yet they even give respect where respect is due- Bischoff is the only person to challenge the WWE and win. No dirt sheet can take that away from him and this Documentary casts that in stone. Highly recommended. Best WWE has done in years.",1465257600,,861,4.490445859872612
7622677,4,B01B80LO5U,"I rated this upcoming WWE Blu-Ray release just four stars because it won't be including Eric Bischoff vs. Ric Flair from Starrcade (1998)
and Eric Bischoff vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin from No Way Out (2003)

7622681,5,B01B80LO5U,"Bischoff has had an amazing life! Much of what the WWE is today can be attributed to Eric Bischoff. This doc is very well done, giving you a look at what he is doing today. It's also a great compliment to his book ""Controversy Creates Cash"".",1468627200,4,241,4.260869565217392
7622682,5,B01B80LO5U,I'm always into the behind the scenes and I'm very interested on how things happen and why. To me the matches or promos they did are secondary. I love the Eric bischoff documentary I found it very fascinating,1468627200,,208,4.5

8749588,4,B01B80LO5U,"Various WWE superstars are interviewed on how Eric Bischoff ruined their live. Their criticisms are valid, but Bischoff shows how he was trying to put out a product every week and for the most part delivered. Whether everyone was happy was not a promise he could have kept. This DVD set shows the Bischoff as he is today, happily running his Cody western ranch and cooing over his microbrewey like a proud mother hen. I'm glad to see the story has a happy ending for him and his family.

Years ago I bought the hardcover to his book (Controversy Creates Cash) which I highly recommend for insight into the wrestling business. It's still on my shelf, so when I saw this I had to pick it up. I'm glad I did, and you will be too if you remember the heyday of the Monday Night Wars during the mid to closing 1990s.

A point off for the WWE's DVD Copy Protection scheme. My Sony DVD player would not play Disc One, due to offensive and ridiculous DVD copy protection used by WWE. Discs two and three played fine. I had to watch Disc One on my laptop computer's DVD player instead of enjoying this in front of my widescreen television. Thanks for nothing, WWE lawyers, for putting that garbage on your DVD so we couldn't play it!",1478304000,,1223,4.383259911894273

8749592,4,B01B80LO5U,I like it,1471564800,,9,2.3333333333333335
8749593,4,B01B80LO5U,"Not exactly sure what I expected from this, but I'll be honest... I can listen to Bischoff talk all day. I just find him so charismatic.
It was nice to hear about the inner workings of WCW, and how much he had going against him. So watching this made me respect the guy a little more than I did previously.
He also dispels some popular rumors about the company and other little tidbits.. so there's that too.

The JBL interview was ok.. JBL notwithstanding.. but it was pretty much a rehash of the main story, sooo.. yeah. It does have a couple extra bits, like Bischoff's take on the Hogan/Russo incident, but eh.

All in all, I liked it and am happy with my purchase.",1471046400,,669,4.344
