And to be honest, while it is a good film, George Lazenby is what makes it stand out. I don't think anybody today would care to see this film if he wasn't in the leading role, and it's hard to talk about the film without thinking of OHMSS.

The film does have an interesitng plot and some fun aciton scenes. It is a very fun movie, not something that is supposed to be deep or seriously. Lazenby gives a good performance here and is really good in the film's short action sequences. All of the other actors give a good performance as well. It also has a decent soundtrack.

At the end of the day, pick it up. It's a good film, even if the only standout thing in it is Lazenby.",1428710400,,776,4.098684210526316
