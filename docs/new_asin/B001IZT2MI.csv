8311614,2,B001IZT2MI,"I have seen nearly every Christmas horror movie ever made from Christmas Evil all the way to most of the Krampus movies, so I've seen a tremendous amount of them.  Many have been great, while others have been just plain unfocused drivel.  That being said this trio of Christmas horror b-movies just didn't offer much in the way of thrills much less any creative ideas or even anything that passes for entertaining.

Christmas Season Massacre had the worst plot possible, ferociously bad acting, no character development, characters that there's no reason to even care about, super lame gore effects, it was pretty dull, the soundtrack was ghastly, it had very little humor, flat stereotypical characters that were stupid as well as annoying, too much shaky camera, that whole one-shoed pirate thing that the killer sported was just plain idiotic, there's a part of the movie where the killer rapes a woman, it wasn't scary, and most of all there were no cool kill scenes.  All this had going for it was a couple of good scenes of nudity.  This one is not good for even any novelty.

Psycho Santa deals with a husband reluctant to go to this Christmas party that his wife eventually gets him to agree to attend with her.  As they're driving the husband tells his wife several stories revolving around this psycho in a Santa suit named Chris.
The first story is about two women who go to a cabin to celebrate Christmas along with their friend Sarah, of whom for some reason hasn't shown up.  The next story is about two burglars who break into a blind woman's house to rob her and get much more than they bargained for.  The story after that focuses on the blind woman's husband who tells about how he and his wife are related to Chris and have kept him locked up so that he couldn't hurt anyone.  From here Chris is free as he kills a charity Santa for his suit, and kills any random person that he finds.  Nextly, Chris enters a secluded house in the woods where he encounters a mother and son.  The son plays Christmas songs on the piano and their happens to be one that puts Chris in a trance.  In the final story a brother and sister are heading somewhere and find themselves getting lost.  They search the woods looking for some help while Chris aka Psycho Santa is not far behind.
Psycho Santa was slow and plodding, had bad music, terrible acting, lousy nudity, boring stories, no character development, slow deaths, very little gore, corny sound effects, shaky and messy camera work, bad gore effects, no humor, it was too long, and it was completely forgettable.

Satan Claus deals with the cops trying to find and apprehend a killer Santa type that collects people's body parts after he kills them.  It also has a mysterious woman working some evil magic into it.  The main cop and his would be actor friend work together along with a voodoo lady to seek out these sick individuals.
This movie actually has some character development allowing the audience a reason to care about the characters.  There's some acting that's bad to the point of being funny.  The gore is pretty good.  The killer, Satan Claus, is actually charismatic and loves to call in and taught the police.  The characters are indeed interesting.  The pacing is very good as the movie keeps on going.  There's one scene of good nudity.  Satan Claus shows a true intensity when he kills people.  There are only two flaws to this movie 1) Many of the scenes are dark, making it a trifle hard to see what's going on at times and 2) Unfortunately this movie is the shortest in the collection.  Those are just minor issues that shouldn't in fact detract from the enjoyment of the film.  I still enjoyed it all the same.

In closing, The first two movies(Christmas Season Massacre and Psycho Santa) have titles that suggest that they will be better movies than they actually turn out to be.  The artwork for the front cover is great for sure.  It would've been nice if the title of the collection ""Silent Night, Gory Night"" actually referred to a movie by that title.  It's of a minor concern, but still.  If you're expecting Silent Night, Deadly Night, Christmas Evil, or even Black Christmas quality from the first two movies then give up all hope there.  But with Satan Claus however, you get a movie that's clearly in keeping with those classics as much as it can be.  So, one out of three of these movies is watchable and as for the other two they're only worth one view period.  This collection is worth it, but only for Satan Claus.",1451347200,,4511,4.5892634207240945

to sit and watch a slasher thriller, well by the time it came it was freezing outside and pouring icy rain so it was the perfect day to watch the movies!  It did not hurt any that my son and I had a cameo part in
one of the films.smile  Psycho Santa!  We sat and watched Psycho Santa
again and then Satan Claus, bloody good fun!!!!  What better backdrop
to showcase than Christmas for a slasher flick when our wallets get
slashed to ribbons each year over this commercialized fiasco of a holiday!
I did not yet watch Christmas Season Massacre but I will soon.
I think its a very well put together holiday terror triple feature!!!",1237248000,4,703,4.384615384615385
