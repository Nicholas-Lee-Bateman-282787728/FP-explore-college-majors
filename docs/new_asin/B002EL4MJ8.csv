3917771,2,B002EL4MJ8,"This movie is a mess. It were as though the producers/ writer/ director had an idea with absolutely no clue on how to get it to work.

A bloke is on the outs with his wife. Divorce is on the horizon and he's down in the mouth. His mates want to take him to a secluded spot to get blasted and cheer him up. Problem is, all the men in the secluded town they go to are recently dead and all the women have turned into blood-thirsty, man-killing mutants. Our boys must make the great escape with their testicles in tact.

The Schtick here is men vs. women. Each of the guys has a less than decent relationship with a woman and here they're getting their come-uppance. The basic idea is loaded with possibilities. Unfortunately little is done to explore it, and it ends up being not much more than a ghoul, gore-fest.

In essentially every horror movie I've ever seen, where unsuspecting folk walk into a bad situation, the set-up isn't clear from the get-go. Things start a bit weird and the clues build up to a point where everyone figures out what they're up against and what they need to do to get out in tact. Not here. The first act is used to meet the dudes but as soon as they hit the pub in the village all hell breaks loose. Now, our heroes start acting like the Three Stooges. They run from this place to that place with the horde of women in hot pursuit. They devise stupid ways to try and eradicate as many of the female foe as possible but they are all lame, slapstick type attempts.

Many have noted that this is in the same vein as ""Shaun of the Dead.""  That is true only in the fact that the two are both horror comedies. This is nowhere in the same league as ""Shaun."" You don't have nearly the character development here. Even Danny Dyer, whose work I like a lot, is little more than a cardboard cutout here. Also, this movie isn't shot or edited particularly well. Much of the action takes place at night and it's lit poorly. Not necessarily dark, just uninteresting. There is a joke in the final scene that you can see coming a mile away. How they didn't is beyond me.

Unless you're a die hard fan of this sort of thing I'd stay clear.",1291680000,2,2151,4.259803921568627

Vince (Stephen Graham) is in the early stages of divorce proceedings, and, in a bid to lift his spirits, his friends have arranged a men-only weekend away in a remote village. Rumor has it that the population of this village is skewed so that the women outnumber the menfolk by four to one. It therefore stands to reason that all those loose women will be aching for some male companionship. Vince's friends - Mikey (Noel Clarke), Neil (Danny Dyer), Matt (Lee Ingleby), Patrick (Keith-Lee Castle) and Graham (Emil Marwa) - have incurred the wrath of their significant others who are all somewhat peeved at having their weekends suddenly ruined by this excursion. Our heroes are in the doghouse.

Things get worse when the lads arrive at their destination. Sure there is a surplus of women. Trouble is they are all zombies and they've eaten all the men.

 The film's  ""battle of the sexes"" motif marks its distinction from most of the recent slew of zomcoms. The cast are excellent as they revel in some very funny moments and spout some silly blokey dialogue. Most of the female cast are presented as shrews or zombies. The two ladies who are not saddled with these characteristics are a barmaid who invites Neil's chauvinistic utterances when she reminds him that smoking is not allowed in the pub, and the minibus driver, Ruth (Christina Cole). To be accurate about it, Ruth only half escapes these traits. Soon after their arrival in the village, she succumbs to the same fate that has befallen the other women there.

There is a fair amount of gore but as I implied earlier, it's presented in quite a cartoonish way. The male perspective is deployed in such an over-the-top manner that it cannot be taken as anything other than the joke that is at the film's core. Leaving aside the chauvinistic attitudes that are inherent in some (but not all) of the film's central characters, the zombified women are almost all garishly attired for no discernable reason.

The film's major weaknesses are that the explanation for the events that have taken place in the village prior to  the lads' arrival is not explored in anything like enough detail, and the film's ending is a bit of a let down. Good knockabout entertainment, though.

 I'd certainly recommend `Doghouse' for fans of horror comedies in general and fans of zombie comedies in particular. The emphasis is more on comedy than horror. For those who like their comedy a bit darker and their comedy horror a bit more horrific, you may want to check out the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mum-and-Dad/dp/B001RTKKQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mum and Dad</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cottage/dp/B0013D8LLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cottage</a>.",1269907200,2,3798,5.9650735294117645

3917783,4,B002EL4MJ8,"Review originally posted on my website, From the Mind of Tatlock

Here I was saying there wasn't many funny zombie movies out there in my Aaah! Zombies!! movie review and then a certain streaming service recommends I check out Doghouse. Boy, am I glad I did, cause I loved it! It was funny, gory and has a fun 80's horror vibe throughout. If that piqued your interest, read on for more...

Short nitty-gritty plot description from IMDb is as follows: A group of men head to a remote village to help one of their friends get over his divorce; when they get there, though, they discover that all the women have been infected with a virus that makes them man-hating cannibals.

Okay, I said in my intro that Doghouse is a funny zombie movie, but I'm kinda stretching the truth a little, as the movie's creatures aren't really zombies per say and are more just weird infected... well, creatures. They will munch down on flesh and tear you apart, but they are so weird looking and go through different phases, that I wouldn't really classify them as a straight zombie. So, with that out of the way, what is the movie about.

Doghouse follows a group of friends, Niel, Mikey, Graham, Matt and Patrick, as they console a fellow friend, Vince, who is going through a rough divorce. The plan is to go on a road trip to the small town of Moodley, where the women outnumber the men and get drunk, get laid and just forget their troubles. They arrive in Moodley and find out that Mikey, the one who planned the trip and who was originally from this town, was fibbing a little on the size and excitement of the place. Thankfully for us and not so much for our friends, the town has been infected with a virus and all the women are ravenous creatures, who will stop at nothing to tear you apart!

Doghouse has a lot of positives in my useless opinion. It was pretty damn funny, the guys are pretty dumb, but I enjoyed them all and didn't find any of the actor's annoying. Well, the character of Neil, was a little grating at first, but he grew on me. The other big positive is the creature effects. The women monsters are all unique and memorable. They brandish weapons and snarl, vomit and just spew grossness. It's awesome! The movie also has some lovely gore and doesn't shy away from showing the guts.

Now, things aren't all sunshine and lollypops unfortunately. The movie misses it's mark a few times with the story. The movie hints at something terrible in the woods and the guy's shouldn't go in them. So, I figured they would at least once walk into them and we would get a giant hoard of creature women chasing them, but sadly, the movie never moves away from this small town. Yes, the town does vary enough that you are never bored of the surroundings, but I still would've liked to wander in those woods and see the horror. Finally, the movie doesn't really explain much and leaves a lot of plot threads just hanging. Before you know it, the movie's credits are rolling and your left with several questions unanswered.

All negatives aside, Doghouse is a riot, filled with gore, humor and buxom zombie/creature ladies. This is one doghouse I wouldn't mind being in. It doesn't slow down and always left me entertained. I'm a little disappointed in a few questions left open, but that doesn't stop me from highly recommending any horror fan to check it out.

Rating: 4/5 (-1 for unanswered questions and leaving the woods out of it. +4 for gore, humor, a fun story and some gnarly ladies.)",1375056000,,3486,4.522222222222222

Here is one of the most hilarious Zombie spoofs to come digging it's way out of the grave! 2009's, ""Doghouse"" is an absolutely original take on the way over used & abused Zombie sub-genre.

A group of friends take off for a boys weekend of boozing, bonding, babe hunting, & all out good ole fashioned debauchery, as their trying to cheer up a buddy who has just went through divorce. They hire a mini bus with a hot female driver, & off they go into the English countryside to a village where another friend lives.

Right off the bat you know this is going to be a funny affair, as one wife or girlfriend gives each of the guys the third degree for taking off together for a weekend of fun. Yes, these guys are hen pecked, & ready to fly the roost. Little do they know that the hens in the village are ready to peck them to death, as their all Zombies looking for that special guy which just happens to be any guy who crosses their path. Yes, these hens have sharp teeth & claws, & rooster is on the menu!

What ensues is mass black comedy hilarity as our group of roosters try to get away with all their feathers still intact. The female Zombie make up is first rate & diverse! We have a hooker Zombie, a Grandmother Zombie, a barmaid Zombie, a beautician Zombie, a young bride Zombie, a teenage girl Zombie, a woman butcher Zombie, & maybe the most hilarious of all, a hugely obese housewife Zombie dressed in a huge tent of a bathrobe & hair curlers that loves candles on her cake made of men's fingers. Instead of having her cake & eating it to, she just likes to munch on a finger or two, or three, or four...

Yes, it is revenge of the hens, as the roosters are crowing for help & trying to fly away with clipped wings! One funny scene after another fills this hugely entertaining black comedy, as our roosters devise anyway they can to overcome the chopping block, but those hen's feathers a ruffled, their beaks are ready, & their tummies are clucking! This is one film where the rooster want to fly the coupe & never come back!",1353456000,,2055,4.286082474226804

It's certainly no masterpiece. It's not scary and it's not meant to be. It's just an hour and a half of interesting silliness to provide entertainment. Nothing more and nothing less.

I admit I hate zombie movies and the only reason I watched this was for the different spin on the concept. I wished we could've seen the women before they turned into men-hating maniacs but the action begins quickly and it's nonstop which I appreciated.

My only complaint was that it's hard to understand the men at times. They have very strong British accents and in some scenes they tend to talk over one another and it makes it almost impossible to figure out what they are saying.

The infected / Zombies are very well done and are solid characters in their own right - each being very distinctive to the point where they even in the movie ask each other, ""Which one's your favorite?"".  SO you literally can find yourself hoping to see more of a certain zombie... very well-done zomedy; if any of the chicks from this movie did horror conventions i'd be there to get em to sign this - they are really that memorable.",1343433600,,796,4.424657534246576

3917800,4,B002EL4MJ8,"<strong>Doghouse</strong> (Jake West, 2009)

<em>Doghouse</em> is a movie that doesn't seem to inspire any middle-of-the-road reviews; people either loved it or they really, really, REALLY hated it. This seems to have to do with whether the viewer found the movie's central conceit amusing or not. Count me among the former. Yes, maybe it makes me a sexist pig, but I thought it was hysterical, a twisted combination of Wayne Simmons' wonderful novel <em>Drop Dead Gorgeous</em> and Edgar Wright's equally wonderful film <em>Shaun of the Dead</em> with a couple of dashes of a delicious old J. Lee Thompson film called <em>Eye of the Devil</em> thrown in for good measure.

Director Jake West (<em>Razor Blade Smile</em>), normally a documentarian, and writer Dan Schaffer (working on his first project) her deliver us a tale of six blokes who've organized a trip out to a remote village where one's gran lives in order to help Vince (<em>Snatch</em>'s Stephen Graham) have a nice weekend forgetting about the nasty divorce he just went through. Along with Vince, we have Mikey (TV character actor Noel Clarke, currently in a recurring role on the latest incarnation of <em>Dr. Who</em>), Graham (<em>East Is East</em>'s Emil Marwa), Matt (<em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em>'s Lee Inglesby), and Patrick (<em>Seed of Chucky</em>'s Keith Lee Castle). There's also supposed to be Banksy (<em>Atonement</em>'s Neil Maskell), but he's having problems with a broken-down van and will have to meet them there. In any case, the five present board a charter bus with Candy (<em>Casino Royale</em>'s Christina Cole), and off they go to Moodley, the remote village in the middle of the woods...which is deserted when they get there. They soon find out why: all the women in town have, through an agent unknown, been turned into zombies, and have killed all the men. And Candy has just delivered them the equivalent of a vanful of takeaway curry...

Yes, on the surface it's painfully sexist, but you have to consider that Schaffer probably wouldn't have come up with ""hey, let's have one of pretty much every female stereotype as a zombie!"" unless he was planning of making fun of something. And I think that something got lost on a lot of American viewers who don't saturate themselves in British TV, as I've been doing for the past twenty years (I even had a brief fling with <em>EastEnders</em> in the mid-nineties when we started getting the episodes over here in which Wendy Richard appears...). While a lot of that same satire of what another reviewer called ""lad culture"" shows up in other, more popular on this side of the pond, British films (<em>Shaun</em> was awash in it), those were side-jokes that it wasn't necessary to get to appreciate where the movie was going. Here it's a central tenet, and if you miss that Schaffer and West are poking fun at these idiots, you're going to miss out on a lot of why this is funny. (Here's a hint, without trying to be spoilery: if you ask yourself, as so many on the IMDB boards did, why the survivors were stupid enough to do what they do in the closing sequence, you're not getting the satire that's run through the entire movie.) It also goofs on a number of recent zombie/pseudo-zombie flicks, most notably <em>28 Days Later...</em>; if you turn your head and squint right, in fact, this whole movie is a goof on Christopher Eccleston's chilling ""we promised them women"" scene.

I do understand that ""if you don't get the references, you don't get the humor"" is a valid criticism, and because of that, I did reluctantly dock the movie a few points, but this is a case where ""this movie is not for everyone"" definitely applies. But if you're one of those who gets the humor, I can't recommend this movie highly enough. It's sharp, it's madcap, and it's all sorts of fun. *** ",1329264000,,3836,4.886328725038402

I enjoyed the hell out of it honestly. I viewed this on Netflix, and im purchasing as well just for my collection. If you like dark humor, its here. Its just a real campy flick that results in laughs and fun with zombies. Especially the birthday cake scene. Poor sap. And the ending with the ""signal"" and the bit on the bus made me laugh a bit. I actually rooted for the characters instead of waiting for them to die... saying all of this, I don't mean you will fall out of your seat, but it will make you smile.

And so, to a certain extent, does this movie.  Billed as both a comedy and a horror movie, Doghouse doesn't quite succeed at either claim.  It takes extraordinary balance to pull off both, this movie, unfortunately, veers off course far too many times (the ending alone is a perfect example; it simply fizzles out with a giggle).  For me it wasn't the gore or the misogynistic humor that cinched my opinion, it was the inconsistency throughout; neither full-on horror or humor.  If you're going to commit to something, commit all the way or don't bother.  Yes, it had its moments, I will give it that; I definitely won't say I'm sorry I watched it.  But, at the same time, I don't have any inclination to watch it again: not a keeper.",1307404800,,902,4.4573170731707314
3917805,3,B002EL4MJ8,"This movie is a zomedy from the U.K. and it looks great on blu ray for sure. It features a group of average brit blokes who take their divorced friend on a vacation tour trip and end up in a village filled with female women infected with a virus that makes them zombie like. But they are not zombies really , instead mutated would be a better word for them. The music in this movie is really cool rock and that helps the feel of the movie. The cast itself are all veterans of british tv and film and NOT first timers, in fact this is way above some amuteur film made by beginners. So  you get a low budget flick done by seasoned professionals all the way here.  The negative reviews on amazon about acting are not accurate at all I believe, the sets looked fine to me as well. It was a small village set and that's that.  The story is not pollitically correct at all and of course we get silliness some. The whole idea that the brit government would test a virus on a village in their own country is lame but who else would this movie work? well it could have been a meteor and that would have been less distasteful but it's now become part of filmland to always blame governments for everything so this is what you get.  However it doesn't matter as this is a zomedy anyways. I thought the movie moved fast and was funny and even offensive which is what it aimed to be anyways. However the idea of men finding themselves in this horrible situation seems far fetched.
Instead regardless if you knew these cannibal women you'd be filled with horror and not take this lightly. But this does have the actors act that way to a degree which lets us all know that this is a comedy to a degree. Still it's a fast moving flick and if you don't take it seriously you'll have fun watching it. The blu ray has deleted scenes and extras as well. the blu ray is all region but the extras are not though. you'd need a all region blu ray to watch the extras but the feature film is fine on your american blu ray player. The uk has lots of horror blus that aren't making it out over here and most of them are all region so it's a good idea to grab them if you want a hd version of a movie like this.",1306886400,5,2183,4.129411764705883

A group of guys go on a weekend bender to a small town in the middle of no where, only to discover all the women have been turned into ""zombirds"" that seek to kill all men. Near escapes, a few deaths and a lot of dark humor make it a fun ride. Danny Dyer is fun to watch, as usual.",1300060800,,567,4.163636363636364

A group of friends head out to the town of Moodley for a ""boys only"" weekend in an attempt to get away from their significant others back home and also rediscover themselves. All is well and good. Drinks are had before they left, a fun roadtrip, jokes, ribbing--but everything changes when they find the town of Moodley deserted.

Soon it is discovered the only folks left are the women--and they have a deadly appetite for human flesh. Grotesque female monsters send the boys on the run and into a battle for survival in this throwback to classic horror.

And that's what really sums up this flick for me: classic horror. Prosthetic monsters, excellent makeup, and good old-fashioned blood and guts, along with a storyline that carried with it a sense of depth ala Shaun of the Dead.

This is one of those flicks that are worth watching again because the writing is quite good, with each line feeding off the other--whether subtly or overtly--references to earlier lines/comments, objects and people. Extremely well done.

Not only that, but the cast also had great chemistry and created a buddy-horror flick that reminded me a lot of hanging out with my friends back in the glory days of all-night partying and crude jokes (minus the cannibalistic women, of course).

The '80s-style soundtrack gave this flick an eerie mood that reminded me of the old Nightmare on Elm Street stuff, really setting the tone.

Really happy with this film, and would recommend it in a hot minute.

3917812,4,B002EL4MJ8,"A group of long time friends get together for the sake of one of their pal who, having just experienced a very difficult and painful divorce, is absolutely broken and dejected. On the advice of one of the group whose grandmother has a big old house a little ways from London in a small nowhere village off the beaten path, as it were, they go to that small nowhere village off the beaten track in a rented shuttle bus. You see, the lad's grandmother is supposed to be out of town while her house is undergoing some minor renovations. When they get to the town, however, instead of partying at the pub until properly wasted, mixing it up with the local beauties, and horsing around in the surrounding forest, they are faced with something entirely different and unexpected.

All of the women in the town seem to have somehow become murderous zombie-esque subhumanoids that are mere husks of their former selves. What's more, they seem to be driven to kill men only. There's a mad dentist she-zombie complete with bloody face mask. A hairdresser she-zombie with really big, sharp scissors and spastic movements punctuated by the blades opening and closing, opening and closing, snip, snip, SNIP! A tall, dark and impossibly big-breasted she-zombie, the proud owner of the village's one and only witchcraft and occult supply and book store, shuffles mightily after her prey with a huge medieval style sword which she wields in great aching swings and full-on stabs. Yikes! A scary she-zombie in a white wedding gown, wielding a most menacing-looking axe, presumably already used to cut up a few man victims since its head is wet and gooey with blood and flesh chunks. There are a number of others, certainly too many to describe in detail here.

It's just really funny how the men react to the homicidal she-zombies pursuing them with murderous intent. The situations in which they find themselves, indeed in which they put themselves, are more often than not comical as hell. Each of the central and marginal protagonists fends off the female threats in his own way according to his character; one swings a gold club, while another builds improvised weapons out of merchandise from a toy and hobby shop. Other characters defend themselves in other ways, but it's usually funny and outrageous. In fact, everything is funny and outrageous, not to mention a bit unsettling, in this British horror comedy of stupid men and bloodthirsty she-zombies in an epic gender feud of a nightmare.

This is the second film that I own from writer/director Jake West. The other is ""Evil Aliens,"" which was also a brilliant horror comedy (with a bit of sci-fi strangeness thrown in for good measure). These two films, having become two of my favorite horror comedies, make me wonder what Jake West will be doing next. At any rate, I hope whatever is up next doesn't take too terribly long, as this stuff is definitely too good to wait for.",1294531200,,2919,4.8107569721115535

Still, there are some funny bits amidst all the grue. There is a lot of gore in this thing. Decapitations, stabbings, severed body parts everywhere. You name it, it's in here. If you like horror-comedies like Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead, you should definately enter Doghouse.

 This British comedy/horror flick rates a laughing three brains.  This is in spite of the film not being about Zombies in a technical sense.  The monsters are mutated humans rather than undead but they move and act like traditional Zombies with the extra feature of some level of cognition.  The can and do use weapons for one thing.  They are the result of a military experiment gone awry.  The pathogen in this case only affects women.
 Some critics objected to the premise of the film which logically results in a battle to the death of female monsters and human men.  Oh well.  Too many people in this day and age get their panties in a bunch over the least little thing.
 The friends in the film, a pack of mates, leave London for a weekend in an isolated country village.  The opening moments tell us that none of these friends have a very mature or positive relationship with the women in their lives.  They intend to get stinking drunk and communicate by grunts for a few days to blow off a few layers the urban civilization which is suppressing them and in the process cheer up one of their number who has recently been crushed in a divorce, which any typically sensitive man will tell you is no fun at all.
 They stumble into a world where the men have all been murdered and devoured.  The friends fight for their lives.
 The makeup on the monsters is excellent.  The production values, acting and direction are of professional quality.  The film, in its pacing, humor and subject matter, reminds one of such other well done films as Shaun of the Dead.  Leaving aside the more or less continuous misogyny I found the film to be funny, entertaining and applaud it for pulling the band-aid off the scab of some aspects of the male-female relationship.
 Director Jake West has seven directing credits on his card.  Writer Daniel Schaffer is best known as a comic book artist/writer.  The $4 million spent to make this film is money well spent, for the fans.  I am not sure how long it will take to make back the nut on the DVD market.  This 89 minute film is not rated but is saturated with violence, cannibalism and murder but no naked people.  I watched the credits come up smiling.
 The 2013 Simon Pegg vehicle The World's End is pretty much a rip off of this concept.  I liked that one too but it has human looking space androids instead of Zombies.",1470873600,,2376,4.505854800936768
