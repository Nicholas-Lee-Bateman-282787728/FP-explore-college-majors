3923803,3,B002FOFXJC,"The best thing about this Hammer documentary are the interview clips of Yutte Stensgaard, an actress who has mostly avoided her Hammer connection. It is great to see her here in what may be her only filmed interview on the subject. There are some other interesting interviews as well but, unfortunately, on several of them the sound is nearly inaudible. Some of the facts put forth by the narrator needed checking. One example, James Bernard never conducted his own compositions. He was not a conductor and said so many times. Also, the harsh words about Twins of Evil and Hands of the Ripper are puzzling. There is little critical commentary throughout so it is all the odder when the narrator suddenly begins finding fault with these films, which are generally quite well thought of.",1336867200,5,785,4.865671641791045

3923805,5,B002FOFXJC,"Those of us who lived in the Baltimore Area were lucky to have the FANEX Conventions here. A fan-based set of conventions, these cons brought to town a wide variety of actors we used to watch on the late late horror shows. The stories they would tell! Hammer Films are my favorites, along with Universal, of course. Because of FANEX, I got to meet some of the premier actors of Hammer- Caroline Munro, Ingrid Pitt, Martine Beswick, Veronica Carlson, Michael Ripper, and my fav, Yutte Stensgaard. Now recordings from those cons have been put together in this slick documentary on Hammer. Interviews with those in front of, and behind, the cameras make for a fascinating tale about movie-making. Some of the stories will make you laugh, some will make you feel sentimental- like when Christopher Lee talks about Peter Cushing. But it will entertain you no end. Sadly, some of these folks are no longer with us, but that's what makes this a keeper. And the price is a real deal. If you like Hammer, you should add this to your DVD library.",1252454400,24,1036,4.666666666666667
3923806,5,B002FOFXJC,"What I adore about this charming documentary about the fondly remembered Hammer films, and the studio that created them, is that you can feel the love and sense of wonder the participants have for the subject matter. No dry-as-dust history lesson here, but rather a fun-filled romp down the dark, dank castle corridors and into the forbidden crypts of our favorite films from the ""Studio That Dripped Blood"".
  Kudos to all involved for taking a very large wealth of material, and paring it down into a constantly entertaining 95 minutes of vintage photos, trailers and fascinating on-stage interviews from the wonderful Fanex conventions of days past. This gem is a real treat for both Hammer Film enthusiasts and horror film buffs in general, and would make a wonderful introductory presentation for those willing, or unwilling (heh,heh,heh...)victims who have yet to gaze upon the macabre masterpieces from the house of Hammer!",1252454400,32,930,5.193333333333333

8369453,5,B002FOFXJC,"The rating reflects personal view. This is a documentary interspersed with scenes/actors at festivals. It documents the rise and fall of Hammer films.  Having grown up with these films and met some of the cast, it was a great viewing experience. It is a niche product which won't appeal to everyone especially younger viewers.",1441497600,,326,5.037037037037037

8369456,3,B002FOFXJC,"This is a documentary about the History of Hammer films. It was filmed at various Sci Fi/ movie conventions. It features dialog and stories by the actors who worked for Hammer and appear in some films. Christopher Lee, Barbara Shelley, and Ingrid Pitt are among those interviewed. There are a lot of clips from Hammer films too. If you follow the film legacy of this company, this is a good

If you have, then you have been in a question and answer session where the sound was so bad you couldn't understand a thing.  Well, now you know what to expect.  No sound remastering to make it understandable either.  I must admit seeing Christopher Lee do Sylvester the Cat from Bugs Bunny was pretty funny.  This is only for the die hards.",1346112000,,415,4.394736842105263
