The tournament has begun. The 3 kingdoms and their representatives are competing to determine the new sole ruler of demon world. Yusuke, Kurama, and Hiei are on different sides this time. Will they have to fight each other one last time.

This is a great series. It has lots of cool characters, good animation, voice acting, and a very engrossing story. It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time. It has a bit of a Dragonball Z vibe to it, and everyone likes that. I highly recommend Yu Yu Hakusho to every anime fan, it's simply amazing.",1353110400,,1464,4.262589928057554
8055960,5,B0008FPJKS,"One of the major reasons to buy this DVD, besides completing a Yu Yu Hakusho collection, is to see one of the most famous battles of the series, Hiei vs Mukuro.  This is a fight many American fans have been waiting to see since Yu Yu Hakusho premiered on Adult Swim and now is our chance to see all the intensity and emotion.  Watching may help to sway some anti Mukuro fans and see she is not what you may have thought.  Also included is Kurama's sword to face match with Shigure, another exciting one!

One warning before you watch, don't let the episode titles mislead you!  This volume has beautiful cover art and is a must have item for any Yu Yu Hakusho fan.",1122854400,3,664,4.28
8055961,5,B0008FPJKS,"Volumes like these remind me how much I suffered through previous volumes...well, I didn't suffer that much, but I am really enjoying these last few volumes.

Once again, these 3 episodes capture great storylines, character development AND great kick-butt action.

In ""The Demon World Tournament Begins"", we see Jinn and Touya in their competitions against 2 of Raizen's old friends.

In ""Farewell, Kurama"", we see the Demonworld Doctor, Shigure (The same one who gave Hiei his eye)against Kurama.

And in the last episode, ""Love and War"", we see Hiei against Mukuro.

I found the match with Kurama and shigure to be one of the best yet. A very thoughtful episode which ends beautifully.

The match with Hiei against Mukuro was also great, with a lot of information about the origin of Mukuro.  The battle itself is an amazing show of power by Mukuro with a suprise ending.

Quite honestly, I am sort of amazed that a single match in the Dark tournament could take sometimes 3 episodes, yet in this tournament, many of the matches are much shorter, as if the show ran out of funding or something, so they couldn't make more episodes.  Its too bad, because they could have lengthened the series a bit more, and shown us a lot more classic fighting action.  Instead we have just one more volume, where we will no doubt see a lot of great storylines crammed into 3 episodes...but nonetheless, episodes I will not miss!",1119225600,8,1415,4.762295081967213
