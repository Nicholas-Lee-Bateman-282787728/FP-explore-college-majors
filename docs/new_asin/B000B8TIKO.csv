8083727,2,B000B8TIKO,"This could have been a decent murder mystery acted out in the beautiful settings in and around Seattle. Unfortunately, the script seems to have been a quick weekend job: A hastily assembled, ill fitting mess of standard scenes and situations which lead towards a so called surprise ending which can be expected from miles away. The only redeeming factor is the performance of Beverly d'Angelo - it's several notches above that of any actor in this movie (I mean, reliable and excellent charactor actor Richard Crenna is always good but he really doesn't seem to have put much heart into this matter). What amazed me is that even her dialog seems to be much better than that of the others. Is this just a proof of her wonderful acting talents or did she rewrite her own lines?",1201478400,6,775,4.664233576642336
