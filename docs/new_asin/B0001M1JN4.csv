The continuity and editing are sub-standard at best.
The flow of scenes are staggered and jumpy.
The amount of action is high. Bruce kicks alot of butt, however, some are edited in from episodes not included in the story line.

The special feature of the Black Beauty was really good.

The fury of the dragon 2 is worse than the first.

I will wait for a box set of the episodes.",1196553600,,448,4.309523809523809
8014534,2,B0001M1JN4,"When Bruce Lee passed in 1973, 2 films were pieced together in an attempt to cash in on Bruce Lee mania via splicing together some of Lee's best moments from the Green Hornet series, and thus making 2 90 min. ""Bruce Lee films"" to the joy of those who were anxious for more Bruce Lee footage. The first was entitled ""Green Hornet"", the second was entitled, oddly enough, ""Fury of the Dragon.""

What we have here is the official sequel to the first 90 minute Green Hornet feature. An identical approach in that the production is made up of various scenes from the Green Hornet tv series...and the result? In spite of some good moments and fond memories of watching Bruce Lee get down as a superhero and hearing his REAL voice, we're left with 90 minutes of awkward splicing together of stories that don't blend. I even recall seeing a few fight scenes from the 1st movie. If you ask me, what we have here is a shadow of what was to come in 1978...20th Century Fox's butchering of Bruce Lee's Game of Death. The only difference was that they spliced together footage alone as opposed to throwing in an unconvincing double with 10 minutes of real footage. Either way, this one's a keeper for die hard Bruce Lee fans, one that'll be worth lots in the near future. But yet aqnd still, I have to call Green Hornet vol. 1 and Fury of the Dragon(Green Hornet vol. 2) what it is...BRUCEPLOITATION nonetheless. MAY WE PLEASE HAVE AN OFFICAL GREEN HORNET BOX COLLECTION? THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO PURCHASING THESE 2 SPLICE JOBS IS ON THE BLACK MARKET & I DON'T STEAL. SOMEBODY HELP A BROTHER OUT. LOL!

WORD OF WARNING: Make sure that your DVD player will play PAL discs before purchasing this dvd. My copy will only play on my Windows Media Player...it's region 1, it's not a bootleg, but it's being PAL will make all the difference as to whether or not it'll play. Be careful.",1170201600,7,1864,4.495575221238938
