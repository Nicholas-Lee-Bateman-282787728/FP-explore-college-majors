8202835,4,B000RW5CCM,"I had good memories (I suspect embellished) of certain scenes in this movie and when I finally got a copy after 30 years, okay 20, I was faced with a patchwork unordered script on acid (in 70's fashion), a stilted tone apparently intended to evoke dismal feelings I didn't buy, and an unlikable protagonist. The whole production seemed pretentious and disingenuous. Not what I remembered at all.

Still worth watching once, I suppose, for the (SPOILER ALERT) initial clothing fashion choice of an independent, unimpeded boy and the wingd fantasy dive. I dislike the violence and the stereotypical young hustler/adult scenes. There was nothing ""nice"" in this movie. My understanding from research is the filmmakers have a political agenda. Probably I am biased in a different direction for living a 70's childhood of pleasant, fun same-sex relations without drama in a safe, small community free of adult interference. I had the same independence, and the joy thereof including free train operator-compartment rides with the engineer! :) And nothing *bad* happened...",1437436800,,1066,5.270588235294118

8202840,5,B000RW5CCM,"It is wonderful to see 'Lakki' (Norwegian language, English subtitles) finally rescued from the VHS-only graveyard which still entombs many of its equally-auspicious siblings. The film won the 'Best Picture' award at the Griffoni Film Festival in 1992, and it is not difficult to see why. Director Sven Wam ('Sebastian' etc) has created a stunning arthouse work; a truly unforgettable exploration of a young male's tormented inner-struggles (brilliantly portrayed by the incredibly-talented Anders Borchgrevink).

Lakki is 14 and battles against multiple demons. His parents had a passionate love-hate relationship, and apparently broke up and reunited a number of times, before his father finally left and set up home with another woman. The violence of the passions have clearly taken a toll on Lakki. He fantasises about distant memories of a (fleeting) time when his parents were happy and calm, and imbues this memory with almost erotic significance. There is suggestion that Lakki has been treated by a psychotherapist in the past, and that he is apt to 'attacks'. Perhaps this mental disturbance is inherited from his mother, with whom he lives. A highly volatile character - possibly bi-polar - she swings between extreme happiness and utter despair, not helped by her abuse of alcohol and transitory flings with a string of male lovers (including a swimming coach who has bullied Lakki at school). Lakki's father is equally ineffectual and highly inconsistent in his approach to Lakki; ditching him in a bar, and forbidding him entry to his apartment (at the behest of his pregnant girlfriend).

The film starkly conveys the effects of such circumstances on Lakki's already troubled character. Unsurprisingly, the pressures and contradictory messages to which he is subject leave him lost, and he tumbles through a series of negative experiences at school, an attempt at hustling, drugs and steady mental deterioration. These experiences, seen through Lakki's confused perspective, are often times dream-like and surreal. Lakki frequently sees angel 'wings' beginning to sprout from his shoulder blades, as he tries to escape from whatever mental or physical turmoil in which he is currently embroiled. The imagery is consistently powerful: burning candles; uncontrollable fire; shining halos; bare white rooms with locked doors. The essence of 'Lakki' is well-summarised by the poignant visual of Lakki, floating naked in a lake, surrounded by childhood toys.

It will be clear from the above that 'Lakki' is very far from being a run-of-the-mill, heart-warming, coming-of-age flick. It is dark, gritty and offers no optimism. Further, the absence of linear story-telling means that Lakki's grim present is seen to exist contemporaneously with his past, revealed through hallucinatory flashbacks. 'Lakki' is an unmissable masterpiece of cinema, finally brought to DVD.",1194134400,23,2878,5.4774774774774775
