2042063,4,B0001XAPW4,"We took our four year old daughter to see this, and unlike many other recent children's movie offerings, this movie captivated her attention for the duration of the movie. She enjoyed the story--despite not being a huge Teacher's Pet fan--wasn't frightened by the mad scientist bits, and even seemed to enjoy the songs. Husband and I also enjoyed the little bits of Disney humor thrown into the mix. All of the voice characterizations were great, and Kelsey Grammar and Nathan Lane gave especially lovely performances. All in all, a very enjoyable little movie.",1074643200,8,561,5.043010752688172
2042064,4,B0001XAPW4,"""Teacher's Pet,"" is based on a television seris by the same name, that I have seen a couple of times. When I saw the commericals about the movie, I decided that I was going to see it in the theatres. I liked it. Another movie tfrom a television seris that went to the big screen was ""Hey Arnold The Movie,"" which I liked so much that I gave it five stars. I am not giving ""Teacher's Pet"" give stars because of it's extremly short length. I went to a twelve o' clock show, and including previews and me staying for the credits, I was out at one fifteen. It was probally about sixty-eight minutes long including the credits. The story is about sixty-three minutes long. That is a little short for a movie theatre film. ""Hey Arnold The Movie,"" was seventy-five minutes long, but that was oringally made for television. They weren't going to change it for the big screen. But now, the plot.
In the television seris, the ""Teacher's Pet,"" is a blue dog named Spot. He is the dog of a young boy named Leonard, who is the son of mary Lou, who works at Leonards school under the ruling of Principal Stricklar, who has a strong dislike of dogs. Spot lives with Leonard and Mary Lou and their two other pets, Mr. Jolly a bird, and Pretty Boy a cat. Spot's problem is that he could talk, and he wants to be a real boy. When Mary Lou gets nominated for a Teacher of the Year Award, she and Leonard travel miles to Florida for the finals. Spot is left at home, but when he sees a talk show he decides to find them. The Barry Anger Show has a segment with made scientist Dr. Ivan Krank who claims that he could turn any everyday animal, into a human being. Spot finds Leonard and Mary Lou and changes into his alter ego, ""human"" Scott. Spot attends school everyday as Scott and makes up a wild story to be able to join Mary Lou and Leonard on their trip to the Sunshine State. He mades it to Ivan's lab, and is turned into a man instead of a boy. Dog years would make him older than he thinks he is. Scott/Spot escapes from Krank who wants to use him to have living proof that he is not crazy and his experiments really do work. But Leonard begins finding out that it is hard to have a dog really be a man, and the plot thickens.
""Teacher's Pet,"" is a musical. There are short songs throughout the movie, and if you listen to the lyrics, they are just so funny. I found myself laughing alot during this movie, and not at smart jokes that makers seem to sneak into animated movies to appeal to older people. I laughed at the stupid humor and the obvious jokes. I liked it. I thought this movie had some perfect timing, and alot of perfect humor.
""Teacher's Pet,"" was, like the seris, made with tradional hand drawn animation, which is another reason why it was so short in lenght. It was not like ""Finding Nemo,"" which was so beautiful, and had images of beauty that you just want to take it all at once. This movie has animation the way it used to be done like decades ago, and sometimes I perfer that, because it shows that people can make movies without the extreme help of machine, like ""Finding Nemo."" That was made only with the help of a machine and numbers. I really liked ""Teacher's Pet,"" and it was clean, and funny, and had a great story, and it could be entertaining to people of any age. Like in my review title, it was short and sweet.
ENJOY!
Rated PG for some mildly crude humor.",1074384000,8,3378,4.255054432348367
2042065,3,B0001XAPW4,"No one ever said that January was a pleasant month at the box office. Anybody who has is a flat-out liar. And any movie critic around the country will tell you the exact same thing. For years, American movie-goers have been subjected to such train-wreck disasters as Kangaroo Jack, Snow Dogs, A Walk to Remember, and The Wedding Planner. Sorry to say, this year appears to be no different. This is why many of the less contemptible movie-goers tend to check-out films in Oscar contention rather then the pathetic trash cluttering the local Cineplex. Unfortunately for families with little children, other then staying at home, they will just have to grin and bare with what is given to them One feature this year, Teacher's Pet, should be familiar to someone as it was once a highly praised (and lowly rated) cartoon series on ABC's One Saturday Morning lineup. Since its cancellation, it has made many lucrative appearances on the Disney Company's Toon Disney cable network, which should make it all the more commercially success for its distributor. But in January, as with any season of the year at the box office, there is never such a thing as a ""sure thing"".
The story follows an ambitious talking dog as he yearns to become a real human boy. Scott Leadready II has perfect attendance at school, extraordinary grades, and pleasant manners; all in all he is the perfect boy that any mother wishes she had. The only problem is that Scott is actually a dog named Spot. For almost everyday of his life, Spot has wished to become a real human boy like his owner Leonard, so much so that he has disguised himself as Scott Leadready II and attended the fourth grade for the past year. Now that the school year is over, Spot is left home for two weeks while Leonard and his mother travel to Florida to attend an award ceremony for teachers. The emulous pup ends up tagging along when he sees a wack-o scientist from Florida on television claiming to be able to change animals into humans. Now there is nothing in the way of Spot and his ultimate goal of becoming a real boy! Unfortunately, he learns that changing species isn't all it's cracked up to be. The story for Teacher's Pet is pretty straight forward, simple and predictable. Basically it is everything one expects from a low-budgeted winter family animated film, which makes it all the more disappointing. The big problem for Pet is that it never maintains a level consistency. The film ranges from being surprisingly amusing to harrowingly dull and anything in-between as well.
Teacher's Pet has a surprisingly decent amount of recognizable names behind the voices of the characters, which makes it all the more baffling at why this film wasn't more entertaining for adults. Nathan Lane, who also brought life to Timon in The Lion King, voices the audacious Spot. Lane presents a voice-over performance that was worth a chuckle here and there but nothing that was extraordinarily funny. Kelsey Grammer gives a slightly accented voice-over performance as Dr. Ivan Krank that results in more awkward facial gestures from audience members then amusing glances. The only performer within the cast that even manages to make the more adult audience laugh is Jerry Stiller, who voices a bird named Pretty Boy. He gives a gruff voice-over that just cracks a smile on anybody's face at all the appropriate moments within the feature film. The reason behind this may be the fact that most older movie-goers may already know who Jerry Stiller is, which may or may not make this role all the more amusing than for those who don't know who he is.
Overall, younger audience members will enjoy this heralding story about a dog wishing to be a boy while younger adults will be wishing for the quickest exit out of the theater. Teacher's Pet borders on the line of moderate animated family entertainment and Ren & Stimpy-like weirdness. The film is filled with plenty moments where parents will be questioning what they want their kids to see or not, depending how young they are. One such moment would include a moment where Spot (as a human) suggests marrying Leonard's mom so he can be with his human owner without being a dog. This type of situation seems to cross the line of perversion but luckily it quickly crosses back to normality. The film-makers dash in several awkward song and dance performances that aren't remarkable or even memorable long after the credits have rolled. The biggest problem with Teacher's Pet is that it is nothing more then one expects going into this feature and, though it appeals to the younger crowd, doesn't present a level of maturity that many adults, parents or not, would be able to tolerate for over a hour. Luckily the time over that one hour is only an additional fifteen minutes.",1074384000,4,4768,4.78060606060606
2042066,5,B0001XAPW4,"This movie is awsome if you are a fan of Disney's classic animated films, becasue the creator of ""Teacher's Pet"" pays homage to a lot of them, including ""Pinocchio,"" ""Snow White,"" ""Sleeping Beauty,"" ""101 Dalmations,"" ""The Lion King,"" ""Peter Pan,"" and ""Dumbo."" The voice talent is also great and includes Nathan Lane, Jerry Stiller, and Kelsey Grammer. Adults and children were laughing and having a good time during the film.
Spot is a dog who wishes he was a boy, and somehow is able to fool everyone at school that he is one. But during summer vacation, he sees a mad scientist on tv who claims he can turn animals into humans. The first half of the movie is the road trip on the way to meet the looney doctor, and the second half is about Spot trying to fix a terrible mistake.
This film will teach children the valuable lesson of ""the grass is always greener."" I highley recomend that you take your loved ones to see ""Teacher's Pet,"" because it is one of the best family films I've seen in a while.",1074384000,10,1002,4.451086956521739
2042067,4,B0001XAPW4,"This is a fun little movie, but be warned... it's a fun LITTLE movie.  The entire thing runs about an hour and 15 minutes, which wouldn't be a problem except for the fact that a main character and a minor character's (the mother and the principal) story arcs are left unfinshed at end.  It's as if Disney thought the movie was too long and decided to trim it down, but left setups intact.  I hope they weren't thinking ""we'll fix it for the DVD"".

Still, a good time for it's short duration.  Disney fans will enjoy various pokes and jabs at classic Disney movies.  Everything runs at a VERY brisk pace without a single missed moment. There's more than a few laugh-out-loud lines and visual gags that left a smile on my face throughout the entire movie.

If the 15 minutes I feel was cut for some reason or another was present, I'm still not sure I would consider it ""great"".  But as it stands for this theatrical release, it's a good, fun way to pass a little over an hour.",1074297600,,974,4.342541436464089
2042068,5,B0001XAPW4,"""Teacher's Pet"" is an excellent T.V show.  The writing is really good and the voice talents are great.  It is similar to ""SpongeBob"" in that it is totally origanal.  The show is all about Spot who's is a dog belonging to a boy named Leoanard.  Everyday Spot watches Leaonard go to school, wishing that he could too.  One day he finally decides to put on Leonards clothes and go to school! At school he's a top student who is incredibly enthusiastic about school and learning unlike the other kids in his class who have had the joy of learning taken out of them by way of grades and tests.  It is an incredibly fun show which will probably make a great movie.  I guess in the movie he decides that being a dog who dresses like a boy isn't enough-he wants to be a boy!",1070755200,12,766,4.241379310344827

2042084,4,B0001XAPW4,"This may not be as critically underrated as Hunchback of Notre Dame, but it was certainly financially underrated. I think where this film failed box-office wise was actually being given a theatrical release as it really does feel like a lengthened final episode. This should have been more of a direct-to-video/TV movie than a theatrical one because, really, who would want to pay full price to see a movie based off of a highly underrated show? Teacher's Pet, IMO, was the most well-written show on Disney's One Saturday Morning lineup, mostly backed up by a script that felt like it was written more for adults. The movie has most of this wit and that's why it works. Fans will truly enjoy it.

The songs are good but do leave a bit to be desired. I loved most of them, but there were a couple I felt it could have done without.

Those who never saw the show may be turned off by the character designs. Gary's style of animation is very strange when it comes to appearances, however, animation-wise, this guy's a master as he puts so much energy into the actions.

The humour had that same wit that the TV show was known for, even paying homage to 7 Disney classics. You might not notice them all the first time, but that's part of why it's so fun watching the film again. Some jokes I thought were kinda lame like ""I feel Von Trapped"", but then again, I have grown tired of puns these days, so that's just me.

The story felt like a good way to end the series. Spot finally becomes human and realizes it's not for him and goes back to his old life, but again, newbies will probably feel lost as to what's going on and only a few things are ever explained to them.

The voice actors do an excellent job, retaining their performances from the show, naturally Nathan Lane providing the best acting. Not much else to say on that matter.

I wanna get back to the whole animation thing.  Anyone who hates on this film for its animations doesn't know the difference between character designs and animation and is also a hypocrite.  Think about it.  I don't people hating on The Triplettes of Belleville despite its ugly character designs.  Why?  Because the animations themselves are brilliant.  Fantastic Mr. Fox can look a bit awkward at times, but it's impressive for puppet animation.  Secret of Kells looks like a Saturday Morning cartoon but is still brilliant, and all 3 films I mentioned were nominated for academy awards!  So how can you get after this film for its animations?

Anyway, that's all I gotta say.",1281571200,,2515,4.545454545454546
2042085,5,B0001XAPW4,"This is a very funny, well written and well voiced film that got short shrift at the box office and deserves a new life on DVD.",1264291200,,127,3.923076923076923
2042086,5,B0001XAPW4,"My grandchildren have most of the popular movies, many oldies also.  I came across this accidentally on netflix; they loved it so much that I ordered it from amazon.  The children are 5 and 7, they've watched it so much they quote and sing lines from the movie and laugh all over again.  It has a more current humor, but is still appropriate.... much like Back at the Barnyard  t.v. series that they love.

 I highly recommend this forgotten movie for children.",1255824000,,461,4.560975609756097
2042087,4,B0001XAPW4,"""A nice surprise"" is probably how I would best describe this animated film. The artwork on the cover makes it look as if it was made for four-year-old audiences but it is hardly that. It is very funny with so many gags I lost count. Those jokes are both audio and visual.

Nathan Lane's New York City accent was funny as he voiced the lead character, ""Spot,"" the dog who wanted to be changed into a little boy. Actually, all the characters are pretty funny and the songs aren't bad, either. I am not usually a fan of these kids' musicals but the songs were short and the lyrics were humorous. And - I didn't really view this as a kids movie since the vocabulary and the jokes were geared (in a non-offensive way) more toward adults.

I understand some parents, in fact, were upset at this movie for that very reason - the jokes go over the heads of most kids in here.  That is true.",1241395200,,882,4.269461077844311
2042088,5,B0001XAPW4,"When I was 10, and got a copy of this movie at Blockbuster, I loved this movie. I wasn't sure if there was a TV show on it or not but it was my favorite movie. The only thing that suprised me was that they didn't show credits at the begining (name, actors, director etc) of the movie. But it was my favorite movie that I could watch again and again. I really liked the movie and was a great film. I wasn't so comfortable when I saw it at the movies way then for the first time but it was a favorite of mine.",1219017600,2,507,3.8380952380952382
2042089,3,B0001XAPW4,"The cast is as brilliant as ever, but there really isn't enough plot to hold this together for a feature length film.  It's never as ""laugh so hard you think you'll pee yourself"" funny as the cartoons were - nor is there as much in it for the adults as there was in the cartoon.  The message is simple - ""be careful what you wish for"" - and I suppose that's fine, it's just that with the acting range of all the voice talents, and the superb quality of the tv series, I was expecting more.  This is not at all to say it sucked - it's plenty funny, and I made it through the whole thing, but I haven't memorized it like I have with other recent animation classics like Shrek, and I have no great desire to watch it again.

Personally, I'm waiting for the anthology of the series, that's what I really am looking forward to.  I LOVE to watch the monkeys dance!",1176854400,,858,4.144578313253012

2042091,3,B0001XAPW4,"I was disappointed in this movie.  I love Nathan Lane and musicals, so I was prepared to be dazzled.  Sadly, it was not to be.

The kids were puzzled (10, 8 and 4 years old),because many of the jokes and vocabulary were geared for adults.  We liked the story line, it had tremendous voice talent. (I have no need to describe the plot as many others have already done so.)  The real disappointment was the animation, the characters were really ugly, the facial expressions lacking.

The characters were not enjoyable - they were not likeable.  The kids were quiet trying to figure it out!  I would not spend the money to buy it, it's barely worth renting.",1093996800,3,654,4.52991452991453
2042092,5,B0001XAPW4,"This movie is the funniest musical Nathan Lane has done since 'The Producers'. A feature length version of the Disney series showcasing the artwork of Gary Baseman, the movie carries over the plot line of a dog dressing like and pretending to be a little boy, whose wish is to be a real boy, ala Pinocchio. The movie even starts as a send-up of the Disney classic, but done in the twisted, quirky Baseman style. The movie's plot has the dog Spot, whose secret identity is that of Scott Leadready II (both voiced by Nathan Lane), trying to follow his master Leonard to Florida to seek out the services of wacko Dr. Ivan Krank (voiced by Kelsey Grammer) who can turn animals into human beings. When Spot/Scott's fellow pets, the cat Mr. Jolly (David Ogden Stiers) and green canary Pretty Boy (Jerry Stiller) discover how dangerous the Doctor's experiments are, they also head to Florida to warn Spot. Will Dr. Krank's experiment succeed? Will Mr. Jolly and Pretty Boy get there in time? Will Leonard lose a dog and gain a father with lower back pain? Will Spot's dream to become human come true? And how many show stopping tunes can Nathan Lane sing in under 80 minutes?

There are several clever musical numbers in this film, perhaps the most subversive animated Disney musical of all time, the songs reflecting the twisted spirit of Gary Baseman's drawings. And there are so many clever gags and in-jokes throughout the film, that you'll keep hitting the pause button to catch all of them. The send-ups of such Disney classics as 'Pinocchio' and 'Snow White' is almost worth the admission alone.

For those who couldn't afford a ticket to see Nathan Lane in 'The Producers' on Broadway, you can buy this DVD at less than a fraction of the cost for a 'Producers' ticket, and have just as much fun. The animation is colorful enough to keep the attention of the kiddies while the jokes and songs will keep adults in stitches. I watched this movie with my niece and nephew and we all had a great time. For fans of the art of Gary Baseman, this DVD is a must-have. Bonus features include a profile of Gary Baseman with interviews with Nathan Lane, David Ogden Stiers, Jerry Stiller and Wallace Shawn. There are two hilarious deleted scenes, a music video, and a special 'songs only' selection with lyrics. Treat yourself to this quirky, kooky laugh-filled Disney movie",1090627200,13,2363,4.691566265060241
2042093,1,B0001XAPW4,"The term ""family film"" really gets me angry. Why? Because for every film that is out there that is good enough to be for the entire family, there are at least 50 others that are not only wasting their parent's time, but they are not respecting their intended audience. Disney's new animated film TEACHER'S PET is both patronizing and extremely sloppy.
Spot Helperman(Voiced by Nathan Lane, The Lion King) is a dog who longs to be a real boy. He dresses up like a little boy and goes to school with his master Leonard (Shaun Fleming, Jeepers Creepers 2), and for some odd reason Leonard's mother (Debra Joy Rupp, TV's That 70's Show) is their teacher. When Leonard's mother wins a trip to Florida, Leonard longs to have fun on the beach with his dog. Spot wants to go to Florida to meet a wacko doctor (Kelsey Grammer) who can turn animals into humans.
As I sat through this supposed ""musical comedy"" I asked myself, Why? Who in their right mind said this film was worthy enough to make? Who said ""hey the script is ready, let's make this movie?"" The simple answer is money. But let's be honest, this turkey is not going to make any money. This is not the film that is going to be locked in the Disney Vault for ten years, to be released with much fanfare.
This is a shoddy movie that aspires to be HEY ARNOLD, THE MOVIE. Its script is not technically a story, it is bad jokes designed to stretch running time. TEACHER'S PET is a 15 minute animated short with over an hour of bad jokes designed to stretch the running time.
Most would probably say, ""why are you being so hard on this movie? It's designed for little kids not a 24 year old male."" I say if you are going to spend large amounts of money on a film and you expect parents to bring their little tykes, and you create a film that makes even a toddler bored, I cannot go easy on it.
This film has no charm. The jokes are too abrasive, and there are far too many things going on. It also features this really odd subplot involving Spot and Leonard's mother that made me feel really, really uncomfortable. Its inclusion was both unnecessary and hard to explain without making it sound sicker than it really is.
Finally I muse about the PG rating for this film. Why? It will play well only to four or five year olds. When I think of a PG movie I think of kids between 8-10. Why create a film geared at toddlers and market it to seven-year olds? You got me. I don't know why this film is PG. It contains no bad language, no sex, and no real violence. It's not even scary. If anyone can figure this out, I will give you a hearty handshake.
If you are looking to waste a child's time, stay at home and rent ET. They'll love it. TEACHER'S PET on the other hand is a vapid mess. If you want my advice, instead of dropping forty bucks to take the brood to see this film, spend that money on a really big cardboard box. Your kids will have far more fun with that.

This is a movie based on the series of the same name. This cute musical comedy is smart and silly.

The opening scene sets up the premise of the whole movie: Spot (played by Nathan Lane) is dreaming that he's watching Pinocchio and he says that he'd give anything if he could change into a real boy like him. Spot wants this more than anything. Will his wish come true? Youre gonna have to watch and find out = )

I am not typically a fan of musicals but I really enjoyed this film and all of its musical numbers. They are creative and witty. When this movie is on my kids usually sit quiet and are captivated by the sharp plot and catchy musicals. I would definitely recommend this movie.
