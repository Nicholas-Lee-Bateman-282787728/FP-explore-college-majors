3105532,5,B0013F60LE,"This superb five part series was a true delight for me.  I have to admit to a fascination with the British Royal Family.  I understand that is not necessarily a popular opinion in Britian or in America but I have always admired Queen Elizabeth for her steadfast sense of purpose and her willingness to continue placing herself in the public light when it isn't any longer necessary to do so.  To watch an institution such as the royal family at work was entertaining and instructive and, at times, just plain fun.  The film crew was allowed unprecedented access over a one year period to the daily life of this woman who at 81 (at the time of filming) had been on the throne for 55 years.

This BBC series is presented in five parts as follows, with each part being approximately one hour in length.

1.  THE STATE VISIT - This episode shows the Queen both in front of and behind the cameras during a State Visit to the United States.  Included are the State Dinner in Washington, a private luncheon in the White House, two functions at the British Embassy in Washington, a visit to Williamsburg, Virginia with a stay at the Williamsburg Inn in Colonial Williamsburg, Jamestown Colony, Richmond, Virginia and a side trip to the Kentucky Derby.

2.  HEADQUARTERS - Here the focus is mainly on Buckingham Palace and the arrangements necessary for a State Visit from the Nigerian President and his wife.  It was exceedingly interesting to watch how hands-on the Queen was in all matters even down to trying to help figure out why the lift wasn't working.

3.  HEAD OF STATE - Because the Queen is head of a constitutional monarchy she is still considered Head of Parliament (although in name only), the Armed Forces and the Church of England.  This segment focused on the preperations for the Opening of Parliament, the speech given by the Queen, and her association with various branches of the military.

4.  THE QUEEN AND US - The annual Garden Party hosted by Her Majesty was presented from the viewpoint of some of those invited to attend.  This segment focused most often on the Queen and her changing connections with British subjects.  At one very, very small day-care center she was so intimate with those parents and children that one child threw a ball which rolled right to the Queen.  She resisted the temptation to play ball with the child!

5.  INSIDE THE FIRM - This is the episode which features other members of the Royal Family.  We see both Prince William and Prince Harry in very informal meetings with charities of which they are patrons and other Royals in slightly more formal settings.  One of my favorites was when Prince Charles went to visit a small farm and had tea around the kitchen table from a tea set which was good enough for the family so why not use it to serve him?  Lovely!

There is also a 30 minute bonus section showing footage not presented during the other five segments.  Some were cute, some funny, but I found all of them extremely enlightening.  As I would expect from any BBC production, this film is incredibly wonderful from a technical aspect.

If you are not a fan of the present Queen of England or a system of Monarchy in general, this series will not change your mind.  I, on the other hand, was simply amazed to be allowed to watch the members of this family go about their daily lives while making their total of 4,000 appearances within a one year period.  No matter what you may think about this Monarchy, they do much more than many people are aware of.",1235260800,25,3511,4.58908507223114

3105535,5,B0013F60LE,"Since 1969 The Queen has allowed cameras to film her and her family's private lives for documentaries several times.  I've watched all of these and found them fairly interesting, but none really gave me the sense that I was really watching the Windsors ""behind the scenes"".  There was always the feeling that they were posing for the camera and on their best behavior, as indeed they have to be most of the time.  But in Monarchy: The Royal Family At Work""I really felt for the first time that I was seeing the Royal Family as they truly are: a rather ordinary group of people required by the circumstance of their birth to be placed on a pedestal, but who don't really take themselves all that seriously.  I saw this particularly with The Queen herself.  Now that she's in her 80s, and after going through what must have been a pretty rotten time of it for the last twenty five years or so, she seems more relaxed and informal than I've ever seen her.  She smiles at the camera, makes little asides from time to time, and generally seems to be enjoying herself.  I particularly liked the scenes showing a State Visit to Buckingham Palace when an elevator had broken down, and The Queen was shown scurrying around and actually hanging over a bannister to see how her guests were going to get upstairs (eventually she laughed and told us ""they're coming up in the staff lift!"")  I also enjoyed another scene where The Queen reminded us of how regal she can be when the photographer Annie Liebowitz had the temerity to ask her to take off her tiara because it was too dressy.  The Queen snorted and said ""What do you think this is?"" gesturing at her Garter robes.

Another appealing aspect of this series is its focus on the preparations others make for The Queen when she makes an appearance, and how every detail is meticulously taken care of.  Other segments deal with the servants who wait on The Queen, allowing us more insight into the running of a palace and how humdrum it can be, no matter how glamourous the settings may be.

Queen Elizabeth II's public life has been exhaustively chronicled almost from the moment of her birth.  Now in this series we can get, for possibly the first time, a real sense of her as a private person.",1227830400,44,2238,4.537313432835821
3105536,5,B0013F60LE,"I find learning about cultures other than my own (well my own too, whatever it is) really an enjoyable activity. This series, ""Monarchy: The Royal Family at Work"", is simply first rate, quality television. You get that ""fly on a wall"" effect really well and considering the settings in which each episode unfolds what better place is there to experience that sensation? Well I guess I can think of others, however comparing those to these weird scenes that is the life of the British Royal Family--the countless events, ceremonies, parties, dinners.. all the little and not so little rituals and customes ain't the point. Obviously it's pretty unique and just plain kinda weird to my mind when I think about it. Visually the show is a knockout. I've found myself twice coming across it while channel surfing and drinking Bud Lights and as I got a buzz I noticed that I love drinking and watching the Royal Family and the upper class and rulers of the planet have their get togethers and play dress up. Very odd. I felt utterly content just watching. Maybe it's cause I'd very much want to be buzzed if I were there. One highlight was the Queen's trip to the US. That was great seeing her go to the White House and all that goes into that and her meeting President Bush and Laura. In anycase a real good show.",1227139200,,1308,4.5702127659574465
3105537,3,B0013F60LE,"This is a good quality production that lets us have some insight into the life of Queen Elizabeth 11.  Although the documentary is entitled The Royal Family at work, its mostly about the Queen.  Some parts are much too drawn out like ALL the detailed preparations for the Queen's arrival in the US, it just goes on and on.
Its interesting to see how much this 82 year old monarch does, and also her children, however, I did miss seeing the unique interaction between this family, they all seem to work independently for the same cause, so to speak.",1222560000,6,548,4.525252525252525
3105538,5,B0013F60LE,"This is an excellent documentary and behind the scenes access on how the British Monarchy works in the 21st century! From the state visit to the U.S. to the graduation of Prince William from the military academy, all of it was excellent!

There is one thing that surprised me in this documentary, both the current President Bush and Prince Charles have this habit of telling bad jokes on certain occasions.",1221004800,2,406,4.8
3105539,5,B0013F60LE,"This is illuminating five part series which was originally broadcasted on ABC as the abridged special ""The Royal Family"" provides great insight into the work of the Queen and the other members of her family throughout the span of one year. It shows exclusive access to other members of the royal family, including Prince William, Prince Charles and Prince Harry.

If I'm not mistaken in November 2008 this series will be broadcasted nationally on PBS, adding to the already 14.2 million viewers who have watched it on ABC. Unlike any other dvd about the royal family, this one surely uncovers their lives away from the glare of the public eye.",1214870400,10,643,4.845454545454546
3105540,5,B0013F60LE,"Let me preface this review with the fact that I have never really understood the level of fascination that some folks have for 'the royal family'. Let me then say that having watched the abridged version of this on ABC earlier in the year (Feb 08 I believe) really took me by surprise, as I found myself totally riveted to the goings on... the pomp of it all... the wondrous ceremony of everything.

The abridged version was entitled ""The Royal Family"" and ran some 90 minutes with Barbara Walters slipped in as narrator. This DVD version will be released in its full-length original glory as created for the BBC and while I would never have predicted it about myself, I am totally looking forward to seeing it. Original British narration should lend more credence to a program that takes the viewer inside royal life in epic proportion.

It is comprised of 5 episodes & 1 episode that's a special feature at 30 minutes long. Episode 1 is 90 minutes long, & all others are 60 minutes long. The narrator's voice is easy to listen to and follow; the background music is very pretty & correlates with the subject matter of this series; etc.

3105553,5,B0013F60LE,"This 2-disc set shows the official duties of Elizabeth II after 50 years on the throne.

The first DVD focuses on the 3rd state visit of Elizabeth II to the U.S. while President George W. Bush was in office.

The second DVD follows the queen as she carries out her official duties for one year.  The documentary is actually about the scores and sometimes hundreds of people involved in preparing and accompanying the queen and making the events appear flawless.

The set doesn't really cover her family or personal life.  This is a BBC production that was distributed and shown in the U.S. on P.B.S. Elizabeth II is conscientious, engaging and takes her responsibilities as a constitutional monarch very seriously.

This set would be of interest to anglophiles and people interested in seeing how the queen functions in today's world.  It is not a historical chronical of her reign over the decades.

The photography is beautiful and is well worth the price.  I enjoyed viewing both DVDs and plan to keep the set.",1345334400,2,1013,4.809248554913295

3105555,5,B0013F60LE,"For anyone who is curious what daily life is like for the Royals, this 5-part documentary is as good as it gets.  I have no doubt that everything we see is totally staged, but still, we get a good sense of the royal fishbowl and how it turns.  I felt that the Queen was remarkably good-natured considering there were cameras in her face all the time. Her subjects clearly love her (there was some footage of an anti-monarchy demonstration but much more civilized than some of the comments in the reviews here, ahem).

My favorite chapter was the last one about The Family Firm where many members of the Royal Family had their moment in the spotlight.  I had to Google the Duke of Gloucester (he is the Queen's first cousin, the second son of the younger brother of Edward VIII and George VI).  It was cool seeing Prince Charles speaking for himself - I must admit I have only seen him portrayed by various actors in various movies since he married Diana.  The real guy is actually quite personable, based on his footage.  Seeing William and Harry was fun, too, and catching a glimpse of William's then-girlfriend Kate Middleton at a military ceremony.

Princess Anne, with a reputation as the hardest-working Royal and possibly the most respected after her mom, talks about how tough the early royal gigs were and how poorly she felt she performed.  She is, not surprisingly, quite down to earth.  Andrew was a bit of an eye-opener.  He focuses on enhancing the image of UK business in the international community.  He is not camera friendly.

Finally I was especially interested in the footage of Prince Edward.  People tend to forget about him.  Seeing him at the recent Royal Wedding inspired me to dig up a book I have always been meaning to read called Edward Windsor Royal Enigma: The True Story of the 7th In Line to the British Throne.  I am about halfway through, and he's a pretty fascinating character.  In Monarchy he seems eager to show off his flair for the dramatic, acting like a Hollywood film director when stage managing a state occasion.  A little needy, maybe.

There is much, much more to this series - 330 minutes of it, including 30 minutes consisting of little vignettes that were consigned to the cutting room floor.  I thought it was fascinating.  Not for everyone, perhaps, but worth it if you are even a little bit curious about the monarchy.",1305676800,2,2371,4.6514423076923075
3105556,4,B0013F60LE,"The title says it all - The Royal Family at Work. One tea/dinner party after another, with the occasional investiture - very well done.",1303689600,,135,4.666666666666667
3105557,3,B0013F60LE,"I'm watching this piece of drivel on PBS right now.  The best part of it are the cutshots to Americans with rural accents that are peeing themselves at the prospect of shaking her hand.  I mean to think that here in America we roll out a red carpet for her when we should be cuffing her and sticking her in the Hague for war crimes.  Isn't the entire point of America the destruction of the British Monarchy (and the end of kings the world over?).  I guess not.

There was one scene where an American said that they loved the queen because she dedicated her entire life to better her people, (except, apparently, if you're Irish, Welsh, Scots, Canadian, Australian, New Zealander, Guianan, Indian, South African, Argentinian, or a British subject).  Maybe she meant ""her people"" as ""the royal family""

Just because of this,  I will never, ever, donate any money to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and I will wholeheartedly support cuts to the federal subsidies to PBS.  As a matter of fact,  if I ever see anyone with a PBS logo on anywhere I'm going to beat him up and steal his wallet.",1298160000,2,1095,4.569230769230769
3105558,5,B0013F60LE,"`Monarchy' is an outstanding 5 part BBC series that gives us an inside view of the royal life. This looks at many aspects of royal life and follows the Queen as she travels to America to meet the President (George Bush at the time), hosts various teas, lunches, banquets and balls in the UK (and shows the meticulous detail that goes into the preparation), the various investitures she presides over, her state opening of parliament, her visits to charities, the opening of various buildings and sites and her assorted other duties. This also looks at the other key members of the royal family and what they get up to as well. It is fascinating to see how they live and work and you will be touched at numerous times at how down to earth they are and adept at their various roles. You will also be left gob smacked at the pomp and ceremony of various events and will appreciate the heritage and meaning behind many state events. This gave me an insight into royal life that has previously been unavailable and if the Queen wanted to open her self up to her subjects then this achieved that goal superbly. The palaces and stately homes are stunning, the costumes are impressive and you can't help but feel a swell of patriotism in your chest when you see how reverred and respected the Queen is abroad. There is also an additional bonus footage section that shows some elements that were cut from the original broadcast. All in all this is a fascinating look at the royal family and shows what they do for the country. It also shows how impressively and grandly the other half live!

3340032,5,B0013F60LE,"Since 1969 The Queen has allowed cameras to film her and her family's private lives for documentaries several times.  I've watched all of these and found them fairly interesting, but none really gave me the sense that I was really watching the Windsors ""behind the scenes"".  There was always the feeling that they were posing for the camera and on their best behavior, as indeed they have to be most of the time.  But in Monarchy: The Royal Family At Work""I really felt for the first time that I was seeing the Royal Family as they truly are: a rather ordinary group of people required by the circumstance of their birth to be placed on a pedestal, but who don't really take themselves all that seriously.  I saw this particularly with The Queen herself.  Now that she's in her 80s, and after going through what must have been a pretty rotten time of it for the last twenty five years or so, she seems more relaxed and informal than I've ever seen her.  She smiles at the camera, makes little asides from time to time, and generally seems to be enjoying herself.  I particularly liked the scenes showing a State Visit to Buckingham Palace when an elevator had broken down, and The Queen was shown scurrying around and actually hanging over a bannister to see how her guests were going to get upstairs (eventually she laughed and told us ""they're coming up in the staff lift!"")  I also enjoyed another scene where The Queen reminded us of how regal she can be when the photographer Annie Liebowitz had the temerity to ask her to take off her tiara because it was too dressy.  The Queen snorted and said ""What do you think this is?"" gesturing at her Garter robes.

Another appealing aspect of this series is its focus on the preparations others make for The Queen when she makes an appearance, and how every detail is meticulously taken care of.  Other segments deal with the servants who wait on The Queen, allowing us more insight into the running of a palace and how humdrum it can be, no matter how glamourous the settings may be.

Queen Elizabeth II's public life has been exhaustively chronicled almost from the moment of her birth.  Now in this series we can get, for possibly the first time, a real sense of her as a private person.",1227830400,44,2238,4.537313432835821
3340033,5,B0013F60LE,"I find learning about cultures other than my own (well my own too, whatever it is) really an enjoyable activity. This series, ""Monarchy: The Royal Family at Work"", is simply first rate, quality television. You get that ""fly on a wall"" effect really well and considering the settings in which each episode unfolds what better place is there to experience that sensation? Well I guess I can think of others, however comparing those to these weird scenes that is the life of the British Royal Family--the countless events, ceremonies, parties, dinners.. all the little and not so little rituals and customes ain't the point. Obviously it's pretty unique and just plain kinda weird to my mind when I think about it. Visually the show is a knockout. I've found myself twice coming across it while channel surfing and drinking Bud Lights and as I got a buzz I noticed that I love drinking and watching the Royal Family and the upper class and rulers of the planet have their get togethers and play dress up. Very odd. I felt utterly content just watching. Maybe it's cause I'd very much want to be buzzed if I were there. One highlight was the Queen's trip to the US. That was great seeing her go to the White House and all that goes into that and her meeting President Bush and Laura. In anycase a real good show.",1227139200,,1308,4.5702127659574465
3340034,3,B0013F60LE,"This is a good quality production that lets us have some insight into the life of Queen Elizabeth 11.  Although the documentary is entitled The Royal Family at work, its mostly about the Queen.  Some parts are much too drawn out like ALL the detailed preparations for the Queen's arrival in the US, it just goes on and on.
Its interesting to see how much this 82 year old monarch does, and also her children, however, I did miss seeing the unique interaction between this family, they all seem to work independently for the same cause, so to speak.",1222560000,6,548,4.525252525252525
3340035,5,B0013F60LE,"This is an excellent documentary and behind the scenes access on how the British Monarchy works in the 21st century! From the state visit to the U.S. to the graduation of Prince William from the military academy, all of it was excellent!

There is one thing that surprised me in this documentary, both the current President Bush and Prince Charles have this habit of telling bad jokes on certain occasions.",1221004800,2,406,4.8
3340036,5,B0013F60LE,"This is illuminating five part series which was originally broadcasted on ABC as the abridged special ""The Royal Family"" provides great insight into the work of the Queen and the other members of her family throughout the span of one year. It shows exclusive access to other members of the royal family, including Prince William, Prince Charles and Prince Harry.

If I'm not mistaken in November 2008 this series will be broadcasted nationally on PBS, adding to the already 14.2 million viewers who have watched it on ABC. Unlike any other dvd about the royal family, this one surely uncovers their lives away from the glare of the public eye.",1214870400,10,643,4.845454545454546
3340037,5,B0013F60LE,"Let me preface this review with the fact that I have never really understood the level of fascination that some folks have for 'the royal family'. Let me then say that having watched the abridged version of this on ABC earlier in the year (Feb 08 I believe) really took me by surprise, as I found myself totally riveted to the goings on... the pomp of it all... the wondrous ceremony of everything.

The abridged version was entitled ""The Royal Family"" and ran some 90 minutes with Barbara Walters slipped in as narrator. This DVD version will be released in its full-length original glory as created for the BBC and while I would never have predicted it about myself, I am totally looking forward to seeing it. Original British narration should lend more credence to a program that takes the viewer inside royal life in epic proportion.

If I were king of the forest.....",1214870400,25,872,4.6558441558441555

Above all, it takes the time to follow the inner workings of much of what the Royals do and has lots of interviews with members of the Royal Family. In my opinion, the best of all the DVDs out there.

3340046,5,B0013F60LE,"I purchased this show after seeing it for the first time several years ago on the PBS television station. It is a superb documentation for anyone who wants to learn more about Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II & the British Monarchy in general.

It is comprised of 5 episodes & 1 episode that's a special feature at 30 minutes long. Episode 1 is 90 minutes long, & all others are 60 minutes long. The narrator's voice is easy to listen to and follow; the background music is very pretty & correlates with the subject matter of this series; etc.

Being an avid lover of anything to do with British history, I found this series to be very informational. I learned a lot from watching it.",1391212800,,683,4.456

The royal family does it all, and with amazing control, dignity,  and bravery.  If you love the whole idea of royalty, if you love England, if you love heritage, history, you'll love this.",1364860800,,366,4.484848484848484

3340050,5,B0013F60LE,"This 2-disc set shows the official duties of Elizabeth II after 50 years on the throne.

The first DVD focuses on the 3rd state visit of Elizabeth II to the U.S. while President George W. Bush was in office.

The second DVD follows the queen as she carries out her official duties for one year.  The documentary is actually about the scores and sometimes hundreds of people involved in preparing and accompanying the queen and making the events appear flawless.

The set doesn't really cover her family or personal life.  This is a BBC production that was distributed and shown in the U.S. on P.B.S. Elizabeth II is conscientious, engaging and takes her responsibilities as a constitutional monarch very seriously.

This set would be of interest to anglophiles and people interested in seeing how the queen functions in today's world.  It is not a historical chronical of her reign over the decades.

The photography is beautiful and is well worth the price.  I enjoyed viewing both DVDs and plan to keep the set.",1345334400,2,1013,4.809248554913295
3340051,5,B0013F60LE,"Great video of PBS Special.  Extra Feature not on PBS.  Very quick delivery of item.  I viewed a few segments on cable, but wanted the entire documentary to watch in order.  The type of program you would enjoy watching again every few years.",1343001600,,241,4.534883720930233
3340052,5,B0013F60LE,"For anyone who is curious what daily life is like for the Royals, this 5-part documentary is as good as it gets.  I have no doubt that everything we see is totally staged, but still, we get a good sense of the royal fishbowl and how it turns.  I felt that the Queen was remarkably good-natured considering there were cameras in her face all the time. Her subjects clearly love her (there was some footage of an anti-monarchy demonstration but much more civilized than some of the comments in the reviews here, ahem).

My favorite chapter was the last one about The Family Firm where many members of the Royal Family had their moment in the spotlight.  I had to Google the Duke of Gloucester (he is the Queen's first cousin, the second son of the younger brother of Edward VIII and George VI).  It was cool seeing Prince Charles speaking for himself - I must admit I have only seen him portrayed by various actors in various movies since he married Diana.  The real guy is actually quite personable, based on his footage.  Seeing William and Harry was fun, too, and catching a glimpse of William's then-girlfriend Kate Middleton at a military ceremony.

Princess Anne, with a reputation as the hardest-working Royal and possibly the most respected after her mom, talks about how tough the early royal gigs were and how poorly she felt she performed.  She is, not surprisingly, quite down to earth.  Andrew was a bit of an eye-opener.  He focuses on enhancing the image of UK business in the international community.  He is not camera friendly.

Finally I was especially interested in the footage of Prince Edward.  People tend to forget about him.  Seeing him at the recent Royal Wedding inspired me to dig up a book I have always been meaning to read called Edward Windsor Royal Enigma: The True Story of the 7th In Line to the British Throne.  I am about halfway through, and he's a pretty fascinating character.  In Monarchy he seems eager to show off his flair for the dramatic, acting like a Hollywood film director when stage managing a state occasion.  A little needy, maybe.

There is much, much more to this series - 330 minutes of it, including 30 minutes consisting of little vignettes that were consigned to the cutting room floor.  I thought it was fascinating.  Not for everyone, perhaps, but worth it if you are even a little bit curious about the monarchy.",1305676800,2,2371,4.6514423076923075
3340053,4,B0013F60LE,"The title says it all - The Royal Family at Work. One tea/dinner party after another, with the occasional investiture - very well done.",1303689600,,135,4.666666666666667
3340054,3,B0013F60LE,"I'm watching this piece of drivel on PBS right now.  The best part of it are the cutshots to Americans with rural accents that are peeing themselves at the prospect of shaking her hand.  I mean to think that here in America we roll out a red carpet for her when we should be cuffing her and sticking her in the Hague for war crimes.  Isn't the entire point of America the destruction of the British Monarchy (and the end of kings the world over?).  I guess not.

There was one scene where an American said that they loved the queen because she dedicated her entire life to better her people, (except, apparently, if you're Irish, Welsh, Scots, Canadian, Australian, New Zealander, Guianan, Indian, South African, Argentinian, or a British subject).  Maybe she meant ""her people"" as ""the royal family""

Just because of this,  I will never, ever, donate any money to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and I will wholeheartedly support cuts to the federal subsidies to PBS.  As a matter of fact,  if I ever see anyone with a PBS logo on anywhere I'm going to beat him up and steal his wallet.",1298160000,2,1095,4.569230769230769
3340055,5,B0013F60LE,"`Monarchy' is an outstanding 5 part BBC series that gives us an inside view of the royal life. This looks at many aspects of royal life and follows the Queen as she travels to America to meet the President (George Bush at the time), hosts various teas, lunches, banquets and balls in the UK (and shows the meticulous detail that goes into the preparation), the various investitures she presides over, her state opening of parliament, her visits to charities, the opening of various buildings and sites and her assorted other duties. This also looks at the other key members of the royal family and what they get up to as well. It is fascinating to see how they live and work and you will be touched at numerous times at how down to earth they are and adept at their various roles. You will also be left gob smacked at the pomp and ceremony of various events and will appreciate the heritage and meaning behind many state events. This gave me an insight into royal life that has previously been unavailable and if the Queen wanted to open her self up to her subjects then this achieved that goal superbly. The palaces and stately homes are stunning, the costumes are impressive and you can't help but feel a swell of patriotism in your chest when you see how reverred and respected the Queen is abroad. There is also an additional bonus footage section that shows some elements that were cut from the original broadcast. All in all this is a fascinating look at the royal family and shows what they do for the country. It also shows how impressively and grandly the other half live!
