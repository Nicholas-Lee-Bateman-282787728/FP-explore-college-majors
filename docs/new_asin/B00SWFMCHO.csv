6993904,4,B00SWFMCHO,"I like to watch animation, which means that I watch a lot of films aimed at children. If they are /really/ aimed at children, I usually don't enjoy them, however interesting the animation may be.

But this one I liked, not just the first time when I rented it, but also when I saw it after buying it. I'm not sure why; the story just worked for me in a way that other stories do not.",1443916800,2,383,4.0394736842105265

6993911,1,B00SWFMCHO,"This movie was like watching paint dry. It was painful. Both my toddlers didn't like it. One said they didn't like it and didn't want to watch it and the other just walked out of the room to do another activity. Personally the graphics are cute but the storyline was dry and negative for the most part. ""Yellow Bird"" is lacking confidence in everything especially himself. At the beginning of the film, a member of another flock dies but in the midsts of being on his death bed, he pleads for someone to help him. Yellow Bird is too frightened and calls out to the dying bird, ""I hope your not bleeding because I hate blood."" After the bird dies, Yellow Bird lies to the dead birds flock and claims he is to lead the migration to Africa. He ultimately does lead them but not without a lot of trouble... And a lot bickering about who's right and who's wrong throughout the entire film. Finally they reach Africa and the flock adopts him into their family. I struggled to force myself to finish this movie and my husband said they only reason he finished the movie is because we paid to rent it. Ultimately we won't watch this film again. I would not recommend to a friend to watch it because none of us enjoyed most of it. There are good parts but the bad outweighed the good unfortunately.",1430438400,16,1289,4.397489539748954

6993920,5,B00SWFMCHO,"Actually, my granddaughter under 2-years old asked Nana to watch ""bird"" daily.  She loves it and the characters are cute and it is easy for the little ones to follow the story.  All the grand kids from under 2 to 10 years old enjoyed it a lot.  I recommend it and plan to make costumes for my etsy shop and granddaughter for Halloween and dress up for next year.",1445904000,,362,4.217391304347826

8699575,4,B00SWFMCHO,"I would have given it 5 starts, however, there were a few dialogues that does not belong in the kids category....I wish the movie makers had not let it slide by, but they did....overall, the movie was well done...",1529712000,,213,4.487179487179487
8699576,3,B00SWFMCHO,"This would've been a solid 4 stars, but I had to deduct one star for the line. You know the line, right? Same line as always.

Same plot as always too.

It's the plot every animated movie about birds, cats, rabbits, ants, the other kind of antz, squirrels, and no small number of live-action human movies for that matter.

The plot:

1. Boy meets attractive girl. (Occasionally genders may vary.)
2. Boy lies to get ahead and soaks up the undeserved acclaim (optional).
3. Boy gets exposed as a betrayer (deservedly or not) as a wider resulting tragedy occurs.
4. Girl regurgitates the central line of the movie, ""I trusted you"" or ""You liked to me"" (or both).
5. Boy impressively defeats the villain or his own character flaw (or both) and usually in doing so, right all wrongs.
6. Boy gets a trophy, er, I mean, the girl.

Hmm, maybe 3 stars it too generous, but the acting, directing, script, and animation in this clone were reasonably good.",1523059200,,945,4.568047337278107

8699584,1,B00SWFMCHO,"Revolting!  Had to turn this off due to an inexplicable scene around 53 minutes where three birds are clearly DRUGGED. Their speech is slurred,  their eyes unfocused,  they make numerous innuendo laden comments: ""let's get higher,""  ""its great to get CRACKed up with you guys,"" ""Didn't I tell you it was the good stuff""...

Will be complaining to Amazon about this being in the ""Kids and Family"" genre. Sadly, they probably won't do anything about it,  like the two times I informed them ""CLEAN"" versions of songs on prime music were actually the EXPLICIT edits (f bombs).

Also disappointed that the Dove Foundation gave this a family friendly rating and said online that there aren't any drug references.

The moral of this movie is that modern parents have to be eternally vigilant.",1493942400,7,785,4.893939393939394
