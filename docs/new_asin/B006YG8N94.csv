Everythng in this film is just great:  story, effects, performances, sound, edition.  It is very original and exciting and it has the rare virtue of being a full action film with great dramatic moments and also, lots of laugh and fantasy.  You will adore it.  I did, even with the subtitles.",1394323200,,437,4.3875
8506465,5,B006YG8N94,"This movie was a pain to get even in Seoul where I live.  I wanted to order it through Amazon, but was SOL.  The clarity of the BluRay is noticeably better that the DVD.  There are lots of extras in the BluRay not in the DVD like how they prepped for scenes in the film, the film's opening screening, and interviews (no subtitles).  I rave about this film as a Westerner because the story is intriguing and I love how the characters transition from the past to present.  They cram action/romance/comedy into this along the lines of the original Indy Jones.  You really need to pay attention to the little things as they help you understand what is happening later in the film.",1321574400,,676,4.455284552845528
8506466,5,B006YG8N94,"This is one my favorite Asian movies. I would rate it actually a 4.5 but only over nitpicking because the demon's special affects were clearly CGI. Everything else is beautiful. The story is a hilarious action comedy, emphasis on action. Woochi's magic effects are fantastic, and the dialog is a great blend of one liners and sarcastic riffs. The many fighting scenes manage to be funny and well done at the same time. The story is simply a lot of fun to watch. Most of the time I forgot I was reading along with the subtitles. The movie does a great job of drawing you into the story. It keeps the pace moving and develops each character, so you quickly care about what's going to happen next. When I finally get a blue ray player, this will be one of the first movies I get. I already ordered the normal dvd.",1296345600,,810,4.370860927152318
8506467,2,B006YG8N94,"To start off, the rating about is not the film itself, but the complete inability to offer market flexibility. The Blu-Ray player is backwards compatible, but the same cannot be said of Blu-Rays on DVD players. I do not own a Blu-Ray player, and I do not intend to own it, just for one disc. But #%&$ having a film that's not even out on Netflix, and have it not be shown for purchase in any format except one you have to run out and buy a new system for is just plain inexcusable.",1282521600,,481,4.127659574468085
