VERY ENLIGHTENING !!!!
I would recommend this DVD to EVERYONE !!!",1517788800,,75,4.846153846153846
8260533,5,B0015YX5ZC,This video coincides with verses in the Bible:  It is truly amazing...  It erases any doubts about the existence of Moses' Mountain.  Everyone on this planet should see this video.,1497830400,,180,4.933333333333334
8260534,5,B0015YX5ZC,This is the one you should get. It tells you the truth about where Sinai really is.,1491350400,,83,3.9411764705882355
8260535,5,B0015YX5ZC,"Even though all the arab locals call it the ""mountain of moses"", the Saudi Arabian government prohibits foreigners from seeing this, has it fenced off under armed guard, and simply calls it an ""archaeological site"". Today, Mount Sinai is called ""Jabal Al Lawz"", and is located just south of Midian (now spelled ""madyan"") just across the Red Sea from Egypt in Arabia - exactly as stated in the Bible. Note how strikingly 100% accurate and literal the Bible actually is. The mountain's non-volcanic scorched top. The Hebrew markings everywhere, including 12 pillars for the tribes. The alter for the golden calf and its markings. The split rock of Horeb and its epic-scale water erosion evidence at its base in a region that only gets half an inch of rain per decade. All true, all still here, and increasingly being captured on cameras and documented. While Saudi Arabia says ""keep out"", God is still saying, ""Told ya so"".

General comments:
As with too many Christian/religious videos, the totally cheesey narration and opening title sequence will cause any atheist to laugh their way out the door before even getting to any of the many ""irrefutables"" that otherwise would have shocked them into silent acknowledgement of the obvious - that the Bible is not only true, but shockingly 100% accurate down to tiny details.

When the family that took 14 vacations to this site is being interviewed, the predictable drippingly sweet ""stuck in the 80s"" piano/keyboardy background music kicks in.  Seriously, the Christian film industry needs to stop yanking out the carpet from under its own feet like this.  It instantly renders the documentary - no matter how credible - as being ""just more touchy feely hocus pocus"", and thus summarily dismissed as such.  Ramp it up, filmmakers.  Get with the program here.

If you go to a restricted region of the world and record groundbreaking evidence - especially on this epic scale - learn how to hold the darned camera still.

Other than these minor complaints, this documentary is exactly what it is - epic scale, groundbreaking evidence that the Bible is 100% accurate and not just figurative or allegorical, all the way down to the tiny details.",1486080000,2,2186,4.953551912568306
8260536,5,B0015YX5ZC,"This is a must see, for all those seeking the Truth and Reality to stabilize their lives and souls.  The REAL mountain found, being guarded all these year's by Israel's enemies, the descendants of Ishmael.  How astounding, that hatred can last thru generations that long, instead of bringing their hearts to forgiveness and share this wonderful area with the world and proof of the land, where The God of the Universe, brought His people, to Worship Him, in the desert!!!",1398643200,,471,4.875
8260537,4,B0015YX5ZC,"You will be totally amazed at the info and video provided in Mountain of Fire - if you can survive the presentation! Constant interruptions of dramatic effect and unnecessary pauses. The presentation is almost completely ruined, but the information and video is worth the wait. Take an aspirin and enjoy!",1382659200,,304,5.1
8260538,5,B0015YX5ZC,"This version of the DVD is apparently hard to find, but we were able to borrow it from a friend to watch.  This is an amazing documentary of two men (one a former policeman/crime scene investigator and the other a wealthy commodities trader) who were inspired by astronaut Jim Irwin to research lost Biblical sites.  The two men go on the hunt for Mt. Sinai where Moses, leading the Israelites out of Egypt, was given the Ten Commandments by God.  Using the Bible as their guide, the two men film and explain why they believe the mountain is in Jabal al-Lawz in Saudi Arabia, not in the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt as has been the theory for many years.  The evidence is thoroughly convincing and exciting to watch as they enter restricted territory in order to prove their case.

The two eventually meet up with a family of four who lived in that area for 12 years while doing contract work.  They had explored and filmed these restricted areas as well.  Between the two groups, they present good evidence of Mt. Sinai's real location.  Most importantly, it is exciting evidence that events documented in the Bible such as the Ten Commandments, the burning bush, Elijah's cave, and others are true and took place here.

Videotape shows that little has changed on this mountain over these thousands of years, most likely because not many people have been allowed to visit this site.  Remains of the 12 pillars, the sacrificial altar, even the blackened surface of the mountain can be seen.  You will want to watch this a couple of times.  If you are not a believer, this one might just give you food for thought.  Like they say on this film, they may just be changing history.",1359936000,3,1673,4.611486486486487
8260539,5,B0015YX5ZC,"This video has live footage by two groups - a family and two friends  - of a burned mountain in Midian (in Saudi Arabia) with a split rock, a large altar, a chute for animals, a cave (where Elijah might have stayed), broken Israeli lamps, mountain markers (borders), and much more than lead to what seems to be conclusive evidence in my mind that this is the real Mount Sinai.  The traditional site which is in the Sinai peninsula has none of these features - it is a topographic impossibility.  The traditional site was apparently choosen by an ignorant national leader many hundreds of years ago and it ""took.""  The authors also justify the most likely place for the Israelites to have crossed the Red Sea.  You've got to see it to believe it.  It's only 46 minutes, but has extras that are well worth watching of unknown length.  Note: I disagree with the methods used by the two friends to obtain their part of the video.  They entered the country illegally for example.  Nevertheless the images shared on this video are powerful evidence that Mt. Sinai is not in the peninsula.  I recommend treading lightly with regard to this topic (the location of Mt. Sinai) as there have been some flaky people involved in the identification of Mt. Sinai (not associated with this video), but this is one piece of evidence well worth considering.",1309996800,8,1339,4.659574468085107

8260541,5,B0015YX5ZC,"An important teaching.  Few people teach about where the real Mt. Sinai is.
It is truly inspiring to see how the search participants are changed and humbled by their discovery!!!",1277942400,,178,4.933333333333334
