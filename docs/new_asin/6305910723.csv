1086953,5,6305910723,"For Fans of the controversial Heavy Metal band, this homevideo will be the ultimate Manowar experience. Much like other Manowar products, this video meets not only the rigorous quality standards (picture and sound) that the  band itself endorses - it's also specifically made for the true fans of the  band. While other bands often have little or no control regarding the  content and sound of homevideos, Manowar was involved in the production  process throughout - and it shows! The video features: Karl Logan joins  Manowar, Scott Columbus returns to Manowar, Orchestra Recording Session,  The Making of Return of the Warlord, Manowar's first tour of South America,  New Years Eve in Cleveland Ohio 96/97, Midwinter Motorcycle Madness, The  Entire Hell on Wheels Tour, Gods of Metal Milan Italy 97, Full Force 97 and  lots more!  Go out and get it!",961632000,3,851,5.057553956834532
7897548,5,6305910723,"This tape was in great condition, and the video is next to none as far as bands are concerned.  Manowar doesn't compromise their values, their taste, or their devotion to the fans who love them equally as much.  I'm not even a metal head, but these guys should be near the top of anyone's list as far as music greats are concerned.",1358208000,,331,4.32258064516129
7897549,2,6305910723,"This was the best we could get for a casual fan of the band at the time.  Seeing Parts 2 & 3 later really make this unnecessary.  If you haven't bought this yet, don't! Buy Part 2 followed by Part 3.  That will give you these guys live.  Beware, they do take themselves WAY too seriously!",1100649600,2,288,4.089285714285714
7897550,5,6305910723,"In all honesty, this has to be the best metal / rock documentary video I've seen in sometime. Drummer Scott Columbus returns and new guitarist Karl Logan is showcased, PLENTY in this two-hour video diary. Plus,'Hell On Earth, Part 1' held my full attention all the way through. Few music videos can do that. Plenty of extensive partying, bare [...], cursing and NO censor blocks. Now, that's what I call a REAL metal video. Gets really good in the second half. I cracked up at the snippet of a roadie dipping another roadie's hand in warm water while he was sleeping. Loved the 'on tour' clips of the band's insane gigs that took place in Germany, Brazil, Italy, Belgium, Hungary, Switzerland and Spain. Venues appear to be those five-to-seven thousand seaters. To bad Manowar isn't able to play arenas like that in the states. Apparently, these halls require extended ramps to make it possible for the band members to enter the stage on their motorcycles (Judas Priest,eat your heart out!). Their large outdoor festival in Austria has to be seen to be believed. Thoroughly enjoyed seeing live performances of the Manowar classics ""Courage"", the group's namesake ""Manowar"", ""The Power"", the head-riveting ""Kill With Power"", ""Hail And Kill"", plus the video for ""Return Of The Warlord"". A must-have for all Manowar fans, old or new. Manowar rules!!",1100390400,2,1346,4.960176991150442
7897551,1,6305910723,"... Half the DVD/Video looks like it was shot on a hand held video camera. Terrible sound mix and awful editing.
These guys are the Kings of Trash not metal.",1054944000,4,157,4.266666666666667
7897552,5,6305910723,"Let me preface this review by stating:
1. Manowar are the greatest band of all time; and
2. Generally, I am not a fan of music video or DVD.
That said, as a lover of all things Manowar, I was compelled to purchase this DVD.
This DVD gives the viewer an insight into the world of Manowar, both on tour and in the studio. Some people have taken issue with Joey DeMaio's ""posing"" on the DVD. In my view, Joey DeMaio's posturing is the most outstanding highlight of this DVD. Really, would you expect, or want, anything less? It was great to see that his sheer force of personality matches the power of his song writing and thunderous bass guitar!
Manowar are not just ""a band."" Their music, with brilliant musicianship as a foundation, is anthemic, powerful and triumphant. Above all things, it is positive and makes you feel great. This DVD is no exception: completely overblown, outrageous and bombastic. That is - 100% Manowar.
One thing is certain - you'll have a smile on your face the entire time and for mine, that's what it's all about.
PS: Joey - I've observed the style, the moves, the facial expressions and have taken them onboard. Superb stuff!!!",1025136000,9,1156,4.5893719806763285

7897554,4,6305910723,if you are a fan of MANOWAR (if you ever listen to them you will be)you will love this DVD. great sound in DD5.1 or 2.0 no matter what sergeanthartman says (he must not have a dolby digital decoder). the only reason it's not five stars is there is not enough music and too much posing by Joey D.,1019520000,5,295,4.016949152542373
7897555,5,6305910723,"I bought this DVD first time I laid my eyes on it and I surely wasn't dissapointed! ManOwaR always delivers and in big style! Same here, we get a first quality, almost and 2 and half hours long film that covers recording of the Louder on Hell album, Hell on Wheels tour from 1997. and many other things from ManOwaR's life (travelling the Europe on Harleys, fooling around with hot babes, meeting the fans, drinking, partying etc.). This is really a rocket ride with the best and most important Heavy Metal band in the universe.
I already had VHS version of this video, but the DVD is much better, esp. soundwise (5.1 digital surround sound is guaranteed to blow your roof off!), but the picture quality is also perfect (and thankfully not in wide-screen for us poor guys without such TV-s). Plus you get additional 14 minutes of footage that VHS version didn't have.
If there ever was value for money, it's this disc in my humble opinion. Everything is here: the songs, the warriors, the fans... and everything is in full glory!
Buy this video and find out what True Metal is all about!",1009584000,4,1087,4.579487179487179
7897556,3,6305910723,"Manowar!
 The name is known amung the heavy metal community as a beacon of true heavy metal. They are known as the band who just doesn't care about anything but their Music, Their Women, and their Harleys.
Upon buying this video I must say that I was excited. (After all... this is Manowar we are talking about here) I've been a fan of them since the days i first heard the words Hail and Kill come from (Lead Singer) Eric's mouth. Needless to say the video kinda left me with a sour taste in my mouth. Here I was expecting this full live concert and it came off to me as they were more worried about having sex with women than they were about the music. Most of the live footage isn't really live.. it's just video from a show synched up with their Hell on Stage cd...
There were some good points though... The end of the video showed about 4 (REALLY) live songs. and a great version of ""Carry On""
I don't know the lenth of this video but it has to break the 2 hour mark. I found that about an hour and a half into this video i found myself saying ""Ok enough with the naked women (I can't believe i'm saying this) and let's hear some blazing heavy metal""
This video is good.. and it's a must have for any Manowar fan.. but if you are not a fan of the band... and want a first impression of Manowar.... BUY A CD.
Thanks for reading

7897557,5,6305910723,"""Hell on Earth - Part I"" is not just a concert or video compilation, it is so much more than that. This is a celebration, of Manowar, of the music and of the fans, three entities that are ONE, united  in a single cause. In this video, we see Manowar joining together to spread  their creed of power and might throughout the world. On-Stage, BackStage,  on the Tour bus, in the hotel rooms and with the fans..its all here.  Obviously, there are lots of tasty numbers of the Kings of Metal belting it  out on stage but the essence of this tape is for the band to take their  fans along with them on their sacred ride. It is extremely vital for any  Manowar fan to acquire this tape as quickly as possible.",964051200,3,703,4.2406015037593985
