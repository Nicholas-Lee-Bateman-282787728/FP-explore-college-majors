2839834,5,B000QRI1GM,This was one of my favorite TV shows and I am so happy that it is coming out on DVD.  I will buy every episode.,1204588800,51,111,3.44
2839835,5,B000QRI1GM,"Yeah the show got preachy at times and Lord knows it seems lil' ole Sparta had more crime per capita than Detroit and Oakland combined but this show otherwise was a PURE slice of Americana. Whites, blacks, and even Asians and Latinos show up in this sleepy town -all struggling with different problems, prejudices and common struggles. No one was perfect in Sparta (no not even Althea). This is a timeless show and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD. There are not a lot of shows (ITHoTN and Homicide: LoTS  so far)that I would actually go and buy a box DVD set of- This does not mean this is THE best tv show out there, but as I said earlier there's something about this slice of Southern Americana that is timeless.",1204243200,59,721,4.340740740740741

2839890,5,B000QRI1GM,In my opinion in the heat of the night is one of the best police shows of the last 80 and early 90s. The cast enhanced the shows quality of a small southern town.

2839908,5,B000QRI1GM,"Last year I started purchasing some of my favorite TV Series in whole Seasons & it began with my childhood in the 60's & Leave It To Beaver.  I first started with the Best of Leave/Beaver then all the Seasons, leading me to Lassie/Jeff's Collie, Law & Order with only the Seasons Jerry Orbach (Lenny Brisco, so far Seasons 3-8) was in, all The Waltons Seasons & now In The Heat of the Night.  I've watched 4 of the episodes in this 24 hour/episode DVD & I can now see myself purchasing two Seasons a month until I have them all but I don't believe all the Seasons are on DVD yet.  Next will be All In The Family where as Carroll was superb!  And even though I've watched all these episodes dozens & dozens of time, I am still drawn to sit down & watch them again & again!  My way of collecting these masterpieces has brought back happier times in my life, like remembering my Mom & Dad as we sat & watched these shows together in the living room as a family & gives me classic entertainment, when in my opinion, to date lacks on television.  I  recommend all these classic television series!",1398384000,,1091,4.266990291262136

2839923,3,B000QRI1GM,This appears to be inherent in all these DVD releases of this series. Episodes titles are sometimes so badly messed up grammatically and with spelling errors that it is a little difficult at times to realize what the episode really is named.

If i had to pick one television series that accurately depicted the South, it would be In the Heat of the Night. All the blemishes are there, and black history that is not ever articulated on television in a meaningful way is here. This is the forerunner to Foyle's War in using history to tell a story.

In this money driven society it seems like you have to show or encourage the powers at be an idea they can make money from a enterprise such as this.  Pitty they haven't released a boxset by now!  I really don't understand that because this show, while some episodes weren't as good as others, but overall the show is solid.  I bought several of these for christmas gifts and everyone loved them!

I wrote Caroll O'Connor before he died and he wrote me back.  After Mr. O'Connor died I wrote his wife.  She wrote me back.  Mr.  O'Connor certainly loved his audience.  After years of watching this program and after seeing a commentary about Mr. O'Connor's goal of correcting what he did in All in the Family with Archie Bunker and the bigotry he portrayed in that show.  Mr. O'Connor certainly redeemed himshelf in this show.

I would recommend this show to anyone who likes old time shows.

Too bad Howard Rollins and Carol O' Connor aren't alive today to see how much this show impacted Television, hence the onslaught of shows like CSI, NCIS etc. Television just isn't what it use to be and watching these late 80's early 90's episodes really proves my point, that ""In the Heat of The Night"" was THE best Cop drama to ever hit Television....Anyone who loves the raw, in your face realness, gritty and unforgettable storylines that tackled issues of racism, crime and poverty of the south will truly enjoy this treat!!!

2840056,4,B000QRI1GM,"I was a fan of this show growing up and checked Amazon periodically over the years hoping for a DVD release. So, I was pretty excited when this set became available. While it's not the entire series or even an entire season, it's a start. Many of the episodes that have stuck in my mind over the years are featured here. If you were a fan of the show, you'll enjoy this set.
The packaging though is just weird. Despite being a co-star, Howard Rollins is not pictured on the box set. Also, the set lists one of the stars as being Christian LeBlanc. Who? According to IMDb, he was on Season 1. Season 1 is not part of this set. To list his name as a star and not list actors who were featured in the majority of the episodes is just bizarre. Also, the dvd shows the image of a large water front city which is clearly not where the show is set.",1352419200,6,841,4.1030303030303035

2840060,4,B000QRI1GM,"Updated 11/2/2012 - Finally received my set today. And honestly, still can't say figure out why these episodes. Yeah, some are pivotal episodes (critically acclaimed?), but others?

Anyhoo, what you get is a something of a box set. One big decorative box inside of which are 4 ""volumes"", each having 2 discs of  4 episodes.
Volume 1: Season 2, 8 episodes
Volume 2: Season 3, 8 episodes
Volume 3: Season 4, 4 episodes, Season 5, 4 episodes
Volume 4: Season 6, 4 episodes, Season 7, 4 episodes

This distribution of episode makes it seem even more unlikely that we'll get full season.

I grew up watching this show and have been waiting a long time for this to come out on DVD. I Had the biggest crush on Bubba (Alan Autry) and really was looking forward to buying ""his"" episodes. Some of them are here, but just a couple. Ok. Very disappointing.

But I'd love to know what went into choosing these particular episodes. Granted, it's been years and my memory of some of them is sketchy, but I don't see the connection between these particular episodes. Did they randomly choose them just to make up 24 hours (so they could sell it as such)? Even more disappointing.

Anyway, the price is low, so I'll probably buy anyway. But I would have liked something better - like complete seasons.  What's worse is if they come out with complete seasons later, then I'll just have double copies. I could continue to wait and hope, but if it never happens and this was my only shot?  Makes me feel plain ripped off and I haven't paid anything yet.",1348185600,132,1533,4.528985507246377

This is an awesome series and I am only too happy to offer my support of the series coming out on DVD, and also to chew out the parties responsible for not releasing it on DVD.  I'm thinking, 'Come on people, this is a little ridiculous not putting this series on DVD after ALL this time!'  It IS ridiculous why some movies and some series are not released on DVD.  Is it a power trip?  Do some people that make that happen just pick and choose which series and movies are released, and just enjoy making eager viewers wait forever for the ones they really want?  I have never been able to understand how that works. But, it is very frustrating.
I do really like this series.  Great characters, awesome stories, a little comedic relief here and there, some sad and poignant moments and good drama all wrapped up in small town, aw-shucks Sparta. But really if there is anything to be said about this series it's that it was a good show and it did have a formidable fan following.  Let's not give up, folks!",1344470400,3,1128,4.338095238095238

There are shows like: The Carl Burnett Show, Martin, All in the Family, Good Times and etc; that are available on DVD but, not this show. This is a wrong on so many levels, I don't know where to start. This show, set in Sparta, MS, took me, and all the fans of the show, on an adventure. I laughed, cried, even cringed at times. But, alot of the time, I cheered when the Sparta Boys prevailed. This show has shown me different sides of the main characters, their personal struggles and pain, the town evolving (somewhat) into something of an excepting town. Meaning, somewhat excepting of racial and social change. It also showed how some characters on the show (not regulars) have maintained their prejudice ways while the main characters worked through them, above them and/or around them to get the job done. I'm also proud to see that the show didn't rely on sexuality and/or partial nudity to sell the show. It's honest, real and also shows a person's capacity to have the Christian spirit. This is definitely a show that I would buy as a box set and watch every episode back to back. The show has been in syndication on the basic cable channel WGN since the show ended.

2840105,5,B000QRI1GM,"This show is obviously highly under-rated. The writing was absolutely brilliant, it never gets boring.

And there were several episodes that would really touch you, like for example the episode called, 'Rape', in which Althea Tibbs is raped by the music teacher that works at her school.

There's also another episode about a school teacher that's falsely accused of molesting a boy, and ends up committing suicide, even after his name was cleared of all charges. I can't help but cry every time I see it, the writing was absolutely on cue. Completely brilliant.

There are also quite a few funny episodes, like one where a man is arrested for having more than one wife,  and comically more women keep showing up and adding to his total.

It's just a great show in general, and I hope they get this series out soon!",1258761600,3,815,4.671328671328672

Recently I discovered the show on WGNAmerica and I'm hooked.  But I can't believe in all the time that has past and the fact that the show ran for so long and has gone into syndication, that it has never been on VHS or DVD.  I am enjoying the show so much I was planning to buy the DVDs immediately, only to discover that they're not available.  I was shocked.  I love all the characters, but Parker is my favorite and he's not on often.

2840117,5,B000QRI1GM,"This has always been a show that many others like Homicide: life on the Street, or Law & Order, Picket Fenses, et al had to follow.  The fact that it was in a small southern town gave it for of a lad back, but, not  lazy town style.  This show dealt with issues that were happening in real life in the 80's and 90's all over America.  We loved those characters, and related to them.  Having these on DVD would help complete some more spots in our families collection of VHS and DVD's.  Come on production companies, listen to the public, and release them, already, if you can bring out a horrible show like ""Lost"", or others like it, why cant you bring out a good, NO GREAT show like In the Heat of the Night?",1225497600,,709,4.176470588235294

Alot of people will remember Carroll O'Connor as Archie Bunker,but not me, he'll as always be the""Chief"". His acting in that role was so good and so overlooked. All the characters brought something to the table --Bubba, Harriet, Jamison, Parker,Sweet,LuAnn even Jimmy Dawes (their informant). It truly was old televison at it's best.
I've been looking for the DVD for a least five years. If the powers that be can bring ""Benson"" back, then they can bring ""In the Heat of the Night Back!",1214784000,3,624,4.73394495412844
