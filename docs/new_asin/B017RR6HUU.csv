8740141,3,B017RR6HUU,"Aussie entry with a tantalizing premise but poor execution

I love Maeve Dermody in ""Saragon Road.""
Here, she's disappointing as a psychiatrist retained by cops to find out if a troubled young woman (Penelope Mitchell) murdered her boyfriend and then disposed of his body.

The guy disappears one night when the couple drop some kind of hallucinogenic drug.
The girlfriend tells cops they were attacked by monsters.

So far, so good. Dermody just doesn't cut it as a super-smart shrink.
She seems far more concerned about her long lustrous hair and her sexy outfits -- why does she only wear white? -- than unraveling a mystery.

I really liked the premise here. I was disappointed by the resolution. The mystery is explained with a harebrained theory that's too goofy.
Cheap CGI rendered the monsters equally silly.",1481414400,,816,4.977941176470588
8740142,1,B017RR6HUU,"Horror film from Australia about a psychologist who is brought in when a female coed is discovered cowering in a bedroom with a knife while a room in the basement that is locked from the inside is found filled with the boyfriend's blood--but his body is nowhere to be found.  The police are convinced that the girlfriend killed him even though she had no time to get rid of the body before the police arrived and she isn't covered with her boyfriend's blood, neither of which fits the police theory.

The set-up sounds a lot better than the movie actually is.  Unfortunately, The Fear of Darkness is filled with bad dialogue and ludicrous science (at one point when a character flatlines during hypnotism the doctor tries to revive the patient with more hypnotism--which wouldn't likely work if your brainwaves were flat).  Where are the crash paddles to shock the heart?  Most of the scenes involving the police are also pretty annoying considering that they aren't considering any possible scenario other than that the girl killed her boyfriend and then somehow made the body disappear--even though the physical evidence strongly suggests that someone else could have been there and that the girl might be an innocent victim herself.

This one might have worked as a supernatural horror movie with a smarter and more focused script but The Fear of Darkness has something different in mind altogether, offering a late film M Night Shyamalan style twist that ends up making the film significantly less interesting and effective.  The Fear of Darkness wasn't all that great in the first place, but it really shoots itself in the head with that twist, completely ruining what had at least been a passably mediocre horror film.",1478563200,,1724,4.924137931034482
8740143,2,B017RR6HUU,Not bad but not great.  Watch it if you have nothing else to watch.,1463788800,,67,3.7857142857142856
8740144,3,B017RR6HUU,"If you're looking for a horror movie that plays on the old ""is it a psychodrama? or is it supernatural?"" theme this one is both enjoyable (and as many other viewers have written here) truly incomprehensible. So, if you like a movie that does not make _any_ kind of sense (visual, metaphorical,associative, allegorical, whatever, sense-it doesn't have to be strict literal sense, even) then this is one for you! On that amazing basis--it's a truly no-sense no-sense movie--it rates 3 stars.",1458691200,,489,5.049382716049383
8740145,4,B017RR6HUU,"Acting was pretty good.
Story was good.
Kept my interest.

Not a movie for those really looking for jumps or scares, or for those that need a plot line spoon fed to them.",1458172800,,170,4.151515151515151
8740146,5,B017RR6HUU,SLOW MOVIE BUT GOOD CONCEPT. ENDING IS CONFUSING.,1457654400,,49,5.25
