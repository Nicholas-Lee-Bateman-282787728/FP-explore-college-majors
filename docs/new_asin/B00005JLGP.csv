1451730,5,B00005JLGP,"We all know good 'ol Clint isn't getting any younger, and he knows that himself which is part of what makes Blood Work as good as it is.  Eastwood plays an FBI agent drawn out of retirement to find a serial killer which Eastwood had a heart attack chasing.  What develops is a game of cat & mouse between Eastwood and the killer, culminating in a stunning revelation and an ending similar to that of another Eastwood starring/directing effort; In the Line of Fire.  Blood Work is a smart, intelligent thriller and a throwbacl to the days when movies didn't have to rely on anemic storylines and bloated special effects to get going.  Sadly though, Blood Work will most likely go ignored by audiences while overblown, mindless action pics like XXX rake in the millions.  Still though, you should really give Blood Work a try, it's a real gem.",1029801600,20,841,4.617449664429531
1451731,5,B00005JLGP,"This should have been the 6th and final Dirty Harry.  It would have been a perfect way to end the series.  The movie played like a movie from the Dirty Harry series - someone died in the first 5 minutes, the ending was around water, and he used something other than his .44 magnum to kill the bad guy in the end.  All they would have had to do was change his name to Harry Callahan, and give him a slightly rougher edge.  This movie will be in my dvd collection, right next to the Dirty Harry series.
This movie is great.  It seems like Clint can't make a bad movie, even if he tried.  He is the greatest actor that ever lived.",1029369600,4,627,4.056910569105691
1451732,3,B00005JLGP,"There is a masked hold-up artist/killer on the loose, and the police believe the cold-hearted criminal to be selecting the locations purposefully, and that his victims are just unlucky, random individuals. Retired FBI agent Terry McCaleb thinks that it is the *locations* which are random, and that the killer's victims are very, very specific. Will his wisdom prevail? That is one of the interesting plot elements in ""Blood Work"", the 20th movie starring Clint Eastwood that he has also directed.
Eastwood plays McCaleb, a gritty man with a gentle streak, who was forced into retirement after suffering a heart attack while chasing a serial killer on his last case. Two years later, McCaleb receives a new heart, and the serial killer is still at-large. Terry McCaleb is Eastwood playing his age. We know that this man used to possess solid physical strength, but age has diminished that strength, so now he is left to rely almost solely on his keen intellect. That intellect does not fail him, although it is sometimes slow to catch on.
McCaleb is enjoying retirement on his boat, when he is approached by the sister of the woman whose heart he now has. She explains to him that her sister was murdered (one of the victims of the aforementioned hold-up artist/killer), and she would like for McCaleb to crack the case and find the murderer. At first reluctant, the former FBI man soon acquiesces to the sister's request, and the game is afoot.
I found ""Blood Work"" enjoyable. Watching Eastwood so easily play the role of McCaleb is fun in and of itself, and the story is always involving. It isn't necessarily as realistic as it could have been, but that is part of its charm. McCaleb falls into that realm of the Hercule Poirot detective: a former law enforcement official who should, by no real rights, have access to such things as police discussions of the case, a crime scene, evidence books, and videotapes of murders - yet he does. That is fine. It leaves the story unhampered, and it can progress at a good pace.
The revelation of the killer in ""Blood Work"" I found to be a little weak, and somewhat over the top. I would not dare disclose any more here. But suffice it to say, it jarred me a little bit. Nevertheless, I found the movie a highly entertaining weekend diversion. Blood Work is good work.",1029196800,11,2312,4.711111111111111
1451733,3,B00005JLGP,"***1/2 For action movie stars, the question of how to age gracefully on screen has become a growing concern of late, now that many of the men who made their mark and their fortunes in the genre during the `70's, `80's and early `90's have begun to slip not merely into middle age but, in some cases, even old age as well.  For understandable reasons, many of these brawny gentlemen have refused to go gently into that night of second-string bit player roles and has-been status - and their studios, which earned some mighty bucks off their popularity during that time, have been reluctant to let go of them as well.  The action genre requires, of course, a nimbleness and vitality that come only with youth.  How then to get men pushing 50, 60, even 70 years of age to compete with the up-and-coming action stars of the future, men with the energy and vigor to pull off the stunts these senior citizens can but dream about from their own long-past glory days?  One way to deal with the problem is to simply ignore the effects of aging altogether, to have the actors go through the motions anyway, even at the risk of reducing the whole enterprise to the level of rank implausibility.  Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone, in their latest action films, have settled for this strategy, the result of which is that their films haven't been either very successful at the box office or all that much fun to watch of late.  The much older Clint Eastwood has decided to take the opposite tack.  In the latter stages of his career, Eastwood has found ways to incorporate the elements of aging into the people he is portraying.  These characters need time to recover from the stressful physical requirements of the job; their reflex time is not always what it should be; they work hard at staying alongside their younger crime-fighting partners when pursuing a suspect on foot; they get winded when they run.  The sight of Eastwood panting to keep up with the President's motorcade in ""In the Line of Fire"" is one of the great emblematic images of `90's action cinema.
Well, it is nine years since that film, and Eastwood himself is now 72 years old.  In his new film ""Blood Work,"" Eastwood's Terry McCaleb is about as close to keeling over dead as any action movie protagonist we have ever come across.  Not only is he old, he suffers a heart attack while chasing a serial killer in the opening scene and, two years later, has just received a brand new ticker, courtesy of a young female donor who was murdered in a convenience store robbery.  Although McCaleb's doctor keeps telling him that this postoperative period is a crucial one requiring complete rest and relaxation, this retired FBI murder investigator decides to disobey doctor's orders when the heart donor's beautiful sister arrives on his houseboat begging him to help her find the young woman's killer.  The plot of ""Blood Work,"" based on the novel by Michael Connelly (and adapted by Brian Helgeland), is not the real selling point of the film - although it emerges as a better-than-average police procedural with some interesting plot twists, unusual locations and a nice maze-like structure to keep the audience guessing (although I must admit that I figured out who the killer was rather early on in the story).  The film also does a nice job closing in on itself, making McCaleb himself an integral part of the story's final unraveling (though it does steal a bit from ""In the Line of Fire"" in this one area).  Yet the most impressive aspect of the film is not its story but its central character and, most particularly, the performance of Eastwood himself.  Perhaps because he also directed the picture, this legendary star really seems to inhabit the character he is playing here.  With his craggy - but still remarkably handsome - face, Eastwood looks like a man who has weathered any number of life's greatest trials and emerged from them a better, more compassionate human being.  Having devoted his career to trying to get into the minds of the sickest types of criminals imaginable (serial killers), he is still able to be touched by the desperate pleas of a grieving sister, the sad plight of a young boy facing the grim prospect of an early death brought on by a weak heart, and the innate goodness and innocence of a young son who has lost the dearest thing in his life to a madman's bullet.  McCaleb knows the difference between good and evil, and he also knows that second chances don't always come around in life so he better make the most of the one he's been handed.
There are superb supporting performances by Jeff Daniels as the neighbor excited at the prospect of sharing in some of the glamour of McCaleb's investigative work, Anjelica Huston as the cardiologist maddened by her patient's refusal to take it easy in his crucial period of convalescence, Wanda De Jesus as the sister who sets the plot in motion with her request that McCaleb help her in her search for justice, Paul Rodriquez as the eternally irate detective who thinks McCaleb is overstepping his jurisdiction and Tina Lifford as a fellow investigator who has enough faith to trust the old pro even when he seems to be going beyond the bounds of totally by-the-book rules and procedures.
It's unfortunate that Eastwood does compromise a bit by having his character end up in a romantic relationship with the much younger De Jesus rather than with a woman closer to his own age.  I guess even this superstar couldn't stand THAT much of an affront to his male ego.  Oh well, give credit to the man for at least having the gumption to confront some of the realities of his own aging.  We are happy enough with what we have.  Let's not expect miracles.",1029110400,7,5704,4.687687687687688
1451734,5,B00005JLGP,"This is Eastwood at his finest. He plays an aging officer in pursuit of a serial killer like an older Dirty Harry.  His moves are more subtle but very deliberate.  What I found fascinating to the film was the subplot of the heart transplant's connection to the bigger picture.  It is a convoluted tale that seems a bit far fetched at first but slowly it begins to dawn on you just what's going on.  Don't let anyone call you stupid for not figuring out the whodunit.  I'm a great reader of suspense thrillers and I was without a clue.  The acting by all (DeJesus, Rodriguez and Jeff Daniels) was excellent.  Great cast and crew; great director.  If you like Eastwood at all you'll love this picture.",1029110400,3,699,4.492063492063492
1451735,4,B00005JLGP,"I guess Clint Eastwood is going to be one of the rare action icons that ages gracefully and with dignity.....Blood Work is another classy film from the legendary Actor/Director.
  Eastwood plays an aging F.B.I. profiler on the trail of ""The Code Killer""; He suffers a career-ending Heart attack while chasing the killer, and winds up needing a heart transplant. Two years into his retirement he is contacted by the sister of a recent murder victim looking for his help finding her killer. Why him? Well, his new heart belonged to her sister.
  The movie is very tightly constructed, and to say much more would give away the surprises. I didn't have much of a problem following the clues, and I was able to deduce the identity of the killer and his connection to Eastwood, but the movie is so good that I really didn't mind. Eastwood has constructed a rock-solid thriller very reminiscent of his earlier work, and no matter how old he is, he still kicks butt!",1029024000,6,958,4.684523809523809
1451736,4,B00005JLGP,"Let me preface my review by an admission. I like the work that Clint Eastwood does and have done ever since I first saw Rawhide so I am, to some extent, biased.
However, before seeing this movie today, my thoughts upon seeing the trailer on TV were that this was like a Dirty Harry movie. As the beginning of the movie proceeded I could see that there were obvious parallels and indeed it occurred to me that at one stage the movie was intended to lay the ghost of Dirty Harry to rest. There have been many calls for Clint to reprise the role despite his advancing years and I think that this is a clear message that there will be no more.
In many ways this is the antithetical movie to a Dirty Harry - it is slower paced, gory in a different sort of way, set in anonymous Los Angeles rather than San Francisco, making fun out of some of the situations such as having a partner in the way of the Enforcer.
The plot is quite a clever one but does not take a reasonable member of the audience long to figure out. It has a plausible love interest as well as engaging dialogue and some great character interactions. As always with his movies the production and direction are crisp and sharp. The score sounds remarkably like the Lalo Schiffrin scores of DH but they are not.
This is an enjoyable outing by Clint Eastwood and while it may not be the blockbuster audience attractor of the year it is a good solid tale with more than a modicum of good acting and storytelling which makes it good value for money as a cinema outing.
One of the best remarks I heard about this was that Clint Eastwood does not mind appearing as a character of about his own age. That is clearly true but as the old adage says you are only as young as you feel, With this movie Clint shows that he is still feeling a lot younger than his physical age which means that there are plenty more of good movies to come from him yet.
This is good solid entertainment from one of America's best known and loved Hollywood icons. Worth seeing.",1028937600,,2006,4.281578947368421

1451911,1,B00005JLGP,"This is a good film. Reason for the 1-star, is because it is also the most glaring attempt by the corrupt Hollywood ""establishment"" at taking Product Placement ads to the extreme. The movie is equally a paid advertisement for Smith & Wesson, explaining the 8-shot N-frame .357 magnum stainless steel revolver from their (Performance Center). Sales of that heretofore unknown model skyrocketed, explicitly due to this movie. I guess they learned their lesson well, when in ""Dirty Harry"" the mostly unknown .44 Magnum (Model 29) demand outstripped production capacity and pushed the price of that model into the stratosphere, in the 1970's. Beware of Corporate Greed, moviegoing public. Push back on the immorality and greed of Hollywood. Jimmy Kimmel thinks his nightly monologue is supposed to be a daily bashing session for the President of the United States, regardless of the fact that he was democratically elected by a landslide.

1451966,5,B00005JLGP,"PLOT: retired FBI profiler has a serial killer from years ago contact him again.

""Retired"" FBI profiler Terry McCaleb (CLINT EASTWOOD) is given a new heart via transplant. He spends his time taking 34 anti-rejection drugs a day and working on his boat. Wanda DeJesus contacts him to look into the  murder of her sister during a failed store robbery. Terry finds he had been given the heart via his transplant of a brain dead woman named Glory who happens to be Dejesus's sister.  Terry feels drawn to  DeJesus and feels he ""owes"" her something. He looks into the ""botched"" robbery/killing of her sister which turns out to be anything but random.  This is based on Michael Connelly's best selling book. This movie loosely follows that plot. The plot is very good and Terry is good as he figures out the ""numbers and messages"" at crimes scenes are meant for him. The serial killer feels a ""connection"" with Terry. This plot unfolds slow and methodically. You have to pay attention on the details of ""why"" and ""who"" via the demented logic of the killer.  I give this one 5 STARS for a good plot, and acting. Scene stealer here is DeJesus who is a very good women who loves her sister and the son she left behind. Jeff Daniels is great ast the Boat Bum neighbor of Terry who spends his days drinking beer and driving Terry around crime scenes.",1494547200,3,1340,4.5625

is upgrade the picture quality with a new HD transfer in 2:40:1 ratio, which does look much sharper & clearer picture
better than the old dvd version
amazon's product details say 1:77:1 ratio this is Dead wrong, ratio is 2:40:1
the sound quality has been boosted to new 5.1 master audio mix, which does sound alot better than the old Dolby digital mix
there are no new extras, what a surprise
the 3 featurettes & the theatrical trailer from the old dvd version have been carried over
4 stars for this new blu-ray reissue based on new upgraded picture quality & new 5.1 mix

1452291,1,B00005JLGP,"Because Amazon's Bosch series is so fantastic, I recently started reading Micheal Connelly's whole Harry Bosch book series from the beginning. I was enjoying the book series immensely, until Connelly decided to braid retired FBI profiler Terry McCaleb into Bosch's world, in A Darkness More Than Night. Since I didn't read the introductory novel Blood Work, I didn't have the background I needed on McCaleb's character. So I did the classic high school lazy student maneuver. I watched Blood Work, the movie, instead of reading the book. BIG MISTAKE. This movie is so corny, unrealistic, logically fallacious and poorly acted, I lost respect for everyone involved: Connelly for allowing this to happen, Anjelica Huston for agreeing to be in it, but most of all, Eastwood for orchestrating this cinematic diarrhea. The one shining exception is Tina Lifford's respectable portrayal of Detective Jaye Winston. Every other character is simply embarrassing. I, for one, have learned my lesson. And I think Michael Connelly has too.",1460851200,4,1026,5.300613496932515

1452400,4,B00005JLGP,"I liked this movie, and I really like a lot of Clint Eastwood movies, but I read the book first and I can't relate Terry McCaleb to Clint Eastwood very well.  There is one book where Terry McCaleb meets Harry Bosch in ""A Darkness More Than Night"" - which is very intriguing.  Amazon Prime has the series ""Bosch,"" which is very well done and extremely well cast.  I just can't see the character portraying Harry Bosch in ""Bosch"" coming up against Clint Eastwood as Terry McCaleb - if the two stories every mesh or if Bosch ever covers that book in the series, it should be interesting - maybe in a good way, maybe not.  I liked the movie, it was good, but I'd like to have seen Terry McCaleb cast as a younger man.

I have always thought he was a decent actor, and in short I think it is sad he was over looked for an Oscar nomination for this role. I examined his every movement, facial expressions, and every other aspect of his performance in this movie and I am convinced this may very well be the best performance he has ever given as an actor through out his entire career. Though he was nominated for a best actor Oscar in only one film(Unforgiven) in which he deserved the nomination, I stand convinced that this was indeed his best performance. I was blown away. He nailed the character and the entire performance was brilliant. It seems because he has aged and his voice has become a little gravel-like, it does seem it may distract some viewers of this film from realizing just how good Clint was in this movie. Clint's roles are usually not very demanding. He normally plays characters that don't have extremely dramatic moments or dialogue, and the same it true here as well. But despite it his performance was truly great in this film. Beyond this Clint also produced and directed most of this movie pitch perfect. It really is a pretty good movie, and far better than I expected it to be.

This film is defiantly not Eastwood's best work, it's very predictable and very dry in a lot of spots. If you've seen a lot of detective movies you'll know all the ""twists"" and ""clues"" way before you're supposed to. The attraction between Eastwood and the main girl is just absolutely ridiculous and almost ruins the whole movie. The acting is very amateur and every character is one sided with absolutely no depth. Why do people keep putting Jeff Daniels in movies? The soundtrack literally made my skin crawl, the opening bit of trumpeting cheese made me groan out loud.

The redeeming quality of this film is that it has a neat concept of a killer's victim's heart being put in the detective that's hunting the killer. It's always fun to see a grouchy old man take on the world and it's an original plot with a few scenes that are pretty well done but at the end of the day it's mostly forgettable. It's certainly not the worst movie ever but there's a lot better Eastwood flicks out there.",1361491200,,1161,4.471698113207547

As a whole, however, I am disappointed with Hollywood and the entertainment industry from a religious and moral standpoint.  They are responsible for lowering many important standards and it at least appears that they are not accountable for what they portray on screen.  The rating system is not, by far, the answer!  That only shows our children that when they get older they can be as selfish, immoral, and irresponsible as the adults.  Of course, I am not telling any clear-thinking, decent person anything that they didn't already know.  Now, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Eastwood is one of the better entertainers and I do believe that he adheres to a reasonable standard.  It is just too bad that the general public seems to forget that make believe entertainment is not a guide for real life.  We simply have too much sex, violence, greed, selfishness, divorce, murder, corruption in and out of government, glorification of crime, and unethically achieved monetary gain.

1453417,3,B00005JLGP,"Even great directors can have their lesser work, and ""Blood Work"" is one of Eastwood's.  This one had the misfortune of being released not too long before Eastwood's late career renaissance - that string of extraordinarily strong, thematically and artistically ambitious films that included ""Mystic River,"" ""Million Dollar Baby,"" ""Flags of Our Fathers,"" and ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" - and this film's lesser status became even more obvious in its wake.

""Blood Work"" is a modestly scaled genre picture - modest both in scope and in structure.  And even by the modest standards of the crime thriller, I have to admit that the plot of ""Blood Work"" is pretty standard, predictable stuff.  (Dollars to donuts that you'll have the culprit figured by the half-hour mark, if not before.)

Because of that, it would be easy to beat up on this picture, and to call its scripting a little lazy. (Others already have.) Were Eastwood a flashier director, he might have been able to use that flash to distract from the thin, somewhat contrived plot.  But Eastwood is - and always has been - a classical director, seemingly averse to razzle dazzle editing or camerawork, and so the mechanics of the plot become clear from the early going.

(And I use neither of those aforementioned terms - ""flash"" and ""classical"" - as a criticism.  In the right hands, both ""flashy"" and ""classical"" direction can have serious pleasures.)

Despite its predictability, however, ""Blood Work"" has its upsides.  There's a surprisingly easy going vibe to this picture, and to the performances. Yes, Eastwood is again playing a variation on the persona he's played for much of his career, but hey - he does it well, no?  And he has genuine chemistry with Wanda de Jesus.  These performers make their parts seem like real people whose plot dictated challenges don't strictly seem like plot elements.  There's a lived in quality to these characters, and to the performances, that could only have been conveyed by a veteran director and a seasoned cast of old pros. (Anjelica Huston, Jeff Daniels, and veteran character actor Dylan Walsh all make appearances.)  Indeed, this is one of Eastwood's strengths as a director - he often remembers to utilize old pros as an integral part of his pictures.

So yes, ""Blood Work"" ain't Eastwood's best work.  It's a (very) modest genre picture.  But it is at the very least honest about its genre origins, and it remains quite watchable despite its predictability.  And hey, that's more than most pictures can lay claim too.

* Curiously enough, even with its deficiencies I enjoy this one more than some of Eastwood's most recent work (""Changeling,"" ""Invictus,"" ""Hereafter,"" ""J. Edgar"").  These last four films may be ambitious, but they're not especially succesful or engaging. ""Blood Work,"" warts and all, at least kept my interest.",1344384000,,2835,4.978768577494692

This movie is about pure detective work and it is a well thought-out deliberate plot that is a nod to traditional mysteries.  Clint Eastwood's character digs through the details to find the serial killer, finding details that other detectives missed and profiling the serial killer.

While watching the movie, it could go several different directions and it was not a plot that whose ending or path could be easily determined.  My family was impressed with it.

This movie kept you thinking about the details and put you in the mind of the detective (Eastwood's character) and made you seriously wonder the outcome; very well done.",1329436800,,830,4.851063829787234
1453420,3,B00005JLGP,"Clint Eastwood, one of Hollywood's most famous `tough' guys, has lately been turning in pictures ruminating his mortality, and this one is no different.  Watching his old films, such as The Outlaw Josey Wells and the Dirty Harry flicks, it's rather startling to see Eastwood looking so --, well, so old.

Blood Work, directed by Eastwood, features him in the role of a retired FBI cop (Terry McCaleb) who was a main media cornerstone.  Chasing the ""Code Killer,"" a person who leaves codes for McCaleb to break, he chases him down a long alley and they collaspes from a heart issue.

Two years later, he's living on a marina, trying waiting for a heart transplant.  He gets one, and then is approached with another case.  Graceille (Wanda De Jesus), the lady who contacts him, has a very convincing argument: he has her murdered sister's heart.  He takes the case, despite the very verbal protest from his doctor who threatens to quit seeing him if he doesn't slow down.

The rest of the movie moves through Eastwood chasing the killer.  What makes Blood Work such an effective piece of film-making is it shows the `tough man' stereotype as a shell.  Seeing Eastwood stoved up and constantly aware of his mortality is rather shocking, and it drives home not only Terry McCaleb's mortality but Eastwood's as well.  At the film's climax, there's shots of Eastwood with a gun that look like they're straight out of Dirt Harry.  This time around, instead of looking menacing and invincible, Eastwood looks withered, like he's been on the road too long though he can still pack a punch.  That exploration of mortality is what makes this film successful.

Another element, largely unexplored in police thrillers, is the duality of man.  Without giving to much away, the movie examines the idea of the Ying-Yang, and how both good and evil need one another, forming a symbiotic relationship.  One belief is good and evil function because of the conflict they provide, and they need each other.  The film rejects this (thankfully), and this rejection ties into McCaleb's retirement and failing health, uniting the two major themes into a very nice, cohesive ending sequence.  This theme of duality definetly sets apart Bloodwork and how deftly Eastwood ties that into the mortality issues shows how accomplished these film makers have become in their craft.

The only main issue I had with Bloodwork was the love story angle.  While very underplayed, McCaleb and Graceilla eventually get together, but it feels so artificial and forced.  It doesn't ring true at all: not that they could not get together, but Eastwood didn't develop the onscreen story enough in that department to make it believable.

Other than the film's weakness in the love story, Bloodwork triumphs.  It shows you the Eastwood we've all known and shows that even `tough guys' have to slow down.

Eastwood's wife makes a cameo(one of the journalists).  The romance feels a bit forced but it's never indicated that they're soulmates and it is what it is so it's fine enough.

And the shootout in the street was so stupid and would have never happened. I almost turned it off there.

1453426,4,B00005JLGP,"This Aug/2002 release of Clint Eastwood's thriller Bloodwork,has now been re-released on DVD by Warner's. If you haven't noticed,they have been steadily re-releasing most of his works onto DVD,either singly and/or sets,in a remastered form and boy do they look good. This movie is no exception and as always this enhances the viewing experience tremendously.
The story line in this well cast movie is about one Lt. McCaleb,retired FBI profiler. One night he is on scene investigating a homicide when he spots the suspect. He chases him but has a heart attack while trying to climb a chain link fence. The hooded suspect stops and starts back towards him which enables McCaleb to get a few shots off at him,and he wounds the fleeing suspect. McCaleb goes out and we find that he is not only still alive but has received a heart transplant from a young lady who was fatally shot in a robbery around this same time. He also is now retired and living on a boat,and his neighbour is a jolly sort of guy by the name of Jasper Noone(Jeff Daniels),who lives off his dad's stipends.
One day NcCaleb is visited by a woman by the name of Graciella Rivers(Wanda De Jesus).It seems McCaleb was the recipient of his dead sisters heart and she reasons he owes it to her sister to find her killer. Reluctantly he agrees but as his inquiries and investigation widen his heart is starting to act for the worse under the strain. His doctor Dr Fox(Angelica Huston)continually warns him against such folly but McCaleb determinedly soldiers on. The trail has many branches and some of them lead to seemingly dead ends but there is a grisly connection to all of them. Witnesses even get killed and when he goes to the location of one of the murders at an ATM machine,the murderer himself unknowingly(to McCaleb)stands right behind him. As McCaleb's heart saps his energy he enlists the help of Jaspar,whom he calls ""Buddy"",to drive him around to various locales. A Russian suspect who he interrogates at his work place roughs up the weakened McCaleb and escapes,only to turn up dead later. He visits the wife of the ATM victim and discovers the killer has been taking souvenirs. Not only that but close studying of security tapes of the crime scenes reveals the killer is sending McCaleb verbal messages.
Graciella and her sisters son visit McCaleb one evening on his boat. The son asks McCaleb what the numbers mean that were found at the original crime scene. He says he could never figure them out and the boy replies that there is no number one. McCaleb and the Graciella visit the hospital next day and talk to his doctor. Someone he believes has hacked into the blood donor files and  that the motive for the killings was their blood types not money. Sure enough this turns out to be the case as the main victims names/blood types are all on the list. The revelation finally hits McCaleb and he pays a visit to his boat pal Buddy. It was his last name that finally gave him the answer....no(one),as in no""one"" in the numbers left at the original crime scene. Buddy is the killer and admits it at gun point. He has kidnapped Graciella and her sisters son and when he attempts to leave McCaleb wounds him in the arm. He forces Noone to take him to their location;on a boat due for demolition run aground in the harbour. Noone temporarily escapes and when McCaleb finds and frees Graciella and her sisters son,he tells them to pull his boat back from the one they're on until they get his signal. However the killer has already hidden aboard the boat and when he reveals himself she deliberately rams the boat into the derelict boat and Noone goes flying off onto its deck. Lying there he taunts McCaleb telling him he needs him and other lies. One shot and he lands on shallow water on the boat. Defiantly he raises his head out of the water but Graciella is there to push it back down.
A taut thriller with a totally surprising twist to its ending,this is a thoroughly enjoyable entry in the Eastwood canon and proves,as if he needed to prove anything,what a great talent he is. I can say with some satisfaction that while I was never a fan of his spaghetti westerns,I latched onto his works in the late 60s and early 70s. I could see the talent on the rise then and knew great things would happen with Eastwood. And while no one ever has a perfect record,Eastwood has come as close as any to accomplishing that in a stellar acting and directing career;while making tons of coin at the box office for Warner Brothers along the way. His is truly a Hollywood success story where Eastwood has admirably done it...""his way"",and I'm am grateful to have been along for the ride all these years and am still amazed at his on going output. A true talent and original. Thank you Mr. Eastwood.
This newly remastered edition gives us a clear and crisp picture in its' original a/r. Extras include a featurette on the production end of things,a conversation with Eastwood,De Jesus and Paul Rodriguez and the trailer.

1453498,4,B00005JLGP,"Clint Eastwood embraced growing older and more fragile in this leisurely paced and thoughtful cop film. Eastwood himself has grown older and wiser, both as an actor, a producer, and a director. Even though I guessed fairly early on who the killer was and the film ran a little long, this film is about the journey. Paced much like Line of Fire, it also is about the character as much as the crimes, and that, coupled with the charisma of Eastwood, makes this a good film.

Clint Eastwood is legendary FBI profiler Terry McCaleb. He is tracking a serial killer known as ""Code Killer"" when this film opens. Leaving Terry messages written in blood at each crime scene, the prey is enjoying the chase. When McCaleb finally has him within reach during a foot pursuit, Terry suffers a heart attack so massive that only a heart transplant saves his life, forcing his retirement from the Bureau. Then the killings stop.

Taking the advice of his cardiologist, Bonnie (Angelica Huston), he takes life easy on his boat. Jeff Daniels is excellent as his next door pal, Buddy. Things are going smoothly in the immediate days after the transplant darkly beautiful Graciella shows up wanting the former FBI Agent to go look into the murder of her sister. Since it appears to be a random act of violence during a robbery, and Terry has severe doubts as to whether he is even up to such a task, he tries to decline. But empathy for Graciella and the son who no longer has a mother, coupled with his his attraction to her, make turning her down problematic. When he discovers the heart beating in his chest belonged to the murdered woman, honor and guilt set him on the trail once again. Buddy becomes his sidekick as he slowly gets up to speed. Terry knows he is not the same man anymore, but might be able to get part of himself back if he can survive the chase. Paul Rodriguez gives a very funny performance as exasperated L.A. Detective Arrango who thinks Terry should stay retired and out of his case.

But Terry still has connections, including the pretty Tina Lifford in a nice role. It is obvious she and Terry had more than a casual relationship in the past and she gives him more leeway than she probably should in his pursuit of justice for his donor's killer. Terry begins to have feelings for Graciella and though some critics at the time found Clint's performance in the brief love scene rather stoic, his reaction, or rather lack of one, at Graciella's advances in the scene are in keeping with his condition and the fear the now fragile McCaleb has due to his recent transplant and the health complications brought on by his investigation. As his old nemisis returns and Terry discovers the reason for all the killings it complicates matters no end, both investigation wise, and in his personal life, which have become intertwined.

Eastwood gives a thoughtful performance as an actor and adds some humor and good music as director to round out this entertaining film. His final exchange with Rodriguez after a somewhat lengthy chase and confrontation with the killer, end the film on a high note. Like Steve McQueen, Eastwood can elevate a good movie to seem a little better than it is, which is exactly what he does here. Not a fantastic film, but a very good one.",1281744000,3,3265,4.633851468048359

1453500,4,B00005JLGP,"""Blood Work"" was made in 2002, so Clint Eastwood looks and plays an elderly, recuperating heart transplant patient, Terry McCaleb.  Terry is also happens to be a retired FBI agent that has been given a new lease on life, but with a heart of a murder victim.  Since Terry has a very unique blood type, the murder victim's sister, Graciella Rivers, tracks him down and asks him to investigate who murdered her sister. She knows he has the training and a stickler for details, to have the reputation of being the best detective at the FBI's Southern California Office.  Terry knows he will be going against his doctor's orders, but is hooked on a mission he cannot say no to.  Terry calls up all his old favors with the FBI and Police Departments, to help solve this strange crime.

Terry's cardiology surgeon, Dr. Bonnie Fox (Angelica Houston) is upset he took on this mission as he is still recovering from major surgery, but ends up helping him.

The story is interesting on how it builds suspense on small clues that come together at a steady pace.  Harry shows great determination not to let the killer get away on a cold case crime the Police have given up on.  The police have mixed feelings about Terry investigating the case but grudgingly help.  Terry also enlists the help of his houseboat neighbor, Buddy Noone (Jeff Daniels) to drive him around and help out with the mundane chores of the investigation.  Buddy plays a beer-chugging loser that has no obvious purpose in life.

Although not completely well, he's tough, gruff and smart as a whip. When his heart donor's grieving sister (Wanda De Jesus) asks him to find her dead sibling's killer, he feels obligated to do it even if it puts his health at risk.

This is a gritty, no-nonsense role and Eastwood is superb as Terry McCaleb. Jeff Daniels, who plays Eastwood's neighbor and younger sidekick, is well cast, also. Brian Helgeland, ""L.A. Confidential"" Oscar-winner, wrote a sharp, sensible script that is pure Eastwood all the way. ""Blood Work"" is adapted from a novel by Michael Connelly.

Some people may chuckle at a brief love scene between Eastwood and De Jesus, but I think he will always be a sensual man, so had no problems with that. It was a realistic portrayal... But I did giggle when his real-life wife, Dina Ruiz, popped up in a scene with microphone in hand, trying to get a quote from Eastwood's character, Terry McCaleb. That was a cameo role at its best. :-)

Eastwood is my favorite all-time actor, no matter what his age. The man has stamina and great box-office appeal at 72 or 22!

1453567,3,B00005JLGP,"""Blood Work"" judged solely as a film is exciting, well-paced, and a thriller you may enjoy watching, but if you've read Michael Connelly's book with it cerebral plotting and intricate maneuvers, then you're going to be very disappointed. Produced, directed, and starring Clint Eastwood, it also features Jeff Daniels and Anjelica Huston.
 It starts with Connelly's FBI profiler Terry McCaleb at a crime scene where he sees a message meant for him taunting him. In the crowd he spots the killer and runs after him. The exertion causes McCaleb to have a heart attack, but he has a chance to fire off some rounds at the murderer.
 Two years later, Terry, the recipient of a heart transplant, is visited by his murdered donor's sister, Graciela, who wants him to find her sister's killer which he feels obligated to do. To him, ""Murder is evil, a hateful thing.""
 Not having a ""ticket,"" a private investigator's license he has to use his wiles and his connections in police departments to investigate the case. The sister was killed in a convenience store robbery that was caught on tape. The murder leads to another related killing at an ATM machine also caught on tape. Suspects turn up, but they, too, end up murdered. Also, inexplicably McCaleb is being followed.
 The viewer's credulity gets sorely tested by some of the incidents as McCaleb follows up leads. Instead of following Connelly's plot, the screenwriter dreams up a melodramatic and incredible ending that even moviegoers, not knowing the book's plot, are going to find difficult to swallow.
 The murderer would have to be a wonder worker to get around the way he does and get away with all the shenanigans that go on in the last third of the movie.
 Mr. Eastwood, if you're going to choose the work of one of America's top crime writers, try to stick to his superior plotting and brainier twists and turns.

1453570,4,B00005JLGP,"This is a real good thriller because it is entirely logical. A serial killer follows a certain logic, a logic that becomes certain little by little for us, as it does for the police provided the police does not decide that the first approach is the only one possible. The film shows very well that the logic of the killer has to be reconstructed through a trial and failure procedure. In this case it is determined by the game of cat and mouse the killer is playing with the cop he has more or less chosen as his ""partner"", if we can call that pair work partnership. But in fact it is and the cop as much as the killer need each other to exist. That is what's vicious about this film. The cop needs the killer without whom he does not exist at all. And that's why it is so difficult for him to kill the killer at the end because they have become intimate. But yet the thriller is not as intense as it could have been because Eastwood avoid the gross part of serial killing and the crime scenes are never that dirty, that disgusting, that heavily shown, and since we are in a film we know the solution will come and we are only trying to follow the track that leads to the killer, along with the cop. In this case the signature was given from the very start though the police thought it was a code. It was not. It was a riddle revealing the name of the killer, and it took an eight year old boy to see it and the cop took quite a few or a couple of days before realizing what was so obvious right under his eyes. And then he discovers that the killer had also foreseen this epiphanic moment and was ready, very well prepared for the final fight, though he had maybe over-estimated the gratefulness of the cop for having provided him with a life in a way; or in fact in two ways, but you will have to discover how. And that is maybe this slower dimension of the film that makes it more human and less gory like so many about serial killers. More a reflection about life, and death, and a sad picture of the hatred and rivalry that poison the police bodies and agencies and work in Los Angeles, even if we know that it is not the exclusive characteristic of Los Angeles, far from it.

1453663,4,B00005JLGP,"As a fan of the ""Terry McCaleb"" series by Michael Connelly, I didn't have a problem with Clint Eastwood portraying the F.B.I. profiler.  Though there might be an age difference, I thought Eastwood captured the character of the no-nonsense, tough-as-nails McCaleb perfectly.  In the film version of the novel, Blood Work, McCaleb has a heart attack while chasing a vicious murderer known as the Code Killer through the back allies of Los Angeles.  The movie then picks up two years later and sixty days after McCaleb has finally had a heart transplant.  Still recovering from the operation, McCaleb is approached by Graciella Rivera (the sister of the donor, Gloria, whose heart was given to him) to find the man who killed her beloved sister.  Perhaps out of guilt at being the receiver of the heart and against his better judgment, McCaleb agrees to look into the case.  He really doesn't expect to find out much, knowing that the police have probably taken the case as far as it can go.  All of that, however, changes as he starts to put the pieces of the puzzle together.  What had seemed at first to be a routine homicide ends up being something far darker and more violent than even our retired profiler could suspect.  He soon discovers a connection between Gloria's death and the murder of a man that happened just two weeks before hers.  This leads him to eventually believe that the Code Killer is back and that Gloria was killed so that he might have her heart and once again enact the battle between good and evil as the serial killer refers to it.  You see, the Code Killer hasn't finished with McCaleb and wants him back in the game.  The only thing the Code Killer hasn't figured into the equation is that though McCaleb's fragile, he's not as nice as he used to be and intends to put this asshole down the hard way with everything he's got.  The ending isn't going to be pretty.

As the director and star of Blood Work, Clint Eastwood proves that he's still at the top of his game.  He keeps everything simple by casting good actors (Jeff Daniels, Angelica Huston, Wanda De Jesus, and Paul Rodriguez) who know exactly what to bring to a performance, getting each shot with just one or two takes, and playing Terry McCaleb as a real character who's in his senior years with a serious health condition.  The pace of the movie may be slow, but that's to be expected.  Neither Eastwood, nor McCaleb, are exactly young men in their prime.  Eastwood plays the role the way it should be done, taking it nice and easy, until the final confrontation occurs and he can do a ""Dirty Harry"" on the bad guy.  I love it at the end when the Code Killer thinks that he's won the game and walks confidently away from McCaleb, only to be shot by our slightly tarnished hero.  That's definitely something Dirty Harry would do.  Though there are a couple of things that aren't explained in the movie such as how the killer is able to tap into the organ donor's website to get the necessary information or how the killer is able to be parked down the street from the convenience store for the shotgun shootout when he's actually supposed to be doing something else, which I can't give away without telling you who he is.  The shootout was great, but the timing wasn't right and left a big plot hole for me to wonder about.  It makes me think that a scene was cut out of the movie.  Still, Blood Work is an excellent, suspenseful film with Eastwood doing what he does best.  It's one I can watch again and again without getting bored, and that says a lot for a movie.",1167696000,4,3559,4.506230529595015

At one point in the movie, McCaleb and cop Winston recklessly blast out all of the windows of a speeding car for no apparent reason and then act as if nothing happened.  Huh?  Somewhere along the line, the movie diverges drastically from the book to the point where the real murderer turns out to be a completely different character.  Too bad so much of the original book was lost in translation.",1166659200,,680,4.625

1453666,4,B00005JLGP,"I would expect a wide range of responses to ""Blood Work,"" with the key factor being at what point in the proceedings you went from being behind in figuring out what was going on to getting way ahead of the game. Once again Clint Eastwood is working in front and behind the camera, playing Terry McCaleb, who is an F.B.I. Profiler working on the case of the Code Killer. Literally on the heels of the serial killer, McCaleb suffers a massive heart attack, but still manages to put a bullet in the fleeing suspect. We then jump ahead two years to a point where McCaleb is retired and ending his second month with a new heart. Then Graciella Rivers (Wanda De Jesus) shows up at boat and says she wants him to investigate the murder of her sister. McCaleb declines, since he is retired from the force and recovering from a heart transplant, but Graciella trumps his objections by telling him that it is her sister's heart that is now beating in his chest. McCaleb feels obligated to investigate, even though it means stepping on the toes of the local cops (Paul Rodriguez and Dyaln Walsh as the unfriendly cops and Jaye Winston as the helpful one).

McCaleb is not well; we know this because everybody constantly tells him as much and his doctor (Anjelica Huston) has a fit every time he even spends time thinking hard. But McCaleb has a debt to repay, and as he investigates the murder he, of course, uncovers things that none of the other cops are picking up on. I know exactly what I want to say about this type of thriller, but even announcing in general terms what is happening here would give the game away. I caught on about five minutes before McCaleb did and while I liked the revelation of what exactly had been done and why, I have to admit the film is all downhill by that point. From there on ""Blood Work"" is less about McCaleb using his brains and more being able to do what needs to be done to bring down the villain before he needs another heart transplant.

Clint Eastwood is in his seventies now and is deservedly up for an Oscar nomination for his work as director on ""Mystic River."" I have much less of a sense of Eastwood the director on this 2002 film, but mainly because Eastwood the actor is more noticeable. When you look back on the films in which Eastwood has acted in the past few years (""Space Cowboys,"" ""True Crime,"" ""Absolute Power"") it becomes clear that that he is cognizant of his age and consciously making films suitable to a man his age. That is not meant as a slight, because most actors his age are not still running around at all, let alone as leading men in theatrical films.

The only persons that come to mind from my lifetime would be Spencer Tracy, who was 67 when he died after making ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,"" and John Wayne, whose last film, ""The Shootist,"" was really the only one that showed him as a figure in decline before his death at the age of 72. You would think the better comparison would be to Wayne, given Eastwood's history with the western, but it was Tracy who had four Oscar nominated performances in his last decade, playing older men (add ""The Old Man and the Sea,"" ""Inherit the Wind"" and ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" to the aforementioned film). Eastwood has only received one acting nomination, for ""Unforgiven,"" yet he is carving out a body of work as an older leading man. Paul Newman has been doing mostly supporting roles since he finally won his long-overdue Oscar. Only Clint Eastwood has really been making a lot of movies, a list to which ""Blood Work"" gets added, about an old guy trying to hang on to his Alpha-male role.",1145145600,3,3596,4.478658536585366

This was a great Clint Eastwood film (he directed and starred in it). His acting was superb in it, and the story pulled itself together well.

1453755,1,B00005JLGP,"The book, Blood Work (Michael Connelly) was excellent, one of my favorite of Connelly's many ""cop thrillers"".  The movie Blood Work so grossly butchered Connelly's book that even the entire ending, including the killer, differs from the book.  How and/or why Connelly would allow his name/book to be connected to this drivel is beyond me.

Clint Eastwood as Terry McCaleb is the most unbelievable character in the movie.  When reading Blood Work, at no point in time would I have imagined someone like Eastwood as McCaleb.  McCaleb is supposed to be in his 40s...Eastwood is most assuredly NOT capable of playing the role of a man in his 40s.  The problems with the movie hardly end there, however.

The casting of Graciela was horrid.  The chemistry between these two is so incredibly forced in the movie.  It took me thinking back to the book to envision that these two really could have had a relationship because onscreen...it was just so far-fetched.  The delivery of lines/dialogue was like pulling teeth.  Graciela was horribly done and I can't think of a single redeeming thing about the casting of this character.

The casting for the supporting roles was better, but still did not do anything to save this awful flick.  The casting for Buddy (Jeff Daniels) and Bolotov were good - they have a glimmer of hope to this waste of film/time/brain cells.  Arrango (Paul Rodriguez) was made to seem much more comical than he was in the book and even without having first read the book, Rodriguez did an awful job (or rather, his dialogie was so poorly written that he had no way of doing a decent job with it).

The plot was just ridiculous...the sequence of events and time line was so incredibly unbelievable and the story took so many turns that were just out of nowhere.  The movie opens with a totally out of place scene with the so-called ""CODE KILLER"" (though I don't think they mention a THING about this in the movie, those who read the book will know that's who he's supposed to be).  McCaleb has a heart attack (I think...whatever it was, it's not what happened to him in the book) while chasing down the Code Killer.  Then the plot skips all over the place from McCaleb getting a new heart, to being visited by Graciela, to the completely random Russian/Bolotov angle (which actually made sense in the book...Bolotov was absolutely pointless in the movie the way it was written)...my head was spinning after trying to decipher the storyline and time line.

THe kicker was that the killer (won't spoil it for anyone who actually would still think watching this piece of garbage is a good idea) is not the killer from the book and that, had I not known the 'true' killer from reading the book, I would have immediately suspected this movie version killer.  The ""clues"" weren't clues so much as shoving the supposed ""surprise"" in your face and then wondering why no one was surprised at the ending.  And the boy figuring it out was just stupid.  The way it was written in the book was wonderful...this was a lame attempt at working the boy into the movie in some way (whereas in the book, there was a definite purpose of the boy's inclusion in the story).

All in all, this was a lousy adaptation...one that deviated so far from the book that the only similarities are character names and the occasional tidbit of plot crossover in the very beginning.  The suspense was non-existent and the acting was largely terrible.  Jeff Daniels and the man who played Bolotov (even though Bolotov was pointless in the movie) gave good, believable performances.  The rest ranged from not-so-good (Angelica Huston as the doctor, Tina Lifford as Winston) to bad (Paul Rodriguez as Arrango) to horrid (Clint Eastwood & Wanda de Jesus).

I was really hoping to enjoy this movie because Connelly's books are some of my favorites.  But this just made me angry.  Don't waste your time and energy on this movie.  Please read the book instead!  If you've watched the movie but never read the book, I urge you to read the book as it is fantastic!",1098144000,16,4036,4.698435277382646

The plot's intriguing enough; I won't waste space on it here since  it's in the Editorial Review.  The twists and turns lead character Terry McCaleb takes to find the killer make the pace of the film enjoyable, and the climax forced a double-take from me.

The acting, for the most part, I found a bit stiff, and the flow of the scenes throughout said little more than ""book adaptation"".  I couldn't help but think as the film progressed of how much better Michael Connelly's story likely is in print.  A couple of scenes had me literally rolling my eyes, especially the love scene. It probably fits somehow in the book, but in the film it just seemed placed there in an attempt to hold my interest.  Another was the ending itself; although I didn't see it coming, it was very undramatic and drew just an ""Oh."" from me rather than a ""Wow!""

The cameos were appealing; comedian Paul Rodriguez plays a surprisingly grating homicide detective and rival to McCaleb, and Anjelica Huston does well as McCaleb's cardiologist.

1453759,4,B00005JLGP,"I happened to have had a fascination with the whole way that forensic investigators have used unusual evidence to track down and find who the real criminals behind crimes really are. 2002's Clint Eastwood directed ""Blood Work"" for the most part does succeed in being a really good and sometimes challenging movie for crime-drama thriller moviegoers.
 Terry McCaleb is a former FBI agent Miami who recently retired after a minor heart attack forced him to retire from the job of police investigator until after a string of killings, he comes out of retirement and goes back on the job when the sister of a murder victim is desperate to have her sister's killer brought to justice. Terry McCaleb has had a hard life because of the frustration of letting the killer slip through his hands due to the heart ailment that he suffered just as he was about to catch him. Even more daunting is that the victims' blood matches McCaleb's and he in fact got a heart transplant from one of the murder victims but defies the health effects of his heart transplant to bring down the killer before he strikes again.
 This movie is a really good thriller for the most part but the movie does have it's share of flaws like even a lot of positive reviews have emphasized. One of the is that the acting by the entire cast, while decent, does from time to time, drift off in all directions. However my favorite one was actor Paul Rodriguez. While he doesn't have a whole lot of acting time on this film, he is so funny as the hot-tempered chief who has had a long standing semi-rivalry with McCaleb. Seeing his character go ballistic all the time is so funny and to be honest, besides Clint Eastwood, Paul Rodriguez really is the shining star for me.
 ""Blood Work"" is also marred somewhat by a slow moving storyline and it drags on in places and as a result it's sometimes hard to watch the movie without sitting still or getting bored but it does pick back up before you would fall asleep. One lovemaking scene between Gracielle Rivers(Wanda De Jesus) and McCaleb was somewhat iffy in my opinion due to their age differences and it felt cold to me.
However, The idea of the killer targeting individuals with the same blood type is in my opinion quite original and keeps this movie from being totally predictable. This is not an essential movie by any stretch of the imagination but for those who like shows like ""CSI"" as well as ""CSI: Miami"", then this film is worth a look or two. The DVD has offers no worthy extras in my opinion.",1086825600,2,2512,4.540838852097131

Only Clint Eastwood has really been making a lot of movies, a list to which ""Blood Work"" gets added, about an old guy trying to hang on to his Alpha-male role.

Final Note After the Fact: I went to hear Jeff Daniels in concert this week (August 2006).  Apparently he spends his spare time driving around in a camper and performing at small venues where he plays his guitar and sings songs.  One of his songs is ""The Dirty Harry Blues,"" which is about his experiences making this film and working with Clint Eastwood, which is why I am watched it again tonight.

He's over 70 years old now and, instead of making believe that this is not happening, he finds roles that try to show its reality.  I applaud him for this.  Blood Work is a good film.
Eastwood is cast as an FBI profiler nearing retirement who's being taunted by someone known as the ""code killer"".  After a chase, he suffers a heart attack and the killer gets away.  Fast forward two years.  He's now the recipient of a heart transplant, and his cardiologist, played by Anjelica Houston, is telling him to take it easy.  Ha!  You and I know right there that he's going to be swept into some sort of new police work.  Well -- it sure is wild.  It seems the young woman whose heart he has received in the transplant was murdered.  And her sister, played by Wanda De Jesus, is begging him find the killer.  Naturally, he now has to use all his years of wisdom to investigate.
What follows is a fast paced police procedural drama to which he is personally connected.  There are lots of clues and a few false leads and some startling twists and turns of the plot.  Tina Lifford is cast as the cop who helps him.  She has just the right amount of cop savvy and skepticism to make her very real.  Paul Rodriguez is cast as the cop who's jealous of Eastwood's accomplishments.  And there's even a ethnic angle thrown in as the murdered woman, her sister and Rodriguez are all of Mexican descent. The setting is Los Angeles and Eastwood lives on a houseboat in the Marina.  His next-door-neighbor is Jeff Daniels, who becomes Eastwood's sidekick.
I enjoyed all the acting, the cinematography and the storyline.  It didn't even matter to me that it was all a little too farfetched and that some of the details of the plot didn't make sense.

First of all, Eastwood does a nice job playing McCaleb, the ex-FBI guy with a heart transplant. When you see him in the mini-documentary after the film, you realize the slow speech and overall beaten tone of his character is 'acting'. I feel a few of the other reviewers may have missed that. He is so spry and well-spoken that the contrast to the movie is a bit startling.
As usual in an Eastwood film, he surrounds himself with A+ talent. There are a few clunky lines spread throughout the movie; it is by no means perfect. But his ensemble manages to make it so you hardly care.
The only truly disposable characters were Paul Rodriguez, who quickly becomes tiresome, and Dylan Walsh, because I don't think he had one line in the whole thing.
The procedural portion of the film is very slowly and carefully told; it may put off viewers lacking patience. The melodramatic portion (he's investigating the murder of the person whose heart he now has...) may cause a viewer or two to roll their eyes, but those who are willing will enjoy a crisp adult crime film.

1453843,4,B00005JLGP,"Blood Work is a timely subject, foreshadowing ethical, political, and personal questions which will become more important as we adjust to the transplantation and creation of body parts to keep ourselves alive. The basic story revolves around FBI profiler Terry McAleb's need for, acquisition of, and resulting complications from receiving a life-giving heart donation from a murder victim. Although Connelly's work is good in itself, Brian Helgeland's screenplay makes the story come alive in ways the book cannot. Clint Eastwood has been criticized for many aspects of his self-directing, self-producing, and self-starring roles, but the movie works and it is much more entertaining than the book. The May-September Wanda De Jesus-Eastwood romance enhances the story's theme of renewal of life and adds more poignancy than is possible in the book where the two characters are closer in age. Although Paul Rodriguez's over-the-top performance as the PO'd Latino detective is distracting (albeit, with some funny lines), I think it brings out the ethnic interplay of the characters and the environment better than the book does. After all, this is LA, and this is today. But where the movie really shines is in the portrayal of the villain. In the book, we catch only fleeting glimpses of the killer and never hear about his motives from him. However, in the movie, the villain is an integral part of the story. His life and motives may be a little too obvious and perhaps subtract from the suspense, but the book doesn't do any better job of fleshing out evil. The ending also shines in the movie but falls short in the book. Connelly gave us little dread or anticipation. The movie delivers both, not only with Eastwood's constant concern about his heart transplant going bad and a violent bout with a burly Russian, but also with the final confrontation between Eastwood and the killer himself.

Oh, well, I think Eastwood did a remarkably good job in bringing this excellent Michael Connelly book to screen.  Having read the book, it was good to see Brian Hildegard's screenplay maintain the feel and tension of the novel.  Eastwood directs well, and plays his role of Terry McCaleb to the max.  It's one of the first movies where he plays a character more suitable to his age; but as my wife says, who cares if he's 72 and romances younger women?  She said he could put her shoes under her bed anytime; of course, she'd have to move  mine!  But I digress...Wanda DeJesus and Tina Lifford are fine as the women in Clint's life--I particularly liked Lifford's portrayal of Jan, whose involvement with Clint goes a little deeper than what we think?  I loved Paul Rodriguez and Dylan Walsh as the LA cops who want Clint out of the way.  Walsh who doesn't say a lot, has a commanding presence as an alternate to Rodriguez's bravado.  Anjelica Huston is perfect as Clint's doctor: I've known medical people just like her.  Takes a small role and commands the screen when she's on.

This film is a clunker from stem to stern & the presence of old Clint just scuttles any chance of rising above the script's limitations.  I am stunned that such a major presence in Action Cinema would turn in such a paint-by-number episode.

1453953,4,B00005JLGP,"This film is excellent, but obvious, and perhaps that's by design.
What Clint Eastwood has done in ""Blood Work"" is to create a detective-thriller that is more about the detective than it is about the crime.  That is not a new twist, and neither is the fact that the criminal he is investigating is targeting him specifically for special attention.  What Eastwood does here to make this a worthy film is to take a conventional, derivative story and tell it with such a commitment to avoiding sentimentality or egotism that the ""same old same old"" kind of movie becomes entertaining again.  On top of that, Eastwood uses both realism and irony with such deft craftmanship; it is not an exaggeration to say that I truly appreciate how secure I feel when I'm watching one of his stories unfold.  I know I'm in good hands, and I can't wait to see what's coming next.
The hero is vulnerable.  Extraordinarily so.  In fact, the very nature of his weakness is the foundation upon which the entire structure of the plot is built.  It is a heavy-handed notion to present to an audience, but this film is not the first time someone has tried to tell a story with a premise that is symbolic to the point of absurdity.  I think, perhaps, that Mr. Eastwood knew exactly what he was doing, though, because he takes this 500 pound gorilla and just lets it be a gorilla.
He explores his subject, and he lets it be what it's got to be, and he doesn't dress it up.  That's where the ego-less nature of Eastwood's directing and acting are really appreciated.  The story is first.  The truth of that character, in that situation, comes first.  There is no hero's hero in the sense that traditional Hollywood likes for the cop-thriller.  Instead, the audience gets treated to a pretty thorough exploration of the Eastwood persona that's emerged in his later films.  Those films include ""Unforgiven"", ""In the Line of Fire"", ""True Crime"", ""Absolute Power"", and even ""The Bridges of Madison County""--where he's become the guy who's too old, too sick, too snake-bitten, or too late, who can't possibly beat the odds that are against him unless he just stays true to himself, and he somehow does and wins the day, as well as redemption.
This film is a case study of that type of Eastwood character, and I think in years to come that this will be a touchstone work in his oeuvre, in terms of the way Eastwood always seems to be poking at his own persona.  I only have two criticisms of the film, but they combine to knock this down to four stars instead of five.
First, the casting is flawed.  Jeff Daniels did his best and I can live with that, but I would rather have seen a better actor play the goofball role, rather than see an actor known for goofball roles simply pushing himself a little farther.  There are a lot of actors out there who could have pulled off that part a lot better.  Case in point: Wanda De Jesus was a fantastic pick for the part of Graciella.  A lot of other, better-known actresses could have come in and cakewalked the part of a strong,
suffering woman on a mission; but it was wonderful to see (A) an excellent, unknown actress get the job wonderfully done, and (B) the pleasant surprise of seeing a non-white actress be the one who delivers such a powerful performance.  Conversely, I also question the casting of Paul Rodriguez here, based on the same objections I have with Jeff Daniels' casting; why not go for someone who doesn't look like he's just delivering a pparody of his past roles?
My second criticism is the failure of the film to answer a few key questions with any kind of clarity.  Of course, that can't be discussed in this review, but suffice it to say that there are a couple key plot points that get glossed over in crucial moments, and it's annoying because it almost comes off like Eastwood simply forgot to tie them up (he could have, quite
easily).  He's not sloppy like that very often.
Incidentally, I'd like to note that Angelica Huston fans will be, perhaps, ambivalent about her casting in this film.  Her acting, of course, is first-rate; I particularly enjoyed her the most out of all the fine
people who worked in this project, but for her fans, this will be a character that she hasn't normally done.
Overall, I highly recommend this film for Eastwood fans and for fans of investigative thrillers.  Always there and rarely explained for the audience are the usual realistic touches that saturate Eastwood's films.  To provide examples of this is to spoil the fun of watching it, though, so just take my word for it!  Get this DVD and immerse yourself in some excellent, confident storytelling.",1058140800,,4630,4.595382746051032
1453954,4,B00005JLGP,"This film celebrates Clint's long overdue return to the murder mystery genre. And returns he does in high style and with a true passion in ""Blood Work"", a meaningful play on words that becomes evident over the progress of the film.  Eastwood' s knowing, Oscar-winning directorial hands are firmly in evidence from the outset, and he has lovingly given us terrific cinematography of the San Diego seascapes along which much of the plot occurs.  Her Clint plays a retired FBI profiler whose last assignment was with a serial murderer who got away, and by way of the opening chase scene caused the near-fatal heart attack that puts Eastwood permanently on the sidelines. Or so it would seem, until Eastwood's character receives an unexpected gift of life by way of a heart transplant, which serves to re-energize him and gives him a new lease on life. Through a series of seeming coincidences, Eastwood becomes re-involved in the case as a private detective, and what he discovers spins the case (and his life) into automatic overdrive.
What results is indeed a thinking man's mystery, carried out with excitement and a lot of intersting plot turns along the way. The script is both tight and compelling, written by the author of ""LA Confidential"". Jeff Daniels is very good as the neighbor living two boats down from Clint's at the Marina, and given his own infirmities, Eastwood involves him in the proceedings as a designated driver. I had a strong suspicion from early on in the film based on my own personal animus against coincidences, and turned out to be pleasantly surprised with what I discovered as the plot progressed. This would be a  welcome addition to anyone's murder mystery genre collection, one that is smart, suspenseful, and entertaining.  Giving Clint's age of 72, it is unlikely there will ever be another Dirty Harry episode. In its absence, this entry satisfies the continuing hunger pains quite nicely.

Hooey? Well, of course it is. But the movie has to jumpstart itself somehow.
So, anyway, Eastwood ain't bad and admiring Wanda DeJesus is a decent way to spend an evening. Eastwood's leisurely ""real time"" method of directing a scene lets us relax a little, enjoy the flavor of the meat, if you will. I like that about Eastwood, even if I wouldn't want to see it every day. He plays the right cards here, letting scenes play long for atmosphere. Lord knows there ain't a lot of suspense.
Like I said, a six-year-old can figure out the killer. It so plain-as-day you almost get faked out and think ""this is the red herring to end all red herrings."" The book can take its time a little, reveal itself more slowly. A movie has a budget, and it has actors, and those actors are paid, and you bet your bottom penny a studio isn't going to pay a well-known actor to just pal around on a houseboat. That said, the pal is effectively chilling in a showdown scene, almost gross, which for once seems about right.

It has a pulp novelist's crux and the kind that can work in a movie if the right things happen, but screenwriter Hegeland couldn't make the magic that he did with L.A. Confidential.  Most disappointing is the same uneven nature that has made Eastwood's directing career more uneven than his acting one.  I think Eastwood's strength is that he sees the world from a heroic perspective, and he makes a great hero for that genre.  He can even be great when he plays against that type in movies like Unforgiven.  For years I have tried to figure out why his movies can be so uneven and I think it is the way he directs actors.  When he has a top notch cast like in Unforgiven or Midnight in Garden of Good and Evil, he really pulls off something special.  But the actors playing the modern day scenes in Bridges of Madison County were so bad that it killed an otherwise beautifully directed film.  Here's Eastwood with mediocre material like Bridges and he and Meryl Streep are just genius, but the grown kids are horrid.  The same thing happens in BLOOD WORK.  Jeff Daniels is his usual underrated, but comic Paul Rodriguez is so inconsistent in his emotions and behavior that he renders his own character unrealistic.  The lessor known actors also have a way of playing as if they are just in a movie.  Clint, though, is his usual genius on screen as he continues to prove to be one of the ten greatest actors in film history.

Not that he's bad, but he's on cruise control with this one.  He plays a retired cop who comes out for a special case because he feels he owes it to the requestor.  He's totally convincing as someone who knows his way around a police investigation.  But then, he's had experience playing cops a lot of times.  This could be Dirty Harry at this age.
But I think what turns me off most is the performance by Paul Rodriguez.  Of course he has to get resistance from the police, and Rodriguez, who is usually a decent actor, just goes way overboard (in one scene, literally) in his conviction to stop Eastwood from basically trying to help out.

He also knows gives the audience credit for being smart enough to make connections without having to spell everything out for them.  (I sure wish other directors understood that audiences do not need everything explained to them.)  But I have two big problems with the film - one of character and one of casting.  Even if I had never read the book, I would still have these problems: First, Detective Arrango's role is convoluted.  Is he a true foil for McCaleb or is he onscreen for comic relief?  To me, his function in the film as an irritant for McCaleb was not believable or consistent.  One moment he jokes with McCaleb like they're buddies, the next he's in McCaleb's face.  Then he's a clown...Too many hats, too many faces.  Second, 15 minutes into the movie, I know who the killer is.  Why?  You have no big-name actor playing the villain.

Blame can also be laid at the feet of whoever wrote the creaky script, and the casting department won't being getting any props,either--it goes without saying that Eastwood is his usual wooden self, but both Paul Rodriquez and Jeff Daniels are irritating and miscast, respectively. The actresses come off a little better, with Tina Lifford as a former partner and Anjelica Huston as Eastwood's cardiologist faring best, though anyone buying the supposed attraction between Eastwood and Wanda De Jesus needs their head checked.

In BLOOD WORK, Eastwood plays retired FBI serial killer profiler Terry McCaleb, who is called out of retirement to catch a killer who retired when he did, but has come out of retirement to dance again with an unwilling partner.  McCaleb is the serious-minded cop that I imagined Harry Callahan from DIRTY HARRY would have grown into.  McCaleb is the consummate professional who notes that most big name crimes are not solved by brilliant policework or the extra-legal bruisings that Callahan used against the Scorpio Killer but rather by the little things that often get overlooked in the initial investigation.  McCaleb is tired, gravelly-voiced, and has a bad ticker that lands him in the hospital.  He is given a heart transplant, and is astounded to learn that the sister of the donor has tracked him down to help her find her sister's killer.  At this point, director Eastwood plays actor Eastwood like a finely tuned and familiar violin, each time hitting just the right note.  Even though Eastwood shows every bit of his age, his ability to radiate his passion for the law makes his romance with the much younger sister (Wanda DeJesus) of his late donor seem more the need for two lost souls to reconnect to their roots than it is merely a dirty old man scarfing up on a ready opportunity.  For much of the middle half, Eastwood and Jeff Daniels team up to form a buddy movie as both seek to find the killer.  Eastwood is so good at his craft that it was not difficult to overlook the logical flaws of a myriad of twists and turns that point the audience first one way, than another.

The intracacies of the murder plot are fine, though not any better than an average episode of ""Boomtown"" or ""Law and Order,"" leading up to the usual climactic firearm battle.

 This film starts out with a scene that never takes place in the book, and it introduces characters too early. We are following the investigation of the ""CODE KILLER"" when Terry Mcaleb has a heart attack chasing the killer. Then we go into a long hour that is almost identical to the book (except some bridging of long investigations). The script is taken directly from the book, line by line. If you read the book before watching this movie, you will notice how every line is stolen directly from the pages.
 ...After that boring hour and a half, we find the story takes a completely different twist then the book, and I could not tell you why. Maybe to keep the people who read the book guessing? Well trust me, you'll just be laughing as the story takes a different ending, giving us a different killer, and instead of his investigation leading him to Mexico like the book, it takes him out into the waters of his own bay where an ""Abandoned"" ship is the setting for a ridiculous game of cat and mouse that would put a five year old on speed to sleep.
 You liked the book? Good, now keep it that way, don't see this movie. Not only will it ruin the book for you, it will leave you with burning images of Clint Eastwood half naked kissing a perfect faced 35 year old.

Still a strong presence on screen, Eastwood has proven an even greater presence behind the camera. His films, for the most part, seem concerned with older men who in their youth had rough-and-tumble lifestyles and careers and find themselves looking not to regain lost glory but to make some sense of it in the autumn of their lives. Unforgiven, of course, highlights this theme. His newest film Blood Work is about a murder investigation, but more importantly, it is about the way in which the detective's perspective, motivation, and determination toward the process change and are heightened by a brush with death and a second chance at life. The actual investigation takes the film down well-worn paths with elements that are as predictable as they are interesting, but it's on the character level that the film rises above its familiar parts",1042070400,,990,4.934131736526946

Director/star Eastwood uses his age to good advantage here, playing a man who is so concerned about his health that he doesn't even want to drive himself around town.  Nevertheless, his mind is as sharp as ever.  Although the pace of the film is deliberate, I was intrigued by the mystery and surprised by the key observation toward the end of the film that provided the key to finding the killer.
A couple relatively minor but still annoying points marred my enjoyment of this fine film.  There is some over-the-top gunplay in the middle of the story that seemed to belong in another movie.  Also, although the romance between DeJesus and Eastwood was tender and very well acted, its just a little bit creepy to see men in their seventies hooking up with women who are young enough to be their own granddaughters.

BASIC STORY:
During a homicide investigation, a famous FBI profiler, who has been getting notes from the killer, shows up at a crime scene, only to suffer a heart attack running down and wounding the suspect.  We flash forward to Terry Caleb, now a regular citizen relaxing on his boat in retirement after his heart transplant.  Soon however, the heart donor's sister, is hitting up Terry for a solution to her sister's murder.  He owes her one and is guilted into at least looking into it.  The local cops are stumped, and one detective in particular, is pretty burnt that citizen Caleb, has the nerve to butt into his case.  He calls in some favors and at least gets some details.
FAR OUT:
In typical Dirty Harry fashion, yes he gets the girl.  However, in his 70+ years, you question why this 20-30 year old girl would even consider this.  Hey, this is Hollywood. Show me a 72-year old woman, getting a 25-year old boyfriend and I'll be converted.  Also you can see he is somewhat gingerly nursing his transplant scar of 2 months.  I cannot imagine a man of that many years and recent health situation, being up to the challenge just yet.
GOOFY PARTNER:
Also in Dirty Harry fashion he finds a partner to abuse.  This time it is his next door neighbor of Dumb and Dumber fame.  He needs a driver until he is all set with his new heart.  Air bags and heart transplants aren't a good combination.
NICELY INVOLVED STORY
Soon after he starts investigating this crime, some things don't quite make sense the way he is expecting and he starts to see a different twist.  His work as a citizen and not even a PI, really ticks off some local cops.  Apparently too his old serial killer buddy knows he is up and around as well.  It gets more and more interesting.
I felt it was well paced and an enjoyable movie, just involved and fast enough to be entertaining.  But, give it up Clint, you are getting to old for this group of girls.",1041724800,5,2034,4.501362397820164

But this movie surprised me.  Possibly its because I watched it on four separate nights, a little bit at a time, and allowed each segment to settle into my subconscious.  I felt I got to know the characters.  The movie was slow and easy-going, even though a killer is on the loose and Clint is prone to play fast and loose with buckshot on what seems to be a Culver City street.  His fetching black female cop friend gets out her own piece and shoots hell out of the suspected perp's vehicle even though she doesn't even know what's going on.  All this and the movie has a subdued, contemplative feel.  You gotta like this movie.
And then there's Buddy, the self-described Boat Bum who is Clint's next door neighbor down at the marina.  I really fell for this character.  So minor, so plausible as an ordinary, idle man who knows that he is a loser, preferring to sit life out on the sidelines with a sad little smile and a case of beer.  This man is so human, so full of muted pathos.  The movie is a strangely meditative cop drama where all these little characters loom larger than life because, without realizing it, our attention dwells on them so long.  We think we're watching an action movie.  We feel like we're watching an action movie.  And yet, subliminally, we are fed a muted, fragile human-interest picture where almost all of the characters are somehow frail.",1041465600,11,1550,4.5215827338129495
1454285,3,B00005JLGP,"Blood Work is a somewhat typical cop vs. serial killer type story.  The serial killer gets his jollies by leaving some sort of cryptic code at each murder and leaving messages for the policeman who chases him.  And so it goes, we've seen it all before.
The basic premise of Blood Work is that the cop, Terry McCaleb (Clint Eastwood) ends up being sidelined by heart disease and ends up getting a heart transplant a couple of years later.  Two months after his transplant the donor's sister comes around looking for McCaleb to find out who killed her sister.  Against the strenuous objections of his cardiologist (Angelica Houston), who worries about the new heart being rejected in McCaleb's still weak state, he takes on the assignment.  Jeff Daniels plays Buddy, a boatbum neighbor that McCaleb pays to drive him around.
As you've probably guessed, it turns out that the donor was shot by the serial killer that McCaleb was trying to catch two years ago during his heart attack.  What's more, the donor was shot with the express purpose of getting McCaleb her heart, so that he could resume the game of trying to catch the serial killer.  And who is the serial killer?  Well, it's Buddy the boatbum, of course.
The movie is basically predictable.  After all, isn't the goal of most of these movies to make the guilty party the least likely person right under your nose?  It's getting a little old.  Worse, during the hunt to find the person who shot the donor, McCaleb becomes 'involved' with her sister.  Oh, will someone kindly spare me the unlikely romance bit?  Is it absolutely essential that the writers come up with a love story in every one of these films?
Still, the acting in this movie is good and there is a polish to the film that is much appreciated.  With Eastwood directing, the viewer is treated to a slow paced film that provides a little more brain candy than adreneline.  Some viewers, such as myself, will enjoy this quality.  Others will wish that they hurry up with it.  Overall, a predictable story but entertaining enough movie.  Certainly there are worse ways to kill a couple of hours.",1041379200,,2114,4.682926829268292

1454287,2,B00005JLGP,"Dirty Harry meets Grumpy Old Men, really that about sums up this movie. Blood Work is a detective movie that Clint Eastwood is at the heart of. A FBI Profiler Terry McCaleb (Eastwood) tries to runs down a suspect outside of a homicide crime scene but has a heart attack before he can catch him. He has to have heart transplant in order to live. He learns that the heart he got was from a murdered woman.
The sister of the murdered woman tracks Terry, who is now retired from the FBI down and pleads with him to look into the investigation. So with a license or the authority he takes on the investigation. The investigation goes from one unbelievable twist to another.
I found this movie to move way to fast. The twists and the conclusions that Eastwoods makes from the clues are really hard to swallow. In particular the part when the sister asks for his help. He basically jumped to this womans rescue without even thinking about what he was getting himself into. He was only sixty days post-op from his transplant surgery.
I think this was Eastwoods last hurray at a detective movie. At least I hope. He should stick to directing as he states he wants to do more of in the making of special feature. I think he wanted one more Dirty Harry moment before he stepped behind the camera.",1041033600,,1285,4.4491525423728815
1454288,1,B00005JLGP,"I'll make this short, because after seeing this painful movie, I think I may need a check-up. Let me explain. In the movie Clint Eastwood is only two months from getting a heart transplant. He spends the entire movie with this horrific heart-burn look on his face, constantly rubbing the scar on his chest, and taking pain pills. You think at any moment he's going to drop over. And you find yourself, perhaps sympathetically having your own set of chest pains. This is, of course, not a good thing. Everyone in the movie keeps telling him: ""You look awful"". And he does. But not awful like a character in a film looks awful. I think of the great Jason Robards in ""Once Upon A Time In The West"", who also has a pained look on his face for the entire movie... only to discover that he was shot in the stomach before the story began while escaping from prison, so being the tough cowboy that he was, he was ""grinning and baring"" the pain all the time. However, you got the feeling that this was a character in torment... not the actor himself. In Clint's case, you truly think the actor is about to die any moment. Every time he falls, or is pushed, you find yourself jerking forward, as if saying: ""Oh my God... Clint is hurt!"". This is not a good thing. To make matters worse he adopts a graveling voice that is almost impossible to understand... and again, you wonder if this was a character choice, of if Clint himself is really on death's bed. Matters are made worse, since Clint directed this himself, and the film is truly directed by someone who has one foot in the grave. The pacing is so slow, as to be nonexistent. Not slow as in his classic ""Unforgiven"" which used operatic Sergio Leone pacing to create a mood, but the kind of pacing you get when a poor old man is trying to climb stairs with a walker. The script is a mess, which also upsets us Clint fans, since he has always been hyper scrupulous about his scripts... working on them for months with the writer, and then being enormously loyal to the finished product. (I remember reading how the great writer Joel Oliansky actually complained when Clint directed his script to ""Bird"", because Clint was so loyal to Oliansky's script, he didn't cut a word... something Oliansky actually thought would have helped!) Plot points are thrown out at you, like a blind man stumbling over his guide dog. There's a feeling that this is truly directed by someone in a haze, who doesn't realize how obvious the ""twists"" are. How way ahead the audience is from the filmmakers, so that when they finally do relieve the ""shocking"" end, you've already figured it out, gone to the kitchen, made a sandwich and ate it already. The seen-a-million-times-before scenes like Clint convincing the dyspeptic cops to give him clues in the acoustical tiled interrogation room is so badly staged, written and directed, that you truly believe that it was phoned in while Clint took a well deserved nap. I'm a huge Clint Eastwood fan. And to see this sorry mess really does hurt almost as much as the sympathetic chest pains. I doubt if he really is as feeble as this movie makes him out to be. But since he controlled all aspects of the film, and let himself look like someone dragged out from a second-rate old age home for one last fling at movie making... you wonder if this truly is what he's become. I think of Sean Connery, who is actually a bit older than Clint, and how magnificent he looks and acts in his movies these days. Either Clint needs to truly take a long nap and rest off the laurels of a staggeringly productive career, or he needs to fire himself as director and find someone who knows how to make him look more like his old self, and less like an audition for ""Six Feet Under"".
In closing, I know that he was upset that Warner Brothers buried this movie when it was released. I think he should thank them. When you factor in the cost of mortuaries these days... I'd say he got off cheap.",1040947200,2,3947,4.468144044321329

1454360,3,B00005JLGP,"My three star rating may look unkind, but actually it is 3.5, so don't be mistaken.  Clint Eastwood never played any other role than Eastwood (or Dirty Harry), that's true, but the point is, he does it cool, and does it with confidence.  He knows what he is doing, even as a director, and ""Blood Work"" is another proof that he is one of the accomplished directors of America.
Eastwood is ex-FBI profiler Terry McCareb, now retired after one bloody case of murder.  Recovered from severe heart attack which hit him during the invetigation, he gets an operation.  Now a heart transplant recepient, Terry is advised to live quitely by his doctor Anjelica Huston.  But an unexpected visitor comes to him, asking him to help her; her sister was murdered at a grocery shop, and she says she has a good reason to ask Terry to do what she needs.
Back in former business, Terry starts his own search for the killer, and the film displays some actions (including shootings) and activities of Terry with his sidekick Jeff Daniels (""Speed"" and ""Dumb and Dumber""), but it is Eastwood whom we would watch with certain amount of respect and feeling of ""wow"".  In fact, even though he was born in 1930, he still is in good shape, with his tough and cool images all around.  You may say this guy Terry is just an elder version of Harry, and you're right.  But when Eastwood does it, he does it better than anyone, blending his machismo with some sort of resignation and sadness which only those veterans can exude.
Once I heard that Eastwood behind the carema never shouts or yells when shooting -- no ""Action!"" no ""Cut!"" -- but speaks it quietly (and in Italian too).  Probably so.  The pace of the film is always assured, showing that director Eastwood perfectly comprehends his subject.  No flashy camera work is there; you see his assured touch of direction, which can be neither too fast nor too slow.  Like his previous ""Space Cowboys"", ""Blood Work"" never runs, but is always moving.
You might find the script of Brian Helgeland (""LA Confidential"" ""Knight's Tale"" and others) a little too transparent, but it keeps you interested even though some of you might detect the truth half on the way.  But as I said, it is the film of Clint Eastwood who, as you know, loves jazz music.  And like jazz, the film may look too slow and quiet for younger audiences as it goes with leisured pace.

Blood Work isn't one of his best, but he did a great job. I was convinced he had an heart attack, in fact it was a little annoying, as I thought he was going to have a real one.  I imagine this is his swan song as far as shoot'em up run 'em down movies of his younger years. And why not! It would still be good to see him in any detective work, forensic or otherwise. A great actor!
Craciella Rivers, 'Flawless, The Insider,' did a great job as the sister of the murdered girl and whose heart was given to Clint.  She tracks Clint (an x FBI agent) down and wants him to find the killer. The story drags a little and Paul Rodriques, city cop 'Ronoldo' display's his angst toward Clint and in another movie, Clint would have slapped him around, but instead he gets the last verbal shot at the raving Renoldo. Very funny scene. I was wondering what Angelica Houston , 'Buffalo 66 ,' Ever After-was doing in this small part as the Dr. taking care of Clint, but then remembered that Clint was a great friend of John Houston, Angelica's father!

1454363,3,B00005JLGP,"The film starts off with a crime scene at a suburban house.  On a wall in a second floor bedroom a clue is left for FBI profiler Terry McCaleb (Clint Eastwood) -- the same painted message as the previous murders by this serial killer known as the ""Code Killer.""  Outside the house, the killer is watching McCaleb's every move.  McCaleb recognizes the muddy shoe impression on the stairs as matching that of an onlooker.  A chase around the neighborhood block ensues, and before long McCaleb gets a heart attack.  This forces him to retire and he winds up needing a heart transplant.  Two years into his retirement he is contacted by the sister of a recent murder victim looking for his help to find the killer.  It turns out McCaleb received the murder victim's heart.  What follows is a back-to-basics police work of following up on leads and finding suspects.
Clint Eastwood is definitely showing signs of slowing down.  He doesn't have the ""edge"" I normally associate with Dirty Harry.  For this role, I could even describe him as being sedate.  I found the romance between Graciella (the murder victim's sister) and McCaleb to be distracting and a bit weird.  The age difference is easily 30 years.  I didn't need to see any of that to enjoy the plot of this movie.  And perhaps this would've shortened the film a bit.  This is a long film (about 2 hours).  Perhaps longer than it has a right to be.
All in all, the story has a good, steady progression towards the unmasking of the killer.  The acting probably could've been better on everyone's part.  There are moments of hilarity from Paul Rodriguez (who plays the role of Detective Arrango).  There are awkward moments with Eastwood's interaction with the supporting female cast.  If you're a diehard Clint Eastwood fan, this film won't disappoint.  But for the rest of us, this film doesn't impress.

1454364,4,B00005JLGP,"The once and former mayor of Carmel, California has delivered another excellent film!
For me and my generation (I'm 40), Clint Eastwood was THE western hero.  Oh sure, there is no doubt that John Wayne reigned supreme, even in our minds, but Clint's portrayals were more sinister.  Then there were the Dirty Harry films - this was the thinking man's Arnold Schwarzenegger - he didn't need muscles to take out a man - just that enormous pistol and his gravelly retorts.
In fact, Arny should thank Clint for a career, because without Dirty Harry, I doubt there would have been any of Arny's characters in film.
Eastwood has certainly had a few misfires:  Any Which Way They Can (?) and as a director: Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.
With Blood Work, Eastwood shows us he's not only got the goods as an actor but as a director too.
Based on a good novel, Eastwood had good source material. (However, if my recollection is good, the story line is slightly adjusted in this film).  Terry McCaleb is a FBI profiler on the trail of a serial killer.  He physically ""makes"" the guy, but doesn't see his face.  He chases him down and even manages to shoot the SOB while he has a serious heart attack.
Flash forward two years and Terry is recovering from a heart transplant that has put him out of commission for a while.  Suddenly, a beautiful hispanic woman shows up at his door with information that her sister's heart resides in his chest after she was executed during a convenience store hold-up.
Guilt and curiosity compel Terry to investigate further.  Soon, Terry realizes that the hold-up killer is responsible for other killings as well.
I dare not tell more, as it will ruin the film for you.  However, suffice it to say that you will be entertained and surprised repeatedly.  This is a very detailed, character driven thriller AND who-dun-it.  There is much detail and the devil is in the details in this film.

But, I saw that Eastwood had worked some with Michael Connelly (the author) when the book was written. So I thought Eastwood would do right by the book and I let his age slide.
The movie started out just fine and I settled back for a great experience, but then it all started falling apart. The tight plot that I loved in the book was destroyed and was replaced by a contrived piece of nonsense. The fascinating twists and turns of the investigation were eliminated - for example a brilliant deduction by the main character was replaced by an inane comment made by a child. By the end of the movie, I was hoping the killer would win. I wanted Eastwood to pay for trashing a great story. The intelligence, excitement and thrilling plot were replaced by a dull, slow-paced Eastwood vehicle. And the shame was...it didn't have to be that way. I actually wondered if Eastwood had set out to destroy the book because of a personal
grudge.

It's getting more and more far fetched that a brunette bombshell would actually fall for him. 3) It's a shame that the killer is always just a lunatic. You think by now the hollywood people could create motives. But no, they just make the killer a physco and expect us to be satisfied.
However, despite these flaws this movie is still an above average cop film. Definitely better than such standard fare as The Bone Collector or Along Came A Spider.

Graciella (Wanda De Jesus) shows up to request that McCaleb get back in harness to investigate the death of her sister, who was murdered in a convenience store holdup. McCaleb at first demurs, but then has a change of heart, so to speak, when he learns that the dead woman was the donor of his new ticker.
The best part of BLOOD WORK, also directed and produced by Eastwood, is watching Clint depict the aging, debilitated and physically vulnerable McCabe, who can perhaps be viewed as a composite of all the other heroes played by Clint over the decades, only older.  Eastwood, possibly mindful of his own mortality, is perhaps acknowledging time's inexorable march through Terry's persona. Beyond that, the film had its uneven moments. Paul Rodriguez plays Detective Arrango, a Latino LAPD cop so gratuitously buffoonish and unpleasant that I'm surprised the Brotherhood of Latino Law Enforcement Officers isn't suing. Anjelica Huston overacts her role as McCabe's cardiologist, Dr. Bonnie Fox, who's snappishly unsympathetic to Terry's desire to see justice done for the woman whose heart keeps him alive. Moreover, McCabe early on hypothesizes an unknown circumstantial link between Graciela's sister and another man murdered by (apparently) the same killer. Though Terry is proven right, of course, the evidence for this premature conclusion was decidedly unclear to this viewer at the time. Additionally, it was never explained how the killer got access to crucial blood type records, and this was a major loose end in my book since such data isn't in the public domain. On the other hand, Jeff Daniels does a swell job as Buddy, McCabe's neighbor in the next boat slip. Buddy, an affable but unemployed and self-professed loser, supplements monetary support from his father by acting as Terry's driver during the latter's investigations.
BLOOD WORK has a plot gimmick that eventually leads to a satisfying ending involving McCabe, Graciella and the Bad Guy.  Despite its flaws, I liked this film a lot simply because Eastwood will always be my all-time favorite cinematic Tough Guy.",1030233600,90,2858,4.927385892116183
