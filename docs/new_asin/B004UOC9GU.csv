This is one of the better SyFy fantasy productions based on Homers Odyssey.  I have not seen Odysseus & the Isle of Mists the prequel yet but I look forward to it.  I only wish I could find both movies on Region 1 discs or Amazon Instant Digital.

My problem with it is that I felt that the dialogue was Shakespeare-lite, as if the writer wanted to give it some gravitas by mimicking a kind of Shakespearean language. Also, it featured Homer as a scribe on Odysseus' ship who was recording his voyage. This by itself was ok, but it showed him as a nerd. I was also bothered somewhat by the story's reliance on the Dracula theme. Odysseus had to kill the wicked woman who had power to hypnotize people, with a wooden staff and a kind of cross.",1389225600,,662,4.390243902439025
