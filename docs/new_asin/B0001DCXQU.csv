8010609,5,B0001DCXQU,"A grim tone introduces Episode 11 of Pretear, as Awayuki town is plastered with missing posters of a certain tulip-headed girl missing for three days.  That's Himeno the Pretear and Princess of Light, who after the disaster in the Leafe Knights' home of Leafenia, is conducting scattered attacks against demon larvae on Earth.  However, Mawata, her stepsister, is on the verge of mental collapse.

Part of the problem is that Mawata had kept all her frustrations and pain inside.  Her mother, Natsue, assumed that everything was all right, that Mawata really had it together.  All in all, the whole family is clueless to her suffering.  But keeping her pain bottled up only goes so far, and finally Mawata lashes out:  ""You're not my family!  You're just strangers living in the same house.  I wanted to cry but I couldn't.  Nobody knew how lonely I was, how sad I was.  No one tried to understand.  Ever since Father left me, I was always always alone!""  Fenrir and her new servant, the ex-Leafe Knight, then complete Mawata's mental destruction.  ""Free from everything which made you suffer.  Your heart smeared in despair will become a shell which shall protect you from this tainted world of humans.""  Mawata then becomes the core of the Great Tree of Fenrir, which erupts from the Earth, its source of power being the deep loneliness and despair of those who have lost loved ones.

The battle is fought on three fronts.  Mannen, Shin, and Hajime, the three child Knights, fight off the larvae in the city while helping the population to evacuate.  Go and Kei fight the larvae in the ruins of the Awayuki mansion, while Hayate takes on Fenrir's new right-hand.  And the Awayuki family, finally realizing what Mawata had been going through, are united in trying to rescue her.

""The world which wounded me and made me suffer will soon crumble.  Soon, no one will get hurt or suffer, nor love...""  For a long time, that was something I wished, for everything to be over so I would never be hurt.  However, our brave Tuliphead-I mean Himeno, confronts Fenrir, countering the Princess's argument of never being hurt.  ""Anyone can hurt someone else as long as they're alive.  But if you're scared of that, you can't trust anyone.  Even family and friends.  There are times when you hurt each other, but they believe in each other, so they can start over and over again.""  Himeno also hits it on the head in saying that Takako doesn't want to be the Princess of Despair, and being that hasn't helped her, as she's still suffering.

The concept of the White Pretear has a Christ-like similarity, of someone sacrificing herself to defeat despair by forgiving everyone their sins.  Yoko Ishida's opening theme is titled ""White Destiny"" and mentions ""the snow of happiness falling over the world,"" something also created by the White Pretear.

Villain though she is, Fenrir does have a cool scene in which she enters the Awayuki estate.  When Mayune demands who she is, Fenrir coolly walks past her, leaving behind a trail of black.  And from the black, emerge those cuddly demon larvae (ha ha) that have terrorized Earth.  Mayune totally freaks out and runs away screaming.  Given the brat that she is, Fenrir scores points for scaring her.

So how does it end?  Will the Knights defeat Fenrir and save the world?  Will Hayate and Himeno end up together?  And will Mawata be rescued?

As a whole, the series tries to encompass preserving the Earth and life from destruction, choosing hope over despair, and learning to trust despite being hurt.  What it lacks in brains it more than makes up for in heart, though there are times its shojo audience is apparent.  Not bad for its kind, telling the story in 13 episodes without any lag or filler.",1122163200,4,3738,4.757009345794392
8010610,5,B0001DCXQU,"You've seen Magical Girl anime before, but Pretear re-envisions the magical girls, funny sidekicks, and handsome Knights as a new, darker, more serious tale with heart.

Betrayal and anger.  Dark forces unleashed on the world.  Corruption turning people into weapons of darkness.

Himeno wanted to matter, but now she's the Pretear, a woman whose powers enhance those of the Leafe Knights, the magical defenders of Earth.  Now the fate of the planet is up to her and her new friends.  Now she matters more than ever, and her decisions will shape the fate of the world.

A great ending to a wonderful series.  It'll touch you and make you think.  You get both ""happily ever after"" and some food for thought, and a future that beckons . . .

Warning: This series pretty much is a rewrite of the manga.  Though they have the same characters and ideas (mostly), this series interprets much of it differently.  That being said, both are qutie good.",1115510400,,943,4.717791411042945
8010611,3,B0001DCXQU,"I can't say that I was very pleased with the ending of Pretear.  I guess they had to end it the way they did.  (Think Sailor Moon long, drawn-out happily ever after, even if impossible...kind of a combination of the 1st and 5th series endings, for the Sailor Moon fans out there)  And perhaps I'm too much of a cynic to enjoy a happily ever after ending.  But to me, it just felt...empty.

Perhaps it was the fact that in the first 10 episodes Pretear blew the competition (in it's genre, at least) away that I was hoping for something a little more original.  Perhaps is is the fact that disc 3 ended on such a cliffhanger that I was hoping for a little bit more resolution in the story line, as well as a little bit more action.

All I know is my own opinion.  And my opinion is that while Pretear still remains one of the greatest magical girl anime ever, the ending fell a little flat.  It seemed like all the character development we saw over the course of the first 10 episodes was forgotten.  And I swear, I could hear the cheesy American-ized Sailor Moon music (when she fights Queen Beryl) during the entire disc.

If you've already gotten this far, you'll want the final episodes.  But be warned, it may not be as fulfilling as you hoped.",1099440000,5,1248,4.331896551724138
8010612,5,B0001DCXQU,"Here is the final volume in the beautiful and superbly executed Pretear series.  As someone who owns the entire Pretear series, I can honestly tell you that the hype surrounding it is all true.  Pretear is a strong character-driven story with adorable humour and real heart that not only makes sense, but is captivating and exciting as well.  In this series, the English voice acting is very good, but the Japanese dub is brilliant!  If you are looking for non-stop action (mecha or martial arts) then you need to look elsewhere.  Pretear combines elements from the fairy tale ""Snow White"" with a wonderful, innovative story idea.  Combine that with the exquisite animation, beautiful character and costume designs, excellent voice acting and interviews with the english voice actors (spread out over all 4 volumes) and you have a classic work of anime.

In volume four of Pretear, the final showdown between Himeno and the Leafe Knights against Takakko, the Princess of disaster, will be settled once and for all.  Himeno's step-sister, Mawata, is being held captive inside the evil Tree of Fenrir.  The tree feeds off of Mawata's deep feelings of despair, and uses that power to drain the world's Leafe (energy).  Himeno, her family and the Leafe Knights must hurry to rescue Mawata from the tree, and ultimately save the world from destruction.

The entire Pretear series really struck a cord with me, because of the emotion involved.  It showed us how anyone, even someone as outgoing as Himeno, can feel alone and sad once in awhile and that we all have someone out there who cares for us.  I think that everyone can relate to something as basic and essential to human life as love.  And if you can, then you will fall in love with the Pretear series.  Pretear does a superb job of exploring the vulnerability of the human heart, and it does so with a grace and beauty that will be seldom seen again in anime...or anywhere else.

The Pretear series is fantastic.  For once, believe the hype surrounding this anime and you too will fall in love with Pretear.",1092528000,7,2062,4.779661016949152
8010613,4,B0001DCXQU,"This disc contains a stunning end to a very sweet series.  The art is consistantly good and the plot contains just enough sugar to satisfy.  The extras are about in par with those on the other discs (that is to say, they aren't particularly fabulous)
the english subtitles occasionally overlap the action in the last episode as the translated song lyrics create quite a subtitle pile up, and most of the action is happening low on the screen anyway.  The english dubbing is pretty good. The voice acting is consistant and believable (for the most part).  I would definately reccomend the entire series.",1081123200,2,602,4.815533980582524
8010614,4,B0001DCXQU,"well, i've just finished the the third volume of this series and and i've really enjoyed it. it has it's funny moments and it's sad moments and even a little bit of lovey dovey moments too, but if you're looking for action packed...sorry, the fighting scenes are few and far between and usually last all of about three seconds. so yeah. anyways i highly recommend pretear to anyone who wants to enjoy a nice clean very well executed series. can't wait to see how it ends.",1079136000,,471,4.488372093023256
