8135904,2,B000H1XKPO,"When director Robert Clouse released&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enter-the-Dragon/dp/6304981635/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enter the Dragon</a>&nbsp;in 1973, a lot of people believed he was gearing up for a promising career. However, by the time ""Force: Five"" was released eight years later, just about everybody had sobered up on that notion. Clouse will always have other successes for fans to remember, but this supposed cult classic is not among them. The movie is a perfect example of how difficult it is to recapture lightning, and how making a movie with the same mentality as the Bruce Lee masterpiece but without Bruce is an act of futility.

The story: Martial artist Jim Martin (Joe Lewis,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jaguar-Lives/dp/B000O75GEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jaguar Lives</a>) is sent to infiltrate the island of the eccentric and dangerous Reverend Rhee (Master Bong Soo Han,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Trial-of-Billy-Jack/dp/B00004XPON/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Trial of Billy Jack</a>), whose hand is suspected in the disappearance of several members of his religious cult. Teaming with five other martial artists, he sets out to expose the cult's deadly secret and rescue a deluded senator's daughter (Amanda Wyss,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Nightmare-on-Elm-Street/dp/B00000JQTT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Nightmare on Elm Street</a>) from the fanatic's clutches.

If there's one thing the film deserves credit for, it's for being one of the first U.S. movies to feature a legitimate supercard of real martial artists: in addition to world karate champion Lewis and Master Han, kickboxing superstar Benny Urquidez (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wheels-on-Meals/dp/6305234922/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wheels on Meals</a>) and future Hong Kong villain Richard Norton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/City-Hunter/dp/B00008WJE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">City Hunter</a>) add themselves to the team of good guys, and all four of them serve up some neat moves. The accolades stop there, however. The rest of the team includes Pam Huntington (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/They-Call-Me-Bruce/dp/B000094FE3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">They Call Me Bruce?</a>), Sonny Barnes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-Creek-Brawl/dp/B0002CR090/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battle Creek Brawl</a>), and Ron Hayden; none of these guys are real martial artists and it shows, with Huntington in particular throwing the sorriest kicks I've ever seen in a karate flick. Then again, none of the choreography is great. I realize that this movie was from the time before Hong Kong influenced Hollywood, but the archaic action direction simply lags, with the vast majority of the fighters fumbling around as though they had inadequate time to rehearse.

The quality of the fight scenes mirrors the quality of production. The movie looks as though it was shot on a porno's budget to begin with and only got worse as it goes on, with dull cinematography and boring sets all the way. The acting's bad by default, with Joe Lewis looking especially awkward. For better or worse, the film's level of absurdity is high, beginning with henchman Bob Schott (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gymkata/dp/B00005JP3R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gymkata</a>) wearing a complete karate uniform wherever he goes, finding a middle ground with Reverend Rhee donning spurred executioner's slippers (a fashion later revived in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kiltro/dp/B00127RAK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kiltro</a>), and peaking when it's revealed (SPOILERS) that Rhee kills his followers by trapping them in a maze and setting a bull loose on them. Jim eventually blows the bull up with spilled gasoline and sparks from an overhead lamp, but the best kill goes to Richard Norton, who uses the pendant he wears around his neck as a shuriken.

Usually a lot of weirdness like this can save a movie, but in this case, it just gets stuck in the sludge along with everything else. The story feels like it's fighting its way out of quicksand, moving along in jerks instead of flowing smoothly, and even if you stay awake throughout the dramatic scenes, almost all coolness the cast brings to the table is nullified by the movie having been made before western directors knew how to stage a good martial arts fight. While the film probably has a place in the libraries of nostalgia hounds, everyone else should think twice before purchasing.",1277078400,2,4863,6.751196172248804
