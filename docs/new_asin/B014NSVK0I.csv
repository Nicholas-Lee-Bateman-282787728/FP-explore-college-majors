7420258,5,B014NSVK0I,"The Power of Spirit and Song . Spencer Proffer & his wife, Judith were producers (put their own money into it) of this Inspirational & Moving Documentary Special.

Going way back to my Disc Jockey days as Leon the Lover  in Cleveland  Detroit  Washington, D.C.  Houston, TX & Los Angeles  Ive always paid attention to the Power of a Great Song.

This song has the power to transport and uplift the listener. Obviously others feel the same. Sometimes a song does more than just sound pleasant to the ear. It delves deep into the heart and mind.

And so it is with Lee Ann Womacks 2000 hit I Hope You Dance.

And now in this Documentary, Brian Wilson, Maya Angelou, Joel Osteen, Vince Gill and Graham Nash are among those who will discuss the impact of the song I Hope You Dance. Lee Ann Womack, who recorded it originally, will tell stories about the creation of the song.

I think many of you will enjoy the interwoven stories - heartwarming, funny, noble and have such depth and truth - a stark contrast to the sea of reality TV so prevalent on television today.

This special is not only available on DVD, but you can also get a beautiful companion book of the stories from the John Scheinfeld film, compiled by Judy Proffer, with a forward written by my good friend  Minister & Life Coach Extraordinaire, Tim Storey. Many of you enjoyed Tim with Oprah on OWNs SuperSoul Sunday.",1449964800,3,1380,4.520161290322581
7420259,5,B014NSVK0I,"A very entertaining and insightful film that speaks both to the power of music and the inspiring nature of this particular song.  The filmmaker expertly weaves personal stories from the co-songwriters, Tia Sillers and Mark D. Sanders, with commentary from other major songwriters (Graham Nash, Brian Wilson and Vince Gill) and notables Maya Angelou and Joel Osteen.  The film also explores the life challenges of four individuals and how they overcame homelessness, loss of a loved one, a serious accident and a broken heart by using the message of this song as their mantra.  For those of you concerned about too much sentimentality - don't be.  The filmmaker strikes just the right note.",1449878400,4,689,5.070796460176991
7420260,5,B014NSVK0I,This is one of the most inspirational documentaries I've ever seen.  It uses Leanne Womack's timeless song (of the same name) to tell the story of how music can inspire and heal us using real people who have suffered real tragedies as examples.,1449792000,6,244,4.674418604651163
7420261,4,B014NSVK0I,"This new 96 documentary film revolves around the 2000 Country mega-hit I Hope You Dance recorded by Lee Ann Womack but composed by the Music Row team of Mark D. Sanders and Tia Sellers. At the time of its release the song evolved into a book based on the lyrics which as a big seller. This project is a bit different and has created, not only this DVD but a related book and audio book.

The film is really two films in one and I hope I can clarify this in my review.

The first 15 minutes or so is about the song itself, how it was composed, and also how a song, or music itself has emotional power. We hear from Womack, Sanders and Sellers as well as the other celebrities listed on the package. Vince Gill talks briefly, Brian Wilson sits at his piano and sings an excerpt from his Good Vibrations and Graham Nash talks and then sings a verse of Teach Your Children. The late author/poet Maya Angelou, give here comments as well.  Then the second section begins. The rest of the film focuses on how the Sanders/Sellers song has affected certain individuals in their struggles. We learn about a woman who became homeless and how through hearing the song, she was able to get her life together. Then there is the woman who suffered a broken neck and spine from an accident and how the song (and music in general) helped her cope with the pain and survive. Lastly there is a young woman who had problems with an abusive marriage and the song pulled her through.

The director  John Scheinfeld  was responsible for the fascinating documentary on singer/songwriter Harry Nilsson and one titled The U.S. vs. John Lennon. The first part of this DVD is in that vein, but the latter part is more of a human interest film. It will certainly show that music can help heal and should give hope to those going through issues similar to those profiled in the film. I just want to clarify that those celebrities touted on the package are only in the film at the beginning  and only for a few minutes each.

The DVD has no Main Menu, chapter selection or bonus features. It just starts when you put it in your DVD or BD player.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
