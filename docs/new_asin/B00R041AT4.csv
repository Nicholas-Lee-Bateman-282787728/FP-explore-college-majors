8693602,5,B00R041AT4,"this is a magnificent film i'd never seen before.  Italy after the War in neo-realist mode.  The cast is unfamiliar except for Giulietta Masina.  The drama proceeds crisply without a dull moment.  Of course, Latuada is a great director;Fellini took part in the writing as did the director.  Racism in the US Army was well known.  Blacks preferred staying abroad, especially in Italy where tolerance was greatest. I remember being stationed in Georgia where my bunk mate, Alonzo could not go to town with the white soldiers.  Later at Ft. Sill, Okla. on tour with a group of singers, stopping in Texas when we stopped to lunch and entered  we were told 'you can sit here, those others must sit in the back'.  We all went back to the bus and I brought in food and drink for my friends.  Shameful, shameful, shameful!  It wasn't so long ago.  Has is changed; well, in a way it has, thank God.  Take a look at this film and you won't regret it.",1447459200,5,940,4.458823529411765
