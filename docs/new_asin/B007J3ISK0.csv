5090491,5,B007J3ISK0,Grandson loves the Wiggles.  Very satisfied with this.  He loves the singing and dancing and knows all the characters by name.,1358380800,,126,4.9523809523809526
5090492,5,B007J3ISK0,Santa got this for my 4 year old. Love the little skits n flashing from concert to other stuff. The documentary at the end was very good. I don't care if u make fun of the wiggles but these guys worked very hard to get where they r now. Three out 4 kids adore the wiggles growing up so I applaud them. Bands come n go but the wiggles have been around for 20 plus years!,1357084800,,369,3.8684210526315788

5090494,5,B007J3ISK0,"I guess if you know what this is, it's not so bad, although I still wouldn't have bought it. It's kind of a patchwork DVD, with 2/3 of it being a live concert performance, which my 2 year-old is not overly interested in, without the fun effects and music and camera angles of the traditional Wiggles DVDs. The rest is comprised of short 1-or-2 minute skits, which are fun but too short, and general things like bloopers. All fine, if not terribly polished, but, again...I can't say my toddler is as enraptured with it as he is with the other Wiggles material. We still love the Wiggles around here, but if I were you I'd grab another of their DVDs.

DECEMBER 2012 POSTSCRIPT: I was totally wrong. My toddler loves this DVD, so I've made it a five-star review. The fact that the program is kind of haphazard turns out to be a plus, what with the whole short attention span thing. He is enthralled every time he watches. So I will amend my earlier statement and say DO buy this DVD, you'll be glad you did. And the accompanying documentary about the history of the Wiggles is very interesting, too, but not for the kids. I don't mean there's anything they shouldn't see, it's just not very interesting for little ones.",1349049600,5,1216,4.4774774774774775
5090495,5,B007J3ISK0,"Quality DVD and all children enjoy the Wiggles especially when they are celebrating birthday time.

5090497,5,B007J3ISK0,One of the better DVDs my kid likes to watch over and over again. This one has a variety of live performances and skits.,1346198400,2,120,4.041666666666667
5090498,5,B007J3ISK0,"Played it as soon as we received it and my daughter loved it. It shows wiggles in concert singing and dancing to their tunes, yes it has songs we have already heard with other dvds but my daughter loved it, and I also found entertaining. This dvd has a special documentary on how the Wiggles started untill Sam joined. If you and kiddies are wiggles fans you will enjoy this dvd.",1444348800,,379,4.352112676056338

5090508,4,B007J3ISK0,"The best Wiggles dvd we ever bought!  Not only is it the longest we've ever owned, but it has bloopers from other videos,  joke time and concert footage. It's great! My daughter has gotten used to Sam and this one is great fun! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the last few dvds I have purchased,  don't automatically play. They will sit on the menu forever unless you hit play. I believe all children dvds should have auto play. The older Wiggles dvds had auto play",1421884800,,488,4.34065934065934

5090516,3,B007J3ISK0,"Most of this DVD is from a live show. As in my other reviews for the Wiggles DVDs, the live action does not capture the attention of my 16 month olds as much as the earlier DVDs do (Yummy Yummy, Wiggle Time, Toot Toot) ones do. My kids do not have a problem with any of the new Wiggles (like Sam,Emma, Lachy, or Simon), but the sets aren't as colorful and part of the magic of the Wiggles is gone when they do the live shows (my boys like the close ups of their faces, the cheap but vibrant backgrounds, the simple songs and motions, and they don't pay attention to the transition/talking segments in this DVD.) As and adult, I did enjoy the bloopers they cut in. We purchased this DVD though because we are pretty much going to have every Wiggle DVD whether they are good or bad. I rated this three stars not because I felt it was an average DVD, but because the live shows are just not for my kids at this stage.",1401148800,,914,4.140449438202247
5090517,5,B007J3ISK0,These are movies for my son . He Loves them all and watches them all the time . Very Nice,1395532800,,89,3.5

Great fun.",1385251200,,114,4.75
5090521,5,B007J3ISK0,"My little brother enjoys any DVD made by the wiggles so of course, he loved this! I also don't mind listening to their music. I find their songs catchy and sometimes, I dance alongside my little brother. It was worth it:)",1380758400,,221,4.414634146341464
5090522,5,B007J3ISK0,"I bought this for my 3 yr. old nephew's birthday and I was surprised that he was not all into it like the other Wiggles DVD's; HOWEVER, my 10 yr. old nephew LOVES it. Perhaps it's because it's a live show or because the spoof parts go right over the 3 yr. old's head. But I think it also has to do with the fact that it has a big Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star segment and he really HATES that song, lol.
But it definitely keeps the 10 yr. old entertained for quite some time :).",1373414400,,478,3.9895833333333335
5090523,5,B007J3ISK0,"As usualy the Wiggles dvd was very good and the kids loved it.  The ONLY problem, if it can be called that is that it is over two hours long...In the future we will split the time in half watching it..an hour one night ..and then rest the next.. It's just kind of long for the 4 year old to sit through...BUT they do have 20 years of stuff to put in..Otherwise its worth getting.",1364169600,,379,4.053333333333334
5090524,5,B007J3ISK0,My kids are really into the Wiggles and loved this DVD.  They actually ened up reenacting some of the scenes.  The DVD is full of action and their classic songs.,1363910400,,161,4.333333333333333
5090525,5,B007J3ISK0,I used to think the Wiggles were a bit creepy. I first watched them on Spout TV.  Now my son loves them.  They beat out everything...Every other cartoon and show. This is my fourth Wiggles DVD and every one has been great. I see they had a Six Flags section of the park in New England that is no longer there.  That would have been great to see.,1362528000,,345,4.044117647058823
