8757408,5,B01DZK1NW0,"Possibly one of the more under-rated tropish-type ecchi animes out there.  Yes it fulfills all the cliches the 'machine' cranks out lately, but it does it well.  It also has a VERY intense and intricate backstory and plot if you can just stomach the tsundare-bulIshlt long enough and you don't take Claire's ""you're my slave spirit!"" seriously.  While we are repulsed by her brief fixation with the whole thing, my girlfriend, who is native to Japan, explained that it's actually a gag that even Claire didn't take seriously, but I have seen that joke alone ruin people's entire experience with the show.

The LNs are still being worked on and reveal the true reason why Bladedance of the Elementaler is a worthy entry into the 'cliche anime done right' sequence of things.  Sadly I don't believe we will ever see a season 2, and the 'complete TV series' only covers up to Vol. 3-4 of the LN's which, obviously, is arguably the dullest.  Give it some attention, the Ren Ashbell arc is absolutely fantastic as far as I'm concerned, and I'm a huge anime critic, primarily on more mature-themed content, but I've always been a sucker for great voice acting, which this showcases nicely.",1464652800,,1183,4.7745098039215685
