8675691,1,B00N1JQ1EQ,"So. Bad.

I kept waiting for the cliches to reveal themselves as intentional. No, I think they were actually being serious. I thought, 'well maybe the fights will have some degree of realism'. Nope - one second they're pulling punches and falling all over themselves, the next a single kick sends our protagonist flying through the air as if on...gasp...wires.

It was as if they took every cliche from every martial arts movie EVER, disjointedly jumbled them all into one script, and decided what they had was not, in fact, a comedy, but a serious action film.

And the kid. The kid thing freaked me out. You don't haul your infant son around the globe whilst pursuing your blood quest, handing him off to any convenient Thai passersby so you can capoiera to the death with some dude named ""Yo."" And this is just one for instance; don't get me started on the tree ghost scene with Yao Mings Cambodian cousin Yak. Or Chernobyl. Who brings a baby to Chernobyl?! No. Nope. Uh-Uh.

Bad dialog. Poor plot. Trite premise. Worse acting. Icing on the cake: they tried to frame the scenes uniquely and shoot from odd angles, but it didn't work. In fact it irritated me about as much as the less-than-lackluster acting.

Pros:
So these guys seemed to have some stunt and/or martial arts experience. There was SOME fight choreography.
Also, the animated cut scenes were pretty well done and proved to be effective and likely economical segues.",1425340800,,1433,4.738955823293173
8675692,1,B00N1JQ1EQ,"The film starts out showing us the honorable profession of assassination. However when our Shadow Warriors are told to kill a family, Sam (Don Ferguson who also wrote this) balks and kills another assassin to save the family. Of course after stabbing the guy in the back and shooting him 9 times in the torso, he can only be stopped by choking.

Sam runs to Northern Thailand where he meets a monk, gets a sword, and a girl...has a son, see DVD cover. Of course the bad guys come back for revenge and they only run Sam through with a sword, I mean all the way through with about 2 feet of blade out the back. This slows him up for a scene as he takes his kid with him, or not, to kill the other assassins who for some reason don't hang out anywhere together, but are all around the globe.

Don Ferguson can't act and made sure no one in the film would show him up. He also can't write a script.

8675693,1,B00N1JQ1EQ,"This is one the worst movies I've watched. The script is full of cliches from other moves. The choreographer for the fight scenes are impossible for even a five year old to believe, let alone an adult. The actors were incredible horrible, when they spoke it was like they were reading the words from a dialogue monitor (all the actors did not know how to act, no expression what-so-ever). I could not watch the video, I had to stop it. The video was putting me to sleep!!!!!",1417564800,,474,4.459770114942529
