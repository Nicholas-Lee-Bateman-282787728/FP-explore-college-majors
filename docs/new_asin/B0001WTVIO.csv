2034205,1,B0001WTVIO,It came with ripped cover and it seemed to be a pirated version. Not a good picture and ran like it was copied from the TV.,1374019200,,123,3.769230769230769
2034206,4,B0001WTVIO,"This was clearly made to be fun and nothing more. It IS light and funny. It has a beautiful young woman and a familiar (and still good looking) older woman playing her mother. Gloria Stuart,  well-known to anyone who has seen films of the 30's, appears as the grandmother. Her role is brief but I enjoyed the presence of someone who was around when movies were still learning to talk.... even if she was never a Star.
The story involves CIA agents and sellers of germ warfare chemicals. Not in the same league as Hamlet or Othello, the plot works adequately to give the ladies a chance to show themselves to advantage while kicking around the Bad Guys. The Good Guys, like the Bad Guys, are there only as foils for the Gals.
If you are in the mood for a nice, no social significance, movie to brighten up 90 minutes, this should do the trick.",1356307200,,842,4.397435897435898

2034208,2,B0001WTVIO,"This movie is cute, definitely a TV movie.  The story is sort of infantile, not really believable.  But it's fun, and I think kids would like it OK.  Go see RSTC or Spy Kids, though, if you want something a bit more fun.",1172707200,,220,4.069767441860465
2034209,5,B0001WTVIO,"Always missing important events in her child's life leaves Gloria Shaeffer (Dyan Cannon, former wife of Cary Grant) estranged from her daughter Alison Shaeffer (Jayne Brook). Despite the befuddled appearance, Gloria is actuality, as the movie title reveals, a spy. As a gift, Grandma (Gloria Stuart: Old Rose in Titanic) instigates a Bahama vacation for mother and daughter. Cancellation causes Alison to search out her mother in the middle of an undercover assignment. Alison accidently compromises her mother's cover, causing Gloria to be kidnapped. After agent Gary Sutton (Kevin Kilner) breaks the news to Alison, she attempts a rescue by allowing herself also to be captured.

Mother and daughter constantly exchange well-timed quips. In fact, everyone in company with Alison becomes a situation comedy. Her boyfriend Peter (Garwin Sanford), wants to ask Alison something that will 'forever change their future.' When villain Gustavo Vasquez (David Palffy) becomes attracted to Alison, she feigns reciprocal adoration in a protracted ruse while waiting for his drugged drink to take effect. Alison appears to go beyond the call of duty while her shocked mother looks on through a window.

Because this is a made-for-television movie, resolution is not as sharp as one would expect from a DVD. Packaging is minimal and there are no extras. Nevertheless, the humorous intrigue is quite entertaining. I've paid much more for far less entertainment. What a bargain!

Movie quote: Gloria: ""Did you wear that to the meeting?"" Alison: ""Yea."" Gloria: ""Your hair looks nice.""",1167177600,,1571,5.378048780487805
2034210,5,B0001WTVIO,"This is one of my favorite all time movies. It perfectly mixes action, comedy & a pinch of romance. It has a great story and the actors are very good.

Don't be scared away by the price. This awesome made for TV movie is worth every penny!!!",1111536000,8,241,4.127659574468085
2034211,5,B0001WTVIO,"My Mother the Spy is a highly entertaining TV-Movie from 2000 that is very well done.

Jayne Brook (Chicago Hope) plays Alison Shaeffer, a book editor who has always wondered why her mother Gloria (Dyan Cannon of Ally McBeal) has never ""been there for her"" growing up.  Well, it turns out Gloria is a CIA agent who hides her job from her daughter to protect her from it.  Alison's grandmother (Gloria Stuart of Titanic fame) is always there to make excuses for her daughter's unexpected trips across the world.  Finally one day, after Gloria and Alison plan a vacation to the Bahamas together that doesn't pan out, Alison gets tangled up in a web of mystery and ends up finding out her mother's secret and teaming up with her to stop a wealthy criminal mastermind from selling anthrax to the highest bidder.  Lots of excitement ensues: cat and mouse chases, gunfights, kidnappings, and more.  Alison is a fish out of water with all these adventures and her witty remarks about situations always keep a smile on your face while you are on the edge of your seat.

The DVD of My Mother the Spy features the original full-screen presentation of the movie and no special features except scene selection.  The transfer of the video and audio are top-notch, however and with it's low price it is a must see for anyone looking for a fun and exciting film!",1106438400,9,1347,4.630252100840337

2034224,5,B0001WTVIO,"A fun movie. Sometimes you just need fun, and this movie has it. No swearing, nothing inappropriate, just fun. Jayne Brook is wonderful. She plays a book editor. She's bright, brainy, and beautiful. She doesn't know her mother is a spy and suddenly finds herself helping her mother's partner rescue her from kidnappers. One of my favorite lines from this movie is when Jayne is listing books by a famous author, whom the CIA agent has never herd of: ""Doesn't anybody read at the CIA!?"" Luckily Jayne reads, because her vast knowledge from reading so many books saves their butts many times.",1467158400,3,590,4.794117647058823

8016987,4,B0001WTVIO,"This movie is charming and funny (though quite unrealistic in a lot of ways). The only thing that bothered me about this (and this is something that though it is a small detail, it's one which seems to be a trend in spy movies and novels) is that the CIA spies called themselves ""agents"", and there aren't any agents in the CIA; there are FBI Agents and CIA Operatives and they're very different.",1520467200,2,396,4.438356164383562
8016988,5,B0001WTVIO,"The dialogue was very well done for the daughter. It was a lot of fun to listen to her ""seduction"" scenes where she outwits the bad guy. As someone else said the plastic surgery/botox on the actress that plays the Mom/CIA agent (who's partial badge says bureau of investigation) is fairly off putting. Look her up now she looks like the singer Steven Tyler. Anyway a very fun movie, even my husband watched!",1519344000,,407,4.589041095890411
