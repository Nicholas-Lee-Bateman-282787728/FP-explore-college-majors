5685987,5,B00C2535TE,"I'm not Canadian but am a huge lover of WWII films and see them all and own most (I bought this on Amazon sight unseen). 'Storming Juno' is a great small budget movie about the Canadian forces on D-Day attacking Juno Beach which was there assignment. The first 3/4 of this film follows the exploits of 3 soldiers on D-Day; a paratrooper, an infantry Officer, and a Sherman Tank crew. The battle scenes for all 3 characters and their units are very well done. The scenes are not 'graphic' like Saving Private Ryan but they are sharp, authentic and believable. This is not a film where a Canadian soldier fires 3 rounds--and 9 German soldiers fall down--its done much better than that as I said. It does come as a bit of a surprise when the 3 segments of the men in battle end rather abruptly at around 45 minutes and the current day veterans (including some Germans) are interviewed. The vets from D-Day are very moving in their description of what happened on D-Day--just like the vets in Band of Brothers were. Hearing how they are all still effected emotionally by events occurring more than 60 yrs ago, will leave you proud an grateful for what all the soldiers on June 6th accomplished. I'm happy to say this film will go in my WWII collection and be recommended to others.",1365465600,6,1277,4.532467532467533
5685988,5,B00C2535TE,"I was anxious to see this film, my late father having served in 420 squadron, RCAF. However, whenever I purchase films on the topic of war, especially those written by Canadian or European film makers, I tread very cautiously, being aware of the rampant anti-military sentiment among the film communities in those countries. However, my misgivings were not warranted. The film is a just celebration of the courage of, not only Canadians who served, but of all allied soldiers who joined to fight the fascism of the 20th century. Canada's veterans, those few WW2 vets remaining (I lost my father last year at 92), deserve to be revered and respected as ""heroes"". The story follows three soldiers, a member of Canada's Airborne regiment, a commander of a Sherman tank and an infantryman. The action is taught, the dialogue (though stiff at times) is acceptable and the equipment/technology accurate for the period. Stens, Lee Enfields and Tommy guns for the Canadians and accurate portrayals of German weaponry and uniforms. I was pleased to see that they got the Canadian helmets right (Canadians wore distinctive helmets, slightly different from the British, at Normandy for the first time). They also got the airborne equipment right. My only quibble in this respect was the aircraft which delivered the troops (some modified version of a B25 bomber). They should have got it correct (either a Dakota or Halifax - since it was all CGI anyway, they could have gotten that right). The film is a fitting tribute to those who fought in the Normandy campaign - Canada having not been given nearly as much credit as it deserved. God bless the veterans for saving the world and congratulations to the film makers for making such a moving tribute. This film should be seen by anyone interested in history, western heritage and those interested particularly in the war against fascism, either during World War 2 or the current struggle where Canadians, Americans and Brits serve side by side.",1312156800,152,1984,4.978915662650603
5685989,5,B00C2535TE,"As a Canadian I am thrilled that we have some stories from the Canadian perspective on World War II...
The film is three different Canadian soldier stories connected on one day in history, D-Day, and the efforts of our Canadian troops in securing Juno beach, as part of five areas to be secured on that fateful day.  We have the perspective from a paratrooper, a tank officer and a foot soldier.  After seeing the intense battle on the beach in Saving Private Ryan some years ago, the scene on the beach in this movie wasn't as 'polished' but found that my emotions were in tatters as it became all the more personal.  I never forget our young soldiers sacrifices, and to see the same effect on these soldiers trying to land on the beach, and being cut down is heartbreaking.  There are the few that manage to make it through, and the beach gets secured. If I remember correctly, out of one group of 110 men, 17 survived, and out of many tanks that were made to float from two miles away at sea, one managed to make it to the beach.  The paratrooper manages to find his squad after a delay, and they must find a way to take the big gun out before more troops land.  The story is true, and their mission is accomplished.  We see the real survivors of WW II talk about their experience as the film ends.  This film brings our history to life, with class and with a Canadian take on our contribution to the war effort.  As gripping,  but with an honest, simple telling of wars horrors.",1306281600,89,1482,4.356363636363636

I enjoyed the movie/doco. However, it left me feeling a little empty and unfulfilled as if they couldn't get any deeper into the personal lives and view points of the soldiers depicted. It also skipped around a lot and attempted to interweave the same old film blocks. Meh. Worth watching, but don't get your expectations too high.",1501632000,,574,4.693069306930693

5685996,3,B00C2535TE,"Right from the opening credits this ""film"" seemed disjointed. After watching it a bit more I realized this is a collection of a series of short docudramas depicting a part of what Canadian forces experienced on D-Day, spliced together to run for 80+ minutes. While the production is reasonably well done, there is high reliance on actual war footage, which adds some authenticity, but also acts a filler, and a story line that is basically given to us through voice over narration.

I was expecting a traditional dramatic film with a well defined plot and story line, as well as full character development. This is not that. I watched the whole thing, and it was okay, but not what I was expecting",1496793600,3,697,4.713114754098361

 Product worth the price - Yes, a excellent value and a DVD worth keeping.
  The recreation of the situation with the use of old film clips and CGI works well since they only had a budget for renting one Sherman tank.  They used a beach in eastern Canada and reconstructed their own obstacles making them similar to the hedgehogs and ramps (although they appeared a bit small) that were present on the invasion beach.  The reconstruction of a German anti-tank bunker flanking the beach looks authentic although the machine gun bunker does not appear as a standard German model.  The stories of men from three different units are based on real events although with typical modifications for a film version.  Those who loved saving Private Ryan are thrilled with the historical recreation, but ignore the fact the story was fiction and that no armed patrol was sent from Omaha Beach to find a single paratrooper who landed behind UTah each.  In the case of ""Private Ryan"" a chaplain was sent to find him.  This film does not distort history to that degree and sticks closer to what actually happened based on individual accounts making it more like the older film The Longest Day, but without as huge cast and extras.  One problem with the film is that they leave the viewer with the impression the Canadian paratroopers landed behind Juno Beach.  The Canadian/British airborne operation had nothing to do with Juno beach and was east of the Orne River on to secure a crossing of that river and block German reinforcements coming from the east to attack the flank of the British beaches of Gold and Sword which were east of Juno.  The Canadian airborne attack on the town of Varaville is reduced in scale, but again it sticks to the event and is the characters, like on the Juno landing, are real people not fictional.  The film closes with about 20 minutes of some of the people depicted in the film and other veterans giving their own version of their experiences.
  The film is a bargain and a great film presentation of the Canadians at D Day.  It is not as graphic as Saving Private Ryan or the Zombie movies so it is suitable for young adults. Highly recommended.",1452729600,,2489,4.607709750566894
5686032,1,B00C2535TE,"A great story deserving of a bigger budget.  They might as well have skipped the landing scene and just said it happened, as horrible as it was.

5686069,5,B00C2535TE,"This is a very good production that was half movie, half documentary, which consisted of interviews conducted with the surviving Canadian soldiers who landed at Juno Beach in the Normandy invasion in June 1944.

There are 3 different groups that are followed here:  one group of Canadian paratroopers who landed behind the lines and had to take out a large artillery piece that was targeted on Juno Beach.  Another was a Sherman tank crew that rides their tank through the rough waves; these tanks were closed in with canvas walls that kept the water out poorly -- most of them sank.  Theirs was the only tank in their unit to make it shore.  The last group were the infantry who waded to shore, took a lot of casualties early on, but managed (with help of that tank) to take and secure the beach.

There are other movies and documentaries about the Normandy landings, but this is the first I've seen of the Canadians' contribution.  They met heavy resistance initially but did manage to break through and push inland.

I've read a fair amount about World War II but not so much about the Normandy landings and none about the Canadians' contribution.  I learned a lot from this movie.  There is a lot of information online, and I spent a few hours looking over some of it afterwards.  It was a very complex battle and there is still a lot of controversy over the how's and why's.

Be warned!  This is clearly a *made for television* program - one third of which is interviews with Canadian veterans of the D-Day invasions.  Amazon doesn't disclose this and charges the same for it that they do for feature films.  That is a questionable practice.  If you are in Canada, you will probably have another chance to see this on television too, the next time there is a reason to commemorate D-Day.

It is not... unwatchable.  In fact, the interviews at the end are probably the best part.  But from the point of view of narrative, story-telling, acting, rounded characters, cinematography, special effects, and editing... This is very much lacking!!

Look, guys, it is great that the story of the Canadian landing at Juno gets this air-time, but I would think those of you who want Canada to get its own time in the commemorative sun (if you will), would have some standards and not be so easily satisfied.

5686147,2,B00C2535TE,"Sick & Stupid Score: 0/5*

This film is not a first-run feature movie, as the synopsis seems to imply.  Rather, this is a made-for-TV docudrama with the ads cut out.  Made for Canadian TV, actually.  The movie was essentially financed by Canadian government entities and Canadian non-profit organizations.  Put another way, it is a public-private financed movie and was probably shown free on Canadian TV.

Amazon should not be charging its customers to view this movie.

As for the story itself, it is the same old WWII D-day story but told from a strictly Canadian perspective, i.e., with a singular focus on the Canadian troops assigned to the beachhead called Juno.  For viewers familiar with the June 1944 landing, the story really contains nothing new.  That would also include the interviews with broken-down, weepy veterans that is attached to the last ten minutes of the film.

There was a heavy hand of voice over that was monotone and lackluster.  It seems to me if you didn't have the money to spend, why not go with a much smaller personal story that wouldn't have needed to be stitched together so haphazardly.  The script was amateurish.  I groaned a few times when the story ""jumped the shark"".

The intense fighting on Omaha and Utah generally garner the most attention in any film about D-Day.

Juno was just as strongly defended as the beaches on which the Americans landed and presented the Canadians with as diverse a set of challenges as those experienced by the Americans.  The Canadians pressed the attack and broke through the stubborn German defense.

The veterans give candid accounts and are not afraid to express their true feelings about that very important day.
It followed a story line and what I enjoyed most was the candid accounts of vets who participated.  It was exceptionally well done.  Of course, we Americans know the Canadians had a very minor role in D-Day.--  just kidding.  It was a real eye opener.  To those men who are still alive:  ""Thank you for your service and your sacrifice."" On D-Day I was an American baby about a week old and I am one of many you fought for.  Thank you.",1382227200,,736,4.352941176470588

5686163,5,B00C2535TE,"I was a little apprehensive about renting this, but went ahead as it would fill some time.  It was a really great movie and for me, told from a fully different perspective - the Canadians.  We all talk about how the US won the war, but we tend to forget, we had many allies storming ashored on June 6th, 1944. . . . Americans, British and Canadians.  I really came to appreciate the subtle differences, yet at times, marked differences in how they went about their duties.  Told from three soldiers in three different combat arms (airborne, infantry and armor)but all Canadian.  The best part was at the end when survivors spoke about their experiences, much as was done in the TV series, Band Of Brothers.  I recommend this for any war buff to see history from a different perspective.",1380931200,7,786,4.578571428571428

The vet interviews at the end would have been good by themselves, but because they included them in this movie, I felt it just made the vets look like they were exaggerating their experiences.  This movie should be free as part of Amazon Prime.  Don't waste you $4 renting this.",1378598400,,519,4.431578947368421
5686168,5,B00C2535TE,"Veteran interviews, script reenacting actual soldiers experience at Juno, along with lots of archival footage ( few seconds of well known Omaho Beach is not needed & does a disservice to the Canadians whose footage can stand on its own.
Comparisons to Band of Brothers, a mini series, are unfair. Comparisons to Saving Private Ryan are also unfair. Runtime is less, & SPR did not include veteran interviews or archival footage.
It was enjoyable, I learned something , & my interest has been peaked.
The veteran interviews interspersed with actual footage is very well done; Same can be said for the archival footage being used during the telling of actual soldiers experiences.
Unlike SPR which has some very graphic & realistic scenes & footage making it unsuitable for young children, Remembering Juno does not, yet it does not portray the action as a Saturday stroll in the park.
Overall, well done- we learned of the Canadian's role, thus sparking an interest to learn more by reading veteran's accounts or viewing more veteran interviews or documentaries that can dig deeper.
I will add this to my library.",1378512000,,1111,4.978494623655914

But If you need a good historical military action fix, you could worse than this one.  Maybe even a lot worse.  The acting is good, the scripting is good, the stories are good, and so on.  Juno beach is ignored before now and its a good war story, how some beaches were much more heavily defended that others.  The Canadian contribution to D-Day is worth seeing, feeling and remembering.  Storming Juno delivers.",1377820800,,520,4.5978260869565215
5686170,2,B00C2535TE,"If you want to make a movie to honor the men who fought on D-Day, you need more than one landing craft one tank and one machine gun nest.  The actors were terrible, the set was terrible, the whole thing was terribly bad!!  What a dishonor to those brave men!  And how can anyone rate this movie with 4 or 5 stars!

 If you want to see a movie that shows the true cost of D-Day, watch Saving Private Ryan.  If you can't afford to make a movie with at least 3 landing crafts or with trick camera action to make it look like you have more than one, then don't waste what little money you have making a crap movie.  Not to mention the fact that you want other people to spent their hard earned money on you high school movie production.  If you look at this movie, evidently the Canadians took the beach with about two dozen guys (if that many), and one tank.

I don't normally rate stuff it has to be really bad and I want to warn others to steer away.  I am a advade war movie collector and have movies made all over the world.  This rates as one of the worst.  I don't think every production is going to rate with the likes of Saving Private Ryan, there have been plenty low budget war films that were good even without a high budget.  This film isn't one of them!!

The best part of the movie was the Documentery part at the end.  If they had just done that I would give it 5 stars!",1377648000,38,1382,4.047970479704797

This film deals withh the Canadian landing on Juno beach. As with all the forces casualties were great in number . The Canadian landing force were up against a huge resistance force that wasn't expected. Given this the.casualties.were.great and they still were able to achieve their planned goal. And ahead of schedule.

5686176,3,B00C2535TE,"I was curious about this film, so I bought it. You don't hear much about the Canadian participation in WW2, especially modern telling of the account. Outside of 49th Parallel  and Darby's Rangers, you just don't. But I knew of the Canadian involvement during D-Day and wanted to see just how accurate it would be.

Told by the narration of a single person, you are told the stories from a Paratrooper, a tank soldier and infantryman during that infamous day. The action is good, uniforms and weapons mostly correct (the German Pak-75s weren't proper at the muzzle brake) and the Sherman a later mark than the early M-4s the Canadians used, unless they wanted to represent a Firefly Sherman. At least it was a Sherman, not a M-48 or M-24 so commonly featured.

You still can't help but wonder what happened that day. Intermixed with actual footage shot at Normandy and recreation, its a well seamed mix. But the acting seemed a tad labored and off with some of the actors. The effects are rather well done, CGI is your friend!!

After the film is over, there is interviews with actual Canadian veterans , telling their experiences of the war. This to me was the better part of the DVD.  It reminds me of watching Band of Brothers, showing the real men featured in the series with interviews.

If I could, I would more rate this 3.5 stars. I liked it, but can't say I really loved it , but, honestly, I am glad I bought it.",1375056000,2,1421,4.509727626459144
