4308573,5,B004AE5534,"I bought all three Pilates for Men for my husband. I have been doing pilates for years and know the great benefits from this workout. My husband is 6' 5"", 275 lbs., 47 yo and a former college football player. He has successfully recovered from neck surgery, a stroke and recently knee surgery so he needed a kinder, gentler workout to stay in shape. We just did the mat workout and I think any man would like this.
There is nothing feminine about this workout. The background music is guitar/drums, the guys doing the advanced and beginner moves are just regular guys, and the best thing is there is very little of the usual annoying talk/chatter that some exercise leaders do during a workout. But you do have the option to turn all talking off. The advanced moves are very challenging so it's a dvd we can do together and we both get a good workout. The only negative is there isn't a warm up and I think they could spend a little more time talking about the position of the spine during the work out. Anyone who has done a lot of pilates classes will notice this is missing. But there is a ""safety"" section that can be viewed before the workout. I will review the ball and band dvd's after we do those.",1313971200,18,1205,4.36

8420147,5,B004AE5534,My favorite of the DVD - because for me this is classic Pilates.  It's also good to try DVD 1 and then DVD 2 in my opinion (in one sitting) as DVD 1 works the Core and DVD 2 emphasizes upper body as well as core....,1438819200,,215,3.6739130434782608

8420149,3,B004AE5534,"A handsomely made video with a strong plug for the studio behind it (and why not?), the information is spread out across three access points. During the main practice section it would be very helpful to have some of the info contained in the other sections, but you have to have the entire video under wraps in order to take advantage of it. Reviewing the entire video before beginning the work is probably not a bad idea, but having its fine points at fingertips, in particular for a beginner, is problematic. The info is there, but extra time is required to put it all together. Also, there are 2 other videos which the viewer is requested to have in order to switch between routines and get full advantage of the program. That didn't really seem necessary when a more integrated beginner--intermediate--advanced set of steps would have been better focused and more practical. All in all, good info that could have been presented more efficiently. The models are obviously advanced practitioners and the benefits of the practice, I assume these programs in particular, are well stated by their presentation.",1432425600,,1109,4.904255319148936

Not much chatter, and you feel progress as you do the workouts and get to a higher level. good for couples as the guys stay interested.",1417737600,,273,4.269230769230769

8420153,5,B004AE5534,"A workout DVD that is especially designed to strengthen a man's core, this workout is do-able and challenging all at the same time.  After just 6 workouts with this DVD my core is noticeable stronger, more toned, and my back aches are greatly relieved.  This DVD is so good I'm ordering the rest of the set!  LOVE IT!!",1388188800,5,318,4.448275862068965

8420155,5,B004AE5534,"This mat Pilates workout was actually a little easier than I thought it was going to be, but there were some difficult exercises such as teaser and swimming.  Give this a try, this is doable and short and it adds variety to your exercise regimen.  Joshua Smith instructs and demonstrates, along with another gentleman who shows the advanced versions.  No equipment is needed except maybe a mat.
