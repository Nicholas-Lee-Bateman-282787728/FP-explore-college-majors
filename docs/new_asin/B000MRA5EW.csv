8171224,3,B000MRA5EW,"Sensitive New Age Killer (S.N.A.K) is a classic little film. Director Mark Savage has created a dark,weird little world with some very sick, twisted characters. Highlights for me were Frank Bren as ""the Snake"" and Kevin Hopkins as ""George"", both of which had me in fits of laughter with their demented antics and equally sick dialogue.

Some great action too in the style of early John Woo, especially a shootout early in the piece in an old abandoned train carriage. Very nice indeed.",1178064000,2,485,4.843373493975903
