7929317,2,B000051S69,"Couple of decent performances, but ""the best of"" is a tighter stretch than a worn leotard.  About this time was when female skaters started paying more attention to ""How little can I wear"" as opposed to ""How gracefully can I skate?""  Message to figure skaters of both genders: We already consider your outfits sprayed on. Skating with class impresses most fans far more than skating wearing crass (or showing...you get the idea.)

I watch figure skating under duress: As a red-blooded American male, it's on my list of ""Things To Avoid Whenever Possible"". Watching this requires persuasion on the part of my wife- or the promise of a movie involving car chases, over-dynamited explosions and Chuck Norris jokes. So as a former hockey player who was forced by his coach (along with the rest of the team) to endure six weeks of figure skating, if I'm going to watch the stuff, I expect it to be FREAKIN' GREAT. Brian Orser. Katarina deWitt. That girl who is the REASON skaters are now limited in the amount of jumps they're allowed- because she was like Tigger on pogo-skates: A double or triple something every couple of seconds.  See, now THAT'S what guys want to see: Someone willing to risk falling on their butt- and heck, we'll applaud if a gutsy lady (or guy- hey, wipeouts are funny on ice, no matter what your sex!) pulls off something where you're thinking, ""They're gonna fall, they're gonna fall, they're gonna....how did she do that?""

But this one falls flat. We have several (hey, I adore my wife- it's part of being a husband) figure skating VHS tapes of yore, and of all the prancing, flouncing and annoying Eighties fashion blunders through which I've suffered, this is by far the WORST.  I appreciate Michelle Kwan's ability, and cheered for her throughout the Olympics...whenever I wasn't sitting around watching hockey, throwing Doritos at the screen and wondering whether I could meet the ref in a dark alley while holding some kind of blunt instrument (a clarinet for preference....beginners learning that one are MURDER).  But agonizing through Kristi Yamaguchi in what appeared to be a near-satanic combination of Mickey Mouse, Michael Jackson and Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band could not be made up for- even watching ""RED"" and ""The Expendables"" back to back couldn't make up for that level of nerve-searing pain.

Buy something else. Like ""Lintballs For Dummies"". Or ""The Best Hairpieces of Don Cherry & Richard Simmons"". But this...this is a waste of a fan's time. Let alone the already-grudgingly given time of the fan's hubby!",1376870400,,2565,4.921296296296297

7929319,5,B000051S69,"Scott Hamilton (Olympic Gold medalist in '84), always a terrific showman, is the perfect host for these selections from the ""Stars on Ice"" tour, and treats us also to two of his performances, starting with ""Steppin Out"" (sung by Tony Bennett), and Scott's style and musicality are a joy to watch.
Kristi Yamaguchi ('92 Olympic Gold), with grace and beauty, follows with her lovely ""Madam Butterfly"".
Britain's Torvill and Dean ('84 Olympic Gold) perform my favorite selection, to the long version of the Dave Brubeck Quartet's ""Take 5"". The way they dance with the music is like as if they were a fifth instrument; it is glorious to watch, and pure artistry on ice.
Paul Wylie ('92 Olympic Silver) does a wonderful tribute to President Kennedy, to an excerpt from John Williams' film score for ""JFK"".
Two-time Olympic Gold winner ('84-'88) Katerina Witt dazzles with her self-assurance and winning smile with ""Man of la Mancha"" (sung by Linda Eder).
Four-time World champ Kurt Browning does ""Antares"" (music by The Tragically Hip), in what is the most technically complex piece on this tape, with very innovative choreography.
Gordeeva and Grinkov ('88-'94 Olympic Gold) are so romantic in Debussy's ""Reverie"". The love flows between them, and it is sad to note that Sergei Grinkov passed on in '95, at the age of 28.
Ekaterina continued in a solo career, and here does a piece to Gershwin's ""Three Preludes for Piano"". She is pretty and charming, but it is the perhaps the weakest selection on this tape.
Rosalynn Sumners ('84 Olympic Silver) is a true classic skating diva; strong, sensual and gorgeous, her performance of ""Beautiful Goodbye"" (sung by Amanda Marshall) is another favorite of mine.
Bechke and Petrov  ('92 Olympic Silver) are delightful, in a piece to traditional music, but are a little upstaged by some of the other performances.
The great Brian Orser (2 time Olympic Silver) does ""The Story of My Life"" by Neil Diamond, in a moving tribute to his mother; an excellent performance to a marvelous song.
Kristi Yamaguchi returns to do a comedic jazzy piece, and Hamilton finishes with the funny ""I Love Me"", as a lounge singer (sung by Larry Hart).
It is nice to see skaters perform sometimes without the pressure of a jury, and the constraints on the choreography that a competition demands; another good thing about this tape is the quality of the musical selections, which are very enjoyable. Skating aficionados will like all 54 minutes of this collection of ""Stars on Ice"".",1067385600,19,2496,4.942857142857143
7929320,5,B000051S69,"I never had the chance to see skating superstars performance live so I bought several tapes from Amazon. This one is the best. I was simply enchanted. The techniques, grace and beauty are simply breathtaking. Now my question is -- Where is volume 2?",994723200,6,249,4.681818181818182
7929321,5,B000051S69,"For figure skating enthusiasts, this is one of the best videos you're likely to find.  The ""Stars On Ice"" tour is-- for my money-- THE best skating show there is, and this video, ""Best of Stars on Ice, Volume I,"" is a compilation of the best of the best, beginning with the inimitable Scott Hamilton, who kicks off the festivities with a routine skated to ""Steppin' Out With My Baby.""  Hamilton then takes over as host of the show, and introduces the skaters with brief, but interesting ""bios"" as they begin their numbers.  First up after Hamilton is the charismatic Kristi Yamaguchi, skating to ""Madame Butterfly;"" she is followed by one of the best pair skating teams in the history of the sport, Torvill & Dean, who perform to ""Take Five.""  Then comes Paul Wylie, performing a routine from his first year with the tour, the dramatic ""JFK;"" and next is the lovely Katarina Witt, doing ""Man of LaMancha.""  Next is Kurt Browning, skating to the music of his favorite group, The Tragically Hip, with ""Antares,"" followed by one of the most memorable pairs teams ever, Gordeeva & Grinkov, who perform to DeBussy's ""Reverie.""  Ekaterina Gordeeva then goes solo, skating to ""Three Preludes for Piano.""  Brian Orser is up next with ""The Story of My Life,"" followed by the exquisite Rosalynn Summers, one of the original members of the cast, performing to ""Beautiful Goodbye.""  Pairs skaters Bechke & Petrov are next, with their interpretation of ""Joue Jusqu'an Matin.""  Yamaguchi then takes the ice again with an endearing performance of ""Doop.""  And finishing off the show, Scott Hamilton returns with one you're going to love and remember, a tribute to lounge lizards everywhere, the rousing ""I Love Me.""  For those who have been lucky enough to have seen ""Stars On Ice"" live-- or for those who haven't-- this video captures many of the magical moments that happened night after night, city after city, between the years 1993 and 1998, and will stand as a lasting tribute to the remarkable athletes whose artistry and love of their sport is showcased here, especially Scott Hamilton, who is hands down the greatest entertainer ever to have graced the ice.  For anyone who truly loves figure skating, this video is one that must be included in your library.",983145600,57,2252,4.851174934725848
