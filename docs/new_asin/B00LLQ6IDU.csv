6490403,5,B00LLQ6IDU,"I bought these to share for Christian Education at our Episcopal church.  We have only watched the first two episodes so far but they are excellent.  The videography is very professional, extremely well done compared to many other similar products.  The stories have lead to some wonderful discussions.  Even though we see all this as Christians it helps to appreciate the various faiths involved, makes us realize that all of us have so much in common.  If you are looking for fundamentalist bible-thumping video then this series is NOT for you.  In addition, Bruce Feiler, is a great narrator that is actually there instead of just reading a script in a studio.  You can feel the passion in his voice but at the same time he is so smooth to listen to, very pleasant.

I highly recommend this series and his ""Walking the Bible"" series that we watched earlier.",1425254400,6,860,4.724832214765101

6490408,5,B00LLQ6IDU,"Every year two hundred million people go on pilgrimage. They set out from ordinary and seek the extraordinary. In this six part series you will experience Lourdes_France, Jerusalem_Israel, Mecca_Saudi Arabia, Shikoku_Japan, Osogbo_Southern Nigeria and River Ganges in India, for the largest gathering of humanity on planet earth which takes place once every twelve years for over fifty days. Watching a Muslim weep while claiming; ""I truly was alone in a sea of five million"" and an American in Nigeria claiming; ""Although we left Africa many years ago, Africa never left us"", the lesson of this spectacular and educational documentary is that we all usually have the tendency to have compassion toward people, cultures, religions and beliefs that we know and understand but may not feel the same way toward the unknown. When we travel, experience, hopefully understand and relate to people so different from us, with different cultures, with different beliefs and religions then through knowledge we can get to a point where our sense of compassion can trump our sense of fear, unknown and ignorance for a peaceful life on this blue planet called Planet Earth.

This documentary allows some seekers to express their thoughts at times where they are as lost as any individual who may be questioning their beliefs and their faith for what is happening to them while seeking answers to their spiritual enlightening which certainly made me weep unexpectedly especially watching those disabled soldiers in so much physical and mental pain. Opening up to the suffering and support of others around us in a path to happiness with compassion and understanding allows us to educate ourselves to diminish any prejudice or assumption. A must see documentary. SIX great cultural and travel documentaries packed as one documentary, to watch and learn with your loved ones. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1418601600,29,1881,5.228476821192053

God and religion, and other cultures,but I'm disappointed that the menu doesn't have anything I can click on to access the links on this dvd!!  To view the city I WANT, I have to view all the footage BEFORE it.

This is an interesting show to watch, hence the three stars.......I took two stars off for reasons already mentioned.",1515196800,,372,4.36231884057971
