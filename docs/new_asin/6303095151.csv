561434,5,6303095151,"I have seen this movie many, many times.  No matter how often I see it, it remains an excellent tale of the Haudonshonia(Iroqouis)people. A people who's story needed to be told and Ted Turner did a fine job in doing so.",963792000,19,219,4.341463414634147
561435,5,6303095151,"This movie allows you into the lives and culture of these amazing people,mainly focusing on Joseph Brant following him from childhood to his days as a great war Chief fighting for the British in their war against the  colonists. It shows historical events with uncanny accuracy from the battle  of ticonderoga to the actual event that shatters the Iriquois nation. A  excellent companion piece to watch with The Last of the Mohicans. Pierce  Brosnan does a excellent job as Sir William Johnson as well.",943228800,51,502,4.940476190476191
561533,5,6303095151,I remember this movie.  It was a great visualization of the history of the Eastern seaboard in the 1700's.  I would buy this as quickly as it were made available.  Why isn't it?,1391904000,,177,4.303030303030303

561537,4,6303095151,"I am a huge fan of Eric Schweig so I may be a little partial to any of his flicks.  I did buy this movie from e-bay for my ERIC collection, (13 flicks total) AAH!! It wasn't bad for a TV flick.  What can you really show viewers in just a  one or two hour movie?  I think it showed how supporting the backstabbing British did the 6 nations in. Eric did a great job in his role and he's not too bad to look at either. LUV YA, ERIC! I think more flicks like this need to be made to show the truth in what the white man did to the Native population. From starving them, paying for indian scalps,shipping them to Florida ,to infecting them with smallpox on blankets. You can get farther in this world with peace and compassion than fear and ignorance.  PEACE  :)",1157068800,2,757,4.081081081081081
561538,3,6303095151,"Every group has its proverbial king David and Thayendenaga certainly lead a life that matches that of the Israilite king.

He was a modest man who did rise from common ranks to become a great leader. He did have his marital problems. He certainly shared the King's problems with his own offspring. Yet he managed to rise above these things to become a great leader of his people while at the same time made himself a civilized man.

Unfortunatly, this film fails to tell his story. Great costuming. Beutiful scenery and village settings. Authentic buildings. The plot was pathetic and often plodding in its work. Perhaps subject to political correctness's revisions, this film fails the man.

It failed to show he was a Christian. It failed to show he was compassionate and caring. It failed to show his activities as a Freemason. It failed to show in a place of great barbarity and depravity practiced on both sides, this man refused to be part of the evils of the times. Many colonials actually owe him their lives. This man was a gentleman but this film failed to show him despite his many actions.

Overall, good for visuallizing, a fair story but appears to have been partly done on the cheap.",1144800000,4,1198,4.690476190476191
561539,5,6303095151,"The Broken Chain is a masterpiece!!!

It is the most brilliant movie I've seen

in my entire life.

It should be reissued in the near future!!!

I hope to buy extra copies for friends who

are  interested in the Indian point of view.",1100304000,5,233,4.3023255813953485
561540,5,6303095151,"This piece is long overdue. Every western, period piece of the ""frontiers"" depicts the Native Americans as a threat, and a menace.
This piece dispells this myth. The Iroquois were people just trying to hang on to what they had. Between the French, British, and Colonists, they were stripped of land no one owned, pushed around by the people they helped, and forced into situations that they were not equippted to handle.
The Mohawk, Onodaga, Onieda, Cayuga, Seneca, and eventually the Tuscarora all wanted what was best for everyone. But due to poor advice, mostly from the British, they lost everything, including a government that was started long before the whites,
and quite a bit of which was used to form the Declaration of Independance.
Indians did not start out as threats and menaces, this movie shows why they were perceived that way. They only wanted what they believed was theirs. Wouldn't you do the same thing?",1066953600,36,924,4.89171974522293
561541,4,6303095151,"""Broken Chain"" is a decent made-for-cable movie essentially about the difficult decisions to be made by the Six Nations of the Iroqouis during the late 18th century as white settlers expanded into the New York frontier.  It also shows the complex and fragile relationship that existed between the native tribes and their English allies as the American colonies rose up in rebellion against the crown.  Symbolizing this relationship are two Mohawks, Thayendanega (Eric Schweig), the famous Iroqouis war chief known as Joseph Brandt who allied with the British during the Revolution and led a number of daring and bloody raids along the New York and Pennsylvania frontier, and his blood brother, Lohaheo, an intelligent and conflicted leader who tries in vain to keep his people neutral in the hope that it will preserve the Confederacy of the Six Nations and save the lives and land of his people in the face of total war.
After fighting against the French during the Seven Years War under the guidance of Sir William Johnson (Pierce Brosnan), an Englishman who genuinely admires the Iroquois, but who is only too eager to manipulate them for the purposes of the Crown, the Mohawks soon find themselves caught in the middle of the American Revolution, with both sides hoping to lure the powerful Confederacy to their cause.  While Lohaheo urges neutrality, Brant joins the Britsh and fights with great ferocity against the Americans at Oriskany and Wyomissing. The two must face an uncertain future for their people and struggle to save a way of life whose existence is threatened by the people with and against whom they fight.
This is a good stab at a movie that brings this period of our history to life and tells a story that is too often ignored, not just the history of the Eastern Frontier, but the important role played by the Six Nations in the history of America.",1043020800,65,1872,4.862068965517241
561542,4,6303095151,"""The Broken Chain"" portrays a time when the Six Nations of the Iroquois were struggling for their land and their very survival. Two brothers find themselves on opposite sides--one as tribal leader tries to preserve peace among the Confederation, and the other allies himself with the British, placing his trust in their protective power. Eric Schweig gives a well-rounded performance as Joseph Brandt, the brother who adopts British ways, only to bring his people to ruin. Buffy Sainte-Marie shines as the wise tribal matriarch who does her best to warn her people against the encroaching tide of dishonest white settlers. Pierce Brosnan hams it up as William Johnson, the white friend of the Indians in early years and later their betrayer.
The film is educational, though plodding at times. Worth watching to understand how much our American government owes to the Onondaga, Oneida, Mohawk, and other native peoples for its principles of democracy and equality.",1039046400,23,963,5.219354838709678

But VHS in this country is a dying thing, what makes it worst it that it can be had in Europe on DVD format but not here in the USA. I would like to know why there , they can get it in DVD format and not us, are we inferior. What is the problem? I have been told that if I want this movie in DVD I must buy a European plyer and adapter.  WHY?  I think that this movie is a #5, but the service is a #2 fast going on a # -1",1444262400,,473,3.411214953271028
