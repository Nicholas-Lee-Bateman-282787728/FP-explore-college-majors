8224043,4,B000WMF7RW,"I really enjoyed the movie the first time I saw it years ago on the Disney Channel
and was glad to find out it had been released on dvd. I recently purchased this movie along with the first movie, Lost in the Barrens. However I was a bit disappointed to discover that parts of the movie had been edited out for some reason. It's not really enough editing to even affect the length of the movie that much so I don't understand why this was done. But it's still a great film with beautiful scenery and a fun plot.",1294099200,,511,4.171717171717172
8224044,5,B000WMF7RW,"This movie is great, it'd be helpful if you've seen the first one, ""Lost In The Barrens"" but even if you haven't it's a good adventure tale. It's not as good as the books but nothing ever is.",1267660800,,191,4.052631578947368
