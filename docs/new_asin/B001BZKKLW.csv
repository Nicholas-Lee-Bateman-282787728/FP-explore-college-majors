8285356,5,B001BZKKLW,"Very innovative and creative solutions for grappling that you ""never"" see on UFC! Great hands on training that will help anyone wanting to dominate on the mat! Highly recommended.",1366588800,5,179,5.206896551724138
8285357,5,B001BZKKLW,I actually went to one of Gokor's clinics in 2008. He was a very nice guy and this video appears to be recordings of his clinics.  His techniques are very practical,1337731200,4,164,4.290322580645161
8285358,5,B001BZKKLW,"fantastic dvd set.  Mr. Chivichyan is an amazing instructor, clear, well-spoken (even with his accent), repeats things multiple times showing you where you might get caught up, shows different angles, then you get to see students in the seminar practicing the moves.  I had never head of this guy before, but then did some research and found out he is an amazing grappling master.  If you want to surprise people in your BJJ classes with some non-traditional BJJ moves, this is a great tool!  Or if you're just interested in learning some fantastically simple submissions that are quick & effective - this is for you.  Mr. Chivichyan is hilarious too!  You'll laugh as you learn his masterful style of grappling submissions.",1274659200,7,724,4.9421487603305785
