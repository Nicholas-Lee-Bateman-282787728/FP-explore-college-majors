6337843,3,B00J5S5QJ8,"To protect his young son who accidentally witnessed a murder, an ex-police detective Simon (Vincent Lindon) and his former partner Franck (Gilles Lellouche) take up arms against the gangsters trying to kill the boy.

Mea Culpa is a reasonably entertaining French action thriller with some familiar elements. Directed by Fred Cavay, known for his Pour elle (remade in USA as The Next Three Days) and  bout portant, the crime thriller benefits from the strong performances from the star Vincent Lindon and Gilles Lellouche, but is pretty disappointing because of the weak final act.

One of the most serious problems about the film is that the main story about protecting the boy is not as convincing as it should be. There are some convenient coincidences in the plot. The police are incredibly incompetent. Also, action set-pieces are competently done, but lack originality. Shoot-out on the train would have been much more effective, had it been done all on a running train.

Another complaint is the films narrative structure. Mea Culpa uses fragmentary flashbacks to suggest a tragic event that happened to Simon and Franck about six years before. Thus viewers are invited to reconstruct what changed their lives on a certain rainy day, which, unfortunately, is not as interesting as the director seems to think.

As a thriller Mea Culpa is decent, with its fast-paced story and some intense action scenes, but still is not as good as the same directors previous two films.",1414195200,2,1476,5.05761316872428

You're just along for the ride on this one enjoying a good action movie which has some great action sequences in it. All the actors nailed their parts, especially Lelouche and Lindon. Big Fan of them both.",1520121600,,286,4.415094339622642
8648470,4,B00J5S5QJ8,"Mea Culpa is a really fun movie. It relies more on well done execution of well worn ideas than it is trying to reinvent the wheel . In this case, it's a family in peril movie. The family just happens to involve cops instead of spies like Liam Neeson I'm a bad dad action movies. It doesn't get too much more complicated than that other than a bit of back story just to give the film some semblance of depth and add an emotional manipulation or 2.

It might sound run of the mill but it's not an issue because it's so well done you don't think about it while it's happening. The actors all play their parts well. Like many a French movie, France seems to be peppered with late middle aged people who are growing old gracefully. In this case, it's Vincent Lindon looking like a half man and half basset hound  hybrid that's been cast in a Michael Mann film circa Heat as the lead. Gilles Lellouche is his co-lead who plays the part like a French Bruce Willis type who still has his hair. They carry the movie well from scene to scene.

The director knows just how to frame them so that they seem capable but still likely to die terribly cause they're middle aged men taking on gangs of roving Albanian/Russian types. They're weirdly believable during the action sequences. The action sequences are frequent and well done thankfully helping serve the actors well.

The only problems with the movie is that it does occasionally make missteps. Some of the sub-plotting  is a little silly. Some of it is also completely dropped out of nowhere. Occasionally, they seem to want to make things a bit more morally murky in places it doesn't need to be. It's a mistake that they seem to understand as they seem to have dropped that stuff during editing or just chose to not focus on it. It's hard to show sympathy to drug running pimps who want to kill a 10 year old boy.

I really enjoyed the movie. It's the sort of film that doesn't really get made in America anymore. It's basically an action thriller made for adults. Sure, it's similar little boy macho silliness but it doesn't involve costumes with spandex or the unfortunate tendency of those films to want their heroes to be the villains. Instead, it makes up for it with something a lot more primal that is much more entertaining. despite not having a million explosions or in most people outside of France actors that you'll know.",1503705600,,2380,4.484988452655889

8648473,5,B00J5S5QJ8,Typically French thriller. The fights are realistic unlike these silly choreographed ones in US films. The story is compelling. The actors are credible and on point with the real people characters. Refreshingly well done. The little boy actor is adorable.,1446076800,,255,5.4

8648475,5,B00J5S5QJ8,"Vincent Lindon plays Simon who is an ex - police officer. Years ago he was dismissed from the gendarmes for causing a car accident whilst drunk. Since he was released from prison he has failed to reconnect with his estranged wife and ten year old son, It is as if a part of him died in the car crash too. He is now making a sort of living working for a security firm.

His old partner from the police - Franck (Gilles Lelouche) has stayed loyal to him, though Simon finds that hard to understand. Then a random incident puts the lives of Simon's son and wife in jeopardy. This turn of events brings the two friends back together to take on the bad guys and defend Simon's family.

The above is a simple synopsis and actually belies how well crafted this plot is. It is brilliantly directed and the actors are all excellent especially the main ones. It is both stylish and gritty at the same time. The tension is well ramped up and the mood is one that exemplifies the danger almost from the start. There is also a bull fight sequence here which may upset some people - so please take note. This is though a real edge of seat actioner that has a heart and a compelling story line - which makes it very easy to recommend this one.",1437868800,,1228,4.266094420600858
