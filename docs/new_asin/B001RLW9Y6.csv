3777048,1,B001RLW9Y6,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. I love watching the ufc, and after seeing all the fighters on the cover, i BOUGHT (please i beg forgivness) this movie. Make no mistake, i went into it thinking it wasn't gonna be much more than an action movie. It turned out to be much much less than that. As everyone else already said, lots of T & A, terrible writing, acting...etc. Not one redeemable quality to this movie. NOT ONE! I actually lost some respect for the fighters for appearing in this so-called movie. im just gonna tell myself that all proceeds went to some incredibly good charity so that i stop crying myself to sleep for spending money that would have been better spent buying Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles part 2.",1251676800,,724,4.6640625
3777049,1,B001RLW9Y6,don't buy this movie it souds like the perfect movie but its far from it don't waste your time or money just go rent never back down no matter how many times you've seen it it's better than this movie,1251417600,,200,4.025
3777050,5,B001RLW9Y6,"I think this film has Oscar potential, sex and fighting, just what every movie needs. I watched this movie 6 times in a row, I just could't get enough awesomeness !!! When GSP retires, he should become a full time actor. Now I'm going to kill myself.",1243728000,,250,4.340425531914893
3777051,1,B001RLW9Y6,"The movie is so unrealistic and the plot is not set up at all. It feels like a bunch of scenes just thrown together and called a movie. No flow at all, just scene, another scene, sex scene, fight scene, sex scene, fight scene, crap, crap, and more crap. The cameo appearances by the MMA fighters are tacky and have little to do with the plot and just added to the movie for no reason.(with the exception of Heath Herring). I don't usually write reviews but this movie stunk it up so bad, I had to warn others. I didn't even pay for this movie (someone else rented it) and I wanted my money back!",1243641600,,595,4.182608695652174
3777052,3,B001RLW9Y6,"don't expect too much even you see all the great MMA fighters in the front cover. For the real MMA fighters, this is just a small stepping stone to be in the bigger silver screen in the future may be. But for the Hector Echavarria, it's great to have all of them supporting his movie. So it's a win win business for both sides. In our side, we're the ones who lost hahaha.... but if you really try to open your mind that this is a truly b grade (or even c grade anyone? ;p ) movie and it's about underground fighting with money and women as the prices. Well , it's not that bad, actually. Should have been rated X, some soft porn and a little violence. The fighting scenes are fun for a movie! not for real, of course. If we want to watch a realistic and great fight, we should rent or buy UFC; Best of 2008 or something like that. Most martial arts movies (especially the b grade ones) aren't realistic, that's why it's a movie, just to entertain. This Hector guy who write, direct, produce and also act in this movie as a main character, might have a dream to be like Stallone's Rocky probably (which his accomplishment isn't anything like Stallone's, of course) Well, everybody has a dream and don't get mad about their dream, it's theirs. We have our own.
Basically a pretty good X rated action b movie, especially with GSP, BJ, the Spider and Texas Crazy Horse lend some of their moves (Rampage just doing a 6 second fighting scenes in the movie with a repetation movements!) everyone else show a bit of their athleticism, but Rampage also show his humorous dialogue as usual.
Enjoy the movie as it is, expecting great story line for martial arts movie? check out ""Redbelt"" and for pretty good MMA moves in real life (still not quiet realistic but much better compared to others like Never Back Down etc.) check out ""Flash Point"". Looking for an easy action b movie with little violence and softporn, this is for you.",1242086400,,1922,4.432203389830509
3777053,3,B001RLW9Y6,"First off, this movie is not for everyone. Hardcore MMA fans will be stocked with disappointment. And not for any kids under 18. This movie should have been rated X, under Softcore Porn.

Big name MMA fighters head the front of the cover, but the main actor is Hector Echavarria. And if you haven't noticed yet, he's also the Director, Producer, and Writer. Now that's a really big mistake in my book.

This movie was enjoyable for me. Even though the fight scenes were a real disappointment. No realism. Everything was so fake. Their movements were so slow. It was plan laughable. Basically, I was saying WTF, after the first few minutes. But then I cleared my mind, trying to be open minded, thinking that this was only a movie. And that I was watching a bad acting softcore porn movie with some underground fight scenes in it. That's when I started to enjoy the movie.

So beware before buying or renting this movie.",1242000000,4,919,4.591463414634147
3777054,1,B001RLW9Y6,"The way this movie was marketed makes you think it stars some of MMA's elite.  Instead it has breif cameos that makes you wonder what the loser who made this movie is blackmailing them with to get them to appear in it.  The fight scenes are pathetic and the ""star"" of the film is worthless.  I only spent 99 cents to rent this and it was a huge waste of money, not to mention time.  Save your eyes the torture and avoid this piece of CRAP at all costs.",1241222400,5,452,4.044943820224719

8338211,2,B001RLW9Y6,"While the die-hards of mixed martial arts sometimes claim that MMA has deep roots in cinema, going back to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enter-the-Dragon/dp/B00P0E0WTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enter the Dragon</a>, one of the first films to actually be produced and marketed on a wide scale as an ""MMA action movie"" is in fact ""Never Surrender."" Explicitly centered around cage-fighting and featuring no less than six well-known competitors, this is clearly the first feature to completely exploit the combat sport, albeit with poor results. Since this one's release, the subgenre has had a lot to make up for, and I think we have star/writer/MMA fanboy Hector Echavarria to blame for it.

The story: The world's top fighter (Echavarria,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unrivaled/dp/B0031XYLPI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unrivaled</a>) is lured into a lucrative fighting tournament, only to discover the sadistic nature of its promoter (Patrick Kilpatrick,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Warrant/dp/B0000542CC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Warrant</a>).

Starting with this film, ol' Hector became the premier supplier of direct-to-video MMA action yarns for several years. While the half-dozen or so features of this sort that he's made haven't resonated with viewers, this one feels like the very worst. There are the old shortcomings - bad fight scenes, goofy acting, and an illogical story - but what will probably ruin it for most people is the ceaseless celebration of Echavarria's persona. He is the idealized hero in overdrive, a ""Marty Stu"" if ever there was one, whose only flaws (as a fighter, lover, and all-around great guy) are that he's too trusting of random opportunities and can't be in more than one place at the same time. The amount of metaphorical masturbation approaches&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Holds-Barred/dp/B00H91LW5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Holds Barred</a>&nbsp;levels, and it gets old very fast.

To his credit, Hector is a pretty decent onscreen fighter - possibly the only person still performing flying kicks in movies - but as aforementioned, all of the fights stink. In 16 bouts, there's room for occasionally inventive choreography, but the butcher-style editing minimizes most of their potential. A fight involving Lateef Crowder (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Protector/dp/B000I0RNWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Protector</a>) almost drove me to depression, because it could have been so much better. Also, the utilization of noted MMA figures is pretty disappointing, at least given their prominent billing. Half of these guys only have a single scene throughout the movie, and even more only have a single fight - fights which aren't among even the meager best that the film has to offer, because as tough as these fellows are, they can't make it look good in choreography.

As upbeat as this movie seems to think it is, it shows a pretty nasty side when it comes to its female characters, who are without exception either passive victims or sex objects (literally, objects - the fighters aren't competing for money or fame, but to have sex with each other's consorts). It definitely crosses a line of taste when the promoter beats a woman (Cristina Rose, ""Hell's Chain"") to death for not having sex with Hector's character. Adding these factors to the rest of the faults makes for a film that's well-made but almost completely without appeal. I can't recommend it, and am only glad that Mr. Echavarria was able to marginally improve his formula as time went on.",1423785600,2,3752,6.086956521739131
8338212,5,B001RLW9Y6,"With all the badly-acting MMA superstars you could want (although Heath Herring actually does have talent, believe it or not!), plot holes so big you could drive a truck through them, pointless scenes and scenes so poorly executed that you can't help but shake your head in disbelief, this is the film for you.

I'd actually rented this thing a few years ago, remembered how bad it was and wanted to show my girlfriend....so I bought the damn thing. I can't believe someone gave this thing a green light, just as I can't believe a professional writer could have so little talent. Hilarious stuff!",1379289600,,596,4.730769230769231

8338214,3,B001RLW9Y6,it was ok not everything i expected. i would buy again if i'd never seen it. i liked the movie all in all. it satisfied my curiosity.thanks so much amazon.,1345334400,,155,4.2
8338215,1,B001RLW9Y6,"Seriously, I picked up this movie because I love MMA.  Don't make the same mistake I did - this movie is one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen (not just MMA films, all movies!!!)

The acting is awful, the main character is so wooden and terrible at delivering his lines you want to punch him in the face.  And you know you'd get away with it because the fighting in this movie is pitifully terrible.  The UFC and mma fighters in this should be ashamed of themselves for not telling the director what an awful film he was making.  Hell, Rampage just shows up for a fight outside a bar, then leaves, WTF???  In no way shape or form does the fighting in this represent what MMA really is!  It's just a bad story about underground fighting, but there's lots of sex, cause you know, that's what MMA is right?  Sex and fighting?  It's so bad, there's even a sex/fighting montage (if you find that erotic, get your head examined).

DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE, IT IS SO BAD IT WILL ACTUALLY LOWER YOUR INTELLIGENCE",1317859200,,1012,4.363636363636363
8338216,1,B001RLW9Y6,"It reminds me of those martial arts movies I used to watch when I was a kid that had no story whatsoever and was filled with punching and kicking scenes throughout the movie. This movie is just like that, terrible story and full of fighting scenes that aren't even that good. Even that star playing the role of Diego, who is he? I've never seen him before in MMA. Why is he starring an MMA movie? Moreover, this movie fools you by having top MMA champions on its cover such as Silva, GSP, Penn, and Rampage. I was surprised to see them act in such a low budget film.

In conclusion, don't buy this movie. Go watch Red Belt or Never Back Down if you want a good MMA movie.",1305158400,,671,4.161538461538462
8338217,1,B001RLW9Y6,this seriously has to be one of the worst movies ive ever seen! thats about an hour and a half of my life i'll never get back! you'll see better acting in a porn movie than you will on here thats for sure! As soon as the movie was over i trashed the dvd! do yourself a favor and forget this movie ever even came out on DVD! don't be fooled by the cover like i was!,1255132800,,364,3.74025974025974
8338218,1,B001RLW9Y6,"OK, now I know I've said this before...but this has to be among the WORST movies I've EVER seen.  The acting is pitiful, ESPECIALLY the voice overs (since some of the MMA fighters featured don't speak english, or do so with a very heavy accent).  The acting is so bad in fact it was almost like a softcore porn movie on Cinemax.  The main ""love interest"" looks so trashy, well....I couldn't tell if she was supposed to be a junkie or a drag queen.  Before a fight, there's a quick cutaway to a CGI of the octagon, and then a ""Versus"" screen, like watching pre-fight info of a UFC fight, or before the first round of a video game.  The fighting is also REALLY badly choreographed, falling short of even the worst Jackie Chan movie.

In all honesty, if you ""must"" see an MMA, see Never Back Down.

""Never Surrender"" should instead have been called ""Never Direct This Crapfest""",1252022400,3,874,4.459119496855346
