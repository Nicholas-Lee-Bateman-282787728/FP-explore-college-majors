3715886,4,B001NFNFH6,"For those of you who don't know, the founders of this ghost hunters group are plumbers by day and paranormal investigators by night.  Even though this sounds funny, they are quite serious about their ghost hunting and their day job has helped them to debunk, more than often than not, claims of ghostly invasions.  That being said, this TV series is, to me anyhow, a lot of entertaining fun.  Once in awhile it is genuinely creepy.  I watch for the great locations and the interaction of the crew with each other.  Two of my favorites are Steve and Tango.  Steve has phobias about spiders, flying, and just about anything you can imagine....except ghosts.  Tango on the other hand will enter into a dark crawl space that squirms with insects...or even might eat one, if the money that Steve offers is right.  Personally I think Tango sells himself cheap but this is the kind of stuff that makes this show fun.  They have investigated famous lighthouses, inns, ships in previous shows and in this 4-DVD set they travel from New York state to California and to Florida.  The investigation sites are always interesting if not always beautiful.  Anyhow I am completely hooked on this show.  By the way the quality of the video itself is quite good, but the footage of night vision camera shots are not always so.  Sometimes they are grainy and a bit difficult to see.  But that being said I am still an avid fan.",1284422400,6,1408,4.625

I've been watching Ghost Hunters (via satellite and in the States) from almost the very beginning. I've now seen the original programs and have read the books of Jason and Grant too. I have to say that I believe that ghosts may exist, but I want some kind of evidence. Some kind of proof. These investigators -- and their paranormal investigation team -- work on the same premise. They attempt to ""debunk"" paranormal claims, but when they gather evidence that is hard to ""debunk"" or ""dispute,"" they are left with evidence that may actually support life after death (i.e., ghost, paranormal activity).

While Ghost Hunters works with a scientific leaning by utilizing technical equipment from EMF meters / K2 meters, digital thermometers, night vision cameras and thermal sensor equipment, etc., other paranormal programs utilize spirit mediums and the like. While I do not discount psychic mediums and sensitives, their evidence is hard to prove or ""debunk."" Nevertheless, programs like ""Paranormal State"" and ""Paranormal Cops"" (broadcast on A&E) have their place as well. They are certainly interesting. Psychic mediums like John Edward and Chip Coffee are quite interesting. In fact, I've been watching John Edward for many years. He's gotten a bit ""mushy"" as of late (even for WE) -- his original program on SyFy used to display his medium abilities more readily. In short, more readings.

Writers and psychic researchers like Peter Cayce are also quite interesting. Peter Cayce utilizes Science, Philosophy and Religion to come up with explanations for the afterlife and reincarnation and Karma. Interesting material.

In any case, the paranormal field is an interesting one. I'd really like to see more programs about legitimate psychics and paranormal investigators like Ghost Hunters, John Edward and Peter Cayce.

3715891,4,B001NFNFH6,"The show is GREAT.  The only reason I give 4 stars is the DVD setup and audio.  First off in earlier seasons you weren't FORCED to watch the DVD manufacturers Logos at the startup of EVERY DVD you start.  Then the audio seems to drop low at times and you have to crank up the volume especially on the outtakes they are lousy at times on audio.  They really should get another DVD manufacturer to do their videos.  Oh yeah the packaging on all of them, really hate STACKING DVDs one on top of another this can lead to scratching.",1252713600,,528,4.24

3715894,2,B001NFNFH6,"I have watched GH's from the time they started airing them and loved the first 3 seasons.  I not only learned from them, I waited anxiously for what they might find next, and also enjoyed the reality TV part of the show, that shed insight into how they handled each other's normal lives and dealt with each other's personalities, as a group of mature guys and girls with regular jobs, who had such a strange hobby that grew tremendously in popularity.

Season 4 is a woefully dull series of fuzzy ""EVP's,"" hearing ""footsteps and whispers,"" etc.., that the audience certainly cannot hear for the most part, because of the over-bearing background music more than anything.

They've all but ditched using video evidence, instead focusing on (increasingly dull when they're not very good or telling) EVP's, personal experiences that are unverifiable by the audience, and thermal imaging evidence that is usually spotty at best (with some exceptions).

It's sad now people practically worship Jason and Grant, take everything they do as gospel, and their following consists predominately of Wal-Mart shoppers and the like, looking for a cheap thrill, and putting their blind faith into everything they do.

And now we have thousands and thousands of ""amateur ghost hunter teams"" out there mimicking everything they do, creating web sites and Myspace pages, looking for attention, profit, and practically begging people to let them into their homes or business to ""investigate.""

The whole scene has gotten silly, to the point that the scientific community surely frowns on all of it, and honestly the field has taken a step backward of late, due to the rampant profiteering and media hungry ""American Idol"" crowd types who've jumped in and practically ruined any progress we once made in the search for paranormal understanding.

I don't think TAPS meant to do this to the field, if you can call it that now, but they certainly haven't done anything to curb the rampant groupie behavior and silliness it's all become.

As for the DVD season 4, finally, it's become incredibly formulaic, dull, and repetitive.  There's no real ""thrills"" here, no ground-breaking evidence to reveal, such as in the first 2-3 seasons, just more of the same dull repetitive walking around hearing things we can't and seeing things no one else can - and often not finding much of anything in the end.

Give it a pass and buy the first 2-3 seasons, and stay far away from Ghost Hunters International, a horrible spin-off of boring investigation sequences that turn up nothing as you watch very boring people walking around dark buildings, not even poor attempts at humor can save this show now.",1244160000,3,2666,4.9842342342342345
3715895,2,B001NFNFH6,"""What was that?"" ""Did you hear that?"" Knock, Knock, Na-Knock, Knock, ? ?, Same-O, Same-O crap! But every week I think it might be better but again NOTHING! Only Steve & Tango crying about spiders what a sissy (If you don't like it smash it!), stupid question on each other, and drumming pans like a band, pranks give me a freaking break! It looks more like a comedy show. Kris is way better by her self half the time. Now I like the show and bought every season but Come-on man they need something better (I NEED TO SEE SOMETHING!) forget about EVP recording that's like a fart in the wind.  They need more angry questions from the light meter (if it is a real light meter) is there a devil?, Demon? Lost soul? Are you scared? Etc, Etc. If the ghosts want you to go away, and Grant & Jason will go away!, maybe you shouldn't want to be a ghost hunter...ya think? Now about the fake loose flash light on and off? Why is it that the camera man(s) has 90% on Grant & Jason instead of looking around to see something?. So why do I still buy it??? Do I still like the show??? Maybe will still see something better next week/month??? Or am I a SUCKER??? Yes I like it show but probably never buy it any more and forget about GHI this is the worst!!! I think Brian & Dustin, should go back to the original GH so Brian can run like a rabbit in the Eastern State Penitentiary again, me I think it was the best I've seen in Season 1.

Now about the DVD I think some of the episodes are more like a satellite freeze is it defected? I Me I think its cheap, grainy, full screen crap! Also the sound is terrible MONO like the bass straight up! And the treble down!, No Subtitles, NO Close-Caption (Not helpful with people that can't hear), It's been 4 years and still HAVE NOT moved to WIDESCREEN yet!.

3715926,2,B001NFNFH6,"Ghost Hunters is a was a good show, but it is saddled with loud horrible music. The music [insert loud keyboard sound here] drowns out anything the viewer might hear. The music also incorporates odd sounds so if you COULD hear something, you can't tell if it's the ghost sounds or the music [insert loud ""bang"" here]. I personally do not need the music[fade the music here]. In fact, I get frustrated, not scared because of the music [insert more insidental music here]. One thing that ""Most Haunted"" and ""Paranormal State"" do is use the music in the history portions of thier shows and keep it to a minimum to none on the actual ghost part so you can hear with the crew what is going on. With ""Ghost Hunters"" the music tends to make the viewer feel as if they are really not to be included on the hunt that you, the viewer are an outsider looking in on the clique as they hunt and you will find out when they are good and ready to let you in on the haunting. That's a cheat to the fan, really. On the epidoe called ""Spirits On The Water"" everytime a caption appears, there is loud whoosh of music, at times so loud that it drowns out the dialogue. There are also loud knocks every few seconds designed to put out on the edge of your seat, but actually are so loud you can't tell what happened on the show. And suddenly, in odd places, there is a loud keyboard ""shock"" sound which actually cheapens this show. This whole show seems so hokey now.

I also get frustrated with the editing. It cuts off sounds, jumps about and sometimes makes the show flow very uneven. makes the feel of the show ""rushed"". Like the early morning shows on tv when they have a guest, get the guest to start talking, then hurry them through the segment because we're about out of time!  They tend to be very repetitive in some things. For example, in the ""Bottled Spirits"" episode, within the first 4 1/2 minutes they repeat 5 times that cases with children take high priority. That's great, but why tell us 5 times in a row? Why not say it once and use the rest of the time on ghost footage or history? It reminds me of ""Barney"" because on that kid's show, they repeat stuff over and over for education. Hopefully little kids aren't watching ghost shows when they should be watching ""Barney"".

One good thing is Jason and Grant take a more active roll in this season rather than sitting back in the van and letting the others do the work. Gone is Jason's superior attitude that he carried in the earlier seasons. He seems more down to earth and the crew doesn't seem so tense and worried about him losing his temper like they did in the past. They all seem to work well together now.

This show also tends to set up scenes as one thing, go to break,  then come back and the scene turns out differently. There's alot of hype for things that almost always, when it comes back from commercial break, are usually false or explained away in a few seconds, or really have no significance to anything at all.

I had stopped watching for awile due to the music and attitude of the show. But now I started watching again. I do like it, but I see it getting stale. The formula is pretty much the same as in seasons past. They repeat what some terms are endlessly such as what an EMF is and EVP. They talk between the vans with walkie talkies...why? I don't know...and it's usually stuff they already established back at the round table or already discussed.  And they almost always bump knuckles in the end. This show really needs to break up the repetition in explanations, flow, everything. You can predict each episode how it will go...Jason willl say this...Grant will do this....Steve will explaine this...week in and week out...and in reality...that is not how the paranormal works.

Also, this season, almost all the dialogue seems ""staged"" and rehearsed. It would be a much more enjoyable show if it weren't so ""puffed up"" and the music toned down or pretty much eliminated. This show used to be enjoyable, but due to the over editing, the loud music, the staged scenes, it's not so good anymore. There's no ""meat"" to it, so repeated watchings are just dull.

This also contains the embarrassing live event that had the internet a buzz claiming that TAPS was faking it. You be the judge but the coat pull has me suspicious, too. Also, I noticed far more of the ""Did you see that!"" type stuff and not actually showing the viewer. Why? Because the camera is on the stars of the show!",1242086400,11,4457,4.4322344322344325

They got great video and EVP hits on almost every episode. The last 2 DVD's however bored the hell out me! The sit down with the ghost hunters I guess was cool, if you don't know the history behind them or you don't follow the show that closely. One of the last episodes seemed a little fishy to me, with the wire hanger being thrown at them mutible times. Why wasn't any camera placed on hanger in the closet after the first time it was thrown at them? And do they really have to explane what a EVP is every episode after 4 seasons? Hearing what the side effects of a high EMF levels are every episode, sometimes twice an episode really gets on my nerves too.

Now for the season. Lots of great episodes and great evidence. Kris Williams is an acceptable addition to the team. She is definitely on the novice side, and if the rumors are true then potentially an actress. But she doesn't bother me.
They need to get rid of Amy Bruni. This girl clearly believes herself to be a ghost hunting aficionado, but she is barely qualified to even hunt with TAPS. She has no idea what she is doing. Not to mention she's got the worst teeth this side of England. Ha.
The locales are great, but they should send back the ""house"" episodes as always. Too many dimwits who are too eager to waste J and G's time. On the upside, this is the better half of the season, with superior evidence. But also Amy Bruni, ugh!
If you're a GH fan, you already know if you're gonna buy this. For newcomers to the show, begin at season one or two.
