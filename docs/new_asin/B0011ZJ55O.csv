Unless you consider a slide show of tropical fish to be video, then I suppose this would qualify.  Maybe this was intended to be a music only type of disc.  Except for the DTS MA soundtrack, this disc completely defeats the purpose of HD.",1240358400,,353,4.303030303030303
8243128,2,B0011ZJ55O,"Nice music, nothing extraordinary. Video is a slide show of photographs. Nice, but appear to be pictures within an aquarium. My opinion, not worth the price.",1218931200,,157,5.076923076923077
8243129,1,B0011ZJ55O,"Low res pictures set to something approximating music. Did not enhance my Home Theatre experience at all. If you want something that does that, get Planet Earth.",1216425600,,161,5.0
8243130,2,B0011ZJ55O,"This is a review of Mysterious Aqua - Music Experience in 3-Dimensional Sound Reality [HD DVD]. This HD-DVD is a series of still photographs with water as the subject matter accompanied by synthesizer music. It is a project by Alexander Jero and last about 42 minutes. The pictures are nice but I did not find anything special about the sound, the title ""Music Experience in 3-Dimensional Sound Reality"" creates expectations that are not meet or come near what was expected. If you like electronic music and can buy it at a CD price ($9.99), you might be happy with this recording, otherwise is not for you.",1215129600,,607,4.735849056603773
