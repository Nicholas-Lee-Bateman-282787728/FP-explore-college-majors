3153129,5,B001675YNY,"Meteorologists have long wanted information about conditions inside tornadoes--they believe that a more thorough understanding of tornadoes would lead to longer warning times and saved lives.

This first (2007) season of the Discovery Channel's ""Storm Chasers"" tracks a brave team of scientists and an IMAX film maker as they traverse Texas, Kansas, and other locations in Tornado Alley in search of twisters.  The scientists use radar to estimate where to plant their probes that obtain tornado data, and the series shows how much guesswork and frustration is inherent in storm chasing, as when the team missed the devastating Greensburg, Kansas storm.

However, the chasers do also have their moments of success in their pursuit of tornadoes, and the series would be of interest to any weather enthusiast.",1258502400,7,807,5.338582677165355
3153130,5,B001675YNY,"This is the, unfortunately short, first season of the Discovery Channel series.  It follows one of the most prominent meteorolgists while he chases tornadoes across Tornado Alley with the D.O.W. and his convoy.  D.O.W = Doppler on Wheels.  THe best part is the T.I.V owned by a long time IMAX film maker hopeing to finish his documentary.  T.I.V = Tornado Intercept Vehicle.  Sean and his two college buddies are trying to drive the T.I.V directly into the path of a tornado and get hit so Sean can get the final shot he needs for his documentary.

As you can imagine tempers fly along with parts of the T.I.V.  There is even footage of the damage the day after the Greensburg tornado that wiped out the town.  Once you fall in love with this very short first season you must purchase the second, much larger, season to feed your tornado chasing fix.  This is a great, energetic series, and I wouldn't stop watching if I wanted to.  Except when there was a marathon and I had to go to work. :(",1232409600,4,993,4.466666666666667

3153140,1,B001675YNY,"I waited 2 episodes for anything at all interesting to happen. The chasers are dull and have no personality. This is a waste of time and money. Go outside and wait for a storm, you'll be more entertained.",1373328000,,204,4.394736842105263

3153142,5,B001675YNY,I purchased the entire series of 5 years of the Storm Chaser DVD's and even these add on DVDs. I enjoy them - informative and fast action. I am a weather buff so I do enjoy the weather information you learn when watching these DVDs.  If I could humbly mention one negative - too much swearing.,1349222400,2,293,4.232142857142857
3153143,5,B001675YNY,"Storm Chasers premiered in the fall of 2007 and it has been the show I most look forward to every year. The show documents IMAX film maker Sean Casey and Dr. Josh Wurman as they drive through Tornado Alley in search of some of the most powerful storms on the planet, tornadoes. Sean's goal is to film a tornado as it impacts him from his 14,000 lb custom built Tornado Intercept Vehicle. Josh's goal is to collect scientific data to better understand these powerful storms. This set contains the first season of the show which is just 4 episodes. Although season one is short the content of each show is fantastic. While the show is fun to watch, it also very informative and you can learn alot about weather from watching the episodes. Storm Chasers is the best show on television about storms and weather.

The second disc in this set is called Perfect Disaster. There are 6 episodes to this set and they are documentaries that deal with what would happen if a major natural disaster were to hit large metropolitan areas. All of it is very interesting and entertaining at the same time. With 4 great episodes of Storm Chasers, the 2nd disc with Perfect Disaster is the icing on the cake. This is a great DVD set with great documentaries that are both fun and entertaining.

DVD is 7 hours.",1320105600,4,1291,4.536480686695279
3153144,3,B001675YNY,"I'm a weather junkie. Short of a meteorology degree, I know a lot about supercell activity and tornado formation. This stuff is very interesting and I've always wanted to see a tornado in person, but I live in the wrong part of the country. In another life, perhaps.

The point is; storm chasing is incredibly exciting. It's a visceral experience unlike anything else, and for some reason the people in this documentary just seem too cautious/unenthusiastic about the whole thing. It's off-putting. You can get better, more exciting footage of tornadoes by opening the outbreak segments of Wikipedia, looking at the lists and classifications of the known tornadoes from a particular outbreak, and scanning Youtube for the corresponding tornado with (mostly) amateur footage of the storms.

I mean, this guy Josh relies way too much on his computer models, and the irony is that within the very show he is shown to be wrong/having miscalculated numerous times. All the while, the rest of the team is viewing the actual weather with their eyes, and this meteorologist is contradicting them with computer models that ended up being wrong more than they're right. It's frustrating to watch, instead of fun. The culmination is when Josh, our buddy the ""always wrong overly cautious"" leader, improperly predicts storm formation to eastern Kansas, while Sean, the intuitive ""photographer"" storm chaser accurately calls development to the south. That development resulted in one of the worst tornadoes in history, the Greensburg tornado. Obviously storm chasing isn't an exact science and mistakes are a given, but this guy makes so many mistakes throughout some of the episodes that it kind of hampers the enjoyment of it. Ultimately, the stormchasers that rely a bit more on intuition and experience are much more engaging to watch and because the leader of this series is a cautious, conservative ""radar watcher,"" the show suffers from it and is less interesting than it should be.

To be honest, as annoying as he is, I actually prefer the videos Reed Timmer makes. He's a lot younger, more enthusiastic and focused, and more willing to take the risks which often result in larger payoffs/better footage. I'm not saying with something like storm chasing that being a wild card is better, but I get the impression in this series that the chasers here are just a little too cautious and a little too focused on their instrumentation rather than the epic views of the vicious weather all around them.

The show is not bad, but it could (and should) be much better.",1307923200,4,2557,4.995305164319249
3153145,4,B001675YNY,"It's a great show. Good going Shaun,Twistex, and doninater crews. I'd love to know when Shaun's movie comes to fruition.",1281312000,,120,5.05
3153146,3,B001675YNY,"I purchased this because I have always been a weather junkie and wanted to learn more; the chase episodes were very disappointing.  If I were forced to ride in the vehicle for a day with the overwhelmingly negative photographer, I would find another chase vehicle to occupy!  The second dvd is much more interesting, with various types of weather related disasters, what causes them, how they will affect us worst case scenario, etc.  I also bought this for my sister, and she raved about the second dvd.  Unless they find a new photographer, I won't be buying any additional seasons of the show.  The woe-is-me doom and gloom attitude of the photographer guarantees that this won't make many repeat performances in my disc changer.",1272067200,6,732,4.870967741935484
