8019891,1,B000219OZY,This had to be the least thought out and worst produced documentary I have ever watched. Don't waste your time.,1522195200,,111,4.6
8019892,5,B000219OZY,"As I myself go through a transition from mainstream American life to hippie culture (something I've always been interested in, but too introverted and self-conscious to immerse myself in it fully- until now), I find this documentary to be very informative and inspiring. If you're interested in and want to learn a little history about hippies, watch it; you won't be disappointed!",1512345600,,381,5.161290322580645
8019893,1,B000219OZY,"A couple of old hippies do manage to pop up in here, but basically this is just an unfocused open camera in the middle of a tourist town trying to present itself as a documentary.",1500768000,,179,4.142857142857143
8019894,4,B000219OZY,"No, it's not an a David Attenborough quality documentary, it's too disorganized, which I think may be deliberate style. That said, it doesn't deserve the one star reviews it's getting here. (7.1 on IMDB is more accurate) The (German?) film-makers go to Goa and ask around for leftover hippies, and run into ravers on New Years'. The interviews are unplanned and spontaneous, but then there's an interview with the mayor of Goa, who explains that his town wants tourists with money now. Cleo Odzer who wrote ""Goa Freaks"", is interviewed extensively, and her Super-8 films from the late 70's are used quite a bit. She died shortly afterwards, of mysterious health reasons, unmentioned in the film. Her book refers to drug smuggling back in the day, a history which this film neglects.  The movie ends by bringing a couple of religious/former hippie guys who went to Germany (and a ""Love Parade""). They talk spiritual talk for a bit. One seems to have fully committed to Hindu religious life, the other, more loosely, although this isn't explored too deeply. Was there really a good reason to bring them to Germany? Probably not; there wasn't much good footage. Comparisons and contrasts between modern Western life and ancient Hindu religion could have been explored more, in a Herzog-like voiceover, perhaps. It's a short, light movie, free on Prime, inexpensive otherwise (No need for HD, go SD). If you have a Cartman-like attitude and want to see a humorous movie making fun, this film isn't going to entertain. If you want to know about drug smuggling that happened, and perhaps still does, you will be disappointed. Taken for what it is, though, it's not too bad. It's a nice last interview of Odzer, at least.",1486944000,3,1714,4.890034364261169

8019899,4,B000219OZY,"DVD should play in most, if not all U.S. DVD players. Have to admit - intriguing / quite interesting DVD to watch - running time is just 45 minutes. Liked hearing the words from philosopher - Swami Williams as to what that great mind had to say. Thoroughly enjoyed the interview with the late society girl Cleo Odzer (I knew that name sounded familiar) - author of  'GOA Freaks - My Hippie Years In India'. I recommend that this DVD document (filmed during the winter, 1999-2000) to be viewed by small groups of friends - most preferably those of who you are very tight with. Plus, it helps if you -get- as to what this whole scene is all about. Definitely, not for everyone.",1438214400,,675,4.443548387096774
