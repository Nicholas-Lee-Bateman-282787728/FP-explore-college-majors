8426051,4,B004DTS1AA,"While I am disappointed at the cost of the product, I am certainly not disappointed at the quality programming provided. Our 2 year old began to hit out of frustration and so we decided to supplement Mr. Rogers rather than Sesame Street as part of his bed time routine. It did not take long before he started to use the anger management techniques Mr. Rogers taught with our help. Almost all of children shows in comparison are simply meant to keep the child glued to the TV, Mr. Rogers has the appropriate pacing to actually teaching children through this medium. 5 Stars for Mr. Rogers. Less stars for cost of DVD...",1379030400,4,618,4.576576576576577
8426052,5,B004DTS1AA,"Obviously, Mister Rogers is the best quality content for children, and often for adults.  Just now, May 2012, a few dozen episodes are on Hulu.  These two discs contain a week of 1995 shows about how to appropriately express anger.

The video quality isn't too bad.  Obviously, its videotape.  One thing that jarred me is the pan at the start, from the traffic light through the living room to the door; this happens fast and is jerky. I was afraid this would be apparent throughout the show, but I really didn't notice it here.  The camera doesn't move much from side-to-side on this show, so there's not much opportunity.  There are no DVD captions, no closed captions, no previews, no word from the FBI: nothing but the shows.

In addition to Hulu, you might enjoy neighborhoodarchive.com.  I'm going to try to buy the 2-disc sets, and maybe go on to the single shows whenever I get a raise.",1336867200,5,894,4.6075949367088604
8426053,5,B004DTS1AA,"You just can't beat Mr. Rogers. Talk about wholesome. I feel like this shouldn't even count as ""tv time,"" it's so good for kids. The shows are excellent, the man is excellent, and the product is excellent. My preschoolers have been talking more about ""what to do with my 'mad'"". Great stuff! Even if you don't have ""mad"" issues.",1320105600,2,328,4.576271186440678
