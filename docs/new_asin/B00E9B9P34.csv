This movie was just released on DVD, Region 1 (USA, etc.) and is very good...compare it to the excellent CRUMB 1996 and CONFESSIONS OF ROBERT CRUMB 1987 documentaries....also about a famous 1960's illustrator who left the USA...now lives in France, just like Tomi Ungerer!

Ungerer is seen at age 81 with white hair, walking with cane.

He is old and bent over, but still has a twinkle in his eye and a great sense of mischievous humor.

The ""special features"" section shows an interchange he had with Jules Feiffer which is wonderful.

""Special Features"" on this video also show the late, great Maurice Sendak complaining about THE KING'S SPEECH ""Best Picture Academy Award"" movie.....also wonderful.

This documentary is a treasure because Tomi Ungerer is a treasure.

Also, get the CRUMB 1997 and THE CONFESSIONS OF ROBERT CRUMB 1987 videos used from Amazon. Com cheap....another great American artist who moved to France....he's still there!

Thanks for reading this.

5897929,5,B00E9B9P34,"Artist Tomi Ungerer, born in Strasbourg, Alsace - on the border of France and Germany - came of age during the Nazi occupation and this had a great influence on his artistic style. Though it was funny and clever, it had its dark size too. And his art appeared everywhere - in children's books (some of which were banned from libraries because they talked about death) and advertising (his ads for the Village Voice - ""Expect the Unexpected"" - and his ""Black Power/White Power"" poster are legendary. He even made a few recordings in Germany (not mentioned in the film). For the 98-minute film, Director Brad Bernstein animated many of Ungerer's illustrations and it is dazzling to the eye! The film is narrated by Ungerer himself (what an engaging personality he has!) with comments from his family as fellow illustrators like Maurice Sendak.

As if this wasn't enough there are about 35 minutes of ""Bonus Features"" on the DVD, in addition to a full length Director's Commentary (which I have not listened to), including a feature on his life in Ireland and a 17 minute ""conversation"" between Ungerer and Jules Feiffer at the Society of Illustrators. There's a few short deleted scenes and a throwaway piece where Sendak critiques the film ""The King's Speech"" (which has nothing to do with Ungerer!).

This is another fine addition to First Run Features ""Artists Series"" of DVDs. Highly recommended.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5897930,5,B00E9B9P34,"I had the opportunity to see this documentary at an independent theater in San Francisco. Tomi's life spans the Nazi occupation of France, the American civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, and the sexual revolution in the U.S.  I would highly recommend this for anybody who enjoys children's books, erotica, or a story about a really, really interesting person.",1378598400,5,364,5.169491525423729

8602927,5,B00E9B9P34,"Excellent DVD.  Right up there in quality with Ken Burns etc.
The visuals, both Mr. Ungerer's and the film makers were outstanding.
The film pointed out that Tomi Ungerer invented new graphic art styles which are still current today.  He could really draw and paint, but more importantly, he could make a compelling image that was curvy, fluid, biological and resonated.

My only ding was on the background music sounds being too loud in the beginning when Ungerer was speaking softly.
CC would have been nice.",1420588800,,510,4.906976744186046
8602928,4,B00E9B9P34,"Another independent movie that comes in a simple cardboard jacket.  This is the biography of Tomi Ungerer, a man who grew up caught between two countries [grew up in Alsace, which has alternately belonged to Germany and to France] and ended up caught between two very different art genres.  Ungerer was an illustrator for childrens books, but in the US during the Vietnam War era, he began drawing very counter-culture artwork.  It was considered outrageous enough that the New York Times book reviewer at the time commented that she would no longer review any childrens books illustrated by Ungerer, because a man who drew drawings like that had no place in a childrens
Book!

The beginning of the film notes that all of the art in the movie is Tomi Ungerers own artwork, except where otherwise noted.  The otherwise consists of some of the artwork of Tomis father, a quite talented man who did paintings as a hobby, a few pieces of European art which Tomi Ungerer explains had a profound effect on the way he thought about drawing, and one glimpse of Sendaks classic illustrations for Where The Wild Things Are.

Obviously Ungerer is a very talented man.  He seems to only be happy when he is drawing something, which seems to be most of the time.  I give the movie a solid B.  It's a story I did not know.",1409529600,,1308,4.603448275862069

8602931,5,B00E9B9P34,A wonderful story of survival after a childhood lived under the domination of the Nazis.  You can see a damaged genius at work here and how he put a life together after all the childhood trauma.,1387152000,,194,4.388888888888889
8602932,5,B00E9B9P34,Tomi Ungerer is a fantastic from the soul artist. His body of work truly represents what being true to oneself means.,1386547200,,117,4.619047619047619
8602933,4,B00E9B9P34,"Enjoyable documentary about iconic 1960s and 70s children's book author, creator of powerful, anti-war and other political posters, and artist of erotica, often with a bondage or S+M theme. As diverse as this work is, it all shares Ungerer's trade mark dark sense of humor.

The film follows his interesting life, from Childhood in Nazi occupied Alsatia, to his coming to America, his success as an illustrator, and then hugely as a children's book author, his politicalization and involvement with erotic, to the fateful moment when they all came together after he was attacked for his sexual drawings at a children's book convention, and was almost immediately black-listed. His books were taken out of libraries, publishers dropped him, publications (including the New York Times) refused to review his work. Much of the film is Ungerer himself,a very engaging interview subject, now in his 80s ruminating on everything; art, life, death, sex, politics, success and failure, children, fear.  He is eccentric to be sure but in a way that feels very open and inviting.

All that said, there's a lack of emotion for the great majority of the film. Also, I'm just slightly mistrustful of how complete a portrait the film actually is. Growing up in NYC I happened to know Ungerer's daughter when we both were about 10 years old. Yet there's no mention of her,or her mother in the film, which gives the distinct impression that Ungerer was a wild man bachelor until he met his later wife, with whom he moved to Canada, and then Ireland. It troubles me a bit that feels like such a thorough portrait and deals so much with children, sex, morality, and `the swinging 60s,' there's no touching on what his `first family' situation was like, or even that they existed.",1386201600,2,1761,4.902684563758389
8602934,4,B00E9B9P34,"I really, really enjoyed the first half of this.  The film is very intelligent, interesting and well-made, and Mr. Ungerer is sharp as a tack, not to mention very talented.  The story of his childhood in Alsace and experience of WW2 were fascinating.  His children's books look wonderful (I'm going to plunder the library for them), and his anti-Vietnam artwork was terrific, too.
Then we got to the porn.
The film shows an enormous amount of very graphic and, to my husband and me, rather disturbing and revolting pornographic artwork made by Ungerer.  He freely admits he's obsessed with women's naked posteriors, and a mind-numbing array of drawings of them are shown.  (Though those are actually among the tamest works.)  Maybe in today's art world, Ungerer's ""adult"" works would be considered perfectly run-of-the-mill -- but to us, this very intelligent and articulate artist suddenly became a dirty old man.  Maybe he is just more honest and less hypocritical than other people, but I wish he'd kept this material private.  Or, at the very least, why didn't he publish it under a different name, so as not to torpedo his thriving career as a children's book illustrator?  (And didn't his publishers have anything to say about this?)  Yeah, people would have found out about the porn eventually, even though this was at least 20 years before the Internet.  But at least the use of a pseudonym would have shown that he intended his ""erotica"" for a completely different audience and that he firmly compartmentalized it away from his work for children.  I think it was a terrible shame that (SPOILER ALERT) he was blacklisted for such a long time -- yet it doesn't surprise me.
We were thankful that the last third of the film (spoiler again)  dealt with more G-rated stuff like his exile, marriage, fatherhood and ultimate career resurgence.  It was a good ""palate-cleanser"" after all the porn.",1384128000,3,1898,4.909090909090909
