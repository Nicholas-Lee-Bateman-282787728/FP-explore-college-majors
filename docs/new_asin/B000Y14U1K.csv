This new copy is incredible and is one of my all time favorites of Miss Youngs.  I heard her tell the story of making the film several times and never tired of hearing it.

I am so glad that it has now come out and is available for people to buy, it is truly inspirational.",1196553600,3,494,4.114583333333333
3010744,5,B000Y14U1K,"Lorretta Young who was a great actor in her time made this movie in 1959. She always had a certain flair about her that made you feel that she was a kind and loving person. This movie is very Entertaining. Good old fashion family entertainment. In a time where moral values have run a muck it is great to watch a refreashing movie where sex and violence is not a hour and half long and the story plot is 30 minutes. This movie is about miracles and faith. Who couldn't use a few miracles in their lives. So don't wait any longer go ahead and order a copy you will be glad you did.

Miss Young is a powerful screen presence and is so interesting to watch.  She is beautiful and fashionable but cynical as the character of ""Alice"" in The Road to Lourdes.  In the other 3 programs she portrays ""Sister Ann"", a nun working at a busy hospital.  These characters are very different, yet she plays them  convincingly.

This DVD is going to become a classic and will be of special interest to the Catholic community as the Church is beginning a year long anniversary celebration of the Marian Apparitions at Lourdes beginning in December of 2007.

All the stories are uplifting and contain a moral message and the presentation is nicely done!  My friends and family enjoyed the DVD and are recommending it to others.",1196121600,3,832,4.729166666666667

3010758,5,B000Y14U1K,"What a wonderful addition to the Loretta Young shows on DVD!I had never seen ""The Road to Lourdes"" and I must say that is was just fabulous!

 Loretta plays a very different character than we are use to seeing. I loved hearing on the 'Special Features' how she fought to have this episode part of her weekly show when the sponsors pulled out due to the religious implications. The 3 other episodes include Loretta's favorite character from her series ""Sister Anne"". Although I recall watching her show with my mom as a child, many of these I didn't see, so it was that much more enjoyable. Don't pass this one by! It is a MUST for any Loretta Young fan. You won't be sorry...",1234828800,2,675,4.435483870967742
3010759,5,B000Y14U1K,"I really enjoyed this video.  Ever since I was a child and not allowed to stay up at night for the Loretta Young Show,I have been a fan.  As I recall her show was on at nine pm on Sunday night.  The only time I could watch it was when there was no school the next day.  But I slept upstairs and would creep down the stairs and listen to the show before going to bed! This really brings back childhood memories.
I am trying to collect as many of her TV shows on dvd as I can.  Hope that more will be coming out in the future!",1225411200,2,524,3.814814814814815
3010760,5,B000Y14U1K,"My knowledge on Loretta Young is pretty new, having found information about her on Wikipedia. I could not vouch for her work due to my very limited knowledge....until now. I wasn't very sure what to expect, so with great reluctance and a bit of trepedition did I bring myself to buy this DVD. And I am pleased to inform you, that I was not disappointed.
Ms. Loretta Young's work is so good that I can easily give 2 thumbs up for her creativity, acting AND her dressing. And, my...is she pretty!
The DVD has episodes from her classic show viz:
1) The Road : a story of a woman's self discovery and the rekindling of her dead faith at Lourdes, in the face of a personal tragedy. This show departs from her traditional 30 mins show (Its an hour long) and was re-released to coincide with the 150th anniversary of the Apparitions of Our Lady at Lourdes.
Episodes 2, 3 and 4 are about Sister Ann (played by Loretta Young), a Sister of Mercy in a hospital and how she has to deal with various situations with her co-workers, patients and her deep relationship with God. All these episodes are full of wit, humour, sacrifice and faith and with a deep moral behind it, and which will speak to young and old alike.
One particular aspect that I love is that the charachters here all potray the beauty of charity and selflesness, a much needed antidote to a selfish world.
In addition to these fantastic episodes, there is a treasure trove of extras including an interview by Loretta's son, ads from the 50's, a prayer to Our Lady of Lourdes and much more.
This is great for the family, for Church circles, Catechisms....you name it.

It includes a one hour special episode from the Loretta Young Show called the Road to Lourdes, plus three half hour episodes about a hospital nurse nun called Sister Ann. The Sister Ann episodes were especially my favorite! This is a beautiful dvd you'll want to see over and over again. No profanity, no nudity, no immorality.

Far better than what I've seen on some old tv shows.  I'm glad I watched it before going to the extras for the interviews. One interview gave a bit too much away.  It is very well acted, Ms Young was a pro and is solid in this role. The young boy was also very believable and his explanations and comments are very on the button to telling this woman why she should go to Lourdes.  Lourdes isn't only for Catholics and I thought this episode was very well done and did not fall into a set pattern.  I also found the three other episodes based on a nun Ms. Young had known, to be enjoyable half hours.  The nun was known to be a Sister Fix It and that's what she does on all levels.  Catholics especially, should get this DVD, but I would hope others would find it extremely well done and not a waste of time.",1205193600,10,957,4.058510638297872

Unfortunately, Mr. Lewis, her son, decided not to have the film restored.  This can only be for money reasons which is strange as she must have left them all very comfy.  I assume they are Republicans who feel no responsibility to the preservation of the past and that is why.  The other video/dvd packages he's offered are similar in quality--bad, grainy deteriorated film in need of restoration shot out of the production cannon.  Why Miss Young never oversaw their release in her lifetime is strange unless it was for vanity reasons.  I know she sued somebody way back for showing the reruns with her dated walkons intact.  I think she may have won and they had to extract them.  I still am a fan, but hope someday, somebody who cares will fix these poor films before they disintegrate.",1197072000,7,934,4.511904761904762

If you want the dvd, I'd strongly suggest ordering from another supplier.",1299196800,2,322,4.245901639344262
8230595,5,B000Y14U1K,"Having grown up in a family that never missed an episode of THE LORETTA YOUNG SHOW and having had quite a crush on the actress as an adolescent, I was thrilled when this was released on DVD. Considering the age of the show, it's in very good shape and the documentary features are very enlightening but it could have been a little easier to navigate thru the programs.  But the series' writing and excellent performances can't be diminished.  Wonderful.",1265587200,,453,4.7215189873417724
