8020779,5,B00022KM1I,"One of the funniest, most outrageous B-movies you'll ever see! I pity MetalMike for not finding the humor in this. Of course the acting is terrible and the plot deranged and the action scenes silly, but that's the humor in it. What's even funnier is that it may have been a serious attempt at making a decent movie. There are so many classic scenes it's so hard to know where to begin. The karaoke scene, the fight at the end, the three nearly identical montages and various points in the film, and the list goes on and on and on. This movie was far more entertaining than most of the crap put out by Hollywood. Again, if you can't find this funny, then I feel sorry for you... stop taking yourself so seriously! Jeez...",1524700800,,720,4.380597014925373

8020781,1,B00022KM1I,"Beware region 0 format! I couldn't play the region 0 DVD on any player but my PC. Having said that, the movie itself was incredibly bad! To be fair, I think it's a PSA filmed using a local police department's limited budget. It's sort of an elaborate home movie with no real actors or writers. Kind of like a Hallmark movie with a lot of unskilled fighting intermittently peppered with 70s sitcom tropes. You can see the whole thing on youtube as of this writing. It might be worth it to check it out there first.",1392854400,,513,4.354166666666667
8020782,5,B00022KM1I,"This groundbreaking film challenges the perimeters of greatness. Dwight Clark's skilled performance is unerring in its depth and sensitivity. His acting is synchronized with the multilevel intetrpretations of this cinematic triumph. It is astounding to witness his athletic prowess in the action sequences, and yet he is able to calibrate his performance to capture all the nuances of human interaction. As the curtain falls on this masterpiece, one is left in a state of awe and appreciation as our perception of the dramatic arts is forever altered.",1380412800,,551,5.344827586206897
