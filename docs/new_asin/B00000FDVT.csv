1211207,5,B00000FDVT,This has a a lot of Woody Woodpecker Cartoons with Woody celebrating Christmas. One of the best is Ski For Two where he pretends to be Santa Claus so he can get food from Wally Walwass ski resort in October. The ruse works until Wally sees the calender. All the others are good too. You should get this. Merry Christmas.,1410393600,11,320,4.35

1211227,5,B00000FDVT,"""Guess who?"" Woody Woodpecker and his gang from Universal's Walter Lantz archive are back to celebrate Christmas in another unprecedented, authorized holiday DVD! It contains 2 whole episodes of the (new) Woody Woodpecker Show, that really do have to do with Christmas, long before FoxKids kicked the bucket, including one that took up a whole half-hour show, which was never done again for that series. All the other shorts have been on DVD before; those being Ski For Two (1944, from Woody's original ""crazy days"", which had nothing to do with Shockapee, Minnesota, according to a joke in Pixar's Cars 1), I'm Cold (1955, starring Chilly Willy and Smedley, and directed by Tex Avery himself), and 3 shorts that were filmed in 2-strip Technicolor in the mid-1930's, due to Disney having the full rights to full-Technicolor at the time, and those are; Toyland Premiere (1934, starring Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, and Santa, and a host of Hollywood caricatures to boot, very much like Wax Works was from the Halloween disc, but this time in color), Jolly Little Elves (1934) and Candyland (1935), both of which had almost nothing to do with Christmas or wintertime. It's another great mix of Walter Lantz's archive of old and new toons, this time to celebrate Christmas! Ho-ho-ho-HO-ho; and a merry Christmas to ""all y'all""!",1445817600,4,1320,5.004545454545455

1211241,5,B00000FDVT,Woody Woodpecker is great! I'm dating myself but when I watch the old cartoons it takes me back to when I was a whole lot younger and smaller in size! I still get a kick watching them and wish that the young folks of today could watch them and get a laugh from the cartoons today.  There just isn't cartoons like this being broadcasted today and that is a shame.,1421971200,3,362,4.171428571428572

1211247,3,B00000FDVT,"Not a bad compilation, but a few too many new cartoons, which are by far the weakest of the group. At least they came at the beginning of the disc. My grandkids liked it & even they prefer the pre-1960s selections. Not enough, but worth the price of the disc.",1418428800,4,259,4.2
