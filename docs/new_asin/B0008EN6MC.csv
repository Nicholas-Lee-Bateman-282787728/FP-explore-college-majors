2257571,5,B0008EN6MC,Which was fun to watch. I love James Marsden. He is perfect for the part of the Inspector and the story is so much fun to watch it unravel. You have to like British Mysteries to appreciate it but I think you will enjoy the whole series,1402617600,,235,4.0212765957446805
2257572,2,B0008EN6MC,"I was so disappointed in this movie. The original setting in London would have been much better as well as the original murderer.  Marsden tries to give a good performance but the writers of the screenplay gave him little to work with.  That last scene with Dalgheish in the mud adds nothing to the story. Read the book, it is excellent but skip the movie.",1394150400,,356,4.461538461538462
2257573,2,B0008EN6MC,"To P.D. James devotees: skip this one.  Marsden makes an adequate Dalgleish but this awful plot adaptation is an insult to P. D. James and should have left him clueless.
The setting has been changed from an upscale London psychiatric clinic to an isolated island sanitorium and the cast of suspects focuses more on the inmates than on the interesting idiosycrasies of the professional staff.
I was disappointed with the first Dalgleish adaptation, Cover Her Face, and this one is far, far worse.  Only the efforts of the cast gives it my second star.",1360800000,,550,4.840425531914893
2257574,5,B0008EN6MC,Just as I expected from the author and the actor. Love all the episodes in this series. Will watch it over and over.,1358812800,,116,4.086956521739131
2257575,4,B0008EN6MC,"This entry from the filmed-for-TV versions of P.D. James offers a more physically active Dalgliesh (risen to Commander) and a less leisurely plot development, than in some of the earlier offerings. Some character development is sacrificed to time demands and the attempt to show that the (former) Inspector still has the clout of the Cop on-the-street he had once been. Nevertheless, despite these reservations, it is still a British treat, well worth the time spent viewing it.
A staff member has been murdered in a sanatorium for VIP's, their relations and for some British law enforcement agents who needed treatment. This latter element is not as fully delineated as it might have been, entering as it does, into the action of the film. Our perspective is (too) quickly narrowed to a handful of suspects, with the resolution, more hurried than we are accustomed too.
Good entertainment for British Mystery devotees, but rather less effective than some of the others based on James' characters.",1284249600,2,997,5.122699386503068
2257576,4,B0008EN6MC,"While the miniseries-length TV productions of the P.D. James Dalgliesh stories (e.g. ""Death of an Expert Witness,"" ""Shroud for a Nightingale"") provided more time for plot and character development, this 101-minute adaptation of ""A Mind to Murder"" exhibits far better production values than many of the earlier entries.  It's not the best in the series, but it's still great fun to watch for those who enjoy the British whodunnits.  Roy Marsden defined the lead character, setting a high bar for the fine actor Martin Shaw, who took over the role in 2003's ""Death in Holy Orders.""  Marsden's Dalgleish is a calm, thoughtful man who remains in control even while the bodies are dropping around him and the suspects grow weirder and weirder.  He infuses the character with a quiet but tough decency.",1221177600,11,796,5.007575757575758
2257577,1,B0008EN6MC,"I love British mysteries and detective stories. This story was OK except for the lead actor he is the dullest,corniest British actor I have ever seen. He ruined the movie by his presence.",1218844800,,187,4.696969696969697
