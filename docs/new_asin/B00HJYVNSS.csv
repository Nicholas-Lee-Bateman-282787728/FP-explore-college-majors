6167350,4,B00HJYVNSS,"One of the first criminal-geniuses in genre fiction is Professor Moriarty, the ever-present nemesis of Sherlock Holmes. The latter calls him ""The Napoleon of Crime"". Part of a successful Holmes film is how well Moriarty is portrayed. In this installment of the Robert Downey/Jude Law Sherlock Holmes film series, Moriarty is played by Jared Harris, a British actor and one of the best casting choices for the role to date. (Andrew Scott also makes a fine Moriarty, albeit a younger version, in the updated-modernized ""Holmes"" BBC series starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman.) Prior to Moriarty, few if any criminal-geniuses were portrayed in genre literature, and Conan Doyle's creation remains one of the best. (Later characters in genre fiction of a similar nature include the Joker, Mr. Ripley, Lex Luther, and Dr. Hannibal Lecter.)

The film is at first rather confusing. We learn there have been a series of unexplained explosions around London causing lots of carnage, dismay, grief, and fascination for Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.). A woman then carries a package to a wealthy older man attending an art auction, which turns out to be a bomb discovered by you-know-who. Inside the bomb-package is a letter addressed to a gypsy fortune teller who practices at a cabaret in London. During a bachelor party for Dr. Watson (Jude Law), Holmes intervenes to save the gypsy from an assassin. We don't quite understand the connection between the gypsy and the bombings until well into the film.

Holmes soon realizes Moriarty, who fronts as an Oxford professor, is behind the attacks, but he doesn't know why. He meets with the professor at his office at Oxford and there Moriarty claims he is intrigued with Holmes' abilities, the only reason Holmes hasn't been blown to bits like other lesser Londoners. They agree to engage in a chess match of sorts. Moriarty, in true Conan Doyle style, believes he will outdo Holmes. Thereafter, Sherlock and Watson meet with his brother, Mycroft Holmes (Stephen Fry) who indicates he will be attending a peace conference in Switzerland where the major powers will negotiate to prevent an international war. Eventually, as events plays out, the peace conference and Moriarty's scheming will intersect.

The typical devices of the first film are all here, particularly the slow-motion flash-backs and action sequences with Holmes' voice-over describing what's ""really happened"". Although much of the movie is probably not what Doyle had in mind, Downey still makes a splendid Holmes, always playing his character just a bit understated. Jude Law reprises as the straight-man Dr. Watson, although his character is not quite as well-developed as Martin Freeman's interpretation of the character in ""Sherlock"". Highest marks for Jared Harris as Moriarty who nearly steals the show. Despite some of the confusion at the beginning, it's enjoyable once the plot becomes clear.",1465171200,,2926,5.23454157782516

6167359,5,B00HJYVNSS,"These are classic movies (despite being overplayed on cable television networks).  Both movies together in one convenient combo pack for $13?  This is a great addition to our movie library.  I love Game of Shadows, good all around acting and Downey Jr's performance is excellent (IMHO).",1460851200,2,286,5.173913043478261

6167361,5,B00HJYVNSS,"We all know Robert Downey Junior by his movies in the MCU franchise, starting with Iron Man and continuing through most of the Avengers-related movies.  But were you aware of his starring role in a Sherlock Holmes movie franchise with Jude Law as his Dr. Watson?  For pure acting chops, I would say this latter franchise is a better showcase of the skills of Mr. Downey than any of his Marvel movies.  This package contains the Blu-Rays of both movies, complete with the standard special features such as trailers, cast interviews, etc...... though neither film has an extended cut.

The first movie takes place at the close of the 19th century, and the 2nd one picks up at the beginning of the 20th century.  Both films have a similar style and feel, in dialogue, settings, cinematography, action, costume design and mood.  Hence they can be watched separately or together, and the 2nd film, Game of Shadows, can be viewed before seeing the first one.  Both films are essentially action mysteries, with a touch of comedy, a dash of tragedy, and just a hint of romance.  Both films also feature ensemble casts, with multiple protagonists and antagonists, male and female.  Unlike the BBC series featuring Benedict Cumberbatch, these movies rely less on witty dialogue, and engage a lot more action... In a way, this is a more complete Sherlock, as they show a detective well-skilled in various martial arts, which is true to the books.  Like the BBC series, the plots of both movies focus heavily on political intrigue; with the first movie focused on domestic (UK) intrigue, whereas the second movie is set on the international stage of Europe before WWI.

Within the genre of spy movies, these two are considerably much better than the James Bond or Mission Impossible franchises as they whitewash and glorify the role of covert operations, whereas these two Sherlock movies are quite illustrative of European history in general, and British history in particular.  The first movie centers around a plot to take over the British government, with the plotters working out of a secret society who mask their actions with demonstrations of magic and spiritualism.  These themes are key to understanding the exercise of influence in Western history, with the name Aleister Crowley being an easy one to Google and learn about.  The second movie, Game of Shadows, centers around war profiteering, with the chief antagonist being Oxford don James Moriarty, who funnels money to terrorist groups such as the anarchists to have them bomb specific targets.  The ultimate aim is to start a European war in which all sides are using the newest and most expensive munitions, supplied by firms that Moriarty has invested in.  This storyline is actually the best revelation of WWI I have ever encountered, as it fundamentally goes to the heart of how the Great War started.  A scan of news headlines in the 20 years prior to 1914 reveal a string of terrorist attacks that usually targeted pacifist leaders who openly spoke out against a European war.  Many of these attacks were perpetrated by anarchists, or affiliated groups.  It is only later that investigators from various countries traced the funding of these attacks to wealthy financiers, many of them within the British aristocracy.  Overall, toth films are great, and worth watching more than once, which makes this a great purchase.",1459555200,9,3380,4.980427046263345

6167364,5,B00HJYVNSS,There are two movies here.  Both of the Sherlock Holmes movies that starred Robert Downey Jr.) and his trusted Watson (Jude Law).  Both are classic to me including adventure and comedy.  Well worth seeing many times,1458691200,,215,4.916666666666667

6167367,5,B00HJYVNSS,"These movies add a new and interesting take on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's characters. I enjoy a Dr. Watson who adds his own unique but outstanding skills to the pair, making a better team than either man separately. They also seem more human with their foibles and character flaws which adds to the depth of story that sets these adaptations apart from their wonderful predecessors. Dr. Moriarty as well becomes more sinister and lifelike in this pair of movies than in any previous Holmes film. As a whole it is great escapist film and stories well told.",1457308800,2,553,4.711340206185567

8633165,5,B00HJYVNSS,"Contrary to the ""import"" signification listed by amazon in the title for this item, this Blu-ray double feature contains the authentic U.S. versions of these two films. Shortly after receiving the pack, I had to stop by my local Walmart, and noticed the exact same double pack there for the same low price. There are no large circular ratings, as might be found on films imported to the U.S. It is the region A/1 through and through.

The movies themselves are fantastic. Solid acting, great writing, and that classic Guy Ritchie style. Picture quality on the first film is decent. Not much wowed me about this particular transfer, but there were some instances where tiny details popped and reminded you that you were watching a Blu-ray. The picture quality of the second film looked gorgeous. Textures were clean and vivid. Colors were slightly subdued, but that's normal for this style and setting. The picture quality for this disc was excellent overall, and I found no faults in the sound design.

This is a great way to get both films on Blu-ray for cheap, if you're a fan. I was hesitant to buy them because of the word ""import"", but am glad to say this is an error on Amazon's site. If you're still on the fence about buying it, just check out your nearest Walmart. Mine had several copies of this same pack for the same price.",1532390400,,1335,4.628691983122363
