5733794,5,B00CPTUMO8,This is an extraordinary story about brothers and fate. The music was ahead of it's time. The brothers form an inspiring bond. The story is told from the generations of this family. This is a beautiful story about beautiful people. This is the American dream. I will be a better person from having seen it. I was extremely influenced by this family's unwavering positive attitude. You need not be a fan of music to love this movie. Well done and God bless Death.,1372464000,,462,4.578313253012048

5733796,5,B00CPTUMO8,"This documentary is about a band called Death, but if you look deeper it's really about an artist unwilling to compromise his art.  I recently bought the album as well and the songs are great.  I hope people get the message and do the thing they love doing rather then the thing that will (maybe) make them rich and famous.",1370390400,7,323,4.366666666666666
5733797,5,B00CPTUMO8,"A friend in the music industry recommended this to me, and had highly recommended it so I decided to rent it, with reservation and I was pleasantly surprised. I had also read some non-amazon reviews on it and agreed with one reviewer in that the last half was the best part. It was solid. I laughed, I cried (really)! What a cool story.",1370217600,,336,4.349206349206349
5733798,5,B00CPTUMO8,"I too found out about this documentary via the Smodcast Podcast and could not wait to see it. It does not disappoint. I watched twice during the rental period and have told all of my friends, associates to watch it.  In many ways, it's about holding on to one's convictions and never giving up even when it may be to your detriment. ""Death"" hits on all cylinders, you'll laugh, cry and smile about the Hackney story!",1370131200,,416,4.473684210526316
5733799,5,B00CPTUMO8,This was a great documentary of an unbelievable story. Very touching with a perfect ending. So glad to have found out about it through Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier's podcast as Mr. Mosier is a producer on this movie.,1370131200,,216,4.564102564102564
5733800,5,B00CPTUMO8,"This was a great and touching documentary.  I can't help but think what it would have been like if Death had been embraced by the record industry without the want to change their name or David had given in at that time and the band had changed their name.  All the missing music!! That was the time and place with all that raw energy and ideas these guys had to be tapped!! It was really cool to see things come full circle for this family of musicians.  I can only imagine what feelings these brothers went through going back to that time without their greatest advocate.  I have also got to say that out of all places for this flower to bloom, Detroit in the early 70's it really is amazing..

As a person who grew up going to all those shows and listening to all bands of those years and the punk scene to come after it, hearing the Death album for my first time it warped me back to when I was younger. Knowing within seconds of hearing, that your going to like every track and that it would be a band you would want to get everything they have done and would be in your top favorites..  If you grew up listening to the punk and pre-punk music of the 70's and 80's and you have not heard their album For the Whole World to See, get it right now.. you won't be disappointed, other than after you wolf it down, you realize there is none left and that really sucks!",1369958400,,1366,4.15530303030303

5733816,5,B00CPTUMO8,"Wildly entertaining documentary that does a great job of capturing the feel of the times when Death began. The documentary truly transcends the ""Punk"" or ""Garage"" genre and should appeal to musicians and fans of almost all persuasions.

Perhaps the most lasting impression of the story was the deeply felt respect and kinship within the family. Even the younger generation playing in Rough Francis.

It's a moving testament to the power of love between a group of people. And a sad observation on the frailty of artists and musicians struggle through life as individuals...battling their own personal demons.

All in all though it's an exceptionally uplifting ride!",1465776000,,665,5.196261682242991

5733896,3,B00CPTUMO8,"I like their music and it's a good story, but I don't think the documentary was done well. It begins with the two brothers laughing in a front yard talking to two women who remember them practicing with their band Death. They should have started it off with the punk rock record collectors discovering the 45 or their kids discussing the band. It's also strange how they didn't tell their children about this band and why the reel to reels were never transferred to digital before their old 45 rpm was discovered. On the audio commentary, the doc makers say that they spent 3 or 4 years making this, but I don't see how it took that long. I also think it's wrong to say that they were the first punk band. They were the first black punk band. They should have mentioned that record collector Jello Biafra was the lead singer for Dead Kennedys. It's a cool story, but not a great doc. The extras weren't bad. The deleted scenes were as good as most of the regular scenes. You also get a concert, trailers, and two audio commentaries.",1452297600,,1032,4.436842105263158
5733897,5,B00CPTUMO8,"Just watched this on a plane ride home and was totally blown away.  Even if you don't like punk music, this is a great film.  The story is really inspirational.  If you watch it, you'll have a new favorite band",1451779200,,210,4.2
5733898,5,B00CPTUMO8,"There is the overused term ""groundbreaking"" and then there is Death where it is aptly applied because nothing preceded them that was anyway close to them.",1449705600,,154,4.961538461538462
5733899,4,B00CPTUMO8,"Was there ever another story like this?  I've never heard of one.

Incredible story.  Perhaps Alice Cooper was right, you had to be white to get recognition (or SUPER talented, like Hendrix).  These guys really were punk.  The movie was so poorly made, though, you don't have substantial proof of this until the movie is nearly over.  It's bizarre, but the directors don't include much of Death's music during the movie.  Also, the DVD extras are better than the feature film.  The final interview, with the manager of MC5, in the extras, was the best part of the whole DVD, and should have been used as the blueprint for making the entire film.  The directors were knuckleheads and actually did interview themselves in the movie.  In the right hands, the film could have been a classic.  The story is classic, the film kind of sucks.  Time magazine did an article on the band.  I haven't yet read it.  I need to get the album too.",1449705600,,931,4.5636363636363635
5733900,5,B00CPTUMO8,"Amazing story despite the flaw in fact re: whether Death was 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 10th on the scene. That's not really the point, is it? The fact that the name and their skin color was a roadblock that stopped them cold in the 70's, David's vision and demons, and what follows to the album release and beyond is the real story. Reminds me of another Detroiter (ie. Searching for Sugarman/Rodriguez) \ and makes me wonder who else is out there!!!",1449446400,,442,4.469135802469136

5733903,4,B00CPTUMO8,"Did you know that there was a black punk band in the 70s?  Even before the music was in vogue there was a black band called Death that created an eclectic collection of punk music.  The Hackney Brothers from Detroit had a mother that encouraged them to experience and let their creative juices flow.  As they began to learn more about themselves they discovered punk music.  They liked and enjoyed it but it was considered a taboo for blacks to join the flock of punk music.

David of the Hackney Brothers was a visionary he named the band Death after the passing of their father.  With the visual essence of their brother, David, Death begin to cut their teeth in the industry.  Despite the sound the name was so ahead of its time that it never caught on. David knew that Death would eventually catch on but maybe not in his lifetime.

Over a few decades later Death is a hit.  The Hackney Brothers are getting the credit that they are due.  They are now touring and joined by their adult children to keep the vision of brother David and Death alive.  This is a great movie and a must see.",1448064000,,1090,4.373134328358209

5733937,5,B00CPTUMO8,"This is great. I watched it twice back to back, and plan to watch it again when I show some friends of mine. If you've ever been a fan of punk or any of the underground rock scenes(especially if you came up in a ghetto where there wasn't really anybody else to share your interest) this will probably appeal to you. Three guys fought hard to stick with an ideal, sound, and name that the world really didn't know what to do with. The way the movie is shot and paced is really great too. This is the best documentary I've seen since Sugarman. Both stories are so crazy, it's hard to believe that they're true. Even if the genre isn't your thing, you should check this one out--this movie is great.

5733992,5,B00CPTUMO8,"A thoroughly enjoyable rags to rags story about a highly talented group of brothers (literally) and their attempt to make it in the music business on their own terms. Through first person interviews, old photographs and plenty of recordings, we get the full arc of the narrative, as well as the tragedy of their late singer-songwriter who motivated those around him to make this band a spiritual quest. In each chapter, the film makers provide context and background. Although many may argue about the claim of Death being proto-punk (as so many argue what punk itself actually was,) it matters little what label you want to stick on these gentlemen. What is undeniable is that there was talent, humor, conviction and a strong *love* of rock and roll that drove the guys to record what little they managed to get down. Alas, like so many others, they didn't reach those that could have propelled them further and their work was relegated to storage for decades. But like the cream that rises, the music eventually seeped out to welcoming ears, and it's the sequence of events from there that makes for a great story. Enjoy the music. Enjoy the tale.

5734171,5,B00CPTUMO8,"Even a very gifted writer of fiction would have a difficult time writing a story that is as unusual and inspiring as that of a trio of brothers from Detroit who formed a band that was named Death.  This particular band is not to be confused with a death metal band from Florida of the same name who was fronted by the tremendously talented and sorely missed Chuck Schuldiner.  One thing that both of these bands have in common other than their name of course is that neither achieved much in the way of commercial sales.  However, Schuldiner was able to gain considerable well deserved respect within the metal community over the years, even with a lot of those who didn't like death metal.  With the Detroit Death, that took decades.

  This documentary is basically split into two parts.  The first tells the story of the three Hackney (Bobby, Dannis, and David) brothers who grew up in a tight knit working class household.  Their father was a an electrical lineman who died heroically trying to a man's life.  This incident would touch all three brothers, David in particular, very deeply.  During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Hackneys developed a love toward the heaviest rock bands and artists of that time.  So, they decided to form their own band much to the disdain of both whites who thought only whites should play rock music and blacks who felt that blacks should only play rhythm and blues.  The eldest David played guitar, Dannis played the drums, and Bobby handled both bassist and lead vocalist duties.  The next job was to now find a name for the band.

  David who was still strongly affected by his father's passing decided to go with Death.  They took their music to every label they could find, but nobody in the 1970s wanted to sign a group who had the audacity to name themselves Death.  One of those people was the extremely well known Clive Davis, who liked what he heard.  To David, death was a means of physical and spiritual transition just as much as birth.  It was not about shock value.  However, neither side was willing to compromise.  David felt that if they gave in to label pressure and changed their name, what else would the labels want them to change? That would put him into conflict with his brothers who wanted to be rock stars.  Still, they were able to record a few songs, have several hundred 45s pressed, and have those 45s sent to record stores throughout Detroit.  After that, the band dissolved and moved to Burlington, Vermont.  From there, they would form a short lived Christian rock band named the 4th Movement.  Bobby would later become a reggae musician and meet future acquaintance and guitarist Bobbie Duncan.

  The second part is where the story really gets interesting.  Several of the surviving 45s found their way to music sharing websites.  People were asking themselves two questions, ""Who is this band?"" and ""Why have I not heard of them earlier?"".  Perhaps the strangest part of the story is that David believed that one day Death's music was going to live on even though everyone else, including his own brothers, gave up on it.  The only other recorded music from the band other than the 45s that were released was a cardboard box that contained some recordings, which was stored for over thirty years in the attic of their mother's house.  David would unfortunately die before he could see his difficult to believe words become fact.  Bobby had children who became rock musicians themselves and formed a group named Rough Francis.  They were blown away by the fact that their father and uncles were rock musicians also, and very good rock musicians at that.  With Duncan now in tow, both of the surviving Hackneys began the second chapter of Death.

  Even if I gave away many of the details of the story, my review is at best a poor summary of events when put into comparison to what the Hackneys themselves have to say.  That should in no way dissuade you from hearing the story coming from their mouths.  It should no doubt be surprising how a band with a name that on a surface level seems shocking could be so active with their church and committed to their families.  Unlike many documentaries involving rock musicians, the Hackney brothers speak with little or no profanity other than referring to a childhood prank involving ""p#$&-guns"".  Bobby's sons also appear to be very well mannered.  You can tell that they and Bobby have a mutual proudness about each other.

  In closing, I don't just recommend this to people who are fans of documentaries and/or rock music.  I recommend it to anyone who likes a story that seems too amazing to be true.  Watch it and be inspired.",1408060800,5,4657,4.6736453201970445

I think Jimi Hendrix would have had a hard time in the States also, but his invite to move to England and ensuing fame there paved the way for his success in the States.  David Hackney was truly ahead of his time.

And, right in ""my backyard"" were the Hackney Bros. - as I grew up in Rochester, 33 miles North of Detroit. Who knew?

This film is a really great and WELL DESERVED tribute to Death and of course the late Hackney brother, David. There were so many memories attached as I sat and watched this film; revisiting the old haunts - the streets of Detroit, that is now evolving into something totally new.

But these guys, WOW! I'm impressed. To see the young brothers on their grind, and now the new generation of Hackney's carrying tradition on - I'm blown away. I'm thrilled to see it AND I'm happy to know that they're carrying the torch.

The music is solid. Let's face it, these guys did Punk first. So, there is actually NO COMPARISON.That's just unfair to try to pit their great style of Rock against any other band that, of course, came AFTER Death.

Thank you for making this film, a fantastic tribute to a band that, although it was late coming, they certainly deserve it.

5734308,5,B00CPTUMO8,"A Band Called Death (Mark Covino and Jeff Howlett, 2012)

If you are still somehow half-convinced that there is justice in the record industry, and that what you hear on the radio is the cream of the crop from among the many thousands of submissions to record companies, here is the movie that will finally show you what things are really like. In the early to mid-seventies, Death, a band formed by three African-American brothers in the slums of Detroit, toiled in perfect obscurity for five years. They released one 7 single and recorded the masters for an album; they had been signed to Arista, and things were looking up. But then, the album never got released because Arista's A&R guy had a problem with the band's name, which guitarist David Hackney refused to change. As a result, Death were never heard outside one Detroit rock station who briefly played the single the boys had self-released, and they became a footnote in rock history that no one referenced... until 2008, when a copy of the band's 7 showed up on an Atlanta music blog, and all the sudden the Internet realized that these were the guys who invented punk. Before the Ramones, before the Pistols, there was Death, and they made some of the best punk rock you will ever hear.

But, as surviving members Bobby and Dannis Hackney explain (David died of lung cancer in 2000), being an all-black punk band in Detroit in the seventies meant you didn't fit anywhere. The white kids in Detroit were doing proto-punk (think Iggy here) and metal (Alice Cooper), but the black kids were Motown, Motown, and more Motown. And both of those worlds were turning out amazing music, but the idea of anyone crossing that line, well, that didn't work for anyone but David Hackney, and when he did, he didn't do Alice Cooper, he didn't do the Vandellas, and he didn't combine the two, he came up with something entirely different. (Though it should be noted that David, later in his career, would release a solo single whose B side is called I'll Be Your Doggie. That can't be a coincidence.) And the band killed it. You will hear the samples of their music in this movie and you will most likely be as amazed as I am that this music went unheard for three decades. Death should have been rock and roll royalty.

There are inevitable comparisons to be made with Last Days Here, though the boys in Death didn't have nearly as far to go when coming back into the spotlight; they still play music, when not working on Death, in a Vermont-based reggae band called Lambsbread. None of them took Bobby Liebling's express train to self-abuse, so when interest in the band reignited, in no small part thanks to Bobby's own sons (who, without knowing anything about Death, had formed a Bad Brains cover band in the nineties; punk does run in that family indeed), the surviving members were primed and ready for a comeback. And that is covered here, and it is as triumphant as you know it's going to be, but the real value in this film is the incredible history lesson these guys, and those around them, tell. The people who did become rock and roll royalty (or who should have, like the Dirtbombs) are all here singing Death's well-deserved praises, along with some other folks (Elijah Wood?) and talking about the climate of the time for those who weren't around, and for those of us who were around but too young to be dialed into the music world yet. (In 1973 I still thought my parents' Ferrante and Teicher albums were the bomb. But then I was also five years old.) This is about as perfect as documentary filmmaking getsthe guys behind the camera just get out of the way and let the people in front of the camera talk about the things they know and love the best, and the result is pure and utter magic.

5734311,5,B00CPTUMO8,"This is an awesome documentary about a great trio that essentially did themselves in by not doing gigs, naming themselves Death, and having a very talented, shy, and troubled brother for a guitarist. With that being said, labeling Death a Punk Rock band is 100% misleading. They were a good rock band, who did play fast at times, but also played Prog. Rock styles, and Psychedelic was mixed into their sound too. Death is everything the original Punk Rockers were against. And it's already been well established that the first Punk Rock bands were Iggy Pop & The Stooges and the MC 5. Those, by most historic accounts, are the first. But event they, Death included, don't consider themselves the first Punk Rock bands. The first one to do that was The Ramones. The documentary its self is very touching, well made, and something every music fan needs to own because this band should have been famous. The documentary omits however that Death, for the most part, never played a show at a night club. They played at a few house parties, but that was it. That right there is why Death never made it as Death. The other part is their name. If they would have changed it they would have been signed to Clive Davis' label. I'm glad they didn't because it's a touching reason as to why they named themselves Death. Give this documentary a try. You'll be finding yourself buying up their music that was released in 2009. And now Death is playing shows, touring, and writing new music because of their old recordings being unearthed, so go get a copy and support this awesome Rock N' Roll band!",1389657600,,1585,4.604240282685512

5734328,3,B00CPTUMO8,"Let me first say that I think this story is fantastic, as is the music of the  band. I bought their album in 2009 and was immediately taken with it. For music this good (at this kind of quality) to go unnoticed for 35 years...absolutely mind boggling.
However... nothing can ruin the enjoyment of a band like hype and inaccurate facts on their history...especially when people start buying into it and shoving it down your throat.
The story of the band itself is amazing, but this recent documentary (while mostly great) makes some statements that are simply not true....statements that seem to be passed around the internet a lot over the past 4 years, and a lot of people are buying as fact.
Death were not BEFORE the Ramones (as stated in the trailer), and were not ""doing what the Ramones were doing but 2 years earlier"", as stated in an interview by a member of the Roots.
While Death certainly predate the punk movement itself, they were one of MANY groups who were playing this kind of music in 1974...and I'm not even counting the Stooges and Mc5 from a few years earlier.
Along with the Saints, Dictators, Electric Eels, and Rocket From the Tombs, the Death story is just much more appealing to a mass audience.

As for the Ramones,
-Death established in the Spring of '74. Before that, the Hackney Brothers were a funk group called Rock Fire Funk Express. The Ramones formed in January '74
-Death wrote the songs on ""for the whole world to see' between Oct and Dec '74 (as stated in the record sleeve). The Ramones played their first show March 30, '74, and were playing CBGB's weekly by August. There's also documented audio of the Ramones from Sept 15, 1974.
-Death recorded ""for the whole world to see"" on Feb 18, 1975. The Ramones recorded their 15 song session with Tommy on Feb 2, 1975.

Personally I think both groups had totally different concepts and sounds.
....So you're probably wondering....why am I mentioning all this? Does it really matter?
Well, it certainly seems to matter to those who wrote it in the trailer, and it certainly seems to matter to the person who left in that dumb statement from the Roots guy, and it certainly seems to matter to those who can't help but write ""before the Ramones"" on every blog spot I see on the internet.
So, I think it's only fair to correct a lie when you see it.

Enjoy the story and buy the album though. The band deserves it.",1383004800,62,2394,4.547563805104408

5734342,5,B00CPTUMO8,"I thoroughly enjoyed the documentary, ""A Band Called Death."" As a long time fan of black rock musicians and bands such as Fishbone, Living Colour and 24-7 Spyz, the plight of the three young brothers who formed a band and played something that wasn't funk, jazz or R & B, their struggles were not surprising. The story itself, and how many years later their efforts were validated proved to be quite moving to me. Honestly, I spent the last half of the documentary wiping away tears; most of it painful sympathy but there were some tears of joy. I recommend this documentary because it's a strong testament to having heart, believing in your work, the creative urge and the strength of family. I'm also going to make sure to buy their album soon. This is one of the best documentaries that I've seen in some time.",1378166400,,813,4.575342465753424

5734353,5,B00CPTUMO8,"This is definitely one of the best music documentaries I've ever seen. It was so well done, going into depth about Death's history and background.

The story itself is so inspiring, whether you're a music fan, musician, or just human being. 3 brothers start a band at their mom's house in the 1970s, making some of the best proto punk you've ever heard. They didn't get the commercial success they deserved back in the 1970s, but their music is rediscovered recently. (I don't want to reveal too many details, since it will spoil it for you!)

As someone from Detroit, I felt personally connected to this story, especially as a fan of bands like The Stooges and MC5. Yes, Detroit invented punk rock.

I recommend this even if you're a rock music fan. You'll definitely appreciate how ahead of their time Death was.",1377561600,,814,4.678321678321678

5734355,5,B00CPTUMO8,"Excellent Documentary and very well put together Mark and Jeff.  What can I say, this was my husband David for 22 years and he deserves every bit of this acknowledgment.  We had our ups and downs in our life together, but I truly believe We're Going To Make It Together in Heaven, God willing!  David was a great musician and song writer, and has been and will truly be missed.  I just wish that he could have hung on a little bit longer so he could have seen his music come to life.  Thanks be to God and to everyone that made this music a reality. Love to the band, their wives and their families.  Couldn't have happened without you all!

5734373,4,B00CPTUMO8,"This documentary submitted by the USA for the 2013 Seattle International Film Festival lets us see a Detroit rock and roll band from the 1970s when Detroit was synonymous with Motown.

Directors Jeff Howlett and Mark Covino start with reminiscences of an idyllic childhood in Detroit: the Hackney family consisted of a father, a mother and six children. The father was an electrician and an important figure in their local church. The children swore fealty to each other, vowed never to fight and to always support one another. When the boys indicated an interest in music, Mom marched them down to the local music store, bought instruments and tolerated (to a degree) their music. (""Turn that music DOWN!"")

Their father is killed by a drunken driver, so when they form a band, the oldest brother, David, insisted they call their band ""Death."" Watch how this decision impacts their success and failure for the next 30 years; Clive Davis of Arista Records would have signed them if they would only change their name. You'll enjoy what happens when a demo 45 is discovered by a collector decades after the master tapes were left forgotten in an attic.

Expect no drugs, no sex, and a lot of rock and roll. Even though this type of music is NOT my preference, I found this to be interesting, informative AND entertaining. These are good folks! Get your DVD from Amazon and see for yourself.",1374192000,3,1388,4.775
5734374,5,B00CPTUMO8,"If you're an aficionado of punk rock and music history in general. Hate to bust the bubble of those who revere the Ramones as pioneers, I'm certainly one of them, but punk really started with 3 black brothers jamming in the attic of their parents house in Detroit. Watching this doc was like suddenly discovering that the world really is round. The music is undeniable in its power and edge. The message of the band is positive. Truly a standout. After seeing this doc I will never forget this band. LONG LIVE DEATH!",1373760000,,516,4.559139784946237
5734375,5,B00CPTUMO8,"I've often seen this referred to as a music documentary, but that is reductive.  It is incidentally about the music - which is amazing and ahead of its time, by the way. But it is more a story of family, specifically their unwavering support for David Hackney's artistic vision.  It's also a story of an unfulfilled dream, with an ultimate truth is stranger than fiction redemption.  Mark Covino and Jeff Howlett handle the subject matter with care and compassion, crafting a film that resonates and will stand the test of time. I can't possibly recommend this film highly enough.",1373500800,,580,4.838383838383838

Using only a few photographs from the past, and new interviews, they were able to weave together a pretty compelling story. The characters are likeable and the story will surprise and entertain.

There was a moment during the film where I felt like it should've been wrapped up already, but I'm like that.

The music is great, and since watching the film I've listened to the album many times.

5734378,5,B00CPTUMO8,"Death were a criminally under-recognized band, that much is indisputable. However ""A Band Called Death"" is a much deeper than just a rock-doc: It is an authentic, emotionally raw documentary about the power of love and a family that sticks together. The directors use minimal talking-heads, and instead move very quickly to the bittersweet story of the Hackney Brothers, their family, and the band Death. The film is well edited and unflinching; lending emotional resonance to an already compelling story; so much so that you feel like you are almost part of the family by the end of the film. If the makers of the film and the Hackney Bros had not put a tenth of the effort into this film that was used to make it, the documentary would still be an interesting piece of rock apocrypha; instead it is probably the best film I've seen this year and I say it deserves an Oscar. If you are looking for the antidote to the cheap, pref-fab pathos that Hollywood spits into our lap every summer, this movie is it. Watch it now! Then buy their album ""For The World To See"" and rock out.",1373155200,,1079,4.538461538461538

In this particular movie he is joined by an assortment of geeky, middle-aged record collectors, including Jello Biafra, who try to take credit for charging each other $800 for a 45 which ultimately leads to the release of an album of unreleased material by Detroit 70's rock band Death, the subject matter of this film.

8584781,4,B00CPTUMO8,Pretty good rock doc. I rate the actual movie 3 stars but I feel that David Hackney was a true artist and visionary so the extra star is for him. My only question is - wasn't this the band that the late John Belushi loved and tried to promote by having them as musical act on SNLs Halloween show back in the 70s?? The story goes that he and a couple cast members had to fight Lorne Michaels and other producers of the show to get them as musical guests because the name Death was universally unliked by those associated w/SNL.
