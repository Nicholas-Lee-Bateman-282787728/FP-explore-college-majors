5556873,5,B00B58FWYA,"Great Movie with the everlasting message of hope.  ""Ring the Bell"" will be an instant classic.  I am sure to watch this movie more than once.",1365552000,5,141,4.384615384615385
5556874,4,B00B58FWYA,"I am not really a reviewer of films but here is my quick synopsis after watching it.
The idea for the film was good, the main actor was good, and the first hour of the movie was good. Once it gets to the 12 minute worship session with Casting Crowns the entire flow of the movie gets disrupted. I like Casting Crowns but the scene was entirely too long which is a shame because this is a big turning point for the main character. After that the movie goes through every cliche in the book and all the potential seen in the first hour is wasted minus the pitching scene with the former baseball stars. The movie won't win over non believers like Courageous, Fireproof, and Grace Card will/has but it is a nice film for christians and is a better movie for kids than most stuff seen from hollywood. Overall a solid effort and I do recommend it... However I would rent it before buying.",1365552000,3,883,4.325301204819277
5556875,4,B00B58FWYA,This movie was filmed in my town and we had the honor of being extras. The cast and crew were so kind and friendly. My twins were ranch boys and filmed many days. Each day they started the day with a Bible study! The spirituality is evident in the film. Our church hosted the world premiere this week and we Loved the movie! It was fun to see people and places that are familiar but it was also wonderful to be a part of a movie that promotes Christ Jesus! I think you too will want to Ring the Bell!,1365206400,72,500,4.01

5556921,4,B00B58FWYA,It had a good story line but I wish it were more in depth with the feelings of the people involved.  To accept Jesus is a big thing and very difficult for many people to grasp.  I would have liked to see more of that difficult journey.,1465603200,,235,3.978723404255319

5556935,3,B00B58FWYA,"It's about a big city hot shot guy who gets stuck in a small town. While stuck there, he views life in a way he never thought of before and the ending is very predictable. While it was a good movie, the run down that I gave is pretty common for a number of movies. For this reason, it does not stand out from other movies",1459036800,,321,3.878787878787879

5556938,4,B00B58FWYA,"Sports agency owner goes to a small town to recruit a baseball player.  He is introduced to a way of life that he is not familiar with -- having faith in Jesus and knowing that all we need comes from him.  I enjoyed watching the movie.  Even though it was not hard to guess how it would end, it was worth the viewing.  It did leave me wondering if the agent's ringing of the bell stuck.  There could have been an epilogue or maybe there are plans for a sequel to show what work needs to do in addition to ringing the bell to stay strong in faith.",1458691200,,546,4.018518518518518

5556991,2,B00B58FWYA,"As a filmmaker, this movie frustrated me. It had all the elements to make a great movie, cameos by known talent in the christian community, a sincere story, crossover talent from the world of sports and sports broadcasting. This movie crashed, badly. I understand what the film tried to accomplish, but the directing was sub par, trapped, to guarded. They played so safe that the performances fell flat. Do you really need a 10 min concert in the middle of a narrative film? Really? The moral is there. A blind, deaf, mute could find it. But films should be entertaining, dramatic, inspiring. This film wasn't any of those. I wanted to like this movie. I really wanted to. But the poor storytelling is too much of a distraction. It left me disappointed.",1450742400,2,753,4.712121212121212

5557009,2,B00B58FWYA,"""Jerry Maguire"" is probably the gold standard for sports agent movies. One of its famous lines is ""You had me at 'hello' "". ""Ring the Bell"" had me at ""hello"". I care deeply about the aim of the film, but good intentions don't necessarily make a good movie. In this case, the plot is contrived and predictable, the characterization veers too much toward caricature, and the film's gospel leans too much toward the human side of the God-centered/human centered continuum. It had me at ""hello"", but then lost me. My favorite bits were the scenes with Ben Zobrist, John Kruk and Rick Sutcliffe, including the bell-ringing scenes. I think the bell-ringing motif is an interesting way to denote the joy when a sinner repents.",1446768000,,719,4.806451612903226

5557047,1,B00B58FWYA,"This movie was an embarrassment to Christians because it was hokie, poor writing, not humorous, and no real substance to the story.  It did not keep my attention.  I was disappointment because it was not at the same caliber as Unconditional and Courageous; they told a story in including Jesus Christ as Lord in a profound way.",1444521600,,327,4.719298245614035

5557307,3,B00B58FWYA,"This movie tried to incorporate many messages into its plot with some success.  The acting by some of the persons was forced and came across as to extreme (particularly the women that is the innkeeper).  However, other key players were much more believable in their parts especially the brother and sister, who ran an orphanage.  Which makes one wonder if it was a result of script or direction given as opposed to the skills of those playing their parts.

The sequence of events that lead a successful sports event to be stranded in ""Middletown"" seemed so contrived that I almost didn't finish the movie, however it improved greatly as the story progressed.  The sharing of the those running the orphanage as well as that of the Pastor, played by Steven Curtis Chapman were encouraging, informative and cohesive contributions to the primary plot.

I am not sure this would capture the attention of the lost, which is its target audience and that along with the other concerns are the reasons that 3 stars are awarded.

While I would recommend this as wholesome family entertainment (I have NO idea why Parental Guidance is suggested, when witchcraft is prevalent in cartoons and this was nothing a 4 year old hasn't heard).  I am not sure I would want to see it a second time.  That said, it delivered an uplifting message and that is more than you can say about 99% of the movies that are released.",1416960000,2,1400,4.704918032786885

I showed this movie to my tweens at church both boys and girls (which is really  hard to find something they both like) and they enjoyed it.  The boys can really relate to the cool sports car and the baseball, the girls really relate to the quirky bed and breakfast employee.  None the less, it was a lesson is seeing why giving your life to Christ is so important.  It also gave them a real example of what it feels like when your spirit is being poked and moved toward Christ.  It also taught the young people to stand firm on what they believe and not waiver, even if money is tossed your way.  There is no cursing, no nudity, no sexual overtones or anything crazy.

5557463,5,B00B58FWYA,Great movie about the priority of life. Focused on what really matters in life; God's purpose. Dispelled the lie that to be successful you have to use your talents for self.,1392940800,,173,4.612903225806452
5557464,5,B00B58FWYA,This is a really inspiring movie about how God's grace is able to give us a greater calling and purpose than whatever we think would be a better life without Him.  The acting is very genuine and the story models a great example of putting other people's needs above you own.  I highly recommend this film for all families to watch and discuss the theme together afterward.  Matt. 16:26,1392249600,,385,4.550724637681159
5557465,1,B00B58FWYA,"I normally don't write reviews however I don't want any one else to make the same mistake I made from the other reviews. This is one of those Christian movies where the acting is fair to poor. The plot  was weak. My children claimed the purpose of ""the bell' was not well developed.  The female  character who works the desk at the inn where the main character stays is down right dumb. Her character added nothing to the story, in fact it detracted from it. Part of the story has the main character going to a concert. Well that's what you got ... a concert. This part of the story was way too long and unfortunately the point of it (the concert) appears to be just to have this musical artist in it. Can't wait to donate this movie to the library or trash it. Sorry but really was hoping for a nice movie to watch with the kids.

5557471,5,B00B58FWYA,Ring the Bell is a wonderful movie that brings the message of life is more than wealth of fame or money. This is a story of real people living in community of true living. What I enjoyed was not one profanity was spoken. The start was just a tad corny on the character Decker displaying ego all pumped up but it still deserves 5 stars. Powerful message delivered swith amazing love.,1389744000,,382,4.394366197183099

5557489,2,B00B58FWYA,"Before I say anything about this movie, I think it's important to say that people watch movies for different reasons and their reviews of these movies are impacted by their motivations for watching them.  I bought and watched this movie in the hopes of being encouraged, edified, and generally pointed to Christ in the same way that I was when I watched ""Fireproof,"" ""Facing the Giants,"" ""The Printing,"" and ""Sheffey.""  Needless to say, that didn't happen.  Other problems for me with this film included bad acting that was a distraction in and of itself, and an unrealistic and unbelievable story line (it just didn't seem real), and immodest dress worn by the main female character. The main character didn't seem like a real person at all.  His conversion also didn't seem realistic.  This movie just missed it's mark, I think, but I appreciate the efforts of my brethren to give it a try.  This one was slightly better than what I have seen in general on the Christian movie market these days, which is why I gave it two stars.",1386374400,12,1031,4.7

So, the actor, director or the script folks put their heads together and found a way to get the hero going I the right direction and gave him some honest-looking humility and goodness.  It is a good movie that you don't expect to get good if you just watch the first 10min.

Give it a try.  Worth it in the end!!",1370131200,,427,4.379746835443038

5557587,5,B00B58FWYA,"I found out about this film from a posting by Mark Miller, lead singer of country-rock group Sawyer Brown, which I've been a big fan of for years, ever since their discovery on Star Search.  Beyond just being a talented singer and songwriter, Mark is a devout Christian who wrote and produced ""Ring The Bell,"" which I just had the opportunity to view.

Basically, it's a story of a successful, big-city sports agent who goes to a small town to recruit a talented young high school athlete, but ends up finding a whole lot more.

While it admittedly does fit a formula and doesn't offer any huge surprises or shocking plot twists, it is a warm, human story about values, priorities and faith.  The most refreshing part of the film is that the main character isn't a ""bad"" guy with a melodramatically destructive lifestyle (drugs, alcohol, etc.) that he needs to be saved from, but simply a man driven by worldly goals rather than godly ones, which helps drive home the message that we ALL need Christ's love and forgiveness.

If you appreciated other Christian films like ""Fireproof"" and are looking for others to expand your DVD library, you'll definitely want to check out ""Ring The Bell.""",1368921600,66,1190,4.729468599033816

5557589,5,B00B58FWYA,This film really uplifts you to the truth of how to be happy in this fast paced society we live in. We need to focus on our youth but we cannot do that without personally giving ourselves and everything we have to God.,1368748800,,218,4.093023255813954

When he is sent to a small town to sign a high school baseball player (who doesn't want to go into the pros yet) he finds that there just may be more to life than he thought and maybe he really doesn't have it all.
 I found this movie to be rather enjoyable. At a PG rating it is something the whole family can enjoy and you don't have to worry about language and such.  I really enjoyed the setting of the small town and find it sad that it so hard to find a community like that anymore. A community where faith and family mean more than money and careers. I loved the music in this filmed, but that is in part because Casting Crown stars in it.

5557620,5,B00B58FWYA,"This is an absolutely wonderful film. It is moving,touching heartwarming and uplifting. It follows a commonly used thread of big city boy coming to a small rural town and finding out that life is not all it seems. His selfish motives and wealth obsessed  lifestyle clash with values of the people he suddenly finds himself with. Their values are not his and he struggles to understand why. He is with people whose lives are directed by the calling of God and he has to discover that God""s calling is the highest calling of all. Their is an immensely powerful scene where the gospel is shared by the group Casting Crowns. It is the perfect scene for presenting the gospel to teenagers and young people. This is a film which speaks of God""s forgiveness,grace and mercy. It also speaks to the emptiness that so many find in their hearts today,an emptiness which can only be filled by Jesus Christ. This film is an amazing presentation of the gospel.it goes far beyond being a sports themed movie to an introduction to the life changing power of Jesus Christ.",1367625600,,1055,4.672043010752688

Overall, I enjoyed the film. Some of those involved are clearly more comfortable being onscreen as an actor than others, but no one was just horribly bad. I also grew tired of some of the more extreme quirkiness of a couple of the characters. I realize that it is standard to have those characters populate all small towns in films, but sometimes they go a bit beyond quirky. These complaints, however, are trivial matters in my overall impression of the film.

The story line was good and was presented in a way that is palatable to most. There is no blood, violence, bad language, etc. to make it unacceptable for family viewing. The gospel is presented, but I feel this is more a film that gives the viewer a look at how following Christ has made an impact on the lives of the characters who are believers. Most of the people I know live out their faith like these people, so it was all familiar to me. Would I show this film to family and friends who are not believers? Yes, especially those who love music and/or baseball. I also recommend it to people who are believers and want to watch a Christian worldview film that both entertains and demonstrates the validity of living out their faith and following God's will.
Btw, I LOVED the whole concept of ""ringing the bell""!! It is a perfect example of Matthew 10:32-33.",1367366400,2,1754,4.65483870967742
5557625,5,B00B58FWYA,"About Ring the Bell:

Ring The Bell shares the story of a slick, big city sports agent Rob Decker who seems to have it all. But on his latest mission to sign a high school baseball superstar, Rob becomes stranded in a small town where the simplicity of life--and the faith of the people--stand in stark contrast to his own fast-paced, win-at-all-costs mindset. Torn between these two worlds, will Rob have the courage to let faith transform his life? This heartwarming story of redemption is sure to entertain and inspire the whole family.

Ring The Bell features a host of well-known Christian music artists, such as Mark Hall along with his band Casting Crowns, Steven Curtis Chapman, and Matthew West, all who play a role in this inspirational drama. Several former and current Major League Baseball all-stars are also featured in the film: ESPN analysts John Kruk and Rick Sutcliffe (a former Cy Young Award winner), along with Ben Zobrist.

This family-friendly movie was produced by Mark Miller, Beach Street Records' founder and Casting Crowns' producer. Miller, who is also the lead singer and founder of country music group Sawyer Brown, co-wrote the script with Thomas Weber and Weber directed the production.

My Review:

 First of all, an amazing film! My family and I enjoyed it so much. It is a great movie with an awesome message. Money and riches and the best career in the world should never take the place of a relationship with the Almighty. Rob Decker a sports agent on a mission seems to think he has this one in the bag. He will talk this young man into signing with him and the agency he represents and he will turn around and head back home. But this little town and the people who live here give him a look into the ""real world"". A world he didn't realize he would want to be a part of.

 This is a very endearing film one that is sure to stir things up in your family. It is for young and old alike. It applies to all of us. So there is definitely a lesson to learn in this one. My sponsor has been so gracious as to give a copy of the DVD to one of my readers. So please enter below!

5557626,5,B00B58FWYA,"I love it when I find a movie that really speaks to your heart deep down inside and creates such a lasting impression, you find yourself thinking about it long after it's over. That is just what you'll find in the latest movie, Ring The Bell available on DVD from Provident Films. Ring the Bell is a calling to those individuals who still don't know what they are looking for in this world, but know that no matter what they have tried so far, it doesn't last. This is a calling to come to know God, in your own time and in your own way.

Ring the Bell is about a prideful and self confident big city sports agent Rob Decker (Ryan Schaeon), who believes there is nothing he can't do or no one he can't sign. He represents the ""best of the best, because he is the best of the best."" He believes he is truly on top of his game as the owner of Decker Sports and all those who work for him should have the same attitude and motivation. When he locates the next ""big thing"" with small town high school student Shawn Hart, he is more than confident that he can get him signed. He is challenged to get Shawn Hart signed when his associate tells him he can't leave tell because of his son's game. So he heads up to Middletown to show his company's employees that he's still at the top of his game.

However God's got other plans for Rob Decker. When his car breaks down and he has to spend some time in Middletown trying to convince Sean Hart that his future awaits with a simple signed contract that will change his life. But the more time that Rob spends in Middletown, the more the town and it's residents begin to grow on him in ways he never dreamed or imagined possible, from the perky inn keeper, Maggie (LOVE her personality and quirky way of seeing positives in every little thing she does), to the loveable mechanics that will fix Rob's car once they figure out where the engine is!

The best part about this movie is the powerful message of grace and what it means to make the decision to come to know God in your life. Those that do, get the chance to Ring the Bell and let everyone else know about it. With Christian artists like Steven Curtis Chapman, Casting Crowns and Matthew West adding to the cast, it really makes the movie family friendly. Even notable baseball athletes Casey Bone, Ben Zobrist, John Kruk and Rick Sutcliff are part of the action. This is HANDS DOWN one of the best movies I've had the opportunity to watch and review with my entire family and they agree, it's a family favorite in our home now!

I received Ring The Bell compliments of  Provident Films and Flyby Promotions for my honest review and received no monetary compensation for a favorable one. This is one YOU won't want to miss out on. If you love movies like Fireproof, Courageous and Facing the Giants, pick this one up. Already people are talking about this movie and how it is changing lives forever. This movie is perfect for all ages and I would encourage everyone to check this one out. 5 out of 5 stars in my opinion and that means not only do I highly recommend it, but it's one we will undoubtedly will watch over and over again. It's the perfect movie to share with those struggling to make their own decision to accept Christ and who knows may in fact Ring The Bell in their own time.",1367366400,,3288,4.3225283630470015
5557627,2,B00B58FWYA,"The good- this is a cute wholesome story of a self centered sports agent who goes to a small town and meets people and experiences events that change his life.  Clean, no vulgar language or nudity so it's a story that is safe for everyone.  The formula Is predictable but not a bad thing.  It has a few funny moments.

The bad- it's a Christian movie that is supposed to have the gospel in it.  Unfortunately, I was expecting the true Gospel but instead I was met with an Americanized, mushy and ""feelings"" based presentation of the Gospel that left a lot to be desired.  They present sin as brokenness that needs a healing.  While that is true, it is not the whole story.  Sin is a offensive rebellion to God in which its punishment is eternal hell, but to my recollection, Hell is not even mentioned in this film, and neither is it being offensive to God.  The movie says that Jesus is knocking and we just have to answer that knock and let Him in.  Sadly, they portray Jesus as this poor man that is begging for us to let Him in when in reality it should be us who should be begging God to forgive us.  Casting Crowns' lead singer Mark Hall did a better presentation of the Gospel but it still sadly fell a bit short (and I am a CC fan).  Overall, the Gospel was not fully presented like it is in movies like Fireproof or Courageous.  It is presented in an inoffensive soft manner which doesn't make the person aware of the seriousness of sin and therefore sell short the Glory of Jesus sacrifice to forgive us of that sin if we come to Him in Faith and Repentance.  For this, the movie fails in my opinion.",1367280000,92,1610,4.270627062706271
5557628,5,B00B58FWYA,"Let me begin by saying this Provident Film is well worth 5 stars! Not being a sport fan I almost dismissed this multi talented movie (including Steven Curtis Chapman, Marc Hall and his Casting Crowns and a cameo appearance of Matthew West). I only noticed the baseball feature (oops, sorry, not a fan!) and I would have missed so much!

An amazing family movie with a beautiful message guaranteed to inspire even the most supercilious amongst us, Ring The Bell follows the engaging plot of the successful CEO and President of a sports agency whose mission is to sign up potential sports stars and of course make more money.

This time however he faces a young man who has already decided on a different path, that of becoming a doctor and wants none of the gifts and big contract Rob offers him.
Stranded in town, Rob attends a baseball match and discover amongst the players a face he has not seen in many years, possibly a bigger fish for his company to lend. But God has other plans!

What follows is an eye opener for Rob who can no longer deny his life could be much more rewarding if only he has the courage to accept Christ in it!

Two notes of interest in this special feature movie are first of all, the small part of the local minister played by none other than Steven Curtis Chapman. Welcoming Rob to town he tells him the story behind the quote on his church's billboard:
'He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose'.
For those familiar with 'Beyond the Gates of Splendor, see my review (HERE), it was like a bolt of lightning as I heard Steven's reminder of this unbelievable message of love and forgiveness!
'Faith...Because they believed, they gave it all...'

The second part was the talented Marc Hall and his Casting Crowns featured in concert in the little town Rob finds himself stranded into. I had never heard the group before and was so enthralled, listened to the video over and over! 'Come to the Well's amazing message will leave you wanting more!

I received this DVD free from FLYBY PROMOTIONS as part of their blogger review program. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC 16 CFR, Part 255 'Guides concerning the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising. I was not asked to write a positive review and all opinions expressed are entirely my own.",1367193600,,2323,4.5587529976019185
5557629,4,B00B58FWYA,"Don't you just love to see a jerk get turned around?  Ring the Bell is one of those movies.  Rob Decker is a big city sports agent who has built an empire for himself on the backs of talented sports players.  He's ruthless, slick, and pretty obnoxious.  Fortunately, he has a secretary who's not afraid to stand up to him.  In Ring the Bell, Decker finds himself stranded in a pretty little town that is Maybury perfect.

The mechanic assures him that he can walk from one end of town to the other in fifteen minutes; so, having no other choice, that's exactly what he does throughout the movie.  I found it amusing to see this dressed to the nines fast paced fellow slowed down to a comparative snail's pace.  Sometimes slowing down is exactly what we need to think.

The townspeople are warm, friendly, sometimes funny, encouraging and overtly Christian.  In fact, this movie has the clearest, most direct, presentation of the gospel of Jesus Christ that I've ever seen in a movie.  There is no dancing around the J word.  I really liked that.

So, will it be a movie to show to unsaved friends and family?  Yes, I think so, especially if they're music or baseball fans.  Casting Crowns provides terrific music.  The baseball scenes show some amazing pitching as well as featuring prominent, real life stars.
 This is a really good movie. We'll watch it again.

Five stars.",1367020800,,1375,4.6115702479338845
5557630,5,B00B58FWYA,"I was chosen to watch this movie by FlyByPromotions and I have only one word to say about it: WOW!!  My husband and I decided to do a family movie night and even had a friend over to watch it and we were amazed at the story.  Why can there not be more movies like this in theaters these days?  What a blessing to see normal people do extraordinary things!!  We loved it.  I'm not going to spoil it all for you, but when he walked out of the theater when Casting Crowns was playing, my heart ached, but I felt the Lord say ""I have a time and a place for all things"".  We might not understand and might get so upset when friends and/or family members we are praying for don't listen or don't get it.  But God has a plan for everyone's life, and sometimes we just need to learn to wait on Him for the things to unfold.

Amazing movie - great for all ages, and especially those who love baseball, small towns and funny things.  Let me tell you, the guys at the ""repair shop"" and the hotel lady are ones I will not forget.  Some people say God isn't one who likes jokes, etc., but as God inspired the author of Proverbs in Chapter 15, verse 13 to write, ""A happy heart makes the face cheerful"", and this movie for sure worked well for His glory in that!!",1366934400,,1249,4.081967213114754
5557631,5,B00B58FWYA,"Ring the Bell is a beautifully done movie in the tradition of Facing the Giants, Fireproof, and Courageous.

After watching this film, my wife and I have decided to get our own bell so our neighbors will have the opportunity to Ring the Bell!

5557634,5,B00B58FWYA,"The beginning of this movie started slow, so we weren't sure we were going to like it. We were pleasantly surprised when it quickly became an engaging, wonderful movie filled with the salvation message. Some faith-based movies feel preachy, but in this movie, the salvation message was completely natural. The characters were living their beliefs. The Casting Crowns concert with message was wonderful, and we found out by watching the special features that it wasn't scripted - at all. I love that! Steven Curtis Chapman did a nice job as the pastor in the movie. You could tell that the actors in this film were passionate about its message.

Ring the Bell is a wholesome, family-friendly movie that packs a punch with not only sharing the gospel but also displaying the importance of priorities and following the Lord's will in our lives.

Disclosure: I received a copy of this movie to help facilitate the writing of a frank and honest review. A positive review is not guaranteed, and all opinions are my own.",1366761600,3,1013,4.8497109826589595
5557655,5,B00B58FWYA,"In this heartwarming Christian story , a man who is an aggressive , high power sports agent tries to convince a high school baseball star to forgo attending college and allowing the agent to take him to the major leagues. What Rob Decker does not understand is that the people of Middletown have devoted their lives to following the path that God has shown them. Rob learns that he cannot change the mind of Shawn, the young baseball player.

Rob has always put his career and company ahead of God and family, and it is not until he visits Middletown and the Cook family that he understands that he is missing something very valuable in his life. His visit to Middletown is life changing as Rob finally , through prayer, accepts Jesus in to his heart and rings the bell.

The importance of the bell ringing is that the person ringing the bell is showing others that he has allowed Jesus into his heart and life. As you will see in the movie there is such rejoicing with the decision by the others in the story.

This movie shows the importance of priorities in one's life. Where are your priorities? Are you a workaholic? Do you constantly put work in place of going to a child's sport event or concert? Do you pray and ask God for forgiveness and then allow his grace and love to enter into your heart and life?

I believe this movie will help you with thinking about all of these questions and more. It is a movie worth taking the time to view.
