3804919,4,B001UV4XFQ,"Eclipse may be a good movie. The books certainly are but I must say I was very disapointed in New Moon. That was suppose to be the Jacob Black movie but it was not. The relationship between Bella and Jacob was missing. Where were all their carefree days out riding their bikes in the woods and just enjoying each other. 50% of that movie was still about Edward (my Love) but this was where Jacob was to have
his movie.
There is alot of book hours to fit into the movie Eclipse but I think it will work.
Breaking Dawn, I have no idea how they will fit all that action into one movie.",1273276800,4,582,4.114035087719298
3804920,5,B001UV4XFQ,"The Twilight sage Eclipse book was really great. I couldn't put the book down for a second. I betting the movie will be really great too and a lot of people will go to see Eclipse Maybe 2 to 4 times. The cast will be really great and you will probably be on the edge of your seat the whole time you are watching the movie. And you might be on the edge of your seat when you read Twilight sage Eclipse Book.
you all will probably will read Twilght sage:Eclipse book over and over again. As you will probably see the movie over and over again too.

Sadly the potential of his character rediscovering his sexuality with Edward and the other characters wasn't really explored, leaving me un-SATISFIED with the experience overall and disappointed.

3805955,1,B001UV4XFQ,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!! Do not BUY ANY AMAZON VIDEOS unless you intend to purchase a new television every year to keep up with Amazon's unscrupulous and fraudulent business practices.",1465948800,2,1188,4.8088235294117645

3806121,4,B001UV4XFQ,"I bought this movie for my girlfriend because she is a book nerd and has to read the book before she sees the movie so it makes sense. She doesn't always say the book was better. Sometimes she likes the movie better. In this case, she thought they complemented each other. The movie follows the book closely. It has to condense some for time allowed, that why so many movies are cut up in two parts these days. The YA genre is full of paranormal romance. This story was a refreshing spin off the usual formula of teen angst with supernatural/futuristic elements. I have to say, that I watched it too and while I wasn't as engrossed in it as my girlfriend was, it was easy to follow, well-written, and had a strong leading player. I recommend this movie whether you have read the book or not. I am not team Jacob or Team Edward, but if you are team Jacob, you'll be happy with how much of the wolf pack is in this movie.",1458000000,4,919,4.257142857142857

My review, however, is about watching the video through Amazon, or rather, trying to.  I have 75 mbps internet at my house, and with NO ONE else using the internet, my brand new Sony HD Smart TV and my decent lap top both kept stopping to buffer and load, and most of the HD video was NOT HD.  (I might have rented the HD one, but either way...) almost immediately it says ""due to slow speeds we'll switch to SD instead of HD so the playback isn't inturrupted"" or something like that, which means a super fuzzy picture, even if you try to pause it to allow it to buffer, it's no use.  Very disappointed with the playback, and FURIOUS you can't just download it and watch it somewhere else. You HAVE to watch it on Amazon... so I wonder, .... did I BUY this movie, or permanently rent Amazon's movie??? Needless to say, I will NOT every BUY another Amazon movie.",1444262400,,1047,4.381443298969073

3806553,2,B001UV4XFQ,"I watched this with my mom to keep her company. I liked the books when I read them. In High School. But since then, I've lost interest in abusive relationships like the one featured in Twilight. Edward and Jacob are manipulative and violent and immature (especially for a 200 year old vampire; Jacob is just a normal teenager I guess). They don't really seem to respect Bella so much as enjoy her like a caged bird. When Bella wants to exert some control over the relationship (by initiating sex or asking to be turned into a vampire) Edward holds all the cards and doesn't give her what she wants. When Edward wants to marry her first? Better believe he gets that.

Also, just as a general movie critique--why the hell would you want the climax to take place without the characters? Sure, that's the poor writing that Stephanie Meyer offered (battle sequence where the main character does something useful? Or camp scene where the character snuggles with her not-boyfriend? Boring snuggling it is!) but why keep it in the movie itself??? Change that!

BUT, all that said. it's not the worst thing you could watch with your mom or friend or whoever that likes this series.",1437004800,,1172,4.684466019417476

3806904,2,B001UV4XFQ,"As a Adult male I have always been inquisitive why this movie/books attracted so much attention. I also enjoy a variety of vampire and werewolves movies. I am not afraid to enjoy a ""chick flick"", as this and all of the five movies are the targeted audience, females that is. So I didn't mind taking a chance. My review will apply for all five movies.  A little less drama on the love scenes, could have been implemented, and the fact it wasn't is a reason these movies get a low rating! Its hard to find a critic who knocks the special effects and action scenes. Very well done.  If the over whelming over done drama love scenes were shortened, but yet still proving the back bone of this movie, it would have been perfect. I can not give it a one rating simply because i have scene worse movies, and the special effects/action scenes and suspense was well done.",1426896000,,862,4.415094339622642

The main characters' acting in the first movie was fairly horrendous, but, either it improved over the course of the five movies, or one just becomes used to it.
Recommended for those who viewed them in the theater, (because you know what you're getting); less recommended for avid Twilight Series book fans who haven't experienced these movies.",1425772800,,472,5.038461538461538

The rating it purely because the Bluray I purchased has the DVD on one side the Bluray version on the other and no special features except commentary on the DVD side. I bought this for my wife because it was the only movie out of the series she didn't have but I still may be on the hook to repurchase with features we shall see.,1418428800,,473,3.9894736842105263

3807764,5,B001UV4XFQ,I saw these movies with my granddaughter when they were in the theater - didn't like them. My granddaughter and I are avid readers and were having discussion on classic literature favorites with myself upholding the older novels. Her answer to me was the Twilight series would be among those novels which I smirked a comment about the movies. She reminded me that I could not have an honest opinion since I didn't read the books. I read all four and watched all five movies again and I must say - she is totally correct. The movies and acting skills of all the actors represented their book character beautifully.  I now understand why so many of our younger generation went vampire crazy.,1407715200,,689,4.647540983606557

3807809,5,B001UV4XFQ,"I never had the time to get into the Twilight series when it first started.  I was too wrapped up & had years invested in the Harry Potter series which was beginning to wind down, both books & movies. But once the last movie was released I could move on...  So one day wondering around my local used book store, there was a box of all the Twilight books, hard bound & paperback,  several copies of each in both formats.  So for $4 I bought an entire set of the hard bound & for $2 a set in paperback too. (Such a deal!)
And of course, I was hooked.
So naturally next came zipping on Amazon & buying all the movies that were out so far on DVD, & seeing the last movie in the theatre
 (3 times) & getting in line at midnight  to buy the last couple movies when they were released on DVD. So you know it's a great, unusual story / series.

3807868,3,B001UV4XFQ,It's ok just remember it's fictional. We prefer movies with meaning  or taken from life such as Taking Chance. Yes cute series however the cost of this series why won't a studio take those funds do another mini series like The Bible or what we will be facing soon when power grid goes offline and food and medical care is lost. The real life we are about to face so those with head in sand will be ready.,1406592000,,404,4.17948717948718

The books were better in my opinion but that's because I read them before the movies came out. The movie was great in its own right.,1406073600,,274,4.288461538461538

I teach Adolescent Literature (PhD candidate in Children's & Adolescent Literature), and cannot believe that feminists everywhere aren't having book burnings of Meyers' work. Bella is a helpless female who can only be saved by the Alpha males in her life, who fight over her as though she is a piece of meat.... Her father is a nincompoop, and her mother is a mindless bimbo...which doesn't give her much of a model aspire to, I guess. Oh...and don't get me started on the mess Meyers made of the vampire mythology..... When vampires can shine like diamonds in sunlight, I guess it's okay if they sneak in and stand in teenage girls' bedrooms and brood over them.... Yech.",1402963200,,717,4.744

3808149,2,B001UV4XFQ,I loved the story line of this movie but the acting wasn't the best. When I read the books I imaged Edward and Bella to be more relaxed towards each other but instead they were very tense and dramatic. But don't get me wrong the movie was  appealing for the eyes when Jacob strutted around shirtless. (K.M.),1399161600,,307,4.385964912280702

3808854,5,B001UV4XFQ,"**SPOILERS**
Eclipse is the end of the love triangle (as far as im concerned anyways) between Edward, Jacob and Bella. Eclipse: as usual these movies aren't about any sub plots, there about  whose going to get the girl. By the end of Eclipse.. and for that matter by the end of New Moon its Very clear that Bella has only got eyes for Edward and Jacob is chasing his tail (pun intended) still trying to win her love. Sure, sure there is the side story with the ""newborn army"" but thats all it really is, just a side story, a tie in, a little more plot.  However this movie is very cool and earns 5 stars as we get back stories on Many Characters (they should have done this on BD#2) The question of who Bella will end up with is over and a new segment of this story starts (the proposal) and two more movies to show us how that new story line pans out.  Eclipse is a good movie, the story changes and there are real developments.  Yes its a little cheesy, but i cant get enuff of this cheese.. how sad is that.",1374624000,,1010,4.137755102040816

3809189,5,B001UV4XFQ,"Eclipse answered a ton of questions and just as the previous two movies gave more incite into the less savage account of Vampirism while at the same time showing that not all vampires were loveable, cuddly  beautiful darlings - this movie seemed to go well indepth at showing a kinder and better werewolf - and why they were not so much a creature to be dreaded as all previous movies had portrayed them but actually a protector of sorts. And in it's zeal to be the protectors of humans, would even work with ""good"" vampires (their actual sworn enemy) in order to protect the humans if they had too. Never mind the fact that Jacob Black had grown from a cute young boy to a very beautiful and very loving young man who co-incidently also loved Bella Swan as fiercely as his rival Edward.

I loved the fact I wanted Edward and Bella together, but at the same time I wanted that same perfect joy and love for Jacob. I believe I was feeling as conflicted as Bella was obvious feeling - even though there was no doubt from the very beginning it was as Bella said - she loved them both, but she loved Edward more.

I loved all the action of Eclipse, I think the best of all the movies - the protections they provided Bella - the big battle and exposing the fact the Voltori were not quite the good Vampire Law makers they pretended to be - but were selfish and self righteous pigs. I have to say I learned to purely detest Jane from the prior movie and again saw  my detesting of her grow when she could have prevented any battle with the Cullins, and chose not to - so it did my heart good to see her again miffed by the Cullins coming through what she wanted to happen to them and what actually did happen. It further confirmed my detest of Jane and the Voltari, when they handled the situation of the remaining ""newborn"" in the manner they did - as if she was not satisfied unless she always had the final word and showed her ""power"". (Kudos goes to the adorable Dakota Fanning - who I actually love to pieces - and her very right on performance of the ruthless Jane.  She allowed me to hate Jane, while still truly adoring her real sweet self. Now that was acting perfection).

Needless to say the end of this movie left me compelled to see the next movie even though I knew in my heart it would be the ""forever after"" fairytale ending it deserved - I truly wanted to see that big wedding and enjoyed the fact knowing Bella had left all details in very capable hands. I was also curious how this would all be handled by Jacob who had left no doubt at all in the fact he truly and completely loved Bella.",1367366400,,2602,4.267748478701826

3809400,3,B001UV4XFQ,"Yadda-yadda-yadda, just more of the same tedious flirtations that of course lead nowhere.
The opening sequence is indicative of where this series falls apart......as once again we are maltreated to the same nonproductive argument that is neither cute nor particularly interesting.
""Marry me.""
""Marry me.""
""Change me.""
""Marry me.""
""Marry me.""
Literally, that was the extent of their scintillating conversation.
Worse, instead of moving the story forward, they're stuck in time, battling flashbacks and old history with that persistent vamp Victoria (sad to say, I didn't even notice that Bryce Dallas Howard had taken over the role from Rachelle LeFevre).  Her time on screen barely allowed her to stand out (although she was given a bit more to do this time than just running/zipping through a forest being chased by every brother and his dog).
At this point, even the supposed triangle is nothing more than a foregone conclusion.  Trying to jazz up the competition at this late stage is nothing more than a show of desperation.  I'd say it was perfectly obvious that Bella only has (shark) eyes for Edward.  Why bother with the pretense?  Even when the boys were snarling as they verbally fought over that vapid idiot, Kristen Stewart just stood there all dead around the eyes, incapable of delivering one shred of emotion.  She has no expression other than one of extreme monotony.  Flat as a cardboard cutout, it's a pity such an essential role was wasted on an actress who clearly cannot act.
If it wasn't for the fantastic battle sequence, I'd say this movie was a total waste of time.

What hurts this series the most was the miscasting of Kristen Stewart.  I still cannot believe/accept that all these people are willing to die for that empty-headed ninny.  She clearly doesn't have what it takes to inspire that much devotion.",1365465600,,1834,4.9640522875816995

I kept seeing advertisements, pictures, toys and all sorts of stuff for this movie but could never understand the draw to it, another Vampire movie big deal..So I asked my 22 year old son about it. He said it was a romance movie and not much on the blood and gore, that picked my curiosity. Lucky for me, a few days later they had Twilight, New Moon and Twilight eclipse on cable to advertise Breaking Dawn 2 to DVD. So I turned it on expecting to turn the channel with in a half hour, boy was I wrong!!!  I sat through the whole movie with my heart pounding, no vampire here. LOL... I found it to be a very addicting love story between a girl and her family, vampire and his family, werewolf and his family and how they all came together .  It felt a bit like Cinderella but she actually had two prince charming, one a vampire and the other a werewolf.. Both with a few wicked step sisters and brothers thrown in, to make it interesting... I really liked this movie and all the the rest of the twilight movie...

3810526,4,B001UV4XFQ,"As always, I liked the book better than the movie but at least I could tell- even in a 30 second TV spot- where the ""changed"" bits related to the book. Adding Riley's backstory was a nice touch. I'm not sure who was the ""best"" actor/actress this time out but I liked everything about Nikki Reed's delivery on her role as Rosalie from her telling Bela about her last human days to the fight training and battle scenes. The big battle barely resembled the book version but at least it was better than the Edward/Victoria-Seth/Riley mini battle which wasn't very good at all, shot on a set didn't help it at all. Bryce-Dallas Howard or Rachelle  Lefevre as Victoria?, not sure who's the better choice there.
The movie does look good overall and should at least ""get by"" for most fans, those new to Twilight will find plenty to watch even if you don't know all of the backstory.
 When I bought my copy of the ""special 2 disc edition"" of the DVD I also bought the Blu ray Amazon listed below it. Don't make that mistake- it has none of the extras the DVD set has.

But like all movies, they are limited to what they can actually do on film.  It was well executed and entertaining, and while I would definitely watch it again, there is no substitute for one's imagination, which is always better than the movies.

3810970,1,B001UV4XFQ,"Ok. I'm not a teenager and I'm not so into the goth vampire scene as I might've once been. I DID enjoy the first Twighlight movie. I found it's cinematography to be stunning and gorgeous, and I found the story somewhat interesting.

This movie...well, maybe I'm just too old. It was not interesting at all. The beauty of the first movie was lost. And it feels like a simple teenage drama, full of drama queens and angst.

Sorry Kiddos. Not the best.",1355184000,2,449,4.463414634146342

3811042,3,B001UV4XFQ,"The book was my favorite...and I had hoped the movie would be too. But since the movie wasn't like the book- it wasn't. The movie gives the impression (I felt) that Bella was trying to decide whom to choose. In the book you know that Bella choose Edward from page 1 and that did not waiver.

For that alone I should hate the movie. But I won't.",1354579200,,344,4.134328358208955

3811093,3,B001UV4XFQ,"As a crucial part of the Twilight saga, Eclipse is a necessary addition to the film series.  However, I think most viewers will find it a bit slow and plodding compared to the emotionally charged Twilight and the action-packed Twilight: New Moon.  Eclipse spends more time on character histories and internal character development than the other stories in the series, which means that except for the final fight scene, it lacks excitement.  I didn't mind watching it--the story is still compelling--but it's not my favorite of the five movies in the series.",1354233600,,558,5.043478260869565
3811104,5,B001UV4XFQ,This movie was awesome. Kristen Stewart is an incredible actress and her beauty does Bella justice. I would highly recommend it.,1354147200,,128,5.142857142857143

3811106,5,B001UV4XFQ,"There was so much more action and suspense in this 3rd installment plus all the characteristics that i loved from the earlier features -  that I had to give it 5 stars.  When  you keep getting surprised in a positive way, that is a big accomplishment particular in these ""sagas"" of multiple movies that are part of the same storyline.  What makes this so compeling to me is that the characters were well developed and interesting and there were no lose ends. Given that there were two more parts to the saga to come,  I felt this one ended without a frustrating cliff hanger that would lend itself to an agonizing wait for the next installment a year later.",1354060800,,657,4.487394957983193
3811107,5,B001UV4XFQ,I loved this movie...for Twilight fans it just continues the story and allows the viewers to see the charachters developed more. I plan on purchasing the entire series on DVD/Blue Ray after they release the final movie from the theatres.,1354060800,,237,4.95

I will say that I was wonderfully surprised, after not watching any of these movies before and watching them all now; that the stories were told in a very entertaining way without super sexualizing, gory kill detail, or foul language. YEA!  The PG13 is a match, in my opinion.",1353974400,,465,4.523809523809524

I would recommend the movie to everyone if quality was better",1353801600,,145,4.84
3811225,5,B001UV4XFQ,"The first 2 movies in the series build up to this one.  In the first Bella falls in love with Edward and there begins a feud with Victoria after Edward kills her mate, James to save Bella's life.  In the second she begins to love Jacob after Edward leaves her.  Bella finds out that werewolves exist and that Jacob is one of them.  But she still chooses Edward and the beginnings of a feud with the Volturi start.  It is in this film where the feud with Victoria reaches its apex and the feud with the Volturi goes to the next step.  Bella is very indecisive about who she loves more Edward or Jacob.  Victoria creates an army and with the help of the werewolves they defeat Victoria's army.  Bella finally makes a final choice between Edward and Jacob.  Of course she chooses Edward but reveals that she is not just choosing him but his world.  Despite all the bad things that come with it Bella lets Edward know that is where she knows that she belongs.  This is the most interesting of the movies because it combines both the love story and the feuds that the characters become engaged in.  This film is part of the climax of the whole series.  The other part of the climax, the one involving the Volturi, only reaches its apex in part 2 of Breaking Dawn.",1353801600,,1258,4.347639484978541

3811403,5,B001UV4XFQ,"It's rare for a film execution of a novel to be anywhere close to being as good as the written tale. It's almost unheard of for a film to outshine the book that inspired it, but with incredibly insightful direction (aided of course by an excellent screenplay and solid performances from the entire cast), David Slade has done it with Eclipse. Though I've now read all the books in the Twilight saga, I'm far from a "" Twi-hard""; I did find them reasonably entertaining, though a bit tedious and tiresome: a lot of mental thrashing before a final culmination. Eclipse was the best of the bunch and I feared its ruin once transformed to cinema (remember how Curaon destroyed HP3?), but not to worry: Slade's thorough grasp of character and story, and meticulous attention to detail makes Eclipse the movie a great roller coaster ride from its grisly start to its finish. Bella is never more likable than she is here, saying her ""last"" goodbyes to her Mom, enduring ""the talk"" with her dad (played brilliantly by Billy Burke), torn between her obsessive love for charismatic Edward and her overwhelming affection for volatile but oh-so-warm-and-vital Jacob. Standout scenes are numerous, but in addition to those aforementioned, some highly memorable moments include Jacob showing up in the school parking lot, Bella meeting the wolf pack, the Cullen's prepping for battle, Jasper's  story, and the snowstorm scene, especially the exchange between Edward and Jacob, and, of course, ""the kiss"". With action and romance, spookiness and suspense, this one has something for everyone--including a kick-bu** soundtrack!--and can be enjoyed even if you haven't read the books.",1351900800,,1666,5.102564102564102

hearing them speak as themselves, get their thouhts on the film. But the
entire segment depicted them as giggly schoolchildren. They made constant
sarcastic, disparaging comments about practically everything: the story itself, the acting of other characters,
everything. I came away with the feeling that they thought the story was just stupid. I wanted to like these actors. I came away disappointed in these 2 people, whom I had admired so much in the films.",1343088000,,664,5.10091743119266

First off, the characters are not believable.  Every time Edward says EXACTLY the right thing that Bella wants to hear, it just doesn't seem realistic.  Sorry, ladies, but no man is that perfect.

The best way to look at this movie series is almost soap opera-ish.  It's all glamorous, over the top and just not very believable.  Don't get me wrong, I don't expect realism from fiction.  But I still expect well constructed characters with strengths and flaws.  That's really that main issue with Edward.

3811649,1,B001UV4XFQ,"The story line is 99.9% ""romantic tension.""  Silly me; I was expecting another Vampire movie. In summary: a gal who can't make up her mind (no surprise, what does one really know about love at 18) and the two guys who vie for her love but compromise to keep her safe together.  This is probably a wonderful story line for female tweens (12-14 yrs) but that's about the extent of its' appeal. It never got off this one-dimensional storyline that had a strictly female perspective (vacillation, and then more vacillation, anyone?).  The best line in the movie:  ""Doesn't that guy own a shirt?"".  That Edward voiced that thought aloud to his gal speaks to the new sensitive male that is what women are looking for these days - guys who wear their heart on their sleeves and all that.  A shirtless Jacob (Taylor Lautner) is a great piece of eye candy, that's for sure!  But not enough to overcome the insurmountable fact that this movie tells no story remotely interesting to anyone but very young, starry-eyed females.

3811843,4,B001UV4XFQ,"Whether you are thirteen or ninety-five, there's no doubt you have heard of Twilight. And if you have bothered to read the books or see the films, you have already decided whether or not you love or loathe the franchise. Eclipse is the latest in the film series...

If it is the last thing she ever does, Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard) is going to make Bella (Kristen Stewart) pay for the death of her mate. The spirited, fiery-haired vampire is no match for the local band of werewolves and vampires who protect Bella, so she takes matters into her own hands and recruits Riley (Xavier Samuel) to assist her in raising an army. In the meantime, unaware of the danger, Bella is caught between her immortal potential lovers -- the physically cold but romantic vampire, Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the warm-blooded, spirited shape-shifting werewolf, Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner). While she is devoted to Edward, the rift that it has caused with Jacob leaves a hole in her life, an emotional gulf at the fact that the two young men cannot come to terms. Torn between her intention to leave everything she knows behind and become an immortal, but knowing that will separate her from Jacob forever, Bella faces a new series of choices and situations when it becomes apparent that her life is in peril.

Considered one of the most popular franchises of our time, Eclipse is the best film in the Twilight series. With a new director comes a much larger scale outlook on the production, with picturesque settings and breathtaking views. There are a few more battle scenes this time around and subtle attempts at humor. The acting still suffers from occasional stiffness, but many of the sequences have an additional charm and it's nice to see some of the back stories and histories of individual characters. Here, we visit Rosalie, Jasper, and the first shape-shifter's past, as well as encounter more of the Italian vampires that made such an impression in the second film. Bryce is a worthy replacement for the previous Victoria and lends a bit of sass to the film, which still relies heavily on the romantic triangle but does branch out into some good arguments for why Bella should be cautious in her decision. No doubt these will not sway devoted fans from one opinion to the other, but for a undecided like me it tended to send me in a shall we say, wolfier direction.

The flashbacks are done well, and the musical score is great. The only real complaint in terms of filmmaking that I have is early action scenes are so rapidly shot and cut that it is difficult to tell what is happening. There's also an extraordinary amount of close-ups. For long time fans it is solid improvement on the success of the previous two films. I was sorry not to have seen more of the Cullens as individuals, but their limited screen time did provide some further insight into their characters, and the audience is introduced to some of the names and faces that become important in later incidents. While I might take issue with some of the underlining messages (more prominent in literature than on film), I do have to applaud this series for its stance on abstinence and its decision to respect the ""outdated"" notion of marriage. At one point, Edward says the divorce rate between vampires is far less than humans. It's a life-long commitment (or in this case, eternity) that is taken with the utmost seriousness.",1332892800,,3397,4.744500846023689

3811845,4,B001UV4XFQ,"The version I received actually went back because it was the Canadian version of the film with English and French on the DVD case. I may have been biased after receiving the DVD and being annoyed about that, but the quality also seemed sub-par. I watched a few minutes and it was very dark. We had rented the movie not too long prior to purchasing and I don't recall it being that dark. I think I'll just spend a little more and get it locally.

Overall, great move and series, my wife loves them all so far.",1332633600,,508,4.237113402061856
3811846,2,B001UV4XFQ,"In my opinion, Eclipse (the movie) is by far the worst depiction of the corresponding book than the other movies in the series. Now this is not to say that viewers may not find this entertaining because to some degree, whether you read the books or not, you may not feel it COMPLETELY sucked... It does have a lot of action to take away from some of the suckery so... there's that, but aside from the fighting action that took place, the movie fell VERY flat.

Now I will breakdown it's suckery. SPOILER ALERT! WILL NOTE WHEN SPOILER ENDS.

Information given in the movie lacked further explanation...
If you never read the books and only watched the movies, some parts in this movie will NOT make sense. Case in point, Jacob's reveal of him being the rightful Alpha! There was no explanation on how that was even possible! At least, as far as the movie goes. Then there's Jacob insisting that Bella has some hidden feelings for him but the movie lacks evidence of the connection even though in the book/s, Jacob and Bella spent a whole lot of time together. In the books, Jacob and Bella's relationship is very well developed. What the movies (both New Moon & Eclipse) never showed that was actually in the books was the endless amount of times they hung out together. They held hands quite often and even Bella mentioned how from a far, they would seem like a couple based on how close they were. Bella would notice Jacob in a way that went beyond a friendship, especially when Bella had Jacob over one time and she kept focusing on his bare chest, which prompted her to ask him about him never seeming to wear a shirt. Now a lot of people who may watch the movies probably has no idea the real reason why Jacob doesn't always wear a shirt and it has nothing to do with his body temperature nor do it have to do with trying to impress Bella. Ecplipse (the movie) doesn't show that scene at all and cuts to Jacob leaving Bella's house. This was a necessary scene to put in there because not only would it have given a valid explanation behind Jacob's topless moments but also it would've shown some understanding as to why Jacob was insisting that Bella has hidden feelings for him. Which brings me to the famous ""kiss"" scene between Jacob and Bella. I kid you not, EVERYBODY in the theater with me, when that scene came about, did a collective confusion of ""WHAT???"" I don't even have words for how cheesy they made that scene be. In the book, it was a slow burn that Jacob hinted around that made Bella realize what he wanted from her. She was reluctant at first but he talked her through it and got her to relax enought to give into the feeling and when she finally did, she saw the future she could have with Jacob, going as far as seeing herself having his children! (That must've been one heck of a kiss;-) The movie doesn't show any of this. You don't know what she's thinking in this moment so the movie lacked a connection in that moment.

Now that I said all of that, I'll now mention the bad acting...
Now when I say bad acting, I really mean Jacob's character. This is not to throw salt on Taylor Launter because he seems to be a decent guy but his acting in Eclipse made me feel like he should've been a villian in Batman (the cartoon). I don't think Taylor Launtner can play a cocky character... he's just way too sweet. So his 'bad boy' comes off animated and exaggerated instead of confident and cocky, which is why the bad acting took away from me getting into the story.

Another issue I had was the phasing of the wolves...
I don't know if they just got lazy when working on Eclipse or if there was new people working on the CGI wolves and didn't know how to make it as detailed as it was in New Moon, but it was poorly done. In New Moon, you could literally play it in slow motion and see the transition from human to wolf in both Jacob and Paul. You could see the wind move through their fur whereas in Eclipse, the wolves phased like a coat was quickly thrown on them and all the wolves looked almost similar in color. If you didn't see New Moon, then you may not realize how much it sucked but if you did then you may see how the wolves in Eclipse are lacking. But hey, you may not care about that.

END OF SPOILER ALERT!

So, here's my pros and cons...

Pros...
Action is good.
Overall, visually appealing.
You may appreciate secondary characters more in this movie.

Cons...
Lacked explanation for non-book readers.
Bad acting.
Bad CGI.
Lacked chemistry amoung some characters.

Recommendations? Read the books... even if you think it'll be complete suckery.",1332547200,,4584,4.408983451536643

I thought the film was as good as its predecessors until I listened to the audio commentary with Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart.  It is quite revealing about how their relationship has developed since their commentary with Catherine Hardwicke for Twilight.  The pair are so funny together that I have listened to them just for the laughs they provide.  They discuss In-And-Out Burgers, their hair/wig problems on the film, Canadian shawarmas with excessive hot sauce and all manner of inane stuff.  But it is all discussed with such warm comraderie amd humor that I really enjoyed listening.

So, on to Amazon I went...and picked up all of the Blu-Ray releases thus far. I hate to admit it, but these movies are mesmerizing. The acting is just so-so, the story is a little convoluted and to top it all off the friggin vampires sparkle in the sunlight. All that being said, you really can't help being drawn into this world and these characters. The movies may lack a little when it comes to vampire lore, but the whole package somehow just works.

the books better but as movies go these were pretty good.  Don't compare the books to the movies and just sit back
and enjoy the slightly altered storyline.  They are still good and I enjoyed them.  Will watch them again all at one time in a movie marathon with my grandkids and daughter when I go to visit them the next time.  And yes I am

Can't let go anymore, ordered the books, ordered all the movies there are and following everything now very closely.

Feel a little embarrassed because I'm a 35 y/o woman that is totally hooked on the characters (book as wel as the people portraying them on screen) and keep rewatching  over and over and over again. I actually feel a bit empty inside when I'm done watching, so I start from the beginning again haha!

I love the story, the special effects in the movie, it's just such a great big love. You shouldn't overthink it all too much. I know people are saying well how stupid is that, she has to die in order to be with him, he is too protective and overbearing. But don't look at that. Look at why she wants to become a vampire and why he acts around her the way he does. It's their love. And that love is amazing and I would wish for everybody in the world.

As much as I've enjoyed the books, I have to say that screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg's scripts have given us the best, truest version of Bella and Edward's story, along with that of the amazing Cullens and the werewolves.

Take my word for it that this movie is a must-have. You will not be disappointed with all of the action and drama it has to offer. Of course this is speaking from a female point of view. :-)

One more thing, I think that a lot of people have issues with this movie because of the immature behavior of Bella. You have to realize that Stephenie Meyer's wrote this novel to target the age range of 12 to 17 year olds. So of course older more mature people will have issues with the storyline. I am almost 38 years old but I still remember how I behaved when I was in my teens. All I have to say is great job Stephenie Meyer's, wish I had thought of this movie.

3812156,2,B001UV4XFQ,"I stumbled on to the Twilight series in the 3rd installment, so I had much to catch up on when viewing the movie with a friend who had seen it several times.  I bugged him throughout the movie:

Q. So who's this guy with the eyebrows, and why is he wearing so much makeup?
A. He's the hero - a vampire.  He needs to look undead, thus the makeup.

Q. A teenage vampire for a hero?  I guess he must be a ""good"" vampire, then?
A. Yes, he's a good vampire.  He and his coven fight bad vampires.

Q. But what does he do for food?  I mean, doesn't a vampire's dietary requirements pretty much drive his moral character?
A. No worries -- the good vampires have managed to become vegetarians.

Q. Very progressive.  So what's the deal with this other kid who can't keep his shirt on?  I mean, he's definitely ripped, but it's a bit gratuitous, even in a movie like this.
A. He's a werewolf.  He takes his shirt off when changing form so that it isn't ruined.

Q. But what about his pants?  They always seem to come back somehow.
A. Maybe they're made of Lycra or something stretchy.
Q. No, watch: he's a wolf right now - no pants.  Now he's turned back into a human - pants.
A. I don't know what to tell you.
Q. And what about this female wolf?  Somehow both her shorts and top conveniently reappear.
A. Maybe they needed to keep the movie in PG territory for demographics, okay?

Q. I will grant you that.  One final question:  Why are these two guys practically killing each other over this girl?  Aren't there any other women in the Pacific Northwest?  She's not especially pretty, and always seems to have a sneer on her face.  What gives?
A.  She's the female lead - take it or leave it.

3812255,3,B001UV4XFQ,"Overall, another miss for me with this movie series. I should point out, I haven't read the books so my opinion is based soley on what is on the screen.
It was a let down for me, in two major areas. First area, the characters were a downer. I didn't burn for them, I wasn't captivated and riveted to the screen. In fact, the only character that I found compelling was Taylor Lautner's performances. Added to this, that the ""bad guys"" didn't come across all that bad. I wasn't repulsed or made afraid by them, and I feel I should have been. That's why you have the ""bad guys"", because they are really bad dudes. It's what helps with the conflict and tension of the story. Now, to be fair, this lacking could very well go back to the author of the books and not to the director or scriptwriter.
The second area that I found lacking, was the visual portrayal of the story, which I also had an issue with on the first movie. Make-up bothered me again.
I'd watch it again just for Lautner, and to be reminded how not to tell a story, but that would be about it.",1325289600,,1056,4.232673267326732

The special features is as good as the movie.

It was absolutely fascinating to see how they did the special effects to make this movie. I found myself saying wow! as I saw how much work was involved to make this movie.

I also enjoy watching the extended and deleted scenes because it gives you an idea of what could have been included but wasn't.

What amazes me so much about these Twilight movies is that each one has a different director but the movies continue to just pick up and keep going as if the same person was directing. You also get to hear what the actors think and how they feel about each director.

Each special edition also gives the viewer an opportunity to sort of get to know the directors for each movie and to see how much they interacted with the stars and the entire crew.

There is an audio commentary with the two stars Robert Pattinson & Kristen Stewart and also an audio commentary with Stephenie Meyer & Wyck Godfrey.

The documentary on the making of this movie will keep your eyes glued to the screen. I enjoy watching this movie and the special features over and over again.

The entire Twilight Saga Series is great.

I had to actually separate the knowledge I have of the original novels in order to even half-way enjoy the first two movies.

3812383,1,B001UV4XFQ,"I don't really understand how these movies can draw out so much money, and yet they're just completely dumb. I guess when you have a self-centered tween-age girl and a few shirtless men and ""vampires"" that sparkle, I guess thats your box-office win in a nut-shell.

I had went to see the previous movies that followed before this, and had hopes that something would change about these fake vampires that sparkle, but it looks like all most people can do right now is wait till this Twilight phase ends. As quoted from Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine ""Twilight Is Cat-Nip For Fraidy-Cats!"" The dialogue in the movies are gawd-awful, and I have not seen acting this bad since Bruce Springsteen's first divorce. This is the most sanitized vampire movie you'll come across.

Like I said: how these movies really are succesfull in the box offices, 1 can only wonder. Here a few vampire movies I do recommend, but then again, they might be too realistic for anyone going on the Twilight-only initiative.

Last notes if you have an older model blu ray player you might need to update your firmware because the special edition is dual layer and has a lot of extras that may not play correctly with older model disk players, just something to keep in mind.

3812603,4,B001UV4XFQ,"In trying to catch up to all the hype and anticipation of the newest Twilight saga (Breaking Dawn, Part 1), I've decided to see the first 3 movies in quick succession to prepare for the 4th.  Doing this has its advantages... it's easier to determine the best one of the group due to less in between time -- you're not waiting to see each movie as it comes out (lol).  So far, Eclipse is the better of the 3.  I gave Twilight 4 stars and feel that the rating stands due to it's uniqueness and the impact of the movie.  New Moon?  3 stars at best.

Eclipse has slightly better dialog and better acting than Twilight and New Moon.  It's also a lot more involved.  There's a pretty intense and complex love triangle going on between the 3 main characters, a few of the Cullen clan have their origins/stories told and therefore are not quite as one dimensional, Jacob's character has taken on some intriguing personality traits and there was an intense buildup to the final battle in the movie that I found interesting (though the battle itself was kind of flat).  Overall, I liked it and am eager to see how the final chapters/movies evolve.  Not the best love story I've seen by a long shot, but for what it is (a teenage love drama), it's pretty good!",1320969600,3,1249,4.414847161572053
3812604,5,B001UV4XFQ,"I loved this book. *SPOILERS* It was a lot of fun when Bella kept trying to 'sneak away' to see Jacob, and Edward kept trying to hinder her from going. It was exciting that Victoria had amassed an entire army of newborns to fight the Cullens. I thought the fight scene was really good. I laughed so hard when Bella almost begged Edward to have sex with her. That really cracked me up. I also liked that we got to know the Cullens a bit better in this book. I liked the scene in the mountains when Jacob and Edward talked. There was a lot of drama and excitement in this book. It was fun when Bella kissed Jacob and Edward found out about it. It was fun when Jacob and Edward nearly got into a fight and Charlie got between them (what was he thinking?? hehe). Yeah, it was a great read. I loved all the books in this series except the last one which was a HUGE disappointment. Highly recommend this one though! :)",1320796800,2,912,4.1875
3812605,5,B001UV4XFQ,"I look at everybody reviewing poorly about ""Twilight"", ""New Moon"", ""Eclipse"", and even starting to talk bad about ""Breaking Dawn"" (which hasn't even been released yet).  The actors and actresses in these movies do portray what the overall feeling in the books were.  Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart do a wonderful job of capturing the feelings of Edward and Bella.  After all, this is a FORBIDDEN LOVE AFFAIR.
People say that in Twilight, Pattinson as Edward, looks in pain all the time, OF COURSE he does, read the book, he was fighting the urge to KILL her.  In each of the books, Bella is portrayed as a lovely yet clumsy girl, who really doesn't laugh alot, and has the sole responsibility of caring for Charlie (her Dad), she is dangerously serious (maybe wondering if her boyfriend is going to kiss her or bite her?), whose now moved from her Mother's house while a Junior in High School, with her Dad to the rainiest place in the US (which HAS to be depressing) and Stewart also did a great job portraying that.
I feel these movies are a great addition to anyone's collection that honestly likes Twilight and the fantasy world it portrays.  As long as people realize it's fantasy and shouldn't expect the same cinamagraphics or realism as you would from a non-fantasy movie.  These actors and actresses portray Stephenie Meyer's feelings in her books to a wonderful extent and couldn't have been cast better.
Try reading the books before ""expertly"" reviewing the films and the cast choices and situations will become alot clearer (you may want to also read the ""Midnight Sun"" draft by Stephenie Meyer, it's from Edward's point of view).  Also keeping in mind that the Producers do have a little artistic freedom to change aspects of the book for the movie versions as long as the overall concept and storyline is obtained.  Can't wait for BOTH ""Breaking Dawn"" DVD's!",1320710400,,1878,4.792569659442725

Luckily, someone had written a review on the same subject and said it's all in English with a Spanish option. Puts me at ease so now I can finally watch my movie!

And contrary to some of the posted reviews we did get the actual 2 disc SPECIAL EDITION.
HOW EVER The photo showed the packaging in English only.
So we ordered it.
We did not know that the packaging would be heavily SPANISH.
There was some english as well.
We were hoping we had not gotten a subtitled version.
As the pictures did not show this fact.
And we had not noticed this in the store released versions.
We were also worried we had gotten a spanish version.
We have never used AMAZON.COM before.
We tried to contact them for reassurance this is english and spanish wrapped in.
There is no contact us phone numbers to talk to anyone on our receipt order form.
There is no contact us for that matter on the site.
I clicked contact and it kept redirecting to another page.
We tried AMAZON because my daughter had gotten a birthday giftcard.
And i am not really pleased with the lack of customer service.
Luckily we have a set of spanish TWI-HARD fans next door.
So we opened it and prayed for the best.
If nothing else we could pass it on to them.
But thank heavens it is english with no subtitling.
But it does have spanish options.
So if you don't mind a copy with spanish stuff all over it.
This is a good one.
But if you don't want all of the spanish stuff.
Buy somewhere else.
As for me i think i will be going back to EBAY.
Because i have paypal guarantees and customer service to talk to if something goes wrong.

3812679,5,B001UV4XFQ,"I personally recommend these movies to everyone, especially this one! Out of the three movies of the Twilight Saga, Eclipse is by far my favorite. I found the movie to spike all of the emotions inside myself. Portions made me sad, like during the fight. It also provided many happy moments, especially every ones favorite at the end ;). Jealousy and anger are also throughout the entire thing.  You get jealous of the characters but also jealous for them. A person becomes angry at them, or with them, while feeling pity at the same time. These emotions really make the movie exciting and relatable even with extensive amount of fictional themes that occur throughout the movie. Another positive about this movie is the fact that it really went along with the story line of the book.  Although no movie can include everything that happens in the book, I feel that the writers did a very good job at including the important aspects of the book in the movie. From the words that are in the book, to the emotions that you feel during reading parts of the book, the movie really connected the two so well. All in all I think that everyone should watch this movie.

3812773,1,B001UV4XFQ,"Love Lesson From Twilight #4,267: ""Love"" turns all guys into controlling jerks who don't do anything except compete to see whose dingdong is bigger.

Sadly that's most of what's going on in ""Twilight: Eclipse."" It's the best of the series thus far, mainly because some underdeveloped characters get some backstory and there are some interesting action scenes... but the movie is smothered in a thick coating of phlegmlike teen angst, whining and bickering. It gets to the point where you WISH the bad guys would arrive.

In summary: Edward (Robert Pattinson) is pestering Bella (Kristen Stewart) to marry him. Bella doesn't want to because (boohoo) her parents are divorced and marriage is dead to her, but she DOES want to become a vampire. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) wants Bella to dump Edward and be with him instead.

Meanwhile, the evil Victoria is raising an army of newborn vampires to come to Forks and kill Bella. Yes, seriously -- she raised an entire army to kill ONE bland human teenager. Not the Cullens, or the people of Forks. Just Bella. And since the entire universe revolves around Bella, both the werewolves and the Cullens are desperate to protect her. So they overcome centuries of mutual hatred and join forces to protect her.

I will admit it: ""Twilight Eclipse"" is easily the best movie in this series... which is like saying that a pinch is less unpleasant than a poke in the eye. Amazingly, there are actually some taut, fast-paced scenes here, as well as some creepy eerie scenes involving the newborn army (like their too-briefly glimpsed mayhem in Seattle).

Too bad that isn't what the plot is REALLY about. Instead, we're battered with a bad teen soap opera -- lots of heavy breathing, kissing, whining, and romantic estrangements that last about two minutes. The dialogue is painfully vapid (""You love him."" ""I love you more."" ""I know""), and the director seems to be desperately trying to come up with some kind of plot other than Edward and Jacob being emo jerks.

Kristen Stewart gives her usual one-note performance -- dead eyes, masklike face and a monotone voice. And the insipid Bella just drifts through the movie, more of a living MacGuffin than a heroine. It's hard to see why not one but TWO boys would be ready to die for a boring girl who just sits there breathing through her large front teeth.

Robert Pattinson is pretty obviously just here for for his paycheck, while Taylor Lautner gives it his best effort. Unfortunately his character has turned into a controlling jerk to rival Edward, and the two male leads have more sexual chemistry with each other (the tent scene) than with the leaden Stewart. In fact, the only decent character development is given to Jasper and Rosalie, and seeing their backstories (especially Rosalie's bloodthirsty bride rampage) makes them richer and more intriguing than our bland protagonists.

""Twilight Eclipse"" is the best movie of the Twilight series.... which isn't saying much. It has some good moments, but those are smothered by all the teen soapiness.",1313971200,10,3037,4.91796875

After watching two disappointing films, the third just makes me want to dig a hole in the back yard and curl up into a fetal position. I don't seem to see what is good about these films, so I must be going crazy.

This film is poorly written, the acting talent is not even there. The worst part is that there are two decent young actresses in this film in Dakota Fanning and Bryce Dallas Howard. Yet, they barley get any screen time in this movie. For a movie that was suppose to give me an incredible epic battle of Vampire vs. Vampire and Ware-wolf...I am left with just a cheap blur of second rate special effects. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson again horrible and Taylor Lautner is so pathetic in his delivery of dialogue. I mean...""Let's face it...I'm hotter than you???!!!' Someone crank out the crackers because I was just thrown a butt-load of cheese. I even wonder why I am wasting my time watching these, maybe it's because of my deep longing to finish projects I have started...and know that it is important not to knock something unless you have tried it.

Yes, I will see the final two films and yes I will give my thoughts. I am not trying to be biased because I am a huge Harry Potter fan, but I have seen all of those and unlike Twilight they actually try to improve on their mistakes and always try to make every following attempt better than the last. I also have nothing against Pattinson because I loved him in the film 'Water For Elephants' Frankly, once Twilight is over he will be able to bask in the glory in all of his Twilight royalties, and even if Twilight keeps getting the MTV best movie awards, I feel that in about 20 years no one will even understand the question 'So what are you, team Edward or Jacob?'",1311120000,4,1824,4.4094955489614245

I suppose this would be cleared up if I read the book but I cannot imagine willingly interacting with these characters again.  There was no chemistry between Stewart and either Edward or Jacob - and I believe Stewart is involved with Pattison in real life.  Perhaps they sleep in twin beds.  The only pleasure I derived was from the hilarity of the werewolf uniforms:  regardless of the temperature, here they come again, clad only in long shorts.

Sometimes that obligation is enjoyable and rewarding (e.g., the Harry Potter novels and films), and sometimes that obligation is an excruciating act of penance (e.g., any and all things Twilight). What can I say to express the profound artistic void that this film represents? That the acting is wooden and hammy? That the story is about as interesting as watching bread mold? That the script is amateurish and insipid? That the film looks as if it were shot in a teenager's basement and backyard? That the special effects are, in effect, anything but special?

Written by Melissa Rosenberg and directed by David Slade, ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" is the third installment in the highly popular vampire-cum-werewolf teenage angst-fest based on the novels by Stephanie Meyer.

Although Bella's tiresome romantic predicament - should she choose the vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) or the werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner)? - has been pretty much played out by this time (it's what ruined the second film, ""New Moon""), the script here does provide an intriguing internal conflict for the young woman (Kristen Stewart) as she debates the pros and cons of becoming a vampire herself after high school graduation.  She has to decide whether what she'll be gaining from such a move - eternal youth, a fulfilling life with Edward - outweighs what she'll be giving up - her father and mother, Jacob's friendship, and any hope of ever having a family of her own.  The movie also ramps up the drama a bit when a band of out-of-control ""newborn"" vampires start wreaking havoc across the Pacific Northwest, leading the more mature vampires and the werewolves - bitter, sworn enemies of one another - to join forces in defeating them.

These ""Twilight"" films lack the cutting-edge wit and irony one finds in a series like ""True Blood,"" as Meyer opts for romantic sappiness over postmodern sophistication every step of the way.  And the over-earnest and self-important tone leads to some intense silliness along the way.  Still they do have their moments.",1305158400,,1487,5.094650205761317
3812864,4,B001UV4XFQ,"I watched the first movie after hearing form my daughters that it was good.  I knew it was probably designed for girl tweens but tried it anyway (at home).

I had never read the books so the movie held some surprises.  Vampires, ok.  (Well cast by the way.)  Before we know too much Edward saves Bella's life (I don't understand why this actress, decent in other movies, is so bland and why Edward AND Jacob fall for her).  Cool scene.  But the scene that was most fun was the baseball game.  It was well done and fun to watch ""vampire"" baseball.

The movie does tend to get bogged down (for me) when Bella thinks too much or when Bella/Edward talk too much (maybe tween girls find the talk romantic), I don't know.  Finally, there is some violent action near the end which helps.

I  do have more trouble with Jakob and the wolves.  Vampires ok, but now super large wolves, too.  I can't stand when Jakob pouts, storms off, or looks smug (say, when Bella gets on his motorcycle).  And his taking his shirt off all the time is quite annoying (I know some kids like this when I grew up.

As a guy, if you want to throw some sex in fine --- a little making out with actual T&A would be fine.  I could take Jakob having his shirt off during such a scene.  Of course, having a beautiful girl /woman play the part of Bella would have helped, too.  It would also make Edward's and Jakob's lust for Bella at least
somewhat believable.

(The third movie is strong on action --- a good thing; but the second movie is boring and has too much talk between Bella and Jakob.  I'd skip the 2nd movie.)",1304899200,,1587,4.276094276094276

I found Eclipse to be the darkest and creepiest of the Twilight series. Edward's obsessiveness over Bella is a trait that many a concerned mother has warned her daughter about. And I guess this puts me on Team Jacob by default, but then I'm still left wondering why Bella is such a prize.

3812947,3,B001UV4XFQ,"Everybody has their own list of Crappy Movies You Can't Help Watching and the Twilight movies have a prominent place on mine.  With a few exceptions, notably Billy Burke as Charlie Swan, the acting is from hunger, the storyline improbable (vampires are improbable enough, but sparkly vampires?  Who'da thunk it?), and character development is practically non-existent.  But the movies do have a certain silly charm, especially Robert Pattinson's self-deprecating performance as Edward Cullen (and my God, he is so gorgeous he should have his own pin-up calendar), and Ashley Greene as his ditzy sister.  I can't help liking her.  Kristin Stewart was just plain irritating in the first two films but she's improved a lot in this movie.  Maybe she's finally learning.

""Eclipse"" is starting to grow on me.  The first time I watched it I couldn't stand it.  Then last night I saw it again on cable TV and actually enjoyed it in spots.  Maybe I wasn't in the right mood when I saw it the first time, but I love a good romance and the romance between Edward and Bella is really touching and sweet.  Especially Edward's explanation of why he insists on no sex before marriage: he wants to re-live the old-fashioned way of courtship he was cheated of when he was made a vampire.  I also thought the Cullens had more depth and dimension than they did in the other movies.  They aren't just a happy family, they're a close-knit family whose very existence is threatened by some newbies who don't know how to act right.

Jacob, however... my God, I wanted to slap that boy upside the head.  Not that I didn't enjoy Taylor Lautner's performance, which I thought was the best of the three leads, but good lord, what is it with this guy that he can't take no for an answer?  Buy a vowel, get a clue, she wants Edward, she doesn't want you.  His obsession with Bella isn't romantic, it's irritating and immature.  She tells him she doesn't reciprocate his feelings for her; he tells her he's not buying it.  What isn't he buying?  He might as well throw a tantrum and tell her never mind how you feel, it's all about me.  He may be in love but he's got the emotional maturity of an eight year old.  And his justification of imprinting is chilling.  What girl wouldn't want a guy who imprinted on her?  A girl who likes to make up her own mind, that's who.  Actually, Meyer's big ""triangle"" is no triangle at all; it's two people in love and a third who won't take the hint that there's no room for him.  Jacob has some major growing up to do.

The backstories of Jasper and Rosalie don't add anything to the film except to take up time, and the intrusion of the evil Volturi toward the movie's end seems more like an afterthought tacked onto the story, but taken as a whole, ""Eclipse"" isn't a bad addition to the ""Twilight"" series.  At least it's more fun to watch than Edward and Bella's interminable angst in ""New Moon"".  And it's got a lovely, upbeat ending, for those who like their movies to end on a positive.

3813101,5,B001UV4XFQ,"I really liked the first Twilight movie and was sorely disappointed in the the second one, although the last 20 to 30 minutes were pretty exciting. Eclipse is easily the best of the series and I can safely predict that will still hold true after the 4th movie is out.  I liked Eclipse so much, I decided to buy the 4th book now instead of waiting for the movie.  After reading a few reviews and a plot synopsis of the 4th in the series, I decided to definitely not waste my money on the book.
  Eclipse held every second of my attention from beginning to the closing credits. The balance of character development, plot structure and suspense as well as great action (despite far fewer and noticeably less elaborate/expensive special effects than the first 2 movies)made this movie the best.  I really cared about the characters and their futures. In the first two movies it was more about fascination with the situation than about the characters.
  Editing, sound, cinematography and general technical aspects seemed far tighter in the third of the series. The dialogue was more real, probably because by now I have fully accepted the implausible relationships of human girl, vampire family and werewolves.  The characters became more likable as we learn more about them and not so much about what is happening around them.  This is really a well done movie.
  At the end we can see Bella's plans and predict what we would hope happens in the next in the series.  Without spoiling anything, I am sure the 4th movie, like the second, will not fulfill the promise of Eclipse. There are a dozen better ways to end the series than what happens in the next installment. I will watch the movie some day but will not waste my time on a 700+ page book with the events I have learned.  Unless the next movie just about rewrites the book, as many reviewers have suggested should be done, you might want to just watch Eclipse again instead of buying the last movie.  Eclipse does not stand on its own, since it is part of a series, but is the only one to own if you had to pick just one.",1298246400,,2076,4.53083109919571

3813139,3,B001UV4XFQ,"I bought this blu-ray/DVD combo because it was such a great price and I really wanted a ""2-disc"" set with all the special features.  This is only ONE disc (Blu-ray movie on one side, DVD version on the other), but is does have all the special features, which is great.  The Blu-ray is great ... nice picture, clear and crisp (I'm really not all that picky when it comes to Blu-ray vs. DVD -- as long as I can follow the story, I'm happy!)  The special features were fun to watch also.  I always enjoy the behind-the-scenes stuff, and this was worth it.

As far as the ""Eclipse"" story, well, they could have done better -- but that's been my complaint with all the Twilight movies. I loved the books and have been very disappointed with the movies.  In my opinion they should have chosen a better cast to begin with -- Kristen Stewart makes me crazy and I can't figure out why they decided that she can act. She did better this movie, but she's had several years to ""practice"" her role so it's about time she showed some improvement.  I was more impressed with Rob Pattinson this time and thought he did a much better job than in previous movies.  And most of the ""wolves"" were great.  The Cullens were good and did about as well as in the other movies.  My favorite actor so far in this series is ""Charlie"" -- I think Billy Burke has done a fabulous job.  Overall, it was okay, about what I have come to expect from the Twilight movies.  Good thing this Blu-ray/DVD was a good price, or I never would have bothered buying the movie.",1297641600,2,1532,4.336842105263158
3813140,4,B001UV4XFQ,"I am a big fan of the Twilight book series, so buying the movies was a natural step.  A movie is hardly ever as good as the book, so it's not surprising that a good bit of the book is not on the screen.  Nevertheless, the screenwriter did an excellent job of capturing the Eclipse world, with Edward even ""hotter"" than he was in the first two movies. Jake and Bella are more beautiful, too.  This movie has more action and deeper romance than the first two movies.  There is a lot that is deeper in Eclipse: you see the back stories for the characters Jasper and Rosalie.  You also see some of the horror of vampire life, so this is not a movie for young children.  But it is a must-see for a Twilight fan.

A note on the Special Features commentary:  Robert Pattinson hasn't quite got the knack of commentary.  He is evidently embarrassed by his character, Edward, who is earnest and passionate.  Pattinson's comments are cynical and satiric and tend to ruin the romantic atmosphere, so my advice is not to listen to the commentary until after you have watched the movie several times.",1297555200,,1086,4.467005076142132

3813163,1,B001UV4XFQ,"OK. I've had it. This is the 3rd movie. I've gone back and watched the first to see if there was a time when Bella's silent stare off into space, her angst, her willfulness to disregard ANYTHING that might help herself, had made the movie better and the movies succeed IN SPITE of her due to the team Edward vs. team Jacob rivalry. Could the script writers do ANYTHING to help her character lessen her stupidity on going off into the woods to ponder when that is the LAST place she should be going? Bella is the most stupid of female characters and its a travesty that this is what tweens and twentysomethings in the audiences are vying to become. If this is the state of relationships between males and females of this age bracket and its being played out as Bella lays on her bed with her hands splayed or always playing through her hair or having the attention span of a gnat with regards to everything else around her, its dysfunctional and these movies just encourage this. The Vampire council already wants her changed to vampire which she willingly wants to give herself up to and has been trying to get Edward to ""change"" her all along, but that's the whole point: she cannot see anything good in her life as it is, so she must become something ELSE, and she needs a man to help her become something BETTER.  Its this vacuum of nothingness inside of Bella that I've had enough of. She's empty and pathetic as a character and I hope that girls and young women out there see her as NOT something to strive to be.",1296864000,10,1518,4.402135231316726

The first two movies were just okay but Eclipse really satisfied me and made me want to watch it twice.  So I did.  I enjoyed it even more the second time around.  The cast seemed more mature and worked better together.  The storyline was more exciting and I got used to the silly looking CGI wolves.  The interaction between Jacob, Bella and Edward was more believable and satisfying.  It was a fun, fun movie.  My only complaint is a question.  What the heck happened to Esme?  Her makeup and hair color were completely the opposite of all the other movies and for the longest time I thought they had used a different actress.  Why can't the directors of these movies keep a consistent look with the actors and the scenery?",1296777600,,819,4.466216216216216
3813166,3,B001UV4XFQ,"Not bashing the movie here, I loved the movie, it was my favorite of the 3 released so far.  They aimed it for an older audience in my opinion, and who could resist Jacob telling Edward that he (Jacob) is just hotter (than Edward)?

What I don't like is only having an option for a blu ray with no special features, or a blu ray disc with the dvd right on the same disc.  The whole point of having both formats is in case of damage, or to lend one to a friend and still be able to keep your copy...in my opinion it was a cheap out on the part of the manufacturer, seriously, how much more could it have cost to put them on separate discs?  I would have paid an extra buck to have blu ray and dvd separated from each other.  I just hope this isn't the start of a new trend in blu ray manufacture!

Or, put the special features on a simple blu ray release.  Honestly I don't much care about having dvd and blu ray, I bought it to get blu ray, and like having a dvd backup, but it isn't necessary.  But I'm certainly not going to pass on having special features.",1296777600,,1059,4.0095238095238095

3813242,5,B001UV4XFQ,"Love this movie...couldn't wait to receive the dvd and wasn't disappointed. Twilight will always be my favorite because it was the love story of Edward and Bella. Catherine Hardwick did a very good job with the amount of budget she had, plus she brought together the cast and that was good. New Moon was my least favorite book and was very disappointed in the movie. I felt that Chris Weitz could had done a better job but maybe it was the script that he had to work with. He did have a much bigger budget. Italy was very good but the movie lacked something. Even the vampires coloring was off and wigs were terrible. Eclipse was great. David Spade did a very good job but he had a very good budget so it should have been good. The only thing I felt that he left on the cutting room floor that should have been included was the scene were Edward told Bella to lock her window. That one scene showed more of their relationship, how Edward was much more in love with her than Jacob who just forced himself on her even if she was saying No. I love the commentary section of the dvd. It is very informative and humorist. Am looking forward to the final two movies. I think they may be the best of all from what we have seen. Bill Conlon is doing a great job with Bella and Edward. That is the reason people were drawn into this sage...the love story. I do feel they could leave out the book of Jacob. It was very boring in the book. I loved Breaking Dawn but that part was a little too much. Let's see running around the Cullen house...oh yes that is exciting.",1296345600,,1556,4.242424242424242
3813243,5,B001UV4XFQ,"well, first of all it arrived earlier than I expected. And the DVD quality and content are as expected too. Excellent :)",1296345600,,120,4.5
3813244,3,B001UV4XFQ,"Maybe up to 70% of this film consists of Bella and her vampire boyfriend, Edward, and occassionally his werewolf adversary, lying around in bed or proximate venues necking with their clothes on, discussing such issues as marriage, why they can or can't, should or shouldn't get it on right now, desperately clinging to the PG rating, whether or not the deathless life of the vampire fiend is preferable to human mortality, pre-teen and teen angst regarding the purpose or purposelessness of existence, etc. The screenplay seems to suggest that he's afraid of sucking the life out of her on the spot (maybe a good thing) which will definitely happen if he, literally, gets too much into her.  This A-story or B-story is suggested to provide a certain cohesive tension until graduation night when this event is supposed to commence, but does not.  The school (junior high?) it seems is divided between cliques of vampires and werewolves, excepting the class valedictorian and the faculty, losers who retain their humanity, even in Hollywood. One sits around the school cafeteria with one's respective intimates, vamp or wolf, rapping, and staring down at the crummy institutional fare on the plate, inwardly craving a gut full of good ol' flesh and blood.  Not an unrealistic portrait of school life when honestly considered.  Shakespeare would seriously envy the amount of dialogue packed into this script which deluges the audience in backstory, mercilessly playing on the deepest hopes, fears, and dilemmas of folks between the ages of eight to maybe fifteen, until they either swim or drown. But none can doubt the commercial success of Twilight. The makers have targeted their audience (the bulk of the current theatre-going audience alluded to above) with enviable expertise. Surprisingly, action scenes account for no more than 15% of the footage, rather incredible as they are at that.  The credit here must go to the actors. Ms Stewart is blessed with an expressive, almost Keatonesque melancholy in her eyes and brow which will only mellow with age, an A-list fundament, and she plays admirably to the camera.  As everyone in the world who watches movies knows at this point, Pattinson and K-Stew are beautiful people - which prompts one to reflect on how much more fun, though less of a shameless cash cow, such a film would have been, had at least some, if not all, of their romance had been shot au natural.  But then again, we are, if not happily, brought to remembrance of that special time in life when the passion of love ran higher than even our all too human, inexorable animal lust.

3813247,4,B001UV4XFQ,I don't even remember when the Twilight series became important to me (or vampires for that matter). I was delighted when I found out there was a two-disc version available for Eclipse and that feeling grew after I purchased it and watched it. I wish all of the Twilight series had behind the scenes footage available. The two disc version of Eclipse was worth every penny.,1296086400,,373,4.666666666666667
3813318,4,B001UV4XFQ,"I give the film itself 4 stars because it is generally well made (except that too many close-ups of the actors' faces make it look like it was made with TV screens in mind -- perhaps with an eye to DVD sales) and the special effects are very good (the battle scene pitting the Cullen clan and the Quileute wolfpack against the army of newborn vampires, for instance), but I was put off by the alteration in the Edward/Bella storyline at the end which made it seem that Bella is more interested in becoming a vampire because she fits into that world, rather than her love for and desire to be with Edward. Although the purpose may have been to make Bella more of a ""modern"" and ""liberated"" woman, it changes the effect and leaves a slightly unpleasant aftertaste, since much of the charm and appeal of the story stems from the characters' devotion to each other. When Eclipse was first released to theaters, I stood in line with many other fans whose faces mirrored excitement and pleasure going in; however, those same faces were somewhat nonplussed going out. I'm sure my face had much the same expression. Hence, the opinion that the movie was ""disappointing."" I have purchased the 3 films (Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse) that have been released to date, and although I plan to see Breaking Dawn (both parts) when it comes out, I'll be more wary going in. In a nutshell, the movies are okay; the books are better.",1296086400,,1417,4.582677165354331
3813319,1,B001UV4XFQ,"It was better than the first two, but that's like saying a hot poker in the ear is better than a fishhook in the eye.

Eclipse is the third movie of the Twilight saga. (Only one more to go!)

All the characters are back, Bella, Edward and Jacob.

Bella/Kristen Stewart is still as annoying as all get out.

Edward still has the big vampire hair.

Jacob is like Captain Kirk - he finds ways to always be without a shirt.

The best part of this movie, well all three movie so far, is Bella's dad. Billy Burke offers some much-needed comedy in this trash.

So why watch these films if I hate them so much? Simple: I enjoy torture. This is like watching movies like Attack of the Killer Tomatoes or something; you end up laughing so hard at the horrible acting and the dreadful writing.

At least, with this movie, you get some good acting by Bryce Dallas Howard. She does a great job at being a vengeful vampire. Although her time is too short. Dakota Fanning, however, doesn't fit her role.

I would prefer they would add more backend stories for Cullen family - only Rosalie's and Jasper are covered, while the most interesting, in my opinion, - Carlisle's is not there.
I'm owning all movies because of my daughter and actively invloved into discussion of both - books and movies.

3813482,3,B001UV4XFQ,"After reading the first book a few months ago, I decided to watch Twilight. The first film, while low in budget, was a lot better. This could be because the idea and/or actors were ""fresh,"" I do not know which. The second film was pretty bad: there were pacing issues, issues with hair and make-up, and issues with the acting. The third film fares a little better; there were two major flaws, everyone's wigs and the speech that Bella made at the end.

Eclipse picks up right where New Moon left off, Bella and Edward are happy together. He wants her to marry him as a stipulation for turning her. She has shallow reason why she does not want to marry him; even though she wants to commit to eternal after life? If you follow the saga, then you know that the werewolves hate the vampires.....etc. Victoria comes back wanting revenge and she is played by someone different. She builds a newborn army to take out Bella. Possibly to eliminate the Cullen's as well or just because she does not want the Volturi to know. The werewolves form a truce and work together to save Forks from newborn annihilation. Two of the Cullen's are allowed to speak on their back stories. Bella agrees to marry Edward, they hide in a tent for her to be safe. The tent scene from the book happens. Jacob tries to force his love on Bella, he learns of their impending marriage and the fights happens. It ends with Bella's speech.

The Good:
The cinematography was beautiful, the pacing of this story was done better. Everyone accept for Kirsten has improved in the acting department. Pivotal scenes from the book are executed well. Riley and Bree were perfectly cast and the the action scenes were a lot better. I am glad the third wife scene was cut down. Imprinting was explained better and they left out the Quil/Claire stuff.

The Bad:
Everyone's hair was a mess, I know Kristen shot this after filming the Runaways; but that wig was just vomit-inducing. Jasper hair and the general style of a lot of characters was just bad; it kept me from getting thoroughly lost in the film. We do not hear much from Jasper but in the first films he seemed to have a lisp, now it is a southern accent? Bella, in the books, does not actually engage Rosalie to hear her back story, so I found this a little odd. None of the werewolves look like they should be grown or at the age of 25. The execution of Jacobs love for Bella came off poorly, I never saw the love, just a douche bag.

Kirsten has no chemistry with Robert or Taylor, on film: I could not SEE why either would want her, there was barely any signs of fun; just Kristen biting her nails. It is inferred that the Volturi knew about the newborns but allowing Jane, etc to watch them create havoc was confusing; is it foreshadowing, I thought that was just an errant thought? The last thing was the speech at the end. The books sort of meld together but Bella was really sad over ""losing"" Jacob. This was never explored, instead Bella talks about belonging with the Cullen's, truly wanted to be a monster because she did not fit in; there was no need for the speech. It seem trite and pedestrian.

I prefer the films to the books because a lot of unnerving themes are left out{cough Quil}, so I would recommend seeing it once because it is entertaining. It is a dramedy, you might awwwww!! and you might find it romantic but there are definitely some laughs, just those wigs alone.",1294963200,4,3406,4.46067415730337

I didn't read the books, I'm not at the center of this phenom by any means - but I did enjoy it. This is the strongest of the three films though the pacing is as slow as the 2 before it - almost methodical, and by three different directors. It's my intuition that an executive producer or Meyer herself is watching over this incarnation of the franchise. In any case, prepare not to be wowed by non-stop action, but by scenery and political intrigue, and some really compelling character back-stories. And make sure you take a date.

After being forced to watch both that show and this movie, I have to say I appreciate the Vampire Diaries show a lot more after seeing this garbage.  Yes, I've read the Twilight books, and I can understand why those books have done well.

3813730,5,B001UV4XFQ,"After reading all the books, my favorites were the first one, Twilight, and the last - Breaking Dawn.  The movies, however, have evolved one by one with script, makeup and special effects.  I was disappointed in the makeup and some of the effects in Twilight. New Moon was much better with the effects and not so chalky with the makeup.  Eclipse is the next evolution and definitely the best yet.  The casting of Taylor Lautner as Jacob is one of the best choices ever.  I thought that even the first time we saw him in Twilight and he has grown with the part. (Kudos to Taylor for beefing up to fit the part so well!)
  In Eclipse, there is more action (Victoria's newborn army) as well as more romance as Bella and Edward have a night to themselves in the Cullen house. The highlight scene of the movie for me was the tent scene in which Edward and Jacob have a very candid conversation about their feelings while Bella sleeps, warmed against the freezing cold by the ""hot"" werewolf's body.

3813783,2,B001UV4XFQ,"Kristen Stewart and Rob Pattinson have a commentary on the dvd that I was really looking forward to since they didn't do one for the New Moon dvd.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but it was a very disappointing.

At the very beginning of the commentary, Rob says something like: ""I'm in LA and Kristen is in Montreal, so this is probably going to be very awkward and annoying and we'll have nothing to say after 3 minutes.""  He was right!  Scenes were passing by and there was no commentary, only Silence.  The pauses were so long, I thought the commentary on my dvd player had shut itself off.

Also, I had to watch the commentary with subtitles because I couldn't understand what they were talking about, and then even with the subtitles, I couldn't understand Kristen half the time.  She said things like (and this is word for word): ""I don't know.  I mean, maybe it's just like, I mean, maybe it fits with the, you know, us us humans are really fragile and like the main character is a girl and all of that and the fact that she's willing to subject herself to something like so sexually overpowering is like something that's actually it's not just it's not just like, it's not just like cool and scary, it's actually sort of like not not the smartest thing.  Maybe that's, you know what I mean, maybe they're reminding you that this girl or whoever like these like they're actually really sensitive so yeah I don't know, whatever.""

Or ""She was yeah she was getting like really yeah every time she was getting close I mean I'm kidding she totally could have done whatever, but.""

Really great scenes were passing by and there's no commentary!  Just silence.  For example, in the scene where Bella leans against Jacob in wolf form, that would have been a great opportunity to talk about how they did that.  All's Kristen says is something like, ""his little suit.""  What?  What's that mean?  Was that an actual wolf suit?  When I saw the behind the scenes takes, I realized that Taylor Lautner was actually dressed in this gray scuba-like suit for that scene.  He leans down and she pats his head just like he does in wolf form.  That would have been something interesting to talk about, but no.

Also, Kristen tells Rob to ""shut up"" or ""shhh"" about 30 times which was kind of annoying.

Half way through, Rob says, ""People are going to watch this and be like, really, that's all you have to say?""  At least he was aware of it!

One high point is Rob's sense of humor.  I was laughing out loud during some parts of his commentary.  And seeing his real personality and accent, it made me appreciate him as an actor since he is really nothing like Edward.

Aside from the commentary, I know this movie could make me cry if there was another actress playing the role of Bella.  Kristen Stewart is a good actress, in other movies.  For some reason, I can't relate to her.  My heart won't soften when she's on the screen.  With Edward and Jacob, my heart starts to break, and then she shows up and it stops.  There's no chemistry with her.  She's not vulnerable enough or something.  And she never smiles.  She's got the right look but that's all.  It's kind of a shame, imho.

Stephenie Meyer and one of the producers also do a commentary, and that one is excellent.  No long awkward pauses.  They're focused and give you lots of behind the scenes info.",1294272000,3,3358,4.478547854785479

3813787,3,B001UV4XFQ,"For me, this movie lacked. The scenes for me really didn't add up. One minute Bella is mad at Edward for messing with her truck, the next, they're in school going to lunch. For me, a lot of the movie was just like that, skipping from one scene to the next. If I hadn't read the books, I wouldn't have understood the movie as a regular movie goer. There are only a few scenes that stuck with me:
1)The marriage proposal
2)The training fight scene(which should have been much longer!)
3)Charlie and Bella sex-talk
4)The ending fight scene
5)Certain parts of the tent scene.
Certain scenes were ok, like the Quileute background story and Jasper's background story. Rosalie's not so much.
Everything else was mediocre. I really would have liked it if they added the part where Edward followed Bella all the way to Angela's house as soon as she crossed the Quileute border. That was one of the scenes I was looking for and it never happened.
This movie seemed a little bit sappy with all the kissing. It was even too much for me, and I'm a female.

So. Eclipse. Just ok.

3813835,5,B001UV4XFQ,"I will always tell people that the Twilight books are MUCH better than the movies, but the movies are getting better and better.  I won't go through the movie ad nauseum, but rather tell you about the features that make the Blu-Ray/DVD combo great:

1)  I can watch the movie anywhere in the house.  We have a Blu-Ray player downstairs but not upstairs.  I'm stuck watching Twilight and New Moon on the cold leather sofa in the living room, but I can watch Eclipse upstairs in a warm comfy bed.  Bonus.

2)  I'm a dork for behind-the-scenes documentaries.  I love seeing how a movie is made, and the extra interviews you see with the cast and crew.  For the teenage girls who are Team Jacob, they even have special featurettes called ""Taylor Time"" where he's basically looking hot and doing adorable stuff, like catching grapes in his mouth and throwing a football over set trailers.  Good times.

3)  The extra and extended scenes are great, and honestly I don't understand or agree with the rationalization given for why they were cut.  Stephanie Meyer and Wyck Godfrey also discuss some of these cut scenes in their audio commentary.

4)  The audio commentary features are always enlightening, although they can be distracting if you're trying to pay attention to the movie.  I enjoyed the Stephanie Meyer/Wyck Godfrey commentary alot.  The Kristen Stewart/Rob Pattinson audio commentary, not so much.  Surprise!  If you are a younger fan, you may enjoy it alot more, but to me it felt like being the awkward third wheel on a date with them.  They are openly joking and flirting and I could only stand it for 5 minutes and had to turn it off.  I will definitely try it again soon, but I will have a bottle of wine nearby.

5)  Finally I LOVED that I didn't have to sit or fast forward through 3-4 movie trailers before getting to the DVD menu.

The two music videos are great (Metric's ""I'm All Yours"" and Muse's ""Neutron Star Collision"").  The photo slideshow is sorta silly, and I didn't use the feature where you can skip to your favorite scenes, so can't comment on that.

3813984,2,B001UV4XFQ,"If you are watching this as a stand alone movie, I would say that it is a decent movie - lots of action scenes with some romance thrown in.

But as part of the Twilight Saga, I have to say that this movie is a disaster!

Let me start by stating that like thousands of Twifans, I had eagerly waited for this movie and saw it on opening day. My initial reaction was that it's a terrible sequel. To give is a fair chance, I bought the DVD and saw it twice again, once on it's own and then again as part of my weekend movie marathon from Twilight to New Moon to Eclipse.

So what's wrong with the movie?
1. The sweetness and magical fantasy weaved in the first 2 movies was totally non-existent in this movie - it felt too 'real-life', like some action movie.
2. The camera angles felt too close when compared to the first 2 movies, and it felt almost like it was ""in your face"" too much.
3. The hair on the key characters look really fake or awkward, and the skin tone was either a weird shade of pale or bronzy in some scenes.
4. Bryce Dallas Howard as Victoria was totally disorientating - she played the character so differently that it was clearly 2 different personalities. They should have stuck with the same actress throughout the 3 movies.
5. The music was too loud or too epic like - the bedroom proposal scene music was way too loud and it totally destroyed the mood of the scene. The music at the end of the movie was too epic like, too LOTR (I have done the LOTR movie marathon enough times to recognize Howard Shore's touch anywhere - and the Twilight Saga is not LOTR).

David Slade and Howard Shore are both great artists and great in what they do, but I personally feel that they have not understood what Catherine Hardwicke and Chris Weitz had done in the earlier movies. Where New Moon picked up the mood and transitioned well from Twilight, the transition from New Moon to Eclipse is not there.

I hope they don't destroy the next 2 movies that they are making from the last book.",1293840000,,1997,4.286472148541114

3813988,3,B001UV4XFQ,"I was a newcomer to the world of Twilight. I only saw the first two film installments, Twilight and New Moon when I started reading the books by Stephanie Meyer. Compared to the film version of Twilight and New Moon, Eclipse was a far better film. However, if you don't read the book you miss the richness of the characters, the evolution of the story and the emotion that Ms. Meyer creates. Eclipse is a fair film adaptaion, but I urge people to read the books in the Twilight Series now, as we wait for the first film installment of Breaking Dawn in 2011. Caution to parents of pre-teen children:  as wonderful of a character that Edward Cullen is, do you really want someone stalking your child, entering their room through their bedroom window and spending the night with them without your knowledge? This aspect of the Twilight series-book and film-may not be the best subject matter for children.",1293753600,,902,4.672955974842767
3813989,5,B001UV4XFQ,"This double disc movie is great! Each movie in this saga has gotten better and better. I'm not ashamed to say that even though I am a big Twilight fan, I did not give the first move a very good rating. New Moon was better, and Eclipse has surpassed them to become the best!

The actors all did a better job - they actually portrayed their characters this time. In the past movies, some of them didn't do their characters justice, they didn't play the parts that were already written for us that we had fallen in love with through Stephanie's books. In this movie, Edward and Bella actually seemed more like Edward and Bella should be.

I also loved that the supporting characters got more face time - they all do such a wonderful job, and are such charismatic characters. I'm glad they got more screen time. I also loved that flashbacks were included in the movie. We got to see flashbacks from Jasper and Rosalie's pasts - while we already knew what happened, it was cool to see it play out on screen.

The chemistry between the Edward, Bella, and Jacob love triangle was also better than ever. I loved the scenes between Jacob and Bella - Jacob is a fighter!

There were of course some awkward parts in the movie - some parts that were a bit rushed or a bit out of left field, that as a book reader I could keep up with but still wished they had done it a bit differently.

Does anyone else find it troubling why all these guys are hung up on this bland skinny H.S. girl?  She certainly is not HOT - she's bland and redundantly the same again and again - she's MEAT to Dine on though a little twiggy.

Pulled this thing out with company on Xmas and it was so boring - way to much sappy dialogue and SPEECHES = Freakin SPEECHES over and over and way to little ACTION.  True Blood blows this thing away and that dang whiny Kirsten Stewart makes ya want to Vomit - like I said a 12 year old must have wrote the script for preteens that don't know QUALITY - Trash Trash Trash!

Don't waste your money on #3 the first movie was great but each sequel has gotten worse.

Also, the ACTING was simply terrible but it matched the infantile dialogue - does anyway actually converse like these idiotics?  NO!

3814197,2,B001UV4XFQ,"I normally do not write reviews but I feel so necessary to put my thoughts on paper to get my frustration out.  First of, I'm a new fan to the twilight saga.  I watched Twilight to see what all the hype was about.  I know I'm a little behind all the diehard fans but I wanted to check it out.  The movie was terrible.  The dialog and the acting on Kristen Stewart's part were just horrendous to watch.  I told my friends this and they urged me to read the books because it is so much better.  After I read the 1st book, I was hooked!  I got the other 3 books and was just obsessed over the books.  I guess it would be too much to expect the movie to emulate the book exactly but come on...it is so way off.  The first Twilight movie was actually very painful to watch comparing to the book.  The part where Bella told Edward that she knew he was a vampire was so endearing and touching in the book and they totally butchered it in the movie version.  It actually looked really stupid in the movie.  This is after all a love story and they took most of the love part out of the movie.  It was really disappointing.  Then I watched New Moon, it was a little better than Twilight but still left off a lot of dialog from the book that should be included.  Then the 3rd movie, a little better than the other two but at the end of the movie, I long to read the books again.  The movie is nothing compared to the books.  I know the movie would be like 5 hours long if it follows the book exactly but if you are going to take things out, that's fine but don't change the entire thing.  The part where Edward confronted Jacob for kissing Bella, in the book, it was just loving and so protective.  In the movie, it was dumb and so childish.  I just hope Breaking Dawn will be better and they will keep most of what is in the book and translate it into the movie.  Since they are making 2 parts for Breaking Dawn, should be plenty of timing to allow this.  Maybe down the road, someone else might do a remake of the entire this and it will be much better.  I just don't know how Stephenie Meyer would allow the movie to be made like this when her books are so much better.  They need to get rid of the screenwriter and maybe have Stephenie write the script.",1293408000,,2246,4.073059360730594
3814198,5,B001UV4XFQ,I was very upset when my Blu-ray disc would not play.  You should have a notice in the box stating that the Blu-ray has been updated and any older disc players will not play the new dvd.

3814200,5,B001UV4XFQ,"I have purchased each of the Twilight saga DVD's.  Of the three, I think Eclipse was the best by far.  I enjoyed the footage of the surrounding mountains and how it was actually filmed.  The book story line was also well represented in the third installment of the twilight series.  I felt that the first two movies deviated too much from the actual books, but understood that it was necessary to trim the book story line to keep the movie, age appropriate and within a suitable time frame.  All in all, one of my favorites movies.  I wished that the screen writers had not put so many foul words in Jacob's mouth this time around.  It was not necessary for the plot and seemed to cheapen the storyline.  Not every werewolf needs to use foul language to get their point across.  Leave the cheap language out of the next two movies.  Only weak writing needs to use this type of language to carry the storyline.  I was not happy at all that I made an advance purchase of the Eclipse movie before it's release, but did not receive it until several days after the release date.  Because of this, I will never purchase a newly released movie or book from Amazon.  I will go to my local merchant and fight the lines in order to have the item on the first day of the release.  In the past, since I work for the Postal Service, I knew that Amazon sent the ""to be released"" materials out to the Post Office to be delivered on the release date.  Even though this made me nervous, I enjoyed serving my customers through Amazon by being able to deliver their item directly to their waiting hands on the day it was released.  I hate that this practice has been discontinued.  It was a great service for those who live in rural areas and can not afford to travel to a store in order to purchase the item on the original release date.  If I had been aware of this fact, I would not have ordered from Amazon.  And I am a loyal customer of Amazon.  Too bad!

There are some guys like that, if you look at the right place. This movie was too much for me, the plot of it just seemed bland and basic. Love a friend don't want to tell him because I'm in love with a guy the cry and argue over the girl fight for servival and end to be continued.

Even the scene with Jasper meeting Alice for the first time was terrible. Oh and showing the vampires breaking apart like concrete.... really... seriously... If i could i would put zero, but i did like seeing the background on Riley, since i wondered about how he fell in with Victoria. I expected so much more from reading reviews.

It was close to the book, and I enjoyed the history of the Indian tribe. I believe it's roughly close to the real legends of the real tribe so that was fun. I felt some of the things that were kind of skipped in New Moon was filled in with Eclipse.

The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the inconsistency of how to kill a vampire. I didn't realize some shattered like glass, while others don't? In Twilight James was ripped to pieces while in Eclipse all they had to do was hit them real hard and they broke into tiny glass pieces.

3814282,2,B001UV4XFQ,"The main problem I've had with all three movies is that Kristen Stewart doesn't seem like a very good actor. All the scenes in the book that have lots of drama - yelling, crying - are just flat and dead in the movie. Anyone watching this who hasn't read the books would have no clue why Edward loves Bella. The movie Bella has zero personality. I already know Breakimg Dawn will be a huge disappointment because there's no way she'll be able to portray the fierce awesome mother Bella becomes.

And, why do they cut so much out of the books only to add stuff that wasn't even in them in the first place? Who cares about the newborns - they all die anyway?!

And Carlisle would never have been able to sneak up on Edward because Edward would have read his mind.

My favorite part was when Edward confronted Victoria in the fight. It seemed like the only time we got to really see Edward without lame movie Bella in the way.

1) The conversation between Bella and Jacob before he goes to fight is totally gay.  They tried to cram in the intensity, yet turned it into something silly by changing how it all went.  The movie makes it appear as though she's pursuing him and didn't properly show how he was baiting her by talking about going out in a blaze of glory per say.
2)  The fight with Edward and Victoria and Riley.  They made Edward out to look like some sort of pansy that couldn't hold his own.  Not how it happened.  They also did this in New Moon when he scuffled with Felix (I do think Felix should've ultimately won, but it should've been more of a challenge than it was).

With that said, I loved most everything else!

Dear Amazon,
I will not pre-order anything from you in the future.  Other retailers ship it so that you RECEIVE it on the release date.  If others can do it why not you?  Very disappointing!",1292630400,,1016,4.351063829787234
3814331,5,B001UV4XFQ,"The action in the movie is great,however there are several cheesy moments with edward, bella, and jacob.  Yet this is overall really good and follows the book pretty closely!",1292544000,,174,5.0
3814332,4,B001UV4XFQ,"I must say that I did like the action in this film a lot more than the others.  I was thankful that the newborn fight scene was shown because it wasn't in the book.  I am a huge fan of the Twilight Saga and have read the books several times.  However, there were a few scenes in Eclipse that were totally unbelievable and somewhat angering if you know the story well.

First and for most, there is no way in hell the book version of Bella Swan would have hopped on the back of Jacob's motor cycle and rode off with him leaving Edward standing there looking stupid no matter how mad she might have been.  She was upset that he didn't tell her that Victoria was coming for her yes, but she understood that he did it for her own protection.  Edward has always been very overprotective of Bella for obvious reasons.  Powerful entities were seriously out to take away his reason to exist and if that's not understandable, I don't know what is. That's as far as it went.

Bella never wanted to leave Edward's side.  She didn't know what to do with herself when he wasn't around and vice versa.  In the scene with Bella hopping on Jacob's bike, it was Alice whom she gave the slip while Edward was away hunting in the book which made more sense. Whenever she tried to sneak off to see Jacob, it was usually when Edward wasn't there.

I felt that Bella was very insensitive to Edward in the movie Eclipse compared to the book and honestly, I couldn't stand her character.  I almost wished that he would have dumped her because what man should have to put up with such ridiculousness when he and his family go out of their way to protect you and your father night and day? Sometimes, in the pouring rain while you're cozy and comfortable.  Seriously not cool!

Second of all, the scene when Bella breaks her hand punching Jacob was poorly done.  In the book, Bella was extremely angry that he kissed her and almost wanted Edward to hurt Jacob.  She was by no means tried to keep them from fighting in the book.  Edward told him calmly that he'd kill him but it would upset Bella.  She huffed as if it wasn't true and he told her she'd regret it in the morning.  Then he proceeded to threaten Jacob as any man would who is face to face with the man who forced his kiss on his girlfriend. Edward was the one who took the adult and more controlled road much to Bella's disappointment.  If Edward would have grabbed Jacob the way he did in the movie, his arm would have been shattered.  Jacob has the ability to heal, but he is still part human and much more frail than a vampire.

Last but not least, the kissing scene in the forest was horrible also.  Although Edward knew Jacob was listening when he brought up the engagement, Bella and the reader understood why he did it. He'd warned Jacob that he wouldn't play far when it came to fighting for Bella so it was no surprise.  I don't know about anyone else, but I would have done the same thing.  In the movie Edward was made to look like the bad guy for hurting Jacob who honestly deserved it after all the crap he did in the book version. In the book, it was also Edward who was the one who went after Jacob and brought him back to Bella.  She never would have caught him being human and it was once again Edward who selflessly looked out for Bella's best interest.  After the kiss in the book, you could feel Bella's guilt and regret.  She swore to herself to never hurt him this way again.  But in the movie, it was like she didn't even care.  All she could say was that ""I don't know what happened."".  WTH! Is that really an acceptable excuse for making out with another guy? Hence one of the reasons I could barely stand her movie character.

I recommend that you read the book then watch the movie to fully understand the discrepancies.  I overall liked the movies, but I am not a huge fan of how Edward has been depicted.  It's not true to who he is and doesn't fully make people understand why Edward is so loved.  His character is the perfect mix of all-consuming love for Bella, protectiveness, and dominance.  I did not get this impression from the movie.",1292544000,,4108,4.3172323759791125

3814404,4,B001UV4XFQ,"As a devout Twilight series fan, and a great grandmother not a teenager, I waited impatiently for this movie. This book is one of my favorites in the series second only to Breaking Dawn. Having read Eclipse 3 times I can quote passages by heart. The movie was good and would have been better if I was not so acutely aware of the cuts and changes made to the story. The most irritating of all the changes was the mountain setting where Victoria and Riley attack Edward, Bella and Seth. This was so poorly represented that I was actually angry. It portrayed Bella as heroic and injuring herself in an attempt to distract Victoria and Riley from attacking Edward who according to the movie was in serious danger. This simply did not happen. Bella did NOT cut herself with the rock. Edward killed Riley in short order when he realized that Bella had picked up the rock and then he dispatched Victoria with ease. Bella's motivation in picking up the rock was not to save Edward but Seth. The other change came earlier and again irritated me when it was made to appear that it was Edward's idea to sit out the battle instead of the petty manipulation performed by Bella to get what she wanted. I didn't like the obvious efforts to make Bella the heroine in the movie. The only one worth their salt in the story is EDWARD. Only an immortal/non human being could continue to put up with Bella's childish behavior. Oh, and the battle that the producer/director insisted on presenting to the viewers was only briefly mentioned in the book. I fervently hope that they don't mess up Breaking Dawn by trying to change the ending and having them actually fight the Volturi, that would just be too much. Stephanie Meyer is a talented author, but once these movie people get hold of a story they simply butcher it. Now I have to read Eclipse one more time just to get the bad taste out of my mouth.",1292457600,,1882,4.489795918367347

That being said, I think Rob and Kristen do a wonderful job as do all the other actors.  My only problem with Eclipse is where it differs from the book.  Other than that I think it was pretty well done.  I am still mad about Bella's speach at the end of the movie.

Now, regarding the extras, don't get your hopes up too high.  They are not all that great.  Actually, it looks like a lot of the comments are things that have been said before.  And the deleted and extended scenes are not that great.  Just enough to make you ask,""why didn't they put that in the movie?""

The commentary with Stephenie and the producer was not good and offered very little insite into the movie.  Most of the time they were just talking about other stuff that didn't really matter to me.  Not much about the movie.

The commentary with Rob and Kristen was pretty good.  I am glad that Kristen agrees with me regarding that speech in the end!

3814409,2,B001UV4XFQ,"Love Lesson From Twilight #4,267: ""Love"" turns all guys into controlling jerks who don't do anything except compete to see whose dingdong is bigger.

Sadly that's most of what's going on in ""Twilight: Eclipse."" It's the best of the series thus far, mainly because some underdeveloped characters get some backstory and there are some interesting action scenes... but the movie is smothered in a thick coating of phlegmlike teen angst, whining and bickering. It gets to the point where you WISH the bad guys would arrive.

In summary: Edward (Robert Pattinson) is pestering Bella (Kristen Stewart) to marry him. Bella doesn't want to because (boohoo) her parents are divorced and marriage is dead to her, but she DOES want to become a vampire. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) wants Bella to dump Edward and be with him instead.

Meanwhile, the evil Victoria is raising an army of newborn vampires to come to Forks and kill Bella. Yes, seriously -- she raised an entire army to kill ONE bland human teenager. Not the Cullens, or the people of Forks. Just Bella. And since the entire universe revolves around Bella, both the werewolves and the Cullens are desperate to protect her. So they overcome centuries of mutual hatred and join forces to protect her.

I will admit it: ""Twilight Eclipse"" is easily the best movie in this series... which is like saying that a pinch is less unpleasant than a poke in the eye. Amazingly, there are actually some taut, fast-paced scenes here, as well as some creepy eerie scenes involving the newborn army (like their  too-briefly glimpsed mayhem in Seattle).

Too bad that isn't what the plot is REALLY about. Instead, we're battered with a bad teen soap opera -- lots of heavy breathing, kissing, whining, and romantic estrangements that last about two minutes. The dialogue is painfully vapid (""You love him."" ""I love you more."" ""I know""), and the director seems to be desperately trying to come up with some kind of plot other than Edward and Jacob being emo jerks.

Kristen Stewart gives her usual one-note performance -- dead eyes, masklike face and a monotone voice. And the insipid Bella just drifts through the movie, more of a living MacGuffin than a heroine. It's hard to see why not one but TWO boys would be ready to die for a boring girl who just sits there breathing through her large front teeth.

Robert Pattinson is pretty obviously just here for for his paycheck, while Taylor Lautner gives it his best effort. Unfortunately his character has turned into a controlling jerk to rival Edward, and the two male leads have more sexual chemistry with each other (the tent scene) than with the leaden Stewart. In fact, the only decent character development is given to Jasper and Rosalie, and seeing their backstories (especially Rosalie's bloodthirsty bride rampage) makes them richer and more intriguing than our bland protagonists.

""Twilight Eclipse"" is the best movie of the Twilight series.... which isn't saying much. It has some good moments, but those are smothered by all the teen soapiness.",1292371200,7,3038,4.91796875

However, I didn't bother filing a complaint, because it was a free rental, so since I didn't have to pay for anything, why should I complain?

3814486,3,B001UV4XFQ,"Eclipse is the third film in the wildly popular Twilight Saga. As of this writing it's the fourth highest grossing film of 2010, yet holds a 4.8 on imdb and a 50% on Rotten Tomatoes. No matter how hard they try, critics can't stop this franchise. I found the first two films abysmal in almost every way, but I did feel New Moon fleshed out the characters a bit more than the first film. With that said, Eclipse stands as the best film in the series...But that's not to say it's particularly good.

Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) are now officially a couple and Bella is determined to have Edward change her into a vampire after graduation. Edward, meanwhile, is determined to have Bella marry him. Bella's father Charlie (Billy Burke) wants Bella to spend less time with Edward and more time with Jacob (Taylor Lautner), who feels Bella is in love with him and would be making a mistake letting Edward change her. While the film's main focus is the love triangle between the three, the plot this time revolves around Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard, replacing a no-name actress) assembling an army of vampires to seek revenge on the Cullen clan.

The latest director to tackle the franchise, David Slade, handles this material much better than his predecessors, particularly the action scenes, but he also reinforces my opinion that no director could make this dreck convincing. Slade achieves in the film's main battle scene what Catherine Hardwicke and Chris Weitz failed to in their films, which is achieve a genuine sense of excitement and suspense even. Ah hell, it's an entertaining scene. Slade achieves something unheard of in directing one of these films, but even he can't overcome the poor script and insipid dialogue.

Nearly all the characters in these films are caricatures of people I hated in high school. Bella is such a childish, selfish protagonist you have to wonder why a vampire who is over 100 years old would even bother with her. Even more remarkable is that Jacob, despite actually being Bella's age, seems much more emotionally intelligent than Edward. I can't fathom how people take this plot seriously as a ""love story,"" when not a single moment seems natural and not a single aspect of the ""romance"" seems poignant. I noticed in the previous film that Stewart and Lautner had more chemistry than Stewart and Pattison and even offered a hint of credibility for a brief moment. While Pattinson and Stewart seem more comfortable around each other than ever before, there's still awkwardness between them that isn't there between her and Lautner.

Melissa Rosenberg (who has no business calling herself a writer) seems to have lightened up slightly on the melodramatic, repetitive drivel that's supposed to serve as dialogue but having not read the books, maybe that's because Stephanie Meyer did. With that said, there's still enough gag-worthy dialogue to complain about. Jacob's description of ""imprinting"" to Bella is so juvenile and clichd, I won't even bother typing it. With that said, the film lightens up a bit when it skates close to self-parody; I'm not going to lie, I giggled when Edward blurts out ""Doesn't he own a shirt?"" upon seeing Jacob.

After watching all three of these films I began to notice how cheeky the Twilight films can be sometimes, as if they know and expect the stupidity of their audience. An example; when Rosalie (Nikki Reed) is explaining to Bella that once she's changed, there's something she'll want more than Edward, something she'll kill for. I know she means blood, you probably know she means blood. Why then must she elaborate on it further by saying ""blood!?"" If they don't know the stupidity of their audience, they certainly share it: When Bella's mom notices the ""intense"" connection between Bella and Edward; she remarks ""You're different with him. He moves, you move. Like magnets."" Oh, what a cute piece of dialogue. Except it makes no sense, because magnets f****** repel each other!

As for the acting, it has improved over the course of three films. Pattinson doesn't look nauseous in every scene, which I applaud him for. There's actually some convincing acting between Pattinson and Lautner when discussing what's best for Bella inside a tent, if one ignores some of the ridiculous dialogue between the two. However, the confrontation between them after Jacob kisses Bella is laughably unconvincing until Lautner's hilarious delivery of ""I kissed Bella. And she broke her hand. Punching my face"" makes up for it. Bryce Dallas Howard, a capable actress, doesn't do anything miraculous as Victoria, but she doesn't embarrass herself either. Finally, I must give credit to Billy Burke. He has such a likeable presence throughout these films and he comes off so naturally as a caring father, he's one of the only actors to emerge from this series unscathed. Lastly, the wolves look more realistic in this film. The special effects are still not particularly good, but don't remain in the realm of a live-action Scooby-Doo film either.

I've heard people say about this film ""it's better than the other two, but it's still Twilight."" In many cases, this would be an unfair critique indicating a bias. In the case of this film, it's an accurate assessment. Eclipse is much better than the previous two films, but it's still a part of the poorly written, lazily acted mess that Twilight is. I will admit that Eclipse is more entertaining and more capably made than the previous two films and as Eclipse is much more of an action film than the previous two, I can actually see a bit of the appeal that has previously escaped me. With that said, Eclipse is still not a good film by any means as it's plagued with the problems of the first two. Yes, each film has been somewhat better than what came before it but it's like saying the stomach tumor was better than the brain tumor.

3814564,3,B001UV4XFQ,"Mousy Kristen Stewart, who dates outside of her species, causes a vampires vs. newbie vampires vs. werewolves war, perhaps the best scene in the movie, which lasted about two minutes. The movie is filled with numerous flashbacks, primarily to the 19th century. Unlike the Harry Potter series where the acting improves from one movie to the next, this one does not. No wait. It is not bad acting. We discover that newbie vampires are uncontrollable and emotional. Vampires that are uncontrollable must be destroyed, so only unemotional vampires, who simply appear to be bad actors survive. They in turn like the aroma of infrequent bathers and wig wearers who are also bad actors, i.e unemotional. So that explains it. They are supposed to be unemotional. Why the werewolves, who look like an underage male revue sucked, I don't know.

The most painful scenes are the one on one dialouge scenes. Here their ""unemotional"" ability comes out. Unfortunately this consists of too much of the movie as I kept yelling at the screen, ""Get on with it!"" Besides Edward's glitter, what is also unnatural is Kristen's hairline. I kept waiting for her fake hair to fall off. Young females will certainly rate this as 5 stars as the whole unnatural world is fighting over one of them, one that lacks a great body, personality, or hygiene. (Just a joke about the hygiene as everything unnatural keeps sniffing her scent.)

Kristen wants to be a vampire. Edward doesn't want her to be one. Edward wants to get married. Kristen doesn't. She wants to have sex, but Edward doesn't want to have sex out of marriage. (Guess the compromise coming in the next movie?) Dad doesn't want Kristen to date a vampire, but would rather she go out with a werewolf. The movie saga has become overly hokey.

It is unfair to say all the acting was bad. Alice Cullen was noticeably good, although she normally appears talking to Kristen. In one scene an excited Alice tells Bella, ""You will be spending the night in our house with Edward."" Bella, whose blank face doesn't even twitch, has a long dramatic Shatner-like pause, and finally remembers her line and says, ""Like, alone?"" It was MST-3000 bad. I had to laugh.

Dakota Fanning, who can act, played a very minor role where she wasn't allowed to act, just recite a few lines. The movie reminded me of ""Billy Jack"" where fans of the movie couldn't fathom why the Academy overlooked the movie, or when Star Trek fans couldn't understand why Shatner never got an Emmy. They would say, ""Maybe because William Shatner was so good as Captain Kirk, they didn't realize he was acting."" The same could be said of the Twilight series.

Those who care about extras and especially those who have friends who could use the included DVD are probably better off with the Blu/DVD combo edition. For those who only wish to watch the move, this is as good as the premium bundle and can be had for a few dollars less.

This is what you get:

- MOVIE ONLY - there are NO extras whatsoever
- BD Live (not an extra) gives access to trailers and other marketing material
- English and Spanish subtitles only
- Spanish is the only alternate audio track
- 1080p, 2.40:1 video
- DTS-HD Master Audio (English) and Dolby Digital 5.1 (Spanish) sound
- Cheap Blu case, the kind where the plastic has holes carved in it to save a few pennies

I knew what I was doing when I ordered this edition because my long-term plan is to sell the individual movies and get the final 'boxed' edition holding all movies but I did miss the extras.

For what it is, I can't find much to complain about this 'movie only' edition. It delivers what it promises. I don't particularly like the depressingly cheap looking case and, I believe, it's customary to include at least French subtitles and sound tracks on Blu-rays sold in North America but everything else is super so it's a 4-star.",1292025600,,1461,4.49811320754717
3814566,1,B001UV4XFQ,"I have read all the books and have seen all the films. Out of the three films Eclipse was the worst. I think the whole entire film was about developing Jacob's character and reducing Edward's character development. To me Edward seemed aloof and distant and the chemistry between Bella and Edward was non existent. Kristen's acting was better in New Moon than in this film. In this film Kristen's acting was very robotic.

The scene transitions were abrupt and choppy and at the end of every scene, Bella is starring off into space. Another problem, is the lack of tension between Edward and Bella, no arguing over Jacob like in the books. The conflict, calculating and over protective nature Meyer's wrote into Edward's character made the triangle between Edward,Bella and Jacob compelling. In this film the writer and director lost Edward's humorous side that existed in the Twilight film and in the books. For example, pertaining to Bella going to Florida alone, Edward writes to Bella ""with your bad luck not even the black box would have survived.""

I have seen Slade's other films Hard Candy and 30 Days. I think Slade does much better with a smaller cast where it's easier to focus on character development. By comparison, I think Weitz did a much better job directing an ensemble cast than Slade. Also, Weitz did a much better job transitioning scenes smoothly. Overall I think Twilight was better at developing character within a small cast and New Moon was better at balancing grandeur and finer moments within an ensemble cast.",1291939200,13,1537,4.885057471264368

They were great. This one the acting was horrible.i thought they would get better with each movie instead of worse. was this a new emmett also? the characters looked  like plastic.

3814647,3,B001UV4XFQ,"I cannot claim the Twilight series to be my guilty pleasure, because the series has not been all that pleasurable. The directing has been uninspired (strike 3!), the scripts have been both flat and disjointed at the same time, and the special effects have been utterly comical. And yet...I keep watching. The reason I keep coming back for more (and more and more, I'm ashamed to say) is the amazing, undeniable chemistry between Rob and Kristen...er, I mean Bella and Edward. Who cares if there was no explanation of how they got together or how they fell in love. Who cares if it all was rushed, hard to believe, and unexplained. When Rob and Kristen (er, I mean Edward and Bella) are in the same room, they breathe heavier, speak in huskier tones, and flow their words together as if they were in a lusty conversation and not just reading vacuous lines off a half-baked & sanitized script. They (the actors) can make you believe in them as a couple, and beyond that, they can remind you how totally enthralling and exciting the taste of first true love is. But I digress. Back to Eclipse. The ""newborn"" vampire plot seemed like some sort of afterthought - thankfully I first saw this on DVD and was able to fast forward through much of that contrived garbage. Jacob and Bella have even less sizzle in this movie than they did in New Moon and it shows, so I fast forwarded through most of their tiresome scenes as well. Sadly, the romance between Edward and Bella seemed forced in this film. The chemistry that was so evident in the first two films (the first especially) was glaringly lacking in this movie, for the most part. I say for ""the most part"" because there was one single scene where Bella and Edward made some sort of attempt to bring sexy back, but were thwarted yet again by Stephanie Meyer's prudish ways and poofy music playing in the background. Unfulfilled passion gets old after a while. The final few scenes were intended to be romantic, but came off as goofy and maudlin. That all being said, the often hilarious and irreverent commentary by Rob and Kristen on the bonus DVD make this set worth purchase. The chemistry that was so lacking in the movie made a good, long appearance in the commentary. It was obvious that the actors are friends and that they themselves did not feel this was the best movie to showcase their acting skills. Robert Pattinson's one-liners and witty (if not entirely sober) commentary is especially worthwhile. It's just too bad that you cannot purchase just the commentary disc, because it's really the only disc worth watching more than once. It's also too bad there isn't more Billy Burke in this movie. He must have been instructed to mumble all his lines because I had to crank the audio and/or hit English subtitles to understand what he was saying. But once I understood, I appreciated. I can only hope he gets a bigger piece of the action in the next movie, he's probably the most under-appreciated gem in the whole Twilight series.",1291852800,,2990,4.643396226415095

3814650,3,B001UV4XFQ,"There are legions of ardent fans of this Twilight Saga - this third installment is ECLIPSE - and they obviously have their reasons for loving both the books and the movies.  That's good news, especially for Stephenie Meyer who is probably only second to JK Rowling (Harry Potter series) in skyrocketing income from the transformation of book to screen adventure.  The scenery in Vancouver,BC is pretty and the music and lyrics  for the film by Howard Shore is meant to add to the story line.

The script by Melissa Rosenberg (who has done some fine work on the television series 'Dexter') is written in staccato phrases - one-liners that don't really allow the actors to express much real emotion under such confines.  For this viewer this is one of the main reasons the film doesn't fly.  Even if one can buy into the fairytale atmosphere of flatline normal human girl Bella (Kristen Stewart) falling for rather stiff and distant and oh so proper vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson, who has proven in his other films 'Remember Me' and 'Little Ashes' that he actually CAN act) while at the same time falling in love with werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner, ever more buff and using his physique to great advantage in almost every scene), there are problems with the story for the casual viewer  who hasn't read the Twilight Saga or followed the previous films.  Despite the film's building to the altercation and confrontation between Seattle vampires versus the small town Cullen vampires now supported by the town's werewolves courtesy of Jacob et al the story feels static. No emotion: script versus acting - it is a toss up.  Once again Billy Burke and Anna Kendrick (so fine in 'Up in the Air') add to the quality.  The werewolves are huge and cuddly, and the blue meadow flowers serving as background for Edward and Bella that open and close the film are nice.

And we have two more episodes to go - or more... Definitely an acquired taste. Grady Harp, December 10",1291766400,3,1964,4.76401179941003

You can tell it's a wig big time they should have found a lighter brown to match her skin tone.  My opinion Eclipse isn't as good as the first movie Twilight at all.  I think the movies would have been much better if they're all directed by Catherine Hardwicke to eliminate the jumpiness of the films to me.  You can definitely tell there were different directors and the moods and feelings of the cast shines through.  I do think the other two directors were good at they're job but Summit should have just picked one director and stayed with it.  I also think that the only real actors that were really into the movie and captivated the characters were the quilette pack, Charlie, and Alice.  The others seemed out of character from the first movie and ruined it for me.

On a good note the cgi wolves were awesome!  The fight scenes were great!  I do find it weird that when the vampires were ripped apart they crumbled like rock instead of how the would just rip apart like regular flesh in the first movie.  The crumbling effect was cool but it should have been started in the first movie not something that up and changes and they expect no one to notice.  The actor that played Riley captivated him perfectly!  He couldn't have been better!  And Jaspers accent, I know he didn't talk much in the first two movies but his accent got really thick all of a sudden in this third movie.

What us up with changing the Victoria character.  I understand Rachael L was demanding more money and the picked someone else but she didn't seem to play the character as well.  And again the wig the new girl was wearing was atrocious!  Who did the costumes and the wig picking!?!?!  They need to step back and take a look at what they send out of the trailer.  I'm not a fan of how they portrayed Bella in this movie.  She acted like a brat, ya she didn't want them to fight over her but at least act like you care for one of them.  The internal strife that Kristen tried to play was way off from the book big time.

There is also a group of newborn vampires as well as some older ones, wolves vs. vamps, and plenty of misery and angst to go around among the three leads.  Ho hum. Whatever.
This is the weakest of the books and the weakest of the movies as well.

3814815,4,B001UV4XFQ,"I got the blu-ray/dvd combo pack so I could watch the movie on all my players including my phone.  In order to play it on my phone I have to convert it on my computer, but my HP Vista computer will not even read the DVD side or recognize that anything has been put into the drive.  My old Sony Vaio reads it fine but I don't have a DVD converter program on that and don't want to spend another $40 to get a license for one.  Not even sure the old Windows XP would work with the program.  The blu-ray is great, you can see every freckle, wrinkle, etc.  The movie itself is awesome as well, much better than New Moon (I am in the Edward camp and there was not much of Edward in New Moon).  But I am wishing I had just bought the single disc DVD and to heck with the blu-ray.  I paid more money for a product I can't use for the purpose for which it was purchased.  **UPDATE 12/21...After rebooting my pc a couple of times the DVD drive finally recognized the DVD side and I was able to convert it to my phone.  I can't help but think this is due to the 2 sided disc which means you always end up with fingerprints on a playing surface.

3814816,3,B001UV4XFQ,"All in all, I say the folks in Hollywood did a pretty decent job with the third installment of the Twilight Saga. Every significant plot point was covered(some touched upon more than others), and I felt that the cinematography was a VAST improvement over the last two films. That gastly ethereal lighting from Twilight and New Moon is not present in Eclipse in such concentrated doses, and the action flows a bit more naturally. Also, despite a few overdramatic moments (notably, Jacob's sexy slow-turn introduction), the acting and dialogue showed a distinct improvement from the last two films. However, despite these positive aspects, I cannot help but feel that this film conveyed an unfair bias in Edward's favor that the book did not display. At the beginning of Stephenie Meyer's Eclipse novel, Bella was truly a conflicted young woman. Not only was she graduating high school in just a matter of weeks, but she was also dealing with having to say goodbye to her human life as she prepared to join the Cullen clan. Saying farewell brought the dual burden of convincing her parents that she going away to college in Alaska, meanwhile trying to patch things up with her werewolf best friend Jacob. But as Bella's life is put in danger and her graduation date draws near, she finds herself questioning what she really wants. Though Edward is her proclaimed true love and being apart has proved near-fatal for them in the past, she cannot help but admit that she loves Jacob as well. She admits to herself that life with him would be more practical. Not only could she stay human and have children, but she would never have to say goodbye to her friends and family--her father of whom would be totally ecstatic about her choice. However, though we all know by now that she ultimately chooses Edward in the end, the Eclipse film did not do a very good job of conveying the love triangle element. In the New Moon novel Bella and Jacob got very close, and though Edward returned and she went back to him, she still had feelings for Jake. But in the film, though Bella shows saddness in having to say goodbye to her mother and father, she has firmly decided whom she wants to be with. Instead of Jacob posing as a viable option, this film portrays him as the desperate best friend who has to resort to forcing himself on Bella to get some action. It is never any secret whom Bella really wants, and she does not reveal her true feelings for Jake as she did in the novel. Those who did not read the books before watching the movies will more than likely be confused, as the ""love triangle"" story line that they have heard so much about was not a true conflict, but instead two deeply devoted people who are constantly challenged by the girl's annoying best friend. If you are Team Edward, this bias will delight you to no end. But if you are Team Jacob--you'll be wanting to throw your DVD player against the wall 30 minutes into the film.",1291420800,3,2937,4.596190476190476

I enjoyed both of the first movies despite the fact I could see problems with both--more Twilight than New Moon.  I waited anxiously for the DVD to be released like every Twilight fan.  We put the movie in to watch and within 5 minutes I was bored.  The scenes are short and seem to be cobbled together--there is no flow.  It seems stilted.  I kept having to explain things to my husband because they chose little snippets of dialogue from the book, but put them in inappropriate places with no foundation.  It just seems that if one hadn't read the book, the movie would make little sense.  I'll watch it again because I do enjoy the characters, but with the material available in the book, this movie could have been so much  better.

3814882,2,B001UV4XFQ,"This is not a good movie, nor is it anywhere close to a faithful adaptation of Stephenie Meyer's book.  These movies, all three, make the characters out to be so shallow and immature.  The point is that Bella, who has always been very mature for her age, fits with Edward who is actually over a 100 years old, very mature and controlled.  They had them doing things in the movie that the Edward and Bella in the book would never have done.  I can't understand why Stephenie Meyer would go along with it.  It has that slick quality when watching it, and you can't get pulled into the movie or care about the characters that way.  If these movies weren't based on the best-selling books, no one would ever watch them. I am not into sci-fi or vampire movies or anything like that.  What I enjoy in the books is the romance, the give and take, and the self-sacrifice in Edward and Bella's relationship.  I enjoy reading these because of the lack of sex, etc. which just cheapens and degrades the story.  So many parts were left out, and I know it is hard to keep everything in when making a movie.  I liked Rachelle as Victoria and saw no reason for the change to Bryce Dallas Howard, except they must have thought she was a bigger name. And they made Jessica valedictorian?  Boy, was that way off!!! The scene between Bella and her father concerning sex was just ludicrous.  Oh, yuck, this was the very worst one.  I guess, out of the three, the second one has to be the best of the bunch.  These vampires are also looking a little aged!!  No romance at all!  Zero!  What a disappointment.  I love the books, really don't like the movies.",1291420800,3,1635,4.3933333333333335
3814883,2,B001UV4XFQ,"Update #2: Went to Target and purchased their version. That too is FLIPPER DISC!*argh*
All the Blu rays are flipper disc EXCEPT the movie only blu ray disc that has none of the special features. *sigh*
On the plus side there are no black pixel dots ruining the picture. The disc quality is better than the summit version I first purchased.

This review is about the DVD options to purchase. It is NOT about the movie which I thought was SPECTACULAR. Every year we do this song and dance with Summit all because of these ""exclusive"" contracts they have with different retailers. I wanted the blu- ray dvd plus a seperate dvd for roadtrips INCLUDING the special features.
Summit released NO SUCH VERSION!
Option A: Blu ray only (NO special features)
Option B: Blu ray + DVD combo single FLIPPER DISK! Can Summit get any cheaper?!

 Only individual retailers could meet my needs.... @ a sky high premium price! The Twilight series is the ONLY series customers have to jump through so many hoops for. Other studios will offer the blu ray + reg. dvd AND a DIGITAL COPY for the SAME PRICE that Summit has set for their merchandise! Summit can suck it!

WHY FLIPPERS SUCK:
Most of the problem with flippers comes from inconsistent manufacturing quality (and format quality). The discs that are used for blu rays have higher formating standard than that of a regular dvd. A dual disc ( blu ray one side/ dvd on the other) currently, does NOT confirm to the standards set for the blu ray format. Blu rays have higher storage capacity and better scratch resistance. If this disc format is NOT used to make the blu ray then you LOSE quality AND durability.

The stand alone blu ray dvd is the only true Blu ray in correct format... too bad u have to sacrifice the bonus footage (as currently package by Summit) in order to get it!

Update: I just watched the movie and unfortunately the Blu ray quality sucks.
Wish I had purchased the stand alone Blu ray disc and sacrificed the extras. *sad face*

I wish that the final confrontation scenes could of been more interesting, which would of been if Bella was put in more danger. I mean did you ever get a real sense like she was in danger? No. I just feel like they could of given the audience more for the money.

The fight scenes are cool but nothing special and I liked that we got to know the rest of the Cullens a bit more, but other than that they just cut way too much out of the storyline for it to feel ANYTHING BUT choppy... and even major points in the book were nothing but a dead pan scene.

I was OK w/that, because I got it the same day as release.

But why in the world did I bother to pre-order Eclipse, when I won't receive it until 2 days after it is released in stores?  There's not enough of a price break to justify the wait.  This has never happened to me on a pre-order w/Amazon, but it is going to cause me to think carefully about ever pre-ordering again.  Especially in the case of an eagerly-awaited release, because I will probably go to Wal-Mart and get the Blue-Ray edition at midnight tonight.  Obviously, I'll be returning my Amazon-provided copy.

3814981,4,B001UV4XFQ,"For many years young girls have fantasized of being the damsel in distress. Times due change but the main theme of a young girl needing a knight to come to rescue her continue to infuse themselves into our newest films. In a mix of vampires and werewolves, The Twilight Films have capitalized on bringing a story to the screen that satisfies the girls romanticism of stories known mostly today as fairy tales.

""Twilight: Eclipse,"" which opened last weekend is the third film in a series brought to screen as an adaption of the very popular books written by Stephenie Meyer. Bella, the central character played by Kristen Stewart, continues her relationship with her vampire boyfriend Edward, portrayed by Robert Pattinson. Bella is a self-admitted awkward teenager and her character has more complicated decisions than most teenagers. About to graduate from high school, it's not what college to select that concerns her. Her desire to be a vampire and evolve into a new and strange world is her main desire. Yet, there are battles to be won and hearts to be broken before things resolve. Taylor Lautner returns as Jacob along with all the vampires as well.

""Twilight: Eclipse"" is a fair film on it's own, but for Twilight fans it is the best of the three films. This film has had a special effects upgrade and the story line allows the us to see in the past of the vampires long lives. There are quite a few breaks of humor that sparkle in the mist of such a dark story of even a darker world. Billy Burke, as Bella's father, provides the necessary anchor to make the story effective and he and Kristen Stewart share a few good father/daughter moments.

It is truly a mistake to see this movie without viewing the previous films ""Twilight"" and ""New Moon,"" which luckily are out on DVD. If you are ready for two hours of vampires, werewolves and more teenage angst than the prom, this is the film for you. And as the Twilight fans already know that this is not the finish for the series of films. Twilight: Breaking Dawn will be sent to theaters in two parts. Part one to air in 2011 and part two to follow in 2012.

3814982,3,B001UV4XFQ,"I'm wondering how many other fans didn't like it as much as they thought they would? Especially if it was your favorite book too. I never thought I would be disappointed with the movie adaption, but I left the theater wondering why they kept Melissa Rosenberg on when she keeps messing up the movies. Twilight & New Moon were pretty good, but Eclipse could have been soooo much better. This is why I was disappointed:
1) The pace was choppy and it didn't flow right
2) The good scenes were not long enough (i.e. fight prep)
3) Bella did not shed a tear and she cried a lot in the book, especially when she realized she loved Jacob and then felt more guilty because of Edward
4) When Bella was kissing Jacob, they should have flashed to her thoughts about what her life would have been like with Jacob (2 little kids with dark hair running into the forest), etc. - so to me that scene kinda of left me deflated
5) Even the fight scene which was pretty good was not as riveting as it could be plus it was too short- i.e. not vampire body parts crawling to find other body parts. I also didn't like Edward almost losing & Bella coming to his rescue. In the book, she didn't know Seth was faking being hurt. Plus they didn't show how fast the vampires could move where Bella couldn't see how Edward was doing while fighting Victoria.
6) I miss Rachele L. as Victoria. The new Victoria was okay doing the sweet parts with Riley, but she was not scary like Rachele was.
7) There wasn't enough dialouge with Charlie & Bella like there was in the books - Charlie is a key character that they should show more
8) There were a lot of lines from the book this time, but sometimes the wrong characters were saying them (Carlisle was saying Alice's lines at the party). Plus I missed some like ""go fetch a space heater"" ""A little stoned. Dr. Fang isn't sure how much pain medication I need"", etc.
9) I thought MR completely missed the mark with Alice's party ... I liked the dialouge between Jacob & Bella in the beginning and then Alice telling Jacob about the army that was coming... I don't get why MR had to change it all up.
10) MR made Jacob too serious and not as funny as Stephanie Meyer wrote his character
11) I didn't like Bella's speech at the end... she would NEVER want to become a VAMPIRE without Edward. She doesn't realize until BD that she shined in the vampire world. Plus it 'was' a choice between Edward & Jacob... SM said she wanted Bella to see everything she would be giving up.
12) When they lead into BD, how will they explain that the Denali family bailed on them in Eclipse?
13) I think the first kiss between Bella & Edward in the first movie, Twilight, had more sparks
14) the tent scene was a pivotel part of the book, yet Jacob was sitting in a weird seemingly uncomfortable position and it was distracting - they definetely could have done it better

I enjoyed the audio book more than the movie if that's any indication. I did give it 3 stars because it had some good moments. I suppose if I didn't read the books, I may have enjoyed it more ...",1290902400,5,3066,4.31369150779896

Personally as a 35 old mother I didn't think that this whole ""Twilight"" vampire/werewolf phenomenon would last very long. When I first heard of the Twilight movie I told my daughter I was not going to take her to the movies to see something about vampires. So, when the DVD came out she begged me to buy it for her so I broke down and did I have to say to my surprise I really truly enjoyed the movie I had an instant romance with Jacob Black although they didn't show him as often as they did in New Moon I still officially became a part of Team Jacob. Of course that is my sons name but still have you seen his abs wow LOL anyway I have become a really great fan of the Twilight Saga and I if you think that is great check out Vampire Diaries you want to see some hot vampires they put Edward to shame seriously it come on the CW Thursday nights @ 8pm. I am so addicted to that show, But, back to the topic of Eclipse this movie was amazing from beginning to end personally I think Bella Swan is a tease and that is how they portray her character I feel that she changes her mind too much one minute in the Twilight she is absolutely obsessed with Edward then he bails on her and she turns to Jacob of course at first it is nothing other then a friendship but then Jacob has to go and confess his feelings to her and that is where the story gets complicated first Jacob makes a promise to Bella that he would never leave her then he turns around and does exactly that. I didn't understand that part or why Stephanie Myers chose to have Jacob leave Bella after he promised her he wouldn't because that is what Edward did to her after endangering her life. So, for me New Moon was a little more confusing and the story kind of went in circles for me until the end but of course leaving the world hanging with a proposal I mean come on you know how long we had to wait. Then as I am watching Eclipse I mean come on why make Bella want to initiate the sex it is bad enough personally she is coming off as a tease as it is she is leading two arch enemies along. She is constantly telling Jacob that she loves him but then she tells Edward the same thing it really doesn't make sense then she clobbers Jacob right in the face when he kisses her and then she begs him to kiss her I mean that to me spells TEASE. I enjoyed the movie I just wasn't sure why Stephanie Myers portrays Bella Swan as a tease. I feel that she is torn between two people but they both abandoned her when she needed them the most.

3815041,2,B001UV4XFQ,"I enjoyed Eclipse, the book, but was not expecting a whole lot considering the first two movies. My first bone to pick is with the hair and makeup department. I did miss Rachelle as Victoria, but I like Bryce D Howard as an actress and she was good here, but who on earth put her in the hideous wig? Her real hair is much prettier. She looked like the love child of Bozo and Raggedy Ann. Jackson/Jasper's wig was better in this one than New Moon at least. Edward's hair has not been bronze (his trademark in the book) since the first movie. It's sad when Hardwicke, with virtually no budget, gets the hair and makeup the best out of the three. Rosalie/Nikki's wig was the best of the wigged cast. Bella/Kristen's wig looked like the one Jacob/Taylor wore in the first movie and Carlisle/Peter's wig looks like a hairspray helmet. These things bug me because they are easy to get right. Emmett/Kellan looked like he showed up at the wrong set and meant to play Spock.

Taylor shines as usual. Loved Jasper's story and Jackson's chemistry with Ashley Greene (Alice). I wish we got more of Rosalie's history. It's one of the more interesting parts of the book, IMO. Although playing adversaries, Taylor and Rob have wonderful chemistry. Unfortunately, the only person Kristen seems to have chemistry with is Taylor. She acts apathetic during the make-out scene on the bed and during the proposal, but that's normal for her. I watched the first Twilight with an open mind, but I now can predict how she plays pretty much any role: gape, deep intake of air, run hands through hair, stutter, blink, repeat. She did the same thing in Into The Wild and Adventureland. (Sorry, I think she's over rated.) Since she's the main character, she should mostly carry the film, but she drags it down. I also think that Melissa Rosenberg must have been cheap because I can think of no other reason they keep her after all this time. I know movies are rarely as good as the book, but MelRose skewers the script.",1289865600,13,1992,4.595505617977528
3815042,5,B001UV4XFQ,"Ask any of my friends, I'm a Twilight fanatic (& I'm 50!)!  I like many others dismissed this series as being juvenile, without investigating it myself...until I was stuck in O'Hare for 4 hours and had read every magazine available!  Because this Saga starts out in high school doesn't make it young adult...I believe this seris is adult.  Stephenies publisher simplified the first three books because THEY saw this as young adult.  That was her initial book deal, three books. Breaking Dawn is the 4th and marvelously different. Eclipse and Breaking Dawn are my favorite books, though Twilight is a close 2nd to these two because they introduced these wonderful characters. This film captured the book as much as was humanly possibly in the time they had... I believe all three films would have benefitted from an additiona 10-20 minutes each (especially New Moon - which destroyed Bella and Edwards reunification in dialogue, action & sequence of events).  Eclipse had David Slade - who would have thought it would have taken him to finally complete the picture for this series!!?!  David did it! - Secondly, he knew the talent he had before him... Kristen, Rob, Ashley, Billy, Taylor.. this guy knew what he had and he knew how to direct his talent!  These young people are oh so talented and perfectly cast, but you have to be able to direct young people to get the most out of them - that's what Catherine knew (and Chris forgot!).  Twilight Saga is not just a story line and script on auto pilot and you need to work to translate what we (the fans!) Love!  David Slade did that - Rob did his best work to date - when Bella says ""yes"" to marriage - in the book it says (paraphrased) he looked as glorious as an archangel - and Rob pulls that off - as I believe no one else ever could.  Rob is Edward personified, but he cannot do this alone - it takes direction, proper editing & decent dialogue...ECLIPSE is excellent!!! Many who have pooh-pooh'd these movies dig ECLIPSE - because this movie, as in the books, the adult portion of the series really takes over... I wish David Slade was directing Breaking Dawn - Let's hope this new director can garner the same measure of action/edge/emotion and atmosphere that is the Twilight Saga & can direct these actors in the manor they deserve and require - ECLIPSE ACHIEVED THAT!",1289865600,4,2328,4.65609756097561

I went to see this movie on opening night and even though the theatres were packed it seemed like you were the only one there. It followed the book very well and gave the audience the images to go along with the book. The way they introduced all the characters into the movie was extraordinary as well. The special effects were completely awesome and gave more to the movie than just the storyline. The fight scenes that went down between the vampires kept the viewer on the edge of their seats during that time. The only thing I wasn't entirely crazy about was the ending of the movie. They left it with such suspense and makes you want to see the next movie right now. But, unfortunately it isn't coming out until November 2011.

3815128,5,B001UV4XFQ,"New to the world of the Twilight Saga? If yes keep reading.

If you are looking for a new fantasy adventure series to fall in love with believe me you are making the right choice. If you love the harry potter books and inspired films by JK Rolling then you will love the books and inspired films by Stephanie Myer. Twilight Eclipse is the third movie and book and to fully appreciate this film I suggest you watch the two films before it and read the books Twilight and New Moon. If you are a parent trying to get your child interested into more history books and movies the twilight saga is a great place to start. Stephanie Myer really did her homework for creating the world of twilight. Readers and viewers will get an in depth view of what life was like in the early centuries especially in the twilight saga eclipse film. Watch Rosalie's pre vampire world of life in the 1930's and Jaspers life as a younger calvary solider. This movie will surely inspire anyone to learn more about history. The music can also inspire viewers to appreciate the art of classical music. Howard Shore's production of each musical piece really helps set the mood for the world of twilight and the most important band muse give our action adrenaline junkies something too. In fact had it not been for the band muse none of this would have been possible since their music is what inspired stephanie myer to write the book.

Looking to broden your horizons of literature, music and above all fun then buy this movie if anything it will give you something to smile about and with the way things are in the world today what wrong with something to brighten up your day?  Absolutely nothing. Smile, laugh and enjoy eclipse and mark your calenders for the final chapter in the twilight saga breaking dawn coming to theaters November 18, 2011 for part one and November 16,2012 for part 2. I am literally bursting at the seems for those two films to come out next and I am counting down the days until December 4 of this year for the eclipse dvd to be released.",1288396800,,2038,4.487870619946092

Weitz gave us Zombie Edward & Bella.  Better special effects & cinematography though.  Sreenwriter is still a problem. Eclipse!  Definitely better than the previous two. Fast paced, more action, more  romance.  However, they tried to pack lots of stuff in and missed the most important parts. (From the moment the first film hit it big the focus has been on making the films more male-friendly.)  Fave scenes the sleep-over-from the time he met her at her truck to the leg-hitched.  Oh if only they got that part right! The tent scenes was ok.  Edward's reaction to Bella's cheating on him with jacob-beautiful in the book,ruined in Eclipse.  Things really got worse with that silly speech by Bella at the end ""it's not about you Edward""  Seriously what was that screenwriter reading.?  After three books it wasn't about Edward at all. OMG!

3815262,3,B001UV4XFQ,"Eclipse is by far the better movie. I hated Twilight and actually fell asleep the first time I saw it because it moved so slowly and the characters weren't as well defined as they are in the book. I did decide to take another look when it came to cable and decided it wasn't the actors who trashed the movie but the director and screenwriter. The actors were uncomfortable and awkward in the movie because that's how they were depicted in the books. Everyone. Charlie and Bella weren't physically affectionate. Bella was an outsider in AZ, therefore felt awkward in Forks. Edward was afraid he'd kill Bella and felt physical pain when he was near her because he wanted to kill her. So after re-watching it, I got it, but it was not translated to the screen how/why Bella and Edward were so passionate about each other.

Fast forward to New Moon and Eclipse. Thank goodness they got new people behind the scenes because the movies began to improve. Edward was a bit more emotional in Eclipse than he should've been with Jacob. Jacob, in the books is a bit immature and silly and Edward is, afterall 109+ so he's more of a grown-up. He's more in control. They really need to work on Edward and Bella's passionate scenes. These two should be slobbering all over each other and breathing heavy until Edward comes to his senses and pushes Bella away. That's what you got from the books, but it's not intense in the movies as it should be.

Hopefully all that pent up angst will be shown in Breaking Dawn and not PG as it was in the books. Bella and Edward should get down and dirty and show more passion for each other.

But I loved the movie anyways, but I will continue to read the book to get the parts I felt should have made it into the movie. Robert and Kristen have great Chemistry together in the movie.
What I would have like to have seen...is Bella Snicking off to see Jacob and Edward tailgating her starting at the boundry line until she reached Angela's house, and Edward waiting for her in her room until she got home to explain how worried he was. Also would have like to seen how Bella gets ""held Hostage"" by Alice per Edward after her snicking off to see Jacob, it tells how she got the yellow Turbo Pousche, it just appears in the movie and those who have not read the book won't understand how she recieved it. I also would have like to have seen Edward coming home from his ""Trip"" and waking Bella up and how both were so mad at each other, but then just wasn't after they saw each other after a day or two apart. During this scene I would have loved to hear and see the situation for the one liner (in the book) ""I was all braced for the wrath that was going to put grizzlies to shame, and this is what I get? I should infuriate you more often.""

I also would have preferred the way Bella asked Edward to stay with her that was portraded in the book. It was more romantic. The Tent scene is my favorite of them all, but I was wanting to see bella beg for edwards to hate her after her kiss with Jacob and then Edward ripping their way out of the tent at the thoughts of Victoria and Riley approching, with him Protecting Bella, I didn't see any of that. I also wanted to see more of Charlies hatred for Edward that we didn't get to see at the End of New Moon.

I give the movie 5stars anyways. I think the actors did a wonderful job bring the charaters to life. Still the Best movie of the saga's. I wish it followed the book, page by page, but it turned out great regardless.",1286323200,4,2049,4.0818858560794045
3815381,5,B001UV4XFQ,"The thing that grabs so many people in the twilight series is the agelessness. If you are a teenager the appeal is obvious, but those of us that are no longer teens, it helps us remember and ask again ""is there such a thing as unconditional love""? I once believed so and this allows us to dream again. It also makes me want a ""do over"" and has made me reassess my look on life. Each movie gets a little better as far as technical aspect. I bought a new HD 3D t.v. just in case Breaking Dawn is in 3D but it, also, allows me to see, close up, the changes from movie to movie. The make up has improved drastically and the contact lenses have also become more pronounced which in Eclipse was not a good thing for Robert Pattinson because the gold contacts made him look blind in some scenes although he compensated beautifully. Although I really disliked the ending, I was impressed with him in Remember Me. He is an original. I foresee an Oscar in his future if he can deal with all that comes with such huge change his life. Kristen Stewart is a little less ""twitchy"" in Eclipse and definitely seems more at ease in her skin. It has been fascinating to watch her transform from gawky teen to the sophisicated Bella in Breaking Dawn. Taylor Lautner does well but I have a hard time watching him because his description in the book has him as a very tall man which he obviously is not but does not keep me from enjoying his performance. I admire his dedication to his role.
I am very disappointed with the release date of Eclipse and Breaking Dawn. The fans have been very good to all involved in the Twilight series and I feel it is not being reciprocated. If the dvd release date were sooner, it would give people, in this economy , time to buy more than one Eclipse Christmas gift which, I believe, is the reason behind the long release date.
I urge everyone to treat themselves to this dvd, in my opinion, is the best in the trilogy so far as the acting, technical and quality of the movie over all. Enjoy the visit to unconditional love",1286064000,11,2038,4.309895833333333
3815382,3,B001UV4XFQ,"To be clear from the beginning: I am not a Twilighter or Twi-hard or any of the those other monikers applied to obsessive fans of the series. Also, I found the first movie to be subpar in terms of storytelling, yet better than New Moon in terms of action. (Don't get me wrong, I liked watching Edward get his ass handed to him by Felix as much as the next guy, but a few minutes of vamp smackdown does not a good action sequence make.)

Let us also establish that I have been a member of Team Jacob from the beginning. Why? I believe that the underdog (no pun intended) should have a fair chance at love without having to compete with some pretty boy that can give a woman eternal youth and vitality.

As to the Bella/Edward/Jacob love triangle as it applies to Eclipse, it boils down to Bella's desire to become a vampire, Edward's refusal to change her without fulfilling some derranged marriage fantasy, and Jacob's antagonistic views on anything concerning vampirism. Basically it's--

Bella: ""Change me, Edward.""
Edward: ""I don't want to, but I will if you marry me first.""
Jacob: ""No, Bella. Stay human and choose me.""
Bella: ""Sorry, Jacob. I only love you as a friend.""

Then rinse and repeat as necessary.

I do, however, have good things to say about the director. Given that he has this lousy storyline to work with, at least he brought some action to this installment. Meyer's books have a tendency to build up suspense to a breaking point, then fail to fulfill those promises. At least Slade mananged to give the movie some parts where a genuine sense of danger manages to dissolve the mushy, crappy romance angle when it desperately needed it.

As far as Breaking Dawn goes, my masochistic tendency to follow a story through to the end will not permit me to miss the chance to observe and carefully dissect everything that will be wrong with that train-wreck waiting to happen.

3815469,4,B001UV4XFQ,"First I'll say it: I am a ""Twihard"".

My sister-in-law told me about the books right around the time the third one was released and I thought love triangle, vampire, mortal girl, werewolf? Lame!

But long about August 2008 I went to Borders and noticed that Twilight was everywhere. Breaking Dawn, the fourth installment in the series, had just been released and apparently that was quite the reason for celebration, and Borders looked like there had been a Twilight explosion.  And for some reason, that intrigued me.  I'm a jump on the bandwagon type of gal, after all.

So I went home that day, downloaded a sample of Twilight for my Kindle, and I've never looked back!  When I heard they were making movies, I think my heart actually twittered, or I was twitterpated, or whatever.  I was excited!  But ""Twilight"", the movie, left me wanting.  Wanting more of the book, wanting a new cast, wanting more color and less blue tinge, wanting more special special-effects...basically wanting a do over.  As a true fan, I actually felt robbed.  What could have been so awesome, was so not!

But faced with no other choice, I accepted what wasn't and moved on to the anticipation of ""New Moon"".  And ""New Moon"" was better, way better.  More color, better special effects, better directing, better abs, etc.  Clearly, more money in filmmaking has its advantages!

Eclipse, the third book, is almost my favorite book in the series; Twilight remains number one, but Eclipse is a very close second, very close, like this close ||.  I was excited for Eclipse to be turned into a movie and the improvements in ""New Moon"" from ""Twilight"" made the anticipation that much more sweet.

I am happy to report that I was NOT disappointed.  ""Eclipse"" was a great movie!  It stayed true to the book and included all my favorite parts from the book.  The acting...well, still not great and I still wish we could start over with a new cast, but the rest of it was quite good.  This film also really earned it's PG-13 rating.  There was more romance, some sexual references, and a lot more violence.  Luckily decapitated and dismembered vampires don't bleed or some of those children in attendance might have been scarred for life.

3815472,5,B001UV4XFQ,"After seeing the first two Twilight movies and the big glaring omissions they left out from the books or completely changed, I was very afraid that my favorite book in the saga would be ripped to shreds and the movie would be horrible.  Because that's what happened with Twilight.  We ended up with over two hours of Kristen Stewart stuttering her way through a love story with a vampire.  New Moon, wasn't much different, except she was stuttering with werewolves.  So, I could only imagine what they would do with Jasper's backstory (which was one of my favorite parts of the book), the big fight sequence at the end, and the near sex Bella and Edward have.

Thankfully, David Slade (whose movies I have never seen, because I have a strong aversion to bones being broken) came through, and made this movie shine like the saga should've been handled from the beginning.  There was humor, great action, passion, jealousy, and believable vampires.  For the first time, Jackson Rathbone shined as Jasper, because he wasn't hidden in the shadows like they had him in the first two movies.  Kristen Stewart, seemed believable (even with the crappiest wig on Earth) when she kissed Jacob.  I still have issues with her ability to kiss her supposed real-life boyfriend who plays her immortal beloved in the movies.  I think the thing that grabbed my attention was the lack of chasteness.  In the first two books, Edward and Bella have strong lusty feelings.  But for some reason, they were more suppressed in the film.  Finally in Eclipse, the hesitancy is gone and it was much closer to the book in content.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone.  Obviously, you shouldn't have pre-conceived notions about the movies/books, but this one is definitely the best of the series.",1283990400,6,1772,4.821192052980132

3815474,2,B001UV4XFQ,"I have seen all three movies in the theater (and yes I went to go with my wife). After seeing the last installment I now know why these movies absolutely do not work for me. (I have not read any of the books, and please don't use that as an excuse as to why I don't like the movies).

The Twilight series is filled with interesting characters and has a lot of interesting plot developments in it. Unfortunately the story follows the three worst characters and instead of concentrating telling the story of one of five to six interesting stories, it focuses on what is supposed to be a love story.

I'll start with the characters......

Bella Swan is a despicable person with no redeeming qualities. Would anyone actually want to even be associated with Bella Swan in real life? All I know is that she puts every single person in danger (including the vampire she is presumably in love with) all for purely selfish reasons. If her vampire plaything isn't around she decides to toy with the idiot werewolf boy who for some reason decides he likes this moping, selfish, unfriendly person. Has Bella Swan (which is a stupid name anyhow) ever uttered anything at all interesting or positive in the course of three movies?

Let's move on to Edward. You would think after centuries of existing he would have A) found something better to do with his time than to graduate high school repeatedly? B) Developed at least a smidgeon of a personality C) Had enough time to find someone in this world that could offer him something more than Bella Swan? I get he can't read her mind (which he sees as a positive), but maybe that's because she doesn't have much in that head of hers? Honestly?

And that leaves our pathetic werewolf pal who marches around shirtless (a joke about his shirtless ways was written in the Eclipse movie). He at least has a motorcycle hobby and outwardly seems friendly in the 1st movie (until he becomes a werewolf) and then because he becomes a central figure in this movie he must relinquish all semblance of a personality and become mad/sad. Why do I call this character pathetic? Because to constantly chase after someone who has been so outwardly disrespectful and just plain mean to you shows he has very little self respect for himself.

And now why I don't think the ""love"" triangle works. First, none of the characters are likable or compelling as explained above. Secondly, other than saying they love each what has happened to make me believe it? I know Edward has saved Bella a few times (because she needlessly puts herself in danger, because she's moody, reckless and selfish) so maybe I can buy Bella liking Edward. But other than not reading her mind there's no reason for this vampire to like this girl (I guess her blood smells good, but that's more reason to kill her right?). I could care less who ends up with this girl. As far as I'm concerned, whoever does is the loser in this triangle.

While watching the Eclipse, I felt the father echoed my thoughts. He seems bewildered at all the situations around him. Can't understand his daughter, doesn't like Edward. But he does really like Edward's sister Alice and so do I!

Imagine how much better of movie or series it could be if it followed the character of Alice? Or how about the doctor vampire father? Or what about Jasper from the 1800's? Or even the vengeful vampire girl that kills her rapist attackers from the 1900's? Or what about the group of Werewolves that are eager to kill and seem to at least have fun together? Or....well you get the idea. All of the characters are more proactive in what seems to be a larger picture. Our characters are far more concerned about laying in fields of flowers saying they love each other. In between that we the audience are treated to ridiculous jealous banter between two immature idiots (the vampire vs. werewolf boy).

So anyway, there is a lot to like in this series but instead we get left with the worst trio of characters possible in the movie. It could be a simple fix too. Why not give Bella a bigger destiny than just becoming a vampire's wife? (if there is one we should have had a lot more foreshadow) Why not make her a key player in a bigger story (and no, having a vamoire baby is not a bigger story). Would it be too much to have them fall in love while trying doing something interesting on the behalf of something larger in scale than themselves? What if she could be a key part of a prophecy that helps mankind or vampirekind? Then it would make a little bit of sense that Edwards entire family and the entire werewolf clan puts their lives on the line to protect her while Edward, Bella, and Werewolf boy hide on a mountaintop out of harms way. And by the way if you are trying to make out a vampire army sound invincible at least have one member from the ""heroes"" side die, even a side character would be a start. I don't believe that band of young vampires was very formidable since all twenty or thirty were killed without them barely inflicting any damage to the good guy side. It's all just fluff in the end, nothing really happened.

So blah! Tell me why I'm wrong Twilight fans. While you do that please tell me what redeeming values Bella Swan has without telling lies or using references from the book series. Any positive character traits at all? Good luck.",1283126400,23,5322,4.534375
3815475,5,B001UV4XFQ,"I've read the books, and despite all the hype decided to watch New Moon and Eclipse this week. I was really impressed with Eclipse. What the first two movies lacked was direction, in each scene of Eclipse the actors understand their motivation and we get a lot of true emotion. The movie is also very beautiful, as it should be. Every time I've visited the Peninsula I've been blown away by its beauty.

I thought this was Robert Pattinson's best film, he revealed Edward's vulnerability and heart. This is a man who has faced losing the woman he loves and now only wants what is best for her. He seems like the bad boy, and yet he won't let Bella go too far without marrying him!

Taylor Lautner has been very believable in both New Moon and Eclipse, he's the loyal nice guy that you would take home to your parents and buy a house with. In Eclipse he was raw emotion without going over the top. He appears briefly in the first movie Twilight, and is really sweet. Again this is the kind of boyfriend you want ladies!

Kristen Stewart plays Bella, and for me she is what a lot of us were as teenagers: depressed, lacking self confidence and unaware of how beautiful we are. Kristen has the hardest role, being torn between two men she loves in different ways. With all of their appeal, how could you decide? Why would you want to choose?",1283126400,8,1338,4.4089068825910935

This review is based on the dvd version of Eclipse.

We found the film unbearably boring, from beginning to end.
It's like a talkfest for the teens.
The 1st hour and half is mostly talk, talk, talk with intermittent short action sequences which
were poorly staged.
With such a popular and lucrative film franchise, why did the producer or filmmaker staged
the snow sequence with fake snow and in the studio with some CGI instead of
going to the real snow capped mountain?
The grand finale seemed like a repeat of one of the fight sequences in the open field
between the vampires and the wolves but without the urgency and power.
That highly expected crucial final sequence was again poorly staged without a hint of excitement.

3815534,4,B001UV4XFQ,"I enjoyed this film more than ""New Moon,"" but not quite as much as the original ""Twilight."" I won't go into details about the plot, as I'm sure most moviegoers have already read the book. For the most part, the film sticks pretty close to the novel. There are some great fight scenes, lots of Bella/Edward/Jacob drama, etc. I freely admit that Stephenie Meyer is a terrible writer, but I love all things vampire and these stories totally draw me in.

The movie does a good job of cleaning up some of Meyer's ridiculous dialogue, although some lines are still comically bad. Other things that bugged me were that the outlines of the Cullen's amber contact lenses were clearly visible on screen, Bella's longer hairdo was so obviously a wig, and the outdoor scenes that took place on a snowy mountaintop were so clearly superimposed that it was almost ridiculous. Also, although all the cougars out there will be thrilled with the many shirtless Jacob scenes in ""Eclipse,"" what really stuck out even more is Taylor Lautner's bad acting. (I mean, it is REALLY bad.) I was not too thrilled with the new Victoria (although she has better hair than the other one). I will say that Robert Pattinson's acting has gotten much better than it was in the last film, and my favorite scenes were by far the ones that included Bella's dad, Charlie, who always manages to steal the show with his one-liners.

Despite all the silliness, if you appreciate these movies for what they are (vampire fluff), I'm sure you will enjoy ""Eclipse,"" as did I (although I laughed through the whole thing).",1279324800,4,1575,4.702898550724638

The Cullens - you can clearly see the different styles of directing in each movie.  I believe the director gave them(the actors) a bit more freedom to have fun with their character case and point Jasper.  This character is so much more cooler now than in the last two movies. He is isn't so stiff any more.  Edward is much cooler now too, the last two movies never showed much of his humor and his emotions..yes he has emotions...

Bella - much much  better, she seems more human now....

3815618,3,B001UV4XFQ,"So yeah, after the bad taste of the first two movies, this is actually the good one! But its still a bad movie. Do the actors improve? Yes, albeit slightly. Some of the supporting vampires actually get lines, two of which actually get backstories and characterization (something that these movies don't like to elaborate on). Though the woman who plays the vampire wife (I honestly don't remember her name, they never say it in this one) I pity because she literally has no lines in the entire movie until the end when they're defending the pointless new-born vampire. Even the werewolf flashback was better than the main story. The story should've been about the people with interesting histories, not some stupid idiot who wants to sell her soul just to become a blood-thirsty killer. Where's the logic. Oops, forgot, there is no logic here. Yet Bella is the worst female character ever written. She thinks her life is tortured yet she has two guys chasing after her! Then, being the jerk she is, plays on their emotions. Like after she kisses the werewolf and finds out Edward is standing right behind her. And the fact that she was stupid enough to not to wear a coat in the mountains (she really just wanted the Perpetually Shirtless Werewolf to get in the sack with her. I don't buy that ""constant hot temperature"" thing)! Though the funny part was she breaks her hand after punching him! I'd watch that scene in a loop if could and still find it funny! And of course let's not forget (though I can understand why you would seeing as how she has TWO SCENES in the whole movie) our Gratuitous Celebrity Cameo; Dakota Fanning! Why she gets so much acclaim I'll never know. Her character is pointless to the plot and I know what she makes people see when she tortures them (it's the first two movies). Action finally occurs though there's only two bits; first is a chase sequence that goes no where except to reintroduce the minor annoyance that is Victoria (who they could've done the story without) and finally the big fight between the good guys and the bad guys. And I must ask if there's any real reason why the vampires break like glass or if we're supposed to accept that it comes with their glitter skin? It's a decent fight but I don't get why the good vampires were so concerened about the new-borns, I'm pretty sure they could've beaten them without the werewolves. Howard Shore picks up the music department in this, which probably makes it feel more legitimate to me, but knowing that he's degrading himself after doing Lord of the Rings is disappointing (but a paycheck's a paycheck). All in all, it was a decent movie and I'm glad to see that they are improving but for a non-fan like myself who's just now saying that the third movie is the good one is pretty bad considering most movies with a part three are generally considered the worst and never live up to the first two. I only hope that the next two parts (ripping off Harry Potter?) will be just as mildly satisfying.",1278892800,,2994,4.587686567164179
3815619,4,B001UV4XFQ,"I thoroughly enjoyed this third installment of the Twilight series.  It begins with an attack on a rainy night at a dock in the Seattle area.  The next day, the newspapers are talking about a serial killer in the Georgetown Alley area.  Bella's father, Charlie (the Forks policeman), talks with the parents of a missing teenage boy.

Bella and Edward are still talking about their future, and this time about marriage. Bella still wants to be ""turned"" so she can NOT grow old with Edward.  She believes that right after upcoming graduation might be a good time. Not knowing about the upcoming wedding plans, Charlie wants Bella to see other friends, including Jacob (the werewolf), and spend a little less time with Edward.  Bella tries to re-establish contact with Jacob.  At the same time, she begins to think in terms of doing her ""farewells"" to people (like mom) who she won't see after she becomes a vampirette.

Meanwhile, there is a group of ""Newborns"" forming a small army under Victoria.  The lively redheaded bloodsucker is still after Bella to revenge the death of her former bloodsucking beau.  (The Newborns are the term given to newly made vampires. In their first year of being turned, they are incredibly strong and vicious.) Victoria's plan is to use her army to destroy the Cullens and get Bella.

Jacob also expresses his love for Bella and we again meet the werewolf clan, who agree to help with the Newborn situation. The Volkirie also appear to put their 2 cents in. (The head of the Board of Vampires.)

The storyline is enjoyable, the scenery is great, and I love the wolves.  They are huge and so neat looking.  BTW, I have not read any of the books, so my review is based strictly on following all 3 movies.

So, should Bella marry Edward and become a vampiress, or should she marry Jacob and have wolf puppies? Both guys love her. (Personally, I would take the guy with the body heat! Aaaaaa-oooooooooo!)",1278892800,,1931,4.705357142857143

I WANT her!""  And just a personal observation, but that's about the sorriest excuse for an engagement ring I've ever seen.

I don't feel, even in the books, Edward gets developed well until at least Eclipse. Bella's ""addiction"" (as Jacob refers to it) fails to make any sense, given how little she knows Edward. Anyway, I loved the action sequences in this film; I would have liked more of them.  It seems the best action sequences were in the trailer ads for the film. Personally, I view Victoria's hold over Riley in the book as seductive or sexual. Bryce Dallas Howard can't DO seductive, so her character's hold on Riley in the film is inexplicable. Rochelle was much better as Victoria. I also wish that Warner Brothers, who also went cheap with Harry Potter after the first few films, would advance the money for them to rehire Carter Burwell for the music. He set mood beautifully in the first film. All the composers, though well-known for composing other film soundtracks, hired since Burwell are mediocre for this series.

3815623,4,B001UV4XFQ,"Prior to going to the theatre, I sat down to watch the first two installments of the Twilight saga; as a habit, I try to re-watch movies whenever a sequel comes out, just to get an idea of how the series progressed and developed. And in all honesty, both contributed to my overall impression and appreciation of Eclipse.

Twilight is a movie I've never really had an opinion on one way or another; it wasn't the greatest movie I've ever seen, but it wasn't a complete train-wreck. Looking back at it now, I have to say that it is very painful to watch. I, personally, found this first installment to be very mediocre and primitive. Everything in it--the corny music, the blue filters, the choppiness, the transition, the plot selection--felt like a crappy teen flick. But the weakest point of this movie was the lead acting, so weak in fact, that it made the story more difficult to watch. The entire time, I could not focus on anything but the fact that Kristen Stewart kept letting her mouth hang open and scoffing/sighing with every line, while a somewhat aggressive Rob Pattinson kept awkwardly twitching and cringing as if he was in pain. There was no buildup to the romance whatsoever, and it left me wondering why Bella and Edward were even a couple. It wasn't until I got the books for Christmas that I read the story and figured out what was supposed to happen.

New Moon was a fair improvement, coming from a director whose work I generally like. The music selection was much better and more appropriate, the graphics a bit more exciting and the color-scheme more natural. Can't say that the transitions from every scene were done well; this movie still felt like it could be more uniform. And I absolutely loved the entire sequence in Voltera, Italy; that depiction alone is reason enough not to discount New Moon's cinematography. But though this movie was well-shot and produced, once again, the lead acting lacked. Rob made a change, which unfortunately went in the other direction, making him too robotic and emotionless. In my mind, I started to question whether he even had any talent or was just a poor actor. It wasn't until I saw Remember Me that I thought that he had any potential. And Kristen, who at least limited her scoffing to only two or three times, did not shed a single tear in any of the key scenes. Thankfully, her acting was balanced out by Taylor Lautner's, who actually gave a great portrayal of Jacob.

The minute I sat down to watch Eclipse, I had high hopes that David Slade would finally give the Twilight series what it needed - some quality - and walking out at the end of the film, I was anything but disappointed. The flow of the movie was very smooth, and I was actually surprised at how fast it was coming to an end. The special effects and fighting scenes were precisely shot, and the snow-capped mountainside was breathtaking. I am not a Twi-hard, teenager, housewife or part of whatever other stereotype is used to describe people who like this series, but I absolutely loved this movie from beginning to end. In fact, for the first time, I felt like I was watching a re-make of the series with new actors and overall better cinematography.

My biggest surprise was the acting. For the first time, Rob actually nailed Edward's personality and depicted him as he was meant to be--sensitive, caring, loving, witty, protective, etc. Every scene he did, whether angry or laid back, was spot-on and believable, all creepiness and awkwardness aside. FINALLY! And Kristen, though still not at her best, actually smiled and laughed and was fun as opposed to depressed and introverted. This improvement from both of them made all the intimate scenes feel more natural and the romance more believable. All the actors, in fact, especially Jackson Rathborne and Nikki Reed, really stepped up to the plate and played their characters well.

Although no movie will ever give a faithful adaptation of any book, Eclipse got pretty close. And though there were certain liberties taken with the plot, which I remembered well, they did not detract from the key ideas. Overall, the movie hit on all the aspects of Bella's feelings/decisions about love, family, marriage and human life through different interactions with all the characters. Even if I hadn't read the book, I felt like as a viewer, I had enough information to understand her struggle and ultimate choice.

I know that there is always a negative for every positive, so there are plenty of haters of this film. But despite the complaints about the substance/content of the story (which should be attributed to the novelist, not the director), I feel it's unfair to deny that this is more mature, professionally made film that actually breathed some life into what could have otherwise been a cheesy, teen flick.",1278460800,323,4804,4.768028846153846
3815624,4,B001UV4XFQ,"Like many viewers, I'd read the book Eclipse before seeing the movie. I also read 'the short second life of bree tanner' (see my review on).
 What Was Different From the Book; Some events were rushed or out of order. Bella's graduation was pretty short. The scene where Jacob 'kidnaps' her from school wasn't as dramatic as in the book (darn!). There were some short scenes from 'Bree Tanner' but certainly not the whole novella (no Diego or Freaky Fred).There were also a few additional scenes that showed Riley becoming a vampire and how Victoria manipulates him. What bothered me most was that we don't see how much the scent of Bella's blood tortures Bree - an important scene in the book.
 What Was the Same; The akward 'sex talk' Charlie tries to have with Bella when he thinks she and Edward are 'doing it.' Brilliantly done, the entire theater was laughing hysterically and clapping. Aside from many scenes being out of order, the book was followed very well. Nothing was changed drastically, only a few scenes were added to illustrate what was going on. Victoria is now played by Bryce Dallas Howard; the wide-eyes and childish voice she uses may seem out of character for a vampire,but if you've read the book you'll be haunted by how perfectly the role is played.
 More Info; I really liked this movie. It had a lot of laughs without being phony, exciting, and the acting has gotten much better.
 For Parents; There are sexual references and an almost sex scene. The violence isn't bad, the dead vampires look like broken procelin, no guts. The goriest thing we see is a fire with blackened shapes in it (the dead vampires burning)
 Without futhur ado...GO SEE THE MOVIE!!! I will write about the DVD format when I purchase it. BTW, since this is a happy (but expensive) time of year etc, I may wait a few months before buying/renting the DVD. Sorry if this causes inconvienience. If I hear anything along the lines of great special features or malfunctioning DVDs I'll let you know!! Sorry I haven't done this yet, I haven't had time to watch it but when I do I WILL update this.",1278460800,11,2091,4.62533692722372
3815625,3,B001UV4XFQ,"I saw this with my friends earlier, and we constantly made jokes throughout the entire film. At least it had a little more action than New Moon did, where Bella just cried the whole time. This time, Bella just can't decide who she wants; Edward or Jacob. She is always asking Edward to make her into a vampire. It still has plenty of lovey dovey moments. Victoria still wants revenge and creates an army of newborn vampires who are reckless and don't play by the rules. She plans to kill Bella. The vampires and the werewolves reluctantly decide to work together and fight Victoria and her army. If you are crazy over Twilight, I'm sure you'll love ECLIPSE!!!",1278374400,,659,4.593220338983051
3815686,3,B001UV4XFQ,"I admit that I'm not the target audience for the Twilight series.  I do, however, review all movies, good or bad, and that (along with the desires of my better half) warranted a trip to the theatre.

So I ventured out amongst the sparkling pink hues, reverberating a perpetual gum-smacking staccato, and felt every bit as claustrophobic as Black Friday.  After purchasing tickets I peered out the theatre and couldn't help but notice the glazed-over stares of the tween throngs moving sloth-like towards the door in a pubescent phalanx and ponder the similarity to a Romero film.  Swann of the Dead?

The Twilight series left off with Bella Swann (Kristen Stewart) stuck in a strained love triangle between mortal enemies:  vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and werewolf Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner).  If there are pangs of anguish or throes of passion, they're masked by what I can only assume is a bout of Botox left on the cutting room floor of New Moon, because Bella shows nearly no emotion whatsoever.  At certain points of the film the battle for Ella's heart really started to resemble scenes from Weekend at Bernie's.  Nonetheless, Team Edward and Team Jacob must put aside their differences to collectively protect Bella from a growing coven of sadistic newborn vampires - an army spawned by bloodthirsty vampire Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard) to avenge the loss of her lover - conspicuously ravaging the Seattle landscape.

Meanwhile, Bella's vicissitudes about love and immortality grow tiresome, revealing major acting flaws and bad script writing.  The dialogue between pale-faced lovers - not for racial or vampire reasons, but because she's lifeless - may as well have been a vampire transformation conversation of ""Uh-huh,"" followed by ""Nu-uh.""  When Rosalie mentions that being ""frozen means never moving forward,"" it immediately clears up why Bella, who appears to have Bell's palsy (Bella's palsy?), is so readily accepted into the cold, undead clan.  As for the beleaguered choice between lovers, Edward, the pedophile stalker, and tritagonist Jacob, who leers at Bella like a rapist while making necrophilia-related comments about ""loving Bella after she's dead,"" is a situation that only gets muddier with each film.

The film's primary positive is that the script finally surfaces above the 20+ minutes of staring contests in the previous two Twilight movies.  In fact, learning that the rebirth of Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) occurred while he served as a Cavalry officer in the Civil War, and discovering Rosalie's (Nikki Reed) unfortunate transformation went a long way towards the character development and understanding of their roles.  Even better, however, is the Quileute folklore told with great reverence by Billy Black (Gil Birmingham).  I enjoyed that part very much.  Somewhere along the line, however, there is a subplot-anchor about the Volturi, which is evidently an ancient vampire word meaning ""rigid acting superfluous to the script,"" that adds nearly nothing and could have been removed without any coherency issues.  Direction was also notably improved over its prequels.  It should come as no surprise that the tension is better relayed and the minimal action comes in vicious rushes since David Slade directed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-Candy/dp/B000GI3KGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard Candy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/30-Days-of-Night/dp/B00111YM5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">30 Days of Night</a>&nbsp;before tackling the Twilight series.

Twilight addicts will want to fornicate with this sequel as background noise.  Average movies fans, many of whom probably hated the original and thought the second was an improvement, will still find Kristen Stewart's atrocious acting almost intolerable.  I must say, however, that the series is improving.  With any luck there will be less sparkling and fewer staring contests as the series progresses, and more details about the various characters who act as the crutch for Stewart and the weak script.",1278374400,4,4114,5.684640522875817
3815687,3,B001UV4XFQ,"Whenever you go see a ""Twilight"" film, you don't go in expecting to see the grandiloquence of Fellini, the depth of Bergman or the unconventional dialogues of Jim Jarmusch. You know what kind of films these vampire movies are. The first target audience is the teenagers, then the adults who keep the teenagers in them alive. There is of course nothing wrong with that. I find that these films are made with honesty and a true desire to entertain while being respectful to the books.

I find it amazing to witness these talented filmmakers (the next one being Bill Condon) relaying each other in order to bring these stories alive. They each bring their own strengths and visions, thus keeping the whole process fresh. It can't never truly be like the books cause cinema and literature aren't the same art form. They both have their own rules. But I find it fun to see what part of the story will remain and what part will not.  Especially considering the fact that a new book came out portraying one of the new born vampires. We get to see parts of that small book on the screen and that was a pleasant surprise.

In ""Eclipse"", I was glad that the work was done by the director of ""30 Days Of Night"". You know right then that the action will be well handled. As for the more sentimental stuff, he can only put in the script what's already in the book. And even though a majority love the books, we can fairly say that they are also a bit cheesy (but not in a necessarily bad way). Inevitably, the film can only be ""cheesy"" at times. Again, that doesn't make them bad in any way. Just fun, entertaining and wonderfully cheesy. Like a guilty pleasure.

I do find that all the actors and actresses were good (even getting better and better) but I still have a problem with Kristen Stewart. She blinks a little less but she just won't stop fidgeting in an unnatural way. It looks too much like acting. But I was pleasantly surprised by Robert Pattinson and how mature he appears. I still think that Taylor Lautner tries too hard to talk with a deep voice but his charisma wins over. I missed the terrifying calmness of Michael Sheen but I never get tired of Dakota Fanning. She really is chilling. But I miss Rachelle Lefebvre. Bryce Dallas Howard is a gifted and beautiful actress. But Rachelle has an edge that is truly hers. She appears strong. Bryce appeared weak. I do not remember Victoria as a weak person even though she gets more or less easily killed. Bryce doesn't scare me. Rachelle does (I'm not really scared but you know what I mean).

I'm still dumbfounded though to see how much people seem to not like ""New Moon"". Although I enjoyed ""Eclipse"", I feel like the second opus was the best movie so far. Not only in term of the story but also in terms of the directing. I really felt like Chris Weitz cared for his characters. Don't get me wrong, I like David Slade and I liked the ""Eclipse"" movie. But I do feel like this third act was more a case of delivering what was in the book than it was an act of love from the director.

Now, I can't wait to see what Bill Condon will do with ""Breaking Dawn"". How lucky the fans of ""Twilight"" are to have him close the final chapter to this cheesy but truly fun saga.",1278374400,13,3219,4.38358458961474
3815688,5,B001UV4XFQ,"Eclipse is a very good adaptation of Stephanie Meyer's book. There is a good balance between the tension between the characters (particularly the triangle - Bella, Edward and Jacob) and action.  I read an interview with Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner where they talk about the differences between New Moon and Eclipse.  The overall feeling of both actors was of Eclipse presenting more emotional of the development of the characters.  The rivalry between Edward and Jacob is palpable and Kristen Stewart plays off the emotions very well.  Clearly, she is committed to Edward but she has to deal with her feelings for Jacob. Overall, the comfort level of the actors in their roles is better.  Taylor Lautner, in particular, filled out Jacob's character very well. One could feel Jacob's frustration.

I liked the presentation of the sub-plot stories of Rosalie (Nikki Reed) and Jasper (Jackson Rathbone).  Rosalie's brooding over Bella's choice to become a vampire is explained in a well-acted scene and Jasper's character develops showing his strength of character.  I would have liked a bit more of Rosalie's story on her transformation into a vampire but I also understand the need to keep the film within a reasonable timeframe.  The battle scene between the newborn vampire army and the Cullens and werewolves was nicely orchestrated with just enough emphasis of the individual fight scenes. The concluding scene between Edward and Bella about their marriage and her transformation gets us ready for the final installment.  How will Bella deal with her parents after she becomes a vampire? Overall, a well-acted and beautifully paced film.",1278374400,14,1648,5.208333333333333

Jacob was awesome, you can truly see his devotion to Bella and how much he would give up for her. I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THE DVD COMES OUT!!!!!!!",1278374400,,425,4.2592592592592595

3815691,5,B001UV4XFQ,"I saw ""Eclipse"" on Saturday afternoon.  It's simply brilliant!  I absolutely LOVED it!  ""Eclipse"" had everything.  Action, humour and, of course, wonderful romance!  The scriptwriter did a brilliant job of translating the book to the screen.

Bryce Dallas Howard did a great job as Victoria.  Who would have thought that nice Richie Cunningham (i.e. Ron Howard) from ""Happy Days"" would sire such a stunningly beautiful daughter!  And yes, I do know that I'm showing my age............

I loved the `Magic Triangle' scenes between Bella, Edward and Jacob.  The chemistry between Kristen, Robert and Taylor is fantastic!  Up until ""Eclipse"", I have always thought that Taylor Lautner was the best actor out of the three of them.  However after watching this movie, I've changed my mind.  Don't get me wrong.  Taylor is a fine young actor.  He's smart, talented and will clearly go a long way in this industry.

However, I have to disagree with Robert Pattinson when he said that the yellow contact lenses interfered with his acting and didn't allow him to show the kind of emotion through his eyes that he wanted to portray.  I think that he showed plenty of emotion through his eyes.  I honestly think that Robert is going to be a very good actor and one to watch in the future.

I hope that everyone enjoys watching ""Eclipse"" as much as I did.  I CAN""T WAIT until the DVD comes out so that I can watch it over and over again!",1278288000,11,1425,4.6923076923076925

I cant say that I wasn't sucked into the books when I read them, despite the repetitive back and forth inner monologue of a giddy teenager. But, this is quite possibly as good as the book and by far the best movie of the saga (thus far!). It would totally be worth the money...esp if you wait a bit and buy it used!

3815693,5,B001UV4XFQ,"After the breakup and so much time apart in New Moon, it is endearing to see Edward back at Bella's side where he belongs.  Bella seems much more relaxed this time, Charlie does a great job playing the dad who doesn't quite like his daughter's choice of a boyfriend, and there is a nice scene from Florida with Bella and her mom.

 The entire Cullen clan get more screen time, and although I love each and every one of them, I have to say Rosalie was especially striking this time, and Jasper was absolutely perfect in his role, with his slight southern accent, and exceptional fighting abilities.  They also take us back in time detailing how these two became vampires.

 If Jacob is the one you love then you will feel a little sorry for him, as he is having a tough time both mentally and physically, but the rest of the wolf pack are in good shape and ready for the big fight. They also include a really interesting scene of the Quileute history.

 Most everything from the book that should have been included, has been, including the very important tent scene, which is my personal favorite ( I just love the conversation between Edward and Jacob.)  Then finally we get to the action with the Cullen's and Quileutes coming together to take care of Victoria and those nasty newborn's.

 I can't think of a thing I didn't like in this film, and I will definitely be buying the DVD when it is available.",1278201600,96,1405,4.470588235294118
3815694,5,B001UV4XFQ,"""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" is great!

In the midst of it all, she is forced to choose between her love for Edward and her friendship with Jacob -- knowing that her decision has the potential to ignite the ageless struggle between vampire and werewolf.

While Jacob (Taylor Lautner) and his wolf pack are in on helping the Cullen's protect Bella. Jacob however is tired of seeing Bella with Edward or the idea of her being turned and decides to tell her how he feels.

  I was one of those people that defended Twilight: New Moon, more Bella and Jacob and less Bella and Edward was entertaining. But Twilight: Eclipse is surprisingly a lot better, despite a whole lot of Edward ""who I can't really stand"". There's more intrigue, more excitement and finally some vampire history and some back-stories on Rosalie (Nikki Reed) and Jasper (Jackson Rathbone). Just don't expect a back-story on Alice, since her back-story was covered in the first book, but skipped in the first movie.

3815788,5,B001UV4XFQ,"The third installment of the vampire movie series, Twilight Saga:  Eclipse returns where the New Moon left off.  Tensions have now mounted between the three main characters Bella (Kristen Stewart), Edward (Robert Pattinson), and Jacob (Taylor Lautner).  As viewers will see the differing relationships have escalated to enormous heights in the form of the love triangle that trickles within the other subplots and characters of the film, the rise of the gang-like vampires the ""new borns,"" and the continuing problem that arose during the second film that involved the Volturi, the royal element to the vampire hierarchy who are easily identifiable with their cloaks, blood-red eyes, and somewhat sinister presence.

But for the most part, the majority of the scenes in Eclipse involve the unique quality of vampire romance and the entanglement that Bella has gotten herself into between Edward and Jacob.  There is no denying that the competitiveness exists with the characters that come in the form of a combination of tongue in cheek and snide remarks from Edward and Jacob, but throughout the ordeal, Edward has the advantage because he has the power to read Bella and Jacob's mind as well as play mind tricks on anyone he encounters.  But as with the first and second films, Edward represents chivalry and virtuous traits of a by gone era, and emphatically tells Bella, ""when things were less complicated.""  And the other interesting aspects of the film that attempts to introduce two other members of the film associated with the Cullen clan and their ties to their vampire origins that also involved romantic issues, Jasper Hale (Jackson Rathbone), a Texas Cavalry officer during the Civil War who fell for the beautiful Vampiress (Monique Ganderton) and Rosalie Hale (Nikki Reed) who after a bad romance, has become an overprotective and vengeful vampire when anyone crosses her path.  These themes and issues are essential and show what may be in store for Bella if and when she enters the vampire realm.

In spite of the hype and the mania that has accompanied the film, Eclipse is entertaining and enlightening.  The characters may or may not grow on viewers, but with all of the action packed scenes and the beautiful landscapes, there is bound to be a part of the film that will entice viewers.",1278028800,2,2307,5.015706806282722

3815790,3,B001UV4XFQ,"First of all, I do not think that ""Twilight"" is the worst thing to happen to American literature or cinema in the 21st century or whatever.  The fact that within 12 hours of opening its rating on the International Movie Data Base was 3-point-something surely does not express the judgment of the fanatics (and they boys they date) who paid $30 million to catch the special midnight showings this (early) morning.  I agree you do not need to see something to decide that it is bad, but I think you do need to see it to assign a valid number on a ten point rating scale.  I also think it is fairly obvious that if you have not seen the first two movies and/or read the first two books in Stephenie Meyer's series, then you are never going to be able to figure out what is happening in this one, but then the same thing applies for starting with ""The Return of the Jedi"" or ""The Return of the King.""  Come to think of it, I have to believe that virtually everybody reading these words has already decided whether or not they are going to see ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse.""

When last we left our heroine, Bella Swan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kristen-Stewart/dp/B002BFBAWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kristen Stewart</a>), she and her vampire boyfriend Edward Cullen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robert-Pattinson/dp/B002ZG98RS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robert Pattinson</a>) had been given an ultimatum by the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Volturi/dp/B001PA7P0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Volturi</a>, that because Bella knows so much about vampires she has to become one or die.  This fits into Bella's plans because she wants to become a vampire and be with Edward forever.  Bella's best friend, Jacob Black (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taylor-Lautner/dp/B002ZG99UE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taylor Lautner</a>, who happens to be a werewolf, thinks he loves Bella as much as she loves Edward and does not want her to become a vampire because it is the sacred duty of all werewolves to kill vampires and then he would have to kill Bella.  Meanwhile, another vampire, Victoria (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bryce-Dallas-Howard/dp/B00064LJVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bryce Dallas Howard</a>, is out to kill Bella and thereby payback Edward for what happened at the end of the first movie.  So basically Bella wants to become a vampire and the two men in her life disagree with her decision, albeit for different reasons.

The key to Bella Swan has two foundations; the first, that she loves Edward Cullen with all her heart and all her mind and all her soul, and the second, that she can love Jacob Black as a friend while loving Edward as a lover, or would be lover.  These two truths are something that I suspect most teenage girls can relate to.  That being said, I find Team Jacob people fascinating, because they are our contemporary children of the lost cause.  I keep thinking it is like reading an American History textbook, being very interested in the Civil War, and deciding to root for the Confederacy.  The conflict in this story comes from the inability of Jacob to understand these two rules, which means he becomes more and more of a jerk as the film goes along.  Because Edward and Jacob cannot have a fight to the finish, these conflicts play out mostly in conversation, and that is the biggest problem with this movie.  The vast majority of it consists of conversations, primarily between Bella, Edward and Jacob.  Basically all of the Bella and Edward conversations are a variation on her saying ""change me,"" him refusing and countering with ""marry me,"" her refusing and repeating as necessary.  The Bella and Jacob conversations are all variation on her saying ""I love you, but not that way,"" him insisting she does love him and it could be in that way, sprinkled with threats against Edward.  Edward and Jacob tell each other that Bella always loved them best and then threaten each other until Bella shows up, yells at both of them and goes off with whichever one is most ticked off at that moment to have one of those aforementioned conversational rounds.

The best parts of this movie are the trio of flashbacks that happen during some more of those conversations with Bella.  Both Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) and Rosalie (Nikki Reed) tell their chilling but pertinent tales on how they became vampires, thereby moving beyond the one dimensional characters they had been in the previous films, and then there is the campfire story about the first encounter between the Quileute and the Cold Ones told by Billy Black (Gil Birmingham).  That last one could would have made for a nice prehistoric prequel, and reminded me of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ginger-Snaps-Back-The-Beginning/dp/B0002I84DK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ginger Snaps Back - The Beginning</a>,"" one of my favorite werewolf movies.  I also liked what little we got to hear of the commencement address given by Jessica (Anna Kendrik) and basically anything that Alice (Ashley Greene) does in the film, but then across the board the women in this film come off better than the men.  The big battle in the film's climax has its moments, because for all the violence is uber-quick and more suggested that scene.  The idea of vampires as Cold Ones, in addition to providing the motive for the love triangle in a tent in a snowstorm scene, works to keep the PG-13 rating for this film: basically it is like snapping (or biting) off the limbs (and heads) of marble statues.  So there is neither fountains of blood nor clouds of dust, although when Emmett (Kellan Lutz) shatters a newbie's head with his fist, I have no idea why his fist does not explode too.  However, I have long held that the laws of vampirism are outside the realm of real world empiricism, so I suspend my disbelief and go along for the ride.  So the battel scene has its moments, but it ends with a moment whose outrageousness, if not absurdity, evoked laughter from the audience.

Director David Slade showed he could do vampire action in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/30-Days-of-Night/dp/B00111YM5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">30 Days of Night</a>"" and also proved with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-Candy/dp/B000GI3KGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard Candy</a>"" that he can make a pretty good film where most of the action is mere conversation.  But neither Meyer's original story nor the screenplay by Melissa Rosenberg (who has done all three adaptations) give Slade much to deal with beyond the short spurts of action and all the conversations, which might be part of the reason he is not doing the final two-part installment.  I find it extremely telling that Bella's conversations with her dad, Charlie (Billy Burke), or with any other characters besides Edward and Jacob, work pretty well.  But since most of the movie is those three talking, that becomes a big problem; there was only one moment when Jacob said something that I thought was a decent line.  Bella's opening lines might be the best in the movie, but she's quoting a famous Robert Frost poem that provides an obvious metaphor for her love triangle.  I have no doubt that young people look at this movie differently than I do, because I well being caught up in a romantic rapture when first watching the balcony scene in Franco Zefferelli's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Romeo-Juliet/dp/0792165055/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Romeo & Juliet</a>"" in the theatre and then, twenty years later, laughing at the same scene because it shows two horny kids at the end of their first date.  There is a reason ""Twilight"" has the demographic that it does.  Final Note: It does not help that the last trailer they showed before the movie started was for ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" which is a pointed reminder of the relative shallowness of the Twilight universe (although it should be mentioned that the Harry Potter trailer sandwiches its montage between the two confrontations with Voldemort that will come in Part 2, which is not out until next year).",1277942400,6,8365,5.4324324324324325
3815791,5,B001UV4XFQ,"I absolutely LOVED Eclipse!!! It was definately the best one out of the Saga. The fight scene was great, they didn't go overboard with the special effects, so that was good. This is the first movie out of all 3, that I want to go back and see it again very soon. I hope they keep this director for Breaking Dawn too! He did an awesome job.",1277942400,,339,4.074626865671642
3815792,3,B001UV4XFQ,"I'm not sure a 46 year old man has much business reviewing ECLIPSE or any of the TWILIGHT movies...but I do have a 17 year old daughter who loves the books and films, so I DID shell out my hard-earned cash for the family to see this film on opening day.  Thus I feel entitled to share, knowing that I'm not the target audience...although my wallet is the target!

ECLIPSE is the third in the series of TWILIGHT movies, detailing the tortuous teen romance between Bella Swann (Kirsten Stewart), a brooding, vaguely depressed high schooler, and the vampire Edward and the werewolf Jacob.  Bella's true love is Edward (Robert Pattinson), but she also desires that he turn her into a vampire so they can be together forever.  Jacob (Taylor Lautner), hot-blooded and hunky, offers her a more ""normal"" life.  Both love Bella equally, but at least at this point in the story, it's pretty clear Bella favors Edward.

This fraught romance is set in the midst of fairly uninteresting political and personal machinations revolving around vampire hierarchy and long-standing resentments between the werewolves and the vampires.  In ECLIPSE, a growing army of newly-created vampires is rising up in nearby Seattle, apparently building numbers in order to come after Bella, and Edward's family.  The werewolves get involved, as they rather put up with the ""vegetarian"" (only drink animal blood) Cullenses than this new group of sadistic killers.  There's some question of how involved the vampire leadership is in all this, but frankly, who cares?  These stories don't provide a balance between the romance and the action...they tilt heavily and unapologetically towards the romance.  The action is secondary.

As with the other two films, the writing is the screen play equivalent of ""purple prose"" in many respects...lots of whispered declarations of undying love, heartache and promises that can't be met.  Lots of gazing into eyes.  Lots of hugging and PG-13 rated making-out.  Lots of Taylor Lautner without his shirt.  Lots of Bella wearing plaid shirts and hoodies...while all her classmates wear far more time-appropriate clothing.

The movie is mildly interesting, but mostly it is annoying.  The bad script is not helped by the rather terrible acting.  Stewart, who has been good in other things, cannot make Bella a likeable character.  She is one of the most annoying teenagers ever put on screen...perfectly self-centered.  No one has ever felt love as acutely as she does.  No one has ever felt torn as she has.  She is the perfect encapsulation of all the worst qualities of teenage girls in love...and the film stubbornly refuses to make an effort to also find the joyful parts aspects of a teenage girl in love.  Pattinson simply continues to fail to be credible, and he is not helped but the worst haircut on film since Tom Hanks did THE DA VINCI CODE...it makes Pattinson's head look 40% too big!  He and Stewart really don't generate any real chemistry.  Yes, the clasp each other a lot and gaze at each other...but for two actors who are supposedly in love in real life, their passion is pretty inert.  Lautner is also not a good actor, but at least he has a lightness about him, a clear realization that he's become a mega-star by dumb luck (and many trips to Gold's Gym), and at least he can bring a sense of playfulness to his lighter scenes.  But as with Pattinson, when the script asks him to be pained and tormented, he mostly looks like he has a stomach ache.

The best parts of these movies, to me, have always been the Cullen family.  Without diving into detail, they are an amusing and motley crew, with silly but somehow touching family dynamics.  They are a good group of vampires...tormented creatures who have helped each other retain all the humanity possible to vampires.  ECLIPSE gives us some background stories on this crew, and I really responded to this group more than ever.  Jackson Rathbone as Jasper continues to give the best, most amusing and original performance in the series, and I was so happy to see he was featured more in ECLIPSE.  I would happily see a film centered around HIS character.

Also, the special effects continue to be sub-par.  These films are global phenomenons...yet the poorly rendered werewolves make the whole effort feel like the producers were trying to save every penny they could.  Surely someone could actually make werewolves that felt like they existed in the same space as the humans & vampires!

If love these movies already, there's no reason you won't love ECLIPSE.  If you find them a pain to watch, then I would guess your reaction would roughly mirror mine.  But I know there's nothing I can say to change the mind of a fan (or foe) of THE TWILIGHT SAGA...but it's my opinion, and I'm stickin' to it!",1277942400,13,4774,4.838471023427867
3815793,5,B001UV4XFQ,I love everything Twilight but this movie exceeded my expectations. The fight scenes are great. More Vampires and Werewolves! The scene in the woods after the snowstorm is beautiful and almost exactly looked the way I pictured it in my mind when I read the book. I am so looking forward to seeing Breaking Dawn!!!!!,1277942400,2,315,4.745454545454545

If you didn't and you went into the theatre today or last night, you learned some interesting facts about Edwards sister and brother.
I the the movie was well worth the anticipation!  Twilight was kinda low~grade filming, New Moon redeemed the series and Eclipse and Breaking Dawn will definitely take it over the top!!
THAT GOD FOR PEOPLE LIKE STEPHANIE MEYER who have the gift of a good computer and pen!!",1277856000,2,566,4.423076923076923
3815859,1,B001UV4XFQ,"I am a HUGE fan of Twilight, but for some reason this movie fell short for me. I absolutely adore the first two-I felt the directors really got the feel of the books. I CANNOT understand how anyone could prefer this movie to the others-unless they are not coming from a book perspective.

This one...not so much.

First, the soundtrack was awful. New Moon had a beautiful and moody score and some songs that I wanted to listen to after the movie. The songs in this one were distracting and there was nothing pretty or atmospheric about the score (which really surprised me; I love Howard Shore's Lord of the Rings score).

Second, this director had Jacob as an angry character, and didn't show any other side to him. Bella was to wishy washy not really nice to either Jacob or Edward, and  Edward looked like he was begging after an uninterested person the whole time, though Edward had some great moments (particularly the tent scene, and his fight with Riley and Victoria).

Third, certain characters changed to much. I didn't like the recasting of Victoria, they shouldn't be changing actors 3 movies in. Jasper suddenly developed some strange accent 3 movies in as well.

Lastly and worst of all, the tacked on ending was horrific. Bella explaining to the theaters with a phony speech about fitting in with the Vampires world and it was never a choice between Edward and Jacob. Huh? Did this director even see New Moon? It just seemed like a way for the filmmakers to try and make Bella look like a strong female character, which she isn't (and that's ok).

There were some good things, like I mentioned the fight with Edward/Victoria/Riley/Seth. The cgi wolves were really cute and expressive. I also thought Riley was excellent, great casting and acting there. Maybe fans seeing this without having been a fan of the book series will feel differently, or maybe it's just person taste. I wanted to love it, but just didn't.",1277856000,17,1928,4.70326409495549
3815860,5,B001UV4XFQ,"When I saw New Moon I thought it was so great and way better than Twilight. Well, Eclipse is wayyy better than New Moon. As always, they stick VERY close to the books (I re-read to make sure) and the big fight was great. I love action/horror movie so I was so excited to see the fight scene was not toned down. I know fans will love it and this movie may be the one to bring in new fans for the last two. Great movie, can't wait to see it a bunch more!",1277856000,,452,3.8191489361702127
3815861,4,B001UV4XFQ,"In ""Eclipse"", part three of the Twilight Saga (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B001P5HRMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Twilight-Saga-New-Moon-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B001OQCV56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Twilight Saga: New Moon (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>), director David Slade zeroes in on the ""should she or shouldn't she?"" question that has proved to be the pulsing lifeblood behind the popular teen quartet of novels by author Stephanie Meyer. However, as millions of fans already know--she does--and sadly, that takes a big bite out of the whole Team Edward versus Team Jacob rivalry, rendering the whole premise rather toothless.

In the last two films, none of that mattered, so why should it matter in this the third and in my opinion the most likable of the trilogy so far?  Fans desire only to see their beloved characters brought to life on the screen.  ""Eclipse"" does just that.  Any criticisms regarding the senselessness of the storyline or the futile confusion of a girl that has already made her decision two books ago should be taken up with Meyer, not the director or screenwriter of any of the films.

The creation of an entertaining and faithful adaptation that enables teenage girls to swoon, scream and choose sides at the sight of the film's two hunky albeit warring leads, become better acquainted with the good vampire clan of ""vegetarian"" bloodsuckers, understand some of the characters' personal histories, delve into the native Indian lore of the Quileute tribe while presenting the typical boy-girl-boy triangle with a supernatural twist, requires some storytelling skills especially in a two-hour time frame that includes the additional nemesis of a marauding newbie vampire army as the ultimate plot driver.  Slade handles all this well, managing his youthful cast with a tastefully chaste sympathy that adds a little heat, but not enough to get accompanying parents enraged by what could have been another of the usual messages of no-holes-barred excess that Hollywood delivers without a thought to delicate and burgeoning psyches.

True to Meyer's pro-abstinence sensibilities, Slade plays off the `fire and ice' motif (presented as a metaphor by Bella's introductory recital of Robert Frost's poem of the same name for the opposing natures of her two leading young men) juxtaposing Bella (wholesomely perfect Kristen Stewart) between the forever absolutes of male over-protectiveness--the icy courteous albeit bloodsucking Edward (the weed-whacker haired Rob Pattinson) and the fiery angry self-possessed Jacob (the deliciously shirtless Taylor Lautner).  The audience can feel Bella's development from an uncomfortably undefined young woman to someone with the potential capability to face her own wakening desires without self-delusion or compromise.  In this sense, ""Eclipse"" depicts teenage decisions with an age appropriate amount of confusion and wonder that seems generally gauged for this tale of Bella and the Beasts.

In addition to just the right amount of sensitivity with regard to the normally arising questions about just how far an actual teenage relationship should go, ""Eclipse"" tackles the larger question of choosing one's own destiny--does Bella want a human life with Jacob or supernatural eternity with Edward?  Does her natural awkwardness transcend into a sense that the mainstream obviously just isn't in the cards for her? Bella is given the opportunity to explore this breaking aspect of self awareness in different scenes with different players:  father, mother, fellow graduates, the wolf clan that wants her to stay human and the vampire fusion that understands her desire to fuse.  Whether or not any of this actually works or not isn't the fault of Slade or screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg.  Again, any problems with the sometimes dimensionless dialogue between the players--especially the lines meant to convey jealousy and competition between wolf and undead--can be blamed on the circuitous adolescent whining conveyed in the original text by Stephanie Meyer.

The paradox for Slade or any other director chosen to do the next book in the series then becomes, ""Should he?"" or ""Shouldn't he?"" with regard to plumping up the thin material with some background flashback that will make the characters and their current level of desire for life, for love, for family and friends more understandable.  He ""should"" but does he want to be attacked by legions of fundamentalist fans for interjecting impurity to their beloved books?

Kristen Stewart and Rob Pattinson work the material to the best of their abilities this time; their respective characters flow together with slightly more familiarity.  However the melancholy tone still prevails--with all that danger aloft, how could it not?  The basic chemical bonding between the two still seems to need a formula adjustment. Imagine Bella kissing and wanting to get close to a guy whose temperature stays in a steady arctic zone fit for a damp seal or frosty polar bear.  That might work in the tropics, but in the wet Northwest? In the same respect, I don't understand why a 21st century girl with Bella's experience or sensibilities would want someone tracking her as if she were Big Foot each and every time she decided to go for a ride in her truck. Meyer presents Edward as a prim and proper Edwardian, but no background story on his pre-vampire life shows us his soul.  We are told that Bella and Edward love each other with a Romeo and Juliet whimsy--do we feel it?  Where's the dramatic lover's theme music to pull at the senses whenever their two faces fill the screen?  Non-existent--its the old ""I'm being told"" not ""shown"" no-no.

In that sense, don't see ""Eclipse"" unless you are well versed by either the novels (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Twilight-Saga-Collection/dp/B001FA0PIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Twilight Saga Collection</a>) or the first two film installments.  Slade doesn't bother to recap either of the two initial pinings for the vampire or the werewolf/girl-woman relationships.  Instead he and the rest of the Twilight Saga franchise assume that the audience, a motley crew of pre-teenage/teenage girls and their twi-mothers have sat through the pre-midnight showings of Twilight and New Moon for the umpteenth time and now revved and ready for this latest adventure have taken sides as illustrated by the wearing of Team Edward or Team Jacob t-shirts.  As a stand-alone, ""Eclipse"" would have a hard time explaining the motives for the action portion of the film--just why is the red-headed vamp(ire) Victoria seeking out Bella to feed her revenge?  A little review would have served those not in the know well.

On the other hand Team Slade excels in fleshing out the vampire awakenings of the lovely but malignant Rosalie (Nikki Reed) and the Alice-smitten Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) in a far better way then Meyer does in her book--Meyer never covers that extra ground for Carlisle (Peter Facinelli), Esme (Elizabeth Reaser), Alice (Ashley Greene), Emmett (Kellan Lutz) or for that matter, even Edward himself.  Instead we are treated to glossy two-dimensional portraits of supernatural creatures we can only hope to understand via their similarity to vacuous supermodels--not based on their inner, very human, cravings.

The teen scheme cover-ups, so much a part of the novels (Bella constantly lies to both of her parents), thankfully is absent here.  A child of divorce, Bella contends with negative feelings regarding marriage but is reassured that commitment does bite and can grow legs by the family of vampires and their forever mates and the wolves and their ability to imprint.  So many lessons to be learned--and all within two hours or four huge books, depending on which medium best suits!

Technically, the computer-generated wolf colossuses look and seem real enough to want to snuggle against. Who wouldn't want one of those impressive mega-pets watching the old homestead?  Parents need not be disturbed by any notion of excess gore; the action sequences of fast-moving cart-wheeling vampire martial arts works without any shredding of flesh with the usual blood fest associated with a battle involving just one hemoglobin slurper.

Bottom line?  ""Eclipse,"" the latest installment of the Twilight Saga delivers what its fans have come to expect--a faithful adaptation of the teen angst-driven triangle tale of Edward, Bella and Jacob.  Even though, the audience knows from the start that the contest really has no substance, the Team Jacob camp remains strong, vigilantly wolf-snarling at Bella's decision to explore the subzero rather than warm her hands via wolf pelt.  One hopes that dawn will never break, sadly we already know ahead of time that it does.  Director Slade treats us to vampire birth flashbacks and teenage ponderings of the big questions regarding love, lust and eternity without being offensive or caving into the typical teen marketed extravaganzas promoting growing up too fast amidst the excess.  Some dialogue weakness does not help the characters become more than 2.5 dimensional.  However, the action sequences and CG images of both the glittering globin gulpers and their hirsute nemesises facilitate the fantasy in this fairytale adventure.  This monster mash of newbie vampires, protective wolves, angling Volturi and the triangle of the Sleeping Beauty prototype meeting and greeting head on her greatest male fears is recommended for the fan and rated accordingly.

3815862,3,B001UV4XFQ,"""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" abruptly ended with Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) telling his girlfriend, Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) that he will turn her into a vampire on the condition that they get married first. And so ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse,"" the third film in a series serving as an extended metaphor for abstinence, begins with the two lovingly lying in a field of flowers, and you can sense the anticipation they both feel, especially Bella, who radiates with virginal longing. As bothersome as I found this twice before, this time around I found it oddly amusing, maybe because, after their painfully statuesque performances in ""New Moon,"" Stewart and Pattinson are once again allowed to emote. Stewart especially, who takes on a whole different energy when she's given the opportunity to crack a smile.

Alas, it's quickly hampered by a scene in which the metaphor turns literal; Bella wants to have sex with Edward while she's still human, but his chivalrous standards kick into high gear and he refuses her advances. He then lectures her on how, back in his day, he would have courted her, taken chaperoned walks with her, asked her father's permission for her hand in marriage, and so on and so forth. He then tells her that, while his soul is done for, hers is still worth preserving. What I find intriguing is that Stephenie Meyer wove such blatant themes into a fantasy, a genre created specifically as a way to escape reality. Even if sex before marriage is forbidden by Mormon doctrine, what's to stop her from writing about it? If I were her, I would have had Bella and Edward go at it like dogs in heat, all the while remembering that my personal values haven't been affected.

Complicating Bella's situation is the hot-blooded, mostly shirtless werewolf Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), who professes his love for her as well as his hatred of Edward, the Cullen Clan, and vampires in general. Does Bella feel the same way about Jacob? She's not entirely sure. All she knows is that she needs both him and Edward to protect her, which means they will have to find some way to get along. It seems that, up in nearby Seattle, the evil vampire Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard) has been busy recruiting an army of young vampires, or newbies, for purposes of attacking the Cullen Clan and getting revenge against Bella; aware of this, the Cullens join forces with their blood enemies, the werewolves, in the hopes of putting a stop to the newbies, who are apparently much more lethal than their older counterparts.

Despite the preachy subtexts, ""Eclipse"" is an improvement - albeit a tepid one - from the previous two ""Twilight"" films. I appreciated the greater emotional range displayed by Stewart and Pattinson, I liked looking at the none-too-convincing visual effects, and I found the action sequences more exciting, sparse though they may be. All the same, it still suffers from excessive length and unreasonable pacing, and just like before, they're linked to tedious conversations between the leads. I was especially fed up with Edward's repeated attempts to talk Bella out of becoming a vampire, and likewise, with her insistence on going through with it. The more I hear the Cullens describe the required sacrifices, the less I'm inclined to side with Bella; aging and death are frightening, but soulless immortality is unthinkable.

Lautner is still a chiseled hunk for the girls to swoon over, which may adequately distract them from the fact that he spends virtually all of his performance angrily clenching his jaw. When Jacob isn't romantically sulking, then he's furiously confronting Edward. Nowhere is this more apparent than in a tent high atop a snowy mountain, in which Bella, her teeth chattering from the cold, lets Jacob embrace her for his body heat: ""Let's face it,"" he tells Edward, ""I am hotter than you."" As Bella sleeps, Jacob and Edward glower at each other, and they quietly but firmly discuss the fact that Bella still has to make a choice, and that, if she had been given enough time, she already could have made it. So I guess the question is simple, especially if you've been eating at Burger King: Is Bella on Team Jacob or Team Edward?

""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" will almost certainly please the fans, just as they were pleased twice before. Non fans will have a rougher time of it, although I suspect it will be easier to win them over with this film than it was with the first two. As for myself, I recognize its progress as the third chapter of a series, but it's still too slow, too overwrought, and too didactic for me to recommend it. You've got to hand it to Stephenie Meyer - she really knows how to sermonize. I might have gotten something out of it had the topic been less divisive, however. Aren't there moral themes that we all more or less agree upon, such as treating everyone with respect or being charitable or something along those lines? If I'm going to be preached at, and if it has to be in the form of a vampire romance, at least make sure that the message is making good sense.",1277856000,7,5058,4.762827822120866

I highly recommend this movie to anyone wishing to be taken away to a realist fantasy world for a couple of hours of total excitement. I still do not understand why so many reviews seem to compare the sagas to each other? Each of the movies was unique and superbly created and great in its own right. Each told a different part of Bella's story each one grows in complexity just as Bella's life continues to grow through each succeeding sequel.

3815865,5,B001UV4XFQ,"I have to say I normally don't review movies. I usually try to stick with books (haha hence my name) I also tend not to see movies that were based on books, they are never right ie: Eragon, Blood and Chocolate and yes even the Harry Potters movies were missing tons of sides stories that were in the books.  I saw Twilight the day it came out and was both relieved that it was so close to the book, and frustrated because like the book it lacked action. Only the last five minutes had any fighting.  The same was true in New Moon, while it followed the book closely it was only the last 10 minutes where Edward fought with the Volturi that were action packed.  I have to say I really liked Eclipse.  I found that with all of Stepenie Meyer's books (especially Breaking Dawn) there was a huge build up towards the battle scenes, then it just fell apart.  Yes it's for a younger age group, but sometimes a  little more fighting and action is good.  Eclipse delivered good action through out the movie, especially the 'big battle' I found myself wishing that the screen writers would have put this much effort into the first two with the action.  David Slade, the director, also did Hard Candy (amazing movie) and 30 Days of Night.  I think it was brilliant to bring him in on the project and hope he stays for Breaking Dawn.

I also am glad to say that Kristen Stewert has better facial expressions in this movie.  She doesn't look like her face is frozen in only two expressions.  Edward also delivers more side comments with good comedic timing.  Jacob is hurt in this movie, but the interaction between all three is much less forced and more natural than the first two movies.  It is without a doubt the best of the bunch.  I won't bog down this review with the plot, because obviously 99% of the people going to Eclipse have read the book at least twice.  I can say though that unlike the other two movies, I actually found myself wondering what happens next, and looking forward to how Bella and Edward (and yes Jacob) would react.  I'd say if you've been on the fence about the other two movies go see this one, if you hated the first two movies, this one is infinitely better and if you loved the first two movies, I can only say you will love this one even more.",1277856000,383,2268,4.34916864608076
