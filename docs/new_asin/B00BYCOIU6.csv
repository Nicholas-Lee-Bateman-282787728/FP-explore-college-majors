5682370,4,B00BYCOIU6,a serious and powerful telling of the story of this young priest who tried to do what was right and was killed for standing up to tyranny simply by serving his people.,1381104000,,167,4.25
5682371,5,B00BYCOIU6,"This DVD reminded me of the book ""Monastery Without Wall"" that is to say...........the kingdom of God is within us all we have to do is choose to pick a side (there is no lukewarm with JC)................you CHOOSE TO GO HIS WAY or pick this world's ""glitterly path of deceit"".(I call it satan's playground......the TRUTH IS CHRIST.......I'll take HIS WAY any day!  :)  :)",1379980800,,372,4.796875

5682373,5,B00BYCOIU6,"If you have not experienced or read about Poland's struggle for independence under Soviet and Polish communist rule, this is a great story combining the great Faith in their Church of the Poles, and the Solidarity Movement's beginnings.  It is about Father Jerzy who earns the trust and love of the steelworkers in Danzig (Gdansk) during their strike by saying the Mass in the heart of communism in Poland, the shipyard.  Quiet-spoken, fairly shy, but very brave, he carries the message of Jesus Christ's love in his heart and his message, and teams that love for love of each other, and love for their struggling homeland.  He detests the cruelties and hatred of the socialist regime where just going to the Mass is a reason to be questioned and arrested.  Some great actual footage, especially when Blessed (soon to be Saint) Pope John Paul the Great visited Poland.  Father Jerzy was brutually beaten and murdered by the communist secret police and thrown in a river.  He was declared beatified and his gravesite was one of the first places visited by Blessed Pope John Paul the Great a year later.
Note that this film is in POLISH, but the subtitles are easy to read and it is all well worthwhile seeing this film.  A great film about the strength of the Polish people, their sufferings, and what their Faith meant to them.",1374537600,,1327,4.7186147186147185
5682374,5,B00BYCOIU6,"Yes, an outstanding film. Definitely of award caliber. As a matter of fact, I passed this film along to share with others.",1374019200,,122,4.590909090909091
5682375,5,B00BYCOIU6,"Father Popieluszko is often overlooked in the West in the great struggle to liberate Poland and Eastern Europe. Lech Walesa, John Paul II, Margaret Thatcher, and Ronald Reagan all get due credit. Yet, this film captures the choices of going along with a totalitarian state or being not afraid to see liberty at the street and parish level. It is a must see...including, especially, the ""extras"" put in context a few early scenes that need explanation to fully appreciate. If you love freedom, if you admire great faith and how it serves its fellow citizens, you will not want to overlook this film!",1372636800,5,598,4.815533980582524
5682376,4,B00BYCOIU6,"I'm old enough to remember when this priest's murder was in the news, but this film provided important background, sometimes splicing in real footage from events in Poland during the time leading up to that. The movie is done mostly in what might be called small scenes: a father walking with his son in the forest, a frightened family at home warning the children not to talk to anyone about what they know, a pregnant woman having a nervous breakdown after her husband dares to stand up to government thugs, the priest sharing a jail cell with a handful of other men, people testifying at show trial, that sort of thing. There are sweeping scenes of great crowds, but even then the camera usually pans in on individuals. It's a refreshing break from films that set out to be epic, and wind up losing the humanity of the people involved. The filmmakers handle the depiction of violence with restraint, and otherwise assume the intelligence of the viewer. It's a thoughtful, thought-provoking, sometimes strangely engaging and modest film, about courage and fidelity in the face of oppression. It's in Polish, with English and Spanish subtitles.",1372204800,14,1145,4.907216494845361
5682377,5,B00BYCOIU6,this is a wonderful portrayal of the life of blessed Jerzy Popieluszko.  It really gives a wonderful picture of the trials and struggles of Fr. Popieluszko and yet how he remained faithful to his ideals and calling. It is also a good indication of the situation which the people found themselves in while communism was reigning in Poland.  It also defines the Church's position with regard to the people.  They tried to support the working class in their struggles often surrendering their own lives for the people. It is really very uplifting and indicates that sainthood is available to all who pursue it.,1372204800,8,607,4.87378640776699
5682378,5,B00BYCOIU6,"Eastern European cinema generally tends to be in a class of their own when compared to Hollywood and Western European films. A lot of artistry goes into their productions as well as being 'thinking' movies....making the viewer not just appreciate what's on screen at the present moment, but to make the movie remain with them for a long time after.

To make a biopic of any one always poses a challenge. This is more so if the person is a hero and, in the case of Popieluszko, a beatified martyr. However this movie flows with an incredible fluidity, without adulterating or romanticizing the facts and the events. A beautiful aspect of this film is incorporating footage of actual events that happened in the tumultuous 80's in Poland, along with the Papal visits by Blessed John Paul II with the movie, that there is no `break'. One cannot really discern, in certain parts of the movie, which is archival footage and which is the film. This is a remarkable achievement in cinematic art, as far as I am concerned.

From this film, one can learn much about the character of Bl. Jerzy Popieluszko. A very brave young man, who was an average priest in the opinion of many, but who did extraordinary deeds of heroism for the liberation of his homeland from the tyranny of communism. We also see his very human side of suffering, compassion, fear, anger and even a slight sense of vanity.
Though the facade of this priest speaks the contrary, we are surprised to see the stuff this man is made off.  This movie beautifully expresses the underlying fervent catholicity of a nation, despite the coldness of its exterior, and how freedom and faith is both expressed with such passion, that we can easily affirm that both are inviolably linked to each other.

Also expressed and wonderfully depicted, is the love the Polish people have for their traditions of faith, their love and respect of their language, culture and nation. Certain scenes pertaining to this are quite amusing as well as awe inspiring. Also, the heroism of the many priests of those days; from the Pope, to the Bishops and ordinary priests as well as the religious sisters is amazing. The words of Christ : ""This is the greatest love a man can show, that he should lay down his life for his friends"" (St. John 15:13), brings us to a whole new perspective of what sacrifice really means.
The words used in my review's heading comes from a scene when Bl. Jerzy is asked how come he feels no anger for his persecutors for which he answers ""I fight evil, not the victims of evil"". He saw his tormentors as victims themselves, to be pitied and to be helped. Truly a mark of sainthood!

This movie is 149 minutes long, in Polish with subtitles in English and Spanish.

Special features include:
1)The making of the film (21 mins)
2)A documentary:Victors don't die: The story of Fr. Jerzy Popieluszko (50mins)
I am not too fond of these features because only one voice over(male) was used for both features, for all the different people, both men and women.

Also Included is a 16 page booklet which includes the following chapters:
1. About Poland, Patriotism and Catholicism
2. An Unlikely hero
3. In his own words
4. The rise of solidarity
5. Chronology of events
6. Discussion questions

This is a movie that will make any catholic proud and more so any Polish.

For a documentary on Blessed Jerzy I highly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Messenger-of-the-Truth/dp/B00ITX6MZ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Messenger of the Truth</a>.",1367971200,28,3543,4.901502504173623
5682379,5,B00BYCOIU6,"I was looking forward to see this movie in his original language(Polish) with english subtitles, and finally it was relased.
This movie is about the life of Father Jerzy Popieluszko (now a Blessed in the Roman Catholic Church), who lived in Poland in the  1980's. He preached the truth to the people who attendend his Church in Varsaw. Many people  think that thanks to him the communism in Europe begun to crumble.
In spite of being sickl he fought to the end,using  only pacific resitence. I highly recommend this movie. The movie also has two bonuses: one is about how the movie was made and the other one is about the life of Father Jerzy.",1367193600,17,643,4.573913043478261
5682380,3,B00BYCOIU6,"If you know a bit of recent Polish history, then you'll know what's going on.",1430438400,,77,4.2
5682381,5,B00BYCOIU6,"The true story of Blessed Jerzy Popieluszko (Adas Woronowicz), a Polish priest who acted as spiritual director of workers' unions in the Solidarity movement that challenged the Communist authorities during the 1980s. He was a charismatic young man who always preached in the spirit of forgiveness and non-violence, but he was devoted to the cause of freedom which made him the top target on the list of suspect clergy kept by the Polish Secret Police.

After the beating death of a young student arrested by the state, Fr. Jerzy said a mass at the church of St. Stanislaus Kostka which drew a great crowd, 60,000 people in procession. Subsequent ""Masses for the Nation"" continued to draw larger and larger crowds. While the public liturgies were meant to signify the unity of the Polish people, there was also an air of defiance in them. This was evident in the wording of some of the homilies, the chosen hymns, and the flourishing of religious symbols, which of course infuriated the Communist authorities.

Later the film takes on an air of claustrophobic oppression as the police start to hound the popular priest, and there is a sense of general paranoia because in those days there was simply no way to tell who to trust. But there are images of ecstatic beauty too as in a scene of Fr. Jerzy's visit to the farm where he grew up and as he experiences a home-cooked meal from his mother. One remarkable aspect of the film is that many of the parts are played by people who actually knew Popieluszko. In fact, in the opening scenes he is played as a boy by his own great-nephew. There are intercut scenes too of actual photographs and newsreels from the period. This was the time of Pope John Paul II and his presence is prominent as an inspiration to the resistance movement, as are frequent images of the ""Mother of Poland,"" the Madonna of Czestochova which is housed in the great Polish shrine of Jazna Gora. There is reference also to the fact that America at that time had a strong anti-communist leader in Ronald Reagan; there is an indication that this emboldened many of the protestors.

Of course the events of Popieluszko's death are no secret so I hope it doesn't spoil the film for others if I mention the final scenes portray the horror and tragedy of this event. On a dark night in October of 1984, Fr. Jerzy was riding with a friend when their car was stopped by three Communist agents. The priest was kidnapped and later beaten, bound and thrown into a public reservoir. There was a national display of grief and no doubt this outcry helped bring about the fall of the government soon afterward.

The film is in Polish with English subtitles and it has a gritty documentary style. Avoiding sentimentality, it never overplays its hand and, although Fr. Jerzy is portrayed in the end as a martyr, his enduring strength seems to be in the Christ-like nature of his service to others. There are numerous scenes of his little acts of kindness - at one point he takes off his shoes and gives them to a man whose son has none. He was always generous with his time, often to the point of fatigue, willing to hear confessions, or to counsel or physically aid any who came to him at any time of the night or day. Fr. Jerzy was always obedient to his bishop and the higher clergy who also had to walk a tightrope between their vocation and the hostility of the atheist government.

The grimness is relieved by moments of grace, as are all great films. On one occasion as the beleaguered priest is walking alone on rainy streets, the director cuts to a scene of snow-capped mountains under a cloudy sky through which the sun is breaking. In this moment of transcendence, we hear Fr. Jerzy speaking softly on the soundtrack... ""Father, people's lives are so much alike... gray, tough... sometimes grim. It would be unbearable but for little glimmers of joy. Your presence... signs that you are here with us."" This film is such a sign.

Notes on the DVD:  Picture was a little dark at times but generally excellent.  Original language with subtitles, which I like.  Very good features included on the disk.",1426118400,2,4113,4.631001371742112

I was interested to learn though so after a couple of friends of mine who grew up in Poland explained more of the details that were missing, I understood it better. This rendition is filmed with a lot of dark scenes so it is hard to see what is happening.  I want to get the newer movie when it comes out on DVD - we need to know these events.

5682395,5,B00BYCOIU6,"Father Jerzy Popieluszko was a Roman Catholic priest from Communist Poland who courageously spoke out against the persecution of the Polish people and was outspoken in his support of the Solidarity movement that was sweeping the unions in the 1980s. When the Communists saw their lies were not resonating with the Polish people, it was a Catholic priest they feared most. A Catholic priest who spoke the truth and helped his people to see the lies and distortion that so often are associated with the evil of Communism. In the end, the Communists chose to do what they do best - use force, intimidation and finally murder to silence the voice of the people. On October 19, 1984 Father Popieluszko was kidnapped by three agents of the Polish Communist Internal Intelligence Agency. He was severely beaten, then bound with rope and thrown into a reservoir where his body was recovered 11 days later.  Father Popieluszko has since been recognized as a martyr by the Catholic Church and on June 6, 2010 he was beatified.

I remember quite clearly reading about the brutal murder of this priest in Reader's Digest at the time it took place. I was horrified by the sheer brutality of the beating of this Catholic Priest before they finally hung a rope around his neck that had a weight tied to the other end, and while still alive, they threw him into a waterway where he died. What is most ironic is how just a few short years later, in this same paper mill just feet from where I was seated at the time I read this story, a friend and fellow co-worker was brutally beaten, had a rope tied around his neck that was attached to a weight, and was thrown in a pulp vat to die because he too chose to take a stand against evil.  In this case it was the evil that existed in six union thugs who were eventually sentenced to life in prison for the murder. Evil is evil and wherever there is good there will always be evil. It seems throughout history wherever you have Communism you will find the persecution and murder of Catholic priests and nuns because they are deemed a threat to those who want to disallow free thinking and who only seek to control people with an iron fist.

When I came across the movie on Amazon I decided to order it and learn more about the story behind the man (I also strongly recommend the following movies which also deal with the horrific realities of communism):

 - ""Katyn"" (True story of the cold-blooded execution of almost 22,000 Polish Nationals by the Russians in 1940).

 - ""Guilty of Treason"" (True story of Hungarian Cardinal Jzsef Mindszenty, played by Charles Bickford, who was tortured and given a life sentence in 1949 for his uncompromising opposition to fascism and communism in Hungary).

 - ""Eleni"" (The true story of an award-winning investigative journalist from the NY Times, played by John Malkovich, who returns to his native Greece with the intention to track down and kill the former communist soldier who was responsible for the 1949 torture and murder of his mother (for smuggling her children out of Greece to the United States).

 - ""To Kill A Priest"" (The English-produced version of ""Popieluszko: Freedom is Within Us"" starring Ed Harris and Christopher Lambert of ""The Highlander""). Personally, after seeing both versions I felt watching the movie in its native tongue gives a much more realistic feel to this tragedy).

 - ""Escape From Camp 14"" (True story of a man named Shin Dong-hyuk who, in 1996, escaped from the N.Korean slave labor camp from which he was born into, and sadly from where his actions convicted his mother and brother to death).

These are the kind of movies that should be shown in every American classroom so this generation of young adults can better understand the true meaning of Communism. Very little is reported about the atrocities taking place, to this very day, in countries like the Soviet Union, China, Cuba and North Korea. Communism silences all freedom of expression, freedom of worship, freedom of speech, freedom of travel, etc., etc. I have heard countless stories from those who've escaped Communist countries and the stories are always the same: stories of unspeakable horror, suffering, imprisonment, death and brutality. They are Godless societies which lack human compassion, love, trust, assistance on all levels, food, etc. All the freedoms and luxuries we so readily take for granted here in America, cannot even be imagined by the citizens of these countries. And yet sadly, every year Americans surrender more and more of their freedom to an ever-growing government that is over-reaching the restrictions placed on it by our Constitution. The more control that is surrendered to the government the more restrictions we will find ourselves living under.

In addition to Americans losing more of their freedoms to their government, there are factions of people who have made it their mission to deny the majority of Americans their right to celebrate Christmas and display the greatest symbol of that Christian Holiday - the Nativity Scene. Atheist groups aided by activist judges, continue to militantly remove more of our Nativity Scenes, Crucifixes, Ten Commandments, or any other hint of Christian faith found in small-town America. The United States of America is known across the globe as the land of ""freedom"", yet in recent years our freedoms are being pulled right out from under us as we move closer and closer to those nations that jail anyone found to be a Christian. The very faith that built this country is now being vanquished by Godless zealots who want nothing more than to vanquish all traces of faith in America. While they impose THEIR minority convictions on the majority 78% of Americans who call themselves Christian, little is done to stop them for fear of litigation. These subversives are succeeding in their efforts for one reason - the generations who fought and died to preserve these symbols are dying off more every day, and few are left who truly understand the dangerous road we are heading down. It was former Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev who, in 1960, announced at the United Nations the Soviet Union would conquer the United States without a single shot being fired! One need only observe the trending taking place in America to know this country will one day be conquered from within by the kinds of political radicals we are now seeing in Washington.

All too many Americans today are concerned only with their couch, TV, remote control and their beer. No one seems to care as the ""God"" this country was founded on is besmirched, dipped in urine, blasphemed and desecrated under the guise of ""art"" or ""freedom of expression"". When feces was plastered all over a painting of Mary, the Mother of Jesus, and displayed at a New York Art Museum, the artist was hailed for his ""thought-provoking expressionistic work. Yet had that same artist strewn feces all over a portrait of Allah, or dipped a Koran in urine or offered a flippant hypothesis on ""Allah's"" sexuality as they do Jesus, this same media would commence with an unequaled onslaught of denunciations, character assassinations and unending condemnations of anyone who would engage in such unethical, unacceptable, insensitive, racist behavior. They would indubitably ""suggest"" the severest punishment possible for the offender as well, and this drumbeat would cover the media wall-to-wall for days and weeks. Yet this same media says nothing as our Christian beliefs and symbols are blasphemed and desecrated in the name of ""artistic expression"". ... the sheer hypocrisy of the American media knows no bounds!!

Unfortunately little is reported today of the new horror spreading over this planet driven by ""radical"" Muslims who use much the same tactics of murder, genocide, rape, mutilation, etc. as a means of intolerance to non-Muslims. One need look no further than those countries that top the list of the World's Ten Worst Human Rights Offenders (Nigeria, Yemen, Myanmar, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Pakistan, The Congo, Sudan and Syria) to see they are all Muslim-based countries overflowing with stories of atrocities against Christians and non-secular Muslims. Innocent men, women and children are being butchered, mutilated and maimed for their faith while the world media REFUSES to report any non-flattering Muslim news that would violate their statute of POLITICAL CORRECTNESS. The events occurring in Africa are purely genocidal and yet because the media looks the other way very few are even aware of it. A recent documentary included interviews with women and young girls who were brutally gang-raped then left to die. Men who were asked to choose ""short sleeves"" or ""long sleeves"" before their arms are chopped off at either the elbows or wrists. Why are there no cries coming from the black community? Why do people like Oprah Winfrey or Barack Hussein Obama make no effort to bring this to the world stage? Who will be their voice?",1388188800,11,8951,4.940159574468085
