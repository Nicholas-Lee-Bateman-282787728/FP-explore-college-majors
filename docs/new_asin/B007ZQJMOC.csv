8523436,5,B007ZQJMOC,"I wasn't sure this would keep their attention since the video is just the lyrics on colorful backgrounds.  My boys are ages 3 & 5.  But they LOVE to watch this DVD in the van and they sing along to all the songs (which is a big deal, my 5 year old typically doesn't care to sing).  It blesses my heart to hear them sing praise!
But the thing I love most about this DVD is that they mix contemporary praise song with older songs & hymns.  I am thrilled that my kids are getting to learn some of the great hymns of the faith along with the new stuff that we sing at church.  I think because it is kids singing on these DVDs that it makes my kids want to sing along, because they don't sing along with other CDs when it is adults singing.
I just cannot be happier with this purchase and am excited to buy more of these as gifts for my friends with kids!",1366848000,,850,3.976470588235294
