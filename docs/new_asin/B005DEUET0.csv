8466778,5,B005DEUET0,"This movie is awesome,I love it all. I saw large unicorn fish colored all black very beautiful an exotic,very rare species, also I saw between 8 to 14 moray eels all in one cave, very rare footage in the Sea Of Cortez. Titan trigger fish, emperor angel fish, sweet lips, puffer fish, schools of Bat Fish and that's just to mention a few of the wonderful exotic creatures you will see. You will see many many species of beautiful tropical coral reef fishes rare ones and lobsters as well as schools of bar jacks, snappers and other ocean fish, hammerhead sharks that hang around the reefs, from some of the most exotic and dense coral reef locations on the planet such as Fiji,Cocos Islands,New Guinea,The Great Barrier Reef and others. A wonderful 240 minutes of beautiful travel mostly underwater photography, all creatures in there natural habitat. There are some scenes on land short scenes with the Divers and others preparing for their next location and dives, very interesting too but 75% is underwater in HD to Bluray video resolution. For Me,I am very pleased with the video quality, clear and bright and for such a great Amazon Price you cannot go wrong so to speak. This enhanced 1997 recordings and up to Bluray HD, overall is well done and up to my satisfaction,an educating and exciting visual treat. This movie is not about evolution, very faint, very little said and if you will, can be ignored. It is more of an educational program all in all, you will learn a lot of facts. Many Challenging dives from those who brought us these under the sea wonders. There was one episode of cave diving that I really enjoyed. This Bluray is one of my Special gems,a favorite in my collection with many beautiful eagle rays, Large groupers and dedicated educated scientist that know what they are talking about. A sobering an educating entertainment. A wonderful Narrator too. This is one of those coral reefs documentaries you will want to have,and will cherish. You will not regret buying this documentary. This was an astounding undersea experience for me. Lots to see and explore. Will be viewing many times again and will be buying the other two in the series. Highly recommended.",1361577600,,2187,4.773087071240106
