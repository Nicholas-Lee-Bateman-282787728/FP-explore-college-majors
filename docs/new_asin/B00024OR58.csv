8216472,5,B00024OR58,"I purchased these DVD's when I was about 6 months into wanting to learn to play Bluegrass upright bass.  There are not many good upright bass instructional DVD's so I thought I'd give it a try, anyways, in my opinion he is one of the best in bluegrass.  It was very clear in showing proper technique and methods to keep up in timing and stamina.  This DVD was not over my head at all and really helped me understand why exactly things were done.  I don't believe that you need to be an experienced musician to learn from these DVD's... he is very helpful in all levels.  I occasionally sit down and watch these again and continue to learn new techniques that I overlooked before.",1219363200,2,679,4.4
8216473,5,B00024OR58,"Todd Phillips has put together two excellent dvds. I've purchased several others but Todd's discs are the ones I'm keeping. A wealth of information even if you've played electric bass for years and are trying your hand at the upright. It isn't so much a teacher telling you how to play, but rather a bass player passing along his knowledge to another player. I hope he continues this series beyond intermediate.",1205971200,2,411,4.802816901408451
