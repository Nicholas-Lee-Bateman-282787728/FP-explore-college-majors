8128792,5,B000G1R3ZI,"When I ordered this DVD, I had no clear idea of who was profiled since there was no list on the description page. Here is a list of episodes for season 1.

On Disc 1:

Kasey Kahne

Kyle Busch (there is also brief mention of his brother Kurt, but the main focus is Kyle)

Erin Crocker

Carl Edwards

Steven Wallace (with brief mention of his dad, Rusty)

Greg Biffle

Martin Truex Jr. (with brief mention of Dale Earnhardt Jr.)

On Disc 2:

Brian Vickers

Casey Mears

Richard Childress Racing (primary focus is Clint Bowyer, but Kevin Harvick is also mentioned)

Jamie McMurray

David Stremme/Reed Sorenson (Chip Ganasi Racing rookies)

Joe Gibbs diversity program (specifically Marc Davis, Chris Bristol & Aric Almirola)

Brandon Dean is mentioned in the product description purely because he is the ""rookie driver"" in the show opening. He is not an actual NASCAR driver.

Hope this is helpful. I know it is information I would have wanted when I was considering buying this DVD.

Does anyone know if there is a second season in the works?",1179878400,17,1040,4.715083798882682
