8329882,5,B001O7GBO2,I love this workout video and the workout. I have lost weight and toned pretty much every muscle in my body.,1363910400,,108,4.190476190476191
8329883,2,B001O7GBO2,"If you are serious about pole dancing, get Felix's Cane's DVD set.  I was disappointed with the DVD.  The instruction is OK, but the individuals doing the moves seem like they need to take a few more classes before producing a how to video on pole dancing.",1362268800,,256,4.425531914893617
8329884,4,B001O7GBO2,"I think it's priced about $15 too much for what it is. (I think a better price would be $20.)

What it is good at: Good upper body and so-so ab workout using pilates-type and a few ballet-type exercises. The band is used a lot. Gets your cardio working. There's lots of good stretching. I think it's a great warmup for starting your pole practice. What's it's bad at: I didn't think the pole move instruction was very good. It was organized haphazardly as well.

I think all of the exercises (not the pole dancing moves, some are quite advanced, definitely recommend a partner to spot you on some) would be quite appropriate for a beginner who wants to get strong enough to try the intermediate/advanced moves.",1296345600,,710,4.582677165354331
8329885,3,B001O7GBO2,"For anyone buying this workout as a pole instruction-you will be disappointed. The only upperintermediate move in my humble opinion there is gemini. The video is split into 2 sections-pilates workout which I personally enjoyed as a thourough warm up, mind you , i enjoyed it mainly because it is new to me.
Then there are 12 combos, some of them do not even include inverts, but I must admit that there is a lot of good sexy transition moves there which I liked, and some good floor work. This is why i rated this 3 star, because of these moves. Unfortunately there is simply not enough instruction there the combos are played really fast and there is not much instruction going on. For me it really does not matter because I know all the moves; but for someone who wants to actually learn intermediate moves I would not recommend this video, it is not safe as the techniques are not demonstated properly.
If you are more experienced and just looking for something different to do,-than maybe. There was an interesting spin there which included three transitions, but you have to be experienced enough to get the momentum to keep yourself going. combos just difficult to follow and I intend to play them on slow to learn the sequences. Should have broken things down more in my opinion.",1293926400,4,1286,4.644736842105263
8329886,4,B001O7GBO2,The workout routine is great.  The dance moves/routines require a great deal of strength.  Would be good to have a spotter to perform some of the moves.,1278806400,,152,4.592592592592593
8329887,4,B001O7GBO2,"I've watched and participated in Dr Amy's Pole Workout only a few times. She does a very professional job with the video. I only wish she took more time going through some of the moves and end routine and also a little slower. I know most of the moves as I have been taking pole fitness classes for 8 months. I think the warm-up is very good, though.",1266710400,,350,4.161764705882353

Awesome workout!  This workout DVD is unlike any other!  It's a great pilates workout with sexy pole dancing -- all in one!  This DVD is the best workout I've ever done and (after having two kids) it's given me my sexy back!",1232841600,3,578,8.0

8329890,5,B001O7GBO2,"I have a pole in my home and own some of the ""instructional"" DVD's that are out there. I had yet to find a great workout DVD using my pole. Not only do you get a FREE exercise band but it is an incredible workout! After buying Volume One I purchased Volume Two and both have great workouts in the beginning of the DVD! She also has a brilliant way of choreographing combination moves so that you can make up your own dance. She includes transitional moves that start and end in the standing position so they are easy to mix and match. This is definately one of the better DVD's out there!",1230681600,8,588,4.212389380530974
