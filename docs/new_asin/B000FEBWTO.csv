2562306,5,B000FEBWTO,"I have to admit to being a grandmother over fifty who adores Max and Ruby. My four grandchildren have grown up on the precious antics of the two little bunnies and never seem to tire of these cartoons. As late as last year, only three or so dvds were available and we ordered them all. Then Katrina flooded New Orleans, my grandchildren's dvds were lost to nine feet of water. One of the first things I wanted to do was try to replace the things they loved most. So when I got online and realized how many more Max and Ruby dvds are now available, I was thrilled. I ordered everything now available on dvd, and honestly could not say which is our favorite. But Afternoons with Max and Ruby contains two of our favorites which are Max's Bedtime and Max's Bath. The children love these dvds. Any child will love them and so will the adult who watches along!",1158192000,12,855,4.35

2562314,3,B000FEBWTO,"Rosemary Wells' illustrations are cute, and I enjoy most of her work. The episodes on this DVD are quite cute and generally feature something rare in most stuff for children: siblings who get along! I was shocked by the episode with Peter, the 7 1/2 year old, whom Ruby and her friend are waiting for, or, should I say, preening themselves for. The idea that flirtatious behavior (and, yes, they are flirting) and pandering to a boy's taste in entertainment (""Do you want to play jacks? Croquet?"") is the best that Ruby can do saddened me, especially in a DVD aimed at young children. It soured my view of this DVD.",1189987200,6,615,4.54954954954955

8121490,5,B000FEBWTO,"This is a perfect DVD to keep on hand for my grandson. It has several episodes for him to watch, so that he can see does not get bored with the DVD.",1393113600,,148,3.65625
8121491,5,B000FEBWTO,"Our granddaughter just turned two and she loves Max & Ruby. We have several of the books and DVDs and she is enthralled with all of them. Max & Ruby are her favorite DVDs--she doesn't want to watch anything else. Highly recommend this and any other Max & Ruby items. The simple, low key and pleasant stories are perfect for little ones. Too much on tv/dvd for kids today is frenetically paced, high energy, loud and obnoxious. Not so with Max & Ruby. Our granddaughter is a very busy two year-old yet Max & Ruby always hold her interest without the loud, attention grabbing tactics of some shows. Sweet stories in the books match up to some of the DVDs. Max & Ruby always show tolerance and understanding even when little brother Max is getting under big sister Ruby's skin....and the stories always end up with little Max having something to offer his bigger and ""all-knowing"" sister Ruby. Our granddaughter even plays pretend Max & Ruby story lines on her own.....so fun to watch her incorporate their antics into her own play. Based on our granddaughter's love of all things Max & Ruby, I highly recommend this item.",1392336000,,1119,4.656565656565657
8121492,5,B000FEBWTO,Hard to find in the local stores so I ordered online and was very happy with the DVD. My grandkids love the movies.,1384300800,,115,4.043478260869565
8121493,5,B000FEBWTO,My boys are only so so on Max and Ruby but I have a nephew that is very into them. I bought this to play where he was over and it he loves it.,1366588800,,142,3.2058823529411766
8121494,5,B000FEBWTO,"The vast majority of children's videos (that i have seen) are either cheaply produced, polluted with commercials, or riddled with concepts not suitable for children.

in stark contrast, the Max and Ruby series is an absolute  delight.

My daughter truly enjoys watching Max and Ruby and so far, all of the stories i have seen are well written and nicely presented.",1361664000,,364,4.934426229508197
8121495,5,B000FEBWTO,My son loves max and ruby and any kind of movie to keep him occupied while I clean is great. He stayed into the movie of different episodes the entire movie.,1353888000,,157,4.096774193548387
8121496,5,B000FEBWTO,"So cute--lots of fun 'movies.' My child is enamoured, and these really make her happy...and even better, it stays on a full loop. She often watches a few, leaves the room to do something else (play in playroom, help with dinner, chase the cat, etc.), and then happily wanders back in to whichever clip is on at that point.",1334534400,,322,4.47457627118644
