3597975,5,B001G9CNI6,"""Eden Lake"" is excellent; my favorite Dimension Extreme film so far!!  The acting is above par, the scenery is really beautiful and the effects are well done.  The ending is not what I wanted to see happen, but more realistic instead.  This one's well worth it though.  This had more of the ""Storm Warning"" feel to it if I had to say which other DE film it most closely resembles, so if you liked that one give this a try.  You won't be sorry.",1231459200,2,443,4.226190476190476
3597976,5,B001G9CNI6,"Brutal with a capital B!  This puts extreme in a whole new dimension.

Current horror films almost always disappoint.  Not this time!  This is one horrifying trip to the lake.
A couple gets terrorized by some teenagers.  I know, I know, it sounds lame.  But these kids don't mess around.

It seems like most new scary movies do little to build tension, set mood, or create a dark atmosphere.  Eden Lake does that all extremely well.  The character development is solid, the acting is more than adequate, the dialogue never gets cheesy.

And the brutality?!?  Geez, it's pretty graphic, not to mention very realistic.  It's bound to make you uncomfortable.  Plus this has possibly the most vicious teenage character in the history of cinema!  This kid needs some parental guidance and discipline Big Time.

Possibly the thing I appreciate most with Eden Lake is how it avoids most lame horror cliches, with some very minor exceptions.  This is a must see for fans of shocking cinema.  Big thanks to my bro DK for pointing this out.

WATCH HORROR AND KEEP AMERICA STRONG!!!!!!!!!",1231459200,,1077,4.824175824175824
3597977,5,B001G9CNI6,"I did not expect much from this movie when I purchased it, but it completely blew me away. WOW! My eyes were glued throughout the entire movie. The suspense was amazing. I definitely recommend this movie to those who enjoy violent flicks. Pick it up--you might like it!",1231372800,,269,4.625
3597978,5,B001G9CNI6,"There's a lot of hype among the horror community regarding Eden Lake and going into it I wasn't sure what to expect. The idea of a couple being terrorized by teenagers didn't exactly strike fear into me. My first thought was give the little brats a time out. But after seeing Eden Lake I am a believer and all the hype regarding this movie is legit and very well worthy of the positive reviews. Eden Lake is the kind of movie that once it gets its grip on you it will never let go and just when you think the film won't cross that line it does and going into the movie you'll probably figure how the movie will end. But you will be wrong; the ending will leave you speechless.

This was the directorial debut for James Watkins and with Eden Lake in my opinion Watkins takes his place among the best ever directorial debuts in the horror genre. With Eden Lake, Watkins crafts a truly horrifying experience that relies more on suspense rather than violence, but with that said the violence in Eden Lake is quite shocking and unsettling because it feels so real. There's no killer who keeps coming back from the dead these are real people and the characters are so believable it's easy to get lost in the film.

The youth of this world is in many ways getting worse and worse; it seems like that is said about every generation, but I think in many ways it's true. There are a lot of good kids in the world, but more and more you hear about these stories about shocking violence and brutality and the person behind it is just a kid. And this problem isn't just in the United States or in the case of this movie the UK. This is a problem all over the world. This is a problem that can be stopped, while I do believe some people are born bad, but in many ways the problems are created by us as a society who ignore the problems, but than point fingers when something bad happens.

The screenplay was also written by James Watkins and the script was excellent. The two lead characters Jenny played by Kelly Reilly and Steve played by Michael Fassbender are excellent and sympathetic characters who are going away for the weekend and end up in a living hell. While Watkins may not break any new ground with his script, both Jenny and Steve are quite likeable and extremely sympathetic; these are two characters you can root for and when something bad happens you'll feel for them. As excellent as the script was, it's the directing by Watkins that elevates this movie.

Eden Lake starts off a bit slow, but in no ways boring. Watkins takes his time and sets up the characters, but he gives you this sense of looming danger. Right off the bat you pretty much get that feeling of dread. There are a couple of false starts where you think something is about to happen, but nothing comes about. But with these scenes James Watkins really sets up a great tone for things to come and when it finally does it's extremely dark and disturbing. James Watkins makes a movie that aims to shock and disturb and wow does he ever deliver.

While Eden Lake has its fair share of violence it's not really the actual act of the violence that is shocking, but the fact the villains are just teenagers. And like I said the fact Jenny and Steve are likeable that also adds to the shock value. The acts committed by these kids are quite sickening and disturbing. Once this movie gets going it never lets you go until the shocking finale. As you are watching Eden Lake you'll probably think you know how everything will play out, but I'm willing to bet that you will be dead wrong.

The suspense and feel of dread created by James Watkins is truly amazing and the fact he is able to sustain this tension through the whole movie shows you the level of talent this man has as a filmmaker. As I was watching the movie I had this sinking feeling the movie would run out of gas and limp towards the finish line, but I was wrong. The pacing is amazing and like I said once this movie gets you in its grip it never lets you go.

As I stated before the violence level is quite high, but again it's not the actual act of the violence so shocking it's the fact that the villains are kids. Like I said earlier in my review the thought of teenagers as the villains didn't strike me as something that would be scary, but I'll admit I was wrong. Brett played by Jack O'Connell is a repulsive and vile character and that is what makes this kid so frightening. After watching Eden Lake I think the fact that Brett was so young and doing these horrible acts is even scarier than if he was an adult.

All the performances in Eden Lake were top notch; Jack O'Connell is excellent and shows some great promise. I really hope to see more of this kid in the future. Kelly Reilly and Michael Fassbender are also excellent and their characters go through some really horrible things and the viewer will really feel for them. I've seen movies where the characters go through extreme levels of torture, but few characters have sparked so much emotion out of me. I think that's a mixture of the great performances from Reilly & Fassbender as well as the writing and directing by James Watkins.

Don't go into Eden Lake expecting a fun ride; this movie isn't a fun movie. It aims to disturb and it succeeds in that area that very few films before have. As you are watching Eden Lake you will probably like it, but after the movie ends and you think back to it that's where you realize the brilliance behind it. Eden Lake is in my opinion the best horror movie of 2008 and this one isn't to be missed.",1231372800,9,5541,4.356243949661181
3597979,5,B001G9CNI6,"this is a great movie, very suspencefull, very upsetting, perfect for fans of the strangers",1231286400,,91,5.133333333333334
3597980,5,B001G9CNI6,"OH MY GOD! That ending is so HORRIFYING and sad. It angers me to no end. Just WHOA! Now I'm not saying the ending is bad, as it actually makes the film better, but it still made me angry.

Kelly Reilly gives one of the strongest female performances of the year in this. It's a shame that the Academy Awards rarely recognize performances in horror films because there are some really good performances out there that are better than some of the ones that go on to get nominated.

What a disturbing and depressing film. But an excellent one nonetheless.

I blind bought it and am not disappointed that I did. It was well worth it.

Now, I feel the need to complain about some of the comments I've read for this movie. First of all, when it comes to movies like this it seems no matter what you ALWAYS have people complaining that the characters were stupid and it was unrealistic, when, unless it's some stupid Direct-to-DVD horror flick I rarely find that to be the case with horror movies nowadays. They seem to know they can't get away with making characters overly idiotic anymore because people are more critical of their horror after being spoiled by many great ones with smart(er) characters. And I find it really irritating how many people are saying that about this one. The characters acted like regular people would. They weren't complete idiots. Yes, they made some little mistakes, but nothing real big. If this were really happening you wouldn't be able to see the outcome of it. It's easy for people to watch a movie and think up things they would do in that situation, but clearly you wouldn't be in the same frame of mind if it were really happening. I find people complaining about the actions of characters in horror movies (unless they're really bad, idiotic horror movies) to be one of my biggest annoyances (ok, maybe not one of my biggest annoyances, but it is an annoyance). Normally I find nothing wrong with their actions and even if I'd have done something different, it doesn't take me out of the movie and I can usually understand why the character did whatever it is that they did. I can't imagine the people nitpicking doing much better in similar situations.

Another thing is people finding this movie unrealistic. Honestly it doesn't seem that improbable, and I've read several comments of people from the UK who say that it's not far off and that kids there do act like this. Maybe not ""quite"" to the extreme that these ones go, but is it really that far-fetched to think that they could? People always seem to think that things like this would never happen, until of course they do. It's sadly not out of the realm of possibility. Similar horrifying things have happened.

Just my two cents...",1231286400,3,2727,4.62396694214876
3597981,4,B001G9CNI6,"There has recently been a new batch of horror movies that go against the ""final girl"" tradition: Wolf Creek, the Strangers, Ils, Inside, Funny Games 2008 remake, and now Eden Lake.  (Briefly, a ""final girl"" confronts the killer and survives the ordeal.  Laurie Strode of Halloween is a ""final girl."")  By eliminating the ""final girl,"" these films deprive the viewers catharsis and moral satisfaction.  They are thus psychologically darker and emotional draining.  EL is such a downer.  If you are looking for some emotional release or happy resolution, do not watch this.  The heroine, whom you will undoubtedly come to identify/empathize, meets dreadful end.

I do not rate EL 5 star because there are a few ""I can not believe she is that stupid"" moments.  For examples, there is one instance where the heroine should have got away, but she chose to remain behind and watch what is being done to her boyfriend. There are also a couple of moments where I feel that the heroine should have stood up and fought back instead of being passive and helpless.  These little moments together made EL less than a satisfying adventure.

Overall, EL is first rate horror. The acting is most excellent. Characters are well developed.  There is plenty of suspense and gore.",1230768000,5,1260,4.8915094339622645
3597982,4,B001G9CNI6,"EDEN LAKE is a surprisingly great quality and well acted Survival/Revenge Horror film. It's a British film written and directed by James Watkins, who happens to be one of the screenwriters for the upcoming sequel to THE DESCENT. The film's plot is simple. A couple, Steve and Jenny, go to a lake out in the middle of nowhere to relax and spend some quality time together. Steve's ultimate goal of proposing to Jenny is ruined when they are harassed by a group of teenagers. Some back and forth trash talking goes on between Steve and the alpha male of the teen troublemakers. To make a long story short, things go a little too far and result with Steve being beaten and tortured. The teens panic and decide in order to not end up in prison that they must simply murder Steve and Jenny and cover their tracks. Jenny, who is normally a sweet and caring person, is now faced with the dilemma of finding the monster within herself in order to get her and Steve out of the area alive. And boy does she.

I was pretty much blown away by this movie. Next to INSIDE, ROGUE, and TEETH, it's probably one of my favorite Dimension Extreme movies. It's not so much the brutality of the film that made me like it, but the suspense that kept my eyes glued to the screen. Don't get me wrong, it IS a brutal film, but to me the suspense and emotion (and sometimes lack thereof) is what made the movie great. It started off as a run of the mill Survival Horror film and the characters of Steve and Jenny pushed the boundaries of the whole ""so in love it's disgusting"" couple that most films set up in order to make their inevitable demise THAT much more heartbreaking. It's clever but it's a cheap way to get the villain(s) of the film over. However, once the film went on, what slight feelings I had of disappointment soon left me. The antagonists in the film are so vile and disgusting and unlikeable. Add that to the fact that Steve and especially Jenny are so extremely likeable and BELIEVABLE as a couple anyway and it makes for a win/win situation. What makes Steve and Jenny real is that most adults can relate to their situation. For instance...

Have you ever gone to a movie theater to simply just relax and watch a movie, only to have your hard earned money wasted when you realize that the teenagers who walked in and sat right in front of you during the trailers will NOT stop talking and laughing? In most cases, people will leave the theater or just sit there and HOPE that they stop talking so that you can enjoy what little free time you have. Regardless, have you ever wanted to lift your leg and kick the back of the head of the annoying person sitting in front of you as hard as you can? Of course you have. If you fit the above description, then congratulations! You can now relate to Steve and Jenny's situation, except multiply it by a THOUSAND. And not only can you relate to them, but chances are you'll enjoy this film. But be warned... without spoiling anything, let's just say that the ending is not a happy one. And with the lack of happiness and relief will come a feeling of pure disgust knowing that the things in this film could actually happen and probably, at some point in time, HAVE happened. The characters in this film are real people. No monsters, no zombies, just regular people, which is what makes EDEN PARK truly horrific.

Granted, the film does have its cliche moments. For example, Steve driving into the woods and taking a shortcut to the lake when his talking GPS thing clearly tells him to ""Turn Around"", at which point him and Jenny look at each other and laugh. Also the story, while well done, is not original and it's ultimately a story that we've all seen before. The film takes a few twists and turns during the climax, leading to an ending that made me feel similar to how I felt when I watched the end of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-MIST/dp/B0010X73ZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE MIST</a>, which is as much as I'll say about that. Gorehounds will also be satisfied as this movie has no shortage of blood and torture. A scene that stands out is one where a kid (who looks like he's about twelve years old) is stabbed in the neck and another one (who looks even younger) being set on fire! Needless to say if violence against teenagers is not your thing, you might want to skip this one. Also, by the end of the film Jenny (played by the adorable Kelly Reilly) is covered from head to toe in what looks like a combination of blood, pus, and feces. Overall, it's not an original movie, but still a suspenseful and violent one. It's not so much disgusting as it is moving. The cast and characters are great, the film quality is better than average, and it's definitely one of those films that you'll be recommending to friends just so you can hear their reaction after watching it. If you're a Horror fan, get your paws on EDEN PARK as soon as you get a chance.

Steve and Jenny find themselves fighting for survival against the young terrors. -summary

I really have to admit that I'm not a fan of the ""Children Gone Wild"" theme. My experiences with these types of films have been nowhere near very bad. Oh no, they have been downright atrocious. I blame this on the cream of the ayatollah of crappyola films such as Children of the Corn, and the misunderstood, unappreciated mass of pieces that I love to hate Who Can Kill a Child?. These two films almost made me abandon my beloved horror genre altogether and steamroll towards musicals. Well I may be stretching the truth right there but you get the point. Eden Lake is the type of horror/thriller hybrid I can get into.

This is the kind of horror I dig the most. Gritty, thought provoking, and most of all... realistic, with people behaving in realistic ways(they have their moments though). Directed by James Watkins and released in 2008, Eden Lake is a British made film that delivered for me on numerous levels despite being slightly cliched and lacking originality.

The couple are put through hell by these aggressive miscreants. The characterization is so well done portraying some of them as evil little bastards. The lead bully Brett(Jack O' Connell) is definitely the show stealer here to me with such a menacing performance. I found him very interesting because there's hints of his troubles taking place at home. The viewer is given bits and pieces to draw their own conclusions. I commend the director for taking the more believable route. Instead of resorting to a useless supernatural gimmick which completely murders any plausibility.

I really enjoy the character development because despite the youngsters actions, it's clear that some of them really aren't at fault. The film does a pretty good job working on typical teenage dilemmas such as peer pressure and bullying. The bully of the group is a true menace, and his associates have every right to fear him because they witness his wrath first hand and they know he means business. The couple are also developed rather well, with their romance given enough time to grow on the viewer which gives it a genuine feel. I do have small issues with at least one character which can also be chalked up as crappy writing. Steve actually does something that I found to be incredibly unrealistic. Maybe on that side of the world people walk into homes of folks they don't know. However, I can't see someone doing that before knocking on the door. I understand the relevance of the scene but it could have been done in a better way.

Although done many times over and over, but a better location couldn't have been found to shoot this film. The forest or the woods remains one of the best settings to deliver a horror film of this nature. Nothing possesses the ambiance, and creates a better sense of dread and hopelessness. The protagonist is always put in a no win situation of course, but this type of environment almost always has the right feel. For these reasons, the suspense remains at a high tempo once the film really gets started.

The gore in the film is minimal, however, when characters suffer from injury they indeed wear the wounds of war pretty well. There are some disturbing moments which makes up for the lack of gore; but during these moments is also when the characters are revealed not to be one dimensional.

Predictability also isn't really an issue here. This happens to be another of the films strengths to a certain degree. Some events can be easily foreshadowed, while others took me by complete surprise. The ending definitely took me by surprise, and to see it wasn't over the top ridiculous was a plus, and I'll just leave it at that. The acting was very good practically all around, but I do have a small issue concerning it. At times, I found it difficult to understand what O' Connell was saying due to his speed and accent when he appeared agitated. I really don't care for subtitles so I have a small issue in this area.

At the end of the day, Eden Lake was definitely a refreshing watch for me. I would gladly take this over any horror comedy any day of the millennium. This is real horror here, and the scary thing is that this could actually happen. Although the film can be disturbing I still recommend this to those whom are searching for something on the realistic side, with characters whom are actually developed and aren't used as mere plot devices. If your idea of good horror is a large body count, an overabundance of gore with eyeball deaths. Then this isn't for you.

Pros: Suspenseful, quite disturbing at times, not really predictable

Cons: Ending will bother many, minor rough spots",1427587200,,5128,4.713169642857143
3598052,4,B001G9CNI6,"4 1/2 stars. A deeply involving edge-of-your-seat thriller. It could be considered a horror film, but there are no supernatural elements -- just pure human evil. Innocent people being stalked by evil.

The characters and plot are quite believable, and the story unfolds in a gradual escalation of violence and terror. Some have complained that the actions of the protagonists are not realistic. On the contrary, I found the behaviors to be 100% believable. This is the great thing about this film -- its reliance on strict veracity. No silly coincidences. No dumb behavior. In the heat of the moment, all the actions could have unfolded as shown. It is absolutely believable for the protagonists to high-speed escape in their  vehicle from a gang of violent youths with knives -- as anyone can tell you who has lived in an urban environment. Even if you haven't been personally affected by such a crime, you can read about many instances of gang violence or robbery carried out by youths with knives. Driving in twisty forested dirt roads is not easy, even at low speed. So, for some reviewers to claim this scene is nonsensical -- you haven't lived.

Entering the boy's home looking for the parents -- this was a natural, if ill-advised, act.  But, it was a perfectly innocent thing to do when trying to find a responsible adult to reprimand youngsters who are supposedly under the control of their parents or guardians. Caught up in the moment, the protagonist just happened to wander too far into the empty house. (In a sense, I have actually done such a thing myself! I thought a house was so dilapidated that I thought it had been abandoned. The basement door was open. I wandered around in the basement, until I heard what sounded like a TV on the floor above. Uh-oh! I knew who used to live there (not good people), and I knew I had to get out fast. So, yes, I can relate to the protagonist's position in finding himself inside a vacant house that suddenly has an occupant.)

The acting was excellent. The violence is not sugar-coated. I won't give away the ending, but let's just say that the veracity is kept true to form.",1426809600,,2131,4.656914893617022

It's dark, bleak, controversial, and somewhat topical.  It has the us against them or slobs vs. snobs type script, and that's all that matters.  This happens.

Eden Lake, tells the strory of a young couple out for a romantic camping trip when they are suddenly crossed by a young group of the most annoying bratty little punks I think i have ever seen on screen. It starts off as basic disrespect a fight oiler beach space and very basic quests for the children to be polite and allow our couple the weekend they were expecting, but to these kids  they will have none of that, and when the banter causes the death of one of the kids dogs all bets are off.
In an amazing trick, the filmmakers use, you will forget these are kids but then just as something happens you are reminded that there just lost kids and you almost feel for them but that is quickly snatched away by another even worse deed by them.
Neither side is right in this film, our couple make mistakes as well as the kids which add to the realness of the film. All i know is i haven't watched a dvd in recent years that i talked back to the screen as much as this film, you want to jump in and help; and oddly at different times either sides.
The last bit of the film is kinda a little obvious and lacked the impact i am sure they intended, the whole ""the apple dosnt fall far from the tree etc.."" but i understand why it was necessary .

I caught the opening scenes, pastoral goings-on with a couple out for a drive, suddenly over their heads in an escalating cascade of ever more horrific yet realistic violence, and I couldn't even sit down.  I stood the whole movie, until 3 AM.  Now thanks to Amazon I have my own copy.  The director comments that in test viewings, he saw viewers leaving the theater with ashen faces.  He said, 'I've done my job'.  You can turn the wrong corner in your car, on your bike, while out hiking in the woods, anyone can do it, and be so far into trouble you cannot get out of it. There comes a time in the lives of the unfortunate among us when they realize that despite all the times they've scraped their way out of bad situations, this time nothing is going to work.  The directing, photography, sound, editing, acting, casting, writing, pacing - every thing about this movie is perfect.  When it hurts on screen, you jump in your seat and grab the spot, you are so into the scene.  Give the kids to Grandma and Grandpa. Take the battery out of your cell phone, pull the phone line from the wall, turn off your computer, put a sign on the door ""On Vacation, Back Next Week"", and power this up.  Alone.  If you dare.

I don't like reviews that give away the whole story but I will say this, sociopathic kids are the scariest of all.  The part of the brain that can understand consequences simply isn't developed until human beings reach their mid twenties.  This might, in part, explain why we've all done so many stupid things as kids.  This couple runs into the wrong group of teenagers and for the next 90 minutes you might as well be breathing through a straw.  The tension is fantastic, the violence graphic, and I'm still telling people about this movie years after seeing it.  Definitely worth a viewing.

The building of suspense was absolutely perfectly executed. This starts out almost boring and becomes increasingly more and more intense until you are completely immersed in emotion. The climax is right at the end and is powerful. All human emotion occurs for the viewer.

3598144,4,B001G9CNI6,"...if that makes any sense. ""Eden Lake"" is a survival/horror/thriller from 2008 about an English couple who take a trip to a remote lake that the guy enjoyed when he was young. The lake's going to be turned into a development and he wants to share it with his girlfriend and propose before it's gone forever. Unfortunately, they run into a pack of hellion pubescents and all hell breaks loose.

As you can see, the plot is part ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deliverance/dp/6305558159/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deliverance</a>"", part ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-House-on-the-Left-Rated-Unrated-Versions/dp/B002DKGWSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last House on the Left (Rated & Unrated Versions)</a>"" (2009), part ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Spit-on-Your-Grave-Unrated/dp/B0041KKYCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Spit on Your Grave (Unrated)</a>"" (both versions) and part ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Village-of-the-Damned-Children-of-the-Damned/dp/B00027JYMG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Village of the Damned/Children of the Damned</a>"". Is it as good as these films? It's definitely not as good as the first two and the remake of ""I Spit"", but I guess it depends on your definition of 'good.' The 2009 remake of ""Last House on the Left"" addresses some of the same themes and is both horrifying and thrilling, but it's also ultimately redeeming and life-affirming. You can say the same for ""Deliverance,"" although ""Last House"" is arguably better, a masterpiece, in fact (the 2009 version). Even ""I Spit"" leaves you with a sense of justice served. But ""Eden Lake"" lacks these qualities and just leaves the viewer with a depressing sense of disgust and nigh hopelessness. If this was the goal of the filmmakers then it's definitely a ""good"" film.

Yet ""Eden Lake"" is good in other ways too. My wife & I viewed it last night and had a long discussion about it this morning. I understood the pack of kids in the story because I hanged out with a similar pack at the same age and we were almost as bad, although we didn't torture or kill people physically. Like the kids in the film -- we came from dysfunctional families with parents who had largely lost their moral compass with the passing of spiritual devotion. As such, the kids are merely the result of the immoral wasteland we live in.

But that's not all we talked about. There are many parts of ""Eden Lake"" that are ripe for interesting discussion. For instance, the guy underestimating the malevolent power of the kids due to their age; and the folly of the couple to obliviously hang around after repeated bad omens.

The film is also effective in depicting the female protagonist fleeing in a dazed state of shock -- injured, bloodied and muddied. This was reminiscent of the potent post-rape scenes in ""I Spit on Your Grave."" There are also some parts that don't work so well, like the man roaming freely through a stranger's house. Who in their right mind would do that? Still, ""Eden Lake"" works if you're looking for a horrifying, disgusting film that's a sad commentary on the human condition.

I encourage you to read Mark Eremite's 2-Star review to balance out this review.

The film was shot in Buckinghamshire, England, and runs 91 minutes.

Although the film is very well done, artistically, cinematographically, etc., I strongly advise you to avoid it.  The plot is very basic and the incidents that flow are predictable and as the descriptions warn, graphic and terrible.  Without spoiling the end, it presents a dark twist that is ""satisfying"" in the sense of evoking strong emotions and feelings, but there is no reason for this film to exist and you should probably not watch it unless you are ok with an excruciatingly negative ending.  I object to the this view of human nature and society when it is presented as being pervasive and without dissent - I'm sure that's not what the author was insinuating, but I took it that way.  All people are not like the people presented in this film.  One thing that could have been done better - I didn't even care much for the ""innocent"" couple in the film - not much was done to endear them to the viewer.

None of the actors appeared to be interested in making this movie unique which made every scene come across as pretentious. The music score is irritatingly redundant and dejecting.

A naive romantic couple travel to Eden Lake which happens to be in a corrupt small town occupied by boorish rubes. At Eden Lake they encounter a small group of boorish teens. Throughout the slow paced movie the teens escalate their harassment against the romantic couple until it leads to robbery, physical assaults, and the obvious. The theme of this movie involves the disturbing idea that vicious evil can be hidden and can escalate at unexpected locations.

The pack of evil teens were played out unconvincingly be awful actors who didn't seem to know what to do during the movie. Their british accents are so thick that I could barely comprehend a single word that was said throughout the entire movie.

The movie starts with the planning of a nice week-end by a couple who plans to get married. You know that something bad is going to happen to them but don't know how and why.

And then we slowly understand when we see the white trash, trailer park people who are living in the village next to Eden Lake. Bad parents are usually the reason the kids are bad. A simple, reasonable move would be to just say no, leave the place after the first threat. Teaches us a lesson that sometimes, we have to keep it low and pick up a useful fight to fight. Don't fight all the fights that are in front of you. Chose the one that you have a chance to win! Be smart, don't think you are a coward if you decide to move on.

3598202,1,B001G9CNI6,"A shockingly stupid script can not be overcome by crane and helicopter shots, by good actors, by nice locations and local color.  If your story is full of unbelievable behavior, then even lovers of gratuitous torture may find the going tough.  There is simply no way the ""innocent"" couple in this story would behave they way they do; it's all a pretext for the writer/director to get them in peril and tortured and hunt.

But there are people who really like torture stories, regardless of logic:  it's their style of pornography.  That's okay, porn serves useful purposes.

But what users of Amazon have to be aware of is this:  Eden Lake is highly rated.  This worthless movie is more highly rated than a significant number of worthwhile horror movies.  Now I don't believe the ratings process can be totally disregarded because of this movie's rating but there is a message here.  People who are not fans of torture porn must be very careful in evaluating the ratings of various horror movies.  Horror is a tough genre:  because stars are not needed to sell it, there are fewer barriers to entry and bad scripts like this can be shot.

But horror lovers are less discriminating than others.  I simply don't believe a stupid rom-com would ever be as highly rated as a bad horror film.  This is because rom-com fans, however delusional or unsophisticated in terms of story, won't seize on some extra-story feature such as torture scenes to justify their ranking.

If you're not a fan of violence and torture for their own sake, I would not trust the rankings of horror films on this site.  Nor would I trust any reviewer who liked this movie.  Sometimes a litmus test is presented in criticism and there's definitely one here.  Anyone who likes this movie -- without admitting the torture scenes are what he or she is really into -- cannot be trusted in terms of an opinion on horror.  Their love of pornography is too strong.

Unfortunately, these kids don't take kindly to adult interference, and what started off as obnoxious behavior quickly gets out of control and turns violent. And when you think the violence can't get any worse, it does.

This movie is not for everyone, as evidenced by the reviews here on Amazon. The violence becomes increasingly difficult to watch. Some people also complained that the movie is not realistic, but how many movies are? I, however, don't find it hard to believe that a series of events could spiral out of control like they do in Eden Lake. And Steve's behavior is plausible - his masculinity is threatened by the punks and he stands up to them, not realizing how far they are willing to go.

The ending shook me. That's all I'll say about it, because viewers should experience it raw.",1338076800,,1221,4.727699530516432

But what most people are missing is that this is more than just another thriller horror; this is actually a social commentary on the hooliganism among the young British teens. Yes, this portrays the real ugliness of what teenagers nowadays(mainly the UK) do. They will play crude and dark pranks at you that ends up being more disastrous than comedic(well except for the hooligans of course). People seem to overlook at these issues and just think lightly of it. ESPECIALLY the hooligans' parents. Most of their parents are very much in the dark when it comes to knowing about their children. In the film, one of their parent even defends herself by saying ""not my kids"" when the couple asked the parent about hooligans around the area. While this film on the surface looks like another thriller horror, it's a social commentary on how teens, not just in the UK, but all over the world can be. They can be just as cruel as grown-ups. They can be just as violent as the grown-ups. And I think this film with the undertone about this social commentary, reveals the ugly truth about children nowadays. And that's why I think this is an important film to watch, even among your average movie-goers.

3598228,5,B001G9CNI6,"If you take ""Kids"", add some ""Deliverance"", and a dash of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", the concoction could be called ""Eden Lake"". That description may sound shallow, and I do not intend it to. I will forever sing the praises of EDEN LAKE. This movie is fantastic. Simple, and familiar story conveyed so boldly, and with so much intensity. The cast is phenomenal! Cinematography is dead on, not a lot of bells and whistles, but it works- brilliantly! These serene, lush woods help to create an atmosphere of utter dread and fear. The pace of the movie is perfect. You don't feel as if all 5 senses are being bombarded with stimuli for 90 minutes, as you do with many contemporary horror films, IMO. Don't get me wrong, thats cool. Nothing wrong with an occaisional assault to the senses, but too often you find yourself thinking, ""Man, give this director his meds already!""
EDEN LAKE manages to be intense, harrowing, and terrifying, without scene after scene of ""lets see how far we can push the envelope"" violence. I admit, I am usually right there, eyes glued to the screen when the latest sick, twisted, ode to depravity comes out. However, sometimes you want something not so transparent, am I right? Shock for shock's sake can get mundane just like anything else.

3598229,5,B001G9CNI6,"This is my kind of movie. I love a good thriller that tests me and this certainly does. The filmmakers hit a home run out of the park with this movie! It was nonstop action, twists and even a bit of horror.

A loving London couple (Steve and Jenni) takes a camping trip into the woods only to be harassed and stalked by a group of local teens. It starts with them playing their music too loud when Steven and Jenni are relaxing at the lake. Steven tells them to turn it down and gets a cloud of disrespect in return. The gang is made up of about six guys and one girl and it's easy to determine that they are out for no good.

The gang begins to stalk Jenni and Steven and even steals their SUV. After Steven kills their dog, all heck breaks loose. The teens are determined to kill the couple no matter what they have to do. They capture Steven, torture him by cutting him all over his body but he gets away when they plan to finish him off.

Meanwhile Jenni tries to find her way out of the woods and meets back up with Steven. But from that point on the couple's reunion is sadly short-lived.

I won't tell much more at risk of revealing the spoilers and twists. It's a movie you have to see to understand. This is not your average film about people being in danger at the hands of maniacs. It's much deeper than this. It's as if the kids have a hold on this small community and just when Jenni thinks she's found help, she ends up in more trouble than before.

I loved the mystery surrounding the kids especially the leader Brett. Brett is so unbelievably cruel and you keep wondering why. The filmmakers never show us and that's okay. It heightens the suspense. As you watch you piece together why Brett is so screwed up and seeing his family it makes perfect sense. I didn't understand why the other kids would follow him but then again kids submit to peer pressure so that could be the reason. His friends don't seem as cruel as he but still quick to dish out the punishment at his commands.

What I loved most was Jenni. She was the perfect heroine. She was strong and tough yet vulnerable. She showed weakness but held her ground. She was three dimensional and she slowly changes from victim to warrior the longer her life is in danger. I hate weak heroines so Jenni was a welcomed sight. She took charge while Steven held onto dear life and you couldn't help but root for her. Whether her will to live saves her or not is something you just have to watch the film to find out.

I enjoyed this movie a lot, needless to say. The only thing I'd mention that seemed unbelievable was just how long Jenni and Steven ran around without finding the road. I mean they simply drove into the woods within minutes so even if they did get lost I think as much as they ran around they would've found it.

This movie was so good that I can exclude a few question marks. It kept me entertained and on my toes at every, blood-draining moment and that was enough for me. Definitely the best movie I've seen in a long time.

Highly recommended for thriller fans especially.",1327017600,,3063,4.2854671280276815

It is not for all tastes and it is difficult to recommend. It is harrowing; though, it does not fall into torture porn. The story is simple enough: young couple terrorized by teenage toughs in a park so large one may as well be in the woods. I was disappointed that the boyfriend behaved stupidly early on in the film because one does not have to get into a heated exchange or do other ill-advised things to draw the attention of a gang of thugs.

After all that happened too her and her boyfriend, she manages too kill one kid and immediately feels bad about it. She kills another one purely by accident.

3598244,4,B001G9CNI6,"Somebody must have seen. Somebody must have heard. Evidently, someone was crafty enough to actually do their homework & make a horror film which sets out to do exactly what a horror film should do. British director James Watkins get it's right. Hoo boy! Eden Lake gets my vote for being one of the most brutal depictions of a vacation gone wrong that I've seen in many years. In the brutal tradition of Wolf Creek or High Tension, Eden Lake carries a big stick & reminds it's faithful viewers that no place on earth is safe from harm.

Steve & Jenny are just your average couple looking to spend a weekend away from the hustle of everyday life & Eden Lake seems like just the place to go. At first sight, it's rather ideal & the idea of spending a few days drinking lager in between making love is certainly appealing. Not to mention the atmosphere is rather lovely & romantic. What could possibly go wrong?

After a group of unruly teenagers repeatedly harass our love birds, things spiral completely out of control & the merciless group of kids in acts a plot of revenge which could only end tragically or with a severely traumatized couple if survival were even an option. It's obvious from the very beginning that these kids have some serious issues & their anger is unlikely to subside anytime soon. Over the course of an hour, Steve is brutally attacked by these young but murderous villains & stabbed repeatedly. Jenny's only hope is to somehow find her way out of the woods & seek assistance while trying to avoid these dangerous hooligans.

Unlike the typical slasher film genre, Eden Lake is extremely bleak in it's depiction of harrowing violence & the acts of terror unleashed on the unsuspecting world. Rather than just being satisfied with a mere formulaic approach, Watkins breathes a great deal of life into his characters & makes it difficult for his viewer not to care about the couple who lives are in constant peril throughout the film. He also forces us to question our beliefs on raising children & the hostile environment some of them have been accustomed to. Naturally, there are no easy answers & a happy ending is definitely not a given in this case.

You will soon forget all your troubles. How quickly your own fears or troubles will seems insignificant & vague.

While Eden Lake may not fall into the same trappings of the so-called torture porn genre, it's one of the more brutal entries that dares it's viewer to continue watching the atrocities committed by our youth.  Rather than just being a bloody horror film which extracts chills from it's intended audience, Eden Lake also works well as first-rate thriller with it's suspenseful pace & inevitable tension. Get your hands on this one as soon as you can. Eden Lake may be one of the best films released by Dimension Extreme to date right next to Inside or Broken.",1308528000,7,2850,4.6673306772908365
3598245,3,B001G9CNI6,"I just want to say right off the bat that `Eden Lake' is a terrible film.  I mean, there are few films that make me nauseous to the point of wanting to actually STAB a person to death, but `Eden Lake' simultaneously made me sick to my stomach and enraged to the point of mental instability.

THERE ONLY KIDS...and yet, they are sick, sick...SICK.

`Eden Lake' brings absolutely nothing new to the table, unless you consider the idea of a pack of youths being the perpetrators of grotesque violence `new', but it works because of some slick directing/editing that continually keeps you on edge and brings ample amounts of fear.  I, sadly, heard the ending long before ever actually seeing the film, so some of the surprise was deflated from my viewing pleasure (if that word is even appropriate for this breed of film) and yet I was still held in a tense web of fear while watching it.

The film follows a lovely pair (Steve and Jenny) of lovebirds who are taking a vacation into the woods to visit a lake that Steve has visited before and finds so beautiful and secluded he just has to take his blushing love interest, and soon to be fianc (yes, he has a ring in his pocket).  Before they even make it to the lake, they brush alongside the native flock and find their taste rather bitter.  Yes, the warning signs (clichd ones at that) abound heavily in this film, and the stereotypical way with which the `trailer trash' type characters found in `these here parts' could be comically generic were they not genuinely terrifying.

While you can feasibly think of a million things Steve and Jenny could have done `better', there really seems like no other alternative to their fates than the one paved away for them in this film.

Michael Fassbender is quickly proving himself one of the best `new' actors gracing the screen today.  While this is not one of his finest moments (that is only to say that his onslaught of other screen appearances are better), he is still gripping and dripping with charm.  The real standout here is Kelly Reilly, who is just brilliant here.  She delivers so many sides of her characters, and it shows in every frame.  Whether she's coyly vying for attention or genuinely petrified; pleading for her life or brutally defending herself...she is a force in this film.  UGH, and that final scene, in the bathroom...just...my eyes are still stinging from the tears!

So, in the end I can't really praise this film much.  It is terrifying in many parts, and it holds up the thrills for the majority of the film, but the bountiful clichs and the use of such young children in a horrific light (at one point they even light a young boy's head on fire) really make this cinematic experience one I could certainly live without.

But I'll always have Kelly Reilly's performance to remember fondly.",1308528000,4,2815,4.631790744466801
3598246,2,B001G9CNI6,"Ya know, I'm really starting to wonder what kind of people 'make' these types of films. And who gets off on really watching em'.

Here we go again with another 'sweet couple' taking an ill-fated vacation into the deep-deep-dark woods for a little romantic fun! And, suddenly, they're running for their lives from a bunch of sadistic backwood psychos. In this case, it's a group of redneck little punks. Just imagine 'The Lord of the Flies' meets 'The Hills Have Eyes'. Or,'The Children of the Corn' without any corn! But really, really bloody and nasty.

I will admit, the little brats are pretty wicked. Of course, there's the demented leader that bullies the gang to 'Kill for him, or else!' And, after watching him for over an hour run his mouth, stamp his feet and act like a little snot, I really wanted (!!) to reach into my flat screen and slap the crap out of him. Oh, and that ugly little mean girl too, who, of course,videotapes all the wonderful carnage on a cellphone.

After watching this poor couple get tortured (slashed up, tongue cutout, burnt at the stake)for what seems like forever...(!) I kept hoping that one of them, well, the girl, would get the upper hand. For a hot minute, she does. But then, after a 'very contrived' car crash, (there's two of them, I might add) evil greets her once again. And it's not good. The ending will probably stay with me for a very long time....yeah, it's pretty brutal.

But it made me so angry. Do the creators of these torture films think that after 'all this time', after films like 'Saw and Hostile' that they're still being witty? Clever? I'm I supposed to feel as if I've been punked' with a 'ain't it so creepy kool' climax?

Sorry guys, after 'Wolf Creek' (which I really, really liked) and even 'The Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning', or even, 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas' (which was a real downer!)...nothing fazes me anymore. Anyone else out there...?... feeling a little tired of these kind of horror films (if you really want to call em' that) where there is alot of mean violence but no real 'pay-off'?

Thank god (!!) for retro-slasher films like 'Mother's Day' 'Final Terror' 'Just Before Dawn' 'My Bloody Valentine' 'Final Exams' 'The Dorm that Dripped Blood' 'House on Sorority Row' 'Hell Night' 'MountainTop Motel Massacre' 'Eaten Alive' 'Blood Beach' 'Graduation Day' 'The New Kids' 'Savage Streets' 'Chopping Mall' 'Prom Night' 'Terror Train' 'The Prowler' 'Madman' 'The Burning' and'Tobe Hooper's The Funhouse' (my all time favorite) and many other super kool 80's horror. (and Black Christmas', even though it was in the 70's) It all started here!

If it wasn't for these films, and of course, the master of all 'Halloween'. Plus,'Friday the 13th' and 'Texas Chainsaw', crap like Eden Lake would never have seen the light of day. It just bites that anyone with dough can make these types of films, and get it on the market today. But, on the other hand, it does give the genre a wider selection.

Good for them! The up and coming new horror directors! And Good for their Movies! They will always have an audience. And Good for People who like to watch 'nice people, on film, get slashed, mangled, tormented, and torched alive for an hour and a half. To each its own. Heck, I'll still probably watch more in the future. Because I really, really love, horror films. I also LOVE studying them.

But, I'll never stop cherishing the true groovey oldies from the 80's! The Bodycount Bible of 'slasher' films!

Eden looks great!  But what doesn't these days?  With digital film making so accessible for anyone to use, you could mix a frog in a blender and make it look like a million bucks.

But, if you like your flicks, mean, lean and filled with gore. Than, Eden Lake is the place to be. And, once again, I will have to admit, the ending is still playing out in my mind.  Jeeeeez...that poor woman goes to hell and back only to end up...so, so depressing.

3598248,4,B001G9CNI6,"When I first heard of this movie it was with the caveat that the teens in the movie were worse than those in ""Kids.""  Hesitant to believe, I nonetheless added it to the queue and found that not only was the warning accurate, it might be a bit understated.

Full of brutal, gritty violence, Eden Lake is a device through which director James Watkins unleashes a group of kids who are the walking, breathing reasons for abstinence and birth control, yet never really explores anything new in the rehashed horror in the wilderness subgenre.  Nonetheless, the execution of what's expected is nearly flawless.

Steve (Michael Fassbender) decides to take his girlfriend Jenny (Kelly Reilly) for a romantic, secluded weekend at Eden Lake.  Things go awry when they run into the aforementioned hell-spawn.  Eventually malice appears as the kids terrorize the couple and threaten to kill them.  The action and danger reaches a crescendo when Steve and Jenny must either fight or run.  The kids have already decided on the latter choice.

While a ton of new ground isn't covered, the psychopathic kids in this movie are more believable than humanity should allow.  The reason this movie is so terrifying is because of its believability.  The two leads show true chemistry, a spark often missing in most films.  Similar to what the Hostel series has done for eastern European travel, this is a film that could cause paranoia.  And an eventual reservation on a cruise line.

What makes this film more memorable is its ending.  An emptiness is created by the void and lack of humanistic resolution.  Even in chaos we strive for harmony.  We seek catharsis of completion.  This film challenges that feeling and leaves the viewer wanting.  Questioning.  A great end to an already stand-out horror film.

- A hot actress!
- Good, believable acting all around for the featured characters.

What you can learn from:

- Use common sense and watch out for danger signs before you end up
  as a victim of crime.
- Never go to abandoned spots anywhere without massive protection.
- If in doubt, escape.

I was rooting to see how the good couple can fight their way out of being
statistics in the next crime chart, but alas, evil wins again in this movie.
A totally sour ending with the bad guys killing the innocent couple.
The couple started out in the movie as a pair of romantics but ended
up being horribly butchered by evil children and their trashy parents.
How did those scumbag kids end up so evil?
Blame their rotten behaviors on their equally violent parents.
That's how many kids turn out when you don't whip them for their evil
behaviors. Criminal parents breed criminal children.
The generational cycle never ends with bad blood.

Expect some gore in this movie.
The ending was totally unexpected as I had expected the seemingly
well-adjusted heroine to turn into Ms Rambo after her first self-defensive
kill in the woods. She did wake up fast to her dire circumstances when her man
was murdered by those evil ""children"" (violent adults in the bodies of kids).

After Steve has an encounter with a group of rude juveniles, the pair return to find that their SUV has a flat tire.  Matters escalate the following day, when after spending a pleasant afternoon at the lake, the couple discover that their phone is missing, and then are also almost run down by the group of teens who have stolen their vehicle.

Darkness falls as Steve and Jenny attempt to walk out of the woods.  Drawn by the light of a fire, Steve confronts the teenagers.  He recovers the car keys, but enrages Brett (Jack O'Connell) the leader of the group.  The couple makes a mad dash to the car and attempt to escape, but Steve is pinned in the vehicle after a crash, leaving Jenny on her own in the middle of the woods.

I found this subject matter to be disturbing yet highly possible in this day and age. Hey, read the headlines! I thought it was unique in this. I do however wish the Boyfriend had lived. The end was shocking (to me at least). I thought it was very well made and the acting was very good. Also, those parents and that little town were creepy!",1277424000,2,641,4.262295081967213

Tedious for me but if you're s fan of slasher flicks this film is going to send you into the throes of rapture because it is relentless in it's depiction of violence and degradation.",1265068800,3,549,4.978260869565218

It will keep you on the edge of your seat, and unlike most American made flicks with satisfying/agreeable endings, this one unsettles you.

3598280,1,B001G9CNI6,"If you're reading this, you probably know the plot: a couple go to a park that is about to be demolished for the condominium set, being that the man wants to show his girlfriend a childhood memory before its destroyed (shades of DELIVERANCE).  While they camp on the lake shore, some kids show up far off, doing there own (loud) partying.  First mistake: guy goes over to tell kids off (nicely)...okay, they seem to take it fairly well.  Then Kelly Reilly doesn't take her top off (disappointing), they have some character bondage (not THAT kind), kids play a prank (flattens SUV tire), they leave park, man finds main kid's home (bike is parked in front), man flats out the kid's bike and they take off.

Now you would THINK that after this, they would (a) go to another park or (b) the man would listen to his girlfriend and do what SHE wanted, being that (a) they saw the lake and (b) the vacation wasn't too vacationy when punk a$$ kids begin to ruin it.  Unfortunately, this is a horror movie and characters aren't allowed to act normal, and that is where this film falls apart... at least for me.

Here there be spoilers..... still here?  Okay, here we go!

Now I may have the order of the above events mixed up, but basically they go back to the park and back to the exact same spot they camped at before.  Needless to say, this time the kids steal the SUV from them.  So now they are vehicleless in the middle of a soon-to-be-shutdown park.  Eventually they find the kids, highjinks ensue whereupon the main kid's dog rushes the man, who then stabs and kills the dog in self-defence.  Main kid doesn't see it that way, but one of the other kids give the man the keys to the SUV regardless.  Man and girl get into the SUV with kids in hot pursuit, man drives wildly through forest (though it is nighttime by this point), wrecks vehicle and gets himself pinned by a tree branch sticking through the window.  The rest of the movie is (1) man getting tortured by kids (revenge for dog) and (2) man's girlfriend doing the John McClane.

To save you the ending, she winds up stealing the car from one of the main kid's friends (after hiding out in a dumpster filled with pus and stabbing one of the younger gang members in the neck with a piece of glass)  and leaving them in the woods, whereupon reaching civilization she gets broadsided by another car (you never see that person ever).  She stumbles out to the house she wrecked in front of and the people take her in... yet rather than call paramedics (being that she's covered in puss and blood, with a gaping hole in her ankle AND just had a car T-bone her in front of said house) they take her in and comfort her when the main kid shows up.  Now HOW he got there that fast when (1) she stole their car and (2) man and girl had bad cell phone reception in woods, which would mean kids would too, is beyond me.  Anyways, it just so happens that ALL the parents of ALL the mean kids are partying at this particular house, which means that as soon as they find out what happened, they snuff poor Ms. Reilly.

I know, long winded.  Frankly, by the half-way point of the movie, I just gave up on the main characters.  There is only so much stupid stuff a character can do before they reach a point where they may as well deserve to die or at least lose my sympathy.  The same goes when I realize the director/writer is PURPOSEFULLY having characters do stupid things or have certain situations pop up (like Ms. Reilly/the girl finds the man's wedding ring he was going to propose with.. AFTER she saw him bleed to death from the torture the kids inflicted) to blatantly press emotional buttons... you know, like THE COLLECTOR (ugh).

Bottom line: if you haven't seen too many horror films, this may really get to you.. provided that obvious director/writer manipulation doesn't bug you.  Otherwise, torrent, borrow or rent first.

PS: of these MOVIES TO DIE FOR releases, so far I found DONKEY PUNCH to be the best: it delivers some decent skin, gore is reasonable without being TOO grotesque and most importantly for a DEAD CALM rip-off it is actually fairly well done (namely characters act as you would expect them to: in fact, there are moments where you yell at the screen for the character to do something, and maybe a minute or less later they're actually doing it)

But, to quote a more illustrious philosphical a-hole than myself: ""That's just me; I could be wrong.""",1263168000,20,4427,4.460297766749379
3598281,3,B001G9CNI6,"I came to this movie knowing it wouldn't change my life and I was right. It's not a great movie by any means but fans of the genre may wish to check it out anyway. It does have some aspects that put it above the rank and file slasher flick. As a matter of fact, that's the thing that is so frustrating about it. The good parts are so good it's a shame they couldn't sustain them.

Here's the scoop. A loving couple go on a holiday to Eden Lake. Fairly early on they have trouble with some of the local teens. Things escalate to the point where they get out of hand and the two are now on the run for their lives.

What is very cool here is the way it all starts out. A couple small but still disconcerting things happen that are more annoying than threatening. These things start to build and get more disturbing. Many of the older viewers might associate with the scenes where the adults are forced to confront these young folks who have no respect for them. This forces the issues and things snowball from there.

All aspects of the production are fine. Though obviously not an expensive movie, all the shooting, editing, acting etc. are professional. The problem lies in the script. The first 45 minutes or so are outstanding in the way they give the viewer an uneasy feeling that slowly but inexorably builds to a sense of dread then outright horror. Unfortunately, when all the cards are on the table, it lapses into a rather routine hunt and kill. I say rather because even in the thick of things there are a few elements of the story that still have merit. It simply isn't enough to overcome the hack aspects of the procedures.

That being said, I can still recommend it to fans of slasher films. I didn't feel as though I wasted my time, and it was good to see something new brought to a genre that seems to have fewer and fewer surprises.",1262044800,,1847,4.329479768786127

This kind of obvious-ending torture genre is starting to make me furious. The writing choices were horrible. Nobody is as stupid as this couple. You can tell they're both going to die from the first time the ""Scary Killer Teens"" almost cause them to wreck at the beginning. You don't walk into a group of spoiled brat kids who own a Rottweiler and start demanding your stuff back. You wait in the shadows and kidnap them one by one before they get the jump on you. . .after you kill their dog, of course. So she stabs the one kid in the neck who slashed her boyfriend's mouth open with a box cutter, and after she kills him, she cradles him in her arms and weeps. What? At this point, I'm fast forwarding to the end, which I've already guessed. I'm sick, sick, sick of these nihilistic writers trying to shock us with plots that end with no hope at all. Give me a movie where the boyfriend pulls himself out of the barbed wire restraints and hides under the shack until his girlfriend can mop up the woods with the rest of these sick pubescent idiots, then deliver their mangled bodies in several small packages via UPS to their parents' doorsteps. That's the kind of horror movie I want to see. Skip Eden Lake, and while you're at it, skip every other movie James Watkins writes or directs out of protest.

You could see the unjust ending coming, but I refused to believe that the poor woman would meet her end so far from home. When it finally happened, I was heartbroken. I've seen plenty of films who's stories revolve around an innocent couple being harassed by hooligans, but Eden Lake has a realistic quality that affected me on an emotional level. Kind of like when you watch the NEWS and see report after report about violent crimes and although you agree that it's bad, it doesn't affect you that much. Then the NEWS reports on something that's no more or less violent than the others, yet it seems to hit you in the gut and leave you gasping. That's what Eden Lake did to me just now. I'm shocked at the injustice of it. Because it's drawn such a strong emotion from me, I'm rating Eden Lake a 5.",1259107200,3,864,4.372670807453416
3598285,3,B001G9CNI6,"Since the top review for ""Eden Lake"" has already exposed all the key plot points, I don't feel like I'll be spoiling anything by just diving right in. First of all, I don't agree with this being labeled a horror film  -- something I suppose is a marketing ploy because low-budget horror sells better than low-budget thriller (this won two off-radar horror/fantasy awards in Europe). The film's basic premise has been done much better and just as sadistically in ""A Clockwork Orange"" (punks terrorize yuppies) and ""Deliverance"" (rural yokels terrorize city folk), by which I mean that there are no statements being made and almost no suspense at play in ""Eden Lake.""

From the moment the empty-headed hoodlums show up on the remote beach to spoil a couple's vacation, siccing their Rottweiler on them, spitting everywhere, hitting one another in some caricature of skinheads in (also better) films like ""Romper Stomper"" and ""Made in Britain,"" you know Mr. Snorkler, out to prove his manliness to the lady he is about to propose to, is going to do something that draws their wrath. And when he does, the film just becomes a silly game of hide and seek -- no real surprises, just a bunch of injuries/fatalities to both teams (who didn't see it coming that the scared kid was going to get it when he showed up right after the girlfriend wrapped a shard of glass in rags?), an attempt to make one character as disgustingly unkempt as possible and at the bitter end, a big vacant stare for the camera as it closes its lens. Like father, like son, I suppose.

One thing I will say for the film, and I did give it 3 stars after all, is the antagonists thankfully never devolve into sappy, remorseful twits after their inhumane acts like in ""Mean Creek."" As is the norm with these almost-straight-to-DVD ""horror"" films, there is almost no plot, the acting is adequate, the camera work is pretty decent (when the cinematographer isn't snorting too much coke and trying to get all artsy), and the makeup is outstanding.

Believe me, it's fairly entertaining, but in about a month, you won't even remember what was so great about ""Eden Lake"" that had you thinking you were on the edge or your seat.",1258848000,,2186,4.699738903394256
3598286,4,B001G9CNI6,"The Dimension Extreme series has been a mixed bag when it comes to quality but Eden Lake is a BIG step up!  This is a film that is relentless and unapologetic in its brutality and violence.  It is made all the more unnerving because this isn't your typical exaggerated horror violence that makes audiences roar, but rather realistically visceral.  It's one of the more unsettling horror films I have seen in a long time.

Jenny and Steve have taken a holiday out to a lake in the English countryside where Steve plans to ask Jenny to marry him.  Their tranquil vacation is interrupted almost immediately by a group of six loud and obnoxious teens.  While Jenny pleads with Steve to move to another part of the lake, he instead confronts the youths and finds them to be the epitome of English hoodlums.

Insults escalate first into vandalism to their SUV, and then the theft of the vehicle when Steve makes the mistake of leaving his keys on the beach while he and Jenny go for a swim.  This is just the start of a breakneck thrill ride.  Jenny and Steve are soon on the run from the group when Steve accidentally kills Brett's, the gangs leader's dog.  Brett is an ordinary teenager but he is frankly far more terrifying than Jason Voorhees, Freddy Kreuger, or any other film boogeyman.  When you have a person who is ready to kill two people because his dog died, you know you're dealing with a true psychopath.

Brett has total control of the rest of the gang.  He uses fear and intimidation to get even the youngest boy to go along with his plot.  The viciousness comes to a head when Steve is captured and bound with barbed wire and Brett forces each of the gang to take turns cutting Steve with knives or box cutters.  All the while, he has his girlfriend record the torture on her cell phone. It's a scene that's hard to watch and yet you are enthralled by the performance by Jack O' Connell who plays Brett.  It's a remarkably chilling performance by a kid who is only 18 years old.

Kelly Reilly as Jenny also provides a fantastic performance.  You see her transformed from a schoolteacher into a killer driven over the edge by the night's events.  In one scene, she's covered in muck and mud from head to toe and looks at her reflection in some glass.  It is here when you can virtually see her mind teeter on the edge of sanity.

This was the first film directed by James Watkins who also wrote the script. and what a debut it is!  While the plot may not be original, Watkins skillfully sends it off into uncharted territory.  In films like these you normally want to see the antagonists get what's coming to them but here, they are kids, coerced into joining along by Brett.  You find yourself actually sympathizing with most of them because they are just kids (and look like it, too!) and that is where Watkins truly shined as a Director.  A brilliant horror film and one you absolutely must see!",1258588800,,2908,4.472485768500949

I won't tell you what that part is as I just don't do much of giving a plot away.  Instead, I will tell you why I might have given it a ""5"".  The movie was well-done, the actors/actresses did an extremely good job in their parts.  The good guys were good; the bad guys were bad.  The suspense was incredible and I couldn't take my eyes from the screen.  It was not a good vs. evil movie; it was more of an innocent vs. guilty movie.  The film was one in which society's woes are seen in the behavior of its children.  I have seen violent children.  I have seen children that I feel will become or already are sociopaths.  I have also seen the intensity of teenagers carry itself away to the extreme.  All of that was explored in the movie and dipicted brutally.  I will not say that there were any particular points in which the film failed.  What it meant to show you, it did, graphically and in intricate detail.  If you are a person with strong feelings of love, caring, and justice, you will not walk away from this film unscathed; in fact, it will haunt you.  A good film?  Yes.  My type of film overall?

3598289,5,B001G9CNI6,"I have to vouch for some of the other reviewers -- the survivalist horror film Eden Lake is an utterly wrenching movie, one that left me stomachachy for days, probably due to its realism. The ""Chav"" sub-culture puts American bullies to shame as these kids are virtually primal in their vengeance. The sociopathic leader was especially numbing to watch when he used his friends and, essentially, blackmailed them all into extreme acts of viciousness.

I think what makes this movie so real, and scary is the fact that you get to see the couple interact, as a normal, fun, happy, couple.  They do nothing but mind their own business, only to be terrorized by a group of kids.  That word, kids, is the second most scary part...the fact that they could do this to an innocent couple!

Without going into many details, I will say I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end, although the end was quite unexpected.  You find yourself cheering on one side of the story and at the same time trying to feel bad for the instigators, wondering what the heck is going through their minds!

(It DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS)

But that is why the movie is so heart wrenchingly sad. The ending, so frustrating, I was screaming in anguish and anger along with the female lead. The kids that did meet their demise (apart from the young boy not involved in the gang) were all in the process of changing face upon the realisation of their wrongdoing. Kelly's character may have realised this when she stabbed the little boy in the neck, otherwise she would not have sobbed and cradled him in her arms as he died. The young girl was leaving the gang, coming to her senses, and she was hit by the car. Kelly's character would not have known that the girl had changed her mind, this makes all deaths even more tragic. You can see the angst in the childrens eyes as they are forced to do unspeakable acts. Apart from the instigator and the other older boy, the kids are subjected to the worst case of peer pressue any child could face. The most frightening thing is that similar situations have, and continue to occur around the world. This is why the movie is brilliant and heartbreaking at the same time.....

I recommend this movie to all. I would have given it a 5 star rating but i truly hated the seemingly rushed and completely unsatisfying ending. Some will say the ending was dark and disturbing.

3598294,5,B001G9CNI6,"I was drawn to the film by other recommendations, and the fact that Jack O'Connell from the third series of Skins had stared in the feature.

Coming into this film on a whim, I was completley surprised and deeply thrilled by the sheer horror that this brought right onto the table. It starts off slow with the cliche couple running off into the countryside to get away from it all to only come into a town that was filled with loud-mouth pricks. Everything is silent for a few scenes, but when we get to the part where the two leads are lounging by the lake, we're greeted to a group of rowdy English chavs that come in with loud music while terrorizing a little kid seen earlier in the scene. They end up bothering the couple, and then, all hell breaks loose within fifteen minutes of running time.

What would've been a typical horror film, it turns into a very horrific deal of adolescent gangster violence set upon on just the whim for ""They f$#%ing killed my dog, even though I threatened to kill them!""

For people calling this film unrealistic, I disagree. Lot's of weirder and harsher things have happened in the world, and what's not to say that you could get overrun with a group of twats getting ready to BBQ you alive while bounding you with barb wire?

It's not a film for the faint of heart, and it will hit hard - especially by the time the end credits start to roll.

the long and short of it: an attractive 20-something couple heads off to a remote area for some relaxin' and romancin' only to have their party crashed by a bunch of loud, obnoxious, troublemaker tweens and teens. the male hero (steve) confronts the kiddies who are less than impressed. one thing leads to another and the kids steal the couples' car. the couple stumbles upon both car and kids. steve confronts the leader of the lollypop guild and during a quick scuffle, accidentally shivs the kid's doggy. uh-oh. definitely not good for the happy couple.

the remainder of the film revolves around the munchkins chasing, torturing and tormenting the couple as they try to escape and find help. well shot, edge of your seat tension with an ending you don't really expect.

my expectations for this weren't all that high because of dimension extreme's willingness to put out such a large amount of utter crap, but this movie was truly a fantastic watch. quite easily one of the best survial / horror movies out there today.",1234224000,2,1148,4.817258883248731
3598304,2,B001G9CNI6,"EDEN LAKE is skillfully shot and paced, contains some superb acting and directing, and is, as far as movies like this go, almost flawless.

Also, I couldn't stand it.

The movie starts with a young schoolteacher named Jenny ending her classes for the week.  Her students (kindies, by the looks) obey her every gesture, and look upon her with tender and unquestioning fealty.  She then leaves class, hops in a car with her boyfriend, Steve, and the two of them drive off for a romantic weekend at Eden Lake, where they encounter some of the worst kids in Britain.

Cue: pointless torture, terror, violence, and rage.

I'm no stranger to those elements in a movie, and EDEN LAKE deserves kudos for trying to make its point culturally relevant.  During the drive to the lake, Jenny and Steve listen to a radio talk show about how bad children are these days.  Is society to blame?  The schools?  The parents?  The talk show leaves these questions up to the audience.  The movie, not so much.

Written and directed by relative newcomer, James Watkins, EDEN LAKE will (and should) appeal to moviegoers of certain types.  And unlike so many of these kinds of films, this one has a powerful and intelligent ending.  But I hated it.  Hated, hated, hated it.  I haven't asked Watkins, but I have a suspicion that he intended a reaction of that variety.  At least it packs a wallop, which is more than you can say for most movies today.

But -- powerful or no -- my closing impression of the film, after an hour and a half of riveting, emotional, heartbreaking suspense, is pure, unadulterated disgust.  Again, probably the point, but it means I can't, in good conscience, recommend this movie to anyone I want to keep as a friend.  In fact, next time I want to ponder the kinds of questions this movie prompts, I'll probably just tune in to a talk radio show.",1234051200,18,1850,4.5963302752293576
3598305,4,B001G9CNI6,"I live in England so i wanted to check this movie out because the subject matter more or less reflects the news headlines at the moment. I felt that, if done right, the film would have a very realistic feel to it. For the most part, i wasn't disappointed.

The teenagers were suitably menacing and, quite scarily, you feel they didn't have to act that much! Playing their music too loud, verbally and then physically abusing the poor couple, i found myself being drawn into this taut little chiller.

The reason this film doesn't get 5 stars is simply this. There are 2 moments in the film that let it down. Not big moments mind, but segements that you really have to suspend belief.

1) After the girl makes it out of Eden Lake, she finally flags down some transport. Admittedly, in the dead of night, there wasn't going to be too many people around. But finding the only person who just happens to be a relative of one of the gang members was a tad preposterous.

2) After stealing the vehicle, she drives for what appears to miles and miles, far from Eden Lake. But then crashes the car near a house (plausible) only to find the house contains relatives of the gang. (sigh).

I certainly don't pretend that i could do better. And i did thoroughly enjoy the movie. But i think the storyline could have been a lot tighter.

In this day and age though, i find it most refreshing that films coming out of England don't just have hugh grant and corsets in it. So with that in mind, i'm totally in favour of championing the smaller budgeted films such as this one.

If you have fingernails going in, you won't coming out!

3598307,4,B001G9CNI6,"When I first saw promos for Eden Lake, I classified it as being just another torture flick that provides sadism just for the sake of sadism, with no other true horror elements thrown in at all.  Well, I was wrong, very wrong.  While Eden Lake does offer some truly brutal moments of shocking violence, it also provides an equal amount of true suspense that really will keep your eyes glued to the screen.  Kelly Reilly and Michael Fassbender star as a young couple who run afoul of a gang of murderous teens while trying to spend a romantic weekend together.  What develops is a truly frightening, shocking, and bloody fight for survival that shows writer/director James Watkins hardly pulling any punches in showing the audience.  Eden Lake's cast is surprisingly pretty solid, and Watkins' pacing is nearly pitch-perfect as well.  The only real flaws of Eden Lake lie in its screenplay, as our couple does some pretty unwise things as situations develop, and the film's finale may leave you screaming at your television.  Still, Eden Lake is a surprisingly good, and brutal, flick that is notable due to the slickness of Watkins' camera and the infusion of some great suspense, and is definitely worth checking out for horror fans that are seeking a little bit of suspense mixed with their brutality and bloody violence.",1232928000,13,1322,4.875
3598308,4,B001G9CNI6,"There have been many attempts at a genre film that emulates a very real feeling of horror that may happen in real life. I've seen quite a good number of them, some are decent, some are great but most failed to impress. Writer and director James Watkins' ""Eden Lake"" may have the usual clichs of horror suspense thrillers, the main premise offers nothing new, but what makes it very different is the fact that it carries a lot of effective humanity in its proceedings, that whatever it may lack in originality, the journey itself is rewarding--proves once again that true terror may just be out there.

Steve and Jenny (Michael Fassbender and Kelly Reilly respectively) is a couple very much in love. They decide to spend the weekend in the wilderness to have some quality time, and unknown to Jenny, Steve plans on proposing. Their time together is broken up when they ran across a group of aggressive of local kids. Rowdiness turns to rage as the teenagers terrorize the couple in unimaginable ways and the weekend outing becomes a fight for survival.

I wasn't kidding when I said that the film's set up is full of clich. At first impression, I was ready to tell myself that the film was just another thriller until I saw just how the direction slowly unfolded. Sure, there were some cheap scares and some dumb behavior in the part of the protagonists that I didn't exactly buy into in the beginning, but thankfully the script abandons the flaws. What really got me into the film is the fact that even though there is very minor character development in the beginning, you get to know Steve and Jenny through their horrific experiences. Other films such as ""Them"" and ""The Strangers"" tried but failed to make the audience ""feel"" for the characters' predicaments, to put them behind the eyes of the leads--this film does so very effectively because it carried a lot of emotional content.

The characters have their own feelings. Even the teenagers, despite their horrific deeds, aren't one-dimensional. These kids have emotions and their characteristics are displayed when they disagree, argue and have second thoughts. Brett (Jack O'Connell) is the group's leader and one may wonder as to how a young man such as this would be so without conscience. There is a subtle hint at abuse when Steve stumbled on their home and especially during the final act. The other members of the group offer some guilt and reluctance, but they were just so caught up in the moment or they were scared of Brett or for themselves.

I suppose the situation itself had driven the characters into such actions. I loved the way the director set everything up, it seemed as if unintentional reactions, dark coincidence and bad decisions enforced with rage were all the cause of the terrifying experience for Steve and Jenny. These teenagers are very angry, well, maybe two of them served as some light at the end of the tunnel, but the situation may have scared both the victims and the hunters. The film is definitely an emotional affair that I wouldn't really call this a 100% horror film, but more of a horrifying drama. There is some blood and very little gore, and it doesn't depend on those elements, but focuses more on the situation itself--which makes it more an emotional horror film, with a lot of visceral punch.

The performances are quite good, although Kelly Reilly may have stolen the show. Reilly is so convincing on the anger, fear and her reactions that I was genuinely touched by her plight. Steve's ""proposal"" adds some feeling of sympathy, but it doesn't end there. The teenagers were also very meshed together and managed to show a lot of humanity despite their unbecoming behavior, when I say humanity, I didn't mean the pleasant side--I meant the dark side.

The film's cinematography is very good and while all these things happen in a huge wooden area, it gives a feeling of claustrophobia and helplessness. The way the camera worked was quite impressive; making simple perspective views become a feeling of helplessness, close-ups to achieve emotion and pain. I was quite happy with the direction, but the film isn't perfect. The hunt seemed to have taken place in two days and there are some elements that I did find unconvincing such as when Jenny stayed put in the woods the first night instead of going for help and some scenes were a little heavy-handed.

Despite some flaws, ""Eden Lake"" does a LOT more things right than wrong. The plot while simple was an emotional roller-coaster, and I was very happy that the antagonists weren't ""cardboard"" genre characters and that they acted very human, however, brutal their actions were. The film's main strength is its humanity and the realistic approach to human terror. It also has a surprising element in the final act that is very bleak and sad (Reminded me of the South Korean thriller ""The Chaser"") and I applaud the writer in avoiding a perfunctory ending. It wasn't so much as surprising, but it just leaves a very sad and disturbing feeling behind. The film's ending is an expression of irony and pure wicked coincidental chance. Full of humanity and bleakness, ""Eden Lake"" delivers.

Highly Recommended! [4  Stars]",1232668800,17,5178,4.815523059617548
3598309,4,B001G9CNI6,"Think an English ""Deliverance"" by way of ""Kids"" / ""Bully."" Pretty harrowing stuff. Unrelentingly grim. This is one of those ""survival"" horror flicks in which our protagonist(s) must get through a series of nightmarish situations for which they are wholly unprepared. These types of films function by carefully (if they are successful, and I think this one was) building tension / releasing tension. The game for the filmmakers, and the subjective experience for the viewer(s), is in the controlled and/ or maddeningly deferred release of pent up tensions. Some films, like ""Funny Games,"" build tension and never release any of it-- but this is brutal and intuitively unsatisfying for most viewers. This film -- in textbook fashion - builds, frustrates, and releases tension in strategic ways, but at what cost? The secret is that they place the viewer in the position of having to imagine what they would do had they themselves been in that situation (and this is where the ""pleasure"" - um, perhaps the wrong word - fascination? - yeah, a little better - comes from). The ""shocks"" are derived from the ""ironies"" that occur when the characters do in fact do what the viewers secretly desire they'd do (what we imagine we'd do if we were in that situation), but with ""terrible"" consequences. We finally get a thrilled release, and then, a quick hard bitchslap. The viewer desires so badly that the protagonist(s) get some good licks in - that they'd tell off those annoying kids, that they'd ""get revenge,"" that they'd bash someone's brains out, etc -  that when they do do it, it inevitably makes matters worse and, irony of ironies, implicates the viewer in the violence and, irony of irony of ironies, ultimately links the viewer in subversive ways with the unrestrained violence of the antagonist(s). Another technique this film nicely utilizes is the, what I call, ""malevolence of inanimate objects"" type situation: this is when human made objects, particularly those objects designed to aid humanity and/ or make life easier, end up ""betraying"" the protagonist(s) by giving them away and/ or trapping them. George Romero used this beautifully a number of times in ""Dawn"" but I don't see it often enough, sadly. Add all this up with some brutal bloodiness and some chilling sociological commentary and you get one harsh dark trip into Hell. And like all good horror films, ""Eden Lake"" ultimately doesn't give the viewer what they want - it gives them what they need. See ya down by the lake.",1232236800,,2494,4.938095238095238
3598310,2,B001G9CNI6,"I was really psyched about watching this movie. All of the positive reviews on here plus an extremely vocal Blockbuster employee really got me pumped for this British horror flick.

  Unfortunatly, the movie didn't really work out that well for me.
I am a fan of horror films and like any normal fan of the genre, I embrace twists and turns and new ideas...but, Eden Lake, despite it's gorgeously filmed directing and cinematography, left me feeling anything but happy.

  Having just seen the French thriller THEM, I was not really looking forward to the child-killers angle. I feel like it's a little TOO real and disturbing for cinema. On the flipside of that though, it works because it IS such a visceral and controversial topic. No one wants to think that there children could commit such crimes, but the reality of it is that children, when left to there own devices, can come up with some pretty sick ways to have fun. Eden Lake takes that idea, throws in a gang of young teens, a perky, cute preschool teacher and her attractive fiance and an undeveloped lake property that will soon be a resort and mixes them into a torture flick that DOES entertain...but ultimately lets viewers down.

*****************spoilers below***************************

The gore: There wasn't a TON of gore as some might have mentioned. I have seen worse. The most effective scenes would be shots of a very realistic looking GAPING stab wound that is pouring blood. It looked very real and very nasty.
The torture of the main character is bad, but I have seen worse. There is also some light animal related abuse along with a fairly violent dog death. Some people have said the death of the dog was not bad...but it was actually one of the worst dog deaths I have seen on a film and it was actually pretty sad. The dog wasn't an evil, menacing dog...it was merely the main bullies pet and had a slight barking issue...when the dog ended up stabbed it was an accident and there is some dog crying and yelping that lasts for a bit and we see a few shots of it lying on the ground breating slowly with it's eyes open as the boy yells ""she's dying!"" over and over again...which was very dramatic and upsetting to me, being an animal lover with dogs of my own. So, that said, fair warning to any people who can't watch dogs or pets killed on film. This wouldn't be a good one to see because of that scene.

  Overall: While I understand the familiarity of killing off every single main character, I felt robbed at the end of this film. Jenny went through so much hell, she was tortured more mentally than anyone would want to go through. Having to kill children to survive was something she had to do to fight and live...but, the ending of this film LITERALLY left me in tears. The raw emotional pull on your heart as you realize what is about to happen to her, after everything she had been through, was devestating. I actually stood up and paced in front of my tv, shaking my head in disbelief. I was highly upset. The injustice of the ending along with the survival of the ""HEAD BULLY""  (who I just wanted to get killed the whole time!!!) was enough for me to want to never see this film again as long as I live.

  Very upsetting, very disturbing and WAY too much of an emotional rollercoaster for my taste. I don't want to watch a horror movie that makes me want to cry and scream at my tv about injustice and things not being fair. I also don't want to come off as ignorant by playing the ""i wish it had a happy ending"" route. What horror movie TRULY has a happy ending? People have been slashed and killed, so is there really going to be a HAPPY ending? Doesn't make much sense. But, I do like a film that at least has a SURVIVOR. No survivor usually equals a waste of time to me in the long run.

  So, this film just didn't work for me. I never want to see it again and can only really recommend it to people who can handle truly unhappy endings.",1232236800,7,3938,4.423236514522822

3598312,5,B001G9CNI6,"""Eden Lake"" is another fine offering from Dimension Extreme.
Perhaps the best .It's a survival revenge flick that is pretty realistic.
The acting is first rate as well as the camera work and cinematography.

A couple goes to Eden Lake for some romance and relaxation plus the lead male character thinks it will be the perfect place to propose to his girlfriend,ring in tow.
What they don't expect to find is a group of wild out of control kids with major anger issues.

In my opinion if the lead character had a little less testosterone and would have left well enough alone everything would have been ok.
But alas no,he provokes the kids and it only fuels the fire.
What you will see is a realistic game of trading insults and once accidents happen it's gone too far then a brutal battle for survival insures because you get into the ""after what we did we can't let them live issue"".

It has issues dealing with peer pressure,guilt,how young minds become warped, revenge,vigilantism and then after all is said and done you wonder to yourself.
Who should have stopped this first and at what price?

8304531,1,B001G9CNI6,"I wanted this idiot couple to die by the middle of the movie. They stick around while a gang of hoodlums take over the beach at the plain, run-of-the-mill lake that they traveled two days to get to. Boy, they sure showed them. They weren't going to let those pesky kids run them off. Their romantic day at the beach ends with a slashed tire.

After a chance meeting with the hoodlums' mum at the cafe where she surely spit all over their food, they just happen to see the boys' bicycles as they're driving past a house. Their plan? Teach those naughty kids a lesson by breaking in to their angry alcoholic dad's house and, what...?. Wagging a finger at them? That's your plan?

Eh. Let's go back to that very same beach and go for a swim. Wait...where's our beach bag? And our car keys?

Die. Quickly.

Oh look! There those hoodlums are again, hoodlumming in the huge woods! Such a fortuitous meeting! Let's go confront them and get our car keys! That seems like a good idea. Oopsie. Boyfriend kills the head hoodlum's beloved devil dog while girlfriend finds the keys. The moron wrecks the car (of course) and gets trapped inside. The chick gets away, free and clear in the middle of the night, then goes who knows where for hours, WITH A CELL PHONE, to hide...instead of running for help.

She just happens to stumble upon her boyfriend getting the fire beat and cut out of him in the vast woods, and what does she do? Sits there and cries, gasps and watches. Suddenly she realizes she has a fully-charged cellphone, right there in her hands! So five minutes in to watching her boyfriend being tortured, making as much noise as she can possibly muster, she decides to call for help - right where they could hear her. Why she doesn't think to use the phone prior to now, we'll never know.

Boyfriend breaks free and makes it to the car, where he sets off the alarm (of course) looking for the first aid kit. (Because some Band Aids are exactly what you're going to need for those  gushing stab wounds, and while you're running from the hoodlums, you're going to have time to stop and spray on a little Bactine.)

The rest of the movie is filled with the scantily-clad chick tripping and falling through the woods, screaming, gasping and generally making a loud ruckus so that everyone within a mile radius can find her. But the good news is, these are apparently the kind of woods where you randomly run into everyone - even that friendless video-game-playing nerd who will do anything to be part of the gang that bullies him.

Chick runs again, then runs into yet ANOTHER person connected to the hoodlums! What a coincidence, they're everywhere! In her first intelligent move of the entire movie, she takes off with the dude's car. Guess what? SHE WRECKS IT, of course. And guess WHERE she wrecks it? At a party filled with friends of the...you guessed it! The hoodlums! What a small world!

When she realizes her incredible dumb luck, she takes some time in the loo to wash her face, sits around breathing and crying, then waits with a razor for the hoodlum family to break in and kill her. Once they kick down the door, what does she do with the razor? Slaps the alcoholic dad with it! She SLAPS him with it! Nyeh! Take that!

SPOILER ALERT!!!!! And then she dies. The movie would've been so much better if she'd have died about an hour earlier.
