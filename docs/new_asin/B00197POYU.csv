8272280,4,B00197POYU,"This video is an informative look at the life of a very talented writer and illustrator of children's books.  The life story is touching and inspiring and the filmmaker gives the viewer a good look at the books themselves.  This DVD is well worth owning by anyone interested in the life of an artist as well as by fans of the work of Virginia Lee Burton.  Librarians, buy this!  Artists and readers of children's books, view this!
I bought this on Amazon, sight unseen, as a lover of Virginia Lee Burton's books and I'm so glad I did. Highly recommended!",1265155200,4,554,4.51
8272281,4,B00197POYU,"Fascinating PBS documentary about a woman who created art and books for kids that have been popular for almost 75 years. I learned so much more about a real role model for me than I had ever dreamed I would from the dvd. Her relatively short life was exemplary for other artists - she incorporated art into every facet of her home, family, and social circle. As a leader and member of the Folly Cove Designers she managed to inspire, encourage and mentor a slew of area artists. She was even an environmentalist back when we didn't call it that. Everyone who remembers her speaks so highly of her! The dvd showcases vintage photos of Virginia and her sister as dancers, dozens of sketchbook pages, interviews with her sons and others who knew her, excerpts from talks she gave, and of course, all of her books.
The only reason I didn't go all out for the 5 stars was because the production quality was not the greatest, and the score was kinda cheesy. The content was so intriguing those were minor issues.",1238457600,7,1006,4.532967032967033
