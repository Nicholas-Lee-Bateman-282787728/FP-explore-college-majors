7975257,5,B00007CVTO,"Volume 12 in the ""As Time Goes By"" videotape series of the charming BBC comedy provides the second half of Series 5 and the continuing story of Jean (Judy Dench) and Lionel (Geoffrey Palmer), who are now happily married and trying to enjoy living in the country at their weekend estate:
Episode 4 has Lionel and Jean returning to the country at 3 in the morning trying to avoid having the local crowd, but you know what sort of luck has afflicted this couple.  Mrs. Bale (Janet Henfrey) tries to make them feel at home, but when she shows up with their injured gardner, Lol Ferris (Tim Wylton), it is clear there is something rather serious going on.  Lol claims he fell down, but Jean insists he has been in a fight.
Episode 5 tells of the fateful day when the American mini-series based on Lionel and Jean's love story finally airs.  The couple beg off on the offer from Alistair (Philip Bretherton) to hop on the Concorde to go to New York City to watch the show and enjoy the festivities, but Judy (Moira Brooker) and Sandy (Jenny Funnell) go along.  Meanwhile, Lionel and Jean cannot sleep holding out hoping that the news from the Colonies will be good.
Episode 6 finds Penny (Moyra Fraser) facing surgery and pronouncing dire predictions of her demise.  This means that Lionel not only has to comfort Stephen (Paul Chapman), but prepare him for life as a bachelor.  Fortunately Alistair is there to help relieve the anxiety (""Ummmm"").
Episode 7 finds Jean and Lionel returning to their country home to find that the other half of the village know loves them because of what happened at the infamous barbaque with the ""Country Set.""  Apparently Rocky (Frank Middlemass) and Madge (Joan Sims) have been embellishing the tell so that it now has Lionel pitching a couple of that lot over the hedge.  The episode also introduces the one thing missing from the live of the Hardcastles: a pet (named Roland).
There are a couple of episodes on this tape that are slightly more serious than we are used to from ""As Time Goes By,"" but you will certainly hear no complaints at this end on that score.  More importantly, the light bulb we have been patiently waiting for to go off in Alistair's head apparently has finally done so.  Now if they would just release Series 6 (out of 9) on videotape we can hopefully move on to another joyous occassion and then we will just have Sandy to marry off.",1050969600,42,2391,4.578454332552694
7975258,5,B00007CVTO,"""As Time Goes By"" is the gentle, funny story of Jean Pargetter and Lionel Hardcastle, two people who used to be in love in the early fifties. When Lionel went off to fight in the Korean War, the two lost touch. They meet again 38 years later, quite by accident, and what is at first an awkward friendship slowly morphs into a warm romance.
Series 5 of ""As Time Goes By"", originally produced and aired in 1997, finds the show taking a slightly new direction, all the while retaining the warmth and charm that made it a favorite in the first place. A new set of characters are introduced, old regulars return, and a semi-new locale becomes more of a focal point. All of this comes together splendidly to bring us a fresh, funny, and delightful new series of episodes.
This video (the second, and last, part of series 5 on VHS) features a quick trip to the United States, a health scare, and one of the most cozy visits to a pub that I can remember. Jean & Lionel's love story was filmed as an American mini-series, and in one of the episodes on this tape, Sandy, Judith, and Alistair all fly to America to watch the premiere. In another episode, Jean's sister-in-law Penny thinks that she is dying. And the last episode of series 5 has a visit to Jean & Lionel's house in the country. They go to the local pub, and Madge (Lionel's step-mother) gives an absolutely charming rendition of ""Tie a Yellow Ribbon 'Round the Old Oak Tree"". Truly sweet.
""As Time Goes By"" was an endearing sitcom on British television for ten years. View this tape, and you'll see why. It is charming, warm, and humorous, all rolled in to one. If you haven't already gotten to know this series, then this is most certainly a great place to start.",1041120000,23,1719,4.443037974683544
