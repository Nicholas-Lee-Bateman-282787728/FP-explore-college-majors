It was a typical 80's style teen movie w some skin and affairs. Both fathers take their daughters to Rio where sexual chaos ensues.

The only lasting impact from this movie is that this is where Demi Moores career starts. With Valerie Harper Michael Caine and Joseph Bologna involved it doesn't suffer from talent but the actors couldn't save this movie.

The real promblem in my opinion is that there really aren't any sympathetic or likeable characters in the whole movie. Only on person is responsible at all. Let you discover who that is.

This is basically a teen movie w skin so if your looking for a movie like that that isn't really serious then here you are.",1489795200,,882,4.425925925925926
