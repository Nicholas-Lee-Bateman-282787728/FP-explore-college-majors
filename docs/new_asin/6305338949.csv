Also, I ordered this on Dec. 20th and even tho the sender had from 10-14 days to deliver it, it arrived on Christmas Eve, Dec. 24th!!!! My son, who believes in Santa Claus, received this under the tree on Christmas morning as a gift from Santa!!!!",1295308800,,484,4.563218390804598
7888341,5,6305338949,"The Michael Jordan Ultimate Collection is an entertaining and informative recollection of Michael Jordan's career and how it has affected his life.  I think it helps that each of the videos was released at a different time.  One is from 1989, another 1993, and the last 1996, illustrating his growth and ensuring thorough coverage of every year.  In all the videos, there is a wonderful balance of highlights, family life for Mike, his economic impact, and of course, a detailed retelling of each season.  For me, the best parts of the set were the intense segments on the playoffs (which made me wish I was born earlier so I could have seen them) and Michael's narration in Air Time.  I also liked how they put in highlights throughout each video to make sure the viewer was fully interested.  The Ultimate Collection helped me to see MJ better as player and a person, and the conflict and success during his career.  For any fellow MJ fans, or anyone who likes basketball, buy the set: it is the BEST documentary on the BEST athlete ever.",979862400,,1040,4.6502732240437155
7888342,5,6305338949,If you like basketball you MUST have this video collection. The first one has the best Jordan dunks and his first years in the NBA. In the second you'll see how he made his game better and how he won his first threepeat. In the last one you can watch him when he decided to retire and then come back. Is the perfect trilogy. You can't miss it !!,970704000,6,345,4.0144927536231885
