3853844,5,B0026IQTQI,"The product description actually hits every aspect of what this film is about, so that left performances and product quality for me. From the opening scene of Kiera Knightley singing (BEAUTIFULLY in her own voice and with the first of many facial close-ups) I was hooked.

The picture clarity and DTS were the best I have seen and heard for a movie of this theme/topic. Everything about the techinical aspects of the film was superb. I kept trying to find fault, even with the night shots and the dark almost black and white London sequences, but nothing would falter. The DTS was mixed perfectly throughout, even in the rain sequences and the remote bombings. Which, if you have your system cranked up thinking this is a dialogue film only, at around 16:20 you will end up blown over backwards, and that happens several times.

The main featurette is also 1080 and lasts nine minutes. It is mostly footage from the film as narrated by the main cast and director (except Cillian). Once you see the humor involved in the background of the film it can prep you for the outtakes. I thought this option would be misplaced for as serious as this film is, but after watching the four minute quip (mixed as a music video almost) it was actually perfect. It showed the disgust of everyone having to chain smoke through the whole film. And Kiera with as beautiful as she is here in every moment of film, is captured saying the F word in only the way she can.

I feel comfortable in saying no one should find disappointment in any aspect of this production, story, poetry, Blu quality, sound mix, or even the brief special features. I have played several sequences of Kiera singing for customers, and the Blu clarity has sold itself on those scenes alone.

EDIT: I have noticed there are a slew of haters out there with this film that try to find everything wrong with it. Kiera's mother wrote this piece and I think she made it believable being that these characters are based on a ""bohemian"" lifestyle. Kiera's singing sounded wonderful, contrary to some critics thinking it stunk. In summary, I do not think this film deserves all of the slander. Hope you enjoy it.",1247270400,43,2158,4.6266318537859

Matthew Rhys does a terrific job as Dylan and portrays a man extremely selfish and forever drinking. Keira always does a wonderful job in her portrayals, and I'd never seen Sienna Miller before in any part and she does one heck of a job playing a role that showed just how much Dylan's wife had to deal with.

3853856,1,B0026IQTQI,"What a disappointment! Dylan Thomas was perhaps the greatest of Welsh poets and should be remembered for his work.  A fabulous film could have been produced, based on a true biographical account of his colorful life.  Instead, we have a highly-fictionalized film, centering around a fictionalized story of two silly women.

3853868,4,B0026IQTQI,"I found it pleasantly surprising that Vera's faithfulness to her husband William, stood strong in many parts; much more than any woman nowadays can endure.  She also cared for Kaitlin enough not to let her feelings get in the way of friendship.  Sadly, there's always that ONE time in which everything turns blurry, and you let your senses over power your beliefs.

The movie is missing a star, due to not making many things clear.  Including the infidelity of both Kaitlin and Dylan at first.  I was under the impression they were relaxed, outgoing and open minded people who were sadly poor.  If you are not familiar with the real life characters, the fact that there are infidelities going on in the movie just flies inadvertently until you actually see them having sex (very artistically not loud at all).

I think the director took it for granted that viewers would be familiar with the life stories of Caitlin Macnamara and Dylan Thomas, so certain things might appear confusing at first.",1335312000,,994,4.811764705882353

3853872,4,B0026IQTQI,"In this somewhat sleeper drama of 2008 starring Keira Knightley, Matthew Rhys, and Sienna Miller, The Edge of Love depicts the friendship of legendary poet Dylan Thomas between his teenage sweetheart and lounge singer Vera Phillips (Knightley) and wife Caitlin MacNamara (Miller).  The film takes place in England and off the coast of Wales during World War II and shows the damaging effects of war on the fragile and sensitive, especially for those within the frontlines, Vera's husband William Killick (Cillian Murphy) and those waiting in the wings at home.

The movie centers on several themes, war, love, romance, and friendship that weaves elements of Thomas's life into a ball of fiction and nonfiction that is based on the book by David N. Thomas Dylan Thomas:  A Farm, Two Mansions and a Bungalow that shows how the presumed long passed emotions between Vera and Dylan never quite went away and would eventually affect Dylan's marriage to Caitlin.  Director John Maybury does an extremely exceptional job when presenting this aspect of Thomas's life and the vicious love triangle and the downward spiral that arises between the characters.  Indeed, those scenes as well as one of the interesting parts of the film between Vera and Caitlin that show an inkling of a friendship that almost blooms but leads to misunderstandings, betrayal, and the eventual truth behind Thomas's carousing, emphasize the complexities of the life he lived.

The Edge of Love may appeal to Knightley fans and viewers who enjoy a period piece.  Although the film starts slow in the beginning, it gradually builds by the conclusion with its subtle ironic ending.",1283558400,2,1647,5.100371747211896
3853873,3,B0026IQTQI,"Larger-than-life literary lion Dylan Thomas is brought down to  tarnished human size here, wonderfully embodied by the adorable Matthew Rhys.  Thomas wrote soaring, transcendent poetry, but the man himself was a s---.  Thomas is more of a supporting player in this snapshot of a period in his life and career; the focus is firmly upon the two women that knew the real Dylan Thomas best: his wife, Caitlyn (Sienna Miller) and the childhood sweetheart recaptured by his roving eye, Vera (Kiera Knightley).  Dylan reconnects with his old flame, now a rising nightclub singer at a pub in London.  He fails to mention that he is now married and a father.  After the two women meet, rather than being antagonistic toward each other, they forge an unlikely bond of sisterhood based on the mutual knowledge that Dylan is really only capable of loving himself.  Vera marries an ardent soldier (Cillian Murphy) who will inevitably suffer from being the odd man out in this odd menage a trois.  Art is a selfish mistress and artists are the most selfish of partners.  Hardly a new theme, but very apt in Thomas' case.  He gave us some great poetry but succeeded in making everyone around him miserable before his untimely death.  This highly stylized film is a visual feast, successfully capturing wartime London and the cloud-lashed Welsh seaside, but parts of it grind along very slowly.  Both Knightley and Miller look smashing in period garb and their dark-light dynamic is striking.  At various points in the script you want to shake all of our principals for being so self-centered and clueless, but that's Art for ya.  I'd call this a must-see for students of Thomas; some familiarity with the man and his mystique is useful for putting this movie into context.  You will come away marvelling that the man who gave us some of the timeless lyrical treasures of the English language lived a life that was so petty, dissolute and tawdry, but you pity even more the extraordinary women who wasted their love on such an undeserving object.",1276560000,10,2030,4.843478260869565

3853876,5,B0026IQTQI,"This is a good movie, the execution, music and the photography are great.  But it seems to me that the story is strange, unrealistic.  I think what makes this film worth seeing is the evolution of Vera,  because life and reality force her to grow up and get real.  Meanwhile Dylan still pines for his childhood sweetheart and doesn't want to grow up and eventually betrays Vera.  This film shows the importance of being kind to others, but at the same time,  we also have to be very smart and set boundries and limits that protect us.",1263945600,5,534,4.453608247422681
3853877,3,B0026IQTQI,"The Edge of Love, a film about the poet Dylan Thomas and the two woman in his life, is one of those pretty films whose plot slips from your mind once the credits begin to role.  The film focus on the relationship which springs up between Dylan Thomas' wife Caitlin, (Sierra Miller) and his first lover Vera, (Keira Knightley) as they deal with the jerkiness which is Dylan and the gruesomeness of London during World War II, air raids and all.  Essentially, Vera is a singer who runs into Dylan at an air raid safe zone.  From the get go there is flirtatious banter between the two of them, which is cut short upon the arrival of Dylan's wife, Caitlin.  Caitlin and Dylan, hard on their luck, end up staying with Vera, who is struggling (sometimes unsuccessfully) to keep the sexual tension between herself and Dylan to a minimum while beginning a friendship with the high-spirited, insecure Caitlin.  Things get jumbled even further when Vera meets a handsome soldier, who she eventually marries, and who is (rightfully) alarmed by the extra-friendly relationship between Dylan and Vera.  The film focus on their time spent together first in London, and then in Wales, and is full of gorgeous scenery, clothing, and interesting/artful camera images.

The film is at its best in the scenes where Caitlin and Vera are together; both beautiful, strong actresses in their own right, they play of each other and the sisterly relationship between them is palatable.  Keira Knightley is right in her element as the strong, smart woman caught up in two tumultuous relationships, and Sienna is particularly strong as the vulnerable, passionate wife of a rather selfish poet. As we see these two actors interact with each other, the movie turns into an interesting observation on how woman are often forced to give up on their relationships with each other for the men and children in their lives.  To be honest, all of the acting in this movie is moving and emotional-every single member of the casts turns out strong performances.  The mistake more or less lies in the cinetomography of the film, which serves to distract and confuse, rather than aid the film.  Multiple close ups, scenes filtered through screens, long stretches of eyes looking longly into the camera and the cliche war montage (as Vera's husband goes to war) serves only to distract from the plot, and confuse the audience so much  that you forget what is happening.

Which is kind of unfortunate, considering that... to be honest not that much actually happens.  IN fact, most of the meaty part to the action occurs in the 1/3 and the last third of the movie, leaving the middle stretch a long, confusing mix of odd camera angles and breathless looks.  It's a shame because the movie had the potential to be great-it had the actors, it had the story-line, it had the clothes and the scenery.  Yet somehow if falls flat.... and becomes oddly forgettable.

2.5 stars-  renting material if drama period pieces are your thing",1263686400,2,2984,4.817647058823529
3853878,3,B0026IQTQI,"Loosely based on the wartime experiences of legendary Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, John Maybury's ""The Edge of Love"" is visually breathtaking, capturing the claustrophobic intensity of London during the Blitz, as opposed to the serenity of Thomas' Welsh seacoast home, with an artist's eye; but as drama, the story tends to drift, particularly during the rather melodramatic 'third act', despite vivid performances by Keira Knightley (who can sing!) and Sienna Miller. Ultimately, the film is an engrossing misfire, worth viewing, but lacking a cohesive core.

Thomas (as portrayed by Matthew Rhys), is a moody, brilliant, but childish artist, full of passion, but unable to see beyond his own desires. When his childhood lover, Vera Phillips (Knightley) appears in London to pursue a career as an entertainer, he begins a campaign to bed her, and relive his past...which doesn't sit well with his beautiful, tempestuous wife, Caitlin (Miller). While both Thomases have relaxed mores about infidelity (despite their intense jealousy), Caitlin and Vera soon discover, through their mutual love of Dylan, a bond that turns the situation into a playful, non-sexual mnage--trois. When young soldier William Killick (Cillian Murphy) falls for Vera, however, the chemistry changes, as she matures, and learns to accept 'adult' love and responsibility. Killick is posted in war-torn Greece, Vera moves to Wales with the Thomases (and soon has Killick's child), but Dylan's unabated, selfish desire for Vera untimately leads to tragedy for both couples.

It is actually a standard formula for drama, and plays out with few surprises. Still, Keightley is luminous, Miller is fiery and sympathetic, and the actresses succeed in keeping your interest, even when the story falters.

The Special Features include Commentary, a 'Making Of' featurette, and a very funny gag reel (watch how difficult it is for non-smoking actors to convincingly portray WWII chain-smokers!)

If you are a fan of Keira Knightley, I can highly recommend ""The Edge of Love""; for all others, it is a mixed blessing!",1255305600,14,2075,5.355828220858895

I also like the visual colors in the film a lot. Some of the shots almost look like paintings. On blu-ray, the really colors stand out.

Just to note: I'm not really sure what the film has to do with World War II. The war only plays a tangential role in the movie - this is primarily a love story. It's still worth viewing, but I just wouldn't want anybody to think it's primarily a war film.",1252627200,4,807,5.5
3853881,3,B0026IQTQI,"The Edge of Love: a bohemian love story.  This film is all about love and war, but I think it proves that in real life, friendship conquers all as well.

The beautiful cinematography captivated me.  The stunning colors and rich, lush images were just beautiful, no matter the setting: the bombings, Vera's apartment, war scenes, or quaint Wales.  The acting was well done.  Sienna Miller and Keira Knightley are wonderful as the free-spirited, yet troubled women. (Side note: Could you have imagined this film with Lindsey Lohan instead of Miller? Yikes!)  Cillian Murphy is romantic and dynamic.  I slowly began to loath Matthew Rhys for his convincing portrayal of the enigmatic and truly self absorbed artist Dylan Thomas.

My main gripe, the reason I cannot give another star, is because the female relationship here is so diluted.  A montage of ""fun times together"" does not count as substance.  I wanted to understand the unusual friendship between these two women, and instead, I felt like this was thrown aside for the suspense of will there be an affair and if so, who will get hurt?  There are a handful of scenes, but I still just think the story line lacked friendship.  Cillian Murphy stole the show for me, as I think he is the best actor of this bunch, which is unfortunate given his miniscule screen time compared to the other stars.  So many details and too many things going on throughout the film made the film difficult to follow; although I thought the ending really wrapped up the story nicely.",1251849600,2,1516,4.7846153846153845

It is multidimensional.  It examines the friendship and love between two ladies and their respective husbands.  It looks at the effects of the World War on British Society.  It deeply sups the well of the conflict between literature and art and practice and conflict.

This is a movie that you could watch time and time again and get new insights in every viewing.

At first, I thought that it was a story about the poet who was selected to aid the British war effort by writing poetry.  He came off as a not so nice guy, and you were kind of expecting that during the film he would grow and change and become a better person.

*beware spoilers follow*

OK, that was not the case.

Why not?

Because, he is not the main character or the main point in the film.

The two ladies, his wife and his paramour, are the main characters.  Their relationship is critical to the film, and both of them do grow.

Some so called ""chick flicks"" are really romances that anyone can enjoy.

This is a chick flick, because many men will have a hard time relating to the male characters.  The strong characters are really the ladies.

The men are foils to make the excellent points in the film.

This is a good escape movie when you want to look at pretty scenery and people. But the sum does not add up to its parts. The  ""menage a trois"" is not much of a menage.

Neither the women's friendship nor the ""triangle"" are passionate or deep enough to earn any of the angst that follows.  Matthew Rhys is a fine actor but he lacks the screen presence to go up against the mesmerizing Cillian Murphy. It was hard to believe that Keira's character would be torn between a drunken brute of middling charisma and this sweet, impossibly beautiful soldier. Perhaps the problem wasn't with the actors, but because the script never gave me a good reason to believe why Kiera's character was passionate about Thomas in the first place.  These are all good actors--Sienna was especially good,  and Rhys was a convincing Dylan Thomas. But ho hum---why do I care about these shallow, self-absorbed people and their privileged problems? The exception to this was Murphy's soldier. He is always a level above even the best actors, and he always manages to break your heart. (In ""Inception,"" he had the least amount of screen time, but his scene is the one that made everyone cry.) He gives this movie what little heart it has, and for his performance alone, I give it four stars. It's enjoyable for what it is--a nice escape on a rainy afternoon into another time and place, where the people are pretty. But it's not as great as it could have been.",1458432000,3,1705,4.67

Apparently historically accurate in almost every aspect, and not really ficitionalized, except for, as Caitlin said in her biography, the two of them drank a HELLUVA lot more booze than in the movie. Like other viewers (and the actors?), we were disgusted by the continual SMOKING by everyone  in the movie, except the infants (well, they got the 2nd hand smoke). worthwhile? sure, and a pretty good. accurate intro to the poet Dylan Thomas, both as an artist and a person. at least well-known influential songwriter named himself after this guy.",1442102400,,784,5.077519379844961

8352706,3,B0026IQTQI,"While the acting was superb, especially Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller, I had trouble with the characters being so openly unintelligent. I guess this was a true story, but for the life of me I can't see what was so good about Dylan Thomas. His poetry sucked, to put it mildly.",1430179200,,279,4.490196078431373
