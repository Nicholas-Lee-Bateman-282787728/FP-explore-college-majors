8152470,1,B000JMK6TY,"A dreadful movie. Does have English subtitles, but little is said worth mentioning. A sad story about Polish potato farmers with pathetically low intelligence. They play in the mud and then fling it at each other. P.S.  PoleArt (Who apparently are responsible for the marketing of this this movie) keep e-mailing me and asking that I remove my negative review from Amazon. Sorry guys, but even my boyfriend from Prague was horrified by this crude slander of the people of Poland.",1450396800,,479,4.91358024691358

8152473,3,B000JMK6TY,"This film was not exactly uplifting. It depicts village life in a very harsh way. Mostly people were relating to each other by arguing. Everyone seemed burdened by life. It was a picture of poverty and limitation and showed how getting drunk and having sex were about the only escape. Praying was a third, less favorite way. Religion in general was a double-edge sword. The film was told from a man's point of view. Maciej and Antek act. The women sort of just react. If I were to remake this film, though I am not a film maker, I would make Antek's wife the main character. She seems to be the strongest person in the story. The others all have tragic flaws - unbridled passion, unbridled fear, unbridled greed - or in the case of Jagna, she is too outstanding for her own good. You get the message that it is better to keep a low profile. That very closed in type of society is pretty intense. Every fault gets magnified and circulated and amplified. I suspect the good things too were magnified, circulated and amplified, but they were not the subject of this film. The task of creating a useable (inspiring) past for the Polish peasant in film remains to be accomplished. Maybe there is a film out there I don't know about. Until then, the closest I can think of is Fidler of the Roof, from the Jewish point of view. The Polish point of view is not really represented in America yet. But that could change and someday I think it will.",1397001600,,1438,4.430188679245283
8152474,5,B000JMK6TY,"Can't really comment on this dvd as it was a present for a friend from Poland who I know read the book. She did indicate she enjoyed it very much. I selected it because it was written by Wladyslaw Reymont, a very famous Polish writer who had won the Noble prize in literature (as so many other Poles had). Only wish I knew the language fluently enough to read the book and view the dvd. As a non-pole I been to Poland many times and know how ingrained good literature is with them. Happy Amazon offered this or otherwise would not have known of its existence.",1360800000,3,559,4.283018867924528
