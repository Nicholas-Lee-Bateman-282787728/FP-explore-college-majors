7846468,5,6303434010,"Very amusing Cinderella, brainchild of Rudolf Nureyev (choreography) and Patrika Ionescu (set designs).  This was made when Nureyev was director of Paris Opera Ballet, and the lead dancers are some of his favorites, most of whom went on to major careers as principal dancers and/or directors of other ballet companies.  Setting this in a fantasy Hollywood of the 1930's was originally Ionescu's idea, I believe, but Nureyev did embrace it after he recovered from his initial shock.  I get a kick out of seeing Rudolf with a big cigar stuck in his mouth, parading around as the Movie Producer.  Charles Jude plays The Film Star, and Sylvie Guillem is Cinderella.  Guillem has been considered one of the best ballerinas in the world for many years now, and Jude has been artistic director at the Bordeaux opera ballet.  It's so different and entertaining, you wonder why it isn't more well known.  I own two copies of it just because they are so hard to find. I'm afraid one day a tape will break, so I have a backup.",1299456000,,1015,4.700564971751413
