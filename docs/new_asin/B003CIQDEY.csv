8394258,3,B003CIQDEY,"I am spiritual and I am very curious about the ideas of quantum physics, but I've seen better videos on this subject. I got bored and never finished watching it.",1369526400,,161,4.4
8394259,5,B003CIQDEY,"Gave it 5 stars for content. I have watched this video 6 times and I am still learning more each time. Quality could be better though jumps around on different aspects of a subject a little too much. Sound quality isn't good in the sense that some interviews are louder than others so you have to keep raising and lowereing the volumn. Prompter reading is distracting also. Maybe they will take some of the profits from this video to better the quality of their next, which I will be first in line to buy.",1336348800,,505,4.382978723404255
8394260,5,B003CIQDEY,"This DVD is a series of talks/explanations of current scientific theories and attitudes based in physics and quantum physics that relate to our everyday lives and spiritual pursuits. AQL is essentially a movie like The Secret and What the Bleep taken a step (or many steps) further. The experience alone of seeing these ideas expressed and explained help foster the ability to put them to use in our daily lives.  The speakers give very skilled and compelling explanations and points of view on many topics that are popular in the metaphysical, holistic and scientific communities today.

The only drawbacks of the video are the production quality - which is o.k. but not bad, and the segments from Chad Cameron who is obviously reading a script during each of his segments, although to his defense the subject matter is heavy duty and difficult for most to wrap their heads around. Having said that, if you are into any type of current metaphysical teachings and the science behind them, then you will enjoy this video. This DVD would make a great addition to any home spiritual video collection.  5 Stars based on content.

8394261,5,B003CIQDEY,"Chad Cameron and Ike Allen are the makers and producers of both ""Leap: the Movie"" and ""A Quantum Leap"". I love both these films and will purchase everything they make in the future. Thanks guys for your work. It's inspirational!

If you wish to blow open your World, get this movie.",1271635200,11,282,4.529411764705882
8394262,5,B003CIQDEY,"Last night I had the pleasure of viewing the movie ""A Quantum Leap"" from friends Chad Cameron and Ike Allen. Although, I'm not the seasoned spiritual science geek, I highly recommend the movie for perfectly supporting our willingness to see more than what the eye presents. Quantum awareness is the call to see beyond our own limits, which is always a gift. Similar to ""What The Bleep"" this movie can surely reinforce the call to release perception and sink more deeply into the Fact of the Heart.  Thanks Chad and Ike for continuing the call to awakening!",1270512000,14,556,4.731958762886598
8394263,5,B003CIQDEY,"What I love about A Quantum Leap is that for me it reinforces what I already  believe.  It enhances and supports my paradigm. Having said that, it is also a wonderful gateway into a new way of thinking and seeing your world. This is not a movie that is limited to novice or expert.  It is a valuable resource for all!!

8394264,5,B003CIQDEY,"Who would have believed that scientists could make it all so simple? Watching this movie with a friend or two will open up some of the most exciting conversations and experiences you have ever shared. Suddenly the answers are clear about ""why this or that,"" and how so many different teachers followed the same common thread. This one won't collect dust on your video library shelf. You will want to watch it over and over again. Outstanding work!

8394265,5,B003CIQDEY,"I have had a general interest in quantum physics for a quite some time, and while I find it fascinating I also find it hard to truly digest. AQL was not only very interesting, but fun and inspiring! The interviews were engaging and the flow allowed me to take in a great deal of information in a short amount of time. I would recommend this video to everyone no matter what level of understanding or where you are on your path. There is something for everyone! Enjoy!
