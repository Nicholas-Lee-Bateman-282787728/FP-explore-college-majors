6555785,1,B00M4A93NY,"My hopes were quite high for this movie. I had assumed it would be similar to my old favorite ET. As so many reviewers have suggested it was similar too. Yet, I don't find the similarity, in regards to production value, acting talent or where one holds wonderment after the movie has ended.

With this said; Echo, basically is a series of (rough) footage, taken as if coming directly from an unexperienced camcorder user. Where there are a few instances of grand production value. The acting is extremely poor. They should have recut many of the scenes as the emotional value just wasn't transferable to the viewer. The story line was choppy, where some scenes made absolutely no sense. My favorite part of the movie was the last 3 minutes, as it held the best production value, minus the acting.

I also highly advice that anyone susceptible to motion sickness not watch this movie. You have been warned!",1412812800,4,905,4.7215189873417724

6555789,3,B00M4A93NY,"Filmed in found footage style, EARTH TO ECHO is the story of a group of best friends who spend one last night together before they all move away: the homeowners in their Nevada subdivision are being bought out by the builders of a new Interstate (although the Interstate doesnt appear to go anywhere or connect with anything) and they will soon all be moving to different parts of the country. Tuck (Astro Bradley) is a techie who is constantly filming his life. Not too long before their last night together the kids figure out that a glitch in the cell phone network is actually a signal of some sort and decide they will spend their last night together investigating the source. This leads them about 20 miles into the desert where they discover a small robotic alien that they name Echo. Echo wants to get home and needs to repair his ship, but hes very weak. After some debate, the boys decide to help him. Thus begins their long journey into the most memorable night of their lives.

EARTH TO ECHO is a very family friendly movie. The language is fairly clean (there are a few mild swears), there is no nudity, and no real violence. The main message is about the importance of friendship and keeping true to ones word.

Despite the good things going for it, EARTH TO ECHO suffers to find its own voice. The movie has heavy undertones of a few 1980s movies, such as E.T. and THE GOONIES (even Echo seems to have been inspired by Bupo from CLASH OF THE TITANS) and never rises above those references to really become something original. Instead, it just feels like a heavily referenced re-tread.

Also, even though Echo is the title character, Echo isn't seen in EARTH TO ECHO very much. The first half of the movie hes not even on screen, but even after his character is introduced, he spends most of the time hidden away in a backpack.

Other than Echo, the thing I liked most about EARTH TO ECHO was seeing Jason Gray-Stanford. Gray-Stanford played Randy Disher on MONK and I always liked him in that show. It was good to see him on screen again.

Overall, EARTH TO ECHO is a family-friendly found-footage movie (outside of a few words) about a small robotic alien lost on Earth and a group of friends trying to help him. It has some positive messages to convey about friendship and keeping ones word. The movie is also full of references to several 1980s movies. However, the film is weighted down by the stories it references and lacks freshness and originality. EARTH TO ECHO is a movie kids will probably enjoy seeing, but probably isn't one they will be requesting to view over and over again.",1410220800,75,2605,4.5576923076923075
6555790,5,B00M4A93NY,"Even though I was expecting to like this movie, I was completely blown away by how good it was! The plot is really exciting, with lots of mystery, excitement, and plot twists. The cinematography was really enjoyable, and it added to the movie in an important way. Most importantly, the characters were really well drawn, with lots of depth (and wonderful performances from all!). Here's hoping for a sequel!",1407888000,12,407,4.913043478260869
6555791,2,B00M4A93NY,"... but without the heart, drama, and excitement. The alien character might be a bit cuter, and skittish kiddies won't face some of ET's scarier moments. Otherwise, missable.

6555792,3,B00M4A93NY,"This film is basically ET with a hand held camera. Some kids get a phone signal that they decipher as a map. Late at night they take their bicycles (with bike cam) and travel 20 miles into the desert to find an alien mechanical device that needs help, but can only communicate through beeps. They go on a scavenger hunt tailed by the US government. The device can control electronics and make metal move around at will, except anything the US government uses to capture and dissect it.

The film takes place in Nevada. They were able to demonstrate hand held film supposedly made by a thirteen year old is as bad as one made by a twenty something. The alien device was not exciting. Clearly a film made for targeted preteens/ early teens. Has a message on friendship.

The movie had a few funny parts, probably the best part of the movie. All 3 boys broke into ""mannequin girls"" house. She catches them in he room, 3 kids who she doesn't know. They explain they found an alien, she's willing to go long with 3 strange boys she barely knows on a journey. In the beginning of the movie they explain that everyone had to move because a highway was being built over their whole neighborhood, pretty sure that's not legal.

6555871,3,B00M4A93NY,"If you have seen Rob Reiners Stand by Me (1986) and two Steven Spielberg sci-fi fantasy films in his early days, you have virtually seen Earth to Echo. Director Dave Greens feature debut is so obviously inspired by those classic movies he must have seen as a child, that it is nearly impossible not to notice the similarities.

I am not saying the film is all bad. The film is entertaining and it certainly tries to be original, but I think in a very wrong way.

In Earth to Echo three boys Alex, Tuck and Munch embark on a bicycle trip to uncover the mysterious incident of messages sent to the cell phones. As their neighborhood is going to be torn down to build a highway, they know this will be the last chance for them to be together. On their journey the boys stumble on something unexpected, something that some suspicious-looking men seem interested.

Now, most moviegoers know where the story comes from, but the problem of Earth to Echo is not that. The real problem of film is that it employs the overused technique of the Blair Witch-like shaky, hand-held camera. I know the film is made for the YouTube generation, but honestly, do we really need that here?

The acting of the kids is pretty good, and the special effects are decent, but, despite some nice ideas (see the unique car crash scene, for example  don't worry, no one dies in this movie), Earth to Echo needs more originality.",1446422400,,1400,4.5396825396825395

6555879,4,B00M4A93NY,"Every once in a while, you come across a film that, for whatever reason, flies under the radar. Although this movie did moderately well at the box office, I admit to have never even heard of it (didn't see a single trace of a trailer or name mentioned) until I happened across the DVD one day at the store. The cover seemed to pretty much rip off the poster for E.T., and despite being a fan of sci-fi, the small synopsis on the back turned me off. It sounded like just another churned out family/kids movie, so I passed it up and promptly forgot about it....until I read a review from a close friend of mine, who explained that it was more than meets the eye. Now curious, I decided to give the film a chance.

Suffice it to say, I'm SO glad I did. This movie not only exceeded my expectations, but should go down as one of the biggest underrated films of the recent decade.

Three neighborhood teenagers are devastated to learn that they're entire neighborhood is going to be demolished to make way for a new highway...meaning that they're no doubt going to be separated for a long time--possibly forever. Each of them are outcasts in their own way, and find solace in their friendship that's become so strong, they consider one another family. Alex is a foster child who keeps getting bounced from one house to the next, and only wishes to finally find one steady place to call home (and is constantly afraid of people abandoning him). Munch is the school brainiac, who's odd habits and nervous ticks make him a target for bullies. And Tuck is constantly seemingly ignored by his family, and, feeling invisible and unable to make a difference anywhere, he takes to filming his day-to-day life (as well as the protests against the neighborhood being demolished) and posting his videos on the internet. But one day, the trio's lives change forever when they begin receiving cryptic and encoded messages on their cell phones--containing maps to a mysterious area out in the desert. Taking the opportunity to spend their last night together, the three friends follow the map....where they discover the site of a crashed space pod...and inside is a friendly, but tiny, robotic alien, who they eventually dub Echo. From then on, it becomes a race against time to help the strange creature find the parts it needs to repair its spaceship and return home. Along the way, they're joined by a rebellious girl named Emma, and pursued by shadowy government agents who want to capture the alien for their own ends....but it also leads the trio to having the most exciting and unforgettable night of their lives...and learning that just because you're miles apart from someone doesn't mean you can't stay friends.

From the above synopsis, one can easily see the comparisons to other famous movies, most notably ""E.T"" (about trying to help an alien return home) and ""The Goonies"" (about a group of outcast kids who are being forced to move away from each other). And yes, it IS pretty much a combination of those two plots, along with taking the ""Blair Witch Project"" route and filming the entire movie in the style of the ""found footage"" genre. But you know...just because a movie rehashes a few old/clich ideas doesn't make it bad. It's all in how it's presented. And while, admittedly, this movie doesn't really bring much new to the table, I still very much enjoyed the ride. This is a movie that has a clear message and overall HEART that seems to be fading from a lot of action/adventure films of late. The kids sound and act like real kids, and more than a few times, I nearly forgot I was watching a movie--their performances were so honest, I actually thought I was watching real people. The situations (both relatable and other-worldly) they get themselves into, and their reactions are often times scary, awe-inspiring, and sometimes even downright hilarious.

Echo himself is super adorable, and I give props to the animators in how they brought him to life. The CGI blends pretty well, and at no point did it bring me out of the movie. And Emma, who could've easily just been the token girl of the group, is revealed to be incredibly clever and smart beyond her ""popular girly-girl"" image. The government agents, on the other hand, are pretty much your standard ""uncaring G-Men who just want to experiment on the alien without talking to it first"" types, but thankfully, they don't really come into full play until the third act, and even then, we still keep to the kids' perspective.  The finale is left a bit open ended, but it caps off the movie with a poignant message about staying true to yourself, keeping friendships no matter the distance, and that even if you feel invisible sometimes, a person, big or small, CAN make a difference.

As for the ""found footage"" approach, I'm typically not a fan of the genre, but I was able to make an exception here, because since the plot involves the alien communicating via the kids' cell phones, it completely makes sense that the movie would be filmed as such. After being bogged down with one ""shaky cam"" horror movie after another (like Paranormal Activity and Cloverfield), it was a refreshing change of pace to see the ""found footage"" genre being used in a family friendly sci-fi flick instead. (And honestly, I don't think the camera shook that much. Of course it wobbles a tiny bit, but the kids know how to hold the camera steady when it matters.)

Yes, this movie is basically E.T. meets-The Goonies meets-The Blair Witch Project....and I don't care. It took the best elements of each of the things it was copying, and combined them together into a film that's severely underrated and deserves more attention. Hopefully, its life on DVD will prove to be more successful. This is how you rehash old plots and do it right.",1445385600,,5779,4.704545454545454

As a parent, but then again, even if I wasn't a parent, I didn't like seeing these young people out in the late evening without supervision. They're all over the place, having an Echo adventure, and their parents or other family members have no idea what they're up to? Not good. But the message of friendship - very nice.

This was an interesting, heart touching film. Astro, Teo and Reese are talented young actors. And it was nice to see Jason Gray-Stanford, who played Lt. Randall Disher on the television series, Monk.

But that is not why I gave the movie such a low star. It was the not so great acting and the copycat of two movies mashed together. It was also ridiculous how a bunch of young kids stayed out all night into the morning and no parents knew anything. Then at the end of the movie thousands of parts come shooting out of the ground in the middle of a neighborhood in broad daylight and form a gigantic spaceship in midair right above the homes and then blasts away and no one in the neighborhood saw anything except one lady. And then it was corny that the main character at the end of the movie was so sad that the alien was leaving when he only knew the alien for just overnight and did not have any real interaction with it.

The filmmakers are showing this from the viewpoint of three young teens and a tag long girl-crush who are filming their last day together before the boys are separated forever due to a construction project that is ripping up their neighborhood.

For an unknown reason, all of the cellphones in their neighborhood have started to display a strange map and on their last night together, they have decided to set out on an adventure to find out where the signal that they have received leads.  Little do they know, but all points eventually lead home  not just for them, but for Echo too, their little mechanical robotic friend.

An excellent family movie night suggestion with friendship and never leaving someone behind as the main themes.  If there was cussing, I never heard it.  There might have been a couple euphemisms, but nothing that I would find to be offensive.

If you want to make it a marathon night, pair this E.T. or Goonies.",1431993600,,1211,4.701421800947867

6556090,1,B00M4A93NY,"I watched the first half free on Netflix and thought it was BOOOORING!  The shooting style with the camera in motion is not as bad as some of the reviews state.  It's the same as many current major network series.  Many people don't notice how many of our shows and movies are shot with this camera in motion style.  Once you notice it's a POV (point of view) cam it can be distracting but most don't notice because it's like being there.  My big problem with the movie is that the reasoning behind the plot is just stupid.  I can't imagine kids or adults buying into the reasoning.  The cell phones barf on themselves so they google the shape of this video barf hit the internet boards and someone finds this shape?  And we do this because we don't want to move and hope that somehow it relates to the evil freeway builders that have exercised imminent domain over the town will be exposed and we won't have to move.  It's just a stretch.  Then to bring arm fulls of cell phones to trace the signal by breaking all the cell phones??? Naaa I don't buy it and I don't think my kid-tribe, being pretty discerning would either.  Maybe if they were really really young and couldn't follow a plot.",1426118400,,1192,4.372727272727273

6556145,4,B00M4A93NY,"I watch a lot of movies but I don't review many of them. The primary reason is that your enjoyment of a film can be heavily influenced by many variables before you even walk into the theater or press play on your remote. These distracting expectations seem to be behind many of the criticisms of the movie Earth to Echo. An entire generation of adults grew up watching pre-teen adventure films, largely starting with E.T. and progressing to The Goonies. The strong emotional memories of these films tie themselves to an all too human a tendency towards nostalgia. The result is a long list of angry reviews against what is ultimately a kids movie.

I watched Earth to Echo with no expectations. I knew a little about the general plot and I had an idea what category it probably fit in. However, I also suspended my disbelief, put on my little kid hat and just immersed myself in the experience. The result was an enjoyable ride seen through the eyes and multiple cameras of a group of modern kids. Using cell phones and Youtube the characters document every moment of their amazing adventure. They run, they ride, they laugh, they argue. They act like kids. Even if they are sometimes thrown off by the fact that they are filming what is happening. I think it makes their reactions more believable.

Ok, it doesn't have the long drawn out emotional scenes of E.T. and it lacks the beautiful scenery of Goonies but this is a new movie. It's filmed in a pre-fab suburban neighborhood by technology savvy kids who are facing their own, more updated set of problems. This might be a case where the parents need to set aside their backwards blinders and accept that things are changing. I would suspect that pre-teen kids, the target audience for this film, will probably have a lot more fun watching it if their parents just left the room.",1424649600,,1835,4.625766871165644

The 6 year old was in my lap for most of it, cried when there were some emotional parts, but cheered the kids on thru most of the movie (12 year old too).

6556233,4,B00M4A93NY,"When ""Earth to Echo"" was first advertised in theaters, I thought it looked like a fairly cute and harmless ""kids find an alien and help it get home"" movie.  It didn't get a lot of attention, however, and pretty much sank without a trace at the box office, so I didn't think much more of it.  I finally decided to give it a chance when it showed up on DVD at the library.  I'm not fond of the ""found footage"" style of filmmaking, mostly because it seems to be a vehicle for horror films, but I wanted to see how another film genre would handle the style, and whether it would help or hurt the story.

While the ""found footage"" format feels a bit gimmicky, this film is otherwise quite good, and deserves more attention than it ultimately received.

The plot of this film is pretty much ""ET"" meets ""The Goonies.""  Three boys -- camera nut Alex, misfit foster kid Tuck, and reclusive gadget-genius Munch -- are all coming to terms with their friendship splitting up when the building of a new freeway through their town forces their families to move.  Alex begins filming a documentary about the area to cope with the upcoming move... but his focus soon shifts onto finding out what phenomenon is causing a mysterious map to be projected onto every cell phone in the area, an event that only gets weirder when a suspicious organization begins confiscating people's phones.  The boys follow the map to the desert, where they find a tiny metal pod containing a robot alien, whom they befriend and name Echo.  They establish communication with him, discover that he can only see through Alex's phone camera, and, with the help of a feisty girl named Emma, set off to help him find the pieces of his spaceship so he can return home.  But every step of the way they're being pursued, and the men who seek Echo have a very good reason for preventing him from returning home...

I personally found the ""found footage"" aspect of the film unnecessary -- it didn't add much to the film, and the movie could have been filmed conventionally and it wouldn't have impacted the plot.  That aside, however, I still enjoyed it.  The plot isn't anything groundbreaking, but it's still fun, and you can't help but root for the kids as they try to help their unusual new friend.  Each kid has their own personality, their own quirks and strengths, and they all compliment each other pretty nicely.  Even Emma, who came across as the ""token girl"" at first, turns out to be a good character.

Echo himself is adorable -- I admit to shamelessly squeeing from cute when he first showed up on the screen.  The CGI of the film is well-done, and even if I'm never quite able to forget that Echo is only a computer animation, he still doesn't stand out too jarringly from the rest of the world.  And he looks and acts unique enough that he doesn't come across as a ""generic alien.""

Even the ""villains"" of this film aren't the stereotypical government agents out to capture the alien.  While their methods are cold, they're not overly cruel, they don't threaten the kids' lives, and they have a legitimate (and even understandable) reason for trying to capture Echo.  It's hard to hate them, but at the same time we genuinely want to see the kids and Echo succeed at their quest, despite the consequences.

If you enjoyed ""ET"" or ""The Goonies,"" give ""Earth to Echo"" a shot.  It's an updated combination of the former two films, and a great family film.",1422230400,,3421,4.563011456628478

6556266,5,B00M4A93NY,"I am not sure what the negative reviewers were expecting when they watched this film, it is not a film intended for an adult audience. This film was made with pre-teens in mind, primarily pre-teen boys! After all of the Disney princess and other feminine films that have been out within the last few years it is a refreshing change to have a film that is something pre-teen boys will enjoy. I rented this for my 12 year old nephew who has been wanting to see this since it was in theaters and he absolutely loved it! I disagree with the reviewers who thought the boys overacted... if you want to see overacting, watch the Disney Channel.

The alien, Echo, is just adorable and looks like a mechanical owl type creature. The boys had good character development and growth. I like that it showed regular, average kids who come from traditional middle class families instead of making all three wealthy. The boys were boys-- they got in trouble, they lied, they did things they shouldn't have... but, they did it all to help a tiny little life get to his ship, repair it and go home.

This film has a lot of heart and that is something rare in todays films!",1420848000,3,1154,4.464454976303317
6556267,5,B00M4A93NY,"Loved this movie, and so did the family. It's got a ton of heart, endearing, convincing characters, and a fun plot. Most of all, it's got a ton of heart. Though this sci fi movie is very modestly budgeted compared to something like Transformers, the special effects are very convincing, and they work perfectly with the ""found footage"" approach that was used.. Those effects are used somewhat sparingly, but there's still plenty enough in this movie to prove that the cgi team on board knew exactly what they were doing. The movie plays out like a fantasy for young kids - getting into an unforgettable adventure with their best friends at an age that is very much magical. I'm oftentimes quite critical of child characters in movies, because they are so often portrayed in a lazy, unconvincing fashion. But I loved the characters in Earth to Echo... though they're certainly not flawless, they were all likable, believable, and they worked together great. My favorite character wasn't even human, it was the lovable robot, Echo, who is just plain awesome! You also have to appreciate the homage that is clearly played to Spielberg's E.T. here (assuming you're old enough to remember that classic!).",1420848000,2,1199,4.9405940594059405

6556348,5,B00M4A93NY,"Earth To Echo is a great movie. When this movie first came out, honestly I thought it wasn't really going to be that good, matter-o-fact, I thought it was going to be pretty bad. I seriously think I missed judged it. This movie had a lot of heart, it was funny, it showed you how important friendship is. This is the ideal movie that you want your little children watching.
  I am twelve years old. One thing I hate the most is when a movie is set up in like school or other kids my age and they just get everything wrong. They get how children think and act all twisted. I have quite  a few friends that our boys, and I can honestly say, that's what I be around. The conversations, attitudes, and stupidity. We don't go around helping little alien creatures find and repair spaceships everyday, but I could see a couple of them in these characters.
  It's kind of agitating that parents are like the movie had bad acting and they didn't like how the movie was filmed. Well I can't say to much on the way it was filmed, personally I thought that was the best way to film this type of movie, anyway the acting, keep in mind these are supposed to be children, and they aren't supposed to act like this is something that would normally happen everyday. The boy likes cameras and documenting things. This is supposed to there normal life. If you were put in this situation and some  body was recording you, how important would your acting be to you? It really doesn't make sense to me. I mean look at the story line.
  Earth to Echo is a great movie. It's not for just little children. This is a great movie to watch with your whole family. Like I said, I'm twelve, I don't normally watch movies like this, but I did get hooked. Even my seventeen and sixteen year old brothers got hooked when they came into the room, and it was in the middle of movie already. They said it was good to, even my parents said they really enjoyed it. This movie deserves all five stars, I'd give more if I could.",1420070400,,1989,4.285333333333333

6556364,2,B00M4A93NY,"I bought this on instant video and was disappointed. When I read the reviews, I thought this would be comparable to ET or Goonies, but more was like the Blair Witch Project though kid eyes. . However a fictional story, it was set like a documentary of kids going into the desert, following a map, at night, to find an alien. A little scary for small children because they may not understand that it is fictional since the film is seen through a child's eyes. Only able to watch the first 15 minutes before turning off (Filmed through what the main character sees in his camcorder). This makes the movie seem a little creepy since you are able to hear the main character's voice but rarely see him and the camera recording is very shaky. Not very good.",1419897600,,751,4.449275362318841

A lot of the story was an ET rip-off. I don't really mind that because ET was a great story that could be told again. But the casting was bad, the acting was atrocious. The story line was lame, and it was all done in a hand held jerky style that was supposed to add authenticity to the story. It didn't.

A really poor attempt at a copycat plot from E.T, and the first person camera view makes it nauseating.  Why would an alien look like an owl?",1418774400,,293,3.9491525423728815

I didn't feel attached to any of them and I was actually getting very annoyed with the black kids idiotic narration. The adult parts in this movie were terrible too. Everything just felt like ""stuff people would never do or say"" the whole movie. It just didn't sell. If you want a good movie of this style and genre: Then watch Super 8.

I idea of a bunch of kids running around with a video camera was totally a very bad idea. I was very disappointed in this movie and now know why it didn't last long in theaters.

The acting was bad too and the story had promise but I was so bored an irritated with the slow moving story, acting, and film style that by the time they got to the interesting part with Echo, I didn't really care anymore.

6556653,3,B00M4A93NY,"Earth to Echo is a strange juggling act, a minor treat disguised as an initially cloying family oriented movie. It harkens back to the days of such Spielberg masterpieces as Close Encounters of the Third Kind and ET: The Extraterrestrial with its emphasis on young children having a journey beyond the stars behind the backs of their parents, who are often to consumed with their own lives to even care (as is made evident in one early scene), but still yearns to have the low-budget and amateurish shaky handheld camera style of a contemporary found footage film.
 Initially this seemed a strangely admirable experience. It appeared to work far more for my personal admiration for the early Spielberg style present than the more modern modus of filmmaking, which was groundbreaking when The Blair Witch Project hit the scene fifteen years ago but has become so frequent and imitated since than it is easy to dismiss it as lazy cinema creation, and this created mixed feelings in me.
 The young protagonists and cast come off in much the same way as any number of main characters in a found footage film. They are introduced in a manner which is wholly unoriginal and there does not seem to be much differentiation here between these individuals and the many we have seen in motion pictures of this type.  To be honest, I wrote these individuals off as stock genre stereotypes but after the first act faded away the personalities populating the screen went through every familiar motion for a piece of cinema of this variety (complete with arguments, fights, running from sinister authority figures etc.) but by the time the story of a tiny creature they find along the way comes into play just under a half hour in the minor-league Spielberg factor had kicked in for me big time and I was not so overly critical of such things.
 Seen as a whole it does seem that this family friendly fare is checking off a list of plot points it must hit, all of which we have seen done far better in many prior works of cinema, but I could not ignore that there is a slow working magic to the proceedings. It hits on wide-spread themes of friends and being forced to leave those you are close to (notes of early-Spielberg all) but it cannot be denied that it there is a gentleness, a subtle love here that seems sadly lacking from the majority of family films these days. This, combined with the likability of Echo (which brings back memories of other personal favorites as Gizmo in Gremlins and less adored features as the title character of the Short Circuit films) and a general sense of friendship between the characters, which helped win me over and push aside the blinders of petty complaints which stopped me from enjoying the brief and refreshingly to the point 89 minute production when I began the casually charming journey which is this film.
 Unlike the early Spielberg works previously mentioned this is not a full- fledged masterpiece by any stretch yet it is a nice step in the general direction. Earth to Echo is a kind affair with a tried and true lessons attached that resonated within and touched a chord of innocence within me. It is a motion picture that adults and children can enjoy equally which does not insult the older audience's intelligence and actually has some rather intriguing ideas sprinkled throughout that work despite the nagging impression that so much of them has been recycled many times over.
 The special effects are fair, far better than the abhorrent computer generated imagery littering and destroying theaters these days, and it does not have a particularly timeless feeling given the found footage style but it is recommendation worthy because it has a message attached and is not afraid to have an emotional undercurrent. As sad as it is that is something essential in a children's or family narrative that seems long lost and I admired how director Dave Green and his crew tried to resurrect this type of genre effort.
 Unlike ET: The Extraterrestrial or the conclusion of Gremlins there is no particularly effective finale in Earth to Echo. It ends as it should, though predictably, but it is a nice and still semi-stirring send-off.  As strange as it may sound, it's a fitting quality for how this film works: a familiar and not particularly rousing pattern that finds a manner to be jovial and welcome despite its clichs. Like Echo itself, the work is broken but that still does not mean it can't gravitate beyond expectations and ultimately fly above the usual genre fare. Simply stated, I was gradually captivated by Earth to Echo and you may very well be too.",1416528000,7,4600,4.7556390977443606

The moving camera on the kid's bike and/or glasses jiggled the picture, sometimes turned it sideways, even upside down. About halfway through I was really nauseous and I had to keep looking away.

I wanted them to see it because it reminded me of ET and I remembered enjoying that movie as a child. All the girls really liked it. They went through all the emotions I remember watching ET. They started out interested, only to find they were surprised, scared and eventually a little sad. They ended up watching it a second time. It was a little over my 5 year old's head, and the special effects could not keep his attention. It was a great family movie. Perfect for children and parents.",1416096000,,587,4.394495412844036

They live in this development that all the families are being forced to move. A highway is going up in this area. So these three boys have something happen to their cell phones. They get like a picture of a map on their phones. So they find this place is in the desert, close to where they live. So for one last adventure they decide to see what it is. What an adventure they got. This little alien is sending them a message on their phones on how to find him. They find they little spaceship and see that it was damaged. This little alien was able to correspond with them with noise. It was able to let them know that he was going to have them help with building a large spaceship. So this little alien was sending message to their cell phones on these places to go on getting parts to repair his damaged ship. They ended up having a girl come with them, because one of the places they got sent to was her house for a bracelet and she catches them in her room. The government knew something happened and knew that these boys were up to something. The government tried to stop this ship from be built, but the kids made it happen any way.

This movie was crap from beginning with three pre-teens talking smack on their parents , their life and their frustrations of moving away due to construction projects to hide an alien ship. The language and suggestive themes between the youth are not suggested for younger audiences. Took roughly 35 - 40 mins until you actually get to see the alien.  I would closely relate this to a mild version of Blair Witch, the constant moving camera footage was dizzying and less than theatrical. Very poorly done.  I would not recommend this movie for kids under the age of 13.  My 10 and 7 year old asked me to shut it off.

I did not. The story was okay but Echo the alien played a minor role really and from the trailer I thought it would have a more starring role.",1414886400,,495,4.25531914893617

I believe that lots of people go into movies with unwarranted expectations based on trailers and marketing.  Studios don't care, so much as tickets are sold and DVDs are purchased.

This is not really an alien movie.  This is a movie about a group of kids, the bond they share, and a significant time in their lives.  We all have childhood memories and this movie serves to tell a story about an amazing (fictional) situation.  It has a fairly simple plot, designed for kids to understand, and the special effects are good enough to be believable.

If you're looking for a simple and fun family movie for little kids, this is a solid choice.  Teenagers would likely be bored as the story is based on pre-teenage kids.",1414800000,,815,4.482993197278912

As a result my 8 & 10 year olds loved the movie.  While there are many moments in the film that place the kids in circumstances that are not good for kids, e.g., the bar, the illegal teen house party, and driving cars, these are things that young tweens/teens think about and are exposed to that this movie provides a great opportunity for parents to discuss with their kids and build some really positive conversations.

6556885,5,B00M4A93NY,"Far too much is being made of this movie and how it compares to ET and similar movies from an earlier era; flight of the navigator, short circuit, etc. Sure if you saw those, you may wax nostalgic about how superior they were. And in some ways they were, but in many ways they are not now. Case in point I tried to introduce flight of the navigator to a couple of kids recently and they lost interest very quickly.

I have just watched this movie with a pre-tween, and it illicitly tons of laughs and interest. I am sure this is the best movie to them they have seen in quite a while.

So, please try to  look through the eyes of a 9 year old or a 12 year old. They will LOVE this movie. What you may find obnoxious with the constant references to YouTube, phones, Google maps, etc. they will find endearing.

As far as appropriateness this movie has no swearing, no sexual content (closest is some boys find a girl hot), no violence. I recommend it without hesitation.",1414713600,,969,4.278688524590164

The only think worse that the movie was the end that just hung there with no logic for that they were doing.

Tuck as played by ""Astro""...really? ""Astro""? This kid who's real name is Brian can't act for jack squat and should NOT have been cast. His bad acting aside, his character was a jerk that did NOTHING to add to the story. He also lies to his friends. No one would have ever been friends with a useless idiot like him. It was like Alex (the kid Tuck left behind) was just waiting for a chance to say goodbye to Tuck forever. But Tuck is clueless and thinks everything is just fine all the time. Unlikable characters
Teo (who played Alex) was the only decent actor in the bunch. His character was the only one with a little sense.
Munch would have been a much better character if he just stood up to his so-called friends. He was potentially a genius but was sadly left out of the plan. It was like ""We have to have Tuck figure things out and not the smart kid"" which really was a bad movie plot-wise. The actor (Reese) wasn't that bad but his character was poorly written.
Plot-So what was the deal with the gov construction crew? They were pretty inept and all of this trespassing and obstruction these children caused was just forgot about by the end of the film?
We are also given zero closure. Echo leaves and no one even tries to stop him even after all this construction/digging has been going on? No gov troops are around? They shot down echo, why didn't they scramble troops/fighter jets for the final ship? I know it was fast but not ONE person other than the kids got it on film?
Oh yeah..the filming. So randomly, the makers of this B movie decided to stop the camcorder filming and would switch to film crew (professional) filming at random times. I guess a 10 yr old won't notice it but an adult did.
Bad acting, bad writing and no follow through ruined this.",1414454400,,2014,4.373333333333333

6557026,5,B00M4A93NY,"I as well as the kids had been anxiously awaiting this release, we missed it over the summer while at theaters.  I figured it would be good, but was completely blown away by how good it was!  It is like a treasure of a movie that people do not know about.  You really get attached to the characters and their plight.  It also has a little bit of mystery and suspense involved as it is not predictable and you don't know what is coming next.

While the film focuses on three friends who make a  discovery of an alien and all they go through to help him build his ship and get back home, there is another storyline going on... one of friendship.  The friendship piece hit me hard, it was so great to see these kids having each others backs no matter what. Friendship lasts no matter where you are in life, no matter how far apart you get.  I honestly loved seeing at the end the three boys and girl getting back together a year later...and it was truly a year later (I learned from the special features).

If you are looking for a phenomenal family film, then look no further than Earth to Echo!
