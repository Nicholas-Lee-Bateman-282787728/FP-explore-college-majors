395283,4,6301972228,"The Next Voice You Hear shows a typical small American family's reaction to a subtle worldwide miracle.  The title refers to the voice of God, miraculously broadcast worldwide via AM radio.  At the time the film was made, few people had television yet, but almost everyone in the world had access to a radio.  The story is told from the point of view of the Smith family, played by James Whitmore (Face of Fire, The Shawshank Redemption), Nancy Davis Reagan (Donovan's Brain, Hellcats of the Navy), and Gary Gray (Rachel And The Stranger).  At first they, along with everyone else, think it's a hoax.  But the miracle is repeated for six nights.

You might think you wouldn't be interested in The Next Voice You Hear if you're not religious.  But to me it's more like a Twilight Zone episode.  Almost like the Cleavers or the Andersons plunged into the twilight zone.  The film is effective because it's subtle; they don't hit you over the head with religion.  You, the viewer, never hear the voice of God, only His words repeated by characters and radio announcers.

The acting is very good, directing and production values competent.  I think the script could have been a little better, but it keeps your interest throughout.

Chet Huntley, who was later co-anchor of NBC news with David Brinkley, performed the voice of the radio announcer.",1124582400,18,1343,4.78695652173913
395284,5,6301972228,"This little film is really a remarkable artifact from 1950. There is an innocence to it that you couldn't recreate today. It manages to use a controversial theme like the voice of God manifesting over the radiowaves of the world over a six day period, yet there is no real partisan sense of controversy. You accept that it is really the voice of God. Moreover, there is no dogma attached- no mention of specific scriptures, or even specific prophets- just God speaking plainly for himself to the average man and woman. The message itself is no profound, radical, Last Days revelation- just a simple one of kindness, goodness, and love. Given the chaotic times that the world had just passed through, it makes sense that the message would be a calming and reassuring one. Any panic it causes in the story seems to be the result of the personal guilt and misunderstanding of the listeners.

The secondary significance to this film is the perfect picture it paints of the its time. This was five years after the end of the war. The G.I.'s and defense workers were just beginning to settle into domesticity after some wild and scary times. Suburbia was just coming into existance. Nor was this a time of complacent prosperity- the average Joe was a factory worker that was under pressure to just get by. There are also all of the little things of typical American life- bowling with friends, listening to the radio (no television for the masses, yet), starters on the floorboards of cars, a husband going out for cigarettes (and asking his pregnant wife if she would like him to get her a pack....)

Whitmore is perfect as Mr. Average Joe (Joe Smith, actually)- and is likeable and believable. Nowadays most people would classify him as a lower class, factory-working loser- but then he was Mr. Average American- the salt of the earth. His wife, Nancy Davis (Nancy Reagan) is the perfect stay at home, hard working, housewife (not yet a negative stereotype.) The son is as clean-cut an example of the all-American boy as you could wish. And yet, together, they never come across as phoney or contrived. Infact, they come across as far more real than the vast majority of families today.

You never actually hear the actual voice of God, but this is for the best. An actual voice would have been a distraction and a let down compared to what the viewer can picture in his own mind and heart. Afterall, that is where God has always spoken to the little guy all down through the ages.",1111536000,67,2477,4.663615560640732

I was introduced to this story in the 1990's while waiting in the dentist's office lobby.  It was in a Reader's Digest on the rack.  At one point in the short story, God sinks the Australian continent and raises it back up just to let everybody KNOW who was talking.

This movie goes were many movies even today do not tend to venture, the question of the existence of God. A low budget and quickly produced film, it nonetheless finds its way into your heart, and you hear yourself asking the same kinds of questions and feeling, well...the same kinds of fears as the characters in the film. Some of the acting is a little over the top even for 1950, but it's a good film.

395809,4,6301972228,"The film, ""The Next Voice You Hear..."", is a 1950 Sci-Fi low-budget B-movie cult classic. Many reviewers pan this film, simply dismissing it as a cheap piece of Cold War propaganda. However; I think the film simultaneously works well as both propaganda and an offbeat science fiction movie, that goes way outside the box, where few films are brave enough to tread.

Fine performances are turned in as an average, working class, all-American couple by Nancy Reagan & James Whitmore. The direction & cinematography are competent, especially considering the ultra-low budget. The original score and theme sound like a classic hymn that you would sing in church.

The premise, that God speaks to the world over the radio, sounds incredibly hoaky to our 21st century cynical minds, but it comes off as totally believable thanks to a tight script, solid acting and directing.

This particular DVD, part of the Warner Btother Archive Collection, is just so-so. The most important thing for classic films on DVD, is quality picture & sound. Many classic films are mastered to DVD using inferior film prints with scratched frames, and poorly mastered sound. The work done in mastering this film was good, but not great. The picture is clear, and the sound is crisp. There are very minute specs & spots on frames throughout, but this is absolutely minor (the clarity is probably slightly above average for a film its era). The sound is also well done, no hiss or exremely loud or quiet parts.

The main drawback to this DVD is the bonus features. The packaging and artwork are minimal, and the DVD really has no bonus features unless you include the trailer, which is included on virtually all DVD's and costs almost nothing. This is a classic film that may be viewed on many different levels; audio commentary, production stills, isolated soundtrack, cast & production crew bios, and better artwork could have been provided at minimal cost. I paid $23 for this DVD, because I needed it for a presentation. It is out of print and becoming hard to find(unavailable on Netflix). My advice is to find a lightly used DVD to save yourself some money.",1339891200,,2135,4.873278236914601

I was moved to tears, and I actually imagined the possibility that the world could one day be transformed if these words of God would be heeded.  This is not a preachy, religious movie.  Filmed in black and white, it is more about an everyday family afraid, but newly awakened to each other by love and kindness through basic truths and renewed spirit.

This is not a religious film as you may think.  It aspires to make you think about how nice it would be if everyone could be a little more kind, a little more thoughtful and loving, and to slow down a little.

I have always been a fan of sci-fi and the Twilight Zone styled stories, but this has a religious spin, so that made it unique. In the 50s there was a whole string of films made in response to the so-called 'Red Scare' which spawned an entire genre of nuclear disaster flicks. This one stops short of that, but serves as a warning to mankind of impending doom if we do not heed God's warning about mending our ways.
I personally do not feel such a warning would be heeded, even if it was broadcast worldwide as it ws in this scenario, since the bible has already given us all we need to know about the end times and  the impending doom of the unrepentant. I am not a big fan of disarmament propaganda films, which many of these films have served as, but this one is both fun and scary.

It's about how the voice of God comes through on the radio each night for about a week.  It comes on at the same time all over the world and each person hears it in their own language.  The movie shows how this is first perceived as some elaborate hoax and then people realize it must be true.  It explores the issue of how we might act if this were truly to happen.  Set in the 1950's (when I was born), the black and white picture brings back good memories of that era but also shows that basically human nature has not changed since then.

395875,4,6301972228,"This is an amazing piece of 1950 Americana with a nice father, nice mother, nice son, nice people who believe in God and care about having decent morals - a far cry from films in the past 40 years.

The story, acting and photography is okay but nothing exceptional. Today, it would bore 95 percent of the viewing audience. The main appeal is simply its homage to an innocent age (if there ever was one!).

It was interesting see Nancy Davis, who became Nancy Reagan. At first, she appeared pretty plain bit the more I view this movie, the prettier she gets...especially her eyes.  The story, without spoiling it, is simply about people who hear God talking through the radio to them, trying to get them to think about things.

Theology-wise, the movie is pretty vague and general, not wanting to offend anyone but it still had a good message. Overall, I guess you could label this film ""a curiosity piece"" and certainly a slice of Americana.",1238025600,7,941,4.616766467065868

395878,5,6301972228,"I'm agreeing with the other reviewers of this little movie. It's a pretty nice movie and a bit Twilight Zonish (imho).

It's a peek back to 1950 that fits in some of the stresses and feelings that real people deal with and manages to avoid the idealized world of the Cleavers and Andersons that so many seem to yearn for today.

It has a nice universal message but there are Biblical references, rain for 40 days and nights, I am Who I am, miracles, and chapter and verse from the Book of John at the very end. Thankfully, it doesn't dwell on them.

There are visuals that struck me like Joe Smith still wearing his leather bomber jacket, Joe's son sanding a bomber in the boss/neighbor's workshop. I'm guessing that bomber took more than a Sunday afternoon to get to that stage so Johnny and his dad's boss have been friends for awhile.

The neighborhood looks much older than the subdivisions that popped up right after WWII would have been in 1950.  The Johnny Smith character played by Gary Gray, who was born in 1936, is quite a bit older than we Boomers who were born in 1946. Maybe this is more a story about a guy named Joe who had a young family before the war and made it back.

Did anyone notice a very young Sherry Jackson (Make Room for Daddy) in the church scene at the end of the movie?",1193529600,5,1301,4.333333333333333

7818709,4,6301972228,"This is such a different, almost strange movie, in so many ways, it's difficult to know where to begin.  But I like it well enough to watch again, and some of the things I like and noticed here and there haven't been mentioned by other reviewers, so I'll just start in with what I love; what I like and think deserve mention; and what I think could have been improved.

Things I love:

First, I love the director.  William Wellman is top-notch, and I'll watch anything he directed at any time.  He was tough, he was realistic, he was imaginative, he had a great sense of humor, and he respected his leading ladies as much as his leading men.  There are so many great stories about William Wellman--his WWI flying, his ""Wild Bill"" antics, but this isn't the place to go into them.

Second, I love James Whitmore.  He was such a tough little guy, a rather ugly little everyman that you just love to watch stumble around and do things that the handsome hunks would never manage.  He was like hamburger in a land of sirloin steaks, and most people understand and relate to hamburger.  He was funny, too!  Check out his ""Mrs. O'Malley and Mr. Malone"" with Marjorie Main--it's hilarious.  And, of course, his performance in ""Battleground"" and so many other memorable movies illustrate his range as an actor.  In this movie he is a good husband and a little unexpected, even--he makes his own orange juice and does the dishes while his wife helps the kid with his math homework.  He doesn't go out with the guys for beer after bowling because his wife won't know where to reach him if she goes into labor.  He's a good guy.

Third, I love the humor in this movie.  The scene where Whitmore floods his car through impatience and then goes through the many motions of getting it going, and then the followup scene where his son is seated at the kitchen table and anticipates the old man's every move (while he's in the garage trying to start the flooded car) is one of the best in the movie.  Another great one is when the cop stops him after he backs out of his driveway at top speed and gives him a ticket, and then he foolishly speeds away, only to be given another ticket a few yards down the road.  I don't know what's funnier--Whitmore driving away with his mouth full of speeding tickets, or Whitmore creeping down the road after his second speeding ticket, after finally learning his lesson.  So much good stuff here.

Fourth, I love that it's not really a religious movie.  Rather, it's a movie with a moral point, under the guise of a God's-voice-over-the-radio metaphor that a '50s audience would understand, appreciate, and enjoy.  The Voice is a reminder--even a warning--for people to improve their behavior.  It did make me wonder why they chose the radio as the medium, and the entire world's population as the receivers, when only a fraction of the world's population could have had access to radio reception.  But I guess the vast populations without it were on their own.  Anyway, the movie Is about people actively thinking about being nicer to other people, not a religious message, regardless of the mysterious ""godly"" delivery.

A further point of proof regarding the lack of religion is that Whitmore, our everyday Joe ('scuse the pun) is about as pious as a sack of meal, and that's deliberate on the part of the filmmakers.  Sure, he believes in God, but we don't know that until he's whacked over the head with the idea when he hears The Voice over the radio.  Then, and only then, does he even think about the idea of God.  Then he doesn't really believe it.  Note that until the very end of the movie, he just plows into his food without saying grace (notice he has to be coached to remember the words then); he doesn't mention anything religion, including denomination; and the family doesn't attend church until near the end when everybody else in the world goes to that final service.  His wife, his kid, his job, and bowling are his only interests in life.  I'll be charitable and leave out the drunken scene in the bar (which was equal parts funny and pathetic).  He doesn't love his neighbor, he holds grudges, he feels like socking Aunt Ethel (and who can blame him?), and he commits the same average kinds of sins that everybody else does.  So he's no Holy Joe (another bad pun), and that's why we like him, and we can relate to him.  Minimal religion.

In the end, he doesn't find Religion with a capital R, but what he DOES find is a desire to be a better guy.  And that is the message in this movie--not religion, but a nice, feel-good moral message:  Give your fellow man (and woman) a break.  Be a better person.  And Joe is.  And we like him--and this movie--for it.

Things I like and that deserve mention:

Gary Gray, who played the son, was very good.  He played the funny scenes and the touching scenes equally well.  The scene at the end between father and son was very moving.  I wondered why they cast a kid who was so much older to play the son when the mother was about to have another baby, but that's just my curiosity.

The cop is an actor I've seen in about a thousand movies.  I don't know his name, but he is usually funny and always good.  Ditto the two buddies at the airplane factory.  Jeff Corey is one.

I love seeing the airplane factory, the interior scenes of the house with the breakfast nook where the kid crawls under the table to get out, and the garage.  Also the old car, inside, and under the hood.  The beginnings of suburbia were sad and a glimpse of things to come:  Little boxes... as Woodie Guthrie sang.

The bar scene, whose occupants symbolized temptation for Joe, was effective and fun.  He stood up to them as well as he was able.  (And his exit was pretty funny, too.)  The old pal was rough and realistic, and appropriately cynical.

Things that could have been improved:

I thought Nancy Davis was rather colorless.  She was almost sickeningly supportive, all the time.  Did she keep that half-smile on her face all day?  Maybe all night, too?  Someone a little livelier would have been more fun to watch in the role.....  It was funny to see the subtle pregnancy look at 9 months, but that was the style in the '50s.  (Not her fault, at all.)  Too much bulge was considered vulgar for at least another decade.  At least we didn't have to witness the full labor, though!  That's something in modern movies that I wouldn't mind turning the clock back a few decades to miss.

I think the religious aspect WAS kept to a minimum with the voice of God NOT heard on the radio--but it should have been restricted to that.  It would have been better to eliminate the Bible verses from the beginning and end of the movie.  Those--especially the one at the beginning--lead the viewer to believe s/he is about the see a religious epic of some type.  I got a squirmy feeling and almost didn't want to watch the movie at this point, but because I knew William Wellman directed and James Whitmore starred, I decided to give it a chance.  I think the denouement of Joe and his son reuniting, as well as the melting away of the hatred of Joe and his boss, followed by the climax of the baby's arrival, are enough proof that things have turned out according to the grand plan.  As Joe is the symbol of humankind for this movie, we see there is hope for the rest of us.  We don't need it spelled out--literally--as well.

I know it was quickly made and looks like a low-budget TV movie.  Good as it is, I'm sure more time and bigger budget would have polished it up.

All in all, it was well worth watching, very funny in places, and had an excellent point that was not overly heavy-handed.",1520294400,,7649,4.469653179190751
