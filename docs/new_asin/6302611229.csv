7828491,3,6302611229,"This movie was good but might have been better with a better score and more of a supporting cast. Dennis Hopper is/was great in everything he's in but much was lacking. Let's start with the plot. Why would a guy (Played By Adam Ant) who lives in a $500,000 beachfront house want to jack a drug deal for 1 million? He could just as easily have sold his house and lived pretty well on the proceeds. Yes, he answers that by saying: ""I like my house!"" Yet to me it seems as if he liked his life a lot less. In the end he lost his life. I'm curious as to who got the house after he was killed.

Who was the BTC with Hopper in the swimming pool! Wow! She was gorgeous. She even walked off butt-naked when the dirty cop came to give him a rundown on what was going on.

Michael Pare is a very good actor and I've admired him since his days playing Joey LaFiamma in Houston Knights. But in this film he has little to work with. Although I did like the chemistry he had with Daphne Ashbrook.

I wish they would release this on DVD. I have it on tape from cable. If you can see it I recommend it just barely. You may or may not like it but you'll have to see for yourself.

I like this movie, the story not bad, acting is ok, and the sex scenes is hottt (Pare with Tweed ). Unfortunately most of his (Pare) movies not available in dvd format, i think that it would be great if it had as i like to have dvd collection for Pare's movies (Point of Impact, Womens Club, etc).",1046217600,2,428,4.3625
7828493,4,6302611229,"How did a movie with Hopper, Pare and Adam Ant get missed at the theater? I bought this movie because I'm an avid Adam Ant fan who wants to see all his movies. This one suprised me becuase it wasn't just good, but I'd never heard of it before. A definite must for any fan of the above but especially for me as an Adam Ant fan.",1022544000,2,326,3.8805970149253732
7828494,5,6302611229,"I just rented this one and really enjoyed it.  I knew with Michael Pare and Dennis Hopper it stood a good chance of being enjoyable, and it was.  I liked the storyline and the action was pretty slick.  I was not a music fan  of Adam Ant, but he did a pretty great job in his role of a conartist.  I  hated to see him get wasted off, as I enjoyed his character.  Pare is great  in all his work.",949795200,2,393,3.825
