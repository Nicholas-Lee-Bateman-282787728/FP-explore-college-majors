7818638,1,6301954882,"As this science fiction movie opens, we witness three events in Berlin (before the fall of the wall) resulting in multiple deaths.  In one case, an explosion is so horrific that people on both sides of the Berlin Wall are killed.  At a high level meeting of government officials, military officers and police there is a debate: are these accidents or are they suicides.  Over 500 people have been killed in similar circumstances.  Lt. Hartman argues that they are suicides, perhaps there is a suicide virus.  He is overruled and the management of the investigation is reassigned to Capt. Engler.  Dr. Marsfeldt enters the meeting (why?). He suggests people need more vacations, and he happens to run Theratos Company a provider of vacation travel.  Once outside, Hartman observes projection screens above street level protraying Sonja Vogler (Jennifer Beals)repeating in a hypnotic cadence ""It is time to get away.""  These are ads for Theratos.

Despite Engler's repeated repudiation of Hartman's investigation, Hartman continues on.  The rest of the story is told from Hartman's point of view.  There are more deaths.  A link is discovered in that each of the deceased possesses either a picture of Sonja or a card with the logo of Theratos.  How is she connected to these victims?  Elements of the plot include Hartman meeting Vogler, an assasination attempt on Sonja, Hartman's romance of her, the death of Hartman's police partner Stieglitz(murder or suicide?), secret reports by Capt. Engler to Dr. Marsfeldt, and the aura of the Club Extinction where Berlin's jaded youth rock maniacally while images of mushroom cloud explosions play on the club walls.  What is Sonja's link to the series of deaths?  Is she a victim of the strange manipulations of Dr. Marsfeldt?

As the plot unfolded, I found that I did not care for the characters or the story.  The film itself is disjointed.  For example Dr. Marsfeldt's appearance at the meeting of government officials has no connection to the meeting other than showing a video of people going on vacation.  Also, Sonja and Hartman vacation at a Theratos resort in the middle of the desert, decide to get away in the middle of the night and conveniently a car is driving through the middle of the dunes to aid the escape.

I like Jennifer Beals as an actress and that was the draw for me to watch this film.  She does show the greatest range of the actors in this film.  But I felt that this French-Italian-German production (in English) had no merit.",1322697600,,2499,4.897619047619048
