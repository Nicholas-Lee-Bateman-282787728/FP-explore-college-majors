7313671,5,B010LY97T4,"Let me say that first, trying to find something that my daughter actually likes to watch has been impossible. Luckily, we stumbled upon this show while flipping through the channels. It's on the Sprout channel and based on the sunny side up morning show. Most kids shows are impossible to watch for adults. This is one of the few that I've found that I actually enjoy watching with decent storylines and good characters. This show has a little of everything, puppets, singing and dancing, cartoons and fun characters all while teaching lessons to kids about almost everything from learning to eat right to follow the rules. Best of all, each episode is maybe only 15 minutes total, perfect for kids who don't like to sit still for any length of time. We have even began using this in DVD player in our car to keep my daughter entertained on long trips.",1460851200,,852,4.6490066225165565

8722626,5,B010LY97T4,"My 1.5 year old lovea chica. We don't have the sprout channel anymore since we got rid of expensive cable to get netflix, hulu, amazon and sling for our roku 2. The Chica Show is entertaining and teaches children positive lessons in life situations and social skills. Only one episode is related to Halloween. All other episodes are normal. Good dvd. I wish there were more Chica Show dvds to collect.",1476489600,,401,4.661971830985915
