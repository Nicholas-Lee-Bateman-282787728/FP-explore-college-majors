8161365,5,B000LBHB46,The only way these limited market items can be made available is for them to be released on DVD-R recordable media.  factory produced DVD's are prohibitively expensive in small runs.  I am happy this material is available.,1381881600,,222,4.972972972972973
8161366,4,B000LBHB46,I thought this DVD (mine was not a DVR - whatever that is) informative and entertaining.  This DVD played perfectly on my DVD only player.,1206230400,,138,4.52
8161367,1,B000LBHB46,"I like all these political speakers, and I was really looking forward to this purchase. However, when I received the product, I was disappointed to learn that it was just a DVR (a copy of a movie on a recordable disc) in a slipcase, not a legitimate DVD. My DVD players typically have all kinds of problems with DVR's, and if I had known this BEFORE I ordered it, I probably would not have ordered it. Please release these products on DVDs that will play on ALL DVD players, or at least advise customers that it is a DVR, and not a DVD. In the meantime, my thanks for the waste of money for a product that I can't use!",1183680000,5,618,4.158333333333333
