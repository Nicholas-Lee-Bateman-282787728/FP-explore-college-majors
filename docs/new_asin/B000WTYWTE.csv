8225602,1,B000WTYWTE,"Did not show band members like episodes that were shot in Nashville. These were taken in New York, maybe. Also too much Faron Young.",1429574400,,132,4.541666666666667
8225603,5,B000WTYWTE,Enjoy playing these for my husband.  He doesn't like the current country music.  He relates more to the old timers since he is getting to be an old timer too.,1393200000,,158,4.233333333333333
8225604,3,B000WTYWTE,"Season 4 is the final 13 episodes (40-52) of Country Style U.S.A.. Unlike previous seasons that had a host and a main guest artist, Faron Young acts as both host and main guest artist in every episode. If you're not a fan of him, you will probably be very disappointed with this season. He is present throughout most of it with few exceptions. Worse is that most of the second/special guest artists are forgettable or uninspired. However, Patsy Cline does ""Walkin' After Midnight"", so there may be an incentive to go ahead and get this to complete your Country Style U.S.A. library.

8225605,3,B000WTYWTE,"I really like these old shows. The video and sound quality are both good. The problem that I have with this dvd is that Faron Young hosts all 13 programs and except for Patsy Cline, Skeeter Davis and a young Buck Owens, the guests  on the other shows are not that well known.",1297555200,,275,4.188679245283019
