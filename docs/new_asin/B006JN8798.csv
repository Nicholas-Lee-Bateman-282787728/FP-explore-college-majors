4993377,2,B006JN8798,"'Ole Stone Cold looked promising when switching from the pro-wrestling scene to the big screen in his earlier movies such as the Adam Sandler remake of ""The Longest Yard"" and my personal favorite to date ""The Condemned"". But it seems since then Austin's movie appearances and starring roles have really gone down hill. I haven't seen a decent film starring him since the previous two movies I mentioned. This one has been by far one of the worst. It's not so much the acting or the budget, it does appear to be a well filmed movie and the acting on most people other then Austin's part was not too bad. I won't go to extremes and say Austin can't act. He's meant to be an action star now, and quite frankly a lot of the action stars make movies not based on great acting skills, but they usually make a decent action flick.. hence Van Damn and Dolph Lungren... but what did not sit well with me during this movie is Austin just seemed too tough to beleive.

The plot is about Ryan Something played by Austin who rolls into a town called Hope to seek out vengeance. Austins character is an ex-cop who is hunting down the men who killed his family. He takes one out and all of a sudden the towns biker gang who run the whole town of Hope want Austin dead. The gang is lead by whoever it is Danny Trejo plays. He is the ring leader and owns the town, with drugs and gun shipping and has the cops on the pay roll blah blah blah... heard it before? I have too, which is why I don't have much to say in a positive light regarding that area.

Austin plays a character that comes into town, and seems bulletproof, he rattles the lions cage, and announces he is the toughest SOB on the planet, which OK, if this was the WWE, we'd buy into something like that and accept it as entertainment, but in a movie like this, we are really supposed to beleive the guy is so well trained and can fight so perfectly that no one can stop him? He can disarm a guys gun with a single look, can hold a mans throat over the edge of a cliff with one hands grip, can leap tall buildings in a single bound and blah blah blah blah ... OK WE GET IT, he's a hard arse... but when you watch this film, it's like someone ticked off Superman, so Superman slowly saves the day where no one had a chance of stopping him anyway.

There is also a few little side stories that either needed to be utilized to make sense of why they are in this movie, or cut them out all together. I am specifically directing that comment to the role Lochlyn Munro plays, as one of the most useless inserts I have seen in an attempt to stretch a movie out more then it needs to be. It's not Lochlyn's fault tho, just bad decisions on how the plot and reason of his character was brought in in the first place.

If you are a die-hard fan of Austin, then there will be no stopping you seeing this movie, but for the average action fan, it's passable as a barely OK movie, but keep in mind the reason most people will be interested is it's Austin vs Trejo really... but in the end, I was disappointed with the result that this was the best someone could come up with. Because of Austin and Trejo, the film will be overrated and I expect other reviews will say ""The movies no good, but it's great to see Austin and Trejo in a film together"" which is not going to get a thumbs up from me just because they are in it. I won't give this movie even 3 stars just for being based on novelty... it's just not good enough for me to ever want to see again, or recommend it to anyone else.",1334448000,,3519,4.147877013177159
4993378,3,B006JN8798,"Ryan Varrett (Steve Austin) is an ex-cop who's family was murdered & therefore decided to take justice into his own hands hunting down the criminals responsible.  He checks into a hotel ran by a woman named Darcy (Serinda Swan) while looking for the local street gang ""The Circle"" ran by Drayke (Danny Trejo) who controls the town.  Drayke's brother Rek (Noel Gugliemi) goes looking for Ryan at Darcy's but ends up eventually killed by him in such as way that it causes ""The Circle"" to declare war.  From here, Ryan tries to continue his vendetta only to deal with some of police force being on Drayke's payroll, having to get physical with members of the gang, death of those who just happened to get involved by talking to the other side, the F.B.I. also investigating into what's going on, and his relationship with Darcy getting more personal.

Out of all of Steve Austin's movies, I like this one right behind The Condemned & Damage as the role really fit him & he played off Trejo well as it really came off as two badasses going against each other so I would check this out.",1334016000,3,1081,4.556701030927835

4993381,5,B006JN8798,this is a one of stone colds best movies it is kind ok the loner hero that walks in and helps clean up the town,1332288000,,111,3.48
4993382,5,B006JN8798,"Stone Cold Steve Austin plays Ryan Varrett, a cop that survived a gangland style execution and he's out looking for revenge against everyone that did the deed. Through his travels, he stumbles into the town of Hope and finds the corruption that is there. Danny Trejo plays Drake, the leader of the Circle, a biker gang that runs the town. Varrett kills the person that he is after, but has to stay around to take care of the biker gang.

The acting is decent for a movie of this type. There are no award winning performances in the movie, just a lot of people playing their part. Austin is an honorable vigilante. Trejo plays the ruthless, but honorable bad guy. The good guy cop that wants to clean up the town is at arms against the corrupt sheriff. There is a bereaved widow, the comic relief character, and the cocky henchman.

4993383,4,B006JN8798,"""I think you know why I'm here."" After the murder of his wife and child former cop Ryan Varrett (Austin) becomes obsessed with revenge and justice. When he gets to the town of Hope he finds what he is looking for. I have always wondered why wrestlers (who pretty much act for a living) have never been good movie actors. I liked Stone Cold when he was wrestling but as an actor he is quite bad. This is a hard movie to review for me. The opening five minutes were so bad I was laughing and wanted to turn it off, but the longer it went on the more I liked it. I'm not sure if it was because it was actually a good movie or if I just got used to it. I think I mainly liked it because of the idea. I loved ""Boondock Saints"" and while it's impossible to compare the two, any movie about a vigilante who doses out his own justice to those who fall through the cracks is OK with me. Overall, Steve Austin's best movie so far (which isn't saying much). I recommend this though. I surprisingly give it a B+.",1330473600,9,1000,4.055555555555555
4993384,5,B006JN8798,"The film opens with some slow metal music, and is perhaps a grindhouse ""light."" Ryan Varrett (Steve Austin) ""sneaks"" around in a Dodge GTX muscle machine, cruising Washington State (Seagal's territory). He plays a vigilante ex-cop who goes after the bad guys who killed his family and any other bad guys who know them. (Don't try this at home.) The film mixes dry humor with stone cold action. The first kill is a man hunting rabbits with an automatic weapon. He misses a bunny at about 10 yards. Austin crushes his neck and tosses him off a cliff. The cops describe the body as ""abstract art."" Austin has flashbacks to the killing (happens before movie starts) and the police are searching for the bunny killer. These provide a very minor subplot.

A waitress remarks, ""Canada, not much up that way but Canada."" I am laughing at the dialouge and I haven't figured out if the comedy is intentional. Austin ends up in Hope, Washington. ""Hope"" is a common name for symbolism or irony...normally from writers who couldn't come up with something better, or if they did, wouldn't think their audience could grasp it. Serinda Swan plays Darcy the local motel owner. She is a widow who smokes, drinks JD, and knows muscle machines.

Austin makes friends with the local bike club known as ""The Circle"" when he beats up a member who threatened to shoot a puppy (I love this stuff). Danny Trejo, in one of his ""rare"" bad guy appearances, plays the Drayke, the gang leader. Noel Gugliemi as Rex did a great job as a gang member. The gang has hobbies such as cage matches with electrified fences, drug manufacturing, and town terrorizing. It is the typical movie gang, one that runs guns but fights with tools. Stone Cold has other hobbies.

I enjoyed this action film. It had the right amount of action, humor (intentional and unintentional), and plot filler. It doesn't bother to give us any character build up as they all fit stereotypes. No plot twists, and if you seen enough of these, you can write the ending before the opening credits. As a fan of Austin, Trejo, vigilante films, and grindhouse it is worth a view. In the realistic scheme of things, this is not a five star movie, but I enjoyed it as much as one.

F-bomb, woman violence, CG explosions, Obama picture in police station, no sex, no nudity (Hey! It's Canadian.)",1330128000,14,2322,4.65609756097561

4993416,5,B006JN8798,Steve Austin is surprisingly a very believable actor to whatever part Steve plays. I do think Steve Austin may have taken charge about movies and parts that come his way. I have notice the same company that produce Recoil has been used in the movies of Steve Austin plus in this movie he was one of the producers which gives Steve a voice to the direction of the story. For the most part no one went on a four scream fest and again not  using sex to sale a movie and the movie's theme was not there. A movie that it's own talent is on display that you feel comfortable to watch. The movie reminded me of the western movies of where a stranger comes into a town looking to settle a score and to make right a injustice. I am curious about whatever films Mr. Austin that are coming soon or movies that are on DVD already and if they will stay family friendly or will Steve Austin give into fame and produce a movie that uses a never ending run of foul language and sexual what if's as it seems other stars have wander to so as to sale a movie that makes no sense.,1437523200,,1060,4.120772946859903

4993447,3,B006JN8798,"If you've seen any of Stone Cold's films, you know what to expect from Recoil.  Stone Cold is out for vengeance over his slain family, or friends, or all the BBQ meat that was wasted when they were shot- I'm not really sure. Stone Cold is way too manly and gruff to ever clearly articulate his true intentions. During Recoil's 90-some minutes, Stone Cold brings two things - the beat down and the body count. Exposition is an unnecessary consideration.

Reviewing Recoil on its own terms, I have to say it's a good film. The action doesn't really stop and certainly doesn't give way to the story. Danny Trejo also gives a suitably snarly performance as the leader of the biker gang and head bad guy. Like any worthy antagonist, he succeeds admirably in upping the level of carnage within film.

While low budget, the film is competently shot and the fight scenes are fairly well choreographed.  There are some scenes of mild torture, which may add a star to the tally above, depending on your point of view.

Stone Cold's performance is worthy of special mention. As opposed to just merely beating guys with his fists and strangling them, he employs a wider variety of weapons when dispatching his foes in this film. It's nice to see Stone Cold leave his comfort zone in an attempt to further develop his acting craft. He sets one dude on fire, which was cool to me because I've always wanted to do this.

I've given Recoil a three star rating because it was enjoyable. Sure it's not quite on the same level as other Stone Cold classics like Condemned or Damage, but it brings enough to the table in terms of sheer carnage for me to recommend.",1365292800,,1643,4.552542372881356

length, so you do not get bored and it is not too long.",1351036800,,149,4.137931034482759
4993459,5,B006JN8798,"Good movie. Lots of action.  Danny Trejo is always a good ""bad guy"".  It's predictable but a fun movie to watch.  If you are a Austin or Trejo fan you will like it.",1345507200,,164,3.909090909090909
4993460,3,B006JN8798,"The Picture quality of this BD Disk is stellar, with the sound almost as good.  The movie itself is alright, Its your basic revenge action movie.  Danny Trejo is what made me buy this movie & I would recommend it if its on sale again.",1344211200,,234,4.177777777777778
4993461,2,B006JN8798,"The plot was a rip-off of the old Punisher movie. The acting was two dimensional, and the dialogue was worse than cliche. This movie is well worth taking a pass on.",1338249600,,164,4.32258064516129

4993463,2,B006JN8798,"I only bought this for the extra features and because Danny Trejo was in it. The movie itself is way too drawn out, has crummy color, and needs a lot more action. Also, many of the guns (especially some of the muzzle flashes) looked terribly fake.",1335571200,,247,4.391304347826087
4993464,4,B006JN8798,"I love Steve Austin so it's pretty much a given that I loved this film especially since I think it's his best to date. Having the great Danny Trejo didn't hurt either.
It's an action packed, revenge fueled roller coaster ride. I love the fact that Steve Austin is almost like Jason or Michael Myers ,indestructible,He will take some licks but he keeps coming right back and just when you think he's road kill,think again.
I liked the character of Darci played by 'Serinda Swan "" as well..She's very pretty and a tough chick to boot.
All in all it's your basic Thugs kill Steve Austin's character 'Ryan Varrett's' family. They thinking him dead leave. He then goes on a rampage bringing murder an mayhem to anyone who gets in his way.
Loved it.",1335312000,2,743,4.552238805970149
8499446,1,B006JN8798,"Cant they hire one firearms expert for these movies? The man in the beginning who is hunting with that ridiculous AR platform has a LASER DESIGNATOR ON IT! for those who don't know what that is.... let me explain....Its used to project a laser dot onto a target, that a munition - bomb, missile, artillery shell - will home in on, in a system called laser guidance or semi-active laser homing. Theyre more powerful than typical laser pointers, often powerful enough to slightly burn skin, or to blind if you were to look directly into the beam, and they're usually in the infrared range, rather than visible light. This lets them pierce fog and smoke somewhat better while also making them harder to see.
Im just amazed they didn't use a nerf gun by accident.",1529971200,,759,4.62962962962963

8499448,4,B006JN8798,I like this movie.  Better than I thought.  Steve Austin rocked it.  Good story and Trello was the nasty bad guy that we expect.  Worth the watch for sure!!!!,1527724800,,158,4.344827586206897
8499449,4,B006JN8798,Good shoot 'em up type movie. Machete seemed a little more evil than in other movies. Good guy wins over bad guys kind of thing.,1527292800,,128,4.16

8499453,3,B006JN8798,"mediocre acting, revenge plot line, lots of unbelievable actions by the star, script was ok for what it was about but could have been better.  If I had it to do over again, I would not have wasted my time.  It left nothing for me to ever think about again or any characters I came to like or dislike.",1525478400,,300,4.067796610169491

8499455,4,B006JN8798,"Danny and Steve are great as always in this action thriller depicting the lone hero silent taking on the evil bikers.  One reviewer pointed out the actors inability to handle a gun rivaled his kid.  Yep, when it comes to firearms, everyone's an expert.  With that said, the deputy could have used some shooting instructions; but using that as a ratings basis is - well - dorked.",1524268800,,378,4.611940298507463
