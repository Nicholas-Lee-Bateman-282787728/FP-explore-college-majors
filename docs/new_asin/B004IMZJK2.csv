4387081,3,B004IMZJK2,"First, I'll admit I did not buy this DVD for relaxation purposes, but just for video footage of Hawaii scenes, so maybe my perspective is skewed. I didn't find it particularly relaxing. The DVD starts out with nice Hawaiian music in the background, but then changes to some sort of weird new-age stuff that doesn't really match the images on the screen. The images are beautiful enough, but there isn't a lot of variety. There are a LOT of repeat shots. It starts out with a view of a couple of chaise lounges under some palm trees and I think I saw that same image repeated three or four more times. I would have liked to see more footage of rainforest, maybe a luau, volcanoes, etc. So, overall it's OK just somewhat overpriced for what you get.",1271203200,13,747,4.45985401459854
4387082,5,B004IMZJK2,I watched it this afternoon and thought it was very relaxing.  I liked the music and of course the ocean and all the beautiful flowers and palm trees.  The sunsets were quite beautiful too.  I'd like to return to Hawaii someday.  I'm sharing it with some of the neighbors.,1265932800,5,272,4.489795918367347
4387083,5,B004IMZJK2,"A dear friend gave me this DVD as a gift and I love everything about it.  The colors are beautiful, the scenery is perfect and the scenes of crystal clear water remind me of past visits to Hawaii and other tropical destinations.  All of the shots were filmed in high definition and the detail is amazing.

The recording is very smooth and the photography is stellar.  Beautiful, soothing music and relaxing sounds of nature complete the experience.  I love the varied pace and occasional tinkling bells.  The sounds of nature such as rolling waves and gentle winds sound like they are coming through the window and I am there!

I like to use the DVD to relax before I go to sleep and as background music and scenery on my second monitor when I work in my home office.  Really, the DVD comes in handy for any situation where relaxation is helpful, such as when I come home from being a caretaker for my mother, during my morning stretching routine and before I check my blood pressure.

Some of my favorite images in the DVD are birds, lush rainforest, palm trees blowing in the breeze, plumaria and wild ginger flowers, waterfalls, koi swimming in patterns in ponds which relfect the blue sky and billowing clouds and serene sandy beaches.  All of the transitions are smooth and the images flow beautifully.  The music and nature sounds are the perfect accompaniment.  The DVD experience is like a virtual vacation!

Another really awesome feature is the DVD includes alpha, theta and delta brain wave frequencies, in the background and undetected.  The frequencies really work because the level of relaxation I feel after watching and listening to this DVD is much greater than the effect I get from other relaxation or meditation tapes.

I plan to buy this DVD for my sister who is going through a divorce.  The deep relaxation, and beautiful scenery and music/nature sounds, will transport her and her two young children to a happy place away from stress and fear ..... if only for a short time period.  And, the DVD is not short.  The total run time is 83 minutes - a big bang for the buck!

Everyone should have this DVD to help with relaxation and to experience overwhelming feelings of wellbeing and peace.  The DVD uses the healing power of nature to rejuvenate and refresh your mind, body and spirit.  I know you will enjoy, and appreciate, this fabulous relaxation experience.  I highly recommend this DVD.  The pictures, music and experience are top notch .... just be aware you may have an overwhelming desire to visit Hawaii in the near future.",1264636800,17,2557,4.70945945945946

We were expecting just another pretty video of Hawaii, but were pleasantly surprised by this breathtaking video and gorgeous music.  We love Hawaii and truly enjoy the great variety of incredible scenery, nature and amazing wildlife and feel like we are there.  The colors are stunning, crisp and clear.  We also like the option of playing the video with either just the music and nature sounds, or with the guided meditation which we find to be very uplifting and relaxing.  It also helps us relax after a stressful day at work and is a wonderful aid for my insomnia.  We highly recommend this Hawaiian video.  We plan to have it playing in the background when we have parties as the scenery is absolutely spectacular and the music soothing and relaxing.",1263772800,10,983,5.985714285714286

8430921,2,B004IMZJK2,Too much humanity in this video--I wanted ALL nature.. I would like to buy a CD with just the music--it is very relaxing.. Please advise how to obtain only the music on this DVD on a CD and how much it would cost? Thank you.,1429056000,,224,4.0
8430922,2,B004IMZJK2,Beautiful scenery!  Very relaxing to watch God's creation! The water scenes especially are breathtaking.  Highly recommend this product for the beauty and relaxation!,1363824000,,166,6.173913043478261

8430925,5,B004IMZJK2,"Blu-ray looks very relaxing, but when I opened it... the disc was missing. Just requested another be shipped.

Serenity Moments was very responsive and sent another copy right away. Great customer service!",1341619200,,205,5.40625
8430926,4,B004IMZJK2,"My husband has Early Onset Alzheimer's and lives in a memory care community. Lately he has become highly agitated with angry outbursts. He loves music but even his favorite music videos that are in his room wouldn't calm him down. I did a search and found this. We LOVED going to Hawaii every year and I hoped the calming music would help.

It worked like magic. I'd pop this in and he would indeed calm right down. The scenes are beautiful - the Blu-ray is crisp and clear as if you were standing on the island. Incredible.

I would have rated it 5 stars if there were more scenes instead of repeated scenes. There certainly is FAR more to been seen on the islands. The music is a bit new-agey for my taste, but at this point I just want some peace for my darling husband. His nurses and caregivers leave it in the player all the time now and everyday when I visit I find it playing and many times I find a couple of caregivers in there watching it too! I am back ordering some more because some of them wanted a copy for themselves!

I also ordered more of the other versions of the Serenity Moments Blu-ray's for his variety. Not that it may matter to him, but it matters to me.

If you love the islands and want to ""be"" there when you physically cannot, I highly recommend this. It is very relaxing and makes me want to run to the airport!",1330128000,5,1343,4.234375
8430927,3,B004IMZJK2,"The video of Hawaii is beautiful on this DVD, but what starts out as Hawaiian music quickly changes to some new age mystic sound that creeps me out. But the pictures are amazing so I just turn off the sound and play my own music. Whoever produced this might have put a couple extra sound tracks on it, so if you don't want the defaulted style you had other options. I have a few of these Hawaiian scenery dvds and this is not my favorite.

The company shipping it was great. Excellent service.",1317686400,3,493,4.301075268817204
8430928,3,B004IMZJK2,"Music and Camera work is great.
The person doing the Guided Meditation part ruins it by bringing up her Religious concepts.
Otherwise a good DVD.",1311811200,3,145,4.84
8430929,5,B004IMZJK2,"I watched this DVD when I was under enormous stress, and it did work its magic on me.

The combination of music and spectacular scenery draws you into the world you're seeing. There is no dialogue/story/plot that demands your attention, like in a movie theater. Instead, it's like being on a beach, warm sun above, gentle breezes, watching the waves, hearing the sounds...experiencing life without thinking about the insanity in the world.

I found it best to view the DVD alone: no outside distractions, no people coming in and out of the room. Turn off your computer, turn off your phone, put on the headset...and escape for awhile.

It's truly like a vacation, and long after I watched it, I remembered it as a vacation.

Highly recommended.",1293926400,7,744,4.834645669291339
8430930,5,B004IMZJK2,"This DVD was exactly what I was looking for. I have problems falling asleep, and find it almost impossible to do without a movie in. The beautiful scenery and calming music were exactly what I was hoping for, and it's also great to have on just as background ambiance in the house. Excellent Find!!",1284768000,3,298,4.537037037037037
