No one else in the Netherlands nows the Big Phat Band I think but they are the best there is.

I hope that they will tour in Europe soon.

The movie is a great combine of a good christmas story ( scrooge ) in an new jacket.

Fun for everyone and special for musiclovers as me.

2633861,4,B000HC2LH6,"There have been so many times these past few years, where Warner Brothers has tried to revamp its Looney Tunes lineup, to appeal to a younger generation. Unfortunately, that has failed miserably with last year's WB cartoon series Loonatics, and the movie Looney Tunes: Back In Action. Although myself as being a die hard fan of the animated gems, I've never seen the looney lost. Recebtly, Warner Brother brought the classics back in style with their fourth volume of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, which definitely appeals to die hard fans of Bugs, Daffy, and all those funny characters. Now, a straight to video parody of a favorite holiday movie comes to home video.

Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas, is a delightful, and silly take on Dickens' classic A Christmas Carol. In the story, Daffy, plays as the manager of a department store called Lucky Duck, where he acts as if he is Scroogy against Porky Pig, and his other co-workers. In the film, Daffy is visited by spirits, each filled with humor from Granny & Tweety as the ghosts of the past, who show how saddened Daffy is, without having a family of his own, and gets lost in the shuffle from even being adopted in a orphanage, to the wild and wooly Tazmanian Devil, the fright of the future who is goofy as he debuted over 50 years ago. For Daffy, he has the real ego, and humpor to play a better animated Scrooge, than Scrooge McDuck did in Disney's Mickey's Christmas Carol years ago. The DVD has a great deal of humor, but it is sadly a bit too short for die hard Looney Tunes fanatics.

All in all, I just wish a bit more could've been added to Bah Humduck! A Looney Tunes christmas. Still, it is one of the best original holiday movies I've seen within the past several years. If you haven't seen the Looney Tunes classics of the past, you might not consider this as a must buy. I loved watching this recently on Cartoon Network, and it was looney laughter.

2633862,5,B000HC2LH6,"Unlike the other two reviewers, I bought this for my kids and we all loved it. It's fun to be able to share Bugs and the gang with my kids after being raised on the Looney Tunes characters. I especially liked the Big Phat Band movie score and the bonus features - watching the band record one of the songs from the soundtrack. Pretty cool.",1164672000,5,339,4.230769230769231
2633863,2,B000HC2LH6,"The movie wasn't what I expected. It didn't have the clever humor that the old Looney Tunes shorts possessed. The voice characterizations were  awful. Nobody compares to the talent of Mel Blanc. They also could have utilized some of the other characters better, instead of making them just extras in the background.",1164585600,8,315,5.0576923076923075
2633864,3,B000HC2LH6,"If you are sensitive about your children seeing TV violence you may want to skip this DVD.  Being a long time Looney Tunes fan I was thrilled when I came across a new movie.  Sadly something is lacking in this film.  The wisecracking characters were gone and have been replaced with unimaginative diagloge and an excessive amount of slapstick violence.  Of course one would expect a certain amount of slapstick, it is Looney Tunes after all but it was way over done.  I suppose it's just easier for Bugs to beat Daffy about the head with a candy cane than write something witty. I guess all good things come to an end.",1163980800,8,618,4.482142857142857

2633871,5,B000HC2LH6,"This is one of my favorite versions of A Christmas Carol. I watch it several times a year, during the Christmas season.

Perhaps I like it so much because I watched Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig often as a child.

It also includes some of my other favorite, nostalgic characters, including Pepe Le Pew, Speedy Gonzalez, Yosemite Sam, Elmer Fudd, Marvin the Martian, and the Tasmanian Devil!

Other famous Looney Toon cartoon characters featured are Tweety Bird, Sylvester the Cat, Roadrunner, and Wile E. Coyote.

Bugs plays a version of Fred; Sylvester, Jacob Marley; Tweety and his Grandma, Ghosts of Christmas Past; Yosemite Sam, Ghost of Christmas Present; Tasmanian Devil, Ghost of Christmas future.  Porky's daughter, Priscilla Pig, serves as the Tiny Tim.

This one of the funniest, most endearing and nostalgic versions of A Christmas Carol, especially for people who grew up watching Looney Toons.

By the way, there is another version of A Christmas Carol, titled Bugs Bunny's Looney Christmas Tales, which features Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam, not to be confused with this one.  In that version, Bugs plays himself pretending to be a Ghost, and Yosemite Sam, the Scrooge.",1478908800,,1177,5.062176165803109
2633872,5,B000HC2LH6,"If you enjoy the classic Looney Tunes and any good take on A Christmas Carol, Bah Humduck deserves a spot in your holiday home video collections! Whoever thought Daffy Duck makes a better Scrooge than Scrooge McDuck (via Mickey's Christmas Carol), obviously hasn't seen or heard how money-hungry Eugene Krabs from SpongeBob has been, as of the debut of SpongeBob's 10th season in October 2016; his constant money-hunger puts Daffy AND Scrooge's greed to shame! In this movie, Daffy acts more like Mr. Krabs but still being holiday-hateful like Scrooge. Fortunately, Daffy keeps getting what's coming to him time and again, right to the finale! The year 2016 is also this hour-long Looney holiday classic's 10th anniversary, when I typed this. It was also one of the last great achievements of Joe Alaskey, who was filling in for Mel Blanc for some of his Looney Tunes characters, even when Blanc was alive via Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988, who sadly passed on last February, during production of Tom and Jerry's Return to Oz. Why not pay tribute to Alaskey's passing by adding Bah Humduck to your holiday home video collections today! ""Bah, Humduck!"" It's a shame that Bugs Bunny's Looney Christmas Tales, from 1979, never got released on its own DVD, even with this as a bonus program!",1478217600,,1289,4.890410958904109

I guess we are so use to the voices and dialogue from the original Looney Toons shows that the differences in this show are a little hard to not focus on while trying to enjoy the story. It's not bad, but just not all that great either.

For those young enough who didn't grow up with the original Looney Toons playing constantly on TV, it's a cute Christmas show and you/they will probably like it. For anyone who spent their younger years always hearing the same Looney Toon phrases by the same actors in all the same cartoons, the voice differences in this show kind of make it hard to enjoy.",1456358400,3,872,4.343558282208589

Again overall very well done. One thing I do not appreciate is the word butt inserted into the script. Children watching shouldn't have to hear that.. didn't add a thing to the quality or comedy. That is the only real negative... okay except that the real reason for Christmas is really not stated. The birth of Jesus as savior and sacrifice is the true reason for the season!

2634011,4,B000HC2LH6,"It's a little weird to see Daffy rather than Scrooge McDuck playing the part of a Scrooge, but Daffy proves to be even more of a greedy curmudgeon than his uncle ever was.  As the head of a huge department store, Daffy is rolling in the Christmas profits while his employees work multiple overtimes and suffer Daffy's tyrannical abuse and endless demands.  He refuses Marvin the Martian's request for time off to visit his Martian family, has no pity for Elmer Fudd's thirty-something triple shifts in a row, and he won't even let his assistant assistant Manager Porky have Christmas off to spend with his daughter Priscilla.  Clearly, this looks like a job for Bugs Bunny, who does indeed show up to give Daffy the business and to set the stage for several ghostly visitors determined to show Daffy the error of his ways.

Virtually all of the Looney Tunes characters are represented here.  I was especially pleased to see Speedy Gonzalez, as he has been the victim of much censorship as of late, and I must say that Yosemite Sam makes a most memorable Ghost of Christmas Present.  Admittedly, Daffy's transformation is a little lacking in depth and sincerity, but I still found elements of the ending quite touching, especially Priscilla's interactions with Daffy.  Thus, I do believe this latest Looney Tunes adaptation of A Christmas Carol does communicate the main theme of Dickens' story - and it does so in an atmosphere of great humor.  I think young and old fans alike will find Bah Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas quite entertaining.",1324339200,,1545,4.825757575757576
2634012,1,B000HC2LH6,"Very disappointed by the movie. The commodification of the Tiny Tim character was saddening. I understand that Death is not an easy subject to deal with, particularly with young audiences. But to reduce the character to ""I'm very thoughtful, but am entirely satisfied by pointless consumer goods"" is ridiculous. There must have been some other way to deal with that aspect of the story. After all, Dickens was arguing for humanity and the importance of relationships over material. This movie seems keen to cash in on a piece of Christmas tradition, while grossly distorting it. My children will not be watching this again.",1323648000,5,623,5.058252427184466

2634014,2,B000HC2LH6,"The animation in this movie (a ""Looney Tunes"" adaptation of ""A Christmas Carol"") is fairly solid. The voice work is also fairly solid. The writing, pacing, etc., is mediocre. At 46 minutes, this movie feels both rushed and slowly paced at the same time. It feels rushed not only because of the short running time, but also because virtually none of the elements that give ""A Christmas Carol"" its emotional impact are there. By the time the movie is over, you feel cheated out of a great story. It feels slowly paced because the story moves along with virtually no excitement and none of the trademark ""Looney Tunes"" zany humor. It feels like a quickly made effort made to appeal to little kids, as opposed to fans of the original Looney Tunes. There is really no ""heart"" or ""human touch"" in this movie. Even the moments which are supposed to be ""touching"" fall flat because the viewer is given no opportunity for a connection with the characters or storyline. It is ironic that they used this shallow approach, doing little more than cashing in on the popularity of ""A Christmas Carol"" and the popularity of the Looney Tunes, because the message of ""A Christmas Carol"" is to care about people more than money. This theme rings especially false in this movie. At the beginning, you are abruptly dropped into the world of Daffy Duck, greedy store owner. Bugs Bunny pays Daffy a visit and says, ""You know that bad things happen to people that hate Christmas!"" Bugs then warns Daffy that ghosts could be visiting him soon. No other details are given about why ghosts will be visiting Daffy. In the original ""A Christmas Carol,"" you truly understand why Scrooge needs to be redeemed before the ghosts show up. In this version, when the ghosts start to arrive, you don't completely understand why because virtually no setup is given. The whole premise feels pretty half-baked because Daffy is never shown doing anything that harsh to his employees. The ghosts visit Daffy for about five minutes each. Daffy is quickly repentant and treats his employees better. When the ghosts visit him and he repents, he says calmly, ""I would like a second chance."" In the original story, Scrooge is absolutely at the breaking point before he repents and turns from his greedy ways. With Daffy, you have a feeling he is simply inconvenienced by the ghosts bothering him and would just like to get a good night's sleep. Daffy doesn't do that much to redeem himself after he reforms and still doesn't seem to be that benevolent at the end. In this movie we have a ""Scrooge"" who is not shown to be that bad at the beginning, not that repentant when he decides to reform, and doesn't do that much to show he is good at the end! So we are left with a ""Christmas Carol"" that misses virtually every opportunity for an emotional connection with the audience (which is what this story usually does best). This movie had a lot of potential but the execution was mediocre at best.",1320624000,3,2948,4.671153846153846

2634029,2,B000HC2LH6,"When you've got a mere 46 minutes to tell a highly condensed version of a classic Xmas story then it's obviously a good idea to cram as much story in there are possible and try your hardest to create a cosy, Xmas atmosphere. There's not much of that to be had in Bah Humduck! Cartoon writers have been milking the Christmas Carol goat for years. Modern spins on the story rarely work (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scrooged/dp/6305609764/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scrooged</a>&nbsp;being a meta-fictional exception) and Bah Humduck distances itself from the source material so much that it is barely recognizable. Daffy stars as the boss of a huge department store who loves exploiting people in order to make many Xmas dollars. The Ebeneezer Scrooge story is shoehorned into this setting, but the colour schemes are far too high key and bright to evoke a true Xmas feel. Almost the entire feature is set inside this bland environment.

Far too much time is given to hijinks utterly void of comic timing. The first 11 minutes, which establish Daffy as a bad boss, are really nothing but him flying across the screen and smashing into various things. It's not funny in the slightest.

I feel that the people who made this were only interested in churning out a quick, easy product and had no interest in making it something special.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Charlie-Brown-Christmas-Blu-ray/dp/B002HQZX9I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Charlie Brown Christmas [Blu-ray</a>] was half the length and has been consistently popular for well over forty years.

A decade or three ago, Disney created ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" with Uncle Scrooge as - well - Scrooge, Mickey as Bob Crachit, and Jiminy Cricket as the ghost of Christmas past. It was schmalzy, but then so was the original, to whose spirit it was mostly faithful.

Now comes WB with their own take on ""A Christmas Carol"", and it is not only untrue to the Dickens tradition; it is a profanation of the Looney Tunes tradition! The action is unimaginative and mechanical, the representation of the characters, while accurate in detail, is mostly lifeless, and the voices (with the shining exception of June Foray recreating Grannie) are often just wrong.

It is possible to recreate the genius of Termite Terrace; WB did it with ""Looney Tunes, Back in Action"", but ""Bah Humduck"" really never comes close.",1227312000,9,899,4.787096774193548
