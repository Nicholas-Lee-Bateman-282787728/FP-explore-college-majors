8591022,5,B00D9RP19G,"We should all be grateful to Alexandra de Borchgrave for creating this third book in her series of poetry.  This latest book and accompanying CD of her poetry readings, set to beautiful classical music, is a transforming experience which expresses love, kindness, and a sense of caring and hope.  The author shows a unique sensitivity which touches one's heart.  It is visually stunning and the poems, the music and the soothing voice of her narration are transporting.  We are taken from this chaotic world to a place where nature is omnipresent in the form of birds, flowers, trees and beautiful images full of color.  This ""heavenly place"" is filled with hope, love and acceptance of things beyond our control.  We feel peaceful knowing we are not alone.  The author is a person who is clearly very caring and concerned about the state of todays world.

This lovely and touching book is a must have for those going thru a trauma or anyone who is grieving or who has experienced loss.  The author leaves us with a positive message thru her deep belief in the power of faith, healing and spirituality.  The poems in this book have touched my heart.  This is the perfect combination of music, art and literature and would appeal to people of all ages.  The three books together make a beautiful gift but each stands on its own.
