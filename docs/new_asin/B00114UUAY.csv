8240580,3,B00114UUAY,Covers lots of different subjects with some interesting facts but I feel thier is to much filler and repeats narration to often for me.,1379548800,,135,4.666666666666667
8240581,5,B00114UUAY,"Very good, informative series.  Only thing I fault is the editing, which includes referring to .30 caliber machine guns as 30 mm weapons, .50 caliber as 50 mm weapons, and on at least one occasion referring to the 7.62 (.30 caliber) M60 as a 60mm machine gun.  I would think a series of this type would have somebody editing it that would know the difference between inch and metric calibers.",1286496000,8,392,4.585714285714285

8240585,5,B00114UUAY,"I'd never seen this show before and bought it on a whim cause I love military documentaries. What a treat; it was WAY better than I expected and a bargain. I also liked how they start at the modern evolvement of different weapons and trace the history and different componenets that go into bringing it about. If you've ever seen the show ""Connections"" on PBS you'll recognize the presentation format and really like it. I'd give this a show 10 stars if it was an option.",1209340800,14,471,4.488372093023256
