This show is great in the fact the Yusuke doesn't always win, unlike some shows where you know the 'hero' will always win the fight no matter what. Yusuke actually gets his butt kicked multiple times, he's not some all-powerful fighter.

Love this anime!!!",1361923200,,375,4.434782608695652
7961726,5,B00006673I,"Yusuke Urameshi is a high school delinquent. He doesn't go to class, and he's always getting in fights. One day he is trying to save a boy that is about to be hit by a car, he is killed instead. He is approached by a pretty girl flying on a broom. Her name is Botan, and she's the Grimm Reaper. She offers him a chance to regain his life. After coming back to life Yusuke becomes a Spirit Detective. He gain spiritual powers and hunts down rogue apparitions that cause trouble for the living world. He is joined by his friend Kuwabara, the demons Hiei and Kurama. Together they fight off the deadly demons that seek to destroy the world.

Hiei's sister, Yukina, is being held by a crime boss. She can produce jewels from her tears, and the bad guy is willing to force her to cry. While storming the fort Yusuke and the others encounter one of the deadliest enemies imaginable.

This is  a great series. It has lots of cool characters, good animation, voice acting, and a very engrossing story. It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time. It has a bit of a Dragonball Z vibe to it, and everyone likes that. I highly recommend Yu Yu Hakusho to every anime fan, it's simply amazing.",1353110400,,1465,4.225

7961728,5,B00006673I,"WARNING! This review may contain spoilers for episodes 1-21. If you do not wish to be spoiled then stop reading and check out these awesome episodes first! Okay, now on to the review!

Yusuke and the gang have finally defeated the deadly Four Saint Beasts in Demon World and restored humanity to normal. Now Yusuke can finally take that much needed vacation of his, right? Wrong!

Koenma sends Hiei to deliver a mysterious unmarked VHS tape to Yusuke informing him of his next big case; and this one's even more dangerous than his last mission!

An ice apparation named Yukina has been kidnapped and is being held prisoner by the greedy human crime lord Tarukane who wants the precious jewels created from her tears to get rich! Yusuke, Kuwabara, and Botan set off for Tarukane's stronghold to rescue Yukina. But why isn't Hiei allowed to know? And what will happen when Yusuke and Kuwabara come face to face with Tarukane's new bodyguards---The Toguro Brothers!

Overall, this DVD isn't bad at all. The fights are very interesting and surprisingly very funny too and the climatic final fight between Yusuke and Kuwabara and the Toguro Brothers will keep fans on the edge of their seats till the very end! The humour is top-notch, classic YYH humour! There were a few parts in this DVD that really had me cracking up! And for all you Hiei fans, let's just say ep. 25 is especially good! ;)

My only grip about this disc is the severe lack of Kurama! He definitely needs more screen time! It kind of felt like the writers kept him out of most of the story deliberately in order to give Yusuke and Kuwabara more character development/screentime. But, there is a really cute moment between Hiei and Kurama in the last episode (of this disc) in which many rabid, crazy yaoi fangirls will find inspiration for their very interesting fanfics. *lol*

The four episodes on this DVD are episodes 22-25:

Lamenting Beauty
The Toguro Brothers Gang
The Deadly Triad
Kuwabara's Fight of Love

I really enjoyed watching this DVD! The humor is excellent and the fights bloody and exciting and the conclusion is very cool too! I definitely recommend it to any YYH fan who wants to collect the whole series! It is definitely worth the price! So what are you waiting for? Get on over to your local Sam Goody, Suncoast, fye, or wherever and buy this enjoyable DVD! You won't be disappointed! ;)",1221350400,,2375,4.706024096385542
7961729,5,B00006673I,"Yu Yu Hakusho: The Spirit Detective: Vol. &: - Rescue Yukina contains four episodes, 22 - 25.  Here the lovely aqua-haired ice apparition is introduced.  Kuwabara instantly falls in love with her when he sees her on the mission videotape sent by Koenma.  His ""mission of love"" is fueled by his desire to meet the girl he feels will be his true love.  Little does Kuwabara know that Yukina is also his arch-rival Hie's sister!

Yukina is being held prisoner by a despicable Yakuza boss who is not only aware of the Spirit World, but employs demons.  He wants Yukina's tears, which turn into priceless pearl-like jewels.

This DVD has a LOT of laughs mostly provided by Koenma and George!",1115683200,2,686,4.666666666666667
7961730,5,B00006673I,I love this VHS because Kuwabara makes a moron of himself and there's a lot of Hiei in it! What more could you want?,1078358400,,116,3.875
7961731,5,B00006673I,"I ordered this at Christmas, it was a nice gift for myself, I love watching it around my friends, its nice but it does have alot of bloodshed in it. Also it shows what Yukina goes through during the movie, and we all know that Hiei and Yukina are brother and sister. I was disappointed I saw it on Cartoon Network thinking it would stop there but the dark tournament came, but yes, Rescue Yukina is a great DVD with four episodes in it, plus there is alot of stuff packed into it. Watch it in Japanese, or English, and also in Subtitles. Also it also shows Kuwabara acting goofy which I think you all know he usually does that. Anyway if you buy it...good choice.",1053216000,2,663,4.26984126984127
7961732,5,B00006673I,"Okay, this is four edited, dubbed episodes of Yu Yu Hakusho.  It is the start of seasons two, but it is also a complete adventure on its own.
Yukina, an ""ice apparition"" has been captured by a human who looks less human  than Yukina... (He has a very lumpy head -- quite strange.)  Anyway he and his cronies want to make Yukina cry because when she does, her tears become jewels.  This is more serious than it sounds.  She is basically locked away as a prisoner.  They are willing to torture her for these ""tear gems.""
Our heros Yusuke and Kuwabara are sent to (surprise, surprise) ""rescue Yukina.""  Botan comes along, and Koenma and Kurama watch from Spirit World,  occasionally giving commentary.  And Hiei is stalking around.  For some reason Koenma doesn't want him to know about Yukina.  hm...
I was surprised they managed to wrap it up in four episodes.  I thought it was going to take much longer.  The fighting tournament elements are done pretty well, with each fight (except the last), finished quickly, because of our heros' increase in power since seasons one.
There are some funny bits (Kuwabara's fighting headband of love), some very serious parts, some sweet parts, and some mystery.  The story seems to take up as much, or nearly as much, as the fighting tournament aspect.
If you liked the first season on TV, go ahead and give it a try -- although the part about the birds is very sad!",1045699200,,1404,4.608870967741935
7961733,5,B00006673I,"This once again great to watch. It's funny
and hurt warming. Yusuke & Kuwabara & Boton
 head out to a evil human that stoled a
demon from her home. This demon can make
rare jewels from her tears. They tourcher her
to cry. That's sad right. Well you never guess
 who is her brother. Unless you watch the
 movie. Well Kuwabara falls in love with the
 demon Yukina. What a beautiful name yes. Well
 this doesn't show that much of Hiei or Kurama,
but it's still good and it's still funny as hell.
 Yu Yu Hakusho is my BEST ANIME EVER. Well this
may give you a sick to your stomach, when you
find out what one of the characters are. Nasty.
 ^_^. Well later fans see what happens with Yusuke &
 Kuwabara try to save Yukina from the Bad Guys.

7961734,5,B00006673I,"In this volume of the great anime Yu Yu Hakusho, Yusuke's back from Genkai's training and recieves a video tape from Hiei with the details of a new mission from Koenma. He and Kuwabara have to save a koorime or female ice demon who was captured by a greedy business man Tarukane who wanted to invest on the Tear Gems that koorimes can produce with their tears. Kuwabara falls head over heels for the koorime named Yukina who turns out to be Hiei's twin sister (but Kuwa never finds out) and so starts the humorous rivalry between Kuwabara and Hiei ^_^ Yusuke, Kuwabara and Botan go to Tarukane's mansion, and have to fight off demons at the gate, and also have to face 3 stronger ones once inside the mansion. But all those demons were prepared by the 2 Toguro Brothers that Tarukane hired. The infamous Toguro Brothers are really powerful, the older one can transform himself into a weapon and the younger one can become stronger by his muscles. Yusuke and Kuwabara manage to defeat the brothers somehow... or do they? Recommended to Hiei fans, cuz it's his sis's first appearence, and you also get to see his soft side ^_^ Though the downside to it is that Hiei and Kurama's appearences are quite brief.",1033948800,20,1205,4.583333333333333
