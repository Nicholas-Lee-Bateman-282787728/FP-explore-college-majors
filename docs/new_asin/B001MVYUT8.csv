3701567,5,B001MVYUT8,"""Touch the Top of the World""  is the amazing, true story of Erik Weihenmayer (Peter Facinelli), a rock and ice climber who overcame seemingly insurmountable odds to become the first blind man to reach the top of Mt. Everest.  Diagnosed at age three with a rare eye disease, Eric still led a normal life, thanks to parents who continually challenged him.  He succeeded in climbing the Seven Summits -- the highest mountains on the seven continents.  Fewer than 100 mountaineers have accomplished this feat.  In addition, Erik became proficient at paragliding and skiing.  The film is inspirational and features some breathtaking photography.  Dermot Mulroney, Emily Watson, and Gretchen Mol costar.  There are no extras on this DVD.",1235779200,6,731,5.188034188034188

8322162,2,B001MVYUT8,"This is a nice story about a blind man who climbed Mount Everest. But, a better DVD of this climb is the documentary called, ""Farther than the Eye can See"". It is so much better to see the real thing. He and his dad are amazing people. Buy it.",1317686400,4,243,3.979591836734694

8322164,5,B001MVYUT8,"Touch the Top of the World is based on an incredible and inspiring true story about Erik Weihenmayer. The story follows his life from childhood, when he lost his eyesight due to a rare disease, through his amazing climb to the top of Mount Everest. This script is well written but still could have been a little too sentimental if not for the truly superb acting. The entire cast did really solid work but there are two that truly stand out. The phenomenal Peter Facinelli (Twilight Saga, Nurse Jackie) does a wonderful job as Erik. He is completely convincing portraying Erik's concern and determination during the unimaginably dangerous trek up Everest. Bruce Campbell (Burn Notice) is also excellent as Erik's loving, supportive father. This one is definitely worth your time.",1288396800,3,779,5.0
8322165,5,B001MVYUT8,"Touch The Top Of The World - there is only one word that I can think of that would describe this wonderful movie....INSPIRATIONAL!!! This movie is based off of a true story...an autobiography of a man named Erik Weihenmayer. He is a blind man who has over come so many objects. Mr. Erik Weihenmayer has proven over and over again that anyone can do anything and concur it. He has shown that if you put your mind to it, you can do it. He gives a new meaning to trusting your body senses.

Peter Facinelli (played Erik Weihenmayer) was terrific! If I didn't know who Peter Facinelli was before this movie...I would have thought that he was really blind...that is how believable he was.

If you love inspirational movies...you will love this one and want to add it to your collection!",1279065600,,781,4.531914893617022
