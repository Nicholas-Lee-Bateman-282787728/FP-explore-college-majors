8374354,4,B002MZZTL6,"One of the better post-Lang Mabuse movies, but the quality of the DVD is only passable.  I am, however, thankful that it is available.  It is dubbed in English.  Certainly one has to be familiar with the Dr. Mabuse story, or the earlier films, to really understand what the character in this film is about.",1526169600,,306,4.527272727272727

8374357,4,B002MZZTL6,"Fritz Lang's Dr Mabuse films are thrilling masterpieces of suspense and action. But the Mabuse films he wasn't associated with, while lacking in Lang's style and sophistication, are darn good entertainment. They have action and film-noir mystery, fast-moving plots and inventive ideas. As the title suggests, Mabuse in this one challenges Scotland Yard with a weapon that can make anyone do anything he wants, including kill others and himself. The violence in an audacious, deadly finale will leave you aghast when he controls the armed coppers.",1363824000,4,546,5.3604651162790695
8374358,3,B002MZZTL6,"I am a fan of Dr. Mabuse and have now seen all of the Mabuse movies.  Sorry, but this one is not one of the better ones.  The print is a bit fuzzy and the story just isn't that good.  The concept (the ""device"") is pretty good but the dialog is often stupid or childish.  The plot development is not very good and some things of interest are not explained.  Definitely one of the weaker entries in the Mabuse legend.  Try ""The 1000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse"" or even ""The Return of Dr. Mabuse"" for a much better example of a more modern Mabuse movie.",1342310400,3,542,4.114285714285714
8374359,5,B002MZZTL6,"I am thrilled with this purchase, although the price was a little high, the quality equals the buy. Anyone who remembers the Mabuse movies, should buy this series, it is like watching it for the first time. Truly, Kevin Boyd",1276992000,5,224,4.625
