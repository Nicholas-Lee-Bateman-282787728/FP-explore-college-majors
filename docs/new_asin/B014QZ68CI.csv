8731629,3,B014QZ68CI,"We're a Thomas family...have most of the movies and DVD's, so naturally when this came out - we had to get it to add to the collection.  NOT what I was expecting.  In fact, the latest couple Thomas films - including the Christmas Carol DVD, surprised me.  They changed some of the character voices from previous DVD's and although the kids didn't seem to notice or mind (it's hard to tell if they did or not)....it just wasn't the same to me.  The stories aren't bad, and I could be over-reacting to the change of voice cast...but it just doesn't seem the same.  Don't get me wrong, we still enjoy the classic Thomas...when it was still a model railway and was narrated by the one person throughout - but I don't know...certain characters have a certain tone that was completely missed now.  OH!  And not to mention that the previous Mr. Perkins segments are now completely gone!!  I didn't mind them cutting back on his segments with some fun puzzle questions...but to do away with him completely, again, didn't seem the same.  We will continue to add to our collection...but I think they need to either go back to the pervious cast, or recast the couple that they changed (which includes: Thomas, Percy, James, Sir Topham Hatt, and Diesel)",1451520000,5,1241,4.63013698630137
