8631272,5,B00H9TZZBO,Absolutely fantastic! A must see. One of the best movies about climbing ever made. Filmed in 1968.,1506124800,,98,4.823529411764706
8631273,5,B00H9TZZBO,"no rock climber myself, this is a fascinating glimpse of how it was done ""old school"" with hemp, leather and plenty of pitons. equally fascinating was the extraordinary lengths that were necessary for the cameraman to capture the action. no hovering drones, no helmet mounted video, no telephoto shots in those days!

look for the scene where one of the climbers is jumping up and down on a 2 foot wide ledge, hundreds of feet above the ground, in order to wedge himself into a sleeping bag. look for the expression on his face at the moment he realizes he isn't tied in. hilarious.",1427932800,2,582,4.596153846153846

8631275,5,B00H9TZZBO,"As an old trad climber all my climbing life, (after discovering that climbers used ropes, belays, protection etc only after a large plummet ended my no ropes, no protection ( I had assumed that climbers must never have made mistakes and come off/ fallen until my fall at 22, after a ""life"" of climbing anything that took my fancy and that looked reasonable! I had never lived in a house with TV until 1997) climbing, This film brought across the sheer adventure and beauty of long routes and big exposure that I remember so well. Great film/portrayal, Raud.",1422576000,2,557,4.6938775510204085
8631276,5,B00H9TZZBO,"I am very happy to see this superb DVD, long awaited, of the original 1978 film.  A new friend introduced me to rock-climbing in Yosemite in the early 70's, when the swami-belt and diaper-sling were in use, helmets were not --- and what a primitive time that was. And yet even today, although the 'pitons' are gone (replaced by nuts, stoppers, cams etc.), there remains the identical exposure, the grind, the subtle satisfactions, and the ridiculous night-bivouacs of a climb of El Capitan.  What is perhaps most amazing is that the actual filming, according to Wikipedia, was done in 1968 and 1969.  At that time, not only was the equipment primitive, but the route up the Nose was not a 'perfectly known map' like it is today.",1402444800,3,728,4.716535433070866
8631277,5,B00H9TZZBO,"I was extremely happy to find that the original VHS tape, which I own an early copy of was painstakingly transferred to digital video including blue-ray.

This film is not full of hero shots, not full of free soloing and is humble compared with many modern films on Yosemite climbing. But, it documents in amazing detail what it's like to climb the nose route on El Capitan, still one of the classic big wall rock climbs on earth by three pioneering and excellent climbers.

The cinematography by Glen Denny is incredible as is the sound reproduction. This climb was made before the invention of ""clean climbing"" so the climbers are carrying pitons and hammers and a lot of heavy gear and that gear clanks around, and all of those clanks are recorded and in the movie. Of course, Glen Denny also did the climb with a lot of heavy film and sound gear which was and remains a feat in itself.

I climbed extensively in Yosemite ten years after this movie was shot and this is a realistic portrayal of what doing a big wall was like and in many ways, continues to be like. Anyone who hung out and climbed in Yosemite will love this movie. Those who are interested in what climbing looked like at the end of the ""golden age"" in Yosemite Valley will also find this film interesting. And those who simply want to know what it looks like to do one of the biggest and most famous rock walls on earth will also find this film interesting.",1396915200,7,1428,4.442748091603053
