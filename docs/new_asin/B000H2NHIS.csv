8136044,5,B000H2NHIS,They did a wonderful job putting together this compilation of Bob Hope's 1969 Southeast Asia entertainment tour. I was stationed on the USS Ranger and won an up front viewing when we did a raffle in our E Division. Watching this brought it all back to me. Great DVD for anyone to find out about one of the funniest and dedicated Americans who ever lived.,1302307200,,354,4.461538461538462
8136045,5,B000H2NHIS,"This is a complete reproduction of Hope's 1970 USO Christmas TV Show.  It includes the announcer at the beginning telling us about the show, and the same announcer at the end of the program asking us to stay tuned for The Dean Martin Show coming up next.  I only wish it had included the commercials, that would have been fun to watch too - although you did get to see an amusing listing of Chrysler subsidiaries, many of which are now gone.  If you enjoyed watching these Bob Hope USO tours, you will love watching this DVD.  The jokes are sweet, and many of them are timeless.  Bob will definitely bring a smile to your face.  Thanks for the memories!",1228003200,6,653,4.4
8136046,5,B000H2NHIS,"This is probably my favorite of all the Bob Hope DVDs. It's funny, entertaining and moving. Bob travels the world visiting the troops protecting our country, with him comes a plethora of stars, some of which are entertainers while others aren't. For example, in one episode Bob brings Connie Stevens with him and in another he brings along one of the first men on the moon, Neil Armstrong.

It's inspiring to see how entertainment had an impact on the lives of the soldiers. When Bob Hope could have been sitting safe in the US, he chose the ladder and put himself on the line, simply to entertainer those who put their lives on the line for our freedom. It's unfortunate that we don't see behavior like this anymore. I guess it just isn't safe.",1164585600,9,745,4.559701492537314
