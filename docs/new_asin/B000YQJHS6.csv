8233910,4,B000YQJHS6,"The down side I have with this product comes on the 1st DVD: it's incomplete.  The editing was crap and cut out key details.  Sonnon was about to explain a technique and all the sudden the DVD is over.  Other than that the product is good.  If you are looking for a DVD of a bunch of techniques then look else where.  Sonnon has a more academic approach to teaching, If you ""understand"" the principles and setups then the ""technique"" will be obvious to a grappler with a few months experience.  A huge down side to Sonnon's system is the fact the ""Full Saddle"" position is illegal in Gi competition and heal hooks are illegal in most gi/nogi competitions of BJJ (Sonnon has some sweeps that look like you would be going to a heel hook and a ref would prob stop you in a comp).  Compared to other leg lock instructions like ""Gokor leg lock encyclopedia"" I find Sonnon's Saddle DVD to be superior.  It's like the parable of teaching a man to fish; with Sonnon's approach you are taught to fish and you will deduce all other leg locks on your own over time (you are not literally taught how to fish).  I have had decent success with leg locks in no gi rolling since viewing this product, but I have some leg lock experience so results may not be typical.",1351555200,4,1251,4.334763948497854
