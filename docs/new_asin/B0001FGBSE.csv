1995852,3,B0001FGBSE,"Perhaps better on a rainy day with nothing else to occupy your time.  Admittedly, at first, I thought it not even worth that.  Little did I know that the movie would end up being a sci-fi flick (my fav genre).

As mentioned by other reviewers, things do start slow.  But the pace seems to pick up perhaps half-way through the movie.  I asked my wife (who didn't care for the movie) if she wanted to quit watching it but, like me, she too had to learn what the deal was with the blue suitcase.

A real let down for me was the terrible acting turned in by Kelsey Grammer - who I love to watch in his television comedy series.  Equally terrible was the amount of ""f"" words used by his character (and by most others as well).

Unlike some of the others writing here, I thought Rachael Leigh Cook turned in a pretty good performance (besides being a doll to watch).  And I almost didn't recognize Daryl Hannah.  She also had a nice, but too small, role in the film (and, what a beautiful woman she is in this film).

Quirky does not a comedy make.  I am not sure why it is classed so by people.  This is more a sci-fi than a comedy.  A wacky, off-beat sci-fi.  Other than the language and some violence, it is easy to recommend at least a rental, if not purchase of this movie.",1100822400,3,1272,4.198347107438017
1995853,4,B0001FGBSE,"This was a very intriguing movie.  I look forward to seeing it again; most likely more than once.  All the actors did a really good job and I enjoyed the flow of the film.  In particular, Jon Favreau did an exceptional job with his character.  There were a few points from the movie that I don't understand, but that just causes me to want to watch it again.",1097452800,5,358,4.220588235294118

1995855,1,B0001FGBSE,"Shucks.  The preview on my pay-per-view looked so intruiging I had to rent this silly flick.  It turned out to be nothing but another failed attempt at a quirky character driven comedy that's plotted like snail's road trip and as pointless as it is...well,...empty.  JON FAVERAU is usually watchable in anything, but here he and the rest of the cast is flat due to the bull's effort to make everyone as out-there kooky as possible.  That's pretty much the gist of the flick- FAV is a bagman who goes west to run into all sorts of 'quirky' characters.  The rest seems like ad-libbed filler, and not good filler either.  I do not understand the motivation in any filmmaker to hire RACHEL LEIGH COOK, who is such a bad actress she makes a not so good movie like this a lot worse.  Not much in the story or laughs department, THE BIG EMPTY is a big dissapointment.",1092614400,3,860,4.4743589743589745
1995856,5,B0001FGBSE,"Although primarily a mystery, I found this film to have a quirky, offbeat, intelligent type of humor.  This is not a typical scifi flick, but a most enjoyable independent film.",1083628800,13,176,4.866666666666666

1995858,5,B0001FGBSE,"This is probably one of the very best independent movies that I've had the pleasure to watch.  The acting, directing, editing, script and cinematography were all excellent.  What could have been a silly movie, turned out to be a real gem.  Every cast member did their part, with standout performances by John Favreau, the always brilliant Sean Bean, and even Kelsey Grammar, of whom I'm not a huge fan.
When John Person (Favreau) is approached to simply deliver a blue suitcase to Cowboy (Bean) in of all places, Baker, California, the fun begins.  Nothing is what it seems to the very last frame.
I highly recommend that you buy this movie.  My only complaint is that it wasn't given a wider release.",1082505600,33,701,4.713114754098361

Don't have a clue who he is, but his is a great talent and made this film memorable and credible.  Somehow it feels real even though it can't be ~ RIGHT???",1432425600,,319,4.19672131147541
1995877,3,B0001FGBSE,"It has interesting elements. For example, the bar owner is an unrecognizable Darryl Hannah; the protagonist, Jon Favreau, is now one of Hollywood's big directors.

It is almost as if the writer/director set as a goal for himself to create quirky characters. Favreau plays bland; and all the weirdness bounces off him.

This is a sci-fi movie about alien abduction. Yet we do not see flying saucers or meet extraterrestrial aliens. I guess there's too much strange doings on Earth to warrant ET's.

People are disappearing. An FBI agent, played by Kelsey Grammar, is investigating. Favreau is taking a mysterious suitcase to the California desert which is the epicenter of these disappearances. There's a the hot jailbait seductress. Her insanely jealous boyfriend. Some local coffee shop regulars with strange tales of what happens in the desert at night. A laid back Native American. Ned ""Winter is Coming"" Stark sans British accent playing a malevolent cowboy. It all gets mixed together. We learn nothing. We see nothing. Then it's all over. The audience is left wondering what happened.

Despite all that, I did enjoy the movie. it's not gripping. But it has a charm. It should. There is some very high level talent on the screen.",1431043200,4,1234,5.004878048780488

Grew up in the desert west of Baker, went to high school there, left after graduation and never went back... mostly because the people depicted in this move are REAL... with the possible exception of Sean Bean's character, the alien 'Cowboy'... Dan and Elron hit really close to home. The hint of bowling, burying everything in the desert, beer and JD, and Adam Beach and Gary Farmer with a soundtrack featuring Carl Perkins, BR549, and Lazy Lester... what more could you want in a off beat, off center comedy? If you lived there, or left there you can really get a good laugh out of this one... and if you want to double bill a movie night with some friends, the bowling alley scene is a good opener for The Big Lebowski.

1995880,5,B0001FGBSE,"This is one of my favorite movies. I cannot explain why. All the characters are just weird enough, the story setting is just weird enough and the story itself is just weird enough. I grew up in that part of the country and the weirdness all fits together and reminds me of the good old days. So, when I need a weird, odd little story in my life I watch this movie. It is also one of my favorite movies in which to see Darryl Hannah and Jon Favreau. Frasier Crain also makes a small appearance as a federal agent and Sean Bean is perfect. What can I say.

1995893,1,B0001FGBSE,"There are very few movies in which I'm unable to find anything worthwhile, but this one qualifies.  The Big Empty offers nothing worth bothering with.  The storyline is completely lacking in cohesion or sense.  There is nothing to explain the point of the blue suitcase, or why anyone would be willing to pay $27,000 to have it taken to California.  Perhaps for that reason the acting was weak, the characters unbelievable, and the comedy suggested on the case the DVD came in was non-existent. The vague suggestion of something that at least one reviewer perceives as science fiction simply did not resonate with me.  The best thing about the movie was the ending, and the worst thing about the ending was that it didn't come nearly soon enough.  Sorry, but in my view, this one is a real bomb.",1359244800,6,795,4.683453237410072

The film was confusing and not really that good. But the scenes at the hotel were fun because we had been there. I wish the old place would come back to life like in the movie, however I don't hold much hope for that. It has a good cast.

It's not as darkly funny as a Coen Bros film or as oddly weird and unsettling as a Lynch film. It's reminiscent of both styles, but for me it just didn't come together. The actors are entertaining to watch and pros in giving the script their best effort, but ultimately it was a mildly amusing 90 minutes.

I was all pumped up to talk about the 'stolen' ideas from these two masters when I read the reviews here. One review praised this film for the same reasons I don't care for it! I will not site my own examples. But another film this is derivative of is 'Very Bad Things', a fantastic dark comedy. Jon Favreau is in that one as well doing a much better acting job. It helps he had better material to work with of course. I'm glad I only paid $3.00 for this but on the other hand it was a waste of money.

The story is basically about an out of work actor John Person (Jon Favreau) who is hired by his creepy neighbor to deliver a blue suitcase (with very specific instructions to not open under any circumstances) to the desert town of Baker, California.

Deeply in debt, he accepts the job, but misses his appointment with his contact person, a trucker known only as ""Cowboy"". While waiting for Cowboy to return, Person meets some of the people who live in the desert town, who tell him about people vanishing in the desert, others being inexplicably found there, unusual things seen at night, aliens, and conspiracy theories.

At first intent on just delivering the suitcase and returning home, he finds himself slowly becoming tangled in a web of strange events that lead to his own ultimate showdown in the desert. Great performances by Joey Lauren Adams, Kelsey Grammer, Daryl Hannah, Sean Bean, and Rachel Leigh Cook as well.

""The Big Empty"" is one of my favorite films, I've watched it numerous times, and each time seem to notice something new, some little clue which indicates that things aren't quite as they seem. The ending is a bit subject to interpretation, and different viewers may not agree on exactly WHAT happened, however it does end with an overall optimistic note.

People who enjoyed the classic ""Twilight Zone"" or more recent ""X Files"" series, or the movie ""Repo Man"" will probably enjoy ""The Big Empty"".",1252368000,5,1655,4.7727272727272725

What possessed all these good actors to be in this movie is beyond me, although at least they got paid.  If you must try it (like if you are obsessed with Sean Bean or Adam Beach) try to get it at the library, as I did, and skip to the parts with your favorite actor.  At least then you won't be out any money or an evening's time. This movie isn't even worth paying a rental fee to see.",1249257600,,549,3.8839285714285716

1995903,4,B0001FGBSE,"The Big Empty (2003) Would you deliver a blue suitcase to a small town in the desert for $25,000?  Sure you would and the hero of this flick, an out of work underachieving actor, takes the bait that sets this rather quirky movie on its way. Set in Baker, CA. a real truck stop town filled with eccentrics, his simple job quickly goes off the deep end and soon the movie appears to be escaping reality's hold. By the end of the movie, reality has taken a real beating. The big empty is the desert and a lot more appears to be going on out there than at first peep. Our hero finds out the neighbor who got him into this gig has been killed and his head is missing. Someone has just given him a blue bowling bag and told him not to open it under any circumstances. Does the bag contain a 3 holed bowling ball or a head with two eyes and a mouth? The FBI is also looking for him as well as a possible serial killer trucker cowboy. And that's the type of quirky situations that our hero is constantly facing in Baker. The color blue plays an important role in the movie so keep a blue eye out for blue things. Populated with some well known actors such as Daryl Hannah, Kelsey Grammer, and Sean Bean, it has enough humor to provide a pleasant afternoon viewing. The movie is rated PG-13 for: multiple blue bags, multiple blue eyes, excessive blue balls, unexplained bowling shoes, multiple weird people, and especially for the guy with the alien claw hand that looks and tastes like a chicken foot.",1210204800,,1493,4.313167259786477

1995906,5,B0001FGBSE,"***UPDATE: It's now 2017 and I am still enjoying this flick, now on Amazon Prime: just as good and creepy as ever, a decade later.***
Five SPOOKY Stars! Where has this one been hiding? Mystery is the key here in this independent film and there's plenty of it right up to the very wild end. This film is somewhat in the area code of NIck Cage's ""Red Rock West"" at the beginning, but it goes in another direction after it gets going. Then what started out as a quirky film kicks it up a notch and becomes a really weird, enjoyable, and special DVD.

Premise: an out of work actor has huge bills, needs a job, and gets way more than he bargains for when he's offered work by a neighbor to take a mysterious suitcase to an equally mysterious person: because it leads him out into ""the big empty"". Can't give any more clues without the possibility of ruining it for you. My advice is to see it twice because you'll never see all of the clues the first time through. The second time through, the clues are like glowing neon lights.

The cast list may be misleading: you may not recognize some of the names, but you'll instantly know the faces of this wild ensemble. Jon Favreau is great as the lead. Sean Bean is wonderfully creepy, and Jon Gries, Joey Lauren Adams, Adam Beach, Melora Walters, Gary Farmer and the rest of the crew are excellent. Kelsey Grammer is a surprise who adds alot of big name credibility to the movie. And, trust me, Rachael Leigh Cook gets my vote as flat out one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood. And there is one surprise actor that you won't recognize until the credits are rolling, which may prompt you to hit the reverse button fast. Incidentially, the first scene between Jon and Rachael Leigh at the motel door  is a real ""hoot"" that may slip past you on the first viewing. Pay attention!

This movie, which went direct to VHS/DVD, is a wild ride and it's a keeper (I've kept it for 5 years now). It is exactly the type of discovery that many of us movie viewers look forward to, and when we find it, it's really a magical couple of hours that stick in the mind for years. Buckle up, this'll spin your head around. Check your Blue Bowling Balls at the door, please!! My Highest Recommendation. Five MYSTERIOUS Stars. (Artisan Entertainment. Aura Entertainment. HD. Color.

(Note: ""The Big Empty"" (I love that title) is a great example of what independent film-making is all about. And this is why well-known actors give their time and talent for 'scale' wages: the results can be spectacularly satisfying for everyone of the film makers and stars involved that is on a level that most of the public will never truly understand.)",1142899200,13,2683,4.512345679012346

Destined for cult classic status, ""The Big Empty"" is a strange blend of ""Mulholland Drive"" and ""The Big Lebowski"". So if you liked either or both of these classics you should track down the DVD, it has important special features that shed a little light on just what writer/director Steve Anderson was trying to communicate with this interesting film.

I have beefed up this comment a little since my original viewing because I have found ""The Big Empty"" gets even better with repeated viewings. The wry humor can best be enjoyed when you are not wrestling with the progress of the story itself.

I have heard that there are deleted scenes that show him taking this thing in the direction of the old ""Twilight Zone"" episode where the aliens entice humans to a planetary paradise with a book titled ""Serving Humans"", which actually turns out to be a cook book. There are also elements reminiscent of that suicide cult in San Diego in the mid-1990's.

""The Big Empty"" has some relatively big names in its cast including Kelsey Grammar (a FBI agent), Joe Gries (from ""The Pretender""), Rachel Leigh Cook (the town Lolita), and Darryl Hannah (Lolita's Mother). For the first time a Cook character is very sexy, it must be the hair style. The performances and deadpan humor save the day as the story itself is a little too expressionistic and open-ended for most viewers.

Although the film gets off to a quick start and is never boring, Anderson (in the Lynch tradition) has to cheat and leave some things unresolved at the end, because it is simply impossible to tie all the disparate elements together conventionally. But this makes for interesting discussion with other members of ""The Big Empty"" cult.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1129593600,13,1859,4.778816199376947

8011754,4,B0001FGBSE,"Reading some of the poor reviews makes one realize that this film is a sort of litmus test of the viewer's sensibilities.  If you are descended from Hobbits, you will not like it: ""they liked to have books filled with things they already knew, set out fair and square with no contradictions"".  Hobbit kin love Disney movies and abominate Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini, because they cannot stand works that do not tidily wrap everything up, with neat, simple, consistent, and comprehensive explanations.

This film is not quite up to Bergman and Fellini levels, but it is a well-wrought, craftsmanlike essay on some of the things that it means to be human.  No matter how weird the circumstances, what we want from any work of art is some meaningful comment on The Human Condition, and this movie provides that.  We see people under stress: stress with perhaps an apparently comedic overlay, but to the characters stress real enough.  What moves us, or should move us, is how they react to each other and to the stresses they encounter.

Someone once said that for any work of fiction, The Eight Deadly Words are ""I don't care what happens to these people.""  This film passes: we do care what happens to these people.  And that makes it a fine film.",1505347200,,1254,4.715596330275229

No spoilers so I'll keep it short. A struggling actor gets a chance to pay off his debt by delivering a blue suitcase with unknown contents to a man named, ""Cowboy"" in the California desert.
