2521952,1,B000ELL1Q2,"Suggestion. Instead of buying or renting 'The Detonator' from '06 why not watch Wesley's earlier '00 film 'The Art of War' instead. Why you ask? Why because it's virtually the same movie that's why. Oh there are a few differences, Wesley Snipes is now a C.I.A. agent instead of a U.N. agent, he's in Poland instead of New York and the beautiful woman he's protecting this time is Russian instead of Chinese. Other than that it's EXACTLY THE SAME! 'Detonator' Director Po-Chih Leong even had the nerve to copy the supposedly surprise ending used by Christian Duguay in 'The Art of War.'

Positives: Silvia Colloca adds some feminine charm to an otherwise dreary film and Matthew Leitch is excellent as tough guy Dimitri.

'The Art of War' is a very good movie, 'The Detonator' isn't. Trust me on this one.",1150070400,13,804,4.735714285714286
2521953,1,B000ELL1Q2,"When I was watching this movie, I found myself going through a mental list of what I needed to do the next day, what we were going to have for breakfast the next morning and hoping this movie would end soon.  Wesley Snipes is about exciting as watching the rinse cycle on a washing machine, the plot is so convoluted and incoherent, and the action sequences look like they came out of a movie catalogue.  Ho hum, indeed.",1148688000,5,420,4.371794871794871
2521954,1,B000ELL1Q2,"This film is so awful it will keep you watching just to see if it can get any worse. It has the feel of a cheap documentary, from the first scene it is clear that the budget is almost non existent.

It seems like they rented a couple of apartments in Bucharest and decided to make a home video. Snipes is awful, his character is some ex-CIA operative who has everyone against him the only way forward is to break out those quick fire martial arts moves the we know and love. To make matters worse Snipes does Bugsy Malone style narration that makes the movie even more hilarious. One expects decent action from Snipes and to be honest there are some good action scenes and something to look out for is the ridiculous damage done to some of the bad guys, I am convinced some of the stuntmen suffered injuries because some stunts look clearly unsafe and would never been allowed to be performed in Hollywood becuase of the lack of safety.

Let's hope Snipes avoids these type of films in the future.",1146355200,2,997,4.413043478260869
2521955,3,B000ELL1Q2,"With the last few straight to DVD/video films by Wesley Snipes being a little disappointing, I didn't come to expect much from this one but made the purchase because I am a big fan of his movies.  Overall, this film is better than the previous two films of his.  The actors/actress actually put forth some effort in this film and made their parts interesting.  The best part was the fight scene toward the end. There was a little suspense involved in this film as well.  I look forward to seeing more of Wesley's movies.",1146096000,4,520,4.5

2521971,4,B000ELL1Q2,"Le Detonateur / The Detonator, 2006 film

This action film is set in a foreign country (Rumania). An agent for the CIA is sent on a mission. There is a plot to support the action, its about a weapon of mass destruction (nerve gas). There is shooting, betrayals, and the other events to keep you watching. [Can you spot the body doubles in the action?] Who is the double agent in the CIA? Why does he work for organized crime? Or is it the other way around? There is enough shooting for a war movie. Will the good guys win in the end? Shooting creates a panic in the stadium. Bodies fall like leaves in November. Will there be a surprise at the end? [Did you get a hint earlier?]

It ends with a funeral in Arlington National Cemetery. What happened to the money? Yes, there is another surprise at the end! You get to see views of a country that few visit as tourists. After the Russo-Turkish War of 1837 the defeat of the Turks liberated Rumania and Bulgaria. Rumania became the first European country to enact land reform (giving land to the peasants, the Turkish aristocracy fled the country). The result was an increase in wheat production. Oil was discovered so Rumania exported a replacement for the whale oil used in lamps. But a small European country is always considered prey by its large neighbors.",1408060800,,1308,4.514767932489452

2521975,3,B000ELL1Q2,"The Detonator(released April/06)stars Wesley Snipes as Sonni Griffith,William Hope as Michael Shepard,Tim Dutton as Jozef Bostanescu,Silvia Colloca as Nadia Cominski,Matthew Leitch as Dimitru Ilinca and Michael Brandon as Flint,among others. Shot in Romania,and using a cast some of which I have seen in a Van Damme film or two,it is a fair to middling plot involving alot of espionage and filled with mystery. We have certainly seen our share of films like this involving government agents that go askew of their jobs for whatever reasons and end up having to fight their way back to clear themselves,by themselves.
The story takes place in Bucharest as Snipes comes in posing as a gay arms buyer. Snipes works for Homeland Security. Just before the deal is to go down in the bottom of a soccer stadium,his contact gets a phone call saying Snipes is a cop. Everything erupts and when the smoke clears most of the men inside are dead,except for Snipe's contact and himself. Snipes is carted off to jail while his contact returns to his boss,the owner of the national soccer team and a huge crime boss. His boss isn't too happy but he gives him another chance to get Snipes. Snipes meanwhile is bailed out of jail by a CIA friend. Snipes it seems has a court appearance to make back in the States within 36 hours or his career is toast. His friend gives him a job escorting a female witness back home.
Snipes and his charge end up at a CIA safe house. But soon the house is attacked,trying to get Snipe's charge before he's able to whisk her out of the country. Snipes takes her to a motel and later that is raided also by the crime boss's underlings. Snipes smells a rat and tells his CIA buddy that there's a leak somewhere. He in turn gets an underling to make a background check on everyone. When that turns up with nothing he puts a check on his boss and they find he has sold out to the crime boss. Along the way Snipes finds out that his charge was once married to the crime boss's accountant and she killed her hubby and took $30 million belonging to the boss. Since the boss's underling failed to apprehend Snipes and the woman a second time,he is killed.
The boss is furious and he sends his more experienced men who successfully capture Snipes and his charge. On the way to the stadium where the boss is waiting,Snipes manages to escape while his charge still ends up at the stadium. While the boss is in the midst of trying to negotiate a sale of a nuclear device to the very dealer Snipes was there to bust originally,Snipes arrives,turns the lights out and starts blasting away. The boss runs for it but Snipes gets his man.
From here he contacts his CIA buddy and they both confront the CIA boss,who they believe has been the source of the leak. While his buddy has a gun trained on his boss,Snipes has the crime boss's phone and rings up a name on it called ""the repair man"".Whose phone should ring,but his CIA buddy's,not the boss's. It seems the snitch wasn't whom we thought it was. Snipes raises his gun to his friend. Shots ring out and the two lay prostrate on the marble floor.
Fast forward and we see Snipes being given a formal Arlington Cemetery burial. As the CIA boss and an associate leave they stop by a car with Snipes,his charge and her child in it. As the film ends they drive into the sunset together.
Pretty standard fare wouldn't you say? Snipes has a few good moments,especially when he uses some of his well known karate moves. He is supported well by the cast,but the plot is what it is and it pretty well stays on an even plain throughout the film. Mr Snipes,as you may or may not know,has been having considerable problems and is now currently serving a prison term. He has been doing about a movie a year for quite some time now. But he is scheduled to get out this year and I for one will welcome his return to full time acting duties. We really have missed him.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras.
All in all there is nothing special here to set it apart from a plethora of other such plot themed films. Snipes is good but he seemed to just be going through the motions. His then tax problems surely must have been weighing heavily on his mind.",1361577600,,4254,4.448143405889884

The screen play i give four scores it was a good story with a happy ending, well written. Considering the fact that Wesley Snipes was the only big name actor in the movie; the acting was mentionable well, Silvia Collica did an excellent job as an actress, and displayed great eye candy to the movie. Although, it could of had a more vivid love scene that would have made the movie well rounded. I didn't like that the terrorist attempting to buy the weaopon without securing the money before the purchase and then was beating up on a single mother.

2521979,3,B000ELL1Q2,"By default, American DTV action titles are not meant to compete with blockbuster material. They're generally cheap, occasionally creative alternatives to bigger movies. In the case of DTV movies starring former Hollywood action heroes, it's less of a gamble: these films generally don't bother trying to do anything new or innovative as much as they attempt to perpetuate the star's former image as he gets older and wrinklier. In the case of Wesley Snipes, this part of his career arguably came way before its time and can likely be attributed to his getting caught by the shovel that collectively heaped men like Seagal, Lundgren, and Van Damme out of mainstream status. Snipes, however, has done a relatively decent job of fighting the odds and, along with director Po-Chih Leong, proved here that he still has what it takes to be in big-name pictures.

The story: Homeland Security agent Sonni Griffith (Snipes) must go behind the backs of his employers in Romania to keep the world safe from nuclear threat by protecting a woman (Silvia Colloca,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Van-Helsing/dp/B0002KVUKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Van Helsing</a>) withholding information from a dangerous arms dealer looking to sell deadly new weapons abroad (Tim Dutton,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-Viv/dp/B00008978I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom & Viv</a>).

Director Po-Chih Leong's previous film excursion was the unaccountably weird Steven Seagal vehicle&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-of-Reach/dp/B000255LCK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out of Reach</a>, but survivors of that needn't worry about the production values of this one: Leong delivers a very sleek, professional-looking thriller that avoids the visual bleakness of most DTV fare shot in Eastern Europe. It's all very nice to look at, and most things of a performance nature attempted by the film work out passably. However, the unraveling of the plotline is another matter: even though it's pretty much a retread of Snipes' own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Art-of-War/dp/B00003CXMV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Art of War</a>&nbsp;and avoids the convolutedness of other low-budget yarns, I felt the story playing past me and at no point did it really grab me. There's a cool little twist at the end concerning the allegiance of a character played by William Hope (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B00012FXAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>), but up until then, the tale fails to effectively involve a viewer.

The action content is mostly about shootouts and car chases, both of which are done decently but at the expense of Snipes' hand-to-hand work. Wesley has two very quick brawls, three gunfights, and a single chase scene, and the latter two obviously take precedence over the karate as action centerpieces. A gunfight during a hideout invasion is pretty good and the crash-abundant car chase is damn near theater-level, but overall, the movie's more about suspense and intrigue than it is about the physical talents of its leading man. Tim Dutton's first scene features him brutally impaling a mobster who's trying to intimidate him, but he fails to stay as cool or physical throughout the rest of the picture.

Some authentic Romanian is spoken throughout the film - which is always cooler than listening to bad accents - and the incorporation of the 2006 World Cup as a background setting works surprisingly well, giving the film a bit of extra appeal. In the end, though, it fails to stand out among the masses of other DTV features and certainly isn't a superior Snipes movie. With a bit more action, this one could've raised my eyebrow and earned the four-star rating that a low-budget film with sound production values like these deserves, but in light of its absence, the movie ends up feeling a bit toothless. Devotees of Wesley's action-based outings ought to check it out for the sake of completeness while everybody else should find something better.",1292803200,3,4171,5.946666666666666
2521980,4,B000ELL1Q2,"I enjoy cheap, bad action movies. I found this one in a $5 discount bin while shopping for groceries; If you know what you're getting, it's worth every penny of $5. The movie is unoriginal, cliched, and utterly absurd. At the same time, it has some fun chase sequences, fight sequences, and is surprisingly well acted, given the recycled-from-every-action-movie script. It was fun to watch, if you went into it expecting the sort of thing you'd find in a discount bin.

If this is what to come of Wesley Snipes I'd give up on purchasing any future movies made by him unless you wan't to be disappointed.  The same thing happened to Steven Segal.  His first few movies were great, but as he got older, they went down the tubes.  Just needless violence and profanity.

2521984,1,B000ELL1Q2,"Wesley Snipes plays an undercover CIA agent in Romania. Pitted against this perpetually angry hero (whose emotions are delivered with bland voice-over) is a sexy and strong-willed Russian beauty played by Silvia Colloca. Snipes must protect Colloca going back to USA from the attacks of the villains of this country, whose motives I'm still trying to figure out.

There is no denying that this is a low-budget action film made in Romania, kind of film you watch for shoot-outs and explosions. To their credits, the stunt persons of the film did a decent job and in one memorable scene a baddie falls out of the window (of the second floor of a house) and falls onto the roof of a van below, hitting his head against it really hard and bouncing like a rubber ball. That is amazing. And don't forget the cat-and-mouse chase scene in the subway where a bald-headed baddie shows one surprising stunt.

But the rest of the film is very dull. ""The Detonator"" uses every clichd element of action genre taken directly from other better films, and throws them into the convoluted narrative in the wrong way. The film attempts to be different with a portrait of a gangster who owns a soccer team and several scenes about soccer games. However, it just doesn't work because of the tepid descriptions of games and banal action sequences mixed with them.

It was in 2004 when we saw the third entry of `The Blade' which was not bad. But now Wesley Snipes seems to have officially joined in the direct-to-video land where Steven Seagal is the king or the Great One. (In fact `The Detonator' is co-produced by Andrew Stevens who is also responsible for such films as ""Half Past Dead"" ""The Foreigner"" and ""Out of Reach."") I'm not saying that all straight-to-video actions are bad - remember Dolph Lundgren who is doing a very good job as star and director. - but as to `The Detonator"" the result is simply disappointing.",1170201600,2,1904,4.6946107784431135
