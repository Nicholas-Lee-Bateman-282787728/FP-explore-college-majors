8551389,1,B002CGT14Q,I can't believe I got ripped off buying this DVD which shows no professionalism or proper investigation. Totally crappy dvd ever seen!!! There is no sign of ghost or paranormal activity throughout the whole show. How on earth no quality check on this dvd before selling it on Amazon web site?,1290470400,,292,4.745098039215686
8551390,1,B002CGT14Q,"The DVD costs almost 12 bucks.  You're paying 12 bucks for a group of guys filming themselves as they walk around.  There was NO professionalism whatsoever, and the stuff they did wasn't as courageous and big as people make it out to be.  I was raised near Byberry and was curious what the DVD was about.  Honestly, if you wanna see ghost things...then go elsewhere.  If i could boycott their sales, i would.  I would love to get my money back.  You can get better stuff about Byberry online for free!!!!",1268697600,,504,4.472527472527473

The DVD's that they produce are totally fun, totally informative and totally the truth. No fluff! They go to some really crazy haunted places and they leave no stone unturned as they search for evidence of the paranormal. There DVD's are a must for any Ghost hunter or Ghost enthusiast!

I met them all at a paranormal convention in Gettysburg, PA, and promptly viewed their DVDs when I got home.  This episode at the Philly State Hospital (as well as their Shanley Hotel episode) is the stuff that makes GREAT television!! I am surprized that they do not have a network show on the air. Their techniques are professional, experimental and results-oriented, and I find there episodes chock-full of information and personal interaction.

While I enjoy watching some of the Ghost hunting shows on television, SCARED! brings a whole 'nuther dimension, and their filmed investigations show more detail and involvement. They are right in there, in the action, looking for phenomena and engaging in the mystery of it all.

Go guys!!
