3690764,2,B001LQNQM6,"These discs make a whirring sound and are a mess, if this company had decent quality control, then this package would have been worthwhile but it is a boxed piece of junk for the most part,",1247097600,8,189,4.277777777777778
3690765,4,B001LQNQM6,"Since many of the shows featured in this collection I have only heard about but not seen it was great to finally get a taste of the likes of Twenty-One, Ding Dong School and Super Circus. I would love to see more.",1240790400,5,213,4.095238095238095
3690766,1,B001LQNQM6,"Very dissatisfied.  Defects occur but when you order it twice and both times they don't work, that's not acceptable.  I have also e-mailed Mill Creek to see what they have to say.

** Update June 3, 2009.  I am pleased to report that Mill Creek has sent me another replacement and this one finally works!  They had not replied to my last two e-mails which seemed out of character, as they were good in communicating with me initially, but they did follow through and sent me a working copy.",1239494400,7,490,4.46067415730337
3690767,2,B001LQNQM6,"The good news is that this set has a lot of wonderful material, and for the price it seems like a terrific deal. The bad news is that the price is low for a reason: The actual DVDs don't work well at all. Technologically, it's a nightmare, in fact. You can't access certain shows on the menu; some stop in the middle, skip, or pause indefinitely. Often you can't even access the menus, and the discs make odd whirring sounds in the DVD player. More good news: Amazon was quite prompt and nice about returning my first set and sending another set. More bad news: The same problems occur on the replacement. At this point I really don't want to go through another iteration of returning and replacing, and then being disappointed again. I will say that the shows I was able to watch were terrific. It's sad that quality companies don't want to release quality classic game-show DVDs.",1236902400,31,881,4.547169811320755
3690768,3,B001LQNQM6,"If you enjoy all the other Mill Creek movie and television box sets you'll want to get this one of classic '50s game shows.  It's got Lucy and Desi on What's My Line and tons of other (many obscure) game shows. Of course these are all in black and white, and the audio and video clarity varies.  But for the price I definately feel I got my moneys worth.  My only complaint is that there are only one or two episodes of each game show.  I'd love to see more What's My Line.  Hint, hint, hint Mill Creek.  More please.",1236556800,2,517,4.12
8319515,4,B001LQNQM6,"i absolutely loved all the classic game shows and as for the more part the kids shows should have been on there own collection to make room for more of the game shows as i would have bought a collection of the kids shows separately.

as for the discs shaking, skipping, and freezing that everybody is complaining about  there is no problem with my set.",1385510400,,352,4.4
8319516,5,B001LQNQM6,Used these dvds during my exercise workouts to make the time go faster. Keeps your mind active. Wish there was more of .them,1360886400,,124,4.434782608695652
8319517,4,B001LQNQM6,i like old tv shows  This DVD brought back many memories.  Enjoyed seeing the people and how they looked long ago.,1358553600,,114,4.380952380952381
8319518,4,B001LQNQM6,"I have not experienced the problems that others have mentioned here.  This is a tremendous value and offers programs that are not found elsewhere.  It showcases the early days of television when big name guests appeared on common game shows.  The packaging, while not steller, is certainly adequate, especially so considering the price.

I hope that Mills Creek can find more of these gems.",1357171200,3,390,5.046875
8319519,4,B001LQNQM6,"I am becoming a big fan of Mill Creek Entertainment. I have purchased several compilations with their label, and I have not experienced any of the playback issues mentioned in other reviews. Having said that, this compilation will probably be enjoyed more by aficianados of classic game shows / television than a casual inquisitor.

One criticism I have about my set is that there is not a ""Play All"" feature on the discs. I have to choose and click a single episode from the menu to watch, and then wade back to the menu after that episode is over to watch the next episode or next game show. This seems to be a ""feature"" of Mill Creek in some of their sets but not others. Get with it, guys! ""PLAY ALL"" should be de riguer on all discs.

On the plus side: this compilation includes some very obscure game show titles (at least to me): Treasure Hunt and Pass the Line come to mind. On the minus side: disc 4 is not exactly game shows, but kiddie shows from times past (not that I don't like to see those shows, but it seems to me they belong in their own set instead of with this one.)

Overall, four stars. If Mill Creek could have added a play all feature, dropped the kiddie shows and included more classic game shows, then it would have been a five.",1341619200,2,1254,4.305084745762712
8319520,2,B001LQNQM6,My biggest issue is these are really old game shows. Second there is no option to simply play through all of the episodes. You have to select a new episode after each one is finished.,1334361600,,183,4.257142857142857
8319521,1,B001LQNQM6,"When I received the package, I was shocked to see that the 4 single disks are in paper envelopes, stacked in the plastic case, which is about the cheapest way of packaging DVDs.

Only about half of the episodes are real game shows, mostly contained on Discs 1 and 2.  Several are plain give-away programs where people only have to prove that they are needier than the other contestants.  The rest, about half of disc 3 and all of disc 4, are children's shows which are totally out of date.  As far as the actual game shows go, instead of classic programs and wonderful hosts like, for instance, Bill Cullen, the set includes losers like ""Place the Face, ""Pass the Line"" and ""Pantomime Quiz""  as well as hosts whom nobody remembers.

If you are thinking of the runtime and the low price (as I did), do not forget that most commercials are included, not only those where the actors show products during the show.  And since I can almost guarantee that you will not look at most of these again after the first time, where is the gain?  At least, that's what I am asking myself.",1320192000,,1074,4.4438775510204085
8319522,5,B001LQNQM6,"I bought this set after finding out that it had shows like ""Play Your Hunch"" on it. There are some good shows here, many that I have never seen. Part of the fun is seeing celebrities (Bill Cullen, Steve Allen, Robert Q. Lewis among others) who are long dead. Western actor Walter Brennan is here, in a suit and tie with his teeth in. I almost didn't recognize him! I too experienced trouble with at least one of the DVDs ""freezing"".",1273881600,,432,4.345679012345679
8319523,1,B001LQNQM6,i gave this a one star because everyone else did. i did not order this or see this. but if this is all true what other reviewers are saying then they better fix this problem. im here to talk about my favorite show. i have all the tapes that i recorderd from the game show network years ago and they must release this entire series. the show im talking about is the gong show with chuck barris. the gong show was the best show on television. i garantee you that the gong show will be the best game show seller out there.everybody i know when i show them the tapes they want the entire dvd collection.including me. i have 400 episodes on vhs with no commercials very very clear. but still i gotta have the dvd quality.thank you,1263340800,,725,4.260869565217392
8319524,3,B001LQNQM6,"The collection is very extensive. I saw shows I had never seen before, and I'm a big fan of game shows. Jan Murray's version of ""Treasure Hunt"" and ""Dollar a Second"" were both new shows to me. Same with Bill Cullen's ""Place the Face"" and the shows ""Queen For a Day"" and ""Draw The Line"" I believe it was called. Overall a nice variety of shows to watch.

Now the bad news. The Edgar Bergen show froze twice in the same spot the two times I tried playing it. Judging from some other reviews, this is a ""quality control"" problem more than just a fluke. The quality of some shows are better than others, but given the age of these shows, that's somewhat to be expected. Other than that a nice look back at TV in its beginning and simpler times.",1255910400,2,740,4.24822695035461
