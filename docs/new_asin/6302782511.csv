I never forgot about the movie because it has a great cast and very well performed by the actors involved in the story.
I LOVE MOVIES from the past because the actors make it so believable.
Sadly excellent movies like this are not made anymore.
The movie is worth the low price,that I paid for it and the DVD is still in excellent condition.",1362614400,,398,4.32
516863,3,6302782511,An early film with Jeff Fahey. Enjoyed the twist and turns. Actors and their acting skills made the film totally enjoyable. Worth watching more than once.,1349740800,,154,4.961538461538462
516864,5,6302782511,"I was always foolled by sexy or flashy covers when I was younger, not so much now, but a good cover still attracts me, and the cover for the video tape of this film did make me want to hire it, and we're talking a long time ago.  Twenty years ago in fact!!  The cover of the video had a woman's pair of legs and she was holding a gun in her hand and of course, I was tempted to get it out for that alone.  But I refused.
It took all this time and little did I know it would become so rare, but having finally got it, all I can say is, I am so glad I did. It was an absolutely cracking psychological thriller, with a brilliant twist.
The cast itself should have given me hope of a decent package, Karen Allen, Keith Carradine and Jeff Fahey, all three of whom have hardly ever let us down.  Their work is usually top notch, even if not all of it is to my taste.  But that alone even wasn't enough to tempt me back then.  But they were all in great form and a very clever script, eerie tension throughout and some steamy scenes between Keith Carradine and Karen Allen, who sort of played the villain of this film all made it worth it.  She was such a bitch!!!  And Karen Allen has a lovely body which she shows off a bit in this film, for the first time if I'm not mistaken.
There were clever twists and turns throughout and it had that sense of mystery and intrigue that really felt like an old eighties suspense shocker.  It took me right back and it was terrific.  And the ending was so damn good, I was quite breathtaken.
All I can say is well done indeed to Messers Allen, Carradine and Fahey for coming up with such a great piece, which was actually worth twenty years of thinking about seeing it!!!
A long time ago I thought about it, and now my curiosity is finally satisfied.  Strange though how some of these films become so rare.
BRILLIANT BACKFIRE!!!",1265500800,7,1860,4.138888888888889

7831918,4,6302782511,"There appear to be several different versions (or packagers) of this fine little film. Mine is the Platinum Disc one, which is 90 minutes, full-frame, and uncensored.  The timing and A.R. are not those given for the original production, but, if anything is missing, I didn't notice (relative to the version that shows on HD cable channels).  The image is rather soft in places, like a 480i picture, but not in every scene; most of the movie (and, yes, the fleshy bits) look like a 480p DVD.  I think the bit rate got up to 7.5 Mb/s in places, which is excellent detail for a DVD. Go figure.  Being a rather intimate mystery story, the reduction to full-frame doesn't really hurt so much. Worth watching.",1460937600,,703,4.6
