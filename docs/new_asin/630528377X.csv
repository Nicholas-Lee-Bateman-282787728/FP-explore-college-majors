7887177,5,630528377X,"Most of the other reviews echo what I would say in descibing the nature of these short films. The DVD quality is OUTSTANDING, I'm not a huge fan of John's music but it works here very well.
This is a completely original effort and a cult classic. Fisherman won't mind it either, the beautiful scenery, and the exotic fish and settings are 100% dead on in most fishermans dream vacation files.
Take a chance on these films, they are sometimes pretty art-school, but mostly pretty damn cool.",990403200,,489,4.632183908045977
7887178,5,630528377X,"Give two grown up thirteen year olds a camera crew and a boundless budget to take exotic fishing trips . . .the result is Fishing With John.
Hard to describe, but particularly great are the narrator (who earnestly makes  PBSque comments like ""The shark . . . man's deadliest predator), and  the music by John Lurie.  This includes faux-ethnic music to acompany his  trip to Thailand, and the famous Fisherman Dance chorale from the  brazillian rainforest (""Ah the power and the wisdom!"")",963100800,3,487,4.890243902439025
7887179,5,630528377X,"DEAR JOHN, THE GENTLE AND SENSITIVE APPROACH TO NATURE. MUSIC THAT LINGERS DAYS AND WEEKS FOLLOWING THE ENCOUNTER OF FISHING WITH JOHN.  P.S. MY SON-IN-LAW IS GETTING THIS FOR CHRISTMAS.",944697600,2,186,5.2
7887180,5,630528377X,I love the opening song written by John Lurie himself. Hooked me from the start. A  must see for fish lover and haters alike.,943056000,,125,4.208333333333333
