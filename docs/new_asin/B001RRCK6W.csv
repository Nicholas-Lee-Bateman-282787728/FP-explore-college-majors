3778382,5,B001RRCK6W,"This is the second Susan Tuttle video that I have purchased and I really love it.  As usual Susan is fun and upbeat, the music and background are great, and the video is good quality.  Susan emphasizes safety and she encourages that you drink water.  As Susan goes through the exercises, she explains correct form.  The exercises are fun and easy, but you can increase the intensity as far as your mobility will allow.  I am recovering from a severe ankle injury.  I believe this workout is good for someone recovering from an injury, someone with limited mobility, someone whose body is tight or someone who has done a strenuous exercise routine and need a light workout.  This dvd consist of two 30 minute workouts and I like them both.  You will need a ball which is not included, but I was able to find one for a $1.00.  It includes stretches from head to toe, including stretches for your hands and fingers which feel great on my joints.  There is a lot of core work also.  The ball took time to get use to, but it has helped my coordination and muscle tone.  I'm not sure if the workouts are pilates but I feel completely safe following along to the routines.  I feel like I am retraining my muscles.",1373068800,7,1206,4.427272727272728
3778383,5,B001RRCK6W,"I like Susan's style and teaching technique.  I already had her ""chair resistance band"" and liked it and found it very beneficial so selected her  Exercise DVD again.

I would recommend her exercise DVB''s  to any one with limited physical disabilities..",1370908800,,254,5.121951219512195
3778384,5,B001RRCK6W,"Nice DVD.  This is a good work out for people with limited mobility.....You will need to buy a small ball, maybe a few small hand weights and/or stretch bands to aide in the work out....",1363219200,4,186,4.314285714285714

8338675,4,B001RRCK6W,"...it's a good little workout with the ingenuous use of a small ball as a resistance tool. It may be a little brisk and challenging for people who don't already have a degree of fitness, however I think you could set aside the ball and still get some benefit. I wish there had been more specifics about the size of the ball. I have a 7 inch diameter ball which seems to be the same size as the one on the DVD, but it's foam and kind of heavy. Still ball shopping....

I've got several chair exercise DVD's and this is one of the best. You get a great deal of cardio in as well as strength training. Yes, if you are a Cross Fit athlete this may be pretty tame, but if you have physical challenges that prevent you from doing things either standing or lying flat on your back this is a great, fun way to get you huffing and puffing and get those muscles working.",1490918400,,860,4.119047619047619

8338680,4,B001RRCK6W,"There are two 30-minute programs on this DVD, with some similarities.  I think the first one is a bit easier.  You need a plastic ""play ball"" to do the exercises--nice, light prop.
If you can get past Susan Tuttle's happy, bouncy demeanor--at first I found it a bit off-putting, but after doing the exercises a few times, it doesn't bother me much--you'll find that the exercises are balanced and sufficiently challenging.  I like the option of having two programs to select from.",1446336000,,480,4.829268292682927
8338681,5,B001RRCK6W,"Good CD, but very fast at times hard to keep up especially in the beginning, with my 2 arthritic knees, the pace at times was too fast.

Thanks, Joyce",1424822400,,150,4.172413793103448
8338682,4,B001RRCK6W,"Just wished she had talked more about what type  & what size of ball we should consider using. Will a cheap ball from Walmart do? Otherwise , very pleased with it.",1395705600,,163,4.258064516129032
8338683,1,B001RRCK6W,"The only reason to do chair pilates is because you have physical limitations, a concept that Susan Tuttle seems to not understand. This workout is as strenuous as a standing workout and not suited to those of us who have mobility issues. Her obnoxious cheerfulness is so grating that it made me want to put it on mute. If you could easily stand to work out for the entire time and like terminally perky, then this is the DVD for you.",1387152000,,433,4.3580246913580245
