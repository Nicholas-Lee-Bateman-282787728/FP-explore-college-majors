2325359,5,B0009VRHLA,"Imagine a world like our own, just 6.5 light years away - but teeming with life forms unlike anything found on Earth.

Take a simulated journey into the near future, where astronomers and biologists alike marvel at the potential of Darwin IV, a nearby planet with two suns, 60% gravity and an atmosphere capable of supporting life. Having identified Darwin as a likely home for life, scientists send a series of unmanned probes to the planet. Initially, the expectation is to find microscopic life. But the probes soon find themselves in the middle of a developed ecosystem, teeming with diverse creatures of all sizes.

Peering through the ""eyes"" of the probes, marvel at the planet's bizarre inhabitants - like the lumbering Groveback, which supports a mini forest of vegetation on its back; deadly Prongheads who hunt in packs like wolves; and the graceful Gyrosprinter, an elk-like creature with a body dotted by luminescent biolights. The look and biology of each animal is based on the laws of evolution and physics, then modeled to fit the hypothetical environment of Darwin IV. Leading minds in the fields of paleontology, astrophysics and astrobiology explain how these creatures might evolve otherworldy characteristics like hollow bodies, ""jet"" propulsion and piercing tongue skewers.

One of the best shows I have ever seen. The attention to detail both in the environment and in the creatures is amazing. As both a scientist and a computer artist I can find no fault with any portion of this production other then it comes to an end and leaves my wanting more. The fact that there can possibly be life on another planet and we will soon have the technology to observe that is mindblowing. It has really gotten me interested in space and the creation of life. I thought it was very educational to watch. It fits in right along with Dinosour Planet, Future Is Wild, and the Walking With Series.  Also good entertainment value, I hope they make a sequel",1119484800,46,1963,4.921450151057402
2325360,2,B0009VRHLA,"This program on Discovery was billed as future mission to explore life on another planet. That's all well and good, and for the first five minutes it was very interesting, with different scientists talking about how we would get there, how long it would take, how the ships and robots and other machinery would work. But after that it went downhill.

There were mass assumptions made about what would be found and that may not be that bad, but then assumptions started being made based on previous assumptions and after 20 minutes what we had left science all together and was no better than an episode of Star Trek. What made it worse were the scientists commenting on different aspects of this fiction, such as the behaviour we're seeing from the animals found and such.

Bottom line, lower your expectations when going to see this.",1116115200,6,834,4.744827586206896

2325398,5,B0009VRHLA,"I liked a lot this 2005 Discovery Channel production, which for me is in fact a SF film disguised as a ""docufiction"". Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

This is the story of robotic probes send by humanity to explore the exoplanet Darwin IV, situated 6,5 lightyears from Earth. An interstellar robotic spacecraft named Von Braun, rraveling at 20% the speed of light (37,000 miles/s), reaches Darwin IV in 42 years. Upon reaching orbit, it deploys the Darwin Reconnaissance Orbiter, which looks for potential landing sites for the probes, Balboa, Leonardo da Vinci (nicknamed Leo) and Isaac Newton (nicknamed Ike). We land on the surface very quickly after the beginning of the film and for most of 94 minutes we explore Darwin IV - and meet its indeed very alien fauna, flora, climate and landscapes.

For my personal taste this was actually a really good SF movie rather than a typical Discovery Channel production - although quite obviously of the sub-genre ""hard-fiction"" (which means trying to stick to some real science). I liked it A LOT as it is indeed a good show with lot of strange and yet not completely unlikely creatures and also with some genuine, surprising twists, none of which is stupid or too freakishly outlandish. The ending is particularly good - surprising, moving and exciting.

I will not say much about the creatures and other treasures of Darwin IV - you deserve to discover them by yourself. However I must say here that, for my personal taste, the makers of this film took the correct decision to make this alien planet NOT TOO alien. Darwin IV is in its general lines an Earth-like planet, not one of many more different possible living alien environments, like ocean covered blue-world, Europa-like ice ball filled with a deep dark ocean, tidaly locked planet with life existing in the intermediary middle area between too cold and too hot, dark far-from-its-sun planet with non-carbon based life, or any other place that the Almighty in His infinite wisdom decided to create. Also, if I am not mistaken, life on Darwin IV is carbon-based.

Create a fictitious and yet plausible VERY alien world would of course be possible - but I clearly understand that it would take a tremendous effort of reflection/conception. Here, this world is clearly alien, but still familiar enough for us to understand it and relate to it. Of course, I would welcome with pleasure a good docufiction about a more ""exotic"" living world and I think we should soon get one, now that we know a lot more about exoplanets and also about more distant places in our own Solar System (expected for 2015 images of Pluto and some other Kuiper Belt objects to be taken by New Horizons will certainly add even more knowledge) - but for 2005 I think it was more prudent to not venture too far in speculation.

Bottom line, this is a very, VERY succesful Discovery Channel production. I enjoyed it A LOT, I recommend it to all SF afficionados and I will definitely keep my DVD fo another viewing in the future. ENJOY!",1417478400,,3037,4.7992351816443595

Airborne robots are deployed to explore, analyze & send back video footage of the life forms on the planet, yclept Darwin IV.The life forms range from microscopic bacteria & extremely dangerous ""BeachQuill"" plants, to the predatory ""Skewers"" (a cross among terrestrial flying foxes, woodpeckers and vampire bats), gigantic ""Grovebacks"" (bipedal animals that support tree-like plantlife), & an ""ocean"" that is itself a single multicelled entity, along with the disturbingly intelligent ""EoSapiens."" The CGI imagery is weird & unlike anything I've seen anywhere else, with the possible exception of ""Forbidden Planet.""

2325442,4,B0009VRHLA,"As a product of speculative science it is pretty impressive. Using computer graphics it shows how a mission to explore an alien planet would be conducted by Earth employing a sublight spacecraft delivering sophisticated probes to the surface. The program explains step-by-step the mission as the probes encounter strange life forms, with frequent asides by scientists who explain how such life forms might evolve and live. Using computer animation, the program is very good. If it has a flaw it is in the asides, which frequently go back to something discussed five minutes and a couple of segments ago. In the DVD version the commentary might be edited in as an option, so it is possible to go all the way through the story, which is absorbing in and of itself.",1359936000,,762,4.824427480916031

2325445,5,B0009VRHLA,"I've long had an interest in science documentaries, and space exploration, and have indeed watched a lot of documentaries on those subjects.  So, when I found this DVD, I jumped on the chance to try it out.

First off, let me say that if you were expecting a pure documentary of some type, you'll be disappointed.  ""Alien Planet"" is more of an imaginative science fiction of what a fully inhabited alien plant might be like.  What sets it apart from your average sci-fi movie about space marines and screeching alien beasts is that there was actual effort put in to make it at least informed by scientific opinion.  So, instead of hollywood's version of just using whatever aliens creatures are scariest-looking, they asked a bunch of scientists to think about what might have realistically evolved given a certain environment.  That, in and of itself, makes this movie far more interesting to me than your average alien creature flick.  Now, bear in mind that of course, this whole scenario is purely based on conjecture, but that's what it's supposed to be!  Some scientists (and George Lucas, apparently) sat down and said, ""hey let's take what we know from our respective fields and apply that knowledge to dream up what a hypothetical alien planet might be like!"", and thus, ""Alien Planet"" was born.  If you keep all this in mind, the DVD is quite an  enjoyable imaginative romp through science fiction.

The film starts off introducing us to the fictional newly discovered planet of Darwin IV, and to two A.I. probes called Ike and Leo.  Ike and Leo are not anywhere near human intelligence, but anyone who's familiar with A.I. programming would realize that they are quite advanced compared to what we have today, and are a realistic guess into what we might be able to create in the future.  The story of ""Alien Planet"" follows these two probes as they float around the planet and gather data on the indigenous species they find there.  Some of the creatures they encounter are a bit silly looking, but for the most part I found it reasonable.  Occasionally, the story following the probes is interspersed with cuts to various people who explain their reasoning behind many of the creature designs/behaviors.  I quite enjoyed this since it helped to give a greater insight into why they chose to put certain things into the film.  It also shows that they did, indeed, put some thought into what went into the film.

Lastly, I should mention the special features.  There are some nice interviews with a few of the scientists, but that's about it.  While I did enjoy the interviews, I was annoyed that there wasn't any ""play all"" option for them.  Each person's interview is split into like 5 or 6 little videos and some of those segments are quite short, so it would've been much nicer to have a ""play all"" option.  Oh well, other than that little irritant, I don't have any complaints.

Overall, if you like scientific speculative pseudo-documentaries, you'd probably enjoy ""Alien Planet"".  If you're not sure if this sort of thing is up your alley, then just give it a rental first and see how you like it.  I rented it at first, and I ended up liking it so much that I bought a copy for myself.  Oh, and for anyone who did enjoy it and is looking for something similar, I'd also recommend you try out ""The Future Is Wild"" as that one's quite good too.",1349827200,2,3361,4.683134582623509
2325446,5,B0009VRHLA,"Alien Planet is a speculative documentary apparently based on a book called ""Expedition"" by one Wayne Barlowe.
The documentary tells a tale of how the Von Braun, a robotic spacecraft from Earth, travels 6.5 lightyears to a planet called Darwin IV, and sends robotic probes to the surface to study the planet. The first probe, Balboa, explodes shortly after entering the planet's atmosphere. Fortunately, two backup probes, Leonardo da Vinci (nicknamed Leo) and Isaac Newton (nicknamed Ike), make their landing successfully. From there on, they commence exploring, and over the course of the documentary discover a number of fascinating alien species.

Darwin IV is a rather unusual planet, with no oceans but a high air humidity. The gravity is lower than on Earth and the air is thicker.
Throughout the documentary, we are introduced to a large variety of different alien species. We have the T-rex sized bipedal predator the Arrowtongue, which uses sonar to hunt, and the smaller pack hunting biped predators the Prongheads. Being hunted by Arrowtongues and Pronghorns are the Gyrosprinters, who apparently evolved from quadrupeds whose four legs fused into two. On the barren plains, the bipedal tusked herbivores the Unths fight territorial battles. Spiky trees are home to the gliding Trunk Suckers, who feed on the tree sap, and to another gliding creature called the Daggerwrist, who feeds on the Trunk Suckers.
Some of the creatures on Darwin IV are truly gigantic. The tripedal herbivores the Grovebacks are bigger than the biggest dinosaurs and allow trees to grow on their back. The Stilt Strider is even bigger, and feeds on a Texas-sized microbe colony called the Amoebic Sea. The Skewers are flying predators with a wingspan of 15 metres (in comparison the biggest pterosaurs had a wingspan of 12 metres) and a long sharp proboscis for impaling prey.
And these are all just some examples of the many wierd and wonderful creatures found on the alien world.

Between the events showing the alien world are short intermissions where well known individuals discuss the speculated alien life forms in the documentary, and views on alien life in general.
We see both famous scientists such as Stephen Hawking, Craig Venter and Michio Kaku, and famous non-scientists such as Wayne Barlowe and George Lucas.

Overall Alien Planet was a fascinating documentary that offered some fascinating speculations on alien life. The alien life forms were well portrayed and quite intriguing, and the documentary was very detailed. Alien Planet is a must see for anyone fascinated in alien life.",1322438400,,2589,5.174224343675418
2325447,4,B0009VRHLA,"Alien Planet is a rather unique film, the only other movie I have seen like this is one in the same series as this one dealing with life on Earth in the future. Alien Planet is a movie produced by Discovery Channel where they have taken biologists and other scientists and had them think up a alien world and what creatures might exist there, the movie then takes the shape of a fake nature documentary exploring the life on this planet which is called Darwin 4. The stars of Alien Planet are two robot probes which fly around exploring and their charm add to the movie's appeal.

I watch allot of science fiction but I sat totally amazed and watched this, the creatures they have come up with for this movie is so creative. Like you have a five stories tall giant who have a forest growing off theirs backs, and seven stories tall creatures who walk on a sea made of amoeba, and the sea itself is alive and capable of stretching and moving to catch prey, and that is just a few of the myriad of strange aliens in this movie. There is something magical about this movie and the whole fake documentary of it makes the creatures shown feel more real. Also the robot probes which are the viewer's eyes and ears on Darwin 4 have allot of personality and I found myself really caring what would become of them.

I would give this film five stars, however there is one thing that pull it down just a hint and that is the computer graphics. Alien Planet is six years old and allot have happened in animation since then, however even for it's time the animation is not stellar. I would so want a remake of this where you got to see these amazing creatures done with more modern technology and higher graphics. Alien Planet is amazing however for a movie who is almost completely computer graphics I can not give it five stars as it really look kind of dated. I would give it a 4,5 however.

If you want a different movie, or you like aliens, robots or dreaming of what might be out there I think you would like this film. Also while this is in nature documentary format so you have some creatures killing one another the violence is not graphic so I think Alien Planet would be great for younger viewers also while it is in no way a child's movie. I recommend Alien Planet warmly, it is based on a original concept, it is well produced with the budget they had for it and it is just plain fun to watch, at the end of it Alien Planet leaves me wanting to see more of Darwin 4 and it makes me dream of a future where we might find such wondrous places out there in space.",1300665600,,2561,4.276288659793814
2325448,2,B0009VRHLA,"The animations were beautifully done, but I did not enjoy the DVD. The story is about a robot ship that goes to a planet
6 and 1/2 light years away. The ship sends research pods that look like cute dirigible wall-e type robots, with flexible necks and heads,
no less, and nicknamed Leo and Ike. They are sent down to the planet, named Darwin IV. The pods are supposed to investigate the
life forms on the planet. Fauna are dinosaur-like bipeds, bird-like animals, giant walking Groveback's, a living sea,
and other forms that the creators of the video believe are sufficiently alien to our form of life. Many scientists that I respect,
Michio Kaku and Jack Horner, for example, give opinions and blather on about the animals in the video. I am a layman, but the planet
and life-forms seem more like bad science fiction and not believable to me at all. This episode is supposed to be  about science and not art.
The planet has no water, the seas have dried up. The trees seem more like cactuses with few leaves, yet supports herds of wide-ranging
herbivores and predators.  There are giant animals. At the end of the DVD a note identified the landscape as Iceland. The land is
not even a tundra, but seems like arctic scrub, with little obvious flora. There seems a disconnect, at least to me, between the appearance of the planet and animals and what the authoritative scientists say about it. The probes are supposedly guided by a supercomputer yet seem incomprehensibly stupid. They  show  a screen projection of humans to dumb brutes, and act in a way that seems inappropriate, for an extensively  researched and expensively funded expedition. Many of the scientists repeat themselves, action or other statements that seem not well edited I did not buy it and that affected my experience of the DVD",1274227200,5,1801,4.741214057507987
2325449,3,B0009VRHLA,"This show was entertaining, but fell short.  First off, Expedition is better.  It seems that in this show, they only used the aliens that resembled dinosaurs, rather than Barlowes more creative ones like the Rugose Floaters or Mummy Nests.  The terrain looks dead and barren, compared to Barlowe's lusher world,and the size of the creatures was cut down.  Now the Emperor Sea Strider is only 70 feet tall as oppose to 600 feet tall like in the book.  Also,  they'll show a creature, then cut away to a bunch of scientists who talk about some random thing that isn't even related.  They'll show a Daggerwrist, then be like, ""The weather on Darwin 4 is powered by air currents, or the Groveback is really cool and has trees on it.""  Completely unrelated to the current creature.  Also the scientist's talks can get boring.  It would have been better if they continued showing the creature while they narrated.
The good parts now.  The show's CGI is spectaculare, really bringing the creatures to life like they're real.  The narrated parts are good and it has good music that adds to the ""alieness"" of the show.  Overall,  if you can get it for five bucks it's worth it.  Anything over fifteen and you're better off watching it on YouTube.",1270080000,2,1237,4.688372093023256
2325450,4,B0009VRHLA,"They made a decent try at imagining an alien world. They were very creative, maybe too much so. An alien could look and act like
almost anything. Odds are like nothing we have ever imagined. Mainly I`d take issue with their imagined planet itself. A world
only six tenths the mass of earth would be very unlikely to develope complex life. It`s core would cool very rapidly (by geologic
standards of time) and once it lost it`s magnetic field you would get a reducing atmosphere and it suffers the same fate as
Mars. Even being close enough to it`s star to stay fairly warm, it`s atmosphere would be very thin.
As for the imagined life on this imaginary world, who can say? Nature, on other worlds might well come up with even more
outlandish critters than these. But one thing you probably could bet on is that there would be far more different specis than
you see in the film. But it would take a massive amount of work to even dream up a semi-realistic alien ecco-system, so I tend
to give them a pass on that one. There is some wild speculation in this film as far as the critters go, but for all we really
know reality just might be a whole lot wilder than that.
All in all, even with the flaws and wild speculation, it`s still a decent try at depicting a truely alien world and it is very
entertaining. I`d give it 4 stars, maybe a bit less.",1263686400,,1346,4.324110671936759

2325463,3,B0009VRHLA,"This could have been an entertaining and educational production.  It definitely has its moments: the story of how a spacecraft could reach an alien planet, explore it, and get the information back to Earth is very well done and sports computer animations that would put television Sci-Fi movies like Battlestar Galactica to shame.  Suggestions on how diverse alien life forms could turn out to be will leave you thinking long after the movie is over.  Somewhere along the way though, it all falls completely apart, as if the original writers went on vacation and let the kids from the local kindergarten write the last 30 minutes of the show.  The 200-foot tall Gumby-like Strider creature walking on the Jello ocean will have you laughing until your sides hurt -- until you realize the writers are serious.  And it goes downhill from there.  If you can find this DVD used for a couple bucks, it's worth it.  $15 or more, buy a SETI book, read it, and bang it against your head a few times -- all more educational and enjoyable than this movie.",1209081600,2,1044,4.672131147540983
2325464,3,B0009VRHLA,"First off let me get some of the issues out of the way.

1) This movie is listed as widescreen with a 1:78:1 ratio and even the dvd case lists that but I have found this not to be true. On my HD widescreen tv the movie only looks correct when I set the tv screen mode to 4:3. I do have black bars on both top and bottom and on both sides of the picture but the movie image looks correct and is not stretched or distorted in any way. If I set my TV to 16:9 or Just Scan (which is the best setting for widesceen movies on my TV) the picture gets stretched and distorted and I still have black bars above and below the picture. Did anybody else have this issue?

UPDATE: There are 2 versions of this program. One from Sony pictures and this version has the screwed up aspect ratio but has great Dolby 5.1 sound. The other version is from Discovery communications and has the correct 1:78:1 aspect ratio but only 2.0 crappy sound. I see that the Sony version has been discontinued and another version has recently been released. Hopefully this version will have the CORRECT 1:78:1 anamorphic aspect ratio WITH the Dolby 5.1 sound!

2) As another reviewer pointed out already, there is definetly some missing scenes. I distinctly remember watching this movie on the discovery channel and seeing a scene in a swamp. The swamp had Giant Mushroom like plants and in the sky was a creature called a Sky Whale. The Sky Whale eventually was swarmed upon by flying insect like creatures. It was a very cool scene and is sadly missing from this DVD. It makes me wonder how many other scenes were deleted or omitted that no one has noticed. I also wonder if there is another version of this movie.

UPDATE: I have discovered that the missing scenes I and another reviewer mentioned are not missing at all. They are actually in an another but similar movie called Alien Worlds

As for the movie itself, I found it to be quite interesting. The concept is reasonable. Human created robots are sent to another planet about 65 light years away in search of alien life forms. 2 robots survive the landing initially and are programmed to study any life forms they encounter. One robot is programmed to take more risks and study animal like life forms and the other is programmed to be more conservative and study more non threatening basic and plant life forms. So far so good. As soon as alien life forms are encountered you can't help but feel that the creatures were designed too similar to earthly creatures. The alien trees look too similar to earthly trees. The sapsucker creature is similar to earth's flying squirrels. The creature that kills and eats the sapsucker looks like a giant bat, the land roaming creatures look like dinosaurs and so on. There are a few really cool creatures however, especially the hovering ones at the end of the movie that don't take a liking to the robots, I won't give it completely away :-) But most of the creatures encountered don't seem too alien enough for my liking and there aren't enough of them. I have seen deep sea creatures on earth that look more alien then some of the ones shown in this movie.

The bottom line is that the movie was entertaining enough, has some neat interviews with scientists and other notable people. The picture and sound quality is very good (minus the aspect ratio mentioned above). I was a little disappointed in the designs of the alien life forms but other viewers may not be. I did get some enjoyment from watching this movie and it is cheap enough (about $12) I guess all I really wanted was to get my moneys worth of entertainment and I did.",1207872000,2,3604,4.486280487804878
2325465,4,B0009VRHLA,"I love sci-fi - watching it, reading it and writing it. I would highly recommend this work because of the alien creatures that were developed for it. Although it does drag with redundant footage it's bearable (That was only because it had aired with commercials. They attempted to keep you at suspense with the next alien creature coming up).
I had noticed that they had removed one part of the show for the disk. It was an encounter with a ""sky whale"". It was great scene. It showed the sky wales in the air until one of them flew too low and was attacked by a hundred small insects. It was actually my favorite creature in it.
Does anyone know why it was removed?
Anyway, the work is good.

2325466,1,B0009VRHLA,"I love Wayne Barlowe's book ""Expedition"", which this video is based on, and I really don't think the video does it justice for a number of reasons.

As weird as it sounds, what really gets under my skin is that the people presenting this information on the video are scientists, but they're scientists presenting made-up creatures as though we'd actually found them on another planet already.  I love science and I love art and I love the way Wayne Barlowe presented his book through a sci-fi lens, but I feel like the real scientists here sold out.  Scientists, even when ""at play"" as they are here, should be held to a higher standard.  They should not be taking the director's instructions in order to make it sound like this is a discovery that's already been made.  Modern people have enough trouble understanding that science is a process and not some sort of magic or religion.

Anal retentive.. maybe.  But even putting that aside, the book still gives you a better look and a better understanding of Barlowe's masterpiece.",1194652800,9,1031,4.758426966292135
2325467,5,B0009VRHLA,I found this 'documentary' interesting in that the scientists and animators didn't fall into the trap of believing something can't exist because we don't have it on earth. It was excellently made and present a believable scenario.,1183766400,2,230,5.243243243243243
2325468,3,B0009VRHLA,"""Alien Planet"" is pure science fiction, don't try to make it something it is not.  I see where the comparisons to ""Future is Wild"" are drawn as they are both fun, animated visions of what fantasy artists/writers can dream up.  In reality, like future geographic constructions, life in the future or life on other planets is strictly unpredictable.  Most of the organisms on this alien planet seem to be amalgams of extant Earth creatures.  Most are bipedal or arboreal, bearing strong resemblances to modern animals on our own planet.  I got the impression that the artists may have watched the Beatles' ""Yellow Submarine"" a few times before inventing these creatures as many resemble the Vacuum Beast that sucks up everything!  Even the two droids exploring the planet are very anthropomorphic in their appearance.  Most scientists agree that life on other planets will probably not resemble anything on our planet and may not even be carbon-based.  Certainly, exploratory probes will look like typical NASA constructs: very mechanical.

That is why this film should be viewed for fun.  It is not based on any data or any scientific expectation.  In fact, only a handful of astrobiologists are included as interviewees.  The diversity of scientists seems to be an attempt to validate the project since none of these great minds has any inkling of what could be out there.  Besides, what do Stephen Hawking, Jack Horner and Michio Kaku know about astrobiology?  In fact, I would say that the scientific interviews were more of a drawback than anything else.  Many were out-of-sequence, or had nothing to do with the subject at hand.  I often phased out during those interludes.  It did seem that many were having fun, however.

The animation was great, and the DVD looks good on the big screen, but the sound fades out in a few places.  Another reviewer commented on the commercial breaks and, I must admit, that is a big problem with this disc.  Where the commercials were, the producers have left in the ""...when we return, this will happen..."" segues and this is very distracting.

If the sound was consistent, the commentaries and commercial breaks were left out and a few more creatures were added, I would give this DVD five stars.  Unfortunately, those factors reduce my evaluation to only three.  It is still a lot of fun to watch.",1181520000,6,2339,4.895674300254453

Just wanted to let folks know that an early and--for it's time, especially--dazzling speculation on life on other planets can be found in the ""Mars and Beyond"" episode of Disney's 1950s TV show. That episode is included in the Disney Treasures ""Tomorrowland"" DVD collection and it's a color Disney animated short produced by Ward Kimball.

The Disney team really pulled out all the imagination stops in that one, literally pushing at the boundary on our ability to even grasp alien life, which is stuff astonishing for the era. Plus it's gorgeous Disney animation.

That entire Tomorrowland set is worth owning--among other gems included with it is a live-action trip to the Moon (no landing, first trip is just there, around, and back--just like what happened!)and Dr. von Braun and team explaining space-flight, plus some very funny, hip, and irreverent Kimball-heavy cartoons.

 My first take on this movie is that it is a captivating experience for anyone 9+ up who could sit through 94 minutes of a semi-educational documentary. In my own opinion,this is just about my favorite movie.

 Any one under the age of 9 might either:

  1: Get freaked out by the weird images

  or

  2: Get really bored.

 Overall,I absolutely love this movie!!!

 What I find particularly interesting is the Eosapien,a jellyfish-like being . There was a freaky scene at the end of the movie,which was one point where there was so much confusion that I had to replay the scene over and over again to finally understand exactly what happened.

2325477,4,B0009VRHLA,"I had a bit of epiphany watching this program. I thought it would be fun and keep the interest but I did not expect much in the way of ""science"". After all, the subject matter is so speculative that anything presented has to be almost to the realm of ""fantasy"". Still, I thought it would be interesting. It was.

The show poses as a science documentary about the first robotic mission to another planet outside of our own solar system and then goes on to document the ""discoveries"" and have reputable scientists ""explain"" what we are seeing in terms of the life forms. Since we have never found life on other planets and have never sent anything to another solar system, it had to be speculation. It was.

I had hoped that the speculations would be rational and well thought out. I hope that the ""data"" presented would bear some resemblance to real science. It did.

I did not think so at first. The fauna got more and more incredible with each segment. There were some truly strange and weird creatures presented. I thought it was getting less and less plausible. I was wrong.

One of the real scientists on the show made a good observation and set me thinking. We don't know ANYTHING about what is out there. No matter how much we speculate, we are bound to be wrong. However strange we might view these ""creatures"", reality is liable to be much stranger. Viewed in that light, this program was not only entertaining, it was edifying as well.

This program is based on the book ""Expedition"" by Wayne D. Barlowe.  (He was also executive producer and he makes comments in this program.)  It is narrated by John C. McGinley (of the TV show ""Scrubs"").  The program was filmed entirely on location in Iceland and Mono Lake, California.

This computer-animated program simulates a voyage or mission to an exoplanet (a planet not of our solar system).  Here are the particulars of this mission:

(1) Exoplanet name: Darwin 4, an Earth-like planet.
(2) Location: In a binary solar system.  (This is a system where a pair of stars orbit about each other, held together by their mutual gravitational attraction.)
(3) Distance from Earth: 6.5 light years.  (A light year is the distance light travels in a year, namely 5,880 billion miles).
(4) Decision: to send a robotic spaceship to Darwin 4.
(5) Reason for Decision: To investigate for possible life, especially microscopic life.  If any intelligent life is found, attempt contact.
(6) Ship's name: von Braun.
(7) Speed or velocity of ship: 20% of c.  (""c"" is the speed of light, namely 186 thousand miles per second.)
(8) Number of probes with artificial intelligence to be deployed once Darwin 4 is reached: 3.
(9) Names of probes: Balboa, Da Vinci (""Leo""), and Newton (""Ike"").

Once the probes are on Darwin 4, they encounter much more than just microscopic life.  They find themselves in the middle of a developed ecosystem teeming with a diversity of life of all sizes.

Throughout the program are comments made by mainly scientists.  Noteworthy scientists include Stephen Hawking and Michio Kaku.  A noteworthy non-scientist was George Lucas.  All their comments are interesting.

The computer animation in a word is--fantastic.  Except for a few spots, I found it difficult to believe the creatures etc. I was seeing were computer generated!

I found that some of the comments made in this program were debatable.  As well, I did find one numerical error:  we are told that the robotic ship would take about 42 years to reach this exoplanet.  But if you plug in the appropriate numbers (see above) into the equation: Distance = (Speed X Time), you get about 32 years!  Also the creatures on this planet are blind relying on sonar.  But oddly, communication is attempted through visual means!  However, since this program is so absorbing, most viewers will probably not notice these problems.

Finally, the DVD itself is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has two extras.  The first extra is interviews with four scientists, most notably Stephen Hawking and Michio Kaku.  These are interesting but Hawking gives more of an extended commentary than an interview.  Strangely, the second extra is a preview of a motorcycle customization show.  Why this was included, I do not know.

In conclusion, this program can be summarized in an equation: (Science + Speculation + Imagination) = Unique Show!!!

This is not a DVD for those who subscribe to the religious notion of Intelligent Design, however. The DVD calls on one to think of the so many variables associated with scientific evolution.

Also, Alien Planet seems to drag and there seems to be very few alien creatures in the show with little or no details about these creatures.  I have to agree with the kid's review that said the book by Wayne D. Barlowe is better.

I do not have cable or satellite television, and so did not see this when it aired on Discovery Channel, but I knew about it, and I was so excited that they finally decided to do a CG ""documentary"" of Barlowe's incredible Expedition (1990), which is, as another reviewer observed, the first and only really serious 'what if'- type exploration of the possibilities of an extraterrestrial ecosystem - not about little green men - an entire world crafted lovingly and exquisitely by a master painter.  Expedition was created in the great alternative/speculative-evolution tradition of Dougal Dixon's After Man, New Dinosaurs and Man After Man (Dixon, by the way, helped create The Future is Wild).  So, I've been dying to see Alien Planet and got a copy yesterday when it was released.  I was worried, however, that they would mess up such a complex and beautiful thing as Expedition by trying to bring it to the screen, especially when I saw that the thing was only about $10.

  I needn't have worried!  It surpassed all my expectations.  Though they understandably changed the 'story' a little (perhaps for the better), Alien Planet is very faithful to the look and vision of Expedition.  Darwin IV looks crisp and alive and glorious and real!  The computer animation is so well done.  They left out some of the animals shown in the book, but not many.  I liked the idea of the robotic probes.  By the way, for those who haven't seen the book Expedition (which is presented the same way he later presented the landscapes and denizens of Hell in Barlowe's Inferno - as something like a far-traveling naturalist's journal with accompanying paintings, much like an expedition notebook of, say, Audubon or Charles D. himself or one of the pioneer naturalists of the past centuries), Darwin IV is a life-filled Mars-sized planet that we explore a couple of centuries from now, filled with wild and beautiful vistas and populated with a vast and sometimes deadly array of unprecedented echolocating animals, some of them, due to the lower-than-Earth gravity, achieving sizes many times that of the largest sauropod dinosaurs of Earth (I might add, also, that the aliens in the movie Pitch Black certainly seem to be extremely Barlowesque!).  My only reservation about Alien Planet is that, although it does say ""based on the book Expedition by Wayne Barlowe"" at the opening and closing, they do not go to great lengths to make this evident:  Wayne's screentime commentary segments are very minor compared to those of the more famous scientists such as Horner and Hawking, who are only trying to help lend the credibility of scientific authority to this speculative vision of a creative genius interested in the possibilities of an alternative natural history to that of our own world.  This is not those scientists' creation at all, but one man's brainchild.  When he is shown, it merely says ""author and artist"", and viewers might be thinking ""who is this guy?""

As they explore the planet, they encounter various strange and unusual, but scientifically plausible, life-forms ranging from the tiny 'jet-darters' to the colossal 'sea striders', and even the intelligent alien 'Eosapiens'. Between encounters are commentaries by various scientists such as Seth Shostak of SETI and Michio Kaku, explaining how such creatures could have come about in the earthlike environment of the planet Darwin IV. If you're at all interested in plausible alien life, are a science buff, or just like seeing strange creatures, then this video is for you. As I mentioned, the creatures depicted are all fairly plausible for their enviroment, and the scientific explanations are reasonably easy to understand, given in everyday language rather than complex technical jargon, making this show accessible to the non-biologists among us. It's also moderately entertaining, akin to watching a nature documentary about life here on Earth, but (obviously) set on another planet. If you like this video, I'd also recommend the book it was based on, since Wayne Barlowe (the illustrator and writer of Expedition) has obviously done his homework in designing the alien creatures featured here.",1470700800,,1686,5.294776119402985

After a forty-two year journey, Von Braun arrives and deploys a reconnaissance satellite and surface probes to investigate the planet. The probes begin exploring and quickly find a variety of strange plant and animal life. This special uses CGI to bring to life this strange world and commentary from scientists such as the famed Dr. Michio Kaku.

Alien Planet is a special that aired on the Discovery Channel in 2005 that speculated what life on another planet might be like. It is based on the book ""Expedition"" by Wayne Barlowe.

I admit I loved this special years ago when I was younger and I recently returned to it to see how it held up. Unfortunately, I found it to be a rather poor presentation for what it intends to be. The biggest problem with this special is the fact that it is almost entirely based on a piece of science fiction rather than more realistic speculation. The result is a world filled with creatures that simply make no sense. The scientists' commentary during this is pretty ridiculous as they try to take seriously made up animals. That is the other major issue. The creatures seem like something that belong in a science fiction movie but this special takes it all much too seriously. One other issue is that this special, already ten years old, looks quite dated. The CGI shown often seems bland with sparse and boring landscapes.

Most of the creatures seem to be anatomically impossible, and the show goes completely mustang when the probes encounter a monstrous intelligent octopus with the ability to float in the air! If Alien Planet teaches us something, it's that you shouldn't mix science with science fiction Dougal Dixon's classical book After Man is much more believable as futuristic evolutionary scenarios go.
