2246802,3,B0007WQH6C,"Unlike other Thomas DVDs, this special edition DVD contains live action segments featuring the life-size Thomas train that travels the country. So unless you want to be hounded every day until Thomas stops in your area, do not get this DVD. You have been warned! The live action segments also feature some of the most unattractive children ever shot on tape and a revisionist Thomas history that begins with Britt Alcroft and not with Rev. W. Awdry. If none of this phases you, you get a good number of Thomas stories for the price.",1142035200,12,532,4.670212765957447
2246803,2,B0007WQH6C,"This is a DVD with footage of a ""Come Out and Meet Thomas"" day mixed in between the episodes.  Sort fo a promotional piece to be honest.  Still decent enough to rent.  The DVD extras are limited and not very good.  My son seems to like it o kay but it gets pushed aside for more interactive stuff to be found on Sodor Celebration.  There is also a ton of toys shown during the ""party/interview"" footage which can be a good or bad thing depending on how much you need to control that sort of thing with your child.  Also I for one get annoyed at the interviewes not sure why they just annoy me. This production has the feel of an old VHS video copied to DVD without much added to it.  I wouldn't throw it out but I wouldn't buy it either.",1135814400,2,737,4.076388888888889
2246804,1,B0007WQH6C,"My 2 year old son is huge Thomas fan.  This DVD has long introductions to each story in which children and adults are interviewed - my son couldn't care less.  He just wants to see trains!  We have a portable DVD player, and it is a big pain to try to fast forward past these introductions, and he (and I) just ends up frustrated.  My advice - pick another DVD.",1131926400,11,361,4.114285714285714
2246805,4,B0007WQH6C,"This DVD is the ""Commemorative Collector's Edition"" of the *10 Years of Thomas & Friends* video that was released in 1999, and comes with a wooden Alfie vehicle by Learning Curve.  It includes footage of the ""A Day Out with Thomas"" event held at the Strasburg Railroad in Pennsylvania, during which children selected their favorite episodes for inclusion in the video.

Since the episodes contained in this DVD have been reviewed pretty thoroughly for the VHS version, I won't comment too much on them.

Both the image and sound quality on the DVD transfer are fairly good. The DVD programming, however, leaves something to be desired.  You cannot skip the logos and ads at the beginning of the DVD, nor forward through Sir Topham Hatt's introduction to the DVD features--at least, not on my DVD player (I was able to skip and fast forward using WinDVD on the PC).

The ""Bonus Features"" are rather unexceptional.  The ""Build an Engine"" game is best suited for young preschoolers:  you add parts to Thomas, James, or Toby.  The ""Sing-Along"" doesn't display the song lyrics, like on the ""Best of..."" DVDs, so singing along can be a challenge if you don't know all the words.  The ""Read-Along"" story seems to be a scanned version of the storybook, and not very interactive, except for clicking on the arrows.  The ""Character Gallery"" consists of brief bios of 16 engines, plus Sir Topham Hatt.  And as for the link to the official Thomas website, well, you don't need this DVD to visit the site.

Many reviews for the VHS version denigrate the footage from ""A Day Out with Thomas,"" but I actually enjoyed the footage of the Strasburg Railroad and life-sized Thomas.  The interviews with children and parents, though, did grow tiresome after a few viewings.  However, the ""Day Out"" footage actually was one reason I bought this DVD, since I planned to take my 2 year-old son to that very event at the Strasburg Railroad.  I didn't want my son to be afraid when he saw the actual Thomas steam engine in real life, since it's a lot bigger than his wooden Thomas train!

My son enjoys all the episodes, although his attention sometimes flags about halfway through the DVD, so we usually just watch a few episodes (right now, his favorite train DVD is *Big Trains, Little Trains*).  It's a pretty good collection of George Carlin era episodes.  My son couldn't care less about the narrators at this point, but my favorites have always been Ringo Starr and George Carlin.  I used to watch ""Shining  Time Station"" with my younger brothers back in the 80s.  George Carlin does a great job characterizing the different engines and people.

I'd recommend this to any Thomas and Friends fan or anyone who loves trains. Now my son gets excited and says ""Thomas Train!"" whenever we put this movie in.",1432944000,2,421,4.0843373493975905

After getting through the LONG introduction (to get to the ""Play the episodes"" option), there is then the way too long interview with fans of Thomas. To add insult, using the chapter fast forward doesnt get you to the actual episode but past that and on to the next interview segment. If we gave stars for frustration, this would get 10 stars.

The actual episodes are fine... they are the older ones before they animated the faces of the trains and went to cartoon format. It doesnt bother us, and is more close to the experience of having a book read while looking at a picture.",1412294400,,708,4.53125

2246884,5,B0007WQH6C,This movie is an absolute winner with our grandsons.  Whenever they visit they ask for Thomas and no matter how many times they have seen it they still want to see it again.  The two-year-old can even sing some of the songs.,1394668800,,224,4.309523809523809

My two year old does not have any interest in the between episode segments where parents and kids talk about their feelings for Thomas.  I think it may have mads an interesting documentary for older kids who had liked Thomas as small children but for little kids, it does not hold their interest long enough to get to the next story.  Perhaps if the video allowed you to skip the segments or turn them off like the producer notes in movies, it would be a nicer experience.",1318982400,,546,4.44

However, between each story, it also has interviews with parents and their kids about what they like about Thomas. As I parent, I'm not interested in this, and I know that my 3 year old would rather watch Thomas than a bunch of strangers any day. Plus, the sing-along section has one song. One. We have other Thomas videos that has at least 4, and they aren't special DVD's, just normal Thomas collections. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, if you are looking for solely Thomas stories and can find other collections.",1303084800,,644,4.608695652173913
2246923,3,B0007WQH6C,I bought the DVD thinking it would be back to back episodes of Thomas with no interruptions.  Instead it has footage of a Thomas event and children and adults giving reviews of Thomas and their favorite episodes.  I found it cheesy and annoying.  My son loves Thomas and I hoped it would be strictly the episodes and not other footage.  Thankfully the footage between the episodes is brief enough to tolerate the video.,1300838400,,419,4.698630136986301
2246924,1,B0007WQH6C,"Unless I missed something, there are only one or two actual episodes on this DVD.  The rest is a long commercial for the Thomas the Train centers and an ode to Ms. Allcroft.  Waste of money.",1300233600,,190,4.25
2246925,5,B0007WQH6C,Great DVD.  My three year old can't get enough of Thomas and the trains on the island of Sodor.,1298592000,,95,4.0
2246926,5,B0007WQH6C,My son loves this movie because it includes clips of Day Out With Thomas and features real kids talking about their favorite parts of Thomas movies or Thomas characters.  Great for the toddler crowd!,1293321600,,199,4.852941176470588
2246927,1,B0007WQH6C,"I never write reviews but I just felt compelled after I saw this video. It's 70% listening to parents and kids think about Thomas and maybe 30% Thomas related. What is worse is that you have to fast forward through a bunch of the rambling in order to see what amounts to a 5 minute story. And, there is only one song in the ""Sing A Long"". I really liked Thomas stories after watching them on PBS with my daughter. Next time, I will try to find those stories on video. They actually last about 15 minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people I don't know.",1290384000,5,565,4.2407407407407405
2246928,4,B0007WQH6C,"My son enjoys watching Thomas and Friends. It's one of the only shows he will sit still for. Having 10 years of the best shows for him to watch is a joy and a treat for him.

Thanks again,

2246929,5,B0007WQH6C,Kids loved it! It was a nice addition to the grandkids Thomas train set. They watch the video everyday!,1266969600,,103,4.473684210526316
2246930,5,B0007WQH6C,This was a great gift for a great price. My nephew loves it. He watches it over & over. I bought some other Thomas the Train gifts to go along with this DVD and it was a great hit. The product shipped on time & the quality was great too.,1265068800,,237,3.76
2246931,2,B0007WQH6C,My children get easily bored with this video. I thought it was several episodes of Thomas but it has A LOT of just children and parents talking about Thomas and all. It doesn't keep the kids attention because what kid wants to sit and listen to a bunch of talking. This was my first Thomas video purchase...hopefully the next will have more shows and less talking!,1264982400,5,364,4.53030303030303
2246932,4,B0007WQH6C,Good video for the kids.  The only thing I did not like are the in between interviews between stories.  I would have liked everything to flow easier.,1263081600,,149,4.481481481481482
2246933,5,B0007WQH6C,"My son loves this video!!!  He keeps asking to see ""big Thomas"" - he enjoys the stories, but really loves the scenes from the Day out with Thomas!",1257120000,2,146,4.214285714285714
2246934,5,B0007WQH6C,"apart from it arriving broken the first time, my kids are loving this DVD, which I alternate with the other I purchased to keep my own sanity.  This DVD has created a Thomas fan out of my 3 1/2 yr. old daughter as well.",1254182400,3,219,3.977272727272727
2246935,5,B0007WQH6C,"My son has several of the Thomas DVDs, and while he's just as content to watch any of them, this is his favorite. The episodes with Bertie and Terrance are great. Overall, a wonderful collection of earlier Thomas narrated by George Carlin. The interviews with kids are cute and provide more than just the usual shots of various engines. I find this DVD better than the ""Best of"" engines ones because of the variety. Plus, my son has no clear favorite and enjoys watching them all.",1245715200,14,480,4.593023255813954
2246936,3,B0007WQH6C,"The picture showed two engines, one gold and one blue with number ""1"".
But the one I got isn't includes those two trains. It came with two blue trains.
The DVD are 63 minutes and 60 minutes Bonus Features. My kids love it!",1238803200,,222,4.186046511627907
2246937,2,B0007WQH6C,Has too many interviews with people at the Live THomas day in Penn.  My kids were annoyed and hated this DVD.,1223510400,,109,4.190476190476191
2246938,3,B0007WQH6C,"There are ten Thomas & Friends episodes on this 60-minute DVD. These are not just Thomas stories, but a mixture of episodes supposedly picked by children who went to the A Day With Thomas event in Penn. at some point.  Preceding each story is a 40-second or so clip from the event, with parents and children commenting on the TV series.  You cannot skip these with the skip button; you can fast-forward, but that's a hassle, isn't it?  This is why some customers are understandably upset.

But my two-year-old actually likes the footage from the event -- set to his favorite T&F songs -- more than the stories themselves.  Most of his favorite episodes are not here, so he ends up only watching the event footage and clapping every time he sees the mock-up Thomas train with all the happy children onboard.

If you own few other Thomas videos, I think this is a decent value, with ten episodes that more or less represent the T&F series.  That is, pretty much every episode finds the engines ""cross"" -- I'm starting to get real sick of that word!",1222387200,12,1046,4.561497326203209

2246941,1,B0007WQH6C,"This video is really a disappointment, it came with a Thomas piece so naturally my daughter picked it and I thought the bonus ""feature"" wouldn't be mixed in with the actually Thomas stories but I was wrong. My daughter easily lost interest when the people would come on and talk about loving Thomas and getting to ride the real Thomas train... I was totally annoyed.",1170460800,4,366,4.6461538461538465
2246942,5,B0007WQH6C,My 4 yr old loves Thomas.  This dvd has over ten shows and even more.  I love this dvd.,1168905600,2,87,3.526315789473684
2246943,4,B0007WQH6C,"Marking the 10th Anniversary of Thomas videos (certainly NOT the stories themselves), this sampler covers a fine cross-section of Thomas adventures (though they are presented out of order), musical numbers (all catchy and certain to infect your child's brain along with yours), and interviews with people of all ages visiting ""A Day Out With Thomas.""  I was fortunate enough to catch one of these outings a few years backs, but since I am a parent of a child with a severe developmental disability, I got more of a chance to ""experience"" the day on the video than I did in person.

Anyway, this is a nice hour of Thomas magic and a good introduction to see whether Thomas is right for your child.  Highly recommended here.",1166745600,5,722,4.714285714285714
2246944,2,B0007WQH6C,"All the interspersed kid and parent interviews where they talk about all the trains they have just feels like a thinly disguised effort to sell more product.

It's also AWFULLY frustrating that you can't jut buy the DVD Series here as you can in the UK, but have to make do with compilations where there are invariably episode duplications.
