5942598,5,B00ESZZOEA,"From the fiery embers of defeat, the Autobots struggle to reunite and overcome loss and separation at the merciless hands of the Decepticons in ""Transformers: Prime Season Three,"" the climatic final TV series adventures of the brave sentient robots from the planet Cybertron. The fate of Team Prime has never been so dark and the stakes have never been higher. But the future still offers hope from surprising sources...including the courageous Autobot who remains their greatest inspiration.

This 2 DVD (or Blue-Ray) collection features the last 13 episodes of this grand computer animated series. ""Season Three"" was half the length of the first and second seasons, bringing the show's total number of episodes to 65; the episode production number traditionally utilized in television syndication for a 13 week, Monday through Friday broadcast format. This is a disappointing reality for this Transformers fan, as I would have been more than happy to see this series continue for another 65 episodes!

As the third season of ""Transformers: Prime"" begins, the mountain base of the Autobots has been discovered and destroyed by their enemies, the Decepticons. The populace of the neighboring town of Jasper, Nevada has been evacuated by the United States government to prevent possible civilian casualties from being caught up in the Cybertronian conflict. The victorious Megatron, master of the Decepticons, revels in his apparent conquest of his ancient foes, standing in the flaming wreckage of Team Prime's lost home, in the shadow of his new citadel, Darkmount. Buried in the burning debri, Autobot leader Optimus Prime lies mortally wounded. A gloating Starscream,
Megatron's second in command, proclaims:

""This is the dawning of a new age, my Liege. The age of Megatron!""

But while things are bleak for the heroic Autobots, ""scattered to the winds"" after escaping their ill-fated base, not all is lost. Team Prime regroups and meets an old comrade, Ultra Magnus, who comes to Earth in search of his fellow Autobots. Together, they choose to fight on, despite their despair in defeat: and Megatron soon learns that not even the explosive collapse of a mountain can snuff out the spark of Optimus Prime!

The war against good and evil continues. But just as the Autobots gain a new ally, so too do the Decepticons in the form of Shockwave, a coldy logical scientist, who comes from the devastated world of Cybertron to Earth with the results of one of his science projects: a clone of a long extinct Cybertronian beast, a Predacon. As the story of ""Transformers: Prime Season Three"" unfolds, this resurrected creature plays a major role in the ultimate fates of the Decepticons and the Autobots.

The third season of ""Transformers: Prime"" continues the serial narrative storytelling style introduced in season two of the TV series, as the Autobots become ""Beast Hunters,"" searching for the fossilized remains of ancient Predacon clones sent to Earth many millennia ago by Megatron, during the centuries-long war for Cybertron. Their goal is to prevent Shockwave from producing an army of Predacons, a threat that could tip the scale of the ""perpetual conflict"" in the favor of the Decepticons. But things grow complicated not just for Team Prime but also for Megatron and his minions as the power of the Predacon is more fully revealed.

""Prime Season Three"" develops at an exciting, action-packed pace complimented by a rewarding deepening of the character interplay between the expanding cast of heroes and villains. The series' voice cast continues to be a delight as they help bring the show's characters to animated life. The computer animated production also impresses as the human and robot characters are beautifully realized in a richly designed world. For example, the robotic dragon Predacon is an awesomely realized force of Cybertronian nature, and his attacks on Team Prime as ""the ultimate Autobot hunter"" are thrilling battles to behold. The beast's cavern confrontation with Ultra Magnus and Wheeljack in the episode ""Evolution"" is one of the most intense knock-down, drag-out fights this reviewer has seen in a Transformers cartoon. But it is all the more impressive because of the character conflict built up between the pair of Autobots during the course of the season. Despite their differences, when the time comes, Wheeljack and Ultra Magnus become true comrades-in-arms. Character relationships are more fully fleshed out in these final episodes of ""Transformers: Prime."" From Bumblebee's subtle mentoring of Smokescreen in ""Project Predacon,"" the affection young ""Raf"" reveals for Rachet in ""Persuasion,"" to the comedic chemistry between Starscream and Knock Out, showcased to funny effect in the episode ""Thirst,"" the third season of ""Transformers: Prime"" reminds its audience of the wealth of characters featured in this great series. For viewers of all ages, the show becomes not just a thrilling  science-fiction adventure series, but also a surprising showcase of what Optimus Prime helped explain to Ultra Magnus: ""a human concept; family.""

Still it should not be forgotten that the ""family"" of Team Prime, human and Cybertronian, bonded while having some truly amazing adventures. From travels to other dimensions, the depths of the Earth to the rusted remains of the world of Cybertron, ""Transformers: Prime"" was a joy to watch! As Jack Darby expressed to his Autobot partner Arcee:

""It's been quite a ride!""

The ""Transformers: Prime Season Three"" DVD set includes audio commentaries to 7 episodes, a feature on the ""Transformers: Prime"" Panel at the San Diego Comic-Con International 2013 plus an ""Extended Scene"" from the third season's climatic episode, ""Deadlock.""

This DVD collection comes with this Transformers fan's highest recommendation!

Long live Optimus Prime...and Team Prime!!",1386115200,8,5835,5.295135135135135
5942599,5,B00ESZZOEA,"This is the most hard to get show, Why because i tried nearly every store around me and No one carried it so once again have to buy it online, I am not sure why when other movies get to be at the stores, I also have to buy it on DVD since i only really get things from amazon and not up to the idea of getting from third parties when it just came out, the show i have been waiting a while for.
They are doing a great job with the shows and hope season 4 will come out sometime Again not happy how amazon shipped my Item and seemed to be in Limbo for a while In Kansas, wow, Slow speed, I had to Finally buy it at the store
For that i am giving it 2 stars now for only the shipping, and 4 stars for the show,
I was not happy i had to buy it at the store that finally got it",1386028800,,772,3.6011904761904763
5942600,4,B00ESZZOEA,"This is the final action packed season of Transformers Prime: Beast Hunters. This season starts off with the Autobots scattered and badly damaged after losing their base to the Megatrons. Can they unite and defeat the Megatrons, Predacons and Insecticons? Not only do they have to save earth, but Cybertron is in danger as well. There are thirteen episodes in total which offers nearly five hours of robotic smashing fun. There is plenty of violence and robotic experimentation going on, and this show is best suited for grade school boys. My kindergartner son was sort of interested in this show, but his older cousin loved it. After you finish watching this season, make sure you check out the finale Beast Hunters: Predacons Rising. You won't be sorry!",1385424000,,755,4.952755905511811
5942601,4,B00ESZZOEA,"Transformers: Prime season 3 is the final season of the epic TV series. This season is only 13 episodes as opposed to the usual 26 episodes in the first two seasons. While it's not as great as season 1 or 2, season 3 is still a great season of an even greater show.

Season 3 starts right after season 2, which is pretty much the Autobots' darkest hour. Megatron has taken over, the Autobots and humans are scattered across America, and Optimus Prime is crushed under what once was the Autobots' base. When it comes to stories' quality, nothing has changed. However, the way that they're told is different. Instead of having each episode have its own beginning, middle, and end, each episode is more like a chapter in a book, where it pretty much always ends in a cliffhanger. When I first watched this season, I found this quite annoying. However, if you watch it on Netflix or DVD, it's much more enjoyable. Still, I prefer the original season's methods of storytelling over this one's.

Season 3 introduces even more characters than before. Ultra Magnus joins the Autobots, while the Decepticons get a new weapon: Predaking. I was pleasantly surprised at how they portrayed both characters. Ultra Magnus is unlikable, but intentionally, and Predaking is an invulnerable killing machine. Predaking's story, in particular, is very interesting. However, I didn't like how they made Smokescreen change his color scheme. Bumblebee had an okay reason, but changing two characters seem unnecessary.

Even though I have some gripes with it, season 3 of Transformers: Prime is still higher quality than any other action cartoon show today.

Season 3 Final Score: 8.7/10",1385078400,2,1663,4.949820788530466
5942602,5,B00ESZZOEA,"Transformers Prime Season 3 continues the Greatness! This season has alot of twist and turns that will keep you anticipating the next episode. You get some new characters on each side with Ultra Magnus on the Autobot side and the most menacing Predacon ever in Predaking. Personally I think Ultra Magnus is too much by the book,but he learns to work with his Autobot brothers with new tactics and is a key member of Team Prime. My favorite is Predaking with a new look and individuality that works awesome in the series. In the G1 days Predaking was a combiner that included five Predacons to make up Predaking,but in the Beast Hunters series he is his own badass robot with one cool as hell dragon mode. The human characters Jack,Miko,and Raf grow as individuals through the series and become even more vital members for Team Prime. Miko actually becomes a key member of the Wreckers with Wheeljack and Bulkhead while kicking Starscream around in the apex armor. Raf grows a stronger bond with Ratchet while Jack still provides leadership throughout. Arcee still proves she is best fembot around with amazing action scenes that all will love. Smokescreen grows more in the series responsibility wise with a new look while gaining greater respect from Team Prime. Shockwave has a plan with Project Predacon to finish off the Autobots,but this leads to a twist in the storyline that Megatron will regret. Optimus gets jacked up with a new more bulkier and beastly look which fits the Autobot commander very well. Optimus also has some battles with Predaking that are for the ages. The Omega Lock comes back into play as well as this makes a race against time for the Autobots to save not only Earth,but Cybertron as well. The graphics and animation throughout is still the best since the G1 days with amazing battle scenes that will blow your mind. Overall Season 3 has it all with awesome characters,cool storylines,and another thrill ride of energon fueled fun for all transformer fans. Bottom line Transformers Prime Season 3 Beast Hunters is a 10 out of 10 high quality collection of episodes that does the series proud. I highly recommend Transformers Prime Season 3 Beast Hunters to all transformer fans out there. Transformers Prime Rocks!!!",1379376000,16,2247,4.884816753926701
5942603,5,B00ESZZOEA,"Season three introduces Predaking whom i think is super-cool, especially when he learns he has the ability to transform. this is the final season in the Transformers Prime series and it's a great season. all the episodes are very, very good. SPOILER: Bumblebee gets his voice back and Kills Megatron with the Star-Saber but, Megatron is reborn by Unicron and then is Exorcised by Optimus. Megatron then disbands the Decepticons.

honestly, i would call this DVD: Transformers Prime: Season three, Part 1 because the Predacons Rising DVD is pretty much Season three Part 2.",1499472000,,572,5.085106382978723
5942604,5,B00ESZZOEA,Final season for Transformers Prime before the full length movie. Movie plays fine.,1498521600,,83,5.461538461538462
5942605,4,B00ESZZOEA,"I like this version of transformers in the sense that there are just a few characters, rather than the whole set of robots in the cannon. The script delivery by Ratchet is just awesome. The self interest of the decepticons is well portrayed. Script is OK I just wish the Autobots could stop being such roll-overs, always in need of optimus to bail them out. Starscream is also wonderfully portrayed and scripted/performed. Not quite at the 5 star level just cause the lack of death and destruction, and the sortof impotence the autobots endlessly portray, is a weak method to stretch out the series. Also, the toys are such crap even my little boy says he doesnt want one. I literally put a bumblebee toy in his hands and said hey lets get it. And he was like, no daddy this ruins it for me. WOW. A franchise rooted in toys becomes a media company and forgets how to make toys. Greed is at the heart of it.",1498176000,,906,4.398809523809524
5942606,5,B00ESZZOEA,"This series may have not lasted very long, but one good thing is the creators were given enough notice to craft a very satisfying end to it.

The stakes get raised even higher as the Autobots try to prevent the Decepticons final efforts to claim both Cybertron and Earth. Great action, twists and turns, and intense moments. Very happy with this last season.

***A note on what comes next with some spoilers***

The story does continue with the Predicons Rising mini-movie and the following RID series, but personally I like stopping here with a more positive ending. I found Rising to be rushed and rather sad due to Optimus' sacrifice. I watched the first few episodes of RID, and didn't care for it at all. Too much of a drastic tone change and ridiculously cartoonish characters.",1496707200,,783,4.742647058823529
5942607,5,B00ESZZOEA,"Review by child of Mominator  warning spoilers below

The final season of Transformers Prime thats tragic in and of itself. Optimus gets robust, we find out he has no idea what Agent Fowler is talking about half the time, Miko gets to fight a Decepticon (perhaps Mominators favorite scene ever), Wheeljack is now tolerating Ultra Magnus, Team Prime is a family, Agent Fowler and June are perhaps going to start dating, Shockwave shows up, Airachnid infects all the Insecticons, Knockout and Starscream turn scientists, Predaking can talk!, and Raf is turning into a mini Ratchetand it ends us here!?! One of the best incarnations of Transformers and it ends with 2.5 seasons. Be warned Season 3 only contains half the episodes of the first two seasons, 13 episodes with a cryptic interview and a trailer for Transformers Prime Beast Hunters; Predacons Rising (I posted a review for that too). All I can say is if you bought Season 1 or 2, buy this one. Just make sure youve got a box of Kleenex for the end collection of episodes. Also, if you love the TV show, the soundtrack helps you to relive it allwhen you're not rewatching it!

Be sure to tell Hasbro Studios how much you love this! Use the picture to know how to contact them. Dont forget to ask when they are going to make another TF show like it! Make sure to ask about Transformers Prime Powerful Alliances!",1493596800,,1368,4.644628099173554

Sadly this was the final season of the show, though there is the awesome, ""PRedacons Rising"" film that wraps things up, this is theend of the story that's been building since season 1. And what an ending. I've enjoyed a resurgence of my childhood shows like Masters of the Universe (2002), TMNT (2003), GIJoe: Renegades (2010), Thundercats (2012) and finally Prime. All of which have been good, but Prime seemed to do the best in terms of making it passed 2 seasons.

5942675,5,B00ESZZOEA,My preschooler is in love with transformers.  Thankfully there are three seasons and we can flip between them for some variety.  We have watched each episode dozens of times and we all still enjoy them.,1397520000,,202,4.742857142857143
5942676,5,B00ESZZOEA,"As a guy who grew up watching transformers back in the 80's, this show not only pays homage in many ways to that series, but also modernizes the property in all the right ways.  Excellent writing, amazing voice cast and stellar animation.  This is by far the BEST transformers property to date.  I only wish they had done a full 3rd season instead of a truncated  half season.  But the story is pretty tight, and ends in a pretty cool way.  If you are a parent though, be aware that this show might be too intense for little kids.  For big kids like myself though, this show is amazing!",1397174400,3,586,4.321100917431193
5942677,5,B00ESZZOEA,My son was expecting more than two disc's  but thats what there is.  We ordered it and it showed up in no time.  Prob the best Transformers ever.  Love it,1397001600,,154,4.033333333333333
5942678,5,B00ESZZOEA,"i loved all of these newer CG animated transformers series that have been on the Hub Network.  they are well made, well voiced and have good audio.  i purchased this, the last of the series and i've not been let down in any way shape or form!

if your a fan, if you have the other two seasons, this will do it for you.  highly recommended.",1396224000,,339,4.090909090909091
5942679,5,B00ESZZOEA,I was in love with this show and right when they made a twist they canned the series. the season should've been longer but we get what we get here and we actually get closure not like previous seasons ending on cliffhangers. on that note Im gonna miss this show,1394323200,,261,4.24
5942680,5,B00ESZZOEA,Great cartoon! Highly recommend this movie! Thanks again! A +  + + + + + + + + + +! Hasbro will Not be able to touch a series like this again! It was rushed a bit; however it was understandable seeing that season 3 got cut in half! Transformers Prime should be the standard to what all transformers series should try to live up too............!,1394236800,,344,4.212121212121212
5942681,5,B00ESZZOEA,"A great, albeit short season of this show. It's too bad this show was cancelled. Season 3 is an amazing contribution to the transformers mythos",1393200000,,143,4.76
5942682,5,B00ESZZOEA,"I started watching this with my sons, and my oldest fell head over heels when he heard Peter Cullens voice for Optimus Prime. He told me that it was same voice as my Transformers cartoon (referring to G1). I only wish they would have kept this show going longer, as we really liked it. Its the only Transformers cartoon my sons really liked since G1.",1392768000,,350,4.4
5942684,5,B00ESZZOEA,"Great series. Great acting, great 3D imaging. This is by far the best Transformers series since Beast Wars. This season moves the series forward into interesting and entertaining realms. It is worth watching if you're a fan of the previous two.",1392681600,,244,4.975609756097561

and I love this also.
The DVD arrived without any trouble luckly !",1391558400,,96,3.85
5942688,5,B00ESZZOEA,"Great storyline and a fitting conclusion to one of, if not the best, ""Transformers"" show of late. Voice acting is super. It's as if these animated characters were real! Only thing I don't like us is that the story ends. But all in all most satisfied.",1390867200,,250,4.456521739130435
5942689,5,B00ESZZOEA,"Season 2 dealt with the Autobots and Decepticons seeking ancient artifacts to tip the balance of their war one way or another and their human adversary Silas is seeking to gain technology and power from both sides in the meantime. In Season three, the Autobots have consolidated their strength once more in time to face the new threats Megatron has devised, a good thing too, because Megatron intends a terrible fate for Earth and finds a way to bring Cybertron back to life, but needs the help of Doctor Rachet to accomplish this. In the final climactic ending Prime and the Autobots must seek out his latest weapon and save both the Earth and the kidnapped Doctor Rachet at the same time.
This has been a surprisingly excellent series, the characters have more depth, having been allowed to grow since season one. While there are a few new characters, the Insecticons, Predaking, Smokescreen, the old ones have not lost their vigor, and there are even touches of humor in some of the interchanges, most notably the wild card, Starscream, whose constant digs and diatribes against anyone he encounters is guaranteed a least a chuckle from time to time, even though he has proven to still have a dark and even dangerous edge to his personality. The human characters still look good, and have managed to integrate themselves well into the group, having grown a little since the first season and are a little less edgy than they were at the start. All in all, a good series from start to finish.",1390435200,,1493,4.724137931034483
5942690,3,B00ESZZOEA,"I purchased this for my child that likes to watch this program. However, we noticed that two episodes were missing. Would have rated 5 stars if it wasn't for the omitted episodes.",1390262400,,179,4.625
5942691,5,B00ESZZOEA,It's the final best show ever made. I believe they should put predaking in tf age of extinction facing off unicron and have hes manace. or have frist time ever have predaking transformation with dinobot optimus prime. 100% grand,1389916800,,228,4.871794871794871
5942692,5,B00ESZZOEA,"I love this show. Season three kept to the quality writing and visual standards we've come to love about TP. However, knowing it was the last season for the show and having the Beast Hunter aspect to added to it I was expecting more from it. It seemed to drop the ball with regards to beast hunting to focus on a quicker way to end the show.",1389398400,,341,4.104477611940299
5942693,4,B00ESZZOEA,This is a well animated series about teamwork set in a land of (all too familiar good vs evil) humanity in peril.,1389398400,,113,4.181818181818182
5942694,4,B00ESZZOEA,"I was not aware until recently that this even existed, but thanks to a special feature from TP Season 3 I decided to get this.  It is a nice way to tie up the story and set the stage for the next iteration of Transformers.  Recommended.",1389312000,,236,4.108695652173913
5942695,5,B00ESZZOEA,The 3rd season was shorter than prior seasons so you are only getting 2 dvds.  The grandkids loved the Beast Hunter storyline and I enjoyed watching it with them.  There is a lot of enjoyable humor even for adults.  Good value for the money.,1389052800,,241,4.431818181818182
5942696,4,B00ESZZOEA,"If you are a fan of the original Transformers, the newer Transformers Prime series will not disappoint. The story line is more mature and works well for adults who grew up with the original cartoon. This last season is, in my opinion, the best of the entire series. I do not want to spoil too much here, but the addition of Ultra Magnus to the cast is awesome! Unfortunately, we do not get to see Megatron's transformation into Galvatron in this series. There are rumors that more seasons may be on the way. I sincerely hope so, as this one left me wanting more!",1388793600,2,562,4.413461538461538
5942697,5,B00ESZZOEA,"I loved this season and I think it was the last one too, but probably wrong... Anyway, superb job on the story and was great how it ended. I have the first 2 seasons and watched them back to back. I have to admit each season flowed great with the previous. Again, I hope I am wrong this being the final one. I would definitely recommend getting all 3 seasons so you won't miss anything.",1388275200,,386,4.16
5942698,4,B00ESZZOEA,"Can't believe its Over... Predcons Rising or what ever the movie is, makes a passable epilogue, but this magic 65 episode Limit Needs to be abandoned (even if it is 13 weeks of 5x a week  syndication) too many 'loose ends' if the next series isn't in the same universe",1388016000,,268,4.36
5942699,4,B00ESZZOEA,"While the commentary on the episodes with the director, artist ect. could be better like those with the voice actors are its is a short but extremely well done season.  It is one of the few cartoon shows in general not just Transformers series that practically wraps up all the shows loose ends.  What this season doesn't wrap up on the Predicon Raising movie does.  There are many elements of this series like Optimus Prime near his death bed that will pull on your heart strings as much as 1985 Movie did.  That is before Prime gets a bulk up make over which include ability to fly.  The series refers back to events that happened in the first two season like shadow zone and take an entirely new outlook on Prediking from past transformers series.  With the Decepticons going less with stealth and making themselves known to Jasper it also refects a bit of Generation 1 and Transformers Animated series.",1388016000,,906,4.63125

5942702,4,B00ESZZOEA,Ilike season 3 but i hate the fact that in every transformers series optimus prime as to be so overpowered always the strongest in the universe kind of thing i also did not like the final battle between megatron and optimus prime it felt rushed and anticlimactic it had no emotion u never get the sense that every other fight between the two gave a sense of rivalry of both been strong they just showed optimus kicking his behind up and down for 8 minutes simply because of his new body and that was a big letdown other then that the series ended better then most transformers series.,1387065600,,584,4.416666666666667
