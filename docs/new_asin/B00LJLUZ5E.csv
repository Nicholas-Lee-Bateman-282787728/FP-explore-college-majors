The only thing I had, which was a minor one, was the it didn't come with the sleeve and the plastic covering that the other boxes came with. I know it is used and it wouldn't come with everything. However the disc came in perfect condition, played fine in the PS4. Came with the book and the charm. Overall I am satisfied.",1485216000,,374,4.357142857142857
