3832539,3,B0021L8V3Y,"I know people usually say the book is better than the movie, and I really don't want to admit that it is completely true with Dear John. I loved the book so much and loved that I was able to feel their passion, heartache, and desire. When I went to watch the movie, I had a hard time feeling those emotions from the characters. I really like Channing and Amanda and I don't know if it really was just my love for the book and high expectations or if the ""it"" factor just wasn't there. I was also disappointed how they changed some characters, and perhaps that was enough of a distraction to truly appreciate the film.

Perhaps when the movie comes out on DVD, I will watch it again (and not read the book before hand) and see if my perception changes. I really am rooting for this movie though, because it is such a great story and I feel that Channing and Amanda suit the characters of John and Savannah really well.",1266883200,5,917,4.2701149425287355

But I don't understand the bad reviews Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried have a chemistry that adds to the relationship portrayed on screen. Tatum and Seyfried have also really come into their own their characters are convincing and you feel for them.

3832542,3,B0021L8V3Y,"Nicholas Sparks corners the market on sappiness.  Call to mind films that have been adapted from his novels (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Notebook-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/B000683VI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Notebook (New Line Platinum Series)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nights-in-Rodanthe/dp/B0017ANB08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nights in Rodanthe</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Walk-to-Remember/dp/B000P0J0DS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Walk to Remember</a>) where only the peeling and chopping of an onion produces more copious amounts of superfluous tears. Sparks always manages to interject the `jerk' into the action of tear jerking.

In ""Dear John,' director Lasse Hallstrom manages to add yet another bucket of crocodile tears to the already overflowing cry-me-a-river slough of the tragic romance genre.  The story unravels from the idea of the `Dear John' letter, a well-known device used in wartime by sweethearts writing to their soldier husbands and boyfriends when they tired of their lives as women-in-waiting, as in waiting for their men to return to them and give them a tangible relationship.  Typically, the men already lonely for their loved ones who received these dreaded letters were regarded with sympathy while the women who sent them forever bore the taint of the betrayer who could not support her man in a time where patriotism and sacrifice supercede personal desire. To a degree, the plotline of this film follows this standard theme with little variation other than the de rigueur maudlin touches that bespeak of Nicholas Sparks' trademark unhappy ending.
And what is that all about anyway?  Does some tragic mishap always have to befall the couple in question?  Does this stab of misfortune make the end result all the sweeter?  No.  Actually the pumped up emotional outpouring works for a while and then becomes almost ridiculous especially when presented in a two hour slot.

In this case, John played to pent-up perfection by Tatum Channing first lays eyes on the lovely golden haired Savannah (Amanda Seyfried) on a South Carolina beach in the usual boy meets girl scenario that suggests love at first sight. The two are inseparable and wonderful to watch; their chemistry is palpable--hers wide-eyed and unabashed, while his suggests a sense of being overwhelmed by emotions that he as a member of the army's special forces finds bares a vulnerability he wishes he did not have.  Channing expresses his anger and confusion with regard to a father with whom he has difficulty communicating and a toughness that is like a second skin except for the tell of a pulsing cheek that conveys a tight coiling of feeling suppressed like that of the inner mechanism of an over wound clock.  Seyfried also succeeds, initially depicting Sparks' Savannah with a youthful enthusiasm that portrays her youth, her hope and potential expertly.  She fails in the second act, perhaps because of the lessening of the script's power and reliance on the melodramatic, but mainly because she does not possess the experience to depict someone older who has suffered much.

Like all of Nicholas Sparks' vehicles, ""Dear John"" struggles for momentum in a too fast finish with too many convenient tragedies that either keep the lovers apart or brings them to an older portion of their lives that simply is not developed sufficiently.  Without giving away Savannah's reasoning for sending her John the `Letter,' suffice it to say that upon its receipt, the story snowballs to a too rapid conclusion with secondary characters that are hinted at but not fully fleshed out.  Savannah's reasoning seems silly, her decision almost impulsive.  Too much editing?  Maybe just trademark Sparks.

Bottom line?  ""Dear John"" boasts of two good performances by the two young lovers separated by war and their sense of duty.  However, as the story moves beyond the initial phase of devotion it seems rushed, careening towards an ending that smacks of the usual sappy sadness of which Nicholas Sparks is famous. There are moments of touching emotion but too much contrivance mars even these.  The rather anticlimactic ending fails to wow the audience with a further rush of real pathos. Actress Seyfried's performance wanes as her character ages which adds to the lackluster feeling of over manipulation and lack of nuance.  Nevertheless, recommended with the caveat that the film fails in its latter half too many plot threads tied before they are fully explored or explained.

3832543,5,B0021L8V3Y,"I can't say enough how pleased I am with how this film evolved. I knew what to expect, 'cause I cheated and read the end of the novel. I'm not a Sparks reader. So I went in with his ending in my head. Channing has grown by huge leaps since his first entry onto the big screen. But it was all the characters who drew me in and yes, Sparks had to have provided the structure for these great characters. I cried and cried. You just have to see the film to understand. Then years ago, I wouldn't have understood the characters motivation, wouldn't have accepted it. But ""Dear John"" sure helped put things in perspective for me. And so, I have to thank Mr. Sparks for part of this new acceptance of reality.",1265500800,2,702,4.246268656716418
3832544,3,B0021L8V3Y,"I really am stuck on this review.

I read Dear John before I ever saw the movie and I want to recommend doing that, simply because you'll understand parts of it better, that the movie doesn't describe too well.  However, I also want to say not to read the book before because you'll hate the ending and there are points in the movie that they changed that really had no reason to be changed in the first place.  Example?  The relationship between two key characters changes from brothers (in the book) to father and son (in the movie).  Really didn't need to be changed, it was actually alot easier to understand when they were brothers.

But, anywho, about the movie (which was still good and I still recommend seeing it):

The movie follows John Tyree (Channing Tatum&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Step-Up-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000J3OTSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Step Up (Widescreen Edition)</a>), a soldier in the US Army, who is home on leave and meets the young and beautiful Savannah Curtis (Amanda Seyfried&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mamma-Mia-The-Movie-Widescreen/dp/B001GKJ2DY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mamma Mia! The Movie (Widescreen)</a>).  For two weeks, they almost never leave each other's sides.  Two weeks and they fall in love.  However, John still needs to finish out his enlistment period, where he is stationed in Germany.  Savannah vows to wait for him until the end of his tour of duty.  They write each other constantly.  ""Dear John...""  ""Dear Savannah...""  A couple of months before the end of his tour, disaster struck.  9/11 brings out the patriotism of the American soldier and Tyree quickly finds himself struggling to make the decision between love or duty.

The movie is definitly one that you should see at least once, you may like it...or you may hate it.  I personally liked the book a whole lot more simply because things were described better in there and the fact that they fell in love after two weeks is a little bit more plausible because of the way you get to read their emotions.

Definitly a tear-jerker (my friend and I were bawling on each other).  The whole movie was great...up until about the last 2 minutes of it.  Even my friends who hadn't read the book said that it didn't seem to fit and that's because they completely changed it.  But, if you can overlook the last 2 minutes of the 1hr and 40ish minute long movie, then I say, ""Go for it!""",1265414400,,2490,5.234848484848484
3832545,3,B0021L8V3Y,"""Dear John"" is an unabashed tearjerker, a romantic melodrama that pumps the audience so full of sap, everyone is liable to leave the theater crying tears of pure molasses. Adapted from the novel by Nicholas Sparks, it's one of those stories where love is sweet, pain runs deep, and feelings are expressed through tender embraces, soft kisses, and phrases like, ""We'll be with each other all the time, even if we're not with each other at all."" By the end, I felt so emotionally manipulated that I was tempted to forget everything about it that worked and just dismiss it altogether. But a fact is a fact - there are things about it that work, most notably Channing Tatum, who, in spite of yet another role that gives him license to be shirtless, gives his best performance yet. It seems what he gave us in ""Fighting"" wasn't a total fluke.

He plays John Tyree, a young Special Forces specialist for the army with a history of causing trouble, most of which is only alluded to. In the summer of 2001, while on leave in his hometown of Charleston, he meets a college student from a rich family named Savanah Lynn Curtis (Amanda Seyfried), and the two immediately hit it off. But almost as soon as he arrives, it's time for him to leave again. Savanah is crushed. John makes her a promise, apparently not aware of the fact that in movies like these, promises were meant to be broken. They decide to correspond via handwritten letters, which they keep up over the next few months despite his grueling military operations overseas. Then things start getting in the way. 9/11 happens. John extends his tour of duty. And then, one day, Savanah stops sending him letters.

We meet a few important side characters. There's John's father (Richard Jenkins), an autistic coin collector who can find no topic of conversation other than his collection of coins. He also lives life according to a routine, baking meatloaf every Saturday and lasagna every Sunday. Then there's Savanah's close friend, Tim (Henry Thomas), a soft-spoken single dad who doesn't have the heart to tell his autistic son that his mother isn't coming back. They're both developed in ways that raise the question of why stories like this require someone to be suffering at some point. Does everything in a Nicholas Sparks drama have to be a tragedy?

All the same, there are select scenes between Tatum and Jenkins that are genuinely touching. One in particular, shown in the latter half of the film, requires both to not only be believable, but emotionally vulnerable as well. Regardless of the less than upbeat screenplay, they manage to pull it off. Jenkins in particular is persuasive, playing his role subtly and not as a mentally challenged stereotype. He is, quite simply, an isolated man who loves his son but doesn't know how to express it as others might. His financial situation is a mystery, and it's unclear as to how he could invest is so many valuable coins, but never mind; this is the kind of movie were matters of the heart outweigh matters of plot.

Credit also to Seyfried, whose youthful charm and graceful looks defy the weepy plot. Savanah comes across as someone you could actually care about, even after she finally sends him a new letter after months of no correspondence. It can't possibly be a secret that the title is a play on words.

The unfortunate flaw with movies like this is that every kiss, every fight, every term of endearment, and every shed tear is at the service of a hopelessly contrived plot. For me, this means that it will have little to no effect. I can't feel a certain way when a movie is telling me that I'm supposed to feel that way. The success of any filmmaker rests on his or her ability to manipulate you without letting you know you're being manipulated; director Lasse Hallstrm and writer Jamie Linden are so brazen in their efforts to make the audience cry that the end result seemed less like a movie and more like a psychological evaluation. Given the box office success of other Sparks adaptations - like ""A Walk to Remember,"" ""Nights in Rodanthe,"" and ""The Notebook"" - it's pretty clear that many will pass with flying colors.

I guess this means that I fail. While I certainly can't fault the actors for doing the best job they could possibly do, I just can't bring myself to feel anything for a film this cloying. ""Dear John"" is overwrought and sentimental, a film made for reasons no deeper than toying with our emotions. Had a more compelling story been told, had it bothered with an idea based in reality, I wouldn't have minded being toyed with. That is, after all, how some of the best movies work. Maybe Nicholas Sparks needs to rethink his approach to storytelling. Hopefully, that will put an end to the idea that young lovers should always be trapped in needlessly heartbreaking stories with overly solemn characters.",1265328000,23,4849,4.705535924617196
3832546,2,B0021L8V3Y,"I actually went into this film with low expectations and basically got what I expected, which is not much for a film that is being released in the middle of winter.

This film involves a romance between John and Savannah.  John is a soldier on leave in the US army  who meets a college student by the name of Savannah. During the course of a whirlwind courtship that takes over the time of two weeks morphs into a love that lasts a lifetime.

I found the plot for the most part predictable and many of the lines cheesy. Though despite this I still found myself drawn to the characters.  There was a scene towards the end of the film in which I was glad to see that the characters retained their integrity when they could have easily have done the opposite.

Obviously the film is aimed at teenage and twenty something girls. Which I am not, but I have a bit of a crush on Channing Tatum since he reminds me of a someone else I like. Channing Tatum is not a very good actor and each time I see him I am just convinced that he is playing himself. A big hunky lovable good old boy from the South.  But still I find him endearing for his humility and his ability to play a masculine character without the annoying `huff and puff' machismo that too many young Hollywood actors have.

Who surprised me the most was Amanda Seyfried, as Savanah who I have come to know mostly from her role on Veronica Mars. She had a lot of prescence and strength. I really think that she would have been well cast as the character Daenerys for the HBO series `A Game of Thrones'. She would have made a great Dany.

Anyway I would recommend this film to the fans of the two leads and romance novel afficianados.",1265328000,4,1687,4.279874213836478

3832755,4,B0021L8V3Y,"Dear John is a movie that isn't a simple, soldier on leave back in America meets hot girl, the two fall in love, he serves his country, they write letters to each other during his time in overseas combat, then get married, have kids and live happily ever after.  I'm glad it wasn't that.  That wouldn't be much of a movie.  But it did need more explanation for some actions, perhaps the book of the same name by Nicholas Sparks it is based on explains that better, but the movie doesn't.  Ultimately the contents of a letter (or well contents that weren't in it) are explained, but that explanation doesn't really make sense without the viewer being told more stuff.

Spoilers exist in explaining the above.  I didn't find it unrealistic that he eventually gets a letter telling him that the relationship was over.  The movie is titled Dear John, she was obviously not going to call him or break up with him in person the next time he's in America.  The two barely knew each other to begin with and has less than 24hrs when he came home on leave after that.  People break up who know each other a lot more than these two did.  But I did find it unrealistic that in cowardly method of breaking up, she doesn't mention the whole I'm going to be raising the autistic boy scenario and fact that she has to marry the neighbour to do this.  (It doesn't matter that she obviously didn't have to marry him, if she believed that, that's all that mattered, perhaps he told her that the only way to stop the boy's mother doing so was to marry him, wanting his own last couple of years with her, not caring that it is obviously a bit creepy since he would have known her since she was a little kid and been sort of like a dad to her).  This would have been a lot softer blow to the end of their relationship for John, rather than just saying she got engaged to someone else.  Which leaves him thinking she's been cheating on him for a while.  You don't really want someone angry as well as depressed when they need to be alert out on patrols, and have their own and others lives at stake.

We aren't told anything really about the autistic boy's mother to know why Savannah thought she needed to raise him instead of her.  Was she a junkie, alcoholic, violent towards him? Did she (maybe told by the father) believe his mother would just spend the boy's welfare checks, and leave him living in poverty with no interaction or something?  Being his ex, did the father have assets that the boy needed to inherit since he'll need care until he dies hopefully of old age, and he thought the mother would contest his wishes in the will and try and get control of those assets and spend the money, sell the house for money etc.  We the viewer really needed some sort of explanation on the mother.  Perhaps Spark's novel gives one, but the movie does not.

Did also Savannah have some reason she didn't want John to ultimately be in a relationship with her if she was raising the autistic boy, which would explain why she didn't mention the scenario in her letter, with it's a marriage on paper only, when you get back my husband will likely be dead or close to it, we can still see each other and get married a year or so after he dies.  Did she not like the way he interacted with his father who was more mildly autistic than the boy?  Did the angry beach tantrum where he shouts his father is not the r word, make her realise he wasn't suitable to be around the boy as a father figure?

Was Savannah after he turned up again just using John?  She only invites him in to talk after he mentions his father is dead.  Did she want to con him to sell the expensive coin collection (remember had gone over there when John wasn't home and asked him which ones were the most valuable, and knew the $4000 one wasn't the most economically value one, so there was at least $8000 in two coins alone there waiting for her.  Would she have broken into the dad's home if John had returned overseas without having sold them first?

It's a decent movie, Tatum and Seyfried do a decent job in their respective roles, and they do have chemistry on screen together for the first half of the movie to work.  But it just needed more explanation for the second half to be satisfying.",1512345600,,4243,4.336708860759494

3832912,5,B0021L8V3Y,"hello,
  this a great movie for the whole family.  this nicholas sparks movie is one that we skipped when it first came out, but after reading reviews, we watched it a couple of days ago.  most of those sparks movies and stories are a little sketchy.  the plot of this one looked like it was getting set up like most of the others, but the actors kept getting better in their roles.  the plot was very good in this one, but in the back of our minds, we thought is was going to be one of those very sad endings with out a clue.  but, you will like the outcome as it has questions that your mind can build up and say that is how it will end... Channing Tatum, Amanda Seyfried,  were excellent, but that ET character was hardly recognizable...Henry Thomas",1491609600,2,752,4.246478873239437

3832975,4,B0021L8V3Y,"This is a good movie, definitely a ""chick flick"" in the traditional sense of the phrase.  Love the character development (though I would have liked to see Savannah's husband and his son developed a little more deeply -- let us get to know them a bit better) and story line.  The reason I can't give it 5/5 stars is because of the abrupt ending.  I thought the plot line dragged along during the first and second 2/3 of the movie, but the last 1/3 went by crazy fast!  All the sudden the movie is ending and I felt like I was just getting settled in.

However, Channing Tatum and his leading lady do not disappoint.... including Channing's handsome looks!  Channing's level of eye-candy and performance, as well as the performance of his leading lady both get 5/5 stars.  The only drawback to this movie is the relatively abrupt ending.  Would recommend!",1482883200,,853,4.602649006622516

Nicholas Sparks seems adept at reminding those of us so far past this point in our lives how exciting, and sometimes heartbreaking, it was to be in love at that age.

A bittersweet romantic drama about the realities of war, a long distance romance, a father and son who did not know how to communicate with each other, and a love that survived two major obstacles: war and a betrayal which ultimately turned in to an act of love and self-sacrifice. I would have liked to have seen a little more about their reconnection at the end of the movie, but was pleased that they did reconnect.

John and Savannah want to stay together and decide to keep in touch by writing each other letters. They are optimistic about the future but not everything went exactly as they planned

You should not expect a war or action film. Dear John is a beautiful heart touching love story and there is a risk that you will feel as if you were on an emotional roller coaster.

To sum it up, Its a great romantic womens film but not too kitschy.",1432512000,,718,4.350746268656716

I did not like Savannah and wondered how she could love John and then decide she couldn't wait on him.  The best part of the film was John's relationship with his father and the unspoken love between them.  Their relationship was the real love story.  I hoped in the end that John didn't take Savannah back, as she had already betrayed him once and felt he deserved better.

I don't want to spoint anything.  But Channing Tatum was great and so was his co star.  I wish some parts turned out the way I wanted but I didn't write it and it wound up being great overall.  I cried through this film constantly, so break out the tissues.  I highly recommend it if  your looking for a good drama love story, I will say a few and just a few points I thought the acting could have been a little better so maybe this is only worth four stars but I enjoyed it thouroughly so five it got.  I got my copy from my local library with their seven day free rentals so check it out or buy it.  Either way love will find a way.",1423526400,,784,4.012903225806451

3835875,4,B0021L8V3Y,"In the interview with director, Lasse Halstom, he says that he likes to walk the fine line between real sentiment and sentimentality.  I agree that he succeeded in this film.  The story is perhaps a little over-the-top in terms of sentimentality but the expert direction and fine acting by all the cast kept this real and engaging.  The cast was well chosen.  Amanda Seyfried and Channing Tatum are both certainly easy to look at and they deliver first class performances.  Richard Jenkins was amazing---really grabbed your heart from the first scene to his final appearance.

The one problem I had with the film was that Savannah's choice didn't seem credible, given the strong character that she appears to have, as played by Seyfried.  I don't know how this was handled in the novel.  The only justification I can see for her decision was her own weakness...a need to be needed which caused her to betray her feelings of love for John.  Perhaps if she had been shown to be more vulnerable in the beginning, her later action would have been more believable.  I think this is the fault of the director who may have been carried away with Seyfried's beauty and personality....who can blame him?",1411948800,,1194,4.780487804878049
3835876,5,B0021L8V3Y,Channing is awesome in this movie!  Much better then I thought it would be.

Over the next few years I read it a total of five times, mainly seeking a different ending, but, of course, there isn't one. ""Frankly, I don't give a damn"" will always be that last retort. However, a different ending does occur in ""Dear John"" and I watch the movie just to see it again and again.

Besides, the beautiful Channing Tatum and the gorgeous Amanda Seigfried make up the good-looking couple who bond almost immediately in the story. The way he touches her, the way she looks at him just seem so real (or I want it to be real). Tenderness, gentility, thoughtfulness braid through the story, revealing through both their characters.

In three weeks the ""summer romance"" ends: she goes back to college, he returns to duty in the Middle East. Before they part, they decide to write of their lives in their letters, to continue to develop on paper what they cannot in flesh. Their words of choice in parting: ""See you soon then?""

It's not an easy romance. One thing after the other interrupts this distance relationship, all good reasons, all understandable. Yet, still, everything is on hold. How long can such a love last? Additionally, John's father is autistic; Savannah's longtime neighbor male friend also has an autistic son. All play roles in this love story.

Tears, tears, tears--after all, this is a Nicholas Sparks story. However, let me declare now, neither of the main characters dies. When the ending comes, it comes quietly, gently, and so understated. Perfect!  It's not a perfect love story, but it is most assuredly a worthy one!",1402790400,3,1730,4.659016393442623

Channing Tatum is a great actor and he's sexy as well, so if for no other reason, this movie was worth the purchase. But beyond that, Nicholas Sparks stories are phenomenal. It's a very sweet story, and I think you will enjoy it. His movies and books are always real. He doesn't give you shiny love stories wrapped up in a bow. He gives you real life, with love, tragedy, and everything in between. This movie is no different and it's definitely one worth picking up.",1388448000,,557,4.314285714285714

Keeping that in mind, the movie came and the packaging was pristine, the DVD was in it and free of scratches so in my eyes that is exactly what I ordered and deserves 5 stars.

If you are considering buying the movie however:
Many times during the movie I found myself thinking ""give me a break..."" in regards to some of the ""action"" scenes and other macho crap they tried to fit in. It's a love story.

3837474,3,B0021L8V3Y,"I had pretty high hopes for this movie, since I watched and loved The Notebook. It started it out pretty well, and I thought the movie would continue to do so. However, toward the ending, I really was not impressed. The whole conflict between John and Savannah is one Nicholas Sparks failed to research in the slightest before publicizing on such a grand scale. SPOILER ALERT... The supposed reason that Savannah abandons John while he is fighting for his country is that Alan, the boy with autism, will need support after his father dies. All that needed to be done was for Alan's father to assign Savannah as legal guardian to Alan and fill out the legal documents so that she will be able to care for him. Instead, Savannah uses the opportunity to start a romantic relationship with Alan's dad and proceed to marry him (which still does not make Alan her legal son - she would have to adopt him). So, overall, Savannah uses the situation as an excuse to leave John, and start a new romantic relationship, which would not have been at all necessary. That part really upset me. At the very end, John and Savannah make up, but it is such a dull ending that it does not make up for the ill-researched climactic conflict - which is a huge part of the story. It was still, overall, an entertaining movie with some touching moments. It's just hard to feel compassion for Savannah when she leaves a soldier while he is at war for a bogus reason (meaning that she didn't have to abandon John in order to support Alan and his dad). I'm a little disappointed.",1344211200,2,1551,4.50354609929078

3837517,5,B0021L8V3Y,"It has been a long time since I have been really touched by a story, but I was touched by this one.  Savannah and John meet while he is on leave and have 2 weeks to spend together.  They fall in love and begin corresponding with plans to get married after his tour is up in 1 year.  September 11th occurs and he extends his tour for another 2 years.  During this time, he gets a letter from Savannah saying she has found someone else and is engaged.  Following the death of his father, he goes to find her and confront her about why she didn't wait for him.  Her husband, Tim, is dying with cancer and she tells John she felt an obligation to help Tim when he got sick, along with his autistic son.  John sees that she still loves him, but also loves Tim.  After seeing Savannah and saying goodbye to her, John sells his father's coin collection and makes an anonymous donation to Tim's healthcare fund.  Tim spends a few months at home before dying.  It is heart wrenching watching John and Savannah say goodbye to each other!  The movie ends with a glimmer of hope for John and Savannah after they run into each other some time later.

Although many elements of the movie line up with the book, there are several main plot differences.  Tim is close to Savannah's age and has an autistic brother whereas in the movie Tim is an older, married man whose wife has left him with their autistic son.  At the end of the story, Tim is in remission and Savannah is still with him whereas in the movie, Tim dies and Savannah and John run into each other with hope that they may rekindle their relationship.

3837520,4,B0021L8V3Y,"Read the book and watched the movie on the same day.  The book was very dramatic and you could feel the emotion just seeping from John and Savannah.  I just couldn't put it down, and while I am sometimes mad at Sparks for not always giving me a happy ending, I understand in life we don't always get happy endings.  IF I was reviewing the book, I would tell the author to mix it up a little because I feel like I already know what he will write in most of his next novel.  Someone always dies, there's always heartbreak, and almost never a happy ending.  When it comes to the movie (and most of the movies based on Sparks' books)  there are too many changes.  While I am happy the ending is changed in the [Dear John] movie (I couldn't take that much heartbreak in one day), I can never focus on the movie without focusing on the changes and how little sense they make to me.  I don't understand why after a successful novel Sparks allows so many storyline changes. I understand they don't want the story to be boring for the people that read the book, but we want it to be at least remotely similar.  For the longest time I thought Savannah married Randy but I guess so did John... In the movie version, John's sacrifice made no sense since Tim died anyway, and the movie made no reference to the scene [in the book] where Tim asks John to treat Savannah well if he dies since he knew they would be together anyway if that happens.  If this was mentioned the ending would have more meaning because Tim basically gave John permission to be with his wife and John tried to save him anyway, even after he stole his girl.  It would also help to mention that both Tim and Savannah considered the latter naive, and that could be the reason she left John to help Tim.  Did I believe she could leave John to help Tim? Was the relationship between Tim and Savannah fully explained?  Did I believe she could ever fall in love with him? Nah. Worst choice of actor ever!  As to the acting, I like Tatum, Seyfried is gorgeous but together they had no sparks or the movie was just too segmented, and couldn't convey the characters emotion with that little time for each scene.  The real love, passion and heartbreak couldn't be felt and that was what ultimately led me to take one star away.  Still a good portrayal of the book, but not an A+",1342224000,,2329,4.307339449541284

The highlight and probably one of my favorite scenes in any film recently, is the wrenching hospital scene where Channing Tatum reads a letter to his dying father. Words that you will have heard already, and made much more profound than you once thought. Channing Tatum is not a great actor, but he nailed this scene.

They're short, sweet, and uncomplicated which helps pass the time when there's nothing to do and I'm too lazy to go out.  As of this writting, I've started The Lucky One. And I do look forward to seeing the movies made based off his work. Unfortunately, Dear John isn't one of his best efforts.

While on leave in his home town, John meets Savanah and the two hit it off pretty fast. Unfortunately for this pair of star-crossed lovers, 9/11 happens and John volunteers to go back to his military duties indefinitely which puts a huge damper on their relationship. So the pair try to remain true to one another by writting sappy, syruppy love letters. But over time the vast distance and not knowing when, or if, John will return begin to wear them down and soon Savanah's letters arrive less and less frequently until one day he receives the title letter which everyone knows is a breakup letter.

I'm not 100% sure why I didn't like this movie. Maybe I just really didn't give it a chance but I just could not focus my attention on the movie. I love Amanda Seyfried but she seems so lost and out of place here. Channing Tatum is completely miscast here as John. He comes off wooden and mumbles his lines so much that I had to turn on the subtitles just to understand what he was saying. Richard Jenkins is wasted here as well and Henry Thomas was the wrong choice to play the part of the man who comes in between. And what the hell kind of ending was that? To do what he does and all for what? That she'll sit and talk with him again? Skip this one entirely.",1334448000,3,1665,4.296178343949045

This is a story about what might happen if two people understood how to be kind and not simply let hot hormones drive their actions.  Very interesting examination of relationships with John's father, and with young Alan -- more than tolerance.

3837594,5,B0021L8V3Y,"I found this movie very inspirational. Now I have to read the book and compare the two. There is always deviation from the novel in a movie, but since I saw the movie first I have to admit I thoroughly enjoyed it. Probably because I didn't have the book to compare the movie too. Plus, there is just something special and very romantic about relationships that begin on the beach. Maybe because my sister lives on the beach in NC it brings me a lot of nostalgia (and because I love visiting her at the beach where the scenery is very much the same as on the movie set.)

What I loved most about this story was how the issue of separation during times of war was portrayed, how it showed the dedication of soldiers to their country, and how it illustrated the pain that came from their separation and always wondering if things would change while he was overseas. I loved the autism theme as well and how the movie showed how his father had some tendencies along the autism spectrum and the challenges that came with having a father with quirks like his dad had. I thought the movie portrayed autism well, especially when it came to the boy in the story. I also love movies and stories that deal with sacrifice, and in this movie the heroine made some sacrifices to help someone else because she loved his son. The hero John had no idea who that someone was until he returned home. Then John did something amazing and beautiful, and in the end, it was a blessing to them all. I totally loved this story. Channing did a great job with emotion and got me crying more than once. His emotions were well portrayed. Amanda Seyfried did a great job, too, though I think Channing's acting is what made the movie shine. I felt like crying with them. John was the ultimate hero. Nicholas Sparks does a great job creating heroic men for his novels. Loved this movie more than most. I think I'll watch it again and again. :)",1326585600,,1911,4.398305084745763

Hallstrom, ever the innovative and insightful director, provides a vehicle for stardom to Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried. Tatum, in particular, accepts the invitation with his stellar performance. Yes, he looks good with or without clothes but his mastery as an actor provides the emotionally-rich glue for the storyline. In a way rarely experienced in film today, you can viscerally feel what he feels (love, loss, pain, ...) whether he utters words or not. For her part, Seyfried even contributes to the score when she sweetly sings and strums in one scene.

With its intimately composed shots, well-matched soundtrack (highlighted with the hauntingly beautiful and appropriate juxtaposition to the love scene), and storyline highlighting the enduring strength of love over loss, ""Dear John"" is a great addition to the romantic film genre.",1324080000,,1099,5.310344827586207
3837648,4,B0021L8V3Y,"I judge movies based on character driven or plot driven styles of presentation.  This was definitely character driven.  When after watching a movie I later think about the people and their issues, I give it high marks.  Most of the time after watching modern movies, I never give them another thought except, 'glad it was over'. This one got me thinking about John having to make a very painful decision to stay with his Special Forces team in order to defend the country against terror.  Savannah's character was developed as a philanthropist who felt the need to be close to her best child-hood friend who was critically ill.  (Florence Nightingale effect) I began thinking about Casablanca and Rick's famous quote, ""the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.""  He had to let go of his love interest as well.  So, Nicholas Sparks explores these issues without being preachy and forces one to internalize them.  You won't come away with a ray of sunshine but with a deeper understanding of how people can let go of something very precious in their lives for a greater good.
As for the acting; I felt that both Channing and Amanda gave very honest performances. Most scenes were performed with diverse facial expressions rather than wordy retorts.  I was amazed at Channing's range.  The Barn scene especially was overwhelming to me when he told Amanda that his father had passed in such a way that it really shook me. Amanda rarely repeated a gesture or expression throughout the movie.  You saw a different side of her in every scene.  For as young as she is, she understands humanity to a degree very few people learn in a lifetime.
Debra Lurie did a wonderful job on the music.  The melody was appropriate to the story and her use of dynamics during emotional scenes lifted the moment to a proper degree.  My favorite musical moment was when John said 'goodbye' instead, 'see you again soon?'  Debra used a classical guitar to set up the scene, and then blended in a full orchestra at the most poignant moment. It was emotionally overwhelming to me.
I concluded that quite a bit of thought went into these little subtleties and to me it made a big difference in how the movie came across.  I don't know about you but I am pretty weary of CGI.  Its good to see something which centers on the people in the story.",1320969600,4,2361,4.623501199040767

I do think this movie had a cute couple and some good acting, but if it wasn't for the way that they took care of people with disabilities, I wouldn't have sensed any chemistry between John and Savannah. Physically, they looked like a good couple, but the conversations they had didn't convince me that they were truly in love.

It was still a pretty good movie, certainly one that I was glad to watch once. I felt really bad for John's father, and even though they were all fictional characters, I had a great deal of respect for him as he fought for his country and took care of a parent with special needs. It's true that sometimes he was annoyed by his dad's unhealthy obsession, but that made him seem more like a realistic character.

Knowing that they have to go back to their life in two weeks, they fall in love with each other. But John and Savannah maintain their relationship through letters, and John will soon leave the army so that they can live together, but things turn out not the way they planned.

""Dear John"" is based on a 2006 book written by Nicholas Sparks, original author of such romantic dramas as ""Message in a Bottle,"" ""A Walk to Remember,"" ""Nights in Rodanthe"" and yes, ""The Notebook,"" but the film somehow lacks the emotional charge of the Ryan Gosling / Rachel McAdams romance. It seems director Lasse Hallstrm, known for ""My Life as a Dog"" and ""The Cider House Rules"" is trying too hard to make everything so sweet or so bitter, without allowing us to know the central characters John, John's father, Savannah and her neighbor Tim (Henry Thomas).

In ""Dear John,"" most characters are nice (like in any Nicholas Sparks adaptations), but their motives for takings action are not always convincing. To explain the decision made (one that is hard to do), one character says, ""I had no choice."" Sorry, but I just don't believe it. The consequences may be heartbreaking, but they are contrived. The final act is rushed, as if several key scenes are deleted. The subplot about John's quiet father (Richard Jenkins) and his childhood memories don't add up to much.

Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried are doing their best, injecting some much-needed passion into the characters they play, but under Hallstrm vapid direction, they have no chance. ""Dear John"" is an unabashed tearjerker (and that is not a bad thing), that needs a better storyteller.",1317600000,,1791,4.884868421052632

The story is similar, some of the characters and places are different - typical when a book is being adapted for the screen. The movie is well cast. As John, Channing Tatum is simply eye candy for the ladies, and brings honesty and heart to the tough guy with a vulnerable side. For an actor who's fairly new to the business, Tatum holds his own very well and brings significant intensity and sadness to the emotionally-charged scenes with his Dad and Savannah. Amanda Seyfried is engaging as Savannah - everything she feels is right there on her face, very natural and sincere. Tatum and Seyfried have natural, comfortable screen chemistry. That aspect of this movie completely works and I found it very refreshing to see two people falling in love without frantic kissing and lovemaking scenes. When those scenes did appear, they were filmed tastefully and romantically - for a nice change. And Richard Jenkins is masterful, as usual, as John's misunderstood autistic Dad. Sparks's story is about people sharing a moment in time and bringing something to each other's lives - for a reason. The movie is about the bumpy road to love, and how enduring love can overcome those pitfalls. SPOILER ALERT: Two different endings. Perhaps the book's ending is a bit more realistic, but I'm all for the ""Hollywood Ending"" and the possibility of John and Savannah finally ending up together years later.

3837712,2,B0021L8V3Y,"Overall, this was a great idea for a movie, sadly it failed miserably for me.
I understand the movie, is based on a book (written by the guy who wrote ""The Notebook"" which was made into a movie, which I have not read. I would be curious to read it now though, and see how it compares to the movie.
So, the overall gist of the movie, is that it is a love story, with a twist of one lover being a soldier in the U.S. Military who ends up being deployed right after the infancy of the relationship, leaving the young girl pining away in college,  they began a letter compaign, to help keep the relationship going, and to share about each other (since they hadn't had much time to spend together before he was shipped out).
I will first discuss the story issues, and then tackle the military issues.
The story was poor on screen, at best.  It did not have the depth needed for a true love story, nor did the characters, which has me looking squarely at the script writer (since I haven't read the book I can't speak to the author).  Take a look at any of the major love stories, and they all had GREAT stories and characters that drew you in, compelled you to watch such a moving relationship.  This one, did not.  It hinted at it, but fell flat, which is really unforunate because it was such a great idea, unique too for a story.
I found John's relationship with his Dad, rather distracting.
The best scene, out the whole movie, for me, was not between the two lovers, it was in the hospital hallway with John and his Dad.  If they could have brought that emotion to the rest of the story, and the shots, it would have been phenomenal. The story was confusing, especially the end, of them at the coffee shop.  Poor job at an ending.
They started numbering the letters they sent each other, and then they stopped. The story was jerky at best.
I found the character of John lacking, seriously, in depth and development. He should have been so alluring and interesting, like a layered onion, whose layers were slowly peeled back to reveal more engaging and enticing character and personality to the audience.  That would have had women swooing!
I did not mind Amanda being cast, but I am not a fan of Tatum, and had a better character been created, I believe a better actor should have been cast.
The directing was very unique and edgy at times, and then it fell plain flat, which I found distracting as well.
Now to the military issues.  I don't know who the ""Military Advisors"" were, or how much influence they really had, but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't hire them. I don't know why it is so hard for Hollywood to get simple things like a uniform correct.  I have been around a few soldiers, and men in U.S. Army Special Forces, and happened to watch this movie with one, and well, this movie did a horrendous job at accuracy and portrayal of such an elite group of heroes.  They are such an interesting group of men, with such diverse and intriguing personalities with their vast unusual experience.  It's a shame, and a disservice the movie failed horribly at capturing and telling any part of that story.
First, just because you're a soldier, or in Special Forces, doesn't mean you walk around like a brooding anger ball.  There is no ""standard"" demeanor for a soldier.  In fact, if you met them at a BBQ, you wouldn't be tipped off as to who they were.  And yeah, they also don't walk around with identifying rings and t-shirts on, or bumper stickers, for that matter.  The alleged Special Forces ring John was wearing, wasn't even an SF ring (and it should be noted just because you wear a ring or t-shirt or even profess to be Special Forces or anything else, doesn't mean you are, lots of people lie about being something they aren't for their own personal gain. When in doubt, you can check them out through local Veteran Organizations or for U.S. Army Special Forces, the local SF Chapter).  The uniform, well he has his rank upside down, and in the next shot it was correct.  When they're deployed, they don't walk around in identifing t-shirts.  Hello!  They also tend not to shave, as to blend in with the locals.  I have never seen such clean shaven men, and clean uniforms, on deployed men out in nowhereland.  It's almost as if, they walked into the Hollywood Back Lot, isn't it?

3837714,2,B0021L8V3Y,"I read the book after I watched the film and only because some reviews suggested it was so much better. I was really surprised to read that in those reviews because, typically, I expect it to be the other way around with Nicholas Sparks. For me, Notebook was a classic example of where the book was extremely corny and badly written but Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling really made it sweet. They had onscreen chemistry and you could skip all the drivel that filled endless pages.

This film is far from great but Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried have a lot of chemistry to make their love believable, so I didn't really know what to expect from the book. Now I've read it. I have to say that I do think that it is as predictable and as corny as I would expect from Mr Sparks. However, there is more depth to John's character than ever came through in the film. Partly, because the book is a first person narrative, so it feels like you can get inside his head or, I suppose, he lets you inside his heart. Partly, because there are so many more details that were important to the story but completely omitted in the film! I can only blame poor screenwriting for this and don't really understand how one can miss everything that is crucial to this story despite making the film last for 1 hour 42 minutes?

The film could have been really nice and romantic. Maybe not the best film but, certainly, one of the better ones. It could have made a perfect date film, a perfect chick flick... whatever you want to call it. Instead, it just turned out to be an extremely boring drawn out non-story that was only held together by the pure fact that Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried played their chemistry so well.

I still can't get over the fact that people who made this film couldn't even muster a decent soundtrack for this story. Of all the songs they could have... Absolutely amazing. Two stars only for the fact that Channing Tatum is so gorgeous in this film. If you are his fan, you won't be disappointed as he is as charming as can be.

3837730,4,B0021L8V3Y,"I've been pretty clear in the past about my feelings towards Nicolas Sparks and his ridiculous amount of recognition today.  Seriously, the man writes the same story over and over and yet he sells like hot cakes and multiple movies a year carry his stamp of recognition (there have been like five films adapted from his novels in the past two years).

All that said, I have been known to enjoy his work on occasion and there are a handful of films adapted from his work that works on their own levels.  Sparks has trouble depicting certain aspects of love for which he is not too familiar, but when he strikes a nerve it actually delivers.

We all know what to expect with a Sparks creation; love will be tumultuous and someone is going to die.

`Dear John' is one of the better adaptations and certainly the best since `The Notebook' (I still firmly hold fast to the belief that `A Walk to Remember' is the best Sparks' adaptation to date).  Thankfully Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried sell these characters with such passion and promise that you believe them 100%, despite the fact that their relationship is touch and go at times.  There are aspects of the film that seem forced and manipulative, and some areas that just don't work at all, but in the end these two actors serve as the glue that holds it all together, allowing us to engage the idea that this is real.

John Tyree meets Savanna Curtis by chance.  He rescues her purse from drowning.  Immediately they hit it off.  The only hitch is that John is still serving his tour in the Armed Forces and Savannah has to go back to school.  At the end of their two weeks together the two decide the wait for one another, knowing that at the end of a year they will be together forever.  Then, 9/11 happens and their whole world (and everyone else's) gets turned upside down.  When John, feeling the peer pressure to serve his country better, decides to extend his tour, things get complicated.

So here's the deal.  The chemistry between the two leads was evident from the first moment they lay eyes on each other, and it never goes away.  That is a major plus to the film.  The films many little subplots don't fare as well.  The autistic core theme is used a little sparingly, although it added some nice layers to John's relationship with his father (although the fight he had with Savannah about it made about as much sense as societies obsession with Nicolas Sparks).  The relationship with Tim is forced and uncomfortable at times (especially the way it pans out, which was kind of lame) and the way that Sparks worked the eventualities of John and Savannah just seemed so predictably unbelievable.  I think the one big issue here, and I find this with a lot of Sparks' creations, is that it falls in the present time (or this decade) and so it suffers from Sparks' strange romantic ideals.  The subplot between Savannah and Tim would have worked if, say, it happened in the same era as the events of `The Notebook', but it takes place in 2002 and that just doesn't make sense at all.  I don't want to get into what happened, but when you hear her reasoning you'll understand why it was so unnecessary.

I will say this; the dynamic created between John and his father, especially with the tie in to the films opening `letter', was brilliantly played.  It just melted your heart and hit you in all the right places.  I'm actually getting a little teary eyed writing about it now.  I only wish that the films emotional impact at that moment wasn't marred by the way it diverted to focusing on John and Savannah, since the elements it capture with John and his father meant a whole lot more.

The direction is sharp and the cinematography was especially beautiful to watch (the way these characters and the scenery is bathed was captivating) and so all in all it is a worthwhile `night at the movies'.  It suffers from most things that Sparks' films suffer from, but it has enough going for it to make it `above average'.

My B- rating seems a tad high to me, and yet the entertainment value here caused me to shy away from a C+.",1297641600,,4092,4.505420054200542
3837731,3,B0021L8V3Y,"Re: reviewers' comments about John's lack of emotion: It's not fair to blame an army guy (Special Forces, no less) for not showing emotion. I know VietNam veterans - Channing's portrayal was perfect...quiet, stonefaced, reserved.
Savannah's idea of commitment is ""I will love you forever, or until I change my mind.""
""I had no choice"" is truly the American mantra - the ultimate, mindless excuse for breaking any promise or committing any act. ""I had no choice"" is a trite cliche.
John understood honor and commitment. We thought she did - until the going got a little tough. This writer led us love Savannah, along with John, and then changed her essential character! Lazy writing! Let's send boxes of dog poop to the writer.

I can think of a dozen endings that would have been realistic AND satisfying for the audience. This was not an existential film - it could have had a happy ending! I wanted to shout at the screen ""It doesn't have to end this way!""",1295308800,,958,4.668639053254438
3837732,3,B0021L8V3Y,"A few days after I finished reading Dear John I rented the movie with a free movie credit from Amazon.  The movie was okay, but as usual the book was better.  I did enjoy the movie because I enjoy a good love story and I did cry at some points, but it lacked any real ""spark.""

First of all, if you read the book you'll find that the movie is way different.  The general gist of the story is the same, but many of the details, character stories, etc. are totally different.  The ending is also completely different than the ending of the book, although I think the movie ended the way I would have preferred the book to end.

Also, the acting was pretty terrible.  I generally like Amanda Seyfried and I've seen her do better, and Channing Tatum couldn't seem to get the southern accent down very well...half the time it sounded like weird British accent.  The acting just didn't really flow, and the storyline was way too choppy.  The movie seemed to rush through the events in the beginning of the story, which I felt was the most important and enjoyable part of the book.

Did I hate the movie? No, and if you haven't seen it yet it's worth renting for the night.  But I personally wouldn't spend the money to purchase the DVD.",1294185600,2,1230,4.350877192982456

Effectively done, but no new ground is being broken here.",1294185600,2,384,4.661764705882353
3837734,5,B0021L8V3Y,"The subject line just about sums up this surprisingly fantastic love story.  It's beautiful, simple, easy to follow, and INCREDIBLY powerful and touching.  It's about a young man and young girl who find true love by total coincidence on one sunny day at the beach, and upon finding out that the man has to return to the army and serve his country, the girl becomes distraught and confused.  However, through the amazing power of writing emotional letters to each other, the two continue a relationship across the seas.

The actor playing as the father was probably my personal favorite person in the film.  He never revealed too much about himself and left you wondering what he was really thinking in the inside.  What did he think about his sons girlfriend?  What did he think about his son going to the army?  These are questions I kept wondering.  His hobby and fascination with collecting coins brought back childhood memories for me as well.  I wish *I* had that half-nickel, half-penny coin!!!  That was a thing of beauty!  Oh, and anyone who makes lasagna once a week HAS to be downright awesome!

The actress playing the girlfriend was really pretty, and I'm willing to bet over 90% of the men out there would consider her the perfect girlfriend.  She DID come across as an all-around perfect, likable person.  Really attractive too, and a great personality.

There's nothing even remotely confusing or hard to understand about Dear John, and it's not supposed to be.  This is a story about wondering whether love can stand the test of time and patience.  What will happen by the conclusion?  Watch and find out!",1293926400,2,1621,4.787003610108303
3837784,3,B0021L8V3Y,"The creators of Dear John have perfected the art of pleasing giddy high school girls and sappy romantics alike. While Channing Tatum as John Tyree provides eye candy and giggle material, Amanda Seyfried as Savannah Curtis plays the perfect soulful `good girl.' These two, juxtaposed by fate, only to be torn apart just as quickly, conform perfectly to the rules of sappy romantic-comedy with a tragic hint.

 Of course the viewers figure this out only after the first fifteen minutes of the film. The introduction seems to be the writers failed attempt to take an almost 400 page Nicholas Sparks novel and adapt it into a film of less than 2 hours. Perhaps breezing through the beginnings of John and Savanna's relationship would not hinder the audience's connection to the two characters or their situation, right? Wrong. The first fifteen minutes are more like a ninth grade English class discussion on the various aspects of dramatic literature (Please label: Exposition, Character Development, Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action, Resolution) than critically acclaimed film material. I'd like to see the stats on how many people walked out of the movie theatre before the good stuff even started.

Fortunately for this film review, I was determined. The writers must have had enough coffee after 30 minutes or so and things improve tenfold. New characters, relationships and challenges are thrown into the mix, making Dear John more like your average teen flick. Although the introduction of the motherless autistic child and his ever caring father seems like a cheap emotional trick meant to bring forth the audience's tears, it works.

 The turning point comes when the two leads go their separate ways. Now with John in some obscure location (I could tell you where but then...) and Savannah off at college things begin to speed up. Of course we still haven't had our full dose of blatant manipulation, so director Lasse Hallstrom kindly stepped in with the montage to music and thoughtful pining shots. Could it be that Dear John is too obviously begging to be called ""chick flick""? Certainly all of the sympathetic, or just pathetic, characters are meant to tug at the heartstrings of vulnerable viewers, but does it work? The emotional climax, a surprisingly touching moment where we learn who the letter from the first scene is really addressed to, just might cause some mist to form in the eyes of viewers. But just mist.

Next of course is the necessary reunion of the two former lovers, where our heroine welcomes home the long forgotten soldier in the typical, uncomfortable, awkward-pause filled scene. A few shocking surprises and unexpected plot twists later we reach the ending. This, somewhat like a college hookup, leaves us as unsatisfied as the beginning. Although at least we had some good times in between. Perhaps the creators of Dear John thought things best left to our imaginations? After all, how could anything compare with the tear-jerking, feel good movie of the year gold that had preceeded it? That's something that viewers and critics alike will never know. As are the reason for choosing to leave things so unfinished.

If the purpose of this film was to become a staple of the pre-teen movie genre, the creators succeeded brilliantly. Although Dear John pales in comparison to such classics in its field as The Notebook (another Sparks film adaptation), or Titanic, it conforms to the standards of late night necessity. With average leads, an average plot line, and average, though not unsuccessful direction, Dear John gets an A for average.  A good film for a girls night, or if you're planning to dump your boyfriend and you want to give him heads up.

3837792,3,B0021L8V3Y,"I just finished watching one of the latest Nicholas Sparks inspired movies, Dear John (2010). Directed by Lasse Hallstrm and starring Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried, this romantic drama is a mixed bag cinematically (3 stars out of 5). It's not a bad movie, but it's not great either. It's a good flick to watch and be reminded of the better movies that inspired it. I think it was miscast with Tatum in the lead male role. His character John is a sensitive-romantic ""nice guy"", but also a hardened patriotic soldier. I just didn't buy Tatum in this role. He acted the part well...but that's the problem, it felt like he acted the part instead of being the part. Seyfried is believable in her role as the love-torn Savannah who falls in love with John in just two weeks after meeting him. But I didn't really feel the chemistry between her and Tatum. Again...I think she had the chemistry with the character of John, but not Tatum. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not just bagging on Channing Tatum, because I do think he is a talented actor, just not meant for this role. Tatum is great in Stop-Loss (2008), another current movie about young soldiers back at home in America.

Dear John was gorgeously shot in South Carolina by Director of Photography Terry Stacey. The lighting in most scenes is soft, sunny and southern. I especially love the scenes of John surfing in the Atlantic Ocean. The production design by Kara Lindstrom feels perfect and right in line with the story, as well as with Nicholas Sparks' other movies. A wonderful surprise are the supporting roles played by actors Richard Jenkins and Henry Thomas. Jenkins plays John's father, a man with Asperger's Syndrome, with perfect sullen monotony. And Thomas plays the father of an autistic child and friend of Savannah. Without these two roles, this movie would have really fallen flat. They lift the movie above being a Lifetime Special-of-the-Week movie, adding some depth and complexity to an otherwise simple love story. Dear John is not at the level of The Notebook (2004) or Nights in Rodanthe (2008), but it's worth watching on a Saturday night, curled up on the sofa with a glass of wine.",1289606400,,2163,4.737400530503979
3837793,5,B0021L8V3Y,"I must say, the movie version is way better than the book. I mean, Sparks' version is more elaborate and some of the relationships had deeper thoughts in them. However, let us keep in mind that a movie is a movie; there's a limited time for a movie. Having said them, I found the chemistry between Savannah and John to be brilliant on screen. In the book, I questioned Savannah's love for John a few times. This is probably why the different endings matched each presentation (movie and book). I understand the nature of the title, ""Dear John"", is supposed to be a break up letter, but let's not over generalize the situation.

There is hope in the movie and that's what movie viewers need. We've all seen the tragic events, and it isn't just a happily ever after that viewers long for, but don't they (John and Savannah) deserve it? How can anyone cheat on John like that? He's got this responsibility in him that makes him really remarkable. I haven't been an army's wife, but my boyfriend is always away from home because of work. I find that the distance really draws us back together. It's a lovely thing.

I read the book first, so naturally I really didn't like the way they did this movie. I read a few of the other reviews and I think people were way too generous. I am writing this after finishing with the other Sparks flick ""The Last Song"". THAT was fantastic.
In my opinion these two movies don't compare. The Last song was amazing and I don't like Miley Cyrus, so that's saying alot.
This film was sooooooooo slow. It's like Amanda and this guy didn't have any chemistry whatsoever and it showed.
What I did like? Tim DOES die at the end (sorry Tim) and there's hope for the two of them afterall. In the book, They don't give you that hope. In the book, you're annoyed. Lol At least in this movie, he's very nice and he's very likeable.
We all know she should have waited for him to return from war and she should have understood about 9-11, but hey, that's what happened and that's how he wrote the story. I'm glad the screenplay was changed just a wee bit for the audience to feel better about the ending.

3838005,4,B0021L8V3Y,"When it comes to films that are adapted from Nicholas Sparks novels, you know you can expect romance, conflict and for the most part, for those who enjoy romantic films, films that can usually be seen as uplifting and remembered.

From Sparks novels such as ""Message in a Bottle"", ""A Walk to Remember"", ""The Notebook"" and ""Nights in Rodanthe"", ""Dear John"" is the latest novel to receive an adaptation.  With a screenplay by Jamie Linden (""We Are Marshall""), the film would be directed by Lasse Hallstrom (""Hachiko: A Dog's Story"", ""Chocolat"", ""The Cider House Rules"", ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"").  The film would feature cinematography by Terry Stacey (""P.S. I Love You"", ""Adventureland"") and music composed by Debora Lurie (""Dreamgirls"", ""Spider-Man 3"", ""Wanted"", ""X-men 2"").

Although the film was not well-received by critics, films based on Nicholas Sparks novels have proven to become quite successful and was the film responsible of knocking ""Avatar"" out of the #1 box office position (note: Avatar was #1 for seven weeks) and ""Dear John"" which was budgeted at $25 million would earn over $94 million in the box office.

VIDEO:

""Dear John"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1) and because the film is shot outdoors for many of the scenes, the colors are absolutely vibrant.  Amazing detail when it comes to the film's textures, backgrounds, ocean water to skin pores are quite detailed in HD.  Flesh tones are natural, blacks are nice and deep, a fine layer of grain but ""Dear John"" is a very vibrant film full of colors and for the most part, looks great on Blu-ray.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Dear John"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and in English - Audio Description Track 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Although the film is a romantic film (and one shouldn't expect anything major in terms of surround channel or LFE usage). There is probably one or two major action scenes in which John and his fellow soldiers looking for insurgents, but for the most part, dialogue is clear and understandable and the music presented in the film sounds great via lossless.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Dear John"" is a touching, heartwarming and enjoyable romantic film.  The chemistry of Amanda Seyfried and Channing Tatum really worked onscreen and the 9/11 storyline as well the inclusion of the autism storyline worked as well.

Amanda Seyfried continues to amaze me.  As an actress, we are starting to see her talent emerge onscreen.  She has shown us her diversity as an actress in films such as ""Mamma Mia!"" to  showing us something different with ""Jennifer's Body"" but ""Dear John"" is a film that really shows us how much depth she has an actress and how she can literally transform herself into that character.

And as for Channing Tatum, I felt he was a bit wooden in terms of acting when it came to his role on ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" but for ""Dear John"", I felt his acting has improved and I actually have a few military friends who have similar behavior of his character, so in some ways, that stoic, quiet and quick-to-anger character was believable.  And it helps that ""Dear John"" producers utilized several military advisors for the film.

But the film, although enjoyable is not perfect. When the film begins to focus on the character of John and less on Savannah, the film tends to lose its magic because we are so used to seeing the two onscreen together.  As if these two individuals can take on the world.  But ""Dear John"" starts to veer off in a different direction after 9/11 and John, the soldier is conflicted as his fellow soldiers are willing to fight for their country and all plan to re-enlist.  John wants to do the same but that promise he kept to Savannah of reuniting with her, he doesn't know what to do.

And as one part of the film explores the relationship of John and Savannah, the other begins to focus on the father and son relationship.  The fact that John and his father never had a relationship when he became a teenager and what kept them together was their interest in coins.  A hobby that John grew out of and never understood why his father became addicted to it.

But as much as one would hope the film would focus on the actual relationship, it was a bold move by the writer to really switch things up in the plot.  Risky and possibly one of the major striking plot lines that will either be appreciated or disliked by the viewer.

Film critic Matt Mueller of [...] writes, ""Think twice before parting with your own hard-earned, though. This is a slothful weepie, plagued by a sickly mishmash of plot strands and a gaping chemistry hole at its core.""

In some way, Mueller comment is a bit specious.  Yes, the focus on the relationship is important and straying away from it because of 9/11 seems a bit off and does leave a ""hole at its core"".  But at the same time, the character of John and what took place after 9/11 are emotions many soldiers had.  There are many soldiers who knew they were going to leave their love ones, many knew that they may never come back but their honor and their duty as a soldier is something we read about heavily in the news after 9/11.  And I'm sure many soldiers after that tragic day, felt it was their duty to re-enlist.

ViewLondon film critic Matthew Turner writes, ""The main problem with the film is that the plot is so thinly written as to be practically non-existent. Yes, there's chemistry between the two leads, but there's no emotional depth to their romance and, given that the title of the film pretty much gives away the supposedly crucial emotional moment, it's hard to care whether they get back together or not.""

I have to agree with Turner, especially compared to other films based on Nicholas Sparks novels, chemistry and emotional/romantic depth have always played a major part in the film adaptations.  But I did care if the two would get back together or not.  There is no doubt that these two characters love each other but one lives in the US tormented that the man she loves may never come back and then the man on the battlefield feels he could keep a balance with his duty to the military and is kept going by his love for Savannah and that he can return after he has served his duty.  But there are twists and turns along the way and things manage to come full circle.

And various references by critics in regards to Savannah being to nice, helping out a charity and wanting to open a horse riding school for autistic children seem to be a bit farfetched for them.  But I actually knew a military wife after 9/11 who started a pet rescue and also adopted several children while her husband was on leave, so it's not as farfetched as it would seem.  But I suppose it all depends on one's experience, but there are people like Savannah out there as farfetched as some others may believe.

As for the letter writing, it may seem a bit cliche to some and particularly maddening to those who  wonder why e-mail is not being featured as this is a modern film as opposed to a Vietnam War or World War II film.  But there were lines that added to the story that the locations that John was at at the time had no access to e-mail.  But really, when you think about it, writing e-mails to each other doesn't have that same feel as two people writing about letters.  Call me old school but I felt it worked for the film and I find it much more romantic about reading one's emotion on paper and hand written versus typed on an e-mail.

But I suppose that this film is one of those films that will either be enjoyed or disliked and for me, I felt that there was a good amount of romance and emotional conflict to make ""Dear John"" entertaining.  And this is a Blu-ray release that looks simply gorgeous in HD and although not an action film that will provide you an immersive soundscape, the lossless audio works quite well for the film.

Overall, ""Dear John"" will definitely entertain those who enjoyed previous film adaptations of Nicholas Sparks novels.  By no means is this film as emotional and romantic as ""The Notebook"" but if you stay with the journey and not get so intertwined with its plot deviation from its romantic core, keep an open mind and you may eventually enjoy the payoff at the end of the film.",1279238400,,9784,4.6573426573426575

3838008,2,B0021L8V3Y,"I'm doing something a bit different this time through; I'm reviewing as I view, something of course I'd mostly never even have the chance to do, because I have no history of watching first-run movies on my laptop. (Yeah, I know; this is no longer 'first-run', but you get my point.)

Why? Well, mostly because I'm having such a hard time watching it. I'm shaking my head. Tons. So I figured as I'm only just over thirty minutes in as I'm typing this, I may as well take this tack.

But before I begin, a small disclaimer/preface: I just finished the novel this morning. (And reviewed it here, as well.) However, though I will have some things to say at the end regarding the adaptation, I am reviewing the film. As a screenwriter, I know all about the pitfalls of adaptation, that each medium is entirely different from the other, each having different needs, so it's not like I see the novel, or any novel or piece of source material as being sacrosanct. I'm interested in what was on the screen, not how it relates to its source material. For the most part, anyway.

So... 30+ minutes in: I think I've had to stop the DVD about five times so far, because there had been so many missteps. So many examples of bad construction of story, bad development of character...bad ingredients going into a quality production. (Situations where great production values are contrasted with a crap screenplay really break my heart. And make me angry.) I am, of course, trying valiantly to see things for what they are, rather than defaulting to 'Hey! Why did they change that from the novel?!?' And I'm doing pretty well here; I'm not liking what they've done because of what they've done, not because they've changed anything. About 30% into the movie, and the official sound-byte is: 'WTF?!?' In a nutshell, the setup has been HORRIBLE.

40 minutes in: I forgot to mention that I believe that narration in a movie -with very few exceptions- is an abomination and most often reveals laziness on the part of the screenwriter. Film is a visual and dialogue-heavy medium. If you have to have narration to tell your story...then you really aren't telling your story very well at all. Ironically, the novelist's primary credo is the same as the screenwriter's: 'Show, don't tell.' The film at this point is coming off as 'pat'. The conflict that's been presented has been 'Conflict-lite'. Even the emotional connection that was built between John and Savannah has been faux-chemistry. Bleurgh.

50 minutes in: You know, there's a difference between 'finesse' and 'ham-fistedness'. There's a difference between getting your point across and having people understand your point...and eliciting a reaction in the audience that resonates. There's a difference between 'on the nose' material, and material that sings with subtext. Guess which of these the movie is rife with.

60 minutes in: I'm kinda drop-jawed at how 9/11 was dealt with. Not that it should have been played-up. More the aftermath, how people at the party talk about things... I'm thinking 'facile' again. And the 'big talk' between John and Savannah...because nothing was believable or authentic during the setup, none of their anguish seems to be, either. And because they seem to have jumped into the sexual aspect of their romance, because very little was organically built story-wise, there's an element of falseness to it.

70 minutes in: And so because the setup was so badly constructed, because so little had actually been invested, the 'dear John' crisis point...fell flat. Here's a simple lesson for filmmakers wanting to tell an effective story using all the tools that the medium offers: don't use 'sign-holding' as a means to get an audience involved. It doesn't work. If you don't have authenticity going on, then all the lovely production values, all the nice music on the soundtrack, all the beautiful bodies don't mean diddly.

80 minutes in: Most everything is flat. Lifeless. Cardboard. Except... ...except the scene in the hospital between John and his father. Which was nicely done...and authentic.

90 minutes in: Compression, compression...compression. And hardly any real emotions involved at all. Sad, really. (This fact, not the film itself.)

100 minutes in: Hardly anything real present, at all.

Summary: There's no 'there', there. 'Dear John' is a badly-conceived, ill-founded film that, while gorgeously shot and artfully executed, is limp and an insult to the genre. A dearth of character development, an absence of real, discernible conflict, it was more the rumour of a tale than an actual tale itself. My most common reference here has been about the setup. When there's an improper setup, the rest of the film cannot possibly recover, and there certainly cannot be a memorable 'payoff'. It's like with a great joke: the punchline is almost entirely dependent on the setup. No great setup? Then no matter how great the punchline might be, it's still gonna fall flat.

I don't know if what was up on the screen was what had been on the page, or even what the director had intended the audience to see. What I do know is that while the production values reflected Mr. Hallstrm's abilities, the film itself did not. (Oh, and I didn't like the role Amanda Seyfried played, it wasn't a well-thought-out counter to Channing Tatum's. Never mind the fact that while she's a fine actress, she struck me as looking far too young for the part...and reminded me of an alien with those eyes.)

And now, regarding the adaptation: What a mess.

As I noted in my review of the novel, it was no masterpiece. But at least it had its own integrity. Told in the first-person, it had -albeit flawed- intimacy, whereas the film...is pure 'Meh'. Then of course, there are the changes made to the source material. Absolutely nothing wrong with that, there's nothing sacrosanct about source material when you're adapting...but you'd better be sure to improve on the original. The film, courtesy of the screenwriter Jamie Linden, does not. Not by a country mile. Changing Tim from a childhood friend only a couple of years older who has a younger brother with Autism to a much older friend with an abstentee wife and a son with Autism... Why? Try as I might, I cannot see how these changes could be rationalized. And let's not forget Savannah; the only aspect of what was fully and continually presented as what defined Savannah in the book, the fact she was smart, she was grounded, that her religion was big part of how she lived her life, all of this...was in Amanda Seyfried's deportment, the cool, calm and collected way she delivered her lines. But this blonde person up on the screen was not an appropriate Savannah to me in any way whatsoever.

As I moaned so loudly about the setup in the movie, I need to note that in the book, the romance between John and Savannah was given a context, its own defined place in the story, one that paid some respect to the genre. The film does not. The book took pains to have time unfold as it would have for someone in John's position unfold...his reupping, his deployment...while the film put it all in a compressor...and threw cogency out the window in the process. Even John's father's demise was given short shrift. (The scene in the church, where John, staring at his father's coffin is told to 'I'm sorry, we have another service starting soon...' was perhaps the worst-considered moment of all.) Even John's rapproachment with Savannah following his dad's death was-

Look, the adaptation was crap. It took source material that might well have been turned into a solid piece of genre entertainment and made a God-awful mess of it, insulting everyone involved. I'd love to hear Mr. Linden's take on what happened, how he came to write this script as presented. But really, in the end, the people most at fault for this film being as bad as it was...and I do need to reiterate here that it's not a question of bad acting or bad sets or bad music or a bad 'look' to the film, it's the story itself...are the producers, the studio people who greenlit this mess. Ugh.

3838087,4,B0021L8V3Y,"I was surprised.  Alot of what I've read from critics and movie goers said that this movie wasn't put together well nor was it well acted.  OK it wasn't the very best movie I've ever seen (that might be ""The Killing Fields""), but I do honestly think it was well done.

Richard Jenkins as John Tyree's father is superb.  His portrayal of John's autistic father was spot on, you get a sense of a functioning father with a son but also a sense that something in a subtle way is off with him.

Amanda Seyfried's performance of Savannah was very well done. She had a good range of non verbal gestures that she used to portray gratitude, love, appreciation, and anger.  You could also see the emotions as she tries to be understanding when she learns that John is going to re enlist and when she struggles to explain to John why she got married.  I'm sure Amanda can look forward to a nice career as she's already had 2 movies after Dear John come out with good reviews.

Many many people feel Channing Tatum can't act at all but in this, his performance showed a range of emotions that he hasn't had to do before and he did it in believable fashion, the scene when he was with his dying father reading him the letter he wrote, the emotions in his voice and expression was very well done.  The scene in the car when he left Savannah's house after after finding why she married, again his emotion came across very believably.  From this movie, I think he's got potential and it looks like others in Hollywood agree, as he's got 4 movies coming out in 2011 and already at least 2 in 2012.

As for the flow of the movie, I thought it flowed okay, it might have been better if Halstrom took more time to go through the years that pass between the time that John leaves Savannah to re-enlist (right after 9/11) to the time that John goes to see Savannah after his father's passing.  You don't really get a good sense that literally years have passed but then maybe Halstrom was trying to convery that the years were kind of a blur for both of them.

If that's what you are looking for in a movie, along with a few touching moments, and yes a few tears, then you will probably like Dear John.  However, on a deeper level, the movie often does not do a very good job explaining the motivation and reasoning behind the character's actions.  I needed a better understanding of exactly what was going on in Savannah's head when she wrote her ""Dear John"" letter and why she made certain choices that she did.  I also needed a better understanding of the depth of the relationship between Savannah and Tim because the movie barely touched on it. On the plus side, Richard Jenkins did a great job playing John's autistic father and helps us understand the struggles of this mysterious condition.

3838151,5,B0021L8V3Y,"""Dear John"" is a poignant movie, especially for a veteran or the family of those who serve in our armed forces.  This film presents the picture of a budding romance between a soldier and his civilian sweetheart.  The movie portrays the life of a deployed soldier, and the pressures that occur as the demands of the military clash with the  world on the home front.

The story begins as John Tyree, played by Channing Tatum, meets Savannah, played by Amanda Seyfried.  John and Savannah fall in love, and reluctantly part as John returns for his last year of commitment to the military.  Unfortunately the 9-11 attacks happen and John extends to support his country in war.  The continuing separation places great strain on John and Savannah's relationship.

This movie teaches lessons in communication.  John and Savannah have difficulty communicating their deep feelings and intentions.  They know they love each other, but struggle with revealing their feelings and uncovering the barriers to understanding each other.  This leads to making assumptions concerning  the other persons intentions and feelings.  The bad communication affects their relationship.

As a military veteran I found the scenes of John on active duty very realistic.  John is a ""special forces"" soldier assigned to a special forces team.  The attitudes and actions of John and his comrades is impressive in its accuracy and aura.

""Dear John"" relates a great story and tells it well.  I highly recommend this film.",1276560000,46,1489,5.133333333333334

Someone always dies! There is sooo much chemistry between John and Savannah. If John seems stiff, it's because he never was shown love till he met Savannah.

With John and Alan's mom's leaving the dadss both probably due to not knowing how to deal with autism.  I thought this was a good movie for autism awareness and how it can affect families sometimes.

Of course the love affair between John and Savannah was amazing. It was a love story of true love that had to make it through the near impossible, but in the end it worked out.  I highly recommend the movie. I thought the actors were all perfect for the roles.  Great casting.  Watch this movie you won't regret it.

Without that, some of the action in the movie seems a bit disjointed. Why did the characters act the way they did? It doesn't really make perfect sense.  Overall, I feel that the movie was good. While not a classic, it was a good way to spend a couple of hours. They mostly stuck to the storyline in the book, with a few minor changes here and there.

Ultimately, DEAR JOHN, was littered with montage after montage after montage. I have never seen so many montages used to get points across in my life. Thanks to these 'how to tell a story quickly' montages, we never feel the emotions behind it all. We get a montage to show how they fell in love. We get a montage to show how they seperated. We get a montage that shows how they kept in contact while John (Channing Tatum) is in the military. We get a montage that shows how 9/11 effected their lives and so on and so on. There are many more MONTAGES to follow... including the finale.

Montages are used to get across a lot of information at a time or to get across that someone is doing a lot of the same thing over and over. First of all, there wasn't an overabundance of story here that 14-20 montages were necessary. Yet, with all the montages there should have been a bonus feature montage of the montage to get across how the director used the montages to tell his entire story.

Dear John could have been so, so much better had we truly spent some quality time with the characters dealing with their time apart, had the director had faith in his actors to get across the information with their emotions and acting abilities. Yet, he didn't, and the result was an extended high dollar Hallmark Cards commercial with 'A' list actors.",1274918400,28,1548,4.443661971830986

3838288,3,B0021L8V3Y,"Last night I decided to indulge myself and watch the new Nicholas Sparks' film Dear John starring Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried. I really enjoyed the Notebook and attempted to watch other Nicholas Sparks' films but always found them to be too sappy with not enough plot and character development. Dear John falls right in between the excellence of The Notebook and the terrible disappointment of Nights in Rodanthe. Though it was very over the top at times, I was overall pleased with the film.

The film starts with Savannah, Seyfried, accidently dropped her purse off of a pier. Her date runs down the pier to enter the ocean and retrieve it when John, Tatum, jumps off of the pier into the ocean and gets the purse. From this moment on, the two have a connection and begin a two week relationship while John is on leave from the army. When John's leave is up and he must return to Germany, he and Savannah decide to stay together. He only has a year left after which they will be able to be together. However, September 11th happens soon after and his troop decides to reenlist. Though John wants to remain with his troop and defend his country, he knows that he will have to stay in the military for another four years. Such a decision seems impossible for the couple and will push them to the breaking point.

What I liked about this movie is that it was more realistic than other Sparks' novels and movies. Of course there was a layer of cheese, as there is with all Sparks' films. But I found some of the sappiness endearing. You have to be in the right mood for this film, but when you're ready for a little mindless romance...check it out!",1274832000,,1653,4.488372093023256

3838290,2,B0021L8V3Y,"""Dear John""  is a romantic drama that incorporates 9/11 as a crucial plot point.  John Tyree (Channing Tatum) is a soldier on leave in South Carolina, visiting his reclusive father (Richard Jenkins).  At the beach, he meets attractive young Savannah Curtis (Amanda Seyfried) and despite their diverse backgrounds, they click.  When his leave is about to end, they vow to write to each other until his tour of duty is complete and they can reunite, but when the planes fly into the World Trade Center on 9/11, he signs for a permanent tour of duty.

The best thing about ""Dear John"" is Tatum, who convinces as a romantic lead with an edge -- his character has anger management issues that create a lot of melodrama along the way.  Ms. Seyfried, by contrast, is bland.  Aside from her good looks, it's difficult to see what Tatum's John Tyree sees in her.

This ""chick flick"" is for those viewers who enjoyed ""The Notebook.""  It's a romantic story that takes unexpected turns and seems geared to turn on the tear ducts every few minutes.  Special features include an alternate ending, outtakes, deleted and alternate scenes, and a conversation with stars Tatum and Seyfried and director Lasse Hallstrom.",1274486400,5,1201,4.8431372549019605
3838291,5,B0021L8V3Y,"It's difficult to portray a love story with sensitivity and realism, and capture the sense of magic and the pain of loss without being trite or melodramatic. Dear John manages to accomplish this, with some excellent writing and excellent performances. While the storyline might have been a little predictable, its purpose was not to provide stunning surprises (although there were some pleasantly unexpected characterizations and moments) but to explore the birth and evolution of a love affair against the real intrusions of life and family. The real strength of this film lies in its bittersweet resonance with everyone who has a heart: who can't help but smile at the powerful chemistry of these two in the bloom of first love? Who hasn't felt the agony of loss, waiting day after day for a letter that offers your only lifeline to a world of magic and light, one so different from the daily grind of duty and responsibility? But ultimately duty and responsibility provide a sense of meaning for each individual, and this is the chink that undermines their foundation. Two people in love are still two individuals, as Savannah shockingly discovers in a pivotal scene when she finds out John has made an important decision without her, which will profoundly affect their life and love. John seems a bit clueless, unable to understand that his decision and how it was presented could have such an effect on Savannah, but we'll all been there, too. Isn't that what love is finally all about? Two individuals finding a way to co-exist in a way that has meaning for them both? Overall, a tender, bittersweet and universal story of love.

3838385,2,B0021L8V3Y,"Dear John,

I don't know how to tip-toe around this, so I'm going to come right out and say it: I'm a selfish whore.

Waiting around for you has been pure hell.  So frustrating!  OMG.  You think YOU have it tough over there (wherever you are), living here in my parents' multimillion dollar plantation estate is agony you can't imagine.  I mean, which of the eight rooms do I sleep in?!  Ugh.  And that's not even going into the summer house with a beach-front view.  It's so depressing.

Anyway, remember Tim?  Yeah, well, he needs me or something because he got sick and his son Alan is autistic.  Sure, my parents could have donated tons of money, and I have more time than I know what to do with, but that's just not enough for Tim and his son.  So, we're getting married, and that's why I haven't written in weeks.  My bad.  Talk about something that makes no sense at all!  I'm morally bankrupt, so I clearly can't empathize with how this decision will hurt you, but it's cool, because you still have your dad, who's kind of like Alan.  Wow.  I never thought of it that way.  You and Tim both care for an autistic person in some way, yet I'm choosing a family friend instead of my boyfriend.  Weird coincidence, huh?  But my decision is made; true, moon-crossed love comes in a distant second.  Simply giving Tim my time, my family's financial support, our access to top-notch physicians (given my widely spaced eyes, we clearly have had a difficult time finding a superb optometrist), and all the other benefits of being wealthy is not sufficient.  They need me more than I love you.  After all, how else do you explain a single father with an autistic kid moving in amongst the aristocracy like my family?  As if!  They NEED me.

Anywho, remember when I told you not to tell me what I don't know?  Well, bullets flying around must be scary, and that whole 9/11 thing must really affect you as a Special Forces soldier, but you made the wrong decision.  Besides, arranging an entire wedding - not to mention dodging all the bridesmaid wannabes - is real behind the lines, Medal of Honor stuff!  I can relate.  My BFF Jill has been blowing up my cell with all sorts of gown pictures and flower arrangements.  LOL

I should probably be more emotional about this all, but it's beyond my range (you know how I wane and lose steam when dealing with complicated and mature subjects).  Even if I wanted to, I couldn't act convincingly sad, or anything like that.  I thought the same of you, especially during that confusing moment with me before you went back to play Army, when you wore your heart on your sleeve (and your rank upside down) but it wasn't apparent what emotion it was.  Next time you are really emotional, you should tell your face.  Besides, it's clear that nobody with a heart could actually take my side in all this, since essentially what I'm doing is breaking your heart and devouring your soul through aggravatingly slow, mushy letters that are shallow as a thimble.  It's almost like this was written by a writer who has perfected a saccharin storyline with implausible details.

But I'm sure you'd show deeper emotional range if something happened to your father.  Speaking of your dad, could he be any weirder?  I mean, I'm cool with ""fun"" autism, where it's all riding horses and entertaining kids in helmets, but your dad's different.  I'm caring, but even I have my limits.  It's almost as if he's acting; and, if so, he's a great actor...like Richard Jenkins.  You?  Not so much.  Also, I hate lasagna FYI.

Oh, BTW, remember that Mule you and your father told me about?  Well, Tim has a mule of his own. ;)

See you soon,

About 30 minutes into the movie I started crying and it continued the remainder of the movie. Dear John, touched my heart in a way no movie has in a long time, I felt connected with the characters. I recommended this movie to all my friends and I recommend it to you too! It was everything I expected and more! :)",1270512000,86,570,4.135135135135135
3838388,3,B0021L8V3Y,"OK, it was date night.  What can I say?  I had the kids, and along with my girlfriend, we were looking for a movie we could compromise on.  ""Dear John"" fit the bill.  I didn't have huge expectations but I admittedly did enjoy ""The Notebook"".  It is sadly one of my favorite romantic comedies of all time.  Yes, I enjoy romantic comedies.  Get the jokes in now for all of you who are coming across this blog for the first time.  I also have three daughters, so with them and my girlfriend living in the house, I am forced to see some romance once in a while or I would be watching nothing at all.

""Dear John"" is (as you might infer) a movie about a young man in the military who finds his way home for a couple of weeks, falls in love and then gets dumped via the US postal service.  He is a surfer dude, with a rock hard body and a quiet reserved demeanor.  Channing Tatum plays the lead role and while I don't know too much about him, his acting was less than stellar.  While all the women in the audience were watching with their mouths wide open and a little drool forming or their lips, he didn't do much more than grunt his way through his lines.  I think he might want to stick to modeling.  His acting was nothing more than a few guttural slurs that were almost indecipherable.

While he drags the movie down, Amanda Seyfried and Richard Jenkins did their best to elevate it to a lofty level.  The army brat (Channing), who apparently had a violent past, finds love in Amanda's character and with Richard Jenkins doing an amazingly fantastic job as Channing's father; the three spend two weeks getting to know each other.  Richard Jenkins is at his very best playing the father who suffers in silence from autism.  One catches on quickly with the constant references to meatloaf every Saturday and Lasagna every Sunday, without fail.

As you might expect, John (Channing Tatum) heads back to his day job and Savannah (Amanda) heads back to school stretching their romance to thousands of miles.  It starts out well with letters exchanging hands but eventually it gets too difficult for Savannah to handle.  After the planes did their damage in New York City John decided to re-enlist for another stint and what was supposed to be a 12 month separation begins to stretch into years.  There is a reason the movie is called ""Dear John"".

The movie is filled with several sad scenes, struggles with handling the autism aspect and injects ""true love' into the mix.  While it wasn't a bad movie it definitely was lacking something.  In my opinion it would be extremely difficult having much of a connection with a man (Channing Tatum) who can't manage much more than looking good with his shirt off.  Whoever was in charge of the cast should be slapped on the wrist.  I change of actor in the lead male role would have done wonders with the chemistry.

Still, if you want a date movie this would be a fine one to pick.  All of the women would overlook bad acting for a cut six pack and you do get to see plenty of Channing topless.  Richard Jenkins deserves an Oscar nomination in my opinion for carrying so much of the emotional load of this movie as a supporting character.  I did not realize he was so gifted, but I thoroughly enjoyed seeing him in this character.

Overall, not bad but could have been much better.  It will have you crying, if you are a woman, or possibly and feminine male as I continue to be called from time to time.  I didn't cry for the record so get off my back.",1269907200,48,3491,4.403125

He is rude, bad tempered and aggressive.  I cannot believe they released this movie.",1269820800,9,558,4.606060606060606

Of course it doesn't hurt that Channing Tatum, a very sexy actor, plays the lead and is wonderful at it.  I haven't read the book yet, but will soon because I own it.  I can't wait till Amazon notifies me via email to let me know that this movie is available for purchase because I will be ordering it right then. I love Nicholas Sparks movies and books and think he outdid himself on this one.  I also loved ""The Notebook.""  My mother in law will be buying it also.  Thank you Nicholas Sparks and the Directors who decided to cast Channing Tatum for the lead!!!",1268092800,3,657,4.208

Some spectacular photography and mellow soundtrack music keep the substantial plot
going until the inevitable feminist turning of the tables: Amanda soothes the savage beast Channing, who in one scene breaks down like a schoolgirl in a Leave It To Beaver episode.
Channing's Father in the film turns in the best performance, as an autistic Dad -
I don't know why the scriptwriter(s) believe that a routine serving of meatloaf on Sunday is an indicator, or that a near-obsession with antique coins is that unusual. The ol' dude doesn't sleep with his wheat pennies, he studies them.
The early, borderline neanderthal Channing knocks down a guy who apparently has learned *not* to exhibit violent male tendencies, by striking back - even at the risk of his son thinking his Pop is a whimp for ""takin' it"".  This character, a divorcee, pines for his wandring wife's return until the wonderous Savannah moves into his life and cares for him when he bcomes very ill.
In the end, all have learned a lesson. It took a War injury, a dying friend, and a dead Father to bring Channing into his sensitive side. Savannah looks back and sees that she should not have shot hr mouth off about Autism. Wish the writer(s) didn't.",1267833600,5,1243,4.803738317757009

Writer, Nicholas Sparks is a jerk! What is this guy's deal? Does he have a personal vendetta against love and all of us? Why does he feel the constant need to put us through emotional misery every time he puts his pen to paper? And how is he capable of making us care about his characters so much? I guess he's a damn good writer.

If you don't know Nicholas Sparks by name, chances are you've seen at least one of the movies adapted from his novels: Message in a Bottle, A Walk to Remember, The Notebook, Nights in Rodanthe and his latest heart-breaker, Dear John.

Dear John has virtually one purpose: introduce us to two people who fall in love, and then take it all away and leave us devastated. Much like every one of his previous films, Dear John succeeds at this effortlessly.

I have a pet-peeve for movies that contain things that are too `on the nose' and Dear John has a big one. The main character's name is unsurprisingly John! I wonder if he'll get a `Dear John' letter at some point. Um, yeah - he will. When you've gagged down all of the cheese from this cheesy clich, we'll continue. Go ahead; I'll wait for you... all set? Good. It's still a good movie; I'm just having a little fun.

Channing Tatum stars as John Tyree; a soldier in the Special Forces, home on leave for two weeks in his small home-town on the coast of South Carolina.

Richard Jenkins gives us yet another outstanding performance as John's father. There are some touchy moments between him and John that will make any guy want to give his dad a call after the film. Jenkins plays a single father, who makes his son meatloaf every Saturday and lasagna every Sunday. If that's not sweet enough for you, he also has a hobby he's is infatuated with, that he started with John when he was only eight-years-old. You want to be this poor old guy's friend; he's a real sweetheart.

John meets a young woman in a way that I somehow didn't consider cheesy. She drops her purse into the ocean from a pier. John dives in to get it while the poor schmuck pursuing her, foolishly chooses to run all the way around the pier, to retrieve it. Needless to say, John beats him to it and is deemed the hero.

The dame is Savannah Curtis (Amanda Seyfried); a reserved college student with a good heart, and an urge to help others less fortunate.

Savannah and John develop a relationship over a two week span. They fall in love through a series of very entertaining montages. Then before we know it, act one has come to an end and John must go back to his military life, overseas.

John promises to return to her in 12 months, when his commitment with the Army is up, and Savannah promises to reserve her heart for him. It's puppy love, and yes it was only two weeks, but the filmmakers and the actors especially, make it work. We care for them instantly.

As anticipated, they begin to write constantly to one another. Their letters reminded me very much of what it was like being overseas in the military and having a lady waiting for you stateside. When you're over there, mail is like gold. It's more valuable than food, water and sometimes even air. It keeps you going and it keeps you alive. The filmmakers captured this and other Military characteristics, brilliantly.

One of the things in the film I found the most enjoyable was the reveal that this story takes place in the past. As far as I could tell, they never reveal the time period to us in the beginning. When 9/11 happens however, we realize we are back in 2001. John must decide between returning home to Savannah as he promised and extending his enlistment to serve with his unit.

He's given 48 hours of leave and uses it to fly home to South Carolina. One of his comrades reminds him and us, that he will spend more than half of that time flying to and fro; leaving him with a mere 18 hours to spend with his sweetheart. He is thankful to have even that long with her.

Having a woman (or a man, for our ladies in uniform) come running up to you and jumping into your arms at the airport upon returning home from a deployment, is everything. It's your inspiration to get through each day. Every soldier and sailor dreams of this.  The film showed this perfectly, and the scenes with John on his leave with Savannah were good ones.

Channing Tatum was sensational. This is at least the third time he has played a soldier in the Army, and he is more than convincing. His acting is progressing quite nicely and this film shows it gracefully.

Seyfried's character wasn't given as much attention. John is the main character, but Savannah was equally as important to the story and something was missing. Regardless, Seyfried plays her very well. She has a promising future ahead of her.

The first two thirds of the film are very entertaining. But from the time Savannah sends him his `Dear John' letter; it takes a turn that I just wasn't pleased with.

They want us to believe that after six long and lonely years of being separated, these two still have feelings for one another. Yes this is possible, but the film fails to sell it. They only had two weeks together and their six years of separation are beyond vacant. A year or two at most, would have worked. Spark's The Notebook tried this tact in a similar way, but executed it far better.

It was unclear why they even got back in touch after so long anyway.  That's bad enough on its own, but it also has one of those endings where you are left thinking, `what - it's over? Just like that?'

As disappointing as this was, Dear John more than exceeded my expectations of a teenage romance flick. Director Lasse Hallstrom is a visionary master, particularly when it comes to shooting films engulfed in romance. Having brought us classics such as What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Chocolat, The Cider House Rules, An Unfinished Life and Casanova, just to name a few; you could surely find less appealing ways to spend an hour and thirty-nine minutes.",1267747200,4,6267,4.509267431597529
3838393,5,B0021L8V3Y,"I really liked ""Dear John"". It's intense, full of feelings and the actors play really hard to transfer the story to people's eyes and hearts.

I could see myself represented a lot in it thru my personal life tale, re: army serviceman, loss of the soul-mate, etc, with its own peculiarities.

Those, though, who have read the book first and hope to watch a closer interpretation, will likely be somewhat disappointed... The book has a completely unique dynamic and no one can fit a 300+ page into 100 minutes.

It's worth watching, mind-opened and try to appreciate the life of those to are in service overseas for their countries.",1267660800,2,630,4.761467889908257
3838394,4,B0021L8V3Y,"I've read all of Nicholas Sparks' books.  Dear John was one of my favorites so when it came to the big screen I naturally wanted to see it.  I was NOT disappointed.  NO MOVIE will ever match the dynamics of the book.  When you go into a movie with that knowledge, you can enjoy what the movie has to offer.

While this is no ""The Notebook"", Dear John is definitely worth seeing.  I can't wait to buy it on DVD and I generally don't buy a lot of movies on DVD. Back to ""The Notebook""....I'm not sure if any movie will ever be able to match the delight, heartbreak, and hope it offered but that's ok with me!

Watch Dear John...I don't think it will disappoint.",1267315200,38,659,4.182539682539683
