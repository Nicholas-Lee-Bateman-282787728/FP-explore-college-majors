6508015,5,B00LU9SBOW,WE ARE PROUD OF U TRAVIS ROMERO AND CAST,1410912000,,40,3.5555555555555554
6508016,5,B00LU9SBOW,Michael Biehn is the man!  What a terrific little thriller.,1410739200,2,59,4.9
6508017,5,B00LU9SBOW,"OK the definition of Treachery is the willful betrayal of fidelity, confidence or trust. This movie is titled perfectly. I admit Michael Biehn is my favorite actor and that's why I purchased this film. Let me tell you though, Michael is known for his action, sci-fi, western, and horror films. Except for the ending, this takes place on one rainy night and it's a look into a family coming together to plan for a wedding and with a heavy rainstorm, they are trapped together with their secrets and lies. Michael is drunk the whole film and stays within character brilliantly. I love that he has done such a different dramatic role. His real life wife Jennifer Blanc-Biehn is also great in the film although her part is too small. I did laugh out loud 3 times and she was mostly the comic relief. Matthew Ziff was terrific as the son and actually garnered two award nominations for his role. Sarah Butler as the son's girlfriend was another stand out. It's a very short film at 65 minutes but that's actually a perfect length for a movie that is almost strictly dialogue. I love the fact as well that the rain can be heard the whole time in the background adding to the dreary emotions that go along with the secrets that unravel. There's also a ""secret"" that the film itself has that is hinted at so perfectly not to uncover itself so obviously before the ending. This film is not for everyone. If you need action, non-stop thrills, or slapstick comedy than pass by this film. If you love characters, actual acting, and reality than you might just eat up this little gem.",1407974400,13,1571,4.554770318021202
6508018,1,B00LU9SBOW,"Robert (Richard Gunn) and Becki (Jennifer Blanc) are getting married. Robert's partner and friend Henry (Michael Biehn) is at his house along with Henry's girl friend Vanessa (Caitlin Keats). Robert's son Nathan (Matthew Ziff) shows up from graduate school along with Cicilia (Sarah Butler) the love of his life.

Nathan doesn't get along with his father. Nathan wants to quit graduate school, Henry, who likes his drink, insists he stays. However, that issue is minor as we discover that there have been undisclosed relations among the people at the gathering who are not the current couples.

The film is essentially a 67 minute soap opera with the F-bomb. It was a substandard script that moved slow and with little passion.",1405641600,,727,5.05
6508019,5,B00LU9SBOW,"I love Sarah as an actress so i'm afraid it's a very biased opinion.  Of course it's not the best movie I have ever seen, but there are for sure a lot worse out there.  It's free for prime,  why not just watch it and see.  I do have to say it gets better as it goes on,  at first not so catching.",1463184000,,296,3.634920634920635

6508022,1,B00LU9SBOW,This is not a brilliant film it's tedious and annoying and disjointed. There are much better films out there if you want a study of human nature and disfunctional relationships.,1460246400,,177,4.933333333333334

What's with all the flashes of crap after some ""deep"" speech or conversation.  Dumb, just dumb.  There was no ""twist"" as some others have noted.",1459123200,,296,4.214285714285714

6508030,3,B00LU9SBOW,"Fairly warm oedipal drama about masculinity, poorly acted and nothing really revolutionary about it. If you're a ""nice guy"", you'll probably enjoy this film as it is told from your perspective. It does have a fair bit of horrible nice guy politics (hints of resentment towards women, a mixture of jealousy and disdain for the bad dudes that supposedly take their loved objects) but in the conclusion IMO it avoids falling into nice guy nihilism (da world doesn't appreciate us!) and ends up on the note that nice guy anxieties are really mundane in the big picture (ofc, only after the primal father is dead).",1457827200,,609,4.809523809523809
6508031,3,B00LU9SBOW,"This movie reminded me of a porno flick, with the flat set, weird lighting and music.

6508039,4,B00LU9SBOW,"I went into the movie knowing they made it for an incredibly low amount of money, thus my expectations weren't unreasonable. I thought Michael's Biehn's performance was great and I liked the twist and turns of the story.

I also thought the other actors did a great job, especially Sarah Butler.",1422403200,,295,4.784313725490196
6508040,2,B00LU9SBOW,"A fragmented, dull character study of a dysfunctional family (putting it very mildly)...

The only saving grace of this film was Michael Biehn's frighteningly realistic portrayal of an alcoholic, lecherous father. It was actually, though, the realism of the alcoholic aspect that I found to be the redeeming feature of an otherwise run-of-the mill script amidst and only moderately talented cast. I found that the lack of cohesion and flow, unless an intentional element added by the director, bled all the way through this film even to the musical score/sountrack, which was noticably distracting and frankly just annoying.

Having said that, this film is worth catching for any drama student or actor who wants to view what a truly accurate portrayal of an active alcoholic looks like. Had this not been just an hour-long indie film, I think Biehn could easily have garnered some professional recognition and ""best lead actor"" award (for lack of better phrasing on my part) for his performance. I honestly would not be surprised to find out he was actually drunk for some of his scenes.

This short film must rank among the best performances of his career.",1421971200,2,1158,5.020833333333333

6508050,3,B00LU9SBOW,"I just finished watching this film and now I feel rather as if my brain was shot full of novacaine with, a Thunderbird chaser.  Based on what I saw, the entire cast, INCLUDING those behind the cameras, got the same in possibly greater quantities!
First, I agree 100% with reviewer who stated he/she believed Michael Biehn was truly plastered throughout filming.  Most likely he was also stewed for several weeks BEFORE filming!!  I also believe he looked very thin and in poor health.  His normally superb talent was nowhere to be seen.  Supporting cast members tried valiantly to step up, but the cause was doomed to fail.  I can only assume Mr Biehn thought it would be a hoot to make this flick and did it simply for his own amusement.  Or, perhaps he owed a favor, his wife/girlfriend knew the director, Mr Biehn signed the contract while under the influence, or, and this is my favorite, his Mom asked him to help a friend of her friends' son.....the list of possibilities is virtually endless!
No matter how it evolved, it never made it further than a ""Q"" movie, at best!  Heed my warning and enjoy a hot bath with a glass of any kind of libation instead!!",1413676800,2,1162,4.552884615384615

6508057,3,B00LU9SBOW,"Hmmm... it appears someone ran out of cash. Either that or the director got 80% of the script.  For a guy like me who loves character driven films, this had potential.  It is a short format film and had the groundwork of something promising.  Believe me, there are both better and worse movies out there in the indie circuit.  And if you have an hour to kill, this isn't that bad.  But if you like movies that wrap up nicely at the end... skip this one.  I think some of the reviews are unfair and some are a little too glowing.  This is  C or C+ film if looked at objectively.  Its a good topic that should be explored...but I just needed a bit more thought at the end.",1411516800,4,670,4.131782945736434
6508058,1,B00LU9SBOW,"There are only two words to describe ""Treachery."" Stew. Pid.

Okay, that's not really two words but it's the best I could come up with to describe this mind-numbingly boring and dumb film. There are so few reviews of it on Amazon and IMdB that I am filled with the hope that few people subjected themselves to this travesty. Other than Michael Biehn fan, who all seem to think it's fabulous, I can't imagine anyone recommending ""Treachery"" to someone they like. And speaking of those on-line reviews, most of them have errors in identifying the characters, which is not surprising because there are too many of them who have one thing in common: they are abhorrent. If listening to rich people natter endlessly about their supposed values and judging others based on said values sounds good, then you should watch ""Treachery."" You deserve it.

The story sounded interesting and seeing that Michael Biehn was the star are the things that seduced me into sitting through this mess. I'm pretty sure Biehn was actually drunk throughout his portrayal of the alcoholic father. Either that, or he woke up one morning and forgot everything he knew about acting. While some of the cast did the most they could with the little they got, a few should have been working for the caterer, not the film company (do movies like this have caterers?).

And the ending. Without revealing anything, I can say that the ending was not worth the wait. Actually, it was totally worthless. It succeeded in disappointing, annoying, and making me hate the movie even more. Did I mention that I didn't enjoy ""Treachery""?",1411516800,3,1592,4.824175824175824
