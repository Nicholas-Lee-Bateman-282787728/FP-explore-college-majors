3978024,5,B002S3CTL0,My family dearly loves the New Tricks series. We watch them over and over as there is so much going on that we always find new gems we missed in previous viewings. We would love to watch seasons 5 and 6 but they aren't available in the US at this time for Region 1 players. Someone needs to light a fire under the BBC to get their programming to us much faster than they have in the past.,1307232000,,388,3.9871794871794872
3978025,5,B002S3CTL0,"We have have seen every season of New Tricks and love them. Great acting, all the actors not only can act, they have timing so that the humor is truly humorous - you don't need a laugh track to tip you off that something was said that is supposed to be funny. The writing is exceptional - I hate that so many U.S. shows (and now more and more U.K. programs corrupted by us) have simply godawful writing - hoping that talented actors can pull something out of a hat - you need both good writing and acting and if you want both, see each and every episode of New Tricks. Unreserved positive reviews for all seasons. Both my husband and I love them and never miss an episode on PBS.",1299369600,,679,4.190839694656488
3978026,5,B002S3CTL0,"I saw this series on BBC and characters have a great interaction - funny with the reality of older people trying to balance physical realities of age and use experience & savvy to solve good mysteries.  Thought was kind of like older people's version of NCIS (you like each character but enjoy the mysteries they solve too). So while I bought the whole set for my parents, I am watching them all myself too...need multi-region DVD player though.",1281225600,22,445,4.705128205128205

3978028,5,B002S3CTL0,"Detective Superintendent Sandra Pullman heads UCOS, solving previously unsolved crimes from the past.  Her team consists of three ex-policemen who for various reasons all opted for early retirement.

If you enjoy ""Midsommer Murders"", ""Pie in the Sky"", ""Foyle's War"", or ""A Touch of Frost"", you'll enjoy these clever mysteries with a minimum of violence, almost no gore and no sex scenes.  The rapport between the characters is exceptional and their ages allow them to bring a fresh perspective to their work.

In the fifth series, the ""New Tricks"" team members continue to bend the rules, uese their own methods and test Strickland's patience to the limits.  This time out, the detectives are forced to face their demons in both their private and professional lives.  More than ever, they must pull together and support one another.

Series 5 consists of 8 episodes on 3 disks.  This series is currently not available in the U. S. in a Region 1 NTSC version.  These are REGION 2 PAL DISKS. PLEASE BE CERTAIN THAT YOU HAVE A REGION 2 OR REGION-FREE DVD PLAYER CAPABLE OF CONVERTING PAL SIGNAL TO NTSC.",1273276800,28,1100,4.870967741935484

3978060,5,B002S3CTL0,"This is a stellar British detective series with an equally impressive cast.  Amanda Redman as no-nonsense detective superintendent Sandra Pullman heads the UCOS (unsolved crime and open case squad).  Retired detective Brian Lane, played by Alun Armstrong, combines humor with his intellect as he aids the team.  Dennis Waterman plays ex-detective Gerry Standing, a ladies man with three ex-wives and kids to support.  Rounding out the squad is James Bolam who plays widower Jack Halford, ex-detective who is still at the top of his game.
.
  I own four seasons of this series and every season is great.  What's so much fun about it is these detectives are friends as well as colleagues, often eating and drinking together.  They all seem like friends of mine.  It's also super that the series is presented without overt or graphic violence,  You know violence exists, given this is a crime series, but the violence isn't thrown in your face.  This series is recommended viewing.",1411516800,,978,5.012422360248447

3978065,5,B002S3CTL0,"Theres simply no stopping NEW TRICKS. The season 5 DVD release includes eight must-see episodes.

There is absolutely nothing average about this crisply written series. The dialogue is witty yet believable; the story lines are tightly written yet detailed; the drama is heart-pounding yet the comedy is laugh-out-loud funny; the actors are seasoned yet each performance is fresh. The NEW TRICKS team just doesnt seem capable of putting a foot wrong.

One of the most unique qualities of the series is its incredibly broad appeal. The characters are older, and the appeal to a more senior crowd is undeniable. Amanda Redman is among the strongest female leads TV has to offer, an undeniable draw for women. Shes also incredibly gorgeous, a fact that certainly couldn't escape the notice of most red-blooded males. The mysteries are intricate and interesting and of the highest quality for the arm-chair detective.

NEW TRICKS continues to fascinate because it continues to innovate. The personal stories of the four leads take very dramatic, even dark turns throughout Series 5. The audience sees a very different side of each of them as the series progresses.

The behind-the-scenes featurette is short at 12 minutes, but a lot of fun and a great addition to the set. The only thing Im disappointed in is the fact that Ive watched them all. More please!",1397433600,,1353,5.026785714285714

3978074,5,B002S3CTL0,One more in the series of a witty English comedy dealing with police. This will leave you laughing and wondering why we don't have this in the US.,1377388800,,146,4.25
3978075,5,B002S3CTL0,"This series is one of the cleverest series to be on TV today. The British know how to make good TV, and this show is one of them.

3978088,5,B002S3CTL0,"Clever producers, at the end of each series, there is a cliffhanger which requires I buy the next season.  This tactic is really not needed as the series is fascinating enough on its own.  Brian, among other personal problems, is a recovering alcoholic and throughout the series he has fought against taking another drink, even though the crew often pops into a pub for a pint.  Unfortunately in this series, Brian has a relapse and I was probably not the only one sitting in front of the screen saying ""no, no, no, don't do it!""

It is a show that really has a tight group of ex-coppers who go about breaking mysteries that have been left unsolved for several years.  They are also known as cold cases but the BBC version is a bit brighter and has interesting charachters that you would not normally find elsewhere.  What is terribly funny about ""New Tricks,"" is its believable and rather normal roles that you would find among such a group of older coppers.  If you have ever lived in England you know that this is a very believable group of people.  The whole series is teaming with very real and normal influences.  Even their homes fit the kind of lifestyle a retired officer would live in.  This series is aces and the actors are marvelous.",1340064000,,757,4.522058823529412

It's about an ""old"" retired group of London police detectives that re-open crimes.
Excellent character development and believable characters.
Not necessarily predictable and each episode normally ends with an ironic/funny ending.
Not all the characters are young and beautiful, nor are weapons usually present (unlike American detective TV series).

3978113,5,B002S3CTL0,"After viewing Season five (5) of ""New Tricks"", my love of this series does indeed continue.  I have made no secret on this board of my high regard and admiration for this series.  As in previous seasons, Season five (5) features three (3  rule-bending, not ""politically correct"", and ""they don't give a damn about the powers that be"" retired cops that are led by a younger-looking female Superintendant that tries (most of the time unsuccessfully) to keep the ""rule-bending"" older detectives under control and adhering to the rules.

Once again, in Season five (5) of ""New Tricks"", the team mentioned above is faced with horrendous ""cold cases"" that no one wants to deal with and they solve  some really nasty cases most splendidly using some rather unorthodox and (what is considered  ""old fashion"" methods) driving ""the powers that be"" completely CRAZY.

Season five (5) has eight (8) episodes on three (3) discs with each episode running about one hour.  Each episode is wonderfully written with loads of humor that had me laughing out loud many times plus some really good mysteries for the team to solve. All of the characters are acted by some very fine British actors that I have grown to adore.  I particularly love short-tempered Amanda Root (appeared in ""Little Dorit"") as the leader Sandra Pullman.  I also adore horny Gerry Standing (played by Dennis Waterman).  All are really great plus there are lots of guest appearances, this season,  including Claire Bloom (of ""Brides head Revisited"" fame).

If you want to be well entertained by some very good mysteries and to have a laugh or two, you can't go wrong purchasing Season five (5) of ""New Tricks""; it's marvelous.

By the way, I used the subtitles because I did not want to miss any of the great dialoge.",1317600000,2,1771,4.840531561461794
3978114,5,B002S3CTL0,"this is an outstanding series about a group of over the hill oddballs who are re hired by the british police to solve old cases (20 yrs or so) using their old fashoned skills and modern technology. While it can get pretty gritty sometimes, it can also be very very funny. I highly recommend it. My problem is with amazon, I preordered this with their garantee that I would be charged the lower rate if they dropped the price at release, well 2 hours after I recieved the notice that it had shipped its selling for $7.50 less than I paid. They lied",1317168000,3,547,4.320388349514563
3978115,5,B002S3CTL0,"The BEST and SMARTEST  Television detective show ever! - with a cast of characters that will make you laugh (and cry), often at the same time.

If you've clicked on this review knowing that it is the FIFTH season for this absolutely fabulous BBC detective series, then you have probably watched the previous four seasons. If not, I recommend that you go back and find Season One and start from the beginning. There are two reasons for this: 1) Though each 55-minute episode (unlike the US the BBC is non-commercial and does not insert commercials in its shows) contains a different crime to be solved, the four main characters' lives evolve over the run of the show. And 2) You'll be missing some great acting in the earlier episodes.

As I said in my reviews of previous season's DVDs, ""This may be the best TV series ever - in my opinion."" Thanks to Acorn Media in the US, this volume (Season Five) will be available in the US as NTSC format on September 27th, these were the episodes aired in the UK in 2009 but they don't seem dated at all.

These episodes are like potato chips, you can't stop devouring them once you have started. (But these shows are healthier for you than those chips - or ""crisps"" if you are in the UK).

The last moments of the last show in Season Four provided the first ""cliff hanger"" in the series, and I waited with anxiousness to see what happened next. For those following the series, I won't spoil the surprise. You'll know soon enough. And, unlike the previous four seasons, the personal lives and ""inner demons"" of the four characters - Jack, Brian, Jerry and Sandra are revealed this time around. (Look for the woman who plays Jerry's daughter in two of the episodes. She's Dennis Waterman's (Jerry) real-life daughter. Speaking of Jerry, in episode four, the team investigates the death of Jerry's idol - a rock musician in the 70s band Bad Faith! (The previous episode has the death of a deejay, another music theme. Other investigations include a commune of hippies, and a magician. While Jack is missing in from the cast of the second episode, well-known Actress Claire Bloom makes a guest appearance. And the smartest of the group, Brian, is having to fight his affinity for liquor this season.

I will not go into the plots of the episodes - they are detailed elsewhere, though I highly recommend that you don't read them in advance. Even when watching I skip the ""plot outline"" shown at the beginning. It's more fun to ""let it happen"".

While a few of the plots in this volume get a bit too confusing - I find it makes me play them again to see how the crime - usually a murder - took place. But these crimes are only there for the four lead actors to use their own unique personalities and expertise to work together. If there is an underlying theme here it is ""teamwork works!:.

Like the end of Season Four, this volume ends with a fairly emotional episode that will stick with you for days after watching it.. Whenever I finish a Season of this show I go through ""New Tricks"" withdrawal, knowing that it will be another six months before the next season appears on DVD. But since the show is already into Series Eight on British TV, Acorn should be releasing Series Six in Spring 2012 soon. (I'll try to post a note when I know the date.)

UNLIKE the previous four seasons, there is a ""bonus feature"" this time. It's a 12-minute ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette featuring the series creator and the four central actors discussing the plots of this season. DO NOT watch this until you have watched all the episodes. There are way too many spoilers. It's also interesting that the actors real personalities are not unlike the characters they play. Boy would I like to have dinner with this group!

So keep on buying this series so that Acorn will keep releasing them. And ""Thank you Acorn"" for giving us in the US a chance to see one of the best shows on TV.

3978116,5,B002S3CTL0,"My husband and I are both so happy with this series that I am buying each season as they become available in US format. The story, humor, and characters make us want to share them with friends, as well as having them to watch again and again. We have Netflix and buy used on Amazon Marketplace a lot so it has to be good for me to look forward to spending money on these. One plus for the DVD over watching on PBS, we use the captioning so that we don't miss a single joke, no matter how regional the accents may be.",1314403200,,516,4.019417475728155
3978117,5,B002S3CTL0,"A smart and sexy DS with 3 ex-coppers solve the open/unsolved cold cases. It is the characters of this team, their personalities, and their relationships that make this crime time such a delight. Funny tops the crime mystery. Amanda Redman  (`Little Dorrit') as DS Pullman or just Sandra, has become a brilliant star with her role of leading her men. She's tough, but like a mother, or daughter with Brian (Alun Armstrong-`Garrows Law' `Bleak House'), Jack (James Bolam-`Beiderbecke'), & Gerry (Dennis Waterman-`Sweeney'). And though they far outdistance her experience as a cop, they respect her. DAC Strickland (Anthony Calf-`Upstairs Downstairs') is their often antagonistic boss. And we must mention Brian's wife Esther (Susan Jameson-`The Queen' and voice for Catherine Cookson audios). Expect first name familiarity in New Tricks, like in a family series. They are a cop family. In Season 5 each of the 4 detectives has a personal crisis.

SUBTITLES are available for all 8 episodes loaded with guest stars
1 SPARE PARTS-Hanson's attempted murder trial (he tried to kill Jack) puts the USOC team under the discrediting attempts of a defense barrister. More than crime investigation, as always, plot in a plot. Every episode has that.  A cop family drama.

2 FINAL CURTAIN-Jack's AWOL after Hanson's trial & release. The rest of UCOS reopen a case when a biography provides new clues. The DAC's nephew (Will Kemp) is assigned to aid Sandra (the cop with the daring cleavage) and accepts the lad's dinner offer on her birthday, which the team forgot. Star Claire Bloom (`The King's Speech' ) plays Helen Brownlow.

3 A FACE FOR RADIO-10 year old arson that killed a radio DJ is reopened. Jack's still AWOL & the team loathes replacements. Cameron Wyatt is played by George Asprey (`Nancherro' `Coming Home') and Jeremy Kirk by Reece Shearsmith.

4 LOYALTIES AND ROYALTIES-Jack's back. OCOS opens a suicide case 30 yr old after a deathbed confession. Then the best witness dies. Paula Jennings (5th episode as Paula Standing ) again is guest star.

5 COULDN'T ORGANISE ONE- Unsolved beer vat drowning at a brewery gets the guys excited. Hand's on investigation? The original case was botched by a bad cop who was a colleague of Sandra's dad. She faces unknown facts about her dad. Stars: Sir Freddie by Ronald Pickup (`Ivanhoe' `Rector's Wife'); his son Julian (Jonathan Firth-`Middlemarch' `Luther'-yes it is Colin Firth's brother); Sandra's mother Grace is by Sheila Hancock (`Boy in the Striped Pajamas' + lots more).

6 MAGIC MAJESTIC- Magic ends in murder and during this UCOS investigation Brian & Gerry get mystically involved. Could a magician force a girl (Kirsty Mitchel-`Monarch of the Glen') to kill? Lulu by Sara Stewart (another former from `M of the Glen' a must-own series).  A big LOL ending.

7 COMMUNAL LIVING- Brian takes his alcoholism to a commune being investigated for a death. Sandra and Brian are at odds over the commune's ways. See Ruby Bentall (`Lark Rise to Candleford' another must own series) as Heidi; Ash by Richard Harrington (`Bleak House'); Emily (Gerry's daughter proved to not be really Gerry's kid) is played by Hannah Waterman, the real life daughter of Waterman who plays Gerry. Confused? This father/daughter team also appeared in episode 1.

8 MAD DOGS-USOC looks into a soldier's death but warned off by MI5. Not good. An awkward alliance unravels into chaos & more. Leaves with a loop into the next season. It should be as compelling as this season 5.

BONUS: Behind the Scenes for 12 minutes.",1314144000,4,3542,5.035897435897436
