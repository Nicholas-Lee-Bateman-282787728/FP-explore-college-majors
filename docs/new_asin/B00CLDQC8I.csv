5725968,5,B00CLDQC8I,I learned the real truth of what transpired at the end of World War Two! I was mislead like everyone else!!,1456790400,,107,4.142857142857143
5725969,5,B00CLDQC8I,a good piece to add the collection of the happening  of real history.,1453334400,,69,4.3076923076923075
5725970,1,B00CLDQC8I,"Lousy, DVD could not be used in the United States, seller should have known before shipping to US, since shipping was free, it will cost more that what the DVD is worth to ship back to Great Britain. Bad buy",1453334400,,207,4.2
5725971,1,B00CLDQC8I,"Well, I have to discourage reviewer Paul Spring. As a matter of fact, the book is much more interesting (unfortunately it wastes the first 140 pages on the rise of the Nazis and the war until 1945 as if we all were unfamiliar with it). After page 140 it becomes interesting.
I recently got it from the public library and finished it last week.

The film however is a big disappointment. It's NOT a documentary as expected.
Author Gerrard Williams couldn't get several South-American witnesses as expected (he got plenty in the TV docu series ""Hunting Hitler"" in front of the camera on the History Channel which aired in December and it has 8 one hour parts) and as were quoted in the book.

InsteadWilliams made a movie about Hitler's supposed escape (he arrived via U-Boat in Argentina in July 1945) with actors who played Hitler, Bormann, Eva Braun, Fegelein and others (???).

Only one witness (who now lives in the UK for 3 years and is in his 80's, so he could care less) was willing to speak in front of the camera being afraid of getting killed by the Nazis who supposedly are still very active in Argentina. He talks a bit at the beginning and a lot more after the end of the film.
According to him and Gerrard Williams, Hitler died in 1962. We'll never know, but I'm furious if this monster really got away with everything after having killed so many Jewish, Sinti, Roma, homosexual, politically left wing people and then enjoyed the rest of his life (17 years) in South America.
We might never find out for sure.",1451865600,3,1522,4.547445255474453
5725972,5,B00CLDQC8I,I always wondered about Hitler escaping Germany my grandfather always talked about it and how the Vatican and the Catholic Church were operating a underground network getting the Nazi's out of Germany. I rate this documentary 10 and i would suggest every 1 to watch and keep a open mind.,1432425600,9,287,4.76
5725973,2,B00CLDQC8I,Could have been 20 minutes instead of 90,1427760000,6,40,4.125

8583031,5,B00CLDQC8I,"I do believe that Hitler escaped to Argentina,....OR there were alot of people hallucinating that they saw him and many of his supposed dead henchmen.  It makes sense that Eva Braun would have been there, and it makes sense they had children together, .....unlike the bogus propaganda that has been passed around that Hitler was unable or unwilling to engage in sexual relations with Eva Braun or any woman.  Do I care if him and his junta went down there?.......I can care less frankly, I just believe in history and I find it very very strange that some historians or those with some sort of political agenda would even discount the possibility thereof.  I do believe though, that Joseph Stalin was the leading killing leading figure of the twenty century instead of Hitler, and technically Stalin killed more people right in his own little empire, and ya don't see documentary after documentary after documentary on the evils of the soviets and Stalin and the communists, mainly I suppose since hollywood and the entertainment industry are so marxist themselves.  Am I objective?.......Oh sure, as a proud american I feel america could have left itself out of a conflict with the Reich, .....but there was good money in making arms and selling ships and planes to the opposing western powers of Great Britain of which drew america into a world war twice, and was even responsible in a way recently of trying to set up Donald Trump with a fake dossier,......I guess to draw America into another world conflict I suppose with Russia for some sort of monetary and power gains for the UK.  I am actually sick or hearing about the germans and nazzzzzis on the history channel,...too bad the history channel couldn't focus more on what was done to the american indians just up to four decades before ww2 started, a real genocide and shame, apart from all the nastiness that occurred all around the world at that time by all powers.  I am a big supporter of the US military of course, and america, but I too was taken to a stupid war zone once, the first gulf war in 1990 to 1991, a total waste of time to protect some sort of oil interests I suppose for,......wait for it,......the UK, I mean, everyone knows that middle eastern oil generally benefits europe where in north america we got alot of our own oils and also from south american countries, and I have never fully recovered from my service in that filthy desert and will have a premature life end due to all the poisons I was exposed to.",1517788800,,2493,4.667425968109339

8583033,5,B00CLDQC8I,Very compelling evidence that Hitler did escape to South America.,1495670400,,65,5.6
8583034,5,B00CLDQC8I,This is a true story in which FBI and CIA documents support.  Hitler was a coward and cowards do not commit suicide.  They flee like the cowards they are and try to hid in the face of defeat.,1491004800,,191,4.0
8583035,5,B00CLDQC8I,Love history and this changes what we all thought really happened. Hitler died in South America and not Berlin. 100% Most of the accepted history is wrong. Grey Wolf proves one example,1489795200,,184,4.78125
8583036,4,B00CLDQC8I,"Very engaging, mostly sad, with an excellent soundtrack.  I dunno if it's true or not, but it's very well done.",1486684800,2,111,4.55
8583037,2,B00CLDQC8I,"Where's the evidence? This is a fascinating DVD, & i''m a true believer in many conspiracies, but it answered none of my questions. What about the two SS men (not mentioned in the film) who testified in a German court in the 1950s that they were with Bormann & saw Adolph & Eva's bodies in the bunker after the shot rang out? Did they lie? Why? What about the skeleton found outside the bunker who's DNA matches Bormann? Did the German government fake the test results? Why? There's no doubt that many Germans fled & relocated in South America. There's no doubt that some were assisted in their flight and/or in their concealment, but please explain the testimonies of the SS men who allegedly found the bodies immediately after Adolph & Eva killed themselves. There's no doubt that there were many Bormann sightings, but please explain the DNA evidence. This film is a commendable effort that needed to be put forward, & I really want to believe, but where's the evidence?",1479340800,5,973,4.695906432748538
8583038,1,B00CLDQC8I,"I bought this DVD only to find that it doesn't play on American DVD players. The Seller said they had it displayed but it wasn't in a way that I saw it.
Was really disappointed...",1471824000,2,179,4.142857142857143
8583039,5,B00CLDQC8I,We have not watched it yet but love the book,1457308800,,44,3.5
8583040,5,B00CLDQC8I,Perfect companion to the book. This film really helps those of us doing serious research into this subject.,1456963200,,107,5.0
