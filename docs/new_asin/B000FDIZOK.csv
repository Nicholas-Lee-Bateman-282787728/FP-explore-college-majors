2561632,5,B000FDIZOK,"Too bad the Czech version is not available in the US. It has, however, english subtitles.
The music is lively, the acting outstanding and what can I say about Gabriela Benackova and Richard Novk. Just perfect. Try to get it. You will not be disappointed.",1196121600,2,254,4.666666666666667
2561633,5,B000FDIZOK,"First, I happen to be Czech.  Second, I was in a production of this opera when Pittsburgh Opera did it in the early 70s.  We even used the Duquesne University Tamburitzens for all the dances; and yes they were on stage for most of the opera just as in this production.  This production brought back many happy memories.  The costumes, dances, and sets are the real thing.  It's a studio production that got it all right. Benackova and Dvorsky are superb!  Only Fritz Wunderlich and Pilar Lorengar on the EMI recording conducted by Rudolph Kempe have a slight edge on this superbly sung, played, conducted, and directed production.  The sound is very good for its age.  The orchestra is excellent in all the dance sequences and especially the overture.  IT DOESN'T GET MORE AUTHENTIC THEN THIS!  Don't miss this Czech gem!",1180483200,20,821,4.75886524822695
2561634,5,B000FDIZOK,"It is not easy to find Romantic period opera sung as beautifully as the best Mozart opera productions, placing this DVD at the top of my list of great romantic opera recordings.  The singing is precise, accurate, expressive and powerful.  I could not ask any more from the orchestra or conductor.  Everyone is fully commited.  Ensembles are perfectly in tune and balanced almost all of the time.

Costumes are very colorful and as far as I know, authentic.  The inclusion of an outdoor market full of bright toys and decorations is a nice touch.

Some will fault this opera for the large number of dance segments, but this is a comic folk opera.  No effort was spared in filming this essential element.

Nit pickers will find several things to fuss over, but the sum total of these defects is not enough to knock off a star, in my opinion.

First, this is a lip-sync opera film based on an existing recording from 1980.  There is slight distortion on occasion.  Dynamic range has not been compressed to any great degree, which is rare for a Supraphon recording of this vintage.  The sound overall is better than many much newer DVDs.  Turning down the treble and turning up the bass helps warm up the sound as Supraphon recordings tend to be bright.

Second:  There are numerous small sync errors as the picture gets ahead and behind the sound.  The technology just was not perfected in 1981 when the cast was recalled to do the lip sync.  There is so much to watch that this is not as annoying as it would be in a minimalist staging, where the viewer has nothing but the singer's faces to hold their attention.

In conclusion:  Eastern Europe has a different way of doing things, but this DVD overall is a pleasure to see and hear.",1176336000,6,1732,4.543689320388349
2561635,5,B000FDIZOK,"I was fortunate to see this opera in the National Theatre in a very subdued Prague in 1969, and bought this version on CD as soon as I became aware of it.  I was delighted to see that it was available on DVD, and the visual images are up to standard, apart from the singers' lips appearing to be slightly out of synch! I recommend it enthusiastically.",1171756800,4,351,4.2388059701492535
2561636,5,B000FDIZOK,"This is a charming, beautifully sung production of an unfairly overlooked Czech masterpiece.  Peter Dvorsky is a lovable and endearing Jenik.  The magnetism between the handsome Dvorsky and his sweetheart Marenka, sung by Gabriela Benackova, is believable and heartfelt.  Even the children are unusually adorable.  This is a highly recommended performance, warm and uplifting, culturally authentic and very well-directed.  I found myself watching it over and over again.

There is another beautiful Bartered Bride with Lucia Popp and Siegfried Jerusalem (in German) that may one day be released which is on an equal or even higher level than this because of Lucia Popp's singing and her partnering with Jerusalem.  With the recent flood of re-released historic opera performances on DVD we may be fortunate to have two brilliant Bartered Brides in the near future.

But this Czech DVD alone can introduce viewers to an inappropriately and unjustly overlooked opera which deserves to be appreciated for its warmth, humor and especially, its ravishingly beautiful music.",1168732800,13,1068,5.469512195121951
2561637,4,B000FDIZOK,"Mr Pfeffer pretty much has it right with this DVD. The performance takes place in some kind of studio set. Also, Smetana's forte in this work seems to be the overture & dances. This is a voice-over with the audio part coming from an early eighties Supraphon recording. The singing, however, is at a very high level, and I am giving it an additional star. The critics felt the same when the LP was released. I have seen Dvorsky at the Met and He is an excellent tenor. Benackova can be found on DVDs of ""Faust"" and ""Mefistofele"" to good avail.",1168041600,6,542,4.376237623762377
2561638,1,B000FDIZOK,It never came.  After several weeks we got a notice that it was no longer available.  I hope we'll find it somewhere someday.,1167782400,,125,4.391304347826087
2561639,3,B000FDIZOK,"At first glance and hearing, this colorful 1981 (so the credits claim) broadcast production of Smetana's 1870 comic masterpiece seems to be the ideal authentic Czech performance.  But the eyes benefit less than the ears (and maybe the salivary glands).  Singing and orchestral direction and execution are just about perfect, and the immediate yet reverberant stereo sound also satisfies.  But this turns out to be one of those made-for-TV-movies with post-dubbed sound and endless full-face closeups.  On screen, the singers pretend to sing but mainly act--very broadly as befits a folk-based marriage farce--while the music emanates from a place very different from the TV studio where the video was shot.  The ""silent stage"" result looks not operatic but more like a daytime soaper.  I envy the many viewers who won't be as put off by this effect as I am.  Smetana perhaps wrote more persuasively for the orchestra than he did for the voice, and it's the famous Overture and Dances that carry the opera rather than  the lengthy but less memorable arias.  Although the dancing--there's plenty of it--is very fine, the boisterous boys and girls of the ballet corps tend to intrude too frequently in almost every scene.  Musically the disc is a delight.  Also culinarily--does anyone have a recipe for the spectacular Bohemian ""pizza"" served and consumed with gusto and superb local Pilsener beer at the inn in ""Act II""?  (No act divisions, curtains, or other effort to give the illusion of a theater in this production).  If Qualiton, the distributor, were to include a coupon good for some Czech pastries as shown in the film, I'd withdraw my objections.",1163894400,32,1655,5.040441176470588
8121096,3,B000FDIZOK,This show name has come up in many of my books regarding the concentration camp at Terezin (Theresienstadt). I wanted to see why it seemed to somehow mobilize large numbers of people who were under the most horrible of conditions to laughter and happiness. I suppose that since I am not of the European era in question I simply could not understand the humor. Other people may well really enjoy this show.,1504310400,,405,4.638888888888889
8121097,5,B000FDIZOK,"It is obvious that this production is designed to showcase Czech art, crafts, costumes, social mores, etc. along with Smetana's music. I think it works in that it allows us to see the culture that Smetana himself grew up with and tried to emulate in his music.  The overture and three of the dances (Polka, Furiant, and Dance of the Comedians) have long been popular on concert programs, as they are virtuoso orchestra show pieces. Snippets of the ""Comedians"" (and some of the other dances) can be heard in Roadrunner cartoons. Also famous is the ""Beer Chorus."" It shouldn't surprising since this country produces some of the world's finest beers (i.e. Pilsner) and the Czechs are the some of the greatest consumers of beer in the world. Smetana's own father was a brewer.  Some parts of the production are substandard--the lip movements and other actions  to the music don't always match, and the translations are often awkward--but the it's the music, glorious music that matters! It's rustic, folksy, hear all the folk songs, elements, dance rhythms, often behind the main melodies. The singing and the musicianship are all of high quality.",1488412800,,1143,4.973821989528796
8121098,4,B000FDIZOK,"Having recently traveled the Czech Republic and wanting to connect further with that culture, I purchased this opera which was produced during Communist times. It was a performance in the Czech Republic and feels much more sympathetic and fond of the culture than another version of the opera I bought - the Deutsche Grammophon recording of a performance in Germany and using thhe German language. This is ironic, since, as I understand it, at the time Smetana wrote it, there was much interweaving of the German and Czech cultures in the type of village where this opera took place and as I understand it, the composer, although Czech ethnically, was more comfortable in the German language than the Czech language. This Czech performance in the Czech language is clean, bright and colorful with sympathetic characters, for the most part. Unfortunately, the libretto is too repetitive for my taste, but I loved the atmosphere. I am not well qualified to judge the singing but the acting is enjoyable and I especially enjoyed the performance of the marriage broker, Kecal. The portrayal, while not entirely sympathetic, was humorous and the most striking aspect besides the color, as compared to the Grammophon version. I also the portrayals of Maenka, the bride, and Jenk, a suitor, to be very believable. There is not much tension in the story, but I have found it enjoyable enough to watch several times. I should also say that since I only know a little Czech and much more German, I expected to like the Grammophon version much more than this version but give this higher marks based on the theatrical aspects. However, I would encourage interest in either version of this opera.",1483747200,,1684,4.933098591549296
8121099,3,B000FDIZOK,"It's a solid production, well-sung and well-performed. However, the production is not tight enough to keep the audiences' attention and bring out the fun to the full extent.",1470355200,,173,5.214285714285714
8121100,5,B000FDIZOK,"I love this cheerful opera, having seen it in Prague and twice in Boston, the last time with my 6 year old granddaughter, who loved it. Wonderful story and music, and this great production highlights rural aspects of Czech culture as well.",1416787200,,239,4.714285714285714
8121101,3,B000FDIZOK,"The virtues of this performance, now quite elderly, are the national costumes, dancing and the correct language. This is not a stage performance though and the TV production has real issues of poor lip synchronisation that, in the end, I found distractingly intolerable. I sold my copy.

There is an alternative - and that is the excellent Popp/Jerusalem version. That is a stage performance from the Vienna State Opera conducted by Czech expert, Adam Fischer, and which sparkles with believable relationships and excellent singing. The setting is traditional and the costumes are good. There is no issue with lip synchronisation. Some may baulk at the German language used but, in my view, the benefits far outweigh the deficits. You may have to search for this DGG title under the German 'Die Verkaufte Braut'

For those who wish to see the words being sung synchronised with the sounds that are heard the choice is clear as this version is not accurate and the excellent Popp/Jerusalem is correct. That alternative disc is also the more enjoyable as it is a recording of a real stage production with far more sense of a performance spontaneously unfolding in front of the viewer. This observation is the result of A/B comparisons and not just casual bias.",1343088000,,1258,4.957345971563981
8121102,5,B000FDIZOK,"I have seen Prodana Nevesta on stage 3 times; this production easily tops all 3.
Although the resolution is not up to HD standards, the visual production is stunningly beautiful. The continual dancing is exactly what one should expect of peasants celebrating the end of winter on May Day, and the dancing is beautifully done. The orchestra infuses the entire production with the gaiety of the day.  All characters act their roles convincingly.  Not only are Dvorsky and Benackova in good voice, even the minor roles are beautifuly sung.  Marie Vesela makes one wish that Ludmilla had many more lines in her part.  Miroslav Kopp sings Vacek's part so beautifully that one could see the character as a romantic hero, if only he'd stop stuttering!  Novak's Kecal is hilarious (but Kecal is always hilarious).  The lip-synching is close to perfect. I am enough of a purist to like the subtitles which are literal translations rather than paraphrases.",1324857600,,946,4.993630573248407
8121103,5,B000FDIZOK,"I was a bit apprehensive about buying this DVD at first, one, because it is film/tv based and not on stage, and the production dates back to 1980-81.
But you know what? I have seen this particular production now at least 8 times in its entirety. The singing is simply superb. Gabriella Benackova glitters. Dvorsky matches her superbly and so do the other principal singers. The dances and cinematography are superb by any standards and so are the settings. And the fact that it is sung in its original language, ie, Czeck, makes it sound even more pleasing, although I don't know a word of Czeck. (Ever since I acquired a Beethoven 9th sung in Russian, I have always thought a lot of stuff gets lost in the translation, and when one is used to listening to the work in a particular language, it takes some time to adjust to the same sung in another... like Don Giovanni sung in German)
It would be unfair to compare this production with the one by Lucia Popp and Jerusalem that is on the traditional stage.
Actually, I would recommend that you own both. They are absolutely charming in their own ways, but between Popp and Benackova, although this production is lip synced, the music comes out beautifully in stereo, and the film is as clear as one can expect it to be given the date of production.
I think this is one of the rare cinematic productions of an Opera that is worth owning, together with operas like Carmen (Domingo/Migenes) and Rigoletto (Pavarotti/Gruberova)
Highly recommended.",1300060800,2,1493,4.680608365019012
8121104,5,B000FDIZOK,"I love this production.  It is exciting.  The dancing, the costumes all left me at the edge of my seat.  The acting is excellent, the singing superb.  Yes it is dubbed, but that does not detract from the overall effect.  I watched it all the way through, then watched it again it was so exciting.",1206835200,,296,4.3090909090909095
8121105,4,B000FDIZOK,"If you are expecting a Hollywood-like, professionally-executed, polished DVD production of Smetana's famous ""Bartered Bride"", this DVD is not for you. While I enjoy this version, it is a faithful rendition of what a communist-bloc video from 1981 should look like.

The costumes are bright and the cast members are cheerful, but the technical aspects of the production look low-budget. The video director's decision to quickly cut back and forth between duet singers and opposing choruses gets tiresome quickly. The camera dolly apparently needed oil or new casters as the video's sweeping shots come out jerky. Flutter from the video transfer shows up a couple times, also. The lip-synching other reviewers complained about didn't bother me, though. Some of the translations in the English subtitles reminded me of things my former English students said, so they were good for a chuckle.

Despite its shortcomings, I enjoy this production. The sound is clean and as lively as Roadrunner music should be. Even the less-than perfect execution is charming in its own way, especially in this age of computer generated imagery. It serves as a time capsule from a not-so-distant era that looks exactly as one should expect for the time.",1197417600,6,1231,5.180904522613066
