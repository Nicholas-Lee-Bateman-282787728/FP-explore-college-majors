8527100,4,B008E0TZHC,"Skinnylates is a unique circuit-style workout by Pilates instructor Amy Cady.  It combines Pilates-style matwork moves with simple low-impact cardio for a complete full-body workout all in just under 35 minutes.  You will only need a mat for the workout, and Cady and her two background exercisers, Julianne and Tracy (who show modifications), are performing the routine without shoes.

The Main Menu of this DVD offers options for Play, Chapters, or Slideshow.  Selecting ""Play"" allows you to complete the entire routine, although brief slides flash on screen introducing each chapter.  I have described the segments according to the chapter breakdowns below.

INTRO/WARM-UP (5.5 minutes)
Cady, who teaches live, explains in the intro that this workout combines low-impact cardio with Pilates strength work.  The first 2.5 minutes of the warm-up starts with some standing stretches (e.g., rolling the shoulders) and then moves into some simple matwork moves such as a hundred variation, butterfly, crunch, and half rollback.  The final part of this segment includes stretches for the hip flexors and hamstrings.

INTRO/OBLIQUE INTERVALS (6 minutes)
Here Cady introduces all the cardio that will be used in the workout, broken down into two separate 3-minute segments.  The first cardio series includes step backs, knee repeaters with punches, and plies with side-to-side taps.  The second series focuses on the obliques by including more twists:  from a second position plie, Cady performs punches across the body, then overhead, then double-time

PILATES ABS (3.5 minutes)
In this matwork segment, Cady combines variations on the Pilates Hundred (she does a two breath version and uses different leg positions) with the Pilates Series of Five exercises.

UP TEMPO INTRO INTERVAL (3 minutes)
Here the first cardio series (step backs through side taps) is repeated at a slightly more up-tempo pace

SIDE-LYING SERIES (3 minutes)
This section focus on Pilates mat work.  Cady performs traditional Pilates exercises such as leg lifts, front-back, and large circles, but she adds in arm movements.

INTERVAL PUSH-PULL WITH OBLIQUE SERIES (3 minutes)
This is a repetition of the second cardio interval (standing punch series), although it begins with a single round of the repeater knees.

PRONE WORKOUT (3 minutes)
This series starts lying face-down for swan, arm/leg raises, and swimming; Cady also moves to side-lying for hip drops.

CAN CAN ABDOMINALS (4.5 minutes)
Cady starts leaning back on the elbows for a kick series, first alternating kicks with bent knees, and then moving from a frog position to cross legs.  After a transition with rollover, Cady repeats the series, this time with the hands place flat behind you.  She again transitions with rollover and completes another set on the elbows.

COOL-DOWN (3.5 minutes)
Here Cady repeats most of the stretches from the warm-up in reverse, including butterfly, hip flexor and hamstring stretch, and shoulder rolls.  The entire time for this workout is 34 minutes.

I liked this workout more than I had expected.  Although the cardio was a bit repetitive, I didn't mind, as I liked the simplicity of the moves, and I enjoyed the punching.  I also liked Cady's twists on the basic Pilates matwork.  Furthermore, because the workout segments are so short, the total time flew by!  In fact, the only thing that I really did NOT like was the Can Can segment, which was longer than any of the others (and which I also found more different).  However, because this DVD is so well-chaptered, I could easily skip over that section in the future.

Cady does move quickly through the moves with little instruction, so prior familiarity is a must, but the moves themselves are mostly beginner level.  I would recommend this workout to any experienced Pilates practitioners who enjoy fusion-style workouts and who would be interested in a unique interval-style routine.",1364688000,8,3913,5.232744783306581
8527101,5,B008E0TZHC,"I absolutely LOVE this DVD!  It is very easy to follow and doesn't seem TOO strenuous, but yet I always feel it the next day. I love that it combines traditional mat Pilates with light cardio. I have many workout DVDs, as my schedule is too crazy for the gym, but I always seem to pop Skinnylates into the DVD player over all the others. You will not be disappointed!",1361836800,3,367,4.242857142857143
