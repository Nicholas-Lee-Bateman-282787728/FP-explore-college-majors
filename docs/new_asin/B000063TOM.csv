1691880,4,B000063TOM,"SHACKLETON may not be the ""greatest adventure story of all time,"" but it ranks high on the list of great adventure films. Kenneth Branagh (HAMLET, WILD WILD WEST) delivers a performance worthy of an Emmy. A great supporting cast, top-notch visual effects, and some riveting storytelling keep this somewhat slow-moving film in constant motion. A good one for the collection! Grade: B+",1019001600,,383,5.193548387096774
1691881,5,B000063TOM,"Any one with any interest in maritime history or a collector of films, this movie is just spectacular.  Kenneth Branagh and his support cast could not have been casted better than this.  The 30 plus you pay for this film is well worth the investment.  Give it 6 gold stars!",1018742400,2,273,4.42
1691882,5,B000063TOM,"I certainly thought ""Shackleton"" was an above-average mini-series, but this is really a first-rate Collector's Edition DVD set.  ""The Making of Shackleton"" featurette is the least impressive of the extras, and it is certainly an above average example of the traditional look behind the scenes of the production on the ice flow in Greenland.  However, it is the Ernest Shackleton episode of A&E's ""Biography"" and the History Channel's ""Antarctica: A Frozen History"" that are impressive, especially since both incorporate the actual footage and photographs taken by Frank Hurley when the ""Endeavor"" was trapped in the ice during the failed Trans-Antarctic expedition in 1914-16.
On one level it is hard for this mini-series to compete with those historic pictures: I almost felt as if the movie should have been in black & white as well, in the spirit of the same logic that dictated that approach in ""Schindler's List.""  Of course, here those images become real people trapped in a desperate quest for survival.  One advantage of watching the movie on DVD is that you do not have to endure all those commercial breaks, which certainly worked against the drama of 28 men trapped on the ice.  The cumulative feelings of hunger and despair should not be dispelled every ten minutes by commercials, otherwise your sense of empathy is hurt.
Kenneth Branagh plays Shackleton without the Irish accent that marked him as a less than authentic British hero in some eyes, but the most important part of his characterization is the idea Shackleton is a flawed hero.  What stands out is the way that Branagh embodies the man's contradictions, going from dictatorial outbursts of anger to nonchalant moments of compassion.  As the situation worsens, Shackleton does whatever it takes to lead, whether by threats or examples or whatever else is needed.  ""Shackleton"" reminds me of a Greek tragedy, with the ensemble of actors making up the crew of the ""Endurance"" functioning very much like a Greek chorus, from which members emerge to engage the leader in a series of dramatic confrontations.  As much as he had to contend with the elements, there was the human dimension as well.
If you have not yet seen the mini-series, I would even suggest that you watch MOST of the ""Biography"" episode.  Certainly it will give you a more detailed background on his life and career prior to the point that ""Shackleton"" begins.  So as soon as he prepares for the ""Endeavor"" trip you can switch over to the mini-series and complete his ""Biography"" when you have finished.  With the production of ""Shackleton"" the re-discovery of this remarkable survival story has come to an end.  Amazing to think that but a few years ago he was a largely forgotten figure.",1018224000,39,2729,4.9714285714285715
1691883,5,B000063TOM,"I am basing this review on the IMAX, as the DVD is not out yet.  I cannot comment of the audio / video quality (although I reckon it'll be top) nor on the extra features, so the following is a comment on the content and the story.
Captain Shacklton embarked on a journey to reach Antarctica, with a handful of courageous and well-spirited crew persons.  Before long, their ship was blocked before reaching shore, and then sunk (8 months later), by the mounting ice, and they started fighting for their survival.
Even during the most depressing times, the men always trained the dogs, played soccer, and teased each other, waiting for somebody to rescue them.  But shackleton finally realised that only they would be able to save themselves.  He went on a colossal journey with a few men on a tiny boat, to save all the others that were still waiting.
This is a story of courage, strength, endurance, and devotion that perhaps would never be matched again.  An extraordinary story of people who place there fate blindly in others, and of team spirit.
The scenes also include many footages (B&W) that were taken by the ship cameraman.  These too are amazing.
Not to mention that the cinematography and the directing are outstanding.",1016496000,4,1230,4.751173708920188

1691937,3,B000063TOM,"With Branagh as Shackleton, I thought this could not miss - and the first part does not. This is a truly harrowing and heroic tale with its beginnings in British bravura, and the film fits the bill. The fault comes in the ending, once the journey toward Elephant Island begins.  It needs more grime, more despair, more pain. The overland journey on South Georgia island was nothing short of brutal and the men lived only because of luck and Shackleton's astonishing force of will. When Shackleton, Crean and Worsley arrived at the whaling station, they were filthy, covered in long hair and beards, and quite unrecognizable.  It sadly diminishes the heroic tale to have such clean cut actors walking up the beach.",1437264000,2,713,4.836065573770492

I highly recommend everyone watch this movie and then try and complain about how tough we have things.  After this voyage when Shackleton decided to do it all again, all the able bodied men who were on the first trip signed up for a second try; that shows you what a great leader Shackleton was.",1426550400,3,442,4.432098765432099

1691975,5,B000063TOM,This movie was mind boggling. Amazing to think a group of men would take on such an adventure with so little. It combined breathing nature and very good acting.,1391731200,,160,4.551724137931035
1691976,4,B000063TOM,"I like Mr. Branagh, and this is an interesting and well-made movie.  But it presents an abbreviated view of hardships endured, the courage and determination of the men who made this remarkable journey to the bottom of the world, and the interminable amount of time consumed by this ""failed"" voyage.  I recommend that you read one of the many good books on the subject.",1387238400,,368,4.734375
1691977,5,B000063TOM,"An absolutely riveting story, well filmed and dramatic. You almost feel as if you were there. I have watched it several times and will no doubt watch it several more times before I get tired of it. The actors are all first rate.

1691980,5,B000063TOM,"Everyone should read this book.  There is quite enough ""sniveling"" in this world and we could learn about true grit from these men.",1376611200,,131,4.695652173913044
1692004,5,B000063TOM,"My dad originally purchased the VHS on ebay sometime in the mid-oughts. Living out on my own I wanted my own copy of the amazing dramatization by A&E so I bought this 3 DVD collectors version. I haven't watched the 3rd disk yet, but I plan on it this winter.

If anyone has read the account of Shackleton's expedition with the endurance you will realize that most of the events that take place in the film actually occurred in real life. As the title claims it is truly one of the most remarkable survival stories of all time. Kenneth Branaugh does a very good job in this film playing Sir Earnest Shackleton and they actually share a considerable likeness in complexion.
NOTE: This movie is best watched on a cold night amidst a raging blizzard - you connect with the characters suffering a lot more than watching it on a warm summers day. No, I'm not joking.",1376611200,2,860,4.477707006369426
1692005,5,B000063TOM,"With all the fictional heroes in the movies, Shackleton was a real man who was a hero. An explorer who did the impossible, and lived to tell about it. Loved this when I saw it years ago on TV, but to own my own copy! One of the most incredible stories of adventure that you can ever see - and you MUST read the books that inspired the movie.",1376611200,,341,3.9565217391304346
1692006,5,B000063TOM,I am a history buff. I think this story is so heartening and shows the Victorian spirit which settled our country of New Zealand.  We live close to Antarctica and this dvd gives an insight into the real conditions there.,1372723200,,220,4.5
1692007,5,B000063TOM,"I really liked this movie.  Good historical content.  I liked it a little more than :The Last Place on Earth"", simply because it didn't have as much dialog in England, before they got to the ice.",1369353600,,195,4.388888888888889

1692010,5,B000063TOM,"Fantastic story, brilliantly directed and acted. Branagh brings all his youthful 'Henry V' brilliance and bravura to the principal role. Moving narrative explores Shackleton's single mindedness in preserving the lives of his crew, set against the background of the waste and carnage of World War 1.",1357257600,,298,5.5
1692011,5,B000063TOM,"Kenneth Branagh is a fabulous actor and this film was definitely worth watching.  I actually felt cold watching it.  The hardships our early explorers endured (i.e. George Mallory and Mt. Everest) are definitely worth watching.  If you have an inquisitive mind, these types of films, books and docudramas combined with google earth make the experience definitely more believable and understandable.",1355875200,,398,5.6
1692012,5,B000063TOM,Shacleton with Kenneth Branagh is an epic motion picture based upon the true story of the Shackleton expedition to the Antartic during the First World War. The ship gets locked in to ice early on and is trapped into a frozen prison in an Antarctic bay. Shackleton and the crew soon realize they will die in their frozen morass unless they can somehow escape over land. The story is adventurous and the ending is truly miraculous involving a truly dramatic sea voyage in Antarctic waters using a dingy the crew had recovered from their ship.,1352160000,,540,4.6947368421052635
1692013,5,B000063TOM,"This is a very informative educational mini-series that traces one of Shackleton's explorations to the Antarctic. It is an incredible tale of survival of his entire crew mostly due to Shackleton's leadership and refusal to fail. I have seen other accounts of this expedition, but this is by far the best one.",1330214400,,308,4.9423076923076925

1692025,5,B000063TOM,"I haven't bought the DVD as of yet, but barring any technical problems with the discs I expect it to be the same movie I saw on TV but without the commercials. I've read the negative reviews on here that pointed out the lacking of certain material and I agree, also lacking is the fact that not all of Shackleton's men lived.  There was another group of men that Shackleton left at the other end of the Antarctic, These were the men of the Ross Sea Party, who were stranded at Cape Evans in McMurdo Sound, after Aurora had been blown from its anchorage and driven out to sea, unable to return. The ship, after a drift of many months, had returned to New Zealand. Shackleton traveled there to join Aurora, and sailed with her to the rescue of the Ross Sea party. This group, despite many hardships, had carried out its depot-laying mission to the full, but three lives had been lost, including that of its commander, Aeneas Mackintosh.  This was never shown in the film.  So why am I buying it?  The scenes are great!  The frozen Endurance trapped in the ice slowly being crushed to pieces.  The photographer diving into the frozen water to retrieve his photographic plates, and yes, even the amputation of toes.  That's what happens in extreme cold. I look forward to not having commercial interruption.",1324857600,,1303,4.5905172413793105

1692027,5,B000063TOM,"I first read a book about Sir Shackleton and was happy when I saw this DVD on Amazon.  I bought it but with it being a TV mini series didn't expect it to be as good as it was.  Wow.  Very great acting and beautiful images.  One of the best mini series movies I've ever seen.  It's very true to life about the struggle in the frozen wild.  I was very impressed with it and very happy I bought it.  Well worth owning especially at this price.  If you love the story of early 1900s exploration to the Poles, Mt Everest etc then you'll like this movie.  Don't rent it when you can own it for a great price.  The bonus features are worth it.",1321747200,,636,4.016
1692028,5,B000063TOM,"I have read many historical accounts of adventure and exploration. This is by far the most rivetting. As observed by a contributer to the A&E Biography program (included with this set), if not for photographer Frank Hurley's priceless photographic record of Shackleton's voyage and rescue, no one would believe it was true.

This DVD movie vividly portrays Sir Ernest Shackleton (played by Kenneth Branagh)for all of his admirable and enigmatic qualities. Branach nails the character -- Shackleton's stubbornness, determination, and loyalty resulted in not only new discoveries, but also the rescue of his entire team - not a single loss - after nearly 2 years of wandering the frozen Antarctic wasteland. (Relevant aside: Sir Ernest had a second support team on the other side of the Antarctic continent that did suffer the tragic loss of 3 lives).

The movie is so realistic, it is like a hidden-camera documentary. The acting is supurb, the landscapes breathtakingly beautiful. It is long (3-plus hours), so a general knowledge of the story will help the first-time viewer.

This epic is in the spirit of Apollo 13, but with none of the electronic and other technologies upon which we all depend for our daily survival. Never before or since has there been such a hero as Ernest Shackleton. You will watch this movie over and over.",1310774400,2,1334,5.027149321266968
1692029,5,B000063TOM,"I've only seen a documentary about this incredible survival tale, so I was impressed by the accuracy of this A&E epic.

1692031,4,B000063TOM,One of the better survivalist stories. This four hour plus movie drags a bit at the beginning as they spend quite a bit of time depicting how he gets funds for the expedition just as WWI is about to breakout. This time would have been better spent on the survival portion of the movie which seems shorter than it could have been. Still an enjoyable movie and comes with a third actual history DVD of the original Shackleton expedition.,1302134400,,435,4.518987341772152
1692032,5,B000063TOM,"Once again the British prove they are masters of the silver screen. Why does Hollywood look tawdry and artificial by comparison?  One guesses it lies in the authenticity of the British acting tradition. The best of them genuinely seem to inhabit the characters they play.  By contrast, most Hollywood ""stars"" play the image of themselves they have created. Do they actually believe it?  It seems somewhat pathetic, but we pay people well to be phonies.  Perhaps we need fantasy in order to make life more bearable.  At any rate, Bravo Kenneth Branagh for making the character of Shackleton live and breath.",1287532800,,606,4.96039603960396
1692033,5,B000063TOM,"This 3 DVD set was truly incredible. It IS the ultimate survival story. Sir Shackleton manages to get  money together to finance his expedition in 1914 right before WW1 for his second attempt at the South Pole. Shackleton gets the King of England's blessing. He and his men are to take a Norwegian coal powered wooden ship renamed the Endurance as close to the Antarctic continent. Then with 69 dogs and sleds they are to make a trek across the entire continent as Amundsen had already made it to the South Pole.

Unfortunately the Endurance gets caught in the ice and Shackleton and his men must abandon ship as the hull is crushed by the ice and Endurance sinks. Then his men and him must do what they can to survive on the ice. They use the dogs and themselves to pull 3 small life boats toward any open water. They are starving and must kill and eat their dogs. Finally the 28 men get their chance to cross open water to Elephant island. They make it. They are starving so Shackleton and 5 men must take a small boat over 800 miles to South Georgia Island .The ""skipper"" the real captain, one of Shackleton's men using a sextant manages to navigate the small boat in terrible weather to South Georgia island. What a voyage. Then the group must split again as some of his men are sick and can't walk and Shackleton and his men  must hike  miles over a mountain range to the other side of the island to a whaling village for help. Many of the men left behind don't think Shackleton will make it. We learn Shackleton had a severe heart condition he kept secret.

He makes it to the whaling village and he and the whalers comes back for them. Incredibly ALL survive and are rescued.

Shackleton and his men go back to England as heroes. Shackleton  and some of his men try again to do the Antarctic crossing in the 1922. Unfortunately this time he dies of a heart attack near South Georgia Island and is buried in the whaling village where he was once rescued. What a man. What an indomitable spirit to never give up saving his men. All the men are heroes.

What an epic story filmed in Greenland. The scenery was spectacular as well as the music. Great acting by Kenneth Branagh. A nice third DVD with The Making of Shackleton, Biography Ernest Shackleton and Antarctica A Frozen History. My ultimate highest rating 5 stars PLUS for this 3 DVD set. You will not find a better true survival story. Can't wait to read the book Endurance.",1278633600,4,2436,4.434004474272931

1692071,5,B000063TOM,"Kenneth Branagh brings his customary swagger to this portrayal of the British adventurer Ernest Shackleton, together with a first-class supporting cast. Perfectly arrayed in Edwardian period costumes and sets, the story starts with the Antarctic veteran and lecturer learning that Roald Amundson has become the first person to reach the South Pole. He decides to one-up the Norwegian with the first trans-Antarctic expedition. The film follows Shackleton as he raises money, selects a crew, and carries on a love affair that his wife discovers. But he soon leaves both wife and paramour for his irresistable compulsion to conquer the unknown.

Shackleton and his men travel to Argentina and thence to Antarctica via the aptly-named sailing ship Endurance. It becomes trapped in the ice of the Weddell Sea for nearly a year before it is crushed. The men recover what they can before the ship goes down, then camp on the drifting floes for months while killing their dogs for food. They finally set off on foot, pulling lifeboats and supplies through ghastly weather until the ice starts to break up. After five days at sea, they reach Elephant Island, but it is far from shipping lanes. The groups' chances of discovery or rescue are extremely slim.

Their leader determines that they must save themselves by attempting an incredibly risky 800-mile open-sea crossing to South Georgia Island. After two weeks of fierce storms, they make the island by dint of exceptional navigation, but even then, their survival depends on trudging across its mountains to find a whaling station. These scenes are interwoven with scenes at home in Britain, where friends and family wait anxiously and where rescue missions are proposed but never undertaken, as the ongoing carnage of World War I makes the fate of 28 men seem small by comparison.

Shackleton himself comes across as something of a glib promoter, an ambitious man drawn by fame and glory. Yet when his back is to the wall, he proves that he is not just a great explorer but also an outstanding judge of character and an indomitable leader of men. His charisma and motivational abilities literally save his expedition-mates, allowing them to come home after three incredible years, long after most Britons have given them up for dead, with nary a life lost (though three men died in a separate expedition that left supply depots for Shackleton).

The script draws much of its dialog and detail from the diaries and letters of crewmen, who survived a harrowing journey through an amazing combination of strength, courage, resourcefulness, and sheer determination. The production values are superb, worthy of a theatrical feature film, and the cinematography, based on the documentary pictures and films of the expedition's photographer, is breathtaking. The outdoor scenes were shot in Greenland using a full reconstruction of The Endurance. You truly feel the bitter cold and exhaustion of the men, and their survival seems nothing short of a miracle.

The first two discs in this three-disc set contain only the 206-minute Emmy-winning made-for-television miniseries, without so much as a commentary or a subtitle, but the third disc holds three worthwhile documentaries. The first is a 49-minute presentation entitled ""Breaking the Ice: The Making of Shackleton,"" the second a 43-minute biography called ""Ernest Shackleton: Looking South,"" and the third a 92-minute history special: ""Antarctica: A Frozen History."" A profile of Kenneth Branagh rounds out the disc.

1692072,4,B000063TOM,"The Bottom Line:

The first half of this made-for-tv movie, which concerns itself with Shackleton back in England, is often slow, but the fine acting of Branagh and the more adventure-packed second half make this a film worth watching for those interested in the man himself or polar expeditions.",1238803200,,296,5.040816326530612
1692092,4,B000063TOM,"Gloriously filmed, with excellent acting, everything you could want as long as the truth about Shackleton doesn't matter to you.  Have read about Shackleton I was struck over and over at how poorly he was conveyed, reduced to a shallow, yelling, man, when he was in fact calm, cool, and collected.  How did the script writers fail to realize that a man who cannot control himself cannot control his men and the Shackleton story is in essence a study of successful leadership under extreme conditions

The movie contains some absolutely fantastic footage, however, I could never settle down and enjoy the film as I desired because so many factual errors kept being presented.  Shackleton was assisted by very able men and the film belittles most of them into little more than a mob of frightened men.  There was much wonderful stuff here - don't get me wrong, but if you actually know the story - have read the books - then turn off your brain before watching or it will drive you crazy!

2 stars for attention to set details and 2 stars for great cinematography, however, I took away 1 star for failure to present Shackleton as he was.  Perhaps it was their desire to humanize the man that lead to this.  Unfortunately Shackleton really was a larger than life figure - a man - not unlike some other well known men like George Patton, or Oscar Schindler - men who were uniquely suited for an extreme situation and excelled like no other men could have.",1226016000,3,1451,4.618677042801556

1692095,5,B000063TOM,"This is an absolutely superb collection.  The A&E Shackleton, featuring Kenneth Branagh, is beautifully directed, powerfully acted and faithful to the facts of what happened.  The danger here is that the adventure elements could be lost and the grinding facts of hunger, cold and life on the ice floe dominate.  Without understating the challenges, the film captures all of the constituent elements--Shackleton's personal conflicts (and loves, both licit and illicit), the financial ruin of his brother Frank, his fundraising challenges, the presence of WW I in contemporary consciousness, the adventure story itself and its powerful resolution.

The subsidiary material is spectacular--the Biography channel Shackleton, an extensive study of Antarctica, biographical material on Branagh, etc. and, perhaps most interesting, a special on the making of the film, with extensive coverage of the ethos of film production--meals, pep talks, challenges with regard to the shooting schedule, improvisation and the vagaries of Greenland/Iceland weather.  I especially liked the intercut footage from the original expedition and the degree to which the current production achieves its considerable authenticity.

Highly recommended.  Branagh is excellent.  Watch for a nice performance by Robert Hardy as the pivotal sponsor, James Caird.",1216166400,4,1330,5.890625
1692096,5,B000063TOM,"The story of Ernest Shackleton's grandiosely-named Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition is a pretty amazing one, which I will not summarise here as other reviewers have already done so.  Yet there is another story to this film - how one man fought against self-doubt, the hostility of the authorities and the indifference of the public, ultimately to rise triumphant out of a difficult situation and prove his true worth.  I'm talking, ladies and gents, about the acting career of Kenneth Branagh.

Branagh has been famous for ages but he has proved to be a mostly rotten film director.  His Shakespearean adaptations are heavy on attractive set dressing and star cameo appearances, but light on inventiveness, pace, spontaneity and even comprehensibility (his 'Hamlet' was a major offender, loaded with so many stars that despite thoughtful performances from the leads it ended up as a mere exercise in spotting who was going to turn up next), while his non-Shakespeare films (such as 'Peter's Friends', 'In The Bleak Midwinter' and the terrifyingly awful 'Dead Again') have not, on the whole, been much fun to sit through.

Thankfully for us all, Branagh neither wrote nor directed this remarkable true story about the time-honoured English theme of Heroic Failure.  All he had to do was play Ernest Shackleton, one of the most appealing and sympathetic figures of the heroic age of Antarctic Exploration.  He is at the head of a heavyweight cast, including such excellent actors as Lorcan Cranitch as Shackleton's bluff and loyal right-hand man Frank Wild - nice to see this fine actor not playing a bad guy for a change; Phoebe Nicholls as the faithful but melancholy wife; Embeth Davidtz as the glamorous mistress; Kevin McNally, wonderful as the ship's master, an ineffectual leader of men but a phenomenally gifted navigator; Mark McGann slightly wasted as the ever-reliable Tom Crean.  It's up to Branagh to match all these, as well as Charles 'Brideshead Revisited' Sturridge's economical script and meticulous direction.  He does so, with panache to spare.

Branagh has been so bad in so many of his own films for so long that it's become easy to think of him as a bad actor.  He is in fact a great actor, and he proved it with three very different films that were all made around the same time: this one, for Britain's Channel 4; Frank Pierson's 'Conspiracy', for HBO; and Michael Kalesniko's very funny comedy 'How To Kill Your Neighbor's Dog'.  In each of these films, Branagh brought to unforgettable life a doggedly humane and relentlessly determined Antarctic explorer, a charming but entirely amoral Nazi officer, and a cynically funny English playwright living in Los Angeles.  He is one of the most enjoyable things about this movie, and don't let anyone tell you different.",1210636800,4,2792,5.043478260869565
1692097,3,B000063TOM,"This DVD was well produced and tells the exciting story of Shackleton's fatefull Antarctic expedition very acurately.  However, as a teacher, I must warn that without a lot of careful editing and fast-forwarding, this film is not immediately classroom appropriate.  Definitely pre-watch for parts with language and one gruesome scene involving the amputation of a sailor's toes.  I did show some appropriate scenes to my students and they really enjoyed seeing everything they'd read in Jennifer Armstrong's ""Shipwreck at the Bottom of the World"" acted out on screen.",1202428800,2,567,5.420454545454546
1692098,3,B000063TOM,"Having seen various other versions of Shackletons' expeditions I was surprised that this one portrayed Shackleton as a selfish, shallow womanizer. Perhaps I'm not British enough to find his dalliances amusing or interesting. The ""manly, man's man"" comes across as one incapable of holding any moral high ground and becomes quite oddly subdued when confronted with his very unintimidating wife concerning his unfaithfulness. He seems devoted above all else to self interest. The mighty Shackleton it seems didn't have any real skills for employment.
 His selfishness and pride made him deaf to good counsel, and so he put his trusting crew in mortal danger. He's not a hero, simply a proud man running away from himself while chasing after self gratification, and glory. The stories of Shackelton's explorations are much more interesting than the man this movie makes him out to be. In this version he is not so much a heroic explorer as he is a bumbling survior obssessed with the idea that playing explorer will make him more of real man and give his life meaning.",1201996800,4,1065,4.98314606741573

1692101,5,B000063TOM,"I purchased this DVD series because I am going on a cruise to Antarctica, and I have long been aware of Ernest Shackleton and the men of the Endurance's incredible survival against all odds in the most merciless and unforgiving environments imaginable.  I had tried watching when it was first broadcast, but for some reason, I found it boring and gave up on it.

But what a difference a couple of years make!  This time around I found ""Shackleton"" a fantastic miniseries with the production values of a major motion picture.  Kenneth Brannagh is absolutely spot on in the title role (so what if he can't do a brogue, his English accent is fine).  The supporting cast is excellent with particularly strong performances by the Endurance's sailing master, his loyal lieutenant Frank, and the ship's carpenter.  When you combine the fine performances of Brannagh and the others with the utterly compelling story and the fact most of the scenes really take place at sea amidst genuine icebergs (it was filmed in Greenland), there really isn't much more for which you can ask.

Particular high-points for me were Shackleton angrily pledging to bring everyone of his men back alive (nicely bookended by the scene of him coming to the rescue of his men on Elephant Island) and the eerily beautiful scenes on the Endurance when the ship was frozen in the pack ice during the Antarctic night.

So I would heartily encourage anyone who likes a fantastic but true story against insurmountable odds to buy this miniseries.  After you watch ""Shackleton,"" though, don't forget to get ""the Last Place on Earth,"" which pays proper tribute to a different kind of great explorer, Roald Amundsen, the Norwegian who got first to the South Pole while his British competitor Robert Falcon Scott (unlike Shackleton in just about every possible way) got himself and his entire team of men killed to come in second place.",1189987200,3,1895,4.878504672897196

The attention to detail, down to the exact diary notations, as well as the actors selected to play the roles,(they look remarkedly like the actual people!), and Branagh transforming himself into Shackleton,.. well this is a must have for any 'Shackeys' out there!! When Shackleton left for this expedition, his finances were in ruin, his affair with his mistress had been exposed to his wife, he was having episodes of angina, which he covered up as 'sciatica,' and he was dealing with his brother just getting out of prison.  Given all these stressors, it is amazing that he rose to the challenge that he did, and makes the story all the more amazing!! Pay careful attention to the scene in the ship where the men are listening to the gramaphone..the recording is actually Shackleton's own voice from his Nimrod expedition!!",1178668800,2,944,4.791411042944786
1692145,4,B000063TOM,"I have been fascinated with this story since I was in the third grade, which is nearly fifty years ago now. This is an excellent depiction of the situation and Shackelton's men, but of course the hardest job falls to Kenneth Brannagh to evoke Shackleton's remarkable personality. While he does a good job in most respects, we mostly see a grim Sir Ernest for almost the entire movie, not glimpsing his renowned good humor and optimism until nearly the end. It was this singular characteristic which so captivated and energized those who followed him through thick & thin. What we see here is mostly a commanding leader, which Shackleton certainly was, but on screen here we do not see the qualities which seem to have set him apart from most other leaders.

If you read the accounts of those who were with him (Frank Worsley, the Captain, for instance wrote several books about this journey) you get a much, much different picture of the man than is portrayed here.

Perhaps it is not possible to portray such a thing, as the intangible elements Shackleton possessed are not so easily shown on film.

But it is a very worthwhile film in all respects, incredible hard work so obviously going into it by all concerned.

This is an especially good film to watch if you have read some good books about what happened with these men.",1177545600,2,1327,4.6581196581196584
1692146,5,B000063TOM,"Several years ago a friend loaned me his copy of the Shackleton expedition.  It had about 20 pages of the most incredible photographs along with a narative that held me captive till the last page, even though I knew the ending by reading the preface.  I reccommend the book and/or DVD to everyone I know, and it is the next book my book club will read.

It is the true story of an expediton to the South Pole as World War I was breaking out in Europe.  The things I remember most vividly are the courage of the crew under unbelievable conditions, and the fact that 150 incredible glass slide photographs survived along with the crew.

Since I only have basic cable TV service, I never saw this film on A&E, or any of the extras on disk 3.  It was a real treat to watch a recreation of what my mind visualized while I read Alfred Lansing's book.  Of course, as with any film adaptation, some things are left out, which is why I reccommend the book also.  The movie starts out a little slow, as Shackleton begs funding for the expedition.  Don't give up; it gets better!  The movie was extremely well done and captures the intensity and personalities of the characters in a way the book cannot.  It is definitely worth adding to your permenent DVD collection.

Don't ignore the extras on disk 3.  There is some great history of other Antarctic expeditions and - my favorite - a piece about the making of this film.  I found it as interesting as the film itself, as the filmmakers, actors and crew faced their own weather and climate challenges to create this incredible film.

This is a keeper, redeeming, worthwhile.  You will remember it for a long, long time.  How many other movies or books can you say that about?",1175385600,3,1716,4.448717948717949

1692150,3,B000063TOM,"This was not a great film.  From the opening credit sequence to the ending miraculous shots, the film follows the obvious route of ""made-for-TV"" without cutting corners or taking shortcuts.  For a little over three hours we watch as we are guided by Branagh and his group of unknowns through different sound stages, outdoor shots full of graininess, and classic wind machines put to great use.  The story is weak, the acting was not a necessity for those producers at A&E, and outside of Shackleton, there is no defined voice of our other characters.  Again, this not was a great film.  Yet, somehow, I found myself glued, wide awake, and attentive through the entire adventure.  Perhaps it was due to the fact that I knew nothing, prior to this film, about the man Earnest Shackleton or about his ill-fated expedition.  Perhaps it was more the excitement of watching man versus Mother Nature or even seeing a new place that I had only seen on maps or other television program.  I don't know what it was, but Shackleton kept me glued to my TV screen.  There was no reason for me to enjoy this film, but alas, I did.  Not due to the acting, not the story, and definitely not the visuals, but mainly due to the historical element.  I enjoyed watching, as morbid as this sounds, how painful and uncontrollable Mother Nature can be and how it combats the strength of men.  This impressed me more than anything that escaped Branagh's mouth did.

To begin, this was a difficult film to watch.  After seeing Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou several times, I had trouble separating Bill Murray the explorer and Kenneth Branagh the explore, which are two completely different characters.  Maybe I watched in hopes that Willem Dafoe would arrive to bring some humor to this crew, but alas, it never happened.  Nonetheless, Branagh did a decent job as the hard-nosed Brit that felt more desire to save his crew than finish the expedition.  Oddly enough, Branagh is one of the only actors that can steal three-plus hours of my life and I really don't mind.  Other actors, I have some trouble with, but Branagh seems to deliver, even at his worst, a character that is easy on the eyes.  Shackleton was not his best, but I followed him because I was compelled to see where he would take me.  Is that a sign of a good actor or a good director?  I don't know because I wasn't happy with the direction that Charles Sturridge took during this adventure.  For the first hour-plus we are privy to brief moments of Shackleton's private life and his ability to sell his dreams, but that is not what this film is all about.  This film is about the dangers and dedication that these men had to staying alive.  I would have wished that Sturridge had dedicated more time towards the perils and less towards the underdevelopment of the characters.  Sturridge placed so much emphasis on the characters, that by the end of the film you didn't really know any of them except for Shackleton, yet we needed more development to heighten the emotion at the end.  Branagh brought himself decently to the screen, but it is in my opinion that Sturridge did not craft together a strong enough story.

This viewer also had trouble with the overall British environment that Sturridge created.  I realize that Shackleton was a British man, but in this film it felt as if he glazed it on rather heavily.  Whenever there was trouble for these men, you could undoubtedly expect our characters to yell ""bloody"" about something.  While it was fun at first, I just felt like Sturridge was pushing it in my face.  Maybe it wasn't such a big deal, but I seemed to notice it quite a bit more as the temperature continued to drop.  Coupled with the language was the poor set design.  I shouldn't say poor, but rather inconsistent.  In the beginning, there was some excitement ""traveling"" to these different wealthy homes (which were the same but with different items inside), but when we got to the Antarctic, there wasn't much to speak about.  I felt as if we were walking over the same sets over and over again, but just moving the iceberg in a different location.  The funniest and most deplorable moment, was when Shackleton and his small crew fought the storm on the sea.  I couldn't tell what was happening, but thanks to the graininess, I didn't have to.  E-gad, I thought A&E had more money than this!

Overall, I cannot harshly critique this film because I did watch all three hours of it without a single flinch of sleep, but I cannot give credit to the acting, the characters, the direction, the set design, or the story.  What I loved about this film was the human element.  The power of endurance, which ironically was the name of his sinking boat (symbolism ... oh, I think so!), kept me captured to the screen.  I would not recommend this film to friends because of the lengthiness to get to the finale (it is almost like going on your own Shackleton adventure), but I cannot knock it.  If you can get past the poor production value of this film and see the power of the historical and Mother Nature element, than I think you will like it.  For me, I must go watch Life Aquatic one more time to get a true ""explorer"" spirit into my mind!

1692162,5,B000063TOM,"Truth be told, you get what the title states and much more.  Schackleton is an amazing true saga of romanticism, heroism and perseverance.  The tale brings you back to the age of the explorers and to the quest to conquer the last unattained territory of terra firma, the south pole.  Only the quest for the moon would rival such a saga, though I'm not convinced that space exploration would match the true grit of the south pole explorers.  Survival in such extremes for months, even years, with even today's technological advances would stretch the bounds of human endurance.

While the 2-DVD movie is rather long, it is filled with remarkable detail, superb acting and the bitterly eerie, yet compelling scenery of frozen Antarctica (actually filmed in Greenland).  The bonus DVD adds the plus.  While the Schackleton mission is by far the greatest tale of the south pole exploration, the race to be first is an adventure itself.  The challenge to be the first to the south pole pits Robert Scott, Raold Amundsen and Ernest Schackleton against each other.  Only one will be the first.  Each man is a leader in their own right, yet they vastly differ in style, strategy and decision making ability.  Some choose wisely.  Some face the peril of their miscalculations.

1692167,5,B000063TOM,"Shackleton is a strong candidate for Kenneth Branagh's top performance as an actor so far. Which should tell you something about the film's watchability right there. The Conspiracy movie was another acting masterclass, with Sir Branagh playing the role of Nazi top dog (Heidrich) with a smooth, efficient  politeness, commonly associated with board level executives. But this is even better.
Although the Branagh's presence is one of the film's main draws, the whole production is BBC-flagship, top-of-the-line all the way. Pornography for Merchant Ivory fans. It was director Charles Sturridge, let us not forget, who guided us through the wonder that was Brideshead Revisited (1983), the benchmark against which all other costume dramas - this one included - will be matched.
Shackleton is set in 1911, at a time when polar exploration was at its most intense (with bitter rivalries, shameless falsification of logbooks, etc.), etc. This is the stuff of all boy's books in Britain throughout the most of the 20th century (fans of Michael Palin's excellent Ripping Yarns series will know what I'm talking about).  Along with Raoul Amundsen, Sir Walter Scott, Shackleton was a major player in this area, with a brace of successful arctic and Antarctic expeditions already under his belt. But this expedition was going to be the big one. Crossing the Antarctic. Unfortunately some bright spark decided to start World War One, casting into jeopardy the undertaking that was going to satisfy Sir Earnest Shackleton's vainglorious designs for ever.
It's a fabulous film. Well-researched, superbly written, meticulously crafted, heartwarmingly acted and highly dramatic filmmaking; connoiseur cinema that also caters to history students, Branagh fans and wide-screen adventure-lovers.

After talking through the facts about the expedition, we were able to see how actors in a movie did it, and that was valuable for my son.  I agree with other reviewers' comments that this looked like a TV movie and that the ending was rushed; moreover, important details of the expedition's ordeal were left out to show scenes in London that were meant to be ironic.  Scenes you'll probably want to skip for little ones:  the shooting of the ship's cat and the expedition's dogs, and most especially the (rather drawn-out) toe amputation scene.  All in all, though, a good learning experience.",1100649600,11,774,4.703703703703703
1692170,3,B000063TOM,"Where is David Lean when we need him?  This dramatized version of the ill-fated Shackleton Expedition comes off as exactly what it is -- a high budget television movie. Here the fate of the Shackleton and his men is never in doubt, thanks to a stirring score, cardboard characters, and a script that rarely, if ever, frightens or surprises. Although it attempts to tell the story in grand fashion, and does it with an admirable attention to realism and detail, and with some grand special effects, the film itself is remarkably boring to watch.  All the drama inherent in the survival of Shackleton and his crew is absent from Charles Sturridges' plodding script, which seems more intent to sketch the story's outlines than to really paint a serious psychological portrait of one of history's great leaders and create the emotion that one of the great survival stories of all time should engender.  If you are interested in that type of insight, a much more satisfying film is the documentary produced a couple years back about the same topic, which is not only breathtaking and achingly dramatic, but completely rewarding.  That is a lot more than I can say for this mediocre portrayal.  (The one saving grace of the DVD set is that it does come with a bonus disc, which contains some interesting films about the history of exploration in Antarctica.)

P.S.: As for that David Lean adaptation of this story that we'll never get to see...  Can you imagine it?  It must start with the real life death of Earnest Shackleton.  After surviving against all odds, he regrouped and raised money for one last expedition.  But, just as he entered arctic waters, Shackleton died of a heart attack.  Such a poetic and fitting end for a man whose greatest accomplishment came out of his greatest failure. Can you see it?  Just like in Dr. Zhivago, as Shackleton falls to the deck of his ship we flash back to the beginnings of his amazing life...  Ah, now that's a movie I'd like to see.",1099612800,5,1975,4.7063953488372094
1692171,4,B000063TOM,"I got turned on to polar exploration by the book and TV miniseries ""The Last Place on Earth"" by Roland Huntford which deals with the race between Amundsen and Scott to the South Pole, and seeing as how Huntford was an adviser for this program as well, I had great hopes.  I must say I was somewhat disappointed by how this one came out.  First off, let me say that it is still worth watching and the extras that come with the DVD are quite interesting.  However, I feel that too much time is spent on things not relevant to the actual story of the ""Endurance"" expedition, such as Shackleton's relationship with his problematic brother Frank.  Once they get on the Endurance and head towards the Antarctic ice, it gets better, but still, the true measure of Shackleton's genius for leadership is not really brought out.  For example, there was a major difference of opinion between Shackleton and his officer from the Royal Marines, Orde-Lees, regarding stocking up on seal meat.  Orde-Lees felt they should be cautious and kill as many seals as possible to put in a good store in case the seals should disappear or they should be stranded longer than expected.  Shackleton strongly opposed doing this because it would signal to the men that he didn't really think they would be able to get away in any reasonable time.  This was not mentioned at all but is crucial to the story.  We are shown one particularly dangerous incident of insubordination by the carpenter, MacNeish, who was pacified by Shackelton and was later absolutely vital to their rescue since he fitted out the open-boat James Caird, travelled in it to South Georgia Island and kept it afloat, yet we are not told that after they were rescued, Shackleton insisted that he NOT be awarded the Polar Medal, because Shackleton never forgave him for his earlier outburst, no matter how important and cooperative he was to him afterwards.  I was particularly disappointed that almost nothing was shown about the open-boat journey from Elephant Island to South Georgia, a distance of over

800 miles over the stormiest oceans on Earth.  We do see them attempting to make sun sightings in order to determine their position, and we do see huge waves crash over the boat, but the immense difficulties of this amazing journey are surprisingly NOT described, for example the need to get a very accurate fix on the sun's position on a violently pitching boat, through frequently cloudy skies.  If the position was not determined accurately enough, they could miss South Georgia, which is a small island, and end up in the middle of ocean while their food and water ran out.  Captain Worsley's genius in knowing how and to where to steer the boat is not mentioned at all.

Finally, the difficulties of the men left behind on Elephant Island are not mentioned other than the operation performed to remove one man's frost-bitten toes.  Shackleton said he expected to return to them within one month but it took over four months,

but we are not really told of how the men there coped or all the immense difficulties Shackleton had in returning to them.

""The Last Place on Earth"" went into great detail explaining the differences in leadership between Amundsen and Scott and why the former was successful whereas the later died returning from the South Pole, but no comparable character study of Shackleton is presented here to show how he was able to overcome the immense odds against him and how he was able to avoid what happened to his bitter rival Scott, in spite of sharing many typical ""British"" attitudes that hampered their Polar parties as opposed to the more flexible Norweigians like Amundsen.

Having said this, this DVD is still worth seeing since the story

of the Endurance is so compelling.",1094947200,8,3758,4.787925696594427
1692172,5,B000063TOM,"I watched the IMAX version before this and although thoroughly enjoyed it, agree with others that the IMAX version is a bit too short. I then watched the 3 DVD collector's set and sat riveted to my seat for almost 5 hours watching both the film and the history of Antarctic Exploration extras. So, if you want the IMAX version, which is short and sort of sweet to the point, then here it is. On the other hand, if you want to really get a feel for the whole adventure and become part of it, then get the 3 DVD box set. I will watch both again and again. Just an unbelievable story whichever version you watch and for a such an unbelievably cheap price. Just the history of Antarctic Exploration at 100 minutes would have been worth the price, so absolutely no regrets whatsoever.",1075248000,6,779,4.379310344827586
1692173,4,B000063TOM,"I thoroughly appreciated the documentary about polar exploration which is pretty much worth the cost of the DVD set by itself.

A great value for those who are seeking an educational experience more than entertainment.",1074988800,2,411,5.014705882352941
1692174,5,B000063TOM,"When I first read of the incredible story of Shackleton's Endurance expedition--almost two years stranded in the Antarctic and yet all men lived to tell the tale--I thought it would make a wonderful film but couldn't imagine how a filmed version would live up to what was in my mind's eye.

I was gratified to find ""Shackleton"" (the movie) to be one of the greatest adventure movies I'd ever seen.  Kenneth Branagh is perfectly cast as Sir Ernest Shackleton, the slightly full-of-himself but heroic leader of the expedition.  The entire thing was filmed, quite realistically, in Greenland, which looks stunning.

I was particularly impressed at how closely the cinematography matches the well-known photographs taken by the actual expedition photographer, Frank Hurley.  Some shots in the film are essentially identical to Hurley's photos, adding to the film's realism. (If you'd like a good look at the original photos, I recommend Caroline Alexander's ""Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antartic Expedition,"" which contains great reproductions of them.)  It's true that it takes the entire first half of the film for the expedition to get underway and then stranded, but even this lengthy non-Antarctic segment is reasonably well done.

On top of the inherent drama in the story and the excellent production, the DVD carries an entire volume of worthy extras:  a 2-hour history of the Antarctic, a segment from A&E ""biography"" on Shackleton, and a ""making of"" video as well.

Enough to keep exploration fans--or anyone interested in great adventures--happy for hours and hours!",1057536000,10,1579,5.309236947791165

I saw the biography on the real man and I was really impressed on how accurate the movie was to the real expedition that Ernest Shackleton took in 1914.  I shouldn't be surprised though for the star of the film has always been associated with great productions.  I have long been an admirer of Kenneth Branagh, whether he does Shakespearean drama or modern film, he never disappoints.  This film was certainly no expection, his performance was worthy of an Emmy as were all the performances.  While watching this film I was filled with excitement and anticipation of what would happen next, not to mention COLD!!  even though I was safe in my living room.  I can't recommend any Branagh movie high enough being an avid admirer of his work, but this movie is truly spectacular and rates 10 stars, not just five ones.",1019347200,24,996,4.5307262569832405
