1340705,3,B00004CMAZ,"These were the last words spoken by an officer to his men before their execution by a German firing-squad...

Trevor Howard was a devoted officer and a gentleman, never afraid to give his life for his country... Howard was a great character actor with a big presence on the screen in many good films as ""Mutiny On the Bounty,"" ""Ryan Daughter,"" and ""Gandhi.""

The motion picture deals with the silly mission of ten British Royal Marines, who after embarking a submarine from the English Channel port of Portsmouth traveled by flimsy canoe into Bordeaux harbor, southern France on the Garonne River, blowing enemy ships by attach limpet-mines..

Directed and starred by Jose Ferrer (1909-92) star of ""Cyrano De Bergerac"" and ""Moulin Rouge,"" and photographed in CinemaScope and Technicolor, the film succeeds in reflecting the brave deed of the English Commando and is somewhat exciting and tense in its depiction of the hazardous journey into enemy territory in World War II...",1166832000,,975,5.08125
1340706,4,B00004CMAZ,"If you enjoy combat movies around ships and dockyards, this one is for you. The suspense is clear. A daring commando attack on German ships in port is planned and begun. The Germans then inadvertently come across, and pick up, two British commandos, and so the element of surprise has been lost. Furthermore, a British commando on a kayak is spotted by a German sentry, who opens fire, and thereby further alerts the Germans. The British commandos must dodge German guards, many of them in patrol boats, as they attempt to approach the German ships and attach the explosives. What's more, the Germans are under orders to capture the British commandos alive.",1369612800,,657,4.875
1340707,4,B00004CMAZ,"The story told in this film was inspired by Operation ""Franton"", an incredibly daring raid by Royal Marines against German blockade runners anchored in Bordeaux in December 1942. Those ships were large and fast transports travelling (frequently under false flags) from France to Japan and back, carrying sophisticated industrial tools and optic and electronic equipments to the Japanese and bringing back supplies for Nazi war effort, mostly rubber, tin, tungstene and rare metals, precious even in limited amounts.

This was a unique operation, during which the Marines were brought by a submarine to the mouth of Gironde estuary and then they had to travel by canoes to Bordeau and then attack German ships with limpet mines. Paddling up the Gironde would take four nights (commandos had to hide during the day), and therefore the whole operation lasted from 7 to 11 December. After the attack the Marines were to scuttle the canoes and travel by foot to meet with French Resistance agents, who would help them escape to neutral Spain.

In ""Cockleshell Heroes"" the story is however a little bit amended. Names of the Royal Marines were changed and their characters were completely rewritten to make this film more interesting - and in some parts also more amusing. The key elements of the real story were respected - the operation takes place in December 1942, the target are indeed German blockade-runners in Bordeaux and the final results of the raid are the same in the film as in the real story. There were however may elements added, especially during the raid itself, to make the story more dramatic.

The description of the selection of participants, their training and other preparations were also amended, but mostly by the inclusion of some of the real practices used to select and train British commandos and secret agents during World War II. Although there is no shortage of tragedy in this film (especially during the raid itself), some elements during the training are absolutely HILARIOUS!

Jose Ferrer, who also directed this film, is excellent as the commander of the raid, but it is Trevor Howard who steals the show, as a bitter, somehow aged Royal Marines captain who was promoted only once in his long career and spend the last 20 years affected only to administrative jobs... Christopher Lee plays a little role in this film, as the commander of the British submarine HMS ""Tuna"".

This film is not as good as ""Dambusters"" or ""Above us the waves"", but still I watched it with pleasure. Some comic elements included during the training can seem strange in a war movie, but I rather enjoyed them. The main reason for taking away one star is that this film lacks the tension and the nail-biting suspense which were so present in the two films mentioned earlier - and also because some elements added to the raid itself were a little bit exaggerated and poorly executed. Still, it is a film worth watching for all war movies amateurs. Enjoy!",1359331200,3,2961,4.902195608782435

1340710,5,B00004CMAZ,"This is a region 2 dvd and is action packed.
It is a true story about a raid on NAZI ships
in Bordeoux using 2 man canoes. Jose Ferer is
the oficer that proposed the raid and his 2nd
in comand is Trevor Howard who helps shape the
comandos into a finely tuned unit. They pull
the raid off at a loss of most of them.
This is story telling at it's best.",1335139200,,350,3.808219178082192
1340711,5,B00004CMAZ,"The Cockleshell Heroes, 1956 film

The Royal Marines were given the job of attacking ships in the Bordeaux harbor. Airplanes could not be used for bombing because of the dangers to civilians. The plan was to use canoes bor a stealthy night time attack on the harbored ships. The Major plans a difficult test to weed out the under qualified. The volunteers will be dressed in enemy uniforms and dropped 350 miles away, they must return to base in 48 hours. We see how they try. [Some humor here.] Only eight came through; they can think for themselves. There is a conflict between the Major and the Captain. The Captain explains the failure of the infiltration test. The training will be done over to correct the mistakes. The team climbs up a vertical wall using ropes, then descends the same way. They paddle their canoes into the sea. They handle limpet mines for practice. The schedule is set.

The Royal Marines celebrate the end of their training at a bar. One man takes a short leave for a situation not uncommon in wartime. ""Very quiet"" says the constable. The operation begins, they will be landed on the coast of France. An enemy destroyer drops depth charges against their submarine. Captain Thompson volunteers to replace an injured man. They paddle to the shore to avoid the mine fields. One boat upsets, the men are captured. Will they talk? The others hide by day. A dog runs by, will they be discovered? They reach the harbor and paddle through the entrance. A sentry fires a warning shot. The enemy searches for them in daylight and at night. Another crew is discovered and shot. The search intensifies. The volunteers place the limpet mines on the ships, all timed to go off at the same time. Another crew is discovered and captured; they won't talk either. The captured Royal Marines are shot as saboteurs.""Keep the line straight, boys"" is Captains Thompson's last order. But the explosions on the ships tell of a successful mission.

This is a good story but the pacing seems off. It was adapted from a book that told the history of this operation. Would the bombing of targets be avoided in the future because of collateral damage?",1331078400,,2151,4.70026525198939
1340712,5,B00004CMAZ,"I saw this movie on television years ago and would love to own it.  I especially love the scene in which one of the men is ""ordered"" by his superior officer to take care of business at home after catching his wife with another man, and how the officer stands by and tells a policeman that all is well despite the racket going on inside of the home.

7920365,3,B00004CMAZ,"The true story portrayed could form the basis of a very compelling film, but this is not that film. The tale of 12 commandos who trained to blow up enemy battleships in Bordeaux, using canoes to make their way in the final stages, is legendary in the Royal Marines. Only 2 made it back alive. The film is an uneasy mix of comedy and error in the first half (almost Dad's Army-like in its approach to the material), with a troop of British acting stalwarts from the 1950s, led by actor/director Jose Ferrer sporting an English accent that wanders from time to time. The resolutely upbeat ending seems corny today, but not in its time, I suspect.
The film is chiefly notable for the first use of Cinemascope in a British film, and the clarity of the colour location images of Eastney Barracks and Portsmouth Harbour make for a strong visual presentation, and fans of steam locomotives of that era can entertain themselves trying to spot locations in the early scenes.",1435104000,,965,4.649122807017544

7920372,1,B00004CMAZ,Horrid little film!  Absolutely no pretension to anything historical.  Even the Germans are using Lee-Enfield No. 4's in a couple of scenes.  Mel Ferrer is miscast and as wooden as John Wayne.  Read a book on the subject; don't waste your money on this tripe.  It is for those looking for cheap entertainment and do not discriminate as to what they watch.  I would rather view a dubbed Hercules movie.,1372032000,,401,4.6571428571428575
