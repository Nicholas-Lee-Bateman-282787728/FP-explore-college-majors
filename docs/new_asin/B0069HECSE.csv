4980498,5,B0069HECSE,Great video... my baby loves it and keeps him entertained for a few minutes so that I can get dinner made! :),1374624000,,109,4.0
4980499,4,B0069HECSE,"Before purchasing this, I only had the older set of Baby Einstein DVD's from 2004.  What a difference!  I immediately noticed the better production quality.  I do wish that it had more of the ""puppet shows,"" but other than that, I'm happy with it, and so is my toddler.",1372809600,,269,4.448979591836735
4980500,5,B0069HECSE,"My 22mo old grandson loves the Baby Einstein series. He sometimes sits quietly and just watches and listens to the dvd's.
I have found the dvd's to be a wonderful teaching tool and I like the ""quite time"" enviornment it provides us to talk about the animals.
During some parts of the dvd, he and grandma can dance. So it's fun for both of us.",1372032000,,342,4.276923076923077
4980501,5,B0069HECSE,My 4 month old hated riding in the car until we started playing this DVD. He loves it and it is teaching him things which I love.,1370649600,,129,3.814814814814815
4980502,5,B0069HECSE,Baby Einstein DVD's are so cute.  Both my sons love everything about them; from the music to all the colorful pictures.  I recommend these to all parents!  It is educational and can capture the attention of any little one!,1369699200,,222,4.641025641025641
4980503,2,B0069HECSE,This is the first one of baby einsteins I've ever seen and so not impressed. Seems very outdated and a little slow paced.,1368057600,,121,4.304347826086956
4980504,5,B0069HECSE,I ordered this video because we were having our second child and knew that my older baby would need something to occupy her while I nursed her brother!  It was perfect and she LOVES them!!!,1366934400,,189,4.4
4980505,5,B0069HECSE,"My 13 month-old son LOVES the Baby Einstein videos and this is no exception!  I've been hesitant to allow my son to watch tv as I've heard it's bad for children under 2.  My son got this as a gift for his first birthday, however, so we gave it a try.  He hasn't stopped watching it since and we've gone on to buy more of these videos.  It has great graphics and really nice music.  My husband and I are scuba divers so it's fun for our son to see the animals that we see while diving.  This is educational and entertaining and a must buy for parents.",1364515200,2,550,4.046296296296297
4980506,4,B0069HECSE,"Unlike the first Baby Einstein's that came out, this series doesn't have the repeat option on the menu.  That is very disappointing.  And for that reason, we will not buy any more DVDs in this new Einstein series.  Other than that, I was happy to see that they did not use all of the same material that was used in Baby Neptune.  The music is ALL the same.  But the clips are new.  Of course, there were about a dozen short clips that I recognized from Baby Neptune.  But definitely the chunk of the video was new material (unlike ""World of Words"", which was almost an entire repeat of ""Baby Shakespeare"").  Hope this helps.",1341014400,5,624,4.412280701754386
4980507,5,B0069HECSE,"Every time my Grandson comes to visit out of all the DVD's (and there are many) he always asks to watch Neptune's Ocean first!  Not only is it educational, but it's done in a way that he absolutely loves.  The reef is so colorful and all the different species of fish are amazing!  I am so glad I purchased this for him.  I know he will never get tired of watching it, and better yet, I enjoy watching it as well with him!",1335225600,2,422,4.048192771084337

4980515,5,B0069HECSE,Baby Einstein videos are excellent for your kids!! Just make sure you get the age appropriate ones. I had to buy more because the first ones we got were way above my sons learning level.,1390780800,,186,4.3428571428571425
