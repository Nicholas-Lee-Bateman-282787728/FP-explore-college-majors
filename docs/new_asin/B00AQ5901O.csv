5468015,2,B00AQ5901O,"I ordered this thinking it was a collection of Avery's vintage cartoons, and was unaware that this was a fairly recent ret-con redo of some classic Avery characters.
Childish and lacking the edge of the real thing.  Had I known what this was-- my own fault for not researching further, I would have never ordered it.",1373328000,63,316,4.642857142857143
5468016,1,B00AQ5901O,"I was severely disappointed with this ""bait and switch"" collection, which has nothing to do with Tex Avery except for using his name and doing limp imitations of his work that try, and fail, to deliver on the promise of the title.

Avoid.",1364083200,52,238,4.534883720930233
5468017,5,B00AQ5901O,"The Tex Avery cartoons have a wonderfully mad sense of humor, I reccomend viewing them for a great laugh from mid 20th century.",1362355200,,127,4.565217391304348
5468018,1,B00AQ5901O,"I made the mistake of thinking these were the cartoons of the 40's and 50's; - the works of Tex Avery.  Not a new set of cartoons with a character named 'Tex Avery'.  When did these Ren and Stimpy looking things come out? I must admit, my fault I guess, but this is not at all what I wanted.  When they're going to put out the real MGM Tex Avery cartoons is a mystery to me.  Those were what I was looking for.  Blah, yuk,...bad taste still in my mouth from what I discovered upon putting these on!

Make sure you don't make a knee jerk decision like I did.  Yes, my fault, but a bit misleading.  I have no interest in this particular collection what so ever.  My four year old turning away from it sealed the deal.",1362355200,117,715,4.086330935251799
5468019,5,B00AQ5901O,"Animation aficionados can recognize and will enjoy the comedic and crazy antics of Frederick ""Tex"" Avery. With the outlandish expressions and suggestive humor involved in original classics, ""The Wacky World of Tex Avery"" is a brand-new series involving a tribute to the real Tex himself and all that he's done.

""The Wacky World of Tex Avery: Volume 1"" has 40 frenetic episodes on 4 discs starring original characters in madcap misadventures. Here's the who's who and what's what:

""Tex Avery"" - He's a rootin' tootin' cowpoke with a surprisingly coincidental name. He keeps the Wild West safe from harm as he goes up against his nemesis Sagebrush Sid whether they're fighting for their claim of land or for the love of the beautiful Miss Chastity.
""Pompeii Pete"" - The Roman Empire didn't seem to fall on this little centurion, or maybe it did - on his head ! Either way, you'll find this Italian-fluent fellow taking the role of all kinds of various occupations while testing the mettle of a guy named Dan.
""Power Pooch"" - This caped canine crusader gets his super powers by gnawing on a magical shoe. Along with his sidekick Little Buddy, P.P. fights fiendish fiends like Dr. Hydrant and saves the day in the end. We hope.
""Genghis and Khannie"" - Mighty Genghis is a conqueror who goes out into the world and attempts to take a new land for his almighty emperor while the adorable Khannie is a tiny tot who always seems to get in the way of Genghis and his conquering.
""Maurice and Mooch"" - Maurice Squab is a happy-go-lucky young fowl while Mooch is an ever-hungry fox who persistently tries to capture and eat poor Maurice no matter how ridiculous his schemes are.
""Freddie the Fly"" - Amanda Banshee is a filthy-rich lady who has a mansion and numerous butlers. She'd live her high life better if it weren't for a pesky vagabond fly named Freddie !
""Einstone"" - He's the intelligent caveman who's always inventing something practical for living in the Stone Age better or getting his fellow cave people out of trouble.

So this DVD volume is pretty much worth your time and interest and the hilarity ensuing in each and every episode is worth it at least until the next volume. Personally, I'd like to see a special DVD collection of classics by the original Tex Avery (besides the ""Droopy"" collection), but that's just me.",1361318400,6,2328,4.714987714987715

5468039,1,B00AQ5901O,"It can be argued that ""Tex Avery"" is an Averyesque character.  It can be argued that Cowboy ""Tex Avery"" is an homage to animator ""Tex"" Avery.  It can be argued that this series is a largely unrelated creation in and of itself, and should be appreciated as such.

However, from the description given, ""Brilliant, hilarious and groundbreaking animator Tex Avery created the wonderful squash-and stretch cartoons of his era. Avery added speed, sarcasm, irony and nonstop action to The Golden Age of Hollywood animation!"" any logical person would have to agree that the marketing for this DVD is, at best, disingenuous.

No Bugs Bunny, no Daffy Duck, no Droopy, no Porky Pig, no Chilly Willy, no kittenish Little Red, no hot-to-trot Big Bad Wolf, no Merrie Melodies, no Looney Tunes.  Don't waste your money on it if animation actually involving ""Tex"" Avery is what you want.",1409788800,25,871,4.938356164383562

5468042,5,B00AQ5901O,What was I thinking? Cartoons from years ago are pretty crazy and yet to be enjoyed. There are some crazy things on this DVD,1398643200,,124,4.208333333333333
5468043,1,B00AQ5901O,Buyer Beware! These are not the vintage Tex Avery cartoons one would hope to receive. These are new cartoons that are ridiculous and unworthy of being compared to the genius of Tex Avery. I skipped through and looked at portions of each cartoon only to eventually toss this lot of rubbish in with the trash. Back in school this would have received an F for plagiarism!,1395273600,73,368,4.590909090909091

5468046,5,B00AQ5901O,"For a very cheap price, there are some pretty irreverent shorts in this set, the kind of humor suited more for adults, in some cases. I still wish Rockabye Bear came out on DVD or blu-ray, though. It's his best.",1385078400,,211,4.3
5468047,5,B00AQ5901O,"I grew up watching these hilarious misadventures on TV. Can't understand why they've gone away with these cartoons in which the whole family could enjoy to these lousy Japanese action ones. My fondest memories are of these kinds of cartoons, and still love them to this day. If you want hilarious stories with funny cartoon characters that you and your kids can enjoy, then I highly recommend ""The Wacky World of Tex Avery""!",1383609600,,424,4.821917808219178
