7832614,3,6302973627,"The ultimate problem, though it's better than some VHS's in this category, runs through all levels of production. The music basically doesn't change and is dubbed over with ""Dr. Devious'"" message, which really messes up the overall effect, imo. There are repeated graphical scenes of people that only make sense with the volume up, making this video messed up by that when playing to your own music choice. Some of the scenes go on a bit too long or are too brief, mostly lacking enough color changes or have too many ""objects"" over the color changes. One scene, in particular, of a blue man running, is really tiresome. If you were born in the 60's-70's and got lost in ""Spirograph"", this video will leave you looking for another.",1004313600,2,731,4.71875
