2463751,5,B000CFYAMC,"This is a movie with heart.  A close-knit group of friends who care about each other is threatened by the change of heart of a woman in the group who can't bring herself to be honest about her feelings.  On the first time through, we have no idea how this dilemma will be resolved.  Second time,, nuances become apparent.  Third time, the  humor is appreciated.  And so on.

This movie has been playing in local theaters for over three years.  Finally we can share the fun with our friends around the country!",1134259200,5,509,4.456521739130435

2463753,2,B000CFYAMC,"Disaster Artist was very entertaining, so I bought this....It was fun for the first half hour or so, but once the novelty wore off, you're left with an incredibly juvenile attempt at a film. Really unwatchable!",1524787200,,210,4.861111111111111
2463754,5,B000CFYAMC,"Got this out of curiosity after watching The Disaster Artist.  This did not disappoint.  Yes, it is more than likely the best worst movie ever made...looking at you Ishtar, better up that game...but worth every penny.  The dialogue make no sense, the movie jumps around from one place to another with no explanation of what's occurring, the ""love"" scenes are completely awkward and I can't imagine how uncomfortable the actors must have been with the eternity of 'kissing' and 'lovemaking' that occurs in these scenes.  Overall, I can see why this movie holds a dear place in a lot of people's heart and I look forward to finding a theater showing the midnight experience so I can experience the glory of this classic in all of it's glory.",1524700800,,739,4.75
2463755,1,B000CFYAMC,"I don't understand the hype.  As a frequent viewer of MST3K and Rifftrax movies I've seen plenty of movies so bad they're good.  This isn't even a good bad movie.  It's just grating with the wooden acting an nearly nonstop misogyny.  If you want a good bad movie, watch the completely incompetent production of Birdemic.",1524614400,,320,4.763636363636364

2463757,5,B000CFYAMC,"The Room is the greatest achievement in modern cinema. Tommy Wiseau is a god damn genius that deserves an Oscar. The academy at least needs to recognize the man with a lifetime achievement award. When our distant ancestors in the future look back at what human kind of our generation accomplished they will discover 2 great accomplishments, the Internet, and The Room. If you haven't yet, buy this movie, tell all your friends, go to a screening, throw some spoons and realize how blessed you are that Tommy Wiseau bestowed us with such a beautiful gift.",1524441600,,554,4.78125

2463759,5,B000CFYAMC,"It's hard to take your eyes off of this amazing document. It's hard to believe that people worked on this and came home every day saying, ""that was OK"" because OMG it is so not OK. The writing. The set design. The acting. The lighting. The continuity. The humanity! Tommy Wiseau is a remarkable talent/energy suck who makes every unbelievable scene even less believable, hulking around like a vaguely European mob hit man with a bad, bad suit. The other actors are all more capable, but nothing can save this pity party/vanity project.

All that said, it's fabulously and unintentionally funny as all get out, with ""unintentional"" being the key. Wiseau's complete lack of self-awareness elevates this dreck into some kind of bizzaro art statement, a parody of storytelling itself. Highly recommended if you're into that sort of thing. My entire family was in hysterics from beginning to end, so I guess we're into that sort of thing.

P.S. - from the ""you can't make this up"" department: the DVD arrived in fine condition. Inside the case was the DVD and a postcard with 1) a photo of Tommy Wiseau on one side and 2) an advertisement for Tommy Wiseau underwear on the other, complete with a sizing guide. I enjoyed that very, very much.",1524096000,,1236,4.744186046511628

2463762,1,B000CFYAMC,"Sometimes bad is good but not in this case. There is something mentally off with the main character/producer/director. This wouldn't even pass in high school film class.

2463763,5,B000CFYAMC,The best bad movie you will ever see! Either you will instantly love the horrible film or you will be mad that a trusted friend or loved one has made you watch this atrocity. Either way I recommend watching the interview with Tommy before you watch the movie for the first time.

2463774,5,B000CFYAMC,"Because of Wiseau's Polish background (along with his sojourn in France), the key to understanding his persona is Poland's romantic literature. Read great poets like Mickiewicz and Slowacki. Joseph Conrad (Korzeniowski), Polish author of Heart of Darkness, summarized it as follows. He said, ""The romantic feeling of reality (...) is a point of view from which the very shadows of life appear endowed with an internal glow."" Poland's great theatrical tradition also had an effect - famous actors like Helena Modjeska who toured the United States extensively and died in Newport Beach, California, in 1909. Or Jerzy Grotowski (1933-99), a theatre innovator widely regarded as a successor to Konstantin Stanislavski, who was the main subject of the movie My Dinner With Andre (1981). The romantic view of reality can best be understood by entering an altered state of consciousness, and that's one reason I think why The Room casts such a hypnotic spell over its audiences.",1522886400,,971,5.230769230769231

It's mesmerizing how bad this film is but it's really what gives the film it's charm. You can tell that Tommy Wiseau was trying to make a good film, but failed so spectacularly, although you can't really fault Wiseau for his efforts. He was certainly passionate about the film he was making but it ended up failing in every conceivable way and even though Tommy intended for the film to be a serious melodrama, it's pure wretchedness has taken on a life of it's own and has made his film and himself now infamous in film history.",1522454400,,670,4.591666666666667

Had seen clips of this on YouTube and thought ""ok, whatever"". I read the Disaster Artist Book, and it explained the reasons for the movie existing which in turn made we know I had to own this. True to Wiseau's shameless selfless promotion, there is a post card inside for his fashion company inside....a great touch! If you are here looking at this, you know why you are here. Buy it! Tommy played the lonnnnggggg game to Hollywood success.  And get the book/audiobook too, it's a fantastic companion!

2463802,1,B000CFYAMC,"I knew going into this that this movie was horrible on an epic level.  I had heard from friends and movie critics (as well as one friend who actually IS a movie critic) just how poor this movie was, but it wasn't until I actually suffered through it myself that I realized exactly how bad.  Let me tell you something, think of the worst porno movie you have ever seen and remove all the sex and hot women. add back in some weird sex scenes including people you would never want to see have sex, and then you're about half-way to understanding this movie.  I gave it 3 stars because I did laugh a lot, but it was laughing AT it and not WITH it.  I feel like in order to get my money's worth out of this, I need to continue to loan it out to other people and tell them how excellent it is and tell them that they have to see the twist at the very end.  By ruining 2 hours of their life, I feel that I might be able to recoup my dignity and money that I wasted on this piece of garbage.  So far, I have loaned this movie to 3 friends, and have lost 2 of those friends out of anger that they had for me after taking my advice to watch this on a first date.  So, to summarize, this movie is awful and only worth a watch if you have a choice between watching The Room or being waterboarded.  At least waterboarding is over in 10-15 minutes.",1520726400,2,1334,3.988721804511278

I cannot stress how unbelievably funny this film is. I had not laughed that hard in years. Maybe Im a bit of a sadist because its obvious that Tommy Wiseau took his film very seriously but I cant help but revel in its incredible madness. Its a train wreck you cant stop watching, perhaps akin to an Ed Wood film. If you're really a huge fan, theres even an order form for Tommy Wiseau underwear.

I tried to watch this three times.  I've never made it through.  The first time was with just subtitles and no sound, and we made it half way.

Once you hear the vocals and sound track.  Well, ... this is the first one star review I have ever given a movie.

2463901,5,B000CFYAMC,"Since watching this movie for the first time, I have struggled with a succinct and fitting description for it. However, recently I think I have found it. This movie can be accurately described as perfectly tone-deaf. Every line, every scene that goes on for slightly too long, every time Tommy does his creepy laugh... they all add up to a truly bizarre and surreal movie, and by the end you will be shaking your head and wiping the tears of joy from your eyes.

I have watched it 3 times so far, and it gets better every time. A great movie to introduce to friends. Turn it into a drinking game, using rules such as, ""Drink every time Denny acts like a creep"" or ""Drink every time Lisa says she doesn't love Johnny anymore.""",1516492800,,725,4.41044776119403

Yes, it is undoubtedly the best worst movie of all-time, and would have been relegated to the dust-bin of history if taken on face value.  The fact that it was produced, directed and lead-acted by a man, Tommy Wisau, who persevered, while exhibiting zero talent in these areas, stands as a testament to the American Dream.  The irony of The Views appeal is that Tommy was a success before he produced the film.  He amassed a fortune against daunting odds, and was able to parlay this affluence to produce his dream outside conventional Hollywood norms.  The best way to appreciate this movie is to watch it once, and then read and/or watch The Disaster Artist.  The book by Tommys best friend, Greg Sestero who starred as one of the main characters, is incredibly insightful as to the motivations of the film.  Overall, The View is at best a middle school perspective of human relationships, but to see professional adult actors carrying this out is a wondrous treat that should not be missed.",1515110400,,1115,4.590909090909091

The thing that struck me  is that Juliette Danielle had one of the most impressive set of mammary glands that I've ever seen in a feature film.  Tommy must have been impressed because he showed them off as early and often as he could.  My wife wasn't moved by Tommy's hind quarters, though.  There was a certain poignancy in Johnny's devotion to Lisa.  The acting had a definite porno style to it.  Plotting reminded me of the kind you would find in a bad Polish soap opera.  Endless shots of the Golden Gate Bridge as though we didn't know flick's setting were a hoot.  I think the film ultimately suffered from overlength  diluting its overall effect.  I cut my teeth on ""Mystery Science Theatre 3000"" and this effort didn't pass the Edward D. Wood smell test.  ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is still tops in my book.

2464042,2,B000CFYAMC,"Possible spoilers.  This is one of those movies that is entertaining, but probably not in the way the filmmaker(s) wanted.  A new movie is coming out soon called The Disaster Artist and features the making of this movie and its star, director, writer and producer Tommy Wiseau.  Frankly I had not heard of it until recently but I got a copy on DVD and gave it a look.

The plot, as it were, involves Johnny (Wiseau) who is some kind of banker (I think) who wears suits about 3 sizes too big.  Wiseau has one of those accents that is hard to place.  It would appear to be part Eastern European with a mix of Cajun.  He sounds and looks as if he has a mouth full of marbles.  Johnny has been with Lisa (Juliette Danielle) for 6 years and is looking forward to getting married soon.  With the film barely underway, the pair engage in a very long love scene in their San Francisco apartment.  But not before an 18 year old Denny (Philip Haldiman) who is like-a-son to Johnny comes in to watch.  Hes in love with Lisa too.  Hes shoed away like a pet dog and our couple get back to business.  Youll see this scene recreated again later in the film using the same footage as near as I could tell.

It turns out that Lisa isn't in love with Johnny anymore much to her mothers (Carolyn Minnott) regret.  Mom likes Johnny and she wants her daughter to marry him regardless of the fact that Lisa now loves Mark (Greg Sestero), Johnnys best friend who also lives in the building.  So does Denny and probably mom since she pops in often for no reason other than to deliver a few lines.

The movie is incoherent in spite of its simplicity.  Characters show up with no explanation or idea of who they are.  We get scenes that just appear out of nowhere.  Probably the best is when Johnny, Denny, Mark and Peter (Kyle Vogt) appear in an alley in tuxedos and start tossing a football around.  Peter is evidently a psychologist and another of Johnnys friends.  Based on the scene, it appears to be the first time theyve ever seen a footballor any ball for that matter.  Its hilarious.

It is no surprise that I didn't know any of the actors and it appears that none have made much of a career since the films release.  The acting is close to horrible by all concerned but Wiseaus script doesnt help.  His performance will have everyone laughing every time he opens his mouth, or enters a room, or just reacts.  Just Wow!  Ive seen many of the classic clunkers including Troll 2, Plan 9 from Outer Space (and most of Ed Woods films), all the Sharknadoes and Showgirls to name a few.  Without question this is the worst Ive ever seen, but damn I had a good time.  See it with as many people as you can.",1512518400,4,2682,4.316633266533066

2464047,5,B000CFYAMC,"Let's be completely honest: The Room is not a good film. In fact, I doubt that anyone, with the likely exception of Tommy Wiseau, is under the impression that it is a good film. But I didn't watch it thinking it was going to be good; I watched it because I found it at the top of a list of the worst films ever made, and it did not disappoint.

Most bad films I've watched are bad because of their dull plots, boring characters, and/or overuse of clichs--they are bad because the people making them settled for mediocrity. The Room successfully avoids the pitfalls of lazy screenwriting, instead falling flat on its face after flying too close to the sun. Thus, what sets The Room apart from other bad films is that there's nothing run-of-the-mill about its badness. Tommy Wiseau obviously had what he thought was a grand vision and possibly the means to implement it, but lacked the skill necessary to turn The Room into anything other than this spectacular failure.

To that end, this is a film we can all relate to. In laughing at every surreal idea Tommy Wiseau committed to film (and high-definition video), we laugh at ourselves. At some point, we have all reached too high; we have all tried too hard; we have all had too much confidence; and we have all been spectacular failures. The Room thus defines a common thread running through all of us; we just don't have $6 million to let our inner Tommy Wiseau make a movie.",1512259200,,1427,4.5271317829457365

If you haven't experienced it yet, I'd advise you attend a screening in some urban environment first perhaps.

I'd advise a sister purchase of Greg Sustero's audiobook version of The Disaster Artist, his first-hand account of the shooting of this movie and his friendship with writer/director/actor Tommy Wiseau that preceded it all.  The ultimate perk of the audiobook as opposed to the printed hardcopy is Greg Sustero's DEAD-ON Tommy Wiseau impression as he recounts their interactions.",1509321600,3,1116,5.219101123595506

2464067,4,B000CFYAMC,"Let me get this straight immediately; THIS IS NOT THE WORST FILM EVER MADE, NOT BY A LONG SHOT.  It is entertaining to an extent; in other words it's never boring but ultimately it just never heats up too much.  It almost initially has a David Lynch feel however David Lynch movies are much more fascinating with many levels to the plot and characters.  Here what you see is what you get; a woman dissatisfied with her marriage and ""in love"" with her best friend's fiancee who just so happens to be incredibly good looking.  Her mother encourages her to keep the marriage going but she insists she's isn't happy with him.  It's like a somewhat twisted soap opera. I won't say the ending however suffice it to say when the movie is done you won't feel like you just watched a great movie and probably won't even think it's very good.  It holds your attention but ultimately goes nowhere.  If there is a message it would be to build happiness from the inside.",1509235200,,957,4.4655172413793105

The thing with this movie is that it isn't a miserable failure on any one axis. Cinematography, script, acting, editing, continuity, lighting, everything at one point or another fails . . . somewhat. It's like it was cut together out of all of the rejected parts of a movie instead of all the good parts.

For any aficionado of the craft, this is a hilarious compilation of what NOT to do when making a film.

2464122,1,B000CFYAMC,"The Room is a romantic drama film written and directed by Tommy Wiseau, staring himself as the character of Johnny. Not too often does a movie reach cult classic status because it is considered be the worst movie of all time. Its terribleness has caught the eyes of millions, including actors James Franco and Seth Rogen, prompting them to produce an autobiography based on the making of this movie called The Disaster Artist. The Room's notoriety is well known on the internet, with memes and quotes littering on YouTube's comment section like ""You're tearing me apart, Lisa,"" ""That's the idea!"" ""Haha, what a story, Mark,"" and the most infamous ""I did not hit her... Oh hi Mark."" For being a bad movie, this film is very quotable. I did not get much humor from the memes before seeing the movie, but after braving through it, I can safely say my life has greatly improved being able to detect The Room references everywhere on the net, which might just be the movie's greatest gift to me.

This movie is every bit as bad as advertised. From a filmmaking perspective, it breaks so many rules that I would need to write a college dissertation in order to cover everything. First off, the acting is extremely bad, I mean on an atrocious level with everybody from top to bottom giving their career worst efforts. The director, Tommy Wiseau is technically the worst of them all, but because he was just so dreadful, along with his ridiculous appearance and thick eastern European accent, it actually made him charming. The other actors however, were worse than Disney Channel Original Movies.

The script is abysmal and character development is non-existent. Everybody in the film does things randomly without rhyme or reasons, and is inconsistent with their objectives and motivation. Lisa, Johnny's girlfriend, cheats on him with his best friend, Mark, citing the reason being the former is ""boring,"" but then in the next scene, Lisa defends Johnny in front of her mother. Mark, the aforementioned friend, constantly states Johnny is his best friend, yet gives in to Lisa's temptations multiple times, each time acting confused on Lisa's advances to lure him in for intercourse. Johnny having found out Lisa is cheating on him, decides to stay with her anyway because she is his ""future wife,"" but then decides to set up a tape recorder to ""record everything"" as a mean to catch her in the act. Why not just break up with her the moment he finds out? How does showing the evidence to anyone else prove anything when he is the only person in the world this information matters to? The writing is complete nonsense.

Throwaway subplots and lot of useless scenes are separated by really long stock footage landscape shots of San Francisco. Wiseau used these shots so liberally he would transition from a room to a shot of the Golden Gate Bridge and then back to the same room again with no passage of time. Many scenes in the movie are without purpose, making me wonder if Wiseau had them in the script or he just decided to shoot whatever he felt like that particular day. What is more peculiar being they contain seemingly vital dialogue that one might believe will pertain later on, but alas that is not the case. Filmmaking 101 dictates if you show a gun in act one, be prepare to use it in act three, except Tommy Wiseau did not get that memo.

Loads of unintentional funniness drowns the movie, but I honestly only laughed out loud at a few of them. The best thing about the movie is being able to enjoy all the references and memes you would encounter on the internet afterwards. The quality of the film really lends itself to be spoofed and parodied, only because Tommy Wiseau actually thought he made a romantic drama masterpiece. For all of our benefits, the joke is on him.

This is a really bad movie that is strangely enjoyable if you choose to go along with its inadvertent humor. I understand how the movie got such a huge following, since it is immensely quotable with lots of infamously iconic moments, but I do not understand how anyone can truly be a ""fan."" It is one thing to enjoy a movie at an ironic level, but another to become a true fan of a truly awful movie. I do not wish to see this twice, but then again, I would not have to because it will forever be paraded on the internet to remind me of its existence.",1503360000,,4333,4.6220779220779225

Also, be warned, the R rating for ""sexuality"" along with language and violence misleadingly fails to mention blatant nudity among the at least six awkward sexual encounters. If that kind of thing matters to you and yours, the normal ""sexuality"" meaning in ratings does not apply.

2464189,5,B000CFYAMC,"Let me be clear, The Room was not intended to be an easy watch. However, if you are able to understand the complex plot, it is easy to understand the hype surrounding the movie. The Room is a masterclass in subtlety.

The Room stars Carolyn Minnott, who plays Claudette, an elderly woman under anesthesia currently undergoing a last-ditch surgical attempt to rid her body of terminal late-stage breast cancer. Though her surgery is never shown, the director, Tommy Wiseau who plays the minor character Johnny, masterfully uses Claudette as an unreliable narrator to let the audience delve into Claudette's tormented ego as she comes to grips with her relationship with her daughter Lisa, the lingering angst Claudette has about her life's achievements, and her own mortality.

Initially, it bears mentioning how Wiseau brilliantly alludes to Claudette's surgery. Wiseau's use of subtlety in two respects demonstrates his understanding of cinematic technique. First, Wiseau uses set pieces that appear profoundly artificial. Many set pieces are oddly decorated, have backdrops that do not track with the foreground, or are completely unnecessary to the plot. Second, Wiseau also injects subtle artificiality into characters themselves. Love scenes don't make sense anatomically, the delivery of certain lines is exaggerated beyond all bounds of acceptability, and many characters wear clothing that seems to be taken off the backs of the 1996 NBA draft class.

Do not be alarmed, this was intentional. Wiseau uses this artificiality to convey a sense that something is just not right...that perhaps what we're seeing is not quite reality, but instead are the memories of a tortured mind under anesthesia. This properly sets the stage for Claudette's introspective fever dream drama.

Claudette's tale is predominantly told through her interactions with other characters. Notably, the depictions of the characters in the movie are a prime example of how Wiseau tells this tale - elaborating on the personality of Claudette, and giving us a glimpse into the life she has lived, a life which might be lost at the end of the movie. For example, throughout the movie, it is clear that the anesthesia causes Claudette to undertake a profound self-examination, which Wiseau portrays by having Claudette impose her own insecurities onto others. The appearance of many characters changes subtly between most scenes, each character has subplots or motivations that are only partially developed, many characters appear fickle or even homicidal, and sometimes entire characters are replaced with different actors.

It is clear that Wiseau did this to demonstrate the inner turmoil felt by Claudette while on the operating table, and balancing this with Claudette's own limited experience with many of the people she knows in her own life. For example, although Claudette's relationship with her daughter is a loving one, Lisa is often depicted as manipulative and conniving. This clearly shows that while Claudette loves her otherwise perfect daughter, she is upset by her bland eagerness to be married and live safely. This allows us to understand better Claudette's regrets. By imposing this character flaw onto her daughter, Wiseau peels back the layer of the Claudette onion, and shows how she secretly wishes her daughter would live the life Claudette always dreamed about - carefree without regard for the feelings of others. By imposing her own insecurities onto her perfect daughter, Wiseau gives the watcher a glimpse into the complex motivations of Claudette.

Another prime example is Peter, Johnny's psychologist friend. Peter represents Claudette's feelings about the psychology profession as a whole. While Peter often times give sound advice, he is ambiguously replaced with another actor later in the movie. This shows that while Claudette values good psychological advice, in her opinion psychologists are fungible as good advice can come from anyone. Did Claudette have a bad experience with a psychologist in the past? Who knows, as Wiseau deliberately uses this ambiguity to paint a more pained and nuanced picture of Claudette.

However, what is most compelling about the Room is how Wiseau breaks the fourth wall by juxtaposing Claudette's thoughtful and seemingly self-aware dialogue against the nonsensical lines recited by other characters. For example, when major reoccurring and purposeful character Denny (played by Phillip Haldiman) asks Lisa to borrow the ingredients for basically an entire cake, Claudette asks whether Denny even has a kitchen. This rare criticality insinuates that Claudette is aware that she is undergoing surgery and subtly makes the viewer reflect on the extent of Claudette's own introspection. In fact, Claudette's brief mention of her breast cancer shows she is not only aware of it; but more importantly, the briefness in which it is mentioned shows that Claudette has avoided addressing it for a while, but believes she must now confront it directly. This sets up the final scene - Claudette's climactic coming to grips with own mortality.

Finally ending in the death of a minor character (I won't say who), Claudette eventually comes to grips with her own mortality. Though it is left ambiguous whether Claudette passes away at the end of the movie, it is - MAJOR SPOILERS - heavily implied that Claudette succumbs to her illness on the operating table. However, although although Claudette may have passed, it is not before many of the characters express strong regret for the events that transpired during the movie. Many characters are remorseful for the way they treated others, and many are struck by their own profound self-realizations. This is Claudette reconciling her turmoils. Although it is heavily implied Claudette succumbs to the cancer, Wiseau leaves Claudette's fate open to interpretation, keeping the door open to the possibility of a happy ending - Claudette is finally able to live the carefree life she has always dreamed.

In the end, it's hard to think of adjectives to describe a movie that so masterfully uses an apparently standalone plot as a distraction from the true plot - a nuanced and self-aware introspective about the life and times of a dying woman. This movie is truly unique and peerless. The five stars reviews of this movie are well deserved and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an esoteric cult-classic that ranks among the greatest psychological thrillers of its day. If you like this movie, I would also recommend Memento, Split, or anything with Nicolas Cage.

Konrath.

Talon: This movie amazed me in a bad way. I've seen this twice and each time I was shell-shocked on how Tommy Wiseau spent six million to create this terrible film. This drama had me laughing like it was a comedy. Tommy's even said his one of his inspirations is Alfred Hitchcock.

I definitely got the same vibe from THE ROOM as I did with PSYCHO.

So that's why Tommy's one of my favorite directors and its why I bought his Tommy Wiseau underwear. Wearing it everyday has improved my life. I laugh like him. I play catch. I have a best friend named Mark and we go jogging together. While playing catch.

Joe: Oh, hi Mark.

Talon: Alright, in all seriousness

I feel like I'm sitting on an atomic bomb waiting for it to go off.

This movie isn't good. It didn't make me want to punch the TV like JAWS 4 did, or fall asleep like ZAAT. I had a fun time viewing it alone, and with friends and family. Treat it like its a Rocky Horror Picture show and it's hilarious.

Even with the worst thing ever created, people have found a way to wring joy outta it.

Awesome.

Joe: THE ROOM has ROCKY HORROR type screenings around the country on a continuous basis, and Wiseau sometimes attends and answers questions. I haven't gone to one of these yet, but it's on my bucket list.

There has never been another movie like this. It will blow you mind.

Talon: Here's some of the dialog my dad and I had while viewing. Try to imagine some of our phrases as catchy slogans:

""Oh, hi Denny.""

""How come you and I never played catch like that?""
""You're right. I failed as a parent.""

""Yeah, that's how you record a phone line. With a cassette tape.""
""What the hell is a cassette tape?""

""You're tearing me apart, Lisa!""
""Oh hi, Denny.""
""Ha-ha-ha.""

""What country is Wiseau from?""
""Alpha centauri.""

""Oh, hi doggie.""",1486080000,,2204,5.213068181818182

2464197,2,B000CFYAMC,"It took me a long time to work through my feelings about this movie.  On the one hand I enjoy a truly wretched film (the sort of thing Mystery Science Theater 3000 and its successor, RiffTrax, ridicule with such panache).  On the other hand, this movie, while deeply, deeply flawed, is perhaps not such a stinker that it fits the ""Bad movies I love"" category, yet not capable of fitting into the ""Flawed brilliance"" category either.  I watched THE ROOM twice -- and own it now -- and have read and enjoyed the zesty book based on its (mis)making, THE DISASTER ARTIST.  All I can figure out is that this shows the incompatibility between the two credos under which the would-be auteur, Tommy Wiseau, struggled:  ""You've got to have a vision,"" and ""My way or the highway.""  The result is a self-indulgent mess that to me, is not wholly satisfying yet provides little snicker value (perhaps Mike, Kevin and Bill will send this up to my enjoyment soon).  It's full of gratuitous sex scenes, hypnotically bad acting (I can't really compare this to any movie I've ever seen, though the dialog and its presentation often comes close to the old Carol Burnett soap-opera send-up, ""As The Stomach Turns""), irrelevant characters, halfway decent sets presented with no talent for continuity -- yet I must admit many people do enjoy it for all kinds of reasons.

In my opinion Tommy Wiseau threw away six million dollars creating a film that would have worked pretty well as a low-budget indie provided the writer-director had had a vision AND the talent and experience to achieve it.  The DVD is cheap -- watch it if you like -- but don't blame me if you are also left cold!  I have, however, been informed that the RiffTrax cast (formerly Mystery Science Theater 3000 members) have indeed sent up this film.  That might make it more enjoyable to me.",1485648000,3,1838,4.6770186335403725

Sometimes, however, we do become aware of a cataclysmic chef-d'oeuvre we missed and it hurts, terribly. If it was committed to celluloid, though, all hope is not lost. Oh, what I would not give to be able to go back to the year 2003, if only for 100 minutes. One-hundred magical, nonsensically delightful minutes. To have witnessed this movie--wait...did I just say ""movie?--with an unsuspecting theater audience. OH, the pain!

To be confined in a living room, with a DVD player and a big screen television, alone, savoring, yet unfulfilled. Thirty seconds beyond the opening credits, deep in my heart, I know I am on a collision course with fate, a course that begs to be shared, with anyone, even Pat Morita and Jay Leno.

But, alas, it isn't to be. I hit the pause button, momentarily, with the thought of phoning a friend. I discover that I cannot arise from my easy chair. I am riveted. Sighing, I, once more, roll the tape, fully prepared to immerse myself into what is certain to be the apex in cinematic achievement.

Absorb details elsewhere. I will say that the viewer discomfort, rife within every frame, is palpable. It is gripping and cannot be ignored. But, this review is strictly laudatory.  My adulation for Ed Wood, reincarnate, in the person of Tommy Wiseau, is nonpareil. This man actually sat, thoughtfully crafting the lines we hear, so artfully rendered from a cast of actors who are a perfect match for said lines. He composed this entire script. He honestly did. Oh, to have been a fly on the wall. Oh, to be the proud owner of the original! That he also produced, starred in, and directed this classic love triangle takes my breath away. Hitchcock, Coppola, Scorsese, Musburger--eat your hearts out.

How gratifying to know I need search no further. ""The Room"" is the mother lode, which none other, if movie production continues for a million years, can approach. Mr. Wiseau, you have managed that which all but the most jaded movie critic deemed impossible. You punched your ticket to the pinnacle--numero uno--of intriguingly inept filmmaking. Though Ed Wood's legacy will live on, it certainly has been tarnished by your virtuoso endeavor. Every dramatic word, every non-reaction to those dramatic words, every camera angle, masterfully wrought. You, sir, are a genius--the Einstein of cinema. I salute you!

All those who ventured here, do you recall Dorothy's prescient words, ""My! People come and go so quickly here!""? Do they EVER! Look, you simply MUST make room for ""The Room."" None of the cliched ""... minutes of my life I will never get back"" will you utter. Instead, you will eagerly sacrifice many more slices of your all-too-brief lives, paying homage to this once-in-forever masterpiece. But, please, see it with a friend...or, an enemy...or, a total stranger, but go through what I just did. There are at least 200 pause-worthy places, but what good if you're alone?!

AFTERTHOUGHT: Please, do not be mislead by the title. The sweeping cinematography is not confined to a mere room. There is an upstairs, as well. Oh, and we also get to enjoy location footage. Who can forget the sweetness of Anniversary Flowers & Gifts, not to mention the parking lot outside the apartment complex housing ""The Room.""

SECOND AFTERTHOUGHT: Ignore the sensation of failing vision. The blurry, out-of-focus, oddly-tinted shots are all there for your viewing displeasure. BY the way, for all of you naysayers, let me assure you that you canNOT replicate this effort. Any attempt to intentionally sabotage the movie-making process can be spotted instantly. For an endeavor like Mr. Wiseau's to endure, it has to be genuinely conceived and lovingly applied, which is why there is no chance his accomplishment will suffer the indignity of phony duplication. No matter how small your budget, we will see right through you.

FACTOID? By all accounts, Mr. Wiseau invested $6,000,000 in this compelling, though scarce in the visible expenditures department. Can someone, please, provide an accounting as to the whereabouts of the lavish budgeting?

LASTLY: Does anyone know where I might purchase the soundtrack. The score has to be heard to be believed. All original songs? I assume so. In any case, they are on par with every other aspect of this gem.",1483488000,,4486,4.928476821192053

Not only does he have to overdub half the things he says (IN AN INTERVIEW FOR GOD'S SAKE), as he did in the film itself, Mr. Wiseau presents a surprising new way of thinking about ""The Room,"" as well as its cinematic siblings (e.g. ""Plan. 9 from Outer Space,"" ""Birdemic: Shock and Terror,"" ""Samurai Cop"") and how you view them with ur bros on a TGIF. I'll let you guys hear it for yourselves.

Plus, the extras that the casting agency selected are all generically good-looking chiseled blonde men and women dressed like escorts, so even if you hate the movie (as any rational person ought to) there's eye candy for any and all viewers.

2464222,1,B000CFYAMC,"I'd like to write a review that will balance out some of the glowing praise by bad movie aficionados, just in case a normal person stumbles onto this movie. ""The Room"" is a really bad movie, so bad that it kind of crosses into good, but doesn't.

This movie feels like it was (if not, in fact, IS) written by someone who had a bad breakup and just imagined his revenge scenario. The basic plot is that a guy named Johnny is engaged to a woman who's dedicated to tormenting him. She gets him drunk, accuses him of beating her, sleeps with his best friend, lies about being pregnant, and other horrors. Johnny remains loyal to her, even as she makes his life hell.

The characters are not just paper-thin, but torn. People do things for no reason with no logic behind them. Lisa fares the worst, hating and tormenting Johnny for no other reason than she says he's ""boring."" People will bring things up, then say they don't want to talk about it. His best friend Mark sleeps with Lisa, even while protesting how he doesn't want her. Lisa's mother says she has cancer for no reason, but no one seems concerned about it. Johnny complains Lisa is lying about him, but doesn't leave her. Lisa complains she doesn't want to marry Johnny, but won't leave him. The only thing anyone can agree on is that Johnny is a great guy and Lisa is a sociopath. There's also the fact that characters will appear without introduction and no explanation of who they are, say a few lines, and disappear from the movie, never to be seen again.

One description I think is best is that this movie seems like it was written by aliens who have no understanding of human emotion, trying to tell an emotional story. Likewise, Wiseau talks and acts like an alien trying to mimic human speech and laughter.

The love scenes are absolutely horrific. First, they go on way too long. Second, they're so over the top with rose petals and lace that they look like a parody of a love scene. Third, we get copious shots of Wiseau naked and thrusting into what looks like Lisa's bellybutton. We also get some of Lisa's nudity, which if you know the behind the scenes, the actress was absolutely horrified by, so is cringe-worthy.

I don't think this movie is the best good bad movie, simply because so much of it is just flat out boring. When you're going from an argument with the guy's girlfriend to two guys tossing a football around in the park, it's just wearying. The movie won't seem as bad the first time you watch it. There are a lot of scenes that aren't good, but you assume will pay off in the end...but they don't.

If it weren't for Wiseau, this movie might just look like a bad made-for-TV movie, and disappear. He takes the movie into the surreal every time he appears; a slurring, sleepy-eyed, heavily accented weirdo with a mountain of long black hair who makes even the most basic of activities like saying ""hi"" seem like a struggle against the forces of nature.

I'm going to give this movie one star, not because I didn't find it perversely entertaining, but feel like giving it five stars is giving it too much credit. ""The Room"" shouldn't be getting the same rating as ""Citizen Kane,"" when both are on opposite ends of the filmmaking spectrum.",1480377600,6,3226,4.504273504273504

What takes this horrible film and raises it to the status of ""Best Worst Movie Ever Made"" is the veneer of competence laid over the top of some of the worst acting (and undoubtedly the worst screenplay) ever committed to film. And HD video. I've seen thousands of films both good and bad. ""The Room"" is a master class in what NOT to do when attempting to make a movie.

2464296,5,B000CFYAMC,"What more is there to say that hasn't already been said about this incredible film? It changed my life and it will forever change yours if you allow yourself, for 99 minutes, to fall under its irresistible spell. Every inconsistency, every inane moment of dialogue, the endless plot points that are taken up and then discarded with reckless abandon - they all add up to create a cinematic experience that is so intriguing, so baffling, so incredible that you may start to suspect you've been abducted by aliens - extraterrestrials of the same race as the director, producer, writer, and actor of this film, the famous Tommy Wiseau.

The plot is, of course, simple: Johnny, a well-meaning and admittedly oafish banker, is being cheated on by his sociopath of a girlfriend, Lisa. Who is the object of her inordinate desire? Mark, Johnny's best friend! Mark, unfortunately, seems clueless for half the film in regards to Lisa's intentions - hence the reason he asks ""what are you doing?"" every time she begins the clumsy and completely unappetizing seduction process. Eventually, however, Mark catches on and begins to revel in the illicit affair - which is quickly discovered by Johnny at his own birthday party. The result is a brawl of epic proportions, an intense confrontation between Lisa and Johnny that rivals the showdown between Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman in Doubt, and an ending so shocking, so explosive, you may need to take a few days off of work to process it.

This is the basic plot, but a wealth of other scenes and conversations occur throughout the film and provide a thorough, searingly accurate psychological portrait of the foibles of modern man.

For instance, there is the scene in which Denny, a completely incompetent teenager under the tutelage of Johnny, has a showdown with a drug dealer named Chris R. - an embodiment of the failed war on drugs. Chris R. is promptly pistol-whipped by an intervening Mark and Johnny, who arrive in the nick of time to drag him from the rooftop [the common hangout for characters in this film] and undoubtedly execute him in the alleyway. Another showdown occurs at a later point between Peter, a Psychologist, and Mark - who attempts to cast Peter off the roof, Scar/Mufasa style, when the psychologist uncovers the truth about Mark's illicit affair. Peter flees the scene after this near-death experience and never appears again - taking his place in later scenes is an unnamed friend who utters, to Lisa, one of the best lines in the entire film: ""I feel like I'm sitting on an atomic bomb, waiting for it to go off.""

Which brings me to the dialogue of the film. The real genius of this movie lies, above all, in its interactions between the characters. The plot and scenes mentioned above are nothing without the exchanges between Lisa and Johnny, Lisa and Mark, Lisa and Michelle, Lisa and her mother, Mark and Johnny, Peter and Mark, Peter and Johnny - do you see how this list can go on? But the true master of speech in this film is Johnny himself. In scene after scene, the protagonist of the film provides us with pithy, philosophically astute, life-altering aphorisms that would instantly change the way we live if only we had the intellect to grasp them. Here is a smattering of said aphorisms [also included is a reference to their context]:

""That's life."" [Said in response to Mike, Michelle's boyfriend, relaying a story about losing his underwear.]
""If a lot of people loved each other, the world would be a better place to live."" [Said in response to Denny announcing that he is secretly in love with Lisa.]
""Do you not understand life?"" [Said while pushing Lisa down onto the couch in a fit of absolute rage-filled grief.]

I could go on, but for the sake of not boring any readers of this viewer to death, I'll stop here. I hope I have made my point: if you have not yet seen The Room, you need to remedy this immediately. Everything about this film will change the way you think about cinema, art, love, your own existence. It is a tour de force, a masterpiece of our times, an essential item in any film buff's collection. Purchase it and watch it today - you will not regret it.",1461110400,,4175,4.712328767123288

However, now I see Tommy more as a human being with feelings and hopes and dreams, as opposed to some odd vampire with enough money to buy his own HD camera for filming.

2464349,5,B000CFYAMC,The Room is a perfect white elephant gift. This Wiseau tour de force should be a part of everyone's film library.,1449705600,,113,4.428571428571429
2464350,5,B000CFYAMC,"This is almost as bad as his online TV series. It's hands down the best worst movie ever. Get Mark's audiobook after this though for sure, it's so enlightening into the World of Wiseau",1449705600,,184,4.4411764705882355
2464351,3,B000CFYAMC,"Almost everyone agrees that The Room is a bad movie. Here's the real question: is it so bad, it's good?

I discovered The Room thanks to YouTube, where five or six of its most outrageous scenes are available for viewing. I found these scenes hilarious, so I took the plunge and bought the whole film on DVD. Alas, watching The Room as a whole proved disappointing; the five famous scenes are a riot, but the rest of the film is mostly tedious.

How tedious? Well, for example, there are four sex scenes in the first 30 minutes of this movie -- and the third one recycles footage from the first one! The film is also full of repetitive musical cues, repetitive conversations, repetitive fight scenes, and repetitive games of football. This is all allegedly hilarious, according to the film's fans. And I guess it is hilarious...sort of. But it's also just kinda boring.

Generally speaking, the film is funny whenever the main character, Johnny, is on screen. Johnny is played by the film's writer/director Tommy Wiseau, who can't act and has an unusual accent; consequently, he dominates the film and makes a real impression. The other characters are lifeless and drag the whole thing down. Overall, if I want to watch a bad movie, I'll reach for Plan 9 From Outer Space before this; with its inept zombie attacks, terrible special effects and surprisingly eloquent antiwar message, Plan 9 is miles ahead of The Room in the so-bad-it's-good stakes.

As for the DVD itself...it comes with a handful of pretty good special features, including extensive behind-the-scenes footage that gives you a closeup view of The Room's terrible, unconvincing sets. There are also some deleted scenes -- really, just alternate takes of the drug dealer scene that is actually in the movie. Finally, there is an interview with Tommy Wiseau, during which he gives bizarre, evasive answers to a series of tough questions about the film. For example, when asked how he came up with the idea to make The Room, Wiseau answers that he wrote the script and then filmed the movie. Yeah, we knew that already.

Ah, well. I guess I'm glad that I own this thing. It's not as funny as I hoped it would be, and I'm not sure it deserves cult status. But it has its moments, and it was cheap (cheep, cheep, cheep! As Johnny would say...)",1449619200,,2304,4.721393034825871

The movie clips I was seeing on youtube could not compare to the raw footage of this DVD. The director, Tommy Wisseau, put his heart and soul into this movie and it shows as it is a romantic drama about an American banker who cannot seem to get social interactions down. Many people hold different opinions of this gem, but it is the true fans that believe this is the greatest movie to come out in this century. Full of action, drama, suspense, twists and turns, you won't want to turn this movie off once you start! From the very beginning the viewer is hit with the most iconic phrase in cinema to date, ""Hi babe"". It is simple, yet elegant. It doesn't stop there either, the phrases never get old and you will never find a more dramatic scene than ""the rooftop scene"". Tossing the football around never looked so fun!

But, even with all of that said, this movie is one of the most entertaining you'll ever see. It's so bad, it's just impossible not to laugh at it. I suggest getting a group of friends together to watch it (especially if they're going into it blind).

In my opinion, this is definitely worth it for fans of Tommy Wiseau and his maniacal cult-classic.  Although I'd honestly recommend keeping an eye out on Tommy Wiseau's website for deals instead of purchasing it on Amazon.  A while back, his site had a sale, and I was able to get ""The Room"" as part of a package deal that included the Blu-Ray, DVD and even a pair of official Tommy Wiseau underwear (yes, underwear) for not that much more than what Amazon charges.

And to address the question: Yes, the film does receive a substancial visual upgrade in the Blu-Ray format.  The DVD release always looked a bit too fuzzy and washed out to me.  The Blu-Ray is bright, crisp, clear, sharp and has much better contrast.  It's actually arguably one of the best DVD-to-Blu-Ray upgrades I've seen in recent years.

2464376,4,B000CFYAMC,"The room is a movie that makes me very sad. Not because of anything that happens in the plot, but because there is very obviously a heart and a soul behind it, but not a brain. It's loaded to the brim with red herrings, entire conversations are made of non-sequiturs, the plot jumps from point to point without any logic as to how and why it got there, a scene's tone and a character's personality wildly swings from one end of the spectrum to the other, the dialogue is horrific, the acting is atrocious (especially from Johnny's actor, Tommy Wiseau), the sex scenes are many and overly long (I get the feeling this was once meant to be a porno) and there are several scenes on a rooftop where the background is obviously green-screened in (even though an actual rooftop with a skyline view would be cheaper, and actually look like a real rooftop with a skyline view)!! All and all, this is exactly what makes The Room such a fun movie to watch. Watching this madcap mashup of people who half the time do nothing, and the other half hilariously overact, is a delight to anyone who enjoys movies that were never meant to be comedies, but turned out funny anyway.

It helped to imagine I was in a theater filled with laughing and groaning tuxedo-wearers throwing footballs to one another and plastic spoons at the screen.  Many years ago I went to midnight screenings of Rocky Horror Picture Show, and the atmosphere in the theater was electric with the antics of the audience in full regalia.

To put it bluntly it's incomrehensible. Characters are brought in for no reason, only to have them disappear later with no mention of why they were introduced. Ideas and concepts are brought up only to be ignored a moment later. People speak and act in ways that no human ever has and at the centre of it all is Johnny played by the writer, director and producer: Tommy Wiseau.

To say Tommy can't act is an understatement. He's like a talent vacuum and just sucks the life out of any scene he's in. But at the same time it's strangely compelling. To make an intentionally bad movie takes an incredible amount of talent. To make an unintentionally bad movie takes no talent at all. But to make an unimaginably enjoyable bad movie is the stuff dreams are made of.

The Room needs to be seen to be believed. It needs to be experienced firsthand. And while Tommy is now saying he did it this way on purpose, subsequent work from him show that he really can't pull it off when he's trying to be bad.",1438646400,17,1230,4.339130434782609

The characters and situations are creepy and yet totally intriguing. Our leading man and director is such a bad actor he seems to be channeling who could have been the Marlon Brando on a planet somewhere where bad acting is great. The movie is just so bizarre and creepy, and take it from someone who appears in the TROLL2 documentary, BEST WORST MOVIE (the guy who wrote the fan script): no bad movie is worth a cult following if there's not something that makes you think about it later, and THE ROOM does that, in droves.

2464450,5,B000CFYAMC,"The Room is master auteur Tommy Wiseau's piece de resistance. Beautifully written, skillfully shot, and impeccably acted, this disturbing film unsettles the viewer by posing terrifying questions: Is breast cancer something worth exploring? Or should it be casually mentioned and tossed aside? How far apart should two people stand to throw a football? If two people start having sex, will it automatically rain outside? Is sex on the stairs better than sex in bed? How does it feel to be ""torn apart""? Is acting overrated? Is sensical dialogue required to make an entertaining movie? Can you trust anyone?

The movie deftly explores these riveting themes without offering comforting bromides.

 If you could combine the script-writing skills of Ingmar Bergman, the poetic vision of John Ford, the relentless energy of Martin Scorsese, the existential humor of Woody Allen, and the mythicism of Jeff Nichols, you would create an artist *almost* as talented and interesting as Wiseau.

2464454,1,B000CFYAMC,"Where does one even begin to review this awful, horrendous, bumbling nonsense of a film? Let's be honest. This was NOT intended to be a black comedy by any stretch of the imagination, but Tommy Wiseau retroactively labeled it so to save face. From the cringe-worthy acting to the hilariously bad one liners, this film could not have gotten any worse even if it had turned into a softcore porn film (you'll be given this impression within the first five minutes), of which I've seen better. At least the supporting cast appears to try their best, though that really isn't enough. No one could have redeemed this film. NO ONE. It never had a chance.

Tommy Wiseau's ""Johnny"" shuffles through every scene with all the enthusiasm of a stoned zombie, even when he's throwing things. There are many establishing shots to assure you that the story takes place in San Francisco, despite never once leaving the city. About four gratuitous sex scenes take place which are much longer than they needed to be and serve no purpose to advance the story whatsoever, nor do the scenes of jogging through the park or eating out at local shops. From Lisa's mother (""If you think I'm tired today, wait until you see me tomorrow!"") to Denny Who Just Wants To Watch, this horrid hemorrhoid of a movie couldn't get much worse. Really, the only bearable scenes are with Tommy Wiseau himself, who at least seems to provide some comic relief. But by the time he puts the gun in his mouth at the end, it's a mercy killing. And then of course Lisa delivers the penultimate line to Mark, ""I've lost him but I still have you, right?!""

I think that really says it all. This movie was honestly more cringe-worthy than it was funny. Literally. You'll be sitting there furiously grinding the enamel off your teeth through the entire viewing, only permitting yourself to laugh when Johnny walks in. Even then, it hurts. I have to say one thing though. This movie definitely earns its reputation as the Worst Film Ever.

2464467,5,B000CFYAMC,"I'm a worshiper of all things bad. I love bad films. I love bad books. There's something about them so majestically hilarious that always manages to brighten my otherwise dreary day. The Room is no exception in that case.

When I first heard of The Room, it was when I saw clips to it in a show I often watched, Tim and Eric, Awesome Show, Great Job. Tommy Wiseau starred in one of their episodes as a ""guest director."" I had NO idea who Tommy Wiseau even was, so as you can imagine, I spent that entire episode simultaneously amused and stunned. ""Who is this really, really weird, zany lunatic?"" I asked myself. ""He's hilarious."" During the episode, they played clips from The Room, and I thought it was just some joke movie they made up for the purpose of the episode. It took me almost a year to find out that it was no joke. That abomination actually existed. There really is a film where a greasy-haired European screams ""YOU ARE TEARING ME APART LISAAAA!""

I thought, ""I have to see this movie. NOW.""

I can't count, to this day, how many times I've watched this god-awful cinematic disaster, but after my many viewings, and after learning of the kind of person Tommy Wiseau is, I've come to learn new things about the movie and the person who made it that I wouldn't have considered before. One of those things is how every character represents each part of Wiseau's eerie personality.

1. Johnny. This is the man Tommy thinks he is. It's the man who is both strong and a victim, and all he wants is to make people happy, when all they do is slap him in the face. He's a man that for some reason, EVERYONE loves, regardless of who they are or what they're doing. He's wise to a fault, and gives (strange) advice (such as ""Don't worry about it."") that everyone who knows him hangs onto. Men are his buddies and women are evil to him, though they think he's worth suffering sex with.

2. Lisa. Come to find out, Tommy Wiseau is quite the narcissist. He's cruel, manipulative, and selfish. This is basically Lisa in a nutshell. She will do whatever it takes to get what she wants, even cheat and lie. She has little to no responsibilities, other than throwing parties and sorting out which people are best to sleep with. She will start random fights just because she loves drama.

3. Denny. This is Tommy's childlike naivety, the last remaining glimmers of the innocence of youth. Denny ""gets involved with drugs,"" though we aren't told of the nature of said drugs, or which drugs they are, and he is almost killed by a dealer. I can almost see, when watching the character of Denny, how much Tommy loved him. Almost like a father loves his weird, creepy, bug-eyed kid despite the fact he's weird, creepy, and bug-eyed. It's a connection with his inner child we all get to see in the making of this monstrosity.

4. Michelle. She almost works like Tommy's conscience. ""You're being so manipulative"" she warns Lisa at one point (while still remaining friends with her for some reason). On more than one occasion, she brings up that Lisa is too cruel to others and she needs to tone down the crazy. Perhaps this was Tommy's way of telling his own overbearing personality to take it down a notch and not be such a jerk.

5. Claudette, Lisa's Mother. She might be how Tommy views all women. Bitter old women who hate men who only seek to destroy them. Her entire role is based around telling Lisa how she must continue to string along the man she doesn't love because it's hinted that it's what women are supposed to do.

6. Peter. This might be the rare ""good"" side of Tommy. He just wants to make a good movie, he just wants people to have a good time, and he doesn't want anyone smoking drugs. He might even feel the need to help a friend who is upset or hurt, even if it gets in the way of him making a crappy movie.

7. Mark. Oh boy. I think this is the stud muffin Tommy WISHES he was. Thinking that is almost sort of heartbreaking in a way, but I believe it to be true. Tommy has been known to be insecure with himself. Mark is the man that wins the (cute?) blonde in the end, and steals her away from the not-so-cute victimized European guy. All Johnny had to do was be good-looking and have a scraggly beard so he could have the life and woman of his dreams. In the end, the hot guy wins. It's so unfair. Life is so unfair. Everyone betray him, Johnny fed up with dis worl.

8. Chris-R. Rage. The R. It's for rage.

9. Mike. Sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex. Sex? Sex.

When giving it all some thought, I think I like the movie more than I used to. And Greg Sestero for having suffered through it.",1423785600,,4598,4.382629107981221

But at the same time you will be compelled to keep watching, unable to pull yourself away. Maybe Wiseau hit on some unknown element of the collected unconscious where people are uncontrollably drawn to subtle imagery of spoons.

In short. This movie is an absolute train wreck. It's got a production value that makes a middle school A/V club's short film look like Gone With The Wind. And yet, much like a train wreck, you will be unable to stop watching.",1423008000,,933,4.658536585365853

maybe im getting too old, or too jaded toward these things.  I found it mind-numbing for sure, but more from the boredom of it all.  It starts out rocky enough and stays that way, but the general storyline (?) is lame and the whole thing just doesn't seem to reach the depths of say, Birdemic.

I am apparently affected enough to write this review out.  I guess that may be because of the glowing reviews that also pushed me over the edge into ordering it...I am really shocked at how disappointed I was.  might be worth a rental for curiosity's sake, but i can't recommend purchasing...i cant imagine wanting to sit through this twice nor do i want to subject anyone i know to it.

2464488,4,B000CFYAMC,"This is a movie that attempts to answer an important question: can a man in modern day San Francisco with the looks and behavior of a Cro-Magnon find true love and trust among his friends?  For this film the question is unanswerable, not because it is one of those enigmatic questions that demand an in-depth probing of the soul and Man's place in this universe, etc, etc, but because the film itself is bad enough to displace PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE of the title of Worst Movie Ever Made (no mean feat there), hence, it definitely provides no answer.  Tommy Wiseau, the film's producer, writer, director, star, and aforementioned Cro-Magnon, shows here in his first film how he has a lot more ego and passion than talent or even a smidgen of artistry, which places him in the same ranks as the immortal Ed Wood.

The plot is one of those love-triangle things. Wiseau plays Johnny, who works at a bank (though not as a teller or account manager; his appearance would scare the customers away) and is engaged to Lisa (Juliette Danielle), who's mother (Carolyn Minnott) has an astounding announcement that is never referred to again.  But Lisa no longer loves Johnny (wonder why) and is having an affair with Johnny's best friend Mark (Greg Sestero).  Johnny finds out about the affair, goes ape and feels alone and betrayed in this cold, cruel world.  It all sounds too familiar, but at least this film can present it in a whole new way that can hopefully kill the whole love-triangle genre.

To get a real measure for the qualities of this picture, read Greg Sestero's ""The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, The Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made"", now available on Kindle. Greg met Tommy in acting class, where Tommy was already showing himself the class wacko, and managed somehow to bond with him.  In this book, you see how:

  - The whole production was shot in the parking lot of the place from which Wiseau bought the film equipment, for a pretty price I'm sure.

  - Tommy couldn't decide whether to shoot in cellular film or HD, so he shot both ways simultaneously.

  - The rooftop sequences were not filmed in San Francisco,  but in the parking lot in LA using green screening, which often is not joined together properly.  Why did Wiseau do that?  One of the great mysteries of this picture.

  - Wiseau himself seems to be an authentic man of mystery. Nobody knows where he came from (his English is broken) or where he got his money from, like the $6 million he sunk into this thing.  But he certainly was tyranical on the set, where most of the time, according to Greg, he didn't even know what it was he was doing.  Maybe that's part of genius, but I don't know.

Other goodies include the trite dialogue taken from other, greater movies (""You're tearing me apart, Lisa!""),  the fact that the same room was used for several settings (hence the film's title?) and, when some actors were fired or left, others were brought in to play the same characters and I for one have no idea who is who.

Tommy Wiseau seems to have made an American film in the enigmatic Europeon style, the kind that baffles Americans.  He certainly succeeded, as THE ROOM is now a bonafide cult classic, with midnight showings and party viewings like THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW used to have.  It's great, laughable folly.

2464491,1,B000CFYAMC,"Like a bad accident, once you start watching this, you won't be able to wrench yourself away. Tommy Wiseau had to go through heck and high water to make this film, including wasting 6 million dollars on production and marketing. What I could have done with that! The movie should seriously be included in textbooks on filmmaking. Like a chapter on what to do if your movie sinks the Titanic, or some such tosh. For the life of me, I cannot understand how someone could intentionally make something this horrendous. Unless it was for a colossal April Fool's Day joke, otherwise I believe the director didn't fully understand the consequences of his inflated ego. And it's an ego to rival Godzilla's that made this travesty. There are good filmmakers and then there are...BAD filmmakers.

To lessen the damage this movie will inflict, watch the Riffrax version right after. Or if you're smart, just watch the Rifftrax by itself. Otherwise, you risk a trip to the doctor for some serious drugs to erase the memories this film will induce. I don't know what Tommy Wiseau was thinking, maybe he wasn't, or maybe he is a victim of his vision. I don't know. All I know is that the film is bad. Hilariously so.

Tommy Wiseau chose to star in and direct the thing himself, which should have been okay. Clint Eastwood has done it; no one's the worse for wear for it. Well, watch this and you'll be tripping down Main Street. Wiseau is Johnny, a hapless banker in San Francisco with a beautiful fiancee he adores madly and spoils rotten with trashy lingerie. She doesn't do anything all day but sit and pout and wait for her love-muffin to come home. He does, calling for Lisa in a strangely weird monotone, his fragmented English that's neither here nor there. There's a creepy teenage third wheel who likes to tumble about in bed with the loved-up twosome. Right before they head on up to shag in a ridiculously slow montage to a porn soundtrack with Tommy Wiseau's bare rump waving about as he rides poor Lisa.

Later, Lisa laments that she is bored stiff with her adoring man. He loves her and spoils her rotten, what's not to love? Well, Lisa is fickle, like most of the characters in this. Johnny has a BFF, Mark, whom Lisa decides will be a better catch. When Johnny's not catching a football, he's yawning ""Oh, hi Mark!"" every chance he gets.

The dialogue? I've heard dialogue in mortuaries that induce more excitement. Acting? A tree has more personality. And the plot? Hmm. Johnny loves Lisa. Lisa hates Johnny and decides people need to know how evil he is by lying about his beating her. Her mother advises financial security is important. Yeah, like a hernia. Subplots include: her mother's cancer; Lisa's affair with Mark; Mark feeling guilty; numerous characters introduced without reason explained. It was almost as if they were added as cardboard stand-ins and then forgotten.

Poor deluded Johnny. He is a confused little man. Like this movie. He meanders to and fro, never realizing his girlfriend is snogging his best friend. Later, there's a birthday party and feeling betrayed by all of humanity (his friends), Johnny does what Johnny does best. He leaves. Permanently.

You're not sorry. In fact, if this movie were erased from all of humanity's collective memory, you wouldn't be the least bit sorry. I know, some may not consider it to be that bad. But it is!!!! I'd only watch it if you've nothing better to do, or if you're waiting to be anesthetized for surgery. The guy won't have to use much.

All in all, bad film, bad plot, bad writing, bad editing, bad acting, and overall worst use of film ever!!!

Only watch if you need a good laugh. During and after, you'll be screaming, ""You are tearing me apart, Lisa!""",1418428800,5,3732,4.687022900763359

2464521,5,B000CFYAMC,"Okay. So Tommy Wiseau's odd accent, mannerisms, and seemingly bi-polar character aside, this movie was actually better than I was lead to believe. Johnny is a banker who's been living in San Francisco for ten years and dating Lisa for seven of those ten. They're about to get engaged, but Lisa is bored with Johnny and instead wants Johnny's best friend. He resists at first, but is too drawn to Lisa, thus creating the love triangle drama of the movie. Sure, the acting isn't that good, and there are plenty of plot holes. But the film's story is consistent and all the main actors aside from Wiseau do their best with what they have. They're not TERRIBLE, per se.

You see, we currently live in the internet age, where everything is on display to nitpick and criticize from an anonymous space. TV and movie viewers are very spoiled, nowadays. Which has lead to the rise of the ""So Bad, it's Good"" genre. Unintentionally hilarious and entertaining movies, despite their poor quality, writing, and acting. First, we had ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". Then ""Manos: The Hands of Fate."" Then, ""Troll 2."" Now, we even have intentional So Bad, They're Good movies, like ""Sharknado"", it's sequel, and ""Rubber."" While ""The Room"" is pretty low-budget, it has many things these movies do not have. A clear plot and storyline. C- grade acting from the cast (aside from Wiseau) which is at least better than an F. And even some level of believability in that Johnny's friends and even at times, Lisa herself, don't exactly approve of Lisa's behavior. These elements alone make The Room a ""bad, but watchable"" movie, instead of ""so bad, it's good.""

You want to see some TRULY BAD movies? If you can find 'em, watch ""City Dragon."" Or ""Warriors of the Apocalypse (2009)"". Or even the now infamous ""Birdemic."" Getting into big budget movies, how about ""Southland Tales""? ""2012""? ""Cloud Atlas""? ""The Lone Ranger""? Or ""John Carter"".

It's clear to see how easy it is to pick on The Room. And to his credit, Wiseau doesn't churn out a bad script (if you ignore the plot holes I'll just assume he forgot to edit out of the final product, such as Lisa's mother's breast cancer). Not-so-great directing, sure. Wiseau isn't the best at directing. Acting wise, yeah, his accent and odd mannerisms DO make you think he's slightly retarded and has some sort of high functioning autism, even though I'm pretty sure his character in reality does not. But to his credit (or perhaps, the actors), the story isn't THAT bad. If you took Wiseau out of the film and replaced him with a decent lead actor, we'd just have a forgettable mediocre low-budget film (though $6 million is still a bit high for ""low budget"" films, which are never supposed to be more than half a mil). But it's Tommy Wiseau's quirky character of Johnny that catapult's the film into cult status.

No, it's no ""Troll 2."" However, it's still leaps and bounds better than films like ""Birdemic."" Anyone who calls this movie ""really, really bad"" has no clue on what TRULY bad movies are out there. And I'm not just talking about shark-filled tornadoes and sentient car tires that murder people. ""The Room"" truly is a classic. But try to watch it back when you did before everyone crap-talked on the internet. It's entertaining in it's own bizarre, quirky way.",1411516800,,3292,4.729965156794425

2464539,3,B000CFYAMC,"Love it or hate it, The Room is a movie the will leave an impression upon you.  It is not one of those mediocre films that you watch and completely forget about a day or two after watching.  For better or worse, there's no forgetting it at all.

 So what is it exactly?  For starters, Tommy Wiseau's only full length movie is a work of such staggering ineptitude that it redefines not only what a bad movie is, it also allows viewers to explore a whole new dimension of lousiness much like a great science fiction novel allows its readers to explore an alien civilization.  It is within the confines of The Room that the rules of logic and order that we take for granted seem to no longer exist.  Everything that could have went wrong such as acting, writing, directing, and even the choosing of the soundtrack went way wrong.

  Here are only a few examples of what I am talking about:

  1. In the first a few minutes, Johnny (played by Wiseau) buys a bouquet of flowers.  His conversation with the cashier reminds me of these exercises I did as a second grade student in which we were given a paragraph and we had to piece together which events happened in which order.  Even though the conversation only lasts a few seconds, I was left wondering how the universe did not collapse due to the paradoxes that the out of sequence dialogue had to have created.  Sure, people can say any words they want to in any order.  But still?

  2. There are two sex scenes with unintentionally hilarious background 1980s styled pop ballads that literally use the same footage.

  3. Wiseau's mere physical appearance with his Fabio-esque hair and mannerisms make it impossible for him to be taken seriously as a banker, even if he saves the bank ""bundles of money"".

  4. There is the foul mouthed thug who harassed Denny and the actor who portrayed him is noteworthy for having the best performance in The Room.  How Tommy and Mark apprehend him and take him to the police station only to have them reappear very shortly afterward has to be seen to be disbelieved.

  5. There is one scene that hardly anyone mentions but it is one in which I find quite humorous.  Johnny is shown walking at a distance that appears to be 50-75 feet away from the camera.  You can hear his footsteps as if he is right next to you.

  6. Finally, this film has the lamest utterance of an obscenity that concerns a person who engages in sexual congress with female parental units ever depicted on camera, or possibly even when you include every casual conversation ever held in the history of mankind.

And that is just barely scratching the surface.

 When I first watched this movie I was left with two conclusions.  The first conclusion was that there must be a picture of Wiseau that hangs in acting and directing schools that by itself tells students everything that they need to not do in order to be at least moderately successful. The second conclusion was that maybe Wiseau is a comic genius who created an excruciatingly funny new form of anti-drama.  I desperately wanted to believe this scenario but sadly I learned that the former conclusion is correct once I read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Disaster-Artist-My-Life-Inside-The-Room-the-Greatest-Bad-Movie-Ever-Made/dp/1451661193/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made</a>.  From what I read in that book, Wiseau took himself so seriously that he was going to submit the movie to the Academy for Oscar consideration.

  I would be belaboring the obvious by telling you that I can't give The Room a very high rating due to the sheer technical incompetence.  However, I never once found the film to be boring.  For all of its faults, and believe me when I say that plenty can be found, The Room is not without its goofy charm.  My experience with most bad films is that I only find out after watching them that they are bad, which leads to anger and disgust.  It was the opposite with The Room.  I knew it was bad, but I was not expecting it to be so entertaining. It is a bad movie that I will never regret watching.  Therefore, I am also unable to give it a very low rating.",1407974400,2,4226,4.714090287277702

2464544,5,B000CFYAMC,"When I was watching ""The Room"" for the first time I thought the title of my review had to revolve around the love triangle between Johnny, Lisa, and Mark. Unfortunately the film is so confusing and so many characters come and go with no rhyme or reason I didn't think it was as much of a triangle as it was a shape of unconventional geometry: in other words it was, mathematically speaking, the story of a love ""n-gon.""

Everything you may have heard about this movie is true, but it's worse than that. If you thought James Nguyen 's ""Birdemic: Shock and Terror"" was a bit too nuanced and well-acted, you may be ready for an encounter with ""The Room."" The film is in no way good, but it clearly is completely sincere: I do not believe the cover art that claims it's a ""black comedy;"" this is played completely straight and calling this a comedy smacks of revisionist history. This movie is the brainchild of Tommy Wiseau who wrote, directed, and starred in this cinematic opus. The film revolves around Johnny's (Wiseau) relationship with his fiance Lisa (Juliette Danielle,) who is manipulative in the extreme, just like her wholly detestable mother Claudette (Carolyn Minnott.) Lisa starts an affair with Johnny's best friend Mark (Greg Sestero) which is always a smart move, and everyone's lives predictably crumble.

Characters and subplots appear and disappear for no apparent reason, and even some of the larger parts in the film leave you scratching your head, with exhibit A being Denny (Philip Haldiman) who is described as being an orphaned occasionally drug-addicted mentally-challenged college student who Johnny has taken under his wing and given full access to his apartment. Denny at one point expresses his desire to observe Johnny and Lisa...uh...in action, shall we say, and at another point confesses his love for Lisa to Johnny which Johnny has no problem with. This culminates in a scene on a rooftop that has to be one of the most grating ever filmed, leading to an appropriate exclamation from Claudette (perhaps the most sensible dialogue in the film) ""Somebody had better do something around here!"" Other friends and acquaintances come and go, subplots lead nowhere, but true to the film's concept it almost all happens inside the room, with minor exceptions for dual rooftop scenes involving a never before and never again mentioned drug transaction gone horribly awry and a game of football in tuxedos gone wrong (not to imagine it could go right.) In the interview Wiseau singles out the football scene for particular analysis even though it is among the least significant in the entire movie; I found that focus to be wholly expected given the movie as a whole. The entire messy affair comes to a close as you guessed it might (no spoilers here) and the only cohesive thread throughout seems to be Mladen Milicevic's incessant, repetitive musical score. If the music isn't distracting enough, let's not even bring up the hairstyle choice Wiseau made for Johnny or the unplaceable accent he brings to the character (Vlad the Impaler meets Fabio, perhaps?)

""The Room"" is now a cult classic and is famous for midnight showings: it features an utterly confusing plot, some of the worst acting in history (seriously...you try and figure out who is worst; good luck with that,) and eccentric production choices that boggle the mind. Wiseau, for instance, didn't know whether 35mm or HD video was a better format for his film so he shot and edited the entire movie in both formats. He says he wants to write a book on the process, which would almost certainly be more interesting than the movie itself. Sestero actually did write a book about ""The Room"" which has been universally praised by bad movie fans.

Depending on your viewpoint this is either a five star or a one star movie: I frankly have no idea how to rationally rate it, so I generously went with five stars because say whatever you want at least Wiseau tried to make a movie. There are extras to be savored here including trailers, deleted scenes, one of the most boring behind the scenes features in DVD history, and a priceless interview with Wiseau. If you thought ""Manos"" was pass, ""The Room"" might be right up your alley, but don't say you weren't warned.",1406937600,7,4248,4.831043956043956

My wife enjoyed the movie in a literal sense, and actually describes this as a ""good"" movie.  While the acting is entirely non-traditional, there is a certain real-life/high school drama club/improvisational feeling pervading the movie that gives it an innocence otherwise not present in American movie culture today.  My favorite part of the movie is its ability to introduce sub-plots, characters and situations and then immediately discard them, never to be mentioned again.  Non-sequitur, abstract, dare I use the word ""random"" incidents throughout the movie give it flavor - they most certainly do not detract from the movie.  You never know what's going to happen next!  I've even followed ""The Room"" on the internet (memes, Top Ten lists and the like), and the ending SHOCKED me.  We have to watch it again!

Tommy Wiseau does an interview in the special features - he claims he would like to make more movies and I sincerely hope he finds the ability and time to do so!

You have to understand Wiseau (as much as any human can) to get why he's saying this. As revealed by Sestero in the excellent ""The Disaster Artist"" (required reading for any Room fan) Tommy Wiseau really, honestly felt like he was making his magnum opus here. Wiseau thought The Room was a movie where everyone could see reflections of their own lives, and the deep truths of reality. For the rest of us, we have no idea what truths he was aiming at, but that's not important- he thought he was on to something. So when Wiseau says he made this movie a ""black comedy"" (note that the quote on the box has no source, Tommy wrote all the movie's promo quotes himself.) So what Tommy really means is that he believes people are projecting their own insecurities on the film and that's why they're laughing, like a heroin addict watching a documentary about addiction would try to laugh it off because it hits too close to home. If your head is spinning, here's the short of it- Wiseau didn't fake The Room, and that's precisely why it's such a colossal and endearing flop.",1401926400,4,1241,4.491150442477876

2464584,5,B000CFYAMC,"For years, I've wanted to experience Tommy Wiseau's masterpiece.  It's one of those epic things one puts on his bucket list. Thanks to Amazon, this dream has now been fulfilled.

My wife and I watched it together last night.  Or at least we tried to. At ten minutes into the movie, she suddenly remembered she had to do her taxes or something, and left me alone to endure the next 89 agonizing minutes.  When the ordeal finally ended, I tried to ease the pain with a a glass of scotch mixed with vodka, and woke up in a hospital on Guerrero Street.  My conversation with the medical staff went like this:  ""You're my favorite patient, but leave your comments in your pocket.""  ""Oh hai doc, I didn't know it was you.  Keep the change.  That's me. Bye.""

Then my test results came back - I definitely have brain damage.  My wife said ""Ha Ha, what a story. Don't worry about it. Let's go home.""

Tommy Wiseau, you have altered my life. I can never again look at a football, a tuxedo, a spoon, a staircase, or a rose petal without having flashbacks of your magnum opus.  Or of your bare bottom.  Did you really have to film that scene in high definition video?

Heed my advice, gentle readers: This movie is toxic and may cause irreparable damage to your psyche. Once you've seen it, there is no turning back. You have been warned.

So why I am giving the movie five stars?  I don't want to talk about it!",1396828800,,1401,4.347490347490347
2464585,1,B000CFYAMC,"Wow!  What a dog!  Not only is the acting reminiscient of a poorly made porno film but the plot is even less complicated than the average brainless soap opera.  Ok, a guy thinks he's got the love of his life in his hands but he's wrong. Original?  They are about to be married.  She--a typical sociopathic borderline personality type with great breasts--has other ideas and love interests, namely our hero's best friend.  Sound familiar?  Mundane even?  Silly stuff.  Of course hero's best friend tries his best (which isn't too convincing) to resist the engaged seductress, but (not much of a surprise) he succumbs to her limited charms and  well, you know the rest.  Nothing too remarkable or surprising either about Johnny's suicide (hey, how about that Heinz 57 looking blood on the pillow?).  Soap opera at its worst.  And how about that game of ""toss the football"" between the male hero and anatagonist and teen drifter living off of Johnny in the same apartment building?  Dialogue is atrocious: ""I love you, Christ, I love you!  Doesn't that count for something, Lisa?  I mean, come on, you are my life, Lisa.  I cannot live without you.""
  A black comedy?  I certainly missed the black humor.  The only thing that's really remotely funny is just how bad this film is, and that may, incidentally, explain the film's so-called cult status.  But if you love bad movies, check out ""All for Love,"" Peter Bogdonivich's bomb that is actually better than ""The Room""!  Everyone in ""The Room""--and I mean everyone--is reading off a script.  Johnny, our hero, looks totally drug-induced throughout the entire performance and for heaven's sake: what's so sinister about the room?",1396137600,3,1676,4.9035714285714285
2464586,5,B000CFYAMC,"When I purchased Tommy Wiseau's The Room, I full well knew what I was getting. I was getting a film so revolutionary, so meaningful, and so profound that it would stay with me for the rest of my life on this planet. In a movie that was clearly meant to revolutionize the film genre, it accomplished its goal. I look at Tommy Wiseau's masterpiece like this. If the person you loved was really a cheating liar, how would you feel? Tommy Wiseau illustrated how one would react if this were to happen to them in his/her life.

During the 100 minutes in which I was watching The Room, two questions constantly arose in my mind. Can I really trust the one I love? Did Tommy Wiseau know what was going on in my life and try to warn me in a subtle way? These questions have stayed with me since I watched the film and I continue to ponder this. Sleepless nights have become of this and it has really made me think.

The Room also stands as a strong antithesis against feminism. The character, Lisa, defies all boundaries that a so-called ""feminist"" would analyze this move unto. I believe that Wiseau wrote Lisa into this story to show how feminism is a failed ideology and how women are the foundation of all problems. Myself, being a right-wing conservative, agrees with Wiseau's idea to input an anti-feminist character into the movie. It really is a spectacle.

No movie before has made me look at my life in such a nihilistic way. What really matters when the one you love does not reciprocate the same feeling back to you? Nothing. This movie has had such an effect on my life that I started to contact my loved ones to see how they were. What if my mom had breast cancer that was never addressed? What if my teenage best friend was secretly a drug addict and was having trouble paying back an illicit drug trafficker? What if my best friend threatened to throw my other best friend off of a building stemming from accusations of an affair with my fiancee? What if when we played football in tuxedos, there was never any real meaning to this at all? These are questions that The Room will induce on you and ponder the real question of life, ""Can you really trust anyone?""",1396051200,,2169,4.431077694235589

For those that haven't seen it, imagine a main character that has the emotional complexity, and people skills of a 13 year old boy raised by wolves, Skeletor looks, with a greasy black mane, and short arms that somehow just don't match the rest of his body.  Now imagine his love interest, a dead ringer for Courtney Love's younger, less stable sister.  Surround these central characters with equally unappealing, mentally delayed, supporting actors/actresses who speak only in simple, declarative sentences, and you have the makings of ""The Room"".

The main characters area nosy old lady, a sociopath girlfriend, a Neanderthal, a Wayne Gretzky look alike, and a creepy and squirrelly college aged guy. There are drugs, sex, fighting, ridiculous chicken impressions, and tossing a football arounda lot of tossing a football around. So much tossing a football around, I am surprised the football wasn't in the credits.

With my wife out of town on a business trip, and with me having to cancel a trip to LA due to ridiculous amounts of snow in NY, I spent my bitterly lonely Valentine's Day with only ""The Room"" the room for company.  When it was over, I did not feel lonely at all.  My heart now sings praise to this movie, which made my otherwise solitary evening, an exercise in joy.

""The Room"" is a laugh-a-minute disaster.  Intended by Tommy Wiseau, its star/writer/director/producer, to combine the passion of a Tennessee Williams play with the gut-punch drama of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", ""The Room"" instead is a disjointed series of non-sequiturs, brought to life with the most inexperienced cast and limpest production values imaginable.  Wiseau, who resembles that one vampire who was most decidedly NOT given the secret of perpetual youth to go along with his eternal life, is done no favors by the high-definition release -- but that, perversely, makes ""The Room"" look even better.

Johnny, a benevolent man pushing age 50 who inexplicably surrounds himself with people less than half his age, is meant to be a tragic hero -- betrayed by his protege (who dabbles in drugs), his girlfriend (a game actress named Juliette Danielle, who was very wise to drop her last name for the production) and his best friend (played by Greg Sestero, who survived the production ordeal to write ""The Disaster Artist"", one of the funniest memoirs ever published).  Everything Johnny does in this movie comes back to bite him.  The fact that he looks even more ghastly in HD, only helps to sell the joke that is Johnny.

""The Room"" takes place mostly on the ground floor of Johnny's impossibly small duplex, decorated with pictures of spoons.  The upstairs bedroom is used for soft-core love scenes that even Cinemax would be embarrassed to air, and the building's rooftop has a stairwell that magically changes places.  Each conversation is disjointed, with the dialogue (40% of which is greetings and salutations -- ""Oh, hi, Mark!"") truly befitting an author who learned English as a third language.  The female characters in the film all fail the Bechdel test so badly that you'd think the whole point of the screenplay was to flip off the estimable Ms. Bechdel in the first place.

This movie rose to cult status when a critic when a critic wrote of it, ""Watching this movie is like being stabbed in the head.""  But that's not true at all.  This movie is a gift that keeps on giving.  It is the cure for whatever ails you and it is impossible to come away without feeling better about yourself.  No matter how bad your life was before you pressed ""play"", when the end credits roll, you will feel so much better about yourself, because there is only one Johnny in this world, and you're not him.",1392422400,2,2792,4.721649484536083
2464601,2,B000CFYAMC,"Who knows Tom Wiseau could be a kind and intelligent person.  But this film just shows him to be laughably vain and naive. It reminds me in a way of the kid with the light saber on youtube or more so that person at work who is loud and missing something upstairs.  As with those instances I got to admit I got a good chuckle out of seeing someone act like an idiot.  Afterward felt a bit cruel but still getting enjoyment out of someone embarrassing themselves.  But I am sure Mr. Wiseau is a strong enough person to handle the smirks and people laughing at him and not with.  (in fact in the interview that is an extra on this he makes a good point.  He ""finished"" the film.  sure its a mess but its much more than those who didn't have the balls to try cough cough...me-best i got was a few 3 minutes movies-and man that was rough).  Anyways enough pompous reflecting.  If you are here you are someone that enjoys bad movies and as bad movies go this one is ok.  The part early on that turns in to a softcore porn film with cheesy supermarket music is not fun but after that its gaffe city and humorous.  In fact in its clumsiness and vanity it becomes in someways more interesting than your run of the mill , ""just ok"" movie or tv show.  [perhaps some of these really bad movies are more entertaining than the bunch bland films out there.  Its too bad MST3000 never got to give a commentary to Lord of the Rings etc. ]  .

As an added note, I must confess I went to film school and did not do very well. In fact I had one short instructional documentary that got lots of unintentional laughs.  I definitely didn't mind the laughter but I do remember me and my classmates acknowledging very quickly that something as simple as a very short instructional video was a tough accomplishment.  20 years later I tried making short films again and one of the results was much like The Room (bad dialogue, no continuity etc).

2464602,5,B000CFYAMC,"In yesteryear, supremacy was measured by legions and dreadnoughts, ICBMs and treasury bonds (Hello Beijing). That dynamic changed forever with the release of The Room.  Hegemony is now contingent upon the allegiances of Tommy Wiseau, despot and demiurge. Much like the carpenter's son, it's not surprising that Wikipedia is hazy on his birthdate: this guy is not mere flesh and blood. One wonders whether the Bright Star of the Morning contributed to his parentage. Bush's invasion of Iraq would have been justified if Wiseau had been filming in Baghdad at the time. Parachute him into the Balkans and he would be a latter-day Gavrilo Princip.

As The Room makes clear, Wiseau is more destructive than Anton Chigurh, the terminator from No Country for Old Men. There's nothing sanguinary here but the body-bags amass - sanity, aesthetics and faith: they're annihilated one and all. True, Wiseau's acting is more wooden than Sherwood Forest but that's a trap for the unwary; exposure to his non sequiturs, gaudy sex-scenes and semi-intelligible dialogue leads to dementia, ""hydraulic challenges"" and dysentery. Coming off a low base, I shed at least fifty IQ-points in the opening scene alone. The cast are mere asteroids compare with this cosmic phenomenon. Wiseau comes. He sees. He destroys. He is 666 on steroids. It's amazing that foliage does not wither when he comes into range.

If you're planning to so something with your life, if you believe in a higher order of things, if family means anything to you, avoid The Room like the pox.",1392336000,2,1542,5.03921568627451

This film leaves the conventional at the door and never picks it back up. This roller coaster of emotion will have you begging to reach the finale.

Guys, before you go thinking this is another chick-flick your girlfriend is going to force you to watch let me clue you in. This movie is jam packed with sports,  gritty violence, and gang activity.

I am not sure that there is anything to get, but what you will realize early on is that this movie is much more than bad acting, wooden dialogue or the horrible imitation of human interaction  its an experience. And just like you're never the same after witness something like a horrible car crash or a delicate flower growing through the concrete, the room will change you.

Characteristic of the transcendental nature of Tommy Wiseaus tour-de-force is its following consisting of people who, almost religiously, have started attending screenings of the movie on a regular basis and practicing rituals on cues from the movie. Throwing spoons at the screen, yelling ""SPOON"" whenever the picture frame with the spoon appears in the background, cheer on the camera during one of the many Golden Gate Bridge shots shouting ""GO, GO, GO!"" or clap along to the music during the sex scenes.

Oh, the terribleness.

I can't even imagine what it is like to wake up every day being Tommy Wiseau. I don't understand anything at all, about anything i thought i understood, thanks to this film. Its like that doctor played by Bill Murray in the ""Royal Tennenbaums"", who has that young patient who rearranges those Rorsach psychology blocks in shapes that look nothing like they are supposed to? Like that.

There is literally nothing I can say that can explain how a film with such a benign overdone plot (man betrayed by his harlot wife) could possibly be this awful. You really couldn't even accept it even if managed to invent new words to explain it and wrote a dictionary on top of it. You would need EQUIPMENT, bar graphs, maybe some whiskey, to even get close. Its one of them existential things. You gotta go live it.

So, yeah. I know you think you know something about bad films because you saw ""Plan 9"" that one time. You think its gonna be a normal, terrible, cult classic.

But I'm not here to talk about the movie.  I'm just focusing on the Blu-ray specifically.
The transfer is.. mostly pretty good.  There are still a few shots out of focus, but that's the source material.  What bothers me is that there were three or four instances of there being missing frames.  It would be playing along normally, then the motion would jump forward a tiny bit.  These are very short errors.  I rewound a little, and played those bits a few times to make sure that it wasn't a playback issue.

Most of the characters do not behave like normal human beings, and the ones that do make scenes very awkward. The events do not progress in a logical way, and the end comes out of nowhere.

2464619,5,B000CFYAMC,"This film has so many things going on in it to distract you, it will simply take several viewings to digest all of the elements and stitch them together in your mind.  For instance, who is Tommy Wiseau? Is he actually 214 years old? What is that accent - Fregermandussian? When you finally acknowledge that he was hatched here in a pod and is studying human habits and trying to adapt to them and apply what he has learned to filmmaking, then you can appreciate this masterpiece.
You see, I like cinema that makes me think.  This film would be a frustrating mess if it wasn't so happy with such a driving under current of goofiness.  This movie has so many things to cheer you up - it deserves a humanitarian award of some kind.  How many films can involve topics like infidelity, orphans, drugs, and suicide and leave you soiling yourself with laughter?  It has everything - the contorted, troglodyte frame of its star, a 10 square foot rooftop patio, guns, roses, and a mysterious and uncomfortable game of football played in tuxedos where the people playing are quite literally 6 feet from each other.  This is the first dvd I have ever gotten that left me exploring every extra feature on the disk - I had to know more - everything about this film.

He pushed Lisa (the character) down twice, and after his fight with Mark he asked Lisa to clean it up.

2464630,1,B000CFYAMC,"Now that I have seen The Room, I believe that there are sentient life forms on other planets.  And one of those life forms is Tommy Wiseau, the writer/producer/director/star/overall creator of this cinematic train wreck.

For reasons of his own, Mr. Wiseau (clearly a pseudonym, as his name is probably something like ""Glarzk"") has chosen to infiltrate our culture with this bizarre and awful movie drama, but it falls terribly short of fooling the audience into believing an actual human created it.

I suspected that Mr. Wiseau, playing Johnny, was an alien when I heard his first line, a greeting delivered in a gargling accent to his girlfriend Lisa.  Like every single line in the movie, it sounds unnatural and forced.  All too soon, Johnny sheds his clothing for a long lovemaking session with Lisa.  The scene is made painful by the unpleasant sight of his body, with strangely rippled skin stretched too tight over not-quite-human musculature.  Sadly, the unwitting viewer is exposed to several extended and repulsive nude scenes during the film.

Even more than his weird accent and body, the movie itself proves his alien origins.  Only someone raised on another planet would think that the dialogue and interactions between characters are remotely believable.  The limited cast must have been put under some kind of mind control spell by Mr. Wiseau, which would explain the actors' acceptance of absurd lines and their wooden delivery.  Even worse than the ""acting"" is the horrible melodramatic storyline propelled by icky characters.  It is like watching a soap opera made in hell.

The only redeeming quality of this movie is the opportunity to make fun of it afterward.  It is bewilderingly bad from beginning to end.",1384128000,10,1732,5.052816901408451

Some things are so bad that they're funny. But some other things are equally bad without being funny at all and that's what this movie is.

Hipster college students attend midnight showings and throw spoons as a way of telling the world that they know the difference between good art and bad.

The movie is bad because the actor/writer/producer is borderline mentally ill. Where's the humor in that? If you go the Special Olympics to laugh, you might enjoy this movie.

It's odd that somebody so troubled had the money to make his own movie. Yes, it's odd, but ultimately too sad to be funny and too boring to be amusing.

I do find some aspects of the movie to be funny. The scene where Lisa talks about Johnny's pecs. I'm sorry even if Tommy Wiseau is muscular I don't understand how anyone can find him attractive. The writing for this movie is atrocious and very unnatural. One thing I've learned from this movie is that you can't do everything and do it all well. I think this movie would have been better if Tommy Wiseau didn't star in it. Someone better looking and more talented should have starred as Johnny. Then again the movie needs better actors and actresses period. The songs in this movie are very cringeworthy at best and horrendous at worst. I find very few bad movies entertaining. Some of them are fun to watch others are so stupid I feel stupid watching them and the majority of bad movies are very boring and forgettable.

2464638,5,B000CFYAMC,"What is The Room, you ask? A very fair question, but this review can't answer it. Mainly because watching the movie itself doesn't answer it. In fact, The Room will leave you with quite a few more questions than answers - not the least of which, I guarantee, will be ""What the hell did I just watch?"" - but that's part of the fun.

The 2003 film, which is written by, directed by, produced by, and starring Tommy Wiseau, is perhaps best described as an enigma wrapped in a riddle wrapped in a really, really terrible movie. But don't let that scare you off. It's been called ""the best worst movie of all time,"" and rightfully so.

In crafting The Room, Wiseau took basic building blocks like story, character development, and even dialogue - and put them through a garbage disposal. The film tells the story of Johnny (if you're waiting for a last name, don't hold your breath - none of the characters get one), a successful banker engaged to the beautiful Lisa. Their life together seems perfect, until Lisa begins an affair with Johnny's best friend Mark.

Oh, and Johnny also has a surrogate son in his young neighbor Denny, who finds himself mixed up in the world of drugs. Lisa's mother has breast cancer and a brother who's trying to steal her house away from her. Johnny's being denied a promotion at work despite ""saving them bundles."" Lisa's own business is ""too competitive"" and causing her problems. Johnny has a psychologist friend who discovers Marks' secret. Lisa falsely accuses Johnny of domestic abuse behind his back. Believe it or not, it's actually much, much more incoherent than it sounds.

Wiseau's script - and more to the point, his acting - may make you question whether he's ever had an actual conversation with another human being in his life. Between the non sequiturs (""[My bank's new client] is confidential, I cannot tell you that. Anyway, how's your sex life?""), the characters' sudden mood swings (""It's bullsh*t, I did not hit her! I did not! Oh, hi, Mark.""), and yes, the spontaneous chicken impressions (""Cheeeep-cheep-cheep-cheep-cheeeeep!""), the film is a veritable cornucopia of magnificent nonsense.

The rest of the cast aren't quite on Wiseau's level of ridiculousness. But Lisa is played by an actress who was literally found on the street after the first several actresses cast quit, and Mark is played by Wiseau's real-life friend and line producer for the movie after the first actor cast - you guessed it - quit. It's a recipe for cinematic disaster, and the finished product doesn't disappoint.

But again, this review is meant not to deter, but to encourage you to experience The Room. Aside from being a truly awful film, it's also incredibly entertaining, not to mention quotable. You'll find yourself greeting friends with an enthusiastic ""Oh, hi!"" and telling rude people to ""leave your stupid comments in your pocket!"" And for those moments when someone betrays you, someone who is part of your life, who is everything, who you could not go on without? Just remember the movie's most famous, most memorable line, and be sure to deliver it with the proper arm-pumping anguish: ""You are tearing me apart, Lisa!""",1378771200,2,3164,4.85
2464639,5,B000CFYAMC,"This movie sucks in all the best ways and makes me laugh my head off.  It exhausts me by the end from laughing so hard.  Greg Sestero's book about his experiences making this film is coming out in a few months, but the way I imagine it happening is so much funnier and painful considering the final product.  Do yourself a favor and look up some interviews with the cast members after the fact, especially the female co-star.

I once had a planned bad movie double feature night with The Dark Backward and this movie.  After the first movie, no one had any energy to continue on to the second movie except me. So, I watched it and knew nothing about it beforehand.  I was flabbergasted at how bad and funny the movie was made.  I still feel it deserves to be the second part of a double feature, though.  There's no way another movie could follow this one.  If you don't get it, or embrace how bad the movie truly is after the first viewing, please watch it once more knowing that all the mistakes are still in there and that Tommy Wiseau is up there trying to do Tennessee Williams-style southern melodrama. Better yet, catch one of the special showings of it when they come through your town.  Listening to choruses of people reciting the horrible dialogue just makes it overpoweringly hilarious and somehow precious.

Yes, the man on the cover is the romantic lead and gives a bizarrely zoned out performance throughout this.  Yes, the acting throughout is bad making this very funny to watch.  Keep in mind this movie was made with millions of dollars and should have been made for hundreds of  thousands of dollars.

2464661,5,B000CFYAMC,"It seems like only yesterday that dozens of my Facebook friends were insisting that I *had* to see THE ROOM, describing it as the most brilliantly atrocious film in the history of the solar system. I was skeptical, having already seen PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, GLEN OR GLENDA, ROBOT MONSTER, BATTLEFIELD EARTH, and other masterpieces which Derek Jacobi as Claudius would have quite aptly applauded as ""indescribable"". However, on the suggestion of my son -- who'd previously been to a midnight screening of THE ROOM and was planning to attend another one this month -- I viewed clips of it on YouTube and was so genuinely awed by their sheer ""je ne sais (pour)quoi"" that I realized my friends were right. I immediately logged onto Amazon and ordered the DVD.

Counting the hours and minutes till THE ROOM arrived here was -- well, tearing me apart. Fortunately Amazon sent the DVD quite promptly. When I opened the package with trembling hands, I knew instinctively that I was holding the key to one of the most mind-blowing experiences of my life. At first I had to conceal the purchase from my husband, who couldn't understand why seeing THE ROOM in its entirety was so crucial to my continued health, wellbeing, and sanity. Not wanting to end up in a hospital on Guerrero Street, I thought of a clever ruse. Approaching him in an agitated state, I threw a water bottle on the floor and yelled, ""I did not buy the movie! It's not true! It's bullsh*t! I did not buy the movie! I did NOT! Oh hi Richard!"" But it didn't work. He told me to leave my stupid comments in my pocket and just admit that I went behind his back and ordered a DVD of THE ROOM. Eventually we ended up watching it together, and since then neither of us has ever regretted those 99 haunting, hypnotic, magical minutes (plus the equally haunting, hypnotic, and magical bonus interview with Tommy).

I notice that one of the other Amazon reviewers described THE ROOM as ""life-changing""; indeed, that applies in my case as well. Now when I walk down the street, go to the supermarket, or ride the subway, scenes from THE ROOM randomly pop into my head and I break into hysterical laughter for no apparent reason, eliciting worried looks from the people around me who think I've gone nuts. Yet in a way I am doing the world a service, by being a living example of Tommy's profound message that ""you can laugh, you can cry, you can express yourself, but please don't hurt each other."" And really, isn't that what life should be all about? I wholeheartedly believe that if everyone played football in tuxedos, limited their flower shop transactions to 19 seconds, drank scotchka, and included creepy teenage voyeurs in three-way pillow fights before having passionate navel sex with their lover under a leaky bedroom ceiling, the world would be a happier place -- and Tommy could finally return as a true spiritual hero to his hometown, on whatever planet that happens to be.",1375142400,18,2939,4.671814671814672

Wiseau, whose origins are as unknown as the rumored City of Atlantis, plays the epically good fianc/best friend/banker/favorite customer Johnny. After countless hours of making whoopee to his bloated wife-to-be, Lisa, for what seemed like eons, she has become disinterested in her upcoming nuptials with Johnny and is hell bent on finding her own groove in life - even if that means cheating with Johnny's best friend, the spotty-bearded Mark.

The story is a love triangle between a woman, her fianc and his best friend.  You may have seen stories like this a hundred times; but you've never seen one told this way.  That's what makes the film so enjoyable; if it had just been a standard love triangle done by an ordinary director then it would have been lifeless and dull.  In Tommy Wiseau's incompetent hands it becomes a legend.

2464699,4,B000CFYAMC,"Nine Things About the Movie ""The Room""

1. Oh hi!

2. Before I saw this film for the first time, all I really knew is that some critic called it ""the Citizen Kane of bad movies"". I thought the hyperbole was amusing. But whoever the critic was, they were dead right. That's the only way to describe this jaw-dropping cinematic black hole.

3. This is supposed to be a romantic drama about a man engaged to a woman who doesn't love him anymore and who starts sleeping with his best friend.

4. Like ""Citizen Kane"", this movie is the brainchild of one man. Tommy Wiseau wrote, produced, directed, and stars in it. And like Orson Welles, this is Wiseau's first film. But it's the anti-matter version. For everything that Welles did brilliantly, Wiseau does idiotically. It's like Wiseau (who obviously has a thing for Tennessee Williams) took a crash course in filmmaking... and misunderstood every lesson.

5. Wiseau also clearly has a thing for Tennessee Williams. He consciously tries to imitate the feel and story themes of the famous playwright. Too bad he makes a complete mockery of things.

6. Let me make this perfectly clear. There are not just a couple of things wrong with this movie, there are literally hundreds. From the acting, to the script, to the technical production, the whole thing is like an atom bomb waiting to go off. An atom bomb made of spoons.

7. There is no way to adequately describe this film. The main star, Wiseau, has the body and and acting ability of a reanimated corpse. Now combine that with the dialogue's rampant non-sequiturs, the anonymous characters, the plot holes big enough to throw footballs through, and the apartment's mysterious doorways.

8. This movie must be experienced to be appreciated. It makes you feel drunk or stoned, even when you are totally sober. It will be tearing you apart before you know it.

9. The Room is famous in underground cinema circles, and has attracted a cult following not seen since The Rocky Horror Picture Show,  For better or worse, your life will not be the same once you've seen it.",1366502400,3,2066,4.713888888888889

2464742,5,B000CFYAMC,"What can be said about The Room that hasn't been said before? It is the most amazing piece of garbage I have ever seen. What makes this so great is the fact that, despite his insistence to the contrary, Tommy Wiseau tried hard to make a good drama. And he failed miserably.

I could regale you with a long winded boringly over the top review of one of the greatest modern classics of our time but then i would have to type this under a different film. The Room looks deep in to your soul and pulls your heart out through your eyes. Johnny is an everyman character that is easily relatable and when he falls, you fall with him.

Lisa plays her role perfectly and if you are like me then you have met a few Lisa's in your life. Why must life be so hard and why must Johnny live this way? Mark who plays his best friend is exactly how my best friend currently is. Which has now got me thinking about the time he spent time on my staircase and my girlfriend wasn't around. Man they love stairs.

Denny who plays Johnny's faux adopted son is masterfully executed and I hope a sequel comes out and begins with Denny's acceptance to chef school. Denny not only wants to borrow butter, sugar, milk and eggs he also wants to borrow his way in to your heart. And after the time I spent with him I would say I am now full...on love.

I am not going to talk about Lisa's mom so I am not sure why I even brought it up.

If you deliberately set out to make the worst movie ever put on film, you could not do a much better job than The Room. And not in spite of, but because of, this massive pile of horrendous, The Room is one of my favorites. I laughed almost literally nonstop.

My life BTR (before The Room) was a very good one filled with a getting a degree, experiencing love, gaining and losing friends that I'll forever cherish, and some drinking as well. This ATR phase I've been stuck in since 2008, however, has been absolutely insane.

I haven't been unable to trust ANYONE since this film's intricate (and heartbreaking) plot unfurled before my own two eyes. For good reason, too. Even if I become as good of a person as Johnny was, what's going to stop the people I love from hurting and ultimately betraying me in the end? Every conversation I have with my mother could be punctuated with a confirmation of having breast cancer. And playing a game of catch with a football? Forget it. God forbid the person I'm playing with trips and falls, because they'll be (written) out of my life forever.

Tommy Wiseau, your masterpiece has put me in a downward spiral of depression and anxiety. It sounds like a curse, but I am forever grateful for showing me just how corrupt and evil the other people in our lives can be.

2464746,5,B000CFYAMC,"The Room is a terrible movie. Truly and completely horrible. The script is awful, the story inane, the editing incompetent and the ""acting"" is beyond cringe-worthy (and don't get me started on the soundtrack or the needless use of green screen). Director/Writer/Star Tommy Wiseau had no idea what he was doing when he made this movie, and it's evident in every single scene. The whole thing reeks of misplaced confidence and Wiseau's ego. This should be shown in film classes the world over as a prime example of how NOT to make a film. You should avoid it at all costs.

That said, I love it just the same. And I'm not sure I can even explain why. There's nothing good about it. But something about the level of incompetence and sheer ham-fisted execution draws me in, and I find myself watching it more often than is probably healthy or sane. Wiseau's bizarre accent (French, with a touch of god knows what) makes nearly every one of his melodramatically delivered lines endlessly quotable (""You're tearing me apart, Lisa!""). Scenes whose dialogue was voiced-over and overlaid in the wrong place make for unintended hilarity. The main character's girlfriend, Lisa, is a completely unsympathetic character, giving you the perfect focus for all the anger, rage, and confusion you'll feel when watching this disaster of a movie.

However, it reaches bad cinema nirvana by its pure narcissism, it created by Wisseu as a showcase for his skills and make him a star, its schlocky, soap opera melodrama, and hilarious lines, as well as the technical weirdness: Wisseu's accent is so think, some scenes are obviously redubbed and no one worried about the lipsync, for example.

2464766,2,B000CFYAMC,"When a movie is labeled as one of the ""worst films of all time,"" you don't go into it expecting much. The Room (2003), which director, actor, writer, and executive producer Tommy Wiseau describes as a black comedy, which parallels the lives of all Americans, is a misguided attempt at a deeply poignant film. Comical acting, ridiculous lines, ill-synced dubbing, and an exceptional amount of very noticeable mistakes throughout the movie, take away from the deeply moving experience the director intended; though, due to these outrageous film faux pas the movie has been ushered into the obsessive, elaborate, and flourishing subculture of cult fandom. Though holding true to its reputation, The Room offers slightly more than memorably bad quotes and painfully awkward love scenes: the movie depicts archetypes of morality and questions the depth of trust and friendship.
 Johnny (Wiseau) is a man who has everything in life -a great job in which he is the likely candidate for a promotion, an adoring fianc Lisa (Danielle) with whom he is madly in love with, and a close group of friends that he trusts completely. Shortly into the movie, it becomes apparent that he is nave to the deceit that is infesting itself in those he trusts most. Lisa, who has grown up with a dysfunctional gold-digging mother, is selfish, manipulative, and mendacious. One cannot help but despise both of her double personalities. She seduces Johnny's best friend, Mark (Sestero) and ensnares him into a web of lies and emotional turmoil. As Mark and Lisa continue their affair and more people know, the intrapersonal relationships of all the characters become more strained under the guilt of deceiving Johnny. Suspicious that Lisa is being unfaithful, Johnny begins to investigate and prod his friends for answers. The man who has everything begins to see his life crashing down before him as he realizes the relationships in his life are empty and malicious: whom can he really trust?
  The Room is truncated in almost every element; the audience is overwhelmed with plot, but offered very little story. The acting is almost purposefully bad, and the characters unrelatable. In the film, Lisa's mother non-chalantly announces she has breast cancer and almost in the same breath tells her daughter she should go on with a loveless engagement because she is unable to support herself. Lisa seems entirely unconcerned with her mother's diagnosis and the conversation continues normally. Blatant mistakes, and recycling of scenes draw the attention even further from the message the movie was intended to convey: the consequences of malicious actions, the contrast of societal ethics, and the potential falsehood of trust. The two main protagonists are meant to have the greatest contrast of ethics; Johnny is societal ideal and knocked from his pedestal by Lisa, representing the skewed ideals and self-serving behavior plaguing this country. It was Wiseau's intention to ignite a profound sense of betrayal in the audience similar to the climax of William Shakespeare's tragic Julius Caesar. Though, lacking the eloquence of Shakespeare and disappointing in delivery, ""Y tu Brute?"" resonates in the climax of the film. Wiseau asks one of life's real and most asked questions, are people really to be trusted and is this age the death of innocence?
 With a few additional writers, a team of editors, and a greater attention to detail The Room would have had more of a chance to be received as the dark emotional account of love and betrayal it was intended to be. As it is, it is worth watching for whatever you may get out of it -even if you don't watch it ""at least twice"" as Wiseau prescribes.

1 - Simply awful

That's right, I said ALL generations! Tommy Wiseau's cinematic masterpiece, The Room, is a one of a kind experience that will never be equaled. It's a story of friendship, love, betrayal, football, chocolate (the symbol of love), football, chickens (cheep cheep cheep cheep), drugs, and football. Made in 2003, The Room changed the way people watched movies and saw the world forever!

Johnny (played by writer/director/producer/executive producer/star Tommy Wiseau) is a successful banker living in San Francisco with his fiance Lisa (Juliette Danielle, who will go down in history as one of the greatest movie villains of all time). But Lisa is bored with Johnny and need some excitement. So she decides to have a fling with Johnny's best friend Mark (Greg Sestero, who's previous credit includes his Oscar nominated performance as Andre Toulon in the 1999 box office smash, Retro Puppet Master), much to Mark's charging. Meanwhile, Johnny's ward, Denny (Philip Haldiman) is dealing with the burden of growing up and dealing in drugs. Also meanwhile, Lisa's mother, Claudette (Carolyn Minnott, who's understated performance will bring tears to your eyes) must come face to face with her own mortality when she discovers she definitely has breast cancer.

The key to this entire story of course is Mr. Wiseau himself. this is a man who's facial expression says ""Where am I?"" He sports a physique that makes one say ""I think he works out, but he could also be a reanimated corpse."" There has never been a performance like this, nor will there ever be. Wiseau makes Sir Laurence Olivier look like a crazy homeless guy; I guarantee you that sometime soon you'll be hearing of Mr. Wiseau being knighted because he's just that awesome. You will never see a movie with more quotable lines, or grown men tossing around the old football like this movie. Some may question just why this movie is called The Room, when it clearly takes place in multiple locations. You see, the title is referring to the room in which you the viewer are watching this masterpiece of a film. The movie is subtly telling you that you must escape your world of slacking about and eating junk food, and must go out and play some football.

I have yet to get this film on Blu-ray, but I think I'll wait for the price to go down for a little. I don't think there's a commentary by the majestic Wiseau, and that's just a darn shame as the man is an enigma wrapped in a mystery wrapped in a conundrum wrapped in a tuna and peanut butter sandwich. But remember folks, never watch this movie alone, have one or more friends with you. That's right, this movie is so emotional and mind blowing, that to not have emotional support around you will cause you to explode!",1360540800,13,2890,4.6942800788954635

The movie is, as many here have said, unintentionally hilarious. Like all good ""bad"" movies, there can't be any cynicism from the creator of the film. Everything has to be genuine, and in this case it is. Wiseau believes in the movie and that is what makes all the difference. If these people were making a bad movie on purpose, I would probably say skip it. But because they are trying and failing so spectacularly it is something magical, perhaps even mystical.

Every once in a while you are given a gift from God. This is one of them for aficianados of bad movies. I do recommend watching it with the Rifftrax commentary at some point, as it is easily one of their best efforts. Though it must be said that most of the material writes itself.

I read an interview with Juliette Danielle (Lisa) and she seems to be a lovely woman with a great sense of humor about her role in one of the worst movies made in the last 50 years. That's the good thing about this movie, it's SO weird and bad and hiliarous that you actually end up finding the people in it endearing in an odd way.

2464769,5,B000CFYAMC,"Generally when one discusses cinema, they look for achievement in a variety of subjects. Some look to directing, others writing and many acting. It is very rare that someone is able to gain fame in more than one of those departments, let alone all three. However, Tommy Wiseau has gained such a legacy due to the extreme notoriety he gained from only one film, The Room, and he deserves every bit of it.
 The Room is a film that, without fail, comes up in any conversation about the worst film of all time. Released in 2003, The Room began life as a play written by Wiseau that he couldn't get published. The film was finally produced by Wiseau himself and the movie opened to little positive reaction. However, over the next several years the film gained popularity simply because of how awful it was. Rocky Horror Picture Show-style screenings became popular as audience members openly mocked the film in theaters. To this day, the film has become the Citizen Kane for those who love terrible movies, and that's all because of Tommy Wiseau's acting, directing and writing.
 As one of those lovers of awful films, I approached The Room with no small amount of hesitation, asking myself if it could even possibly live up to its terrible reputation. However, after watching the film, I was pleased to discover that yes, it truly was atrocious beyond imagination, and I couldn't be more pleased about that.
 The train wreck that is this film is due in no small part to its delusional conductor, Tommy Wiseau. Not only is he the star and protagonist of the film, he also took over the directing role, after he wrote the screenplay all himself of course. It is clear through his involvement at each one of these levels that he truly had issue with women, seeing them all has untrustworthy and selfish. Even his character's best friend who is romantically involved with Wiseau's girlfriend is portrayed as the victim and hardly responsible for any of the events through the film. It is hard to distinguish where the character of Johnny begins and Tommy Wiseau ends as this was clearly written in response to a wrong Wiseau must have felt he experienced in his own life.
 While his writing may be rooted in some level of misguided misogyny, it also contains a hysterical amount of repetition. After watching this movie you and your friends will find yourself constantly greeting each other with ""Oh, hey,"" and ""Oh, hi.""
 While the characters are not exactly written with much depth, the actors don't do a fantastic job picking up the slack. Shockingly, the worst offender of poor acting is Wiseau himself. Most will find his odd delivery coupled with his baffling accent either incredibly quotable or simply unintelligible. However, all of this is only augmented by the fact that a large amount of the dialogue is clearly and poorly dubbed over.
 However, of all the failures and shortcomings of this film, the greatest comes in the form of its constantly evolving cast. Characters appear and disappear without reason. Someone who seems important may never return, while characters that play a large role later in the film arrive with no explanation. The cause of such odd behavior was that so many actors had issues with Wiseau that they quit the project entirely, and Wiseau chose not to reshoot their scenes. The disappearance of seemingly important characters only adds to the fun of this disaster.
 Despite all the joys that most of The Room's mistakes and inadequacies bring the viewers, there is one element that actually might bring pain to the viewer: the sex scenes. While the fact that several such scenes are thrown into the film add to its terribleness, the presence of Wiseau in them ruins any hope for the viewer to simply laugh at them because Wiseau's body, there is very little you won't see of it, will disturb almost all viewers with sight. It doesn't help that after his first sex scene ends, a second shortly follows, which borrows multiple shots from the first and uses them in the exact same order. The entire ordeal is a bizarre and uncomfortable experience.
 Not despite but because of its flaws, The Room maintains an important position within the history of cinema. Very few movies reach the low levels that Tommy Wiseau is able to and because of that, it should not be missed. It must be seen to be believed.",1359936000,,4331,4.765333333333333

2464787,3,B000CFYAMC,"I have never seen a movie quite like ""The Room"". When reviewing this movie I wish I could give it two different scores: an objective score, and a subjective score. This is the only movie I've ever seen that simultaneously gets a 1 and a 5 from, hence why I averaged my score to a 3. Why do I consider this both a trainwreck and a masterpiece? Well, fellow reader, let me explain.

""The Room"" is an independent movie made in 2003 by director/writer/producer/actor Tommy Wiseau. I have not even heard of this movie until last year (2012) and after hearing this movie quoted over and over I just had to see what the hype was about.

Let me get the objective part out of the way first. This is the single worst movie I have ever seen of all time.  Everything about it is a disaster. The acting, the production values, the settings, the story...everything. There is no reason anyone should ever watch this movie, and to be quite honest there is no reason for this movie to even exist, other than to fill the spot as ""the worst movie of all time."" I mean this movie doesn't even try to be good. Every single line is delivered with zero emotion and you almost need a translator to understand what the lead role character is saying. Each character is very one-dimensional. There are maybe only 4 sets being used so you are constantly seeing the same locations over and over. At one point I thought I was watching the Twilight Zone as the characters were having the same conversation over and over. It was very difficult to get through this movie without turning it off or falling asleep. And before you ask, yes it really is THAT bad.

But yet...I kept watching. And not only that, I watched it MULTIPLE TIMES. I started quoting the movie. Watching clips over and over. Listening to a dubstep mash-up of movie quotes. Watching parodies. Watching and reading reviews, most of which were very entertaining. This movie has become HILARIOUS to me. It was originally billed as a drama, but director/producer/writer/lead actor Tommy Wiseau saw how bad it bombed and quickly changed his words listing it as a ""black comedy"". With the right mindset this movie is hysterical. Most really bad movies tend to be so bad that I want to gouge my eyes out, but this movie is so far gone...so unbelievably unrealistic and bad, that it's funny. Just watch a few clips and you'll understand. Despite being an abysmally terrible movie, it has developed quite the cult following over the years. At first I thought those people were crazy. How can anyone like a movie so bad? Then I quickly realized the magic of it. It's not funny because the movie is full of jokes, the movie itself IS the joke. The movie is one giant punchline, with many self-contained punchlines thrown in for good measure. Practically every new scene is its own punchline. That's why I subjectively give this movie a perfect score.

Not everyone is going to see the magic of a movie this bad, and that's fine. Go watch it with an open mind and you'll enjoy it a lot more. Keep in mind this movie was initially supposed to be serious. So to sum it all up, it can best be described as the funniest, most entertaining trainwreck of a movie that has ever been caught on film.

2464800,5,B000CFYAMC,"Disclaimer: I'm giving this film five stars, and I genuinely enjoyed watching this film, but I've been known to have unusual tastes, and to enjoy things that are ""craptastic.""

I first heard of ""The Room"" through Rifftrax, the movie riffing group made up of former members of the team behind ""Mystery Science Theater 3000."" I love quirky, weird films, and this one did not disappoint me.

To give a brief plot synopsis: Johnny, played by auteur writer-director-producer-star Tommy Wiseau, a bank worker, is embroiled in a world of mistrust and intrigue as his fianc, Lisa, seems to be cheating on him. Along for the ride are his best friend, Mark, the strange man-child embroiled in drug deals, Denny, and Johnny's other friend, the psychologist Peter, who...sort of...just...kind of...goes away, after a while. Not to worry, though, some other guy (whose name escapes me...heck, I don't think it was even spoken) shows up and takes his place. Last but not least, Lisa's mother, Claudette, rounds out the cast, fighting off her moochy brother and a definite diagnosis of a terrible affliction (no spoilers here!) which, thankfully, she takes in stride...and I mean REALLY takes in stride, so much so that she barely reacts and it's never mentioned again.

What can I say? ""The Room"" is a strange, strange film. Characters show up and then disappear, never to be seen again. Subplots rise and fall like waves on the shore, fading off into the ocean of mystery that is ""The Room."" What does the title mean? I don't know. What exactly is Lisa's motivation? I don't know. Who hurt Tommy Wiseau so badly that he was inspired to make a film like this? Again, I don't know.

What I do know is that for all its flaws, and perhaps largely because of them, I love ""The Room.""

If I may be serious for just a moment, I will say this in the film's defense: the cinematography is competent, and despite all the flaws in the writing and bizarre, off-kilter acting, I was just a bit emotionally invested by the film's end, and the film's conclusion actually made me a little sad. I'm not sure if this is because, on at least some level, the film really worked as it was intended to, or if I just felt like the film was such a cry for help from Tommy Wiseau's subconscious that I wanted more of a resolution that let me know that he, in real life, is okay. Something about the film, for me, was strangely affecting, if only in a small way.

If I may now return to the silliness, let me assure you that there's plenty of it. Any description I give you here won't do it justice. The weirdness of some of the scenes (an example: suddenly everyone plays football, in tuxedos, in the middle of a parking lot, for absolutely no reason) is memorable...and hilarious. The dialogue is equally hysterical, causing things like ""OH HI, MARK!"" to become part of the viewer's vocabulary.

It really has to be seen to be believed. If you love weird or so-bad-it's-good films, then ""The Room"" might be right up your alley...especially if you play football in that alley while sharing anecdotes about ""me underwears."" (Don't ask. Just watch.)",1357516800,3,3109,4.6727605118829985
2464801,5,B000CFYAMC,A necessity for the Tommy Wiseau fan in your life. Got this for a friend for Christmas and couldn't be happier. The bonus features are an awesome touch to make an already fantastic movie that much better,1357430400,,203,4.513513513513513
2464802,5,B000CFYAMC,"The Room is a timeless classic, and easily one of the most fascinating movies of all time. Visionary director/writer/producer/actor Tommy Wiseau stars as tragic hero, Johnny, in this unique tale of a man's world falling apart within ""a special place, a private place, a place where you can be safe"". It's not just a room, but THE ROOM!! . It begs the questions: ""Can you really trust anyone?"" and of course, ""How is your sex life?""

Having met, acted, and even tossed a football around with Tommy, I can attest that he is a truly wonderful man, worthy of your support. The Room was meant to be seen in high definition, as it was one of the earliest films to be shot with an HD camera. The difference is clear on blu-ray, and considering that certain segments were shot with a 35mm camera the comparison is now noticeable. The sound quality is also improved, and certain lines are given more clarity, some can be heard for the first time. The soundtrack, with its unforgettable theme and original R&B love songs (""You Are My Rose""), sounds better than ever!! As the ultimate (and long-awaited) edition of the film, this is a must buy for diehard Wiseau Film fans as well as newcomers to The Room.

The most controversial aspect of this release is its cover art. I'll admit that the new case is a slight disappointment (the simple black and white photo was iconic). However, the new art highlights an important part of the film's legacy. The setting of San Francisco is a critical element of The Room, as it is the beloved home the characters we all know and love. The Room is mostly praised for its characters, making fans forget that the cinematography was also handled beautifully. To me, the new cover art reflects the classic scene transitions.

As an American, I recommend that all Americans (and people around the world) see The Room. This film may not please everyone, but those who enter the room, will leave forever changed. To enthusiasts, the question of purchasing this blu-ray should be non-existent. To newcomers, I urge you to give this movie at least two chances, because the first time may be too much to handle. The Room boasts some of the most wacky characters, over-the-top acting, and insanely quotable lines to ever grace American cinema. Most people fail to see the brilliance of Wiseau's direction until their second or third viewing. You'll laugh, you may even cry, but no matter what you will gain a new perspective on filmmaking. Tommy poured his heart into this masterpiece, and his devout fans love him for it.

The pacing is terrible! The mother shows up to tell the female lead that she has cancer, but it's no big deal. People randomly play football, though it's clear the actors have never thrown a football in their life.

This movie is so bad that it's worth a party just to watch and make fun of. Hilarious. Worth seeing once.",1357430400,10,594,4.4

2464821,5,B000CFYAMC,"This movie will change your life, pure and simple.

The story, the direction, the pacing, the acting, the sound track, the special effects, the lovemaking, betrayal, and human drama playing out on the big or small screen truly has not been seen like this ever before.  Nor will it ever again.

Though in some ways Birdemic rivals The Room in the special effects and story elements, it cannot approach the level of character-driven nuance exemplified by Wiseau's creations.  Some will claim that Manos has performances that eclipse The Room's, but Manos had considerably more pedestrian dialogue, not achieving the lofty, nearly poetic writing of Tommy Wissaue.  Others will claim that Santa Claus and the Ice Cream Bunny is even more astounding than The Room, but that is a snuff film and if you're caught watching it you should go to prison.

There are timeless characters in here, so clearly drawn as to become neo-archetypes for the 21st century.  From the paragon of humanity (Johnny) to the ultimate betrayal of all his friends and family to whatever Denny is, The Room offers not just a glimpse into the cacophony of creativity that is Wisaeu's mind, but a full-on nearly full-frontal view.

The set design is incredible with ground-breaking techniques used to simulate San Francisco (a scale model of the Golden Gate Bridge was built for some of the establishing shots) and this was the first film to be shot on 48 DPS and in hi-def 3-D.  So take advantage of this Blu-Ray offer and make sure you use a 3D capable TV.

The blocking is one thing that never ceases to amaze me.  Every scene was obviously story-boarded several times in advance and Coppola, Spielberg and Tarantino could learn a thing or two from what Whyso chooses to do with his characters in a scene (take for example the tuxedo scene where the characters each march to a predetermined position as if they were in a bad middle school play and then stand there woodenly reciting their dialogue, this is Wisaeau's brilliant take on contemporary culture transforming even the affluent of our society into nothing more than caricatures of humanity, standing stock-still to deliver their address to their peers).

I could go on and on, but I really must recommend this movie to everyone except for children and pregnant women.  Children should not see it because of the rather graphic nature of this movie's reality.  It is just too raw and too real for an undeveloped mind to process.  Pregnant women should stay away because the sheer sexual shockwave of Tommy Wisaeu's lovemaking on screen might cause a miscarriage.

Like I said, your life will be different after you see this movie.  You will never look at film-making (or even lovemaking) the same way again.  Although Transformers 2 is considered its big-budget Hollywood spiritual sequel, do yourself a favor and check out the movie that began it all.

The story follows a wealthy banker named Johnny who is betrayed by his faithless future wife named Lisa despite Johnny's lifelong efforts to do what is right, which includes (among many selfless acts) the pseudo-adoption of a lonely college kid named Denny who struggles with collecting drugs. I was torn apart watching this; in fact, I could barely contain myself as I witnessed Johnny's sex life deteriorate due to Lisa's vile seduction of his best friend, Mark. Steamy sex, terrifying action (the rooftop scene especially made my heart race), loads of drama, and subtle moments that cleverly imply comedy all come together to a gripping and mesmerizing finale that is unlike anything ever seen on film before. To put it bluntly, ""The Room"" will leave you thinking about it days, even weeks, later, much like a Christopher Nolan film, yet more cryptic and puzzling.

Obviously, I have not seen the Blu-Ray. I will buy it merely to add to my collection. I'm really waiting for the 3D Release of this film as it is one of the few older classics that truly deserve it.",1355961600,14,1129,4.78974358974359

This movie is a masterpiece in itself. Everything is so bad that it pretty much becomes unfathomable that such a thing could exist in our world of polished Hollywood cutouts. Tommy Wiseau, our director/producer/writer/actor, is a full-on comprehensive study on psychology in himself. Never in a million years will humanity be able to decipher the puzzles found deep within the chasms of his brain.

It's an art of itself and it's a masterpiece! I can tell this was meant to be a serious drama, but because of Wiseau's hilariously bad acting skills, this movie is now billed as a 'black comedy' Wiseau plays a character named Johnny. Johnny is a banker who is head-over-heels in love with his 'future wife' Lisa. Out of the blue, Lisa is bored of Johnny and begins to have an affair with Mark, Johnny's best friend, which they mention 20 or 30 times. Denny is a weird creepy awkward teen that Johnny looks after, who also lusts for Lisa. There are other many random characters such as Mike and Michelle, Chris-R the drug dealer, Peter the psychologist, Claudette the mother of Lisa who tells her to stay with Johnny.

2464842,5,B000CFYAMC,"As I'm sure my fellow raters/film critics would agree, this movie single-handedly sweeps the field for dramatic comedies. The transcendent performance by Tommy Wiseau as Johnny gives credence to the generally accepted notion that the man is our generation's Marlon Brando. This, coupled with the spell-binding wit and impeccable comedic timings of Philip Haldiman, who fills the role of Denny, the addicted-to-drugs-next-door-neighbor-who-lacks-any-observable-social-skill; or of Greg Sestero's portrayal of Mark, who, as revealed throughout the very coherent and well explained exposition of the film, comes to find the consequences of betrayal, is what pushes the film beyond the standard stagnant creativity of film screenplays over the past 50 years. Not to ruin the experience for first time watchers, but with the tantalizing side stories and compelling delivery of dialogue, it takes at least 4 or 5 watches to truly appreciate the audacity of the underlying themes of love, sacrifice, and the human spirit.

It's a poorly made movie, filled with lots of unnecessary scenes, characters, and transitions. The plot is so terribly executed,it's basically a 'rewind' movie. The characters are very flawed. And I don't need to say that Wiseau is maybe the worst actor ever in American cinema or in all of cinema.

Yet, I like to watch it. Why?

Because it makes me think I can act better than Wiseau. To me, it's the necessary ""101 On How To Not Make A Good Movie"". There are some many lines I can remember by heart and formulas that I can easily rip apart.

Is it a bad movie?

Yes.

But the expense of watching something bad can make us enjoy it sometime. It makes us wish we weren't them. It's Schadenfreude for me.",1350518400,,839,4.305732484076433
2464888,1,B000CFYAMC,"Okay, so here's the deal: I get it, all right? I completely understand why this movie is as beloved as it is. The writing is fascinatingly atrocious, the acting is unintentionally hilarious, and the overall movie has a real sense of wanting to be taken seriously and completely does not work in that regard. I can absolutely understand why people would enjoy this for how bad it is.

However, I cannot enjoy watching a ""so-bad-it's-good"" movie, however. I never have and I never will.
Here's why.

Mr. Wiseau appears to have embraced how bad everyone believes his movie to be, and even shows up at screenings at what has been called ""one of the best worst movies ever"". If it was me,however, I would be horrified that my passion project had been perverted in such a way when I had spent so much time and money trying to get the film made. The fact that he is all for making fun of it genuinely makes me wonder if he was in fact TRYING to make the film not work on purpose. This is a sentiment that applies much more to abominations like Birdemic and The Amazing Bulk, but the idea remains the same.

You look at any scene in The Room, and any person with half a lick of common sense would say to themselves ""you know, this is pretty darn bad."" From there, you would then think either ""I should re-shoot/rewrite this to make it better and not waste the money I've invested in this"", or ""Maybe if I make this as bad as I can, I can have a Troll 2 movie on my hands!!"" Seriously though, did Wiseau look at this and genuinely think this was a well-made and told story? I can't believe that; I really can't.

As such, while I understand the appeal of these types of movis, it is not a sentiment that I can agree with. I can't enjoy this movie because of how bad it is; I can only watch it all the way through just to say I finished it, return it to the person I borrowed it from, and never think about it again.

2464892,1,B000CFYAMC,"<strong>The Room</strong> (Tommy Wiseau, 2003)

There are those who will attempt to tell you that <em>The Room</em> is the worst movie ever made. Don't listen to them. While there is no possible angle at which you can look at this movie and call it ""good"", or for that matter even ""adequate"", it is unintentionally hysterical, which gives it enough value that it's become a midnight-movie sensation. Trust me, if you tried that with <em>Zombies Ate My Neighbours: The Movie</em> or the recent horrific <em>It's Alive</em> remake or <em>Shopping Mall Jihad</em> or... you get the idea. This is crap, but it's at least somewhat watchable crap that--probably, anyway--won't make you want to tear your eyes out and reinsert them incorrectly.

Plot: Johnny (director Wiseau) is a banker who seems to have everything going for him--he's in line for a big promotion, he's engaged to Lisa (<em>Ghost Shark 2</em>'s Juliette Danielle), he has a circle of solid friends he can rely on... well, he thinks all this is true, anyway. Lisa no longer loves him, and is determined to get some excitement into her life, mainly by seducing all of his friends.

All of which is well and good. Just written out like that, there's no real indication of much about this film (save the absolutely accurate implication that Ms. Danielle, who is almost supernaturally gorgeous, spends an astonishing amount of this movie out of her clothing). A synopsis won't tell you about what may actually be the single worst soundtrack I have ever heard in a film. It can't clue you in to the inept acting displayed by almost everyone in front of the camera, especially Wiseau himself. It can't indicate how badly damaged this script is. In order to find these things out, you have to see this towering monument to bad filmmaking yourself. And as awful a movie as this is (perhaps if I say ""this is worse than <em>Birdemic: Shock and Terror</em>, you'll get the idea?), I'm still going to tell you that you really do need to see it. It's a burgeoning midnight-movie classic for a reason. ",1347235200,5,2050,4.848571428571429

2464904,5,B000CFYAMC,"Tommy Wiseau's The Room might be the best worst thing you're missing out on. What might typically be a cliche flick about love and cheating is anything but typical. The cult-like following proves people love to see this film, and that they love to hate it. Characters pop in and out of scenes (who is Denny anyway? or the random man at Tommy's birthday gathering?) and conversations jump from one extreme to another, and the acting is awkward at best. In any other movie, things like this would be hard to sit through. But The Room's shoddy editing and strange flow of dialogue is a lot of what makes the film work. If you've ever seen it in a theater, you know the audience is a big part of what makes watching the film so enjoyable. From throwing plastic spoons at the screen whenever a framed photo of a spoon is shown on screen, to mocking the love interest (played by Juilette Danielle), to shouting favorite lines like ""YOU ARE TEARING ME APART LISA!"", it is evident there is something special going on here. I say seeing it in the theater is the way to go, but either way, if you haven't experienced this movie you are truly missing out on something magical.",1344211200,,1165,4.474178403755869
2464905,5,B000CFYAMC,"The Room transcends definition. It's an experience. To review it as good or bad is meaningless. It's a singular experience that comes straight from one man's imagination, Tommy Wiseau. He's a genius in the ideal sense of the word. He made a movie not in the tradition of movies that came before it, but in spite of them. The Room makes you consider and question what you're seeing. You can't watch this movie on your own terms. You have to accept it on its terms. It makes no attempt to consider convention and instead creates its own with bizarre line readings, characters that come in and out of the plot, and guys throwing around a football in tuxedos.

To laugh at this movie is a cop out. It is hilarious, but it (really, honestly, very strangely) does do something very human. It comes from such a specific point of view, perhaps that of someone who's never interacted with people before, and it makes no attempt to retreat from this. I wouldn't want it any other way. Most movies don't have anywhere near as much personality as this and as much material that can resonate in you. It really is hilarious and endearing-writer/director/lead actor Tommy Wiseau obviously put a lot of attention and thought into this movie, and we won't ever see another movie quite like it.

Trust me, watch this movie. Watch it with your family and friends. And then attend a screening of it, preferably with Wiseau and co-star Greg Sestero in attendance, which they often do on tour.

2464906,1,B000CFYAMC,"Tommy Wiseau writes, directs, produces and stars in this 2003 drama film set in beautiful San Francisco, California.

Mr. Wiseau stars as Johnny, an extremely successful yet overlooked banker who lives in a townhouse with his so very beautiful future wife, Lisa (Juliette Danielle). He is very generous, beloved and giving, yet he is unsuspecting to the treacherous and licentious behaviors of his future wife. The very sexy Lisa is having an affair with Johnny's best friend, Mark (Greg Sestero) on the down low while Johnny's neighbor and surrogate son, Denny, enjoys watching Johnny and Lisa's foreplay. Denny is portrayed as a mentally handicapped university student. Philip Haldiman plays Denny with sincerity and complete creepiness. As this furtive love triangle continues, Johnny contends with lack of promotions at work, Denny's drug problems, Claudette's(Carolyn Minnott as Lisa's mother)diagnosis of breast cancer, Mark's distant behavior and false accusations of drunken domestic violence by Lisa, who looks so sexy in her red dress. As the plans for Johnny's upcoming birthday and wedding, not even scotchka can mask the webs of deceit that are melting around Johnny. Not even the support Michelle, Steven and Peter, johnny's loyal friends, can quell the heartbreak that could awake all as they look in the mirror and answer the burning question, ""Can you ever really trust anyone?""

This film is a bizarre, surreal mess! The dialogue is nonsensical and strange, the actions and behavior of the characters are inexplicable, the green screens and lack of sets are laughable, the lack of explanation and resolution for all the subplots is confusing and most of the acting is horrible. At one point, Greg Sestero delivers the line ""Oh come on!"" with the worst acting I have ever seen, which is saying a lot because Mr. Wiseau is not far behind with his bizarre antics on screen. To be fair, Robyn Paris as Michelle and Dan Janjigian as Chris-R provide the only decent acting in this film. Kudos to them for attempting to make lemonade when life handed them some rotten lemons in the form of Wiseau's script.

That said, if you think movies can be fun and you have a sense of humor, then add this DVD to your shopping cart and buy it! This film really deserves its reputation for being entertaining and unintentionally hilarious! I do not wish to spoil any of the odd moments, lines, catch phrases and goofiness which have become memes through DVD sales, the internet and midnight showings, so go in with an open-mind, a football, a red dress and perhaps a spoon or two.",1341705600,7,2579,4.979118329466357

The sadness of the whole production is that it's somewhat professionally filmed. Not what you'd expect from such a steaming pile of brain cell destroying dung. I did say ""somewhat"", no more than that. The kind of production you might expect from soft core porn. Complete with the moaning.

2464908,5,B000CFYAMC,"While The Room may have a few minor flaws, the artistic impact this movie creates on our culture should not be overlooked.  The movie is immediately personal to the viewers as they are introduced to future husband Johnny and his future wife Lisa. The audience is immediately enveloped in the love and compassion of the couple's beautiful relationship.  As strife descends upon The protagonist Johnny, he continues to keep up his altruistic life of benevolence and care for friends and family while maintaining his philosophical wit and greater understanding of the world that surrounds him.  Only when the ultimate, and truly inevitable evil tries to bring him down is Johnny truly tested.

The movie goes through the hardships and woes of life.  Without spoiling too much, the story winds through a story of love intertwined with rich storytelling into the woes of cancer, the joy of pregnancy, cowardice, a beautiful scene discussing the romance in chocolate, and troubles with alcoholism and drug use.  Complex and well written characters evolve and transition into new people; sometimes ENTIRELY. One exhilarating, shocking scene where the friends prepare tuxes for the wedding, involves Johnny's best friend Mark changing into a new person, to the surprise of the friends and movie viewers alike.

There is one thing that may turn people off: if you are not a big fan of Football, it may be distracting since it ends up being an integral plot point to the entire film.  Entire friendships are based upon the sport and is heavily involved with many aspects of the story. Another noticeable short-coming is the poor acting done by the actor portraying Chris-R, which can be overlooked but is enough to distract the viewer from the intriguing world contained within ""The Room"".

Will they conclude that we were a race of zombies, that ""The Walking Dead"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"" were documentaries, and that Tommy Wiseau was the reigning sex symbol of the zombie culture? In any case, it is impossible to think of any film so completely and unintentionally divorced from human experience. ""Plan 9 from Outer Space,"" ""Troll 2"" and ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" are fully as bad, but as horror fantasy they were never expected to mirror the daily experience of the audience. ""The Room"" purports to be a romantic, erotic thriller-tragedy, depicting men and women as they actually behave, and therein lies its unique, multiple-train-wreck fascination.

Any film as totally chisel-brained as ""The Room"" would automatically deserve one star, but I give it a second star in honor of the unique and (I hope) never-to-be-replicated auteurist vision of Mr. Wiseau.

2464913,5,B000CFYAMC,"The Room is the only movie I have to pause every few minutes due to the pain of laughter.

No other movie can do that. Not every single time I watch it. Ergo, this is the funniest movie ever made.

Don't get me wrong, there have been plenty of great comedies: ""The Producers"", ""Withnail and I"", ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""This is Spinal Tap"" were, before this changed everything, at the top of my list. But even they can not compete with this movie. Watching The Room really is like sitting on an atomic bomb, waiting for it to go off... an atomic bomb of laughter. This movie literally has 8 or 9 of the 10 funniest moments in movie history. That one, short, infamous scene in the florist, by itself, contains more belly laughs than most other comedies can manage in 90 minutes.

Tommy Wiseau has (somehow) created an ""accidental masterpiece"". A movie so great, so insane, so wonderful - yet all in ways that I suspect Mr. Wiseau has no concept of, and certainly had no intention of creating. He set out to make a sexy thriller, but what came out was utterly unsexy (at moments it's in fact gross), entirely unthrilling - and were you to be stupid enough to watch as a drama, you would find absolutely no drama anywhere in the movie. It has characters who act in ways no human being has ever acted, and saying things that either a) make no sense, b) are completely irrelevant to what is happening, or c) start a subplot that is subsequently never again mentioned.

But all the many, many things that would kill it as a straight drama become pure gold when played for laughs. The execution is beyond inept - in fact the whole debacle seems to have been conceived as a vanity project for Mr. Wiseau. Normally this would be a terminal misstep, but because Mr. Wiseau is one of the greatest men who ever lived, the movie instead becomes endlessly entertaining, and his performance ever more fascinating.

I don't know who this Tommy Wiseau guy is, but after reading up on him apparently he has lived his entire life in New Orleans, which is why it is so hilarious that he speaks with an eastern European accent.

The acting is awful, the camera work is blurry throughout a lot of the movie, about 2/3 of the way through you realize you have no concept of time, setting, or the progression of the story. You often find yourself asking ""wait, why are they in tuxedos playing football?"" or ""they were just running at the park, and now they're talking to someone, oh wait, no, still running in the park."" or ""is that new guy supposed to be the old psycologist friend?"" Literally they just plugged a new actor in the middle of the movie to play a character where the actor apparently quit halfway through. They didn't bother reshooting it.

Much of the movie is dubbed over itself, often times they use footage from a San Francisco tourism video as transitions, and the story really has no plot to speak of. It's essentially a crazy lady trying to convince her mother that her fiance is evil, and then her getting with almost every other guy in the movie.

There are two deleted scenes for the entire movie, both of which are actually in the movie, only done in front of a green screen. Tommy Wiseau has changed my life for the better, and I applaud his efforts in successfully making the worst movie ever.",1330992000,8,1539,4.392982456140351

2464938,5,B000CFYAMC,"I have now seen Mr. Tommy Wiseau's cinematic tour-de-force, `The Room' three times. With each viewing, `The Room' becomes more complexly entangled in and inseparable from my own life. I no longer know where The Room ends and I begin.

It is, without question, the worst film ever made. Including movies made on beta max video cameras in special education high school classes. But this comment is in no way meant to be discouraging. Because while The Room is the worst movie ever made it is also the greatest way to spend a blisteringly fast 100 minutes in the dark. Simply put, `The Room' will change your life.

It's not just the dreadful acting or the sub-normal screenplay or the bewildering direction or the musical score so soaked in melodrama that you will throw up on yourself or the lunatic-making cinematography; no, there is something so magically wrong with this movie that it can only be the product of divine intervention. If you took the greatest filmmakers in history and gave them all the task of purposefully creating a film as spectacularly horrible as this not one of them, with all their knowledge and skill, could make anything that could even be considered as a contender. Not one line or scene would rival any moment in The Room.

The centerpiece of this filmic holocaust is Mr. Tommy Wiseau himself. Without him, it would still be the worst movie ever made, but with him it is the greatest worst movie ever made. Tommy has been described as a Cajun, a Croatian cyborg, possibly from Belgium, clearly a product of Denmark, or maybe even not from this world or dimension. All of these things are true at any one moment. He is a tantalizing mystery stuffed inside an enigma wrapped in bacon and smothered in cheese. You will fall in love with this man even as you are repelled by him from the first moment he steps onto screen with his long Louis the Fourteenth style black locks and thick triangular shoulders packed into an poorly fitted suit. You will even grow to love his metallic, steroid-destroyed skin. Tommy looks out of place, out of time and out of this world. There has never been anything else like him. Nor will there ever be.

The Room begins with `Johnny' (Tommy Wiseau) and his incomprehensibly evil fiance `Lisa' (played by a woman with incongruously colored eyebrows and a propensity for removing her shirt) engaging in some light frottage, joined by, their sexually confused teenage neighbor, Denny--played with a deft sense of the absurd by Phillip Haldiman--who is clearly suffering from a cruel form of aged decrepitude. When Denny, who looks like the human version of Gleek the monkey from Superfriends, says, in a slightly creepy yet playful tone of voice, `I like to watch!' as Johnny and Lisa roll around the bed in a pre-intercourse ritual revolving around rose petals, you know you are in for a very special movie.

After a lengthy lovemaking scene (not to worry if you miss it the first time, they show it again in its entirety later in the movie) in which Tommy's bizarre, scaly torso and over-anatomized rear-end are lovingly depicted in great detail as he appears to hump Lisa's extra vagina located somewhere near her hip, we discover that Lisa, for no particular reason, decides she is bored with Tommy's incessant lovemaking and affectionate attention and decides to leave him. But not before she destroys his life.

Just when you think the movie might lapse into an ordinary, pedestrian sort of badness, Johnny's best friend Mark, who seems to have no job other than to wear James Brolin's beard from Amityville Horror, shows up and electrifies the screen with a performance so wooden that you could buy it at Home Depot and build a spice rack with it. Incidentally, Mark is played by Greg Sestero, who, in addition to being described as a department store mannequin, was also the line producer on `The Room' and one of Tommy Wiseau's five (5!!!!!) assistants on the movie. Lisa forces Mark, amid his paltry, unconvincing protests, to have an affair with her on their uncomfortable circular stairs. Lisa decides that she is evil incarnate and proceeds to torture her angelic and insanely devoted fianc with various lies and manipulations.

Lisa receives pointed advice from her mother who casually announces that she is dying of breast cancer. And then never mentions it again! But Lisa is determined to make Johnny's life a living hell, in spite of the fact that she, according to her mother, ""cannot survive on her own in the cutthroat 'computer business"". But not before they recycle the sex scene from earlier in the movie where we get another bird's eye view of the insanity that is Johnny's naked body. Denny gets into trouble with a drug dealer. Mark shaves his beard. Tommy gets drunk on an unusual cocktail made from mixing whiskey and vodka. Lisa lies and tells everyone that Tommy hit her in a drunken rage.

A balding psychologist appears out of nowhere, offers some advice, then apparently dies while softly falling on the ground in an attempt to catch a football thrown by Mark.

All of these seemingly disparate events build up to two cathartic moments. The first is when Tommy expressively yells at Lisa with the line `You are tearing me apart Lisa!'. You will cheer at this line as you realize that the film has been tearing you apart the whole time. And the second is at Tommy's birthday party where the worst actor that has ever been born plays a unidentified man wearing a silk shirt who utters a phrase that perfectly describes the experience of watching The Room,

`It feels like I'm sitting on atom bomb that is going to explode!'

The shocking ending will leave you pleading and hoping for a sequel.

See this film at all costs. See it twice. Or three times. Or as one kid that I met from Woodland Hills has, 12 times! See it until you can recite every precious line of dialogue this movie has to offer. Let The Room become your new religion and Tommy Wiseau your prophet preaching the gospel according to Johnny.

This film is so bad on so many levels, that it almost becomes a step-by-step guide for wrong choices, whether it's dialogue, acting, camera set-up, direction, structure, character development, etc.

Is it so bad it's good?  In a lot of ways, yes.  It IS so bad it's hilarious.  I was crying my eyes out from laughing so hard...but, please, don't go in expecting brilliance on every level - you won't find it here.  But what you will find is a fascinating film done terribly.

Honestly, if I was teaching a film study class where we watched films to point out flaws on film-making - I would only have to show this film.",1303603200,,746,4.394160583941606
2464948,5,B000CFYAMC,"Hey everybody!

The Room is one of those films that will imprint themselves on your psyche for all time.  You will by laying on your deathbed, juiced up on painkillers, and staring at your weeping loved ones with confused pain filled eyes and will still manage to blurt out ""So how's your sex life?"" before passing on to the great Room in the sky.

I could recap the entire movie here like many have done, or I could describe in excruciating detail the unspeakable horror that is passed off as acting and dialog in this film.  But I won't.  I will merely encourage you to purchase a copy for yourself, so that you too can truly understand the indescribable film that is The Room.

In fact I will even go so far to say that if copies of The Room and some portable DVD players were dropped all over the mid east, we could achieve a true and lasting peace among the warring nations there.

Now I can already hear the naysayers out there, ""yea, well what about Plan 9 From Outer Space, or Manos, Hands of Fate"" and on and on.  While I agree that those movies are wretched, The Room takes bad to a whole new level.  The pure genuis of Tommys' movie is that not a single member of the cast has even a tiny molecule of acting ability in their entire body.  The acting, writing and directing are so bad it is hardly believable. Heck, he even hired the ""Leading Lady"" (and I use that term in it's very loosest sense)the afternoon before shooting began after seeing her on a bus, and she is one of the ""better actors"". The thought of actually determining if she could act did not, I am certain, ever cross his mind.  What is so strange about the movie is how watchable it is.  I have seen plenty of bad movies that were hard to sit through and very boring.  The Room is very watchable precisely because of how bad it is.

This is a great way to spend an evening with friends.

2464953,5,B000CFYAMC,"Prior to feasting my eyes upon the visual thanksgiving that is Tommy Wiseau's ""The Room"" I was a broken shell of a man. But once I heard that Tommy was the number one customer, Lisa's mom had breast cancer (It's true!) and that Lisa already ordered pizza, I knew I had found my inspiration for living.

This is the worst movie ever made. And I've seen Ed Wood's stuff. It's also one of the most amazing, incredible, awesome, disturbing, ball numbingly, mind boggling pieces of cinema ever produced. The hobbled will walk, the blind shall see. The badness of this movie is biblical in proportion.

The Room is the story of the betrayal of Johnny, the greatest guy who ever lived, by his best friends and his future wife, Lisa, who seems to forget whether or not she loves or hates Johnny. That is honestly the best way to describe what the ""story"" is all about. There are more plot holes here than in all the star wars prequels, and the acting is so atrocious that if it were to be judged on American Idol, Paula Abdul, the nicest one if I remember correctly, would come across as Hitler and Simon Cowell's love child.

Warning, early in the movie are like three or so gratuitous sex scenes, that just happen for no readily apparent reason, unless that reason was that Tommy Wiseau wanted to show off his gnarled buttocks and flash some T n' A from Lisa.

The dialogue is worse than Star Wars Episode II combined with Baby Geniuses. My ears, they bled.

This is definitely a buy, watch it with your friends, laugh your ass off, get the rifftrax for it, laugh some more.

I would also like to add that for making this horrible... thing, Tommy Wiseau should be tried in the Hague and be barred from ever coming closer than 100 meters to any recording device.",1302134400,5,1755,4.46875
2464954,3,B000CFYAMC,"I had seen The Room on TV briefly in the past and thought nothing of it. This was about two to three years ago. Recently, however, attention began inundating magazines, blogs, etc: This movie is a cult hit. So, coincidentally in the town I'm living in, someone decided to put on a three-day festival of the worst movies everyone loves to watch. The Room was the finale; a Saturday night showing (at 8 p.m., not the traditional 12 a.m.)on a snowy night in Western New York.

An introduction was given, rather hilariously, and the movie began shortly after. I watched in disbelief at how badly good it was. It has been described as though antoher species were writing a movie about human interaction; this seems fitting. However, I think it's more that a person from some Eastern European country (which Tommy Wiseau will not admit to being from) wrote a movie about American interaction, sprinkled with plot holes, disgusting dialogue (meaning it's so bad it's not even human) and awful music. Not to mention the random shots of San Fransisco and what looks like Rome at one point.

I laughed, I sighed, I threw spoons at the correct times. It was fun... with other people.

I bought this movie in the hopes that I could get my friends into it; this did not work. Plus, watching it with maybe 4 people is not a good idea. It really is just an awful, awful movie. It's good that so much is coming out about it, for example the actors being so fed up with the script that they basically ruined the movie without even trying.

So, if you want to enjoy this movie, watch it in a theater. If you buy the DVD, skip to the best scenes (Room fans, you know what they are). And, watch the interview; it's a testament to Wiseau's genius (sarcasm). Gotta say, he's a good sport about it all.",1301875200,,1779,4.481481481481482
2464955,5,B000CFYAMC,"Let me warn you: this will probably be one of the worst movies, if not the worst, that you will ever see. Everything is done so poorly, whether it would be the acting, the scenery, the abundance of plot holes, so on and so forth. If I were to count out every single flaw in this film, I might as well count the number of blades of grass on a golf course. Despite all of this, I have never seem a film that's managed to have these moments stick in my head due to how terrible everything is executed.

First off, let's keep in mind that the main actor, Tommy Wiseau, also directed, produced and did the screenwriting for this film. The Room aims to be a black comedy that focuses on a love triangle that causes conflict between his role as Johnny, his future wife Lisa and his best friend Mark. They got half of what they're aiming for, as I've laughed the hardest in my life at multiple scenes within this film. First off, when it comes to the acting and dialogue, there are so many questionable phrases and responses within. It's not just the abundance of ""Oh hi [insert name here]"" or Wiseau's thick Eastern European accent that make it phenomenal. Let's take a classic line written and said by Wiseau himself:

""I did not hit her, it's not true, it's bulls**t, I did not hit her, I did NOT. Oh, hi Mark.""

You thought THAT was bad? Just wait until you watch the scene in its shining glory, and then the rest of the movie speaks for itself.

Then there are plot holes that somehow manage to get in the story. For instance, you hear about Lisa's mother saying she has breast cancer in one scene. It is never mentioned again. Come on, if you're going to mention something that's supposed to be as serious as breast cancer, can't you at least bring up whether it's gotten better or worse later on in the film? Or how about how Denny got in trouble for dealing drugs? Mentioned once and never brought back up again.

Then we have laughable technical mistakes as well. There's plenty of football passing in this film within about four to six feet within each other. They film the flying football for a few seconds in the air. Either Tommy and crew know how to throw a slow pass to each other that can last as long as a 20 yard pass or they completely screwed up as expected. I'm going for the latter. I don't have any further need to explain anything else in this regard, other than the fact that there are an abundance of them in this film.

On a technical level when it comes to how it was made, this definitely gets a 1. However, because of its endless replay value and constant hilarity within this garbage heap, I'm giving it a perfect score. It may seem wrong but this film will change your viewpoints. Enough with this review, let's go eat, HAWH?",1301788800,3,2749,4.33852140077821
2464956,5,B000CFYAMC,"What to say about this, truly one of the best worst movies I've ever seen in my entire existence in this lifetime? One does not go into this hoping to view a serious slice of human life; you watch this because you cannot believe this got made. You watch this for ridiculous conversations between men about women, playing football in suits, love scenes that go on for way too long and are far from romantic, and to count how many times people greet each other with ""Oh, hai."" Serious aficionados of this flick will have a good time yelling out that some people who appear on screen are never properly introduced in the movie. And let's not forget the framed photographs of, not people, but spoons and utensils.

THE ROOM is a tour de force in the awful, a groundbreaking masterpiece of hilarious dialogue which is supposed to be insightful but is not, a feast for the eyes and ears and the soul.

And it is also the worst film ever made (I never thought I would use those two sentences to describe the same film). And I don't make room for a lot of guilty pleasures when it comes to movies. The reason ""The Room"" achieves greatness is because of how much cinematic ineptitude is on display in every scene. There are numerous scenes, characters and lines of dialogue that serve no purpose whatsoever. The writing, the acting, the casting, the directing (ok, everything) in this film is just wrong. At times my jaw was unhinged at just how much lack of filmmaking intelligence was on display (notably a rooftop scene in which Johnny confronts Mark to discuss women). Normally all these things would be a colossal cinematic crime. But it works here because everything that is pointless and awful is so unintentionally funny that it becomes impossible not to enjoy. To see what was intended as a serious melodrama become an unbelieveable laugh riot is a joy beyond description. It should be studied in film schools worldwide to serve as the greatest example of how not to make a film, but also as the best example of cinematic awfulness at its most entertaining. Of course, my review doesn't do the film justice. It exists in that tiny canon of films that must be seen to be believed.

That doesn't mean it's the most offensive movie I've voluntarily seen (""The Day After Tomorrow""), or the most irritating (any of the ""Twilight"" movies), this is simply the worst movie I've ever had the displeasure of viewing.  Despite poor research and weak story/acting in the two aforementioned movies, respectively, ""The Room"" has no story, and deadpan reading in place of acting.

As my friends and I viewed this with film with Rifftrax, I kept an eye open to watch for lip-syncing so as not to confuse the riffers for the actors.  For at least one full minute, I thought the riffers were simply tearing into Tommy Wiseau before asking everyone, ""Is that actually HIM talking?""  What could the Rifftrax add?  This person was a joke in and of himself!

There's really no story to speak of.  Wiseau's character has a fiancee who's constantly cheating on him because she's bored with him.  That's the bulk of it.  At least ""Twilight"" had a simpering little girl to move the (albeit very weak) plot forward, and though the character is as bland as stale toast, we can understand what she is saying.  Not so with Wiseau. And as I mentioned before, there's no lip-reading with this character.  He mumbles at best, and with a thick accent nobody seems to be able to identify.

Wow, where do I start?

After hearing about this movie on a review site, I decided to take a look for myself on WHY this movie is SO BAD, but yet, SO ENTERTAINING....

Here is the premises of the movie: A guy named Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) is madly in love with his live-in fiancee named Lisa (Juliette Danielle), they share an apartment in San Francisco, make love to TERRIBLE R&B-lite tunes. Everything seems perfect...Right?

Wrong!

It turns out that Lisa is a BIG FAKER! While admitting to her mother Claudette (Carolyn Minnot) fifteen minutes into the movie that she doesn't love Johnny anymore and doesn't want to be with him anymore. Lisa's mother Claudette tells Lisa that ""Johnny is a good man."" (And trust me, THIS isn't the last time that you will hear this line).

After Claudette leaves, Lisa calls Mark (Greg Sestero) who is Johnny's best friend for a ""talk"". Eventually, things get hot and heavy in the apartment with Lisa and Mark as Lisa confesses to Mark that she loves him, not Johnny.

Of course with Lisa being the BIG FAKE that she is, she continues to trick Johnny that she loves him until Lisa and Johnny get drunk, and she makes up a story that he hit her while he was drunk.

Eventually, Johnny starts to put all of the pieces of this puzzle until the very end.

So what makes this movie SO BAD, but yet, SO ENTERTAINING? Here are more than a couple of reasons:

First, THE BAD:

1. Tommy Wiseau's acting: Wow, where do I start with this one?  His acting is JUST HORRIBLE, and with all perfect honestly, I have seen BETTER acting from elementary school performances than what Tommy Wiseau put into this movie. In the first scene, as soon as he comes into the shot and speaks the opening line in the movie...he talks like Christopher Walken playing a mental patient.

2. The subplots: Now, the thing with subplots, they are supposed to add to the story and it also makes the characters interesting with how these characters deal with the issue at hand. Well, there are several subplots in this movie, but they are quickly added and within five minutes, they are quickly forgotten. Like the neighborhood kid Denny (Phillip Haldiman) who has a mysterious run-in with a drug dealer, and struggles with his attraction with Lisa.

Claudette (Lisa's mother) deals with real estate problems, failed relationships, and breast cancer, and once it is mentioned, it is quickly forgotten.

3. A lot of questions are arisen, but never answered: With Denny telling Lisa that he brought some drugs off of the mysterious drug dealer and owns him some money, he never says what kind of drugs he bought or how much money he owes the drug dealer. Once the drug dealer is gone, he never comes back or bothers Denny again.

Claudette telling Lisa (HER DAUGHTER) that she has breast cancer, Lisa tells her mother that ""Everything is going to be all right."" Like, what happened? Did Claudette seek medical help for her breast cancer? Again, it's brought up and never answered.

Although it is quite clear that he is in college, it is not clear (or talked about) whether Denny is a fully-functioning adult. This character is quite ignorant of social standards; like when Johnny and Lisa go upstairs to make love, Denny comes up to the bedroom and starts throwing pillows with Johnny and Lisa, and what happens is, let's just say, a little strange.

Now, you may be wondering...since I have bashed so much about this movie, what is so entertaining about this movie? Well, let me explain:

1. The script: Yes, there are repeated lines in this movie i.e.; ""Johnny is a good man."", ""Johnny is my best friend.""..etc...it's this one scene with Johnny and Mark on the roof where Johnny comes up and he is on the phone after Lisa spreads the lie about him hitting her...It's priceless.

2. The acting: Although Tommy Wiseau talks like Christopher Walken playing a mental patient, his acting on camera is so FUNNY, and some of the lines he say's in this movie are either outright HILARIOUS or sometimes just outright STRANGE.

Tommy Wiseau is not the only one with bad acting, most (if not all) of the actors have hooky acting, but not as bad as Tommy Wiseau's...

So, if you are into movies that are terrible-but-good at the same time, than pick up a copy of ""The Room"".",1297382400,,4522,4.62625
2464971,3,B000CFYAMC,"Once upon a time, a man wanted to star in a movie.

So he spent five years raising $6 million- and here you have it- The Room!

So much can be said about this movie- it's horrible, it's wonderful, you can't stop watching it!

As a motion picture- it fails miserably.  The acting is so bad it is apparent that these people either had no shame, or were just overjoyed to be in a feature film.  The dialogue is so stereotypical that it borders on surrealism.  The plot is disjointed, none of it flows, some of it falls by the wayside entirely. (Perfect example- in a conversation between Lisa and her mother, her mother announces:""I got the results of the test back - I definitely have breast cancer.""  and THUS ends the extent of conversation on THAT subject for the duration of the film!)
The movie soundtrack (which IS available on CD for your listening pleasure!) is tacky, the sex scenes are drawn out and NOT sexy (i.e. shot after shot of Tommy Wiseau's lumpy rear end).
The green screen shots are so lousy it looks like the actors are floating on air!

But still...we cannot look away.

I believe the fascination lies in the fact that nothing in this movie makes sense!  Basically, it is about a love triangle between a man(?), his ""future wife"", and his best friend.  With a whole lot of unnecessary stuff:
Why do people come into Johnny's apartment and sit on the floor, or come by to say hello and then run off because they are very busy- WHY DID YOU COME OVER IN THE FIRST PLACE???
Why do men run around in tuxedos throwing a football to each other from ridiculously short distances?
Why does Lisa order such a bizarre pizza?
Why are there framed pictures of cutlery?
Why does Johnny have a mysterious accent that leads you to believe his mother was French/Hungarian/Italian and his father was Portugese/Russian/Klingon?

I gave this movie three stars because: it is a terrible fim, yet the entertainment value is definitely there, so it redeems itself.  I recommend watching it two or three times, let it sink in, let the shock waves pass and just be entertained!!

In closing, I have a theory about Tommy Wiseau (who has the most vague and obscure Wikipedia article I have ever read!) and how this movie came about: Tommy Wiseau is not of this galaxy...he came from a distant solar system, observed mankind for some amount of time, and made this film based on what he THINKS people act and talk like.

That's my story and I'm stickin' to it!

P.S.: if all else fails- this movie is perfect for any number of drinking games!",1296086400,11,2533,4.534065934065934

2464973,5,B000CFYAMC,"Tommy Wiseau's disasterpiece ""The Room"" is one of the most memorable films ever made. Tommy Wiseau's confused direction, insipid acting and idiotic writing all combine to create the greatest accidental comedy of all time, but chances are that you already know plenty about the film. My intention is to solely review this DVD, which I feel does not get enough recognition as being nearly as hilarious as the film itself.

First of all, when the DVD starts, there are no introduction videos for any of the companies involved with the film, it just jumps straight to the menu, which has many peculiarities.

The Room has an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 (1.78 times wider than its height), otherwise known as 16:9 or Widescreen. However, it's clear that Tommy Wiseau cannot stick to one aspect ratio. The dvd is mastered in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio (as indicated by the back of the box and seen by playing the film on my widescreen television), but for some reason, all of the menus (which have this hilariously bad green color-graded background of Tommy Wiseau) are in 1.33:1, or 4:3/fullscreen. This is annoying because the image is then pillar boxed on widescreen TVs (black bars on the sides of the image.) I have nothing against the 1.33:1 Aspect Ratio and I watch several 1.33 films on my TV, which are all pillar-boxed. However, the menus on this disc still annoy me because the DVD is mastered in 1.78:1, not 1.33:1. If the DVD is mastered in 1.78:1, the menus should also be in 1.78:1.

But this is not the only example of Tommy Wiseau mishandling the aspect ratios for his content. The extras (which are all B-Movie gold) are all filmed in 1.78:1 with the exception of the Behind-the-scenes documentary. However, on several of them (including a laughably contrived interview), he letterboxes (black bars on the top and bottom of the image) the 1.78:1 to fit into a 1.:33:1 image in which he edited the 1.78:1 footage. However, as I said, the DVD is mastered in 1.78:1, not 1.33:1. The only time you ever need to letterbox a 1.78:1 image is when the image is being played on a screen with an aspect ratio taller than 1.78:1. However, the DVD is exactly 1.78:1, so the letterboxing is not needed in any way. As a result of Tommy Wiseau's idiocy, the widescreen extras are surrounded by black when they fit the screen perfectly. Something tells me that Tommy Wiseau knows nothing about editing video.

The extras on the disc, while somewhat limited, are worth buying the dvd for, even if just to laugh at them. The DVD comes with Two trailers (a long one and a short one), Deleted scenes (which are actually one very poorly edited deleted scene infected by extreme continuity errors and unnecessary letterboxing), an interview with Tommy Wiseau (yet again unnecessarily letterboxed), a fly-on-the-wall Behind the Scenes documentary and a Still Photo Gallery.

The two trailers expertly display Tommy Wiseau's failed attempts to pass the film off as a quirky black comedy. The greatest error in both trailers is the inclusion of the tagline ""A drama with the passion of Tennessee Williams"" and the quote ""Experience this quirky new black comedy, it's a riot."" Anyone with a limited knowledge of Tennessee Williams will understand the faults of including both of these quotes.

Tennessee Williams was a brilliant playwright who wrote some of the most engaging, intense and claustrophobic stage-dramas ever performed. Let me stress the fact that these plays were extremely intense, because they put you on the very edge of your seat with their dialog heavy and character driven stories. In fact, arguably his two masterworks, ""Street Car Named Desire"" and ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" were both committed to great films. Tennessee Williams famous works are not in any way comedic. Some of them contain comedic moments, but for the most part, they were terribly serious. It simply does not work to state a black comedy has the dramatic attributes of Tennessee Williams. It's yet another example of how Tommy Wiseau's failed attempts to pass the film off as a black comedy despite it's obvious intentions to be a serious character driven drama, very much in the style of Williams. In fact, any fan of William's work will see the influences he had on Tommy. For example, both ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" and this film attempt to tell the story and build the character relationships through exposition, they both lead up to an explosive last act and they both deal with a faulty relationship. However, Tommy Wiseau does not effectively use the time he spends toward telling the story through exposition and fails to communicate the story in a way that the audience can relate to.

Moving on with the extras, the deleted scene (there is only one deleted scene included), an alternate version of the interaction between Denny and Chris-R, is even worse than any portion of the film. For one thing, the cinematographic style is very different than that of the scenes which made it into the film. There are very few cuts and the camera moves back and forth haphazardly along a dolly-track for most of the scene and the scene is in the same place that Johnny, Mark, Denny and Mike play football, except there is a basketball hoop added to the set. The dialog is slightly different (including a hilarious addition of Denny trying to buy time by baiting Chris-R to play horse with him). The editing is very poor and fails to edit out the scene preparation at the beginning and end of the scene.

Also included on the disc is a contrived and poorly conducted interview of Tommy Wiseau, obviously done by Greg Sestero, who played Mark. Judging by the contrived nature of the questions and their answers, it was clear Tommy Wiseau had an agenda to dismiss the severe critical dislike of his film. In fact, in one question, he directly addresses people who dislike the film. It's really something you should see for yourself, so I will talk about it no more.

There is an entire 30-minute documentary sans narration made up of randomly assembled footage of the production and a very small interview of Carolyn Minnot, the actress for Claudette. It's also worth watching to see how everything went wrong throughout, so I won't spoil anymore.

Finally including are two poor still photo galleries, including poor and unnecessary stills from the film and a few of the film's production. This portion is really not worth watching, so I won't really discuss it.

Overall, if you want the film and are curious about the extras, I highly recommend this dvd.",1293235200,3,6517,4.7994652406417115

2464975,2,B000CFYAMC,"I'm sorry but I just can't help but laugh at this movie.  Okay, so I gave this two stars because that's all this movie is, which is junk, and it sometimes becomes tedious at times, which can make it a little hard to wade through in contrary to what other people are saying.  But I think it's saying something when this movie is cited to be one of the worst films of all times, and by god, I think it's up there.  And by god, I'll be damned if it isn't a damn good B-movie piece of garbage.

From start to finish, this movie is an absolutely joyride of stupid characters, terrible dialogue, utterly pointless and stupid $#% scenes and other things, logic holes bigger than Armageddon, an absolutely boring and inane story, and by far some of the WORST acting I've ever seen from Tommy Wiseau.  Nobody in this movie is even worth paying attention other than to laugh at, and really, these people are lamer than the D @ D playing nerds who avoid showers and spend their time in their basements all day.  Let me just say that when Tommy killed himself, I was crying with joy because I just hated the man (even though he provided some of the best laughter I've had in a while).  I wasn't sure if I wanted to laugh hysterically after what I saw, or cry after the terrible garbage I saw.

Tommy just can't write a single convincing dialogue scene, and it's so badly acted that it almost borders on surreal.  Sometimes I can't even tell if it's him talking as it sometimes even seems to be dubbed wrong!  This is one of the worst acting jobs I've ever seen, and most child actor scan school this guy any day of the weak.  Good grief, this guy makes Shaq look like John Travolta (seriously!  I'm being sincere here!), and makes John Travolta look like Peter O' Toole.  I'm pretty sure you've heard it all before, but this is my favorite scene of all time.

Johnny: Hi!
Clerk: Can I help you?
Johnny: Yeah, can I have a dozen red roses, please?
Clerk: Oh hi, Johnny, I didn't know it was you.
Johnny: That's me!  How much is it?
Clerk: It will be 18 dollars.
Johnny: Here you go, keep the change, hi doggie.
Clerk: You're my favorite customer.
Johnny: Thanks a lot. Bye.

That whole scene takes 19 seconds from when he's in and when he's out!!!! How in the right mind did the writer even convince himself this is natural? I used to think that talking in movies sometimes hit a little too close to home (as in, come on, does a movie have to have people talking about mundane things? I can do that in life?).  Watching this makes me appreciate John Cassavetes eons more than I already have before, and this incredibly laughable and unrealistic dialogue is probably one of the most surreal scenes I've ever seen in a movie, eve more so that it doesn't include shadow figures, doppelgangers, Lynchian visuals, Cronerberg wackiness, and Jodoroswky images.

I won't say much else, but rest assured, by god, have a tissue box handy.  You'll need it.  Enjoy, and remember one thing: It's only a movie!  Wait a second....",1291593600,4,3002,4.421818181818182

No, The Room is an incredibly entertaining, butt showing, cringe inducing, romp of a movie that (luckily for us) attempted to be serious.

For laughs per minute it is difficult to beat, for quotability it reaches the highs of The Big Lebowski and for nudity it triumphs in soft porn heaven. It is a film that ages well because its themes are timeless - Guns, Drugs and Tommy Wiseau's butt.

This film is best watched in a group, after a few drinks and when in need of a good long laugh.",1290384000,4,645,4.366666666666666
2464978,5,B000CFYAMC,"I first heard of ""The Room"" during my weekly visit to the Nostalgia Critic's website on July 13, 2010.  One of my friends and I both watched his review (and were devistated the week after when it was pulled because Wiseau was unhappy with the largely negative review).  The Critic recommended seeing this, and my bud and I knew it was our destiny to see it.  So, during a chat that week, I hunted through download sites to find the movie, and needless to say, we both found it, and spend the following night having our own little MST3K-esque viewing of the film.  We still talk about it to this day, and we are obsessed with it.

Quite frankly, it is hard not to become entangled in this film - I've set out to only watch a few minutes of it at a time, and before I know it, 99 minutes have passed, and I believe I blacked out...its the only explanation I can think of for why I don't recall anything after watching this movie.  It is so unusual, so complex in its delivery yet so simplistic in its dialogue.  The inconsistencies in the plot are unbelievable.  I also just can't figure out what makes Johnny so damn appealing.  Did they have to pay the young woman who played Lisa a ridiculous sum to ""sleep"" with him?  My friend and I love quoting this movie, especially Johnny's tirade on the roof (""I did not hit her, that's bullsheet!  I did not heet hur, I did naaaaht.  Oh hai Mark.""), Mark's constant ""Johnny's my best friend,"" and referring to Johnny's final ""temper tantrum"" at the end as ""the most passive temper tantrum in the world.""  And the kid, Denny...he has the most shocking lines in the film (""You look nice today...can I kiss you?""), and he just ""shows up"" conveniently.

I highly recommend seeing this film if killing time is your intention, and then chasing it with the Nostalgia Critic's review (Still available online thanks to some very dedicated Nostalgia Critic fans).  But, viewer beware, you will be sucked into the complex/simplistic web of this film, and will become obsessed with the Johnny/Lisa/Mark/Denny love square (I swear, Denny's got some love things going on here too!).",1289692800,2,2110,4.574468085106383

Otherwise, imagine this:  You can't sleep.  It's 3:30 AM.

2) They should have known better/what were they thinking? (IE ""Body of Evidence""--directed by Wolfgang Peterson, with Wilhem Dafoe, Madonna,  major studio, mega bucks).

That said I have the following compliments for The Room:

1)Wiseau got the thing done and released.  A big achievemnt for a novice.
2)It's his first film.  Let's see what happens down the road.
3)Directing yourself is very very difficult.

2464987,5,B000CFYAMC,"How does a movie achieve simultaneous and juxtaposing levels of brilliance and mediocrity at the same time?  By aspiring to great heights in every aspect of film making (writing, direction, acting, editing) and failing at every level in ever astounding and unique ways--that's how.  In this sense, Tommy Wiseau is, if any, a complete genius and worthy of endless praise.  So praise him here, I shall.

Not since Prince's Graffiti Bridge has a movie strived to say so much, but ended up saying so little...and with such awe inspiring, jaw dropping, exquisitely hideous writing, direction and acting! Like Graffiti Bridge, it is impossible to walk away from this movie without getting some sense that you've just witnessed a new low point in cinematic history--a tour de force of a milestone on the way to some hellish layer of artistic failure even Vanilla Ice's epic ""Cool as Ice"" could only dream to reach.  The mind boggles.  But unlike Graffiti Bridge, this movie deserves to be on blu-ray and watched....indeed, savored with friends.

You must see this film. You must.  You will laugh. You will cry. You'll do both at the same time, and the sounds of your laugher and sobbing will only be drowned out by the ever-present cheese-fest of R&B songs in the background used in place of dialogue during the insanely overblown lovemaking scenes.  My grandmother's meatloaf couldn't be stretched out further than the first roll in bed Johnny has with Lisa  For those of you with brave, unflinching gazes, can you please let me know if he's actually humping her belly button?  I still couldn't determine what he was humping, even when watching the exact same lovemaking sequences (spliced just a wee bit differently and accompanied by a different song) just two scenes later.  (yes, the movie can be timed according to lovemaking scenes or plot holes--whichever keeps your interests).
Not since Robbin Williams appeared in the buff has male nudity been so gratuitously flaunted in such an unnecessary---indeed, unnerving manner.

We can all forgive Johhny this as he works overtime in the movie through awkwardly delivered dialogue and other gestures to prove to us that this guy deserves to be the patron saint of San Fran!  My lord, he's helping drug addicted kids pay rent...he's buying roses all the time...he doesn't drink...except of course that one time Lisa made him drink a cocktail of Jack Daniels and Vodka with her (the second love making sequence where I believe he might be humping her belly button)--and the little tart accuses him of hitting her?!

What we have here is the classic  Shakespearean tragedy, wherein our protagonist, Johnny, has every intention of being the hero, but through fait and circumstance, has surrounded himself by people all out to do him wrong.  Johnny is just your average, every day banker...or is it computer technician--who can't seem to get a badly needed promotion.  Lisa, who obviously is a bit off kilter as one minute she's telling her mother that Johnny hit her and is a bad man, and the other minute is telling her mother that Johnny is putting their neighbor Denny through college, threatens to turn this entire masterpiece of a film into a story about her--sort of a memoirs of Lisa type of affair.

This of course never happens, as Tommy Wiseau's electrifying camera ""presence"" steals just about every scene that he appears in.  Lisa is reduced to a mere stage prop regardless the overacting abilities of the actress who plays her.  This is most evident when Denny is confronted by a drug dealer who wants his money back.  Denny apparently needed money, so he bought drugs and owes money--somehow, in this film it works, ok? It just works.  Both actresses playing Lisa and her mother do a fabulous job in that scene overacting and repeating lines that either disregard or ignore the events that just took place--for example, Lisa's mother insists that they call the police, even though Johnny and Mark just dragged the drug dealer (with very little effort) off to the ""police"" only seconds before.  Of course, with such strong emotional undercurrents boiling up--Lisa's mother obviously doesn't like Denny from the getgo, they can be forgiven for just devolving into senseless babble and tremendous overacting.  But within seconds, Johnny's appearance turns the otherwise confusing and overdramatic scene into a work of sublime brilliance--Wiseau manages to deliver such awful lines with such a juxtaposing mixture of ease and awkwardness I'd be surprised if you didn't stand up and cheer the scene in the end.  Over and over again, his appearance in scenes makes the Universe in which these characters exist alright again.

Sure, one can complain that the editing is awkward--the story seems to be out of sequence.  Sure, the scenes don't really know how to start and end.  Sure, the lovemaking scenes are endless.  Sure, the flowershop scene is almost Lynchian in it's delivery---I mean, is there more than 10 films in existence that have such an iconic scene as the flowershop scene?  For those of you who have no clue what I'm referring to, just look it up on youtube.  This movie is like mixing very dangerous and toxic elements and coming up with a compound as tasty as table salt on popcorn.  It's a must see event!

I have never laughed so much. Don't believe the description that this is a black comedy. It is not. It is melodrama gone horribly wrong. Tommy Wiseau is the single most disturbing, bizarre person I have ever laid my eyes on. His accent suggests he is secretly from another planet.
The sex scenes are overly long and paired with god awful RnB slow jams. ' You are my rose, you are my rose...' They are enough to put you off human contact for life. There is no warning on the box you WILL see Tommy Wiseau naked and it ain't pleasant. He appears almost reptilian. Juliette Danielle who played Lisa was a very brave woman.

Wiseau has no idea how to start or end a scene. Count how many times someone says 'Oh hi ....' As most people have mentioned, sub-plots are brought up and never mentioned again. The acting is mostly wooden but even the best actors would struggle with a script of this calibre. Look out for the flower shop scene - a superb example of how bad script writing can be.

I wish I lived in LA to attend one of the screenings. If you are going to watch this, get a group of friends together and look up the many drinking games on the internet.

Part of what makes this movie so hilarious is that everyone involved is obviously doing their absolutely best to make a drama.

They didn't. That's where a few friends, a pizza, and a night in come in handy.

If you guessed anything but ""The Room,"" then you need to reacquaint yourself with the movie world. This may not be the worst movie ever made (I actually made myself watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Manos-the-Hands-of-Fate/dp/B0000AGWMF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Manos, the Hands of Fate</a>!), but it's definitely down in the bottom ten -- it's brain-meltingly slow, stuffed with random scenes that accomplish nothing, and has some of the worst acting I've ever assaulted my eyeballs with.

Writer/director/producer/""actor"" Tommy Wiseau plays Johnny, a guy living in San Francisco with his fiancee Lisa (Juliette Danielle). When they aren't having slow weird sex, they are hanging around rooftops with their friend Mark (Greg Sestero) or with the world's oldest teenager Denny (Phillip Haldiman). But for some reason Lisa gets sick of Tommy and decides to have sex with Mark (who always seems shocked when she does).

There's technically stuff going on in the meantime, such as random people coming to the house to have sex, Lisa's mom revealing she has cancer, a gun-toting drug dealer, and Lisa repeatedly telling everybody that she doesn't love Johnny anymore. But don't worry, none of this actually matters. In fact, if you shaved off all the random filler scenes, this movie would be about twenty minutes long... and if you shaved off the horribly boring sex scenes, it would be five.

Let's get this out of the way: ""The Room"" is a steaming pile of excrement. But this is not a run-of-the-mill horrible movie -- there are literally no upsides to this movie. The writing is ghastly (""I did not hit her. I did NAHT. Oh, hi Mark""), the direction is awful, the acting will make your eyes bleed, and there are freaky moments sprinkled throughout it (a creepiy teenager rolling around on a bed with a couple about to have sex).

And the acting is so bad that it's actually fun to watch. Oh, most of the actors are merely wooden, bland or absurd, but Tommy Wiseau reaches levels of acting badness that Jennifer Lopez can only dream of. He looks and acts like a zombie that has been dried to beef-jerky and then rehydrated, and speaks in a weird sort of New-Yawk-by-way-of-Paris accent. And his acting... hoo boy, if you can get through the ""You're lyyyying to me Lisa. You're tearing me APAHT!"" scene without laughing, I will pay you money.

""The Room"" seems like it was written/directed by a half-asleep monkey with ADD, and the only good thing I can say about it is that it doesn't star Jar Jar Binks. But at least it makes for a hilarious MST3K experience.",1284336000,18,3711,6.530487804878049

Actually this movie is just hilarious (if you can make it through the sex scenes). It's pretty poorly made and you'll wonder if Tommy Wiseau has ever interacted with another human being. All in all I consider it a must buy and completely understand its cult following.",1282867200,2,585,4.580952380952381
2464995,5,B000CFYAMC,"Take it for what it is:  a poorly-written, directed, acted, shot, and edited movie with tons of charm.

Johnny, played by the film's writer/director/producer Tommy Wiseau, has an ambiguous accent and says some of the best lines you will ever hear in a movie.  He will constantly remind you, the viewer, that he is the nicest guy in the world.  Despite his greatness, everyone betrays him.

There are many plot holes and inconsistencies in the dialogue.  Johnny works at a bank or in the computer business, and he has been with his fiancee Lisa for 5 or 7 years; no one can seem to remember.  Lisa's mother has breast cancer, but she only mentions it once.  Their neighbor Denny needs money, so he buys drugs.  There are a lot of establishing shots of San Francisco that don't need to be there.  Johnny is capable of buying flowers, carrying on a conversation, and returning to his car all within 19 seconds.  In the middle of the movie, one character disappears and another one randomly emerges.  I could give a complete plot summary and a list of all the memorable quotes, but there are other places you can find all that.

The reason this movie is watchable is that it WASN'T shot by a few 16-year-olds with a video camera.  It had a 6 million dollar budget, was shot professionally, and was taken very seriously by the director.  The end result comes across as a spoof of soap-operas and softcore porn.

If you're not lucky enough to see ""The Room"" in a theater with audience participation, you'll still enjoy watching the DVD with your friends.  I still have yet to hear the Rifftrax for it.",1281744000,,1595,4.579505300353357
2464996,1,B000CFYAMC,"Tommy Wiseau's ""The Room"" is an incredibly bad film. Wiseau wrote, directed, produced and starred in it, and he failed in all four roles. The film ranges from awful and inept to being, at times, almost nonsensical. Some characters are completely undeveloped and seem utterly unnecessary to the film, and often times, seemingly important subplots are introduced and then abandoned. For example, one character reveals that she has breast cancer, and thats never referenced again in the rest of the film. Literally nothing works; its like a really awful and painfully long deleted scenes section.

And yet...I found myself strangely entertained. Actors speak their lines as if they're reading off cue cards, and there are several awful and completely superfluous love scenes in the film that come off as unintentionally hilarious. The film is filled with obvious continuity errors and bad dubbing; on any sort of technical level, this is a disaster, but it fails in a way that is so massively fun and entertaining.

2464998,3,B000CFYAMC,"Simon Cowell has said that the true appeal of ""American Idol"" is not that America gets to create stars out of those it deems the most talented and charismatic, but in the cruelty derived from watching the early audition contestants make fools of themselves. There's something so appealing in watching people so delusional about their strengths, skill, and talent, and so seduced by ambition and the desire for attention, that they completely humiliate themselves publicly in search of the wrong dream.

This Schadenfreude, the taking of joy in the misfortune of others, is what makes ""The Room"" so appealing.

Tommy Wiseau was obviously ambitious and hardworking enough to get a movie made, which he wrote, directed and stars in. Sadly, what he lacks is any talent or skill, as either a writer, director, or actor, and the result is a train wreck of such epic proportions that it has become a camp and cult classic.

I'll admit it: I watched it. I laughed. It's jaw-droppingly bad. But I don't intend on repeat viewings. (I've never been a fan of AI either.)",1280188800,8,1058,4.834254143646409

For anyone that hasn't seen this movie, understand that Tommy went into this film completely serious with every intention to make an American Drama. And THAT is why this film is so fricken hilarious. Not because it is intentionally trying to be funny.

If you market this as a comedy, then you completely lose the reason why it's funny in the first place...this movie is hilarious precisely because it's NOT supposed to be a comedy.

Now layer on Tommy's intentions for a serious drama about love and betrayal (and his insights into human relationships) with seriously horrible writing, acting, story-telling, directing, filming, editing, set design and timing...and you get one of the unintentionaly worst movies ever made.

Which is exactly why this movie is so genuinely hilarious to watch.

2465002,5,B000CFYAMC,"I would like to take this opportunity to thank one of my best friends for showing me one of the worst movie of all time. Under normal circumstances, I usually find a bad movie by accident and I will then be drawn to it like a psychotic horse towards a burning stable. Movies like Batman and Robin, Battlefield Earth, and Alone in the Dark fall under this catagory. I will see these movies once in their entirety and then never see them again without wanting to vomit violently. However this was the first time I could remember someone handing this craptastic masterpiece to me. Here was a movie that was so bad that it wasn't good, it was magnificent. The movie was written, produced, directed by Euro Trash god Tommy Wiseau, a man whose acting, directing, writting and producing are so bad that I would rather be waterboarded at gitmo than be in the same room with this maniac. I should perhaps apologize for that last remark because this movie is so gloriously bad that Tommy should have gotten an Oscar for his directing, cinematography, and Orwellian acting that elevates him from ordinary man into an unstopable ogre of hilarity. I can say this for certain: if I saw Tommy Wiseau on the street I would drop to my knees and thank him for making the worst movie of the last 100 years of cinema. I would also tell him that he is the SECOND COMING OF ED WOOD!!!!! This is the PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE for the 21st century. Everything about this film is in a word: BLAHHHHHH!!!! The musical score is fragmented and overly dramatic. When there is a sex scene the music is sappy and suprisingly incomplete. The set pieces are basic and boring and I realized that most of the award winning soft core porn films on skinamax had better acting than this. The plot is so standard that it was made on cardboard, the subplots are poorly thought out and never go anywhere (like when the girlfriend's mother tells her daughter that she has breast cancer so casually that it NEVER GETS REPEATED AGAIN in the movie. I won't give away what happens in the movie, not because I would be spoiling something but because it really needs to be seen to be believied. See it and then show it to your friends and make them show it their friends because this is a perfect movie to watch and laugh at for all the wrong or right reasons.

As we all know Tommy Wiseau is a modern day shakespeare, his subtle acting techniques are only equalled by pieces of wood and stagnant grass. This guy deserves either locking up or an oscar ceremony all to himself he's that good. The film is absolute nonsense with 3 love scene's in the first 10 minutes, with the jowl faced Lisa. The rest of the cast seem ill at ease with the direction from Wiseau and plunder from scene to scene like if its the amateur dramatical societys day off. Most of it seems to be shot in a cardboard set with the outdoor scenes dubbed out of sync for some reason only Wiseau is aware of. Hi Doggie and your tearing me apart Lisa are the highlight statements of the movie, you can see these and many more soundbites on utube, because the movie has become a massive cult hit. Simply because its an absolute crock of poop, Weirdly enough though you seem to find yourself rooting for Johnny /Tommy Wiseau as the slag like Lisa seems to try and destroy him like a T-1000 with a nark on.

2465006,4,B000CFYAMC,"I've watched this movie twice now, and rewatched individual scenes countless times.  I watched it with my wife, split in two halves.  Each time we watched some of it, we stayed up for awhile talking about it.
It is not the worst movie made; the worst movies are those that are never screened.  This is a competently made movie.  It is watchable, it is shot in a way that makes it understandable.
But much like Spinal Tap - the band is technically fine, but they just have really bad taste.
This movie is packed with bad decision after bad decision.  Some of what I've read about the project explains why it turned out so strange.

The dialogue is not as over-the-top as Ed Wood's was.  This dialogue is bad on multiple levels.  When you listen to a conversation, every nuance of line, and every subtext creates one level of badness right on top of the previous one, before any of them has a chance to resolve.

For some reason, most of Johnny's dialogue is poorly dubbed.  There are a few reasons for this, detailed more extensively on Wikipedia.  This lends a very peculiar feel to the movie - almost like you're dreaming the whole thing.

I could say that this movie is the perfect bad movie, except for one thing - the sex scenes go on too long.  They move from being campy and bad-funny to just being boring.  But to be fair, the novelty is restored by the recycled footage used in them.

The DVD itself is acceptable.  It's fine for the price it has, but I'd actually like some more extras.  A commentary would be nice.  The behind-the-scenes footage is surprisingly boring.  The deleted scenes just are an alternate version of an existing scene, shot in a different location.

The interview with Wiseau is fascinating as well.  He actually dubs his own lines occasionally during it!

The movie is so strange, so surreal, and filled with such bad judgment that the net result is an unforgettable product.  But it's so puzzling that you won't be able to explain it to your friends effectively.",1267056000,7,1997,4.563380281690141

Writer/director/producer/actor Tommy Wiseau is a jack of all trades visonary genius who could very well be the offspring of Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg.  Call him the Hitchcock of black comedy, the Orson Welles of symbolism, and the Martin Scorsese of sex scenes.  His foresight knows know limits.  He will plunder your heart and soul and leave you on the floor, breathless, panting for more of his vivid and penetrating mis-en-scene and astute aural pleasure enchanted with both harmony and discord.

Condemnation as you relive your past failures.

But while The Room will have you calling into question the insane lament that you now find yourself dangling by, you will elope with your new lover and find solace in it's affair, it's tortuous ownership of your heart.  Such is the masochistic nature by which you must now live.  But do not fret!

Questions that had puzzled me for years suddenly began making sense in ""the room"". I reconsidered everyone I knew, everything I thought I'd learned. And I found I didn't have much company...due to the small size of ""the room"" I was in.

It's taken me two years to write about this movie, not without reason. One terrifying side effect of learning the world isn't the way you think, is that it leaves you all alone in ""the room"". And when you try to describe your new worldview to people, it either comes out sounding unsurprising or like pure lunacy and people slowly back away.

Ever since then, I've realized that I need to spend my life working to fix the shocking brokenness I'd discovered. And the best way to do that, I concluded, was to try to share what I'd discovered with others, in ""the other room"". I couldn't just tell them it straight out, I knew, so I had to provide the hard evidence...in that same room. So I started working on ""the other room"" to do just that.

It's been two years now and my mind has settled down some. I've learned a bunch more but, despite my best efforts, haven't found any problems with this frightening new world view.

2465023,5,B000CFYAMC,"This movie is a mess!  Like a heap of refuse with several stinky discarded items mixed in a pile, somehow when all these pieces of junk are fused together it somehow transforms into a diamond of sorts. There are many us who have a peculiar attachment for bad movies.  We love to revel in the awfullness and laugh at the unfortunate ineptitude of the movie makers.  It may sound a bit cruel, but these filmmakers asked us to pay money for their product and expect an honest reaction to their ""vision"", so it's really just part of the artistic process.

Back to ""The Room""; it was created by, perhaps this generation's Ed Wood, Tommy Wiseau.  Yes this stringy haired autuer starred, wrote, directed and produced the hell out of this film.  So what is The Room?  It's obvious that Mr. Wiseau intended to make a dark, dramatic story of betrayal.  As the title character Johhny, he's a saint.  Generous, romantic, a successful banker(?), adoptive father (sort of), and beloved by most of the inhabitants of San Fransisco.  Unfortunately our saintly hero is being betrayed by his employer, fiancee and his best friend.  Poor Johnny slowly unravels under all these malicous attacks.  The most cutting of all is the wretched infidelity of his ""bee-yutiful"" girlfriend Lisa with his football tossing best friend, Mark.  Lisa trys to tarnish sweet Johnny's character by claiming that he hit her in a drunken rage.  Nothing will stop this evil harpie from ruining Johhny; she seduces his bestfriend into uh... the stairs(?) and lies to Johnny about being pregnant.  Everything comes to a head at Johnny's birthday party.  In front of all of Johhny's legions of friends and admirers, slutty, evil Lisa exposes her affair and announces that she's not going to marry him.  Everyone leaves and Johnny locks himself in the can.  Stunningly, bee-yutiful but horrid Lisa half heartedly tries to talk him out of the bathroom, but tires quickly of it.  She calls Mark and, rather loudly, announces that Johnny is a baby and she wants to see him.  After heartless Lisa leaves, an anguished Johnny yells like a wounded animal.  He angrily trashes his apartment and then tragically ends it all.  The betrayers, Mark & Lisa, discover the body and become desconsolate.  Sobbing, Mark spurns the manipulative Lisa and the ""adopted"" son Denny, rushes in overcome with the death of his mentor and protector.  Tears from the audience, standing ovation THE END.

What Tommy Wiseau envisioned and what he created however, were to disparate things.  Instead of a dark dramatic pyscoligical epic, from a lucky convergence of incompetence was created a cult favorite of bad film.  This film has it all; lame dialogue, performances that alternate between wooden and scene-munchingly over the top.  Classic movie lines like, ""Yew ur tearing me apart, Lisa!!!"" and characters that are breathtakingly bizarre.  Take for example Denny, the so called adoptive son.  He was out on the street and ,heriocally, Johnny gets him an apartment in their building and pays his tuition for school.  Early in the movie, Johnny, Lisa and Denny are together in Johnny's apartment.  Johnny and Lisa decide to go upstairs for some horizontal recreation.  Within moments, Denny sneaks upstairs watchs for a little and then jumps on the bed.  The two lovers explain that 3 is a crowd and Denny announces that he likes to watch (shudder).

Then we have the femme fatale, Lisa, who is alleged to be so bee-yutiful by all throughout the movie.  While she isn't a hump-backed troll, she isn't the goddess she's being purported to be.  More accurately, she looks like an attractive linebacker for the Chicago Bears.  Her evil machinations are meant to make our hero, Johnny more sympathetic, but every instance is so contrived due to the inept writing and acting, that the audience is at first stunned.  When the putridity continues, the audience starts to laugh with incredulity.

By some bizarre cosmic convergence, this stinky cinematic piece has gained some financial success.  Around the nation, people are coming in droves to watch THE ROOM at midnight shows.  It has become the new Rocky Horror Show, as a audience participation film.  People scream out their favorite lines or add new responses.  Loads of patrons bring plastic spoons and toss them at the screen during a particular scene in the movie.  Unlike many bad movies, which are mind numbingly boring, The Room sort of puts you in a trance.  You can't look away, you're hypnotized by this perfect storm of visual carrion.",1258156800,6,4526,4.935099337748344

2465026,5,B000CFYAMC,"It isn't until movies like Tommy Wiseau's The Room that I find a problem with the one-dimensional five-star rating system that often treats movies.

 In short, The Room is bad.  Really bad.  But giving The Room half of a star strikes me as unwarranted cruelty, as it is just terrible enough to be entertaining.

 The Room is written, directed, and produced by Tommy Wiseau, and he seems to be an amateur in all of those trades.  One might wonder why nobody in the crew questioned Wiseau's methods, and the reason might just because he is large, intimidating, and has a thick, monster-like European accent.  This is evident because he also cast himself as the lead actor of the movie, and his acting is no better.  However, none of the other ""actors"" are much more talented than Wiseau.  This might work for the movie's advantage, because their stiff, dry speech often distracts from the unnatural dialogue and unoriginal plot.  The story is no different than any soap opera episode:  a pure (but unintentionally frightening) banker named Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) slowly learns that his fiance, Lisa (Juliette Danielle), is having an affair with his best friend(Greg Sestero).  However, there are still enough plot holes to keep this melodrama from being unforgivably uninteresting.

 Although Tommy Wiseau's character is supposed to be the victim, I can't help but to pity the other actors, and I blame their lack of passion on the possibility that they just want to get out of the movie as soon as possible.  Nobody seems interested (or perhaps capable or brave enough) to change any of the stale writing in Wiseau's script; there is an over-abundance of the phrases ""Oh hi, character"" and ""Don't worry about it"" that appear regardless of context or appropriate emotion.  In one scene, Danielle even tells her mother to ""not worry about it"" after she reveals that she has breast cancer.

 If you ever get a chance to see this movie, I urge you to take some friends and watch it.  Although meant to be a drama, Wiseau has produced one of the funniest movies of the new millennium.  The Room should not be watched unprepared, however:  The film features four sex scenes that, strangely enough, are incredibly uninteresting.  They are all unnecessarily long, and are altogether unnecessary.  However, The Room does not deserve to be missed by any movie fan who enjoys having something to mock.",1255132800,3,2388,4.883084577114428
2465027,5,B000CFYAMC,"When you gaze into the intoxicating eyes of Tommy Wiseau on the cover the DVD you are immediately under his spell. There are plenty of things to warn you about in the god-awful, fantastic, life-changing movie but in this review I prefer to focus on the DVD cover. From top to bottom. Let's start with the top. Wiseau gratefully let's us all know that this film is in fact widescreen. This fact alone enhances the viewing experience. It was, after all, shot in film and video via a monstrosity created by welding both technologies together and shot in 16:9. So the fact he did not deprive us of all of the garbage that takes place in the wings of a 4:3 film is a blessing. Moving down...I am particularly fond of the probably [..] font chosen to brandish the title in our faces. The soft-edge bevel and light shadow provided by Photoshop 3.0 were both nice touches as well. Let's ignore the fact that the title is neither centered nor properly offset. Even when you consider the ridiculous drop mirror (oops forgot the bevel and shadow) it is still not right. Through the graphical placement of the title Tommy gives a little insight to the madness of the film within.

Let's talk about the hair. The term 'three-day-coke-bender' comes to mind when I look at the disheveled mess of octopus-ink blank hair. Nick Nolte's mug shot called and wanted a word with the stylist. My colleagues and I are unable to agree on whether that is his real hair or an abandoned wig lifted from the set of Edward Scissorhands. The apex of his forehead features the slightest indication of a vampirical widow's peak. Why? Some mysteries are meant to stay mysteries. The right side of his coif is particularly baffling. It is a sideways bird's nest made out of black string. Both sides of his face are flanked by an oil-black river of face-cradling brilliance as if to say, 'Look what I am holding. It's my baby. He may not be pretty but I love him so.'

The forehead is a vast wasteland that serves no purpose other than providing a platform to which the hair-mess is stapled.

The left eyebrow, slightly raised, says 'I am thinking about something'. The right eyebrow, well the whole right side of the face, hints at either brain damage or bell's palsy. Probably both.

It is difficult to ascertain if Tommy has a lazy eye or non-bilateral eyelids. Assuming he is human and does not have lazy eye or non-bilateralism, one can only conclude that his left, the viewer's right, eyelid lost interest in the photo shoot. About halfway through the session the eyelid started mailing it in, drifting to sleep. In fact you could surmise that the only saving grace of the DVD cover is the intelligence of Tommy Wiseau's left eyelid. It is telling us, 'at the end of this movie, you will close your eyes and wonder wtf just happened?'

The eyes are the focal point. One would think that Tommy would go with the sweet inviting eyes like the sad ones he used in the 'You are family, Denny' sequence. But no, he chose to the 'I am distraught and confused and will throw this four ounce television out the window' glare. And then the television will defy the laws of physics and change its trajectory like Oswalt's magic bullet. He went with those eyes. The eyes are those of a savant. Some savants are born with the innate ability to play the violin like a grand master but cannot tie their own shoes or wipe themselves. Tommy Wiseau is a savant that has the innate ability to make a bad movie. His eyes tell us this.

The nose is a nose.

I am transfixed by his pouty lips. He is about to kiss the lens. Or he has a throat lozenge on his tongue. His teeth are clenched but his colorless lips hide this fact. The palsy has migrated onto his left lower lip. These are the lips of a mad scientist deftly combining every conceivable bad idea for a movie into one gigantic stinky festering mess.

'Can You Really Ever Trust Anyone?' Good question. In fact since proudly pouring out ten bucks for this fantastic piece of crap I wonder if I can trust my own judgement. Again, he went with the drop shadow but chose an out-of pallet-family reddish hue for the lifeless nondescript font. It is not so much italicized as it is kind of just drifting to the right like it is about to leave. It is good to know that the 'generic slug line generator' was functioning on the day that 'Can you really trust anyone' was birthed.

""Experience this quirky new black comedy, it's a riot!""

Hmm.

Some alternatives that I would've been happier with include:

""Wear Depends adult diapers when you watch this!""
""Experience this accidentally hysterical abomination of filmic art!""
""Learn how to play football sree feet apart!""
""Everything you ever wanted to learn about properly installing air conditioning conduit in a Paraguayan bait camp but were afraid to ask!""

Quirky black comedy? Really? This movie is no more an intentional 'quirky black comedy' than the Hindenberg disaster was an intentional landing exercise for a distressed dirigible. It is one thing to insult our eyes with Johnny's unnecessary butt-shot. It's one thing to insult my ears with the dulcet tones of Clint Gamboa's ""I Will"". But it is another thing entirely to insult my intelligence by trying to sell me that this project was an intentional black comedy. This is an intentional black comedy? So was the Numa Huma kid.

But the phrase was in italics, enclosed in quotes, and sitting comfortably atop yet another drop shadow.

2465028,5,B000CFYAMC,"This is a GEM when it comes to horrible movies! I have heard this compared to 'Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and while 'The Room' might have a similar cult following there is one huge difference...Rocky Horror was SUPPOSED to be a bizarre, freaky, cheesy and badly made comedy...Where as 'The Room' it appears that Tommy Wiseau put all his heart, soul and money into making a brilliant drama and instead ended up with one bizarre, freaky, cheesy and frighteningly bad movie...AND IT'S HILARIOUS!

I will warn you though...Unless you are a fan of bad movies, don't watch this! Only watch this if you have a good sense of humor and you enjoy shouting creative insults at the screen. Otherwise you'll probably consider this movie really boring and a waste of time. The best way to watch this is drunk in a big group of obnoxious, loud people! If you watch it alone, I suggest playing the Rifftrax that goes with it. This makes it a lot funnier when alone or in a group.

So what's the movie about? It's about Johnny (played by Wiseau) a scraggly-haired, pale, scary looking banker with an unknown strange accent. We are supposed to believe Johnny is a ""normal"" guy, very in love with his future wife Lisa. We see him shower Lisa with gifts and we see a blindingly scary and loooooong love scene...then for whatever reason, Lisa decides to sleep with Johnny's best friend Mark. Things just get more muddled after this and after a while you don't even care about the plot because you are too busy marveling over this train wreck! There are lots of other pointless sub-plots that you would expect to go somewhere but they don't. I won't spoil the ending (though I doubt 'spoiling' this movie is possible) but I will say that it leaves you with more questions than answers.

First off, why does Lisa have really thick, dark eyebrows and bleached out hair? Why are all these guys making a fuss and going on about her 'beauty' when she isn't even hot? Why is Johnny's suit so lumpy looking? Is it because of his wiry, leathery, lumpy and unattractively muscled body (the show it several times and in the nude scenes, in fact everyone in this seems to have a weird looking body) that he obviously thinks is attractive? Why are the characters playing football in such close proximity while wearing tuxedos? Why is the dialogue so unnatural sounding? What has more holes, the plot or Swiss cheese? What is wrong with Denny? Why does nearly every scene begin with someone saying ""Oh Hi So-and-so""? Who is the random, uninvited couple doing stuff in another couple's living room? Why are there framed photos of spoons decorating Johnny and Lisa's home? Where is this Room? Why did they use a really fake looking (and probably expensive) green screen to look like a smoggy version of San Francisco during the roof scenes? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to rent a rooftop in Los Angeles to create an ugly, smoggy skyline? How many drugs were consumed during the making of this film? And finally, WHY GOD WHY does Lisa mix Scotch and Vodka together?

The world may never know the answers and maybe that it part of the appeal of this movie. How and why something so awful could ever be created is nothing short of a miracle. Call it a fluke, call it horrible, call it brilliant but one thing is for certain: Badness of this epic proportion only happens once in a lifetime. Normally bad movies fade into obscurity and end up on the 50% rack at a dollar store but for whatever reason, this movie has captured the hearts and induced the nausea of millions of people...And that's just COOL!

One final note to anyone with the bright idea of making a ""Scotchka"" drink like in the movie. DON'T! It's a bad, bad idea people! If you can actually get past the taste, it can make a person very ill, especially if you drink it during the love scenes in this movie...Be warned!",1254009600,12,3843,4.588064046579331

2465031,3,B000CFYAMC,"... it just wasn't that bad. I actually purchased this after I saw a news item on blocks long lines of people waiting to see this film ala ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"".  What I was expecting was ""so bad it's good"". And yes, it is not good, but it is also not so bad that it would really qualify for MST3K. Granted, there are lots of hallmarks of bad filmmaking - wooden performances, strange reactions, subplots that go into a brick wall, and what is it with that footage of Alcatraz between every scene?  This is the story of Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) and his fiancee, Lisa, who discovers she is bored with Johnny shortly before their wedding. A cast of characters pop chaotically in and out of the plot, which include Johnny's voyeuristic young ward and Johnny's best friend who winds up sleeping with Lisa, but does at least show his loyalty to Johnny by whining about it before, during, and after. Lisa's mom's performance is certainly one for the books. She casually mentions she has cancer as though she has mentioned a hangnail and then nothing is ever said about it again. Lisa certainly doesn't seem that worried about her mother's impending doom. Maybe her lack of concern is understandable considering her mother is always telling her she needs to stay with Johnny since Lisa doesn't have what it takes to make it in the job market and needs someone to take care of her. This is a mother figure the way Howard Hughes used to write them.

This whole film viewing experience leads me to one conclusion - young people today are both spoiled and deprived when it comes to film. They are spoiled in the sense that they think this is the worst film in history just because of the rather cheap sets and oddly constructed storyline. Independent filmmakers that make such films as a rule have been priced out of the market, and all that is widely released today are prepackaged superhero films with special effects to dazzle and scripts that have no impact on the soul. Young people are also deprived since they don't get to see much ""so bad it's good"" filmmaking either. If you want to see truly bad films that entertain buy some of the 50 movie pack Horror and Sci-Fi film packs - they're cheap - and feast your eyes on ""The Killer Shrews"" with dogs suited up in bath mats as the shrews.

I gave this film three stars because more stars would say it's a good film, which it isn't, and less stars would say it is really bad, possibly to the point of being interesting, and it's not that either.

The three-star rating that coincides with this review does not actually reflect what I think of the film. There aren't a lot of critical reviews out there, so the chances of readers discovering my review are that much higher. Furthermore, let me also say that I respect amazon as a service, and it's probably my most common method of making online transactions.

Now that my introduction's out of the way, it's time to get down to brass tax: if you purchase the aforementioned film from Tommy Wiseau's website, not only can you acquire it for a cheaper price, but upon request, he will actually autograph the DVD at no extra charge. I won't even bother to post the website because amazon tends to delete that kind of stuff, but if you search for a combination of Tommy Wiseau and the Room using the google search engine, you should eventually stumble onto it. For me, not only did he sign his name, but he composed a small message of gratitude and included my name within the message. All I had to do was write a check for $9.75, and since there's no shipping charges, it's actually cheaper than purchasing it off of amazon.

2465038,3,B000CFYAMC,"After watching ""The Room"" twice, I've come to the conclusion that this isn't really a movie. It's a work of art. And like most Modern Art, it's difficult to explain.

Without a doubt, this is the most awful piece of cinema put on film. And watching this movie is an exercise in self-torture. In fact, this is something that should be outlawed by the Geneva Convention as a torture method. Forget waterboarding and other methods, the CIA should be using this to extract information from targets before the UN and the ACLU gets wind of this film.

But let's get to the plot: Johnny, played by the director, Tommy Wiseau, is a banker who is engaged to Lisa (Juliette Danielle). Lisa's an extremely manipulative woman who ends up bringing Mark, Johnny's friend into a love triangle.

The movie is billed as a black comedy about love, lies, passion and betrayal. It's funny, alright, but not a black comedy. This is a really awful drama, featuring actors who can't, a production that is topped by most elementary school productions on a $20 budget, and a lack of continuity that would make Ed Wood feel ashamed.

Again, this is an awful movie. But why 3 stars? This film is hypnotic. It's awful, but it's hilarious. The acting and dialogue are so awful that you think that the actors are actually acting to be that bad because there's no way that they can possibly *BE* that bad.

But why 3 stars? Like all bad movies, some have redeeming qualities. It's important to separate trash from superior trash, and The Room is superior trash simply because it's downright hilarious. Much as some sadists enjoy inflicting pain on others, there's a sick joy that you feel when you share this experience with friends and family (presumably, under the influence of alcohol.) In turn, they'll want to spread word of this movie. Like a modern art masterpiece, it will leave your heads scratching, your eyes hurting and your mind screaming ""YOU'RE TEARING ME APART LISA!""

2465042,5,B000CFYAMC,"Spoiler alert at bottom of review, so be warned.

Let's see... You've got Wiseau himself looking and sounding like a bad impersonation of Christopher Walken crossed with Arnold Schwarzenegger; his selfish, cheating fianc who looks (a little) like Courtney Love, and his best friend - an Owen Wilson wanna-be - caught up in a tragic story of love and betrayal. And horrible dialogue.
This movie is so bad it's great!

I don't know if Tommy Wiseau intended for this film to be the cult-classic it is based on it's cheesy acting and production. He struck gold either way. I watched the interview with him in the special features before I even watched the film and knew I was in for a treat. This thing makes soap operas look like Masterpiece Theatre by comparison. I mean, it is soap opera-ish, but oh, Sooooo BADLY done.

Dan Aykroyd should do a little return to Leonard Pinth-Garnell on SNL and give this Bad Cinema a proper review. You remember when his white-gloved hand tossed the film reel into the waste can. Ah, the early days of SNL... But I digress.

I won't give away the thrilling conclusion of this monstrosity, but my fall-off-the-sofa, rolling-in-pain favorite line was WAKE UP, JOHNNY!!!

Get a few friends together, watch this disc and have a pee-party.
Just be sure to have plenty of cleaning products on hand to remove the stains from your upholstery. Better yet, just line your sofa with plastic, like they did back in the old days.

SPOILER ALERT!! SPOILER ALERT!! SPOILER ALERT!! SPOILER ALERT!!

Upon reflection, I suspect this movie is completely autobiographical on Tommy Wiseau's part. Right down to the thrilling conclusion. I figure he actually survived at the end, and with what mental capacity he had left to work with after blowing his brains out, he just had to tell his story. How else could a film this bad be written/directed/acted etc.?

I mean, it takes much more than the perfect alignment of all the planets in the solar system to make a movie of this magnitude.  Suckers like me who spent money in this recession to watch this gotta be damned beyond recognition when we die.  The idea of watching this is enough to taint my family's name.  The fact that I paid to see it, it tarnished the good names of all my ancestors.

In fact, it is a damn miracle that I am still alive - it takes at least 10 times the Michael Jackson medication overdose to be drugged enough to actually willing to see this movie, let alone paying to see it.  We are all just human, no?

I am not going to repeat the alleged plot-line in this alleged film.  The acting is so bad, you wonder if this is a collection of the worst botched acting auditions since color film was invented.  May be it's truly so, since this is also the only way I could explain why the story line is such.  One of my sucker colleagues (I have many sucker colleagues since we are all in Wall Street working together to destroy this country)  told me this movie looks messed up since it is from the standpoint of the main character when he is hopelessly stoned (may be he's thinking in terms of Hector Berlioz's ""Symphonie Fantastique"").  Oh please.  I need no Tylenol when I put an loaded handgun in my mouth, you see?

But then again, even the most randomly made feces could be visualized in an abstract way to look like some sort of art form.  It's purely our imagination - it's all in our head - it's much more than any meaningful message conveyed in this film (if there is any at all).

2465045,5,B000CFYAMC,"Ok, imagine there was a real-life Borat, someone who was so foreign to basic American customs and social behavior, someone whose language skills were limited to basic words and non-sequiturs gathered from reading bad pulp novels and hanging out with high-school dropouts behind 7-Eleven.  Now imagine that this Borat-like individual had rich relatives, and had decided to self-finance a film that he wrote, produced, directed and starred in.  Lastly, imagine him with a long black hairdo circa Scorpions 1985, and imagine his body looking like a weirdly muscular Mr. Burns from the Simpsons and you're starting to get the picture.

The Room has been described as a work of cinematic genius, and I think that if we accept the definition of ""genius"" as a person capable of achieving what others can not, then Tommy Wiseau definitely fits the definition!

The Room is not comparable to Troma films, or even bad Skinemax late night offerings, these are films which embrace their campiness and understand their audiences.  Ed Wood might be a closer comparison, but even then, there are profound differences between the two men's approach to filmmaking and acting which make the similarities few.

Wiseau is without a doubt one-of-a-kind, and The Room is a film the likes of which is not likely to surface ever again.  There is no doubt that Wiseau was attempting to create a profound and touching drama which would ""put him on the map"", something that would appeal to a wide range of audiences and be picked up by a studio for distribution launching Tommy's career into pop culture heaven.  Well, he did achieve fame, only not in the way he intended!

The Room is a collection of a cinematic bad decision after another, starting with as absurdly poor script, followed by casting choices which perplex, continuing with set design and art direction which borders on the bizarre (framed photos of spoons, TV's behind the couch), and culminating with greenscreen visual fx comparable to those you see at amusement parks ""magic carpet ride"" video booths.  Truth be told, it is almost impossible to achieve this combination of badness, and The Room might be the first time ever that in the history of cinema these many bad decisions were made.  It is abundantly clear that these were not intentional choices in an effort to create what Tommy now describes as a ""dark comedy.""  It is also abundantly clear that anyone else setting out to make a movie like The Room is unfortunately destined to fall flat on their face.

The Room is a series of (happy?) accidents, a collection of improbable events, something that borders awfully close to Performance Art!

If you can, watch this in a theatre or with a large group of funny and rowdy friends.  Watching in solitude with the wrong attitude will only lead to the type of response that a friend of mine had when he said ""I'm glad I didn't pay to see The Room...I didn't get the humour.""

My buying advice?  Try to see this movie at one of the screening locations if you can, and afterwards buy the DVD since you'll be able to crack yourself up laughing without the need of an audience just from the memory of all the things which were shouted at the screen.

If the film is not playing anywhere close to where you live, then invite a bunch of friends over, stock up on beverages and plastic spoons, read up everything that you can (no spoiler alerts needed) starting with the Wikipedia entry, and then enjoy the film in its unbelievable absurdity!

P.S.

Unfortunitly, I can't say that I admire his talent, because this is one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen. This is a black comedy? Even the most bleakest of black comedies, like 'Catch 22' or 'Brazil', have something funny in it and I saw nothing that was funny, unintentionally or otherwise, about this movie. I had more laughs at my mother's funeral.

A story about a woman who cheats on her lover with his best friend is unappealing in itself, but making it without humor and calling it a comedy? All I can say is I hate to see his idea of what a depressing drama is.

How this movie got labled a 'cult classic' is another mystery unto me. Even 'bad' movies like 'The Giant Claw' and 'Godzilla vs. Megalon' at least have the campy appeal to become cult films, something 'The Room' doesn't have.

I caught the movie on Adult Swim and was puzzled why a boring drama had replaced funny cartoons, then I remembered that it was April Fool's Day.

Acting so wooden it may give you splinters, a script that makes little sense, characters that just turn up from nowhere and do nothing before dissapearing again, awful greenscreening, cheap sets, more melodrama than a daytime soap opera and the most inadvertantly hilarious one liners you've ever heard.

It is however, so stunningly awful in every imaginable way, as to cross the line into sublime entertainment. At the heart of this trainwreck is of course, Tommy Wiseau. His screenwriting and directing abilities are surpassed only by his horrifying acting. His character seems like an alien being, teleported in from another world (This is only partially due to his vaguely teutonic accent, strange features, and the fact that he is about 30 years older than all the other actors). Despite this, the other characters treat him like one of the gang, and ""a really great guy"" to boot. I couldn't help thinking that he would have been better paired with the mother of his love interest in the movie. The dialog and storyline are nonsensical, character motivations are vague to nonexistent, and minor characters and subplots pop in and out at random. In regard to exposition, there is lots of telling and very little showing (""Johnny is a great guy"", ""Johnny is my best friend,"" etc."") While we are repeatedly told how great ""Johnny"" (Wiseau's character) is, he just seems creepy. There are some strange ""football games"" played at very close quarters, and one memorable scene in which ""Lisa"" is talking to another character.

He himself first heard of it a few months ago and has been trying to find a copy of it since then. He finally ordered a copy online and told me that I absolutely had to see it.

Well, I had completely forgotten about it. Then yesterday, it randomly popped into my mind and suddenly I felt compelled to look it up on Amazon and read some of the reviews. As I read, I felt somehow drawn to this movie. One of the reviews that I read, quoted the line, 'YOU'RE TEARING ME APART LISA!!' For some reason this line stuck in my mind.

After reading about 'The Room', I got ready for bed and turned on Adult Swim, as I often do. I quickly realized that it was not Aqua Teen that I was watching, but something entirely different. I picked up the remote to change the channel, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. I felt compelled to keep watching, so I did. I still didn't know what the hell I was watching until all of a sudden I heard, 'YOU'RE TEARING ME APART LISA!!!' At hearing this I got goosebumps.

A few moments later on the screen I saw an image of the dvd cover and next to it, it said, 'THE ROOM.. NOW AVAILABLE ON AMAZON.COM' I asked my friend if he knew it was going to be on Adult Swim, and maybe that's why he mentioned it to me, and he informed me that he had no idea it was going to be on tv and that he'd actually heard about it several months ago.

While watching the movie, I had a very strange feeling that I don't think I could even describe. The closest I can come is to say that I felt like I was in the movie myself, or like the movie was actually happening. That's not exactly it, but that's the best way I can explain it. Today I feel different. Almost as if something in me changed. There is a subtle feeling that I'm dreaming even though I'm awake or that reality isn't actually as real as it seems.

I wonder if anyone else has experienced anything strange like this in conjunction with this movie or if its just me. Is it possible that this is more than a movie? Or am I just losing my mind?

2465077,5,B000CFYAMC,"Let's assume that you've seen The Room.  Imagine that Lisa's eyebrows matched her hair.  Imagine that Johnny was about twenty years younger and a person that you actually wanted to see naked, with a decent haircut.  Imagine that the movie's budget allowed for more than three or four sets.  Imagine that characters didn't keep repeating the same meaningless lines over and over again--""Johnny is a good man.""  ""Johnny is my best friend.""  ""I don't want to talk about it.""  ""Well I have to go now.""  Imagine that instead of being a simple Jekyll/Hyde caricature, Lisa was actually a complicated and real-seeming person, torn between security/domesticity and freedom/passion.  Suppose that the revelation that her mother is dying of breast cancer actually contributed to her inner conflict.  Imagine that the minor characters were adequately introduced and actually came across as real people with their own problems/motivations instead of simply allowing the filmmaker to kill some time while he waits to advance his plot.  What would we have then?  A simple morality tale (actions have consequences!) that no one would ever want to buy on DVD.  Instead, we have The Room.

I first heard about The Room in the December 19, 2008 edition of Entertainment Weekly.  I immediately tried to put it in my Netflix queue, but it was unavailable, so I came here, to Amazon, and was delighted to find that I could own this intriguing piece of cinema for only 8.49, so I bought it.  I have watched it twice and have been trying to figure out what makes this movie so awful and yet so oddly entertaining ever since.  Now I must admit I am a huge fan of bad movies--I can debate which is worse, Plan 9 from Outer Space or Manos: The Hands of Fate with the best of 'em.  I have a tradition of watching Showgirls with the excellent commentary from David Schmader every Fourth of July, because it's so much better than fireworks, and you don't get caught in a traffic jam.  I think it is hard to pin down all the disparate elements that make The Room sublime.  Still, I agree with the EW article--it is the Citizen Kane of bad movies.

For those of you who haven't seen The Room, the plot goes something like this: Johnny is a guy who loves his live-in girlfriend, Lisa.  He brings her presents.  They have sex to horrible R&B-lite tunes.  Their creepy teenage neighbor, Denny, tries to watch them having sex, but luckily they kick him out before things get too hot and heavy.  Lisa seems to enjoy the sex, but it turns out Lisa is a big faker.  Lisa doesn't love Johnny, but she thinks his best friend Mark is pretty hot, and apparently, no one can resist Lisa.  To paraphrase what David Schmader said about Nomi in Showgirls, Lisa immediately pulls people into her orbit and makes them fall in love with her, because...well, we don't know why.  Lisa and Mark have sex.  Lisa and Johnny have sex again, just to make sure Lisa's duplicity is obvious enough.  Lisa's mom is dying of breast cancer.  Denny pisses off a drug dealer.  Lisa encourages Johnny to drink too much and then makes up a story about him getting drunk and hitting her.  A psychologist advises Johnny.  Lisa and Johnny make out on the sofa in their house, except now they are played by two entirely different actors.  Oh no, wait, these are different, unknown characters making out on their sofa.  There is a mildly amusing incident with Lisa's mother and the unknown young man on the sofa and his underwear.  We see the incident, and then it is repeated verbatim for us in the next scene.  Johnny, Mark, and Denny play football while wearing tuxedos--ha ha!  Lisa hosts a birthday party for Johnny and announces that she is pregnant, and then confesses to a friend that she's really not.  Lisa then hits on Mark during the party, even though they had agreed to end their affair.  Johnny finds out his beloved girlfriend is not really a human being, but is instead an evil robot.  Disaster ensues.  Actions have consequences!

I find that the movie makes more sense to me if I imagine that the character of Johnny is actually mentally challenged, but everyone is too polite to say this explicitly.  (Once you hear Tommy Wisseau's odd accent and the strange cadence and emphases to his speech and his dorky laughs, not to mention what he's actually saying, it's actually not much of a stretch at all!)  Johnny maybe has a rich, powerful uncle somewhere who has gotten him a handsomely-paid job fetching coffee at a bank.  He's mentally challenged enough that he doesn't realize he's going to be the coffee boy forever, and he thinks his money-saving ideas for the bank are going to get him promoted (""Hey, if we stop giving away free toasters with new checking accounts, we could save money!""  ""That's a great idea, Johnny.  Now go get me some more coffee.  And a bagel.  Cinnamon.  Light on the cream cheese.  That's a good man!  We should think about promoting you to bank president, eh, Johnny?  Heh heh!"")  Lisa is getting tired of having a mentally challenged boyfriend.  Even though he is good to her, he has started to disgust her.  And it's kind of understandable, really.  It also explains Johnny's melodramatic reactions to everything.

Anyway, that's the backstory I have invented for The Room, but you could easily invent your own, and that's the great thing about this movie.  The gaping holes in character and plot really encourage the viewer to use her own creativity.  Whether you're throwing plastic spoons at the screen or trying to make up plausible reasons for the nutty behavior, it's a lot of fun, so buy this movie right now!!",1232755200,544,5599,4.691675231243576

No one could be genius enough to do on purpose what Tommy Wiseau has created by accident.

2465082,5,B000CFYAMC,"This movie is absolutely the campiest of camp, and the best kind: accidental.  Tommy Wiseau clearly has no idea that his ridiculous dialog, acting, editing, camera work.... etc, was so bad when he made it.  But thank God.  Because his naive ability to produce this- on a very large budget by the way- has created a work of countless quotes such as ""Oh Hai, Denny!"", ""You're tearing me apart, Lisa!"",  ""Well, the results came back - I definitely have breast cancer."" to name a few.  Even in his interview on the DVD, you can tell he is totally clueless- but in a glorious and amazingly entertaining way.

Regardless of what you think, this movie has become a cult phenomenon with a huge following and monthly screenings in LA.  It's gold for anyone who can enjoy a bad movie or campy movies. It's best watched with a group of people to really get the most from it... because at the end of the day, Tommy Wiseau just brings people together.

That being said, this movie is one of the best cult films ever.  One that you should buy and watch with friends.  This movie is fun and quotable.  You can laugh and make comments and not miss anything.  It's a movie that I feel everyone should see.  Don't go in expecting something amazing cinematically.

After showing this at a party to a few friends, a round of applause followed the ending. This film is hilarious, and for all the wrong reasons!

After seeing an old trailer for this film, I remember seeing the terrible acting and bizarre mixed European accent of Mr. Wiseau, with him screaming ""YOU ARE TEARING ME APART LIIIIZA"". Having been shown this, this film was on my 'to get' list. Pure genius!

I don't know why, however, the trailer was changed. I also don't remember it being marketed as a 'black comedy' on this trailer I saw. But still, this film has the potential to be a cult classic over here in the UK, as everyone I've shown it too has laughed their arses off. Memorable quotes include, ""We are expecting, AH HAH!"", ""Hi, doggy!"" and the conversation that shows Tommy talking to his 'best friend' about clients at work, then the conversation switching suddenly with Tommy asking him, ""Anyway, how's your sex life?""

But the weird thing is I reccomend it if you like train wrecks. I've never laughed so hard in my life. The actors have no imagination whatsoever and the writer/director seems to be basing this movie on other movies instead of life itself.

2465091,1,B000CFYAMC,"Tommy Wiseau's THE ROOM may cure cancer and depression, but it also hurts your eyes and brain.  Make sure you only watch it while wearing special glasses.

Okay, all kidding aside, this is one awful movie.  On the positive side, it does manage to work as a reaffirmation of The American Dream.  If a mutant like Mr. Wiseau can independantly realize his cinematic vision, then maybe we can too.

As for the film itself, I almost don't know what to say.  This movie is terrible by pretty much any masochistic standard.  Mr. Wiseau is like a creepy Brundlefly fusion of Sylvester Stallone, Fabio and Uwe Boll, but he seems to think that he's a completely normal, average, all-American guy.  Even worse, he seems to think he's sexy.  This leads to a seemingly endless succession of spirit-crushingly long, soft core sex scenes which allow us to study his body at length.  How can one man be so toned and yet so decrepit?

There are laughs to be had, but they certainly weren't intended.  THE ROOM is labelled as ""a black comedy,"" but I assure you that Tommy Wiseau didn't know it was funny until he was watching it with a packed theater roaring with laughter at every nuance.

The plot?  There isn't one.  There is only Mr. Wiseau's persecuted narcissism.  Lisa, the femme du jour of the piece certainly seems self-centered for no good reason, but I'd say that her sheer unmotivated evil says more about Wiseau's view of women than it does the reality of bad relationships.

Is there entertainment value in THE ROOM?  Um, I guess.  I've only watched it alone and it required some alcohol consumption to see it through til the end.  I understand that group viewings have become kind of an event, so if you're into a certain level of bad movie worship, we may have your holy grail here.  There are certainly laughs to be had at the expense of this thing and its alien of an auteur, but getting through it is a chore.

On the other hand, maybe it's the ultimate date movie.  After sitting through the shrill, hideous cavortings and bickerings of the central couple in this movie, you and your significant other will be able to look at each other with new eyes and hold one another tight after glimpsing into the vision of Hell that this movie shows you.

Either that or share a hearty laugh knowing that the two of you could probably document your own relationship with a video camera and come up with a better movie than THE ROOM.
