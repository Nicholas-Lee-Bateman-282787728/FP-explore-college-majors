  back a big part of my soul. Just to hear these guys talk years later about all they did on the mat is great. What a great
  sport and excellent to watch.

  ALSO  a special thaks to jeff blatnick who lifted a lot of people up from his home town area before he passed away.

  we all miss you.",1387497600,,413,3.962962962962963
8256310,3,B0014TC2W0,"Only 43 minutes of ""new material"", but if you have any Tapes of Smith, Gable, or Sanderson, you have hear much of what they have to say already. Maybe I am biased because I own many wrestling DVDS, but if you look, you can get better motivational material either cheaper or more in depth. The extras I have already seen and if I remember right, for free.",1215388800,2,354,4.298507462686567
