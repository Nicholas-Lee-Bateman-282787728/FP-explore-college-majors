6124118,4,B00GY4N13Y,"This is a Polish film of gay love and in some respects has similarities to the recently released German film `Freefall'<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Free-Fall/dp/B00I8H6XT4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Free Fall</a>. It is essentially the story of Kuba (Mateusz Banasiuk) he lives at home with his mum and girlfriend of two years - Sylwia. He is a talented swimmer and trains every day. He seems to be a bit care-free and, some might say, even immature in his outlook. Then one night at an art gallery, which Sylwia has dragged him to, he meets the broodingly good looking Michal (Bartosz Gelner).

They sort of hit it off and all of a sudden they are falling for each other. However, things are never simple and events conspire against the two men, what follows involves family loyalties, coming out and rampant homophobia. To say any more could impinge on the plot.

This film does contain a fair bit of nudity and scenes of a very sexual nature but it is all pretty tasteful/realistic - this is not art house though and does not shy away from a `rutting scene'. It is extremely well shot with great use of the locations and lighting, the underwater sequences are all excellent. This is a high values production and it reaps the rewards for that. The acting is top notch and the sub titles are all very good too - with a run time of 89 minutes this is a film that left me wanting more and was an experience that moved me - absolutely recommended.",1416614400,4,1486,4.846456692913386

6124120,3,B00GY4N13Y,"It seems to be a rule of inverse proportion where the more attractive and naked the actors are on the cover of a film the lower the quality of the production on the disc inside. This film is no exception. I watched this for no other reason than it is a Polish production and a gay Polish anything is as rare as a hens dancing shoes. I watch any gay film regardless of its origin and particularly enjoy European productions as they are a welcome balance to Hollywood scripts.
It is fairly run of the mill. The plot isn't the most difficult to follow and there is a very limited cast of 6  with one or two scene fillers. As the main protagonist is at College training for some champion swimming event which is never mentioned, we see a lot of him in his swimming gear. We see him naked, semi-naked or topless for about 80 per cent of the film. There are few scenes where he has any clothes on at all. This of course serves the interest of the director where the poor script cant carry the film so at least the viewers will have something to look at during the rather long pauses of car parks, roads and balconies. And in itself it isn't a bad view but adds nothing to the plot. I doubt whether Tom Daley smoked like a soldier and drank and took drugs while in training for his diving events but this doesnt seem to be an issue for this swimmer.

The girlfriend is played well. She lives with him at his mothers house. Initially they don't get on and she wants her out but they join in an unholy alliance when Kuba starts to get too cosy with his new friend. Without spoiling the ending they come up with the ultimate solution to their problem to keep him at home and straight.

The actors deliver their scenes well and with conviction I don't think there is any denying that. Its just that I wonder who this film is aimed at. Possibly not a wider European audience but just a Polish one. One thing did strike me though. The Polish are notoriously conservative and right wing and Catholic teaching is hard to erase even unconsciously. In this film it is clear from the outset that good things cannot happen to bad people and without wanting to spoil the ending this thinking is brought to the fore. Gay men are not to have happy endings and they deserve what they get. If you like closed endings in films then this is not for you as you are left wondering what eventually happens to the characters after the camera is turned off. I thought that there might be some deleted scenes that might throw some light on it but there aren't any. Nor any extras either. At least in Sasha the deleted scenes filled in some gaps.

If you watch the recent German film Free Fall the same ideas are contained there too  married man who discovers that he has intense feelings for another man but is in a relationship with a woman and cant get out of it. Free Fall is possibly done a bit better and with a lot more flare. Still open ended though.

I suspect that more and more Polish men are getting the courage to come out but are of the age where they are in relationships with women or are married. This film would appeal to men in that bracket but doesnt really have anything to say to the gay in the street that had none of these issues. It can be quite depressing actually which is reflected in the location shots. At least youll be better informed on Polish car-parks and roads at the end of it as well as a swimmers build.",1413417600,22,3409,4.2775193798449616

The  photography and directing  were also  truly memorable,They don't make gay films like this in the USA..My only complaint was that  a couple of times the camera  was  in a car that is being driven in an underground car park  and  repetitive  grating music is heard in the background.

I am so tired of the tragedy, sadness, and overall disappointing endings of these gay romance movies! i so wish i could get that 80 something minutes back that i spent watching this. The beginning was slow till finally! michael was introduced and even while his and khuba relationship progressed slowly but surely, the way it was filmed it was hard to tell if they really did have something going on or were all the longing looks just unreleased sexual tension between the two. finally when you do see some scenes between michael and khuba that lets you know "" yes they have something going definitely"" it ends way too quick. SPOILER ALERT: michael ends up dead after a homophobic attack and khuba ends up being unhappily stuck in a loveless relationship with his knocked up girlfriend as a sadly successful attempt of his mother to keep him home and away from khuba. with a movie that had so much potential to be one of the few happy romance movies, it saddens and frankly piss me off to see it ends like all the other gay romance movies.",1403308800,2,1251,4.539823008849558

6124124,5,B00GY4N13Y,"Not that the eye candy doesn't help, but this is a wonderful film. Considering the gay-bashing and bullying that the Russian government seems now committed to, the real world nature of the tragic outcome is sadly predictable. But there is so much magic in the film making, as referenced in the ""Floating Skyscrapers"" of the title, that I will watch this again. Interesting aside: each scene enfolds chronoligically, but you always seem to be figuring out what transpired between scenes to motivate the current  a very Eastern European style of narrative, I think.",1396656000,,563,5.053763440860215

6124126,3,B00GY4N13Y,Another dark unhappy ending by Eastern Europeans. So much there thats agreeable but that is off-set by brutishness - it happens but within the framework of a film it shows up a sort of fatalism that goes no where.,1481760000,,213,4.487179487179487
6124127,1,B00GY4N13Y,"Sadly enough, this is becoming more and more, a central gay theme, where one of the main characters dies at the end.  I am sick of it.  Movie producers cannot come up with a more creative ending.  I say this in every review; you spend the entire movie, building your characters, intertwining them in the story and plot, building their character, the way they act, feel, and think, only to kill them off in the end.  I don't understand this motivation to kill and die at the end.  So many movies are like this.  So many.  It makes me want to vomit.  No creativity.  And this is entertainment?  Aside from my piercing score of 1 star, the movie had so much potential.  You got to feel the 2 characters bonding, and falling deeper for each other, as the movie progressed.  You got to feel the rejection from friends and family.  But as always;  always, always, always, the very last scene of the movie, out of nowhere, one of the main characters dies a senseless, and from people that were not even in the movie up to that point.  What?  Am I missing something?  What a let down.  Totally unnecessary.  They could have ended this potentially good movie in a more creative way, and I would have given this a much higher rating.

This is really a heterosexual film. The protagonist doesn't have the courage to be gay so he sticks with girlfriend and physically gay bashes his lover bloody and unconscious in front of others to prove his manhood.

Does this sound like there is any gay romance? Of course not. No director has the balls to actually show there are happy, well-adjusted gay couples in this world. It's not a ""masterpiece"" without an unhappy ending to please the breeders. Without naked women and ugly gay bad endings for gays the breeders wouldn't spend their money watching this so the director can't make films that6 are happily ever afterthat wouldn't be arty and it would be too gay.

6124148,5,B00GY4N13Y,"Floating Skyscrapers is a 2013 Polish drama. It is a fabulous film. A beautiful, yet sad story and a hard reality of relationships and the love affair between two men. This is flawlessly directed and created. A beautiful set up of the story and the heart touching heartstrings of wanting to be with the one you love, yet knowing that it would cause problems. Your main character Kuba is a professional swimmer and he just happens to fall in love with another man. His mother and his girlfriend are in shock. The mother has no approval of her son. His girlfriend tries so hard to hold on to what she has with him as he clings to his desire and leads both down his path.

This is a passionate in my viewpoint masterpiece of cinema on the idea of relationships. On the idea of following who you love and on the idea of coming to terms with who you are and the ultimate understanding about true love, but because of your surroundings you have to hide.

Now interesting to note is this film is actually kind of a landmark. It is one of the first Polish productions to ever make the main topic and the main storyline and reality of same-sex relationships. I find that to be something that brings the film all the more clarity and ultimate understanding of this film. I find this movie to be beautiful, to be a hard subject, to be desirable, to be very drama induced. It sends the viewer into the reality of a relationship and because of that relationship everything else around them becomes drama. A wonderful acted performance by Mateusz Banasiuk as Kuba. He does a fantastic job and creates the character in such a believable fashion that the viewer can ultimately relate to him and ultimately become a part of his struggle and his desire and his love, that is the passion and the power of his character. He builds so gracefully on the screen everything about this character. The next shining star would go to Bartosz Gelner who plays Michal the one Kuba becomes attracted to and ultimately in love with. Gelner is another fantastic actor that holds his character and gives his character a beating heart and a passionate example of just how to act as an award worthy performer on screen. The chemistry between the two of them shines flawlessly, magically and passionately. Each one gives the viewer an emotional and personal experience that the viewer can relate to. Flawlessly performed. Flawlessly created. Flawlessly an example of perfection.
