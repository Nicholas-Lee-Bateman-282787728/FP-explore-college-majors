8562033,5,B00B361GL2,"On the 9th day of Chirstmas 2014 I'm going to review...WWE Wrestlemania 10. The Bret Hart-Owen Hart match was 20 minutes of AWESOME. The Doink the Clown & Dink the Clown-Bam Bam Bigelow & Luna Vachon mixed tag match was Decent comedy match to say the least. The Falls Count Anywhere match between Macho Man Randy Savage & Crush while not bad,The silly rules hurt this match but it was an innovative way Savage used them to his advantage. The Women's title match between Alundra Blayze & Leilani Kai was not a very good match; Leilani was years past her prime and Alundra got about five moves in. The World Tag Team title match between The Quebecers & Men on a Mission was a good match in the beginning including Quebecers double teams until it all fell apart in the end. The World title math between Yokozuna & Lex Luger was too long and too boring. The Earthquake-Adam Bomb match was short stink-fest. The Ladder match for the Intercontinental Championship between Razor Ramon & Shawn Michaels was incredibly innovative for the day; no one had ever seen a match like this. The people in MSG were speechless once it was over. The World title match between Yokozuna & Bret Hart was a decent main event match with a slow pace but that remains consistent with both guys selling the exhaustion of wrestling earlier in the night; so it works. I give this PPV a 9 out of 10.",1419206400,,1368,4.520161290322581
8562034,5,B00B361GL2,"The New Generation Era didn't exactly offer a lot of the best Wrestlemanias but in 1994, WWF offered one of the best Wrestlemanias to date in Wrestlemania 10. Here's my review of 1994's Wrestlemania X

1.) Grudge Match: Owen Hart vs Bret Hart

After turning on Bret, months prior at the Royal Rumble PPV, jealous and bitter Owen and Bret would both butt heads on the biggest stage of them all. This was nothing short of a fantastic opener for the show. With Bret and Owen both being brothers and both having the same training background, this match was technical grappling at it's finest. The crowd absolutely ate this match up and loved every bit of it! The match went back and forth all the way throughout and never showed any signs or being boring. Owen gets the win with a unique pin reversal. This was a great match and a great way to give Owen some heel heat going into his heel run. Plus with Bret fighting in the main event later in the night, there really wasn't much of a reason for him to win anyway

2.) Bam Bam Bigelow and Luna Vachon vs Doink and Dink

Nothing more than a comedy match. Skip it to save time. Bam Bam hits a diving headbutt on Doink for the win. Post-match scuffle between the 4

3.) Macho Man Randy Savage vs Crush w/Mr. Fuji

The match was No DQ and started on the outside of the ring and saw Crush get a quick pinfall over Macho Man. The rules of this match were kind of odd, stating that whenever someone was pinned (assuming they were pinned outside of the ring), they had 60 seconds to make it back inside of the ring, or they would lose the match. This was a unique match but too odd to explain how it works. Basically the match ends up going backstage where Savage gets a pinfall on Crush, ties some sort of pulley around his legs to prevent him from getting back to the ring within 60 seconds, thus giving Savage the win.

4.) Women's Championship Match: Alundra Blayze (c) vs Leilani Kei

Nothing special about this match. It's relatively short and ends with Alundra Blayze retaining with a german suplex pin

5.) Tag Team Championship Match: Men on a Mission (Mabel and Mo w/Oscar) vs The Quebecers (Jacques Rogueau and Pierre)

While I didn't grow up in the New Generation Era but rather the Attitude Era, the New Generation Era is my second favorite era and Men on a Mission is one of my favorite Tag Teams to come from that era. They were largely popular with crowds while The Quebecers were largely hated by crowds so it was a good match to see a solid loved Tag Team fight a solidly hated Tag Team. Jacques and Pierre dominated most of the match and were quite impressive with some of their double team moves. Men on a Mission win the match via countout but because titles can't change hands though a countout, The Quebecers retained the titles.

6.) WWF Championship Match: Lex Luger vs Yokozuna (c) w/Mr. Fuji and Jim Cornette

After Bret Hart and Lex Luger both won the 1994 Royal Rumble, it was decided that they'd both get a title shot at Wrestlemania. To determine who would face Yokozuna first, a coin-toss was made, which Luger won. Thus Luger would face Yokozuna first and the winner would put the title on the line against Bret, later in the night. Before the match began, Mr. Perfect returned and was revealed as the special referee. This was pretty much a rematch to the 1993 SummerSlam WWF Championship match where Lex Luger beat Yokozuna via countout and didn't win the championship. With this being a battle of the giant brawlers, this match tended to move slow at times but managed to pick up around the middle. Right as Luger had the match won, Cornette and Fuji interfered. Instead of Perfect counting the pin for Luger, he put his attention on Fuji and Cornette. Luger shoved Perfect out of frustration and Perfect DQ'd Luger and Yokozuna retained the title. I guess the WWF never saw Lex Luger as WWF Championship material because this seemed like a perfect time for him to get a-hold of the title. Backstage, Luger and Perfect got into a verbal confrontation. The aftermath of this match was supposed to lead to a Luger vs Perfect feud but never happened due to back problems Perfect was having at the time.

7.) Adam Bomb vs Earthquake

Nothing but a squash match that begins after some problems with Howard Finkel and Harvey Wippleman. The match lasts less than a minute and ends with Earthquake hitting his finisher on Adam Bomb for the win

8.) Intercontinental Championship Ladder Match: Razor Ramon (c) vs Shawn Michaels (c)

What can I other than this match is absolutely classic from two of my favorite wrestlers! Two of the WWF's best technical, grappling athletes of the 90s going to war for bragging rights of IC Champion in this breath-taking Ladder Match! This match is nothing short of exhilarating with tons of high flying moves and modern grappling. Very back and forth with each man looking to have a great chance of winning the match. Razor Ramon ends up climbing the ladder to retrieve both belts and be claimed the true Intercontinental Champion. They'd have a rematch the following year in the same match for the same title at the 1995 SummerSlam. Some say that the SummerSlam match was better than their Wrestlemania one. I can't say which one was better but they both deliver! Check out both matches and you be the judge on which one was the best. But this is easily in my top 15 if not my top 10 Wrestlemania matches

9.) WWF Championship Match: Bret Hart vs Yokozuna (c) w/Mr. Fuji and Jim Cornette

Burt Reynolds served as guest ring announcer and then Rowdy Roddy Piper made his return and served as the special guest referee for the match. Similar to how the Luger vs Yokozuna match earlier in the night was a rematch from the previous year's SummerSlam, this match was a rematch from the previous year's Wrestlemania IX where Bret Hart lost the WWF Championship to Yokozuna. This was Bret's chance at redemption. They played up Bret having a hurt leg from his match with Owen earlier to make the match a bit more unbelievable. Yoko controlled majority of the match and how Bret won was a little eye rolling but at the same time they had to make him win in a believable way. A decent main event that saw Bret Hart get revenge for his loss the previous year and for the Bret Hart era to continue.

After the match, the celebrities who made guest appearances, all the babyfaces from the locker room came out and lifted Bret into the air and celebrated with him as a bitter and jealous Owen Hart peered from the shadows

Overall: This was without a doubt one of the best Wrestlemanias in its history. Excluding 1 or 2 matches, every match delivered with its performance and did not disappoint. This Wrestlemania set the chapter for Shawn Michaels vs Razor Ramon II at 1996's SummerSlam and Bret Hart vs Owen Hart II at that year's SummerSlam. Wrestlemania X easily makes my Top 10",1394668800,3,7400,4.766823161189358
8562035,4,B00B361GL2,"A couple of notes here in that this is the exact same version of this event taken from the WrestleMania Anthology set meaning that all references to ""WWF"" & various music has been changed to due the rights expiring but there is no blurring of the WWF logo since this event happened before the ""Attitude Era.""

""Ten Years In The Making"" marked the 10th edition (not anniversary like they promoted it) of WrestleMania returning home to Madison Square Garden & was the beginning of a new era because many of the past long term names attached with not just WrestleMania but WWE as a company were either retired from in-ring competition or gone completely including Hulk Hogan, Gene Okerland, Ted Dibiase, Bobby Heenan, ect. making room for a ""New Generation"" of atheltes to take the spotlight.  Celebrities include Jenny Garth, Donnie Walberg, Rhonda Sheer, Burt Reynolds, ""President Clinton,"" President Of The Hair Club For Men Sy Sperling who debuted the ""new"" Howard Finkel, and Little Richard performing ""America The Beautiful.""  This event also featured the WrestleMania debuts of various superstars & legends like Jerry Lawler, Alundra Blayze/Madusa, Johnny Polo/Raven, Jim Cornette, and Kevin ""Diesel"" Nash.

Due to the controversial ending to the Royal Rumble earlier in the year, the WWE Championship was scheduled to be defended twice in one night with the first championship match being Lex Luger's long-awaited SummerSlam rematch against WWE Champion Yokozuna with Mr. Perfect as the special guest referee in a back & forth contest with the winner going on to face Bret Hart later in the night with Roddy Piper as the referee that had Piper taking matters into his own hands at times the only way ""Rod Rod"" knows how that ended in a celebration with most of the roster congratulating the new WWE Champion (and for those complaining about spoilers, just look at the DVD cover).  The match that ""stole the show"" at this event was the first ever PPV Ladder Match with Razor Ramon vs. Shawn Michaels for the Intercontinental Championship with both men's title belts hanging from the top in what was definitely groundbreaking for it's time as nobody has ever seen a match like that before to the point where people point to this match as the beginning of earning the nickname ""Mr. WrestleMania.""  The other memorable match from this event was the opening match were the two Hart brothers in Bret & Owen had a very technical wrestling match with emotion & storytelling that was definitely the career making moment for Owen Hart as ""he didn't just step out, he jumped out of the shadow.""  The most out of control match on the card was the Falls Count Anywhere Match with Randy Savage vs. Crush that went from the isleway to ringside back to the backstage area in what would turn out to be the final WrestleMania appearance of ""The Macho Man.""  Other matches include Doink & Dink vs. Bam Bam Bigelow & Luna Vachon a mixed tag match, Alundra Blayze defending the Womens Championship vs. Leilani Kai, Tag Team Champions Quebeckers vs. Men On A Mission, and Earthquake vs. Adam Bomb.

This was about as perfect of a WrestleMania as you were going to get as he had solid matches from technical wrestling to brawling, entertainment, and various memorable moments that still standout today so this is a WrestleMania that you should definitely go out of your way to see.",1364688000,3,3363,4.865384615384615
