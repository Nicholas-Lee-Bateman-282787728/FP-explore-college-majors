1909332,5,B0000AVHD2,Cold fusion is a great DVD. This movie features great skiing and snowboarding segments as well as some cool base jumping scenes. The soundtrack was good and you can't beat Warrens voice.,1329868800,,186,4.84375
1909333,5,B0000AVHD2,"""Cold Fusion: Fire From Water"", is the most comprehensive video on Cold Fusion that I have seen.

Cold Fusion is unquestionably the single most important scientific discovery in all of human history. The fact that it is being suppressed shows that there truly is an agenda to maintain the system that is currently set in place (and the reason is because of money, power, and control).

This movie doesn't attempt to present an explanation of WHY Cold Fusion is being suppressed, but simply documents the plain and simple facts. I don't know of another source where you can find a more comprehensive compilation of the scientific work that has been done in this field.

Definitely a must-buy.",1231718400,,691,4.888888888888889

1909336,4,B0000AVHD2,"This DVD/film may have been the last creative output by James Doohan, who is famous as Scotty on the original Star Trek. It came out in 2005, and Doohan died shortly after. In it, he appears significantly older than in the Star Trek episodes, despite the heroic efforts of makeup. Still, those were almost 40 years ago. His narrative holds up well. No indication that he was at death's door.

The other attraction of this film is of course Arthur Clarke. Who is really showing his age. But he impressively keeps chugging along. You have to admire his fortitude and longevity in the film.

What about the actual scientific merits of cold fusion? The case made here is speculative but reasonable. Sure, a bit unlikely. But you are not listening to some New Age drivel. No woo woo hocus pocus. Both men make rational cases for the possibility. Citing hitherto unexplained experimental results. Where there are tantalising suggestions of an energy surplus or of trace isotopes resulting from fusion.",1180396800,,995,4.881656804733728

I would have rated the video 5 stars if I could have watched the video along with the audio.  I tried it on two different VHS VCRs with the same results.  On slow play the video portion came in excellent but with no sound.  Same thing on fast forward.  Regular play had the audio coming in great but with the picture ghosting into two images of everything.

1909347,4,B0000AVHD2,"This is a 1998 documentary narrated by Star Trek's James Doohan. It traces the history of so-called 'cold fusion' the fusing of two atomic isotopes at temperatures lower than that of the sun, where nuclear fusion normally takes place.

The documentary starts with the controversial claim of a famous 1989 experiment that produced 'excess heat' (more energy out than in) by chemists Fleischmann and Pons. The 'cold fusion' moniker was applied to the experiment by others. The documentary then traces many of the follow up excess heat experiments up to around 1998.

This program is worth watching because many of the actual people who produced these experiments -and the scientists who held their feet to the fire- are interviewed. We hear their story first hand with no second hand summaries or interpretation.

I became convinced that some of the experiments did indeed produce more energy than was consumed. Excess heat, if not actual fusion. The shortfall of not proving cold fusion actually opens the door to a possible source of energy that has not yet been realized. That is quite fascinating. If you're into Tesla or 'zero point energy' this may make more sense.

In any case, it is now 2016, and where are the commercial excess heat devices? I googled this question and apparently there aren't many. Not sure why. Lack of uniformly reproducible results was one reason mentioned. Another may be that vested interests in the current energy structure is another. ""Free"" energy machines can likely not be owned in the same way oil and mineral rights can be.

There is another documentary on Amazon Prime that compliments this one nicely. It goes into zero point energy and obtaining free energy from good old tap water: 'It Runs on Water' (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TJQF0C/ref=dv_web_wtls_list_pr_1_ba/ref=dv_web_wtls_list_pr_1_ba?ie=UTF8&redirect=true)",1453420800,2,1868,5.361774744027303

1909370,3,B0000AVHD2,"Cold Fusion: Fire from Water is a rather dragging documentary about cold fusion, from the perspective of those who believe in the reality of this controversial phenomenon. (Main-stream science rejects the existence of cold fusion.) While the program claims to be scientific, it very explicitly appeals to science fiction, perhaps revealing its intended target audience? The documentary starts off with a quote from Jules Verne, the narrator James Doohan is explicitly introduced as Star Trek's Scotty, and Arthur C Clarke is both quoted and interviewed.

As I said, I found Fire from Water to be both boring and dragging, but a few interesting things are revealed. One tenured professor who did research on the subject was persecuted by his peers in a Kafkaesque manner. It's also interesting to note that while the U.S. government (officially, at least) doesn't fund cold fusion research, many multinational corporations do. While this doesn't prove the phenomenon is real, it certainly means somebody somewhere hopes it might be, and is intrigued by some of the experimental results.

If true, cold fusion would be *the* major scientific breakthrough ever. It would also be comparatively cheap and easy. At present, governments are pouring ludicrous amounts of resources into attempts to build a hot fusion reactor, attempts that have hitherto completely failed. Apparently, main-line scientists claim that CERN can save the world by 2020 if the European Union just coughs up a trillion dollars or so, one last time. Now, *that's* hard to believe! Especially in a period of rapidly dwindling energy resources (and government budgets), cold fusion research is probably bound to continue (for good or for worse), no matter how much official science scorns the idea.

Fire from Water takes a cornucopian angle on the problem, promising that we can avoid a new Dark Age, keep our present standard of living and yet avoid pollution, if only cold fusion gets the research grants it needs. Star Trek's Scotty and the interviewees even suggest that cold fusion could be used to transmute base metals into more useful ones, a process similar to, ahem, alchemy. Call me a pessimist, but this sounds too good to be true. Indeed, even if cold fusion energy turns out to be real and can be tapped by humanity, what makes its proponents believe that it will end environmental destruction? The more energy we have, the more havoc we can create! Cold fusion believers seem to think that their form of neo-energy is somehow intrinsically morally good, just because it would be cheap and abundant. I don't think that necessarily follows at all

Even if cold fusion eventually just turns out to be a highly exotic but normal form of chemical reaction, it might be interesting in its own right. However, I think it's painfully obvious that this line of alternative research is ultimately driven by cornucopian dreams and the myth of progress. Ironically, the same dreams fuel the fusion reactors. I strongly suspect that both main-stream and fringe fusion research will ultimately prove to be dead ends, and that we would be better off giving all that inflated money to save the bees or grow organic bean-stalks! We might all need a cold turkey rather than cold fusion",1400976000,,3250,5.057835820895522

What happens when experiments that cost mere millions upset the apple cart of funding that dumps 40 billion dollars (at the time) in to the hot-fusion coffers.  Too-big-to-fail science had the lobbying power to slow down but not stop real progress.

Of course this many not have been the main goal the creators of this film intended, but I love their work for this reason too.
