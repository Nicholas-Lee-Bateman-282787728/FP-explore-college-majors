8023218,1,B00027NW4C,The DVD doesn't work in USA DVD players. They delivered it to USA so they knew the format was for EU only.,1499040000,,106,3.8636363636363638
8023219,5,B00027NW4C,"This is an excellent production for its time frame, and gives the only actual footage available of the HMS Hood wreck and some additional footage of the Bismark ( better footage of Bismark is now available ).  That said, for me being an ex Navy man, the bringing together of the only living survivor of the Hood to see his ship / home again and say goodbye to his mates in person is INCREDIBLE.  I was a sailor on the Ranger in the '70s and VAQ 135 @ Whidbey Island.  The EA6B prowlers are now long gone and Ranger was cut up for scrap, but I'd pay handsomely to dive on a wrecked Foresstal class carrier - that's a fine bucket list item for any Navy man.  Highly recommended for history and military buffs.",1486425600,,707,4.253731343283582
8023220,3,B00027NW4C,Better if it were not for non-eventful underwater shots and bad language.,1464739200,,73,5.166666666666667
8023221,5,B00027NW4C,This documentary is the most detailed film on the HMS Hood and SMS Bismarck that I have ever seen!! The many lesser known bits of information that made the 'big picture' in this film is very readily available in America!! This one purchase has made me completely satisfied than I had ever expected!! I hope you can sell more documentaries of this caliber available with AMAZON!! Thank you for listing this DVD with AMAZON!!!,1461542400,,424,4.743243243243243
8023222,5,B00027NW4C,This was a Christmas gift - the person I ordered it has wanted it for a long time.  He loves this!  Would recommend it.,1388707200,,119,3.9166666666666665
8023223,5,B00027NW4C,"I really enjoyed this film.  It contained many photos of the two ships that I had never seen.  This film is definitely for a person already well versed in WW II history but, I think that most people would find it interesting at some level of understanding.  It might spur interest in WW II that wasn't there before.",1263686400,3,315,4.396551724137931
8023224,1,B00027NW4C,"I've waited for this documentary to come out on DVD since it premiered on my local PBS affiliate in 2001 or 2002.  The Amazon page for it indicates that it is a DVD.  Well, I found out the hard way that it's actually a DVD-R disc, not a DVD.  Older DVD players (mine is from March 1998) will not play it (console and screen display show ""insert disc"").  So I recommend to customers to not purchase it unless your equipment supports that format.  Odd thing; before buying this from Amazon, I quickly surveyed the ""Shop PBS"" links and could only find the VHS version of this documentary.  That didn't make me feel secure buying this product.

Having said all of the above, if your home entertainment equipment does support the DVD-R format, I do highly recommend it.  The visual quality was between 4 to 5.  It's not widescreen as it was broadcasted on the PBS HD Channel (if supported by your local PBS affiliate) but considering the historical significance of what happened to the HMS Hood and to the Schlachtschiff Bismarck in May 1941, I cannot recommend it enough.  It is a visually gripping documentary of those sad events that led to the great loss of life and two magnificent warships.

I normally return any DVD-R or ""burned"", as opposed to ""pressed,"" products.  I didn't return this one.  I was fortunate to interest friends to watch it on their newer DVD player.",1169078400,17,1371,4.615702479338843
8023225,3,B00027NW4C,"Errors include : picture of Repulse (or Renown) used for Hood. Picture of Prinz Eugen used for Bismarck. Granted similar silhouettes in both cases but still glaring. Bismarck said to have been torpedoed by Rodney. In fact, only a remote probable and most historians actually discounted it. Use of coincidence rangefinders touched on but omitted to say the Germans used stereoscopic rangefinders. Remarked usually took a hundred shells to score one hit but the figure is closer to 6 salvoes (24 shells) to produce hit/hits on average.

That said, the programme does provide rare footage and illustrations of the 2 vessels that we battleship fans have known and loved so intimately. And the human angle used, i.e interviews of survivors of Hood and Bismarck and the reunion of veterans from both sides was, fascinating, sobering and moving.",1111708800,3,838,5.116788321167883
