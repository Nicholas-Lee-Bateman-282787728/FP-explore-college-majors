Very poor and obvious quality control, you can see it by eyeballing the disc. I would complain but really don't want a replacement example of this crap disc manufacture.",1509062400,,337,4.633333333333334

A lone rider, Tom Crenshaw, is on the road to Santa Fe. He sees an ambush and tries to stop it. The victim gives him a small wallet to deliver to Molly. The bushwhacker had a written note on him. In town some men play a practical joke on two men. Tom meets One-shot Morgan and offers a shooting match. This is a trick! Tom outsmarts One-shot. The Circle J ranch needs hands. Who is trying to put the Circle J out of business? Molly Bates is the daughter of the owner, who arranged a bank loan to save his ranch. [But he was ambushed and shot.] Tom is the new foreman of this spread. The Sheriff is there to arrest Tom on suspicion of murder. Bates wallet was found under his mattress in the bunkhouse! Now its empty. [This tells you who the bad guy is.] But Tom disarms the Sheriff but fails to escape! The cook Bridget says Tom is a good man. The Sheriff is advised to take Tom to the county seat tonight.

A mob invades the jail. Four men ride up to take Tom away. They take him to Stanton, the gang leader, who will protect him (a case of mistaken identity because of that note taken from the killer of Dad Bates). A man robs Stanton of the $5,000 he took of Dad Bates money. He talked like a Mexican. Tom delivers the cash to Molly. The next day Tom visits Molly and tells her Stanton is behind her troubles, but he needs to find the man who initial is D. Stanton arrives to offer help to Molly, and asks her to marry him. Molly wants time to think it over. Stanton has a visitor, Denton, who hired Tex French and exposes Tom Crenshaw as an imposter. Tom escapes, the gang pursues him but he eludes them. Tom tells Molly about this. They need to get the good citizens to form a Vigilante Committee as Stanton controls the town.

Stantons gang arrives, can they hide Tom? The gang rides away. Stanton sends a man back to watch the Bates place. Bridget catches this man and drives him away! He tells Stanton where Tom is, so they ride back. Bridget fires a shotgun to drive them away! Tom rides away so Molly is free to go to town. Can Tom escape by jumping over a gap in a mountain? [Was this trick photography?] Tom and Molly visit Tibbett to bring about a showdown. They use the telephone to contact the good men in town. Stanton is warned about Crenshaw, Tibbett and the others. They arrive and shooting begins. Tom enters the house for a fistfight with Stanton and Denton. They will be turned over to the law. Will Tom stop drifting and settle down? When he finds what he wants.

This has a complicated story that makes an interesting movie. It seems like scenes were edited to reduce the running time to an hour. The story remains interesting until the end (but you know the good guys will win at the end). Toms activities remain strenuous.",1506297600,,2775,4.269961977186312
