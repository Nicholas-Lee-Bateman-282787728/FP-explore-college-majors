7985994,4,B00008O2Z3,"A friend and I like to watch bad films, and he found out about this little gem.  It has three times the action and none of the logic of other action films.  The hero looks a lot like Brian May from Queen.  My favorite part of the film is when the Stabilizer's arch-nemesis, Greg Rainmaker, is in his (The Stabilizer's) fiance's apartment, and on the wall she has a picture of the Stabilizer.  Okay, so there's nothing unusual about having a picture of your boyfriend or fiance on your wall, but in this picture he is wearing sunglasses, a mesh shirt, and HOLDING A GUN.  Later in the film, Rainmaker is in his lair, and he fires a gun at THE SAME PICTURE, HANGING IN HIS LAIR!  He didn't take it from the fiance's apartment either -- somehow, he too had a picture of The Stabilizer, looking tough and brandishing a gun!  Perhaps this year when I send out Christmas cards, I'll enclose a picture of myself, possibly without pants, holding a semi-automatic rifle.

A brief warning: if (for some ungodly reason) you are watching this in the company of children, the film starts out with an introduction by the distributor, Troma (which goes on WAY too long by the way) which features a topless woman.

If you like bad films, I recommend this.",1093219200,8,1239,4.495535714285714
