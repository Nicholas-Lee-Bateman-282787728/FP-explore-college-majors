Vader, The British Bulldog & Owen Hart-- Not so bad.. I give it 2 1/2 stars.. By the way.. Owen Hart (RIP) carried this match throughout.

Hollywood Backlot Brawl--Roddy Piper vs. Goldust Pt. 1 & 2.. It wasn't a match but was just funny.. Segment gets a 2 1/4

Austin vs. Savio Vega- I'm sorry but this was just a good match.. The more I watch the more I like.. 3 1/2

Ultimate Warrior vs. Triple H- This was a squash match.. And even though I think the Warrior should have ""no-selled"" the pedigree.. I think he did it to early.. He was only down for a second or two before getting up and going wild... I have to give it 1 star for The Warrior ""running wild""...... Take it for what its worth..

Undertaker vs. Diesel- I did like this match.. It was one of Diesels last.. If not last... (not sure) before heading to DUBBYA CEEE DUBBYA.. I give it 3 3/4 stars

WWF Championship Iron Man Match Bret Hart (WWF Champion) vs. Shawn Michaels- This was the best match I have ever seen in my life... No I am not a wrestling ""mark"".. I am an avid wrestling fan that understands the craft.. The chemistry was excellent and even more the wrestling was good.. And it got better the longer the match went on which is rare nowadays... When I first saw this I never saw this match continuing after Michaels never gave up for time limit.. And Bret was good at selling the emotions about ""Why!"" and etc.. It gave the match even more added specials then it already was when the match continued. This gets a perfect 5 and deservingly so..

OVERALL- I read reviews about the undercard being low class or sorry.. But dammit they had 1 hour plus just for one match.. On the other hand, I still disagree and say the undercard matches were way underrated.. The only bad match was Warrior HHH but it wasn't even a match.. Just something thrown together even though I am a Warrior ""mark"".. This Wrestlemania is up there with my top 3 of all time.. Possibly my top 2...  Definately recommended for the wrestling professors and the wrestling ""marks"".. If you don't have this Wrestlemania.. You need it because I recommend it 100%!!!",1130025600,,2149,4.409090909090909

World Championship Match[60 mins Iron Man's Match]: Bret ""Hitman"" Hart vs Shawn Michaels

Commentary: This match was just pure amazing. Shawn Michaels was able to mat wrestle Bret Hart in the first 30 minutes of the match, but then Bret Hart fought back and utterly destroyed Michaels beyond rendition. However, I can't believe that suckass bastard Shawn Michaels who isn't good enough to lick Hart's boots actually WON this match. I was completely enraged when Bret Hart lost his world title.

Match 1: Undertaker vs Diesel

Commentary: Two powerhouses go at it. The second best match in the show. Diesel and Undertaker fight hard but the Man from the Dark Side is triumphant at the end. Still a good fight from Diesel, very enjoyable match.

Match 2: Ultimate Warrior vs Hunter Hearst-Helmsley

Commentary: Ultimate Warrior whoops the living daylights out of HHH, another overrated wrestler.

Match 3: Rowdy Roddy Piper vs Goldust

Commentary: This is a kickass all out brawl and Rowdy Roddy Piper whoops Goldust in an ECW fashion.

Match 4: (Yokozuna, Ahmen Johnson, Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts) vs. (Vader, Owen Hart, British Bulldog)

Commentary: Good match, but pretty weak performance by Owen Hart and Bulldog.

Match 5: Savio Vega vs. Ringmaster(Steve Austin)

Commentary: Savio Vega was definitely the better of the two. I wonder why they let him go, since he even outwrestled Stone Cold in this match.",1123718400,,1506,5.1020408163265305

*-crap

This WrestleMania is famous for the Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels Iron Man Match, however, I feel that the undercard is underrated

Yokozuna, Jake ""The Snake Roberts"" & Ahmed Johnson vs.
Vader, The British Bulldog & Owen Hart- This was a good choice for the opener, all six men put in a solid performance ***

Hollywood Backlot Brawl Part 1 Rowdy Roddy Piper vs. Goldust- The first part of this match took place outside of the arena and was basically the first ""hardcore"" match in WWF/E history, so at the time it was pretty intense, however, time hasn't been kind to this encounter but it is still pretty entertaining ***

Steve Austin vs. Savio Vega- Austin has a solid, but unspectacular WrestleMania debut ***

Ultimate Warrior vs. Triple H- This is a two minute squash match, but it's great to see Hunter get his ass kicked and have the pedigree no-sold ***

Undertaker vs. Diesel- This is a very underrated match. Both men brought there ""A"" game and put on a memorable performance. It was pretty intense for the time, and I think I even sensed some psycology from the big guyes ****

Baclot Brawl Part 2- although part 2 was mildly entertaining, I could have lived without seeing Goldust stripped down to his undies **1/2

WWF Championship Iron Man Match Bret Hart (Champion) vs. Shawn Michaels- This is one of the most hotley debated matches of the modern era. Some go as far to say that it's the greatest match in WWF/E history, while others were bored by it. While I feel that it's not THE best, I definitally think it's a classic. The only downfall was that it took a while to get going as there were a lot of restholds in the beggining, but the psycology, stamina and athleticism were off the charts. *****

Conclusion- In my opinion this is one of the best WrestleManias ever. It has argubaly the greatest main event in Mania history, and although the undercard didn't produce any classics, I felt it was entertaining and did it's job.",1116806400,,2010,4.703703703703703
738313,3,6303937373,"The Iron Man Match for the WWF Championship was the best match in WWF history. ""The Hitman"" Bret Hart and ""The Heartbreak Kid"" Shawn Michaels went to the time limit without a single decision. Gorilla Monsoon (R.I.P.) should get a lot of credit. He restarted the match after neither superstar had scored a pinfall. He was right to do so. This decision turned out to make the match the longest match in WM history.

Goldust vs. Rowdy Roddy Piper was another great match because Piper had a huge rivalry with Goldust at the time.

Million Dollar Champion Steve Austin vs. Savio Vega was somewhat entertaining. Austin wins thanks to Ted DiBiase.

Ultimate Warrior vs. The Gentlemen Hunter Hearst Helmsley was one the worst matches on the card. Should have been on RAW.

Undertaker vs. Diesel was an outstanding match that showed how tough Diesel and Undertaker were.

All in all, the Undertaker-Diesel match and the IronMan match saved this PPV from getting 1 star.",1111708800,,961,4.835365853658536
738314,3,6303937373,"The downfall to this show was the fact that the whole focus was on the main event.  With that being said, there was little time focused on the other matches.  I guess that's understandable when you consider the fact that the main event was 60 minutes long and the show was limited to under 3 hours.  There were a few decent matches but overall it's not really worth the money.
Here's the card

Six man tag
1.  Jake Roberts, Ahmed Johnson, and Yokozuna vs Bulldog, Owen, and Vader
- the real focus of the match was Yoko and Vader feud.  Everybody else was thrown in each to make the originally planned Yoko vs Vader match more interesting.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  The match was rushed and their wasn't that much action in the match.  The match was nothing more than Vader squashing the aging Jake Roberts.
Rating *

2.  Parking Lot Brawl:  Rowdy Roddy Piper vs Golddust
- I don't really understand the motive behind making this type of match.  I can't really rate it b/c it's not really a match. Definately had some entertaining moments but entertaining alone doesn't make a good match.

3.  Steve Austin vs Savio Vega
- The crowd was pretty much dead throughout this match and I can see why.  It was not interesting at all.  Austin tried to save this match but just couldn't.  These two would have a way better match at the Beware of Dog ppv in May of that year in a strap match.  Austin wins the million dollar dream (gee I wonder who taught him that move?)
Rating *

4.  Triple H vs Ulimate Warrior
- The warrior made his return after being absent for nearly four years and just couldn't perform at the level he once could.  Triple H attacks him before the bell and hits a pedigree but Warrior refuses to sell it.  That's strange considering HHH has beating some of the best in the business with that move.  Warrior gets jacked up and hits a few clothslines, press slam, and splash for the win.  I'm no HHH fan, but I didn't think he deserved to be treated like this.  Oh, well Vince made it up to him in the last 6 years.

Rating DUD

5.  Diesel (kevin nash) vs Undertaker
- Nash was two months away from leaving the WWE to join WCW and form the NWO but leaves with a decent effort here.  This wasn't your typical big men with no moves matches.  Pretty cool when Undertaker quickly rised up after two jackknife powerbombs.  Taker shows his strength by grabbing Nash by the neck after kicking out of a close pinfall and gets up fast to deliver a chokeslam and the tombstone to seal the deal.  Not bad at all.
Rating **

Iron Man Match
6.  HBK vs Bret Hart
- I didn't know what to think about a match where two guys fight for an hour.  Sometimes, it's hard to get the fans attention after 20 minutes of action but this match delivered and sets the tone for the few later Iron Man Matches after this one.  HBK outwrestled Bret for the first 10-15 minutes until Bret aggressively took over.  HBK took some sick bumps in this one.  The back suplex from the top rope and the backdrop out of the ring was brutual.  Another cool part of this match is that you see both men do moves they have never done before.  I don't recall Hart using a camel clutch and a belly to belly suplex before or HBK using a fisherman suplex.  Again, great match with top notch wrestling that will leave you at the edge of your seat.  Of course, noone score a victory in the whole hour so it went in to OT where Michaels took over and used the sweet chin music to become the heavyweight champ for the first time and well deserved.  Couldn't been much better.

Rating *****

Overall, the only good match was the main event.  The rest of the card was rushed and their was not enough good action.  A decent Taker vs Nash match is the other highlight of the show.
Unless, you really want to check out the main event, I would not recommend this tape.",1111449600,4,3833,4.302521008403361

1. VADER, OWEN HART [R.I.P.], & THE BRITISH BULLDOG [R.I.P.] VS. JAKE ''THE SNAKE'' ROBERTS, YOKOZUNA [R.I.P.], & AHMED JOHNSON

A GOOD OPENING MATCH. SHAME ON THE WWE FOR NOT LETTING VADER MAKE ANY KIND OF IMPACT ON THE WWE. RATING; 3/5

2. STEVE AUSTIN VS. SAVIO VEGA

HERE, WE GET TO SEE PRE-STONE COLD AUSTIN. THIS WAS A PRETTY GOOD MATCH TOO. SAVIO VEGA WAS AUSTIN'S 1ST ARCH-NEMESIS IN THE WWE. RATING; 4/5

3. THE ULTIMATE WARRIOR VS. HUNTER HEARST HELMSLEY

THIS MATCH WAS THE BEGINNING OF A SHORT-LIVED WWE COMEBACK FOR THE WARRIOR. THE MATCH WAS SIMPLY TOO SHORT FOR ME TO GIVE IT A POSITIVE REVIEW. BUT I WILL SAY THIS, YOU'LL BE SUPRISED THAT TRIPLE H, WHO LOST TO THE WARRIOR IN UNDER 2 MINUTES WOULD ONE DAY WIN A SERIES OF WWE WORLD TITLES! RATING; 1.5/5

4. THE UNDERTAKER VS. DIESEL [KEVIN NASH]

A VERY GOOD MATCH BETWEEN 2 OF THE BEST BIG MEN IN THE INDUSTRY. THIS WAS A DEFINITE HIGHLIGHT OF THIS WRESTLEMANIA. RATING; 5/5

5. HOLLYWOOD BACKLOT BRAWL

RODDY PIPER VS. GOLDUST

A GREAT MATCH. ACTUALLY, THIS THING WENT ON ALL THROUGHOUT THE PAY-PER-VIEW. EARLIER, THEY WERE CHASING EACH OTHER AROUND. WELL, THEY FINALLY SETTLE IT, AND SOMEONE FINALLY WINS THE MATCH. A PRETTY EXCITING MATCH. RATING; 4/5

6. IRON MAN MATCH FOR THE WWE WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP

CHAMPION BRET HART VS. SHAWN MICHAELS

THIS WAS THE GREATEST MAIN EVENT TO EVER COME OUT OF WRESTLEMANIA!! THE RULES WERE SIMPLE. BOTH OF THESE GUYS WRESTLE EACH OTHER FOR 60 MINUTES. AND WHOEVER CAN SCORE THE MOST FALLS WITHIN THAT 60 MINUTE TIME PERIOD, WINS THE MATCH AND THE BELT. SUPRISINGLY, NO FALLS WERE EVEN SCORED IN THAT 60 MINUTE TIME LIMIT! CAUSING THE MATCH TO GO INTO OVERTIME. ANYONE WHO HATED THIS MATCH IS NOT A REAL FAN OF PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING. THIS IS JUST ONE OF THEM MATCHES YOU CAN'T HATE. MIGHT POSSIBLY BE MY FAVORITE WRESTLING MATCH OF ALL TIME. YOU DIDN'T GET THIS KINDA STUFF WITH WCW!!!! RATING; AN EXTREMELY WELL EARNED 5/5

AND SO THAT WAS THE BEST WRESTLEMANIA THE WWE HAD IN YEARS. ALL WWE FANS NEED TO GET THIS TAPE. THE WWE REALLY NEEDS TO RELEASE THIS EVENT ON DVD. LIKE ALL WWE TAPES THAT FIRST STARTED BEING RELEASED IN THE LATE 90S, THIS WAS RECORDED IN NOT SO GOOD EP, IN WHICH THEY USED LESS TAPE, BUT DIDN'T RETAIN MUCH QUALITY. HOWEVER, THERE IS ANOTHER VIDEO COPY OF THIS WRESTLEMANIA THAT WAS RELEASED BY COLISEUM VIDEO.

Rick Rude (RIP) back in 1992 but theirs was only 30 minutes (don't let that time limit fool you though, it was a great match). These guys had to keep us entertained for an hour and they both did it! The only knock I have on these type of bouts is that if there is a tie or if there is no fall/decision, there SHOULD BE AN OVERTIME!

738412,2,6303937373,"The twelth Wrestlemania boasted some quick and sometimes rushed matches, thanks in part to the time-consuming one-hour Ironman match between Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels. This match is viewed by many as a classic but at times, it is sleep-inducing. All in all, it is an excellent match and deserves credit but the time that it swallows up destroys the remainder of the Wrestlemania card.
The Undertaker facing Diesel was kind of a poor match. Despite the build-up it had been given, most fans knew that The Undertaker would win due to the fact that it was leaked that Diesel would be leaving for WCW soon afterward and having him beat one of the company's top guys beforehand would have made little sense.
Roddy Piper versus Goldust in a Backlot Brawl was great. I had always been a diehard Piper fan and seeing him come back for a rare appearance to beat the snot out of Goldust made for one of the night's few great moments.
The Wrestlemania debut of Steve Austin was only memorable for that very fact. Austin's match with Savio Vega was alright but nothing special.

Aside from this, the other matches are below average, especially the Back Lot Brawl (and Im a big Piper fan).  The Taker/Diesel match was slow, and it felt that they didn't work hard.

This match alone is worth the price of the video. The rest of the card is weak, with a few good spots here and there. Here's a brief description of each match:
Yokozuna, Ahmed Johnson & Jake Roberts vs. Vader, Owen Hart and Davey Boy Smith. 6 of the best wrestlers of all time in a brief but solid match that could have been given more minutes to make it better. Roberts shows great domination of the crowd, knowing when to move his hands to draw cheers.
Roddy Piper vs. Goldust. Entertaining because of the mocking of the O.J. Simpson car chase and its homophobic innuendos, but a waste of time from a pure wrestling standpoint.
Steve Austin vs. Savio Vega. The debut of both superstars in a Wrestlemania. Credible match but lacking excitement. Who would have known that Austin was on his way to become a legend?. Features Ted Dibiase as Austin's manager.
Ultimate Warrior vs. HHH. Triple H is wasted since his fine wrestling skills are not shown in order to job to Warrior. This is the exact same match from SummerSlam 1988 when Warrior beat Honky Tonk Man for the Intercontinental Title. Features the debut of both Sable and Marc Mero.
The Undertaker vs. Diesel. Against all odds, this bout is highly entertaining, The Undertaker works the hardest to deliver a match full of power moves, even from the top rope, Diesel delivers not one but two powebombs, the first one being a killer. One of Diesel's best matches thanks to his opponent who really knows how to sell. A legend vs. an overrated competitor.
The Hitman vs. HBK. A legendary bout, one of the best matches of the 1990's. Two living legends at their best. Full of excitement, HBK's first of three World Title runs begins with a spectacular win over the best technical wrestler ever.",1030233600,,1931,4.682352941176471

If it were not for the once-in-a-lifetime performances by Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart, this WrestleMania would've tank hard too. Nothing on the card really mattered barring the timeless Iron Man Match which made up most of the pay-per-view anyway. That being said, you have to judge this WrestleMania a little bit different from the others as this is essentially a one-trick pony, an awe-inspiring one-trick pony nonetheless. The Iron Man match will go down as one of the only bouts worth the price of an entire pay-per-view to witness. That's how truly good it was. Like them or hate them, there is nobody who can deny that Michaels and Hart set a new milestone as far as a work rate is concerned.

738541,5,6303937373,"In my mind, this will always be the last great WrestleMania.  In all the WrestleManias since then, none have been as good as WrestleMania 12.
The talent in the WWF in 1996 was probably at its highest up unto now.  The WWF had rising stars like Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels and The Rock.  And they had the established greats like Bret Hart (who will always be the greatest wrestler EVER, in this reviewer's opinion), Undertaker and Diesel.  Roddy Piper was still around, but his star-power was fading.
WrestleMania 12 is known for two things mostly - 1) The Hollywood Backlot Brawl, and 2) The Iron-Man Match for the WWF Championship.
The Hollywood Backlot Brawl is just fun to watch.  Roddy Piper and Goldust give a great performance, even if some of it is far-fetched (like the whole O.J. Simpson white van chasing sequence).  But the Iron-Man Match is what puts this WrestleMania on the map.  This match alone is worth the price-tag of the video, and anyone who has ever wanted to see a classic wrestling match should give this a view.
Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels bang heads for over 60 minutes, and there is not one dull moment of action.  From the time the bell sounded, to the time when the victor was decided, these two great athletes put on one of the best contests in WWF history.
The rest of the undercard is fun to watch, too.  Diesel and Undertaker have a good match, and the return of the Ultimate Warrior (even if was only for a couple of months) is worth seeing.
If you want to see a great WrestleMania, this is definitely a tape to get.  It's a classic, which cannot be said for all the WrestleManias.",1004054400,,1617,4.506849315068493

When I popped it into my VCR, I was amazed. In this spectacle known as Wrestlemania XII, which took place on my 12th birthday, I might add, the late Yokozuna stepped into the ring with Ahmed Johnson and Jake Roberts against British Bulldog, Vader, and Owen Hart (R.I.P.). Austin, back in the day when he was a heel, faced off against Savio Vega. Roddy Piper went nuts in a Hollywood Backlot Brawl that pitted him against Goldust, and was a fight that ended up in the ring after half an hour or so of the two of them chasing each other in their cars (It was funny because footage of Piper's white bronco reminded me of OJ Simpson. This was back in '96, mind you). Diesel and Undertaker beat the hell out of each other in one of 'Taker's best matches, along with HIAC in '97 and '98 (I haven't seen the one against Bossman yet). My man, The Ultimate Warrior makes his triumphant return in a match which made HHH's jaw drop after Warrior got up a split second after a Pedigree. The main event was definitely the best part, though. Hart and Michaels gave it their all in what was a beautiful show of technical wrestling from both men and a battle in which neither man would allow a single decision until after the 60 minute mark. This Wrestlemania is definitely one of the best I've seen, and with the excellent card and a main event that is one of the greatest of all time, I'm surprised the roof didn't blown off of the Arrowhead Pond",976752000,4,1613,4.2745098039215685

2. Steve Austin vs Savio Vega: This was just a good solid match, austins first ever wrestlemania match, and it was enjoyable, austin hits the signiture million dollar dream which I liked, Savio takes some shots with the million dollar title, overall I liked this one ***

3. Triple H(c)vs Ultimate Warrior: This was crap, was just a stupid squash match, I'm going to give it a star simply because I loved ultimate warrior *

4. Diesal vs The Undertaker: This was another good match, it was slow paced at times but I liked the way that taker kept getting up from the powerbombs, taker did get dominated the whole match though, which I didn't really like, the last 5 minutes stand out and boost up the rating ***

5. Roddy Piper vs Goldust Hollywood backlot brawl: So after there highway chase, these two settle it in the ring, it was more of a brawl so I cant rate this match, I will say that Roddy piper gets sweet revenge N/A

6. Bret Hart(c)vs Shawn Michaels WWF Title 60 Minute Iron Man Match: This match saved the show in my opinion, it was fantastic, an hour of pure golden wrestling, it did get kind of slow in the middle and thats why I cant give it 5 stars, these two last the full hour without a score, the ending is truely magnificent and memerable, shawns entrance was epic as well ****3/4

7856702,3,6303937373,"Wrestlemania XII held the first 60 Minute Ironman Match in the modern era. Michaels & Hart really set the standard on Ironman matches. Diesel & Undertaker lived up to the hype as well. Pretty than better average Wrestlemania but surprisingly this Wrestlemania only had one championship match to take place.

1. Six Man Tag Match
Vader, British Bulldog, & Owen Hart vs. Jake ""the Snake"" Roberts, Ahmed Johnson, & Yokozuna
This was pretty a solid opener. It started out with a good brawl with all six men and it turned out to be a pretty strong opener. The fans was really into it and it did its job to set up for the backlot brawl. Darn good opener. 3.5/5

2. Hollywood Backlot Brawl
Goldust vs. Roddy ""Rowdy"" Piper
This match started out very physical and brutal. Piper would just beat the holly hell out of Goldust and Goldust would even bleed as well. Goldust would soon run over Piper with his gold car. It would soon go out in the stretts and become a total car chase throughout the duration of the ppv but finally comes back to the ring right before the title match and it would end there in the ring. Decent backlot brawl. 3.5/5

3. Stone Cold Steve Austin w/ Ted Debiase vs. Savio Vega
This was a pretty dead match due to the fans reaction, the fans wasn't really all into this match but it wasn't all that boring. It's pretty watchable. Austin wins with the Million Dollar Dream. 3/5

4. Triple H w/ Sable vs. Ultimate Warrior
Not even a total contest. Triple H hits the pedigree in the first minute of the match on Warrior but Warrior gets right back up afterwards. Way too short, if you blink once, you'll miss the whole match. The fans was into it though but the match sucked. 1/5

5. Diesel vs. Undertaker w/ Paul Bearer
This match really saved the matches that was put infront of them. Desiel & Taker had a good match. They brawled on the outside and had a pretty physical confrontation out there. Desiel would start to ware down the Undertaker with some good wrestling holds and start to get the advantage. Desiel would hit Taker with 2 jacknife powerbombs but that wouldn't keep the deadman down. Pretty good big man contest. 4/5

6. 60 Minute Ironman Match for the WWE Championship.
Shawn Michaels vs. Bret ""Hit-man"" Hart
Without any question, this match is certainly a classic title bout. The match mostly consist of Michaels turning the tables on Hart and throwing out his Mexican style wrestling and sticking to the mat game that Hart is known for. An official would take a hard superkick by Michaels on the outside early in the match. One funny part of the match was when Hart tells Hebner ""check him ref, this aint a staring contest."" Ironically the first half of the match was all Michaels and the second half was all Hart. It had a great closing seconds to the match with Hart countering Michaels into his sharpshooter. The match would go to sudden death and Hart wasn't happy about that. Hart would then beat on Michaels back but Michaels would then hit Sweet Chin Music out of no where, twice. Defiantly a classic bout from these 2 phenomenal performers. Great main event. 5/5

This wasn't the best wrestlemania by any means but it had a classic Ironman match and a good big man match with a decent midcard. If yall could found this somewhere cheap under 10 bucks I would recommed on getting it but it's certainly not worth getting over 20 unless yall buy the wrestlemania anthology set. Mciahels and Hart was defiantly a classic nevertheless.",1217894400,,3468,4.556982343499198

Jake Roberts, Ahmed Johnson, and Yokozuna VS British Bulldog, Owen Hart, and Vader: Decent match but nothing to exciting.

Rowdy Roddy Piper vs Golddust: Piper would beat the holy hell out of Golddust. Dust would leave in a car and an OJ Simpson like chase would ensue as the rest of the card went on. Piper phoned in from time to time. Really stupid

Steve Austin vs Savio Vega: Austin's first big feud before he was reborn as the Rattlesnake. Decent but didn't really jump out.

Triple H vs Ulimate Warrior: Warrior's return to WWE last as long as this match did.

Somewhere in between these events, Piper and Golddust would return to the arena and end up in the ring. Piper strips Golddust down to lingere, plants a kiss on him, then pins him. Wow. Sounds as bad as writing it does.

Diesel vs Undertaker: Good story line. The match was alright but I wouldnt call it a classic.

Iron Man Match: HBK VS Bret Hart: I watched this match fully and I just wasn't into the whole match. Plenty of cool spots and near falls but I found it lagged in some places. Hart and Michaels must have really hated each other because some of the moves they did to one anther looked all to real. Good match with Michaels winning his first world title.
