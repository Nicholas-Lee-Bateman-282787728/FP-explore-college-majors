Beautiful costumes, a balanced look at both 'behind the scenes' and 'at the parties'. I really need some hot chocolate now.",1266710400,3,253,4.521739130434782
8391712,5,B0038QPLWA,"Having never been to Venice, this DVD is a fantastic primer on what to expect when there, as well as honing in on some activities that simply aren't to be missed.  The editing is superb, the visual imagery is terrific, and the dialogue is both witty an informative.  As a frequent traveller, I am pleased that this presentation wastes little time on the obvious (""Don't forget your passport..."" ""Bring extra cash..."") and focuses instead on the more out-of-the-way, harder to find, and frankly less touristy things to seek out.

I enjoyed this DVD and look forward to seeing their others in the future.",1266710400,2,602,4.825242718446602
8391713,5,B0038QPLWA,"This video is a visual feast.  If you have ever been interested in a visit to Venice, during Carnivale or not, this video will show you the places to visit and make a case for why you should go during the festival.  Trystan and Thomas visit lacemakers, glassblowers, ateliers and Carnivale balls day and night to uncover the visual splendour of this unique city.  In particular, if you have an interest in the sumptuous costumes and masks of Carnivale, or just want to gape at the spectacle, pick up a copy.  Very entertaining and informative!",1266710400,4,543,4.684210526315789
