Recently, I became aware that there is a video about her life and I ordered it. I received it last week and since then I have watched it four times. I cannot add anything that hasn't already been said about how great the video is. For the ones that object about how it's packaged, I say, you'll quickly forget about it the moment the movie starts.

766295,5,6304053886,"If ever there was a movie to see--this is definitely it. If you can get over your initial disgust at the pornographic misrepresentation, which is an insult to the woman whose life inspired this film, you will blissfuly experience the brilliance that is the beauty of Sor Juana. This movie is without doubt the most moving and accurate portrayal I have ever seen in biographical films to date. The end was so moving (we--the Spanish class) were literally sobbing. ""Su sangre fue nuestros sangre"".  As delicate as a Raphaelite painting and as bold as a Rodan sculpture, this depiction will leave you breathless at the fiery soul who was ""The Tenth Muse of Mexico"".",990057600,7,662,4.807017543859649
766296,5,6304053886,"I have to add to the previous comments. This is an excellent film that describes a woman's struggle to live a full human life in a time when women are not supposed to think, discover or invent anything. The movie has nothing to do with lesbianism but with intellectual isolation in a male society. There is no sex but a kiss. I think it is quite narrow minded to expect all the cultures of the world to follow puritanism.
In the other hand, this is not the first foreign movie that gets misleading advertising. If you get Babbete's Feast, you should skip the writing in the back as well. It is stupid.
Oh, and yes, this is not a spanish film but argentinian, by one of the best argentinian directors today. An earlier excellent movie she directed is called ""Camila"". Also controversial, and not sex oriented as some people would always think.
btw, what anglo americans call ""spanish"" language is really castillian. One of the maybe four different languages spoken in Spain is castillian, and castillian is what most countries speak in Latin America. But I think this bit of ignorance has taken over so far in pop culture that it would be hard to correct now.",976665600,15,1158,4.599033816425121
766297,5,6304053886,"The look of this film, with it's sumptuous use of color contrasts, is worth 5 stars. With rich shades of brown, it has the palette of a Rembrandt  painting, and the beautiful soundtrack by Luis Maria Serra is a compliment  to it.
The subject matter is captivating, not only for showing us some of  the genius of Sor Juana Ins de la Cuz, but also for a view of the life in  17th century Mexico. Assumpta Serra is exquisite as Sor Juana, known as the  ""10th Muse"" and one of the great poets of the Spanish golden  era.
For anyone interested in the lives of women who have made their mark  on this world, this is a must. I love the scene where she says :  ""Every theology is questionable, since it stems from reason and not  from faith"".
I must comment on the way this film has been packaged.  It is asinine. Ignore it.
Maria Luisa Bemberg is another woman who is  making a big mark on the world with her magnificent films. I also recommend  her wonderful ""Camila"".",967075200,26,962,4.283333333333333
766298,5,6304053886,"Don't be fooled by the cheap publicity on the cover: this is not a movie about lesbian nuns, but the true story of Sor Juana Ins de la Cruz, one of Spanish literature's greatest poets of all time, and perhaps the first  feminist of the Western Hemisphere, circa 1685.
Assumpta Serna shines as  the fierce, beautiful (the resemblance is striking) and brilliant Sor  Juana, the Mexican wondergirl who took the vows hoping to get an education,  astonished her friends, foes and times, and was later ordered to silence by  the Church for the sole sin of being an intelligent woman.
Based upon  the book by Nobel laureate Octavio Paz,  I, THE WORST OF ALL is a precious  little Argentine film, with the look of a Vermeer and the passionate heart  of its heroine. You will certainly enjoy it more if fluent in Spanish  (since Sor Juana's poetry is like written Mozart), but if not, see it  anyway. I'm sure you'll thank me.

766462,4,6304053886,"The true story of Sister Juana Inez de la Cruz, a nun in 17th century Mexico, born a peasant, who later
became known as one of the great poets of the Spanish language.

But in her own time she was crushed by a Catholic church frightened of women pursuing intellectual
or artistic truths

The film is beautifully shot, well acted, and always interesting.  It's an
important story of an early feminist.

But I had a few problems.  First,  the highly theatrical sets and lighting, while a style I often respond
to, didn't really seem to be serving a purpose here since the story is acted and written in a fairly
naturalistic, straightforward way.  I found myself pulled out of the film again and again to say `neat
lighting' or `cool set'.

Warning - possible spoilers ahead!

Perhaps more importantly, the climatic twist of the film, Sister Juana's finally having her spirit and
soul crushed by the church, happens way too rapidly, and mostly off-camera.  This is a woman who
would seem ready to be put to death by the Inquisition for being herself, and suddenly, without our
seeing how it happened she is mopping the floor, and staring off into space.

Last, the film sets up its antagonists, and their positions of power so clearly, that there is only one
possible path for the story to travel.  We know Juana will eventually become a victim, so the film
becomes just waiting for that painful decline.

None-the-less, a worthwhile film about an important artist and early voice for women's rights
who is sadly under-remembered by much of the world.",1326672000,,1548,4.731343283582089
766463,5,6304053886,"I'm kind of ashamed at the horrendous advertisement for this film.  First of all, they are setting up any curious pig with a serious disappointment, since the `lesbian passion' they are referring to is a simple kiss between two women, and yes it is passionate (not in the actual action but in the emotions behind it) but it is far more tasteful than insinuated by the blurb on the DVD cover.  Second, they are really discrediting this film; giving it a trashy reputation when it deserves FAR more than that.

Whoever decided that use that quote as the film's drawing force should be beaten.

`I, The Worst of All' follows the life story of Juana Ins de la Cruz, a nun in a Mexican convent during the late 1600's.  More poet than nun, more nun than woman, Juana Ins de la Cruz was a spark of controversy throughout her life, especially due to her controversial, and unapologetically so, poetry.  Thanks to the current Viceroy and his wife, Juana Ins de la Cruz is seemingly unscathed despite the fact that some highly important individuals consider her a dangerous nuisance.  Juana Ins de la Cruz draws closer to The Virreina, but soon their friendship is torn when the Viceroy is replaced and Juana is faced suddenly with extreme opposition, to the point where she is betrayed by those she trusted, used and abused as a pawn due to her stance and obvious social relevance.  Her life ends in tragedy, but not before she made a difference.

I was very unaware of this historical figure, but I'm glad that I've been able to get to know her.  Maria Luisa Bemberg's take of Juana's life is extremely well constructed, finding depth in subtleties that are often overlooked for flashier, more melodramatic notions.  In particular, that `kiss' is brilliantly captured with such subtle power.  Miss Serna is a powerhouse here; such a brilliant portrayal of a woman set in her convictions yet ultimately shaken by the cowardice of those around her.

It's a shame what they did to her.

So, if you are in search of a foreign adult film complete with steamy love scenes between hot nuns then this is NOT for you.  But, if you want an intelligent take on a historical figure who happens to be a nun (and possibly in love with a woman) then dive in, because this is worth it.",1315267200,,2261,4.603491271820449

A picture of womanhood in a culture that denied women the option of studying or philosophizing.  A culture in which those who spoke or wrote must do so under the watchful eye of the Inquisition.  A courageous, tortured and most gifted woman, born before her time, but whose works have managed to survive into our own.

766507,5,6304053886,"Note: Spanish with English subtitles.

The obscure '95 film `I, The Worst of All' is visual poetry of the highest order. Based on the life of poet, scholar, feminist and Catholic nun Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, director Maria Luisa Bemberg does a magnificent job at capturing contemporary life and attitudes inside and outside the convent in 17th century Mexico.

The majority of the storyline unfolds inside the cold, minimalist confines of the convent community. The stark visuals coupled with a shadowy, dark around the edges cinematic style creates an otherworldly atmosphere giving the production the feel of a stage play rather than a film.

The surreal nature of 'I, The Worst of All' can be fully appreciated in one particularly evocative and mesmerizing scene showing Sister Juana on her way to visit her dying Mother. As she rides methodically across the desert against the backdrop of a crimson sunset one feels as though they're watching the final brushstroke being applied to a Goya painting.

Assumpta Serna is magnificent in the role of Sister Juana; beautiful, beguiling, clever and highly intelligent, qualities that traditionally coincide with traits possessed by the serpent in the Garden of Eden. She is the perfect foil for the masculine hierarchy trying to silence the pen and tongue of the defiant and spirited nun.

Buy this one! A flawless production and a signature performance by Assumpta Serna make 'I, The Worst of All' a cinematic jewel that belongs in every serious DVD collection.

P.S.: Don't let the comment about lesbianism on the DVD case dissuade you from viewing this film, it simply isn't there. There is an intense and deeply profound relationship between Juana and her aristocratic patroness but whatever those feelings portend they are left unspoken and un-acted upon.",1196380800,10,1809,5.115254237288136
766508,5,6304053886,Excellent movie! Based on Sor Juana's biography by Octavio Paz; movie's title  refers to the way Sor Juan signed her last letter.,1168473600,3,129,4.863636363636363
766509,5,6304053886,"One of my best friends saw that I was reading a novel about Sor Juana, SOR JUANA'S SECOND DREAM, by Alicia Gaspar de Alba, and recommended this film to me -- with the admonishment to ignore the tawdry blurb on the cover: ""Lesbian passions seething behind convent walls"", indeed!  How ridiculous -- it would be like describing FORREST GUMP as ""partying with coeds in a dorm room after hours"".  It's a cheap attempt to draw the wrong conclusions about this moving story.  Don't let it put you off.
This film about the amazing woman who has been called Mexico's 'Tenth muse' -- a reference to the title Plato bestowed on Sappho -- is a beautiful piece of film-making.  Even considering the scenes that were meant to be outdoors, that were obviously shot on a sound stage, this is a lovely experience.  The direction is superb, the acting amazingly sensitive -- I was enthralled, and I usually don't enjoy films with subtitles.
Sor Juana was an amazing woman -- intellectual, creative, always pushing her own boundaries, and brave.  For a woman in her era (seventeenth century Mexico) to profess that women had just as much right to an education, to learning, as men, set her against some powerful forces -- mainly the hierarchy of the Catholic Church.  Her courage and determination in the face of such opposition is inspiring -- it's easy to see why she's seen as a hero by so many.",1037577600,47,1380,4.677685950413223
766510,4,6304053886,"The ""Tenth Muse"" has finally been portrayed accurately.  I've studyed the writings of Sor Juana for nearly a decade and continue to be impressed by her artistry.  This film captures much of what I appreciate about her and her writing.  It shows Sor Juana as a strong woman who is truly a master of her art and a master of herself.  That may seem an odd thing to say, but being a master of oneself in the cloister of the 17th century convent is a feat worthy of mention.
For years there has been speculation that Sor Juana was, at the least, a sapphic poet, and probably a lesbian.  Lets set the record straight.  There is no direct evidence that Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz was a lesbian.  Did she write love poems to the Marquesa de Mancera? Yes.  Does that make her a lesbian? No.  She was simply writing poems to, and for, a friend in a commonly accepted style.  Other contemporary male poets also wrote love poems to the Marquesa.  Does that mean they were in love with her. Not at all.  It was a common practice and was done as a sign of devotion, of friendship, and often as an attempt to earn a pension from the noble family.  Having now said that, is it possible that she was a lesbian? Of course it's possible.  Does it matter?  No!  Sor Juana is one of the finest scholars and poets of the Americas.  That's what's important.",1029974400,31,1333,4.289156626506024
766511,5,6304053886,"The video states that the film is about hot lesbian love inside the convent walls. Wrong! There are a few implied moments but nothing graphic.
This film gives the viewer an accurate depiction of the life of one of the best authors of any genre of literature. I first saw this film in a Latin American literature university classroom. It is so good that I would like to show it in my high school classroom.
Sor Juana was quite adept at placing a mirror in front of the faces of the male hierarchy and they didn't like it. She paid for it and we gained from her pain.
There is great historical value in this biographical film as well. It gives the viewer an idea of what life was like during the Spanish Inquisition in ""New Spain"" or Mexico.
I know the vendors believe that sex will sell this film. But, they are billing it all wrong. It is an intellectual foreign film. Why cheapen it by giving potential buyers a deceptive description of the content?",1015718400,37,950,4.403409090909091
766512,5,6304053886,"The movie is well made, although not much money seems to have been spent on sets! It sticks fairly closely to the basic historical data, but a quick read up on Sor Juana in the Encyclopedia Brittanica might help many viewers.
Now to the rating issue. There is no good reason why this movie should be restricted to those over 18. There is no overt nudity or genital sex.  There is a fairly chaste kiss between women. I suppose the violent scenes of nuns whipping themsleves in a penitential exercise might be offensive to some, but self-flagellation was indeed a part of Catholic monastic life until well into the 20th century, and the scene is not presented in any prurient way.  If this amounts to a need to ban the movie for young people, then the Bible also would need to be banned. It has far more sex, nudity, and violence.
Those writers who object to the ""Lesbian passion"" line on the box do have a point. Anyone buying this for erotic arousal would be profoundly mislead.
There is, however, a real lesbian aspect to this film. Sor Juana is clearly a ""woman identified woman."" She achieves her greatest triumphs while in the nurturing and all-female world of the Convent; her relationship with the Vicereine is the most heated in the film; and the destruction of her writing comes from the intrusion of the exclusively male world of the church hierarchy and the inquistion. Most importantly, her writing reflects an explicit feminist critique of women's oppression.
Just as one does not need to have genital sex in order to be a ""heterosexual,"" neither does one need genital sex in order to be part of the lesbian continuum.  Sor Juana is indeed part of the that continuum.",1006732800,21,1679,4.66554054054054
