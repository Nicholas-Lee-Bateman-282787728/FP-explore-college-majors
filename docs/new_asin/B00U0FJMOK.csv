8703680,4,B00U0FJMOK,"I had seen this documentary on Netflix while visiting my folks, and starting in the cattle industry, I wanted a copy to keep. I did not realize that this copy did not have English subtitles (like the Netflix version).
Also this has been a crash course in the difficulties surrounding formatting and region code issues. Which once resolved, still leaves the problems with language.",1472169600,,380,4.953125
8703681,5,B00U0FJMOK,"I just watched the French version with English subtitles.  AMAZING documentary on beef.  I would have ordered several copies if I could be certain it plays on US DVD/Blue Ray players.  EVERY steak house chef, every American who fancies themselves as a BBQ king and every rancher adn butcher in the US need to watch this.  Incredibly enlightening into the quality of beef.  I have even transposed this as relates to Eastern Iowa Deer versus Western South Dakota Muley, because there IS a difference in grain fed vs. grass fed.  I'm not going to say better or worse, Fat Vs Lean, but this is an awesomely instructional film.  It is revolutionary because it will change the way your think about meat and how it is raised, processed and ""hung"".  LOL the Brits are so funny.  ""Give me some well hung meat"" she says to the butcher.  Attached is some that West River Muley I cured and smoked.",1452124800,3,885,4.579617834394904
