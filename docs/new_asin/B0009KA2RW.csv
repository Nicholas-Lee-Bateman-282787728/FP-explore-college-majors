2296989,4,B0009KA2RW,"Out of love for ""Shaun of the Dead"" and Nick Frost aka ""Ed""; I purchased this set kind of blind but wasn't too disappointed.  It's clever and funny and gives invaluable advice for survival in a unique way.(tongue in cheek)  I would recommend this set to people that are huge Nick Frost fans but am not sure that it will have as much possible broad appeal as ""Shaun of the Dead"" eventually got.",1123027200,,393,4.36986301369863
2296990,4,B0009KA2RW,"I bow before the Greatness that IS Nick Frost.  We enjoyed his show, especially the zombie segment with Simon.",1122940800,,110,4.7894736842105265
2296991,5,B0009KA2RW,"Admit it, you love the Frost. Whether you've seen SPACED or SHAUN OF THE DEAD you cannot forget the legend that is Nick Frost...and here he is presenting his own show! What could be better?!!!

In this underrated tv series first shown in the UK in 2002 directly after filming SPACED series 2, Nick risked all his guns to try to warn viewers of the most dangerous situations in life and how to survive them. Yes that's right; Nick braves frostbite (no pun intended), huge bears, poisonus spiders, heatstroke, snakes, impalement, minefields and many more near death situations. Of course he survives them all, but he's The Frost! Whoever said Mike from SPACED was absolutely no indication of what Nick Frost was really capable of?!

Watch this if you've heard of him, watch it even if you haven't. This is top entertainment and you will be glued to the TV set. You will also be taught a thing or two. So next time you decide to go hiking in the desert, bring Nick Frost along with you!",1117065600,17,983,4.548022598870056

8062452,3,B0009KA2RW,"I got this only because it had Nick Frost. It's as if they filmed the entire show in one week in Florida. Like the BBC is like, here Nick, we'll give you this free vacation, if you film this show whilst you're there. Simon Pegg was great in the bonus features. As another poster said, it's only great IF you like Nick Frost. If I were you though, I'd buy Hyperdrive instead!",1311292800,,374,4.208333333333333
8062453,3,B0009KA2RW,"I bought this hoping for a funny little time killer. It had a few funny moments, but they were few and far between. Not unpleasant to watch, just not great.",1310947200,,156,4.233333333333333
8062454,4,B0009KA2RW,"I don't take this show any more seriously than I did the latest Bear Grylls extravaganza where he was purportedly put into Extreme Danger and somehow extricated himself.  The nice thing about DANGER:  50,000 VOLTS! is that it refuses to take itself very seriously either.  The show was produced in the wake of Frost's sudden popularity after the sit-com SPACED, where he played an amiable gun-nut and survivalist, and the various ""danger"" scenarios were mostly set-ups for the host to be charming and amusing, which was not exactly a stretch.  Mind you, the information included was accurate and digested from time to time in half-hour chunks, this show is very pleasant entertainment--For The Whole Family, even.

And at least once, you really should listen to the commentary track -- not as family-friendly, but Frost and producer John Riley provide a lot of very amusing anecdotes about the production of the show itself (which shot everywhere from Florida to Finland), and the fact is, Frost is great to listen to even when he's nattering on about nothing in particular.  I can see an entire second career for the fellow providing amusing commentary tracks for other people's movies.  It might even make them worth watching.",1276560000,,1228,5.019704433497537
8062455,5,B0009KA2RW,"If you need your Nick Frost fix, this DVD doesn't disappoint. A few of his friends make some awesome cameos in it too. Pick it up if you are a Shaun of the Dead/Hot Fuzz lover.",1273363200,,176,3.9166666666666665
8062456,5,B0009KA2RW,"If you are a fan of Spaced, Shuan of the Dead, or Hot Fuzz and a fan of Nick Frost in general then i highly recommend getting this.",1232841600,,131,3.7142857142857144
8062457,3,B0009KA2RW,"This is an entertaining show, but I think only Nick Frost's presence makes it worthwhile. If you don't like Nick Frost, then you might find the show cumbersome and dangerously brief in its survival tactics. One of the episodes actually suggests that untrained people should perform tracheotomy  on a choking victim with a penknife and a pen!

The special feature ""Danger 50,000 Zombies"" is actually much more entertaining and has a bonus appearance from Simon Pegg.",1199577600,,465,5.105263157894737
8062458,5,B0009KA2RW,"Nick Frost is so funny and dare I say - cute. The shows and special features are fantastic but do listen to the commentary, you will learn alot about the behind-the-scenes going-ons. Danger 50,000 volts is a bargain at twice the price.",1156204800,9,235,4.619047619047619
8062459,5,B0009KA2RW,"This show is Fried gold... simply great! The show is funny and really informs you on how to survive dangerous moments. Plus the Danger 50,000 Zombies featuring Simon Pegg is well worth the $26 price tag for the dvd set.",1127260800,5,219,4.5
