1085675,5,6305908257,"Incredible look at what burlesque was like in the 50's. Forget the comics (they're awful) and enjoy the ladies. Two reasons to see this are Bettie Page and Tempest Storm. Storm was a first rate stripper of the day and Bettie Page was, well, Bettie Page. Her girl-next-door quality made her a favorite photographer's model and a girlie film cutie. She wasn't a real stripper but a lovely ""come-on"" girl. She's the cue card girl here and you can see why she was such a delight. She always seems to be having a good time. The other strippers are so-so with Trudy Wayne being an exception. But check this out for Page and Storm. A must see for nostalgia buffs. See also ""Varietease"".",1036022400,22,679,4.528455284552845
1085676,5,6305908257,"Betty Page!  Need I say more?  Makes me so glad I am from Tennessee!  She completely outshines the other females (all is not as it would seem) in her introductions, her maid role with Tempest Storm (who resembles Bozo the Clown with big breasts), and most of all, in her own number.  What a DOLL!  This is a piece of history that should not be missed by any fan of 1950's burlesque.  I also enjoyed the ""Pepe and Roccio"" number and Twinne Wallen!  Camp and fun at its best!  I am so glad I bought this DVD -- Irving Klaw who became a political martyr -- at his best! If you want nudity, this is not for you.  If you want a period piece that is a collector's item, don't miss this!",984268800,6,680,4.090909090909091
1085677,3,6305908257,"After much anticipation, I purchased and watched this very clear (as clear as a 45 year old video source can be) DVD movie. I checked everything out  thoroughly, from the feature to the extra clips to the audio commentary.  After much thought, I've come to the conclusion that this movie is for the  devoted only. If you like 50's burlesque, then you're all set. If you're  looking for a little more flesh, sorry. Although the back of the DVD gives  a ""Brief Nudity"" warning, there is absolutely no nudity. Fans of  the hard stuff should look elsewhere. Those of you wishing to expand your  library to include some women from the burlesque era of the 1950's will  enjoy it for what it is... a piece of History.",966297600,12,710,4.535433070866142
1085678,4,6305908257,"This video shows the best of the striptease variety shows of the 50's. Some of the most beautiful striptease ladies ever assembled, including TEMPEST STORM, one of the biggest tease ""artists"" of the time, shows the  art of the tease throughout the video. There are appearances by JOE E. ROSS  better known for his co-starring role in the tv show: CAR 54 WHERE ARE YOU  and BILKO.Included in the variety of beautiful women is THE  most  photographed pin-up girl in history, who to this day has a following of  fans all over the world. The sexy Tennessee tease,BETTIE PAGE! Bettie  opens the show with a sexy fun dance that gives you the feeling she's  dancing just for you. Bettie steals the scene asmiss Storms maid. Bettie is  also the girl who introduces each of the girls in her own alluring way.  Bettie returns to dance her way into your heart and mind as only BETTIE  PAGE can. Oh......there is a little surprise in the video that made me  chuckle. Things aren't always what they seem when it comes to striptease.",953337600,10,1019,4.6

7897172,4,6305908257,"This movie contains Bettie Page footage, but she's never nude, and she doesn't say a word. A disappointment for Bettie Page fans.",1410739200,,129,4.909090909090909
7897173,3,6305908257,"This DVD is a collection of burlesque acts including a weird reverse strip bit. My wife and I couldn't help laughing at this thing... this used to be considered entertainment? We laughed at the unconvincing drag acts, the incredibly restrained ""dancing,"" the outfits... we laughed at everything, in fact, except at the comedians. The material done by guys like Joe ""Ooooh, ooooh!"" Ross was either old or jokes so obvious you could finish the punchline yourself. An interesting show, but not something I would watch more than once.",1384214400,,530,5.034090909090909
7897174,5,6305908257,"Okay, so what's all the fuss over Bettie Page? If you don't get it, this DVD should clarify matters. Page is consistently voted as the top pin-up model of all time and in 1955's TEASERAMA, which was produced and directed by Irving Klaw, she gives us a pretty good assessment of herself that justifies her cult status.

TEASERAMA is a variety stage show featuring singing, dancing, Vaudeville-type comedians and, of course, lots of girls performing burlesque. Made in a more innocent time, the film doesn't contain nudity or profanity - it played in respectable theaters - but it's definitely not prudish either; the humor is suggestive and the eroticism is direct. However, all of it is done with the taste and class of a bygone era. TEASERAMA is the last in a trilogy of burlesque films featuring Bettie Page, the other two being STRIPORAMA (1953), and VARIETEASE (1954). In all of them, the Queen of Pin-ups with her trademark bangs and delightful smile performs various routines that demonstrate her undeniable rapport with the camera, and her ability to personally connect with the viewer in a way that's both sensual and playful. TEASERAMA also has Bettie introduce the other performers by coming out onstage changing the placards wearing a different little costume each time. The main attraction is the boudoir sequence with the top burlesque star of the day, the fantastic Tempest Storm, in which Bettie plays Tempest's French maid. Other highlights are Cherry Knight's partial striptease and the standup comedy of Dave Starr and Joe E. Ross.

Something Weird Video's Special Edition DVD of TEASERAMA is excellent, having been transferred from an original, 35mm release print with beautiful Eastman color. The extras include a commentary by roadshow promoter David F. Friedman and DVD producer Mike Vraney, original trailers for TEASERAMA and VARIETEASE, Bettie Page's bubble bath from STRIPORAMA, and her short subject TEASER GIRL IN HIGH HEELS.

For an entertaining sampling of a segment of classic '50's Americana and the iconic Bettie Page, this film delivers the goods. Highly recommended, especially for connoiseurs of the subject material.",1379808000,,2153,5.198847262247838
7897175,2,6305908257,....Embarrased for the lot of them..?...Pretty Pathetic...Remember Scollay Square & The Old Howard..?..!..Well i do have Betties autographed 8X10...RIP Bettie..!,1293753600,,161,7.1
7897176,4,6305908257,"I once had the VHS, and there was an ""Apache Dance"" number in that tape--however--that dance number has been removed from this DVD, through no fault of Bettie Page.  It is, though, an excellent representation of the nostalgic 50s-60s burlesque scene, and still has some funny joke skits that are very enjoyable.",1168387200,5,311,4.980769230769231
7897177,5,6305908257,"Say what you want about Bettie's dancing, this doesn't detract from the material. In fact, good dancing would have ruined it. See, THIS AIN'T ABOUT THE DANCING! Great dancers can be seen every day and this doesn't make them sexy, but sexy people, which Bettie Page certaionly was, are sexy doing anything. Dancing? Who cares! The strangeness of her dancing actually enhances the effect. It's kinda hard to say exactly what she's doing sometimes, which only makes it more fascinating, even timeless.",1156118400,8,498,5.085365853658536
7897178,5,6305908257,"Bettie loses some ""coolness points"" when she dances, but if you go into frame-by-frame mode on your DVD player it's obvious that each frame of her dancing would have made a great still shot in and of itself. Proof that she was a great poser, and a lousy dancer, but as she has said herself, she was ""far from being a professional dancer"". Still, she is very appealing, despite the fact that neither my husband nor myself could contain our unabated laughter during her dance scenes. Her sparkle and sense of fun are evident throughout, she is in great shape, and her ever-changing and playful facial expressions are absolute treats to see.

Plus! You get to ""Hear Bettie speak!"" in addition to seeing her jump around - uhhm I mean dance.

The best part of the DVD is, yes, the silent, black and white arcade film loop of Bettie made specifically for those old-time coin-activated viewers....Bettie gyrates up to a point, then the screen is suddenly blocked out with a caption telling the viewer to insert coins to see more of the film. This of course occurs at a regular basis throught this particular short, as it did when those types of films were originally shown. Classic camp!

There are also appearances by a rather famous, albeit scary-looking drag queen from the time, and some professional strippers who could have passed for male drag queens...but I bought these really just for the Bettie Page segments; these two DVD's are a must-have for Bettie Page fans.

Viewing these will most likely result in the viewer alternating fits of laughter with admiration for the beauty and playfulness of Bettie Page in her prime.",1100995200,45,1625,4.772241992882562
7897179,5,6305908257,"This movie is worth buying for several reasons!
First, it will give you an appreciation of what exactly the American Sexual Revolution accomplished in practical terms. In terms of adult content, most of the material in this video could now be shown on prime time TV without so much as a raised eyebrow. Even under silk negligees the performers are wearing pasties.
Secondly, it is a great snapshot of underground entertainment that adults of that era could only experience in the confines of smelly old movie houses. That is, if you could brave the worst streets of downtown, and risk being seen going into a ""[adult]"" theater. There were no video tapes or DVD's to rent.
The performers run the gamut from the lackluster to the stellar.
There was Vicky Lynn, a ""female impersonator"" --as they euphemistically called drag queens. His dance numbers showed uncommon grace and charm, including a Flamenco dance that borders on hilariously serious.
There are several other worthy performers including Vaudeville comedians Joe E. Ross and Dave Star, who prove that blue comedy doesn't have to be filthy to be dirty.
Tempest Storm was the headliner, and had impressive natural endowments as her main draw. But her performance seems creaky and wooden.
But all comparison is unfair considering the true star of the show was the inimitable Bettie Page. She was twice the woman Marilyn Monroe was []! Bettie had an easy, natural familiarity about her. She was the girl next door who got all grown-up while you were away at school. With her 36-23-35 figure, and signature blunt bangs haircut, Bettie stamped an indelible icon in our consciousness of the naughty-girl.
Ironically, the best part of the DVD is a silent, B&W arcade film loop of Betty posing and dancing. There is no nudity, but the way she smiles and moves her body leaves NO doubt as to the intent of the film.
Note: This movie was made just months after Senator Joseph McCarthy lost his seat as chair of the GCOS.",1052352000,22,1967,4.839762611275964
