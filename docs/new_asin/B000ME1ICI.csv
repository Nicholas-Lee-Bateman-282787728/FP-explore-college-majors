8168099,1,B000ME1ICI,This is the worst movie I've ever seen. With the exception of few brief scenes the whole movie consists of shots of an actress walking around St. Petersburg telling the story. No wonder the DVD does not have subtitles - you better read the story by yourself instead of listening it on DVD. If I could I would give this movie negative 5 stars.,1248825600,,342,4.359375
