3904453,4,B002C6VMFW,"This beautifully photographed nature study follows the adventures of a young meerkat from the time he first emerges from his underground nest - through to the time he becomes a young adult taking responsibility for the care and feeding of other members of his extended family. Paul Newman's narration takes the form of a dramatic storyline that lends continuity to Kolo's adventures.

My only criticism of this documentary is that it doesn't provide enough background information about meerkats. I didn't watch the popular TV series ""Meerkat Manor,"" so I came fresh to these images of meerkats. I would have liked to know where their species fits in the scheme of things, without having to do independent research. Are they related to lemurs - to prairie dogs - to moles? What geographical range do they occupy? You won't get answers to these questions on this film.

However what is on the screen is cute and captivating. And:
SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER
I think this documentary would be suitable for the whole family. Although there are a few scenes of predation, our protagonist Kolo himself makes it safely through all the perils he encounters. So there's nothing here that should be too disturbing even for very young children.",1259625600,8,1233,4.951690821256038

but cunning.",1390176000,,279,4.833333333333333
3904461,5,B002C6VMFW,"For us, humans, it is a mini-Odissey; but for Kolo the young Meerkat it was as heroic as crossing scyla and caribdis or fighting Cyclops.

This motion picture is a hybrid between a documentary and a movie. It is educational but it is also a story (so artistic license was occasionally taken for dramatic effect).

Filmed with state-of-the-art techniques (by 2008 standards) and with an inspiring storyline wonderfully narrated by Paul Newman, this is a must see for the entire family.",1381708800,,484,4.962962962962963

3904463,5,B002C6VMFW,My 9-yo daughter and I watched this and loved it. The footage is remarkable and the story is uplifting and heart breaking as well as being educational. The meerkats are adorable and it was great to hear Paul Newman's voice narration in what was obviously one of his last performances.,1361145600,,284,4.7

3904466,5,B002C6VMFW,"As usual with other items I have purchased from Amazon, the DVD arrived on time.  This is a well put together documentary on a family of meerkats and their day to day survival.  Prior to watching this documentary, I did not know that much about meerkats.  It is both entertaining and informational.  It also takes you on an emotional ride.  This was well worth the purchase.  Highly recommended.",1336262400,,395,4.735294117647059
3904467,5,B002C6VMFW,"If you like ""small furries"" or birds and are not looking for a scientific study, this is a terrific movie. This movie is an ""adventure"" about fascinating meerkats interacting naturally in their own environment. Paul Newman performs flawlessly as the narrator, telling the story of one meerkat family with the focus on one pup's journey toward adulthood.  The film allows you to vicariously feel the heat of the African desert while enjoying the antics of meerkat pups and birds. There is a good mixture of gentle humor and pathos.  Other African animals, including lions, giraffes, and ostriches, are filmed interacting with (or ignoring) the meerkats.  The smooth aerial pans, the animal and bird close-ups, the in-the-burrow filming of meerkats feeding, sleeping, and battling a predator are all excellently done. Plus there are beautiful cloud shots as well.",1311552000,5,861,5.2700729927007295
3904468,5,B002C6VMFW,Thanks for offering this item.  It is something newish about the Meerkats.  The little guys are just great.,1287187200,,107,4.888888888888889
3904469,5,B002C6VMFW,This issue is if you never saw Meerkat Manor then this is really good film to get. So I gave it a 5 rating. If you are new to Meerkats I highly recommend getting Meerkat Manor.,1280793600,,176,3.9166666666666665
3904470,5,B002C6VMFW,This one was extra special because it was a totally new story and with Paul Newman narrating. I didn't have to cry over missing Mozart and Flower. How could I not love the stories about these incredible creatures. My heart breaks when anything happens to one of them. The Lowry Park Zoo that is near to me has a group of these little cuties. I never spend less than 30 minutes watching these lovable little animals. They have an adopt an animal program that helps support the animals at our zoo. I'm hoping soon I will save enough money up to adopt one of these little guys.,1271635200,5,574,4.373831775700935
3904471,5,B002C6VMFW,"Well produced movie with both excitement and a little sadness.  Newman's narration is very well done, glad I chose his over the others that are offered.  If you like meerkats you'll love this movie.",1271203200,,198,4.794117647058823
3904472,5,B002C6VMFW,Excellant. I fell in love with these little creatures. They show a loving example of family.,1261958400,,92,4.8125
3904473,4,B002C6VMFW,"On its own, this is a good movie.  The close-ups of eagles flying are amazing.  And Paul Newman shines as narrator.  The issue is if you never saw Meerkat Manor then this is really good film to get.  But if you were a fan of Meerkat Manor then this movie pales in comparison.  So I gave it a rating in between 3 and 5 depends on what you have seen before.  If you are new to Meerkats I highly recommend getting Meerkat Manor season 1.  In my opinion this was one of the top 5 television series of all time.",1259798400,27,506,4.0
