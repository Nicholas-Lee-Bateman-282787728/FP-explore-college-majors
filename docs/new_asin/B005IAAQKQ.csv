4708793,1,B005IAAQKQ,"While the movie does give some unique insight into the FLDS Church, I found the movie to be boring and hard to watch. I am also skeptical of everything negative said throughout the movie about the FLDS Church by these former members. While I agree that Warren Jeffs is a pedophile, I'm hesitant to judge the rest of the Church and it's members.  The movie's R rating is completely unnecessary as there is not much language and no sex/violence. Jeeremy Johnson was the best part of the film and ironically he is currently indicted for fraud as the method for obtaining his ""financial success"".",1363478400,2,592,4.6923076923076925
4708794,5,B005IAAQKQ,"These kids are being kicked out of the FLDS or are running away from it and basically have to re-learn the truth about the world and what it is really like. THey had been denied education, newspapers, toys, time to play, ability to choose who they will marry, and been fed brainwashing lies by the self-proclaimed FLDS prophet, Warren Jeffs, about the evils beyond the compound where they lived.

It's sad to see them excited about their new world, yet lonely for their families they left behind. A lot of them in the documentary consoled themselves with alcohol and drugs. Some tried to get a better education through the Job Corps, a couple of the males tried to join the miitary but had been turned away due to legal issues from the FLDS.

Worth watching and definitely worth making a follow-up documentary on these kids to see where they are now.",1359244800,5,850,4.622516556291391
4708795,5,B005IAAQKQ,"This documentary gives valuable insight into the FLDS, a closed community of polygamist extremists living near the Utah/Arizona border. You should watch it.",1349222400,,156,5.826086956521739
4708796,1,B005IAAQKQ,"I found this documentary to be extremely lacking.  From the first moments of a chaotic rescue, the viewer is thrust into this world with no guidance.  I had no idea what was going on.

For the next 80 minutes, we are shown just random footage of the boys lifestyle outside of Colorado City.  With no narration, I felt like I was just watching someone's home video.  I never got a sense of who the boys were, and couldn't even really remember their names until the end!  We immediately see them in a lifestyle of a typical American teen, and these boys get into drugs as well.  I wanted to see their journey and how they got to that point.",1333670400,3,638,4.310924369747899
4708797,3,B005IAAQKQ,"""Sons of Perdition"" is a documentary about the small town of Colorado City in Arizona, a community controlled by a bizarre cult known as the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS).

I read about Colorado City in several books, but this is the first time I've actually seen how the community looks like. The people wear old-fashioned dresses, and the girls ride horses or ponies. It looks creepy, like M. Night Shyamalan's movie ""The Village"" in real life.  But of course, some people might find it idyllic, a little bit like the Amish. In reality, child labour is common, dating is prohibited, and all marriages are decreed by the leader, Warren Jeffs. The cult is polygamous, there are no real schools, and defectors are shunned. Warren Jeffs himself was recently sentenced to life imprisonment for various polygamy-related crimes.

""Sons of Perdition"" follow a group of teenagers who manage to escape from the clutches of the cult. They move to the nearby town of St. George, where they are taken care of by social workers and volunteers. The defectors are harassed by cult members who want them to move back. Life on the outside turns out to be problematic: many of the defected teens can't go to high school since they lack a real address, the local Job Corps look like a stockade, and the U.S. Army doesn't want them either. One of the local philanthropists in St. George get sick and tired of his teenage wards after they start taking amphetamine, met and cocaine. The educational level of the young ex-cultists is dismally low. One of them think Bill Clinton started World War II, while another doesn't know that Washington is the federal capital of the U.S.!

Still, ""Sons of Perdition"" ends on a positive note. It seems most of the teens featured eventually make it, and manage to stay out of trouble. Some eventually attend high school. As already mentioned, FLDS leader Jeffs serves a life sentence, and the documentary gives the impression that more and more people are leaving Colorado City. One of the teens managed to rescue both his mother and one of his sisters.

""Sons of Perdition"" is a pretty low key documentary. If you're into action or hefty scandals, you might actually find it boring. However, people interested in cults, polygamists or the darker side of Mormondom, might find it interesting.",1321056000,6,2345,4.867167919799499
4708798,3,B005IAAQKQ,"More informative and much more real than ""sister wives""  or ""growing up Amish"".  It was so slow that it was difficult to Focus on the whole thing (I found myself surfing the net & FB'ing during it).",1477958400,,198,4.324324324324325
4708799,3,B005IAAQKQ,"The worst comedy I ever had to suffer through.

4708807,5,B005IAAQKQ,"Very interesting documentary about the lives of fundamentalist LDS youth who decide to leave the faith. It documents their lives as they grapple with estrangement from their families and communities, homelessness, and drug use. These teens are made to feel by their so called ""prophet"" that they are going to hell because they left the faith, hence the title of the documentary. The film shows the joys of leaving the restrictive FLDS faith such as the young women being allowed to cut their hair for the first time and enjoying music with other exiled youth. The film also shows the interconnectedness of this unique community as they readily take in other runaways and help them  establish themselves in normal society. I highly recommend this documentary, I rarely post reviews but I found this film to be rather touching and insightful.",1476230400,,840,5.0

4708837,3,B005IAAQKQ,"This documentary is about some of the children who escaped or were thrown out of the Mormon community that was run by Warren Jeffs. It was very sad as these children have been brought up to believe that if they leave they will go to hell as well as never see their families again. At the very least they have to give up everyone they love and the only way of life they know. Yet they do escape because of the restrictive way of living, abuse and sometimes being thrown out ( boys as there are not enough girls for all the older men if the boys all stay) . It is a sad story because they don't take the hands of those trying to help them to have a good life, too traumatized and dysfunctional by their upbringings. I wonder if any of them ended up remotely happy. They are so behind in school, it would take a lot of work to catch up and graduate high school or even go to college, so almost all give up, drink and so drugs, and perhaps feel like why try as I am going to hell.",1466899200,,976,4.01025641025641

In their own words they describe how the whole system in places like Colorado City work - allegedly controlled by a single man in prison (""Jeffs"").
I found it depressing as these these young folks were brought up in very insular families with lots of siblings, and are suddenly thrust into a strange world with nobody until services can be provided. Will make you appreciate your own family and realize they should not be taken for granted.
Still, not a ""happy"" picture so be aware. The alleged abuse described will make some viewers stomach's turn.",1464652800,,741,4.796875

4708931,3,B005IAAQKQ,"Interesting but disturbing subject matter. It's sad that anyone would feel they have the right to control and manipulate others like this. It's also amazing that anyone would allow themselves to be subject to that. Obviously a lot of inbreeding involved.

I saw similar circumstances with ""Latter Day Saints ""in Pocotello, ID a few year""s a couple years ago. The LDS control everything in that area and ostracize anyone who doesn't want to comply to LDS doctrine. This accepted behavior is to the detriment of the area.

One wonders if their former life in the Crick allowed the language and if not, why what reduced them to this level of communicating?  They must have been exposed to people who made them believe this was acceptable.  You can only hope they have some opportunity to rise above their tough beginning in life and strengthen themselves with the same courage they showed by escaping their weak parents and the evil that presented itself as religion.

It is amazing that so many people can be brainwashed by some pervert who worships his male member and justifies it in the name of God.  What is equally amazing is that any woman would have such low esteem as to ""share"" this moron.  Even more confounding is the gullible men in this sect.  Maybe they too are obsessed with their male members as well and fancy themselves the only rooster in the pen.  Well, what can a person say.  See the film and you will have empathy for the victims, many of whom are so brainwashed they believe the lie.  Those who have escaped this need all the help they can get and are to be admired for their courage.",1463616000,,700,4.2180451127819545
4708944,4,B005IAAQKQ,"This film is meaningful on so many levels, especially when, in comparison, teens who have never known a sequestered lifestyle insist their own rights are being trod upon, enjoying as many do, particularly affluent or upscale lifestyles, courtesy of their hard-working parents or as some must be, single-parent living.  It's tough because you listen to these kids, 15, 16, 17 years of age-they all sound as if they are upwards of 40 or 50. They do struggle with boundaries, because now they have free will, free choice-I recall quite well my own sense of being my own woman...at 21, and not really knowing squat; but for teens like Joe and his buddies from ""the Crick"", they've never known the pleasure of just sleeping till noon, partying till 4 a.m., and wake up to do it all again. Little wonder the behaviors they fall prey to, trying the drugs scene, pushing limits, all come from never having to make a decision about anything. Told what to do from birth, who can blame them for their initial indiscretions? However, along with that comes the caveat of ""We are the choices we have made"".  True enough.
On a humanistic level though, watching these kids come to a greater realization of their own hopes and dreams, rather than as the never-ending work force of their elders alone, makes me bleed for each and every single one of them.  But for an accident of birth.  I understood perfectly the one kid not knowing about Bill Clinton, but Hitler? No. Not necessary to Warren Jeffs visionary claim on them. Silly thoughts they won't need inside the FLDS.
Cults are not new to any society, which rather reminds one of the middle east, and the cult-like growth of religious fanaticism.  Like a sort of emotional bubonic plague, how easy and swift is the transmission from host to vector to widespread contamination.  And it does not escape me that this is precisely the impact and INSULT men like Warren J. are to free-thinking peoples, taking away what is not theirs to have, and never giving back the gifts they have stolen. It's disgusting. Filth, one a purely evil level.

My hope is that Jeffs never again sees the light of day as a free man.  I wonder how he likes his new jail life, some 9 or 10 years in? I hope longevity is huge in his family. May he live until he is 99 plus a day, never again able to rape young girls, force marriage and unwanted children on weaker-minded women, make prisoners and work slaves of the young men.  I would wish for him to live forever, because doesn't he believe that his true reward will be as a child of god, with eternal life, in heaven? I know he does, or at lest professes to do so. Then may death be denied him until his flesh outwardly and inwardly falls away in the foulest of stenches....which only his mind may ever equal in degree and scope.  He truly is an evil and fiendish person.

4708946,4,B005IAAQKQ,This was so disturbing!  I feel these children are permanently damaged by this destructive cult and they will have problems throughout their lives.

They leave one place because of boundaries and when they get to the next place the want no boundaries but they don't understand that they need to place some restrictions and be able to take direction from some people. It sucks how the FLDS defames Jesus. These kids don't truly know Jesus and I wish someday they would choose to see who he truly is and that they are no longer a slave to man but a servant of the Lord. These kids aren't bad people but they have to realize that without structure and a plan in life they will continue to wander, trying to figure out who they are.",1460160000,,671,4.291338582677166

Those young men are thrown to the wolves without the education they need to become the  contributing members to society that they can be. Losing and leaving everything the have ever known and all the family they have ever had.

4708956,5,B005IAAQKQ,"I purchased this years ago for research I was writing on a book about religious cults.  It almost broke my heart to see how these cult leaders and families threw away these male teens because they competed for girl brides within this LDS cult where girls are forced into sexual relationships to much older men at the demand of their elders.  The male teens are forced out of their homes, away from their families, jobless and some have to resort to prostitution, theft or begging to survive in a world that they had been told as youth was hell on earth and should stay away from.  Their education was so poor in the cults that they simply could not compete with other teens on the outside on a level playing field.  Naturally, faced with these seemingly unsurmountable consequences, some ""sons of perdition"" have resorted to suicide, crime and drugs to try to make it another day.  This should be a national awarness problem, but as usual, has been swept under the social rug of taboo subjects.  If we placed as much attention on these throwaways as we do on the forced acceptance homosexualtity on society, the banning of the bible and prayer from school, the promotion of secularism, the orphans would be better off for our attention to their problem.",1394755200,,1253,4.672727272727273
4708957,4,B005IAAQKQ,"Here's a suggestion: Before you put this movie in your queue, read the book ""Lost Boy"" by Brent W. Jeffs. Brent grew up in the Fundamental Latter Day Saints (FLDS) and is actually a nephew of Warren Jeffs, the de-facto (though jailed) leader of that polygamous Mormon sect. The emotional and sexual abuse Brent endured is horrifying, but the book also provides an inside look into the bizarre and isolated FLDS world, in which Warren Jeffs is glorified a lot like Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il were glorified in North Korea. Read Brent Jeffs' book, THEN watch ""Sons of Perdition."" You will have a much better perspective on what these boys are going through.",1372464000,9,656,4.663793103448276

As to the kids, too bad about that 'permanent address' demand from the county/state, which is very common, unfortunately. There should be a clear and easy accommodation for certain situations. Not being in school, learning, having guided appropriate social experiences, and professional counseling/therapy, left them unmoored, lost, and only accentuated their isolation and loneliness. Hanging out in another older exiles living room getting drunk or high is not what they need or actually want. (Especially one who doesn't see the risk of throwing small children through the air across the room.) And the years keep going by. At the end it looked like a few things were coming together for Bruce and Sam but really, they lost another two years which was completely avoidable.
