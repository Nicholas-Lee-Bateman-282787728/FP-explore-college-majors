8371827,5,B002KB8ML6,"great dvd!  Filled with little known but extremely interesting information regarding the Submarine services during the cold war.  A real eye opener.  After viewing it I have nothing but admiration for the men who form the ""silent service"".  I loaned it to several of my friends and have thus far been unable to retrieve it such is its popularity.  I highly recommend ""blind Man's Bluff"" in either book or dvd format.",1372550400,,416,4.802816901408451
