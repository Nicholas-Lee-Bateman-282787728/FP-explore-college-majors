8529100,2,B008NA3I26,"As a drama this absolutely tanks. There would be no point watching it except for the appearance of Phoebe Cates and Ted Wass (the dad from Blossom). The story is non-existent, the acting sucks, the film making is amateur hour.  As others have pointed out, this was made for TV and then best forgotten.",1439078400,,301,4.574074074074074

8529105,4,B008NA3I26,"I was fifteen when this was showed on TV. I was in love with Ted Wass and thought Phoebe Cates was great. It would never win an Emmy, but a fun watch if you like over the top drama and who doesn't?",1386979200,,197,3.7142857142857144
8529106,5,B008NA3I26,"Phoebe Cates is Great, typical 80's love movie,  I would enjoy watching Phoebe in a commercial, she has allways been a favorite actress of mine. A  must have for her fans. Thank you.",1365638400,2,182,4.484848484848484
8529107,5,B008NA3I26,"This is a fun movie to watch,very soapy 80's feel to it. Phoebe Cates(Fast Tmes..,Lace,Gremlins) does a good job as the young sister who has an affair with her sisters boyfriend played by Ted Wass(Soap,Blossom,Sheena).It has that guilty pleasure of over dramatic,that soaps of that time get,the tv film is not a masterpiece,its just a guilty fun pleasure. Pamela Bellwood(Dynasty) plays the older sister.",1362787200,5,404,5.328125
8529108,3,B008NA3I26,"For fans of one of the cutest actresses ever caught on film, this is an excellent example of the work of Phoebe Cates. For those looking for something in addition, not so much.",1360540800,4,176,4.363636363636363
8529109,2,B008NA3I26,"The reason this film is ""unrated"" is because it is MADE-FOR-TV... and that's 1983 TV.  IF your'e looking for an ""after school special"" movie or a ""lifetime"" movie before there was Lifetime.. this is it. Otherwise PASS.",1360022400,9,218,4.891891891891892
