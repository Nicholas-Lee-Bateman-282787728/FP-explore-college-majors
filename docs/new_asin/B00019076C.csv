8008317,4,B00019076C,"Okay if you don't all ready have both movies this isn't a bad deal. But if you can wait a little while I would bet this set will drop to twenty dollars. Either way, fans of Jack Black will love them both, he after all is 90 percent of the comedy in each one. School of Rock is great. When Jack pretends to be a substitute teacher at a private school he teaches a lesson about music those students will never forget. Orange County may not be as good but it still fairly funny thanks to Jack Black and some cameos by some other comedians. Get them!",1078099200,,546,4.11214953271028
