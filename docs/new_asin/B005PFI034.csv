8482475,1,B005PFI034,SAVE your money.  Very poor quality.  He talked to his students like they were beginner turners.  Beginner turners would not be interested in this type of turning to start out with. The last DVD (which is reputition of the first 2) he forgot to turn on his mic so you have to read the comments.  The main thing I wanted to see (the reason I bought it) he never showed how to cut them. His work is Beautiful work and he is a wonderful artist but this DVD didn't do his talent any justice.,1413849600,2,487,4.148936170212766
