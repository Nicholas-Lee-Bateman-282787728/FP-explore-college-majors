3974538,5,B002RNOS4M,"I can't say much more than ""I LOVE THIS SHOW"".  With witty dialog, clever plots, beautiful photography and possibly the hottest female that ever lived as a co-star you can't go wrong. This show was the primary reason I bought a VCR, a DVD player and Amazon Instant Video -though with the latter I had to wait patiently for a year or two. The only thing better than this is Season 4 of ""The Avengers""  - the black & white season with Diana Rigg which is the best television drama series ever filmed. (I'm still waiting patiently for that one).

I should also add that at $19.00 the price is tremendous. I paid more than that for each of the four  A&E DVD sets that made up this season so I was expecting  to pay in the mid $30 range.

Yes, it's THAT good.",1405209600,19,754,4.201388888888889
3974539,5,B002RNOS4M,I won't review the Avengers. It's great and odds are if you're looking for it then you already know it's great. I do want to let you know that finally there are subtitles. It really does have the subtitle option on Instant Video.,1404345600,17,229,4.348837209302325
3974540,5,B002RNOS4M,This is a fun look at old well written 60's British Spy tv. It is interesting to see some of the wild ideas they had and knowing now that today science has developed some of those into reality.,1403308800,2,193,4.105263157894737
3974541,5,B002RNOS4M,"I purchased what I believed would be the ENTIRE season #5 in HD. All well and good, but what happened to episode #18. Death's Door? It shows up that I can purchase it for $1.99.

3974542,5,B002RNOS4M,Would like to see the earlier seasons that are in black & white. The earlier sessions after rally good to watch.,1402099200,,112,4.380952380952381

3974544,4,B002RNOS4M,"We streamed ""From Venus with Love"" to show the young'uns *why* style, good manners and an umbrella are a Kingman's weapons of choice.  The Avengers dialog is witty, the plots enjoyably silly, and their fighting skills make William Shatner look like a Navy Seal... but their style is unbeatable.  I'm usually unimpressed by fasion but surely Mrs Peel wore a different outfit in every scene (and sometimes I think between cuts.in the same scene) and each one was a period classic.  Likewise Mr. Steed.  A pleasure to watch.",1504396800,,521,4.886363636363637

3974547,5,B002RNOS4M,"Have always loved this series. It's made as most 70's British ""stylized"" secret agent themed programs were ; The Saint included. The Prisoner was a little more intense ( but that seemed to be Patrick's McNee's style) but still stylized in design",1486252800,,245,4.857142857142857

3974549,5,B002RNOS4M,"Classic episode that strikes the right notes of witty, dry British humor and creepy menace. Steed suffers an apparent accident which prevents him from escorting Emma Peel to a mysterious mansion, ostensibly to lecture on an article on bridge playing she wrote. Stand out guest stars include actors Peter Jeffrey, Ronald Lacey, and Sally Nesbitt as a trio of villains out to bewilder Mrs. Peel before sealing her doom.",1484438400,,417,5.057971014492754

3974552,5,B002RNOS4M,"This witty and exciting adventure series from the 1960s is now easy and inexpensive to view. In 1972, an interviewer described Ms. Rigg as the most desirable woman he had ever met. Need I say more?",1481846400,,197,4.5

3974556,5,B002RNOS4M,So happy this is still available. My favorite UK childhood TV series.,1478649600,,69,4.833333333333333
3974557,5,B002RNOS4M,"My complaint with this bluray is that instead of so many episodes  put on three discs, that the release would have more discs with fewer episodes.
Season 5 is the high point of The Avengers series. This season ranks as one of television's all time best (along with The Prisoner, Secret Agent/Danger Man, Monty Python, Fawlty Towers, I Love Lucy, Andy Griffith, Twin Peaks, Game of Thrones, The Wire, etc.). The switch to color and catering to the American tv market, resulted in the series upping it's game. The interplay between Steed and Mrs. Peel is more relaxed with more humour and affection. The storylines are more imaginative, adventurous and well-written. The introduction of color allows for more innovation and some episodes take on a more cartoon approach that rivals Batman in the US.
In retrospect, it's really a shame the producers did not make more of an effort to retain Diana Rigg for Season 6. After Season 5, the series really took a nosedive, which obviously was due in large part to the loss of Emma Peel, but also to weaker storylines and the totally unfortunate misjudgment to add The Mother character.",1477180800,4,1126,4.83419689119171
3974558,5,B002RNOS4M,"This is the season that went colour. The best word to describe it is delicious. Off-beat, witty, with the usual cast of bizarre characters, ""The Avengers"" is such a great look back at Mrs. Peel's mod era vs Steed's old-English.

This is a boxed set of 7 discs in four slim cases,Mono 2.0 Audio,no subtitles.
This release has the same EXCELLENT quality as the Series 6 (Tara King) collection by OPTIMUM. Very professional HD restoration and EXQUISITE video quality.
 Sound quality is evenly consistent but could be higher fidelity.
There are 24 color episodes here,all of Diana Rigg's EXCEPT The Forget Me Knot, Emma Peel's emotional farewell and introduction for Tara King (Linda Thorson). This episode is included with the Series 6 collection.
There are MANY WORTHWHILE extras including short video commentaries for every episode by the late and delightful Patrick Macnee (1922-2015) and others,miscellaneous factoids,German TV interview with Macnee & Rigg,ATV newsreel footage featuring Diana Rigg,an AVENGERS retrospective hosted by Patrick Macnee (not restored),hundreds of photos and more!
I love the AVENGERS because it is a Time Capsule for the sweetness of its time and the OPTIMUM collections are valuable documents for it.

The production values were very good on a limited budget. The stories were very creative. The repoire between the leads was very believable. I met Mr. MacNee many years later and he was great.

The DVDs arrived in an envelope with no packing slip. I decided to play one episode before giving away my old set of season 5. Good thing I did. IT DOESN'T PLAY!!!  I was careful to order the 3 disc set, not the 7 disc set with the warning that it's not playable in USA. When I put the disc in it buffered a bit longer than normal, then the piracy disclaimer appeared, then the Lionsgate branding, then the menu screen. When I clicked ""Season 5"" with my Samsung Blu-Ray remote, nothing happened. At first I thought it was the remote, so I checked the batteries. Again nothing. I took the disk out, checked for flaws, none, tried again, nothing. I then tried disc 2 - nothing. I put a completely different TV show  disc in the player & it played beautifully. I'm just sick. I'll try returning the set to Amazon -have no idea what the problem is or if I buy one from someplace else if I'll have a different result. *If anyone reading this has any ideas or suggestions please let me know.",1441411200,,1151,4.275229357798165

The picture quality and sound is top notch and it is such a joy to revisit these characters looking and sounding so good.  I was hesitant to get this set as I already had the VHS and the DVD sets, but I am glad I did as the quality of these episodes is so sharp and clear it is almost like watching them for the first time.

The were ""agents"" working for an unidentified department of British Defense (or is it Defence?). Anyway, this was science fiction with the two chasing people that disappeared, traveled in time and were even zapped by the planet Venus.  (You have to see it.)
John Steed (Patrick Macnee) was always the proper British gentleman who did not carry a gun. On the other hand Mrs. Peel (Diana Rigg) was a beautiful woman who could well take care of herself; either with her hands or her gun.
I wouldn't miss an episode. Certainly the stories (actually the entire series) is dated to the 60's. Like I said, a blast from the past!",1427760000,,762,4.547445255474453

3974642,5,B002RNOS4M,"This is season five of the quirky upbeat espionage sci-fi show called The Avengers from 1966 which features the first year the series was shot in colour. This was Diana Rigg's (Emma Peel) second year with the series playing along side Patrick Macnee (John Steed) who had been with the show since 1961.

The episodes have been nicely remastered with the images cleaned up of the dirt and dust that was found on the dvds. This was a great upgrade from my dvds. I look forward to the rest of the series being remastered onto blu-ray.",1421366400,8,530,4.520833333333333
3974643,3,B002RNOS4M,"On the one hand, this is a botched issue of the series. On the other, it's better than the previous versions.

Yes, they crammed 25 episodes onto 3 discs and the bitrate is lower. On the other hand, the UK release of series 4 (due out early 2015) is, once converted to US Dollars, three times the price. It may be cramped but it's also only $30-ish for the whole series plus a bonus episode. Bonus episode? Yes, they have included The Forget-Me-Knot, which was the first episode of series six, during which Mrs. Peel handed the baton to Tara King. That's a nice bonus. So this is certainly good value.

A few years ago, Studio Canal remastered series 4, 5 and 6 and issued them on DVD in France and the UK. I have the DVD set of series 4 from the UK. The picture quality was significantly improved. In the US, even though the series were eventually reissued with the new style covers (which match the style of this BD cover), the new, remastered audio and video was not used. What this means is that upgrading from the US DVD of series 5 to this version, you will see a significant improvement. It's not due to the Blu Ray. I caught very few cases where the added resolution helped - some detail was evident  in hair, for example. The occasional outside shoot looks great, but the studio bound material, which makes up most of the body of the show, does not particularly benefit. A far cry from the stunning picture BluRay afforded The Prisoner, but that had fewer sets (so they could be better dressed) and more location shooting.

If you have the recent UK DVD of this series, forget the upgrade. You'll be disappointed. If you own the previous US DVD release, this IS an improvement. For those outside of the US, this is a Region A release and won't work for you. Sorry, UK fans who were hoping to pick up the series in HD for 20, you'll have to buy the expensive local version.

A few reviewers have noted the sound. It is rather quiet (and I'm playing it through a home cinema with a couple of floor-standing front speakers) and the peaks (music) are jarringly louder than the quiets (much of the dialogue). It has been noted that there appears to be a PAL speedup of 4% to the audio. I have trouble hearing it, coming from a country where this is normal, but I can believe it is there because I can see the evidence in the picture.

See, back in the 60's, there was no easy conversion between the US and UK TV systems. Companies preparing a program for both countries would record and edit on film, then let the locals broadcast the film to their TV networks, and avoid the issue entirely. This means it should be entirely possible to take the film and flag it a 24fps for BluRay, avoiding any colour/transmission system settings, and give us the best, most accurate version of the program yet.

My guess is that Studio Canal created masters for PAL, Region 2 DVD. This would suffer from the PAL speedup issue, converting 24fps video to 25fps. These converted masters were handed to Lionsgate, and they've authored the BluRay from these, not the original film. As already noted, the audio speedup is present. Most people won't have seen the video issues, because they'll be less evident on computer screens and LCD TVs. I watched this on a 51"" Samsung Plasma TV, and the reasons I went for plasma are (a) better colour reproduction, and (b)no motion blurring during motion. Most LCDs do suffer with motion blurring, so the presence of any onscreen would not be noteworthy. On a plasma, the motion blurring present on this BluRay stands out a mile, and it shouldn't be there. The most obvious cause would be the conversion from 25fps to either 24fps or 30fps required to create a US BluRay.

PRO:
* Approx. $30 is a bargain for 25 hour-long TV episodes
* Picture quality is vastly improved from the US DVD releases
CON:
* Not significantly better than the recent UK remastered DVDs
* Evidence of a botched standards conversion
* No extras

I'm rating this three stars for the low price and improvement over the US DVDs. If it was selling for over $100, like the UK Blu Rays, it would be heading for a one star.",1420416000,7,4115,4.476

The sound, however, has been rechanneled to a 5.1 ""stereo"" output with no option for original broadcast mono. The title music now sounds like it's coming from the back of a huge hall, as well as sounding terribly thin. The older DVD soundtrack was robust.

Playing games with the soundtrack is no more enjoyable now than it was for fans of 1930s / 1940s music when the major companies reissued the tracks on LPs and electronically rechanneled the sound for ""stereo.""

3974660,4,B002RNOS4M,"This classic, witty spy series arrived in color with the fifth season (which is why Lion's Gate has chosen to release season five ahead of others including season four where the series finally appeared in America). The new Blu-ray release from Lion's Gate is a mixed bag for a variety of reasons but still beats the DVD's previously issued hands down; the colors are fairly vivid throughout giving the primary colors some pop in high definition.

There are a number of issues with this set however including the amount of episodes per disc. If Lion's Gate had put these on four discs it would have given the film a bit of breathing room improving detail by allowing a more robust bit rate (the bit rate averages between 10-20 depending on the episode). It also wouldn't have necessitated the use of high frequency filtering which often times removes additional film grain. Both of these are issues BUT most fans won't notice this as the detail does improve on the DVDs and the episodes have been cleaned up signficantly. Since these episodes are presented in their original aspect ratio we have the episodes presented with pillar boxes on both sides which, again, allows for a bit more breathing room in terms of bit rate for the series.

Because of the anemic bit rate Lion's Gate chose not to include either a lossless audio presentation (it's Dolby Digital 5.1)or the original mono soundtrack that was prepared for the show. It's a pity that neither optionw as offered for the series. During the 5.1 conversion it appears that the audio was pitched up (perhaps they used the first UK set as a reference where there was a PAL 4% speed up on the dialog).

An additional disc might have raised the price of this by about $5 so, if the price point was the big concern here, the series would still have sold well with a better presentation AND some extra room for the extras that were prepared for the restored DVDs overseas. We don't get any special features with this set which is frustrating because there are special features offered on the previous DVDs including a documentaries, featurettes and audio commentary tracks. It's rather bizarre given that these were already produced that Lion's Gate and A&E elected NOT to include them (or even present the docs and featurettes in SD). It's a puzzling move given that other cult series like ""The Prisoner"" and ""Space:1999"" BOTH  were loaded with special features in additional to being spread across more discs for a superior A/V presentation.

If you're displeased with the lack of special features, the lower image quality because of packing so many episodes per disc, you should write and let Lion's Gate know. Perhaps we will also see a correction for the pitched up dialog (all of which I think it doubtful that they will be fixed) as well but, either way, this is a missed opportunity to produce a terrific set. For those interested in only the series and willing to accept some of the limitations of the image quality, this set will do just fine. For those that are disappointed, you may want to wait and see if the UK release is Region Free (I doubt it) or pick up a multi region Blu-ray player for the series.

I'm cautiously recommending this set.",1417392000,4,3208,4.709447415329768

3974665,5,B002RNOS4M,"Update: Well, it's been almost a year since I wrote this review. Still no hint of further releases. What gives?

Despite the large number of episodes per disc, this looks fantastic. Outstanding clarity and color. I don't really notice the supposed ""PAL speed issue"". Maybe it's there, but I'm not hearing it. I've got the original DVDs (those two-packs) and if I did a comparison maybe I'd notice. The bottom line is that this is a surprisingly good deal. I've been waiting YEARS for this. I hope further seasons will be forthcoming. I love the black and white stuff. Let's have season 4, please. Of course, a nice big commemorative package would be nice, with everything available included. I'd buy it in a heartbeat.
I will add that there are some contrast issues that could have been addressed. Most of it looks fine. One example would be the opening; Steed's bowler should be nice and dark. It's a middle gray. I originally watched this on the US TV broadcast; bad reception, ghosting, etc. I recently found some old Polaroids I took of the screen, back in the day (yes, I was obsessed with the show).

3974667,3,B002RNOS4M,"It's interesting, but unfortunate, how this series has to be remastered and otherwise corrected, again and again, and still they don't quite get everything right. I am one of those who bought the Emma Peel Megaset last year in the terrible cases that scratched all of the discs, and I ultimately got the replacement case version which was much easier to deal with and in which none of the discs were loose or scratched.

Anyway, this blu-ray set's picture is quite sharp. I have been watching these via a Blu-ray player on my 55-inch high-definition TV, and comparing against the 2013 Emma Peel Megaset DVDs. And, there is simply NO comparison-- these Blu-rays are vastly superior, and I mean the difference is night and day. They are miles apart as to picture quality.

These BR discs also have English subtitles.

Now, the first problem I see, and it may be what others are calling a contrast issue, but I would just say the picture is overall a bit too saturated with white. For some of the actors, the fleshtones look a little too white, the same problem is even on backgrounds and on things like the red roses at the opening of the show-- the RED roses look a little too white, also. On the other hand, the fleshtones of a number of the guest actors look incredibly realistic and perfect, despite this, so I think it's a scene-by-scene problem, varying from episode to episode, too; but for the most part, most of the scenes are too white. On the other hand, it may merely be that the blu-ray sharpness and quality is so excellent that it is revealing the differences in each person's make-up, something that I notice on the nightly news shows that I watch currently. When one person's fleshtones look perfect on the same show as another person's fleshtones who is sitting right next to him or her, look terrible, what we are seeing is differences in the make-up that has been applied to their faces!

The other problem with these Blu-rays, unfortunately, is what many others have noticed, and that is, the voices are just a little bit too high, or a little bit too fast, in some episodes. I might not have noticed it except that I was alerted to it in the reviews of others, and certainly Steed and Mrs. Peel do not sound quite as we remember them nor quite as correct as in the Emma Peel Megaset. They're a little too high; both have deeper voices in actuality and on the DVDs. Yet, lip movement and audio are perfectly in sync on the blu-rays.

I jumped ahead to episode 5, The Bird Who Knew Too Much, because another reviewer commented how that picture was wobbling throughout, plus had ""overlap,"" but I did NOT see either at all except for about 1 second of wobble in the opening credits to that episode. Otherwise, not at all, nor was there any wobble or overlap in episode 6, in which the other reviewer said these two issues occurred at times as well. However, episode 5 does not look as pretty as episode 1, From Venus With Love, or episode 6, The Winged Avenger, as the color is not nearly as vivid, and the picture in episode 5 is so darned white-ish. So, based on three episodes on the first disc, my review is that things re: color and contrast are sort of mixed.

However, let's clear up one other thing, and that concerns the masters used, or perhaps the cleanup process. The picture on these Blu-rays is extremely clean, in ALL scenes. I have detected no dirt at all, no artifacts at all, nothing old-looking about the film, not in one single frame. So, perhaps these were made from the so-called better British masters that were used to make the ""remastered"" British DVD set that others here like. However, I have not seen that British DVD set. All I know is that these blu-rays do not look old or dirty or with white specks or artifacts, in any way; every bit of every frame is incredibly clean and flawless, apart from the over-whiteness/over-contrast. The picture is always perfectly stable, too.

Again, on the most basic level, these Blu-rays are simply excellent, and far superior, when compared with last year's Emma Peel Megaset, when both are played on my high-definition TV on my Blu-ray player. The Blu-rays are much sharper and MUCH prettier overall; only the DVDs show artifacts and dirt, and thus age. However, the DVDs do have the voices at the correct speed-- unlike these Blu-rays.

The bitrate principally varies between 7.0 and 18.5 Mbps, though often is outside of this range on both ends. It is mostly between 10.0 and 14.5 Mbps. In some of the prettiest, sharpest, and most colorful scenes, the bitrate is as low as 6 or 7 Mbps, so the figure does not necessarily correlate with the picture quality you are seeing at the moment.

I went and did a comparison of episode number 2, The Fear Merchants, between the Emma Peel Megaset DVD and this blu-ray, and in this case, the blu-ray picture was not so much better than the DVD, but in fact only slightly better on my HDTV. The DVD looked quite sharp and good, other than the fact that it had a lot of artifacts and dirt, as compared with the clean and newer-looking picture of the Blu-ray. However, the Blu-ray running time was 28 seconds longer, at 51:50, vs. 51:22 for the same episode on the DVD. I wonder if this is a trend throughout the two sets!  By the way, I have no idea what footage is missing from the DVD episode vs the blu-ray episode. Just FYI.

My first thought would be to give this Blu-ray set 5 stars, for how good the picture is overall, esp. vs. the DVDs, despite the high level of contrast/white in it. It is just so darned sharp and clean. The problem is, I find the voice speed-up simply unacceptable, and Steed, in particular, had such a memorable voice. In my opinion, there can be no good excuse for why this defect exists. So, I have to dock this set more than 1 star for a substantial, inexcusable defect, hence why it gets 3 stars.

The typical blue plastic case that it comes in is fine quality, no complaints there, but, as I am somewhat of a perfectionist, at least as to hearing the voices as they should sound, I would be one who would want the studio to correct the voices, and I would want a free exchange to a newer, corrected blu-ray set from this one. Fix the contrast while they're at it . . .

If you are not a perfectionist concerning the voices, I don't think the extra whiteness/contrast issue in the picture will bother you. The picture is bright, the colors are usually vivid, and it is very focused and sharp, plus clean/free of age. Some scenes will astound you in this respect.

Enjoy!",1415923200,6,6527,4.506339814032121
3974668,5,B002RNOS4M,"Classic 60's cult British Spy-Fi TV series gets the five-star treatment it deserves on Blu-ray with exceptionally remastered Hi-Def quality.  All 25 episodes of season 5 are here in their original 1.33:1 aspect ratio and are ""pillarboxed"" to preserve their original framing.  The transfers look beautiful with good contrast and vibrant saturation showcasing the color episodes of the series.  The 5.1 sound mix is very good for a show that was originally mixed in mono with noticeable rear-channel ambiance on music, especially during the titular iconic title-sequence.  The Avengers have never looked or sounded better, in my opinion.  There are no extras like documentaries or episodic promos, unfortunately.

Not time compressed for syndication copies, because the running times are good, but it makes Steed sound like a woman!  I guess I just get frustrated when something I love goes through multiple editions and nothing is ever quite right.  For the past DVD sets, it was the missing ""Avengers in Color"" title card on all but usually one of the episodes on a disc.  This time we get the title cards on all of the eps, but the music cue for the card is missing!  Add to that the pitched voices and the contrast issue and we're not quite right again.

Speaking of the UK remastered dvds...they were plagued with audio pitch problems, eventually fixed by the manufacturer. Coincidentally or not, that's also the case here. The video and runtime are the correct film speed, but the audio pitch is equivalent to the PAL format. If you're familiar with the actors or the Ntsc release, you will notice an occasional oddness to their voices here. I've returned them for a refund, and will re-purchase if they ever fix the problem. Would also be nice if they included the regular mono audio instead of only 5.1, for we who don't have a home theater.
FYI, on at least one episode the audio is sometimes out of sync (noticeable when actors are talking), specifically ""Mission...Highly Improbable.""
Comments about the audio pitch can be found on blu-ray forum.

3974673,4,B002RNOS4M,"One of the greatest TV shows ever (thanks to season 5) is finally available on Blu-Ray. The HD picture on this Blu-Ray season set appears much more detailed than in the previous DVD set, but the picture contrast is somewhat tampered by grayish blacks. This is probably due to over-compression (8-9 episodes per disc sized at 5Gb per episode). I wish all 25 episodes had been spread over six discs instead of three. As a result, the issue of contrast knocks the rating of this product down by one star.

All in all, this is still a worthy purchase. John Steed and Emma Peel have never looked better. This set is recommended for fans and newcomers alike - season 5 is actually a great entry point for newcomers to discover this wonderful show.",1415664000,5,741,4.571428571428571
3974674,5,B002RNOS4M,"Shown in Great Britain for more than five years (debuting in 1961) before it caught on in America, The Avengers is a secret-agent thriller that almost bests James Bond. Jonathan Steed - an urbane, proper gentleman spy - and adventurous citizen Emma Peel repeatedly saved the world from diabolical schemes plotted by equally diabolical evil-doers (among them robots and man-eating monsters). The 3-disc Blu-ray release of The Avengers: Season 5 is presented in 1080p at 4x3 full screen format with DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround. English SDH subtitles are included. I was worry that 25 episodes on 3 disc would not add to good picture quality but I might say I was very impress with this set. The colors are solid and the image very sharp.

Episodes include:

  01. From Venus with Love
  02. The Fear Merchants
  03. Escape in Time
  04. The See-Through Man
  05. The Bird Who Knew Too Much
  06. The Winged Avenger
  07. The Living Dead
  08. The Hidden Tiger
  09. The Correct Way to Kill
  10. Never, Never Say Die
  11. Epic
  12. The Superlative Seven
  13. A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Station
  14. Something Nasty in the Nursery
  15. The Joker
  16. Who's Who?
  17. Return of the Cybernauts
  18. Death's Door

  20. Dead Man's Treasure
  21. You Have Just Been Murdered
  22. The Positive-Negative Man
  23. Murdersville
  24. Mission: Highly Improbable

3974684,3,B002RNOS4M,"Although we are still months away from the release of Blu-Ray version, there are a few clues present where opinions can be formed about the nature of this particular product.

There is little doubt that Season 5 is one of the most popular and for many their personal favorite. The imaginative stories, beautiful cinematography and the incredible chemistry between Patrick MacNee and Diana Rigg makes this particular season one for the ages. For those who have not collected ""The Avengers"" before, then this is an excellent place to start.

However, despite the ""Digital HD"" on the cover, there is actually no indication that this version will augment the original prints. When you consider that A & E is behind this version and the relatively low initial price of $20, all the indications are that the overall quality will not be any better than any of the other A & E releases of The Avengers"" over the past several years. Otherwise, I believe that the price would be higher and there would be far more emphasis on using new prints. Going from DVD to Blu-Ray does not improve the quality if the prints they use are the same as before.

Therefore, unless more information is released about the quality, I see no reason for anyone who currently owns the A & E versions to purchase this one. Although, the disc count is drastically reduced since Blu-Ray can hold considerably more than standard DVDs, but that is the only advantage I can see.

UPDATE: At the time I wrote this review, I was unaware that iTunes carried Season 5 of ""The Avengers"" in HD quality from Studio Canal which also Lionsgate and A & E. After making a side-by-side comparison with the recently re-released ""Complete Emma Peel"" set, it is fair to say that the iTunes versions are brighter and have fewer imperfections. So, if this new release is of similar to what is seen on iTunes, then it will be an upgrade. However, it should be noted that the iTunes versions are clearly not digital restorations as imperfections such as scratches and blotches still exist.",1409270400,28,2032,4.731638418079096

Please note though, that if anyone who's reading this review feels the same way as I do, that only a handful of episodes from Series 1 have survived the ravages of time, so they will most likely add the surviving Series 1 episodes into the Series 2 set, much like they did for the Region 2 (UK) version.
