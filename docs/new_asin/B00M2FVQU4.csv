8669878,4,B00M2FVQU4,"I wanted to find some 'old' T & J cartoons, and found this for sale. It is not starring the cat and mouse characters we know as Tom & Jerry, it is, in fact, very old (early thirties) Van Bueren studio cartoons, featuring their version of a Mutt & Jeff pair of fellows called Tom & Jerry.  Van Bueren studios went kablooey in the late thirties when RKO stopped buying their cartoons in favor of some new-fangled mouse cartoons named Mickey.  Still and all an enjoyable slice of life from the early to mid thirties.",1199664000,6,513,4.389473684210526
