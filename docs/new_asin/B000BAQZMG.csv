2410076,5,B000BAQZMG,"I think this is a great DVD. The transition from novice exercises to those of a proficient practitioner, is very quick and you can be left in the dust slightly by Dr. Yang as he incorporates the entire body and breathing patterns into what is seemingly a simple hand motion.
From a novice perspective, this DVD will take a year or even two to fully complete and a lifetime to master.

Having a partner at home who is also willing to learn is a huge help as a lot of the exercises, and the very nature of pushing hands, is for two people. In saying that there are a lot of solo exercises that move well beyond novice level very quickly, not too fast as to overwhelm you, more fast enough to make you realise how much mental effort is required to co-ordinate the entire body as one in a rhythmic motion. You then must move past that, so you don't have to think about it so much, more that it becomes natural, so you can concentrate on your partner.

Dr. Yang is a great teacher, and with so many DVD's on the many different aspects of Taijiquan, even small town, or country people who may not have a local instructor or school they can go to, can learn from a true master.",1303948800,5,1170,4.242152466367713
2410077,5,B000BAQZMG,"Although one of my good friends and training partners studies the Chinese martial arts and owns much of Dr. Yang's library, Taiji Pushing Hands 1 & 2 was my first direct exposure to this renowned instructor, and let me just say that I was utterly impressed.  The supple and smooth, yet powerful and explosive, movements of his body are a sight to behold.  Even more impressive is the fact that he can do them all while standing on the sides of bricks.  Any martial artist, no matter what his or her style, would be happy to have this type of body control in his/her toolbox.

And really, that is what makes this video so great - the content is really quite style neutral.  Sure, its primary audience is taiji practitioners.  However, anyone who watches this video with an open mind is going to find many skills, drills, and methods that will mold seamlessly into his/her style of choice.  In fact, while watching the video, I was continually finding myself thinking things such as, ""Oh, that looks like blank technique from so-and-so kata.""  In addition, Dr. Yang explains all of the movements in such a way that even someone with no prior exposure to pushing hands can follow along reasonably well.  Really, the only place where the exposition is inadequate is during the Taiji Ball Qigong exercises at the beginning of Course 2.  Although the viewer is referred to a separate video that specifically discusses these movements, some small amount of discussion would have been useful to fit them into the larger picture.  However, this is only a minor issue and does nothing to detract from the way in which the rest of the material is presented.

Furthermore, not only are the practices in this video well explained, they are also quite practical.  Anyone who thinks that taiji is simply some form of relaxing ""New Age""-y exercise that has no relevance to self-defense needs only to watch this video to see the fallacy of his or her argument.  Not only does Dr. Yang give the viewer numerous pushing hands drills to practice either solo or with a partner, he also frequently demonstrates how the flowing movements from the drills can blend directly into a variety of joint locks and takedowns.  Plus, he even shows a couple of different ways that a heavy bag/sand bag can be used to practice the pushing hands techniques.  Watching the video, it is clear why pushing/sticking hands-type drills were once a central part to many different martial arts.  Moreover, it is a great motivator for reintroducing them into styles where their practice has been neglected.

Finally, unlike many martial arts videos, the production values on this DVD are quite solid.  The picture is clear, and aside from a few sound pops here and there, the audio is good.  Moreover, the menus are easy to navigate and allow the viewer to go directly to the specific drills he or she wants to practice.  Overall, I give this video top marks and look forward to watching other Dr. Yang productions.",1211932800,4,2971,4.763671875
2410078,5,B000BAQZMG,"This DVD combines two VHS tapes that were titled Taiji Pushing Hands 1 and Taiji Pushing Hands 2.  I own both of the VHS tapes, having purchased them when they were first released.  As I've mentioned in other reviews, I have always been satisfied after purchasing martial arts DVDs of material that I already had previously purchased in the VHS format.  Besides the advantages of easy access when using a DVD, Dr. Yang, Jwing Ming usually includes a fair amount of new material when he re-releases a product on DVD.

The production quality is excellent as always, and I feel this is one of the few videos available by anyone that actually gives sound instruction in how to learn and practice Taijiquan pushing hands.  I own a number of different pushing hands videos by various teachers.  Unfortunately, they require a high level of skill in order to benefit from the material as the tapes either are not in English or use limited English to teach the concepts.  Many of the tapes available from other teachers do not cover the material as thoroughly as does Dr. Yang.

Taijiquan pushing hands is a critical skill to develop for anyone that is serious in their study of Taijiquan.  It is, I hate to say impossible, but let's face reality, there is no way a person can reach their potential in the application of Taijiquan techniques unless time is spent doing pushing hands with a variety of practitioners.  OK, so you and a couple of buddies toss each other around in kind of free for all haphazard method (or lack of).  That is not pushing hands, and anyone not learning proper methods in pushing hands can only reach a low level of skill.

Learn the techniques and pushing hands routines on this video, practice often with everyone that is willing, and your skill will greatly increase.  As skill increases, it becomes possible to truly ""win"" in pushing hands while being very conservative with your energy.  Watching someone ""win"" at pushing hands while overpowering the other person is not as impressive as seeing someone with high skill seemingly control the other person while staying centered, calm and using very efficient techniques.  This kind of skill comes from long hours of practice with live persons and using correct techniques, like the ones taught on this video.

The video covers the following material, with both courses available on the DVD:

  Course 1

Structure of Pushing Hands

Basic Taiji Symbol Sticking Hands

Solo Single Pushing Hands

Partner Single Pushing Hands

Partner Double Pushing Hands

  Course 2

Basic Yin/Yang Taiji Ball Qigong

Three Basic Jins

Moving Taiji Symbol Sticking Hands

International Stationary Double Pushing Hand Routine

International Moving Double Pushing Hands Routine

Dr. Yang personally demonstrates the majority of the material.  He then uses students of varying levels of skill to demonstrate the techniques further.  It is always beneficial to the student when they are able to view various levels of skill when learning new movements.  If one only sees correctly done moves, how will a student be able to differentiate between correct moves and moves that violate the principles of Taijiquan.  Just as one must know and understand the yin and the yang when practicing Taijiquan, one must also know and understand what is correct practice and what is not.

Very few teachers have passed onto the general public information concerning how to use the yin yang diagram in their forms and in their applications (push hands).  Jou, Tsung Hwa touched briefly on the subject in his book ""The Tao of Taijiquan"".  In his book he talks about using the yin yang diagram to practice the various types of kicks found in the form.  Additionally, he shares some thoughts about the hand positions, phases of the moon and using the yin yang diagram.

Why am I not surprised that Dr. Yang is the first martial artist to release this information on video (to the best of my knowledge).  Dr. Yang and his production staff have certainly set the standard for the way martial arts videos should be produced.",1163635200,20,4053,4.898529411764706
2410079,5,B000BAQZMG,"I've always wondered what Push Hands was - this video explains that in great detail and teaches how to learn in a very gradual manner. I got my copy last week (...)

Im glad I finally found this DVD, because it shows exactly what I was looking for - I once saw two women 'pushing hands' in the park and was fascinated, but have never found a video on the subject until now.
