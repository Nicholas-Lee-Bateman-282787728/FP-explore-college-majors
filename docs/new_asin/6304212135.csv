817113,5,6304212135,"Farewell My Lovely, 1944 film

This is the film version of Raymond Chandler's ""Farewell, My Lovely"". It opens with Philip Marlowe being questioned by police detectives. It started when Marlowe was hired by Mike Malloy to look for an old girlfriend. Malloy had been away for years. Marlowe finds a dead end. Then a stranger hires Marlowe to ransom stolen jewelry. Marlowe is sapped, his client Marriott cannot speak. The police question him but Marlowe knows little. Then a reporter visits him to ask questions but Marlowe figures out the answers. Next Marlowe is hired by Mrs. Helen Grayle, the woman whose necklace was stolen. Malloy takes Marlowe to meet a guy; Jules Amthor is very interested in that necklace. They try to get information from Marlowe. [There are some novel special effects here.]

Marlowe continues in his quest for the truth. Ann Grayle hates her stepmother. Mr. Grayle was the owner of Marriott's apartment, so the police questioned him. Helen Grayle explains how Amthor worked: he talked to people, gained their confidence and their secrets, and used this information for blackmail. But Helen reveals her own character to Marlowe. When Marlowe returns to Amthor's office he finds Amthor won't speak to anyone. So now Marlowe begins to put the pieces together and figure out what the solution is, and returns to the beach house. There is a confrontation between the main characters that brings and ending to this story.

You will note how the film varies from the novel, but not extensively. The actions of Mr. and Mrs. Grayle seem more correct than the story in the novel. Chandler was a former oil company executive and knew about the lives and scandals of the super rich. The story of a rich old man marrying a young ""show girl"" could have been ripped from the headlines, then or now. [This story of a search for a missing person seems to echo ""The Big Sleep"".]",1412208000,,1887,4.817901234567901

817188,3,6304212135,"MURDER MY SWEET, 1944.  This classic black and white film noir, starring Dick Powell and Claire Trevor, and many others, has been acclaimed by critics, and is considered widely influential. The crime drama captures the sharp wit and style of Raymond Chandler's underlying novel FAREWELL MY LOVELY, about his famed gumshoe Philip Marlowe.  The private detective is searching for a missing moll, Velma, whom her just-released- from-prison petty crook boyfriend Moose Malloy hasn't seen  in eight years.  Upon the classic thrillers release, it was renamed so American filmgoers wouldnt confuse it with a Powell musical; hed spent years making listless musicals before this.  But this mystery reinvigorated  the actor's career, helping him to shed his choir-boy image. Respected Hollywood director Edward Dmytryk worked from a script by John Paxton.

In this witty and suspenseful Los Angeles-based film, Marlowe is reluctantly hired by Moose (Mike Mazurki, SOME LIKE IT HOT, NIGHTMARE ALLEY) to find Velma Valento, former chanteuse.  The private eye also seems immediately to get involved in the case of a  femme fatale local woman, Mrs. Helen Grayle, as played by Claire Trevor, (STAGECOACH, KEY LARGO) whose $100,000 jade necklace has been stolen and is up for ransom.  Once involved in this apparently second case, he meets Ann Grayle, Helens stepdaughter, as played by Anne Shirley, (STELLA DALLAS, ANNE OF GREEN GABLES). And Jules Amthor, an influential local psychiatrist, as played by Otto Kruger, SABOTEUR, HIGH NOON.  The cases prove to be just one case, and it is tougher than Marlowe expected.  His initially promising enquiries lead to a  web of deceit feeding on bribery, perjury, murder and theft.  Furthermore, no one's motivation is obvious, least of all Marlowe's.

Direction by Edward Dmytryk and cinematography by Harry Wild are fine, giving the film a tight, economical feel, grooming shadows, yet hinting at the powerful underlying chaos and seediness of Los Angeles. Why so many successful films noir, whether black/ white or color, are set there.  The acting is  fine, though I did think Shirley a bit too light weight for her role.  However,  Powells is strong: author Chandler approved of his work. Powell is able to give Marlowe a common touch plus a vulnerable cynicism: his background in romantic musicals seemed to give him access to the deep emotional range needed to play the complex and conflicted Marlowe; his cynicism, his humor, his loyalty to his code. And his resonant wit.

Nevertheless, not to take anything away from this picture, upon a re-viewing, I just couldn't get into it.  Perhaps because I have no film expertise: Im just a person who loves movies.  Perhaps because Robert Mitchum is my favorite Marlowe: I think his bruised tender toughness perfect for the role and own his two outings in it: the London-set THE BIG SLEEP, and the LA-set FAREWELL MY LOVELY. But let us give praise where praise is due.",1409097600,,2947,5.121338912133891

817190,4,6304212135,"My brother told me about this movie years and years ago and I refused to watch it because Dick Powell was playing Phillip Marlowe.  No way did I think it possible that a soft-looking, former song and dance guy from the 30's was going to play one of the best private detectives ever imagined.  Then one night I stumbled upon this movie and I was amazed.  Powell pulls off Marlowe, maybe even better than Humphrey Bogart did and that's saying a lot.  The script for the movie is great with great dialogue and characters that only Raymond Chandler could have created.  The direction, by Edward Dmytryk, is solid and the cinematography works so well with the story that is enhances the story greatly.
And Dick Powell, the former song and dance guy comes across as a smart ass private eye who has a real edge to him.  At times he shows a little vulnerability, but overall he shows he's dealt with low-lifes and society clowns and knows how to handle all of them.  Some times he's a little too much of a smart ass and his mouth and attitude get him in trouble and Powell make it all believable.  He romances the women, but at the same time, he treats them with an indifference that suggests he's out to get what he can when he can and he won't cry about it in the morning.
The cast is rounded out by Mike Mazurki, Claire Trevor and Anne Shirley among others who really bring the story to life.  I love Raymond Chandler's stories and one of the reasons is that he always filled them with great characters and they all spoke with a grittiness and style that few other writers have ever achieved.
I own a copy of this on DVD and am hoping some day they'll come out out with a Blue Ray version with a few extras about the film.  I had previously owned it on VHS and wore the tape out I watched it so much.  I'm not saying this movie is a classic in line with Casablanca or The Third Man, but it's a solid film that is fun to watch time and time again.",1404172800,,1941,4.247282608695652
817191,5,6304212135,"This 1944 adaptation of Raymond Chandler novel is a great classic of film noir, an absolute treasure and an incredibly entertaining watch. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

The film begins with private detective Philip Marlowe (Dick Powell) being contacted by a recently out of prison giant, a certain ""Moose"" Malloy (""Peop'e call me Moose. Cause 'm large""). Played by the hulking wrestler Mike Mazurki, Moose is a pretty scary dude, in a kind of gently smiling low key way - it's not like he is actually trying to intimidate people, they are just scarred sh--tless by him kind of naturally...))) ""Moose"" Malloy hires Marlowe to find his long lost moll, a certain Velma (Claire Trevor) - and from the moment the detective starts the investigation, all the hell breaks loose (even if it happens initially in slow motion).

This film is so successful first because of INCREDIBLE narration in form of Marlowe's own monolog, to which are added equally incredible dialogs - but it is not the only reason. The gallery of characters which appear in this film is also a pure delight, from disarmingly cute ingenue Ann Grayle (Anne Shirley) through the tough cynical cop, Lt. Randall and his two even more cynical wingmen, all way until a certain ""gal who'd take a drink, if she had to knock you down to get the bottle""...)))

There is of course a complicated riddle to be solved (in fact, more than one), people play their cards pretty close to their chests and have more hidden agendas than private detectives have debts and all secrets are revealed only progressively, slowly, with everything being explained only at the end, during a pretty dramatic finale, which some people will not survive...

The tone of this film noir is of course pretty dark but the humour softens it a lot and ultimately (after the great finale) it ends on a rather light-hearted note and in a different way than the much darker and cynical novel - and I for one found this way to end the film a very good decision and really liked it.

Bottom line, this is an EXCELLENT film, to see absolutely! Enjoy!",1390521600,,2098,4.736986301369863
817192,5,6304212135,"Dont worry about the convoluted plot. Just enjoy the vibrant, memorable personalities (the kind we just don't see any more), the excellent camera work, the moody music, and the undercurrent of dark sexualityMarlowes (Dick Powells) attraction to both daughter Ann (Anne Shirley) and wicked stepmother/femme fatale Mrs. Grayle (Claire Trevor) and the ambiguous sexuality of Lindsay Marriott (Douglas Walton) and Jules Amthor (Otto Kruger). Add the hulking presence of Moose Malloy (Mike Mazurki) and the mysterious Velma.

The scene at the Cocoanut Beach Club, the Oriental-themed night club, might be politically incorrect today and make us smirk, but it manages to create the right tawdry atmosphere.

Unfortunately, the energy and suspense wane a bit in the second hour, when Marlowe is drugged and locked up. The femme fatale doesnt rise to the level of Barbara Stanwyck in ""Double Indemnity,"" but a surprise gunshot revives things at the end.

You may find yourself seeking occasions to quote this film:

She was a charming, middle-aged lady with a face like a bucket of mud.

817193,5,6304212135,"Raymond Chandler, the author who penned the Philip Marlowe character, stated that Dick Powell's presentation of Philip Marlowe was the most faithful to his concept of that character. I agree wholeheartedly that Dick Powell is outstanding in this role and superior to Humphrey Bogart's portrayal. Bogart can have Sam Spade, but Powell _is_ Philip Marlowe.

How can you not love Marlowe narration like this?: ""I caught the blackjack right behind my ear. A black pool opened up at my feet. I dived in. It had no bottom."" ""He died in 1940, in the middle of a glass of beer. His wife Jessie finished it for him.""  After seeing this great film noir on TCM, I had to own it.

Two other film noir titles that I've seen recently and feel are also exceptional, both directed by Otto Preminger - ""Laura"" and ""Where the Sidewalk Ends.""

817196,5,6304212135,"Bought this film a few months ago after seeing it on the telly and wanting to see it again. I have watched it a couple of times since I bought it on DVD and each time I thoroughly enjoy it. I really like the Mitchum remake too, but because this is the original and is really genuine film noir, I prefer this one (just!) Why do I, and I suspect so many others, like this movie so much? I expect there are a number of reasons; the plot is complicated but not so that you can't follow it with a bit of brainwork. The script is laconic and funny, and the atmosphere of West Coast America in the 40's is somehow timeless and magical, even though I wasn't born then and am not an American either!

For some reason, what stays in my mind about the movie, is the house on the coast overlooking the sea, and the magnificent seaview (even though in black & white) that is shown. It to me is somehow supremely atmospheric. But of course the film has much more to offer than just this. The acting from all the players for my money is superb, and the whole film is exciting and interesting and keeps me on tenterhooks from beginning to end. Well that's my opinion anyway!

817282,4,6304212135,"Philip Marlowe's in a bit of a bind; his eyes are bandaged and he's being grilled by the police, who insist they tell him what they want to know. When Randall comes in, Marlowe (Dick Powell) agrees to talk, and begins to spin his tale.

It all begins when a big lunk named Moose Malloy (Mike Mazurki) drops into Marlowe's office. He wants to find a gal he used to go with eight years ago--before he was sent away to prison--and he wants Marlowe's help. Marlowe ends up accompanying him to a joint called Florian's. But no one there knows or has heard of Velma, and Moose getting rough doesn't help anything.

Marlowe agrees to help Moose. Although he's big and prone to using his fists, he's also nave, and a bit slow. Marlowe traces the previous owner of the bar and finds his widow listed in the phone book, so he pays her a visit and plies her with booze. For a drink, she's ready to tell what she knows. She acts cagey about Velma, and he catches her in a lie, taking a photo of the missing Velma with him.

Back at his office, he has another visitor--a well-dressed foppish gentleman who desires to avail himself of Marlowe's services, but he isn't as forthcoming about details as Marlowe would like. He finally gets the man, Lindsey Marriott (Douglas Walton), to admit that there's a jade necklace involved that he's paying to retrieve for a lady. Marlowe accompanies him to a deserted spot, off the beaten path. He goes to investigate, sees nothing, but when he returns to the car, he's hit with a blackjack. When he awakens, it's to find a flashlight held by a woman shining in his face. She drops it and runs. Then he discovers the dead body in the car and calls the cops.

A third visitor to his office (the elevator operator quips that he's becoming successful) turns out to be the mysterious lady, one Ann Grayle (Ann Shirley). And the jade necklace belongs to her stepmother, Helen (Claire Trevor). There is obviously no love lost between stepmother and stepdaughter, and the flaxen blonde Helen isn't slow in showing her attraction to Marlowe.

While following the case, Marlowe becomes involved with a psychic, drugs, a scam, a kidnapping, and more pain than should be given to one man in one lifetime. Will he survive long enough to figure out what's going on, and who did it?

Murder, My Sweet is based on the novel Farewell, My Lovely by Raymond Chandler, that I recently reviewed. It's pretty much the same story, although some things have been changed and condensed, probably in the interest of time. In the book, Ann was Ann Riordan and not Grayle, therefore not related, but this way does make sense.

One huge change, though, had to do with the things I pointed out in my other review, the un-pc things. The black bar was that no longer. The smelly Indian working for Amthor wasn't, and Amthor himself became white. The ship that figured in the book is completely gone. The circumstances of Marlowe being in the doctor's place have slightly changed. But if you haven't read the book, of course you won't notice.

All in all, I think it was an enjoyable film, maybe not quite up to snuff with the Big Sleep, except in one regard. The casting of Philip Marlowe. Having seen both films and read both books, I have to say that Dick Powell's performance was closer to the mark as regards the character that Chandler depicted than Bogart's. Don't get me wrong, I love Bogart. But Powell has it pretty dead-on with how I saw Marlowe, and while I was skeptical before I watched it, afterward I was a firm believer in Powell's ability to act. I hadn't seen him in anything before, so I had no preconceived notions, but I understand most of his roles were lightweight compared to this one. I hope he did more Marlowe films after this; he deserved it.

You might recognize the guy who played Moose if you ever watched Gilligan's Island, and a lot of other old TV shows. He was type cast as the big, dumb heavy, but in real life, he was very intelligent and a witty conversationalist.

As with a lot of films, the romantic element was played up more than in the book, leaving Marlowe and Ann kissing in the back of a taxi. Not a bad ending, but I seriously doubt she appears in any of the other books. Guess I'll find out.

A good film and a good way to spend an evening. I definitely recommend watching this if you enjoy film noir.",1339891200,,4343,4.484810126582278
817283,4,6304212135,"Unfortunately, I see Film Noir as slipping from the scene.

He then gets hired - yep, it's all related - by a dandy kind of gigolo, who leads him to a murder scene, when a series of new characters appear.  What does one have to do with the other?  What is going on and what is at stake?  Who if anyone can he trust?  These questions remain unresolved right up to the end, when it all comes clear, in a wonderful concatenation of conflicting motives, willed ignorance, greed, and image.  There is also a long surrealistic episode of drug-induced hallucination and interrogation, all while Marlow is trying to figure things out.  I don't want to play the spoiler, just to show how complex the tableau is, which is the fun of film noir:  you keep guessing, there are many surprises, and the climax is full of action.

Interestingly, I enticed my kids to watch this because of the holo-deck games of Picard in Star Trek NG, where he likes to play in Chandler mysteries.  Once they started watching it, they enjoyed it, even if it was another weird film from dad.

817369,4,6304212135,"Filled with tart one-liners and sharp performances, MURDER, MY SWEET (aka ""Farewell, My Lovely"") is a good example of just how sublime film noir could be with the RKO Studios.  Most people tend to regard Warner Brothers as the house of choice when it came to noir, but RKO cranked out some real doozies, too.

Dick Powell forever shed his wholesome, goody-goody image when he played hard-boiled Detective Philip Marlowe.  Hired to track down the ex-wife of nutty stand-over man Moose Malloy (Mike Mazurki), Marlowe's trail later leads him into an altogether more puzzling case involving a priceless jade necklace, the sultry second wife of a millionaire (Claire Trevor) and her lovely stepdaughter (Anne Shirley).

MURDER, MY SWEET is a complete ride from beginning to end.  Although the plot is downright convuluted and confusing, the film is compelling largely because of Powell's performance and the snappy screenplay of John Paxton (based on the original novel by Raymond Chandler).

Audiences would have forever pegged Dick Powell for his tap-happy roles in Busby Berkeley musicals like ""42nd Street"" had the character of Marlowe not come along and allowed a new side of his incredible acting range to shine through.  He's remarkable in this movie.  Likewise this film also established radiant ingenue Anne Shirley (from ""Anne of Green Gables"" and ""Stella Dallas"") in a sophisticated new light, although her career sadly ended with this film.

It almost got ridiculous in the last 10 minutes when Dick Powell (""Marlowe"") explained the whole story. He talked too fast and it was next to impossible to follow. I guess I will have to view this more often to understand it better, or find someone who can explain it for my feeble brain.

The best part of the film was the cinematography, which really comes to life on the DVD. Someone did a very nice job restoring this print for this disc. That, and the general dialog by Powell, were fascinating. You could make a short book with all the wise-guy remarks made by ""Marlowe"" in this film - a lot of great stuff.

""Murder, My Sweet"" directed by Edward Dmytryk falls into the above category.  John Payton's script adaptation from Raymond Chandler's novel ""Farewell, My Lovely"" moves at a spellbinding pace as we see the world of detective Philip Marlowe, played by Dick Powell in a dramatic debut after a career as a song and dance man, unfold in Los Angeles.  When he meets up with ex-con Moose Malloy, played by veteran pro wrestler and character actor Mike Mazurki, he becomes a marked man.

Powell's nemises are beautiful bad girl Claire Trevor and gang head Otto Kruger while Anne Shirley, as Trevor's stepdaughter, helps the detective find romance while providing him with the lowdown on the wayward blonde, who will stop at nothing to get what she wants.",1229472000,,919,4.909677419354839
817372,5,6304212135,"When Dick Powell made this movie his acting career astonishingly was at a very low ebb, but this movie helped revitalize the old song and dance man into a transformed 'noir' actor.  He had a lot of help in this movie not only from an excellent script but also from some excellent actors.  One of my favorites has always been Claire Trevor, and if she had not been identified, don't know that I would have ever recognized her as this dazzling, coniving blonde of the jade necklace.

Powell is given some very good, wise cracking lines, but underneath he is a teddy bear and that comes through at times, especially with Anne Shirley.  One client says he doesn't care for Marlowe's (Powell's role) attitude, with Marlowe replying that he has had complaints about that before, but the attitude doesn't seem to improve.  Along the way, and it is a confused way for much of the movie, Marlowe accuses or suspects nearly everyone in the cast, with the police always eyeing Marlowe as a possible suspect.  Ring around the rosey, only death intervenes from time-to-time in this game.  Everyone seems to have something to hide or some angle they are playing with Marlowe picking up easy money.  As he says, some people are paying him to stay with the investigation, while others are paying him to drop the investigation.  As many times as he is sapped and knocked out, one would think he would welcome grabbing the money and letting the thing solve itself.  But as he says, ethics are involved, his mainly since he was originally hired to body guard a client, with that client turning up dead on Marlowe's watch.  It's just another aspect of being a teddy bear underneath it all.

Rich good looking women, sleezy con men and thugs, a stolen jade necklace worth a cool hundred thousand never stolen, and plenty of guns leads to a full fledged Raymond Chandler group of writings brought to the Hollywood screen by RKO.  When looking at 'noir' films it just doesn't get much better than this film.

817373,4,6304212135,"Not all of the classic detective novelist Raymond Chandler's Phillip Marlowes are born equal. The definitive screen role is that of Humphrey Bogart in the Big Sleep. Dick Powell, however, here keeps pretty good company with his interpretation of Marlowe as the world-weary private detective who sees things through to the end, especially when he screws up an assignment. Its professional ethics, you know. That characteristic helped define the noir detective. Here Powell adds a little off-hand humor and self-deprecation to the role as he fight for his concept of rough `justice'. But mainly he is intrepid and that carries him a long way in the role. And surprisingly, unlike in the book, he gets the 'nice' girl in the end. Who would have thought.

Apparently not all classic Raymond Chandler novels are born equal either. The film here takes bits and pieces from various shorter stories written by Chandler earlier in his career as he was defining the Marlowe model to make the plot line run here. If you want to see a truer take on the original novel Farewell, My Lovely that this film is based on then you should see the remake from the 1980's starring Robert Mitchum.

Here the story line runs more around the question of some jade lost by a wealthy woman who actions are central to a murder that occurs along the way. She, as is the order of things in noir films, is a mantrap and classic femme fatale who will do whatever it takes to get what she wants. And will succeed to a point.

The film was called ""Farewell My Lovely"" in Britain and ""Murder, My Sweet"" in the United States...

The plot, as always with this genre, mattered far less than the characters and the action: it was sparked when Marlowe was hired to find an ex-convict's girl friend... This Marlowe was played by Dick Powell... He made a daring, successful effort to drop his all-singing, all-dancing image, and he was tough enough; but he was a little too charming, a shade too superficial, to suggest the depths and the strengths of the real Marlowe...

Humphrey Bogart was the man to do this above all others... And he did it superb1y in Howard Hawks' ""The Big Sleep"" in 1946...

""Murder My Sweet"" is a complex thriller which seemed at the time to demonstrate all manner of strikingly new techniques in a film noir mood, and certainly marked an astonishing transformation in its star...

Filmed in highly-contrasted black-and-white, Murder, My Sweet has the hallmark noir look with many shadows on screen as well as lots of threatening cage-like shapes surrounding the hero's path.

Murder, My Sweet gets started with a bang when Phillip Marlowe (Dick Powell) is being interrogated by the police as a suspect for several murders.  When the lead detective asks him if he wants to make a statement he replies in typical wise-cracking fashion, ""Boys tell me I did a couple of murders.  Anything in it?""  He then proceeds to tell the story of what happened to him, which is filmed as a long flashback with occasional voice-over comments from Marlowe.  Marlowe, as usual, is sucked into a violent criminal plot by a glamorous woman who uses him and then leaves him to take the rap.

Chandler wrote the screenplay and has a fabulous way with words.  His creation, Phillip Marlowe, is a sardonic detective who gets beat up a lot and is somewhat morally ambiguous. He doesn't always know exactly what is going on but he is able to follow his instincts until he unravels at least part of the convoluted crime he has been engaged to solve.  Ann Shirley is the love interest and Claire Trevor plays the femme fatale.  Highly recommended!",1157068800,7,1386,4.7615062761506275
817428,5,6304212135,"After gaining fame by appearing in a number of musicals early in his career, actor Dick Powell (Cornered, Johnny O'Clock, Pitfall) switched gears to play one of literature's toughest mugs, Private Eye Phillip Marlowe, in Murder, My Sweet (1944), which was based off the Raymond Chandler novel ""Farewell My Lovely""...incidentally, Farewell My Lovely was the original title of the film, but was later changed by the studio to Murder, My Sweet, as American audiences, used to seeing Powell in his singing routine, apparently thought the feature was another one of his musicals.  Directed by Edward Dmytryk (The Devil Commands, Back to Bataan, The Caine Mutiny), the film features, along with Powell, Academy Award winner Claire Trevor (Stagecoach, Key Largo), Anne Shirley (Anne of Green Gables, Stella Dallas), and Otto Kruger (Saboteur).  Also appearing is Miles Mander (The Picture of Dorian Gray), Donald Douglas (Gilda), Douglas Walton (Dick Tracy vs. Cueball), and wrestler turned silver screen serial thug Mike Mazurki (Abbott and Costello in Hollywood, Dick Tracy, Nightmare Alley).

As the film begins we see the police questioning a man with bandages covering his eyes, whom later we learn is Phillip Marlowe, Private Eye (Powell), to which he starts from the beginning relating a tale involving a valuable jade necklace, blackmail, and...MURDER!  Seems not too long ago Marlowe was in his office one evening when a rather big mug (about the size of a Buick) named Moose Malloy (Mazurki) enters, looking for a woman (ain't we all, brother) he once knew named Velma, wanting to hire Marlowe to find her (Moose has been away for some number of years, a guest of the state if you know what I mean).  Marlowe accepts the case, but is sidetracked as he's hired for a short gig as a bodyguard by a dandy weasel type named Marriott (Walton), who's attempting to recover a valuable jade necklace recently stolen from a hotsy totsy wealthy socialite named Helen Grayle (Trevor), and is supposedly meeting with the crooks to buy it back.  Anyway, Marriott ends up fettucine al dead-o, while Marlowe takes a blackjack just behind the ear.  After a bit of exchange with the authorities, Marlowe's visited by a young woman named Ann Grayle (Shirley), stepdaughter to Helen (seems Ann's father likes them young, as I'd say Ann and Helen couldn't be more than ten years apart), which leads to a meeting with her stepmother Helen, and Marlowe being retained to local the necklace.  Helen gives Marlowe a line on a well to do psychic consultant/swindling conman named, get this, Jules Amthor (Kruger) as someone possibly involved (Marlowe heard this guy's name come up at the police station).  Anyway, from this point on things get seriously complicated as the further Marlowe digs, the more punishment he receives (he's throttled, pistol whipped, drugged, and so on) which, oddly enough, only seems to encourage him to go further (he also feels some responsibility in terms of Marriott's death, as far as he was hired to protect him and he failed).  Eventually the pieces begin to fall in place, leading up to a real doozy of a finale.

I haven't had a chance to see many of the films featuring the character of Philip Marlowe, but I've heard this is one of the best, and I'd be inclined to believe it after watching this movie last night.  Powell does a wonderful job in the role, presenting a relatively calm, cool, and collected figure, sharp as a tack and yet underestimated by many (which tends to work to his advantage), always handy with just the appropriate glib remark, and possessing a dogged determination to see things through, no matter the dangers that arise.  Some of my favorite parts involve the character's narrative, as it generally includes some of the best lines from the film, the most memorable for me being early on when Marlowe was gathering information on Velma, the woman whom Moose had asked him to find.  At one point Marlowe visits a shabby, older woman whom he describes in the following manner...

""She was a charming, middle-aged lady with a face like a bucket of mud.""

I actually laughed out loud at this statement, something I'm generally not prone to do, even with comedies.  Claire Trevor also comes across really well as a true femme fatale, most definitely possessing masters degrees in the fine arts of seduction and manipulation (she's the kind of woman most men wouldn't mind being used by, at least until it was too late).  One element I especially liked was the complexity of the story.  While I haven't read the novel that spawned this film, I did get a strong feeling in there being an effort to stay true to Chandler's original material, and not an attempt to `dumb' things down (I think often those involved with making films tend to see their patrons as slow witted noodleheads, unable or unwilling to handle labyrinthine and elaborate storylines).  I have to give director Edward Dmytryk, who would find himself a target of the House Un-American Activities Committee in the late 1940s, a lot of credit (along with, obviously, Chandler) as no matter how screwy the plot gets, he manages to reign things in at the end, laying it all out for the viewer, but not necessarily in such a way where it seems obvious...what I mean is there's exposition throughout the film, but it's not necessarily presented as such, but more often a natural outgrowth of events on the screen.  For me, this is one element that separates standard mystery thrill dramas from truly exceptional ones, the latter being the case here.  I was kind of proud of myself, as there were aspects I picked up about the same time as Marlowe, but at the same time there was a lot he figured out well before I did, based on his superior and experienced intuition.  Ah well, I'll never be a gumshoe...a rotten heel, perhaps, but never a gumshoe...

The picture, presented in fullscreen (1.33:1), looks very clean and clear, and the Dolby Digital mono audio comes across well.  As far as extras, included is a commentary track with author/film-noir specialist Alain Silver, a rough looking theatrical trailer, and subtitles in English, Spanish, and French.  If you're interested in picking up this DVD, you might want to look into purchasing the Film Noir Classics Collection, Volume 1, a most excellent DVD set, as it includes this film, along with Gun Crazy (1949) aka Deadly Is the Female, The Asphalt Jungle (1950), Out of the Past (1947), and The Set-Up (1949) which appears to cost significantly less than buying the films individually.

Throw in a couple of dames, a ""mad"" doctor and Mike Mazurki as a single minded thug looking for his girl to round out the cast.  Some really nice comedic touches add to a film that is still well worth watching today.",1155254400,,586,4.025862068965517
817430,5,6304212135,"Most film fans know the story:  former boy crooner Dick Powell leaves Warner Brothers to sign with RKO.  The latter hopes to start a new string of musicals, but Powell insists on his first picture being a dramatic role.  Against type he is cast as Philip Marlowe in a film version of Raymond Chandler's FAREWELL MY LOVELY.  Even director Edward Dmytryk is upset that Powell is cast in the role, but against all expectation Powell shines in the film.  Unfortunately the public, thinking the film a musical, stays away until RKO retitles the film MURDER, MY SWEET, at which point the box office picks up dramatically.  Today it is probably Powell's most highly regarded role.

Unbelievably, this was in fact the second film made from FAREWELL MY LOVELY.  The novel provided the plot for one of the films in the Falcon detective series that starred George Sanders.  I actually managed to see this a few years back on a TV station that was running all of the Falcon films.  It actually is not a bad film though not as good as the Powell version.  For my money the best version of all is the later version starring Robert Mitchum as Philip Marlowe and Charlotte Rampling as Helen Grayle.

It is hard to recall now that this was still a fairly new genre when this film came out.  Though there had been a large number of detective series in the late 1930s, virtually all of them had been low budget affairs.  THE MALTESE FALCON changed that, moving the detective film from the second tier and inspiring some of the finest films in subsequent film history.  This one lays claim to being the finest detective film after THE MALTESE FALCON and before Robert Montgomery's turn as Marlowe in 1946 in LADY IN THE LAKE and Bogart's Marlowe in THE BIG SLEEP, also in 1946.

There are a number of departures from the novel, some of them actually borrowing from other Chandler novels, some of them put in for what movie execs imagined was desired by fans.  We therefore get a horrible tacked on romantic ending that feels completely out of place with the rest of the film.  Marlowe in the novels is a battered, emotionally scarred, cynical loner who despite himself still holds to ideals that no longer have relevance in his own life.  It is pretty clear in the books that he is someone who will never know love himself, but he will do all he can to help preserve the possibility for others.  In ""Red Wind,"" a truly great Chandler short story, Marlowe is asked to recover a pearl necklace a woman was given by her one true love, who died a few years earlier.  Marlowe recovers the necklace, only to realize they were high quality fakes.  Knowing that the police will examine them upon their return and uncover the truth and therefore destroy the woman's illusions about the great love of her life, Marlowe has low quality fakes made up and placed upon the string.  He returns the necklace to his client, telling her that the bad guys had already sold the pearls, but that at least he had recovered the string upon which they had been strung.  She is grateful and retains her faith in her dead lover.  The story ends with Chandler sitting on a pier, tossing one fake pearl after another into the ocean.  Nothing illustrates Marlowe's character better than this story.  Nothing runs more counter to it than the ending of this film.  Marlowe may always get his man, but he never will he end up with a companion.

Sadly, as wonderful as this movie is, Powell would never be in as good a film again.  While his transition to dramatic roles was genuine, he tended to spend his time in lesser projects until he largely shifted over to television--one of the first movie stars to do so--in the fifties.  Anne Shirley, who played Ann Grayle and who though only 26 at the time of the film was released, never made another picture, though she had been an actress from age 4 and made well over 50 films.  Claire Trevor, on the other hand, would go on to win an Oscar for KEY LARGO a few years later and would receive a nomination for THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY.  Interestingly, perhaps the most active performer in future years would be Mike Muzurski, who played Moose Molloy in this one and gangsters, Indians, genial oafs, and bad guys in an enormous number of movies and television shows until his death.  Director Edward Dmytryk went on to make a number of excellent films, including such classics as CROSSFIRE and THE CAINE MUTINY.",1152921600,5,4404,4.5681528662420385
817431,5,6304212135,"Murder, My Sweet is based on the book Farewell My Lovely. The title was changed so that Dick Powell fans would not expect to see him in another musical and become disappointed by his hard boiled character. This film helped to change Powell's career and steered him toward gritty film noir and away from the peppy musicals he had grown tired of and too old for.

This was a great film for Powell to transition to. His character Phillip Marlowe is like a character from a Bogart film and typical of film noir. Marlowe is a detective but one who is up for bribery and accepting of crime when it benefits him. When several people come to him for help, one man looking for his long lost dance hall love and one to recover a stolen jade necklace, he finds himself entangled in a web of lies and danger. The story is spellbinding and filled with all sorts of twists and turns complete with a great ending.

Powell is wonderful in his role. The character is raw and realistic, a major change for Powell. He speaks his lines with conviction and heart. His personality is confident bordering on arrogance, an attribute that makes him terribly sexy. Even though the character is as selfish as can be, it is difficult not to like him and care deeply about what happens to him.

He is hired by Moose Malloy to find his missing girl friend, Velma. Through his first inquirers he will meet an pasty who will beg for his company if he accompanies to a determined place. In that dark night, Marlowe will be knocked.

Since that fact, a chain of chained events will constitute an admirable exercise of precision logic, where the greed, double cross, ambition will nourish this harrowing plot.

The cynical presence of Marlowe anticipated by far the future features given by Bogart in films like The Big Sleep, for instance. But there is still more, the disorienting angles, the nightmarish landscapes and chaotic images preview by far films such Vertigo and Touch of Evil. The sureeal sense of perversion suggested when Marlowe is drugged accent dramatically, the tension and mold still more the environment of corruption and decay that surrounds and maintain the nasty behavior of the rest of the personages.

This Noir Film is a true breakthrough by itself; it explores new dimensions and even amplifies the horizons of this passionate and fundamental genre. This is not only a quintessential picture in the genre, but also influenced many films.

Dick Powell conferred to Marlowe an unpredictable personality and gave him a certain English touch with visible elegance - watch for his impeccable elegance along the film - and a bitter vocabulary and fastness in every answer or observation; sharpness and cynicism; charisma and temperament; are some of the new features of this well know detective who finally knows about a certain happiness inside his blindness.

The storyline of this movie is that a private detective, Phillip Marlow (Dick Powell), gets involved in the recovery of a stolen jade necklace.  The job initially seems simple, but the investigation gets more convulated and dangerous as time goes on.  During the job, Marlow encounters two very attractive women (Claire Trevor and Anne Shirley) who also make the movie very watchable.

Overall, its a beautifully filmed movie.  It clearly has the classic film noir style, but the substance of the plot gets so complicated that at times its too hard to follow, and finally has to end by explaining a lot of the twist and turns.  It's a lot more of a murder-mystery movie than an crime-action film.  I still strongly recommend this movie, but if you are like me, you will probably have to watch it twice to pickup all the subtle details of the story.

The DVD quality is excellent overall, but some small specs of film deterioration could be seen once in a while during the course of the movie.  It's not a perfect picture presentation, but near perfect.  The only bonus features are commentary by film noir author Alan Silver and the original theater trailer.

PLEASE NOTE:  Before buying this DVD, consider buying the Film Noir Classic Collection, Vol. 1 which contains this movie plus four other highly recommended movies at a very reasonable price.

817506,5,6304212135,"""Murder, My Sweet"" was adapted for the screen by John Paxton from Raymond Chandler's novel ""Farewell, My Lovely"". The title was changed to ""Murder, My Sweet"" for American release, because the studio felt that Chandler's title might confuse Dick Powell fans into thinking the movie was a musical, as Powell had made a career up to this point of singing in musical comedies. This role as Chandler's blunt-talking private eye Philip Marlowe was intended to change Powell's image as the actor approached middle age and became unsuitable for crooning young man parts. And it worked.

The film opens to a scene of policemen questioning private detective Philip Marlowe (Dick Powell) on suspicion of murder. Marlowe's in a bad mood, can't see a thing, and resentful of the whole situation, but he tells them, and us, his story from the beginning: One evening a tough guy named Moose Malloy (Mike Mazurki) walked into his office, made some threats, gave him some money, and hired Marlowe to locate an ex-girlfriend whom Moose had known before he spent 8 years in prison. The next day, a stylish gentleman named Mr. Marriott (Douglas Walton) waved some more money at Marlowe to accompany him while buying back some stolen jewels for an associate. The buy didn't go as planned. Marriott was working for a Mrs. Helen Grayle (Claire Trevor), the wife of an elderly jade collector, who then hired Marlowe to find her stolen necklace. But Helen's stepdaughter, Ann (Anne Shirley) tried to buy Marlowe off the case for mysterious reasons. And Moose is increasingly impatient to find his former flame.

""Murder, My Sweet"" is one of only a dozen or so private detective film noirs, and it adheres to some private eye and some film noir conventions. The story is told in flashback with voiceover narration. The detective goes from person to person, place to place, often around in circles, questioning people. And there is a pronounced sense of confusion. Marlowe is thoroughly perplexed about his cases -and has a sense of humor about it- for most of the film, but he keeps going until he bumps into something that will clarify matters. When he is beaten up, drugged, and held captive by some equally bewildered characters, Marlowe's drug-induced, surreal perception of reality exemplifies his confusion. ""Murder, My Sweet"" was made at RKO, where the noir visual style can be said to have originated under the influence of ""Citizen Kane"". Director Edward Dmytryk and cinematographer Harry Wild employ a lot of low key lighting and low angles, so this is a nice example of noir expressionist lighting.

The DVD (Warner Home Video 2004): There is a theatrical trailer and an audio commentary by film noir theorist and author Alain Silver, who wrote ""Raymond Chandlers' Los Angeles"", among other things. Silver is slow to introduce himself, but launches straight into a scene-by-scene analysis of the film. The commentary isn't very fluid, but it contains a lot of information. Silver seems to comment on whatever comes to his mind, so we have analysis of lighting and characters, information on actors and locations, discussion of Chandler's novel, and  general trivia. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, and French.",1114300800,2,3220,5.02434456928839
817507,5,6304212135,"Dick Powell makes a fine Philip Marlowe in this splendid film noir.  The film is based on Raymond Chandler's ""Farewell, My Lovely,"" which marks the second appearance of Marlowe in print.  The book was actually adapted once before for an entry in the Falcon series (""The Falcon Takes Over""), which featured George Sanders.  That film, however, simply adapted the plot of ""Farewell, My Lovely"" for the Falcon series; hence, the character is named Gay Lawrence, not Philip Marlowe.  So in effect, ""Murder, My Sweet"" is the first screen appearance of Philip Marlowe.  In addition, ""The Falcon Takes Over"" is a decent but lightweight thriller - not the noir classic of ""Murder, My Sweet.""

The plot is typically convoluted for a film noir written by Chandler.  Marlowe, a somewhat down-on-his-luck private detective, is approached by Moose Malloy, a giant of a man who has just been released from the pokey and is searching for his ex-girlfriend.  He reluctantly accepts the case.  However, before he can make headway, Marlowe gets a second client, the effete Lindsay Marriott who wants Marlowe to accompany him on a late night pay-off.  These two cases quickly become enmeshed and lead to numerous complications and murders.

""Murder, My Sweet"" is first-rate film noir in every way.  Director Edward Dmytryk (The Caine Mutiny, Crossfire) was one of the best noir film makers of all time, and he uses the conventions of the genre (shadows and unusual lighting, hard-boiled dialogue) with fine subtlety.  The cast is also extraordinary - lead by Powell as Marlowe.  Arguably, Humphrey Bogart was a more forceful Marlowe two years later in ""The Big Sleep.""  However, Powell is convincing as the straight-shooting but somewhat desperate detective.  Furthermore, he's joined by femme fatale Claire Trevor, who is always terrific in this type of hard-bitten role.  Screenwriter John Paxton adapted Chandler's novel - managing to save some of the best bits, such as Marlowe's encounter with Mrs. Florian (""She was a charming middle-aged lady with a face like a bucket of mud"").  All of the elements really come together for one of the finest noirs ever made, and this DVD transfer is solid.

DVD extras: The original theatrical trailer and an informational, but somewhat boring commentary by Alain Silver, who is a film producer and has written several books on film noir.",1104364800,21,2361,5.085714285714285
817508,5,6304212135,"This is as classic a Noir as they get. I would recommend this to those who are just discovering this genre and want to sink their teeth into something real. This is it! Dick Powell does  Marlowe better than anyone. He portrays the gritty, scruffy hard-boiled detective so true, you almost think you're watching a reality show. The storyline is somewhat hard to follow, but that's not what Noirs are really about anyway. It's about the atmosphere, the sense of danger, the grittiness, the somber, complicated characters, the wicked devious femme fatale. This film has all these elements. Watch it and enjoy!",1098921600,9,606,4.9411764705882355
817509,4,6304212135,"Forget about following the plot, to begin with.  Essentially, there isn't one; Raymond Chandler used a kind of stream-of-conciousness technique in stringing together his stories, though he never would have used that high-falutin' expression.  For Chandler, an ex-oil executive who turned to fiction when he busted in Los Angeles, the whole point was character, mood and dialogue.  You get plenty of all three here, and the best performance of Dick Powell's career, as Phillip Marlowe.  Next to Bogart in ""The Maltese Falcon,"" it's probably the most believable private eye in the American movies.  Edward Dmytryk didn't put together another great directing job like this until ""The Caine Mutiny"" ten years later.  The character actor Mike Mazurki also turns in a memorable job as a demented hood.",1096070400,3,795,5.26984126984127
817510,4,6304212135,"I don't usually like the Chandler-Hammet type detective movies. I've probably seen ""The Maltese Falcon"" 3 times and I still scratch my head.  When viewing these type films it is probably best to subordinate the story to how well the characters and mood are developed.  On this point ""Murder My Sweet"" succeeds.  It's my understanding that Dick Powell prior to tackling the role of hardboiled  detective Philip Marlowe he was typecast as a song and dance man.  Having never seen any of Powell's musicals, I'll have to assume he succeeded in his change of pace.  Claire Trevor is, as usual, excellent as the millionaire's trophy wife.  Anne Shirley is sexy as the millionaire's daughter from a previous marriage.  The plot at first seems a bit convoluted.  But a patient viewer will watch the pieces of this puzzle come together in a satisfying conclusion.  The setting is pre-war Los Angeles and the black and white photography is scintillating.",1091836800,5,944,4.955414012738854
817583,3,6304212135,"Movie musical crooner Dick Powell tried to darken up his image in this Raymond Chandler adaptation, but some will find him a snippy Philip Marlowe. Regardless, ''Murder'' is a straight shot of noir, thanks to Edward Dmytrk's inspired direction. The DVD looks great -- there's a nice bed of black for all that gray smoke. The look of film noir usually is traced back to German Expressionism; the influence is much in evidence here. About half of the narration comes directly from Chandler's book. Commentator Alain Silver knows his stuff -- he wrote the book ''Raymond Chandler's Los Angeles.'' He points out that only about a dozen true film noir films featured private detectives -- half of them based on Chandler books.",1090800000,2,721,4.918032786885246
817584,5,6304212135,"One of the better ventures on the darker side of film noir with Raymond Chandler's PI Philip Marlowe (Dick Powell) enmeshed in a complicated search for a jade necklace. He's hired by a thick brute named Moose Malloy (Mike Mazurki) to find former night club singer Velma Valenti. After numerous attempts to throw him off the scent, he tracks her down. She's now Mrs. Grayle (Claire Trevor), married to a much older man with a grown daughter (Anne Shirley) who despises her. The jade necklace comes into play and so does Mrs. Grayle. Marlowe enters a weird plot that eventually finds him drugged and held prisoner before he fights his way back with the help of Shirley. ""Murder My Sweet"" is good and salty film noir with hard bitten performances, brittle dialogue, thugs, mystery and a sexy femme fatale in Mrs. Grayle. When Marlowe first meets her, she's wearing a revealing white dress that allows her entire leg to be casually exposed when she sits down. Very sexy for the 40's. Excellent b&w photography with almost everything occuring at night drenches the film with heavy noir atmosphere. This is a classic film to be savored and the DVD print is great. A real collectors' treat.",1089244800,,1183,4.775609756097561
817585,4,6304212135,"Interesting choice of career change for Dick Powell. After establishing himself as the light hearted lothario of 1930s Busby Berkeley musicals at Warner Brothers, the crooner side stepped his squeaky clean, boy-next-door image entirely with a string of deep and powerful dramatic performances. In ""Murder My Sweet"" Powell carries off Raymond Chandler's hard-boiled detective, Philip Marlowe to perfection. Okay, he's no Bogart, whom film buffs will recall played Marlowe in ""The Big Sleep."" But Powell's performance is a close second, buffeted by his quick thinking, deeply cynical, smart-shooting dialect. In ""Murder My Sweet"" Marlowe is hired by an ex-con (Mike Mazurki) to hunt down his old flame. But the plot spins out of control when a murder leads to Marlowe's engagement by a manipulative woman (Claire Trevor), to recover her missing jewels. But a drug induced nightmare fraught in symbolism and expressionism turns Marlowe's world on end, devouring his soul beneath a seedy underbelly that permeates  both high-society and the dangerous post war bars and flophouses of inner city Los Angeles. ""Murder My Sweet"" is one of the first great, though often overlooked, film noirs; an absolute must see.
Warner's transfer on ""Murder My Sweet"" is better than average. In fact it's remarkably clean. The gray scale is very well balanced with deep solid blacks and whites that are vibrant and sharp. There's some film grain but few age related artifacts for a visual presentation that is over all a considerable improvement over previously issued VHS tapes.  The audio is mono but nicely balanced. The more intent listener will notice slight pops.  Alain Silver delivers a very thorough audio commentary that will most surely enhance your appreciation for this film.  A very good disc to add to your library of classic cinema.",1089072000,4,1826,5.243150684931507
817586,5,6304212135,"This is the movie that hooked me on ""Film Noir.""  I first saw this on the late show while suffereing a killer flu.  Even through local TV editing and enough medicine to tranquilize a circus tent, it had me sitting at attention from start to finish.  It wasn't until several years later that I got to see it uncut on cable that I got the full effect.  Having grown up with Bogart's hard-boiled private eye archetype, Dick Powell was a complete revelation to me.  If you double-bill this with Bogart's ""Big Sleep,"" you see at once that Powell truly IS Phillip Marlowe (even Raymond Chandler thought so), and Bogart is much better suited to portray Hammet's colder, meaner Sam Spade.  Powell gives Marlowe a vulnerable cynicism as well as a touch of the ""everyman,"" that Bogart wouldn't be able to pull off until later in his career. Powell's background in romantic musicals gives him access to a far deeper emotional range, needed to play the complex and conflicted Marlowe; his cynicism, his humour, his loyalty to his code...it's all there.  Powell manages to give extra resonance to some of Chandler's throw-away similes!  No wonder he claimed this as his favorite role!
  The direction by Edward Dmytryk and cinematography by Harry Wild are perfect, giving the film a tight, economical yet alluring vintage ""feel"".  Working on a tight budget, they manage to infuse it with all the seedy, chaotic topography that would serve as the touchtones for every film of this type from ""Night of the Hunter"" to ""Blade Runner.""  While this isn't the first Noir film, it may well be the best.",1067558400,25,1581,4.772058823529412
817587,4,6304212135,"January 1945: Murder, My Sweet is released starring former movie musical crooner Dick Powell as tough detective Philip Marlowe, Claire Trevor as femme fatale Mrs. Grayle (aka Velma Valentino) and Mike Mazurki (in his first major role) as big lug-thug goofball Moose Malloy.  Based on Raymond Chandler's Farewell, My Lovely, this baby is the real deal when it comes to film noir. Yeah, there were others before this--The Maltese Falcon and especially, Double Indemnity with a phenomenal performance by Barbara Stanwyck.
But this is the one that put detective-based film noir on the map.  The 1975 version (same title as the book) with Robert Mitchum, John Ireland, and some of the other classic film noir stalwarts is, in fact, a pretty good piece of work.  But Murder, My Sweet is the ne plus ultra of film noir.  The director, Edward Dmytryk, had a limited budget and so confined much of his shooting to low-lit interiors to save money.  Not only that--he also has some ultra-cool sequences of poor Marlowe, having been force-fed a syringe or two of dope, hallucinating something awful. This shows the influence of German Expressionism to the max; the contrast of black and white has never been sharper, more vibrant, more startling in an American film.  And dig those crazy images--multiple doors to go through trying to avoid a doc who walks through doors; larger than life images of two of the bad guys looming above, peering down at Marlowe with spooked up backlit faces; a giant syringe ready to plunge.
There's the good girl and the bad girl, sure.  There's the supposedly innocent older husband of the femme fatale.  There's the evil brains of the picture who loves blackmail, brutality, and backbiting.  And of course there's the hard-bitten cops dogging Marlowe throughout his journey from cynical onlooker to active tough guy to sentimental joe.  What's not to like?
So far the only DVD of this is being released in France. Hey, movie studios!  Wake up!  Time to get more film noir on DVD!
Yeah.  A great piece of work; that's what I say.",1062720000,7,2049,4.870317002881844
817588,4,6304212135,"""Murder, My Sweet"", released in 1944, is a taunt film noir thriller based on Raymond Chandler's novel, ""Farewell, My Lovely"". The story goes that the studio [RKO] changed the title so that audiences wouldn't think it was yet another Dick Powell musical. Powell, whose career was flagging, wanted a new image, and he certainly got it playing hard-boiled detective Phillip Marlowe. Two years later, Humphrey Bogart became the quintessential Marlowe in ""The Big Sleep"", but that doesn't change the fact that Powell is himself quite memorable.
Marlowe is hired by a playboy to accompany him in the retrieval of a jade necklace he claims was stolen from a wealthy friend of his. At the place where the exchange is to take place, Marlowe is knocked out and awakens to find the man has been murdered. Other new [and unwelcome] clients are also knocking at his door. One is a huge ex-con who is looking for his old girlfriend. Another is the daughter [Anne Shirley] of the man whose wife owned the jade necklace. The woman is Helen Grayle [Claire Trevor], a beautiful, seductive woman with a past. Marlowe, as usual, finds himself surrounded by people whose motives are questionable and often dangerous. He puts himself and others in jeopardy as he relentlessly pursues the truth.
Claire Trevor, one of Hollywood's greatest character actresses, gives a fine, edgy performance as Helen. Otto Kruger is deliciously sinister as Jules Amthor, shady underground figure and chief suspect.
The Chandler novel was remade in the 1970s using the original title. Robert Mitchum played Marlowe and the remarkable Charlotte Rampling starred as Helen Grayle. This version is more faithful to the book, but I find ""Murder, my Sweet"" to be a slightly better movie.",1028937600,12,1740,5.024221453287197
817589,5,6304212135,"""Film Noir"" was actually a term coined by the French two years after this movie was filmed.  There were several film noir now classics filmed before Murder, My Sweet:  Double Identity and The Maltese Falcon.  Still, this one estabished innovations and precedents in full force and style to this day.  The camera's use of chiaroscuro and filming the characters from a lower angle up.  Boxes and shoe lifts were used to make the ex-con looking for his former girlfriend after being released from prison (excellently played by Mike Mazurki), considerably taller than the 6' tall Dick Powell.
And the lollapalooza performance by Dick Powell leaves one's mouth agape.  Watching him gliding through all those former musicals, whoever would have thought he had it in him!  His performance is sterling, and to prove the point, he never made another musical.  From here on he embarked on a new and successful career.  And we must thank the great director, Edward Dymtryk (who gives a very interesting interview at the conclusion of the film), for giving Powell the chance to play this role and having faith in him.
The story:  Powell is a PI scraping for a buck in his dingy office.  In comes Moose Malloy (Muzurki, a former wrestler), just out of prison, wanting to find his ex-girlfriend who was so ""cute.""  She turns out to be anything-but-cute Claire Trevor (a ruthless, hardboiled, sex-seething beauty), married for money but up to all sorts of mischief on the side.  From here it's downhill into the seedy, underworld of L.A.  Powell is true to the role all the way through.  Anne Shirley (the last film she ever made -- at its conclusion she married the film's producer, Adrian Scott, who was later blacklisted due to the HUAC, forcing them to move to England, after which he never produced another film) is perfect as the one fresh face in the film.  And I have to mention the crispy, quipping dialogue straight out of Chandler.  In fact there was a concious, successful attempt to remain true to Chandler as much as possible.
Don't miss it.  It's really exciting!",1024272000,10,2063,4.8125
817590,5,6304212135,"The only thing that must have disappointed Raymond Chandler, who wrote the masterful detective novel ""Farewell, My Lovely,"" on which ""Murder, My Sweet"" was based, was that it was made at RKO while he was under contract at Paramount two blocks away, making him unable to get involved in the screenplay.  He highly praised the finished product, however, even if it was made by the competitor in the neighborhood.  Not generally given to lavish praise, Chandler pronounced Dick Powell as the perfect Philip Marlowe.  The film was a tour de force for Powell, a former song and dance man seeking to retool his Hollywood career in the direction of a dramatic actor.  He delivers the crisp lines, many of which were taken from the pages of Chandler's book, with effortless aplomb.
Mike Mazurki, under contract to RKO, lobbied for the part.  When director Edward Dmytryk would not offer it to him it was ultimately offered to the famous professional wrestler-actor by none other than studio president Charles Korner.
""It was a big opportunity for me,"" he genial actor once told me in an interview.  ""It was my first big dramatic part, a great opportunity.  Dick Powell came up to me before the film started shooting and told me that we should really stick together on this one since we were in the same boat.  He explained about making the transition from musicals, where he had made his mark.""
Powell as Chandler's detective Philip Marlowe and Mazurki as dim-witted and homicidal ex-con Moose Malloy make film magic.  Mazurki digs his ham-like hand into Powell early in the film and commands, ""Find my Velma!""  He is referring to the woman he loved, the dancer he had to leave when he was sent to prison.
Powell takes Mazurki's money and launches his pursuit.  He eventually runs into the underworld and smooth talking con man Otto Kruger.  He also encounters Claire Trevor, formerly Mazurki's Velma and now a rich man's wife with a new identity, but the same outlook as before, sociopathic.  Ann Shirley plays the stepdaughter of Trevor.  She loves her father and recognizes Trevor as a ruthless opportunist.  In the meantime Powell and Shirley begin making music of their own, and continue making it at Fade Out.
Trevor has been likened as a femme fatale to Jane Greer in ""Out of the Past"" and Barbara Stanwyck in ""Double Indemnity.""  The comparisons are apt.  All three performers exude a raw and combustible sensuality as ruthless women who know what they want and do not care how they acquire it.  ""Murder, My Sweet"" and the other two aforementioned films rate at the very top of film noir genre.",1009411200,12,2594,4.804054054054054
