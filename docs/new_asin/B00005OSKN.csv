7949054,4,B00005OSKN,"To start with, you bet it's cheesy. 70' total, 60' of trailers plus 10' of studio promo. Most of us know this, but for those who don't - don't expect it to be a story or a documentary. It just cheesy fun.

Content:
- More monster, less dinosaur
- Willis O'Brian, Charles Schneer, Ray Harryhousen
- Edgar Rice Burroughs, Jules Vernes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
- Dynamation, claymation, blue bellied lizards with fins glued to their backs, puppets (sock and marionette), full-sized costumes
- Kong, Sinbad, Jason, Gulliver,
- Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, Ghidrah, The Thing, Gorgo (no Gamera)
- Big (of course): ants, spiders, armadillos, iquanas, octopi, crabs, turtles
- The destruction of Tokyo, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Tokyo, Rome, London, New York, and, sadly, even Tokyo
- Raquel Welch, Jill St. John, Raymond Burr, James Mason, Pat Boone. Doug McClure is here twice (as his namesake on the Simpsons would say: ""You may remember me from such films as The Land That Time Forgot and At the Earth's Core.)

But if your looking at this title you're probably already in the market for this fodder. You cannot be swayed. You've already made up your mind. No going back. So if you're into camp, nostalgia, cheese, artistry (come on, Ray Harryhaussen was absolutely awsome), possibly beer and popcorn, and can sacrifice a couple of Big Macs, then this is a fun addition to your collection.",1195257600,,1383,4.8808510638297875
7949055,5,B00005OSKN,"""Fantastic Dinosaurs of the Movies"" (1990 - 75 minutes), a documentary produced by Good Times and directed by Sandy Oliveri, presents an amazing compilation of classic films images of dinosaurs and monsters. It includes features of the masters Willis O'Brien, Ray Harryhausen, Jim Danforth and trailers of many of their films. Take a look at what you are going to watch: ""Gertie, the Dinosaur"" (1909), ""The Lost World"", ""Journey to the Beginning of Time"", ""King Dinosaur"", ""The Giant Behemoth"", ""The Spider"", ""The Giant Gila Monster"", ""The Loch Ness Horror"", ""The Land That Time Forgot"", ""Jack, the Giant-Killer"", ""It Came From Beneath the Sea"", ""Them!"", ""Valley of the Dragons"", ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"", ""Tarantula"", ""20 Million Miles to Earth"", ""Godzilla vs. Mothra"", ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"", ""The Crater Lake Monster"", ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"", ""Rodan"", ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"", ""Reptilicus"", ""The Land Unknown"", ""Jason and the Argonauts"", ""Ghidrah, the Three-Headed Monster"", ""At the Earth's Core"", ""The Valley of Gwangi"", ""Gorgo"", ""King Kong"", ""Son of Kong"", ""King Kong vs. Godzilla"", ""One Million Years B.C."", and"" When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth "". Certainly this documentary is a collector item and a very good program for who likes this sort of film. Unfortunately, there are no extras in the DVD.",1141430400,9,1337,5.311320754716981
7949056,3,B00005OSKN,"Basically, this DVD is a seventy minute collection of monster movie trailers. Other than a brief three minute introduction that talks about dinosaurs and the movies and a short behind the scenes look at one of the SINBAD movies, the rest of the DVD is nothing but trailers.
The title of this DVD is misleading because it really doesn't have much to do with dinosaurs. Instead, most of the trailers are from monster pictures.  Some of the trailers that can be seen include GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS, RODAN, KING KONG, KING KONG VS. GODZILLA, JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH, JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS, and ONE MILLION YEARS B.C.
Though I was a little disappointed by the content, I was also surprised that I enjoyed watching it. I'm a huge film buff and I found it a pleasure to see shots of some the great early sfx wizards. It was also a hilarious trip seeing how cheesy some of these ""big monster"" movies looked.
Overall, this disc is something that only a huge movie fan or big monster movie fan will enjoy; definitely something the average person will not like.",1051920000,6,1071,4.578125
