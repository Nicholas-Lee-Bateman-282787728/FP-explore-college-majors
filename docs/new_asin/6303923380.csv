7860428,5,6303923380,Any fan of this era of music will really enjoy this. It's really great to see a band not take itself too seriously and have fun for a change. Also great to see how full of life these guys were. I watch it again & again.,1502496000,,219,3.782608695652174
7860429,5,6303923380,"I love this video! What else can I say? Its Alice in Chains, and Layne Staley. Its funny, has good music, it's a gem. Glad I was able to get a copy.",1447200000,,148,3.65625

7860431,5,6303923380,"This video is hilarious! It features Jerry, Layne, Sean, and Mike all being interviewed and having fun in a studio and around Seattle. Nona, the interview lady, kidnapping Sean? Layne drinking Snapple by a dumpster? Mike getting his hair curled? Sean laying in a dumpster talking about the new album? Jerry becoming a farmer because of no recent work with music? Layne talking about his most embarrassing moment? Sean dressed as a clown and drunk out of his mind? Yep, it's all on this tape. A must buy for you Alice In Chains fans. Find out who Nona really is!",1396224000,,561,4.62
7860432,5,6303923380,This mockumentary is probably one of the funniest things I've ever seen a band do. This is why classic rock is best rock.,1392768000,,121,4.304347826086956
7860433,5,6303923380,A real treasure for someone interested in the grunge/Seattle scene in the the '90s. My 15 year old son enjoyed adding this to his collection of music and memorabilia.,1326758400,,166,4.758620689655173
7860434,5,6303923380,"'The Nona Tapes' is a real treasure for any AIC fan. When I first watched 'The Nona Tapes', I laughed until I cryed and I still do everytime I watch it. This is a MUST for any true AIC fan. If seeing Jerry dressed in drag (and doing a darn good impression) wasn't enough, you get to see Sean dressed as a clown and hear Mike talk about his business in Hot Dogs while he get's a ""make-over"". But the real highlight of this short film is getting to see Layne healthy and content. You also get to see Laynes 'funnier side' which is a real treat to me. 'The Nona Tapes' is a real treat and a great collectors item for any AIC fan. Grab one while you can.",1221350400,,650,4.007692307692308
7860435,5,6303923380,"This is a great ""mockumentary"" from the greatest band to ever walk the face of this sad Earth.",1211587200,,94,4.277777777777778
7860436,5,6303923380,"The documentary was funny, shows a different side of the band. I liked it and watch it all the time. :]",1202601600,,103,3.9523809523809526
7860437,5,6303923380,"Any footage of AIC just being normal people is a treasure to me.  They are a horribly underappreciated band and i am glad to see that they have some documenation.  I don't even think they have a Behind the Music done for them.  oh yeah, is that really Jerry in the drag????  i have seen the video a dozen times and never noticed or thought that might be him.",1103068800,10,358,4.144927536231884
