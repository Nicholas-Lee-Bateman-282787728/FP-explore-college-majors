they do not match up to the quality of the Serial Squadron products.
For example, the Serial Squadron's version of ""THE PHANTOM EMPIRE""
is far far superior to the VCI release of the same.",1283558400,2,256,4.244897959183674
1389755,5,B000053SNN,"I enjoy some of the old 30s & 40s serial low budget productions but one of the problems is to find decent prints.  Since most all of them are and have been public domain access to them has been better than ever but the caveat is to be careful or not get upset with a bad print now and then.  I make sure I don't spend all that much and hope for surprises.
Although there are some great remastered products out there they tend to be a little more to far more expensive and some have up to date interviews and all kinds of 'special features' which may or may not be interesting. Alpha, Mill Creek seem to offer the mass market bare bones approach and give super access to all kinds of interesting stuff that was , I guess, the precursor to today's TV programming.
Mystery Squadron is a particularly early one from 1933 and it is like a visit to a whole alien world.  I guess it was advanced for its day with some great aerial combat simulations, some models too , no doubt, but the hi tech bi planes doing aerobatics was good. The quality of sound and picture was pretty good through out as well.  This was a very reasonable cost for 12 episodes and the cost per episode was probably 10x the cost of the Sat nickle double feature and a great bargain today.  I resist watching too much at once, this one would have been tough to get through in one sitting anyway nearly 4hrs of cliffhangers and action.",1252713600,,1399,4.264150943396227

Four of the twelve episodes in THE MYSTERY SQUADRON are recap chapters of film clips. This was a common studio cost-cutting practice.

THE STORY: A dam-project engineer hires two stunt pilots to protect an unfinished dam from THE MYSTERY SQUADRON, led by the elusive ""Black Ace."" Attacks from this squadron are always preceded by the arrival of a model-sized plane. The two pilots eventually get accused of being gang members, and must fight off their nemeses while simultaneously trying to clear their names.

1389759,3,B000053SNN,"I believe I first remember seeing ""The Black Ace-Mystery Squadron"" on television in the UK broadcast from Alexandra Palace about 1951. Of course made black and white in about 1933 it features the expertise of the era. When you read that Marlon Brando and James Dean revolutionized screen acting; then by watching this serial you'll see exactly what that means.

The Black Ace features acting by exponents of the 'Very Old School of Screen Movies'; the VERY meaningful look much used in silent movies and still seen here given by experts from the wooden school of screen acting, the excellent 200 dB female screams featured in nearly every episode, the cliche phrases straight from the playground of the 1950's- 'Let's get him, men' ' He went that way'and,of course, 'Black Ace calling station A'.

The film set is marvellous; a lot of the action takes place in the Tavern Hotel, crammed with very obvious sercret passages contstructed from hardboard and 2"" X 2"" batons. The action in the Tavern Hotel often degenerates into a Brian Rix farce with the actors chasing each other round and round the set. The old planes are wonderful; straight from the Barnstorming Era and kept, of course, in secret caves of which there many and armed with the latest in modern aircraft armour- the drain pipe that appears from the rear of the aircraft that spurts a 20 foot flame when activated by an enormous light switch in the cockpit; secret radios the size of a cupboard hidden in easy to find places. Also spot where the idea for the Darth Vader Face Mask originated. No expense is spared in using the old planes as well as super motor vehicles of the era that race around everywhere not to forget the  horses and lassoos. The exchange of gunfire is a sight to behold and the fights full of noisless realism. There is no gritty realism in this film; no blood and the owner of the Tavern Hotel gets shot at least three times with no ill effects. The storyline does run out of steam well before episode 12 and the episodes are somewhat repeatitive and even include the trick where the car goes over the cliff at the end of one episode with the hero apparently killed only for next week to show the same sequence with him leaping from the vehicle just before it bursts into flames. But who is the Black Ace and why are the Mystery Squadron trying to stop the Dam being built?

Well, you will have to watch right through to episode 12 to find out; however, by then you may not even care but you will have had 6 hours of excellent entertainment with lots of belly laughs for a bargain price.",1146960000,26,2575,4.555075593952484

1389761,4,B000053SNN,"In the 30's, there was something thrilling about stunt flying, dogfights in the air, and the like.  This 12 chapter serial captures all that with some notable B movie actors.  Tom Steele was prominent in westerns especially, as was Gunn ""Big Boy"" Williams who plays his sidekick.  J. Carrol Naish is prominent as one of the several very suspicious characters who could well be the principle bad guy.
There's lots of good aerial footage here featuring the old bi-planes, along with a lot of stunt footage.  As far as spotting the villain, well, that's fairly easy in a Mascot serial, but it's still lots of fun.  These were made to see one weekly chapter at a time, and if you can limit yourself to a chapter a day, you will get more of the olden day enjoyment out of this and any serial.",1046822400,4,787,4.475524475524476

1389763,5,B000053SNN,"you will like this serial if you like early cliffhanger serials, old movies from the early 30s, or lighthearted things and have a hard time finding stuff to watch.  if you have a hard time finding something to watch because you want something more wholesome or lighthearted that is not full of sex and violence then you will be forgiving and like this.  that said, however, this is the early 30s.  i am a more modern viewer who is a throwback who grew up with stuff that came out 50-55 years later.  but i am a forgiving viewer because it is hard to find something to watch and i base things on the writing most.  if you are like that then you will like this one.

i readily admit i am not Sherlock and i just watch stuff to relax or have fun.  i am not trying to show i am smart and guess who it is and tell everyone the fastest.  i let the writer tell the story.  so if people who like to solve the mystery watch this and feel it is easy to figure out you could still say the writer was detailed and that he kept it moving.  the other serials where you have to guess who the bad guy is, though i liked them all, had the pace and more straightforward back and forth of basketball in a half court set.

i originally bought this on VHS because someone said that the sound was better on VHS.  well, i have to say that i am forgiving, but the sound it is fine on Alpha's release on DVD if not better.  so i originally bought the one on VHS and thought my copy sounded funny.  well it was from 1933 and on VHS so i was doubtful about it.  it sounded warped.  well, its theme just has dated sounding music in parts.  and in the first chapter you will want to be patient in that one of the sound effects used for the plane diving and such is unusual but that was what they had then.  i was about to just not watch this at all because i thought the sound quality spooked me and turned me off.  having seen this on DVD, i would say that if you can be patient with that sound effect through the airshow scene which ends at the first half of chapter one then you will like this serial.

i read the list of serials on wikipedia in which it was classified as an ""aerial serial"" which made me think of WWI battles.  i don't like war stuff and this is not war here.  i had no idea that i would like an ""aerial serial"".  i recommend this little underdog serial to anyone. :)",1370390400,,2359,4.036637931034483
1389764,3,B000053SNN,i am updating my opinion on the audio quality of my VHS copy and upgrading it a star.  i bought this version specifically because someone said that the sound on the VHS copy was the best.  if you're like me you like the old stuff have a hard time hearing some things and know that the older stuff might have audio issues.  so i wanted to get the best copy even if it was on VHS and not DVD. i find it hard to trust the idea of giving something from 1933 on VHS anything but a short leash but i do want to watch stuff and if it is on VHS and the quality is ok then that's fine.  i think the audio is adequate but that people should understand a couple of things about this particular serial as it will impact their opinion of audio quality issues.  I think a definite issue is that the theme music that introduces each chapter sounds...like dated music maybe.  that made me think something was wrong.  it is unusual to me.  don't know what instrument one of those was or something.  i am trying to be forgiving here.  the other thing was the sound effect they kept making in the first chapter when they were flying and doing dives and such some of the time.  it made me think something was wrong; like it was warped or something.  it is a strange sounding effect.  there's no way anybody would have heard anything like that kind of sound effect.  i did buy it on DVD after not knowing this and that is why i can provide these comments.  it's not just that it's VHS and it's warped or whatever.  it's just unusual in brief parts for these reasons from what i've seen.  if you can be a little patient versus skittish and hang in there for half a chapter you might find that those things don't last that long compared with the whole thing when you are considering you are watching a long thing such as a serial.  i cannot give a review on the serial as a whole but from what i have seen (and mind you i don't know how it ends because sometimes that can be a cheat or disappointing or something) i would like it enough that i'd say that a copy like mine is ok for those who only have a VCR and who like the old stuff and are forgiving and have a hard time finding decent stuff to watch.  as far as my reviewing the serial i would recommend watching it so if you only have a VCR go ahead and get this one.  for those with a DVD player i will have to put up a review under that listing soon.,1366848000,,2384,4.075107296137339

Mascot's 1933 serial ""The Mystery Squadron"" is in their usual twelve chapters, directed by Colbert Clark and David Howard, who were also involved with the screenplay, otherwise written by Wyndham Gittens and Barney Sarecky, based on a story by Sherman Lowe and Al Martin.

Those who think Mascot's earlier serial from 1933, ""The Whispering Shadow,"" is ""12 chapters of boredom"" are advised to skip this one.  The pattern is exactly the same, only it isn't put together as well, the acting is generally worse and it depends more on the special effects, which are no better.  Footage from earlier chapters is frequently run as ""flashbacks,"" there is little plot development, and much of the action can be summed up as ""enter yet another bad guy through a secret panel, stage left.""  But those who appreciate the Mascot serials understand that these characteristics are part of the ""charm"" and the viewer shouldn't get too much of it at one sitting.

Two stunt flyers, Fred Cromwell (Bob Steele) and Bill ""Jellybean"" Cook (Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams) are hired by an old flying buddy, Hank Davis (Jack Mulhall) to help defend a power dam construction project from air attacks.  The project's contractor, Stephen Gray (Lafe McKee) has been getting notes warning him to stop construction, signed by ""The Black Ace.""  But even as Cromwell and Cook fly to the construction site, they are attacked by one of the Squadron's members, and are mistaken for being involved with the Mystery Squadron by Stephen Gray's daughter Dorothy (Lucile Browne) who had been following the evildoer in her 'plane.

A typical Mascot serial, with many people who might be ""The Black Ace,"" and when the mystery man is shot in the right arm, the condition becomes contagious; many suspects are found to have such wounds.  The hotel, where much of the action takes place, has plenty of secret passages familiar to most of the residents, including Doctor Flint (Robert Frazer), rival contractor Lafe Johnson (Purnell Pratt) and hotel owner Andrew Martin (Edward Peil, Sr.) all of whom have portable short-wave radios and could have been the voice heard commanding the Squadron.  Caught in an early chapter, with a bullet wound in his right arm, is construction superintendent Collins (J. Caroll Naish), who escapes more than once.  But he seems to be just an underling, along with familiar 'B' and serial-movie actors Hal Taliaferro, Bob Kortman, Jack Mower, Jack Perrin, Lloyd Whitlock, George Magrill and Richard Cramer.  While the action is often more than a little stagy, the comic elements are not excessive, Bob Steele and Guin ""Big Boy"" Williams have good rapport, and Lucile Browne does a lot more than needing to be rescued.  The flying scenes are the usual mixture of actual footage and models, the flame throwers used by The Mystery Squadron were an interesting idea, and while Mascot's model work wasn't terribly good, it's more convincing than what Universal used into the 1940's.

Video editions of this serial appear to be derived from the same source material, with some of the same splices and scratches, though certainly not from the same prints.

I'll start with the Serial Squadron's edition, still available from their website.  It was once distributed by Hermitage Hill, and copies may show up on Amazon under ASIN: B001EJHN1K, to which this review was originally linked.  It is on two single-layer DVD-R discs, and has far better image quality than the Alpha DVD or VCI's VHS tape.  While grain and occasional washout of highlights remain, the image is reasonably sharp and has good gray scale.  Unfortunately the action is not always smooth, most easily observed where the clouds in the background of the opening credits lurch along with a slight pause, about six times per second, likely a frame-rate conversion issue.  The effects of this depend on the speed of the action; for example the construction workers chasing our heroes in Chapter Three look something like an undercranked scene in a Keystone Kops film, though the running time is not changed.  Less effect is seen where the action is slower or very fast.  The other major issue is the Serial Squadron's sound processing, where ""hiss free"" was a primary criteria. Mid-range peaking, with sharp cut-off filtering of high and low frequencies is used, along with noise-floor clipping.  The frequency restriction does make the dialogue fairly clear, pulling it out of what is sometimes rather high background racket, but gives it an unnatural ""in a barrel"" quality usually associated with old telephones or acoustic recording, c. 1906, which causes other sounds to suffer.  Low-level noise clipping and the resonance due to the filtering produce a background ""gurgling"" racket, with footsteps on dry ground sounding like slogging through shallow water.  Sometimes low-level sounds are totally blanked, such as during the aftermath of a fire in Chapter Eleven, and when the sound comes back the low-level noise is made more obvious than if it had been there all along.

There are a few minor issues with the content, such as the redone ""next week"" titles that, while close to the originals in layout and fonts, don't have the chapter numbers spelled out, so we get ""Chapter 2"" instead of ""Chapter Two.""  As noted on the Serial Squadron's website, the print used for opening titles had ""Nat Levine Presents"" blanked out, as seen on some chapters of other video editions.  Some ""venetian blind"" artifacts occasionally appear, and a few ""sparkles,"" both possibly due to editing-induced interference with the scanning lines, but these are minor defects, and the amount of ""meddling"" is small.  Eric Stedman's copyright was put in place of the original, and the music mixed with the dialogue at the end of the last chapter wouldn't have been done by Mascot in 1934.  Other editions have the start of the title music of Mascot's next serial, ""The Lost Jungle"" just before ""The End"" appears; it was common for a short trailer to be inserted at this point.

The Serial Squadron includes a 2-minute clip from 1927 with stunt flyer Al Wilson which is quite impressive.

Grapevine's new (Jul 2017) edition, supplied on ""burned"" discs, has image quality similar to the Serial Squadron's DVD, with very good sharpness and detail.  It has even fewer problems with highlights burning out, especially in the chapter recap pictures, though the text is often slightly clipped by the edges of the screen.  My guess is that both editions are from the same source, but the Serial Squadron did a bunch of clean-up to correct film defects, while Grapevine did not, so there are end-of-reel cue marks, and also a number of areas of either deterioration or processing problems especially in Chapter One, though neither is a major distraction.  Unfortunately Grapevine's edition has the same slightly unsmooth motion seen in the Serial Squadron's DVD, likely a frame-rate conversion issue, but none of the ""venetian blind"" effects.  The sound has not been extensively ""enhanced"" which I feel is a great improvement over what the Serial Squadron did, but while the dialogue is usually easy enough to understand, it gets buried in the background racket during the first reel of Chapter Three.  The sound is also a fraction of a second out of sync with the picture in some of the chapters, noticeable mostly in Chapter One.  Some of the ""next week""  titles are replacements, done without any attempt to duplicate the fonts used in the originals.  My favorite minor bungle in these is at the end of Chapter Five, where the title announces ""Next Week  Chapter Four.""  The worst problem with Grapevine's release is that a couple chapters are missing short pieces that are present in the other editions.  Chapter Four starts without the first minute and 20 seconds of the ""overlap"" material, but a more serious omission is one of about the same length that includes an entertaining piece of nonsense near the end of Chapter Six where, in a ""flashback"" Gray is shown in a heated discussion with rival contractor Lafe Johnson, who uses the same expression that had just been used by the Black Ace, ""remember, you asked for it!""  The missing piece also included the voice of the Black Ace coming from Johnson's room, though that part shows up in the ""overlap"" at the start of the next chapter.  This, and some of the minor film defects suggest Grapevine's source print is the same one used in the 1980s by Video Yesteryear, in a pretty bad transfer from a PAL-format copy with the film run at 25 instead of 24 frames per second.  I don't hold this against Grapevine's edition, but it might help explain why both it and the Serial Squadron's have frame-rate conversion issues.

VCI's old VHS edition, #1762 was of more ordinary quality.  The image looked like it was from a print several generations of copy away from the original, the worst problem being that highlights wash out, including facial features especially on the still pictures with the chapter recaps.  Details are slightly blurred, and dark areas tend to be a little murky.  It's still watchable, and the action is smooth.  The opening titles usually include ""Nat Levine Presents"" along with Mascot's copyright notice, but there are obvious splices, showing the credits were assembled from several sources.  The transition to the chapter title is usually a little rough, and the ""next week"" titles often follow a short blank, though a surprising number of them are the originals.  The chapters seem to be very nearly the same length as those in the Serial Squadron's edition.  The sound has some noise, but it is free of processing artifacts; no odd gurgling and voices sound natural without odd echo effects.

Alpha's edition, # ALP 4970D is on a single disc.  The picture isn't even as good as VCI's, mostly looking a little ""oversharpened"" and a head-switch at the bottom of the frame shows it was transferred from videotape.  Chapter One is missing about ten seconds of the ""airshow"" footage, and the other chapters are generally a few seconds shorter than VCI's.  The opening and closing titles look like they are from the same source, but sometimes there is a generic ""next week"" title after the real one.  Sound quality isn't as good as VCI's, with high-frequencies rolled off and low level sounds blanked in some chapters, but still preferable to that of the Serial Squadron's edition.  Alpha puts their logo in a corner of the frame during the opening credits and ""next week"" titles, but keeps it turned off otherwise.

The DVD-R available from Sinister Cinema's website has an image showing better detail than either Alpha's or VCI's, though neither gray scale nor sharpness is as good as either Grapevine's or the Serial Squadron's editions.  And in a few places the picture burns out; brightness control is not what it should be.  The opening credits have some pieces missing and are pretty dark in some chapters, and there are only a couple fragments of the ""next week"" titles.  But the action is smooth, and the sound has reasonably good frequency response, along with the expected hiss and ""sprocket"" buzz.  A good alternative for those who don't mind the faults of existing prints, and in many ways easier to watch than the other editions.

Of the available editions from Amazon, most viewers will find Grapevine's preferable in most respects, despite the slighty jerky motion in some scenes and missing pieces in Chapters Four and Six.  I'm not sure that getting it in Blu-Ray is an improvement over the DVD, but the image quality is good enough to justify use of the format.  Those with the Serial Squadron's DVD who are not put off by the sound will not find much reason to get Grapevine's edition.  The Alpha DVD's image quality is fairly poor, and some players may not work with the double-layer DVD-Rs Alpha has been using lately.  Its main virtue is that it is inexpensive, and reasonably complete.  But regardless of the edition, leave some time between chapters, preferably a day or more so the ""flashbacks"" don't seem so redundant.",1346630400,5,12472,4.932535885167464
1389768,1,B000053SNN,"It was not at all memorable. There is a very good reason I never heard of this serial or the cast.  Neither the series or cast won any awards.  ""Surprise, surprise, surprise.""

none of these Saturday afternoon serials were particulary good. Captain Marvel was ok.  Batman stunk too.  Superman was good.",1345075200,,302,4.8431372549019605
1389769,5,B000053SNN,"I was born in 1941 so I was lucky enough to experience the birth of local and network television broadcasting. Our first TV came into our home in 1947 - a time when there was far more local programming than network shows.  Kids shows were a staple and it seemed as if the producers of those shows used the movie theater Saturday Matinee as their programming model.  Cartoons and Serials ruled and much of the content was from the late silent era and early sound era.  That is how I, as a child, first got to see ""The Mystery Squadron"".  I only recall seeing it once but it stuck with me so when I saw it was available on DVD I had to add it to my collection.

This Alpha Video release is their typical two disk set where there has been no restoration done to the films.  For that reason the video quality of the various chapters varies widely.  The sound, however, is a different matter,  It is very clear.

This film stars Bob Steele and Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams with Jack Mulhall in a key supporting role. Mulhall appeared in many serials mostly playing the hero role such as in ""Burn 'Em Up Barnes"", ""The Clutching Hand"" and others. Bob Steele (born Robert Bradbury) was the son of a movie director. Bob's dad often featured Bob in his films including a large number of westerns. ""Big Boy"" Williams is the side kick in this film but also went on to star in several westerns.  This film, despite taking place in the west,  is not a cowboy story.  Instead it is one of secret identities, sabotage, and daring aviation in bi-planes.

Seeing it again, after all these years, was still a treat.  Although these are not the greatest actors who ever emoted, this is a fun film packing a lot of adventure into each episode.",1325203200,,1718,4.3955696202531644
1389770,5,B000053SNN,"I must confess the last time I saw this was as a young boy in 1947 at our local YMCA in Ithaca,  NY.  All my buddies and I belonged to the ""Y"" and went there every Saturday morning to play on the indoor basketball court, to  swim, and to see an episode of a movie which went on forever.  My childhood friend and his wife came to visit me last week and we started talking about this time of our life.  All we could remember was a series of episodes called The Black Ace.  Well now I have found it.  All of us went every week, filled with anticipation of what the next episode would bring.  Nothing including rain or snow could keep us away from this every Saturday morning event.  We all thoroughly enjoyed each and every episode and were hungry for more when it finally ended 12 weeks later.  Luckily, at our YMCA, the staff always had the next weekly movie serials ready to go.  Now this Black Ace thing was as big to us as our weekly theater movies including Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, and Tarzan.  I was so enthused to find this I am ordering it for both me and my friend.  And that my friends is from a 72 year old drummer who is still playing in Las Vegas today.  It must be the kid in me.",1305417600,2,1191,4.077586206896552

7929967,5,B000053SNN,"I am so happy that The Mystery Squadron made it to Blu-ray.  It is one of my favorite serials.  While it was probably one of the early serials, there is a maturity of conception that makes it very attractive.  The acting is great.  Bob Steele is wonderful.  The plot is well done.  The primitive flying that undergirds this serial is well done and really adds to the suspense and terror!
Unlike some of the later serials, there is a good sense of adventure and suspense which happens because the script was well-written and wonderfully executed by the actors and actresses.
  While I don't remember seeing this in my childhood, it brings back my childhood when I see this.  Again, I love this serial and am very happy for the good quality of it that Blu-ray brings.  Thank you!",1525132800,,777,4.565217391304348
