8304535,1,B001G9CNOU,"Based on the best selling novel by Zola! Is that a selling point?
Our own MARTINE CAROL was a French star of the fifties who had some box office draw, due to her usual revealing clothes, rather than any acting talent. Don't expect anything erotic from that kind of film which we call a ""navet"" (turnip), a ""nanard"" being an affectinate word. That fourth version, or fifteenth, version of a novel of questionable interest (if you are not a postgraduate student condemned to find great merit in it) is BORING. The fifties were the nadir of French filmmaking and the great CHARLES BOYER can't save that picture directed by CHRISTIAN-JAQUE who goes back to the early thirties. His best known, and best movie is FANFAN THE TULIP, with GERARD PHILIPPE and GINA LOLLOBRIGIDA and the great NOEL ROQUEVERT, always reliable as a civilian or military martinet. It is a comedy set during the 7 year war (in fact a terrible butchery). He directed many films starring FERNANDEL, usually not worthy of the actor's comic genius; LA SYMPHONIE FANTASTIQUE 1941 a super boring movie based on the life of BERLIOZ, starring the CLAUDEL actor, infuriating JEAN LOUIS BARRAULT.LUCRECE BORGIA 1953 and MADAME DU BARRY with the same MARTINE CAROL showing some shy flesh., plus ADORABLES CRATURES 1952, not a bad movie with extra help from DANIELLE DARRIEUX and the remarkable EDWIGE FEUILLERE. If you think of CAROL in LOLA MONTES who is supposed to be a classic, I leave you with that pretentious opus. Another CAROL movie, NATHALIE 1957,not bad, and FERNANDEL movie, LA LOI C'EST LA LOI 1958,quite good ,also starring the great Italian actor TOTO, then a huge box office hit BABETTE S'EN VA-T-EN GUERRE 1959, a comedy in very poor taste set during WWII,  with dialogue by the justly celebrated MICHEL AUDIARD who laid an egge with that one (a golden egg for him. The last film was LA VIE PARISIENNE 1977, supposedly from OFFENBACH, a very tired thing.
He died in 1994, having helmed more than 60 movies.
So I ask the question: why NANA? Is that an anti-French plot?",1228176000,3,2042,4.784702549575071
