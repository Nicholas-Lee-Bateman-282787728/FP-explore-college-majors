Like, when they have just made Love a few minutes before and she says ""let's do it again and this time leave IT in me!""
Everything the other people have said is true and my advice is to watch it & judge for yourself! You won't be disaapointed.",1070582400,,424,4.182926829268292
1333140,5,B00003UC8T,"After watching Claude Berri's ""Jean de Florette,"" and ""Manon of the Spring,"" I became a true fan. ""Lucie Aubrac"" just confirms my belief in Monsieur Berri's talents as a major director, and a discerning producer, in cinema today.
Set in Lyon, during the French Resistance in World War II, ""Lucie Aubrac,"" played brilliantly by Carole Bouquet, is a woman struggling to save her husband from the hands of the Gestapo. The film is based on a true story, and Madame Aubrac's memoir, ""Outwitting The Gestapo.""
Raymond Aubrac (Daniel Auteuil), is a Resistance fighter in occupied Lyon, and has participated in many acts of sabotage against the Nazis. When he is captured by the Gestapo, headed by the notorious Klaus Barbie (""The Butcher Of Lyon""), he and his companions are believed to be dealing in black market goods, and not sabotage. Lucie, five months pregnant, is terrified that she, their small son, and the new baby will never see Raymond again. With tremendous courage, she sets out, single handedly, to rescue her husband.
Claude Berri directs this thriller, love story, and historical drama with great skill. Part of the film's beauty lies in its simplicity. This is not the history of the French Resistance. It is the personal story of one woman's courage. Everyday life in Lyon, street scenes, people going about their business in wartime France, are juxtaposed with the mortally dangerous activities of Resistance fighters, and with Lucie plotting her husband's escape. The love between Lucie and her husband is palpable, and her determination and intelligence are extraordinary. The scenes where she meets with Gestapo Chief Barbie are tension-packed. And there are no words to describe the emotion evoked when Lucie meets her imprisoned husband and pretends she does not know him .
Carole Bouquet perfectly captures Lucie's fierce determination, patriotism, and passionate love, in an understated manner. Here is a woman with an all important task to accomplish, and she will do what needs to be done to perform the task successfully. There is no time, or energy, to spare on excessive displays of emotion. No room for dramatics. She is focused. Daniel Auteuil, as the exhausted, middle-aged Raymond, fighting to survive torture and imprisonment, expresses more with a look, than many can with pages of dialogue.
I highly recommend this moving film. I know that I will watch it again.",1059523200,10,2395,5.096692111959287
1333141,3,B00003UC8T,"Claude Berri has made some excellent pictures among them the crime masterpiece Tchao Pantin(1985) which I still think is his best. He also made the highly celebrated Jean de Florette & its companion piece Manon of the Spring. Lucie Aubrac is good, certainly much better than Charlotte Gray as French Resistance films go, but its not a masterpiece. Carole Bouquet does a splendid job with her role but other than being brave and beautiful theres not much role there. Daniel Auteuil plays Bouquets husband and the pair have one child and another on the way nonetheless these two hold high positions in the Resistance. Auteuil is on the screen much of the time but his role is simply that of prisoner waiting to be freed, he is an excellent actor perhaps France's best, but this is not one of his more challenging roles. All we really know about this couple is that they are in love and will stop short of nothing to be together. Other reviewers may say this is not a Hollywood project but its a love story with an ending that would be called a Hollywood ending if it weren't for the fact that this story happens to be true. The real life characters were no doubt brave and fascinating people but the film just doesn't go deep enough into their lives nor does it go deep enough into the complexities of the political differences among the various French Resistance leaders to achieve any kind of points for depth. The supporting players are just there to lend a hand to the couple. Competent, though uninspired, film making.",1044144000,3,1521,4.637037037037037
1333142,5,B00003UC8T,"This is a real film about real people - and the original Aubracs were literally real people.
Ditto to everything Paul said. I would just like to add a few details in the hope of increasing people's awareness of what this French warrior goddess actually achieved. (I honoured Lucie with a significant mention in my first book.)
The film is wonderful, but in some ways it is a simplified version of the actual events - especially the ending.
Lucie Aubrac was five months pregnant when she planned and led a successful raid on the Nazi convoy that was taking her husband to his place of execution.
After the rescue, the Aubracs were hidden by loyal comrades for three months until an RAF covert operations aircraft could be sent to retrieve them.
On the night of their escape, the plane, which I believe was a Lockheed Hudson, became stuck in the mud of the landing field, with dawn and the Nazi patrols only a few hours away.
FIFTY local villagers risked their own lives to come to the aid of their beloved Resistance friends and soon the plane was pushed free.
Lucie's daughter was born only a few days after their safe arrival at a British airbase. Her courage and leadership drew praise from battle-hardened Resistance soldiers and RAF aircrews of the elite Moon Squadron.
This film is about true French spirit. About a people who would never surrender, never stop fighting, who helped countless Allied airmen escape back to England, and who eventually liberated Paris even without Allied help. That my friends, is what the real French are like.
A magnificent film.",1024963200,8,1566,4.761029411764706

7919455,4,B00003UC8T,"While not on a par with Berris remarkable 2 film epic Jean de Florette and Manon of the Spring, this is a fairly engrossing, romantic, if somewhat romanticized true story of a married pair of resistance fighters in WWII France. Both Daniel Auteil and Carole Bouquet are solid as the couple, especially in their scenes together, which nicely capture the erotic tension of a married couple deeply in love, whose passion is not just physical, but fed by the fact they admire each other as human beings as well.  Its also nice to see a war film where the woman pulls off the heroics to try and save her man, rather than the other way around.

But the darkness of occupied France seems a but sanitized here, the awful price paid by those fighting back and their innocent families is alluded too but never fully dealt with, and there is something a bit light weight about it in the end.  Bouquet keeps everything so hidden when not around Autiel that she becomes somewhat opaque.

Its always interesting, but a bit stolid. Rarely truly tense, frightening or emotional.  Still its a good, decent, involving film, if not  a great one.

Odd that this well regarded and popular film is missing a region 1 release.",1385769600,,1203,4.619718309859155
7919456,5,B00003UC8T,"I received Lucie Aubrac VHS version from Westy-1 - there was a glitch (it may have been my VHS Player)- anyway, everything is resolved and Westy-1 I would like to give a five star referral to for their understanding and actions.
The film is, of course, a French classic and a true story which is uplifting and inspiring.
I hope you enjoy it as much as we do.

7919457,5,B00003UC8T,"I stumbled on this film just after it was released, attracted, as I was, by the two stars, Daniel Auteuil and Carole Bouquet. It tells the story of the French Resistance during the German occupation and focuses on the efforts of Lucie Aubrac, who actually authorized its filming in 1997, a school teacher in Lyon who outwitted the Nazis in her attempts to release her husband from a notorious prison after he had been accused of a lead role in the Resistance. Among the true-to-life characters in the film is Klaus Barbie, the ""Butcher of Lyon,"" played by a fearsome actor who accurately portrays the thuggishness of the top Nazi in Lyon. Also portrayed is Jean Moulin, the leader of the Resistance, who was tortured and then killed by the Nazis (many streets, town squares, schools and other public buildings are named after him). I show this film to my French 2 classes every spring around D-Day (6th of June) and the kids are enthralled by it as well as by the history involved. It is not available in the U.S. in DVD format, but the VHS product is very clear (French, with English sub-titles).",1277424000,,1097,4.630769230769231
7919458,5,B00003UC8T,"Lucie Aubrac is a delirious, absorbing and engaging drama in the middle of the bloody WW2. this was a true story of Lucie and Raymond Aubrac, when at the outbreak of the War, this couple decides to join the French Resistance. Raymond is Jewish, and is captured by the nazis and condemned to death. But she will risk her life to make a smart plan to liberate him.

Carole Boucquet and Daniel Auteil make a solid and effective team in a tour de force and towering performance, that, supported by this driving force director- Claude Beeri (Germinal, Jean de Florette)  make a worthy to collect movie.",1191024000,,597,4.622641509433962

7919460,5,B00003UC8T,"When we think romance in film...we think of the classics (Greta Garbo, Vivian Leigh, etc).  This story of passion between a man and a woman is entirely different. The female heroine simply won't accept the Nazi's execution order for her husband (who was captured in a sting against the French resistance).  Therefore, she takes every step imaginable to free him...and succeeds. Now that's love!",1139961600,2,394,5.140625
7919461,2,B00003UC8T,"I have an extremely high regard for French cinema in general, but ""Lucie Aubrac"" reminds me of formula War Weepies made in the U.S.; nothing special about it. Guess I've been spoiled by superb films like ""Ridicule"" or ""Mr. Hire,"" but I expect far more from a French film than ""Lucie Aubrac"" delivers. I wish I didn't have to say so, but ""Lucie Aubrac"" almost looks ""made for TV"" and reminds me of yet another example of extraordinary actors trapped in an all-too-ordinary movie with an uninspired screenplay that tells the story in a workmanlike fashion. It's not a ""bad"" film. It's not a good one, either. Lucie Aubrac's story deserves better.",1116288000,2,644,4.758928571428571
7919462,5,B00003UC8T,"Daniel Auteuil has a hidden sexiness that bursts out in this film!  This is based on a true story of a French women that helps her husband escape from a Nazi death sentence so that they can keep a promise they made to each other, to make love to each other every year on their anniverary.
It is a powerful drama that not even Hollywood could make.  The French are progressive filmmakers that far surpasses the formulaic fluff that is generated by the Hollywood studios. The Hollywood moguls think that American movie-goers cannot think for themselves in the theater.
Great film that all should see.  It should not be remade but seen in this version!!!!",1084924800,4,652,4.6521739130434785
