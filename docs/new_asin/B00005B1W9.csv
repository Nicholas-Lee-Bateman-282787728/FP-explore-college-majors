1419829,1,B00005B1W9,"The somewhat charming presence of Billy Connolly notwithstanding, ""Beautiful Joe"" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I took the DVD out from the public library; I should have known.
The story cannot be dumber: Joe, a florist originally from Dublin and recently living in the Bronx (my hometown!), finds his wife banging the plumber, after he finds out he's got a brain tumor, so he heads off to find some adventures.  He meets Alice (Sharon), who's basically this trashy woman with two kids (one mulatto and the other silent), at the race tracks, and immediately falls in love with her.  How believable!  How adventurous.  Anyway, Joe goes off to talk some sense into local hooligan and loan shark George the Geek, who mistakes Joe for a famous Manhattanian-Irish hitman Beautiful Joe (who turns out to be Joe's drinking buddy Happy). When George finds out the truth, he's set on killing both Joe and Alice.  So JOe and Alice take the kids and flee.
The rest of the film gets even more boring and predictable.  The movie pretends to be a romance story, but there's very little chemistry between the two main actors.  Sharon puts up incredibly bad acting here.  Alice says, ""oh I'm growing fat and old,"" and that's exactly how the formerly-lovely Sharon looks in the film.  That's not even one-tenth of the problem if not for her poor performance.  It's evident that this is not a role she wanted.  She's in either for the money, or to fulfill some studio contract.  The two kids are annoying, to say the least.  When the boy Lee talks toward the end, after Joe rescues Alice from the gansters in Vegas and realizes that Happy (Beautiful Joe) is just a mob associate of his ex-father-in-law, the head of the Irish crime family (Joe wasn't aware of it), Lee philosophizes about life by quoting from a bunch of TV talk shows and the stupidity of this scene just totally stunned me.  I never thought Hollywood could come out with something so utterly brainless.  In the end, Joe gets a successful surgery and, guess what, lives happily ever after with ex-trashy woman and her two abnormal kids.
This is just absolutely one of the worst movies ever made.",1065484800,4,2158,4.684350132625995
1419830,2,B00005B1W9,"Before her 2 year hietus due to illness, Sharon Stone stared in this romantic comedy with Billy Connolly, as a single mother called ""Hush,"" whose life is full of messy relations with men and gambling.  The film is directed by Stephern Metcalfe, and is the first job as director, who has been working as scriptwriter in Hollywood.  But you will be impressed with somebody else.
The film is, in fact, about an amiable Irishaman living in America named Joe, who is effectively played by Billy Connolly, best known for the film ""Mrs. Brown"" opposite Judi Dench.  Joe, seeing that his life as a good-natured flowerist is too boring, decides to travel, and meets Hush.  After several misadventures including horse-racing, mud-wrestling, and an encounter with local mobsters (Gil Bellows, TV's ""Ally McBeal"" and Ian Holm as his boss), Hush comes to like him, so does Joe, among the kids whose life has been so far neglected by Hush.
The best thing you can find about ""Beautiful Joe"" is Billy Connolly's amicable portrayal of Joe, who fares among the clithed moments better than you expect.  We can understand that people around him all like him, as the film depicts.  Even Ian Holm's Hannibal-like caricature of gangster looks funny before Connolly's incredibly innocent talk, and there are some good moments in the film,  especially when those veteran actors are allowed to do some tricks before us.
But too bad that no one among the crew seems to have pointed out that this kind of film fails to interest us when it looks as if going automatically.  I do not see why Joe should fall for Hush, who treats him very bad at first, and keeps on chasing her.  The gangster plot is too familiar after our seeing films such as ""Life Less Ordinary"" or ""Get Shorty"" and many, many others, and the inclusion of kids is also too clithed.  Or, if I may sound too harsh, let me say that at least they should have give them (kids) more decent dialogues.
Sharon Stone seems miscast at first, but actually her acting is not so bad as you may think.  It is rather her constant change of hair-styles and costumes that annoys us, making us wonder why these changes are needed.  Actually, she was much better in the similar role in ""The Mighty"" (and duely nominated for Golden Globe), but here her heavy make-ups look as if to show the lack of confidence.  They should not have done that.
As a whole, ""Beautiful Joe"" is a disappinting film because of its lack of originality and confidence.  So, why gangsters?  The film has one saving grace Billy Connolly which they should have used more effectively.",1050883200,4,2576,4.693333333333333
1419831,4,B00005B1W9,"It seems to me that almost everyone who writes or directs a movie these days throws gangsters into the potpourri of their films. And I do mean that exact word ""throws."" This is otherwise a very human scale romantic comedy and drama vehicle very ably acted by Sharon Stone, as a woman in need of rescue from a life lived too close to the edge, and Billy Connolly, a rock of a man beloved by all. They are an unlikely pairing but it works. The jist of their plot is whether Stone's character can finally settle down with a worthwhile guy (Joe) instead of the marginal losers she normally ends up with. Then there is the whole gangster subplot which involves gangsters after both Stone and Connolly with reasoning and results so convoluted that all you can do is groan when they come onscreen again. Maybe these movies get financed when the producers hear the word ""gangsters."" I can come up with no other reason why they are being inserted into every other film I am seeing these days.

1419832,3,B00005B1W9,"Though likable in many ways, ""Beautiful Joe"" is one of those maddeningly inconsistent movies in which the plot keeps getting in the way of the finer elements of the picture.  Here we have a film that is far more effective in its moments of quiet contemplation than the moments in which it indulges in grand melodramatic gestures.  The latter do not happen frequently enough to actually kill the picture, but you can't accuse them of not trying.
Writer/director Stephen Metcalfe has concocted a screenplay that is part romantic comedy, part ""road movie"" and part petty gangster picture.  The mixture never really jells.  The film focuses around a sweet, good-natured, hopelessly optimistic Irish immigrant so beloved in his heavily ethnic Bronx neighborhood that his neighbors have affectionately nicknamed him ""Beautiful Joe.""  One day Joe is informed by his doctor that he has a potentially life threatening brain tumor.  Conveniently for purposes of the plot, Joe also happens to discover on that day (though everyone else seems to have long known it) that his slatternly wife has been cheating on him.  This frees him up to load his van and set out in search of the adventure he never really experienced in his peaceful but humdrum existence.  While in Kentucky, he meets ""Hush"" Mason, a down-on-her-luck gambler and exotic dancer with two children who also happens to be involved with a parcel of petty gangsters led by one ""George the Geek"" whose sadism emerges in his various dealings with Joe, Hush, her children and his own loyal henchmen.
""Beautiful Joe"" is at its best when it concentrates on the quiet moments that occur between these two oddball people - one a rock of stability, sanity and virtue in a cruel, chaotic world and the other a mess of insecurities, weaknesses and vulnerabilities who needs someone like Joe to help pull her out of that world.  When Sharon Stone and Billy Connolly share screen time together (along with Jurnee Smollett and Dillon Moen who play her children), the film is believable and touching.  However, Metcalfe seems unwilling to leave well enough alone because he has injected into the film a truly awful subplot involving a group of bumbling gangsters who manage to bring the film crashing down every time they appear in a scene.  Luckily for us and for the film, they disappear through long stretches of the movie's running time, allowing time for us to concentrate on the individuals at the story's core.  Even here, however, some of the plot details seem unnecessarily hokey and distracting, such as Hush's son's refusal to talk being overcome at the last minute - an obvious device to squeeze as many tears out of the audience as is legally possible.  Indeed, the whole final act overindulges itself on syrupy sentiment.
Connolly and Stone are both excellent in their roles, Connolly appearing strong, compassionate and virtuous all at the same time, while Stone displays just the right amount of feistiness and vulnerability to make her character ring true and likable.
A pity Metcalfe doesn't demonstrate the discipline of tone and plotting necessary to make this film a total triumph.  But for the elements that are good in it - and they are indeed manifold - ""Beautiful Joe"" is a film that deserves to be seen and enjoyed.",994896000,,3278,4.9363636363636365
1419833,4,B00005B1W9,"I was delightfully surprised to see Sharon Stone and Billy Connolly in a movie together. An unlikely match, you say! But the story and plot were superb! Billy has toned down his humor, but it shines through. Sharon was an excellent love interest for him. He plays his role with tenderness, humor, bravado, and extreme likability. She has a role which is not typical for her, nevertheless a good one. I highly recommend watching this movie.",991785600,4,439,4.7894736842105265

7936283,4,B00005B1W9,"Average guy who was diagnosed with a brain tumor comes home to find his wife in the act with the plumber. She boldly tells her husband she wants a divorce as  he is boring and that she wants the house, the car, and half the money. He leaves town and sets out on ""adventure"" winding up in Louisville on his way to SF. While in Louisville he meets up with a slutty single mom (whose mothered the two kids from different fathers--one is in Leavenworth and the other kid's father she isn't sure about) who is always on the take--always trying to strike it rich. Her loan sharks are after her.

First off Sharon Stone surprised me. She did a great southern accent--a regional southern accent--for this movie. Some people think they are doing a southern accent by mocking southerners. This was not such a performance. She was also mostly convincing as the self-centered floozy type. However, there were a few flashes of the over-the-top Sharon Stone we all are a little afraid of not to mention cringe at. I'll never forget seeing her on Oprah back in the 90s claiming she knew people who were ""cured of AIDS"". Oprah even threw here a life raft a couple of times. But not Sharon. She clung to her fantasy world--I'm-a-24-7-actress sensational nonsense. Of course the press just gave her a pass and buried the story. Anywho, this movie tried to be a quirky Winn-Dixie type of movie . . . . But it just didn't make it there. It showed up at the door but just didn't quite get invited to the party. The Julie Sugarbaker liberal nonsense speech from the one kid at the end was just comical when it  was supposed to be the epiphany moment. The one Thelma and Louise scene about the gun stood out like some liberal at a Family Values summit. It was almost like some writer, actor, director, etc on the set was allowed to just ram into the middle of the movie some ""teachable liberal moment"" on gun control. It just didn't make any sense. The ending before the ending that cleared up who ""Beautiful Joe"" was was supposed to be a wow moment. Sorry, I am just not into the glorification of mobs,mafia, mafiosos, gangsters, etc. They are murderers, not icons. Another let down. And the real ending could have been very touching. But either that British/Irish/Welsh actor guy who played Joe was allowed to ruin it with his over-acting, milking-it moment or some director messed it up. If they had re-shot that they would have had a hit on their hands. Anyway, despite the weird moments the over all movie was watchable and entertaining. I actually turned it off as it was getting too late. And I turned it back on the next day to see ""what happened"".",1411776000,,2633,4.515723270440252

7936285,5,B00005B1W9,I have rented or bought a lot of Billy Connolly's movies beginning with Mrs. Brown (which is what got me addicted to him) and this movie showcases his excellent acting ability.

7936289,4,B00005B1W9,"This 2000 black comedy from the United Kingdom began as if it were going to be a tearjerker, but with the right touch came off as an inspirational film where two people find each other at difficult moments and eventually happiness.  Billy Connolly, the world famous comic from Glasgow, and sexy Sharon Stone comprise the initial odd couple that in the end fulfill each other's needs.

Connolly's plight is far more tragic than Stone's in that he is handed a potential death sentence by his New York City doctor.  At the very time that he needs sympathy and understanding he comes home and finds his wife sharing his bed with another man.  She tells him bluntly about her intention to seek a divorce because she finds him totally boring.  He does not tell her what he has just heard from his doctor.

The scene then shifts to Churchill Downs in Kentucky, where Connolly has gone to gain a needed change of scenery.  He is betting on the races and doing it foolishly, without any semblance of strategy.  Horseplayer Sharon Stone sees him there.  After latching on to him as a potential means of helping her financially, she gives him up when he hands all his track winnings to two nuns, causing her to conclude that he is a loser as she walks him away and leaves him standing in the distance watching her.

Connolly meets Stone again at the strip club where she formerly danced and now supervises.  He catches her at a bad time, when an old live in love that now works for the mob is seeking to obtain money she owes.  Eventually Connolly takes Stone home.  Just as she is again about to end their association she realizes what an effective housekeeper he is when she is at the club and that her two young children like him.

Just as Connolly, Stone, and the two children are making very much like a family a problem ensues and the mob is in hot pursuit.  For one thing, the local Kentucky mob boss played by Ian Holm has mistaken Connolly for a famous New York syndicate head, has let him off the hook on the debt, and has angered his superiors.  Gil Bellows does a superb job of playing the highly incompetent former love of Stone who invests the role of enforcer with Inspector Clousseau comedic clumsiness.  Holm is plenty clumsy himself and the film is one that focuses on comic deficiencies of the mob figures rather than ruthless and violent efficiency.

The Kentucky mob ultimately pursues Connolly and Stone to Las Vegas after she has told her girlfriend where she is going, never dreaming that she will report back to her enemies.  Eventually the pair will find happiness after some unique surprise twists involving the mob figures.

Stephen Metcalfe wrote a fine script and directed as well.  He deftly spun two character arcs in the film, that of Connolly abandoning his former cautiously boring demeanor as he becomes associated with Stone.  At the same time, Stone, while bringing Connolly out, admires his stable qualities and tones down her erratic conduct and savage temper.",1107043200,4,2989,4.653333333333333
