4217092,2,B003XL01T8,"Poor Piper Laurie--Oscar-nominated for her deliciously demented turn as Margaret White in ""Carrie"" then sinking to new lows in this 1977 dud that doesn't know whether it wants to be ""The Exorcist"" or ""Carrie II"".

In 1935 Florida, Ruby Claire (Laurie) goes into labour in the wetlands as she witnesses her mobster boyfriend Nicky (Sal Vecchio) gunned down by members of his own gang. This traumatic event sends the pregnant Ruby into labour.

Flash-forward to 1951 and Ruby's now running a drive-in movie theatre (where the only film that seems to play is ""Attack of the 50-Foot Woman"") with help from those same murdering gangsters who offed her lover. Immediately, we see one of the goons attacked by a reel of film and strangled to death (You've seen better special effect on ""Bewitched"" really). Vince (Stuart Whitman) is her right-hand man whom she orders to get rid of the bodies once they start piling up. He's also responsible for summoning parapsychologist Dr. Keller (Roger Davis) after two more men (including ""Seinfeld""'s Uncle Leo, Len Lesser) turn up dead. Ruby becomes incensed when she discovers the good Doc is there to contact Nicky's spirit; she thought he was summoned to help with her 16-year-old mute daughter (Janit Baldwin), whom Ruby wants to institutionalize. We also learn Ruby has never let go of the guilt over Nicky dying thinking she set him up.

Ruby has a shrine to the late Nicky as well as a big stage in the  dance hall where she likes to relive her glory days as a singer. Another inhabitant in her mansion is the elderly, mysterious wheelchair-bound Jake.

Halfway-through the film, an Excorcist-like scene occurs as Nicky contacts Ruby through his daughter's body. These scenes are the most interesting of the film, as is the big moment when Ruby reveals what she's been hiding in that mysterious pickle jar.

The script is half-baked and not very cohesive. The kills are neither scary nor well-executed. Most of the drive-in scenes however, contain some clever black comedy by way of a floozie named Lila-June, who makes it with anything in pants; and some funny lines delivered by the bit players.

Curtis Harrington has directed much better material than this supernatural mess. Some of the visuals are interesting, though; Ruby's lurid red bedspread, lampshades and curtains match her dresses and nail polish, etc.

Aside from the prologue, which looks gauzy and murky, the rest of the film looks great--bright, crisp and vivid. Too bad the script itself wasn't.

**NOTE: This double-bill DVD with ""Kiss of the Tarantula"" does not contain a commentary by Piper Laurie for ""Ruby"" which appeared on a previous release of the disc by VCI.

4217094,3,B003XL01T8,"Was hoping VCI would remaster this horror classic from '77 RUBY...but NOOOO!! This is the same re-tread of an earlier release (minus the good commentary with Piper Laurie and the director). Non-anamorphic, over matted fuzzy print that looks to have been filmed from a drive-in screen. This classic deserves better! I am not talking Criterion treatment or anything (hell even bad movies get better transfers!) but come on...this is barely watchable! Don't know if cramming two movies on one disc had anything to do with it. Just seems like the earlier VCI release of RUBY actually looked better. It's a shame.
I won't even comment on the terrible second feature...except it's anamorphic widescreen!! And it's an older movie! What is up with this??
Never expected VCI to raise their standard on their DVD transfers, it is sad to see their classics of all their titles being mistreated like this (especially WHIP AND THE BODY-this is one that cries for remastering).
Anyway, if considering purchasing RUBY look for the earlier release<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ruby/dp/B00005J765/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ruby</a>&nbsp;at least it has a good commentary on it! Piper Laurie is always fun to listen to...

8408249,3,B003XL01T8,"Was disappointed about the movie Ruby.  Wasn't what I had expected.  As for the other movie.....I am sure I will like it (haven't had a chance to watch it yet).  I completely HATE spiders and it will add to the creepiness during Halloween time.  Wish that I could of gotten this half price because of me not liking Ruby very well.  Others may like both films, though.",1432252800,,367,4.417910447761194

8408252,1,B003XL01T8,"It's mind-boggling that VCI released RUBY on a single disc previously with extra features AND in the proper anamorphic ratio, but for this double-feature disc they actually DOWNGRADED it and released not only a worse-looking copy but one that's widescreen but not anamorphic...WTF!?  It makes no sense because since I (and I'm sure others) already own KISS OF THE TARANTULA on it's single disc release, the only real reason to pick up this two-fer is for RUBY.  I think VCI must stand for Very Contemptuous Idiots.",1396051200,2,514,4.965116279069767

8408254,2,B003XL01T8,"Ruby was strictly a drive-in movie and disappeared after its brief release.  I was always curious about it because I'm a sucker for creepy suggestive rhymes in movie advertising.  ""Christened in blood.  Raised in sin.  She's sweet sixteen, let the party begin.""  Notice I said 'sucker', cause that's what I felt like after watching Ruby.  The main character, Ruby, for which the movie is named, is not sweet sixteen.  She's a middle aged alcoholic who is slightly deranged and lives in the past.  Her DAUGHTER is sixteen!  Her daughter does get possessed and does an imitation of Linda Blair's spider walk, but she's not the focus of the film.  I won't go into details about the plot (read the other reviewers).  I'll just say that I didn't have high expectations and I was still disappointed.  It's just not an engaging film.  And, don't believe these other guys, this is not a cult film.  It's never had a following.  It's just an oddball movie. It's a ghost story/gangster/demonic possession film.  If you were born after the seventies, I doubt this movie is going to interest you.  I give it two stars for being original.  I wanted to like it but I didn't care about anyone in this film.  And it was sad to see Roger Davis and Piper Laurie making this one last film before landing on the unemployment line.  They deserved better.

The second feature, Kiss of the Tarantula, is even more disappointing.  Really cool poster ad, but this is really a dumb movie.  It's about a teenager who doesn't fit in and gets back at her peers by using her pet tarantulas.  Yes, tarantulas are creepy but do they really cause people to have heart attacks and just drop dead without any attempt to flick them off?  And the two couples that meet their demise at the drive-in is one of the dumbest things I have ever watched.  There's these two couples making out heavily while the movie is playing.  Our lead character manages to open the door to the car without anyone noticing and fill it with about a dozen of her pet tarantulas.  The couples are making out so heavily that they don't notice the tarantulas crawling all over them.  Then, they notice, and scream, and go into a panic.  One gets his neck crushed on the steering wheel, one girl get almost decapitated by trying to break through the window, and the other guy gets crushed between the car and the speaker pole.  The sole survivor is so traumatized she can't tell the police what happened.  You can watch this scene and laugh at how jaw-droppingly stupid it is, I suppose.  That's totally legitimate.  I just felt like my intelligence was insulted by watching this pathetic fiasco.  I watched the rest of the movie in fast forward and was sorry I had wasted my time on it.

I sold this disc back to Amazon.

You want some good drive-in movies from the seventies?  Try Tombs of the Blind Dead, House of Dark Shadows, The House That Dripped Blood, Tenebrae, The Vault of Horror, The Abominable Dr. Phibes, and Suspiria,",1369958400,2,2968,4.604206500956023
