Remember all those post-apocolyptic mad maxish low budgeters of the early eighties (you know, the ones when every low budget filmaker had the 'bad guys' running around  in gas masks)?  Here's one.  But it's not limited to that though.  Basically the film goes through various story points, practically creating  small 'episodes'.
Most contain x-file-ish type propaganda, but there  are variances.
The film has to be one of the lowest budget looking  films I have seen a a long time.  At some points it looks like I could have  filmed better than the makers with my drunken friends.  Some funny parts  are when one of the characters is standing on the street corner, and every  one else is walking backwards!  Obvious editing issue, it either was  intended to draw out the scene, or something.  Strange.
I have to say I  enjoyed it just for the fact that it was different.  But it wasn't really  any good.  Even Debbie Rochon doesn't fill this one up with  excitement.
The Sam Kinison-type guy was a blast though.",956880000,2,1050,4.754189944134078
