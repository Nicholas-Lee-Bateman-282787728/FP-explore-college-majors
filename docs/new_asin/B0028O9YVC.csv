This is an example of the fact that when you turn Jennifer Jones loose with no director holding her back she can give over doing it a whole new meaning. She was simply too old for the role, past her first beautiful bloom so to speak.  It was nice to see Karl Malden when he was younger and his nose was either smaller or at least appeared smaller.  This could have been a good story if some restraint had been used on it.  As it turned out, it just became ridiculous.  Charlton Heston played himself as he always does.  His roles are interchangeable as they are always the same.  As they say - You know the expression he had on his face, the only one he has. Well, that's the one he had on his face. I will say this - The film has been nicely transferred to DVD and looks very good.",1406246400,,848,4.072289156626506
