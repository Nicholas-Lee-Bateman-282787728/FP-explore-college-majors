2333214,4,B0009X770O,"I was prepared to be disappointed but hopeful that Universal would do a good job with this set. While it isn't perfect, this collection of classic Hammer films (and some not so-classic ones as well)looks pretty good in this DVD transfer. Although ""Brides of Dracula"" and ""Curse of the Werewolf"" don't look as stunning as the ""Horror of Dracula"" (or ""Revenge of Frankenstein"")each appears in what appears to be the correct aspect ratio. Universal evidently used notes with the prints indicating the original theatrical aspect ratio (at least for the U.S.)much as Warner did with ""The Mummy"" and ""Horror of Dracula"". There aren't any extras to speak of but the image quality is solid. There's grain evident in most of these DVD transfers but all of that can't be attributed to the transfer itself as these were shot on stock that was grainy to begin with. Older DVD players (and some newer ones as well)may have a problem playing some of these discs. Evidently there are reports (again) that these Universal discs can cause some players to freeze and lock up the DVD players which is related to a manufacturing issue related only to dual layered discs. These discs would have looked terrific on single layered releases or on single sided dual layered releases. The reason these are being released like this is due to $$. Luckily, so far I haven't had a problem but I thought the same thing with some of the other Universal releases and found out otherwise much later.

""Brides of Dracula"" has a misleading title. Dracula doesn't appear at all instead this film focuses on Van Helsing's (Peter Cushing) efforts to rid a village of a young vampire that has been inadvertantly released by a young woman. Although the script isn't quite as strong as ""Horror of Dracula"", the film has a number of memorable set pieces. Evidently beyond the four screenwriters credited, Anthony Hinds also had a hand in the script (as did Cushing and Fisher much later) as he had to tone down the film for the British censors prior to production. In Sangster's original screenplay Dracula makes an appearence at the end of the film to punish Meinster. One of the last Hammer films shot by the marvelous Jack Asher, ""Brides"" looks great on DVD.

""Curse of the Werewolf"" features Oliver Reed in the title role. Set in Spain, Reed plays Leon a young man adopted when his mother a mute servant girl dies giving birth. We know very little about the father except that the girl was raped. As a youth Leon exhibits the traits of the werewolf while hunting and the curse continues to haunt him as he grows older.

The colors are bright and vivid. Terence Fisher's direction is sharp as usual and the film is one of the more ""adult"" Hammer films dealing with a number of complex themes. Reed doesn't show up until about 40 or so minutes into the movie. Featuring an unusual rich score by Benjamin Frankel(""Night of the Igauna"") and a chrismatic, powerful performance by Reed, ""Curse"" would be one of the few Hammer films to visit the legend of the werewolf. Bizarrely, Yvonne Romain plays Reed's mother in this while Reed romances her in ""Night Creatures"". Romain would have her last film role as Sheila in the classic mystery film ""The Last of Sheila"".

""The Evil of Frankenstein"" allowed Hammer to adapt Jack Pierce's classic monster make up for this film when Universal agreed to finance it. Cushing plays the doctor once again. It's one of the lesser Frankenstein films and the only one featuring Cushing not directed by Terry Fisher. While it isn't the best of the Frankenstein films, Freddie Francis (cinematography on one of my favorite classic horror films ""The Innocents"" and other films such as ""The Elephant Man"". Director of horror classics ""The Creeping Flesh"" and ""The Doctor and The Devils"")does a solid enough job of directing the film despite it's apparent low budget. ""Evil"" features one of the weakest scripts by Anthony Hinds for the ""Frankenstein"" series. Cushing does his best with the material. It's basically a rehash of elements seen in many of the Universal Frankenstein films including the sequence where the Baron discovers his creature in ice (which echoes ""Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman""). The transfer looks far from ""Evil"". With nice, robust colors and nice fine line detail ""Evil of Frankenstein"" looks extremely good.

""Paranoic"" features Oliver Reed in a clever thriller with as many plot twists as ""Psycho"". Featuring a script by Jimmy Sangster and sharp direction by Freddie Francis, it's a memorable thriller but derivative thriller. It doesn't measure up to Hitchcock's classic but has a number of marvelous sequences in it and a great performance by Oliver Reed. A very nice transfer with rich blacks, ""Paranoic"" and ""Nightmare"" (another Jimmy Sangster ""Psycho"" knock off of sorts) both look positively beautiful in this presentation.

""Phantom of the Opera"" is Fisher's remake of the classic French novel. In this version the Phantom is played by Herbert Lom. The make up isn't as memorable as Lon Chaney's and the changes in the plot along with the smaller scale of the production makes this one that gets overlooked. Although it wasn't the huge financial hit that Universal had hoped at the time and the action lags a bit at the beginning, ""Phantom"" still remains a terrific bit of entertainment and has a number of marvelous set pieces directed by Terence Fisher.

""Kiss of the Vampire"" may appear to familair to fans of Roman Polanski's ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"". The basic plot involving a vampire cult and their attempt to initiate an unsuspecting young woman at a ""vampire ball"" was the basis for Polanski's satire. Well directed by Don Sharp, the main weakness of the film is the unconvincing bats that attack in one sequence. Otherwise, this is a top notch film. The transfer for ""Kiss of the Vampire"" looks quite good with rich colors.

""Night Creatures"" is a Peter Cushing period piece that was retitled for the US market from ""Captain Clegg"". Cushing plays the vicar in a town full of smugglers. Clegg was a pirate in the region who was ultimately caught, executed and buried in the town. Using ""marsh phantoms"" to scare away those who might be interested in their smuggling activities, the town is investigated when a man who had betrayed Clegg is found by the King's Navy. This mute brute (Clegg had his tongue cut out for trying to rape the Captain's wife and for betraying him)leads the King's men to the town where it is suspected that Clegg might be alive and still in action after all. A well written period adventure, Cushing is marvelous as the vicar and a young Oliver Reed does a nice supporting turn in the film as well. The film is based on the same source as ""Dr. Syn/The Scarecrow"" which Disney made with Patrick Magoohan (famed for ""The Prisoner"" and ""Secret Agent Man/Danger Man"")which forced Universal and Hammer to change the title and character names to avoid a lawsuit. Well directed by Peter Graham Scott with a breezy action filled script by Anthony Hinds, ""Night Creatures"" is a film I hadn't seen since childhood. My impressions now (as they were then)is that this is a terrific piece of filmmaking showing a side of Hammer that was rarely investigated.

""Night Creatures"" looks quite good although the sequences that set at night are a tad flat looking and dark. The colors are bright and vivid although the film looks like it could have been cleaned up a bit more for this presentation. Still, this DVD presentation of the film looks better than the rare VHS copies I've seen over the years. Part of the flaw with the film could be the age of the negative itself and/or the condition of it. It still looks mighty good all things considered.

The packaging resembles the other ""Franchise"" collections Universal has put out with a see through slipcase and images of the original lobby cards in small print on the inside. A nice job of putting this set together although, again, an extra disc with a biography of Cushing, commentary track from a Hammer film scholar (or fans)and the original theatrical trailers would have been appreciated.",1118966400,238,8089,4.838150289017341
2333255,4,B0009X770O,"If u are in to hammer horror films and u don't already own hammer dvd's separately and u need to start from something then this set is for you.
 most of the films here are classics.
 curse of the werewolf 1961 is the only hammer's film about the werewolf legend and is a must see.
 Evil of Frankenstein is also included here the 3rd of the hammer's Frankenstein films with peter cushing.
 there are also nice additions of films like paranoiac and nightmare and night creatures BUT the main reason to buy this set is cause only in this set u will find TOGETHER the two unofficial Dracula hammer films semi-sequels to the 1958 horror of Dracula first hammer Dracula entry with the real Dracula in it = the late sir lee.
 cause lee refused to reprise the role until 1966 hammer produced two great gems between 1958 and 1966 without lee and both are here.

 the most well known of them is the 1960 superb BRIDES OF DRACULA in which peter cushing pursues a lord baron who has the dracula's evil in him and the other movie is KISS OF THE VAMPIRE 1963  which was intended to be a loose sequel of the brides of Dracula and therefore related to the official hammer Dracula films.
 in this film a couple fights for survival against another vampire lord baron who uses black magic to get what he wants.
 Although it's not officially a sequel u can place that loose related vampire film in to your official hammer Dracula collection together with the rest of the 9 hammer Dracula films.
 here is the full catalogue of those films plus more. Christopher lee starred in 7 of those 10 films.

THE EVIL OF FRANKENSTEIN is another gem of the Hammer horror collection and Peter Cushing, again, shines as the evil Dr. Frankenstein.
CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF starring Oliver Reed was another old time favorite of mine, it didn't have the wow factor it used to have but it was great to see it again.
KISS OF THE VAMPIRE was a disappointment, it was never one of my favorite vampire movies, it just lacked the horror factor that vampire movies usually have, it really was a tad on the boring side compared to most vampire movies I've seen. ""Brides"" was much better of the two.
I haven't watched the other movies in this collection but I had the concern of everyone in the back of my mind about the skipping and the freezing, I saw none of that in any of the movies I saw this far and I have the double sided discs.",1439683200,,1089,4.29126213592233

Oliver Reed does a great job of the man cursed to be a werewolf.  The werewolf makeup is fantastic and different from most other werewolf movies.

While Lon Chaney, Jr.'s Universal film is a campy delight, Oliver Reed's is by far the most compelling werewolf film I've ever seen. And THE BRIDES OF DRACULA (from its romantically handsome vampire to it's lush cinematography) is certainly one of Hammer's most beautifully realized films. It is a particular treasure for older theatre-goers because it features a performance by the wonderful Martita Hunt, David Lean's ""Miss Haversham"" and Broadway's original ""Madwoman of Chaillot.""",1421625600,,638,5.203883495145631

This is a great place to start if you are getting into classic Hammer Horror films.  A few of the films are more suspense than horror, but still great movies.  The standout movies for me are Curse of The Werewolf and Night Creatures (aka Captain Clegg).  Oliver Reed is amazing in these films, and Night Creatures is such an awesome showcase for Peter Cushing.  You are going to want to find more Hammer movies after you see all the movies in the set as Christopher Lee's Dracula is not present in any of these movies.

The color and clarity of the images are great!  I grew up with most of these films on Saturday nights and am used to seeing grainy pan and scan 16mm TV prints.  Seeing pristine widescreen prints is like seeing the films for the first time.

I knew I would love ""Brides of Dracula,"" which has some of the most gorgeous castle sets ever in a movie, Hammer or otherwise.  David Peel turned in a great performance as did Peter Cushing and Freda Jackson.  Revisiting ""Curse of the Werewolf,"" ""Night Creatures,"" ""Evil of Frankenstein"" and ""Phantom"" brought a smile to my face as I had not seen them in over 30 years.

But the real surprise here is that the movie I never heard of before, ""Paranoiac,"" would become just about my favorite in the whole set!  This unsung gem was made after ""Psycho"" and before ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane,"" when psychological horror was in vogue.  And it's really good!  The fact that it stars one of my favorite British actors, Alex Davion, doesn't exactly hurt either.

2333391,5,B0009X770O,"This Hammer Horror Series collection contains some great Hammer classics, especially The Brides Of Dracula (1960), The Curse Of The Werewolf (1961), Phantom Of The Opera (1962), and Night Creatures (1962) (these are my favorites).  Hammer Studios flourished from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, but their golden age for making quality horror films was from about 1957 to about 1966.  Household names like Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee often starred in these horror flicks and became horror legends in the process.  Hammer horror movies have always been somewhat low budget, but they have a certain quality about them that appeals to horror movie fans, thus sustaining their popularity over the years.  Maybe it's the cheap sets.  Maybe it's the atmosphere.  Maybe it's the costumes.  Maybe it's the acting.  Maybe it's the slight camp element.  Whatever it is, Hammer Horror has an identity all its own.

What else can I say that hasn't already been said?  If you like Hammer horror, then you'll like this fine collection of classics.",1390867200,2,1041,5.064705882352941

2333425,5,B0009X770O,"All of them are worth watching actually, but if I have to pick favorites it will be Brides of Dracula and The Evil of Frankenstein which both star Peter Cushing.

Brides of Dracula has Cushing returning as Dr. Van Helsing who once again has to put a stop to another bloodsucker, Baron Meinster, portrayed by David Peel. Meinster has his eyes set on a beautiful new teacher at a girls' school, but Van Helsing is determined to stop him. But he will have his work cut out for him as there are other vampires on the prowl in the countryside.

Even though Dracula is nowhere to be seen in here, Brides of Dracula nevertheless proves to be a worthy sequel to Horror of Dracula. It helps that Cushing is back reprising one of his most famous roles and that Peel plays a great vampire, charming and scary with equal flair just as Christopher Lee did in the previous movie.

The Evil of Frankenstein is much maligned because it breaks continuity from the previous two films....I can only speak for myself....I have no problem with it as I just see this Baron Frankenstein a completely different character and not the same Victor Frankenstein that we see in Curse and Revenge.

This Baron Frankenstein was driven out of his hometown Klaastad because he too succeeded in bringing to life a corpse made out of dead parts but his creation was supposedly destroyed by the townspeople who drove the creature to fall into a glacier off from a mountain. Ten years later the Baron has returned to Klaastad, revives his creature with the help of a hypnotist...but with disasterous results. The hypnotist uses the creature as an instrument of revenge against the Burgomaster and a policeman as revenge for being ordered out of town...without Baron Frankenstein's knowledge.

I consider The Evil of Frankenstein equally as brilliant as its predecessors and again it also helps that it has Cushing in the lead. Great movie.",1354838400,2,1902,4.751515151515152

However, these double-sided discs played perfectly well on my fairly inexpensive Sony DVD player with no freeze-ups, etc. that I could find.  The pictures are crisp and the sound is clear.

The main reason I wanted the set is to obtain Brides of Dracula and Curse of the Werewolf; two of my Hammer favorites from my teen years that have been hard to find and don't appear to be available anywhere else.  These two alone are worth the purchase price of the set.  The rest, I guess your might say, are just gravy.",1330732800,4,865,4.61437908496732
2333463,1,B0009X770O,"The Hammer Horror Series from Universal Studios that I bought myself at Christmas has gone the way of a flood of complaints on the internet about the set of two doubled-sided, dual-layered discs that have two Hammer films to a side. That is a total of 8 movies on two discs. Many people complained of the discs skipping, freezing and locking in their players. Some and I now have fallen into this group, have had the discs play fine on the first viewing, but upon a second try, the discs had degraded and freeze and lock.

The second viewing (on Feb. 1) coincided with the trial of a new Blu-ray player I purchased to compliment the new television my family bought me for Christmas. The second disc played fine again, but side two of the first disc, 1963's ""Phantom of the Opera"" with Herbert Lom and ""Paranoiac"" with Oliver Reed both froze in both players. The two movies on side one played fine. The vendor I purchased the set from in December said if the discs played fine on the first viewing, they could not be considered ""defective."" So, as I looked to the new release of ""Phantom"" as part of Universal's Vault Series MOD DVDs for a new source for this film and then saw a new Blu-ray presentation of ""Paranoiac"" from Eureka Video available, I breathed easier. I asked my sister if I could have back the DVD of ""Kiss of the Vampire"" also in the set I had disseminated to her as an extra gift at Christmas, in case that film degraded as well.

Universal Studios for a matter of pennies produced this set, as they have with other of their franchises and provided good films and beautiful transfers but should be embarrassed of this manufacturing decision to go on the cheap, but then turn a deaf ear to disgruntled customers. But then, hasn't Universal been the major studio who opted for exploitation more often than others?

It remains unknown how to replace the other films in the Universal set when they degrade as they are unavailable separately.",1328659200,5,1955,4.564102564102564

2333466,4,B0009X770O,"""Curse of the Werewolf""

Believe it or not, there have been many Werewolf films every decade since 1913. ""The Werewolf"" being the first. For myself, the earliest Werewolf film I recall seeing was, 1935's, ""Werewolf of London,"" (Universal) & was first film to feature bipedal, anthropomorphic, werewolves, featuring Henry Hull as the beast. Then the Universal classic, 1941's, ""The Wolf Man"" & just as good, the next Universal film, 1943's, ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man.""

For about 18 year afterwards, there really was no Werewolf film of consequence, then in 1961, Hammer Films who were re-envisioning or should I say reinventing the horror genre, gave us the first masterpiece werewolf film, ""Curse of the Werewolf.""

""Curse of the Werewolf"" is the tragic tale of Leon (Oliver Reed in his first starring role!), who was born to a mute girl raped by a half human beggar imprisoned by the cruel Marques Siniestro, in a dungeon for years & forgotten. The mute girl is the jailers daughter, who grows up feeding the beggar through bars. She grows into a beautiful woman who spurns the Marquee's sexual advances & is locked up in the dungeon with the beggar, there the rape happens. She is impregnated & has baby Leon on Christmas day, a terrible omen for a unwanted child, but all seems well, that is until she's dies right after birth. So Leon's story begins.

""Curse of the Werewolf"" is filled with eerie scenes, starting with Leon baptism scene, which has been copied much over the years. As young Leon grows older, he begins to have nightmares around age 10, but those nightmares are not just dreams, as he wakes up with a bullet in his leg & blood on his palms. Several more well done scenes follow as Leon adoptive father talks with a priest & is told Leon is a Werewolf, an evil spirit invading the human soul, that fights for domination, especially when evil is at it strongest during the full moon. Only love, fellowship, & understanding can cure or be a short term cure for his condition.

We jump now to a full grown Leon (Oliver Reed) leaving home to work at a winery, where he falls in love with the owners daughter. It is here that Leon is again attacked by his condition, & what follows is truly ground breaking for the genre, as was the first part of the film.

Hammer Studios was always noted for their beautiful sets, cinematography, fine scripts (at least early on), great direction & acting, & ""Curse of the Werewolf"" had all of these in spades! Terence Fisher, Hammer's ace director took the helm for this film. A beautifully tragic horror film, in the same vein as the ""Wolf Man,"" were the Werewolf is really the victim, not the victims he kills, Fisher has created the first masterpiece of the sub-genre. Oliver Reed's make up was quite terrifying to this young boy who had watched the film in the 60's, even had a few nightmares when I was little with this Werewolf. Though not as animalistic as Lon Chaney's make up in, ""The Wolf Man,"" Oliver Reeds make up was more feral, maybe because he still looked part human, & after all, don't many people find a monster with human physical traits all the more terrifying?

You'll find this movie in the ""Hammer Horror Series,"" along with it's equal, ""The Brides of Dracula,"" the best Vampire movie Hammer ever made. These two films are worth the price of admission alone, & are two of the more obscure Hammer horror films that are top tier. The transfer & sound is top notch for films this old, & you know what? This is the only package you'll find the DVD's in!

4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece

""Brides of Dracula""

Hammer Films were best known for their Christopher Lee, Dracula movies, but their best Vampire film did not even have Dracula in it, though it was in the title, ""Brides of Dracula.""

""Brides of Dracula"" made in 1960, was the sequel of ""The Horror of Dracula,"" Hammers first Dracula film, & staring Christopher Lee & Peter Cushing as Van Helsing. In that movie, Dracula was destroyed by sunlight. In ""Brides of Dracula,"" it is Dracula's disciple, Baron Meinster, David Peel, who is the antagonist of the film, with Peter Cushing playing the protagonist, Van Helsing again, but in a subtler way than the first film. While David Peels, Baron Meinster, was also more subtle than Christopher Lee's Dracula, his Baron Meinster was at the same time, more feral, threatening, evil, & had a much more intelligent script. As a matter of fact, one thing about Christopher Lee's, Dracula was, he never had much dialog, but David Peel's, Baron Meinster, had more dialog than two or three Christopher Lee films put together, & he truly makes a formidable vampire.

This movie is filled with great acting, script, cinematography, outstanding sets, scenery, & again, director Terence Fisher makes the first masterpiece in a horror sub-genre, & it is his eerie scenes that really make this film bite! One such scene has a new Vampire being coaxed out of her grave by Baron Meinster's old nanny, who now is his human daylight protector. The scene is really the first of it's kind that I can remember. Shot in a cemetery, the nanny, Greta, Freda Jackson, played with a maniacal intensity, makes you really think she is insane, what a great performance, as she sweets talks the beautiful young female Vampire out of her grave. The ground starts to rise as a hand pops out slowly, all shot perfectly up close by the camera! Greta cackles with pleasure as the young girl rises from her coffin. Other great scenes abound in a castle (the Baron's mother) & the dark shrouded leafless forest of late fall.

You can only find this film in DVD, in ""the Hammer Horror Film Series,"" along with the outstanding ""Curse of the Werewolf."" Any lover of horror, especially Hammer horror, needs to pick this set of DVD's up yesterday! The transfer is excellent! A loving tribute to Hammer horror!

2333467,5,B0009X770O,"After reading numerous reviews of this set speaking of damaged or mistransferred movies that wouldn't play, sometimes just one movie in the whole set, I was definitely reluctant to buy this set used, especially with sellers claiming on auction sites ""never viewed"", so I had to pay almost full price/brand new here on Amazon just in case I had to do a return and exchange as many times as it took to get a working set, and I watched all eight movies finally, and they all check out fine, meaning they all played.  I don't know if there is still even an issue that exists with this set.  Anyway, these seem like an okay set, several of the movies aren't exactly in my opinion real horror or supernatural, like Paranoiac or Nightmare, or Night Creatures either, those three are like mysteries, and its horrific that they are called horror.  Other than that, the real horror movies are a colleciton of okay Hammer Horror.",1318550400,2,918,4.619631901840491
2333468,5,B0009X770O,"From many of the reviews I have read, they carry a common thread: disc freezes. One review mentioned Paranoia. I had no trouble with that movie, but I did the other B&W Nightmare. It froze off and on through several ""chapters"".

I have had this same problem with dual discs from this company. The Legacy or Franchise series of the famous monsters. I bought them all. No problems until ""Dracula"". Disc 2 side B won't work at all and the disc appears flawless.

Ma & Pa Kettle Goes To Waikiki. This was weird. It stalled every time I played it until 3 plays. Now it works. Go figure.

It is obvious these dual layer discs are thin. I can assume the embedding may be too ""light"" which creates stalls. I have heard of deeply embedded discs watching one movie and getting interference from another on the other side.

Dual layering is a more cost effective way to sell DVDs. I have quite a few from other major studios and do not have a problem with any except Universal.

I know this is not a review of The Hammer Horror Series. There are many incisive reviews already posted.
My personal opinion is I did not care for the modern setting (modern Gothic)Nightmare and Paranoiac. Of the older era, ""Phantom of the Opera"" moves quicker and has one very gory but short scene. The Claude Rains version is far superior, but Hammer's has less opera music for those who can't handle this genre. ""Kiss of The Vampire"" is the worst of the color movies. It wasn't frightening but it had a wonderful ""Hichkocian twisted ending. I found myself enjoying more. The best of the lot doesn't really belong on the disc because it isn't really horror but history, Night Creatures. I remember watching it on TV years ago and found it very well made and entertaining. This speaks volumes when you consider I was only 9 years old at the time. ""Brides of Dracula"" is pretty much classic Hammer sans Christopher Lee, as is ""The Evil of Frankenstein"". The next best movie in this set is of course the famous ""Curse of the Werewolf"". Splendid production values and performances enhance this Hammer classic.

One word to the wise. All of the movies run less than 1 1/2 hours, the longest clocking in at 1.28.

This is a diverse, entertaining box set. It could be ""great"", if it wasn't for those damn stalls. It got so bad on Nightmare, I had to skip an entire chapter before it ran smoothly. Universal wake up. You have a good product here. You did great transfers, the picture and sound are terrific, but you need to ensure they movies ""Play"" without annoying stalls.

 I had bout the legacy collection movies from Universal before and never had a problem with them either, So I could not be more pleased with the quality of the packaging and the movies.

 My only complaint would be the lack of any special features, commentary etc. Even trailers would be very welcome, or a gallery of the great Hammer poster art. But even that complaint is given with apologies from me. I just can't rain on this parade!

 Being a fanatic of these movies from my childhood, I was very pleased with the picture and sound quality. Brilliant colors and clear sound and not one freeze up or pixelation to be found on my set.

 These take me back to the time when my older sister worked at the Kirby Theater in Roxboro NC and I would go to Saturday matinee and watch all the great Hammer films or the latest Vincent Price offering.

2333496,4,B0009X770O,"I ordered this Hammer horror film collection inspite of the many warnings regarding faulty double-sided discs from Universal. My desire to own ""Brides of Dracula"" and ""Curse of the Werewolf"" led me to throw caution to the wind. Alas, the warnings were true. ""Curse of the Werewolf"" had several freezes and skips, and ""Paranoiac"" had some skips and pixalating. These other films, however, played flawlessly. I must commend Amazon for their courteous handling and expedient replacement of this set. fortunately, the replacement set seems to be without and defect. My rating is based on the replacement set.
As for the films themselves, I find all 8 features to be thoroughly entertaining and well made. For me, the 'weak sister' of the set is ""Night Creatures"". Not because it is a bad film, to the contrary, it is quite good. But I wouldn't classify it as a horror film, or even a 'fright' film for that matter. I just don't feel it belongs in this set. Since this set includes a werewolf, a vampire, and Frankenstien's monster, perhaps they could've rounded out the set and replaced ""Night Creatures"" with the Hammer remake of ""The Mummy"".  UPDATE: This Hammer Horror Series has been re-released using single-sided discs. Purchase the single sided set, avoid the double sided.
I was pleasantly surprised by ""Nightmare"". I had never heard of the film before this, and I enjoyed it immensely. It is in the same genre as ""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"" in that it involves two lovers who plot to drive someone crazy. I was also very pleased with ""Paranoiac"", another film I wasn't familiar with, but found it to be a top notch thriller.
I found the films in technicolor to be rich and vibrant, just as I remember them when I saw them in the theater as a kid. And the two black & white features are crisp and sharp, and quite striking to the eye.

There isn't much that needs to be said about these movies other than that they look great on the screen and they get better every time I watch them! The writing and acting, the cinematography, the sets, the costumes, the dark ambience Hammer succeeds so brilliantly in creating, these are the things that made Hammer the very best in Horror for so many years!

My experiences with vendors here at Amazon has been quite good (with very few exceptions), and if you can find a vendor with a 98+ rating selling it at a reasonable price, I'd recommend buying it and giving it a spin. If it doesn't work out in your player, a good vendor will square you away just as quickly as Amazon would, some even faster. Hope this helps a few of you who might be sitting on the fence on this one :-)",1273017600,,1267,4.528384279475983
2333530,5,B0009X770O,"I remember watching the ""Horror of Dracula"" and ""Curse of Frankenstein"" at the drive in as a ""Two For One Creature Feature"" in 1968. From that night, I was a Hammer fan. The lesser(but non-less classic) Hammer films that I watched both on TV and at the movies are faithfully reproduced and included in this tapestry of classics. My only complaint is that these have not been transferred to Blu Ray yet. Cudos to Tim Burton for paying homage to the Hammer classics whenever he has the opportunity to do so!",1270857600,,505,4.56043956043956
2333531,4,B0009X770O,"Any Hammer compilation that brings back ""Night Creatures"" aka ""Captain Clegg"" for the masses to see is surely on a very right track - the creative best track. I  hate double-sided discs, and so double-side-damn the company for issuing these pieces this way. Having said that, my rental copy did not freeze up, so perhaps I was one of the fortunate few. The actual content and the visual transfer are very good. And it's an artistic inspired offbeat selection.

The fortunate many will be pleased that a genuinely offbeat and thoughtful compilation was produced. What do you get if you have Hammer without Christopher Lee meeting Peter Cushing? You might get the solo Cushing reprising a Van Helsing role, trying to rid a community of the bloodsuckers. ""Brides of Dracula"" is one of the very best Hammer films, complete with subtle overtones that sometimes - very much sometimes - recall Val Lewton's work. For those who have seen it, I reference the dirty coffiny depraved ""resurrection"" of a vampire. Also the screams of a mother as her son has escaped.

""Kiss of the Vampire"" deserves special consideration. I love the pace, and the concept. Always the largest community evil in remote resort towns comes from the richest folk in the town. We could call it decadent, but I appreciated that the villain in this story was a very rich but unglamorous family, It rang true, and Christopher Lee would have held it back. If the villain seems subdued, that would be your banality of evil. Go to Malibu - it rings true.

""Phantom of the Opera""is held back by only one thing. No concept or version of the story has ever been what we would call scary or frightenng. Pathetic and abject, yes. Believable, just maybe. Perhaps not the stuff of Gothic Horror. And yet, this Hammer story is great. If you have an arty and confident girlfriend, this just might be your chance to intro Hammer for her.

""Night Creatures"" aka ""Captain Clegg"" is some special masterpiece. I have been financially blessed to visit England 3 times. My experience tells me that the English miss their seafaring swashbuckling role, and conspire to bring it back. Unlikely,  but ""Night Creatures"" captures it for posperity.

In all, a worthy release of Hammer drama.",1264896000,,2227,4.81413612565445
2333532,4,B0009X770O,"""The Hammer Horror Collection"" is a series of 8 films moving between vampires, an opera ghost, psychological thrillers, and one of the worst mainline Frankenstein films ever made.  The collection boasts several performances by Peter Cushing, always a fine actor, and a few by the scene-chewing Oliver Reed--that is, when he is not chewing on the people as a werewolf.  The low point comes with ""The Evil of Franksnstein""--which, because of the monster's make-up, just doesn't seem to work.  My copy, by the way, did freeze up during one feature--except for that, the collection is fine.
This is, however, the second Universal collection that uses advertising from the wrong picture.  In one of the Gary Cooper collection, the photos from ""Beau Geste"" came from the silent-era film with Ronald Colman.  The illustrations for ""Phantom"" came from the Claude Rains/Nelson Eddy version.  Makes you wonder if such goofs could raise the re-sale value???",1264636800,,946,5.190789473684211

Brides Of Dracula, Curse Of The Werewolf and Kiss Of The Vampire are Hammer classics and the other 5 are less well known but worth seeing. I had read about the problems others had had with the set but my need to own these films outweighed the risk. I nervously watched all the films and was delighted when they played perfectly, I thought I was one of the lucky ones. I have watched several of the films more than once without any problems. Then I decided to watch Phantom Of The Opera again - and guess what, it stuck about half way through even though I am still using the same multi region player that the discs have worked on previously. I cleaned the disc and used a dvd player cleaner but it still stuck at the same place. I then tried it on an older and much cheaper player that I still use from time to time - fortunately it played the movie without any problem, so I can still watch it when I want to. This is really a warning to those buyers who think they have a perfect set - don't be surprised if you come across the same problem that I did when you try to watch the movies again. I would have thought that Universal was a big enough, and experienced enough company to get things right when releasing their DVDs.

Oliver Reed plays a young man who is cursed by turning into a werewolf during nights of the full moon.  The film indicates this was caused by his mother being raped by a deranged man kept in prison for many years, something which deviates from the werewolf legend. I never understood that aspect of the film and believe it was a construct to prevent any lawsuits by Universal. Reed's character can only be redeemed by the love of a young girl. The ending was brilliantly staged and is very exciting to watch. If you are a die-hard Hammer fan you must buy this.

I have had so many problems before with movies/tv shows freezing up on Universal released flip sided DVDs. I don't know why this seems to be the case with Universal, but it's time they correct this issue. You'd think that with so many complaints of a particular produce, they would recall the set and release a new corrected one, like they had to do with the Alfred Hitchcock Presents - Season One set. it's funny how when Universal released the future seasons of Hitchcock Presnts, that they were no longer double sided discs. I understand the studio(s) most likely do this to save money, but in the long run...that logic doesn't really qite work does it Universal? Since you lose money when defective copies keep getting returned to the stores. Universal, it's high time you stop your cheap ways and quite making these *bleep* flip sided discs that always seem to be defective.

Peter Cushing appears in three films as Dr. Frankenstein (Evil of Frankenstein), Dr. Van Helsing (Brides of Dracula), and Dr. Blyss (Night Creatures).

By day, he's the humble village parson, Dr. Blyss,"" but by night, he's the head of a liquor smuggling ring who use ""the Marsh Phantoms"" to scare off those who get too curious.  Lots of great give and take between the parson and the captain of the King's men who begins to suspect the preacher may be none other than the notorious pirate, Capt. Clegg.

Only two out of the eight movies seemed to disappoint.  ""The Curse of the Werewolf"" plot line seemed too trite; although, it does feature a very young Oliver Reed.

I had never heard of ""Nightmare"" till I rented it, and now, having seen it, I don't know why I never came across it.  It's an undiscovered gem by Hammer Studios.

Juiced up by director Freddie Francis with eerie, foreboding scenes in a house full of noirish black-and-white looming shadows and imminent menace, ""Nightmare"" seems more or less predictable at first, like it might be over halfway through, but in reality the best is yet to come.  What in the world is going on here?  Who is setting up whom?  The plot, as adeptly crafted by Hammer stalwart Jimmie Sangster, has more twists and turns in it than does Mulholland Drive in the Hollywood Hills, and keeps you guessing till the very end.  Where has this minor, unheard-of classic been all of my life?  Why did it never get exposure on TV?  Don't miss this one if you relish an intriguing story and edge-of-your-seat suspense.

They are certainly all earnestly done, but the scripts seem to be rather weak often.
 The ""Phantom"" version is really not very good at all, story is greatly changed from  Leroux's original, feels like they're doing all they can to avoid copyright infringement.

 ""Kiss of the Vampire"" gets a bit silly at the end, but is an entertaining journey.
 ""Curse of the Werewolf"" gets howling good work from Oliver Reed, mad and intense, but most of the time the film just wanders about being a bit dull.
 ""Evil of Frankenstein"" has put me to sleep three times, and I'm STILL not through it! ""Nightmare"" and ""Night Creatures"" have yet to make it to the screen.

Terence Fisher directed this film. Peter Cushing gave another marvellous performance as the vampire hunter, Van Helsing. David peel plays, Baron Meinster, whose mother, keeps him chained in the castle, and lures young girls there to satisfy his lust for blood. A young girl, becomes a guest at the castle, when she is stranded, at the local inn. Feeling sorry for the young Baron, the girl frees him. The Baron follows the girl back to her school and while 'courting' her, spreads vampirism, all too liberally, among her school friends. The Baroness becomes a vampire as a result of an attack by her son, and one of the finest moments of horror in the film is, when nervous as a school-girl on her first date, the Baroness removes her veil to show Van Helsing, her hideous vampire-fangs. Van Helsing himself, for a terrifying instant becomes infested with the taint of a vampire after the Baron attacks him. Cushing, superbly conveys the agony of a man suffering not-only the physical, but also, the spiritual pains of the damned, as he burns the vampire's bite, from his flesh, with a white-hot, poker. This IS a scene, which still has, the power, to hold an audience, silent and horror-stricken.",1225584000,4,1658,5.855371900826446

2333645,4,B0009X770O,"Hammer Studios of England had been around for several decades--occasionally dabbling in low budget films and BBC radio and television, but more often a distributor than a production venue--when the 1955 THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT proved an unexpected box-office hit on both sides of the Atlantic.  Sensing a profit, Hammer Studios suddenly went all out for horror films, and by the early 1960s had developed a slick and sexy style that can only be described as ""blood, boobs, and boufonts.""  With canny advertising and lots of cleavage, ""Hammer Horror"" would dominate the genre for well over a decade.

Over the years most Hammer Horror titles have been released to the home market, but recent years have seen two major package releases: THE HAMMER HORROR COLLECTION, which includes the studio's best known titles, and THE HAMMER HORROR SERIES, which consists of lesser known titles.  The latter consists of eight titles, all made in the early 1960s: THE BRIDES OF DRACULA (1960); THE WOLFMAN (1961); THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (1962); NIGHT CREATURES (1962); PARANOIC (1963); THE KISS OF THE VAMPIRE (1963); THE EVIL OF FRANKENSTEIN (1964); and NIGHTMARE (1964.)

Of the titles offered here, THE KISS OF THE VAMPIRE is easily the best, for it offers a great deal more subtlety than most Hammer outings in its story of a honeymooning couple who are seduced by a vampiric cult; the cast is solid, the art direction and score memorable, and the whole thing is presented with tremendous elegance.  Not far behind is THE BRIDES OF DRACULA--slightly misnamed, for Dracula as a character does not figure in the story--a film which is notable for being in the typical Hammer style: women with big hair, big breasts, and low-cut gowns are lured to a bloody doom.  THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is also quite interesting, offering a new twist on the old story and reeking of atmosphere.

Hammer may have specialized in lots of cleavage, but it did not stint the gentleman: Oliver Reed was a frequent performer, and he takes the title role in THE WOLFMAN; unfortunately the result is a shade too slow to be entirely effective.  He also appears in NIGHT CREATURES, a film that is more swashbuckling than horror and seemingly culled from Daphne du Maurier's novel JAMACIA INN in its tale of smugglers on the English coast; it is more enjoyable than actually memorable.  Reed also appears in PARANOAIC, a black and white thriller concerning missing heirs and neurotic women; like the also-included black and white NIGHTMARE, it too is more enjoyable than actually memorable.  As for THE EVIL OF FRANKENSTEIN, the less said the better.

While the entertainment value of each title varies, it is always fun to see the usual Hammer players--Peter Cushing, Janette Scott, and Yvonne Romain among them--and while there are no extras to speak of the films are in remarkably, indeed incredibly good condition.  They may not be among the ""first rank"" of Hammer Horror films, but they are fun, and fans of the style will find this set worth every penny.

They are all fine films, though of somewhat uneven quality: for instance, classic Hammers like ""Brides of Dracula"" and ""Kiss of the Vampire"" will hold more lasting interest than an only-okay psychological thriller like ""Nightmare.""

Since others have already spoken at length about the films, and since most people buying this set know what they're getting, I want to address the DVD mastering problems experienced so widely. Many have noted that, regardless of player, films in the set pixelate and freeze at random points. This is a problem with Universal's DVD-18 mastering process, which has flaws that have since caused Universal to return to their earlier, more reliable DVD-9 process.

In the meantime, both this set and the ""Bela Lugosi Collection"" have more than their share of bad discs. Contacting Universal itself will serve no purpose: even though they are aware of the problem, the pressings are out there and are not being remastered. You just have to be persistent and keep exchanging defective copies at retailers--even if you have to get a refund and start again with another dealer; the films are worth it. Eventually, you *will* get one without glitches. It took me three copies from two places. Importantly, you don't have to play through all the films in real time to know if you have a flawed copy: just scan through the films in the player at 4x-10x speed (no faster), and if there is a glitch, the player will freeze at the spot. That way, you don't have to watch through eight 90-minute movies on every copy you try out; it will take only 10% of the time to check the set, and you don't even have to be in the room. If you come back and the image is frozen, rather than having finished the film being scanned and having returned to the menu, then you have a bad one.",1160265600,26,1848,4.718266253869969

A wonderful film, though, about it being a choice to become a monster.  Vampirism is described as a ""cult"" in this picture and Peter Cushing does a wonderful job as Van Helsing.

2333676,5,B0009X770O,"Universal's ""Hammer Horror Series"" is an outstanding collection of the British horror studio's most creative films.  Many of these titles are making their debut on dvd and have never looked better.  The dvd transfer is clear and the colors are rich.  I would have preferred to have each movie on a one sided disc in it's own dvd case, however, to have these films on dvd at all is quite satisfactory.  Titles include:

""Brides of Dracula"" (1960) (Director: Terence Fisher) A young teacher (Yvonne Monlaur) is on her way to a position in Transylvania and helps a young man (David Peel) escape the shackles his mother (Martita Hunt in her greatest role) has put on him. In so doing she innocently unleashes the horrors of the undead once again on the populace, including those at her school for ladies. Luckily for some, Dr Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) is already on his way.

""The Phantom of the Opera"" (1962) (Director: Terence Fisher) The corrupt Lord Ambrose D'Arcy (Michael Gough) steals the life's work of the poor musical Professor Petry. (Herbert Lom). In an attempt to stop the printing of music with D'Arcy's name on it, Petry breaks into the printing office and accidentally starts a fire, leaving him severely disfigured. Years later, Petry returns to terrorize a London opera house that is about to perform one of his stolen operas.

""Curse of the Werewolf"" (1961)  (Director: Terence Fisher) In Spain, Leon (Oliver Reed) is born on Christmas day to a mute servant girl who was raped by a beggar. His mother dies giving birth and he is looked after by Don Alfredo(Clifford Evans). As a child Leon becomes a werewolf after a hunting trip reveals an animals blood to him. As a young man, he works in a wine cellar and falls in love with the owner's daughter Cristina (Catherine Feller). One full moon, he again turns into a werewolf and terrifies the town.

""Kiss of the Vampire"" (1963) (Director: Don Sharp) Gerald and Marianne Harcourt (Gerald de Souza and Jennifer Daniel) are traveling by car when the car breaks down and they have to spend a few days in a small, remote village. It doesn't take long before they are invited to Dr. Ravna's (Noel Willman) castle. Without their knowledge, Dr. Ravna is the leader of a vampire cult, and he has become astonished by Marianne's beauty...

""The Evil of Frankenstein"" (1964) (Director: Freddie Francis) Penniless, Baron Frankenstein(Peter Cushing), accompanied by his eager assistant Hans (Sandor Eles), arrives at his family castle near the town of Karlstaad, vowing to continue his experiments in the creation of life. Fortunately finding the creature he was previously working on, he brings it back to a semblance of life but requires the services of a hypnotist, Prof. Zoltan (Peter Woodthorpe), to successfully animate it. The greedy and vengeful Zoltan secretly sends the monster (Kiwi Kingston) into town to steal gold and 'punish' the burgomaster (David Hutcheson)and the chief of police(Anthony Blackshaw), which lead to a violent confrontation between the baron and the townspeople.

""Paranoiac"" (1963) (Director: Freddie Francis) Simon Ashby (Oliver Reed) is a wealthy psychotic who is coddled by his aunt (Sheila Burrell) in their mansion outside of London. Simon's sister, Eleanor Ashby (Janette Scott), believes she sees their beloved dead brother, who died in an accident while they were all children.  One day, Ashby's long lost brother, Tony Ashby (Alexander Davion) mysteriously arrives at the house, proving Eleanor's sanity, however, events prove that he is an impostor, sent by Keith Kossett (John Bonney) (son of the attorney for the family estate) who has been dipping into the family trust fund.

""Night Creatures"" (1962)  (Director: Peter Graham Scott)  In this engaging costume melodrama of skulduggery on the low seas set back in the 18th-century, the Royal Crown suspects a bit of smuggling is going on in this locale, and they send Captain Collier (Patrick Allen) and his crew to check it out. As the Captain gets into his investigation, mysterious swamp phantoms cloud up the real issue which seems plain enough to see. Captain Collier suspects that the odd village vicar (Peter Cushing) might be hiding something, and what better way to do that than by fortuitous ghosts to scare away the curious, or by posing as someone he is not?

""Nightmare"" (1964)  (Director: Freddie Francis)  Janet (Jennie Linden) is a young student at a private school; her nights are troubled by horrible dreams of her mother, who is in fact locked in an insane asylum.  Expelled because of her persistent nightmares, Janet is sent home where the nightmares continue.  Is Janet's nightmare real or has she become the pawn in a psychological game being played?

These films are of the highest caliber in entertainment and are visually stunning.  I feel it's time for a ""Hammer Horror Series Volume 2"" with more great films, including ""The Gorgon"" (1960), ""The Damned"" (1961) and ""The Old Dark House"" (1962) to name just a few possibilities.  Remember to pick up your copies of the British horror releases, ""And Now The Screaming Starts,"" ""Asylum,"" and ""The Beast Must Die"" featured in the Amicus Collection.  Amicus Studios were Hammer Studios big rival in the horror genre and their films starred many of Hammer's actors (Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, etc.) and produced several great films.

2333702,4,B0009X770O,"In the `30s and `40s, the big name in movie horror was Universal.  They had most of the classic monsters:  Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, the Wolf Man, the Invisible Man and the Mummy, with the Creature from the Black Lagoon following in the 1950s.  Universal had its stable of stars, in particular Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney, Jr.  The early movies were great, but the later ones (while still decent), showed that the classic era of monster movies was at an end.

Along came Hammer Studios out of England.  They reworked many of these monsters in their own fashion, with their own stars, particularly Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.  The Hammer ""look"" for movies was often consistent:  ornate, colorful and brightly lit sets, good makeup but limited special effects and competent (if stiff) acting.  While the best of the Hammer movies are not in this collection (they can be found in the Hammer Horror Collection), the Hammer Horror Series does include eight good second-tier movies, compactly provided two to a side on two DVDs.

Side One of Disc One has Brides of Dracula and Curse of the Werewolf.  Brides has Cushing reprising his role as vampire hunter Van Helsing.  Dracula himself is nowhere to be seen, although it is hinted that Baron Meinster may have been an heir of sorts.  There are inconsistencies, however, with the Christopher Lee Dracula series, in particular, with the fact that Meinster can become a bat, something Dracula could never do.  On a standalone basis, though, this movie holds up.  Curse of the Werewolf is a different interpretation of the werewolf legend.  While usually lycanthropy is treated as a contagious disease with new people becoming werewolves through a bite, Curse's Oliver Reed is the unlucky victim of the circumstances of this birth: conceived through rape and with a birthdate filled with bad omens, his fate is outside of his control.

Side Two of Disc One has Phantom of the Opera and Paranoiac.  Phantom is a re-working of the classic tale, a non-supernatural story of a hideously scarred man who dwells beneath an opera house.  This is not a very satisfying work:  the opera pieces go on too long and take away from the main story.  A bit of trivia for Dr. Who fans:  Patrick Troughton (the second Doctor) has a bit role as a doomed ratcatcher.  The black-and-white Paranoiac is more of a soap opera than a horror movie, with the tale of a long-presumed-dead brother returning to his troubled (but wealthy) family.  Oliver Reed is the ""paranoiac"" of the title, and he chews the scenery so much you can practically see the teeth marks.

Side One of Disc Two features Kiss of the Vampire and Nightmare.  The former is a vampire story that stands apart from the Dracula series and involves newlyweds who are stuck in a small village and must contend with a vampire cult.  Although occasionally worth watching, this is not the best in the bunch, and the ending is weak.  Nightmare is a non-supernatural (and black-and-white) suspense story of a teenage girl who is tormented by nightmares, the result of seeing the murder of her father by her insane mother.  The girl worries that she is going crazy herself, with strange visions forcing her to relive the murder; what's actually going on is more sinister.  This is a creepily effective (if a little predictable) film.

Finally, on Side Two of Disc Two we have Night Creatures and Evil of Frankenstein.  Night Creatures (a reworking of an older movie called Dr. Syn) is a historical horror movie taking place in late 18th century England.  It involves a town filled with smugglers and the marsh phantoms who inhabit the local swampland.  Most viewers will have the phantoms figured out pretty early, but this movie does have its moments.  Peter Cushing as the town's pastor/chief smuggler and a toned-down Oliver Reed lead the cast.  Evil of Frankenstein is the third in the Peter Cushing Frankenstein series (although continuity is erratic enough that they can be watched in almost any order after the first two).  In this story, Frankenstein finds and resurrects his original monster but problems develop when a hypnotist gains control of the creature.

There are no really great or awful movies in the set.  In general, they are probably all low-three-star to low-four-star material.  As a set, however, we get a nice variety of Hammer horror fare (albeit with no extras), so I am giving this a four-star rating.  I recommend getting the Hammer Horror Collection first, and if you like that material, you can move on to this.",1138320000,2,4546,4.8671875
2333703,1,B0009X770O,"Like many others I also have to report having problems with these discs. Curse of the Werewolf froze and pixellated a couple of times, but was otherwise okay. Evil of Frankenstein, however, was unwatchable because of all the playback problems. I think the disc was scratched by a flyer that was enclosed in the set. Not real smart to package something loose to rattle around along the playable surface of your discs. So I got in touch with Universal to send me a replacement and that one was defective as well.

2333726,4,B0009X770O,"""Hammer Horror Series"" presents some of the studios best films from the early sixties period, though they might not be the most familiar to Hammer fans.  A few, in fact, might come with baggage attached, but this collection dispells some of that baggage.  In particular, Hammer's ""Phantom of the Opera"" has suffered more abuse over the years than any other of its films.  The hard truth is, it's pretty good.  The reason it has such a bum reputation might be because most people first saw it on television, which seriously impaired it.  In it's proper aspect ratio, and with the extra scenes filmed for American TV left out, it's really pretty good.  Not perfect, but pretty good.  The biggest liability with the film are the horrendous opera sequences.  ""Evil of Frankenstein"" has similarly been dissed over the years, but it is also pretty good, with a particularly witty Cushing performance (offsetting a monster with the worst makeup Roy Ashton ever devised).  ""Brides of Dracula"" stands as one of Hammer's all-time best, with the great Peter Cushing squaring off against a vampire -- not Christopher Lee, but David Peel as a delightfully creepy Dorian Grey-ish bloodsucker, while ""Curse of the Werewolf,"" despite its acclaim, is one of Hammer's worst -- long, boring, and ridiculous.  But at least it's colorful.  ""Night Creatures,"" one the other hand, is one of the most atmospheric films they ever produced -- not a horror film, but a pirate film with horror trappings.  ""Kiss of the Vampire"" is good non-star Hammer, while ""Paranoiac"" and ""Nightmare"" are good thrillers, rather than gothic horrors.  It's a worthwhile mix of films, worth the money even if it only included ""Phantom,"" ""Brides"" and ""Night Creatures.""",1130803200,8,1723,5.024647887323944
2333727,5,B0009X770O,"It's good to see this collection released. Hammer Studios seldom had much of a budget to work with but they had a core group of talented people who brought a sense of style to what they did. Their period sets were never completely accurate but they had a distinctive look. Their cinematography was often stunning. Most importantly they had the ability to tell a story by making the eye follow it rather than by blowing it past the viewer. All of the films have been restored beautifully and show these facets to their fullest advantage.

Hammer also had a group of actors who were (and still are) largely unknown outside of the U.K. There were some notable exceptions though. One was the late Oliver Reed who appears in three of these films. Another was Peter Cushing. People seeing his work for the first time will be getting a look at one of the great stylists of the last century. This man could convey sweeping shifts in emotion with just the slightest variation in his manner. He was also a charismatic performer who brought flair, individualism and an immense amount of professionalism to his craft. There has never been, and likely never will be, enough actors of his sort.

Brides of Dracula ****

Dracula never makes an appearance in this film but that's no reason to avoid it. Peter Cushing is splendid as Van Helsing. David Peel matches him step for step as the villain of the piece and Martita Hunt gives a stunning performance as the mother of the cursed youth. Yvonne Monlaur (as the Baron's intended victim) isn't as strong but that's mostly because her character wasn't given as much depth as the other principals. The story flows decently and the action scenes are strong. The film (now restored to its original aspect ratio) is a feast for the eyes.

The Curse of the Werewolf ***

Anyone who hasn't seen this picture already is apt to wonder if the right movie has been put on the disc-it takes that long to really get going. The film's climax is worth the wait though. Oliver Reed (once he's finally introduced) gives a moving and chilling portrayal of the stricken young man. The supporting cast is solid and the make-up job for the creature is good enough that it stands the test of time well.

The Phantom of the Opera ****

This is an excellent version of this story, far superior to the one filmed in 1940, and even solid when compared to the 1925 classic. Herbert Lom gives a strong performance as the title character. His performance is supported by strong work from Heather Sears and Edward De Souza and nicely countered by a classic turn from Michael Gough. The story is told neatly and the look of the film is brilliant. The lighting is not as good as what was set up for ""Brides of Dracula"" and the overall ""finish"" is less lustrous (because the studio used Eastman Color rather than Technicolor) but it's still a fine example of the visual flair Hammer brought to the medium.

Paranoiac ****

Oliver Reed is cast as a young man who has even more bats in his belfry than the rest of is family does, which is saying something-this brood is a group of twisted bow-ties if ever there was one. The film is one of two in this set that's shot in black and white. It's also a pretty good one. There are plenty of twists and turns in the plot and most of them are believable. The cinematography is excellent and the performances are all good. Reed goes over the top with his part but does it with the type of flair that separates distinguished actors from half cooked hams.

Kiss of the Vampire (Rip Van Pickled: Vampire Hunter) ***

This (like a few others films in here) starts slowly but ends up being an intriguing tale. Showing vampires as cultured and educated beings and the designated slayer drowning his burden in booze are ideas that make absolute sense. Some terry-cloth undies from the 1960's show up in this piece that's set in the 19th century and the members of the vampire coven come off looking like a group of KKK disciples going hood-less but the story (after the first half hour) flows nicely and the performances are decent.

Nightmare ****

This is a chilling little gem that would be an excellent entry in any set of psychological thrillers. The performances from an ensemble cast of actors that had almost no exposure in North America are excellent. The cinematography is fabulous as well. This is one of the two films in the set that was shot in black and white and it's an excellent example of how the lack of colour can enhance the atmosphere of a film. All of it works in service of a story that flows nicely while taking enough twists and turns to satisfy any lover of classic whodunits.

Night Creatures ****

This may be the best film in this set (though it has strong competition from ""Brides of Dracula""). Peter Cushing's performance as a man confronted by his own nature is riveting. The rest of the cast falls only marginally short of the standard he sets. There are some genuinely eerie moments but ultimately, it succeeds as well as it does because of how intelligently it addresses the themes of good, evil and redemption.

The Blockhead of Frankenstein **

Or at least that's what it should have been called. This version of the creature has a ""head"" that looks like papier-mch mask with a brick glued to the forehead. ""The Evil of Frankenstein"" has some strong points but even Peter Cushing and a strong supporting cast aren't enough to save a film that's burdened with that makeup job and some laughable holes in the storyline. This is easily the weakest entry in the set.",1130630400,17,5536,4.587044534412955

(""Phantom"" while not as elaborate as the latest version, is still better than the two TV remakes and the dreadful Robert Englund version.)  If you pay careful attention, however, notice that the picture of the Phantom on the inside is not Herbert Lom but Claude Rains.  They had the same problem with the Gary Cooper collection when the had pictures from Ronald Colman's silent version of ""Beau Geste"" instead of Gary Cooper's!

It is one of those scenes that you have to see to believe.  But when you do, you want to see it over and over again.  There is also a priceless scene in Brides where a witch-like woman coaxes a vampire from a grave as if encouraging a birth.  This witch has the most demonic laugh I've ever heard.

2333745,5,B0009X770O,"""The Hammer Horror Series: The Franchise Collection"" represents one of the best multi-movie DVD bargains I've had the fortune of obtaining -- eight full-length motion pictures offered up by Universal Studios Home Entertainment for a more-than-reasonable sum of currency. Hard to beat that with a stick (even one of those pointed sticks that Doctor Van Helsing carries around with him all the time). :-)

I had never seen even one of these eight Hammer films prior to getting this excellent DVD collection (which was released by Universal on September 6th, 2005). And after watching these two jam-packed DVDs, I have a whole new appreciation and admiration for the scary-movie factory known as ""Hammer Films"".

Some of the movies in this 2-Disc set are rarities, having seldom been seen by anybody since their theatrical releases in the 1960s. All eight films here were made in the early portion of the 1960s (spanning the years 1960 to 1964). And Universal has done a superb job of restoring these films to near-pristine condition. It's hard to imagine any of these movies looking any better than they do via these Digital Discs. Each one has been given the preferred Anamorphic Widescreen treatment by Universal, too.

Here's what this spiffy collection contains...........

DISC #1:

""THE BRIDES OF DRACULA"" (1960; 1 hr., 26 min.; Color; 1.66:1 DVD Aspect Ratio) ..... On tap for ""Brides"" is the ever-present Hammer Films' duo of Peter Cushing, as vampire stalker ""Dr. Van Helsing"", and Terence Fisher, who was the director of the film. Fisher practically made a career out of directing many of Hammer's finest screen efforts.

""Brides"" is a pretty good Dracula outing, but it's not one of my all-time favorite vampire flicks. What we really need here (instead of David Peel) is the imposing figure of Christopher Lee as ""The Count"". But Chris isn't here, and we're left with Peel's version of the suave Transylvanian blood-sucker (although he isn't known as ""Dracula"" in this movie; he goes by ""Baron Meinster"" here).

Peter Cushing, age 47 here, is excellent (as per the norm) in his role as the tireless vampire hunter.

This film, which premiered on July 7, 1960, came fairly closely on the heels of Hammer's first (and arguably best) Dracula venture, 1958's ""Horror Of Dracula"", which had Mr. Lee donning the cape and fangs for the first time of many. It would be another six years after the release of ""Brides"" before the king of vampires would be resurrected with Chris Lee in the title role again (which occurred in 1966's ""Dracula: Prince Of Darkness"").

The DVD furnishes us with a beautifully-restored print of ""The Brides Of Dracula"". The old ""Universal International"" spinning-globe logo is also intact at the beginning of most of the films in this set. And that logo looks to be in fine shape, too, thanks to these fine digital transfers.

---------------------

""THE CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF"" (1961; 1 hr., 33 min.; Color; 1.85:1 DVD Aspect Ratio) ..... This is a delicious Terence Fisher-directed Hammer horror gem, which first appeared in movie theaters on May 1, 1961. Oliver Reed and Clifford Evans occupy the top of the cast listing for this well-written and nicely-paced werewolf tale. I truly enjoyed Reed's performance as the tortured ""Leon"", who fully realizes what his ultimate fate must be.

Only once during the film do we witness Reed's transformation into the hairy nocturnal creature, and that comes just nine minutes prior to the end of the picture. But I think that was a wise decision to keep the full-fledged beast off screen until near the very end. (Which put me in mind of another top-notch thriller that kept its ""creature"" hidden from audience view until deep into the movie's running time, building the suspense to a fever pitch for as long as the director dare -- ""Jaws"".)

And the well-timed camera cuts during the last reel of ""Curse"" allow us to see Reed's exceptional werewolf make-up for just the right amount of time before cutting away from it. A first-class Hammer production all the way. And the film looks scrumptious on the DVD too. Not a blemish to be found (through this writer's eyes anyway). The rich music score comes through just fine as well, via the DVD's crisp-sounding Dolby Digital Mono soundtrack.

In addition to the splendid performances turned in by Reed and Evans, ""Curse"" also features the acting talents of Anthony Dawson, whom I always enjoy watching on the screen. Richard Wordsworth is also worthy of mention. He does a very nice job as ""the beggar"". A pretty fair (and gritty) make-up job was done on him too.

And then there's also Yvonne Romain, who brings a set of two items to this film that must be seen to be believed (pause the DVD at the 18:50 mark in the movie to have the full meaning of this comment illustrated). ... ~wink~ ... Sorry about that. I just couldn't resist. And, to give credit where appropriate credit is due, I was reminded of Miss Romain's standout feature(s) in another person's review for this movie that I read at the IMDB website, which struck me as hilarious when I read it.

Two alternate titles have been used for this film -- ""The Wolfman"" and ""The Curse Of Siniestro"".

---------------------

""THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA"" (1962; 1 hr., 24 min.; Color; 2.00:1 DVD Aspect Ratio) ..... Many different movie versions of ""Phantom"" have been made over the years. This is the 1962 Hammer version, directed by Terence Fisher. Herbert Lom stars as ""The Phantom"". Heather Sears, Michael Gough, and Thorley Walters co-star.

A rather unspectacular Hammer flick, in my opinion. But it's redeemed a bit by the film's finale, which features a nifty dramatic climax to the story.

This early-'60s color version of ""The Phantom Of The Opera"" was first seen in theaters on June 25th of 1962.

---------------------

""PARANOIAC"" (1963; 1 hr., 20 min.; B&W; 2.35:1 DVD Aspect Ratio) ..... I was expecting a ""B""-grade type of Drive-In movie when I watched ""Paranoiac"". But I was pleasantly surprised. It rises above that ""B"" level, IMO.

Initially seen in movie theaters on the date of May 15, 1963, and directed by Freddie Francis (who, like Terence Fisher, was another staple behind the camera at Hammer Studios), ""Paranoiac"" stars Oliver Reed and Janette Scott in a twisted and macabre story of sibling rivalry, greed, booze, money, murder, madness, suicide, hidden identities, and rotting corpses in the cellar ... with a hint of incest tossed in for good measure.

This mixture produces a pretty nice little tale, with top-caliber acting performances by the whole cast. Reed is delightfully evil and over-the-top in his nifty role. As the film progresses, it's easy to see that Reed's elevator doesn't quite go all the way to the top floor. :)

For trivia fans -- Twelve years before making this movie, Janette Scott played Jimmy Stewart's young daughter in the very good 1951 drama ""No Highway In The Sky"".

This black-and-white DVD transfer is flawless-looking. I doubt that this picture could possibly look any better.

A definite ""thumbs-up"" rating to ""Paranoiac"".

---------------------

DISC #2:

""THE KISS OF THE VAMPIRE"" (1963; 1 hr., 28 min.; Color; 1.85:1 DVD Aspect Ratio) ..... I enjoyed this film immensely. It's yet another nicely-photographed Hammer presentation, which made its theater debut on September 11, 1963. Don Sharp served as director.

""Kiss"" stars Hammer veterans Clifford Evans and Edward de Souza, along with Jennifer Daniel, Barry Warren, and Noel Willman. Daniel and de Souza play ""Marianne and Gerald Harcourt"", a just-married couple who have had the misfortune of becoming stranded near ""Chateau Ravna"", a large castle owned by the seemingly-hospitable ""Dr. Ravna"" (Willman). But we soon learn that Ravna is better known for his ""bite"" than for his gracious table manners. Willman makes a pretty good ""head vampire"" here. He's no Christopher Lee; but then, who is?

Another reason to recommend ""The Kiss Of The Vampire"" is for the feature-film debut of 19-year-old Isobel Black (who plays ""Tania""). The alluring Miss Black has only a small part in the film, but she's worth focusing on. I could watch her sink her teeth into victims all day long. ;)

Some good old-fashioned gothic touches adorn this picture too, e.g.: horse-drawn carriages, the old castle, a fog-encased gravesite, and a terrific bat-filled finale. And the opening ""shovel"" scene provides a chilling beginning to the film. The set designs are excellent, and the color photography is warm and inviting.

A prime example of the lush color cinematography found here can be located at the 23:50 mark in the movie. If you pause the DVD at that point, you'll stop on an image of Dr. Ravna's handsome grand piano, which photographed beautifully.

""The Kiss Of The Vampire"" (which is also known by the alternate title ""Kiss Of Evil"") had an earlier DVD release. But I'm doubting the film looked this good on that other disc. The audio has a little bit of background hiss, but it's not overly distracting. Overall, it's another very pleasing DVD presentation.

Favorite ""Kiss"" dialogue:
GERALD HARCOURT -- ""Oh my God!""
DR. RAVNA -- ""God is hardly involved, Mr. Harcourt.""

(That's for sure. LOL.)

---------------------

""NIGHTMARE"" (1964; 1 hr., 22 min.; B&W; 2.35:1 DVD Aspect Ratio) ..... For my money, this enticing little 1964 treasure is the biggest and best prize in this two-disc package. ""Nightmare"" really bowled me over. It is a fabulously-done psychological chiller from the United Kingdom, directed by Freddie Francis and written by Jimmy Sangster.

I've read several unflattering on-line reviews for this film, and I just scratch my head in bewilderment after reading some of them -- because I couldn't disagree more with such generally negative assessments of ""Nightmare"". It is true that the viewer will certainly have to toss a bit of ""logic"" aside while watching this flick. But even so, this film works extremely well, IMO.

The film's cast is absolutely wonderful. Each acting portrayal here is spot-on perfect. The cast features Moira Redmond, Jennie Linden, David Knight, Irene Richmond, and Brenda Bruce. Linden and Redmond are particularly fun to watch here. Each of them is perfectly believable in their respective parts.

Insanity seems to have a foothold on those who live at ""High Towers"" estate. But WHO exactly is crazy? And WHO exactly are the ones who are trying to drive some of the others in the house ""crazy""? Those are the questions at hand in ""Nightmare"".

The film takes an abrupt turn at almost exactly the halfway point in the picture, with the main character, ""Janet"" (played by Linden), disappearing from the movie entirely. But this sudden fork in the road doesn't derail the film in the least. It turns into a cleverly-conceived ""whodunnit"", that keeps the viewer guessing till the very end.

Spooky atmosphere and stunningly-gorgeous black-and-white photography abound in large doses throughout this film. Several scenes show mysterious unknown figures wandering the darkened corridors of the large estate late at night. These scenes are strengthened by the exquisite work done by cinematographer John Wilcox, who deserves a well-earned tip of the hat for creating some truly memorable and scary images during the course of this film. And Universal's breathtaking Anamorphic Widescreen DVD transfer here makes Mr. Wilcox's photography look even more impressive.

The film's clarity and visual detail, especially during the many dark shadowy scenes, had me wondering aloud how it was possible for this movie to have been made so many decades ago. It looks almost brand-new here. ""Paranoiac"", the other of the two B&W films in this collection, exhibits very similar video perfection.

""Nightmare"" is bolstered even further by a good, mood-enhancing music score, which helps guide us through the dimly-lit hallways of ""High Towers"" at just the right tempo. Excellent, spooky stuff here. Just excellent.

""Nightmare"" is certainly no low-grade ""B"" picture. With acting and cinematography executed with as much care and precision as we see in this film, it ranks as a top-grade thriller/chiller/mystery, and is a motion picture that, in my opinion, is deserving of a generous helping of praise and adulation.

June 17, 1964, was the USA theatrical release date for this film, which was known by a different title in the U.K. -- ""Here's The Knife Dear, Now Use It"". It premiered in England on April 19, 1964.

---------------------

""NIGHT CREATURES"" (1962; 1 hr., 22 min.; Color; 2.00:1 DVD Aspect Ratio) ..... I didn't care for this film at all. It was a bit of a painful task, in fact, having to trudge through to the end of this incoherent mess, which is replete with pirates, ghostly ""phantoms"" on horseback, a few assorted senseless murders, coffins filled with bootleg liquor, and a tongueless maniac on the loose.

And then add in Peter Cushing in kind of a ""triple"" role, as the presumed-dead ""Captain Clegg"", a smuggler, and the local clergyman. (And that doesn't even count his role as one of the ""Marsh Phantoms"" here too.) ;)

Mr. Cushing tries his best here, and certainly gives a very lively and spirited performance. But even Peter's considerable talents can't rescue this hodge-podge of nonsense from the ""disaster"" file. Well, at least there are seven Hammer winners to counter this one misfire in this DVD set.

A lot of people praise this film up one side and down the other. But it just wasn't my cup of tea at all. Perhaps it will look better if I give it a second screening some day. Some month. Some year. :-)

""Night Creatures"" is the USA title of this flick. It was released in the U.K. on June 7, 1962, as ""Captain Clegg"". It had never before been released on a home-video format prior to this Universal DVD release.

""Creatures"" does emit very good-looking video quality. It certainly has to get high marks for that, if for nothing else.

---------------------

""THE EVIL OF FRANKENSTEIN"" (1964; 1 hr., 27 min.; Color; 1.85:1 DVD Aspect Ratio) ..... Peter Cushing is back once again (as ""Baron Frankenstein"") in this enjoyable monster excursion, which debuted in movie theaters back on May 8th, 1964. Directed by Freddie Francis.

This isn't the best ""Frankie"" movie ever made, but it's certainly not bad either. Mr. Cushing, as always, is superb in his role as the frustrated scientist bent on creating a ""life force"" out of an assortment of spare body parts. Thank goodness the Baron's laboratory is located where raging thunderstorms are frequent occurrences. ;)

""Evil"" Nitpick -- In the scene where ""The Creature"" is hypnotized and sent out on his mission to ""hurt"" two of the village's citizens, I'd like to know just exactly HOW the monster is supposed to know WHO it is he was supposed to ""hurt"" (or where exactly he was supposed to find these people). I guess we're to assume the beast got really smart all of a sudden and asked a local merchant for the addresses of his two victims. LOL.

""The Creature"" is played by the little-known Kiwi Kingston. Like the other movies assembled in this set, the video quality excels for this Frankenstein picture, too. The audio is a trifle scratchy in places, but generally okay.

---------------------

So, in the final analysis, my top personal faves from this 8-Movie Hammer assortment turned out to be ""The Kiss Of The Vampire"" and the two black-and-white entries in this batch (and the only two that were filmed in the wide Hammerscope and Cinemascope ratio of 2.35:1) -- ""Nightmare"" and ""Paranoiac"".

A major reason why I find both of those non-color movies very engaging is due to the chill-inducing B&W photography that is readily apparent in both films. There's something about the combination of ""Black-And-White"", ""Spooky And Shadow-Filled Nighttime Cinematography"", and ""Anamorphic Widescreen"" that's right up my alley.

------------------------------------------

What does it come in? ...........

""The Hammer Horror Series"" comes well-packed in a simple (yet at the same time elegant and classy-looking) folding Digipak DVD case, with a cleverly-designed open-ended outer slipcase box, which sports a clear ""window"" on the front. When the inner case is slid into the outer cover, a completed piece of ""Hammer Horror"" imagery can be seen through the ""window glass"" on the box front.

Small versions of some of the original promotional artwork for each film adorn the inner portions of the box. Nice packaging touches. Although why in the world Universal has elected to make the inner box exit its slipcase home from the LEFT side is a mystery to me. Universal has done this with many of its DVD boxed sets, which seems backwards to my way of thinking. Would a book ever open on the LEFT? Quite obviously not; and the disc trays of any DVD set should, IMO, slide out from the right-hand side, not the left. But, that's a very minor packaging complaint.

Two double-sided (DVD-18) discs rest firmly (but not too firmly) inside the Digipak's innards. There are two movies on each side of each disc. No special features here at all. The trailers for a few of these almost-forgotten Hammer gems would have been nice to see here. But I'm certainly not going to raise the roof about the absence of bonus material when I'm getting 8 full-length movies for such a bargain-basement price.

The Menus on these discs are simplistic perfection -- quick, easy to navigate, no annoying repetitive music, and static in design. Each film's Menu has choices for ""Scenes"", ""Languages"", and ""Play Feature"". Photos from the various movies fill up the individual Menu screens.

In addition to the well-done Anamorphic Widescreen video, each of the films in this collection also includes a more-than-adequate English Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono soundtrack. And two of the movies (""Brides"" and ""Frankenstein"") also contain a Spanish DD 2.0 Mono track as well.

Subtitles are provided for each film -- in English, French, and Spanish.

Skips?/Freezes?/Lock-Ups? .... Many consumers have had a world of trouble loading up and/or properly playing these DVDs. However, I experienced only one very minor glitch during the playing of any of the eight films on these two discs. That one video hiccup occurred toward the end of ""Nightmare"", when the picture froze up for one minute and seventeen seconds at the 1:11:40 mark into the film. But the remainder of the movie played perfectly through to its end.

---------------------

My Hammer Finale........

For a hearty Hammer horror-fest, this 2-DVD compilation includes all the right ingredients required for a screaming good time at the movies.

With more than 11 full hours of chills and frights in a compact 2-Disc boxed set, ""The Hammer Horror Series"" is a bargain that even Dr. Van Helsing couldn't drive a stake through.",1129248000,10,18753,5.003857280617165

I bought this set and have played the movies with no problem because I am only watching one per viewing.  My old dvd player was freezing up and acting all crazy and sh*T, when I got rid of it, my new one started doing the same thing until i put my hand on top of it and WOW, major hot spot.  So now I have placed my dvd player on stilts so to speak, so it is not receiving heat from my other electronic equipment and it is by a window that stays open while I play my movies so it can keep cool.....I SWEAR by this.  Oh, and the movie quality of these discs is so incredible, Brides of Dracula was like 3D it was so clear and colorful.  GREAT SET, thank you Universal!!

2333748,4,B0009X770O,"Wonderful films from the golden age of Hammer horror, and yet there are some real problems with the DVDs themselves. I had big problems watching Brides, Curse, Night Creatures and Frankenstein -- pictures freezing, causing computer programs to crash etc. Four films on one disc seems to be asking for trouble. I have heard the same complaints from other Hammer fans.

Having said that, there can be no complaining about the films themselves.

Brides of Dracula is a sumptuously rendered instalment in the Dracula series, albeit without the Count himself. It's perhaps the most lavish of all Hammer's productions.

Curse of the Werewolf is one of the alltime classic werewolf tales, brilliantly realized by director Terence Fisher and a classic make-up by Roy Ashton on top form.

Phantom of the Opera is patchy, with some severe holes in the mechanics of the plot. Nevertheless, there are a few interesting flourishes, and a great underground set from Bernard Robinson.

Paranoiac is a far-fetched thriller, but entertaining.

Kiss of the Vampire is a Hitchcockian horror nightmare, meticulously executed by Hammer stalwart Don Sharp. Noel Willman makes a great vampire.

Nightmare is a thriller along the lines of Paranoiac. There are some terrifying sequences early on that live up to the film's title; there's a lull in the middle, but it picks up again. A quality production.

Hammer made some great pirate adventures, and Night Creatures is one of the best of them. The studio brings some great gothic horror touches to this tale of smugglers and the like. Michael Ripper and Peter Cushing stand out in the cast.

Evil of Frankenstein is entertaining in places, although on a critical level it's a mess, with even Cushing struggling to save it. It is hard to believe the embarrassingly crude monster make-up was designed by the genius who gave us Oliver Reed's unforgettable werewolf.

All-in-all, though, these were films that have been crying out for DVD releases for some time, and I am glad to see them, if disappointed in the quality of the discs themselves. I shall be returning mine!",1128902400,5,2095,5.011527377521614
2333749,5,B0009X770O,"I've managed, yet again, to get a good set of disks the first time out, and while I sympathize(yeah, I know, I thought it was spelled sympathise too, but I looked it up and it's not) with those who have to repeatedly return sets to find a good one, I can't help but give this five stars since I personally have nothing to complain about. Not only that, but I was actually shocked at the quality of the picture and even the sound here. If that doesn't deserve a five star rating, what does?

  For the price, and the number of movies included, I was expecting vhs quality picture, but was still willing to buy the set for the space it would make on my shelf by replacing my tapes of some of these movies. However, aside from the odd scratch here and there, these films very nearly look like new releases, and Kiss Of The Vampire even improves on the quality of the previous release by Image. Brides Of Dracula, in particular, is the standout of the set. It's so clear that I almost felt like I could step into the tv. I've seen it dozens of times on vhs, but this time I noticed sound effects in the background that I don't remember hearing before.

  If Universal could just work out all the bugs, this would be the ideal way to package older movies, particularly the more obscure ones. I mean, sure, I would have been willing to pay more for individual disks, or even the same price for any two of these titles, but I got the quality I would have expected for a much lower price, and it takes up about half as much space as a single vhs tape. Again, I personally have no complaints, and if the only way everyone can be happy is to start releasing everything on individual disks then so be it, but I really hope Universal is able to find a way to make this format work.",1127952000,5,1769,4.234421364985163
2333750,4,B0009X770O,"I guess I'm one of the lucky ones because I've watched all 8 films and had no problems:  My ranking best to worst:

1.  Brides of Dracula - Probably the best Hammer film ever made

2.  Curse of the Werewolf - Great classic werewolf movie, not quite as good as ""The Wolfman"" (1941) with Claude Rains, but a very close 2nd (the 1st chick in this film was smokin')

3.  Night Creatures - Never seen it before, but heard of it - really cool flick (same chick from Curse of the Werewolf - Tommy Likey)

4. Nightmare - Really creepy film - lots of suspense, really well done

Tie (5 & 6) - Kiss of the Vampire and Evil of Frankenstein - both good

7. Paranoiac - Oliver Reed plays a drunk and likes to fight - similar to his real life

8. Phantom of the Opera - Horror and Musicals, hello!!!!!

And we're supposed to believe scarface lives under the streets in a sewer (complete with pipe organ and idiot savant- okey dokey)

4 out of 5 stars because of lack of extras - would have at least liked the trailers - But brides of dracula and curse of the werewolf for under $30.00 - the other films are just gravy - fuggetaboutit",1127692800,5,1119,4.172897196261682

2333753,5,B0009X770O,"It was with joy that I, along with the many other Hammer Film fans, awaited this release.  Eight Hammer films, none of which (save one) ever having been commercially released in this country on DVD, for barely more in cost than a single DVD movie.  There was a bit of concern, however, as to whether cramming 8 films onto two discs would result in inferior image quality.  The verdict's in, and those concerns were unfounded.  Since Hammer fans are likely familiar with most of the titles, this review will focus on the technical aspects.

All of the titles presented in this release, with the exception of the rare Night Creatures, had been previously released on laserdisc format.  I owned all of them, which I transferred to DVD, so I was able to do an A/B comparison.  All films are presented in widescreen format.

Kicking off the film fest is Brides of Dracula, generally regarded as the best of the Hammer vampire films behind Horror of Dracula.  When compared to the laserdisc print, Brides appeared to be a bit brighter in image quality, although the difference was not huge.  Curse of the Werewolf had slightly less richness and color saturation than the laserdisc version, but was nonetheless clear, clean and detailed.

The two black & white releases, Paranoiac and Nightmare were both sharp, with little evidence of dropout or scratches.  These films were virtually indistinguishable from the laserdisc releases.

The under-rated Phantom of the Opera and The Evil of Frankenstein both exhibited fine image quality, improving on the laserdisc editions, particularly in contrast and detail.

Kiss of the Vampire is the only title that had been released on DVD previously, on the Image label.  In comparing the two, the version on this set was sharper, cleaner (free of video artifacts and scratches) and had better color rendition (skin tones were much more life-like than on the Image release).  The one odd difference between the two was that the Image release was presented in a 1.66:1 aspect ratio (as it was in its original release), whereas this version is in a 1.85:1 ratio.  The result is that there is no more picture information on the sides than the Image release, but slightly less image information on the tops and bottoms of the picture.  The differences were minor, but it's puzzling as to why this was done.

Finally, the obscure Night Creatures (a/k/a `Captain Clegg') a film never released on DVD nor laserdisc in this country.  It was a bit different than the other Hammer films in a few ways.  It was not strictly a Hammer production, but rather a `Hammer-Major Film'.  It's also not a horror film at all, but rather a kind of crime drama/thriller/mystery set in the 18th century.  Starring the always-great Peter Cushing, it featured Oliver Reed and Yvonne Romain, who both starred in Curse of the Werewolf.  In Night Creatures, they were lovers.  In Curse... Reed played Romain's son, the product of a brutal rape.  Also interesting is that Hammer regular bit player Michael Ripper (who usually appeared as a cabbie, a grave robber or such) had his most significant role in this film, playing a key character.

This is a real treat for Hammer fans, and certainly fills in some large gaps in my Hammer collection.  Now, if we could see a second such collection with remaining unreleased (on domestic DVDs) titles such as Twins of Evil, The Man Who Could Cheat Death, Vampire Circus and The Quatermass Xperiment, there would be even more to cheer about.  For now, however, this collection is probably the DVD deal of the decade.",1127606400,2,3559,4.855721393034826
2333754,1,B0009X770O,I really give the overall content of the set a five star rating however due to the fact I had to watch and return two copies before I found ONE that worked I can't have much positive to say about the package. I just watched my Bela Lugosi collection today and found the same problem. All the problems listed by other people are TRUE. Beware when you purchase ANY Universal DVD dual layered disc!! We as consumers all need to band together and continue to email Universal until they get the idea that their quality control is FAILING!!,1127520000,27,534,4.459183673469388
2333765,3,B0009X770O,"I love these Hammer Horror movies, particularly CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF and BRIDES OF DRACULA. When I saw MCA was releasing all their Hammer titles in one DVD set, I pre-ordered it immediately. So far I have had two of these DVD sets, both defective. The quality of the movies themselves, picture and sound-wise, look very good, but the DVDs lock-up, freeze, simply are so badly manufactured that the joy of buying this set quickly goes away. Had Universal put one movie per DVD side, this may have saved this DVD set. Squeezing two movies per side - Universal saving a few pennies - has resulted in apparently a whole bunch of defective Hammer Horror Series DVD sets being purchased. How stupid can Universal get? With all the resulting returns of defective product, how is that going to save them money??? Great copies of great movies - if you can get them to play on your DVD player.",1127433600,7,884,4.60126582278481
2333766,1,B0009X770O,"My first copy of this collection seemed defective to me and I exchanged it for another.  I am keeping this new set even though I need at least two separate DVD players just to get through disk one.  I haven't even played disk two yet, but I'm guessing it will have the same problems as the last set - pixilating, screen freezes and other anomalies.  Universal is counting on me and all the other fans to cave in a keep these disks on account of the fact that these movies are so rare and their release was risky at best.  CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF may be a big film, but a little-known gem like PARANOIAC just doesn't have the recognition to make it a prestige release. That's why Universal lumped them all on two disks, known as DVD-18s, which are double sided with two layers on each side.  In other words, there are four pressings done to make each disk instead of one or two, as is the custom with most DVDs.  Four layers are far more likely to have defects, and that's why there have been so many complaints.

In the past, Universal has used DVD-18s on high profile series, like the Monster Legacy disks, as well as low profile, like Tremors.  People had complained about DVD-18s back then, but Universal didn't listen. And here we are now.  The Bela Lugosi Collection is having the same problems.

Universal used to help set the standard for DVDs.  Now, they are lowering the bar -- showing what a major studio will do for a fast buck.  And what's worse, Universal knows exactly what they are doing.  No other major studio has so consistently released product that it knows will not play on a wide assortment of players.  Net Flix won't take the risk, however, since they rent out single sided editions of these same disks.",1127174400,23,1725,4.452229299363057
2333767,3,B0009X770O,"I am a huge fan of Hammer Horror Movies. The Brides of Dracula and The Curse of the Werewolf, were worth the price alone.

That is, the quality is fantastic until the defective discs stop playback and lock up the DVD player.  Yes, as so many others have mentioned, this is YET ANOTHER Universal Studios release made using defective double sided discs.  Why do they bother?  It can't be good for Amazon either with customers returning all these defective sets.  You'd think the Studio would get the message.  I guess I'm just going to quit buying any more Universal releases until they fix this mess.",1126656000,16,622,4.712962962962963
2333769,1,B0009X770O,"Universal should really stop using dual sided discs.  While the quality, and movies in this set are fantastic, the discs are garbage.  I was watching The Evil of Frankenstein, with it's eerie atmosphere, and enjoying it, and then it happened.  The disc locked up, and wouldn't play again.  I had to power my dvd player off, and restart it to eject the disc.  I don't know what the problem is at Universal, but the last three sets I purchased(Buck Rogers, Quincy, and of course this one) have all been defective.  They are all from Universal, and are all dual sided discs.  They all seem to have the same problem of ""locking up"" at one point or another on the set.

 Universal please stop doing this to consumers. Just recall them until the problem is corrected.",1126569600,19,761,4.5777777777777775
2333770,5,B0009X770O,"Universal has packaged all eight of their Hammer Films onto two discs and the quality is surprisingly excellent.

Some of the films even have snippets of footage reinstated after being cut for U.S. theatrical release.

The films are all in varying degrees quite good.  My favorites being BRIDES OF DRACULA, KISS OF THE VAMPIRE and the fun, underappreciated EVIL OF FRANKENSTEIN. And Hammer fans finally get to see NIGHT CREATURES which has never received a home video release.  I recall seeing photos of the ghostly marsh phantoms from my childhood and have always wanted to see this film--it doesn't disappoint.  Peter Cushing, as always, is superb in the lead role.

2333771,5,B0009X770O,"While rather sadly compiled on two discs, this is still a good collection of Hammer films.  The color films look great with gorgeous transfers. But the b&w ones don't fare so well with only passable prints. Yet I'm happy enough with this set that I can live with it. 8 films is a lot to divide between two discs so one can expect some quality to suffer. Extra care must also be taken so as not to scratch them as both sides hold two films each. So, all in all, this is still a must for Hammer fans and a collector's item as well. But one day I would like to see them in individual discs for better picture quality on the b&w ones. But as I said, the color ones make the set worth having.

2333785,5,B0009X770O,"This is a good set of Hammer films but I am going to buy this set for one movie only. That film is Night Creatures, titled Captain Clegg in the UK. I am not surprised that many of the reviews here are not familiar with it. The film has not been shown on TV in over 2 decades. I spent years tracking down a bootleg copy. The story concerns pirates and smuggling. This film is not a remake of the Disney film ""Dr. Syn"". They were filming at the same time from the same source material. Disney sued Hammer and won. Hammer made changes in their film like changing the name of Dr. Syn to Dr. Blyss. The Scarecrow becomes a minor character in this film but even more eerie. Wait until you see the opening scene with the Marsh Phantoms. It will stay in your memory forever. It is important to point out that this is not a film dealing with the supernatural, but has the feeling of a horror film throughout. It has that old fashioned kind of spookiness and atmosphere that makes it an ideal film to watch on Halloween, if you would rather not watch the slasher type films. Many people, myself included, consider this Hammer's finest film. The rest of the films here are not too shabby in their own right. Hammer's version of ""Phantom of the Opera"" is here, and while I love Lon Chaney, this is my favorite version of the tale. Less horrible than other versions, which is strange for Hammer, the story includes the Phantom's origins which I found interesting. Lastly, I'll comment on ""Curse of the Werewolf"". You gotta see this as the only werewolf film featuring a blond wolfman, and if that dosen't pull you in, there is always Yvonne Romaine, who is also in Night Creatures. If I had not bought this set for Night Creatures, I would have bought it for Yvonne Romaine, who may have been one of the most beautiful women ever to appear in a motion picture.",1125187200,99,1847,4.387755102040816

For my money some of these films are national treasures for the UK and stand as the supreme high water mark for the golden age of fantasy/horror. Yes, you read it right!

 If you have not experienced Hammer this is a superb place to start.  With the current hollywood schlock that we are bombarded with daily, take a moment to look back and see what we have lost in the way of thoughtful, imaginative film productions.

Hollywood take note: We do not need your CGI laden, politicaly correct, uninspired refuse.  Hammer films continue to clean your plow FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE!",1124928000,5,684,4.565573770491803
2333787,5,B0009X770O,"I cannot believe I am the only one who loves this movie! What makes it so different is that the vampires are so cultured, ""living"" in Gothic splendour while waiting for new victims. There are some lovely moments, the pre titles sequence in the graveyard, the vampire visiting the grave to dig up her friend, the vampires ball, the slightly mad local vampire stalker. Only the bats at the end disappoint, but this was made in 1960 so one ought not to be surprised. A remake has been on the cards for some time now.

But what a terrific set of Hammer movies. Hopefully Werewolf will not be the heavily censored UK release.",1124668800,4,620,4.486725663716814
2333788,5,B0009X770O,"As of this writing, I haven't seen this DVD collection yet, so I can't comment on the picture and sound quality. However, Universal should be commended for releasing these classic films.
England's Hammer Films reinvigorated the horror genre back in the late '50s and '60s, beginning with the seminal ""Horror of Dracula"" and ""Curse of Frankenstein."" Their legendary gothic horrors led to a revival of the horror film and influenced several generations of filmmakers, like Martin Scorsese and Joe Dante.
This collection includes two genuine Hammer classics. ""Curse of the Werewolf"", directed by genre great Terence Fisher and starring a very young Oliver Reed, was Hammer's sole stab at the lycanthropy movie. Set in Spain, it is memorable for its unusual locations, great werewolf makeup (Reed was made up as a wolf man from the waist up, a cinematic first), and sympathetic performances. ""Brides of Dracula"", another Fisher-directed gothic horror, stars the wonderful actor Peter Cushing in perhaps his greatest performance, as vampire hunter Van Helsing. Dracula doesn't actually appear in the film, but David Peel makes an acceptable substitute as the vampire Baron Meinster. Look for a fantastic ending.
Three of the films I haven't seen yet--""Night Creatures""; ""Paranoiac"";and ""Nightmare."" Hurrah!(Three unseen Hammers on DVD is a definite cause for celebration!) The others are all good. ""Kiss of the Vampire"" is a stylish take on the vampire flick, with an ambitious climax marred by poor special effects (dozens of rubber bats flapping around on wires). The lush ""Phantom of the Opera"" is one of the better versions of Laroux's novel. ""The Evil of Frankenstein"" is weak, but features colourful photography and another excellent Cushing performance.
Overall, a must have for any horror fan.",1123113600,3,1796,5.327464788732394
2333789,5,B0009X770O,"Oh, my, this lass is in Hammer Horror Heaven!!!!!!  Films I have wanted on VHS and then DVD FINALLY coming out.  I am a dyed in the wool horror fan, and especially a Hammer fan.  To me they spoke to the fast, sexy, stylish horror film that rose in the late 50s and carried Hammer through for nearly 4 decades.  Gone were the stuffy Universal monster flicks in black and white  - Hammer worked with lush colour.  Gone were the cheakly made (thought enjoyable William Castle and Roger Corman quickies).  Hammer did a lot of location work, and even the sets they created were rich in details and so beautiful with full colour.  This contains some of their best works, some well-known and heralded by critics such as ""Brides of Dracula"", others are lesser known yet - to me are ones that I wanted to my collection.  Some now unseen for decades!  Most of these were never released in US on VHS or DVD.  So pop the popcorn and have a Hammer night of horror!

""Brides of Dracula"" has a misleading title.  Clearly they made a mistake turning Chris Lee to dust.  Dracula (Lee) isn't in this film at all.  The head vampire is David Peal and he isn't even connected to Drac.  Van Helsing (the great Peter Cushing) helps a young woman whose carriage broke down.  She was taken to a castle by a mysterious Baroness.  Once there, she discovers the Baroness keeps her mad son chained within quarters in the castle.  He sees her, calls her to come.  She finds the sexy son not mad at all, so she releases him.  Later young girls begin to have fang marks.  Cushing helped the young woman to her new post as teacher after the Baroness is found dead.  Sonny boy comes to call on the teacher, and naturally, Cushing must rush to the rescue.  One of Hammer's Best.

""Curse of the Werewolf"" is an understated, moody tale with Oliver Reed in the title role.  A man is tossed into the dungeon.  Later mad, when a young servant girl is tossed to him as sport, he rapes her.  Leon (Reed) is the result of that.  As he grows, he learns he is cursed.  Darkly handsome Reed (nephew of Carol Reed) was perfect for the roll.

Cushing and Lee team against in  ""The Evil of Frankenstein"".  A big flack ensured from Universal.  That had Boris Karloff's original monster makeup copyrighted, so Hammer had to ""rethink"" Lee's monster.  He brings a poignancy to the role that makes it his own.  With Hazel Court.

""Paranoic"" with  Oliver Reed again.  Sharp script by Jimmy Sangster is obviously a knock off version of Psycho, but has plenty of twist to keep you guess.  Also smartly direction by Freddie Francis.  Reed is coming into his own here.

Yes, yet another ""Phantom of the Opera"" What is it 12 versions now?  Terrance Fisher's remake has Herbert Lom as the scarred phantom.  Very underrated or little scene film that requires some
attention.

""Kiss of the Vampire"" is another vampire flick, no Cushing or Lee to make it a super classic, but still a worthy Hammer effort.  A man and wife wander into the wrong area again and the head vampire decides he wants the wife for his vampire cult.

 ""Captain Clegg"" was originally called ""Night Creatures"" and a couple other names.  This is a remake of Dr. Syn (recall the Disney film with Patrick McGoohan ""The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh?  Same story!)  Peter Cushing is the kindly reverend who is really the head of a smuggling ring trying to outwit the King's men.  Oliver Reed is his sidekick.  A super film I have long wanted and kept hoping Hammer would put it out.

Worth EVERY penny.

Film quality is sharp and in letter box.  Love it!",1122163200,7,3554,4.4929356357927785

About time Sony/Paramount released some more Hammers including These are the Damned, The Gorgon, Terror of the Tongs etc ( they have so far only released Revenge of Frankenstein and Die Die my Darling).

Overall an excellent collection of some the most highly regarded Hammer films as well as some more obscure ones. Some extras would have been great but credit to Universal for giving us the whole remastered slate in one go.",1121126400,2,533,4.720430107526882

Brilliant that all these films will be on DVD i hope the quality of them is brilliant hopefully they will be released in the UK and will be exactly the same format.

 I think that the Brides of Dracula is super the scenes are Fantastic and the atmoshepere created is chilling.

I think that Peter Cushing is the best Van Helsing ever he was great in the Horror of Dracula and he is even better in the Brides of Dracula my Favourite part is when Van Helsing jumps onto the burning Windmill and creates a cross and traps the vampire so he can't escape so he  dies.

8069225,5,B0009X770O,"I guess some of these Universal Franchise Collections can be tricky--as far as complaints about the movies on the double sided discs defecting. I know I had a few headaches with the 3rd volume of Abbott and Costello, but no such problems here. The movies themselves are all solid--more than a few of them being classics.

I believe the movie I anticipated most was ""Evil of Frankenstein."" A movie that seems to draw mixed reactions from Hammer fans--some of the complaints I've seen being that it copies the old Universal formula too much--but I enjoyed it. Hell, I would say it's the best of the Frankenstein series that I've seen so far. ""Phantom of the Opera"" was also a pleasant surprise, even better than the old Lon Chaney film.

All in all, 8 good movies that should please Hammer fans...",1497657600,,795,4.671428571428572
