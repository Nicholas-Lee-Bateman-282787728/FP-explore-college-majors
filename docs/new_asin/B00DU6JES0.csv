8597802,5,B00DU6JES0,"This limited set is now out of print and is getting harder to find at the original price.  The discs have been remastered and I have been told that they look much better than the original individual releases,  You can toggle the chapter mode to have each chapter marked at the start of each song throughout the series.  The bonus content is massive including the original animation from the pachinko games, karaoke versions of the songs, non-credit versions of the numerous endings, and a bunch of CM/promo clips.  Included is a full color 112 page art book, a 62 page storyboard book, and a 104 page book with individual episode synopsis and design works. There is also an extra disc that is filled with radio dramas.  This is easily one of the nicest sets out there.",1471996800,,768,4.617647058823529
