8707226,5,B00UKNFGCE,"Incredibly perfect directing, acting, and singing.  The documentary is wonderful, full of life lessons for new singers, and shows a person who not only knows her stuff but can teach it.  A ""creative animal"" indeed.  We think this is one of the best pair-of-concert-and-doc ever done.  Thank YouTube for showing her amazing talent.  Not-so-stuffy added comment for men:  she is gorgeous and her parody of a dominatrix is hilarious.  Look for her darling schoolgirl video on YouTube.  From another angle, this could be one of those How To Take Good Care of Yourself videos--she also is an exceptional cook, Yoga expert, runner, and life historian.",1457308800,3,645,5.076190476190476
8707227,5,B00UKNFGCE,"Canadian Soprano/Conductor Barbara Hannigan is truly remarkable. As a singer she is fully able to do justice the grand classical lines of Mozart concert arias (including an excellent trill !), and the radical sounds of Ligeti. As a conductor she has the frothy sounds of Rossini overtures and the Romanticism of Faure's PELLEAS well within her stylistic range, with an early folklorist Ligeti piece thrown in for good measure.
Not overly ""dramatic"" as a conductor, many of the details must have been worked out in rehearsal.
The Mahler Chamber Orchestra does superb work under her direction.
The sound recording is first rate.
The accompanying documentary is a fascinating glimpse at a performer who is truly intelligent and indefatigable..",1454025600,8,740,5.279661016949152
