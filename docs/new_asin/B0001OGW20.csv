You can tell that both Stanze and Garrels are big fans of David Lynch with its bizarre, expressive storyline that doesn't always make sense (although the pieces do all add up if you think about it) and interesting well-composed visuals.  The movie also has a very rich electronic soundtrack (which you can listen to separately on the DVD on an isolated track...very cool) which adds to the movie's twisted ambience.  I was also impressed by the performances.  DJ Vivona, who was great in ICE FROM THE SUN, does good work here, and Eli DeGeer gave a solid, emotional performance, but I thought Jason Allen Wolfe totally stole the show.  Where did this guy come from?  He did an awesome job in this and I was excited to read that he has a role in Stanze latest flick, DEADWOOD PARK.  Can't wait to check that one out!

CHINA WHITE SERPENTINE has lots of skin, solid acting, creative camera work, and a little blood thrown in for good measure.  What else can you ask for in a low-budget flick?  A great collaboration between two of the indie scenes more creative filmmakers.  Check it out!",1130544000,4,1353,4.595833333333333

In fact the best independent movie acting I have seen in ages.  Drug induced action with excellent character and story detail.  The ending was totally unexpected and amazingly twisted.",1121731200,3,328,5.113207547169812
8015665,4,B0001OGW20,"This movie packs an emotional punch.  The tripped-out, drug-amped characters -portrayed by Jason Allen Wolfe, Eli DeGeer, and Amanda Booth - are entangled in a web of deceit and sexual enslavement.  The story is represented beautifully with a mix of sexual and horrifying visuals coupled with well-acted roles that embody the downward spiral of drug and sex addictions.  The directing combination of low-budget movie veteran Eric Stanze (SAVAGE HARVEST, ICE FROM THE SUN, SCRAPBOOK) and relative newcomer Robin Garrels (INSANIAC) lends to a new look for independent movies.  The music score used, also adds to the whole experience, helping to immerse you in this twisted maze of a story.  I have watched this movie several times and it holds up each time I watch it.  I highly recommend this movie.",1121040000,7,798,5.1
