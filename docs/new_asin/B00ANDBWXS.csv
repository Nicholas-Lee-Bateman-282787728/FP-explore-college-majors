5459141,4,B00ANDBWXS,"This series is Forever long!!!  But I guess with fantasy thats easy to make happen.  It's got all the good stuff of the ones before.  It's not boxed with the same mix of episodes, so I'll have to rebuy 4 to get a few in between my previous 5 which is 10 episodes short from this one which starts at 100.  It doesn't say much in the detail, unfortunately, but I figured I'd need a bridge one(what I thought this one was)to get all episodes.  The characters are progressing slightly more and we're getting a little more action from the lesser characters.

I don't know if I'll get the Final Set... because one review said the English voice of Inuyasha and Kegome were different... that would bother me a lot... But I might get them and just watch in Japanese with subtitles.

Anyway, we are pleased and for sure I'm going to go ahead and get the 6&7 and new 4 to bridge to this new 5.

I don't mind about the lack of true box set or picts on the disk like some... although that was really artistically nice in the previous.  I'm not into Collecting or Fadist movements.  I just like the show for its entertainment value.  WINNER!  :)",1376784000,,1131,4.308056872037914

5459143,5,B00ANDBWXS,"I've been recording these on DVR to watch Sunday mornings since Toonami plays them so late, but though they now play the opening theme on both episodes, they skip the previews of next episodes, which are often hilarious. No need to miss them now!!",1367452800,,247,4.636363636363637
5459144,4,B00ANDBWXS,"I absolutely love the InuYasha series. This season is filled with action and the long encounter with the Band of Seven. Naraku continues his scheming and dealing with others whom he promises can have a shard of the Shikon jewel. Kikyo appears in this season and her story had an unexpected twist at Mount Hakurei. InuYasha and company get so much closer to Naraku but the powerful demon never makes it easy to catch him.

And now for the drawback . . . . I've purchased other seasons from Amazon and they were the box sets as pictured. When I received Season 5 in the mail, it was in simple DVD packaging; the discs were a generic purple, not decorated like the other seasons' discs. There was no listing of the episodes anywhere: not on the discs nor the case. I really should have sent it back right away and ordered it again, hoping to get the actual box set, but I couldn't wait to see the story unfold.

Nevertheless, if you like action, drama, and comedy, this is a perfect season to enjoy! Some of the new characters you'll love to hate and some of the original characters you may even hate to love. Mount Hakurei is definitely the turning point in the adventure. If you want to know what I mean, go ahead and purchase this season.",1365120000,15,1238,4.401746724890829

5459151,4,B00ANDBWXS,"At this point I'm getting so tired of Naraku. It's time for him to die. And I'm so ready for Inuyasha and Kagome to admit they love each other. It's also time for Kikyo to go to her grave. She's lingering to long and preventing Inuyasha and Kagome from having a relationship. I like her, It's just time.

5459160,5,B00ANDBWXS,"My first InuYasha DVDs were in Japanese voice format only, and they were already ""old"" when I discovered InuYasha in 2006.
Though I finally learned to speak passable Japanese, I thought that I should also purchase these contemporary ""English-speaking"" versions, for the future.
Yes, I do love this ""Feudal Fairy Tale""; ""InuYasha"" was my first anime love, and you never forget that one.

5459165,5,B00ANDBWXS,"Like MASH and Cheers, this is an example of a series starting to bog down after the first couple of seasons but being able to pull itself back together and end up better than ever. OK, so none of the kids watching Inuyasha will know what that meant. Let's just say that seasons 4, 5 and, so far, 6 have been pretty darn good.

Like Justified, the producers seem to have decided to go with a main bad guy(s) for an entire season and, while they are related to Naraku, the Band of Seven are their own story. While I'm a little tired of the whole Naraku thing, I can see that if he's defeated and Kagame's group gathers all the jewel shards the series will effectively end. It's nice to push Naraku into the background for a good long while lately. Actually, since InuYasha came first I guess Justified took their lead.

For more fun in the Feudal Era watch Season 5 of InuYasha!",1455926400,,876,4.303030303030303

5459174,5,B00ANDBWXS,"These reviews are all copies, because what else can I say about a great series that has many seasons?

These repackages are literally the same products and episodes, just condensed in terms of packaging and price.

Standard definition - so 4:3 ratio with obvious static and other SD flaws, but that's cool. There isn't much you can do when upconverting an original SD work.

There are Bluray discs of the final act and the movies, but that is probably all there will ever be.

Japanese Audio with English subs is indeed available on these discs.",1438992000,,545,4.705263157894737

5459201,5,B00ANDBWXS,"InuYasha is not just another annoying cartoon that you grit your teeth and tolerate as your kids and/or spouse watch. It is full of fantastical adventure, hilarious situations, deep and well-rounded characters that you cant help but fall in love with, and carefree fun for all ages.

This series holds true enough to anime standards that you instantly recognize it as Japanese anime. Don't worry - it has been dubbed in English for those of us who cannot read subtitles and watch a show at the same time. ;)  The best thing about InuYasha is that I never worry about what my kids might see or hear while watching this series. The worst thing on this show is a self proclaimed ""lecherous monk"" who occasionally touches girls' bottoms. He always gets an immediate slap to the face that leave a red handprint. Additionally, my husband and I LOVE to watch InuYasha with our kids because the storyline is so intricate and uniquely layered",1402876800,3,933,4.717791411042945
