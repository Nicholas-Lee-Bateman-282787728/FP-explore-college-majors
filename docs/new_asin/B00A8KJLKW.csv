Along the films runs out one may note the pulse and how the circumstances beginn to blow toward other latitudes. Watch this thoughtful and easy going movie.

Don't miss it and please reserve yourself the final!!!

The animators are worth their weight in gold.. did a very good job. The film was not too long, or tedious. An English version would go a long way.  The ending did hold a surprise and its a good film... think I will buy an English version of the novel

8548265,2,B00A8KJLKW,"How could a country that made such excellent films (Ex: ""Phantom Of The Opera"", ""Jack And The Cuckoo-Clock Heart"") come up with THIS?!?!

Mishima...God, Raul Julia must be rolling in his grave right now; The patriarch of the Tuvache clan is a disgraceful knock-off of the one-and-only Gomez Addams. Whereas Gomez is a whimsical man who cares about his family, Mishima is willing to off his youngest son just because he's 'bad for business'. Yes, the Addams's try to kill eachother on a daily basis; It's their way of being affectionate and what not. Wanting to kill your son to increase business is a whole 'nother thing.

And don't get me started on the daughter, Marilyn. You KNOW you royally screwed up when you've got a character who's just a blend of Helga, Mandy, and Wednesday.

Only two things saved this movie: The music and Alain. The opening song is quite catchy, but it's no Dionysos. And Alain could very well be the French's answer to Pinkie Pie.

So, in conclusion, let me say this:

This was a rough patch in France's glorious history in filmmaking.",1437955200,,1065,4.704301075268817
8548266,5,B00A8KJLKW,"A French animated comedy/musical by French director and comic book writer Patrice Leconte is hilariously funny.

Because there is no description of the film shown on this site, the story goes:
There is a family operating a shop that sells all the accoutrements for the perfect suicide - that is until the birth of the family's third child, Alan, who, to their horror and amazement, is born with a severe case of joie de vivre. All is about to change in the gloomy lives of this family and by extension the lives of their customers.

It is not the cutesy kind of animated film well known to North American audiences...it begins with a sense of doom and gloom and evolves into a totally opposite outlook on life. It may not appeal to everyone, but it made me laugh out loud.",1396656000,8,772,4.507142857142857
8548267,4,B00A8KJLKW,"Based on a novel of the same title by Jean Teule, ""The Suicide Shop"" (""Le magasin des suicides"") is a French animated film shot in 3D. This is a musical comedy, but is a very darkly funny one. I warn you that the Tuvaches here may look like ""The Addams Family,"" but Patrice Leconte's animation is never a family picture.

Set in a perpetually gloomy metropolis, where there is no sunshine and even a sad-eyed pigeon commits suicide (really), the film follows the story of the Tuvaches and their ""Suicide Shop,"" a ten-generation family-run business specializing in tools for suicide. The shop's owner Mishima (reference to Japanese writer Yukio Mishima) and his wife Lucrce (Lucrezia Borgia, of course) pride themselves on providing the ""best shopping experience"" for their customers with guaranteed satisfaction - meaning ropes, poisons, pistols, etc.

They have two children Vincent (named after Vincent van Gogh) and Marilyn (after Marilyn Monroe) helping their parents at the shop. The family's bizarre business thrives until another child is born. His name is Alan (from Alan Turing), and Alan grows up to be a happy and positive-thinking little boy, who sets out to change the way his family lives.

The musical songs are just okay. Characters are interesting, but storytelling is rather flat. The greatest asset of the film is the curiously attractive comic book-like designs of the dark and depressing city. The film's low-key humor has a cynical edge that is slowly replaced by something sweet, but not entirely. Perhaps, despite its subject matter, we should not take ""Le magasin des suicides"" too seriously, a dark comedy that intends to be happy and politically incorrect at the same time.",1379894400,4,1700,5.086021505376344
