8683136,5,B00OC38P1M,The audio effects on Cynara DVD were not the best quality.  Ambience noise was louder than the actresses voices.  Claire of the Moon had everything on it from drama to comedy.  The Perfect Ending and Elena Undone they just captivated my heart.,1445212800,2,243,4.738095238095238
