7960979,1,B000065CJL,What a piece of crap!  Don't waste your time or money.  All the good reviews about this movie must be from the director and actors or people connected to the film.  I would say it could be the worst indie film I've ever seen.  If I could give this pile of crap a negative stars I would give it 5.,1480982400,,296,3.8833333333333333
7960980,5,B000065CJL,"After living in Northern Vermont for 40 years, and attending his performances (even now that we live in S. NH), this was a great locally produced movie.",1358985600,,152,4.666666666666667
7960981,5,B000065CJL,"In the woodsy opening scene, we see a scruffy, rustic type guy lining up a shot with his rifle; and for all we know we may be about to witness a murder. As it turns out, he's only killing a deer, but that's our introduction to the protagonist (you can't really call this flawed individual a ""hero"").

Given the title, I was surprised there never was any scene where a car got stuck in the spring mud on a dirt road. Non-New Englanders probably wondered about the title.

The setting seems to be 1980s rural Vermont -- based on the scenery, vehicle styles, and Ben & Jerry's ice cream being among his purchases at a small local store. Realizing it's ""mud season"" (spring, to you flat-landers), seeing our friend take his deer in the back of his pick-up to meet a buyer on a back road someplace, all tell us he's a poacher -- even before the game warden pays him a later visit. In his poverty, this is part of how he survives.

In a subplot, a Chinese girl who was smuggled to the States in the overcrowded hold of a cargo ship, then made a sex slave to pay off her ""debt"" for the passage, exposes a very real situation most Americans know little about (and maybe care less). The guy and the girl eventually get involved, and I'll leave the rest for you to see.

It's really a nice, if unlikely, story about believable people in a beautiful setting. Get it and watch it. You'll be glad you did.",1295308800,,1392,4.301526717557252
7960982,4,B000065CJL,wish it was on dvd. I saw this in the theater when it came out...the cinematography was very nice. a good green mt tale.,1242086400,,120,4.041666666666667
7960983,1,B000065CJL,"I was born in vermont. I like Rusty Dewees I think he`s pretty funny that`s why I bought the movie figuring it would have some comedy in it,I was dead wrong! My husband and I watched the first 20 minutes of the movie and couldn`t take no more,I could feel my head going numb from the bordom I had to shut it off. Don`t waiste your money or time on this one.",1224547200,,357,3.9722222222222223
7960984,3,B000065CJL,"I worked on this film in my early days in the film industry, and it took me nine years to get a copy.  The story is touching, but the direction feels a little stilted, and the movie could have used with 25 minutes shaved off the running time.  Overall, it's a decent small budget indie film set in glorious Vermont.",1217635200,,315,4.233333333333333
7960985,3,B000065CJL,"The star of this film is Rusty Dewes, and the character he plays here is fairly typical if you know him. He's a good'ol boy looking for love and tries to find it at the local whorehouse. Things go bad, the madam is killed, the girl hides in the back of his truck, and he finds her later on his property. The majority of the film is the two of them getting to know each other, and finding they have similar troubled pasts, though they are very different. The redneck and the chinagirl grow to love each other. Overall the movie is quite slow, but if you like Dewes, or low-budget films with something to say, you might like this.",1143936000,,628,4.241666666666666
