With these workouts and her guided program, I have lost twenty pounds, feel great, and have much better mobility, strength and balance.  This has become my go to program for over a year now and for many more to come.  Dasha is so positive, provides great guidance on form and you just get the sense she really cares and loves what she does.  Kudos to her programs!!",1422921600,2,492,4.411111111111111
6056858,5,B00G4K13DI,"LOVE these videos/workouts! The workouts are fun, different, intermediate, get my heart pumping, get my body sweating and everyone is easy on the eyes. Dasha voice is nice too.",1414627200,3,176,5.103448275862069
6056859,5,B00G4K13DI,"As a devoted Scorcher girl, I was super excited when the Body Series was released. Id been itching for more KBB, and this delivered.
This is a bit different in presentation and format from the Scorcher series, but thats not a bad thing. I enjoyed that the Body series had body-part focused workouts (butt, abs, arms) as well as some full body type stuff (40/20, Lean 2.0). The Body series also included a buddy workout (this one is way fun) and a travel workout. The travel workout is especially nice when I don't have a lot of time, or if perhaps I just want a short workout to wake me up and stretch me out.
The Body series also comes with a bit of a nutrition guide. Its not complicated. Theres no freaky special menus. Its just sensible eatingyou cant go wrong.",1413936000,3,765,4.394366197183099

6056861,5,B00G4K13DI,"The classes are always full because Dasha is so popular.  These DVD's are a great program.  I have back pain and needed something else to use other than dance, martial arts and yoga.  This is perfect for me.  I do follow the program.  My back pain has decreased.  Most of all that last ten pounds is going fast.  I feel stronger and ready for my day. As she says ""No Excuses"" Can't wait for more from Dasha.",1403568000,9,407,4.207792207792208

6056864,5,B00G4K13DI,"This is the first Kettlebell Kickboxing set by Dasha Liben that I have purchased; I don't own the earlier Scorcher series, but ended up purchasing this Body Series after it had been getting rave reviews on the Video Fitness forum. I have only done a few of the workouts, but I really like it so far, and have found the workouts to be a lot of fun!

As a bit of background about myself, I've been using kettlebell workouts for about five years. I took in-person classes with Lauren Brooks and own two of her DVDs, along with owning DVDs by Anthony Di Luglio, Beth Chamberlin, Keith Weber, Andrea Du Cane, Phil Ross, and Amy Bento Ross. This Body Series with Dasha Libin is unlike any of those other workouts, and I love how unique, fun, and hard it is!

The eleven DVDs come in a thick jewel case with a rounded edge that is just over 1  inches thick. Since some of the workouts are short, it would have been much nicer if they had out more than one workout on each disk to the case would take up less room. The space issue is a minor quibble, but I also hate cases like this where you have to pop out a disk to get at the disk below it. I ended up moving this set into a DVD folder so that I don't have to do this, and so I don't have to worry about breaking a DVD while trying to get it off of the tight spindles.

The program also comes with a booklet that provides nutrition information and various training schedules. The nutrition information provides an overview of clean eating, and gives recommendations for how to eat clean and why it's important to avoid things like starchy carbs.

There are four training schedules given: one for the deconditioned person, one for the moderately active person, one for the athletically active person, and one for the athlete. (Dasha gives an explanation of each one, so you know where you're at.) Based on your level, there are then 60-day programs listed for each point, and, regardless of what level you're at, she suggests you start with the Beginner workout just to review form and her techniques.

In each of the workouts, there is one person who is using a dumbbell, so you don't need a kettlebell to do the workouts, but I'd suggest getting at least one since it will make a difference in how you move.

Each workout has four menu options:

* Play Full Workout
* Play Workout on Mute (so you can play your own music)
* Play Workout with Music Only
* Play Workout without Warm-Up or Cool Down (this isn't an option for the Beginner and Joint Mobility workouts since they include the warm-up as part of the workout)

Instead of a countdown timer for the entire workout (which I would have preferred), there is a counter for each workout that gives the percentage of the DVD that is completed and a countdown timer only for the move you're doing.

Although I haven't done all of the workouts yet, I have previewed each one. Since I wasn't able to find the workout times anywhere online, I've also kept note of them and have included them below. The 11 workouts are as follows:

* KB 101- BEGINNER & REVIEW - 57:38 minutes. The first few minutes are Dasha's overview of the Body Series. This workout is just Dasha and Janelle (sp?), and Dasha gives really excellent form pointers! Dasha even does some of the moves incorrectly (with poor form) so you can see what good and bad form looks like side by side.

* KB CARDIO LEAN 2.0 - 34:45 minutes. The focus is on keeping your heartrate up.

* KB CARDIO 40/20 BURN - 33:51 minutes. It has tabata-style intervals of 40 seconds of work, and 20 seconds of rest.

* DOUBLE KB CARDIO - 33:25 minutes. This workout uses two kettlebells of the same size. It is just Dasha and Janelle in this workout, and is meant to be a more advanced workout.

* ABSOLUTE ABS AND CORE: SHAPE & DEFINE - 41:48 minutes. Even though the focus is on abs, Dasha includes a lot of cardio moves. In addition to a kettlebell, you also need a mat for some of the moves.

* AMAZING ARMS: SCULPT & STRENGTHEN - 38:26 minutes. It has a lot of punching drills in it than some of the workouts since the focus is on the upper body.

* LIMITLESS LEGS: LEAN & LENGTHEN -- 47:00 minutes. It has a nice mix of moves like dead lifts, interspersed with cardio moves to get your heartrate up. I have a tendency towards tendonitis in my knees, and this is very knee-friendly.

* PERFECT BUTT: LIFT & SHAPE - 42:32 minutes. This has a nice focus on kicks and cardio drills. All of the KB swings are also good for shaping the glutes.

* JOINT MOBILITY: RECOVERY & FLEXIBILITY -- 43:24 minutes. For all of the training schedules, Dasha has you doing this at least once or twice a week. Besides just using a kettlebell, you'll also need a mat and a foam roller to do this one. She also has you use a wall to stretch out.

* TRAIN ANYWHERE: NO KETTLEBELL WORKOUT - 28:24 minutes. This workout is a no-kettlebell workout that is designed to use kettlebell principles, but on the go so you can use it while traveling. You also don't need a lot of space, and Dasha mentions that it's a shorter workout since most people who are traveling don't want to spend too much time working out.

* BUDDY WORKOUT - 24:46 minutes. This is a ""bonus"" workout, and has six total exercisers in it. You just need one kettlebell for it, and you alternate drills with a workout buddy, and encourage that person to do the various exercises. I haven't yet tried this one, but I plan on doing it with my husband since it looks like a lot of fun!

Except for the Beginner, Double KB, and Buddy workouts, all of the workouts have Dasha and three background exercisers in them. All four are in amazing shape, which I always find motivating. One is barefoot, and the other three are wearing tennis shoes.

Also, each workout starts with a very short FBI warning and clip for the series, but you can skip over them, which I love. (I hate having to wait several minutes to get a DVD to load!)

As I mentioned, I don't have the first Scorcher Series, but I've read that people wished that Dasha didn't chat quite as much. In this one, people have said that she chats less. I find her comments in this series to be really helpful, and I love how she constantly remind you of form pointers.

I plan on doing these for the next month following the Advanced rotation, and will update my review as I work my way through them. For now, though, I can tell that this series will be fun to do and will provide lots of variety!",1390953600,59,6431,4.343619683069225
8620618,4,B00G4K13DI,"I bought this product and it did not come with the nutrition guide, and it took nearly a week and a half for the company to send me a pdf version of the nutrition guide so that I could print it off and start the schedule.",1529539200,,221,3.8260869565217392
8620619,5,B00G4K13DI,"Dasha is a fantastic instructor! Her workouts are fun, never boring, and keep you injury free because of her proper instruction. You will definitely see results within a few short weeks, just stick with it and the eating plan.  I have all of her DVD plans and love them all. Sometimes instructors get on your nerves and need to be muted, not Dasha. She's very positive and helpful. You'll never want to try anything else after KKB. It's been my go to workout for 3 yrs, you'll love it too!",1479772800,2,489,4.433333333333334

8620621,5,B00G4K13DI,"LOVE this!!  If you are looking for something to do at home or with a small group, this is it!  I have done this a couple times and have not gotten bored at ALL.  I'll do it again soon, but now I'm doing her 7 Day Lean program, which is also really good.",1475625600,2,254,3.7547169811320753
8620622,3,B00G4K13DI,"I like kettlebell workouts quite a bit.  They work my legs like nothing else -- actually they work the whole body pretty well, with both strength training and cardio benefits.  So when I saw a deal on this set, I didn't hesitate to buy it.  (I got this directly from Kettlebell Kickboxing with a Gilt City voucher.)

It is okay for me, and I will use it (with modifications, described below) but it is not really what I expected.

One more beginning note, the case the DVDs come in is extremely poorly designed.  I cannot get the DVDs back into place so they are all just kind of sitting loose in there.  And, the DVDs themselves are not the best quality.  At least one of mine has already ceased playing properly when inserted into my DVD player.  (Well, I can use like the first 15 minutes of the workout, but then it stops.)

There are some things I like about these workouts.  I am learning some new kettlebell exercises, and this variety in my workouts is much appreciated.  I have trouble following some of them (anything involving ""figure 8,"" for some reason), but I was always the little kid in dance class turning the wrong way, so that's not so surprising.  I will pick it up eventually, if I keep trying!

Another thing I like is, if the DVD is for arms or legs or rear end or whatever, the exercises are definitely selected to maximize working the muscle group mentioned in the title.

You have the option of playing the DVDs without the warm-up or cool down and this is what I generally do.  I am pretty fit by now after working out for 90+ minutes a day all year long.  And often I do something else (say, a Focus T25 DVD) before I even pick up a kettlebell.  So I am usually pretty warm by the time I start these.  I appreciate having the option of skipping the warm-up, anyway.  (Sometimes I do 2 or 3 of the workouts in one session.)

You will get a timer for each move and a countdown bar with the percentage of the workout completed on the screen (most of the time).  The countdown bar isn't entirely accurate -- sometimes the percentage completed decreases by 1 or 2 between moves -- but this is mostly not a problem (certainly not a major problem).

I do like the instructor (though she talks A LOT) and the demonstrators.  The demonstrators all teach at the Kettlebell Kickboxing studio and they are fit and know what they're doing.  Cueing isn't really an issue here because this isn't a super choreographed workout; basically you are told a move you are going to do and then you do it as many times as you can (safely) before the timer runs out.  If there is music, it doesn't really even register with me.

And here is what I don't like (other than the production quality issues).  First, there is too much resting time for my preferences.  That is not unique to this particular DVD series; I have other kettlebell workouts that are the same way.  But I really don't like standing around during my workouts -- it feels like wasted time to me.  I have taken to doing cardio moves I learned in Focus T25 (or sometimes jumping rope) during the rest breaks to keep my heart rate up and to get steps in (I have a Fitbit and I try to get 12,000+ steps per day).

Second, the ""kickboxing"" part isn't kickboxing as you might expect based on other workout DVDs (say, Tae Bo or Les Mills (Body)Combat).  There are few kicks and few, if any, punches.  There are a lot of sprawls (similar to burpees) and rolling around on the ground.  I don't mind burpees but I really don't like rolling on the ground.  I don't feel that I am getting much cardio benefit out of it, and it is somewhat inconvenient in terms of the amount of space I have to work out in (am worried about hitting some part of my body on my chin up bar or Smith machine or something).  So I usually do Focus T25 moves during these parts, too, for a greater challenge.  It turns the workout into a high intensity interval type of workout that just works better for my fitness goals.

I'm not saying the sprawls and such aren't authentic martial arts moves, they are just not what I am used to from other martial arts-based workout DVDs or what I was expecting based on the name of the DVD series. (I am not subtracting from my rating for me not having enough space to do some of the moves because that is obviously not the DVDs' fault!)

Like I said, I appreciate learning new kettlebell movements.  I find them challenging and there is always room to make them more difficult by increasing the kettlebell weight.  I basically just wish there was less down time and more actual kickboxing.",1473984000,,4566,4.386904761904762
8620623,3,B00G4K13DI,"Workouts are good and variety is good.  However, the instructor talks non-stop through the entire video!  It's very annoying.  Nobody needs that much instruction!",1462752000,3,162,5.666666666666667
8620624,5,B00G4K13DI,I absolutely love this program.  My daughter and I started on this journey and we appreciate the cleat instructions on how toften perform the best form.  We just started and we can't perform all of the movementseason but I am already seeing some results after the second work out.  That is why we keep going on.  Dasha you are awesome.,1457222400,,335,4.533333333333333
8620625,3,B00G4K13DI,"I really, REALLY wanted to love this workout. Dasha is a really cool person, and I thought she would make me enjoy my workouts while introducing me to kettlebells. What I got was a bunch of different workouts which all seemed a little disjointed (the breaks between moves made me feel as though I wasn't getting a continuous workout). Plus, the videos endorse lots of ""sprawls"" (some sort of burpee cousin) and rolling around on the floor, both of which led to bruises on my knees, elbows, hips, and back of my shoulders.

Oh yeah, and I decided that I'm not the biggest fan of kettlebells.",1439856000,3,590,4.566037735849057
8620626,5,B00G4K13DI,"Great work out program and it really works for me, fun and engaging. I have come to find that the kettlebell is a profound fitness tool and mix it with martial arts-I LOVE IT! I recommend this dvd series for increasing flexibility, functional strength, range of motion and empowering you as it has a holistic approach.  I tell my friends about the kettle bell workouts and I started with a 10 pound bell and working my way up to 15-20 pound bells and I'm just excited about the lean muscle and how my body is toning up. I used to have difficulty getting off the floor and now I can use my upper body/trunk to get up and can sit up to stand from laying down without using my arms. I used to be so tired and weak and now it's a different story. I am changing to a women that has more energy, enjoying life more and increased functional strength. I wish I knew about this before- I would have started using the kettlebell sooner!",1434672000,7,926,4.261363636363637
