It covers most of the steps and processes to use the interface, create and import clips, stills, audio and more.  The instructor walks through, step-by-step, creating a short video with various media, fades, text overlays, and both imported and custom sound.  You get a good idea how to use the product focused on a simple short, and without going into all the levels of detail you'll need to fully master every control.  But, Joe does leave you wanting a little more, or maybe a whole lot more depth.  That said, it does the job it was designed to do.  It's a very good introduction to the Sony Vegas product, and his demonstrations and working process will get you started using it.  If Joe had a second video in the series, I wouldn't hesitate buying it and letting him instruct me on the finer details of using Sony Vegas for advanced production.",1435536000,,926,4.609756097560975

The only issue I have found is that there is a bit of a learning curve.
I recommend you get some additional tutorials.
As with all products you need to practice to get better at using all of the features and that is the case here.
I highly recommend Sony Vega!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-Vegas-Movie-Studio-HD-Platinum-11-Production-Suite-Old-Version/dp/B0051M6IPI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 11 Production Suite [Old Version</a>]",1361145600,,574,6.666666666666667
