Hell In A Cell II

Undertaker (w/ Paul Bearer)vs. Mick Foley (Mankind)

As i said, this match makes this PPV stand out beyond all the other matches on this card, from the start this match turned violent, as Mankind climbed up to the top of the cage and Undertaker came up close behind, Foley and Taker battled, after a few minutes Taker took Foley by his hair and trunks and literally threw Mick Foley off of the top of the steel cage, through the announcers table below, as Jim Ross yelled ""OH MY GOD IT KILLED HIM!, AS GOD AS MY WITNESS HE IS BROKEN IN HALF!!"" Mankind lay motionless on the table as Taker stood atop the Cell staring at Foley, EMT's came out and took Foley away on a stretcher, soon after, showing either courage, heart or stupidity (heart and courage in my opinion...) Foley got off of the stretcher and climbed back to the top, Taker still there, Foley fought Taker, and Taker took Foley by the throat and Chokeslammed him through the cage, litteraly. Foley lay motionless again, with a bloody lip after the chair fell ontop of him after he crashed through the cage, EMT's, Police, Terry Funk and others came to Foley's aid, Taker however would have none of it, as he climbed down and started to fight off EMT's and WWE/WWF officals after about 10 minutes of fighting, back n' forth, Foley got out a sack of thumbtacks and poured them onto the mat, Taker then grabbed foley again by the throat and chokeslamed him onto the thumbtacks, Taker then pinned him 1-2-3 to end this brutal, violent, bloody and carrer shortining match.

Winner: Undertaker by pinfall

the PPV was not that good (with the exception of the Steve Austin vs. Kane First Blood match) but the Hell In A Cell Match sure as hell backed up this mediocre PPV",1123286400,,1841,4.483582089552239

Details on the mcmahon interview:

Sable came out and did the intro for the McMahon Interview. Vince is accompanied to the ring by Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson. An Austin chant begins. Vince stares at Sable with a smile, that would be an awful couple even if it were for ratings. Pat Patterson tried touching Sable's ass and Sable slapped him in the face. Patterson got red and ordered Sable out of the ring. Patterson said the fans should have respect for all 3 men in the ring. Brisco cleaned the mic for McMahon who finally began the interview. He thanked the fans for joining him in watching King of the Ring. He wondered how many peeps wanted to see Kane defeate Stone Cold for the title. Not a good response from the crowd. He asked how many peeps joined him to see Kane set on fireand the crowd popped. McMahon said they were setting themselves up for a big dissapointment. He said most of the fans have had their lives full of dissapointments. He called the fans dissapointments to their parents and the crowd was mad. What marks. McMahon keeps on talking about how the crowd is such a dissapointment. He says that the people's parents probably dissapointed their children. My friend, Badtz, who's at my house is so pissed because this is such crap and has nothing to do with wrestling. I agree. Vince said he wanted to prepare the fans for what they'd feel when SCSA loses tonight against Kane. He warned the fans of the inevitable when he stated that Kane would win.

939723,4,6304826206,"I bought this tape in 2003 and I had no clue what the other matches (or superstars) were except for the last 3. So, onto the review of those 3 matches:

1. Ken Shamrock def. The Rock to become the 1998 King of the Ring. Very good solid match. Nothing more I can say cause its been over a year since I saw the match. Rating: 8/10

2. Undertaker def. Mankind in a Hell in a Cell match. This was the sickest Hell in a Cell match I've ever seen (or heard of). This match, The HIAC match at No Way Out 2000, and Armageddon 2000 are the sickest matches, but this one doesn't compare. First off, the first minute of this match Undertaker throws Mankind off the top of the Cell, crashing through the announce table!! Then about 10 minutes later, Taker chokeslams Mankind through the top of the cell, for another crash of 16+ feet (yep, Mankind climbed back to the top of the cell for that bump. So, another few minutes later, Undertaker throws the steel steps at Mankind 3 times very hard. After this, Mankind gets a piledriver, and his double arm DDT. But when he goes to get a bag of tumbtacks from under the ring, Undertaker chokeslams him on the tacks!! The to finish off the match, Taker tombstones Mankind in the ring for the 3 count. This match was VERY brutal. Rating: 11/10 (that was intentional, meaning this was one of my favorite matches to watch)

3. Kane def. Stone Cold to win the WWF Championship in a 'First Blood' match. Stipulations: if Kane loses he sets himself on fire; if Kane wins, he wins the title. Another very brutal contest, but not as bad as the HIAC match. The Cell acually lowers for some reason and about 3/4 of the match is fought inside the cage. Taker and Mankind come down to the ring, and Taker acually helps Kane win the match, when he gives Stone Cold a big huge chair shot to the head. Rating: 10/10

939807,4,6304826206,"I have been a WWE fan for the last ten years, and when I think back of all the shows that I have seen, the 1998 King of the Ring always comes to mind. The main reason for this is obviously the Hell in a Cell match between Mankind and The Undertaker. It is perhaps the most violent, the most suspenseful, and the most talked about match in WWE history. This match is worth the price of the tape by itself. Now some of you may be wondering why I only gave this PPV 4 stars. If you think about it, there is only 3 good matches on the card. Mankind vs The Undertaker ""Hell in a Cell"", Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Kane in a ""First Blood Match"", and The Rock vs Ken Shamrock in the King of the Ring finals. The rest of the matches on the card are only decent at best, and you spend most of the time wanting to fast-forward to the good matches on the card.
King of the Ring 1998 is definately a PPV worth owning. But, it is slightly overrated in my opinion because there were only 3 good matches on the card.",1078012800,,1000,3.9800995024875623

Mankind and the Undertaker stole the show with HIAC. The event could have done w/o TOO MUCH VS. AL Snow & HEAD. The N.A.O. should have been facing the L.O.D. 2000 and not the New Midnite Express. The NME [isn't good]. Taka and the Head Bangers had an ok match with Kiantai. Over all it was a cool PPV.,1050969600,,450,4.113636363636363
939894,4,6304826206,"King of the ring 1999 is nowhere near being the best ppv of all time nor it is the best ppv of 1999, but it was a good show.  King of the ring's are usually not that good, but this one was an exception.  The king of the ring tournament was not that bad.  The only complaint I had about it was the time limit of the matches.  There was a quarterfinal, semi-final, and finals and the average time of the matches was about 5-6 minutes.  Two barely lasted over 3 minutes, which is not really enough time to get into a match.  Undertaker vs Rock did start off bad, but gradually picked up.  This title match was way better than some of the ones I've seen in other 1999 ppv's.  Rock definately had the odds stacked against him, as Undertaker, Paul Bearer and Triple H coming in and giving him a pedigree allowed Taker to pick up the victory.  The tag team match between Hardys and Edge/Christian was good.  It was the Hardys first ppv and E & C were just starting to take off in their career.  Lots of high-flying, fast-paced action which ended in Gangrel accidentally spit some mist in edge's face which allowed Matt Hardy to deliver the twist of fate.  Next, was the handicap ladder match where the winner gets total control of the company (Austin vs Vince and Shane McMahon)  I think the only reason people hated this match, was the screw-job Austin received in this match.  The bad part about the screw-job is the fact that we never found out who was responsible for that happening.  If you've seen the ppv you know what I'm talking about. As usual, Austin dominated the match by throwing the McMahon threw the ladders and knocking down the display of the ladders on top of the McMahons.  Again, not the best ladder match, but for two non-trained wrestlers, not bad!  I wouldn't necessarily call this ppv a must-have, but compared to the previous king of the rings, this one is one of the best.",1046390400,,1892,4.406340057636887

The Headbangers and Taka Michinoku vs. Kaientai - Taka was a member of Kaientai in Japan but that doesn't get mentioned much.  This is pretty good as the Headbangers are fairly talented and Taka and Kaientai are exceptionally talented. ***1/2
Al Snow and Head vs. Too Much - Jerry Lawler (Brian Christopher's dad) is the referee.  Too Much is Too Cool before they got over.  Al Snow was trying to work his way back into the WWF after a run in ECW.  The idea is he's crazy and talks to a mannequin head so the head is his partner.  Total comedy match as Lawler reprimands the head at one point.  I thought for sure that the head would go over. *
Ken Shamrock vs. Double J - (KOTR Semi) - These two don't really mesh that well together, as Shamrock is state of the art shoot-style and Jarrett is old school Memphis heel. **
The Rock vs. Dan Severn - (KOTR Semi) - Same as the other KOTR match only more so.  Severn never really adapted to the pro-style and the Rock was not at a point where he could carry him. *
X-Pac vs. Owen Hart - Owen was putting over every single member of D-X and slipping further and further down the ladder as he did.  This is X-Pac's return from injury.  Good match, but not up to the standards of these two.  Overbooking kills the ending. ***
Tag Team Title Match - New Age Outlaws vs. The New Midnight Express - For those who don't know, the Midnight Express was a revolutionary tag team in the mid-eighties who feuded with the Rock `n' Roll Express.  This was the Hardyz vs. Edge/Christian fifteen years earlier.  It was revolutionary because they changed the formula of tag team wrestling from two single wrestlers that just happen to be a team to two men who use each other, their opponents, and the referee to their advantage.  This new version of the Midnights is Bob (Hardcore) Holly and Bart Gunn (Billy's storyline brother).  They have more physical talent, but can't hold a candle to the old Midnights.  This by the way is the first time the WWF Champions and the NWA Champions have faced off.  ***1/2
The Rock vs. Ken Shamrock - KOTR Finals - These two had an eternal feud from early to mid-1998.  Rock was transitioning feuds from Shamrock to HHH who is on commentary.  Rock was also the IC Champ at this point.  This was a classy move on Rock's part.  I won't say why, but everyone came off better. **3/4
Main Event #1 - Hell in a Cell - Undertaker vs. Mankind - I think we've all heard of this one.  The atmosphere starts off very nicely with Mankind scaling the cage.  Undertaker follows and throws Mankind off the cell!!!  This was shown over and over and over on WWF TV for the next three years and was a big part of Mankind's career continuing.  Mankind then takes a sicker accidental bump THROUGH the cage!!!
Then the match starts!  Teeth fly, tacks are used, chairs are used, and blood is everywhere.  The match isn't that great on its own merits, but for sheer entertainment and historical value it's a must have.  ** for the match ***** for entertainment.
Main Event #2 - First Blood WWF Title Match - If Kane loses he sets himself on fire.  That should give you an idea of the ending.  Someone lowers the cell down and we have a First Blood cage match.  Mankind interferes and Undertaker interferes conveniently setting up a tag match at the next PPV. **3/4
In the End: Really only remembered for the HITC match, but there's lots here to find.  HHH vs. Rock started here.  The summer of 1998 angles heated up and the tag title match was very solid.  Recommended.",1017792000,5,3674,4.376661742983752

The next best match is what I think is the best match of all time! The Undertaker goes one on one with Mankind (Mick Foley) and this was a very physical match which is a Hell in a Cell match. Mankind got thrown of the Cell buy The Undertaker and than they both climed the cell again and then Mankind got a Chokeslam straight through the cell.

940152,5,6304826206,"Almost everyone would agree that KOTR 1998 featured by far the best match of 1998: The Hell in the Cell between Taker and Mick Foley. Not a technical match, but the risks that these men took will probably never be matched  ever again (especially Foley).  Other solid matches included the King  of the Ring Finals (you gotta see it for yourself to find out who was in  it). Unlike the Hell in the Cell, this match featured superb technical  ability, something that a true wrestling fan would appreciate. Triple H  says some very funny comments during this match. The main event: First  Blood Rules with Stone Cold Steve Austin and Kane had a lot to show for  because it followed the Hell in the Cell and there was a lot riding on this  match. Nevertheless, a hell of match with classic Stone Cold Steve Austin  action in spite of the fact that he wasn't 100 percent going in. The  opening six man tag match with the Headbangers and Taka against Kaientai  was a little on a short side, but still an entertaining match to watch. The  chemistry between the Headbangers and Taka was good to say the least.  The King of the Ring semifinals were short-lived and probably below  expectations, but good action while it lasted. It includes Double J,  Shamrock, Severn and the Rock. The match with Al Snow w/ Head against Too  Much (with Jerry Lawler as ref) was simply hilarious, especially the  ending.  Other matches include the Tag Team Championship, and a bonus  match with X-Punk against the late Owen Hart which were also very well  done. You also get to see Sable's return and Patty Paterson giving her a  little ""pat"" on her ass and a slap for his actions!

On the final episode before the PPV, McMahon announced that the match would be a First Blood Match with the only way to win being to bust your opponent open. Kane made a deal, etched in stone, that if he lost the match, he would set himself on fire

1.) Taka Michinoku and The Headbangers vs Kaientai

A quick and fun filler opening to kick the show off. Taka and The Headbangers were pretty exciting to watch. Too bad that we never saw much teaming from them, following this match. Michinoku gets the win with the Michinoku Driver on Funaki

Sable who had recently been re-hired by Vince McMahon comes to the ring and introduces McMahon and his stooges, Pat Patterson and Gerald Briscoe. Patterson and Briscoe ask Sable to leave the ring, but not without patting Sable on her tight buns, earning him a slap in the face. Vince goes on to heel it up, insulting the Pittsburgh crowd, referring to them as disappointments before announcing Kane as the winner of tonight's match

2.) King of the Ring Semi-Finals Match: Jeff Jarrett w/Tennessee Lee vs Ken Shamrock

An overall decent back and forth bout that sees Shamrock advance getting the submission victory over Jarrett with the ankle lock

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) King of the Ring Semi-Finals Match: The Rock vs Dan Severn

Basic dull match that can be blamed on Severn. Dan Severn didn't belong in WWF. He lacked charisma and personality, ultimately making him a very boring person to watch in the ring. The end comes when Mark Henry and The Godfather come to the ring and distract the referee, while D'Lo Brown snuck in the ring and hit a Lo Down on Severn while wearing his chest protector that he'd wear for most of his matches going forth. Rock capitalizes on the attack and gets the pinfall victory to advance to the finals

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Too Much vs Al Snow

Before they were Too Cool, Scotty 2 Hotty and Grandmaster Sexay were known as Too Much. The story behind this one was that Al Snow had come back to the WWF, sneaking into multiple events, demanding to talk to Vince McMahon only to be escorted out by security. After weeks of sneaking in arenas, Snow was booked in a Handicap Match against Too Much with his trusty mannequin head, named Head by his side. Jerry Lawler was added as the special referee at the last minute to really pull a swerve on Al. Not a great match but definitely a comical one with Lawler cheating as the referee and all sorts of shenanigans going on in the match. Christopher Taylor puts a bottle of head and shoulders lotion on Head and pins the mannequin to get the win. Get it? Head and shoulders? Because head needed shoulders to be pinned...?? Ah forget it.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) X-Pac vs Owen Hart

Solid bout between X-Pac and Owen. It has its slow moments but overall it comes through and they manage to keep the action alive. Things get chaotic towards the end when Mark Henry comes to ringside and attacks X-Pac on the outside, leading to Chyna interfering and mouthing off to Henry before he gets attacked by Vader. While the referee deals with the outside chaos, Chyna sneaks in the ring and hits a DDT on Owen. X-Pac takes advantage and pins Owen for the win.

7.) 1998 King of the Ring Final: The Rock vs Ken Shamrock

Before the match, Triple H came to ringside with Chyna to do commentary on the match. Triple H provides some very entertaining commentary to go along with the match. Rock and HHH get in each other's face a couple of times to build up their feud. A very great back and forth bout that looked to have been either man's bout at times. In the end, The Rock gets caught in Shamrock's Ankle Lock and The Rock taps out, making Shamrock the 1998 King of the Ring winner. This match had its slow parts but it was great nonetheless and was a much better match then the one they had at Wrestlemania 14

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) Hell In A Cell Match: Mankind vs The Undertaker

This match is one that still gets talked about to this day by fans across all eras of WWF/WWE.. Shortly after Undertaker meets Mankind up on the cell, in no time, we see Undertaker chuck Mankind off the top of the cell as Mankind takes that unforgettable 20 foot death drop. And of course following this fall, Jim Ross says his classic ""Good God almighty! It killed him!"" A hoard of doctors and medics and officials come out to check on Mick...even Vince. After about 5 minutes, Mankind hops off the stretcher and climbs back up to the top of the cell only to get Chokeslammed through the roof. Terry Funk gets a Chokeslam for coming out to check on Foley and from there, the action stays in the ring. As this exhilirating match, reaches its climax, Mankind brings thumbtacks into the ring only to get backdropped and Chokeslammed on them by Taker. One Tombstone later and this classic is over! Words can't describe how great and exciting this match is to watch until you see it. This match is considered by many Attitude Era fans to be the greatest match of that era and after a breath-taking bout such as this one, it's hard to disagree. The match starts off on top of the cell as Mankind dares Undertaker to come up

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

9.) WWF Championship First Blood Match: Kane w/Paul Bearer vs Stone Cold Steve Austin (c)

In perhaps Stone Cold's toughest opponent since winning the WWF Championship, the stakes were high in this one....mostly for Kane. The stipulation being that the only way to win is to bust your opponent open. Kane added an additional stipulation to the match for himself, stating that if he didn't win the WWF Championship, he would set himself on fire. To play up the match, they had quite a few tanks of gasoline positioned around the ringside area. About 5 minutes into the match, the Hell in a Cell suspiciously begins to lower. After Austin plows Kane through the cell door, the cell begins to rise, with Kane hanging on the edge of the bottom of the doorway. As the cell rises, Kane is teetering on the cell with Austin by the throat. Kind of funny there. The match goes back and forth and is a treat to watch for around 15+ minutes. Reaching the climax, the referee gets knocked out, Mankind interferes and the cell lowers for the 3rd time in one night. Undertaker returns to the ring as well with a steel chair in hand and intends to clock Mankind with it but accidentally hits Austin instead, busting him open. Earl Hebner comes to and sees the blood and rings the bell, awarding the WWF Championship to Kane. This wasn't necessarily a great but it was a decent one to sit through and close the show.

Overall: As the title of the review says, this is without a doubt the best King of the Ring PPV of all time. Great line-up of matches with 2 must see main event matches at the last hour! A breath-taking Hell in a Cell match to be remembered for years and years to come and a decent main event! I was disappointed that Kane's WWF Championship reign only lasted until the following night on Raw though. It should've lasted at least a few weeks or until their next PPV just to give him some time with the title in his hands. Above all else, King of the Ring 1998 is the best ever!",1402790400,,8832,5.095567867036011

1. Six Man Tag
Kaientai vs. Tanka Minchioku & Headbangers
Nice opnener. Tanka and the Headbangers pulled off some good triple teamed moves. It did its job to get the crowd all rowded up for the night. 3/5

2. Semi-Finals
Jeff Jarrett w/ Tennessee Lee vs. Ken Shamrock
These two didn't really mesh all that well with each other. A few moves were executed. Of course there was some interference from TN Lee. Not a whole much happening here. 2.5/5

3. Semi-Finals
The Rock vs. Dan ""the Beast"" Severn
This match was defiantly better than the Shamrock/Jarrett match but not a whole lot too better. This is also where the whole chest protector on d lo came from which he frogsplashed Severn with it on and costed him the match. 3/5

4. Al Snow & ""head"" vs. Too Much
This match was nothing but entertainment especially with the King being the special referee. Nothing really good from here except for a couple of good laughs. It did had a ending which was quite clever though. 1.5/5

5. Owen Hart vs. X-Pac w/ Chyna
X-pac really took some hard blows here. The in ring action was good and so was the outside action. The closing mintues of this match was really the most exciting parts. Very good match up between these too. It had a few good shockers as well. 4/5

6. Tag Team Championship
New Age Outlaws w/ Chyna vs. The New Midnight Express w/ Jim Cornette
Average tag match right here. It was interesting to see Bart and Billy squaring off against each other. Nothing all that but it was fairly decent. 3/5

7. Finals of the King of the Ring Tournament
The Rock vs. Ken Shamrock
Pretty good match and I'd have to say this is one of the better matches these two has had that year. Rock would try to work on Shamrock's hurt ankle and even applying some wrestling holds on him. The Rock would also have a tossle with Triple H who was at ringside help calling the match. Good final match in the tournament. 3.5/5

8. Hell in the Cell Match
Undertaker vs. Mankind
Defiantly one of the greatest moments in the annals of professional wrestling happened here. It would start up on the cell where Taker would throw Foley off the top and through the announce table, and to be perfectly honest I thought the match was legitamy over right there. The match would really get under way once Foley got chokeslammed through the top of the cell and into the ring. I was surprised when Foley countered some of Taker's moves. Foley even applied the mandiable claw on Taker. Thumb tacks would also get introduced at one point in the match. Pretty good ending. Just for the history value of this match defiantly makes it a 5 star match. Just pure unbelieveable. 5/5

9. First Blood for the WWE Title
Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Kane w/ Paul Bearer
This match also delivers just like the hell in the cell did. It started out very good with some reversals and brawling. The cell would eventually get lowered and surround the ring. It had some nice action to take place around the enterance area. Kane takes a hard shot with a metal fan. Taker and Foley would come out and get involved. The closing moments of this match also made it more exciting to watch. Great title match to end an unbelieveable night. 4.5/5

King of the Ring is with out a doubt remembered for the Hell in the Cell but that aint the only thing to see in this one. It had a good title match and a decent KOR tournament. You will defiantly get more than just the Hell in the Cell moment.",1218585600,,3730,4.384949348769899
7879406,4,6304826206,"Another old tape that I found in my collection with the 1998 King of the Ring. This was the first time in the event's history that would begin as a pattern for the future King of the Ring events in which the tournament itself would be nothing more than a filler considering everything else that was going on in the WWF at the time.

Headbangers & Taka Michinoku vs Kaientai. This was a fun opening contest as the Headbangers add some comedy while Taka works well with the rest of the members of Kaientai. And for those keeping track, this would be one of the last times that Taka would face this group as he would join them in the summer.

Ken Shamrock vs Jeff Jarrett. The first match of the semi finals of the KOTR tournament. These two just didn't ""click"" well together but the match was short so for that, it made it more watchable than what it really was.

The Rock vs Dan Severn. This is the second match of the semi finals & just like the first one, these two didn't mesh well together either as Severn never really adapted to the WWF style with only highlight being D'Lo Brown's appearance wearing something that would become a trademark of his following this match.

Al Snow & ""Head"" vs Too Much w/Special Referee Jerry ""The King"" Lawler. The stipulation to this match was that if Al Snow & ""Head"" win the match, then Al Snow would get his meeting with Vince McMahon & be rehired in the WWF but if he loses, then he is out of the WWF. This was really just a glorified handicap match & other than a few moments like Lawler ordering the head or even the finish that even I laughed at, this was really nothing to get excited about.

X-Pac vs Owen Hart. The continuation of the war between DX & The Nation continued here as this was the best match that the crowd had seen since the opener. These two worked well together which made this a good match to with X-Pac taking a few bumps on the outside with the announce tables & cameos from Chyna, Mark Henry & Vader adding to the contest instead of taking away from it.

WWF Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs New Midnight Express. For those that don't remember, this version of the Midnight Express consisted of Bob Holly & Bart Gunn with Jim Cornette as their manager. This was a good average tag team match with moments like the exchanges between Billy & Bart along with the ending where Chyna played a role in which Cornette would like to forget...along with every other man that watched it.

The Rock vs Ken Shamrock. The finals of the KOTR tournament but before the match, Triple H did some commentary for this match & boy was he ever speaking his mind in this one along with a confrontation with The Rock that was a mini-tease for their fued following this event. This was the best match of the tournament & this match made up for their disappointing WrestleMania match earlier in the year as they told a good story of both men not being able to put the other down no matter what they did to them before it was The Rock's frustration that cost him the victory.

Hell In A Cell: The Undertaker vs Mankind. This is the most famous match to come out of this event & the match that put Mick Foley into immortality. This started on top of the Cell with Taker & Mankind brawling before Taker through Mankind off the top of the cage through the announce table that even caused JR to screw ""Good God, That KILLED HIM!!"". From there, the match was stopped for a few minutes before Foley got back up & went back to the top only to be chokeslammed through the Cell along with other moments like the thumbtacks coming into play (including Mick getting chokeslammed onto them), Taker getting busted open & Terry Funk getting chokeslammed right out of his shoes.

First Blood: WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Kane. Kane's own stipulation to this match was that if he didn't win the title, then he would set himself on fire. This was exactly what you expected it to be in which it was a brawl with the Cell actually coming down on numerous occasions including almost dropping on Austin's neck & Kane strandling off the cage door while he was choking Austin. And believe it or not, Mankind & Undertaker would join the match but it was one mistake that Taker did that not only began the storyline of the ""Highway To Hell"" but also set the standard for the second First Blood match a year later between Austin & Taker.

Overall, this event got off to a slow start as the tournament semi finals along with the Al Snow ""match"" not being anything memorable, the rest of the show was able to make up for it with the standouts being the KOTR Final, the main event but more importantly the most memorable and infamous Hell In A Cell match.",1209340800,,4685,4.380897583429229
