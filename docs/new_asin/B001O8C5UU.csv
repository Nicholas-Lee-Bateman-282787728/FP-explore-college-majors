This DVD contains footage not found on any other DVD release, so Wes fan will probably want to own this.  Unfortunately, it looks like the footage was obtained from P2P file sharing and then transcoded onto DVD.  To make things worse this DVD contains the black and white scratchy Kinescope of Wes performing, ""Windy"" the original was shot on color video tape.

The DVD contains 3 performances with a total of 13 songs.

Hamburg Germany April 28, 1965-
Wes performs with 7 other musicians including Ronnie Scott and Johnny Griffin.  Wes does not play on every song.  Sound quality is excellent, image quality is passable with a definite computerized look to it.  Great performance of Wes in a larger band setting. This complete performance is not found on any other DVD release.

London March 25, 1965-
This footage is available elsewhere in higher quality, it was filmed for the show, ""Jazz 625.""  A fantastic performance!

Los Angeles July 1967-
Wes performs one song, ""Windy.""  The original footage was filmed in CLEAR COLOR VIDEO TAPE, this is a scratchy Kinescope.  Very disappointing especially since this performance is not found on any other DVD release.

A good DVD for $10.",1246838400,3,1270,4.929245283018868
8329974,5,B001O8C5UU,"As a Jazz guitarist, I deeply appreciate the remarkable music that Wes Montgomery left on earth.  For me the two studio session and concert featured on this Dvd were very inspiring.  The studio session in Hamburg, I found very entertaining, featuring a handful of European musicians, Johnny Griffin and of course Wes.  The vibe feels very much like a jam session.  However I did find it odd that the DVD is entitled ""Live at Hamburg"" because the studio session really did not showcase Wes Montgomery.  One of the songs he doesnt even play on, and during the others he never takes the spotlight.  The concert in London however, entirely features Wes and his band.  Its great to watch his famous recording of 'Round Midnight'.
Over all a very worthwhile dvd, and great for musicians and jazz fans alike!",1244764800,2,801,4.760869565217392
