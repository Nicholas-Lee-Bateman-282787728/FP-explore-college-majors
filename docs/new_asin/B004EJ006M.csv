8427078,5,B004EJ006M,"they aired two seasons of this on the scy fy channel and the show is definately a winner.  The effects are very good , and the show while aimed at kids is entertaining for adults. It is similiar to the sarah jane adventures, (which due to lead actresses death is now gone). The series remains within the doctor who universe and all fans of that show should enjoy this one. This is one that kids can easily watch too. K-9 has a human family in this one, several young men, a scientist and a detective. It takes place in the future , probably about 50 years from now or less. The robot itself is perhaps the bsst part of the show and due to the advances in technology even a lower budget show today can look very good indeed. This is not so low as to be on the level of a scy fy movie though, it's much better than that. This is series one on dvd and series two does exist. Perhaps amazon.coumuk has it.",1356998400,,901,4.119318181818182
8427079,4,B004EJ006M,"This is another take-off on one of the most loved robotic ""dogs"" K-9 from the mid-80s Tom Baker  only appears in the original form for one scene. The first episode sets up the premise of the show and you meet all of the major characters. Set in a dystopian future the protagonists fight evil in the form of ""The Department"" and assorted Dr. Who flavored aliens. I think that this show, developed two years after the ""Sarah Jane Adventures,"" was meant to capture a younger market (Saturday morning cartoon style) primarily in Australia. It is a very worthwhile effort for a (relatively) low budget serial. If I have the time I will start updating the episode descriptions on IMDB. By the way, for Dr. Who fanatics, John Leeson, a highly respected voice-over artist Who created K-9's original voice in 61 episodes of Dr. Who from 1977-1988 also does K-9's voice in 15 of the new episodes.",1342828800,6,886,4.67948717948718
