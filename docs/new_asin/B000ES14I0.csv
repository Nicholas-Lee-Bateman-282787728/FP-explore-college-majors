8113794,4,B000ES14I0,"The Sonny Siaki/Apolo-Chris Candido/Lance Hoyt match wasn't much of a bout mainly Chris getting injured at the beginning of it thus turning the tag team match into a hanicap match. The Prince of Darkness match between Bobby Roode & Dustin Rhodes was pretty bad as they just seemed to be going through the motions and nobody cared AT ALL. The blindfold stipulation made it worse. The 4 way Xscape match was a great bout. It had great sequences and some cool maneuvers. It may had some logic flaws but that's what made it greater. The Tables match between Jeff Hardy & Raven was a very good hardcore match with only one botch but that did not ruin the match one bit. The Strap match for the NWA world tag team titles was very good too. The story was simple & executed to perfection. The ending was good too. The X-Division title match between Christopher Daniels & Elix Skipper was a solid/back-and-forth bout. The First Lethal Lockdown match was nothing great as it was nothing more then a massive brawl from the get go but still enjoyable at some points. The Abyss-AJ Styles match was a impactful,hardcore,bloody & solid brawl with a mix of high-flying action and brutality. Overall,it was very good with main event(AJ Styles-Abyss),the 4 way xscape match and the X-Division title match bring the best matches on the card. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.",1287964800,,1353,4.641666666666667

--------------------------------------------------

Included in the ""TNA Anthology: The Epic Set"" box set are the following three pay-per-views:

* Victory Road 2004 (November 7, 2004) [TNA's first three-hour PPV]
* Turning Point 2004 (December 5, 2004) [TNA's second three-hour PPV]
* Lockdown 2005 (April 24, 2005) [TNA's first all-steel cage PPV]

Each PPV is split across two single-layer discs, as this was before TNA started using dual-layer discs.  I'm not very found of this, as I prefer for each event to be shown as one continuous three-hour program, but there's nothing us fans could do about it now.  TNA isn't going to re-release new DVDs of these old PPVs.  So we just have to live with the minor inconvenience of ejecting one disc and inserting another into the player to watch each event.  Bonus features are on the second disc of each PPV, in case you were wondering.

You should be aware that if you buy this set online, the three Disc 1's MIGHT be loose in the cases.  The first box set I ordered from Amazon had the first and third Disc 1's loose (Turning Point was the one that stayed put), while the second box set had all three Disc 1's loose.  All of the loose discs were scratched as a result of being loose and moving around while being shipped.  I had to return the first set because the scratches caused glitches when playing one of the discs.  The scratches on the second set looked bad, but thankfully the discs played fine.

There are lots of reviews of the three PPV's that cover the matches and give you the reviewer's opinions on them.  So I'm not going to say anything about that - though I did enjoy all of the matches, some a little more than others - rather I'm going to go into detail about the alterations that exist in the DVDs, when compared to the original live broadcasts.

I don't have the original live broadcasts of Victory Road 2004 and Turning Point 2004, so I don't know for sure if there are any alterations, but there *might* be in the Michael Shane (now Matt Bentley) matches.  You see, all instances of the name ""Michael Shane"" in commentary and on-screen graphics had to be changed to ""Matt Bentley"" for legal reasons.  This is because in July 2005, Matt Bentley was forced to refrain from using the ""Michael Shane"" alias, which he had used for his entire career, following threats of legal action from World Wrestling Entertainment, the employers of Mike Shane (one of the Gymini twins at the time), who had trademarked his name, something Bentley had neglected to do.

Bentley appears in the Victory Road 2004 PPV in the battle royale on Disc 1 (Chapter 2). He enters at 12:42 and is eliminated around 27:57. Bentley's match in the Turning Point 2004 PPV is on Disc 1 (Chapter 3) from 21:54 to 35:30.  In all likelihood, he originally used the name Michael Shane at these two events, so the commentary was probably re-recorded on the DVDs.

Now, the Lockdown 2005 PPV is one I have on tape, so I can give you complete details as to what was altered.  In fact, Lockdown 2005 was the first 3-hour TNA PPV I ever ordered, and the only one until Hardcore Justice 2010.

DISC 1
======
-- The 10-second long ""This is TNA: The new face of professional wrestling"" intro, which preceded the live program, has been removed from the DVD.

-- For legal reasons (the name was already copyrighted by another wrestler, then working for WWE), the wrestler known as ""Michael Shane"" had to have all instances of his name changed to ""Matt Bentley"".  The first alteration is in the video package that precedes the match, where a screen that read ""Shane"", now reads ""Bentley"".  When Michael/Matt comes out for the match, the graphic shown at the bottom of the screen was changed from ""Michael Shane"" to ""Matt Bentley w/ Trinity"".  The biggest change is that the commentary from Don West and Mike Tenay has been completely changed (re-recorded) for the entire match.  It's interesting to note that the name ""Michael Shane"" still appears on the entrance video playing in the background when he makes his entrance, and you can still hear the ring announcer announce him as ""Michael Shane"" behind the commentary at 40:17.

-- The Daniels/Skipper video package (which is the last footage on Disc 1) that precedes their match was much longer in the original live broadcast.  It stayed on the shot of the team on the entrance ramp longer, then followed for a minute or two with more footage and narration, before showing the black & white Turning Point footage.  The DVD cuts from a brief bit of the entrance ramp opening footage right to the Turning Point footage.

DISC 2
======
-- For legal reasons (WWE claimed copyright ownership), the wrestler known as ""The Outlaw"" had to have all instances of his name blurred or silenced out, with the name changed to ""Kip James"" on the DVD packaging and new commentary.  The first alteration is in the backstage segment with Dusty Rhodes where he picks the name of the next Lethal Lottery combatant.  He picks ""The Outlaw"", but the words are silenced out, thus leaving DVD viewers in the dark as to who just got picked (unless they could read Dusty's lips).  In the video package that follows the Dusty segment, a few instances of ""The Outlaw"" are silenced out.  The name ""Outlaw"" is blurred out on the pre-match line-up screen.  Finally, the commentary from Don West and Mike Tenay has been completely changed (re-recorded) for the entire match.

-- The DVD cuts out the Hard Justice 2005 ad at the end, originally shown on the live broadcast in between the end of the Styles/Abyss match and the TNA copyright ending.

The Lockdown 2005 DVD is dedicated to Chris Candido, who broke his leg at the live event, which lead to the post-surgery blood clot that caused his death four days later on April 28, 2005.  Since I did the research, I'd like to give you some information about the Chris Candido bonus features.

CHRIS CANDIDO BONUS FEATURE NOTES
=================================
-- The first match - Chris Candido and The Naturals (Chase Stevens & Andy Douglas) vs. Petey Williams (with Scott D'Amore), Elix Skipper, and Mikey Batts - was from the March 4, 2005 episode of Impact!

-- The second match - The Naturals (with Chris Candido) vs. America's Most Wanted (Lance Storm & Chris Harris) - was taped on April 26, 2005, and aired on the April 29, 2005 episode of Impact! on Fox Sports Net.  This episode was filmed and completed just before he passed away, but was dedicated to Chris with a photographic ""In Memory of Chris Candido"" screen at the start, and a photographic ""Chris Candido, 1972-2005"" screen at the end.  This was his final wrestling appearance.

-- The Xplosion outtakes were filmed about two weeks before he died, according to Jeremy Borash's exclusive comments on the Forever Hardcore DVD-R (which includes the same footage in chapter 42 of the main program - it's not on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/retail-DVD/dp/B0009YA3QI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">retail DVD</a>).  According to Borash, he was bandaged up and in a wheelchair because he was working an angle where he was supposedly injured as a result of getting beat up by Kevin Nash.

Since I taped the April 29, 2005 episode of Impact!, in which the second Candido match originally appeared, here are some notes on the differences between the original broadcast and the DVD.

* The original broadcast had a ""Tag Team Championship"" graphic over the initial close-up of the lights.

* The original broadcast had an ""Impact!"" on-screen graphic at the bottom of the screen naming each competitor as they entered: ""The Naturals, Chris Candido"" and ""America's Most Wanted"".

* The original broadcast had a 30 minute countdown banner across the top of the screen (with ""The Naturals vs AMW"" on the left and the Fox Sport Net logo on the right) for the entire match duration.  This is the ""Fox Box"" that Mike Tenay refers to at 9:27.

* In the original broadcast, 3 times during the match the Lockdown results would appear in a banner at the bottom of the screen.

* In the original broadcast from 17:10 to 17:17 there was a white banner at the top of the screen (right below the countdown banner) advertising the following month's Hard Justice pay-per-view.  It was accompanied by a sound effect when it appeared and disappeared, which is still heard on the DVD!

* The original broadcast at 18:30 there was a quick shot of a crowd member holding a nice AMW sign, which is missing from the DVD as it remains on the shot of the action that preceded and followed this crowd shot.

* In the original broadcast from 19:21 to 19:29 there was a small Hard Justice logo in the bottom right corner of the screen advertising the following month's pay-per-view.

* In the original broadcast from 21:26 to 21:32 there was a white banner at the top of the screen (right below the countdown banner) advertising the Jeff Jarrett vs. AJ Styles match on May 15th (at the Hard Justice PPV).  It was accompanied by a sound effect when it appeared and disappeared, which is still heard on the DVD!

* In the original broadcast, after the post-match comments, there was a replay of a shot of Candido on the floor by the side of the ring holding the belts, while Tenay's voiceover mentioned the matches for next week's show.  This was immediately followed by another Candido tribute screen which used a frame from that belt-holding shot.

And that concludes this analysis of the alterations between the original broadcasts and the DVDs.  The two biggest alterations in the Lockdown 2005 event are the result of legal name changes, so while I don't like the changes, I can't blame TNA for them.  Though I do think it's sad they let WWE claim copyright ownership of ""The Outlaw"" without fighting it.  There's no reason TNA should have left out the ""This is TNA"" intro (it's on the other two PPVs), and shorten down the Daniels/Skipper video package, as there was PLENTY of room for those extra few minutes on the disc.  So that's not forgivable.  And I only mentioned the removal of the Hard Justice 2005 ad at the end just to be complete.  That's definitely no great loss.

The changes to the Impact! match featuring The Naturals (with Chris Candido) vs. America's Most Wanted are, for the most part, completely welcome.  Watching the original tape from 2005, it was really sad that Fox Sports Net (FSN) forced TNA to put up that stupid countdown banner across the top of the screen for the entirety of the match.  Like anybody really cares about time limits anymore in wrestling.  The constant banner ads for the next PPV and scrolling Lockdown results on the bottom just added to the screen clutter.  So I'm happy that all of that crud is gone on the DVD.  Though I do find it funny that the PPV banner ad sound effect is still there.  I don't like that TNA removed the ""Tag Team Championship"" graphic and entrance name graphics as they added to the presentation.  That initial close-up of the lights looks naked without the graphic over it. I still don't know what to make of the removal of the quick shot of the crowd member holding the AMW sign.  The sign had a really nice drawing on it, and was certainly worth showing a quick shot of.  It's not like there was any real action going on in the match for those 3 or 4 seconds, anyway.",1285200000,,11969,4.8379970544918995

8113797,5,B000ES14I0,"The title is a reference to the fact that Don West would not shut the hell up throughout the entire event about how because it's a six sided cage, the steel is tighter than on 4 sided cages.

The event itself was great, and just what I expect from an all-cage TNA event... not a lot of focus on the cage, but on wrestling, and with enough cage usage to warrant its appearance.

Apolo and Sonny Siaki vs Lance Hoyt and Chris Candido
Chris Candido suffered a leg injury in the beginning of this match which caused his death several days later.  The match was not spectacular afterwards.  (5/10)

""Prince of Darkness"" Match
Dustin Rhodes vs Bobby Roode
Considering it had Dustin Rhodes in it, and a sort of stipulation I imagine would invoke ""Fire Russo"" chants, I was surprised by the match being a good one, with some very good wrestling on the part of both men.  They had intense chemistry that died as soon as the third fall came around and both men were blindfolded.  Fire Russo.  (7/10)

Ultimate Xscape Match
Chris Sabin vs Sonjay Dutt vs Matt Bentley vs Shocker
Classic X division style matchup.  And just as in cage tag matches, it gradually loosens its grip on the tag stipulation and you start seeing plenty of double teaming and shifts in action.  I greatly enjoyed seeing Sonjay Dutt's gimmick as ""the playa from the Himalaya"", which is so much more simpler and yet innovative compared to that Guru crap he uses now which is both racist and WCW-esque.  Fire Russo.  Also, Trinity climbs to the top of the cage and moonsaults on all the men in a phenomenal spot.  (10/10)

Tables Match
Jeff Hardy vs Raven
Rant time... I know Raven is beloved by a lot of people, but I have to ask... what's his appeal? I've always found myself forcing myself to be impressed by his promos and such, but they just don't impress me. Granted, I haven't even seen most of his promos from ECW and WCW, but what I saw and especially in TNA, it was really... unimpressive. Just not very spellbinding and a bit generic.

His wrestling was almost nonexistent. It was just garbage wrestling; FMW or XPW style. Even Jeff Hardy seemed completely out of it... there was virtually no chemistry between the two, as they just seemed to be wrestling together, but not wrestling each other. Even the high spots felt faint and dull... that top of the cage Swanton, perhaps due to the camera angle, or the fact that Jeff just sort of slipped off the top rather than jumped, looked a lot less ""holy s***"" inducing than it probably was. The leg drop through the table was the same. Raven could easily have been replaced with some generic jobber or CAW and it wouldn't have changed the match at all.  (2/10)

NWA Tag Team Championship
America's Most Wanted (C) vs Team Canada (Petey Williams and Eric Young)
Team Canada and AMW are awesome.  This match was great, though for my taste had too much outside interference.  Despite the constant beating Chris Harris got on the outside by one of the Team Canada members (not Williams or Young), they managed to make it an exciting story unfolding, along with Harris making it into the ring enough to put on some great tag team action.  (9/10)

X Division Championship
Christopher Daniels (C) vs Elix Skipper
I love Triple X, and as kayfabe painful as it was to see these two wrestle, they did a great job of wrestling.  Despite the high flying nature of the two, they managed not to turn it into a high-flying ""spotfest"" as so infected Wrestling Society X, and make it into a greatly handled pure wrestling contest.  (10/10)

Lethal Lockdown Match
Sean Waltman, Diamond Dallas Page, BG James vs Jeff Jarrett, Monty Brown, Kip James
I was going to ask, but apparently someone else said that the reason ""Outlaw"" is censored and blurred on the DVD is because the WWE mysteriously owns the copyright for it.  What?  The match wasn't great, but it was entertaining.  Just the sort of thing you'd see in an Attitude Era WWF match.  (7/10)

AJ Styles vs Abyss
Classic matchup.  The whole ""David vs Goliath"" little face vs monster heel thing is a classic archetypal duel, but these two not only played it to perfection, they innovated.  AJ Styles is called Phenomenal for reasons on display throughout this entire matchup, and Abyss shows yet again that he's not just a Mankind/Kane rip-off by not only playing the monster heel to sickening perfection (the stiff cagedoor hits to AJ's head come to mind), but by innovating that role himself with some great moves and tactics, such as tossing the referee into the cage to knock AJ off the top.  (10/10)

A definite highlight of TNA, and with 30 minutes bonus features from the event, plus 30 minutes bonus matches as a tribute to Chris Candido, it's one of the best releases by TNA I've seen thus far.",1215216000,,4757,4.583924349881797
8113798,4,B000ES14I0,"I have been a wrestling fan since 1996 and have watched all kinds of wrestling. I have a wrestling DVD/VHS collection spanning over 50 all together.

(Note-Each DVD I review has a ""Match of the DVD"" award somewhere in it.)

TNA Lockdown 2005
Lockdown is TNA's all cage PPV. Every single match is contested inside of the demonic Six Sides of Steel. TNA took a big gamble on this first Lockdown PPV, but it turned out to be one of their most successful PPVs they show each year. This show is packed with great matches, and I suggest that any wrestling fan buy it.

-Disc 1-
Six Sides of Steel
Sonny Siaki & Apolo VS Chris Candido & Lance Hoyt
Chris Candido breaks his leg seconds into the match. This leaves Hoyt to fend off both Siaki and Apolo. Hoyt does a good job of keeping this entertaining, but it's just a short, simple opener.
RATING- 7/10

Six Sides of Steel- Prince of Darkness Match
Dustin Rhodes VS Bobby Roode
The Prince of Darkness Match plays out like a 2/3 falls match would. The only difference is that if it goes to a third fall, both men will be blindfolded. The first two falls aren't bad and has some fairly entertaining wrestling. Once the third fall comes into play, the match is just as stupid as you would expect. It's really obvious that both men can see anyway.
RATING- 4/10

Six Sides of Steel- Xscape Match
Chris Sabin VS Matt Bentley VS Sonjay Dutt VS Shocker
I'd like to start this off by saying Shocker sucks. He is sloppy and can't wrestle at all. At least that's what he shows in this match. Sabin does a very good job in this match and does one of the best Liger Bombs I've ever seen. Trinity does a huge Moonsault off the top of the cage...yes, Trinity.
RATING- 7.5/10

Six Sides of Steel- Tables Match
Jeff Hardy VS Raven
If you love highflying, brutal action, you are going to love this match. Jeff Hardy flies off the Steel Cage twice in this one. Raven dishes out some punishment as well. There are a good number of screw-ups that bring this match down though.
RATING- 8.5/10

Six Sides of Steel- Strap Match
NWA World Tag Team Championships
America's Most Wanted(c) VS Team Canada
Despite this being a Strap Match, the straps rarely come into play and are just weapons that are used periodically throughout the match. Chris Harris is trapped outside of the ring by A1 for the majority of the match. With Harris trapped, Storm gets beat down for a while inside the cage. Nothing really happens until Harris finally enters the Cage. If you want a great Tag Team Steel Cage match, check out Triple X VS America's most Wanted from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TNA-Turning-Point-2004-Destiny-Awaits/dp/B000G38AWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TNA Turning Point 2004 Destiny Awaits!</a>.
RATING- 6.5/10

-Disc 2-

Six Sides of Steel
X Division Championship
Christopher Daniels(c) VS Elix Skipper
Former Triple X teammates take on each other for the X Division Championship. The match itself was pretty good with its good high spots. Daniels is working on the shoulder of Skipper for most of the match. They are also playing off of the fact that they know each other so well. Skipper takes a huge dive off of the Six Sides of Steel.
RATING- 7.5/10

Six Sides of Steel- Lethal Lockdown
Diamond Dallas Page/Sean Waltman/BG James VS Jeff Jarrett/Monty Brown/Kip James
Waltman and Jeff Jarrett start that match. After 5 minutes, another competitor would enter the match. Every 2 minutes after that, another person would come in. This isn't like the Lethal Lockdown you would see in later Lockdown PPVs like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TNA-Wrestling-Lockdown-2006/dp/B000GCG6D2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TNA Wrestling: Lockdown 2006</a>. There is no roof with weapons attached to it. This is just a big brawl inside of the cage.
RATING- 8/10

Six Sides of Steel (Match of the DVD)
Number 1 Contenders Match
AJ Styles VS Abyss
AJ Styles can wrestle any type of wrestler and put on an amazing show. He takes Abyss to the limit. They begin by Styles diving through the door to the outside onto Abyss. After that these two brawl all over the iMPACT! Zone. Styles gets busted open early by due to a wicked attack with the Steel Cage door. Styles hits the Styles Clash on Abyss into thumbtacks. The ending is insane.

8113799,5,B000ES14I0,"ok tna puts on a ppv with every match being a 6 sides of steel. i must say all the wwe fans said this was going to be stupid but it was absolutely great and a tna classic

matchs include-

1.) sonny siaki, apolo vs. lance hoyt, chris candido- this match was i think chris candidos last in which 2 minutes into the match he broke his leg and lance hoyt had to fend for himself and after the match the naturals attack lance hoyt 6/10

2.) dustin rhodes vs. booby roode w/ coach d'more- 2/3 falls prince of darkness match- what happens is if each man gets a pin and it comes down to the 3rd fall it becomes a prince of darkness deathmatch which is when both men are blindfolded. this match was (in my opion) too long but still some what good 7.5/10

3.)matt bentley w/ traci vs. shocker vs. chris sabin vs. sonjay dutt- ultimate x scape match- what happens is it is an elimination (pinfall or submission) until it gets down to the last 2 then the objective is to escape the cage- this match was a good x-division showcase and was pretty good- 8/10

4.) jeff hardy vs. raven- tables match- what happens is there is about 8 tables in the ring and the objective is to put your opponent through 1 of them- this match was one of the better ones on the dvd and is worth a watch once or twice 8/10

5.) amw vs. team canada w/ a1- nwa tag team titels strap match- this isn't your usuale wwe strap match where to guys are hooked together. in this match there are 2 leather belts to beat his your with. this match is REALLY GOOD. what happens in the beginning is a1 beats up chris harris in the beginning and james strom is in the cage with eric young and petey williams while chris harris is geting beat up outside. chris harris eventually makes his way into the cage. this match has a surprise ending with a really good fininsh 10/10

6.) christopher daniels vs. elix skipper- x division title- these 2 men have been partners for about 3 years and were forced to break up when they lost to amw at turning point and are now going to wrestle each other. i must say i found nothing special in this match except for a few things but not much in this match but somewhat good 7.5/10

7.) team ddp(ddp, sean waltman , ?) vs. team jarrett( jeff jarrett, monty brown, kip james)- lethal lockdown- what happens is 2 men start out then every few minutes another person comes into the match then when all 6 men are in the cage then a pinfall or submission can happen- 2 things to note in this match. 1 is that the ? is because kevin nash could not wrestle because he had a rare staff infection on his leg that he revealed at the beginning of the show and we have to wait until the lockdown match to see who the mystery fill in will be. 2 is that kip james was know as the outlaw and tna did its best to bleep out and censor that name because wwe ( once again being ittiots) claimed a copyright on it.- but overall this match was good but i think it couldve had a somewhat better finish but still good 9/10

8.)abyss vs. aj styles- #1 contender for the nwa heavyweight title- this match is worth every penny!!! with this match being about 25 minutes. you cant take your eyes off this match for 1 second and it is one of tna's best matches ever. they brawl outside for about 10 minutes with aj doing some of his awesome high flying moves and jumping through the crowd. and abyss doing a great deal of punishment on aj and even slamming the cage door in his face three times!!! 11/10

there you have it tna lockdown 2005. this dvd also has extras and a chris candido tribute which features about 3 or 4 matches in their entirity. so in conclusion i would like to say this has to be one of the best ppvs of tna that you could buy, so buy it, you won't be dissapointed!!!!!",1193788800,,3745,4.174515235457064
8113800,4,B000ES14I0,"This was without a doubt a very memorable PPV with unique concept for a PPV that actually worked.  Every single match would be held inside a steel cage...but what's more memorable than anything else about this PPV is that fact that this was the last PPV appearence of Chris Candido as he passed away less than a week later.  They have a tribute to Candido as an extra feature.

Apolo & Sonny Siaki vs. Lance Hoyt & Chris Candido - This was just a opening match, nothing special except for the first minute when Candido broke his ankle due to one of the guys (can't remember if it's Siako or Apolo) fell on it after a dropkick.  After that, it's a handicap match with Hoyt fighting alone.

2 Out Of 3 Falls ""Prince Of Darkness Match"": Dustin Rhodes vs. Bobby Rude - Don't let the 2 outta 3 falls things fool you because the first fall happens so quick that it looks like the referee made a mistake or something.  Anyways, in the third fall...it's a blindfold match and if you've seen one blindfold match, you've basically seen them all.

Ultimate Xscape Match: Shocker vs. Matt Bentley (with Trinity) vs. Chris Sabin vs. Sonjay Dutt
You gotta elimate two participants before the actual match starts. To win, you gotta be the first to escape the cage. It was a photo finish in the end & overall a great match but the real show stealer was Trinity's moonsault from the top of the cage.
Note: Also available on the ""Best Of The X Division"" DVD

Table Match: Jeff Hardy vs. Raven - Basically the best match Raven's had in TNA for almost half a year and Hardy is great at these hardcore themed matches. One of the best matches on this disc. Raven & Hardy gave a great show.
Note: Also available on the Jeff Hardy DVD

Tag Team Champions America's Most Wanted vs. Team Canada (Petey Williams & Eric Young) - Great tag team match overall.  There were high expectations after they were two of the guys in the Turning Point cage match.

X Division Champion Christopher Daniels vs. Primetime Elix Skipper - Another great match between two from the X division.  Too much hype going since they were two of the guys in the Turning Point cage match.

Lethal Lockdown Match: DDP, Sean Waltman, B.G. James vs. Jeff Jarrett, Monty Brown, Kip James - First of all, the commentary is redone do to WWE enforcing the copywrite of ""The Outlaw"".  This is under War Games rules where each time member comes in after a certain amount of time.  Originally, it was suppost to be Kevin Nash but he got hurt (go figure!) so B.G. took his place.  Great weapons brawl overall and also told a nice story between B.G. & Kip James during the match.

AJ Styles vs. Abyss - This match is just awesome.  It's not really a bloody massacre but a great storytelling of ""the big unstoppable monster vs. the little guy who never gives up.""

The DVD extras are basically behind the scenes footage of the guys along with different camera angles from certain moments of the matches.

There's also the Chris Candido tribute which is a six tag tag team match from IMPACT (don't remember everyone involved right now); The Naturals with Candido facing America's Most Wanted for the tag team titles; and his last TV appearence co-hosting TNA Xplosion.

Overall, one of the best TNA PPV's & worth every penny.",1141257600,11,3320,4.527638190954774
