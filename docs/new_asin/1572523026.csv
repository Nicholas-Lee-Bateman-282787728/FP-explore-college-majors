189804,5,1572523026,"I saw this movie before I left the US about a year ago and it deeply affected me. It shows better than any movie I have ever seen how people who are  otherwise normal are capable of turning into monsters. A depiction of  the senselessness of war that even ""Saving Private Ryan"" was not  able to top. Although this movie was a Serbian production, it does not take  sides in the conflict that it depicts. Instead it shows a human side of the  war - the characters are both good and evil. I recommend it to anyone.",924825600,8,511,4.22680412371134
189805,5,1572523026,"I ordered this film last month and waited by the mailbox for it to arrive. Pretty Village Pretty Flame is the first film I have seen that actually shows a side of the war many Americans and even Western Europeans didn't  see. Although this film is a satire it must have some heart felt memories.  The only I can be almost positive that this has true accounts of life in  the Former Yugoslavia is that I saw the horrible end of these once unified  states. In my experience in IFOR through the year of 1996 (Jan.-Feb.) I  have heard many stories from Bosnian Croats, Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian  Serbs.  If you would like to see something of this war in the Former  Yugoslavia you should check this film out.",922838400,6,706,4.4186046511627906
189806,5,1572523026,"'Pretty Village, Pretty Flame' is one of the most stunning films I've seen - and perhaps the greatest war/anti-war film of the 1990s.  It's bleak, disturbing, gripping and moving (and also darkly humourous).
Before I saw  'Pretty Village, Pretty Flame', I knew little and understood little about  the violent break-up of Yugoslavia - but ever since I was first mesmerised  by the film 18 months ago, I can't stop reading about that conflict.  That's how powerful 'Pretty Village, Pretty Flame' was for this viewer.",921110400,7,514,5.071428571428571
189807,5,1572523026,"This movie is incredible!! It is a ""must-see"" for all those who are interested in life, politics, and basic human madness.  It is a ladder which many of us needed in order to further reach an understanding (or  attempt to) of the extremely complex situation in the former Yugoslavia.  It is beautifully produced, and the plot unfolds in a very unique fashion.  Do beware, you will walk away from this movie with a weird feeling in your  stomach and with only one word on your mind...""Why?'",917395200,4,489,4.6395348837209305
189808,5,1572523026,"This movie is set in pre post and during the Serbian conflict, shows the other side of the story, the side that the Americans would not be let seen. It is the story of 2 friends one a Serb and one a Muslim growing up and  parting their separate ways just before the war starts. I found this movie  very touching especially as it is a true account of the people it is about.  When this movie was shot the war was still going on less than 30 kms away  and in the same tunnel as the story, even things that were used in the  battle that took place in real life were used in the movie, giving it that  sense of realism that not even ""Private Ryan"" could come close  to.",915580800,11,665,3.992424242424242
189809,5,1572523026,"Pretty Village, Pretty Flame provides a rare glimpse and an objective account of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the 1990's.  The movie tackles the brutality and complexity of a war that has repeatedly fallen victim to distortion and propaganda by different parties with different agendas (both direct and indirect ""players"" with a high stake in the Balkans).  The cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are extraordinary to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!

Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!",1109721600,5,722,5.252173913043478
189810,5,1572523026,"There isn't much I could say that others haven't already. No single movie could ever hope to describe what happened in the Balkans. No mortal soul could for that matter. But the movie does surprisingly well in showing us the two most important lessons: what happens when neighbor turns against neighbor, and the insanity of it all. Some previous reviewers have said that this movie has a pro-Serb bias..I disagree entirely..And to those people, I would pose the question of what it would take to make them happy? Would another scene of Serbs burning Muslim houses make them happy? Or two scenes, or three?? Such statements are ridiculous.

This next bit is for the Yugoslavs out there...

Placem svaki put kad razmislim o tom svemu. Ako ste vi jedni od tih koji verujete da je vasa strana (Srpska, Muslimansa, ili Hrvatska) bila nevina, onda ste vi cisto budale. Ne zelim da vas uvredim, ali stanite malo i razmislite o tom svemu. Svi smo u tim prokletim ratovima izgubili. Dok smo bili zajedno bili smo jaki i nezavisni. A sad smo svi slabi i ponizeni. Ceo svet nam zapoveda sta da radimo, i kako da radimo, i Amerika i Evropa. Koriste nas za njihove licne igre...I ekonomske, i politicke, i socialne. Jedino su se Sloveni nekako srecom izvukli. Ali mi je drago, sto vidim da sa prolaskom godina ima ipak nekog oprostaja. Tek ovih dana mogu prici nekom nasem ovde u inostranstvu bez straha i bez tog pitanja..Odakle si?... I hvala bogu davno nisam cuo te reci Ustasa ili Cetnik od nasih..Samo na starim filmovima i na ustima stranaca. Ne moramo se ponovo sjedinjiti, al se MORAMO pomiriti.

189811,1,1572523026,"This film was probably made not to entertain the audience, but more to show as much as possible the reality of the terrible agresion on Bosnia. But it does so for a small part only, showing the Bosniaks and Serbs living together peacefuly before the agresion. With the begin of hostilities this film leaves its half-folkloral nature and becomes a pure propaganda movie of serbian nationalists. Its attempt to blind the viewer, hoping he never watchs news or read a newspaper, is amaturelike and fails not only through its fake of reality, but also through poor cinematografic form. The dialogs are poor and the actors definitely not worth the theme of the movie. Handfull of interesting phrases and few fleshes of situation are by far not enough to save the movie from the abyss. The handling shows several onlogical moments. And as a concept of ""we all suffered and we Serbs did not start the war"" it only makes a serious and average informed viewer laughing. This movie does not entertain at all, and shows the events as unrealistic as any B - movie about Vietnamwar. And about facts it shows only that there are very unserious and nationalistic directors and producers in Serbia. My rating is absolutely thumb down. Comparing with, for example, No Man's Land this motion picture is failing in everything that makes movies about war a potential time window about occurences in former Yugoslavia. Instead to jump into the minds of people that participated the war, You can only get an idea of dogma that the director is trying to spread by making this underaverage movie.",1089417600,9,1572,4.825925925925926
189812,5,1572523026,"The movie is honestly a master piece. It talks about most important things in life, those you have no influence at..It had deeply disturbed me and it showed that in a war ALL the nations fighting are QUILTY! I didn't see anything pro-Serb in the movie and I'm shocked that some of the reviewers used this space to talk against Serbs. Just for the record, I am NO Serb.
This is one of the greatest anti-war movies I have ever seen. Strongly recommended.",1085875200,19,452,4.457831325301205
189813,5,1572523026,"- (...). This is a triumph of filmmaking (with zero budget) and writing, even though the translation is terrible.
- Pretty Village, Pretty Flame is not about who started what, when or how. It's about people caught up in the midst of something fundamentally senseless. It's about lost souls and desperation.
- This movie is heavy to watch and in my opinion one of the best war movies ever made. Second only to Roman Polanski's The Pianist. I highly recommend it.",1083628800,19,461,4.703703703703703
189814,5,1572523026,"This film is great, ok it clearly has not been made with a Hollywood budget but thats besides the point. I first saw this film in Bosnia when it was released and it caused quite a stir. The translation into English on this DVD is at best pathetic, prehaps that is why so many of our self appointed Balkan historians in the USA have missed the point of this movie, its not the war according to CNN, its made by people who understand the history and the culture of the region because they live in it and experience it first hand. The film seeks to draw out the contrast of a people who at one time lived together in brotherhood and unity as Yugoslavians who shared the same childhood experiences together, listened to the same music and went to the same schools and now find themselves in a conflict that is as much about nationalism as it is religion. More importantly the film portrays the normal people of Bosnia as just that normal human beings who are caught up and activly involved in a civil war, be they Croat, Muslim or Serb. A welcome relief from the typical 'bad Serb' properganda normally spouted by people who have never even been to Bosnia let alone live there. The viewer is shown how the thin veneer of civilisation is soon stripped away in such a complicated and bloody conflict. And the film also has the typical humor of the people of Bosnia that was evident even in such dark times. Open your mind and let this film challange the common misconceptions of the war in Bosnia.",1083024000,19,1491,4.445255474452555
189815,2,1572523026,"Unless you're from Yugoslavia, have some connection to Yugoslavia, or are interested specifically in a sociological study of the Yugoslav wars, DO NOT waste your time or money on this movie. Yeah, it's all of the things that other reviewers have said: an anti-war film, an honest portrayal of the Bosnian War, etc.;  it's also a poor quality movie. The plot is ridiculously simple, the characters are less than caricatures, and a lot of the shots and cinematography are worse than a junior high school film project. I have tried to read every book (in English) and watch every movie that deals with the Bosnian War, so I'm not uninformed when I say that this was the cheesiest, lowest grade work that I've seen. Yes, the plot and the characters are fairly accurate depictions of real life events and characters, and that is the ONLY reason I gave this movie two stars. Technically speaking, the best way that this movie can be described is that it is quite similar to a late Soviet era propaganda film in both quality and character development.
Unless you fit into one of the above categories of people, don't waste your time or money. If you want a better anti-war film about the Bosnian War, I'd recommend ""No Man's Land"" instead. Another native perspective on the conflict is ""Shot Through the Heart"" (based on the book ""The Anti-Sniper"") which is a decent movie, but nothing wonderful--a higher quality version of ""Pretty Village, Pretty Flame.""
If you'd like a wonderful human interest perspective on the Bosnian War, I'd recommend ""Savior"" and ""Harrison's Flowers,"" although both of which use American characters to carry the storyline. ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" is one step behind those two--decent, not great, and it uses a Brit to carry the storyline. ""Behind Enemy Lines"" would be the Hollywood, Ameri-centric take on the war--well made, but not really a lot of insights. All are better than ""Pretty Village, Pretty Flame.""",1082592000,4,1929,4.91717791411043
189816,1,1572523026,"First, this film is grainy and jerky - a poor level of filmmaking at the most basic level.
Second, it is in too many respects imitative of what its makers think is trendy Western filmmaking.  But rather than technique and cinematography making the film interesting, it just makes it incoherent.  Kids/adults, friends/enemies, neighbors/murderers: no progressions, no consistency, nothing to put together.
Third, human life can't survive under the conditions the film portrays.  There would not be any food to eat, water to drink, medical care or supplies, living women or children, habitation, functioning vehicles or fuel, weapons to use, or bullets to fire.  All we are shown is continuing and total devastation.  Sometime, someone has to brew the liquor they stay drunk upon, grow and cook the food they eat, build the structures they keep reducing to rubble etc.  Sometime, someone has to get sober!  Everyone isn't always on the firing line.
Fourth, it really isn't PRO anything or CON anything.  It just wants to shock and disgust us.  That being the case, I can't really like or dislike, agree or disagree with anything in it.  There is not religion, love, healing, friendship, gentleness, morality, allegiance, kindness, or any other positive human quality.  But I'd claim that SOME ontology - some subscription to value and meaning - is a requirement for a film to be worth watching.  I mean, if something is ONLY sewage, ONLY vomit, it doesn't exactly maintain our interest very long.  This film is a pretense that sewage and vomit are the total reality.  But S & V only make sense in terms of larger realities of which they represent a small and temporary aberration.
All in all, a pretentious and second-rate film.  While far from a perfect film about this area, a somewhat better one is SAVIOR.",1082073600,2,1807,4.956810631229236
189817,5,1572523026,"I found it extremely interesting to read the politically-oriented reviews which several people posted before. This film is NOT about who was right and wrong in the war. It clearly states that EVERYONE was wrong.
Deeming this a pro-Serbian film is fundamentally wrong - the stereotypical caracters depict different political and social groups within Serbian society, and criticize them to a great extent. Yes this film does show Bosnians killing Bosnian Serbs. However, it also shows those same Serbs burning Bosnian houses, and killing their family members. By no means is this film biased towards one side - the story that it is based on might be, but Dragojevic manages to superbly move away from petty differences. (depicted masterfully by Tanic in ""No Man's Land"" with the ""Who started the war?"" discussion)
This film is about an ogre which lives in a tunnel. An ogre which is in all of us, the inner evil which needs to come out. Moreover, this film is about the refusal of human society to accept that the forces which drive us to do evil are within ourselves.
This film must not be looked at solely at the plot-level. It is filled with metaphors, similes, and symbolism. Very strong religious Christian and Muslim symbols are present, and different criticisms of the past - especially the communist era.
Pretty Village, Pretty Flame brings me to tears, not only because it includes a part of my past which I do not appreciate remembering, but also because it so clearly shows how the innate human need for mazochism eventually overcomes any social boundaries. The more boundaries it overcomes, says Dragojevic, the more dangerous its consequences are.
I recommend this movie to anyone interested in Yugoslavia - the full effect and understanding of the war can only be achieved by watching it together with ""No Man's Land"".",1071100800,16,1830,4.944805194805195
189818,1,1572523026,"Politically motivated movies are fine, but they can be done more subtle.  I don't think this movie is any good in that sense.  The Serbian director is trying to present Serbian Army as being attacked, but we all know what happened in Bosnian conflict.  Good luck next time.",1048291200,5,273,4.645833333333333
189819,1,1572523026,"Make no mistake, this is a superb film, worthy of four or five stars in itself. But what we have to review here is this particular DVD transfer of the film, and that is what my poor rating reflects.
I'm surprised no-one has mentioned a basic problem with the transfer, which is in 4:3 mode with a 1.78 aspect ratio (ie non-anamorphic). That's not so serious in itself, although an anamorphic transfer would have allowed a sharper picture when the film is viewed on a widescreen television, and optimum resolution whatever the TV.
What is fatal for anyone with a widescreen TV, or who will in the future own such a TV, is that the second line of the subtitles is placed in the matte area of the screen. That means that when the DVD is viewed optimally on a widescreen TV, that second line of the subtitles disappears outside the TV frame.
To see the subtitles on a widescreen TV, the film must be viewed in 4:3 mode, with black bars on all four sides taking up 44% of the screen space! The usual practice is that subtitles are placed within the film frame, and then this problem doesn't exist.
The type of transfer presented here is simply unsuitable for viewing on a 16:9 screen, for no apparent reason except the effort required to do the job properly. I have been disappointed with transfers before, but this is the first I actually regret buying. In this case, it would be better to watch the film on digital broadcast.",1047254400,12,1422,4.494208494208494
189820,5,1572523026,"Well, enough was said about this film already, so I will only stress that in this film there are some statements that represent the whole essence of all 90's wars on Balkan.
The first one is about comrade Tito who stole a lot but gave some to people; others just stole and didn't give anything back. Well as a citizen of former Yugoslavia I can only say, in old times living was good on territory of whole Yugoslavia nowadays in Slovenia we live quite good as compared to other not so lucky ex-Yugoslavia citizens. Democracy on Balkan is funny thing, for us (ex-Austro-Hungarian part of Yugoslavia) it is composed of full human-rights specter as opposed to others whose priority is safety of basic human rights such as life an right to a property. Comrade Tito gave us just enough human-rights to satisfy both sides, still after the collapse of Yugoslavia in 1991 we all felt betrayed since Yugoslavia was still our country, not somebody else's one even though 90% of Slovenians were for independence.
The other one is about the burning villages (beautiful villages burning nicer than ugly-ones). The statement represents insanity of all parties involved in civil war in Bosnia, why all this killing and suffering as we already know the result, all beautiful will die and at the end the one who will profit are they who didn't event dare to be directly involved... you can figure it out who they are.
At the end you have doubts in who actually started this war politics or just ethnic tensions of individuals. There is no universal answer, just more questions, but one thing is certain, every good and patriotic civil war with flags and roses ends up in a pile of garbage and lots and lots of death and suffering.",1017273600,16,1713,4.694352159468439

189822,4,1572523026,"Pretty Village, Pretty Flame is about serbs living in a tunnel and they have to fight muslims. They do not show what muslims had to go throgh because of the serbs,which is unrealistic. The movie had alot of swearing and it is in serb-croat language with english subtitles. Good scenery and Good music sometimes. Oh yea my dads from montenegro bar i think and i bought the movie for him.....",1007683200,,390,4.585714285714285
189823,5,1572523026,"This is a first rate war movie, right up there with Saving Private Ryan or Thin Red Line. But, to really understand it, first you have to be from Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia or Bosna/Herzegovina. Second, you must be smart and intelligent enough to see through it and third, you must not have dear friends and family killed in a war.
That's a pretty tall order, I know...
At first sight, the movie looks as pure Milosevic's propaganda and it's obvious why is that. It was the only way it could get made. But the authors were smarter, so they did what Verhoeven did with ""Starship Troopers""- an all-out SF action for the masses and clever satire for the classes.
The story revolves around two friends (a Serb and A Muslim) who end up on different sides in the war (naturally), one being sieged by the other (both with their troops) in the unfinished tunnel of ""Brotherhood and Unity"" (excellent parallel, watch out for many more) somehwere in Bosnia... Terror, despair, friendship turned sour, people fooled by propaganda... All come out through the memories of better times for all peoples of the Balkans.
The telling of the story is rather complex, but you'll get it on your second or third viewing, if you can stomach it. Some scenes are quite disturbing, so watch out. This is not for children at all...",994204800,42,1303,4.6695652173913045
189824,4,1572523026,"I remember years ago sitting and watching the conflict in Bosnia on my TV, a news report I think it was and realizing that everyone looked alike.  There were no special characteristics of Croatians, Serbians or Muslims that set them apart visually  and yet they were at war.  I wondered how people knew whom to kill?  Couldn't one simply change sides if one found themselevs in a situation where they needed to be on the otherside to survive.  Odd things like that strike me about the world and so I tend to collect odd films that say something about the world we're in (or perhaps other ones).  This film accomplishes pulling the viewer in, I always know a good film if I forget that I'm watching actors for a second, if my disbelief is suspended.  Which is why my choices tend to be so esoteric, so wide ranging, it takes a lot to get me not thinking about the film (having made a few) and thinking instead about the story (having written many), the quality of a war picture, I generally shy away from them because I believe that war is an abomination and not for entertainment purposes, but this one transcends that.  The beginning is a little experimental, jumping between time and place, between character in a way that sets up the viewer for an entirely different film than the second half.  There are many storylines going on here, almost too many but at the same time I felt that the subtitles made it work, the constant shifting.  The final time spent in a tunnel, when the question of survival seems the most in question for so many in teh film is both funny, brutal and real.  Each soldier and one reporter are pushed further and further beyond the boundaries of humanity by the enemy surrounding them and their own personalities.  Quickly their informal ranks break down and we see them as marauders who don't quite know how they got that way, some for noble reasons, others by accident and some for loyalty to state or family.  There are several moments when everyone appears to be a type---the smart one, the old one, the hero, the crazy one, the funny one, etc. in this foxhole and then they unveil themselves, become something entirely different. This film is about a specific war, a specific breakdown that pitted friends and family against each other, that tore a country apart and it does fall back on easy conventions because they are true but it also shows a brutality and senselessness of battles and war and even that in the foxhole, no one ever comes up with a concrete plan to get out, none of these peopel are the stereotypical soldier.  In the end, one man drags himself to detah trying to kill another in a hospital simply because of ethnicity and it was almost worth the entire film to see his friend try and stop him.  War isn't glory or wonderful PearlHarbor special effects, it's garbled communicatiosn and convincing one man to kill another simply because another man has told you to and hwo easily we all fall for the political okey-doke to do so.",994118400,3,2981,4.566604127579738
189825,5,1572523026,"Pretty Village Pretty Flame is a stunning achievement. The director does not feel the need to spell his message out, but simply portray what war does to his sympathetic protagonists. Because these people are warm, laconic, funny - better company than most film characters, their deaths or the destruction of their personalities hurt all the more. The stream of flashbacks keeps the narrative fresh and compelling.
It's a Serbian-made film, and the bulk of the atrocities committed against people in the film are inflicted on Bosnian Serbs by Muslims (although we hear references to the torture to death of Muslim soldiers). But if you can read this film as a celebration of the Serbian cause - from the initial dedication to ""the film industry of a country which no longer exists"" to the vast line of bodies at the end - having seen its cynical depiction of the Serb home front, you've been spending too much time watching brainless blockbusters. Yes, it's shown from a Serb point of view, but the film pulls no punches and the Muslims we meet are as lost and human as the Serbs.

The tensions and countervailing cohesion of 1980s Bosnia are vividly  presented, and the manner in which people found themselves in a civil war,  sometimes despite themselves. It's also a wonderfully, darkly humorous  movie despite the stupidity and banality of the horrific events that  occurred in Bosnia.

When  I bought a copy in America, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that it  included a couple of scenes absent from the UK version.  No violence or sex  that was cut out, just two complete scenes that make the story a little  tighter.  Unfortunately, the print for the US version is far inferior to  the UK and European video quality.  It's muddier and not as sharp.  A  shame.  I can't speak for the DVD, but the tape is certainly worth buying  because this is one of the best anti-war films I have ever seen.  A real  gem.  Dragojevic is a very talented filmmaker.

189831,5,1572523026,"Honestly ""Pretty willage, pretty flame"" is one of the best movies I ever saw.  It shows the most realistic picture of war in Bosnia, than in most other Bosnian movies.  It shows Serbian side of the war.  The  storytelling and the script itself is amazing, and so is the editing.  This  movie shows what life of the people on Balkans really is like.  These  people don't have a very happy life.  Their life is very unstable and those  people have been through everything.  This whole movie is made in  retrospective order.  There are about five time periods.  First time we  really see what war was really like in Bosnia.  This movie shows that there  was more to what happen in Bosnia than just a war.  This war was religious.  Racial or religious wars are the worst.  That's when one side rather  destroy it's enemy's religious institution than a warehouse full of  amunition.  This never should have happened in heart of Europe.  There's  already enough natural diseasters, why would we want any more fatal  attacks, especially from each other?  There's an old latin saying ""A  man is a wolf to a man"". Wars are one part of human life.  Whether the  reason is lack of space, food, or a religious intolerance.  In this case,  soldiers and common people weren't the reason why the war begun.  No one  wanted to be out on that fighting field and hold a gun in his hands while  the bullets are flying all over the place.  The people have been lied to,  and the soldiers were like small figures of on a chess field.  And those  who really are the reason why it all begun, will never pay the price.  Entire war in Bosnia was just a awful plan that got half carried out, and  more and more blood was spilled on sacred Bosnian soil, like it did for  centuries.  It was all a big mistake that keeps repeating every 50-100  years throughout history.  The worst part is, every other war is worst from  the previous one.

189832,5,1572523026,"Honestly ""Pretty willage, pretty flame"" is one of the best movies I ever saw.  It shows the most realistic picture of war in Bosnia, than in most other Bosnian movies.  It shows Serbian side of the war.  The  storytelling and the script itself is amazing, and so is the editing.  This  movie shows what life of the people on Balkans really is like.  These  people don't have a very happy life.  Their life is very unstable and those  people have been through everything.  This whole movie is made in  retrospective order.  There are about five time periods.  First time we  really see what war was really like in Bosnia.  This movie shows that there  was more to what happen in Bosnia than just a war.  This war was religious.  Racial or religious wars are the worst.  That's when one side rather  destroy it's enemy's religious institution than a warehouse full of  amunition.  This never should have happened in heart of Europe.  There's  already enough natural diseasters, why would we want any more fatal  attacks, especially from each other?  There's an old latin saying ""A  man is a wolf to a man"". Wars are one part of human life.  Whether the  reason is lack of space, food, or a religious intolerance.  In this case,  soldiers and common people weren't the reason why the war begun.

189833,5,1572523026,"Simply the great movie based on a true storey ,extremely realistic and extremely honest and non - prejudicial. I can say that because I`m  from there and I have felt many of horrors in former Yugoslavia ! Only someone  who is from that part of the world can really feel it !",946944000,6,274,4.25
189834,5,1572523026,"I saw this movie in every shape and form known, from a movie theater to VHS to DVD, and am amazed by it every time I watch it, again and again.  I am a Serb (from belgrade) and have not ever seen the war in Bosnia other  than through stories of friends who were there, but I well remember the  articles of newspapers about the group being captured at the tunnel.  This  is a real life story about the lives of two best friends.  They never hated  each other yet they were on opposite sides. that is exacly what the war  was.  people never hated ""the other side"".  Many never knew why  they were fighting, yet they died.  it is sad, and the movie shows the  objectively how cruel a war can be no matter who fights in it.  A must-see  for anyone who is interested in humanity and peace!",945993600,25,784,4.133333333333334
7797782,4,1572523026,"A good take on the Bosnian Civil War as a story evolves between two childhood friends: one Bosnian Serb and one Bosnian Muslim. As the two grow into adulthood and with the death of Tito in Yugoslavia, they take sides to their ethnic roots and end up fighting each other in their respective units and then finally meet up in the end. A significant movie by social standards as it was the first movie made inside the Balkans after the war that changed the lives of many, both sildier and civilian.",1397260800,,495,4.450549450549451

7797784,5,1572523026,"I'm a Bosnian Muslim but I truly feel this movie is pure gold. Although I disagree with some of the ideas that movie is trying to convince us, the movie is great. The acting, dialog and action is great. THE BAD PART IS THAT IT LOSES IN TRANSLATION. THE MOVIE IS TRAGI-COMEDY AND THE DIALOGUE IS GREAT BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TRANSLATE IT INTO ENGLISH. THAT'S WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WATCH IT AND APPRECIATE IT FOR HOW GOOD IT REALLY IS. SORRY FOR A LOT OF CAPS.",1195257600,2,490,4.223404255319149

7797786,2,1572523026,"Could have been better written, better acted, better photographed. Way too many flashbacks.

This whole thing is kind of a mess, really. Lacks cohesiveness.

Premise is interesting enough and a truly gifted director might have made a great film out of it.

The guy who directed this is no Akira Kurosawa, that's for sure.",1173571200,3,321,4.907407407407407
7797787,2,1572523026,"This flick has all the sophistication of a music video. It is basically an excuse for the director to show guys getting drunk and shooting off guns in a village in flames at night time, while Yugoslav rock music blares. The relationship between the Serb and Muslim boyhood-friends-turned-enemies should be the crux of the movie but it is never adequately explored.

It is no different than every other movie on the Bosnian war, with the exception of No Man's Land. It does not show the geopolitical situation of the time or the machinations of elites but rather assumes the bloodshed was the result of ancient or grassroots ethnic hatreds. Obviously there were ""ordinary"" Croatians, Serbians, and some Bosniacs involved in atrocities, but this is only part of the story.

I got the feeling that this is the kind of movie made by a director who spent the early 1990s in Germany.",1147996800,4,877,4.801324503311259

Yes, translation was a bit rough around the edges so I'm sure some verbal effects were lost, but I don't think it detracted from the movie. A little hard to watch. But truth is often not kind.",1147305600,4,318,4.145161290322581
7797789,5,1572523026,"One of my half Serb, half Croat friends recommended this movie to me.  This movie really paints a picture of life surrounding the 93-95 war.  It reinforced a lot which I learned when I was over there, after the war.  May be difficult for some in the West to fully understand.  It made Apocolypse Now look pretty tame.  There was nothing held back in this movie.  I recommend it to anyone interested in recent events in the Balkans.",1141862400,7,431,4.461538461538462

7797791,1,1572523026,"Most of those who were lucky enough to see this stunning Srdjan Dragojevic film at select film festivals in the U.S. have not forgotten its clarity, its anger, and its power.  The movie was passed up for theatrical distribution, although it was readily available on VHS and now on DVD from Fox Lorber.

This DVD is a bust in every thinkable way, although Fox Lorber was obviously aiming very low.  The phrase ""bare-bones"" is usually used to describe discs that are given rudimentary, dismissive releases, lacking supplements that more presumably marketable titles might warrant.  This DVD does contain a trailer, but the trailer, sadly, looks better than the feature.  ""Bare-bones"" would have been fine, but watching this disc is torture.

It's obviously a quickie transfer from the VHS -- I could have produced a better amateur transfer -- with a loud hiss tainting the soundtrack throughout, poor audio balance (with dialogue pulsing between speakers in an artificial echo) poor contrast, a muddy, dark image, burnt-in subtitles, and so forth.  Fox Lorber were long the scourge of the art-film DVD market, and their soulless neglect of their titles has never been more apparent than in this disc.  New Yorker and Wellspring (formerly Winstar) are guilty of similar offenses.",1119744000,6,1276,5.130434782608695
