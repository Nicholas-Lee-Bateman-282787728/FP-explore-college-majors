4447382,5,B004QLX0TM,"As a desensitized viewer, regular programming doesn't do it for me anymore. The minds that put these episodes together are on par with my own. As a native Georgian, I probably ""get it"" a little more than most non residents. If you enjoy sick, twisted, violent, idiotic, bizarre, hilarious humor...well then step right up and start being a Squidbilly. Early Cuyler for President!",1341619200,,378,5.015873015873016
4447383,5,B004QLX0TM,"this show is halarious. season 4 has 10 episodes, each 12 minutes long. this season, being the most recent, has lots of pop culture references.",1326758400,,143,4.76

4447385,5,B004QLX0TM,and Oh my jesus is it accurate. This is my favorite show and since it comes on so late it is nice to have it on DVD.,1320537600,3,116,3.3333333333333335
4447386,4,B004QLX0TM,"This is a hllarious show, but this volume only has 10 episodes.

Episode List:
The Many Loves of Early Cuyler
America: Why I Love Her
Dead Squid Walking
Young, Dumb, and Full of Gums
The Need for Weed
Holodeck Redneck
Frivolacious Squidigation
Fatal Distraction
Lean Green Touchdown Makifying Machine
Clowny Freaks

These episodes are just as good as all the other volumes, but I had to deduct a star because of the lack of episodes. If you're new to the show I'd reccomend volume 1 to learn some Cuyler history. If you're looking for a lot of laughs and a good value I'd get volume 2. Volumes 3 and 4 fall short on the number of episodes, so that's the only reason I'd prefer the others.

I'm a huge Squidbillies fan and would reccomned this show to anyone!",1320019200,2,758,4.478260869565218
4447387,5,B004QLX0TM,I used to hate this show. I lived in the north and I never got it.  I moved to Oklahoma and it has become my favorite show.  It takes place in the northern mountains of Georgia but I think everyone from the south can connect with it.  There is a much deeper humor that I now get and I am addicted to it! Read me the bible? I'll feed you the damn bible!,1319500800,,352,3.7945205479452055
4447388,5,B004QLX0TM,"Visited the good old USA last spring...was introduced to Squidbillies and never recovered! Tried to purchase over here in blighty but very hard to get hold of or silly money. Thanks to Amazon.com i ordered from America. Opted for longest delivery as didn't want to pay import duty to our robbing government but the items still arrived way ahead of expected date despite going to sweden enroute. Bought all 4 sets together(well why not,if your gonna do something why not go the whole hog,or in this case,squid ho ho)! This series just creases me up,dont know why it has never been released here...guess they think we won't understand it or the humour but they are wrong! I can relate to the characters and despite different accents i reckon ive met realife incarnations through my years! All that remains then is to say a huge thankya to Amazon and remember...DONT TOUCH THA TRIM!",1315353600,10,879,4.7894736842105265
