7729921,5,B01E0XL3FI,"I have not purchased the movie off of amazon YET. There are a few things to think about when debating on buying this movie. First off, there is no English dubbing. as a fan of anime shows (some not dubbed included) this is not a problem for me. Second, The first movie was not the best. The lore of Sun Wukong was changed as expected because it is a different version or retelling. However, the ending of the first one was rush and a few details like Ao Kuang and Erlang Shin weren't presented well in my opinion. The second movie was funny, action packed, and carried overall good character and story progression. I Loved the second movie. This is a must buy if you enjoy the lore of sun wukong (which i'm a fan of) or if you just enjoy a really really good action packed fantasy movie with demons, monks, and (how to put this spoiler free) ......boss battles. Either way MUST BUY literally.",1467676800,,892,4.379518072289157

7729923,4,B01E0XL3FI,"This film apparently takes place 500 years after the first film. The Monkey King is now played by Aaron Kwok and not Donnie Yen. Aaron played the Blue Demon in the first feature. Just go with it like the second Darrin in ""Bewitched.""

A monk is tasked by the Mercy Goddess to obtain Buddhist scriptures in the west (Tibet?). Along the way he frees the Monkey King and also gets the help of two other ""demons."" They are confronted by Lady White or White Bone Spirit, an evil demon along with her minions. The sets looked surreal, a product of CG generation. The special effects were good and the real reason to watch the film as the plot was simple and the ending was not what I expected.

The film contains a multitude of fights, looking like an RPG. There is also humor, the dialogue is mostly light with Chinese sayings or their derivatives sprinkled in. The film is 2 hours long and it does start to weigh on you.

Guide: No swearing or sex. The female demons look almost nude. They appear to be wearing a nude colored body suit with ornate decorations in the right places. Yes, they looked sexy.",1463875200,8,1099,4.430693069306931

7729942,5,B01E0XL3FI,"The best in the series in my opinion. Carries the legend forward and explores what only the poetry of the original probably ever has contained (at least in translation). Monkey is masterfully acted, and Gong Li is compelling as always. The writing is superb here, and this is what carries the upgraded special effects.

Truly a A+ production in all respects. This installment doesn't play down the more serious side of Journey to the West, and that is much of why I see it as the most balanced and loving interpretation from this series and in relation to all others on film to date.",1491004800,4,583,4.605769230769231

7729957,5,B01E0XL3FI,"If you watch this film after reading the old story or learning some historical backgrounds it's way more fun because your imaginations come alive before your eyes.

It's the mythological story of a journey to the west from Tang LI Dynasty (AD 618-907), known as one of the most powerful Chinese Empires unified by the northern riders. The Central Asian cities are well-depicted thanks to the 21st-century CG technology, and the action's quite impressive as well; whether or not you're interested in the region along with its culture and history at least your eyes are never betrayed in terms of amusement.

There are some who complain that this film's got no plot, and the lame ending disappoints them. If they are Christians Jesus Christ must be weeping in the Heaven. The message the director wanted to deliver at the end was the ultimate sacrifice of Tang Sanzang for the mankind just like the sacrifice of Jesus, but it is well-known that our nature tend to patronize and envy SUN Wugong's mighty power instead. The last scene's all about the stupid sacrifice, so yes, those who don't believe in Jesus' sacrifice for the mankind are to be disappointed as the movie ends.

Plus, if you're a Dragon Ball fan, you will find why TORIYAMA chose this story called Xiyouji (Journey to the West) of SUN Wugong (SON Goku in Japanese) for his epic story of Dragon Ball Series.",1485734400,,1370,4.772151898734177

7729962,1,B01E0XL3FI,"When renting, Amazon fails to mention the lack of English unless logging on to this page & scrolling down to the specific details, so unless you enjoy reading your movies....its a bust as once you begin even just one minute, no refunds.

7729963,1,B01E0XL3FI,This is the Cantonese version,1484438400,,29,5.0
7729964,4,B01E0XL3FI,"Just like the first installment, this movie is so bad that it's great! Fortunately they have more of a budget this time around and the quality of production is much better. For American audiences this might be worth watching after you take some LSD or something it's kind of fun to think that this is something that Asian audiences enjoy. I'm certain a lot gets lost in translation, but a lot of stereotypes jump right across the language and cultural barriers.
After being banished for causing havoc in heaven the Monkey King (which is a deity) is released from his imprisonment in order to journey with a Buddhist monk and get him safely to retrieve some sort of sacred scripts. Along the way they are joined by other charming characters such as a pig-faced dude and a blue one, which are also presumably deities. They encounter numberless of female demons along the way, and the Monkey King manages to kill a lot of people, fly around but then come to terms with the fact that the monk is an spiritual master. I think the message of the movie is that all forms of life are precious, but I'm not sure if that is the intended message because there are so many threads to follow. But it could be that the translation is bad and the story is not complete. But hey if you like this strange films, with strange vials and even more strange characters... Bingo!",1484438400,3,1356,4.516260162601626
7729965,5,B01E0XL3FI,"Great folks lord movie, great special effects, must see if you like Chinese folklore movie",1484438400,,90,5.066666666666666
7729966,4,B01E0XL3FI,"It's clear that the producers of this film went all-in on this effort; a wild ride full of over the top visuals, predictable deadpan Chinese humor, and some fine performances that stand toe-to-toe with the breathtaking special effects, even if some were a bit derivative (the vampire-like demons have been seen before in more than a few programs, most recently Penny Dreadful). This movie represents a triumph of CGI mastery coupled with the everlasting value of Chinese folklore.

The plot is somewhat superfluous and a bit confusing (in short, the Monkey King must guide a monk to find some Buddhist scriptures), but the performances are quite solid. Aaron Kwok mixes primate mimicry with martial arts skills and a touch of slapstick to play the titular role, while Gong Li suffuses sultry and sinister in her portrayal of Baigujiang (White Bone Spirit), the ""baddie"" of the film. It's rare that Gong gets to participate in martial arts movies, and it was nice to see her hold her own in the battle scenes. In a role made for ham-fisted scene chewing, Gong keeps things on the subtle side and added some depth to what might have been merely another entry into the well-trodden tale.

The finale is a jaw-dropping battle that had the three of us in amazement, no small task given how many ""epics"" like this permeate both American and Chinese cinema, and it's definitely worth at least one viewing, if not more. My only complaint is that the PPV version we watched had white subtitles and they breezed by too quickly at times, requiring some rewinds and freeze frames just to follow the plot. I'm not sure how the disc is, but I'll edit this review as needed. That said, it's clear that I'll be adding this to my collection soon.",1484352000,,1729,4.740863787375416

7729973,5,B01E0XL3FI,"I love studying the myths and mythologies of other cultures, therefore I always try to take in film adaptations of some of the more popular stories when I can.  One legend that has always enraptured me is that of Sun Wukong, or The Monkey King.  This Chinese folk tale is vividly adapted in 2014s THE MONKEY KING, and then continued in THE MONKEY KING 2.  Full of eye-popping special effects, hearty humor, and some crazy action, THE MONKEY KING 2 is one of those films youll want to watch several times over, just to make sure you don't miss anything.

There are so many things to like about THE MONKEY KING 2.  It is vastly entertaining, from both a story and character standpoint, and it is visually beautiful.  The CG is almost constant in every scene, but that helps add to the striking backdrops.  The characters are boisterous and offer a steady stream of humor and emotion.  Overall, this is a very satisfying film.

THE MONKEY KING 2 is shot well and greatly utilizes the HD concept of filmmaking.  I would love to see this in 4K Ultra, as Ill bet the vivid colors and imagery are mind-blowing.

The acting in the film is top notch, although I have to confess I miss Donnie Yen as the Monkey King; Im a huge fan of Yens work, therefore I always want to see him in any role he can get.  But, Aaron Kwok does a fine job as his replacement.  Im not familiar with Kwoks prior work, but I can see he has talent.

The story is lighthearted and fun, although it contains several life lessons that teach as well as entertain.  Im not sure how much of the plot is based on the actual mythology of the Monkey King, but from what I can gather, its quite a bit.  I like this aspect, as it seems to give more depth to the film as a whole.

The action in THE MONKEY KING 2 is fast-paced and intense, but again a lot of fun.  Theres plenty of wirework evident, but theres also loads of ground-based fighting as well.  The martial arts style used by Kwok in his role as the King seems to infuse a simian spirit, therefore it vividly stands out when he fights.

THE MONKEY KING 2 is a big win for me, and I highly recommend it.  Martial arts fantasy does not get much bolder or vibrant than this, and the payoff is a two-hour trek into enjoyment.  The film is available now, so check it out.",1483660800,,2283,4.2727272727272725

Though the story of 'journey to the west' is different, in this movie it looks like they borrowed a lot of concepts from the Ramayana : the monkey battling the dragon demon, the monkey putting a protective circle in the sand around the monk (lakshman rekha in ramayana), the demon assuming the form of a beautiful woman (surpanaka's disguise in ramayana), the distrust towards the monkey by others etc.

In India, the epic Ramayana has multiple versions. Though the Hindu versions are similar to each other, the versions of the story in other Indian religions like the one in Jainism (Jainism originated almost the same time as Buddhism in India and still survives) are different - where Sita is the sister of Lord Rama, in contrast to being his wife as per hindu tradition. There was likely a Buddhist version of the Ramayana too (the historical Buddha - Gautama Siddhartha - himself claimed direct descent/lineage from Lord Rama). During the invasions due to religious intolerance most of the Buddhist literature in India was destroyed - the massive library in Nalanda containing millions of manuscripts was supposed to have burnt for 6 months! Wonder if a Buddhist version of Ramayana survives in China and was the basis of this movie.",1531180800,,1658,4.960431654676259
