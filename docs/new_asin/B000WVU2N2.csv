8225814,5,B000WVU2N2,"Modo by Luxology is without doubt one of the best kept secrets out there. Once you get your mind wet with the interface, the ease of use, and the amazing results (totally friendly to first time users) you will wonder how you ever missed this one.
And the video and book by Dan are first rate productions (as is Modo) that make the introduction a wonderful experience.
That said as good as they are, they could have been better. I have found that the consistency of the videos somewhat irregular at best. The sound and coverage seems at times to be somewhat unplanned. Then again there are so many possibilities in direction it can seem difficult to choose. With a little practice you will find you will be exploring and discovering all of the many tools avaliable. Modo's interface is one that is clean and many of the layers of tools are just a click away. I would recommend anyone who is new to Modo to purchase both of these: the book and video tutorial. Also remember that Modo has extensive help within the program as well. Check it out. The results are stunning and Modo's physical enviroment and rendering engine is fast and gorgeous. You gotta get with the program....just wait and see what they have up their sleeves in the next year and months....Rumors are going to blow your 3D mind.",1218844800,,1295,4.562231759656652
