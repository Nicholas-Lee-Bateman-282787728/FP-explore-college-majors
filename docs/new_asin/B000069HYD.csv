1733061,2,B000069HYD,"""The sweetest thing"" is not the kind of movie I expected. The cast is great, but the plot is clueless. Cameron Diaz plays a woman who likes to go out with her friends and avoids all kinds of deep relationships with men. One day, she goes to a club and meets a nice guy, who is suddenly discarded by her, like all the others. When she is at home, she realizes he could be ""Mr. Right"" for her and she becomes obsessed with him. Then she travels with one of her friends to another city just to meet the guy again to see what happens.
The main problem with this movie is that the director wanted to create ""classical"" scenes to be remembered, like the one in ""when harry met sally"", in which meg ryan fakes an orgasm in the middle of a restaurant. In the case of ""The sweetest thing""  the girls sing a song about penis inside a restaurant (the comparison is inevitable!).
Besides that, all you can see is a bunch of unrealistic scenes about some women pretending to be independent. It's a pitty, because this film had all the necessary elements to be a blockbuster movie.",1029715200,9,1067,4.335
1733062,1,B000069HYD,"With such big names in the cast, you'd have thought that this movie would have been great. And, I am a Cameron Diaz fan. The first mistake was casting a group of actors pushing thirty and have them try to act in a role with situations more accommodating a high school senior. My 20 year old daughter even thought they were trying to play a younger part, being older, and it didn't work. Secondly, the scenes are predictable and not very funny either. If you saw the previews for this movie on TV, then you saw the best parts. Thirdly, I really enjoyed American Pie (both), and this isn't even in the same galaxy, much less ballpark. It was difficult to finish watching this movie.",1029196800,6,680,4.448
1733063,2,B000069HYD,"I saw this during its theatrical run. Great casting. It was especially cool to see Jason Bateman, but it didn't deliver. I would recommend this if you like American Pie, you know, gross out humor with a heart, otherwise steer clear of this one. At the screening I went to everybody seemed to enjoy it, so I could be wrong. One more thing, Parker Posey was seriously underused here, and Diaz & Applegate had great chemistry. Couldn't save this movie though.",1026691200,4,456,4.6419753086419755
1733064,5,B000069HYD,ok i saw this in theaters but cant wait to own the dvd. this is so funny and cameron diaz is da hottest actress ever. not only that but it was a cute movie. now with the r rating. it was for one scene and the scene was funny. it had to deal with selma getting involved in this little piercing incident with a guy.  overall this was a great movie. it was so funny.  rent or buy when it comesout on dvd. i cant stop imagining the special features.,1024185600,,445,3.933333333333333
1733095,2,B000069HYD,"This film is so cheerfully vapid and filled with mindless platitudes, it's a good thing everyone is so good looking and well-dressed. You get the feeling someone was directing a car commercial or a music video, and they had a few days left over of sound studios and models they had already paid for, so they threw this together. The acting is so nonexistent they might be lip-syncing it all, except that I can't believe someone actually sat down and wrote this script on paper. In 50 years, when film history courses talk about the hurdles of women in Hollywood--hopefully overcome by then--this movie will be an example of the ditzy little box Hollywood puts female actors, even talented ones like Cameron Diaz, who provides some syrupy salvation for this film, though at times she seems to be impersonating Meg Ryan, in one of Ryan's lesser roles.",1513900800,,849,4.782312925170068

I wish I had known before I paid for it. I figured that since it was rated R that scene would be included. From reading the reviews I guess I'm just one of many that have made this mistake.

1733269,4,B000069HYD,"I liked it, it kind of started with a Something About Mary type vibe.  Obviously this is a female character lead film, the males are all minor characters in this one, as a male sometimes this sort of film can have not much to offer or keep me watching but that's not the case here.  The two main characters played by Diaz and Applegate along with their sometimes sidekick, Selma Blair, who has her own separate storyline happening throughout the film are all extremely likable.  A lot of Hollywood films have the women as the victim of a man who doesn't want to settle down and the man who just wants to be single, sleeping with various women just for the fun of it, The Sweetest Thing turns those tables on its head, with this time round the story beginning with three women living that lifestyle and a heap of men upset and angry when they said they'd call them, or gave them fake numbers left in their wake.  Of course when one, (Diaz's character) flirts with a guy in nightclub the next day she suddenly thinks she might want to stop playing the game and he might be the one, so sets off with Applegate's character to crash a wedding in a town a few hours away that he mentioned he was attending.

1733384,5,B000069HYD,"So, this movie clearly isn't for everyone. But I love it! I just was watching it the other night(edited, way less funny) which made me think of it and realized I need to own it. Every time it's on I watch it. I probably shouldn't be giving a review of the DVD before watching it but I saw how many negative reviews it was getting and had to throw in my two cents. I REALLY hope my favorite scene in the movie hasn't been cut from this version b/c the first time I saw it(possibly rented from Blockbuster, that's how long it's been), it was there & I was laughing so hard I was crying! But then every time I've seen it since, that scene has been missing(it's basically a scene where they just break into a crazy musical number for absolutely no reason and I remember on the original video it was called ""The Penis Song""). So here's the thing about the movie., it's almost meant to be bad(I think) or at the very least it REALLY doesn't take itself seriously. It's meant to be over the top, vulgar, & ridiculous. In a way, I guess for it's time it was meant to be a sort of ""Bridesmaids"" movie. A ""chic flick"" that wasn't really a chic flick, it's more like, hey guess what ""guys""? Girls can act like ""guys"" too and be players, act vulgar, etc. But don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's anywhere near in the same league as ""Bridesmaids"". It's much more absurdist comedy which is exactly what I love about it. I would say ""it's so bad, it's good"" but that's the thing, I don't think it's meant to be ""good"". I feel like it's winking at itself lol. Like at the end during/after the credits Cameron Diaz does this whole thing where she's basically making fun of herself in the movie. And it's funny. That's my story and I'm sticking to it!",1418688000,,1736,4.263636363636364

1733593,4,B000069HYD,"This movie takes me back! I first watched it back in circa 2003-- my junior year of high school-- when my best friend and I used to have movie marathons at each other's houses for hours on end. This was one of our favorites, and even today, it still makes me laugh until my sides hurt. I was so excited that it was available for instant play rental; it was like a trip down memory lane.

Part of the reason I enjoyed this movie so much is that it isn't a typical ""chick flick."" The women are independent, aggressive, and unafraid to express their sexuality. They go out and hook up with men just for the sake of ""fun,"" not concerned with finding ""true love"" or becoming too attached. In other words, these women are doing what has always been socially acceptable for men to do. I think that this is why the film did not sit so well with some people: because I think American society is still hesitant to embrace a sexually autonomous woman who is out for ""Mr. Right Now"" as opposed to ""Mr. Right.""

At the same time, though, the film also reaches a ""middle ground"" between sexually aggressive independent women and hopeless romantic women with dreams of settling down. [SPOILER ALERT!] The women eventually admit that while they enjoy going out and having fun with no strings attached, it is also nice to settle down once they find a good guy that they can truly love. That is another reason why I like this movie: because while these women don't necessarily conform to traditional expectations of women's proper sexual behavior, they also acknowledge that there is nothing wrong with settling down. I think that this is realistic and reasonable for most women who value their sexual independence, but at the same time are open to the possibility of finding true love with that one person who can complete them.

Is this is the most amazing, profound, thought-provoking film ever made? No, definitely not. But that does not change the fact that it is a very fun and funny movie that is perfect for a night in with the girls. Seriously, just put on your pajamas, mix some margaritas, order a pizza, and have a girl's night with it. Make a drinking game out of it. Quote the dialogue and sing along with the ""Penis Song."" Stop taking life seriously for the night and just have fun. In my opinion, that is what this movie is really all about. It may not be worthy of an academy award, but that doesn't mean that you can't have fun with it.",1337385600,,2436,4.494356659142213
1733594,4,B000069HYD,"I like Cameron Diaz because she's so silly and goofy - like a sixteen year old. She's the ""Woooh"" girl as she's fond of dancing like a mad woman in public and going woooh! Check out The Mask and Charlie's Angels (both instalments).

The best part of The Sweetest Thing is quite like My Best Friend's Wedding. Diaz and company launch into a song and dance celebrating of all things - the oversized male organ. I always thought women are as fond of 'that thing' as they would an assault rifle.

The Sweetest Thing is a curious mixture of a romantic comedy incorporating a road trip, chick bonding, frat boy humour and plenty of sex gags. Not to mention very robust performances from the support cast of Christina Applegate, Thomas Jane and Parker Posey.

Selma Blair is an excellent choice as Jane, who seems to get caught in all kinds of embarrassing sex situations and has to live through them in full public view.

The Sweetest Thing worked for me because I like stuff like My Best Friend's Wedding and Scary Movie. This film strikes the right balance between the two  with cross appeal to both sexes. Great for stay in Saturday nights!",1335052800,,1137,4.58128078817734
1733595,1,B000069HYD,"We are struggling to find the words to express our opinion of this (sorry, was desperately trying to avoid using ""body function"" terms but can't) pile of vomit. We can possibly forgive Selma and Christina for deciding to participate in this putrid little movie; they would hardly have been choosing between appearing in this and say, ""Iron Lady"" or ""Sophie's Choice"", but surely Cameron ""Never met a script I didn't like"" Diaz could have found something, ANYTHING to appear in rather than this. Filmed in glorious Skankovision, the, ahem, storyline revolves around three fun-lovin' gals (if your idea of fun is composing songs about genitalia; kudos to Rogers and Hammerstein or perhaps Cole Porter for modestly not taking credit for this particular little ditty) who are travelling from San Francisco to, oh I can't remember where but it involves the crudest and most unfunny antics since anything starring The Wayans Family. Couple this with a horribly unfunny montage scene (count the cliches) and a cavalcade of scenes involving various toilets (credit where credit is due; some of the toilets gave beautifully crafted performances!) and there you have it. If we haven't at this point expressed it clearly enough: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. Do not watch it thinking it might be a bit of escapist fun, do not watch it thinking it might be so bad it's good, do not watch it with green eggs and ham and most definitely do not watch it with, well, anyone. We would rather watch a non-stop loop of all the Rosie O'Donnell scenes from ""Sleepless in Seattle"" than ever watch this again.

1733613,3,B000069HYD,"The Sweetest Thing is a flawed attempt at a romance comedy with insanely inappropriate sexual-related segments interweaved throughout the storyline. When I say inappropriate, I mean these particular scenes should be watched by absolutely *nobody*.

I don't quite understand the inclusion of such inappropriateness either. It's not like the target audience here (young women) would find these kind of scenes funny. At least I'd HOPE not, because mainly only men find such crude humor effective and worth watching for some cheap laughs.

So under NO circumstance should a child be watching the Sweetest Thing. I won't exactly explain these highly offensive parts of the movie, I'll just say one of them involves a woman stuck in a certain position with lots of people watching and trying to help free her, and another segment deals with a woman taking a dress to the cleaners which again deals with a young woman being forced into a situation she has no control over, or escape from.

The actual romantic portion of the film is quite underwhelmingly predictable as well, so... alright, I *did* find the offensive parts hilarious, but women and children should most definitely not be viewing them.

Christina Applegate is beautiful like always, but the movie needed actual substance and a less predictable storyline to really save it. It's alright though, so I'll be generous and give it 3 stars out of 5.",1304899200,,1402,5.030172413793103

Perhaps the most unnerving thing about it is the attitudes presented by the female characters, that bumping nasties with strangers you meet in bars is something to keep you occupied until you finally find ""the one.""  What a terrible message for young women.  What a terrible message for men.  That the film ended with a ""true love"" situation was perhaps the most unrealistic aspect of the film.  In the real world, the hunky male character would have boinked Christina (Diaz) and called it a day.  But he sure wouldn't have married a woman who acted like a stoned 15-year-old!",1221782400,13,761,4.815384615384615

 There are ""Hey! That's like US"" moments all throughout the movie (yes, us girls do talk about guys' sizes and last night. . .). Even w/all the raunchy  humor, the underlining message in the end can be that one can take a chance w/love and have a huge payoff (something to look forward to!).

Casting these three lovely ladies in this film was a smart move.  The handsome Jason Bateman's rising star is in here too!

Like most people, I am really picky when it comes to comedies.  I will see almost any sci-fi flick but when it comes to comedies, I'm about as picky as you get.

I personally think Christina Applegate stole this film from Cameron Diaz.  Why Christina Applegate is not in more movies, I will never know, she is down right h-i-l-a-r-i-o-u-s.  The road trip and bathroom scenes are worth at least a passing viewing alone.  Not to mention the church scene and the last scene of the movie.

Selma Blair gets her typical role as the naive young lady who always seems to get caught in the most compromising and precarious positions.  Cameron is as funny as always.

Well, were we in for a big surprise! The humor throughout was truly raunchy, ribald, and raw. It was also, at times, quite funny. If you are a fan of the Farrelly Brothers movies or enjoy crude comedies, then you may enjoy this. Instead of the guys being gross, however, it's the gals.

This movie revolves around three gal pals, Christina (Cameron Diaz), Courtney (Christine Applegate), and Jane (Selma Blair) and their close encounters with the male kind. The guys, however, definitely take a back seat to these three twenty something misses. I confess, it was a bit startling, though funny, to see these gals break into a song fit for a drunken stag party. Some of the scenes were done tongue and cheek. Check out the Dick and Jane scene. You will know the scene I mean, when you see it.

This film is not for those with delicate sensibilities, as erect male sex organs, anal sex, oral copulation, and other usually taboo subjects are ripe for gags, many of which, while filthy, are often funny. If you do not like your jokes down and dirty, then this is not the film for you. If you are broader minded, then you may enjoy Nancy Pimental's screenplay and the silly cavorting of the delightful Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate, and Selma Blair, once you get over your initial shock.",1148947200,,1445,4.575289575289576

1733719,2,B000069HYD,"This is one of those bizarre films that spends a lot of time being mildly amusing, then outrageously funny, and then utterly jaw-dropping dumb. And underneath it all, there's a kind of ugliness. There's something ugly about a guy getting a nose-bleed as he talks about Christina (Cameron Diaz). The drunken dance-floor scenes were nauseating. It's been said that this movie gives girls a chance to be just like the guys. Fine, but if being libido-driven, alcohol soaked, and st-o-o-o-o-pid is something for young women to strive for... well, I dunno.

Some reviewers have said that this movie might have been better off if it had been taken out of director Roger Kumble's hands and given over to the Farrelly Brothers. Ugh. Given the Farrelly Bros. fixation on bodily functions and handicapped people, I somehow doubt it. Actually, Kumble should be given credit for making the best out of a handicapped script.

There's one particular scene that even Kumble couldn't save: the infamous bathroom scene. Watching Christina Applegate attempt to clean herself off on a urinal which bursts with water was funny enough. But the whole concept of a boy waiting all day for a woman to peek through a hole (in a MEN'S ROOM, no less) really strained credulity. Diaz' Christina's gullibility is beyond belief.

However, there were some truly hilarious scenes and cameos. Georgia Engel was perfect as an overworked, behind-the-times dress shop owner. And, in an almost throw-away role, Parker Posey was brilliant as a nervous bride who doesn't take too much convincing to drop her wedding plans.

I never even finished watching it; this piece of garbage was immediately donated back to the thrift store. The talented, well-known actresses were wasted with this crude, vulgar, amateurish, formulaic script. This could have been a delightful romantic comedy but instead you get a horrid little movie that vacillates between a romantic comedy and frat-boy vulgarity. The writers tried hard to imitate the Farrelly Brothers and failed--even the most crude scenes in the Farrelly films fit the story and were very funny. For ""The Sweetest Thing"", the raunchy scenes had no point, led to nowhere, and were obviously thrown in for the hormone-crazed teenage boy demographic. I can't believe this script was even made into a film. What MORON in Hollywood thought this film would be GOOD???? This is evidence that a crappy movie is not gender specific--the WOMAN who wrote this script should be shot, as she presents her female characters as the stereotypical empty-headed, horny bimbos that flourish in those bachelor party/porno flicks. This is not a chick flick by any means; the woman writer had NO respect for her characters or for her target audience, which I assume was SUPPOSED to be women. Applegate, Blair, and Diaz are way too talented for such an awful movie, and I wonder what they and their agents were thinking when they consented to star in this raunchfest in the first place. If you edit out the vulgar scenes, you have the beginnings of a funny, contemporary romantic comedy, but the writer and director failed to see that and instead goes for the cheap, moronic laughs with crude sexual content and gross-out humor that's not even funny. I'll bet Diaz, Blair, and Applegate cringe whenever they see or hear any (if at all) references to this lousy film; they are probably wishing it would disappear altogether, because being in this film was an embarrassment and one of the low points in their careers. This movie isn't even bad enough to reach cult status, like the horrendous, so-bad-it's-funny movie ""Showgirls.""

Frequently hilarious and surprisingly unsentimental in its views of modern romance and sexuality.  The opportunity to admire the three very attractive leads (who, by the way, throw themselves completely into their roles and are completely fearless of looking completly silly and/or putting themselves into totally humiliating circumstances) doesn't hurt matters either.  Those who hate this movie are clearly missing the point.  Of course, movies in this genre are easy targets for such critics.

1733726,1,B000069HYD,"I have seen more than my fair share of bad movies during my movie watching existence. While a lot of them are so bad that they are actually funny (in a purely unintentional way of course), there have also been quite a few cinematic turkeys I've seen that are just plain bad without any redeeming qualities to be found. The Sweetest Thing falls into the latter category.

On paper, the formula for this one might have looked like that it would have had some potential to be somewhat decent. You have bona-fide sex appeal in the form of 3 truly beautiful women: luscious blond Christina Applegate (who hasn't had hardly any sort of a career since her Married with Children heyday), underrated bruentte Selma Blair (who turned in a brave and daring performance in Todd Sollondz's controversial film Storytelling) and the always gorgeous (at least IMO) Cameron Diaz (who though need to put back on some weight at the time this film was made.) The script was written by Nancy Pimental who is a writer on the hit animated show South Park.

But the end result turned out being of the worst movies of 2002 (if not the worst). The movie's biggest problem is its schizophrenic nature of being an in-your-face gross out comedy one minute while making a u-turn and being a sickeningly sweet romantic comedy the next.

The basic plot involves 3 friends Christina, Courtney and Jane (Diaz, Applegate and Blair respectively) who are 3 young women living in upscale New York City. They basically live a life of working during the week and then heading out to the clubs on the weekends where they use their beautiful allure/charm to have flings with guys as to where there's no commitment involved. But Jane has just gotten dumped by a guy that she was convinced was the one, and to ease her sorrows, they take her out to their favorite club to dance her woes away. But Christina meets a guy by the name of Peter that night (Thomas Jane) who she immediately clicks with and falls head-over-heels in love with him almost right away. She never does make her move though and ends up going home regretting that she didn't tell him how much he knocked her off her feet. Courtney tells her that she ought to try to track him down and they end up finding out that he's left town to go to a wedding. So, Courtney and Christina decide to take an impromptu road trip while Jane stays behind with some new stud that she ends up meeting.

To be honest, the movie just went steadily downhill from the get go. Even the sight of Cameron Diaz shaking her fine butt while walking up her street can't disguise the fact of how poorly executed and written this movie it. But once the road-trip section starts things get even worse as the filmmakers began to throw in some gross-out gags that are poorly staged and headache inducing instead of being funny. I will admit that the 3 leads are giving it their all, but the script is so bad that no amount of effort can make it good.

Some of the ""gags"" we get subjected to involve Christina getting poked in the eye (take a wild guess by what) while investigating a hole in a bathroom wall at a run down rest stop. There's also an awful scene where Jane gets stuck in a most bizarre fashion while giving her boyfriend oral sex that is just groan inducing instead of funny. In addition to that there is some rotten food in the back of Courtney's station wagon that is flung out the window and ends up splattering on the windshield. I also almost forgot to mention an especially annoying (and migraine inducing) musical section where a whole resturaunt breaks out into a song about the many virtues of the penis.

And don't even get me started on the whole ""movie-montage"" bit where Christina Applegate and Cameron Diaz try on different outfits to a really annoying song while mugging for all their worth. It goes on for far too long and might eventually be proven to cause seizures. I will admit that the sight of Cameron Diaz standing in front of a mirror in her underwear grabbing her own breasts was most pleasant, but even that is not worth the effort of sitting through this cinematic atrocity.

A lot of critics put most of the blame on the director Roger Kumble who up until this point was only known for another piece of crap called Cruel Intentions. While his lackluster and clueless direction is a big problem in and of itself, the biggest problem is that the script is just plain terrible and contrived in the most headache inducing sense. I will admit that for fans of the 3 lead actresses, they do look quite gorgeous throughout this mess (especially Diaz) but it's just not worth subjecting yourself to the movie itself.

The movie thankfully tanked at the box-office despite being hyped with one of the most aggressive ad-campaigns that I've seen in quite some time. But that didn't stop Columbia-Tristar from releasing a deluxe special edition DVD for it anyway.

There were 2 versions of this movie released seperately: the 84 minute R-rated theatrical cut and a 90 minute unrated version that contains footage ""too sexy for theaters"" according to the front of the DVD box. From what I gathered, the whole penis-musical number wasn't in the theatrical cut and I would guess that the unrated version is basically the much raunchier of the 2 in terms of how much further the off-color humor goes.

The movie itself is presented in it's original ""matted"" 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format and there is the obligatory commentary track featuring the stars and the director but they spend most of their time just cracking jokes and sucking on a helium tank making their voices high-pitched. They seem to almost be ignoring the movie for most of it, and rightfully so, it's awful. There's also some sort of a mock-documentary about the writer called ""A Day in the Life of Nancy M. Pimental"" (who I should add is quite attractive) and how her everyday life supposedly functions. There's the usual behind-the-scene featurette called ""Politically Erect"" which is basically just a big infomercial for the film. I was also surprised that there's something like 20 or so trailers for other movies on here as well.

But no amount of extras on the DVD will cover up how truly atrocious this movie is. I have seen some awful movies in my time, but The Sweetest Thing easily ranks among the worst.

However, if you were hoping for an actual plot and some possible intelligent dialog, just get off the train before you waste your eyesight.

Diaz does her normal schtick being a goofy dolt--has she ever heard the word brain?--and she and what's-her-name basically seem to spend the whole time comparing underwear and doing various contortions in a car. Yeah, that's what I call comedy! It might have been more watchable if they'd picked some attractive actresses, but these two hatracks have all the sex appeal of Jerry Lewis.

As a woman, I was too bored to be offended, and if I was a man, I'd feel ripped off thinking I was gonna get a little T&A and instead getting bare ribs and bony heifer butts. Either way, don't bother. If I could give this -5 stars, I would. And that's putting it mildly. Hoooo boy!",1114214400,11,1215,4.6157407407407405
1733742,1,B000069HYD,"So I heard this movie was horrible and ignored the warnings. Wanting to give the movie some credit, I thought to myself ""How bad could it be?"" and watched it anyway. It was so bad that I:

1) tried adjusting the settings on my tv during the first 15 minutes; these girls just can't be that skinny, can they? Instead of finding them attractive (as the filmmakers are insisting I do), I get this incredible mother's urge to feed these poor creatures

2) turned it off(see #4) when the 3 main characters started comparing my penis to a cadillac; I felt so man-handled and objectified...

3) kept looking at my watch and thinking that being eaten alive by pirhanas from the waist down would surely beat having to watch this movie in its entirety

4) cried myself into fetal position until my wife came over and asked me if she should turn it off

5) watched ""Phantom Menace"" after this and actually though it a was very good film;

6) lost a lot of respect for Selma Blair, even if she was in ""Hellboy""; I lost respect for Applegate a long time ago and as for Diaz, respect was never there, sorry

7) started to think Paris Hilton could have done a lot better acting in any one of these roles...

The bottom line: If I could give it 0 stars, I would. Once you watch it, you can't forget it; it's like walking in on your parents while they're being frisky. So, if that's the kind of feeling you enjoy, then by all means go right ahead.",1111795200,11,1430,4.309701492537314

I think this was an absolutely fantastic film and right up my street, if your a young single female who's had guys troubles in the past and tend to stick with your girlys, trust me this film is for you, you will totally relate to it and if you are not in stitches by the end of it i suggest a sense of humour transplant.

I wasn't sure what we were watching when we put it on as i didn't read the blurb on the back but i've never laughed so much in my whole life. This film is about women! it's about being independant and trying to find true love, it's about love disasters and hillarious situations that maybe not all of us have been in, but well....this film was brilliant and i've recommended it to all my girl friends.

1733778,2,B000069HYD,"I have no doubt that there is a story here, but the flow of this movie doesn't really want to let the story come out.  The basic premise is two people find each other when they least expect it.  In this comedy, the story is driven by one character's quest to find this love before it is too late.  Hijinks ensue.

What can go wrong with this?  Comedy is largely driven by the seemingly unconnected episodes of our lives, but in this movie, the unconnected episodes just seem to distract.  How does a song-and-dance number fit in?  An unfortunate incident with the braces also seems out of place as it doesn't seem to drive the story at all.  Selma Blair is a good actress, but her role in this film doesn't seem to mesh with the others.

There are some funny moments, but they are few and far between.  I would not recommend seeing this movie.  The story doesn't connect with the audience at all.",1106006400,,896,4.36969696969697

The next day, she just discovered that Peter was gone and the story  went as a wild goose chase in a 31/2 hour road trip with her friend (Applegate) to look for Mr .Right who they eventually found out he was going to get married.  Heart broken Cristina went home.  Peter during the wedding ceremony found out that he too had feelings for the ""hottie"" and the wedding was off.  The story concluded with the anticipated ending.

This DVD was a waste of time.  It was one of Diaz's worst movies.  She and her friends acted like high school girls considering that they were already working.  [...] Being wet in that sleazy restroom after they destroyed the pipings of the urinal they decided to remove their clothes off and drive in their undies.  It tried hard to create laughs but it really just wanted to show some flesh to add to the DVD's claim:  ""sexy never before seen footages"" .  Although the lesbian ""scene"" where Diaz was looking for her lipstick in the floor while Applegate was driving which caused the accident of the biker boy had given me some laughs.  IMHO, Diaz was miscasted.  This movie was revealing... yes revealed a lot of Diaz's straight non-curvaceous body and her small boobs.  They should have replaced her with a dumb blonde with a more voluptuous body if this was a sexy comedy movie.  She also had some really bad close up shots which made me think how could this actress be as irresistible in her previous movie ""There's Something About Mary"".

All the while the movie developed that the brother was getting married and all conversations at the driving range pointed to that until the last moment at church revealing Peter getting married (?)  Heeellllloooooo!!!

Just showed that girls can be really desperate and brainless when emotions take over.  They can go to the extent of going to wild escapades without really thinking of consequences.  What's worse, someone is there to accompany them in this non-sensical caper.  Duhhhh...

This happens to be one of the first female movies w/ outstanding laughs! I have read some other reviews...to put it bluntly ,most were idiotic! Especially the women who said this movie was stupid & a insult to women. Most great comedies feature actors & headiners  such as Richard Pryor,Jim Carrey,Adam Sandler,Ben Stiller & Rob Schiender. All of the

 mainstream men's comedies consist of off beat,slap stick,vulger

jokes. All which we consider funny. What about the scene in Something about Mary where Ben Stiller is in the bathroon as an adult waiting for Cameron Diaz (Mary) to show up & he opens the door w/ a suprise hanging from his earlobe,which Mary assumes it is hair gel & uses?

 Most people love that scene in the movie & the movie itself. It is about time for women to get in on the laughs!

 Christina(Cameron Diaz) & Courtney (Christina Applegate)are at their best & funny as ever! If you want a real females perspective W/Alot of laughs check out THE SWEETEST THING!The movie begins in San Francisco. Where two women friends(Courtney&Christina)leave work & stop at Christina apartment to fine Christinas roomate Jane(selma Blair)crying because,her boyfriend dumped her. Christina & Courntey proceed to make Jane's woah's into a WOW by taking her to the hot night club in the city to dance & get her mind off of the rejection of being dumped. Dancing the night away Christina meets the man of her dreams but, doesnt want to give of the game,Afraid of being hurt. The night unfolds for all three women with laughter beyond capacity & fun.

1733816,1,B000069HYD,"I feel compelled to write a review for this unspeakably awful offense on humankind, especially after reading four and five star reviews of it. If this has come to be quality entertainment in this country then we have sunk lower than my worst fears. It's not the crude humor - I like everything from South Park to Old School. It's the unbelievably awful screenwriting and tired, hackneyed humor that permeates this 90-minute disaster, most of which leaves you in a stunned embarrassed silence.
Who is this film supposed to be for? Women? I surely hope not. Most women I know do not enjoy seeing their gender portrayed as the brainless, horny airheads that populate this debacle. Is it for men? Dear God no. I think I speak for all of us when I say that men do not enjoy watching attractive women act like twelve-year-old boys. Is it for kids? Absolutely not, given the sexual lewdness throughout. There's nothing wrong with sexual lewdness in itself, as long as it has a morsel of comedic value and possibly contributes to the plot or characters in at least an indirect way.
But with ""The Sweetest Thing"" discussing things like plot and characters is like arguing about the arrangement of the deck chairs on the Titanic. Instead, let's discuss the film on it's own level, something that would make sense within it's context and to the cinematic connoisseurs that seemed to enjoy it - we'll just play a simple game.
The rules are simple, and the first two are the hardest - you have to watch at least fifteen minutes of it, and you have to get someone else to do it with you. There. The rest is all downhill. Just count the number of times each of you says one of the following: ""Oh my God,"" ""How did this get made?"", ""Did the actors read the script before they agreed?"", ""*Was* there a script?"", ""How do big stars do movies like this?"", ""I feel insulted,"" ""Do people really think women act like this in private?"" and lastly, ""This may be the worst movie I've ever seen, definitely top five.""

It just doesn't work and they try to throw in so many wild scenes that it just pulls you out of the movie.

1733842,3,B000069HYD,"""The Sweetest Thing"" is one of those movies that has a plot, but doesn't really need one because it relys on raunchy humor, sexual stereotypes and a little silliness to entertain its viewers.  That isn't a bad thing.  This was a very funny film that gave the girls a chance to do to the boys what the boys usually do to them in the movies.  Cameron Diaz and Christina Applegate turn in solid performances.  Selma Blair and Thomas Jane also do a fine job.
I won't get into any deep discussion of a plot with this movie because it's nothing but fun.  Watch it only to laugh.  Sometimes it does get a little too silly.  Perhaps I'm a little bit uptight, but I felt that the ""movie montage"" sequence went a little bit long.  Other than that, this movie is full of laugh-out-loud fun.  Jason Bateman's rendering of ""Eternal Flame"" is of near-classic status.
Three stars isn't a bad rating in my book.  I just don't feel justified in giving more than three stars for the simple fact that this movie does get a little out of whack at times and it doesn't really have any stand out quality to it.  It's a slightly above average comedy that relies on potty, sophomoric humor.  Don't get me wrong, potty, sophomoric humor is really good when executed correctly.  I just think that this particular film tried a little too hard at times to be funny.

This is the one of the rauchiest, absolutely DIRTIEST movies I have ever seen, and I love it!  It's like American Pie except even better, because the main characters are these gorgeous women out to tear down the house.
The humour is PERFECT; the director really knows exactly how far to push things for maximum comedic effect.  And, unlike movies like ""Not Another Teen Movie"" (which was great, but really went too far at times) this movie is consistently funny in a raunchy way, but never ""funny in a disgusting"" way.  The gags are very clever, and would almost be ""elegantly"" written if they weren't so lewd.  I think this is a great movie for both guys and girls, as long as you're cool with some bawdy good fun.  The female audience will appreciate the girl power undertone, whilst guys will love all the dirty situations these very hot women get into.
And my sweetheart Selma is fantastic, even better than she was in Cruel Intentions.  She's...""hilariously sexy"", I guess is how I would describe her.  Just delectable.  Cameron Diaz and Christina Applegate are also a riot.

1733866,4,B000069HYD,"From the beginning you get a glimpse of what the movie is going to be like. I really liked how truthful the female characters are portrayed in this movie.  I really liked how they portrayed the dating and club scence, it is so honest of how it is out there. I thought it was so funny and have to admit in the unrated version with two particular scences one of them being a musical number and the other with Selma Blair being literally stuck in a comprimising position was a little too silly but somehow works when the whole movie is seen throughout. It's the humor and unpredictable moments and great chemistry among the three actresses Cameron, Christina and Selma that make this movie work. I liked that they showed their main characters as sexy, smart, beautiful but flawed all at the same time. Towards the ending is a truth in what Christina's character has to say about getting tired of the dating sense when all your really looking for is a connection with someone special.  Kudos to especially Cameron and Christina in their hilarious performances and not being afraid to be silly and blunt.",1070409600,,1099,4.630769230769231

1733868,5,B000069HYD,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE. The best thing about it is that it's true true true.  Anyone who spend every weekend clubbing has to know how true this movie is. The games we have to play. The built in support we become to each other. This movie is basiclly the up and downs of dating or the lack their of in your 20's and the point you get when you want to stop playing the ""game"" The only question is how do you stop playing the game and not get burned? This movie is the funniest road trip to that answer.",1068422400,,495,3.95
1733869,3,B000069HYD,"There's something about Cameron Diaz. This is the 2nd entry in an unofficial trilogy of critic-proof comedies that the lovely thespian with the elastic smile stars in and unabashedly reveals herself to be an unnaturally uninhibited pop actress. In the first Charlie's Angels movie, she shaked her booty to the posterior anthem, ""Baby Got Back,"" even though her butt isn't exactly of the same proportions that Sir-Mix-A-Lot is speaking of. And of all places, the scene is set at Soul Train, which is filled with the sort of curvaceous babes (mostly Black) that SMAL is madly in love with. And this is exactly what I love about Diaz. She is willing to poke fun at her lack their of (and probably of other Hollywood actress' thinner lower torsos) and look totally, genuinely ecstatic in the process; you never, ever, get the feeling that Diaz is doing anything against her will.
While Diaz does nothing here that's quite as show stopping as that classic moment, there is - wait a minute, actually, there is this one scene. Diaz, along with Christina Applegate and Selma Blair, perform a raunchy, wonderfully spontaneous (nearly all of the comical set-pieces are unpredictable) mini musical inside of a busy restaurant that you can only see if you view the Unrated version. This is the sort of scene one would most certainly find in a musical version of Sex and the City, which this film sort of resembles (minus the three-dimensional characterizations, pathos, and the occasionally annoying narration). Or you could think of TST as the Farrelly Brothers' version of SAC (this film sort of one-ups Ben Stiller's zipper accident).
While the movie's cast is mostly filled with women (beautiful women), there's not much of anything about it that men might find too girlish to bare. Unlike your standard Julia Roberts chick-flick, the movie mostly poses a cynical attitude towards the idea of monogamous relationships (although it doesn't totally doubt the possibility of its existence; the script's pessimistic female characters are only thinking like inconsiderate, self-centered men as a last resort anyway). There's more skin bearing from the women than from the men, too. And the jokes are frank enough to keep the attention of teenage boys whenever the female cast aren't drop dead gorgeous in their skimpies. Come to think of it, TST actually resembles the Farrelly Brothers' Dumb and Dumber (which the film references in a brief montage), as two smarter girlfriends dovetail together on a road trip to reunite with a guy.
I have shamelessly seen this film probably three times, which is equal to the number of times that I viewed Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle in the theater. And I am aware of this film's poor critical reception. Personally, the movie's only major flaw is that it's too short. So short that I wouldn't recommend you paying full price to see it in a theater (if it were still in theaters). I'd advise you to rent it, plus seasonal episodes of Sex and the City and a couple of Farrelly Brothers movies. While one might argue that you should just stick with the latter, I'd advise viewing this harmless, good-natured escapist movie kind of wholeheartedly.",1066953600,,3172,4.964285714285714
1733870,4,B000069HYD,"This is not a regular date movie. It has a lot of bathroom humor, making it very inappropriate for younger children to view.
The 3 women play the roles of frisky women in their late 20's, but they act like silly 15 year-old girls. They too often get themselves in outrageous sexually situations. Certain scenes will make you cover your eyes and say, ""Did they really have to put that in the movie"". Like a scene where a man flasher his thing in front of Carmen Diaz's face.
When people in other countries see this movie, I hope they don't make the assumption that ALL women in America behave as the ones in this movie.",1066003200,,618,4.3826086956521735

Christina (Diaz) is a beautiful women who hooks up with men then either never calls them again or gives them the wrong number. Courtney (Applegate) is very similar to Christina and could get any man she wanted. And Jane (Blair) is not as out going as her two friends but still manages to get some action!
We begin the film with the three girls going clubbing to try and help Jane forget about her ex-boyfriend. Christina then steps in by grabbing the attention of a man named Peter (Thomas Jane). Unfortunately he is not interested and politely goes along with his own business. But he overhears Christina bad-mouthing him and this starts a long argument between the two. But whilst this is going on Jane sneaks off and hooks up with another guy!
The next day the girls meet up again and Christina tells them all about Peter. Courtney comes to the judgement that Christina has feelings for him and they go on a road trip to find him ... with interesting results. Meanwhile Jane is getting into all sorts of trouble with her new boyfriend from the club.

Cameron, Christina and Selma (she is so cute) had me rolling throughout this entire movie and yes I even listened to the commentary on the DVD, it made the movie even funnier. This is such a girl movie, a chick flick, whatever you want to call it because its all for the ladies and the stuff we do to go after a hottie (even though the guy in the movie they were going after was not a hottie at all, they could have done better). I recommend this to any woman, any age, regardless of race. WE all can relate to it. I guess you can say its the female version of American Pie, Porky's...those type movies.

This film is silly and light hearted, offering up punchline after punchline and twist after twist. I wouldn't say this is a ""chick flick"" in the conventional sense. There's none of that sappy over-emotionalism. Although the main actors are gals, the behaviors they exhibit are easily understood by both sexes. Ladies, you'll be laughing and nodding in agreement with the actors throughout. Men--not to worry, every guy I know has laughed throughout this movie, & two of my buddies even bought the dvd.

You are probably going to vote this review home and away, but this movie is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen my share of movies. This movie contains some of the most beautiful people Hollywood has to offer, and one talented actor, I say again: One talented name: Cameron Diaz. So I ask Cameron, and I hope for God's sake she's reading this. Why Cameron? Why would you want to affiliate yourself with this garbage?
 The movie's soul, and primary intention is to tell us how we are supposed to act towards sex. Yes, this movie likes to think of itself as the bible to women, on how they should treat their partner. This is supposed to be a comedy, but I did not laugh once. If you think my humour is bad, well, let me tell you this: I want to have some ""taste"" in what I am watching. It should be some class. Let's take a close neighbor of this movie's genre: American Pie 2. It has the same content as this movie, but it has style.

Here is a film with three of the most talented and delightful comedic young actresses today, Cameron Diaz, Selma Blair, and Christina Applegate and the material is so bad that at times they even seem ambarrassed and awkward being in it. What could have been a funny, sexy look at modern twenty somethings search for love instead turned out to be a raunchy, tasteless waste of film. The movie has absolutely nothing to say.

Neither I nor my daughter knew much about this movie. Well, were we in for a big surprise! The humor throughout was truly raunchy, ribald, and raw. It was also, at times, quite funny. If you are a fan of the Farrelly Brothers movies or enjoy crude comedies, then you may enjoy this. Instead of the guys being gross, however, it's the gals.
This movie revolves around three gal pals, Christina (Cameron Diaz), Courtney (Christine Applegate), and Jane (Selma Blair) and their close encounters with the male kind. The guys, however, definitely take a back seat to these three twenty something misses. I confess, it was a bit startling, though funny, to see these gals break into a song fit for a drunken stag party. Some of the scenes were done tongue and cheek. Check out the Dick and Jane scene. You will know the scene I mean, when you see it.
This film is not for those with delicate sensibilities, as erect male sex organs, anal sex, oral copulation, and other usually taboo subjects are ripe for gags, many of which, while filthy, are often funny.

1733982,2,B000069HYD,"I can't really say that this movie was as good, bad, better, or worse than I expected. All I can say is that it was much different than the movie marketers made it out to be. I certainly wasn't expecting an American Pie apparently directed toward women in their late twenties and early thirties.
In it's bid to be a gross out comedy, it succeeded in the ""gross out"" factor, but as a complete movie it just didn't work. To my way of thinking, there are two types of gross out comedies:
1) Basically normal characters in the midst of unlikely, though basically feasible situations (Ex: American Pie).
2) Outlandish characters in outlandish, anything-goes situations (Ex: Dumb and Dumber).
The Sweetest Thing attempted to mix these two types of comedies, pitting basically normal characters into anything-goes situations, and ultimately failed. If you're going to have leftovers shaped into a tinfoil bird defying the laws of physics, toilets spewing water at ten times the pressure of your average firehose, and extras spontaneously breaking into a choreographed song and dance number, your main characters had better be on par with the overacting ability of Jim Carey. This set of characters could at best be considered quirky, and that does not carry an anyting-goes format.
When not being over-the-top in action, a good portion of the movie's gross-out factor comes from the frank, explicit dialogue between the main characters. While this may have an effect on squeamish men who flee the room rather than listen to ""girl talk"" (we all know a few of those guys, and women for that matter), I must say it had little effect on me. Perhaps I hang out with too many women.
One final thing that irked me was the character played by Selma Blair, simply because she didn't really need to be in the movie, except as filler. She has little to do with any of the main actions of the story, and only seems to be there at all because the director just enjoys working with Selma Blair.
All that being said, I had to give it a couple stars because I did find myself laughing in places, if only because of the sheer stupidity of some of the scenes. While most of the movie missed, there are a couple hits along the way. Plus there are copius scenes with Cameron Diaz and Christina Applegate in their underwear.

1734026,4,B000069HYD,"Ladies, it's ok to cut loose and be real ! That said, some of us guys have always wondered what really does go on in the women's restroom...This comedy was refreshing to see what I suspected all along...Leave a room filled with women at a club or party and see what outlandish jokes, shenanigans, and trouble they get into ! I was once told by a great aunt that a group of women can make a man blush and run out of the room !...
The humorous performances by Christina Applegate, Cameron Diaz, Selma Blair, and the neurotic Parker Posey created awesome comedic chemistry and timing...
The simple plot is about the lives of 3 young hot ladies in their late 20's, early 30's, who live in San Francisco as best friends and roommates and are having fun with life in general. But, they also encounter the ups and downs of relationships and begin to question if they are tired of playing ""the game"" referring to the dating scene as opposed to finding their Mr. Rights...Such a quest leads one of the girls to test her own faith and take that leap ! What happens in between, from the bizarre ""yellow brick road"" scene in a men's bathroom to a painful piercing incident, the sequences had me rolling ! Even the movie musical montage scenes are some of the funniest I have seen in years for any comedy...
So, guys, this is not, I repeat, a feminist male bashing film, it is something I think we all need to see to get a clue as to what our girlfriends and wives do when they let loose with their buddies ! Of course this film is not making a social statement that ALL women behave like this !!!...",1045180800,,1587,4.346801346801347

I think this movie must have been intended as an `American Pie' with women outside their teens.  You know, raunchy, fun, yet with the grace of knowing what it is and laughing at itself and the world.  Whatever, I am stunned that Cameron Diaz and Selma Blair would put their names to this tacky piece of film that is an excuse for pretty women to shake their booty and talk (and sing!) about male anatomy.  Intelligent this is not.  Christina Applegate's defining TV character Kelly might have written, produced and starred in this it is so mindless and immature.  But here Applegate is the `mature' one - a foil to Diaz's ditzy character.
Perhaps this film is supposed to be striking a blow for feminism - you know, girls can be shallow and only after one thing too.  That message is clear in the first five minutes of the film - I'm only sorry I spent the next 82 minutes of my life watching it to see if maybe there was something more.

This is not a gender issue - it is an equal-opportunity flop.  I would agree with most of the other critics that say this is the worst movie ever. It's in my top ten worst ones at least.  So what was so bad?  The script, the predictable plot, the stereotypical characters - you name it.  Buy something else!  Anything else!",1044662400,6,482,4.266666666666667
1734029,4,B000069HYD,"Given that my daughter was the one asking me to watch this movie, I knew immediately that: (1) it was going to be a girl movie, because that's all she ever asks us to watch, (2) it was going to be a comedy, (3) it would never be confused with art, and (4) you can't say the title of this movie and the name of any award in the same sentence because you'll gag and choke.
It's interesting that the same number of people who thought all those guy movies that make fun of bimbo babes with big breasts would put down a movie that does the same thing back to guys.  In its own way, this movie is a satire of all those guy movies.  It's also slapstick in the vein of The Three Stooges and The Marx Brothers.  The three women in this movie can't seem to do anything without something catastrophic happening to them.  The humor is often gross, dealing with a variety of body fluids and other natural phenomena that polite society likes to pretend don't happen or exist.  This movie has many similarities to another Cameron Diaz movie, ""There's Something about Mary"", only this movie wallows even more deeply into bodily part and function humor.
Now that I've given you all the provisos, I thought this movie was funny.  It's stupid, but then again so are many other comedies, particularly half-hour sitcoms.  The principal difference I see between most other comedies and half-hour sitcoms and this movie as that men are pretty much the butt of all the jokes.  Furthermore, several stereotypes of women (some of which are founded in a level of truth) are exploited for excellent comedic effect.  As an example, there is a scene in a restroom where Cameron Diaz and one of her friends are talking.  An anonymous woman in the restroom admires her friend's (Christina Applegate, I think) breasts as the two are talking.  Her friend tells the woman that they are fake, and tells her she can touch them.  To not annoy the Amazon censors I'll stop here, but let's say that the following events had me rolling on the floor.
I suppose I should explain the plot briefly.  Cameron Diaz is a player (in the same vein as those dozens of guy movies where it's always a guy who is the player).  She tends to go through men like some people go through paper towels, until she runs into a guy that she knows somewhere in her heart of hearts is THE guy for her (Thomas Jane playing Peter Donahue).  Cameron misses the opportunity to connect with Peter, and then regrets it.  The rest of the movie deals with Cameron and Christina trying to locate Peter, and what happens after she finds Peter.
I can see where this movie would offend men who can see the humor in stereotypes of women, and not stereotypes of men.  I can see this movie would offend women who do not like body part or fluid jokes.  And this movie would offend anyone who doesn't like gross sex jokes.  Everybody else will find this movie funny, with moments of outright slapstick.",1044662400,,2920,4.485822306238186

This is a really fun movie, and it seems to do something that not many movies have done before - present women as the dirty-minded, mischevious and fun-loving ratbags that we so often are!!
The three main players, Diaz, Applegate and Blair are fantastic together - it really looks as though they were having the time of their lives making this film!
I went out and bought the DVD a few days after hiring it because I like girly films and I sure like to laugh.

There isn't really much of a story to the whole thing, but it hardly matters.  The characters are lovable dags, most of the scenes are very funny, Diaz has some great outfits, the music is cool and in a weird way, it is quite realistic.

Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate and Selma Blair are hilarious comic actresses, and could make even the limpest script (which this is so not!) worth watching.  They are obviously having a great time, and their enthusiasm is contagious.
I bought this DVD out of curiosity and was very pleasantly surprised.  Certainly it's not the grossest gross-out comedy around, and a lot of ground has been covered before.  What makes ""The Sweetest Thing"" so refreshing is that women are not the mindless, big-breasted props to the jokes - they are smack-bang in the action, re-acting and laughing along with the best of them.  So what if the men are reduced to snivelling stereo-types?  Stereotypes are one of the staples of this genre, and women have suffered more than enough.  It's about time the tables were turned.
A lot of people take movies way too seriously.  Lighten up, relax, let yourself laugh instead of pretending to be appalled.  And when ""The P**is Song"" comes on, get up and shake your booty.  You'll have a blast!",1044403200,4,1101,4.897297297297297

With barely enough plot to qualify as a sitcom episode, The Sweetest Thing fills time with random escapades, as when third roommate Jane (Selma Blair) requires a rescue squad (accompanied by a mob of singing neighbors) after a sexual encounter with her boyfriend goes wrong. Such scenes, some of them funny, are so disconnected they make the movie look like a collection of skits, but hey, they're fun!!! And it is the characters (who remind me of my friends) that make the film more enjoyable than it should be.

I can easily compare this movie to That's Something About Mary.  But Sweetest Thing is not in every way compare to Mary.  For the cast, we have Mat Dillon, Ben Stiller in Mary.  Salma Blair and Christina Applegate are actually also good, but just being so plain besides Cameron.  (that's the purpose to cast them, I think).
For the story, Sweetest Thing is just so CHEAP, that at some parts, they are just hard to accept, and are beyond accetable.  I am not a saint: I consider the hair-gel in Mary alright and funny, I consider the laundry part in Sweetest Thing funny.  More --- I think the apple pie scene in American Pie is damn funny.  But I can't see a group of people singing Penis Song funny at all!!!  I mean other people can handle such stuff with better quality --- American Pie is a very good example.  You may find it more interesting If you are watching the UNRATED version.  But for this one, I just find it a little bit sick if you watch the unrated one.
About the story, there is no substance at all, and never touching on all the romance part.
All my 3 stars are dedicated to Cameron Diaz - If you like her, she will not be too disappointed.  She is still very sexy, and adorable.

Diaz plays Christina, who looks up from her rollerblading and walkman long enough to trip over galpal Courtney anyway(Christina Applegate), dressed like a corporate lawyer.  I suppose we should believe it when we find out she IS one here, solely on the basis of her attire.  These two are best friends, and if that's not hard enough to swallow, add Jane, the third and most unwelcome wheel in this car-wreck trio.  It seems that Jane, played by Selma Blair in an eerily revisited naive, loose bimbo bent as in ""Cruel Intentions"", (see my review)is not happy unless she is being used, abused and laughed at by everyone in town, literally.  Does anyone really think this is a girl bonding film?  A girl BONDAGE film would be less humiliating to women compared to her role here.

The ONLY good thing in this film, and the only character I cared about is Peter. (Thomas Jane) Peter is about to get married when he meets Christina, gyrating for a change, at a bar.  There is something electric for both, and Christina, a FEMALE commitment-phobic, feels he may be the one.  Since she can't forget him, she drags Courtney on the worlds most rediculous roadtrip to find him.  If two girls using a filthy public mens room, to wash off a container of spilled festering maggots sounds good, followed by hovering over a urinal for it's intended use...but not in any position normally used by a human, which subsequently causes a geyser to erupt from it, look no further for a quality viewing experience.

 ""The Sweetest Thing"" tries so hard to be funny, it misses the mark more often than not.  As a woman, I can't see this being a female empowerment film.  Just because Christina is commitment-phobic, a classic man problem revisited in every venue, she doesn't get any upper hand here.  She is not a sympathetic character, and even when getting what she wants, she nearly blows it anyway.

Speaking of blowing it, the trio's aforementioned Jane, played by Selma Blair has to be in one of the most humiliating roles a female has ever played.  Picture a life, where the removal of protein stains oddly positioned on clothing lead to embarrassment at the cleaners.  How about a large object lodged behind her tonsils with a human still attached, and needing to sing classic Aerosmith to dislodge it, along with a viewing audience in chorus.  Let's not forget, the conjugal visit to her workplace storage room, from a boyfriend in a big fluffy animal suit that bops her on the head repeatedly while physically engaged.  Is that what the real life of the strong modern woman is supposedly like?  I just want to let the guys know that are asking, the answer is NO.

 While ""The Sweetest Thing"" has a few good moments, mostly the romance between Diaz's Christina, and Jane's Peter, there are too many over the top, debasing moments to lift the film from wallowing in an abundance of trite silliness. Watch once if you are inclined, and then forget it.",1034553600,2,3165,4.712727272727273

1734127,4,B000069HYD,"The Sweetest Thing directed by Roger Kumble is truly one of the more funny chick flicks that I have seen in a long time.  Christina (Cameron Diaz), Courtney (Christina Applegate), and Jane (Selma Blair) are good friends who anyone with a close friend could relate to.  They are the steorotypical single party girls who are really out to find love, but want to have some fun on the way.  This movie fulfills every guys fantasy of why women go to the bathroom together.  After Jane gets dumped by her boyfriend Christina has the brilliant idea of going to  their favorite bar.  Here she meets Peter (Thomas Jane) who she thinks could be her Mr. Right.  They at first do not hit it off, but later that night make amends. Christina's Mr. Right invited her to his hotel room for a party.  She however does not go leading her to wonder what  could of happened, could he of been the one?  After much thought about Peter including a sexual fantasy Courtney and Christina go on the ultimate roadtrip to crash what they believe is his brothers wedding.  On their roadtrip they stop at a public restroom and sneak into the guys' restroom since the ladies room was occupied.  A string of events occur here that will keep you at the edge of your seat laughing hysterically.  When they arrive in the town they stop at what appears to be the only boutique for the next 30 miles.  Here they have a movie montage and try on some definite old lady clothes.  When they arrive at the wedding Christina finds herself meeting the bride and settling her wedding jitters.  After the bride leaves Christina gets herself locked in the rectory.  Courtney comes to her rescue as a good friend would and they find a way to crash the wedding.  Low and behold they arrive and hear that it is actually Peter getting married.  Heartbroken they return home and find Jane in a compromising position with her new man.  This movie will make you think of your own friends and deep down you know that you would of done what these girls did for love.  It is one of the best chick flicks that I have seen in a long time.  Cameron Diaz and Christina Applegate play a great pair.

The movie which has been slammed by critics and ignored by most audiences is about a girl named Christine who's young, sexy, living in San Fransisco and has all the men falling head over heels for her. One night while out with her best friends Courtney and Jane, she meets a man named Peter while trying to set up Jane who's just been recently dumped and ends up falling for him herself. What starts out as playful bickering between the two ends up with Christine questioning if he could be the one and if she is sick of playing ""the game"". Realizing later that he could have been the one, Christine and Courtney head off on a wild and hilarious road trip to track down Peter and to see if the butterflies she felt could lead to anything more. All in all the story is quite predictable, some things will take you completely by surprise, but the gags that come along the way will most likely have you talking about it the next day. The DVD unrated version is quite good and it features the ever so infamous Penis Song and a bunch of other scenes that were too racey for movie theaters included IN the movie. Also included is an enjoyable audio commentary with the film's stars Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate and the always funny, funny Selma Blair.

1734163,3,B000069HYD,"The sweetest thing about this film is Cameron Diaz.  Unfortunately, the script is so mindless and predictable that all the pizzazz that Diaz can muster hasn't a hope of rescuing this film.
This is yet another tired romantic comedy about meeting that one true love on the eve of his/her wedding.  The cast is energetic but the screenplay is lifeless and crude.  Christina (Diaz) is the consummate party girl.  She never commits to a relationship.  When she runs into Peter (Thomas Jane) in a club they argue, he leaves and of course she falls madly in love with him and tracks him down on his wedding day, aided and abetted by her loyal friends Courtney (Christina Applegate) and Jane (Selma Blair).  There are a few funny scenes, but mostly it is just a parade of visual blonde jokes and tasteless humor.  The portrayals are extremely demeaning to women.
Diaz is vivacious, energetic, cute, pouty and cold all at the same time.  This performance is a no brainer for her (literally and figuratively) and doesn't really test her acting ability.  Christina Applegate plays an uncharacteristically smart character (though no rocket scientist) and probably delivers the most dynamic performance of the cast.  Selma Blair is the least well known of the three, but steals just about every scene she is in.  Thomas Jane is soggy in the romantic lead with all the magnetism of overcooked pasta.
This film laid an egg at the box office and rightfully so.  It had a good first week and then tanked as is often the case when a popular star like Diaz opens a mediocre film and word of mouth overcomes the initial hype.  I rated it a 5/10.  The cast tries hard to have fun with it, but the material is just too dopey.",1032220800,3,1703,4.6521739130434785

Especially if her two companions are Christina Applegate and Selma Blair? Sorry! If you are easily offended, stay away. Gross-outs hang like underwear from a clothesline. Having seen Cameron give two fine performances in My Best Friend's Wedding and Head Above Water, I was dismayed to see her in this pathetic loser of a movie. She's in danger of being typecast in these gross-out exploitation projects such as There's Something About Mary which was only slightly better. Sweetest Thing's biggest problem is that it tries too hard to be raunchy and funny but fails miserably. Even the outtakes shown along with the screen credits at the very end are not funny. It is replete with unfunny sight gags, in fact Selma Blair almost literally gags on one. Applegate does a memorable scene with a urinal in the men's room that should have been left on the cutting room floor or better yet, flushed down the toilet. Instead we are made uncomfortable and embarrassed for her. Miss Diaz as the sweetest thing , is mostly spared degrading herself.

Yes, it was a perfect movie for my mood. I wanted to have a good laugh, and ""The Sweetest Thing"" definately delivered. From the introduction of Christina's character (by a bunch of frustrated males) to the hilarious scenes when the three heroines go to a nightclub, and Christina meets her match. All three women are memorable, and what's more; perfectly believable. And you can tell (don't leave right away when the credits start rolling!) that the actrices have had a lot of fun making this movie.

3 friends, Christina Walters(Diaz), Courtney(Christina Applegate) and Jane(Selma Blair) are no looking for the right man. They are lookinf for Mr right now.
When Chrsitina gets tired of dumping men like garbage, she's mets Peter(The real bad actor Thomas Jane).They fell in love in the second they saw eachother.
As soon as the movie started the only thing we'll see are:
Sexual jokes(Like American Pie, There's something about Mary),
hot dancing(Charlie's angels, American Pie), stupid little musical numbers, movie montajes and more sexual jokes.
It's not a bad movie and sure it's not great, but it was good cheap fun.
Cameron Diaz looks great here, she's so talented and beautiful.
Christina Applegate it's a goddess, and Selma Blair has the cutest little face.
OK, we all know that they're beautiful.
It's a good movie to see with friends or a girlfriend/boyfriend.
Director R. Kumble has no idea of what has he done. I mean, it's like a bunch of movies in one.
But his last film, Cruel Intentions, was so cool. It had Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillipie, Resee Witherspoon and ohh!, Selma Blair.

It's not just the timing. It's not just the acting. It is an entirety that is worse than the sum of its parts, and, while I realize that I have presented little analysis in my criticism, I simply had to write a review. I could not stand by and let humanity suffer any more than necessary at the hands of one of the most worthless pieces of cinema ever known. I will grant it this, however.

My wife rented it and as the movie dragged on for what seemed like days, she looked at me sheepishly and admitted, ""This movie really sucks!""
The acting was forced and terrible.  I can say with some confidence that this did not further the career of anyone associated with this film.  Whoever wrote the script, hopefully used a fake name.  The laughs came so rarely, I forgot it was a comedy.  And as a movie that tried to have a heart warming ending, it committed the greatest sin.

Sure, these women say their lines and do (supposedly) funny things, but they are not comediennes -- and it shows...painfully!  That problem, combined with the slapdash, thrown-together storyline, makes for one terrible film.
Selma Blair, the most talented of the three leads, unfortunately will never live down the film's oral sex scene.  It's too bad, because she's a pretty good character actress.  But from now on, this humiliating scene will be an indelible stain on her resume.

Underneath all the comedy, the love is true. Christina Walters (Cameron Diaz) is the 'love 'em and leave 'em' type of girl.

She spends her evenings club-hopping with her best friends, the equally promiscuous Courtney (Christina Applegate) and the conservative Jane (Selma Blair.
Cameron Diaz has become one of the movies' best comediennes, willing to poke fun at herself but losing none of her glamour in the process and in the movie Cameron Diaz was wonderful

Furthermore, I fail to understand the appeal of Ms. Diaz and her ... costars,(Christina Applegate and Selma Blair), why they would agree to such ... sight gags is a mystery.

1734201,2,B000069HYD,"First, I utterly adore Cameron Diaz and as big as she has become as a box office name, I have always been amazed she isn't larger. I really wanted to see this when it came out in the theaters, and was somewhat surprised when it disappeared after only a couple of weeks. I had anticipated having a bit more time. Well, I see now why it didn't stay in the theaters for very long: it simply isn't any good.
How did Cameron Diaz get involved in such an unfunny, unpleasant film? There are so many things wrong with this film. First, the director has utterly no sense of comic timing, and scenes never have the subtle things that make for genuine humor. Second, the script is a mess. All kinds of bits and scenes are thrown in that fail time and again to advance the story at all. Instead, all kinds of silliness are thrown in every couple of minutes. Third, the movie is a virtual catalog of the kinds of jokes that can be made about human bodily fluids. Fourth, the movie has a couple of the worst musical numbers I have ever seen in a lifetime of film viewing.
This should have been a good movie. All the cast members are good. I have always been surprised that Christina Applegate hasn't had her film career get off the ground after MARRIED WITH CHILDREN. She is cute as a button and utterly adorable, and she and Cameron make a devastatingly gorgeous twosome. Their friend played by Selma Blair is equally as attractive. In fact, the one pleasant thing about the film is that it is good to look at. Not just the women, but the scenery, the clubs, the grounds of the church, etc. Everything looks nice. That is, however, a genuine instance of damning with faint praise.
The problem is that while the movie has a strong cast, they aren't capable of overcoming a dreadful script that is in turn horribly directed.",1030060800,2,1810,4.422155688622754

It started out pretty cute with the guys talking about Camerons' character, but as soon as she started dancing on the sidewalk I knew it was going to be one of those shock value films with no actual believable acting involved, but i didn't expect them to break into song about penis size.
Now I usually love sick humor films, but something about this one just didn't seem right.  I'm sure it was that nothing the friends did seemed like anything a normal girl would do. (i.e. pee in a urinal or burst into song about penis size)
Yeah I laughed a few times but mostly I was confused by how choppy the plot was.  It was almost like they couldn't be bothered to have some actual acting take place before jumping  into the next ""Shocking Girl Moment"" they just cut to one right after another.

1734203,3,B000069HYD,"""The Sweetest Thing"" isn't the best movie of the year, no.  But after a particularly cruddy day, my best girl friend, popcorn, and this movie were enough to get us out of my rut and giggling.
This movie was so refreshing.  Cameron Diaz at last reprises a role that makes use of her innate comedic timing, and is strongly backed by a delicious Christina Applegate as well as versatile teen-flick actress Selma Blair (who, at age 30, is Thank Merciful God finally playing someone her own age).
Another reviewer suggested it was the dawn of a new genre, an approximation with which I must strongly agree.  This movie is the first so-called Chick Flick which actually looks and sounds like real girls getting together for a good time.  Yes, girls think about sex, too! Yes, they even dream sex! Yes, there is such a thing as a girl ""player""! It is a great cinematic stride when women can be sexualized without being objectified, or better yet, without being perceived as promiscuous skanks.
And, in the past, the raunch has been withheld from female viewers.  Sauciness in cinema has systematically been reserved for adolescent boys and the men who think like them; the women get comedies like ""Runaway Bride,"" movies which make jokes about things like fear of commitment or weight gain.  That's not funny! It's about time we got our own sex and fart jokes!
This movie, then, is a pioneer in its own way, and there hopefully will be many more movies taking a cue from its fun formula.  Perhaps you won't take your boyfriend to see it (guys probably just won't get it), and definitely heed the R rating, and no, not even all women of the target demographic will enjoy it.  But all in all, it's likely a DVD you'll want to keep hidden on your shelf for a rainy Girl's Day In.  3 and 1/2 of 5.",1030060800,2,1786,4.538940809968848
1734204,1,B000069HYD,"I saw ""The Sweetest Thing"" in its original theatrical release.  At the time, it struck me as a brain-dead comedy about three women and their lovelorn lives.  Starlets Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate and Selma Blair all seemed to be having a fun time up there on the screen and the movie was a harmless way to waste 90 minutes.  Recently, however, I've had occasion to see the unrated version of ""The Sweetest Thing"" on DVD and I feel an overwhelming need to comment.  The principal addition to the unrated version is a musical number cut from the theatrical release called ""The Penis Song"".  You read that right. It starts off with the three main characters in a restaurant discussing how they talk to men about their private parts - always telling them how big and beautiful they are.  Their talk is very frank (pun intended).  Somewhat incongruously, they start to talk out loud so that everyone in the restaurant can hear them (a la ""When Harry met Sally"").  A keyboardist at the next table starts playing and the whole place breaks out into song (a la ""Fame"") - The Penis Song!  I don't think I've heard three women use the word ""penis"" more times in the span of five minutes in my entire life.  With moves borrowed from the ""Solid Gold Dancers"" from TV's ""Dance Fever"", Cameron, Christina and Selma sing about men who are soooooo big, they just can't accomodate them sexually (""You're too big to fit in here!"" the girls coo, with gestures to the relevant parts of their anatomies).  It was right about the part that Christina Applegate grabbed an umbrella and waggled it in front of her crotch as if it was a gigantic male member projecting from her groin that my jaw hit the floor.  I was speechless.  I'm not kidding.  This thing literally paralyzed the speech centers in my brain for about 15 minutes. I have never seen anything so brazen in my entire life.  Supposedly, this sequence was left out of the theatrical release because, at the test screening, all the men hated it (although, supposedly, all the women loved it).  As a man, I wasn't offended by any of this - just shocked out of my mind.  Do women really talk this way?  Upon reflection, this sequence reminds me of the infamous ""Springtime for Hitler"" musical number in Mel Brooks' ""The Producers"".  In fact, as I think to it, this number actually outdoes ""Springtime for Hitler"" in terms of tastelessness and vulgarity.  Indeed, I'm willing to go down on record as saying that ""The Penis Song"" will be remembered as the most tasteless, foul and offensive musical number in motion-picture history.  They beat Mel Brooks.  I don't know how they did it, but they beat Mel Brooks.",1029974400,9,2650,4.653763440860215
1734205,4,B000069HYD,"The Sweetest Thing is just one of those movies that you have to see with a bunch of friends. The hilarious twists this film incorporates into the ""dating scene"" will have you rolling on the floor!! And it's like Something About Mary comidic style aims to please.
  The casting in this movie was perfect! Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate and Selma Blair play a group of women playing the field, and giving men a taste of thier own medicine! I was really impressed with Selma Blair's performance, she get's herself into embarrasingly compromising positions, that you just can't help but laugh out loud at the hilarity of them!
  Unfortunatly, Cameron Dias's character falls head over heels for a man that she hardly knows and has to go on a mini road trip with Applegate, in her disgusting car, to find him. I will not give away the good parts, I just strongly suggest you watch The Sweetest Thing and enjoy!",1029888000,,907,4.685534591194968

7965706,3,B000069HYD,"This is a pretty good movie.  I did get the unrated version.  It's funny.  Probably not for everybody.  It's raunchy.  But it's not really too offensive.  The three stars Cameron Diaz Christina Applegate and Selma Blair each have their moments.  Selma Blair has maybe my two favorite scenes.  One when she takes her dress to the cleaners.  And the other when her boyfriend shows up at her job wearing an elephant costume.  Christina Applegate when she is driving and Cameron Diaz drops something on the floor board.  And Cameron Diaz in the men's bathroom looking at a graffitti painting of  a dog.  And there is a pretty good scene in a clothing store.  Anyway I will pretty much watch anything with Christina Applegate,  And she is the reason I watched this in the first place.",1521504000,,779,4.666666666666667
