3426921,5,B001993Y86,"The writing on this show was far superior to many of the weekly shows that soon turned into parodies of their own product.

The relationship of the three main charaters (Murcock Lancer and his sons Scott and Johnny) was far more complex than Bonanza; and their acting was far more impressive than on the shows that were turning into comedy.  There are more than a thousand fans out here -- in Great Britain, New Zealand, Canada and the Americas who would like to see the show broadcast again.  BRING THE SHOW BACK TO THE FANS: TELL US WHAT IT TAKES TO GET  YOU RELEASE THE ENTIRE SERIES (INCLUDING THE BLACK & WHITE COMPLETE PILOT]

My son is in Afghanistan in support to the military and would love to to see the show once again.  It would really be great to be able to send him the DVD's for Christmas.  Can't you make that happen?  Or do you not care?",1227225600,16,854,4.327044025157233
3426922,5,B001993Y86,"Some of the strongest characterizations to hit the television screen.  James Stacy as Johnny Madrid Lancer, Wayne Maunder as Scott Lancer and Andrew Duggan as Murdoch Lancer left their mark on legions of fans.  All three played against type and were great. With a host of character actors and guest stars, this is talent at its finest.  Some of today's crop of ""talent-free stars"" can take some lessons. I am waiting for the release to DVD.",1226966400,2,440,4.7631578947368425
3426923,5,B001993Y86,"Running in the late 1960's it starred Andrew Duggan as the patriach and James Stacy and Wayne Maunder as his sons.  Not a bad show but the tv western craze was running its course.  James Stacy, a few years later, would be involved in a devastating motorcycle accident that would take and arm and a leg and pretty torpeado his career.  A few parts from time to time (like in SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES).  Maunder -- whose previous tv foray was as Custer -- would go on to a few films like SEVEN MINUTES and then vanish.  Duggan would be a popular guest star on numerous tv shows until his demise.",1226966400,4,600,4.321428571428571

3426964,5,B001993Y86,"I never missed an episode of this show when I was growing up.  Outstanding ensemble cast. Can't wait for it to be remastered and put on dvd.
I was on e-bay and saw it available there however, it was just vhs taping transferred to dvd. The quality was not there but, I so wanted to see and own the series that I bought the copy anyway.  I introduced my mother-in-law, my daughter  and my grandson to the show. Even with the poor quality dvds they soon just got into the story. We ended up watching for 3 hours.  I would buy this in a New York minute if it were made available in remastered quality dvd set.  Please listen to us Lancer fans and make this available. I've seen lots of shows that didn't have this following now on dvd.

3426992,5,B001993Y86,I was fond of this show because I loved the relationship between the main characters. I also loved it because it was set in southern California.,1359504000,2,144,4.576923076923077
3426993,5,B001993Y86,"I was about 14 when this show was on the air. My friends and I were mostly breathless every time we saw Johnny. Four decades later, with a much different perspective, I recently discovered some videos on utube and I like the show very much - much better than most of what I watch on TV. The stories are good and the characters are worth knowing. I would buy this in a moment.",1355097600,4,375,4.1506849315068495

3426995,5,B001993Y86,"Lancer was my favorite TV western ever.  Yes only 51 episodes but the era was ending on TV.  Loved the family relationships. The characters were all very enjoyable including Murdoch and Jelly,  And what lady didn't love Johnny Madrid Lancer,  an original reformed bad boy (well not completely reformed).  I so wish we could see this series again on DVD.  I would buy several copies to keep.  So many bad westerns have been released why not Lancer a really good one.  I'm an Arizona resident and I so preferred Lancer to High Chaparral which was based and filmed in my state. Come on release Lancer.  Fans will buy it!!",1349049600,13,618,4.5963302752293576

L love this show, and after all of these Decades of waiting, I'm getting to be quiet impatient.  When will 20th Century Fox going to put this Television Show on to DVD; I've checked, and this show ONLY Lasted two { 2 } Seasons, so what I would like to know is what is the problem / delay in getting the Entire Series { Only two / 2 Seasons } placed on to DVD?  I really wish 20th Century Fox would Hurry Up and place this Super Fantastic Western on to DVD.  Hollywood has placed other Old Time Show's on to DVD, so why can't they put this one on to DVD?  I just hope that they get around to putting this show LANCER on to DVD real soon, I'm getting quiet impatient when it comes to waiting.  I've waited for Approximatley 50 Years already, just how much longer am I going to have to wait before 20th Centry Fox gets off there High Horse and places LANCER on to DVD?",1344211200,5,1029,4.069306930693069
3426997,5,B001993Y86,"I wish they would put Lancer on cable and also on DVD and amazon instant video!! They have been able to do that for so many older shows and movies.  Why not Lancer?  I can't help but wonder if it's because of the problems with James Stacy (motorcycle accident causing loss of limbs, his later arrest, etc.).  But I really used to like the show and how the 2 brothers (including Wayne Maunder) and their father interacted.  It would be nice to see it (and them) again.",1341187200,8,467,4.333333333333333

However, I would also like to get an official, informed reason as to why we have waited so long with no end in sight.

3427054,5,B001993Y86,"With all the old westerns being released, I cannot believe that one of the most popular in its time, and with a large, international, fan based following some forty years later, Lancer has not been released.  I, personally, would buy more than one complete set.  Bring on Lancer!",1281571200,,279,4.791666666666667
3427055,3,B001993Y86,I have waited for years to get to see a re-run of this series but understand its because of the format.  Why then do we get to see 'old movies'... come on you must have the technology. I am sure this would make a great Saturday afternoon/evening series at least???  We don't get any Westerns any more and this was a great one.  James Stacy's world changed completely after his horrific accident and although he did take part in several films after that he has never got the recognition he deserved.  I am sure he would love to see how many people want this series back..  Youtube have lots of clips from Lancer and some great ones of James's but its not the same as sitting back and watching it on TV or if not that DVD.

3427056,5,B001993Y86,"This show has a huge following.  The characters, most especially Johnny Madrid aka Johnny Lancer played by James Stacy are as memorable, if not more so, than those of all the other westerns which had far more seasons than Lancer was given.  It was also noted to be one of the best written westerns.  There is no reason not to put it on DVD.  People are buying every other western and there are only 51 episodes.  Words spreads fast, put it on DVD and market it and I'll bet you sell  quite a few as all the fans still remember some 40 years later!",1263859200,3,547,4.211538461538462

3427058,5,B001993Y86,"Lancer was my favorite western of the 60's.  The relationship between Murdoch and his sons Johnny and Scott was far more interesting and unpredictable than Bonanza.  Why Bonanza lasted so long and Lancer didn't, I don't know.  James Stacy and Wayne Maunder were handsome and talented actors.  I hope whoever has the rights to this series will get the series digitally remastered (or whatever it is they do to sharpen the image) and put it on the market soon.  I certainly will buy it.",1251849600,2,484,4.714285714285714

3427060,5,B001993Y86,I saw some of the episodes for this series in reruns since I came to this country after the original release.  It was a very enlightning series of the old west and the relationship between the father and his two sons who are half brothers was the key element for my interest in the series.  I do hope that the entire series is available soon.  I would buy it in an instant.  That's how good this show was.,1235865600,4,405,4.153846153846154

8272782,5,B001993Y86,I have been periodically searching the Internet for DVDs on Lancer because they never rerun them.  It's hard to believe with today's technology that it hasn't been done when so many fans are  requesting it.  I was so excited to see it advertised on eBay when I did a search however I'm reluctant to purchase it because I'm not sure if it's true quality since they didn't show an image of an actual DVD package.  Then on this site I read a review referring to that very item and how it was poor quality burned from a VHS tape.,1509494400,,525,4.2727272727272725

Wednesday, Nov. 23, 2016 at 7:30 p.m. (Quentin Tarantino's revival theater) New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles (7165 Beverly Blvd.) is screening a 16mm print of the ""Lancer"" pilot. On the big screen! How lucky can we get? Well, if it was officially on DVD that would be good luck. Presenting television properties in a theater, as opposed to a university archive's tribute or restoration program for instance, is very rare and quite unusual. The various talent guilds usually prevent the showing of a TV program that was ""free"" in first run ""on the tube"" from being screened in a cinema where normal admission policies are in play. Please attend; think of all the great conversational tidbits it'll add to your Thanksgiving gathering!
Oh, the second half of the evening's James Stacy tribute is ""Posse"" (1975) and ""more 16mm James Stacy bonuses!""
2014 posting:
What intrigues me about the new, complete ""Daniel Boone"" release (Fall 2014) is that it's an official 20th Century Fox release.  I hope that if the studio will finally release one of its ancient properties completely, like ""Daniel Boone,"" that maybe, just maybe, 20th Century Fox's much-in-demand ""Lancer"" -- and dare I ask ""Judd for the Defense"" -- will follow.",1413590400,3,1325,4.968468468468468
