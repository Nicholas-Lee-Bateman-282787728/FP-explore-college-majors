5956289,4,B002IDVUJM,"From Producer James Wan, the director of The Conjuring and Insidious, brings us a new twist in horror with first time Director David Sandberg in Lights Out. As Martin begins to develop fears of the dark he turns to his sister Rebecca as their mom grows more unstable due to her depression. We learn that a shadowy figure named Diana is living in the dark and was a friend of their mother Sophie when both were in a mental facility as kids. After suffering from a rare skin disorder and the doctors failed attempts to treat Dianas condition it takes a turn for the worse. Now Diana is preying on Sophies family and will go at nothing to have all but Sophie to herself. The film stars Teresa Palmer, Gabriel Bateman, Alexander DiPersia, and Maria Bello.

This was one of those films that couldve been a straight rip-off of Darkness Falls (2003) or Robert Harmons They (2002), but instead we get an inventive take on many peoples worst fears of being afraid of the dark. A nail biter is an understatement as David Sandberg focuses on the light and how terrifying it would be if something was living in the shadows. My overall impressions of the film was that it was excellent and had a well-rounded cast that not only served for the purposes of the movie but also gave us reasons for caring for the characters as well. Never was the movie dull nor did it skip a beat as it followed a tight pace in its 82 minute runtime.

As we mentioned before, what many horror films lack is in character development. Rather in Lights Out everyone plays a contributing role to where we end up caring for all of them in some way. The movie also does a good job of following the mom played by Maria Bello and her daughter Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) when both of them go back and forth when it came to the safety and concerns of Martin. Seeing from each vantage point and how screwed up the family has been over the years you could only but appreciate the balance in their development as characters. Which then leads us into the shadowy figure herself, Diana, who without giving anything away plays an integral part with Sophie. Diana is also just a freakishly looking entity with an interesting backstory that can only be haunting from first glance.

The movie is well-paced with one of the best opening sequences that will surely get under your skin. It had me in suspense from the very beginning and didn't let up until the very end. Just the idea of Sandberg exploring the dark and by creating a compelling story to go along with it is a testament to film makers in the genre of horror. Its no surprise that he got a little help by James Wan who is currently the go to guy for horror movies and has a way of using audiences fears as weve seen in his past films. Every time youd have a character play with the light and seeing Diana from one moment to the next was terrifying only because you didn't know where shed be the moment the light went back on. The thought of what you cannot see is just as frightening of what you can see.

Being that this is David Sandbergs first feature length movie he did an incredible job. Not only did Lights Out keep you on the edge of your seat but you also were able to care for everyone as well. The performances by Teresa Palmer and Gabriel Bateman were great along with a minor role of Alexander DiPersia, who as Rebeccas boyfriend, brought some comic relief when needed. That was something that worked to its benefit as well when there were funny moments to help ease the tension when Diana would run amok. Best thing to do is to go into the movie with very little knowledge or exposure to the trailer. If you want to freak people out who haven't heard of Lights Out then youll definitely want to take this ride.",1469318400,26,3731,4.402898550724638
5956290,5,B002IDVUJM,"This was very good, and very very scary. I definitely can see what James Wan saw in him. I was excited for this movie got a long time and I was even there for the short film. I recommend this to everyone. Of course not EVERYONE on the planet will like this movie, but give it a watch. I don't think you'll regret it :)",1469318400,7,318,3.9076923076923076
5956291,4,B002IDVUJM,"Good horror is so rare that fans veritably go gaga when an effective film lands. Thus, the look of ecstatic satisfaction on my face as I walked out of Swedish-born filmmaker David Sandberg's ultra-creepy feature debut, Lights Out.

A well-shot, gore-free psychological thriller about our elemental fear of darkness, Lights Out has a good deal in common with The Babadook. While it can't touch Jennifer Kent's masterpiece, it does mark the arrival of a major new talent.

Maria Bello stars as Sophie, an unstable mother of two whose obsessive love for her imaginary friend Diana (Alicia Vela-Bailey) has alienated her kids, the depressive black-clad rocker chick Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) and Martin (Gabriel Bateman), a remarkably good-natured innocent.

But are they delusions? Diana, a shadowy monster with wild flowing black hair, long sinewy arms, and sharp claws, does appear in the flesh - but only when there's total darkness. Is she a real person, or at least a real entity?

One thing's for sure: Diana likes to kill people who love her galpal, and she quickly dispatches Sophie's husband, Paul (Billy Burke), in the film's only gory scene. When the spectral being goes after Martin, his big sister steps in to save the day.

Touched at every point by paranoia and hallucinatory despair, Sandberg's tightrope plotline is driven by a breathless hysteria that never quite goes away. It's not hard to divine that Bello and her daughter both have a deep-seated fear of men. (One keeps expecting Miss Havisham to show up.)

The few men in the film are subordinate to their mates (or dead). Rebecca's sensitive beau, Bret (Alexander DiPersia), for one, is a useful lad when there's heavy lifting to be done and who asks for little in return. He's awfully patient with his gal's inability to refer to him as her boyfriend and her refusal to let him keep a change of clothes at her pad.

The picture's psycho-sexual undertones and its self-conscious play on hysteria evoke the classic ""women's films"" of John M. Stahl -- as remade by Douglas Sirk. There's an overwhelming sense of entrapment as experienced by women -- marriage, bourgeois life, suburban values serve as a hellish prison. The only escape seems to be fantasy, madness, violence or death. That's what Diana offer. She's conjured up by a woman who can see no way out.

For a film with such a simple, linear storyline, Lights Out invites a surprising amount of thematic fat to chew on.

Despite my enthusiasm for the film, I'm not sure I'll feel this positive about it on a second viewing.  I've seen so much garbage in the genre lately that I became ecstatic and very grateful to be watching something actually good.

As a movie, it works well. Does it deserve a score of 75% or higher? I do know that I'm grateful to Sandberg for using music so sparingly. And for sparing us from the indignity of jump scares. When he sets out to frighten you, he means it.",1469145600,41,2919,4.806387225548902
5956292,5,B002IDVUJM,"It's genius in that it is so simple.  A camera follows some machines and people narrate as if they are the machines.  My kids are glued to the tv when this is on.  I don't understand it, but they love it.",1346630400,,204,3.926829268292683

Glad I watched it with the lights on. They used the let the audience imagine stuff on their own theory that I'm always wish horror genres would use more of.

... Crap I'm noticing really creepy sounds in my house now... The pump in the basement sounds kinda like that scratching on the floor... 

So all in all a great horror film.",1514505600,2,494,4.178947368421053

5956332,5,B002IDVUJM,Im a sucker for scary movies with fun jump scares and don't need to have a bunch of gore.  If you like monster movies and don't need a really deep story this is a good time.  The back story is interesting if you stay positive.  If You like Krampus as much as I do this movie is for you.,1513555200,,286,3.8135593220338984

5956344,3,B002IDVUJM,"Not the ""gem of a movie"" the cover says it is. YES it DOES have some twists in it but they aren't really that surprising except for the ending. It's just like any other horror movie out there but with a PG 13 rating.
While some aspects are new the scares and jumps are really not that scary (to me at least). The good part only gets going the LAST 30 minutes or so, the rest seems like nonsense very slow back story and eye rolling arguments and talks.",1509494400,,452,4.089887640449438

Granted, this genre isn't typically written for the plot or writing as much as the scare factor so keeping it in context, this was definitely one I would recommend if you want a good scary movie.

5956361,4,B002IDVUJM,"This is a (barely) feature-length movie based on a famous Internet short film.  This film starts out just as creepy as its progenitor, but then for some reason, instead of luring you into the story, and having you try to figure out whats going on as the characters do, the film just yanks its coat open and reveals everything to you right away, like some sort of supernatural Columbo.  All of the characters already know whats happening, why its happening, and you are the one having to play catch-up, not them.  This is all the more curious since  with its short running time  there was plenty of time to build this story slowly.  Instead, it comes across as a monster-of-the-week X-Files episode, if you were to remove Mulder and Scully from the plot and film the story without them.

5956371,5,B002IDVUJM,"DVD REVIEW: This is all about what the Boogeyman should have been. I am reviewing from the DVD copy I bought. The extras on the Amazon page are superb. Quite literally this is the first Horror film since 1978 that scared me enough to keep the lights on all night. It is really primal in the way it is constructed. but still a very definitive James Wan style film, since it seems he has been very hands on with the film. The DVD has deleted scenes, and they are excellent. One part seems to be an alternate ending; and my suspicion is that one version could finish the film here, or one version could make a film or two more. Either way, this is very creepy. I cant recommend this film enough, and get into the film, and you will be awake all night. It is soooo cool. James Wan is the best.
If you enjoyed Maria Bello in Lights Out, check out the 2005 film THE DARK, it is a tour de force driven mainly by Maria, and this shows Maria Bello in a feature Length film that shows just how fabulous Maria is, and I also think she is very beautiful, and a talented actress. I bought THE DARK purely on the strength of seeing Maria in LIGHTS OUT, and it was well worth it... chilling, emotive, and a great ensemble work with Maria as the pinnacle. Highly recommended",1502928000,,1258,4.224066390041494

5956375,5,B002IDVUJM,"As a horror fan, I have spent many years waiting for just one quality horror movie without compromise. God knows I browse Netflix and wonder if I'd rather see something that might not be made all that seriously or one that was probably made with a serious intent. Here, we have a truly solid entry. There's a well-timed opening that establishes the horror entity and then a gradual reveal of who or what the entity was/is. There's a personal story about a sister choosing to take care of her brother because her mother is psychologically ill that feels sincere. I also like how the movie retains a sense of being unpredictable. Overall, the themes are set up and explored efficiently, there are some excellent scenes, and the movie builds to a darkly beautiful finale. There's a great sense of place as the director establishes the areas and then has the characters act in the areas so that we know where they are in the structure of the house rather than just being a 'scene' away from the other characters. Elizabeth Shue is reliably fantastic.

Just FYI, I prefer to just watch a movie without watching trailers or reading much beforehand which is why this review does not describe much in detail. This is a perfect horror movie to just watch without watching anything beforehand and see if you enjoy it. Many movies are best experienced that way. The only thing I had a slight issue with is that you are just buying a blu-ray with a digital copy, no DVD. I personally keep the DVDs and give them to friends and family to rent/keep, and this was one in which I was excited to share the movie. Ah well, at least I got a blu-ray and a digital copy.

5956411,4,B002IDVUJM,"I guess I'm in the minority, but I thought Lights Out was pretty darn scary!  The idea behind the story is simple- when the lights are off a monster appears, but when the lights are on the monster instantly disappear and is no longer a threat.  It seems strange, and you're probably thinking this is a tacky way of implementing a threatening monster but luckily this is better than that other horror movie where people just vanish into thin air (Don't Blink).  At least Lights Out feels scary most of the time.

A ghost named Diana haunts a mother played by Maria Bello.  At first it would seem the mother has some mental problems, and well without spoiling the *shocking* ending and the majority of the story she most certainly isn't right in the head and previously spent time in a mental hospital (which is how she met Diana) but her behavior is all because this Diana ghost is haunting and really taking a toll on Maria's character to the point she's stressed and needs medication.  I mean imagine what this poor mother must be going through?  Every time she turns out the lights she has to confront Diana!  She has to have  conversations with Diana just to keep her from going ballistic!  Ain't nobody getting any sleep in that house.

And Diana's relentless.  She doesn't make a few appearance here and there either.  She basically waits for the lights to turn off so she can come out and reveal her dark, oversized demented body to not only the mother, but also her daughter (the star of the movie played by Teresa Palmer) the young son (Gabriel Bateman) and the boyfriend (Alexander DiPersia).  They all have to sleep with the lights on.  This wouldn't be a problem for me- I never minded having the lights on while asleep, but many people would probably dislike it.  Hey it's either the lights on or dealing with Diana.  Yeah, you know which one to choose!

The story is that Gabriel realizes something is seriously wrong with his mom and he's terrified to live in the same house, so rather soon Teresa comes by and takes him in even though it's not legal for her to do so.  Of course the mother objects in a big way.  But can you blame the boy?  Say what you will about this movie, but even the biggest haters must admit the scene in the beginning when we see the mother talking to a dark space in a closet after Gabriel walks in is quite disturbing... and as Gabriel walks away Diana grabs the side of the door with her hand and watches him leave.  That's downright terrifying!  It's odd Diana would follow Gabriel to his bedroom and wiggle the doorknob though.  I guess Diana doesn't understand it's night night time and people, especially kids, shouldn't be interrupted.  I guess the mother forgot to inform Diana that she shouldn't bother her young son.

The movie relies on special effects but they're used to great effect here.  Of course they're only used when Diana appears.  I guess if this movie has one weak point it's that it lacks suspense.  The lights go out... here comes Diana!  No waiting around.  Also the boyfriend feels like he wasn't necessary.  He feels like he's just coming along for the ride, and doesn't really care or have any feeling on the matter until he too has an awkward confrontation with Diana.  Oh and after this when the police get involved, this story surely gets terrifying then!  You really want to know what will happen when Teresa and Gabriel become trapped in the basement, and how they will escape for one thing, but also create light to keep Diana away.

So yeah, for the majority of the story we see Teresa and Gabriel walking around either Teresa's own apartment or the mother's house at night with flashlights, candles, lighting fires, basically anything that creates light.  All in an attempt to keep Diana away.  Is it true Diana is played by a 15-year old girl (Ava Cantrell?)  If so the movie producers did a tremendous job making her look much older and absolutely scary!  She's famous for Nickelodeon scary stuff but this movie is authentic horror in my opinion, and more intended for a mature audience.

Some people think the movie's notable for its mention of family mental issues, but I feel that aspect of the story doesn't really develop enough to leave an impression.  Also I'd like to know what kind of powers Diana has.  She can shift from one room to another in the blink of an eye, and she can even speak.  Perhaps more should have been done there, but I'm not complaining.  Still a tremendous movie.",1492128000,,4474,4.573584905660377

5956445,3,B002IDVUJM,"Possible spoilers.  This film started out as a 3-minute short on YouTube by Swedish director, David F. Sandberg.  Producer James Wan brought Sandberg and his wife Lotta Losten (who plays Esther in the opening sequence) to Hollywood to pump it up with $5 million.  While I didn't particularly love the film, the money was well spent.

Maria Bello plays Sophie the bi-polar mother of young Martin (Gabriel Bateman) with her current husband, Paul (Billy Burke).  Teresa Palmer stars as Rebecca, Sophies daughter from a previous marriage to a man who walked out on the family years earlier.  Rebecca lives on her own and occasionally shacks up with Bret (Alexander DiPersia).

Sandberg doesnt waste a lot of time getting to the scary stuff which is one of the things that put me off.  Essentially there is a boogie-man (or more accurately, woman) living in Sophie and Martins house.  She only appears in the dark.  When the lights are on she disappears.  Sophie is usually off her meds, engaging in a conversation with an imagined character named Diana, a girl she met in a psychiatric facility as a child.  Rebecca comes to Martins rescue at school where he cant seem to stay awake.  This of course is due to his constantly monitoring his room lights to make sure the shadowy woman doesnt get him.  Unlike many horror movies, this monster has no problem moving from building to building to scare the hell out of whoever she wants.  And yes, death appears to be always on the table.

As I noted earlier, the budget is well spent on the technical aspects of the film.  The scenes are spookily lit, the sets are well done and the acting is fine, especially Bello as the mentally tormented woman.  But the story is pretty routine for the genre and every jump-scare (there are many) is telegraphed, as is the conclusion.  In short, this is technically a well done movie but provides little in the way of tension or suspense.  If you want to sit around and wait for the next jump scare, this is your movie.",1489104000,,1997,4.651428571428571

James Wan is a great horror director and I'll always give him benefit of the doubt and give his films a chance, but this one isn't near on par with Insidious and The Conjuring. The mental illness story had potential but the ""ghost"" Diana isn't interesting enough to push it further. The only source of anything resembling horror is jump scares, and even those are predictable (lights go out = scare), and that severely limits any possible story. Acting is fine but they can't carry the bad product themselves. Sadly not worth the money.",1485475200,,579,4.686274509803922

5956517,4,B002IDVUJM,"This movie has a lot of the same as some of the more recent horror films. You see some of the same scare set ups as with Sinister, The Conjuring, Insidious,etc. It takes this recent horror movie structure and gives us a more unique method on delivering. There are some truly creepy moments in the film. Having the frights come with the turning off and on of light is incredibly effective. This can bee seen especially in the warehouse scene with the timers, and the apartment scene with the  flickering neon lights. The movie packs in the jumps through out and follows through till the end, which if I say was a bit of a surprise. Good Stuff all the way around.",1485129600,,661,4.418032786885246
5956518,1,B002IDVUJM,"This movie is your classic B-grade horror flick glazed over with so-called modern appeal. No one can act. The story, what little there is, is over the top. Not once does this movie give you a reason to invest in the characters, the mystery, the ending, anything. I was very, very disappointed. There are way too many instances when all the cliches you expect and cringe at--but not for fright's sake--from a horror movie play out in nauseating predictability. I couldn't feel frightened once, and I tried. It was just one more stupid movie trying but failing to deliver cheap scares, like so many horror films now-a-days are. Also, how is Teresa Palmer still being chosen to act? She can't.

5956526,5,B002IDVUJM,"Years ago, Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) left home early to escape the bizarre habits and phobias of her troubled mother Sophie (Maria Bello).  Largely dormant for a time, these strange habits and obsession with the dark of Sophie's have returned, possibly putting Rebecca's little brother Martin (Gabriel Bateman) in danger.  Rebecca returns home to find the house all darkened, lights off, heavy drapes over windows, etc., and a mother who's convinced that someone named Diana is living with them, and can only exist in the dark.  Sophie is also convinced that Diana is friendly, but Martin is scared to death of her.  Rebecca thinks that she has to protect her little brother from a mentally unbalanced and delusional mother, but there may be more to Diana than the mother's imagination.

Lights Out is an unusual horror movie in that most of the main characters, including the villain, are impacted by or motivated by issues involving abandonment.  In Rebecca's case it's her guilt, as she feels that she let down both her mother and her brother by leaving at a young age when her mother was clearly not well; for other characters the abandonment theme takes different forms.  The movie offers glimpses at what I think is a pretty extensive backstory, and I wouldn't be surprised if it's followed up by a prequel.  With some of the year's most memorable scenes, Lights Out is a fast-paced, original and scary film that could be just the start of a whole series.",1484697600,,1459,4.854838709677419

5956610,5,B002IDVUJM,I really enjoyed this movie. It was great and I agree with another reviewer that it would have probably been even better in a theater or room full of people.,1483228800,,157,4.266666666666667
5956611,2,B002IDVUJM,The first 10 minutes are the only part worth watching. Nothing new with this one. Same old jump and scare tactics.,1483228800,,114,4.476190476190476

5956613,3,B002IDVUJM,"Have to say I was disappointed, because I LOVE David F Sandberg's short films, and I felt like this feature film was just the same old tired story-line used over and over again. There was nothing different about it. There is such a rich bounty of ideas they could have pulled from with his short films, but they stuck to safe and simple, which equals boring and nothing new.",1483142400,,374,4.434782608695652

5956615,2,B002IDVUJM,"Despite a good concept, to me this was just another mediocre modern horror. Saw it in the theater. There were quite a few obvious cliches in the movie such as jumpscares (albeit not overly plentiful), after one of which I laughed.",1483056000,,230,4.634146341463414
5956616,4,B002IDVUJM,I felt it was a good movie many parts were scary but I love that kept me entertained through the movie,1483056000,,102,3.9047619047619047
5956617,4,B002IDVUJM,"So this one is kind of hard for me to write because I don't knw exactly how to describe this movie. So instead of trying to give you a rundown on it, I'll just jump into my review.
Scare factor:  This movie was much more thrilling than it was straight up scary. In fact, even though it is PG-13 it took me from the time Amazon released this movie until now to decide to watch it because the trailer scared the crap out of me. I guess playing on that fear of not the dark, but what is in the dark really had me up in the air about this movie. So if you are looking for blood and guts, this is not blood and guts so much as it is an awesome thriller/suspense.
Attention: This movie caught my attention much more than most movies and I think it refers back to the previous comment I made about it being suspenseful and thrilling. I was afraid if I turned away something would jump out and scare the life out of me. It also kept me interested in ""where is it"".
Storyline: Okay, first off there will be NO SPOILERS here. Scouts honor. The storyline was good, pretty unique, but there still seemed to be some holes that needed filling in a little better. I felt like we needed more mom in the story because it seemed like she was an underplayed character and also underdeveloped. That is honestly one of the two reasons I couldn't go 5 stars. However, other than that it was a pretty refreshing take when it comes to horror/thriller/suspense.
Overall: The only last thing I will say about this film and the second reason for my 4 instead of 5 star rating was the fact that the trailer scared me more than the movie. Maybe it was the over-expectation effect and I was expecting it to be much scarier than what it was. Regardless, it was still good.",1483056000,8,1741,4.243975903614458

5956626,4,B002IDVUJM,"An entity from 'Sophie's' (Maria Bello) days in a mental institution called 'Diana' who she'd befriended
as a child resurfaces to bring terror to her family.....again.
'Sophie's' daughter 'Rebecca' (Teresa Palmer) who as a young adult lives away from her mother these
days becomes concerned when her younger brother 'Martin' (Gabriel Bateman) hears his mother
talking to a dark figure......'Rebecca' remembers similar memories from her childhood.
'Rebecca's' instinct is to protect her 'Martin'
The entity fast makes her presence known but can only be seen when the lights are out, it seems that
she is jealously targetting 'Sophie's' family so that her friend has no other to share her time with.
'Diana' died a long time ago....'Rebecca' and her boyfriend decide to stay over at 'Sophie's' house to try
and protect 'Martin' from the danger that has increasingly become a real threat.
A power-cut caused by the 'entity' that night makes the situation a whole lot worse for all in the house....
'Diane' can roam freely......will anyone survive the threat ?
A chilling tale at times which often, with it's imagery put me in mind of the earlier 'Ring' movies.
Worth a viewing....i'd say, catch it on a movie-channel rather than buy as i did.

It makes you jump sometimes, definitely made my kids scream throughout, but even they were like that is how they are ending it? That is so stupid. Some things were a little predictable but over all it wasn't the greatest. It was good throughout the movie but the end just really was like they were like ok we spent all this money we are now at the end and don't have the money to fund the ending.

I thought it was a solid film initially that just couldn't keep pace. The family issues that are supposed to be a vehicle for the plot fall flat because the backstory lacks enough dimension to carry the tension into the movie's present timeline. Some bursts of good acting that just really can't sustain the second half of the film and all the loose ends that keep cropping up as the movie progresses from a relatively good first thirty-five to forty minutes. If we knew less about the family, less about the antagonist and focused on occasional moments of revelation between scares it would have been better.

However, this film shows that you CAN extract two film's worth of ore from the same vein. This tidy little horror gem scared the living sh*t out of me, and I eat horror movies for breakfast and crap cartoons. The writer, director, and cast played it very smart and kept it simple and quick-moving. With a run-time under 90 minutes, I worried I was going to feel cheated. After having watched the film, I don't know if I could have taken a longer version of this.

Very well done technically  (with very little CGI), solid acting, and many suspenseful, legit scenes with a good scare, not like many movies with a  lot of build ups with nothing to follow it but a 'silly trying to be cute scene' for lack of true substance. This movie perfect portions of substance throughout . This movie It's like a creepy baby bears bed: everything is just right. A high caliber movie in this genre.  I found many of the reviews very well and thoughtfully written. It's difficult to add more insights & helpful feedback as the reviews were as high caliber as the movie. I love this type of movie and clearly see how the references to ""Mama"", ""The Conjuring"", and ""The Babadook"" were spot on in the reviews I read. I really can appreciate those references, and see clearly why those movies were often cited in other reviews.  Moreover, these references in the reviews clearly mention don't expect rehash of those movies. It's plays upon the primal fear of things most of have had and some still do. In the darkness, the shadows when we are alone, we question did we see something, or did we see nothing, or are we just not sure? Are you sure its nothing? This movie is surprisingly good if not excellent. It's difficult to find a movie that has that right blend of being just believable enough to make you jump a few times and then leave you on the edge of your seat and stay there. I can see also some influence from ""The Ring"". If you choose to watch this, I hope you do, I believe you will not be disappointed.

5956849,5,B002IDVUJM,"Its very difficult for a horror/thriller to give it all away up front and still somehow keep you squirming in your seat. Lights Out does just that, consistently. You see the monster just moments into the film, additionally you see the mechanics and rules it must adhere to. Worse, the trailer actually explains who the villain is and yet STILL the film keeps you interested and unnerved.
 There are classic themes of family, abandonment, and psychological manipulation. However at no point do you doubt that Diana is real and deadly. Everyone in the film does a top job of keeping you curious as to whats coming next, and an excellent portrayal of pure fear.
 If you enjoy jump-scares, ghost/demon movies, or just have the chance to enjoy a good movie; give this a shot, you won't regret it. Turn off the lights and settle in, not since The Conjuring or Insidious have I enjoyed a modern horror movie this much.",1478822400,2,911,4.6875

5956852,5,B002IDVUJM,I won't give away any spoilers but I will say this... It is so hard to find horror movies that even phase me anymore these days. This is one of the few that did. My advice? Watch it in the dark right before going to bed. Wouldn't suggest this for young kids but if you're an adult looking for a good horror flick this is definitely a great choice.,1478736000,,347,4.043478260869565

5956854,4,B002IDVUJM,"Lights Out wasn't the greatest horror movie ever made, or even competing for the title, but it was a decent contribution to the horror genre with a pretty unique (at least I haven't come across it before) concept of something that can kill you which can only move when in darkness, yet you're safe when you turn on the light.  Of course that light might not stay on for long.  I know vampires and sunlight, but this is different to that, artificial light also stops it from reaching you and killing you.

Interestingly the movie only goes for 76 minutes.  On the region 4 DVD, it comes with 13 minutes of deleted scenes. Worth trying to track a version down that comes with the deleted scenes if your version doesn't. With a such a short timed movie it's odd that they didn't leave most of those in there, just to try and make the usual minimum around 90 minute mark. I guess the producers/directors whoever cuts the final product really believed a shorter than standard length movie was better  than with those scenes. You've got to kind of admire that. I didn't mind most of the deleted scenes though.  However one of the deleted scenes is an alternative ending (or occurring after the events in this movie) which I think was better left out as it leaves the one in the movie as a more powerful ending.",1478736000,,1304,4.481012658227848

5956888,5,B002IDVUJM,"Lights Out is an extremely creepy & effective horror film with an interesting premise surrounding lights. Its rare when a modern horror film turns out to be actually creepy let alone good but Lights Out succeeds on both counts. Some great atmosphere in certain parts also which is always welcomed in a horror film. Basic story is a ghost that can only be seen when the lights are turned off goes on to terrorize a family (I'm purposefully trying to be vague for those that haven't seen it) & they must figure out how & why its happening & how to stop it. The cast were good as was the special effects with the lights. I feel this is one easily one of the best horror films released this year. For those that don't know the film is based on a short film that sadly wasn't included on the disc (no idea why) & that's also worth checking out. The only special features on the disc is deleted scenes. If supernatural horror films are something you like, or even horror films in general then definitely check out Lights Out.",1478563200,,1019,4.396825396825397

After this latest heavily touted film, all I can do is scratch my head and wonder am I just so over-saturated with nearly a lifetime of truly good horror films, that I just can't tolerate over-hyped movies with the same tired concepts? ""Light's Out"" starts off pretty well, but honestly, half-way through, my focus went to my Cat licking her paws. Honestly, that little red tongue flicking in and out was more terrifying than what was on my 50"" Plasma screen at the moment. The story of some 'thing' that terrorizes you if the lights go out isn't exactly original, but in the right hands, it could have been as scary as all the hype seemed to indicate and promise. Instead, its just an ok movie with the usual jump-scares, loud bangs and screaming kids. ""Light's Out"" is not necessarily a bad horror film: it's just that there is nothing that special about it. If you liked it, more power to you.",1478304000,,1035,4.476190476190476

In that respect, save yourself the money and watch the trailer. Then, just let your imagination fill in the blanks and I bet you will end up with something more worth your time then this....... thing.",1478131200,8,473,4.630952380952381

I will admit that I screamed a few times too. My husband (who does not get scared at all) was on the edge of his seat the whole time and jumped on more than one occasion. We had to watch some funny YouTube before we could go to bed. I highly recommended this to anyone looking for a REAL horror movie.",1478044800,2,468,4.0978260869565215
5956981,5,B002IDVUJM,"This movie has ruined my reputation. I may jump, shiver, or maybe get the goosebumps from scary movies, I don't scream. As I type this, my dog is still in her cage after my scream scared her. I really enjoyed how simple and straight forward the movie was. There is no extensive build up for 2 hours before it becomes clear that little Samantha is a ghost. Or to find out that yet another Native American tradition has once more been blamed for creating a contact to the spirit world. I appreciate that. Like another person pointed out, it really is as simple as lights on there is nothing there, and lights off means you are about to start talking to the screen, saying things like ""OH, HECK NO!!!"". Now this movie is not for everyone. If you love movies that show pure gruesomeness and decapitations, you will not find it here. If you want a fun, no super quadruple plot twist, straight-to-the-point,  jump scare movie...my friend you have found it.

Side Note about my viewing experience: I love watching movies as much as the next person, but I don't enjoy things that do not add to the movie plot, like nudity and sex scenes. I also don't enjoy ultra-gruesome stuff (especially after witnessing things in real life that don't need to be rehashed).
So while I recommend this movie, I did watch it with VidAngel, so if it has someone chewing another person's arm off, or explicit sex scenes they were filtered.",1478044800,,1412,4.5770750988142295

5956983,5,B002IDVUJM,"This simple but effective horror movie.  seems to do everything exactly right. Lights Out starts by creating a pronounced horrible creature. They establish clear rules for their creature Diana and then run with every conceivable variation on their idea; the movie is full of unexpected surprises.
The characters are believable, smart and use common sense. It's the rare horror movie that shows its audience respect for their intelligence and delivers a quality supernatural entity.",1478044800,3,481,5.5
5956984,5,B002IDVUJM,"I came, expecting this movie to hit all the marks and it did. Bravo! David Sandberg delivers a creepy thriller horror ride that makes this film stand out from the crowd. He avoids throwing in gut scares, scary visuals, and terror just for the hell of it. He uses them in the right way and at the precise right time. He takes things that can be creepy, mannequins, foggy mirrors,  the dark, flickering lights, glowing eyes, fright-filled eyes, darkened hallways, et al and strings them together in the right combination to give you chills. This is a masterful psychological thriller that plays on an elemental fear of the dark and what is in the dark. It had aspects of Babadook, the Conjuring 2, and Mama.  Lights This is a stand-out film.
The cast handles their roles with finesse and much emotion: Maria Bello is Sophie, the fear-stricken and emotionally unstable mother; Teresa Palmer is Rebecca, the rebellious and emotionally-guarded daughter; Gabriel Batemen is Martin, the scared but brave son; Alexander DiPersia plays Bret, the good-natured and supportive boyfriend; and Alicia Vela-Bailey plays the menacing evil entity, Diana. Diana is a shadowy female with matted hair, glowing eyes and talon-like fingers. This film has tons of undertones that will rise tot he surface for different viewers. but, they all work and are plausible. This film will creep you out but you will revel in the fear it evokes.",1478044800,,1413,4.957805907172996

I will admit when I saw the original teasers for this film I was not impressed and even heard some negative feedback from people who had seen it, but when I read some reviews on here and re-watched the trailer I had to see it and am glad I did. To say much about this movie would give so much away, but what I will say is this...

A disturbed mother of two who has had her fair share of troubles with her adult daughter and previous marriage is trying to hang on to her sanity. She has a friend and confidant in ""Diana"" and when Diana does not like someone there is hell to pay.

Take my word for it this movie has some good scares, some great acting by the cast and a nice storyline here that works well.  Usually when you see on the title ""From the creators of......"" it is usually garbage that they are trying to see but this movie is worth seeing and not just because the people behind the Conjuring have made it.
Good action, good scares and while I am not sure it deserves a sequel it def could stand on its own and a non sequel movie.",1477785600,8,1077,4.066037735849057

5957050,2,B002IDVUJM,"There are some good ""jump scares"" in this film, which seems to run about 10 minutes too long. It seems like the story was ""written backwards"" from an idea or short treatment, and this shows clearly in some of the convoluted backstory. Why are there two fathers in the haunted family? How could a ghost kill one father, Rebecca's father, and his death not be explained to the family, instead, referring to him as ""disappeared""? How can the second father, the stepfather, be murdered by a ghost in his factory, but there is no real mention of this in the film----no investigation, nothing?
What are the odds that a young girl is mentally ill and institutionalized AND has a rare, unknown skin disease?
In classic ghost stories, the ghost cannot hurt the protagonists . . .the ghost exists to haunt or send a message . . . ""Lights out"" seems to violate this premise over and over.

5957081,1,B002IDVUJM,"I've never written a movie review, but wanted to warn anyone who is considering watching this movie.
It's pretty bad...the worst ""horror"" movie I've watch and not scary at all.  The cliches are comin' atcha from a mile away.  And for characters who should be truly terrified, and watching over the young boy, they go through scenes where they have smiles, jokes and kisses.  You can wait for Prime and can actually keep it on in the background while you do your taxes it's SO not scary and boring... you won't be distracted.

The best part of this movie is the closing credits, they are interesting and kept me attention the entire time.  They are very creative and well-done.

Oh, and Mario Bello?  I've seen her in good movies, ""History of Violence"" and she was really good.  Here she was not at her best, imo.",1477612800,3,812,4.551724137931035

5957087,3,B002IDVUJM,"Lights Out is based on a three-minute short film by David Sandberg. With no dialogue, no character development, and no particular narrative, the film concentrated on the element of fear. An anonymous young woman in her own apartment sees a mysterious silhouette whenever the lights are out but sees nothing unusual when the lights are on. Expanding this premise into a feature film has its problems.

 The opening sequence duplicates in style the original short, except that the setting is a factory after hours rather than an apartment. Employee Esther (Lotta Losten, who starred in the short) sees a mysterious figure in the dark that disappears whenever the lights come back on and moves closer to her when they go back out again. Its a creepy, suspenseful scene that sets up the story to follow.

Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) thought she left her childhood fears behind when she left home. Growing up, she was never really sure of what was and wasn't real when the lights went out, and now her little brother, Martin (Gabriel Bateman), is experiencing the same inexplicable and terrifying events that had once challenged her sanity and threatened her safety. A frightening entity with a mysterious attachment to their mother, Sophie (Maria Bello), has reemerged.

The films eerie ambience and juxtaposition of dark images with light does succeed in convincing us that malevolence lurks in the shadows, but there is little attempt to build characters. And, as in many B-grade horror flicks, characters make dopey decisions regarding danger. In this case, they constantly gravitate to locations shrouded in darkness even though they know thats where peril lies. At only 81 minutes, it still feels padded to sustain and stretch a good idea way too long. To obtain a PG-13 rating, the director kept the scares tepid relative to what an R rating would have permitted.

The sole bonus feature on the Blu-ray release is a series of deleted scenes.",1477440000,,1939,5.009316770186335

When the visions return in Rebecca's house she wants to find a way to stop them once and for all, but when she realizes what the origin of the vision is she faces the hardest decision of her life. This is a movie I was not looking forward to but my daughter was. I am not a huge fan of horror but she is. I open with that to tell you this we both fell asleep watching this a couple times. The idea of this is decent enough but the movie is essentially nothing more than people flicking a light switch over and over and over while you are waiting for the same thing to happen over and over and over. The beginning 10 minutes is creepy and good but then it quickly dies down. The movie is only about 80 minutes long but it felt much much longer. Overall, fans of horror may enjoy this, but as for me I found it a real struggle to get into and found it too boring and repetitive to be scary. I give this a C-.",1477267200,,1183,4.125541125541125

5957146,4,B002IDVUJM,"Lights Out is an extended metaphor about dysfunctional families disguised as a Yurei movie. The premise is that this family is being haunted by a ghoul that can only manifest in the dark. The plot is unwinding why this ghoul has attached itself to this family, and what the surviving members decide to do about it. Maria Bello and Teresa Palmer are incredibly well-cast as the troubled mother and estranged daughter in this scenario. Gabriel Bateman is also very good as the little brother. The movie isn't really long enough to attach deeply to any of the characters, but it makes the most of some very brief flashbacks to bring the audience in on what's been happening. The film also has the excellent atmospherics you would expect out of a James Wan production. Aside from the too-brief running time leading to sketched out character writing, the only problems are an about-face from one character that would be harder to believe if not for the acting talents of the person playing her, and the tendency for people to keep flipping off the lights over and over after they see a creepy shadow lady stalking them.

The simple premise of a monster that only appears in darkness is nothing short of brilliant, having invented a flawless realization of afraid of the dark.

But the creature that lurks in the shadow is also nicely wedded to a captivating story about loss, maturity, sanity and family. This horror entry does not meet the high-water intelligence of other recent genre classics like It Follows, Babadook, or The Witch, but it certainly strives to say a lot more than the average flick content with jump scares.

5957159,5,B002IDVUJM,"Expectations were low, but this is far superior to the Insidious, Conjuring, and spin-off movies.  The best mainstream theatrical horror release I've seen in some time.

5957160,3,B002IDVUJM,"This movie was predictable and not really what I had hoped it would be. After The Insidious franchise, Annabelle, and both Conjuring films, I became a huge fan of James Wan very quickly. He DID not Direct THIS MOVIE... I GET THAT!! His name is still attached to it as Producer, and he is still a very talented Director, as I've stated many times before, and one of the few still left who actually understands HORROR. My opinion has not changed on that! However, this movie is just not what I expected. You can see the ending coming a mile away. I guess I would have bought the whole ""evil imaginary friend"" plot if Dianna were actually Martin's ""friend"" instead of Sophie's. Honestly, Martin (Gabriel Bateman) was the best thing about this movie. That little boy carries the weight of this movie on his shoulders, which is surprising since Maria Bello is such a seasoned actress. Don't get me wrong, she didn't do a ""bad"" job, but I expected more from her. To be fair, I guess that really wasn't her fault though since she was doing the best she could with what she was given. On the flip side of that, this also goes to show you that James Wan also has a way with picking wonderful children actors. Gabriel Bateman carries this movie the same way Dalton (Ty Simpkins) shines in the Insidious films. Pretty much the same way Janet (Madison Wolfe) shines in The Conjuring 2.

To provide some more info, the film pretty much consists of four people (5 if you include the entity). Sophie, her two children (Martin and Rebecca), and Rebecca's ""boyfriend."" Quite frankly, Billy Burke's character isn't even worth mentioning to me as his ""Twilight"" (pun intended) is snuffed out in the first scene of the movie. Anyway, as an honorable mention, he plays Sophie's husband, and Dianna wants him out of the way. Who is Dianna? I'm glad you asked! She's Sophie's childhood imaginary friend, only she's not really imaginary. I guess it would be fair to say she's a ghost since technically she was once a real person, and former patient, who Sophie met in the mental hospital that she stayed in as a child. Dianna had a severe reaction to light, and apparently attached herself to Sophie very quickly as the two became ""friends."" Obviously, once Dianna died she remained attached to Sophie as her only link to this realm, thus, Sophie's fate is Dianna's since they are interconnected. You can already see where this is going, can't you? At any rate, Dianna wants Sophie all to herself so she can exercise full control over her ensuring her existence. Dianna refuses to go away, so she's forcing her to sever all ties with anybody who could possibly keep her on her medication, or keep her sane. If Sophie refuses to get rid of them, then Dianna takes care of them for her, which is why her husband had to go. This is also why Martin and Rebecca must also go as they are the only things in this world keeping Sophie sane enough to even go against Dianna.

Don't get me wrong, I really dig this concept, although, I do agree that it does have a lot of similarities to films like Darkness Falls and They. I think I can forgive that since all Directors seem to ""borrow"" concepts from each other, so the execution is what I look for now more than concept because there's really nothing new under the sun these days. Let's be honest... Most of us have seen it all!

Overall, this movie wasn't the best, but it certainly wasn't the worst. It has its problems, but I left the movie feeling good about it. It was a good way to kill a little time on a Saturday evening with my husband. With that said, it's also not something I was very impressed with. It was just okay!!",1472774400,3,3649,4.509063444108762
5957161,4,B002IDVUJM,"This is a pretty good flick. I saw it in theaters, which added to the scare factor. You have to watch this movie with no lights on, which should go without saying! This is a pretty fresh concepts and they execute it well. It is legitimately pretty frightening, which is getting more and more rare for a PG-13/any horror movie these days. Definitely worth checking out.",1472774400,3,368,4.590909090909091
5957162,2,B002IDVUJM,"Rebecca left home as soon as she could because her mother was strange, abusive, and refused treatment for her mental illness. Now, her stepfather recently died and her mother's condition has worsened. She's called to her little brother's school because he's fallen asleep in class numerous times. After trying to reason with her mother, she takes the boy to her apartment where she's sees a dark figure in the shadows carving things in her floor. The memories as a child of her mother's imaginary friend Diana are real and she has to protect her little brother from her at all costs.

Lights Out starts out looking promising. The scenes at the mannequin warehouse are tense and creepy. However, having the lights go on and off with Diana appearing in the darkness gets old after the first couple of times. Because of Diana's aversion to it, light is used very purposefully in a variety of ways: candles, flashlights, neon signs, gunshots, car headlights, black light, and others. The gunshots were a particularly ingenious idea. Diana would disappear for the split second that the gun would flash and then reappear as soon as it was gone. I wish that attention to detail was present through the whole film. I grew frustrated that all of these characters had cell phones with perfectly good bright lights on them, but no one ever used them. Once, a character used the screen as a light, but it's so dim, why not use the flashlight on it?

The characters are much more interesting than I expected. I grew to like and respect Rebecca. Her chosen aesthetic of goth skulls and black clothing is a bit cliche and screams emo. I wrote her off early as attention seeking, but she really pulled through for her brother and her mother. When a CPS worker suggests that she would be an unfit guardian because of her style and the art she chose to have in her apartment, I was outraged for her. Her boyfriend Bret proved to also be way more endearing than I expected. As a love interest, he persevered in a cute way to establish them as a long-term couple. In many movies, this comes off as controlling and creepy, but he would ultimately stand by her side until she made the decision in her own time. He was also very understanding of her situation and went above and beyond to help her.

Rebecca's mother Sophie is incredibly frustrating because she doesn't see how toxic and deadly her relationship with Diana has always been. Diana is on obvious personification of mental illness and seeks to destroy anything that Sophie loves. She stood by for years while Diana mentally and physically abused both of her children. A few things annoyed me about Diana. She is a two dimensional character with one motivation. I was hoping for a heartbreaking backstory or at least some sort of sense that she's an actual person, but she was this way since childhood for no apparent reason. Diana is completely revealed near the end of the film and it would have been better if she was kept in shadow. Showing too much of the monster is never a good idea. Diana's rules never seem to be concrete. Sometimes she can make lights go out and sometimes she can't. Black light reveals her for some reason and keeps her from disappearing. Although she hates the light, she can sometimes grab people while she's fully in light. The ending is atrocious and the logic around it is dubious at best.

Lights Out demonstrates an interesting concepts, but has a lot of flaws that include inconsistent rules of their creature, revealing too much, ignoring ubiquitous technology, and everything about the ending. It was better than I was expecting, but my expectations were set pretty low. It's a typical PG-13 supernatural film that stays squarely within the conventions of its genre. I would say this is a good intro to horror, but seasoned fans will be bored and frustrated.",1472601600,6,3835,4.710879284649776

I know that the director is making the <Annabelle 2 > under the court of the other great director JAMES WAN but I say the director DAVID F. SANDBERG is 200% greater then JAMES WAN it's just that he just made one single movie so far.

5957167,4,B002IDVUJM,"This was not the best scary movie that I have seen, but for a one time watch I thought it was very impressive and good. The movie does not rely on the jumps you expect from mainstream scary movies where it's all just loud noises that make you jump, the movie instead based it on more of a creepy uncomfortable feeling.
The antagonist is only able to act upon the living when it is in darkness, light will make the antagonist disappear. Keeping everything in the dark already plays upon the fear that everyone has of the dark and the figures that are usually turned into a coat rack in real life are suddenly personified into something that is real.
Overall, I found this movie very good. I would not watch it multiple times but for the one time I saw it I was not able to figure out the ending, and I was kept intrigued through the whole movie. It is not cheesy scares, even though some of the lines can get a little cheesy like any normal scary movie.

Theres really not much substance to this story.  Martin (Gabriel Bateman; Annabelle) is a little boy living with his clearly mentally ill mother (Maria Bello; Secret Window, Demonic) andlets just say that her actions (or inaction, neglect, what have you) leave Martin fearing for his life, deathly afraid of the dark and falling asleep.

Having fled their mother years earlier over similar issues, Martins much older adult sister Rebecca (Teresa Palmer; Warm Bodies, Wolf Creek, The Grudge 2) steps in to protect Martin from their mothers manic neglect and maybe something more.

It turns out that nightmares from Rebeccas past are being relived by young Martin, who in turn has resurrected their evils attention to Rebecca.  And that evil is something vile!

I was very pleased with the acting, good production value, and I thought the effects were everything they needed to be.  Nothing seemed wanting, nor was there any need or desire for gore.  Despite being limited to shadowy figures most of the time, our wicked phantom looked pretty awesomely creepy and, on that note, the creepy atmosphere was pretty effective.

If this movie feels a bit familiar to you, you're not alone.  I felt like our evil ghost twitched and burped about in the shadows a lot like Mama (2013) doing her best impression of The Grudge (2004) ghost, the mother had a slew of psychological issues like our favorite abusive mom in The Babadook (2014), and those close links between our victims fear of the dark reminded me a bit of The Boogeyman (2005) or, since James Wan (The Conjuring 1-2, Insidious 1-2) is this films producer, perhaps even Dead Silence (2007) when we see our haggish specters face.  You might even feel some echoes of A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) in therethere were more than a few parallels.

Playfully renewing our fear of the dark with a series of predictable yet highly enjoyable jump scares, director David F. Sandbergs (Annabelle 2) first feature length horror film pretty much plays it safe and by the numbers.  But you know what?  Sometimes thats okay.  Nothing great about this film, but I really enjoyed it.  It was fun and Id recommend it for a good popcorn horror night or fun scary movie date night.

This director handled his first mainstream horror gig very well, he embraced Wans horror influence, and Im excited to see whatever he does next.",1471132800,5,2626,4.902714932126697
5957170,5,B002IDVUJM,"""Lights Out"" is great. This is how the story goes: When Rebecca left home, she thought she left her childhood fears behind. Growing up, she was never really sure of what was and wasn't real when the lights went out...and now her little brother, Martin, is experiencing the same unexplained and terrifying events that had once tested her sanity and threatened her safety. A frightening entity with a mysterious attachment to their mother, Sophie, has reemerged. But this time, as Rebecca gets closer to unlocking the truth, there is no denying that all their lives are in danger...once the lights go out.

The cast led by Teresa Palmer (as Rebecca) is great. The directing by David F. Sandberg is great. The screenplay (based on the short film by Sandberg) by Eric Heisserer (who also produced) is great.

The music by Benjamin Wallfisch is great. The cinematography by Marc Spicer is great. The film editing by Kirk M. Morri & Michel Aller is great. The casting by Rich Delia is great. The production design by Jennifer Spence is great. The art direction by Shannon Kemp is great. The set decoration by Lisa Son, set dressings by Kyle Davio, Thomas Gerhardt, Christina & Colby Giovacchini is great. The costume design by Kristin M. Burke is great. The prosthetic make-up effects designed by Matthew W. Mungle are great. The special effects supervised by Mark R. Byers is great. The visual effects supervised by Peter Crosman & Steffen Reichstadt is great. The stunts coordinated by Mark Norby are great.

This is a great, well-done, well-crafted horror-thriller that is entertaining and well-made. David F. Sandberg has made an impressive directorial debut with the big-screen film version of his short film. This is one of the best films of the summer season and is also one of the best horror films of the year, so far. It is also one of the better movies of the year & summer season, as well, too.",1470787200,3,1900,4.804281345565749
5957171,4,B002IDVUJM,"Paul (Billy Burke) has it all. A pretty wife Sophie (Maria Bello) who talks to herself, a great kid Martin (Gabriel Bateman), and a killer ghost Diana (Alicia Vela-Bailey) haunting him when the lights go out. Unfortunately for Paul, it's lights out in the first scene. Diana can't survive in the light. Diana and Sophie have an old relationship...a thrill on Mulberry Hill mental institute. Grown daughter Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) comes to help out and solve the plot.

The film is short jump scares with a creepy dark figure, over and over again.

Guide: No swearing sex, or nudity. Good one for kids to see right before bed time. 3 1/2 stars",1470528000,,642,4.723214285714286
5957172,5,B002IDVUJM,"This was a great movie. When I saw it, it scared the s*** out of me. I made my roommate keep the lights on all night cause i was so scared. But i can't wait for it to come out on dvd! If you like scary movies, i recommend this one.",1470268800,4,231,3.549019607843137
5957173,4,B002IDVUJM,"Horror, like comedy, is subjective; different things scare different people, but one near-universal fear is the unknown.  Since I was a young child Ive been terrified of the dark.  As an adult I still am quick to jump when things go bump in the night.  Could someone be in my house?  Is it even human?!  I won't lie: my imagination runs wild in the dark.  Not helping my anxious imaginings was a short film released in 2013 by the name of Lights Out.  The short involving a woman stalked by a creature that only moved when the lights were out struck a nerve; it was my greatest childhood fear brought to life through.  I knew this concept would need to makes its way to the silver screen.

Based on his 2013 short, director David F. Sandberg returns to helm the feature-length adaptation of his short about a monster that only moves in the dark, but disappears in the light.  Like the short film, this feature is at its best when it plays up the audiences fear of the unseen.  Yes, it mostly falls on repetition of the same scare (monster pops out of the dark), Sandberg never wears out the novelty of his monster.  I was also surprised by the quality of the script.  What could have easily been a haphazardly assembled excuse to jump-scare the audience actually manages to create an interesting (albeit somewhat silly) back-story for its creature, and characters who I could actually support instead of the brain dead assortment of characters that typically populate this sort of film.

W Lights Out isn't without its flaws.  The monster design isn't particularly original, and the voice they gave her is that generic, raspy voice that every evil creature has had since Linda Blair was possessed in The Exorcist over 40 years ago.  No design would have likely lived up to the audiences expectation, but, regardless, I was disappointed by the design they opted for.  The rules for when the creature can and cannot move also vary between sequences.

If you're looking for a brisk, effective fright fest, you're certain to enjoy Lights Out.  While not quite reaching the frightening heights of the two Conjuring films, or matching the psychological horror of comparable horror films like The Babadook, Lights Out is a standout modern horror film.  This is an effective feature-debut for David F. Sandberg, successfully translating the frights of his short to the big screen without sacrificing the humanity of the films characters for the sake of cheap scares.",1470009600,6,2458,4.793349168646081

It's a relatively short movie but the action starts within the first five minutes. No slow introductory lines for this flick. These days scary movie plot lines don't have a lot of character development but this one does. You can see where each family member is coming from. Now I'm not going to lie, there are still a few cliches here and there but they managed to skip some of the obvious ones. People in the theater were screaming but not me though. However after watching this the first time I was checking over my shoulder in the dark a lot.",1469836800,8,651,4.3884297520661155

5957178,3,B002IDVUJM,"I'm sorry, but this wasn't as great or as scary as I hoped it would be. It felt pretty generic. I've seen scarier PG-13 movies, such as 'Ouija' The jump scares were okay, but didn't last very long. I'm actually surprised it's getting such high ratings. A woman named Sophie suffers from mental illness which somehow causes her supernatural ghost friend, Diana to roam around when the lights are out. Diana begins to get meaner and more dangerous and goes after Sophie's kid, Rebecca and Martin. If you love ghost stories, you might like LIGHTS OUT!!!",1469491200,,550,4.739583333333333
5957179,5,B002IDVUJM,"The short freaked me out, man. The trailers freaked me out. So, of course, I had to go see the feature film. Lights Out is fantastic indie fare, but it's also an event horror film that you MUST see in the theater with a packed house. So much collective panic attacks and gasps of ""Oh hell no's"" and unsolicited advice from the audience to the characters onscreen. As you and I know, Lights Out is an expansion of Swedish director David F. Sandberg's terrifying 2013 short video that went viral on the Internet and was infamous for having visited traumas and nightmares on many a viewer. That short - around 2 1/2 minutes long - seriously unnerved me.

So, now, here's David F. Sandberg in his major directorial debut, and, at last, his knowing many ways to turn the light on and off comes in handy. The premise is simple: When the lights are out, there's something there; when the lights are on, there's nothing there. The initial thinking was can such a micro-movie's one-note premise be stretched into a full-length motion picture? Yes, oh hell yes.

The Conjuring 2 was a really good scarefest; some folks even prefer it to the original Conjuring movie. I tell you Lights Out is scarier than The Conjuring 2. Part of what makes Lights Out such a boss movie is that you care for the characters. The script exhibits its share of hackneyed moments, but what it does really well is show respect for its characters, and that's reflected in its dramatization of the fractured family dynamics. It's a taut family drama that works in concert with the horror elements.  And, for the most part, the characters don't make bad choices. There's really no secret in making a good movie. Don't dumb down the story, snag good actors. Lights Out has really good actors, names you recognize instead of a roster of unheard-ofs.

Oh, man, the family tension. In downtown L.A. Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) lives above a tattoo parlor, estranged from her most unusual mom, Sophie (Maria Bello). Rebecca comes back to the fold only when she finds out that her 10-year-old half-brother Martin (Gabriel Bateman) keeps falling asleep in class. Martin confides to Rebecca that their mother, who's had a history of mental illness, had relapsed into having conversations in the dark with her creepy imaginary friend. She's just not okay. So it's Rebecca to the rescue, or so she thinks.

To repeat, I picked a lousy time to quit using night lights. This movie primes your over-active imagination. It taps into your primal fears, fear of being abandoned, fear of insanity, fear of the dark. There's that extra twist of the knife in that, this time, it's the grown-up, the person you turn to in times of distress, that's wigging out - and it's the kids who have to handle business.

From start to finish, I was in a state of heightened anxiety. Never mind the familiar components in this creep show, Sandberg is effortless in setting up an unsettling atmosphere. He composes his jump scares very well. And because the script handles the characters so deftly - and you've gotten invested in them - the jump scares feel earned. There's creativity and even ingenuity manifested onscreen. Lights on, you're safe. Lights out, oboy. Whoever handled the lighting design and the photography work - Sandberg? - needs a pay bump. Just how many ways can you confound someone frantically trying to stay lit? Light bulbs flicker, batteries expire, that red neon light outside blinks on but also off, the glow off a cell phone screen is negated by fumbly fingers... So stressful.

The cast is stellar. Maria Bello is a longtime fave of mine. She's a classy actress. Her performance - vacillating between maternal and twitchy and tormented - goes some ways into feeding the tension. Teresa Palmer, I'm surprised she's not more of an A-lister because the potential is there. The two surprises for me are Alexander DiPersia and child actor Gabriel Bateman. DiPersia sidesteps the formulaic throwaway boyfriend role. He parlays the clich into this thing where you end up rooting for him. Bateman is probably the movie's secret weapon. Just watch the scene where his mom has got an iron grip on him, divulging the history of her frightening imaginary friend. The kid is fantastic.

Or maybe the secret weapon is stunt actress Alicia Vela-Bailey who you mostly see in alarming silhoutte as the mom's friend, Diana. She's got a gymnastics background that she puts to good effect as the light-sensitive apparition. Her feral, spider-like physicality induced all kinds of goosebumps.

Lights Out follows the Blumhouse Studios trend. Made on a shoestring budget of $5 mil, it's already raked in $30 million globally, after only four days of release. That's impressive, considering most of this movie comprises a lot of creeping around and peeking around corners. I think positive word-of-mouth gives this movie an extended box office life. Preying on our common fears and universal phobias, it goes to show how invaluable an inspired gimmick is. The Weeping Angels would approve.",1469491200,86,5022,4.878077373974208
