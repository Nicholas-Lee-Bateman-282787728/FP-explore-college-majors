Great guest stars in each movie. Effective sets, from Kirk's apartment to the Genesis planet to the Bird-of-Prey interiors. Enterprise and space dock look great. Picture quality gets four stars. Blu-ray is definite improvement from standard DVD releases, though occasional artifacts are embarrassingly visible and should have been cleaned up. Extras are nicely done, both original interviews and other material newly recorded for Blu-ray release.  So enjoyable watching these movies on HDTV in Blu-ray.",1458691200,2,663,5.835051546391752

3789534,5,B001TH16D8,"It's nice and convenient to have a 3 disc blu ray set that happens to feature 2 of the 3 best Star Trek movies with the original cast members. This set was released as episodes 2-4 simply because it's a story arc that started with The Wrath of Khan and finished with The Voyage Home. The picture and sound quality are pristine, and the special features are great. Best of all, the price is fairly modest, so go ahead and indulge in 2 of the 3 best Star Trek movies (in my opinion), while enjoying a new viewing experience. Just for fun, here's how I rank the first 6 Star Trek movies:
1. The Wrath of Khan (easily)
2. The Undiscovered Country
3. The Voyage Home
4. The Search for Spock

These days I am not too picky or into determining if the movies have been improperly edited, are missing certain scenes or don't have enough bonus features. Dont get me wrong, I really wish companies who release such discs would keep all original footage, but it's just that for most movies like this, I just don't watch them that closely to notice if scenes are missing. Also, I just don't usually  care to watch too many bonus features. So, I cannot comment from those perspectives on these discs - all may be fine, I just don't know.

3789558,2,B001TH16D8,"Amazon may never allow this review to see the light of day, but it's got to be written anyway: no one should have to buy three separate DVD's in order to find the ""Director's Cut"" of Star Trek: The Motion Picture.

  There are some die-hard fans of The Original Series who fully understand why a director's cut of this film would be necessary, perhaps even preferable. In a word, Robert Wise's original film is interminable, and generally lacking in the character emphasis department.

  Without going through the entire list, the Klingon's first attack of ""the cloud"" and the ""thing"" inside runs a bit long, even for those who believe the world is ultimately a better place with fewer Klingons in it. I don't know if Wise shortened the sequence in the ""Cut"" version (I haven't seen it yet: it's on order, about which more in a minute), but it could definitely use some pruning.

  Second, the ""Introduction Of The Enterprise"" (the longest introduction of an inanimate object in the entire history of film), which includes every conceivable angle of the starship (and Kirk, we might as well add, sometimes ALSO an inanimate object) that one could possibly imagine, and then some, needs to come in at something under 40 minutes. OK, I'm exaggerating, but, not to put too fine a point on it, there are any number of things we could mention that are a lot more enjoyable that don't last anywhere near as long.

  Finally, because this has gone on enough already, the scene in which McCoy mispronounces ""Kolinar"" is just inane, particularly since fans of TOS are aware that McCoy knows how to pronounce Kolinar perfectly well, unless he got suddenly stupid from shaving off his beard (and what was up with THAT, by the way? The guys in makeup didn't have enough to DO? ""Oh, I know what...."").

  All this being said, there are probably (what with regular, Blu-ray, re-mastered, classic, et al, and what-haven't-you) six hundred and thirty-one separate and distinct versions currently available for Star Trek: The Motion Picture, probably more than there are for Citizen Kane.

  Unfortunately, as many consumers already know, Amazon has acquired a bad habit of including some of the same advertising blurbs and the same reviews for every Star Trek: The Motion Picture no matter what the version, which, for this as well as other products of the same ilk, is misleading to the point of misrepresentation. If you are, in fact, looking for the ""Director's Cut,"" do not buy the ""green faces, left"" box or the ""full color faces across the middle"" package, despite what you may conclude by reading the blurbs or the first reviews: both of these contain the endless version originally released in theaters.

  The ""Director's Cut"" (unfortunately there seems to be no blu-ray edition) is the one in what I will call the ""rainbow box"" for thirty-five bucks or so. From hard experience, I bought the other two and am just now sending them back, as they are virtually frame-for-frame identical. I can't wait to see if the ""Director's Cut"" has actually improved the film.

  I really DO need to get a life....",1406332800,,3093,4.8143939393939394

3789560,5,B001TH16D8,"Great way to dive into the original cast Star Trek movies. I'm actually a relative newcomer to Star Trek and I actually got started with this collection myself. You get three films in this collection, hence the trilogy: 'The Wrath of Khan', 'The Search for Spock' and 'The Voyage Home'. They may be parts 2, 3 and 4 of the film series overall but they form a collective whole as events in each film carry on into the next. 'The Search for Spock' is a bit weak, admittedly, and certainly not a film I'd recommend on its own merits, but the strength of 'The Wrath of Khan' and 'The Voyage Home' more than make up for this. Think of it as a double movie pack with a third movie thrown in as a bonus feature.",1405468800,,704,4.222222222222222

3789576,4,B001TH16D8,"I am a huge fan the modern Star Trek's created my J.J. Abrams genius, which I have to say will be shared ontothe Star Wars universe. Afte watching Star Trek: Into Darkness, and I was blown away. The crowd when nuts when the villain revealed his name to be Khan. I was sure this had something to do with Khan from the previous movie title, ""The Wrath of Khan."" That week, I ordered this on Amazon.

I thought the movies were highly entertaining, yet completely different from the modern movies. The originals have good action, and a lot of humor. The acting was great along with great special effects.",1382918400,,600,4.504587155963303
3789577,4,B001TH16D8,"This review is for the blu-ray of the ""Motion Picture Trilogy"", which I call the ""Genesis Trilogy"", because all three of these movies feature the Genesis experiment, and its ultimate failure, as the common unifying thread of their subplots.

Trek II looks and sounds phenomenal, with an even richer color pallette and deeper audio than I even remember experiencing in cinemas.

As others have adeptly pointed out, Trek III and IV have been ""de-grained"" using digital noise reduction (DNR) to get rid of their film grain and then ""edge-enhanced"" to artificially restore a sense of detail.  This results in a picture that looks smooth and yet artificially fringey.  III and IV could look better, but they ARE high-def and have definitely looked worse (I remember them in the old laserdisc days in pan and scan before letterboxing!).

Still, the passion and entertainment value of III and IV is so rich that it shines through, and the visuals, while not quite as true to the cinema experience as they could be, still look nice.  At the current 2013 apparently clearout price, perhaps to make room for more properly restored versions of III and IV, I had to splurge.  At this price, I'll enjoy these movies until Paramount does a proper restoration of III and IV, and I'll wait for the price to drop again and splurge again; no big deal.

Highly recommended!",1382313600,2,1354,4.8311688311688314

The movies themselves are wonderful, with The Wrath of Khan being a personal favourite. Spock plays a huge part in these movies (although mostly the second one for obvious reasons), but the rest of the cast has their spectacular moments.

So, when I watched these three 1980's Star Trek movies on this player, I was very pleased with the appearance of the films indeed!  After watching these flicks in years past, on VHS and on the ""Syfy"" Channel, these digitally re-mastered DVD's were just the ticket........as far as I am concerned.

Perhaps it's because I do not have a ""Blu-Ray"" player, on which to make quality comparisons with.  We do have a 46-inch Sharp ""Aquos"" (HD-1080p/i), however; which combined with this upconvert DVD player produces outstanding quality reproduction of regular DVD's (not to mention any channel broadcasting in H.D.!).

3789646,5,B001TH16D8,"I truly understand why they did release this Star Trek Trilogy as they did.  These three stories belong together.  This is a high quality, very entertaining trilogy that left out all the surrounding garbage (two of the other movies) that I wouldn't ever want to watch again anyway.

Star Trek: The Motion(less) Picture is boring as all hell. And Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, was absolutely the worst of the entire Star Trek motion picture franchise. You will notice that Star Trek I and V are not even released separately.  But, yet they had the good sense to release Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country as it's own separate release.

I'm happy to have this Star Trek Trilogy as it's own separate entity (all three of these stories that belong together).  And buying Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is perfect as it own separate lone story with the original Star Trek cast, and serving as a departure for the original cast.

I wouldn't bother buying Star Trek I or V on their own because they did truly absolutely sucked!

I was thrilled to find that all three are in a set together.  After all, they are continuous.  Star Trek 2 is perhaps the very best Star Trek movie made.  It is based off one of the original series episodes. Captain Kirk has to make a lot of decisions.  This movies shows the long term consequence of a particular decision.  Star Trek 3, The Search for Spock is the weakest of the trilogy, but since it is the middle act, it needs to be watched.  After all you can't leave Spock dead.  Star Trek IV The Voyage Home is the movie that appeals the most to non Star Trek fans.

3789651,5,B001TH16D8,"Ahhh, a true science fiction tale told through a fantastic film. Again, I had to convince myself it was 1979, and ignore the special effects that have been achieved since then.  But I really don't need to ignore those cgi advancements to enjoy a film such as this one.  It was told during what I like to consider the golden age of sci fi.  Where thanks to 'star wars' stories/scripts once deemed unfilmable were now possible.  You don't see today's sci fi films having such a fascinating story like this.  Foster and Livingston did a fine job.  It was great to see the original cast together again.  By 79's standards this film is top notch, and still should be considered in that way today.  I'd like to also add that I thought Persis Khambatta was amazing in her role.  It's too bad I didn't see her in anything else too relevant.  And I was sorry to hear about her passing in the late nineties.

Oh and the blu ray edition of this film is fantastic!!  The picture/audio quality were so superb that I could not believe my eyes and ears.

3789653,5,B001TH16D8,"When ""The Wrath of Khan"" first appeared in theaters, someone said to me, ""This is Trek as it should have been done on TV, but with enough money to do it right.""  The same could be said of all three of the movies in this set, which indeed form an ""epic 3-part adventure,"" as the sleeve copy has it.

""Wrath"" is probably my second-favorite sf movie of all time (the first, by a mile, being&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Episode-IV-A-New-Hope-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0006VIE4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars, Episode IV- A New Hope (Widescreen Edition)</a>).  We find Jim Kirk, owing to the nature of military promotion schedules, grounded on Earth, having been kicked upstairs to an admiralty, while his officers--Spock (now captain of the aging Enterprise), Scotty, Dr. McCoy, Sulu, Uhura, Chekhov--have all risen along with him and moved on to other assignments.  McCoy, who knows his old friend well, advises him to ""get back your command,"" but it isn't till he goes out on a training flight with a crew of about-to-graduate cadet trainees that Kirk has a chance to do so.  Chekhov, aboard the small starship Reliant, has inadvertantly rediscovered Khan Noonian Singh (Ricardo Montalban) and the survivors of his ""genetically engineered"" followers on Ceti Alpha V, and Khan has taken over the Reliant to have his revenge on Kirk, whom he blames for the deaths of most of his group, killed by the sudden environmental changes brought about by a shift in the planet's orbit.  When Khan finds out about the existence of the Genesis Project, helmed by Kirk's old lover Dr. Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch) and their son David (Merritt Butrick), he determines to possess it--and to use it as bait to lure Kirk within reach.  The duel that follows is classic action sf, with beautiful effects (3-D starfields, Station Regula I backlit by the glow of a nebula, a wonderful matte of the Genesis Cave, the Mutara Nebula glowing multi-colored with auroras and thunderstorms, gas and dust, all the space-battle scenes, and the crippled Reliant being among the best) and a splendidly thunderous James Horner music 'track (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-II-The-Wrath-of-Khan/dp/B002IAPHK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</a>).  See if, like me, you find new things to notice on each viewing (it took me several of the dozen times I saw it in the theater to pick up on the ruby stud in Saavik's (Kirstie Alley before her weight woes) left ear).  It's also worth noting that you sometimes forget Shatner trained in Shakespearean theater--until you see him, as he does here, registering rage, grief, despair, indeed almost the entire range of human emotion.  Of course, it's clear that this is all happening in another version of human reality, since we know that no ""eugenics wars"" or ""genetic engineering"" took place in *our* ""late 20th century,"" but its vision, as in the original TV show, is both inspiring and thrilling.  (For more details about the characters, especially Saavik and the young cadet Peter Preston (Ike Eisenmann of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Escape-to-Witch-Mountain-Special-Edition/dp/B001NP8WY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Escape to Witch Mountain Special Edition</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-from-Witch-Mountain-Special-Edition/dp/B001NP8WYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return from Witch Mountain Special Edition</a>), read the excellently done paperback tie-in,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-II-The-Wrath-of-Khan/dp/B000C04WHU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan</a>.)

""The Search for Spock"" takes up immediately following the previous film, as Kirk & Co. return to Earth with plans to go back to the Genesis Planet as soon as possible.  David and Saavik (now played by Robin Curtis, of whose career this seems to be the high point) are there ahead of them, and find evidence that Spock, dead of radiation poisoning after saving Enterprise and her crew and buried on the newborn world, may have been ""regenerated"" by the Genesis Wave.  Meanwhile Kirk learns that Enterprise is about to be decommissioned and that the planet is off limits to everyone but the scientists.  Then he receives a visit from Spock's father, Ambassador Sarek (Mark Lenard), who reveals that McCoy--the last person to physically interact with Spock--may well be bearing his ""katra"" (""all that he was, all that he knew""), and suffering personality changes because of it.  This changes many things, and Kirk and his friends hijack the Enterprise out of spacedock and head for Genesis.  Unfortunately, the Klingons--or at least one of them, Capt. Kruge (Christopher Lloyd splendidly villainous, and coughing and barking away in Klingonese as if he'd done it all his life)--know about Genesis too, and are likewise en route.  And the planet is aging ""in surges"" owing to the inclusion of unstable ""protomatter"" in the Genesis Matrix.  Now it's a race against time to get Saavik, David, and the resurrected Spock off the planet before it blows up--and prevent the Klingons from getting any more information about Genesis.  Here again we find a thrilling storyline, lots of gorgeous special effects (contributed, as in STII, by George Lucas's world-famous ILM), and another pulse-hammering score, plus a fine portrayal of the relationships between a group of veteran spacers who've been to the edge of death and back together more times than they can accurately count.  (And rather more humor than in the earlier movie, too, as in Kirk's observation regarding McCoy's reaction to the katra's presence (""I hear he's fruity as a nutcake"") and Scotty's wry explanation of how he was able to prevent pursuit by the transwarp-equipped Excelsior (""The more they fancy up the plumbing, the easier it is to stop up the drain"").)  Other high points include Sarek and the exotic resurrection ritual at Mount Seleyah on Vulcan (featuring Dame Judith Anderson as a Vulcan high priestess).  For this installment, too, Vonda McIntyre supplied a masterful paperback adaptation (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-III-The-Search-for-Spock/dp/B001ASFFTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek III: The Search for Spock</a>).

The trilogy concludes with ""The Voyage Home,"" in which, after three months' exile on Vulcan, Kirk & Co. resolve to return to Earth and face the charges filed against them by Starfleet.  With Enterprise destroyed (spectacularly) in the previous film, they're reduced to using the Klingon bird-of-prey patrol scout they captured over Genesis--but its cloaking device proves to be a great advantage.  They arrive in Earth's system just in time to find it under attack by a mysterious probe, which, Spock suggests, is attempting to contact not humanity but another intelligent race--humpback whales, extinct since the early 21st Century.  To save their world, Kirk's party must travel back in time to the 1980's (""an extremely primitive and paranoid culture,"" observes Kirk), find a whale or two, and bring the creature/s forward to ""talk"" to the probe and call off its attack.  Their attempts to blend in are of course delightful, but the underlying tension never lets up, and there are a couple of near escapes as Chekhov is severely injured trying to harvest protons to regenerate the bird-of-prey's dilithium crystals and the whales they've found conveniently in captivity at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito are released to the wild and spotted by a whaling ship.  Leonard Rosenman's score isn't as good as Horner's work, but the effects are ILM at its best.

3789687,3,B001TH16D8,"Okay so I'm one of the people who was really upset to find out about Paramount's misleading tactic up upconverting a DVD and putting it out on a Blu-ray disc and calling it high definition. Since my one-star review of the six-disc box based on the process used by Paramount to master these, I found this trilogy on sale at my local blue and yellow retailer for $29.99. Hell, for $30.00 I figured Star Trek II is probably worth every penny of that and $10 each for any Blu-ray discs is a bargain so I jumped on the chance. Besides, I had already paid $35 for the laserdisc many years ago, and another $25 for the deluxe DVD version of STII so it's one I know I'll watch over and over again.

I am pleased to report that the quality isn't as bad as I expected. If you can find these movies, despite their being a DVD transfer, especially for around $10 a disc, I can make the recommendation to buy. I've given this trilogy three stars because it does look every bit as good as the DVD versions of I and III.

Star Trek II did look better than the other two, but the sound was really narrow bandwidth with very little bass or treble. THX pm3 studio reference monitors so I'm not an audio neophyte and the audio limitations on this disc were not a factor of my system. I hope they do another remaster of STII with some remastering of the audio because it sounded pretty poor.

In Star Trek III,  was struck by the obvious special effects where I could clear see the cutouts around the film of the Enterprise as it approached space dock. This is the same effect one could see in the original Star Wars before they used computers to spruce up the effects. They used to literally cut film of the ships against a black background and lay that on top of film of the larger frame so you can clearly see the edges of the cutout around the ship as it moves. This movie really needs a computer face-lift and I doubt they'll ever give it that treatment but we can hope.

In short, if you find this trilogy for $30 and you don't already own the DVD versions, I think it's worth the investment. If you already own the DVDs and have to pay more than that, I'm not sure you're going to be thrilled with the investment.",1245369600,,2200,4.253588516746412

I'm not enough of a videophile to comment on the whole DNR thing or the quality of the sources for III and IV.  I think they look good - maybe they could look better.  I don't have that high expectations for movies this old.  I II didn't look *that* much better than III to me, but maybe I don't know what to look for.

However, the disc for III has something going for it - the RDM commentary is awesome.  When he starts you almost expect him to be talking about BSG.  He even pauses for a second like he was going to say that he's the creator of the new Battlestar but catches himself.  His insights and comments are great because he's a fan.  And anyone who's listened to the BSG podcasts knows how good of a storyteller he is.

So why did I buy this set vs all 6?  Simple:

1.  The version of TMP isn't the superior Director's Cut.  I'll wait for that (and I know they have to redo the CGI in HD - it could be a while).
2.  V just...sucked.  Hard.  So did VI.
3.  You know there will be another ""complete"" set out there at some point.

Basically for $33 I got and awesome flick (Khan) with a great restoration plus two other movies I like.  TMP is great but it's pretty cerebral, and this version isn't the one I want.

But if you are the type that couldn't care for the first, fifth and sixth films, then the Motion Picture Trilogy is perfect for you.

These three discs are fantastic and are just loaded with special features.  I do have some personal nitpicks (especially when it comes to DNR usage) but overall, I enjoyed this trilogy release.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

Of the three films featured in this trilogy box set, ""STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN"" is the only film to receive digital remastering to 1080p High Definition form the original negative.  According to the director, the film's negative was in terrible shape and that is why it underwent through extensive restoration.  The film which is 27-years-old, looks very good on Blu-ray.  As expected, there would be noticeable grain but details are much more evident and much sharper than the DVD and LD release.  A good showcase of clarity and detail that definitely is notable with this film on high definition.  Of the three films featured, ""THE WRATH OF KHAN"" has the best picture quality.

The third film ""STAR TREK III: THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK"" gets its 1080p High Definition treatment (aspect ratio of 2:35:1) via a remaster from the 2000 transfer.  The film looks like there was Digital Noise Reduction used as picture quality seems a bit static and detail is not as evident as the second film.  This can lead to debate by some who feel they don't like seeing grain on their films but grain is part of film and thus, the picture quality is not as vibrant as ""THE WRATH OF KHAN"".

For ""STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME"", there appears to be some DNR implemented and there is a bit of a softness as colors seem a bit muted at times.  Outdoor shots, especially sunlight shots in San Francisco is where you will see the vibrancy of colors in the film.  Overall, I actually expected this film to actually look the least bit vibrant in terms of picture quality but overall, on Blu-ray, the film actually seems quite nice and better than expected.

As for audio, all three films are presented in Dolby TrueHD 7.1.  ""STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN"" is a film that although has action scenes, the film showcases clear dialogue and James Horner's music is used effectively to create a mood.  I didn't recall much use of low frequencies through my subwoofer but I did notice the panning from various special effects through my side two channels, use of the warp for the rear surround channels.  Audio is good but during the final scenes with Khan, I was expecting more utilization of audio.  But overall, audio quality was satisfactory.

The audio for ""STAR TREK III: THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK"" actually uses the audio much more effectively than the second film.  Good use of sound coming from the fronts and rears and better usage of low frequencies with the Romulan ship.

As for the audio quality of ""STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME"", also presented with a Dolby TrueHD 7.1 soundtrack and dialogue is clear as well as the 80's music.  This is one film that doesn't really utilize special effects but overall dialogue is clear, especially the schlocky 80's music, the thunder storm and the whale sounds do come alive on the soundtrack.  Again, not much lower frequency usage from the subwoofer, minimal usage from the rear surrounds.  If anything, the film is front channel and your center/side channel usage is where you will notice the audio.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Each of the three discs included with ""STAR TREK - THE MOTION PICTURE TRILOGY"" are loaded with special features that were included on the previous DVD release of each film but also includes a few Blu-ray exclusives.  Included are:

Meyer is an intellect and with each scene he discusses, he will discuss certain classic storylines and how a certain scene in the film would come to play because of his instincts from reading those books.

  * Commentary by Director Nicholas Meyer and Manny Coto - Commentary by Manny Coto (co-executive producer of ""24' and executive producer of ""Enterprise"" and self-professed ""ST: TOS"" fan) and Director Nicholas Meyer.  It's interesting to note that when Meyer took this project to direct, he had never watched ""Star Trek"" before.

JUDGMENT CALL:

These three ""STAR TREK"" films are indeed classics.  I can easily remember watching these films back then and I can tell you that watching ""STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN"" continues to make me laugh but watching the ending continues to make me cry.  It was a powerful film and watching it digitally remastered is just awesome!

""STAR TREK III: THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK"" (and like other of the odd numbered films), I had a few reservations watching it back then.  Now, I realize that Spock can't be dead permanently, he's to important to the crew of this Enterprise and needless to say, it was no surprise for me to see the return of Spock.  And with the final scene in the second film and the storyline of ""Genesis"", it was expected.

What was not expected was the time travel storyline of ""STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME"".  Of course, we have seen our favorite ""Star Trek: The Original Series"" crew go back in time for the classic ""Star Trek"" episode, ""THE CITY ON THE EDGE OF FOREVER"" but this was an interesting concept of bringing the crew members to 1986.  So, clothing and music of the time is highlighted.  Still, the film had a lot of humorous moments and an adventure so far out and not anticipated, that I actually enjoyed it a lot.

These three films together on Blu-ray and featured in High Definition and 7.1 Dolby TrueHD is indeed a collection that is worth it.  That is if you were particular towards these three films.  Personally, the whole collection of the six films on Blu-ray is worth owning but I can understand that for many fans, these three films may be enough for their collection and all they need.  So, if that's the case, this trilogy is highly recommended!

Now will we see another ""STAR TREK"" film release on Blu-ray with the same digital remastering as ""THE WRATH OF KHAN""?  Maybe... Quite possibly.  I guess we may not know for now.  But at this current time, these are the first releases of these films on High Definition on Blu-ray.  Featuring way better picture quality and audio quality over the DVD releases, they are also loaded with so many special features and for this trilogy alone, you can find the trilogy for a great price.

I can nitpick of how I wished all the films received the digital remastering as the second film or how I wish there was less DNR used in the picture quality but I'm sure everyone will have their qualms about the release or each film.  But the truth is that I enjoyed every ""Star Trek"" film that has been released in their own way.  These three films alone are just classics that are worth having in your Blu-ray collection (and I feel the other three are as well).

For now, this trilogy (and also the film collection on Blu-ray) are enjoyable and loaded with hours of special footage to keep one busy.  If you enjoy these three films (and not interested in the other three films) focusing on Kirk and Spock but also watching more adventures of the crew of the Enterprise from that classic series we loved watching then or through syndication, then ""STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE TRILOGY"" is definitely worth the purchase!",1243641600,8,22355,4.764981761334028
3789696,3,B001TH16D8,"To coincide with J.J. Abrams rebooting of the Star Trek franchise, Paramount has re-released Star Trek II through IV in a box set with brand new extras that are geared towards new fans generated from the latest film. These three films were already given the deluxe treatment (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-II-The-Wrath-of-Khan-The-Director-s-Cut-Two-Disc-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0000683DH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan - The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-III-The-Search-for-Spock-Two-Disc-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00006G8HX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek III - The Search for Spock (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-IV-The-Voyage-Home-Two-Disc-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000083C49/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek IV - The Voyage Home (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a>) with extras geared towards Trekkies so for them this set is not really worth purchasing.

If you already own the special editions of these films that were released a few years ago, none of the extras are carried over and The Wrath of Khan is only presented in its theatrical version and not the Director's Cut. So what is included?

On The Wrath of Khan DVD is an audio commentary by director Nicholas Meyer and Star Trek: Enterprise producer Manny Coto. Meyer admits that he knew nothing about Star Trek when he accepted the job. He says that Kirk and his crew reminded him of the famous Horatio Hornblower novels and how the Enterprise reminded him of a submarine. Meyer cites authors Jules Verne and H.G. Wells as influences. Coto does a good job of asking Meyer the right questions and keeps him talking.

""Starfleet Academy Scisec Brief 002: Mystery Behind Ceti Alpha VI"" is a mock Starfleet training film that explains the background of the planet that Khan was banished to.

""Collecting Star Trek's Movie Relics"" takes a look at some of the more memorable props from some of the Star Trek films with clips that show which film they are featured.

""James Horner: Composing Genesis"" features an interview with the film's composer. He talks about how Jerry Goldsmith's work on the first film influenced him. Horner talks about his approach to scoring The Wrath of Khan including specific musical cues.

Finally, there is ""A Tribute to Ricardo Montalban"" which features a fine celebration to the late great actor by Meyer.

The new extras on The Search for Spock DVD include an audio commentary by former Star Trek: The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine staffers Ronald D. Moore and Michael Taylor. They were huge fans of the original series and reminisce about seeing this film for the first time on the big screen. They talk about how The Search for Spock takes place right after The Wrath of Khan and starts off with a melancholic vibe. They also talk about the depiction of the Klingons and how it influenced their depiction in later shows.

""Starfleet Academy Scisec Brief 003: Mystery Behind the Vulcan Katra Transfer"" gives the lowdown on this rare practice, how it is performed, and what happens.

""Star Trek and the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame"" features screenwriter Harve Bennett talking about how he got the gig to write for the Star Trek films. He wasn't a fan of the show or the first film but told the studio that he could do a better job. He also talks about Star Trek's place in science fiction.

""Industrial Light & Magic: the Visual Effects of Star Trek"" examines how the visual effects for the Star Trek films were done. Some of the artists who worked on them talk about certain memorable examples.

""Spock: The Early Years"" features an interview with Stephen Manley who played Spock at 17 in the film. He talks about how he was cast and shares some of his experiences working on the film.

Finally, the new extras featured on The Voyage Home DVD include an audio commentary by Star Trek (2009) screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. They approach this film from the fan perspective, talking about when they first saw it. Orci and Kurtzman discuss the informal trilogy of The Wrath of Khan through to The Voyage Home and the notion that this film is a ""message picture."" They also talk about how the threat in this film comes from the unknown but is really man. They analyze this film from a screenwriting perspective - i.e. story structure, themes, and so on.

""Starfleet Academy Scisec Brief 004: The Whale Probe"" is a brief explanation of the mysterious alien probe from The Voyage Home.

""Star Trek for a Cause"" takes a look at the film's environmental message. Greenpeace representatives talk about how commercial whaling is depleting the Earth's population of whales.

""Star Trek: Three Picture Saga"" examines the dramatic arc of these three films. It was an accidental trilogy but a sense of continuity was established. Various key crew members talk about their involvement in these films.

""Pavel Chekov's Screen Moments"" features actor Walter Koenig talking about the significance of his character in The Voyage Home and how he actually got to do things in this one. He shares some of his memories working on it and is quite candid about what he had to (or didn't do) in the other films.

While all of these new extras are nice, they are definitely geared towards new fans and not to Trekkies. If you already own these films on the previous released special editions then it really isn't worth double-dipping.",1243296000,11,5660,5.413636363636364
3789697,4,B001TH16D8,"Big Star Trek fan, love this trilogy on blu-ray, just need to acquire VI later. I purchased this item despite reading a lot of bad reviews. I'm happy and satisfied with both the video & audio, giving it 4 stars a piece. This is certainly and without a doubt, the best, the sharpest, and the most detailed copies of Star Trek movies I have ever seen in my life. Is there still room for improvement you might ask? I really believe so and Paramount will probably re-release these movies again two to three years from now, yet again, taking advantage of suckers like me. If anyone decides to pick up this trilogy, I hope you'll be happy and satisfied with it. ENJOY !!! ""Live Long And Prosper""",1243209600,,689,4.433070866141732
3789698,1,B001TH16D8,"after watching the first 5 minutes on my Pioneer 111fd using a Pioneer 51 fd blu ray player , my stomach began churning. How could they call Star Trek II a remastered film. There is bar along the left side of screen, picture is dark, dirty and soft. Who is Paramount kidding here. I have not watched III and IV yet, but I'm afraid to after watching this poor video transfer and a tinny hollow soundtrack on what is their so called remastered masterpiece.

rent them if you like e'm then buy it. I should have. I would never have bought this. SAVE YOUR MONEY.",1242691200,4,558,4.314285714285714
3789699,5,B001TH16D8,"I'm not going to spend a lot of time on the ""quality"" the picture here. Personally, I think Blu-ray is overrated and rarely worth the extra money you have to pay for it.  My concern is the three films themselves and the new special features.  Sure, all Trek fans has seen these movies several times over, but the collection is worth the price in my opinion because of the improved quality, especially Wrath of Kahn, and the new special features. Who know, with the new Star Trek film heating up movie theaters all over the world, maybe this compilation will make into the hands of new fans, as well.

With one notable exception the new commentaries are great and insightful.  The only bad apple in the group is the new commentary by Khan director Nicholas Meyer and Manny Coto (former writer/producer for Star Trek: Enterprise and current writer/producer of 24).  Regardless of how many times Manny Coto tried to draw him out or relate the film to Trek in general, Meyer came off very pretentious.  The commentary on Search for Spock (Ronald D. Moore and Michael Taylor) and The Voyage Home (Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman) is far better and actually provides some insight we hadn't thought of before.

The films themselves still hold up and look pretty good.  Wrath of Khan is still the best Trek film ever, hands down.  Not even the new Star Trek can surpass it.  While some of the special effects look a little dated you don't really notice that because of the great acting, especially by William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and the late Ricardo Montalban. Even today, knowing how this film ends does not change just how emotional Spock's death is.  Both Shatner and Nimoy are great in that scene.

The Search for Spock is probably the weakest of the three (I mean, it is an odd number film, after all), but it's still a fun story and one that features the destruction of the Enterprise NCC-1701.  The Voyage Home, one of the most Earth-based of the Star Trek films, works mostly because of the cast.  The idea of plopping these 23rd century people into 20th century San Francisco leads to several humorous scenes and watching Spock's attempts to swear are still funny.

Overall, this is a great compilation featuring three of the best Star Trek films.  It's a compilation for and by fans, but it should also be inviting to new fans.",1242518400,2,2331,4.662591687041565
3789700,4,B001TH16D8,"PLEASE NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU-RAY EDITION OF THE TRILOGY. AMAZON HAS A BAD HABIT OF COMBINING THESE REVIEWS UNDER THE DVD ONES AS WELL.

The ""Star Trek"" films with the original cast get a Blu-ray release with mixed results. I sprung for the trilogy because, frankly, outside of ""Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country"" these are the best films from the series of films produced with the original cast.

 ""The Wrath of Khan"", ""The Search for Spock"" and ""The Voyage Home"" are ALL in high definition contrary to a misinformed review here. They also all use too much Digital Noise Reduction to eliminate film grain which ""softens"" the image and eliminates much of the detail that Blu-ray is famous for. The result is that skin textures look waxy lacking detail. Edge enchancement has been used to ""refocus"" the image a bit (DNR is a technique used to manage film grain and video ""noise"" but when over used it robs the image of the very qualities that make Blu-ray outstanding. This is often done by digitally throwing the image out of foucs if I recall correctly and then using edge enhancement to refocus the image). ""Wrath"" looks better simply because it was restored while the other two aren't).

You probably won't notice the difference unless you're watching this on a monitor above 40 inches (and if you watch it with a projection system it will be REALLY noticeable). That said, all three films could look better but they still look better than the DVDs. Audio sounds terrific.

We get a lot of new extras as well as all the original stuff from the 2 disc DVDs except the text commentaries. ""The Wrath of Khan"" features a new commentary track with director Nicholas Meyer and Manny Coto (""Odyssey 5"", ""Star Trek: Enterprise"", ""24""). We also get ""James Horner: Composing Genesis"", ""Collecting Star Trek's Movie Relics"", A Tribute to Richardo Montalban"", ""Star Fleet Academy: The Mystery Behind Ceti Alpha VI"" all in HD. We also get on all three films ""Libary Computer"" which is an interactive dictionary replacing in many respects the text commentary. Be aware that the pop up menu cannot be accessed when watching the film in ""Libary Computer"" mode.

""The Search for Spock"" includes a new commentary track by long time ""Next Generation"" writer and ""Battlestar Galatica"" producer/writer Ronald D. Moore joined by ""Trek"" writer Michael Taylor. While they had nothing to do wih the film Moore an entertaining speaker discusses the differences between the films, the original series and ""The Next Generation"" with insight. ""Spock: The Early Years"", ""Star Trek and the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame"", ""Starfleet Academy: The Vulcan Katrar Transfer"" are all presented in high def. Something I never noticed before while watching ""Khan"" or ""Spock"" is that one of the shots of the Genesis Planet is less than a perfect matte--you can see the stars behind the planet if you look carefully.

""The Voyage Home"" features ""Star Trek"" writers Roberto orci and Alex Kurtzman in a brand new commentary track. ""Pavel Scheko's Screen Moments"", The Three Picture Saga"", ""Star Trek for a Cause"", ""Starfleet Academy: The Whale Probe"" are all in HD. Also included is the ""Libary Computer"" again while all three films have ""Star Trek I.Q."" available only via the Blu-ray Live option.

The packaging leaves something to be desired--I would have preferred each in its own slimline Blu-ray container. This is presented in a fold out style holder. The artwork is attractive enough but the slip case and fold out holder may not stand up well to wear and tear.

As far as the quality of the films themselves even with the small budgets for the films all three are well written with strong performances and direction. Unfortuntely we don't get the ""Director's Special Edition"" of ""The Wrath of Khan"" which has been digitally restored (the film was in fairly bad shape) and remastered. Grain is quite noticable throughout and it appears that DNR wasn't used quite as heavily here as on the other two films (which were remastered first).

The script by Nicholas Meyer and Harve Bennett (although Jack Sowards is credited his script was one of five that was the basis of the final script along with writer/producer Harve Bennett) for ""Khan"", by Bennett for ""Spock"" and with Nicholas Meyer for ""Voyage Home"" are all strong and feature the humor/action that was characteristic of some of the best episodes of the original series. Bennett never really got the credit (or the thank you from Roddenberry)for reviving the show and giving it a production that captured the best of Trek.

I'm looking forward to ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" receiving a deluxe Blu-ray transfer with the ""Director's Cut"" included since it features the many visual effects that Wise wanted added as well as added him the luxury fine tuning the edit of the film (something he never had a chance to do because of the time constraints due to visual effects snafus and a drop dead premiere date).

So a mixed review--all three films look better than they did in their DVD incarnation but the transfers could be better. Audio sounds terrific and the extras are all good and welcome. The packaging though could be better but the price for this three disc set is pretty good. Hopefully ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" and ""Star Trek: The Undiscovered"" country will be available separately with the former including BOTH versions of the film and the latter including the ""Director's Extended Cut"".",1242432000,70,5452,4.901301518438178
3789701,5,B001TH16D8,"I don't know who Paramount is trying to lure into buying this set.  But for what it's worth, this is a pretty sweet package.

In case you're unfamiliar with the ""Star Trek"" franchise, this set includes the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th movies.  The reason it's tagged as a ""trilogy"" is because each film starts almost immediately where the previous one left off.  Also, these are three of the most popular of the series.

I could talk forever about these movies, but I think the important thing to remember is that all of them will hold up if you're not a fan of the franchise.

""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" is a fan-favorite for many reasons, one of them that the villain is a character from the original 1960s TV show.  But, if you've never seen Khan's appearance from the TV show, I think you'll still get a huge thrill seeing him ooze of cold vengeance.  Admiral Kirk's struggle to face life & death --- both literally and spiritually --- is sure to please anyone who enjoys a good character drama.  The drama and relationships between the characters are what drive the story from start to finish, and you don't need to be a fan to appreciate the connections.  The space battles are still a treat even after over 25 years, and the ending scenes are incredibly powerful.

""Star Trek II"" is one of my favorite movies of the 80s, and I'm sure I'd say that even if I wasn't a fan of this franchise.  It's an expertly-crafted sci-fi action/drama, and earns its acclaimed status.
__________________________________________________

""Star Trek III: The Search For Spock"" is probably the least favorite from this trilogy, but it's still a good one, in my opinion.  Even though non-Trekkers may be confused by a few of the story developments (notably Spock's Vulcan culture), I believe this one holds its own simply because of its production merits.  James Horner's music reuses tracks from ""Star Trek II"", but has a few haunting melodies specifically for this installment.  The action is good, and kinda brutal when the Klingons take decisive action.  And I find the premise intriguing...try to recover a resurrected companion who's stranded on a planet about to explode, while you're being hunted by ruthless, greedy warriors!

""Star Trek III"" will speak well enough to newcomers, but it's definitely tailored more for the familiar audience.
__________________________________________________

""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home"" is sure to be a pleasant ride for anybody.  Our heroes must travel back in time to recover an extinct species to save the planet.  Why and how humpback whales are supposed to tell an alien to stop ruining our O-zone layer is beyond me.  But somehow it all makes sense, and it's not the reason to invest in this film.

In addition to the usual merits we look for in ""Star Trek"" movies (great music, engaging special effects, and fun characters), this one is faltout hilarious!  Try to imagine how seven 23rd Century explorers (one of them an alien) attempt to steal two enormous mammals when their spaceship has lost most of its energy after their time travel.  You got misused profanity, Cold War tension, primitive technology, and contemporary music.  But rather than being a farce, the movie is great fun.

""Star Trek IV"" may not be my favorite of the series, but I'm sure it's the one that everyone will enjoy.  It stimulates your brain, uplifts your spirit, and forces some strong laughs.

To my knowledge, some of the bonus extras that were released on the 2-disc sets back in 2001-2003 won't be on this ""Motion Picture Trilogy"".  Instead, there will be a new goodies.

The main reason I want to check this set out is that Ronald D. Moore provides a track on ""Star Trek III"".  Moore wrote some of the best episodes for ""The Next Generation"" TV show, was the driving force behind the new ""Battlestar Galactica"" series, and has proven to be an engaging speaker through his podcast commentaries.

But that's just the fanboy in me.  I don't see much of a reason to buy this set if you already own the 2-disc releases of these movies.  But if you've never owned ""Star Trek II, III, or IV"" --- or never SEEN them --- then this is a good way to go.",1242345600,46,4213,4.780082987551867
3789702,5,B001TH16D8,"Theres a lot of hating going on in this customer review section and I totally understand. Yes, this set is a blatant cash-in from Paramount, and yes they only 'fully restored' one of the films in the set. I read these same reviews and was a little leary of getting this set, but at $40, i figured thats not too bad for three great Trek films, one of which was guaranteed to look good.

So I took a risk and bought the set after reading elsewhere that the other transfers were actually pretty decent. So after watching all three films I can say that it was a pretty good purchase considering all thats included in the set.

As far as PQ is concerned, Wrath of Kahn is definitely the best. Great colors, great depth and great detail. Nothing like The Dark Night, but very respectable for a film of its age. I would give it a 9/10.

PQ on The Search For Spock fairs a little worse, but not by much, colors and detail are right up there with Kahn, though not quite reaching its quality. Its not OBVIOUS that II was restored and III was merely remastered, they are very close with the only real knock against III being its depth. The image is just slightly flatter than II, but again, not by much. 8.5/10

The only downside for me was The Voyage Home, which while decent on its own, is noticably lacking when compared to the first two. The colors are often muted and a bit hazy, and the depth is just not there. However some space shots look great, so its not terrible. 7/10

I watched this set on a 50"" 1080p plasma and really only noticed the DNR when I got right up to the screen otherwise it rarely bothered me.

So there you have it. Yes I would have liked Paramount to go all out on restoring these movies and Im sure they will someday, but IMO unless you're a videophile you'll probably only notice it on STIV because III looks about as good as II. So if you're like me and are on the fence about whether or not to buy this set now or wait for Paramount to give a proper release a few years from now, I would say that while you might not be blown away by these transfers, they're definitely respectable and far from as bad as the other reviews would have you believe. Plus, at $40 its a pretty good deal for what you get. Highly Recommended.",1242259200,45,2243,4.228971962616822
3789703,4,B001TH16D8,"I was prepared for the worst after reading the review posted here, but I was pleasantly surprised at the image quality on all three of these discs. I wouldn't rate any of these as the best transfers I've seen, but I have many discs that are far worse.

""The Wrath of Khan"" is the only film that was remastered from the negative, but I didn't see a noticeable difference between that film and the other two. The noise reduction that everyone is complaining about didn't bother me either. That could be because I have a 50"" set that is not 1080p.

One reviewer stated that III and IV were merely upsampled from the DVD, but it hard to believe that they could pull that much detail from a 480i source.",1242259200,,698,4.361538461538461
3789704,3,B001TH16D8,"What's good about it: contains the 3 best ""Trek"" films that feature the original cast. The picture is slightly better than the 2-disc DVDs of these films, which looked great. The Dolby Digital EX sound is a nice improvement over the previous releases.

What's bad about it: Wrath of Khan is the theatrical cut, whereas the 2-disc DVD was the Director's Cut. NONE of the incredible bonus features from the 2-disc releases are included with this set, and the all-new features are mostly a bust. The visual effects featurette in this set is a real letdown, as it covers the first 6 movies in 13 minutes, so there is no time for any great detail on the FX work.

Bottom line: The transfers, both video and audio, are as good as DVD gets. If that's what you are after, or if you don't have the out of print 2-disc releases, this should do fine.",1242172800,44,839,4.441558441558442

3789716,2,B001TH16D8,"I got an advance copy of this and the first thing I noticed is that ONLY ""The Wrath Of Khan"" has been re-mastered in Hi Definition!

BEWARE: The other two movies are NOT Hi Definition transfers! So why buy Blu-Ray copies of Standard Definition transfers?  You are only going to buy ""The Search For Spock"" and ""The Voyage Home"" again when Paramount re-masters them in Hi-Definition!

Some customers may not notice this cheap-out when buying this set.  The BIG lettering on the back says ""DIGITALLY REMASTERED WITH BRILLIANT PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY"", but if you look closer you will see the small print says ""The films have been digitally remastered and The Wrath of Kahn has been fully restored in high definition picture quality and 7.1 Dolby TrueHD.""

So it seems that Paramount only had one of these movies ready for Blu-Ray but wanted to have a Box-Set on the store shelves when the new movie came out.

****CLARIFICATION****
Some fans are confused by my review. Let me first say that I am a television engineer, not a novice Blu-Ray owner.  So I want to list some clear facts to help all understand what this set is.

1) Are all of these movies 1080p High Definition video presentations?  YES
2) Do all of these movies have 7.1 Dolby TrueHD Audio?  YES
3) Will all of these movies look better than the older releases?  YES

What is the difference?
Paramount returned to ""Khan""'s original film negatives to make new high definition transfers and restore the movie.  All of the other movies are the 2001 transfers, digitally enhances using DNR technology and upconverted to 1080i for a high definition look.  This is a form of DIGITAL REMASTERING IN HIGH DEFINITION.  And this is the term that confuses the average Blu-Ray collector.  90 percent of the time when a studio claims ""digitally remastered"" on a DVD or Blu-Ray Disc they do NOT mean they went back to the original film negatives to make a new transfer, they just used digital technology to clean up the old transfer.

So why the complaint?
Because we all believe that Paramount will re-release these again, newly ""Restored"" from the original negatives.  If you do not believe that, look back at Paramount's track history of Star Trek releases.",1241568000,71,2208,4.765789473684211

Quality is about as 'good' as can be expected from a 20+ year old movie filmed on film and in the days where special effects meant things you did without complex computer graphics, so you'll see all the obvious signs of handmade effects.

Not a FULL restoration as applied to other classic films, so you still get things like background flickering (eg. ~12:30 into Khan) as Chekov turns from the bridge window to talk to the captain, or background brightness level changing (eg. ~1:05:50 into Khan). The usual tons of film grain which varies from little (bright, well-lit scenes) to lots (darker scenes). Since it's a Science Fiction film set far into the future, the film grain really doesn't add anything and IMO ought to be processed out. The 7.1 audio really isn't anything - pretty much sounds to the ears like a stereo track all the way through.
