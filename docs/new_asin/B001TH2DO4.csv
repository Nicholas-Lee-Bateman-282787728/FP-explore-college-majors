3789896,2,B001TH2DO4,"The idea for this movie, comparing imagery from different eras of an industrial city, was engaging, as were the movie shots all the way through. The narrator however was a self-obsessed blowhard with a booming, breathless voice, completely ruining the effect. I was able to watch most of it with my TV muted, but of course not really enjoy it. The music, when I dared listen, was good.",1270512000,5,385,4.676470588235294
3789897,4,B001TH2DO4,"Using rare footage of Liverpool, with only one tiny glimpse of the Beatles, this just over one-hour documentary uses poetry, literature and classical music to convey a personal picture of one of England's most mythologized cities. The dirt, the squalor and the poverty are shown in loving black and white while Kenneth Davies voices over a cynical older man's reminiscences of life here from the late 40s through the 70s when he evidently escaped. In the ugliness, there is beauty probably unappreciated by the residents. I would have appreciated a bit of current footage showing today's more gussied up Liverpool with what Davies claims are high design restaurants that rival any in Europe. This is a pretty picture, evocative, melancholy, but clinging to a bit of revery amid the ruins.",1264982400,,788,5.069230769230769
3789898,1,B001TH2DO4,"Surely, this is the ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" of documentaries. It is poorly made, unsympathetic and boring. The narrator is entirely self-focused and his voice is unsuited to narrative, raspy and irritating. The footage is monotonous, depressing, and actually manages to say very little about the city. The film is used as a personal vehicle for a few views that are entirely irrelevant to the subject. People  viewing this lame pastiche who actually came from the city and from that time felt personally insulted. I'm sure the supporting organizations, who thought they were aiding in a true representation of their city, would be justified in legal action for misrepresentation. This was truly horrid and grating, no redeeming qualiteis except that it opens the way for someone to do a really good film on what is actually the always interesting and always dynamic city of Liverpool.",1250294400,5,886,5.068493150684931
3789899,4,B001TH2DO4,"Having left Liverpool at the age of 18, back in 1974, much of the content of the film was touchingly familiar. However, the pretentious and somewhat precious prattling of the commentary is somewhat irritating; espacially in the first 20 minutes or so. Frankly, Scousers don't give a toss that the maker of the film had a problem reconciling his Catholicism with his sexual orientation. Boo hoo and big deal. The thing that makes Liverpool so exceptional among English cities is the character, wit and sheer bloody exuberance of its people. Seeing the crowds at New Brighton and pouring off the Ferry at Pier Head reminded me of the catastrophic decline in the population of Liverpool. Almost all of my generation just buggered off in disgust. Many of those left behind ended up in Cantrill Farm, Kirkby and other cheap and nasty concrete dumping grounds for the once proud inhabitants of this once great city. Militant Tendancy, Toxteth riots and thousands of Yosser Hugheses did nothing to convince anyone that the place was worth rescuing. Just remember all the fuss about the ""Garden Festival"" and then go and take a look at the sad wreckage that is all that is left of that early example of cynical political spin-doctoring. When I go to Liverpool these days (every 2 years or so) the place seems grotty, derelict and almost deserted. But the people are still among the best on Earth although, God knows, they have been let down badly. Snazzy new shopping centres and silly, money-wasting ""Years of Culture"" are no substitute for and cannot replace Liverpool's former greatness as a gateway to the world and a bustling centre of manufacturing enterprise. This film is wonderful nostalgia which really touched me deeply but it's time to stop wallowing in the past and move on. I pray for a sequel called ""The Liver Bird Flies Again"".",1247875200,4,1836,4.8690095846645365

3789911,5,B001TH2DO4,"I am biased because I love the films of Terence Davies, even as I realize they are not for everyone. That is the point, really: his work is a direct reflection of his sensibility, and you either see that and identify with it or you don't. The reviewers who complain that this is not an objective, by-the-book documentary are missing the point entirely. As Davies explains in one of the interviews, this is a personal work that developed in its own time and fashion. It does not rely on chronology or any standard organizing principle. For that reason Davies and the rest of the filmmaking team refer to the film as more of a poem, and so it is.",1324771200,6,644,4.420168067226891
3789912,4,B001TH2DO4,"Of Time and the City isn't only about Liverpool.  It could just as well be speaking of Detroit today or any other city decimated by ""progress"" and the pursuit of the next new thing.  The people progress from childhood to old age as observers of growth and decay while all the time it is happening to them too.  The film is a brilliant allegory about life in the modern world.  The narration seems to begin with admiration, journey through disappointment, only to arrive at hope for the next generation. The constant quotes read as captions to the photography are worth the price alone.  The narrator's personal comments may rile some but are only part of a portrait of life in the big city. It ain't all hearts and flowers.",1321315200,8,723,4.573643410852713

Utterly compelling. Seeing and hearing and listening to the parent past. For the first time. The architecture of decay and children play. Surpassed. I glanced at my parent's picture on the wall. Open-air swimming pools crowded. Glad.

And onward change tries to hide. And fails. The people who won their war. Betrayed. The 'fossil monarchy' should be gone, gone, gone. Not like ballroom dancing but The Bomb.

Creative souls like us should thrive through time unclocked. Defined. And people talking is one person's only hope. Together. I love this time of plenty. Out of mind.

Terence portrays in poetry as I review in kind. An unsentimental journey where I thought I would cry. I did not. See this documentary for who you are now. And for the mobile phone taking the place of crowds.",1316649600,3,807,4.833333333333333
3789914,1,B001TH2DO4,"Given Liverpool has given us the Beatles, Echo & the Bunnymen and Liverpool FC (apologies to Gerry & the Pacemakers, Wah Heat and Everton FC), this is as dreadfully dull a ""fillum"" as those three icons of Liverpool are endlessly fascinating.

Right from the start this thing moves soooooo slow it's painful to watch. I get it; it's a social commentary, but the narrator's voice and the glacial pace of this dreck had me hitting the fast-forward button.

I don't have the patience to go through the DVD extras so I'll leave that to someone else.

Basically, remember those hideous documentaries you had to sit through in high school social studies classes, this flick is just like that. For me, I'll stick with my Bunnymen DVD and Liverpool FC '80s highlight video. Ian McCulloch and Ian Rush to me are Liverpool not this.",1314230400,3,821,4.7272727272727275
3789915,1,B001TH2DO4,"I was born in Liverpool and left when I was 19. I lived in the suburb of Norris Green from age 8 until I left to come to the USA. I was irritated with the narrator's accent. He must have taken lots of voice lessons. I couldn't believe this guy was a Liverpudlian. I felt this dvd showed the dark side of Liverpool, very dreary and his strange ""poetic"" verse didn't make much sense. Why not tell the viewer where and at what time the film was made. In fact I absolutely hated it. I gave it away!",1309824000,4,494,4.051020408163265

I enjoyed seeing most of the video - it brought back a lot of memories, some good, some not so good.  What disappointed me was the several instances of profanity, which in my opinion, did not add anything.  Unfortunately, I did not show this to my mom (in her 80s) since that language does not sit well with her.  Other than that, it was interesting, and anyone who spent time in Liverpool would appreciate the many years of history on one DVD.",1283644800,,564,4.384615384615385
3789920,1,B001TH2DO4,"This movie is billed as a personal history of the city of Liverpool. It has some great archival footage of slums and the lives of the poor -- and an incredibly pretentious narrator who reads an incredibly pretentious script. And the history presented is annoyingly incomplete. We seem to be hearing the story of a sensitive gay kid afraid the come out -- but we never do quite get a story. Instead, we see the old slums demolished to be replaced by new, high-rise slums. We see many shots of graffiti, a weird aside about the Korean War, memories of a day at the beach and snatches of poetry while the soundtrack plays various bits of mostly classical music.

How can you have a movie about Liverpool without discussing the effect on the city of the Beatles and the other great groups of the Mersey Sound? We get a very, very brief shot of the Fab Four while the narrator drones on about how he prefers listening to ""my beloved Bruckner!""

Also no discussion of the two great football clubs of the city -- Liverpool and Everton -- and the religious divide between their fans. Instead, crappy musings about the Catholic Church and the narrator's loss of faith.

So there you have it -- a movie that ignores the city's two great contributions to British civilization. Yes it's a personal history but I saw no reason to interest myself in that person.",1273708800,6,1348,4.56198347107438

8341330,5,B001TH2DO4,"This is one of the most unique and memorable cinematic experiences I have ever had. Technically a documentary, the film is really a love song to Liverpool, the city where Terence Davies was born in 1945, and that he finally left in 1973. The word ""lyrical"" is so often used about this film that one seeks for another one, but gives up quickly because it is the best word: the film is permeated with lyricism - of words, images, and music. The film uses astonishingly intimate archival footage that shows, but never judges, the grimy conditions of the lives of ordinary Liverpudlians in a former industrial powerhouse in post-war England, which at the time was home to some of the worst slums in Europe. The footage of how difficult life was there is jarring even to those of us accustomed to modern images of poverty. Davies was also homosexual and Catholic - not an easy hand to be dealt in that time and place. And yet - the film also shows how deeply and lovingly entwined were the city's grit and the souls of those rooted there. Davies loved Liverpool in all its grimy splendor, especially as, like Newcastle, Pittsburgh, and other former industrial centers in the West, the city also boasted a great deal of extraordinary architecture. As only those who have grown up in similar urban centers can appreciate, there is a certain majesty in those places' ugliness. Davies also shows how the attempts to ""clean up"" the slums of Liverpool by tearing down the old council houses and substituting the ugly, soulless, poorly built concrete buildings that we in America call ""projects"" did little to improve the living conditions of residents, but did rob them of their roots and sense of community. You will find parallel stories of this syndrome in, for example, New York City, where tenements were torn down to make way for urban renewal efforts like the Cross Bronx Expressway - residents were relocated to hideous red brick housing projects, as ""urban renewal"" again broke up longstanding ethnic communities. Davies' own emotional maturing as he rejects Catholicism and gains confidence in himself and his sexuality, is an evocative counterpoint to the loss of the Liverpool he had loved, its character steadily eroded by changing demographics, urban renewal projects, and the slipping of cultural cohesion and values in the post-war era. The excellent dramatic series, ""Our Friends in the North"" documents a similar theme among a group of friends in the slums of Newcastle over 25 years.

Those of us who grew up in places like the Bronx in the 1950s and 1960s may empathize - my eyes filled with tears when Davies says, ""Oh, the Liverpool that I loved, where have you gone?"" For the film is not only about Liverpool, but about loss at the ruthless hand of Change - as the title says, ""Of Time and the City"". The narrative is spoken by Davies himself, and is accompanied by a marvelously eclectic musical score ranging from classical to popular. Gorgeously photographed, this is a heart-wrenching film. I am so glad to have seen it.",1484092800,,3036,4.816091954022989
8341331,2,B001TH2DO4,"The films of Liverpool are beautiful and thought - provoking but the commentary is the bitter and jaundiced ruminations of a former Catholic homosexual.

8341334,3,B001TH2DO4,"The great British filmmaker of memory and loss Terence Davies made his first full documentary here with this 2008 collage film of ""found footage"" from the 1940s, 50s, 60s and 70s about his beloved home city of Liverpool. The footage and its editing are absolutely extraordinary: Davies (as in his great feature films DISTANT VOICES, STILL LIVES and THE LONG DAY CLOSES) is able to re-create a mid-century Liverpool that's both much more beautiful than you could have dreamed, and much more sordid than you could have feared. Anchored visually in its Edwardian heyday by the Great Liver Building (which also anchors the actual city docksides), the film documents not only the decay of the enormous darkened buildings of the Victorian and early 20th centuries, but also documents, with due alarm, the rise of horrible Council Estate tall buildings during the post-War period. The chosen footage also depicts (with an uncanny eye for visual beauty)  the beauty of the docks themselves, the trains, the beautiful electric signs of the cinemas, and the very human and lively city inhabitants, from children at play to adults retaining their dignity in decaying surroundings.

For the eye, the film is something of a feast; but for the ear, the film just doesn't work. To accompany his matchless visual sense, Terence Davies also has quite an aural distinction for selecting lovely and evocative pieces of music (from Liszt to Peggy Lee) to accompany them; but he has something fo a tin ear for his own voice. His first mistake was to provide the film's narration in his hyperdramatic sonorous tones; his second mistake was to select a salad of super-familiar quotations (from Psalms to TS Eliot to Christopher Marlowe) that risk rendering his striking and singular images banal. Finally, he ""comments"" as he goes, making quite clear his crankiness towards the extravagance of the royal family, the musical unsophistication of rock music, his cynicism towards the Catholic church he so loved in his youth, and other fairly predictable and uninteresting biases and opinions. Instead of enhancing his visual feast, Davies's narration detracts from it.",1396569600,2,2143,5.137535816618911

8341336,4,B001TH2DO4,"To say that we liked or enjoyed watching this movie is a little too strong. We were enthralled by it but found it depressingly true. Watching gives you a sense of what has happened in civilizations as time passes. People, buildings and cultures are formed and then disappear - sometimes making improvements and sometimes just causing loss of unique identify.

This movie depicts the city of Liverpool and its residents but represents all cities and cultures that have disappeared as times change. The permanent ""play streets"" that once existed in Liverpool are now given over to traffic. The forboding row houses are now giant apartment buildings. For better or worse? There is a profound sense of world-sorrow in the poetic narration and the old black and white pictures that is beyond nostalgia. It's educational but sorrowful.",1367452800,7,829,5.095588235294118
