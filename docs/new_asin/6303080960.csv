7837371,5,6303080960,"I remember watching this film on TV years ago and was glad to find it on Youtube. ""They Watch"" also has the alternate titles of ""They"" and ""Children of the Mist"". It has notable performances by Vanessa Redgrave and Patrick Bergin. The story focuses on a family comprising a busy professional (played by Patrick Bergin) who always misses out on his young daughter's dance recitals. One fateful night, he misses another performance and his daughter is upset with him, so much that she refuses to go with him in his car on the way home, choosing to leave with her mom and younger sister. There's an accident and the daughter is killed.

Bergin's character is devastated and he finds it difficult to come to terms with the loss, especially since he is wracked by guilt for not being there enough for his family. This takes a toll on his marriage and his relationship with his younger daughter. Then strange things start happening, all of which lead him to think he is going insane. However, a discover of a drawing by his daughter, of a historic antebellum home, leads him to the home of a blind woman, Ms. Florence (Vanessa Redgrave), where the skeptical man is forced to face his fears and doubts and come to terms with the fact that his daughter's spirit is earth-bound due to his unwillingness to let go and come to terms with her death.

There is enough suspense and good acting to make up for other flaws such as a drawn out second half of the film. Ms. Redgrave never disappoints and portrays the otherworldly blind Southern woman with amazing credibility and a touch of the ethereal. The film addresses the issues of loss and grief, and the supernatural with sensitivity and makes for an engaging watch.",1450569600,2,1707,4.6490066225165565

7837373,5,6303080960,"Saw this movie on television when I was a child and it scared me. Apparently it was interesting enough for me to search out in my adult life, so I cannot wait to see it again. I wasn't sure I could find it anywhere anymore. :)",1375315200,,226,3.9347826086956523
7837374,5,6303080960,"Fine TV film with a very decent cast and quite good acting and direction. A pity this hasn't been made into a DVD.

The plot is an all too common but at the same time solid story about the guilt ridden love of a father for his dead child.

Set in the South-East US, the film take us through a gentle but haunting story of a father who is guilt torn about having remained absent of his children lives for professional reasons, until hils eldest girl dies in a car accident.

Following that, the lead character starts receiving strange clues that his dead child might be trying to contact him from the beyond and embarks on a quest to let her know he loved her.

A sad but lovely story that will touch the most hardened viewers.",1356825600,2,726,4.2773722627737225
7837375,3,6303080960,"This movie was a bit odd. I enjoyed it, however. It was a rather low-budget affair, but well done nonetheless. Vanessa Redgrave was wonderful as usual, however I wasn't always convinced of her blindness. The main players were Patrick Bergin and Vanessa Redgrave and the camera was tuned to their attractiveness, both physical and emotional. It felt to me that the other characters (the wife and daughters) were not given as much of the movie budget for pretty clothes or attractive hairstyles. The South is a wonderful backdrop for this mysterious story. Not knowing how Rudyard Kipling (the author of the original short story) would end it was suspenseful ... happy ending or sad?",1302652800,,681,4.982456140350878
7837376,4,6303080960,I watched this movie many years ago and I really enjoyed it.  Somewhat low budget but I still enjoyed it!,1271376000,,105,4.25
7837377,3,6303080960,"Maybe I am just sensitive but this movie scared the pee out of me! That owl girl still creeps me out and I have not seen it in years. I don't think I could bring myself to watch it...

Other than that, I thought the acting was very nice and the story was well done. Vanessa Redgrave is almost always a winner and she turns in another great performance here.

Still, watch out for that owl girl if you watch this...",1165190400,5,414,4.098765432098766
