Not easy to accept and it needs some future investigation to get into the idea of a Resource Based Economy but it is worth the effort. If we want to have a great life in peace all together, this is the way to go. :)",1294099200,9,319,4.316666666666666
4259920,5,B00443YDWK,"We all need to be aware of this stuff.  There's a lot that goes on in this world that people are oblivious to.  As much as I love this country, it saddens me to learn there is so much lying going on out there.",1289347200,27,209,3.727272727272727
4259921,5,B00443YDWK,"I certainly believe that super-large-scale crooks are 'directing' the world's financial and business affairs at their liking.  This DVD does a pretty good job explaining that.  And contrary to other reviewers, I am nearly completely convinced that some of the religious explanations regarding what role early astronomy played, are quite correct as well.  In fact, after reading reams of papers and research about what we conveniently have adopted as the various biblical religions, but should more ideally amount to spirituality, I am further convinced that the god Western religions keep talking about, is in fact a god created in ""our"" own image.  To at least partially drive home the point, I'll use the late George Carlin's description of that god's job being ""one of an office temp with a bad attitude, who should have been fired a long time ago"".

I'm talking about the god WE have created, just to set the record straight.  To address the elsewhere mentioned idea, that 'orgasms' are to blame (geez, who ever invented that;-) well, that is just a good laugh.  Just like mistreated dogs, we love the master even if he keeps beating us, and that is what our man-made religions have accomplished for us - misery and chaos.  Oddly enough, this seems to prevail mainly among god's highest accomplishment, the human being.  No where else in nature - where I imagine god really lives - is there a life-form that suffers so much and creates so much suffering.  A god like that can simply be analyzed as a psycho.  And when one looks at the present human condition from an analyst's point of view, that god is in 'good' company.  My god happens to be a little different than that.

To address the 'Jesus' idea, there is just too much muddled history to prove that he is what the business of church - that being the business of coercing people - claims for him to be.  Crucifixions happened by the thousands in his day (do your homework!).  And sages, some very extraordinary, have existed throughout history.  Written texts have been omitted, falsefied, inadequately copied and lied about ever since the first word made it onto a scroll or a paper - it's the same human nature many share with the god they revere.  This is especially noticeable with biblical text, where the stakes are high.  Yet, that is not all this movie is concerned with.  As is expected, similar misconduct is running rampant right up to this very minute and is ever more successful in this day of the internet.  It follows that, when Zeitgeist pretty much exposes the the underpinnings of what brought down the Twin Towers, I see this as a very real possibility, especially after also explaining how our multinationals - like Standard Oil et al - are doing business on both sides of a war or conflict and thrive by it (how is your 401K doing?  President Obama just recently admitted, that the U.S. has been behind the overthrow of the democratically elected Iranian government back in the early 50s. And this is not a singular case.  We industrial nations ARE the bad apples on this planet.  To expose the real reasons why we are this way though, one must dig even deeper, that is as far back as how we birth and raise our children and the neglect they routinely live through.  For that, authors Pearce, Liedloff, Piaget and Alice Miller among many, need to be referenced, as well as historical facts, which back-up their findings.  This movie shows eloquently what happens when the highest form of creation becomes a cancer.  It's time to make changes, not excuses!",1262736000,,3538,4.7495908346972175
4259922,4,B00443YDWK,"I loved the first part of this, the part about how money is basically created from thin air.  Probably the best treatment of Federal Monetary Policy I have ever seen.  But the producer should have quit there.  When he went on about how religion was all superstition, I had to just laugh.  He apparently has not checked his facts very well.  For instance, he claims that Jesus was just one in a long line of ""Christs"" that were reportedly crucified and resurected. WRONG!  Yes, there were a lot a people that claimed to be the Christ and were crucified.  But only one, Jesus, was resurected and proved it to hundreds of people.  If this were not true, considering Jesus was the number one news item of the day by the thousands of people that were seeing him on a regular basis, would not his enemies have siezed the moment and declared him a fraud?  Look what happened to Tiger Woods in the press.  It would have been all over the news of the day.  And really, would his followers have succumbed to brutal deaths when they knew the whole thing was a setup? It's funny how the producer accuses religion of having a closed mind yet he is the one with the closed mind because he has not investigated the facts at all.  If you are going against 2,000 years of accepted history, let's at least hear your arguments for and against.  Basically the latter part of the film is just speculation and fantasy so if you watch it just for the first part it is definately worth it.",1262044800,,1465,4.401486988847584
4259923,3,B00443YDWK,The video was high quality.  I loved the stuff about the fed however once they started preaching atheism I could only laugh.  It's hard for me to believe that anyone can still believe that we all evolved from exploding hydrogen gas.  That is the stupidest solution to the origin of our existence.  I don't know of many people who are dumb enough to believe that.  It's sort of like a really bad joke!,1258329600,,400,4.424657534246576

I had previously viewed and reviewed  in shock an awe at the incredible amount of information-and although I have know these truths from previous self readings and seeking enlightment in these times.. I have never seen it so comprehensively and unbiasly delivered therefore I could not resist the next chapters.

.Bill 2847 is coming up. ""The Banks are Rupt.""  and The Moneychangers continue.. What it has made me certain of..is that I don't know whom I am voting for...even when I vote.-- I don't think it means anything anymore as i watch Govt yield to Corpratocracy/and big Banking (we will control all that you see and hear) I question that freedom more and more..

4259973,1,B00443YDWK,"I could not even finish this hateful dribble, but if you don't have enough intelligence to get insulted by this, watch it.  This movie-manifesto shows that you don't need to charge a price to sell people that won't think for them self, just about anything.

By the way, these people are not anti-establishment, they want you to join their establishment.  They tell you how bad commercialism is. How companies and governments are destroying the competition and then they spend the rest of the movie trying to destroy the Establishments that they are not the king of.

They might succeed in creating a society without money but you will always have currency as long as someone wants what another has. Time, power, talent or possessions etc. are currency.  The worlds oldest profession existed before coins were invented.  It will exist after they take coin away.  Give people free food, houses, cars and computers and they will want better ones.  Money is an efficient way to exchange what you have for what you want.  If you don't have what other people want, then you become the ones in poverty in this system.

As for Technology, this is the greatest en-slaver of all time.  We all get busier and busier and more dependent with each new gadget that comes into our lives. We get less involved with people and more involved in things.  We serve the devices, they don't serve us.  The typewriter came along and you had professional typists, the computer came along and now all of us are typists entering endless amounts of data.  Fast food and Microwaves came along and we just lost the time we set aside for meals, family and friends.  We got busier.  Your boss can reach you anywhere, you can't break the chain.  Technology means you can do can do your job anywhere, and you will be expected to do your work anywhere, everywhere, anytime, every time.

Most people just do not know or even care to know the ugly truth about our government.  Our nation's youth should be made aware.  Over all it is a bit disturbing.,1400630400,,443,4.395061728395062

4259983,5,B00443YDWK,"Oh, hell yes! About two thirds of the way through this movie, I was thinking about giving it 4 - 4.5 stars in the review (for review it I must). Not because that anything it says is incorrect or wrong, but because of things omitted or left out. The agenda of modern medicine and the ""food"" industry (i.e. Monsanto working in collusion with the US government) to promote ill mental and physical health, for example. And if technology is important (and it is), why not mention Nikola Tesla and his invention of a wireless system of energy?

But the main omissions, I thought, are surely gonna be spirituality and Natural Law, because a lot of people (solipsists, nihilists, atheists) have a hard time with those topics. Just goes to show that judgement based on partial information of facts or ""contempt prior to investigation"" is erroneous. Indeed, those last two topics were touched on (albeit very briefly) in the last half hour of the movie.

For anyone who wishes to dig deeper, I urge you to research the work of Mark Passio on his site; whatonearthishappening.com, and his youtube videos (especially his three part seminar on Natural Law).",1394323200,4,1144,4.802030456852792

The engineer's decision to repeatedly decry religious institutions, for example, isn't going to help him achieve his goals. Religious people make up the majority of the population, and without their help, there can be no meaningful changes in society. I also disagree that people should totally reject politics. Although politics at the federal level are hopelessly corrupt, there are still  plenty of ways to make a difference at the state and local levels. The bottom line is, although the dream behind this movie is an excellent model for society, it can never be realized without the full support of the masses.

Regardless of how much you hate money and capitalism, regardless of how much you want to see the world as you want it to be and not as it is, you can't deny the fact that for as long as there has been man, there has been money, or barter. Yet, somehow, these pseudo-intellectuals believe they can reprogram the human nature itself. According to them, if we move to a resource-based economy, there will be no money, no jails, people will all be happy because they'll no longer be stuck in boring jobs, everyone will have everything they need, and the world will all be sunshine and rainbows.

Give me a break. Who's going to build all this wonderful technologically advanced world? A better question is, who's going to provide their labor with no compensation? Who's going to decide how much of those resources I need or don't need? What happens to all the homicidal maniacs, rapists et al who do what they do not for profit, but because they're sick in the head? What happens to the lazy people, greedy people, the megalomaniacs, the sociopaths? I guess they'll just magically cease to exist, or be magically cured by sunlight... Or something. This is communism in the guise of... Heck, I don't even know what to call it, but it's just as absurd.

The movie implied that all these destructive impulses and behaviors exist because of our societal structure and are not our natural brain chemistry. This is speculation at best, with no basis in reality. I bet you cavemen who couldn't even verbally communicate, were stealing from and killing fellow cavemen who happened to have more meat and fur. Why do communist countries fail? Because you can't change the human nature. PEOPLE LIKE TO OWN STUFF, PERIOD. When in the early 90s the former USSR ran out of money, what did people do to survive? They bartered. There were ample resources around, but no one was willing to give away their cow's milk or their potatoes for free, and they couldn't care less if your family starved in the street as long as their own survived. Equality and selflessness are great concepts, but they don't work in the real world. So, good luck with that, guys... Yes, we're nasty, violent, selfish creatures, but at least the free market system compliments our greed and turns it into a motivator to do good. I DO believe the Fed is a huge problem, I DO believe the corporations have too much power, I DO believe we need to abolish the crony capitalism system we have now and return to the free market capitalism, but the ""solutions"" proposed by this movie aren't real solutions... They're unachievable utopian dreams. And every single attempt to reach utopia throughout history has ended in tragedy. Why should this be different? Because it works in your IMAGINAAAATION?

If you've never seen a Zeitgeist movie, or read any counter culture books, then you truly are living blind in Today's world. Most people tend to think that everything the media tells us is the way it is, that politicians tell the truth 100% of the time, and that the government operates for the good of the people. Sadly however, our current society is far from that.

In Zeitgeist you are exposed to the truth. They break down today's system of government and social structure which is based on a monetary system, show you how the monetary system is corrupt, and why it fails, then they provide solutions in their conclusion. The layout of the movie is structured very well and slowly unfolds into the solution of a resource based society.

Even though I had known a lot about the corruptions in society, there was still plenty of information to be drawn from this film. For instance, I had no idea what an economic hitman was and would have never imagined our own government employing such people. Zeitgeist doesn't just tell this information through the narrator either, they bring in a former economic hitman and have him tell you everything first hand.

If you are happy living a clueless life and are content with thinking that things are as ugly as they are right now just because that's the way things go, then don't watch this, but if you want to know the truth and see what is really happening then I suggest you watch this, and both of the other Zeitgeist movies as well.

4260023,4,B00443YDWK,"I've been reading, for some years, much of what is in this documentary. This grabs a bit from the other two outings and adds to them so this is a bit redundant.

Here's the scoop. This segment tackles the stupid, corrupt and ultimately self destructive monetary system. It shows, with great detail, how it subjugates people. Everyone is caught in a cycle of revolving debt and the only ones who win are those at the top. It also shows, with the World Banking system and the Federal Reserve how the countries themselves, U.S. included, are caught in the same cycle. It also deals with energy, religion, politics and ""resource based economy.""

As I mentioned, some of what is included here is in the other two installments, but if you haven't seen either of those this is a treasure trove of information. Given the facts and figures they throw up it all seems verifiable as well. The section on energy is very interesting. It shows how we can run oil free, with an abundance of energy, but the oil companies simply won't let that happen. This is true of any institution, which is why I don't give money to the American Cancer Society. They're into 'treating' cancer because, if they cured it tomorrow, there would be little need for them or the billion dollar industry they've sprouted.

One area I need to delve into further is the concept of the ""resource based economy' as seen by ""The Venus Project."" Some of what was brought in regard to this seemed self contradicting. There just wasn't enough time to nail it at length.

This is some great stuff. It angers and frustrates in that you can see what they're saying, and gives the viewer some points on how to break the cycle, but it all still seems so insurmountable.",1359158400,,1719,4.607843137254902

I had followed this over the years, and human population has risen as it predicted, although slightly faster.  In mentioning the symbiotic nature of all life on earth, the show reminded me of a conjecture I formed more that thirty years ago:  IN ANY SYMBIOTIC SYSTEM (like the Earth, Sun and Moon), THERE IS AN OPTIMUM POPULATION FOR EACH SPECIES, ONE CELLED TO COMPLEX;  A POPULATION BELOW OPTIMUM WILL FIND FACTORS FAVORING ITS INCREASE; A POPULATION OVER OPTIMUM WILL ENCOUNTER FACTORS WHICH TEND TO REDUCE  ITS NUMBERS; THESE FACTORS WILL INCREASE IN INTENSITY AND NUMBERS PROPORTIONAL TO THE SPECIES DISPLACEMENT FROM OPTIMUM.

4260028,2,B00443YDWK,"""Zeitgeist Addendum"" is the sequel to ""Zeitgeist: The Movie"". Both films are made by Peter Joseph, who is also the leader of the Zeitgeist Movement. While ""Zeitgeist: The Movie"" was an eclectic mishmash of right-wing conspiracy theories, critique of religion and vague pantheistic spirituality, ""Addendum"" is more obviously left-wing.

In fact, the ideas in the film sound like a parody or caricature of Marxism. I frequently gasped when watching it. Joseph believes that all problems in society are fundamentally caused by scarcity. The solution is to create a global, classless, stateless, moneyless society of super-abundance based on free energy and very advanced technology. Work will be abolished by complete automation. Nanotechnology will make even surgical procedures automated. ""Addendum"" is filled with futuristic animations of UFO-like cupolas in the cities of tomorrow, and, of course, really fast trains.

In other words, ""Addendum"" calls for communism and the immense development of the productive forces. Of course, the narrator doesn't use those somewhat tainted terms, preferring to call it ""a resource-based economy"" and ""sustainability"". However, I think it's obvious that Joseph must have studied Marxism. Even dialectical materialism with its thesis-antithesis-synthesis is included, but once again under different terms (""emergence"" and ""the best thing is to be wrong"").

""Addendum"" also sounds like a caricature of the Red-Green left, with its contradiction between Green sustainability and modern (state-run) high technology. Murray Bookchin comes to mind. Thus, the film claims that *all* of our present energy needs - and more - can be solved by developing wind, solar, tidal, wave and geothermal power. (I didn't know there were still people who believed in the blessings of wave power.) All cars could be run on electric batteries, and airplanes could simply be abolished in favour of magnetic trains. I admit that I also used to believe in a kind of ""bright green"" cornucopianism such as this. Then I discovered the books of Vaclav Smil! I won't belabour the point here, except to state that the proposals in ""Addendum"" are completely utopian.

Speaking of utopianism, I compared the message of the movie to Marxism above. However, there is one crucial difference. Marx could point to a very concrete social and political force that (presumably) could carry out his program: the international labour movement, with its unions, cooperatives and political parties. Later, the Soviet Communist leadership added national liberation movements to the list, and (of course) the political and military might of the Soviet Union itself. This, after all, is how social change happens: by the play of powerful social and political forces, or ""class forces"" if you like the Marxist terminology better. Today, Marxism is (to put it mildly) very much on the defensive, but it did ""work"" for a century or so. If in doubt, call the CIA!

But how does the Zeitgeist Movement propose to change the world? It turns out that they are completely clueless. The labour movement, feminism, left-wing nationalism, the remaining Marxist or ""Marxist"" regimes, even the Green movement - they are all conspicuous by their complete absence. Instead, ""Addendum"" heavily promotes one Jacque Fresco, a lone genius who has discovered the correct vision of the future. Frankly, who the *hell* is Jacque Fresco?! Another force for change is ""technology"", but since machines can't function by themselves (yet), this means that technologists are the real movers and shakers of the revolution. Fresco and his Venus Project presumably see themselves as such. Shades of Saint-Simon and Positivism?

If entrusting loving and caring technocrats with out future is a bit too much, ""Addendum"" has yet another proposal: individual spiritual transformation. Jiddu Krishnamurti is featured twice, and an extended quote from Carl Sagan is given a spiritual spin. The ""symbiosis"" mentioned by the narrator is presumably a form of pantheism. This explains the strong hostility of Joseph to established religion, monotheism in particular. It's a challenge to his own religion...

The movie ends with a couple of concrete proposals for action. Most of them are meaningless, and simply amount to taking a purely personal stand against some particularly egregious institution. Sure, it's not ""wrong"" to boycott big banks or nuclear energy, but so what? No meaningful social change will happen through personal statements of this kind. These proposals are also illogical from the movie's own perspective. I can understand if doomers, peak oilers or Anthroposophists prefer to ""drop out"", individually or in small groups, but Joseph has a more statist, globalist and technological perspective on things. Why not demand that the federal government takes over the banks and starts issuing debt-free money, instead of calling on a few individuals to switch their bank accounts? Oh, I forgot, politicians will never accomplish anything, no really existing movement is even remotely interesting, only technicians like Mr. Fresco counts! In fact, after an extensive propaganda pitch for the Zeitgeist Movement's political perspective, the proposals at the end feel like a complete anticlimax. The most important ""action"" is simply to make more people watch the Zeitgeist movies...

Marx would have seen ""Zeitgeist: Addendum"" as a perfect example of utopian socialism. A genius comes up with some brilliant ideas, they are propagated by a small group of devoted followers, the propaganda is often moralistic in tone, but since they have no political strategy, ultimately nothing comes out of it. Of course, it could be argued that Marx himself was a utopian socialist. In the end, his program also failed to transform the world. However, it can hardly be denied that old uncle Karl created more mischief than Peter Jospeh or Jacques Fresco will ever do.

8415777,4,B00443YDWK,"While there are definitely some things I do not agree with in this film, I think some of the main points that are stressed are worthy of a good rating.  The idea of boycotting politics, television and news media, pushing to end central banking debt economies owned by international bankers are absolutely things that would need to happen to make a real, and positive change.  I believe this debt system is also the main reason for wars and fake terrorism, which in turn, is used to place blame on countries that are devoid of international banking protocols, and gives the excuse to invade these countries to meddle with their banking system to make them 'comply' with international standards.  Look what happened to Iraq, Iran, Libya and now Syria, and the taboo example of National Socialist Germany in WWII, coincidently all regimes we are led to believe are the spawn of Satan in the US, yet they all had at least some degree if financial independence from international banking institutions.

Other suggestions like going off the grid are nice in theory, but only a small minority of citizens have the means to do that.  This happening on a mass scale would be a by-product of alleviated debt slavery, but if you can do it, good for you.  I also think that eliminating money is a drastic measure that wouldn't work.  What's more important is integrity, honesty, and fair business, with a currency that's backed by something real and tangible.  I'm not an economist so I won't give much more opinion that that.

Another area I have concern with are the technology worship that seems to be invoked.  Don't get me wrong, I feel very lucky to have the things I have, and try to use them with care and respect but the problem is people using the technology ends up being in mind numbing ways a greater percentage of the time.  If you look at our world, it's the greatest weapon not only against but FOR mass mind control, and the latter certainly has the majority in its favor.  Critical thinking combined with a sense of self worth combined with care and consideration for those around you should be focused on before going all gung ho on advancing technology on a mass scale, which brings me to higher education, something not touched upon as being corrupted in this film.

I think there's a big problem with education, and whats taught in schools and universities.  It's just as biased as the media, but in much more subtle ways.  I've seen countless peers of mine that had a political ideology built into them from universities, and it's usually a hypocritical social justice warrior mentality that they refuse to believe is destructive because they feel they are 'right' due to their higher education which ironically they are in debt for.  This usually imparts 'white guilt' and a biased version of the Civil War (fought to end slavery, yeah sure) to fuel the fire of a perceived racism that is false, than actually being able to identify a racism that is real, which they are in turn promoting, not fighting.  And of course fake racial shootings, and completely controlled events that are passed off as real fuel the fire even more.  This is where the critical thinking needs to be engaged, to see when an agenda is in place.

I don't mean to be harsh on my peers who went through higher education, or imply it was a waste, but there's so many ways to educate yourself through one's own perseverance essentially for free or a very low cost of having just about any book at your disposal through the internet.  This, in my opinion should be a precursor to a college education if one choses to go, and to develop independent critical thinking, so when you do pass through an education system that has an agenda, you can throw out the bath water using your own discernment and not lay down to arguments from authority.  I just felt this series is lacking that perspective, and in some ways helping promote this agenda, with a marxist attitude where you distribute wealth and resources evenly, but the question always remains, who is making these decisions and how they are usually the ones exempt from 'common' status and are the hierophantic elites rending the whole system a paradox.  It's INTEGRITY that must be valued as the foundation of a system, not a particular ideology of a system of governance for society.

Then of course there's the idea of human behavior.  That if one doesn't have poverty, or debt slavery, and has infinite resources, they'll all of a sudden become a good person.  This is a very simplified summary of what the movie was promoting, but there's always going to be people who are MORE self-centered and greedy or manipulative than others (I stressed the word 'more' because we're all like this to varying degrees and from time to time).  This is part of the human condition, and I think it's a delusional ideological assumption that people will magically shed their 'bad' qualities when we have the resource based economy described. This won't stop people from having affairs, neglecting their children, engage in controlling or manipulative relationships, and exploiting others emotionally, which creates the driving factor of our irrationality: emotional trauma.  This happens at any level, with any race, social status or educational background.  None of this is touched upon, and I think its the most fundamental issue, and where spirituality and accountability to a higher power actually HELP this.  I do agree with this movie that religion is absolutely detrimental to our society, as a generalization.  This is mainly because it's secretly connected via Occult religious ideologies that is even embedded into institutions most people deem to be 'secular'.  That aside, I certainly do not think it's a fruitless effort to read something like the Bible or other spiritual scriptures, or have a belief in God.  And Zeitgeist is widely known for it's condemnation of Christianity, but unfortunately I think it's really uninformed about certain biblical ideas, and these movies, especially the first Zeitgiest film, make some very deceptive claims to try to 'debunk' Christianity.  To me this is most likely because of upbringing in a Fundamental Christian environment that can be very damaging to people, but unfortunately it leaves an axe to grind which turns into deceptive Christian bashing in the first film, but not really focusing on possible flaws in other religious systems.

I am NOT a Christian, but my point is, that within the Bible, there are actually some very profound things that can be applied to life in a very humbling and benign way.  But where it falls short is the questions raised on something like ""evilbible.com"", and just like anything else, you take the good, dispel the bad.  Any other religious material is no different.  Also, one thing that is concerning to me, is the NWO, and a false peace trying to unite the world is predicted in the Bible, and seems to me the Zeitgeist end-game is promoting just that, something that is utopian and I believe to be unattainable.  There is overwhelming occult symbolism all over the world, and especially rife in the institutions that Zeitgeist is condemning (media, politics, religion), yet they are promoting many of the same Freemasonic teachings that are in line with those same institutions.  A perfect example is the Astro-Theology of Jordan Maxwell and Acharya S.  I'm not condemning these people, I've learned a lot from them.  But I find a lot of flaws, and biased research within their claims, and it's very much in line with the occult, so take that for what you will.

I'm not saying I know what's right or wrong here, and that these are all issues that one will have to sort out on their own.  I think this particular film addresses real fundamental problems, and does give some real solutions, but there are beliefs and ideas that I personally think are coming from biased and at times contradictory ideologies, which invokes some serious red flags.  But unlike most critics of the Zeitgeist series, I don't have any bad words to speak towards the people themselves, Peter Joseph, Jaques Fresco etc.  I don't know them personally, but they seem like their heart is in the right place, and I respect them for putting themselves out there, for better or for worse.  It's more than I can say I've done, and it's disappointing to see people like these folks become a target for some other version of ax girding for people who can hide behind a keyboard and spew out wild accusations.  So I sympathize with the director, even though I don't agree with many things Zeitgeist promotes.  I could see an incorporation of certain ideas the Venus project offers as positive as well.  Regardless, I think Addendum is, at the very least, an important film in this series for bringing up the discussion about where we are going, why, and what we can individually do to help making things better for our immediate surroundings, friends and family, and not exploit the other nations around us.",1455408000,,8997,4.826171875
