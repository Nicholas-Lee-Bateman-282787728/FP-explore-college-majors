I decided it was time to revisit these videos (I hesitate to call them ""films,"" despite their being considered short films), and I am pleased about having picked out this particular release: you get much for 25 bucks. Ironically, a heroin addict stole all my William S. Burroughs media (including VHS tapes of some of this material) when I was living in Manhattan a long time ago (when Alphabet City was still a somewhat edgy place for white boys like me to call home). Realizing that I so accurately remembered these videos - having last viewed them over 20 years ago - emphasizes just how much of an impression they can make. The dreamachine, the music (and noise), the unforgettable images: I have not seen anything quite like it since.

Burroughs is surely not everyone's cup of tea. Even if you like him (of course why on Earth would you purchase this if you don't), if you haven't seen these before and are expecting coherent films, then there is a fair chance you will be disappointed. Additionally, if you have an aversion to old school Industrial music (Throbbing Gristle), then you may have a difficult time here (you could of course just turn off the audio, but you'd be missing out on the intended effect). I'm not even going to try describing the videos, although the last paragraph of this review is an excerpt from the booklet describing ""Thot-Fal'N.""

The Interview with Alessandro Gebbia (""Professor of Anglo-American Literature"") is around 40 minutes long: it is in Italian with English subtitles, as opposed to the other videos, which have Italian subtitles (they can be turned off). Gebbia provides some interesting background / context for the content on the discs; Burroughs buffs will likely appreciate this ""extra."" Considering the age of these shorts and the way they were produced, the video quality in this release seems good to excellent (about as much as we could hope for).

On Thot-Fal'N:
""This film describes a psychological state akin to ""moon-struck,"" its images emblems (not quite symbols) of suspension-of-self within consciousness and then that feeling of ""falling away"" from conscious thought..... etc. ..... Thus the ""actors"" in this film, Jane Brakhage, Tom and Gloria Bartek, William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Peter Orlovsky and Philip Whalen, are figments of this Thought-Fallen Process as are their images in the film to themselves being photographed.""
Okay, if you say so.....",1391731200,2,2718,4.910675381263617
