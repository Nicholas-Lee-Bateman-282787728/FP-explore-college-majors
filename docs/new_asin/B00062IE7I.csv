2163188,2,B00062IE7I,"I found these videos to be my least favorite.  I started my exercise routine with her about 2 years ago and she helped me to achieve a 25 pound weight loss.  I thought that I would get these to bump up my exercise routine and do something different, but I was really disappointed.  The Walkblaster incline step does not really add anything to the workout, maybe if it went higher it might do some good.  The videos just don't get your heart pumping like her others do..I love her other videos, but I wouldn't waste my money on these...",1106697600,13,535,4.373737373737374
2163189,5,B00062IE7I,"I lost 40 lbs last winter using the WATP 2,3 and 4 mile programs.  I get bored easily, so I wanted something new.  This is great!  I have only been using it a short while, but I can tell it is beginning to sculpt as well as help me lose the last 15 lbs.  Leslie is amazing!",1103500800,19,273,3.736842105263158
2163190,5,B00062IE7I,"I ordered the walkblaster through Leslie's website and have been using it for 2 weeks now. I am already thrilled with the results. I have been a Leslie Sansone - WATP fan for a long time and I have to say that the Walkblaster is by far my favorite program yet!!! I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to shape their buns, hips and thighs!",1099958400,13,352,4.268656716417911
2163191,5,B00062IE7I,"I am a loyal fan of all the Leslie Sansone walking programs. The Walkblaster really makes this series so much fun. It's so easy to use. The incline of the Walkblaster really kicks up the workout without adding strain to the knees. This series really makes you sweat but, as in all her videos, Leslie makes it a fun workout. Thanks Leslie, for another great program!!!",1098489600,23,367,4.575757575757576
8037585,5,B00062IE7I,I wanted to let everyone know that I also received a walkblaster with my order.  It qualified for free shipping so this is a really good buy for the contents.  I was most interested in the videos because I alrady have a homemade ramp and have used Gin Miller's Ramp videos.  I wanted to get these videos for some variety and am so glad I did!! I would suggest buying the Gin Miller Ramping videos as well because the walkblaster will work for those workouts.  The workouts seem to be at a nice doable pace and I believe I will get results from combining both sets of workouts!!!,1199923200,,578,4.324074074074074
8037586,5,B00062IE7I,I just recieved my order in the mail and it contained the step and the 3 DVDs.  Hope this clears up the confusion.,1185148800,2,114,3.9565217391304346
8037587,1,B00062IE7I,I called Amazon after reading these reviews. Even though the step is pictured it is NOT in the package only a DVD. I think this page is confusing for customer's. The reviews and pictures imply you are getting the whole set but  you are not. I canceled my order.,1181088000,3,261,4.326530612244898
8037588,5,B00062IE7I,"The Walkblaster series is a fun, easy way to sculpt your lower body.  I have noticed such a difference in my thighs and rear since I started this workout.  The most rigorous of the three DVDs is the Sculpt and Burn, but they are all effective.

I would recommend this series to anyone who feels intimidated by fast, difficult aerobic dance movements.  Leslie makes it fun and relatively easy to follow.",1152835200,3,402,4.619718309859155
8037589,1,B00062IE7I,"I am also wondering what comes with this package.  I see that Amazon has not added any more information since ""Need to Know"" asked back in March.  Does this package come with the step and weights?  Please answer if you know.  Thank you!",1148515200,6,236,4.4186046511627906
8037590,1,B00062IE7I,"Okay, since there is no photo and no description, does anyone know if this item includes the WALKBLASTER exercise equipment or if it's just dvd's?  Customer Service is as confused as I am (read the reviews), and cannot call anyone to find out!  But, the appropriate department will be notified about the confusion and will make updates if they can (it's been 5 days now).  Funny, they managed to update that it now takes 3-4 weeks to ship instead of 2-4, but they can't manage to figure out what it is they are actually selling!!!

Can anyone who has ordered this exact item # describe it better than Amazon can????  Thank you!!!",1141430400,9,629,4.580357142857143
8037591,5,B00062IE7I,"I have been a WATP fan for several years now.  I was getting bored with the same old, same old from Leslie so I thought I'd try this out.  I really enjoy these workouts.  They really get my heart pumping and make me work up a sweat!  I'm glad she finally added some toning to her aerobics.  I find the movements to be easy but effective.  When she alternates between walking and toning I find the workout goes by much quicker!  I hope she'll be releasing more workouts like these!  The set comes with a walkblaster step and two 2 lb. weight balls.  If you just have the DVDs, you can use a regular step and hand weights.",1134518400,8,620,4.186440677966102
8037592,5,B00062IE7I,"I have used this system for over a year. Because of injuries, I had to start very slowly; I didn't even use the walkblaster itself for about 6 months. Now my injuries are almost cured and Leslie's workouts have me moving better than I have in years. Sculpt and Burn includes aerobic, stepping, squatting and the second half include weights.",1129334400,3,340,4.683333333333334
8037593,4,B00062IE7I,"I love Leslie Sansone stuff so I love this product, however the Walkblaster should be less slippery, should have a skid proof finish.",1127692800,,133,4.826086956521739
8037594,4,B00062IE7I,"Over the years I have tried a number of different exercise dvds and have found Leslie's walking tapes to be the ones I ""step"" back to again and again. Rain or shine I can pop Leslie in and take a brisk walk. No fancy dance moves or killing myself with an over the top workout. Though I like to shake up my routine and challenge myself with other types of exercise I find Leslie's DVD's are a quick, simple way to get a workout in. Leslie's workouts are not super intense, but I have tried intense workouts like the ones by Cathe, The Firm, Beach Body and others and I find the Leslie tapes are more effective for me because they are the ones I will do! I will do a Leslie walk a few times a week, add in a little weight lifting and once in a while pop in a tough routine.

Leslie's new Walkblaster system is a nice way to bump up your stepping. The system includes a ramp which is at a tilt. You can easily adjust the height of the ramp by moving a few pins on each leg to make it higher or lower. Because you can select where to step on the ramp (higher or lower) you can adjust the difficulty as you workout and it is easier on the joints than a regular step. The ramp has 3 colored sections. Leslie guides you through floor stepping and then she adds the ramp, calling out the colors to step on.

Leslie includes 3 DVD's with her system. The first is Shape & Thin. Leslie teaches you basic step techniques like side steps, mini kicks etc and explains how to use the Walkblaster. The 30 minute tape goes quickly and is designed to introduce you to the system.

Shape & Firm is just a tad over 30 minutes long and adds intervals of small lunges, squats and walking steps. Shape and Sculpt is 42 minutes and the most intense of the workouts. It includes more lower and upper body work.

The system comes with weighted sandballs. These soft little balls are one pound a piece and are great to add light toning to your routines. You can use them with the workouts to bump them up a notch.

Also included were two small brochures: Fat Blasting Secrets and a 14 Day Low Carb Eating Plan.

The workouts are simple and effective. Nice for a beginner to low intermediate. Hopefully Leslie will add some more intense workouts to use with the Walkblaster system. If you decide you need more intense workouts, Gin Miller ([...]) has made a number of them for the ramp.

The ramp can also be fun to just step up and down on when you have a few minutes..every little bit of fitness helps! All in all a really simple, yet effective way to help you get in shape.",1120435200,23,2548,4.219712525667351
