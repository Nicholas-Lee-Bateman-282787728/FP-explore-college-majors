8036410,5,B00061Q9G2,"This is a very insightful film in which filmmaker Paul Davids does something that is seldom successfully done in a film; he helps the viewer get into his mind a little as he shows, not tells, his experiences painting his paintings among the red rocks of Sedona, Arizona.  It is something he feels he must do; it is his spiritual quest for inner understanding.  He had recently lost his father Jules Davids and was struggling with grief over his death.  But there were many to help him along the way.  See this film; it is poignant and very beautiful. I would like to know what has been happening with the little son of the shaman since this film was made ten years ago. That is why I say: sequel, please!",1331683200,,704,4.392307692307693
8036411,3,B00061Q9G2,"I was thoroughly surprised when the movie started to see Rahelio on the screen. I spent a day with Rahelio in Sedona about 10 years ago. He is a wise 'Spiritual Warrior' with lot's of wisdom to share. I found the movie subject matter very interesting. I felt the filming (quality of filmography, production etc. )
 of it was unfortunately amature. The artist & his father, Rahelio and his son had much to offer. Interesting, the same evening, prior to watching it I watched ""Vincent"" by Paul Cox filmmaker ( a profound documentary and exploration about the life and death of Vincent Van Gogh, a passionate tribute to the life, mind, and art of a man with extraordinary talent and humanity). The contrast in the style of filmmaking was huge. Sorry to say it made this one look more amature. I would love to see a powerful movie, with that high quality, made about Rahelio, incorporating the artist, the genius and others that he has touched. The Shaman still has volumns to share.

8036413,4,B00061Q9G2,"Paul David's has the courage to follow his intuition.  His feelings told him to take the summer off and paint.  He followed this and painted himself into a corner by leaving the world behind and daily going into his colorful meditative painted setting in the wilderness surrounding Sedona.  With a few brush strokes his feelings framed his life that summer and helped him draw on his inner world to be open to the possibility of a modern Shaman to help him express himself and be in the right ""frame of mind"" when he created.
  This creating shown on new vistas where mountains of deeper meaning  were possible such as a web of reincarnation that spun through the lives of many people. Paul's strenth of character to be open to these vistas and pragmatism to bring them to the public are two of this movie's key strengths.",1047600000,,822,4.595890410958904

8036415,5,B00061Q9G2,"""The Artist and the Shaman"" is a thoroughgly charming and delightful movie! The artist is Paul Davids (one of the executive producers of the ""Roswell"" movie) and the shaman is Rohelio, a Native American healer. The beautiful setting is the region in and around Sedona,Arizona.  The basic story is about the possible reincarnation of Paul's deceased father, Jules Davids, as Tonatiuh, the son of Rohelio. The movie shows Paul's grieving at the loss of his beloved father, and how he makes his paintings as part of his healing process. Tonatiuh accompanies him in the spectacular red rock scenery of Sedona, often playing his native flute or drum. The music throughout the movie is very catchy, charming, and delightful. Rohelio performs several Native American ceremonies which are intriguing, and he is an eloquent teacher.  I rate this movie very highly! Entertaining and thoughtful!",1047600000,,884,5.21830985915493
8036416,5,B00061Q9G2,"I enjoyed the wisdom, the creativity and the personal learning the artist portrayed in this documentary set in Sedona, AZ.  His outer journey and inner journey met in his touching search for his father's spirit that brought him to his more authentic self, both universal threads that I and others can relate to. The spirits of nature are felt and subtly seen in his paintings,undoubtedly invoked with the Shaman's drumming.  The music vocals were beautifully evocative.  The paintings, a fresh departure from the usual Southwestern representation, displayed incredible energy and vivid color.",1047600000,,592,5.413043478260869
