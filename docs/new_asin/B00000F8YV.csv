7908024,2,B00000F8YV,"The movie starts with the government (I assume) offering land for $3 per acre to people who must improve said land-and then a railroad moves in and takes over the land. The settlers turn to the courts, but the railroad wins the court battle, with the lawyer promising to appeal.

Jesse James comes to town-or is he a lookalike gambler, wearing the same clothes? Two female reporters have also come in from St. Louis, hoping to get the scoop on Jesse James, the hero for the underdog (or so this film claims). A railroad official hires the gambler to commit crimes to discredit Jesse James, and the story turns to a mix of confusion. In a shootout, who gets killed, James, or the gambler? Unfortunately the movie fails as history (Jesse James was no hero), or as entertainment-we cannot tell who the good guys or the bad guys are. Even the romance at the end is unconvincing. Despite the all-star cast, the movie is a dud.",1471737600,,921,4.548192771084337

The story about Jesse James' death is well known. But the old-timers of Missouri have another legend for this outlaw. A newspaper says that a railroad offers ""Free Land"" to settlers to create products to ship on this railroad. Once they developed the land the railroad will sell it at $3 an acre. Next we see a wood-burning 4-4-0 steam engine running on a track. Then a long line of covered wagons. A man plows with a two-horse team. A pick and shovel gang digs a ditch to allow water to flow. We see fields of crops. But the railroad ignores their promises, they offer developed land for $100 an acre! A lawyer offers his help. But a judge must rule that the promises were worthless since the railroad did not have title to the lands. Even though it was a big swindle. [How often is the government on the side of the common people?] Can the sheriff do anything?

Carson enters the bank to take up the option on the Davis farm, and offers $16,000 cash for deed. Jesse James was arrested in town. [Eyewitness identification is often the cause of wrongful conviction.] We see how the Davis farm was saved. Back in town the bank is robbed! Can Clint Burns be used as a double to create a bad reputation for Jesse James among the farmers? Was Jesse James a Robin Hood who steals from the banks so farmers can get out of debt? [In real life Jesse James and his gang spent their loot in the gambling dens and dance houses of Dallas.] A woman reporter gathers the alleged news. Is Jesse James a Robin Hood or a ruthless outlaw and killer? [Yes.] A gang burns a house so Jesse James will be blamed. The real Jesse James shows up to rescue Sheriff Gabby Whittaker. The reporters will hold this story. The fake James gang goes on a rampage, burning homes and barns.

The townspeople ask the sheriff to protect the county. Two reporters visit the local tavern. Sheriff Gabby hears where Jesse James is resting. Craigart will make sure Jesse is caught. The two reporters go there to investigate. Sheriff Gabby shows up and the shooting begins. Jesse shoots Burns and changes into his clothes to escape with his gang. Jesse now has Burns identity. Will he investigate Craigart's mistakes? But Craigart can no longer trust Burns, he knows too much. There is a plan to silence him, but it fails. The Sheriff wants Sloan, he and the Judge go to Craigarts' house to watch. ""Lookout!"" There is a chase for action and a ride to the rescue. Craigart is captured, justice will be done. And Jesse leaves for Nebraska and obscurity.

This is an example of Hollywood history, drama not historical accuracy. It was better than I expected. Roy Rogers starred in many movies and played many roles. The audiences enjoyed his movies so many were produced. Some of the legends about Jesse James were like those about Robin Hood. When people are unhappy and exploited they dream of a champion who will correct the wrongs they suffer. Few films discuss the massive land giveaways that subsidized the railroads. We can only guess how much was kicked-back to Senators and Congressmen, like in the Credit Mobilier scandal. Is it different today? Not if I understand TARP. Was the bankruptcy of an automobile manufacturer a way to swindle the owners of common shares?",1290988800,3,3262,4.590051457975986
