6979571,5,B00SBRVQS4,"Cool, stylish, at times breath taking. This series is superior to the films because of the classy manner and smooth good looks of Chris Vance.

Set mainly in Europe, this is very much the style of the 007 films flashing across the countryside. The lead character, Frank, ex special forces etc, is the professional transporter who also kicks derriere with aplomb. Its one of those characters who never seem to have a heart rate above 50, who never seems flustered, never raises his voice above conversation level even in crisis situations, whose hair never is out of place and who wouldnt know the meaning of a sweaty brow. You almost expect him to ask for the shaken not stirred martini while doing the tonne on a sharp turning cliff-side street..

And some of the car action is as good as you'll see on the screen with panoramic background to boot. The range of vehicles used is something from an upmarket motor show though Frank seems to finally go for a red Audi R8 Spyder, replete with bullet proof body and glass and supercharged motor.

This series is every boy's dream, and every girl's dream heroic beau. Pure fantasy turbo charged. Reminds me of elements of Cary Grant in  Hitchcock's To Catch a Thief.

Great way to spend an hour locked in make believe. The second series has some character changes but the thrust apparently remains the same. All style, glamour and class at high speed..",1425772800,23,1397,4.685714285714286
6979572,5,B00SBRVQS4,"I LOVE THIS SERIES!! Chris Vance is excellent as Frank Martin. And there is so much action; car chases, fight sequences. bad guys and gunfights.  The series is a film-quality production with interesting locales and plots. And for the ladies, Chris Vance and his dreamboat eyes!  It's definitely a great show for couples, not just men.  I bought Season 1 and cannot wait to own Season 2, and I'm a lady.  I'm also hoping Season 3 will be done so we can continue to watch this great, action-packed series. I recommend you buy this series so you can watch the episodes again and again.",1425600000,7,582,4.5673076923076925

6979574,5,B00SBRVQS4,"Absolutely the best of all the Transporters movies, this series stars Chris Vance, the wonderful English actor that could easily play James Bond as he is both gentleman, fighter (he does his own stunts) and just so hard to take your eyes off of him. He is surrounded by great actors, and there is plenty of cars, crashes, bad guys and scenery from Europe to the US, Canada and more. Action packed thriller with plenty of laughs!",1463270400,2,428,4.571428571428571

6979577,5,B00SBRVQS4,"The Transporter: The Series is an excellent television show. I discovered it rather late, and have just found out that the series ended after two seasons. This is a shame Chris Vance does a great job portraying Frank the Transporter, in some ways I ended up liking his portrayal even more than Statham's because Vance's Frank is a more well rounded human being.

The character of Deiter is a fun one, he fixes Frank's cars and adds all sorts of extras on them. And of course, Frank's police officer friend, the same actor from the movies is in many of the shows. This is another plus as I always liked his character.

Each show is different with various reasons why Frank has to step on the gas. Some of the driving sequences and fight scenes surpass the movies. The shows producers could have left out the nudity however and some of the more perverse segments that seemed to have been added for no real reason. Although the series doesn't last long in terms of seasons, this is surely something that fans of the movies will want to have! It is much better than the lousy Refueled movie",1455580800,2,1086,4.50761421319797

6979579,5,B00SBRVQS4,"Im a big fan of the Jason Statham Transporter movies, and was curious how this tv series was, and i was impressed right off. I Love the way they made the stories individual missions for one thing, and the actor portrays another version of Frank Martin to great character. NOt to mention cool fast cars, gritty fight scenes and all around good series. Need i say more? Yes....buy this if you like the movies style Transporter and it won't dissapoint.

Hero never changes facial expression from bland smug smirkyface,  never creases his shirt during a punchup of Olympian proportions, never gets a mark on his face nor a hair out of place,  he's so tough he can withstand anything and still deliver on time every time !
It's a soapie with car chases and punchups and bodyblows and silly plots and very ordinary acting, supported by  Sound Effects people thumping  cardboard boxes for fake ouch bodyblow noises,  syncro-mesh crunching during high speed car chases,  but there was a plus:  the scenery was mostly gorgeous and locations mostly appealing.  Very ordinary acting all round.  Why oh why do people decide to remake a good film into long drawn out disappointing series with ridiculous plots?  So the young demographic who love this mindless action stuff will keep throwing dollars at them to entertain themselves.  It's very transparent, but people will love it anyway.",1439251200,,995,4.963636363636364

I enjoy everything about this show. The fight scenes are amazing, and the edge of your seat driving scenes are off the hook. It's not corny and the writing is on par.  I'm ordering Season 1 and Season 2.  Most people don't like when established characters move on for whatever reason, but it is what it is.

6979618,5,B00SBRVQS4,"I didn't really do a lot of research before buying this.  My son and I both loved the Transporter movies with Jason Statham and I thought, if nothing else, it might have some good driving in it.  Imiagine my surprise when we received the DVD and I see Chris Vance on the cover as the star.  We've loved him in everything else we've seen him in (Rizzoli & Isles, Burn Notice, Dexter, Prison Break).  He's an excellent actor showing a wide range of emotions and a very attractive man.  Love that grin of his!

Anyway, so I had pretty high hopes for this series and I wasn't disappointed.  The acting is superb and his co-starFrancois Berleand, who was also in the JS movie series provides a great counterpoint to the Frank Martin character.  The writing is good, actually pretty intelligent.  So far all of the supporting cast and guest stars have provided a good, entertaining, and very watchable series.  Can't wait for season 2!",1431734400,,929,4.609756097560975

6979623,5,B00SBRVQS4,"All in all, a great action packed series. Chris Vance was made for this part. Quite frankly, he would make a fantastic 007 main star. There is some nudity and foul language (the over kill of the ""F"" word  and sex scenes in a few episodes cheapens the integrity of the character and series in my opinion) in some episodes. Throw in a few phoney looking props ( like the severed hand in one episode), and the rest is very well done. Love the European diversity scenes and ""packages"" delivered.
Great mix of characters. I started to deduct one star for the negatives mentioned above, but one can always fast forward that which is not to their liking, etc. If a series motivates one to like it so much they have to get on to the adventure of the next one, it most likely should be rated five stars - which is why I gave this series five stars.",1429574400,3,839,4.276729559748428

The vehicles are beautiful and so are the women. I would just have liked to see less of the women. In one episode, they even showed the sexual act with frontal nudity for the lady and the man's backend while he was performing the act.

6979633,4,B00SBRVQS4,"STILL ADRENALINE FILLED AND EVEN MORE DEPTH, THE MODEST BUDGET LESSENS THE FILMING POLISH JUST A LITTLE WITHOUT HAMPERING THE STORY

NOTE ABOUT RATING AND CONTENT:  In some places there is no rating and in other areas it states TV 14.  This series was made for cable and contains language, nudity, and violence that would more often be found in an R rating.

This series is a co-production by Canadian and French television and is a spinoff of the film franchise by the same name created by Luc Besson.  It's a little more complicated to simply say this is better or worse than the movie franchise.  With a per-episode budget of just around $40,000 (not even an actor's salary in big budget TV) it's not just the laws of finance working against you, it's the laws of physics.  However, I have to say that what they accomplished for that budget is quit amazing!  Mainly the small drop off is seen in the filming and special effects.  That is not to say it is bad.  You just can't expect cinema quality filming on a budget modest for TV.  The areas where we exceed expectations are numerous.  The run time allowed by a TV serial means the addition of depth such as story arcs, back story on Martin, and additional support characters with their own interesting personalities.  As for Frank Martin himself, Vance offers more suave and finesse where Stratham is more brute force and lone wolfish.  Which is better is a matter of personal preference.  The added characters also offer the chance for more natural humor here and there.  It's not too cheesy though (I didn't say there was no cheese at all).  In fact, I would say one of the strengths of the show is that they didn't become too trite or silly as they adapted to TV.  The filming may be small screen at times, but the feel is still somewhat cinema like epic within reason.

THE STORY (no spoilers):  Frank Martin (Chris Vance) is a freelance courier with a mysterious past and a dangerous present.  He is much more than a skilled driver.  He is the Transporter.  He operates by three simple rules (though he often postulates on more), 1. Never change the deal. 2. No names. 3. Never open the package.  Because of his exceptional skill set and discretion, he is the best at what he does.  He is constantly sought after for the dangerous and not always legal jobs where protecting the package is a priority.  In this TV version, we add Carla (Andrea Osvrt) who is his manager of sort and also tech & information support via computer networks.  She is one of the most statuesque women one can imagine, but she is far more than eye candy.  She seems to practically run the business end of his operation.  Dieter Hausmann (Charly Hbner) is Martin's German mechanic and likely best friend.  He loves the machines he cares for and gives them names and personalities.  This guy is hilarious!  The TV format also allows for many more love interests and let's just say Martin is not so good at obeying rule number 3.  The individual episodes give a much more diverse spectrum of missions and some were pretty different and interesting.  There was only 1 or 2 episodes that didn't do much for me.  Most were fantastic.  Through it all, there is a shadowy organization that seems to be trailing Martin and biding their time to make a move.

OTHER THOUGHTS:  The fight choreography is terrific though it is of course HEAVILY choreographed.  In a way, that keeps the stylized feel of the franchise in tact and it's entertaining.  It is not all together natural though.  That's not the point.  There is an exchange of branding in that Martin virtually always drives an Audi instead of the trademark BMW of the movie franchise.  The bad guys almost always drive Mercedes just to add a little more product placement.  Some hard core fans may be attached to that isolation that Martin has in the movies in order to maintain his anonymity and mysteriousness.  However, the added depth of the personalities around him and his interaction with them here is terrific.  I felt it added a lot.  The series starts well but can be a little slow in 1 or 2 early episodes.  Despite how much I enjoyed this series, I am not going to tell you it's perfect.  The terrific story arcs are sometimes thinly inserted (like the shadowy organization trailing him) almost like a small reminder at the end of an episode that there is something greater going on.  I suggest a rental to check it out, unless you get a great price just to buy.",1426464000,11,4457,4.579746835443038
8698010,4,B00SBRVQS4,"This series had very good production values and nice scenery.  That was probably part of the reason the series didn't last.  It even employed many of the stunt coordinators and special effects people from the Transport movies. It was an expensive series to make and I am sure never gained the necessary audience to support those production costs.

The first season was more action and car chases with not a lot of plot. The supporting characters were enjoyable, occasionally adding a touch of humor..  The second season the episodes had more plot and less action, but really became more like James Bond with an Audi.  I think it strayed a bit far from the original premise.

Overall, both seasons are worth checking out",1530144000,,719,4.804878048780488
8698011,4,B00SBRVQS4,"Loved season 1. It is the best of both seasons. In season two, the series was revamped and all of the wonderful, supporting characters from season one, including the mechanic and the operator, were removed from the show. This changes the dynamic, and I really believe if was this dramatic change in season 2 that doomed the series to only two seasons. However, if you buy just one season, get this one. It is much better than season 2.",1524873600,,435,4.518987341772152

8698014,3,B00SBRVQS4,"First the positive - This is a fun series to watch. There are pretty women, a good looking man and fast cars. There are car chases and fist fights. This is very much a James Bond on wheels type of show. Some of the shows are better than others, but most of them are exciting and have an interesting problem for him to solve. Additionally there is an over arching storyline of some mysterious girl tracking him and setting up a relationship with him and making mysterious phone calls.

Second the not so good-
This is very formulaic. Generally, Frank Martin is hired to take something/someone somewhere. Then there are problems that require him beating up people. He makes the delivery and he wins the heart of the girl.
This is NOT something you want for your teenager. There is a lot of nudity (especially of girls) and most of it is just tossed in there for no real reason except to show a girl nude. There is a lot of swearing in season one. Many F bombs dropped for no real reason except to just say that word.
This is why I gave this movie a low four, high three stars.

The first season is the best. The second season has many more problems.",1483315200,,1147,4.330232558139535
