8362364,2,6305279888,"There seems to be a plot for this little excuse for former Pets & other nude models to prance about  half naked.  Backdrop:  post-apocalyptic world where the women band together & kidnap men.  There's a woman who narrates the entire movie just so they can continue with the idea this is NOT about these women being shot nude or half nude in a stylistic manner.  Drop frame, sepia, black & white, negatives, etc.  Julie Strain gets naked the most, even wears a blonde wig.  I just wish they would've gone with one format or the other.  Combined, it's stupid.  Either you're trying to survive or you're just a bunch of models posing for the camera.",1359158400,2,646,4.547826086956522
