6877575,5,B00QR1JY76,"As a guitarist (bad guitarist) I have ALWAYS loved Jeff Beck's playing...I really like this dvd for it's look into the music scene in which Jeff was involved with in his early years...Most of it I knew..but there was some fresh stuff and people that made it interesting...I have to admit I would've LOVED more actually music..there weren't any full performances..so if you're looking for that you'd be disappointed...There's a lot of ""performance"" dvd's out there that I would just as soon throw into the round file..this one I'm sharing with my friends...",1426032000,2,556,4.989247311827957
6877576,2,B00QR1JY76,"Sorry, kids, but this video is a big turkey. There is no rare footage or photographs. Nothing new whatsoever. You can see it all on YouTube. If you are a big Beck fan, it will bore you to tears. Jeff is coming out with his own authorized DVD, which is promising. Save your hard earned money for that one.",1425254400,3,304,4.169491525423729
6877577,3,B00QR1JY76,"As a longtime Jeff Beck fan, I bought this ""unauthorized"" DVD with much anticipation only to be sadly disappointed with the redundant, unrelated and tedious minutia from all the talking heads.  Yes, I did learn many new details about Beck's early years, but this could have been accomplished in less than half the time.

This DVD should of at least included the entire Beck's Bolero and Plynth (water down the drain) tracks - specially since good Plynth video exists.  That video alone would have made this DVD more fun.  The DVD ends hastily in amateurish fashion.

To summarize: Too much wasted talk from others and not enough from Beck himself.

We can always hope that Beck will authorize a biographical DVD before the cast and characters are dead and gone.",1425168000,11,761,4.815384615384615
6877578,5,B00QR1JY76,"This is a great little doc. Of course you will want it to go on and on as it ends with Blow by Blow which is really the start of Jeff's real rise to major notice. I have been a Beck fan since I first saw the Yardbirds on Shindig and Hullablallo when I was learning how to imitate the Beatles on my brand new crummy Japanese copy Fender Jaguar. This guy was a revelation and a tremedous inspiration right there and then. To see these clips (most of which I have seen before) gathered in one place to view over and over is a delight. I saw the Rod / Beck group at the Filmore East, I saw The next Beck / Tench band, at Carnegie Hall and I have tried to catch just about every solo tour in the years since then. I love this guy!!!! If you are a Classic Rock fan, or a wannabe guitarist or a person who appreciates the magic of the Electric guitar at all, then get this and enjoy it.",1424822400,16,879,3.943820224719101
6877579,4,B00QR1JY76,"Being a huge Jeff Beck fan along with being a Yardbirds fan, Eric Clapton fan, Led Zeppelin fan and many other of the great 60's guitar players and bands, I've seen many new bio dvd's, so I pretty much know what to expect from a biography dvd on Jeff Beck. Most all the biographies being made on dvd of the great guitar players or great '60's bands are all pretty much the same. You get to hear from some of the original band mates, biographers, magazine editors, music critics, journalists, managers, old film clips of interviews, bits of the artist himself from old interviews, old music film clips and even cd clips of the music. What makes a bio dvd worth watching is how well the story is told along with never been seen before footage or photos to keep a real fan watching.

A Man For All Seasons- Jeff Beck in the 1960's does tell a pretty good story of Jeff Beck's beginnings in the '60's- but as with most of the other bio dvd's being made, starts out strong, then slowly gets lost in the analyzation of the songs being made back then by the people that never knew Jeff Beck in the '60's- the magazine editors, music critics, journalists and biographers. What is missing is what Jeff Beck thought when he put The first Jeff Beck Group together, and not what a magazine editor thinks he thought. Jeff Beck's presence is hugely missing, as Jeff Beck is a most talented, creative, interesting and complicated personality whose work only he can accurately describe.

Seeing bits of old interviews of Jeff Beck is not anything new, and a tiny one or two lines from him isn't telling us much either. I enjoyed the dvd's beginning stories from Jeff Beck's band mates from The Yardbirds- Jim McCarty the drummer and Chris Dreja the bass guitarist- these were the best stories from the musicians who played with Jeff back then- but there just isn't enough of their interesting stories on this dvd. The managers also told some great stories- Yardbird's managers Giorgio Gomelsky and Simon Napier Bell made the story of Jeff Beck's beginnings much more informative. I also really enjoyed the stories of Jeff Back's first guitar- one he made himself as a child using a fence post. Also great was hearing a bit from Max Middleton who played piano in the Jeff Beck Group.

As Jeff Beck's story is told, there are some great clips of other bands- Mary Ford and Les Paul, Gene Vincent And The Blue Caps and others who had an influence on the young Jeff Beck. The dvd touches on Jeff Beck's early work with The Tridents- which is pretty rare and nice to hear about. I always found the most interesting part of The Yardbirds was when Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page played together with the band. These two powerhouses went their separate ways into Led Zeppelin and The Jeff Beck Group. Both Beck and Page's talents were bigger than life and needed room to soar, so it was not surprising to see them both form their own bands. There are some great stories on how The Jeff Beck Group kept evolving from it's talented beginnings with Rod Stewart and Ron Wood that I enjoyed hearing.

For the huge Beck fan, there are quite a few photos that I've never seen before from the '60's and quite a few stories I haven't heard before from the people who actually knew Jeff Beck back in the '60's, making it worth buying. But, the great music is all in tiny clips- all of which most I've seen before, except for some bits of the first Jeff Beck Group with Rod Stewart and Ron Wood. All The Yardbirds footage clips I've seen before many times. The interview clips from the more recent past have all been seen before. The dvd is 2 hours long, and if you eliminated the analyzation of the songs, you would pretty much eliminate almost half of the dvd. There is a short Bonus Feature of Pamela Des Barres talking very briefly about Jeff Beck performing on her GTO (Girls Together Outrageously) album- Permanent Damage- but there is nothing of substance here.

What is missing is Jeff Beck himself. I would have liked to know what he was thinking when he left The Yardbirds and formed his own band- The Jeff Beck Group. At least this dvd touched on what they thought were the reasons- but hearing from Beck himself would have made this a 5 Star dvd. Still, hearing from some of his band mates and managers made it worth watching, along with quite a few pictures I hadn't seen before. I did enjoy the tiny bits about The Tridents too. The bits of performance footage have almost all been seen before on other dvd's and they are always too short. I would buy this as a Jeff Beck fan just for the half of the dvd that featured the actual band mates and managers who knew Jeff Beck, but I can do without the half of over analyzing every song. Overall, it's a 4 Star dvd that I did enjoy until a biography dvd featuring Jeff Beck himself comes out some day.",1423872000,25,4820,4.4665153234960275
6877580,5,B00QR1JY76,"Pre-ordered this as I'm a big Jeff Beck and Yardbirds fan.

It's a bit over two hours long, really goes in-depth behind some of the music/appearances, and has some great interviews from his Yardbirds bandmates, Beck's managers, and even some interesting tidbits from Rod Stewart and Ron Wood.  Some of it goes into the genius of Beck and his playing, discusses what might have been, and has some interesting insight into why he may not have been as successful (from a mass acceptance) as his peers.  I just wish they might have got some interviews and thoughts from Jimmy Page.

All in all this is a great DVD for anyone who is a guitar fan, enjoyed the 60s music, and certainly those who are Beck fans like myself will really enjoy this.  I didn't become a Beck fan until Wired and then started going back to listen to his earlier music and REALLY became a fan.  I missed the 60s and didn't appreciate how creative he was for the time - this DVD captures it and was great to watch.  My 22 year old son enjoyed it as well.  Very inspirational.

Looking forward to a follow-up covering the 70s and beyond.",1423612800,10,1104,4.45273631840796

8692443,5,B00QR1JY76,"As a very long time fan of Jeff Beck, I liked this documentary very, very much. We were lucky enough to see and hear him with both The Yardbirds and The Jeff Beck Group(Truth) with Rod Stewart. There were a lot of video clips and still photos I've never seen before, unlike other reviewers. The interviews with the 'inside' people(producers) filled in a lot of information that we'd read about, but hearing it first hand was great. All The Yardbirds background stories were fantastic too. And it shows that music era exactly, as I remember it: every 3 months, something different to hear. And I just saw and hear Jeff in April, still the greatest, most gifted electric guitarist of my generation.
By the way, this poster in the picture is from December 23rd, 1965. My band, The Beau Street Runners, is listed at the bottom of the playbill.

Highly Recommended.",1438300800,,860,4.695364238410596
8692444,3,B00QR1JY76,"I'm always keen to discover more about influential and innovative musicians such as Jeff beck.
The first thing I noted was that this documentary was not authorized by Jeff Beck. Having said that there are plenty of clips going back to the 60's and some reasonable interviews. These are strung together in a clunky manner. I feel Jeff is worthy of a Ken Burns quality production in the future.......lets hope.
I enjoyed this the material presented and found myself using it to help me source full length clips and and related information on YouTube. Good for a one time view and then pass it on to a friend.",1431734400,3,606,4.62037037037037

8692448,4,B00QR1JY76,I enjoyed the DVD very much.  Lots of good information and footage or Jeff Beck but it spends a little too much time of other artists and the general British Invasion.  Not enough material of Beck alone to fill two hours worth of DVD.,1428624000,,234,4.295454545454546
