8383939,5,B002XYQMGM,I watched this online at first but before I even finished it I purchased the whole series. I absolutely love this show! Iljimae with Lee Jun Ki is very well done and worth watching countless times. The return of Iljimae is not really a continuation of the first. Although both shows are about Iljimae they each have a different flare to them. Even if you haven't seen Iljimae with Lee Jun Ki you will still love this show. I fell in love with the lead Jung il Woo after 10 minutes of watching. Jung il Woo brings so much to the character of Iljimae and you cant help but fall in love with him. I would highly recommend this show to anyone who loves a great action movie with depth in the plot. From the fist episode to the last I was hooked to the TV with anticipation for the next episode.,1435363200,2,790,4.203947368421052

8383943,5,B002XYQMGM,"Jung Il Woo is one of my favorite actors. I had seen Il Jimae before, so when I saw another set for it I couldn't help it. I really like the whole robin hood idea. Whenever they make a film or show like that, I have to watch it.",1393545600,5,228,3.673469387755102
8383944,5,B002XYQMGM,"Jung Il Woo, the Korean Cary Grant. Although young, this Korean thespian is destined  for cinemagraphic greatness.  He is charming in his characterizations be it comedic or dramatic.  This particular role he was chosen for provided him with a myraid of opportunities and he portrayed the character of Iljamae to perfection.  As an avid American moviegoer, my comparisons to this genre of foreign movie actors can only be based on America's greatest actors. The story content is cohesive along with the introduction of characters.  This drama is packed with intrigue, excitement and loads of feelgood moments.  I highly recommend this Kdrama, as it was certainly worth watching.",1356480000,11,677,5.280373831775701
