8110790,2,B000EJZSYU,Incredibly boring. My children and I immediately lost interest in this. The main actor is so monotone!!! The science experiments are cool though and I'd watch it just to get ideas for my kids but probably will never show it to them again.,1424736000,2,238,4.558139534883721

8110794,1,B000EJZSYU,"Lot's of good information and project ideas. But wow, talking about taking the fun out of learning. This was so badly put together and dull. I could probably do a better quality one using my smartphone camera and my 6 year old daughter as the host and come up with something 100 times better.",1408752000,2,292,4.425925925925926
8110795,1,B000EJZSYU,This DVD was not what was advertised or expected. The DVD looks fun on the cover but the video is just a person talking on the video the entire time. Very disappointing.,1403913600,3,169,4.3125
