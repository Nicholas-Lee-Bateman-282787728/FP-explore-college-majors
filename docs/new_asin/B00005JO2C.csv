1525330,5,B00005JO2C,"This was one of the best westerns that was ever on tv. James Garner is the highlight in the series. Maverick was serious & irreverent at the same time. This is one series that Warner Bros. ought to release on dvd. There were many classic episodes from this series, way too many to mention here. C'mon Warner, just do it! There are way too many out here waiting to gobble this one up!

We have 124 episodes in the original Maverick & it was actually aired for five seasons, the last one only producing 13 episodes. James Garner was only in the first three seasons, Jack Kelly (though not casted originally) appeared in all five seasons, Roger Moore did one season (the fourth), while Robert Colbert appeared in two episodes the fourth season. James Garner was the real star & Maverick launched his career. Surprisingly, Roger Moore (James Bond) did well in his one season as cousin Beau.

If Warner Bros. ever decides to release this on dvd we will be in for a treat. I, for one, would buy this even if it is a single set. C'mon everybody... let's flood the airwaves at WB asking for this!

For those interested: About 50 episodes are available for viewing at [...] but downloading is not available. Their delivery system is not particularly good though, video will stop multiple times for several seconds. It's better than nothing.",1188864000,119,1331,4.63135593220339
1525331,5,B00005JO2C,maverick is one of the best westerns.the best first episode of any of the westerns. i don`t understand why WB has not released all five seasons it would sell and be a big hit for them again.we need to get back to good tv again.they WB needs to bring back all of the old westerns please WB.,1187395200,56,289,4.087719298245614

1525578,5,B00005JO2C,"I've only begun watching this series but the first few episodes illustrate why it is still well remembered as great television. There were once dozens of Westerns on the big three networks -- almost one every night. ""Maverick"" and James Garner were at the top of that list with a show filled with western adventure, wry humor and anti-hero fun. The show seems as unexpected as it must have seemed to American television viewers almost 60 years ago.",1483401600,,448,4.756410256410256

1525582,5,B00005JO2C,"I have loved Maverick ever since I was a little girl and I watched it with my father, who loved Westerns!  I decided to watch them again and I was not disappointed!  The show is still pretty darn good and looking at James Garner is no hardship whatsoever.  A truly handsome and yet endearing actor, his wry sense of humor as Bret Maverick really made this show great. In fact, the show itself, while often quite dramatic, always has some comic twists going on.

Not all older shows fare well when resurrected.  Some of them are distressingly corny and badly acted but this one stands the test of time.",1478390400,,601,4.477064220183486

1525692,3,B00005JO2C,"Loved the series. Love many of the old series from the fiftys, but I won't be buying any more from Amazon.  The shows need to be seen in their original aspect ratios -- not zoomed in to fill the screen, which cuts picture quality and eliminates part of the picture.  The last Maverick episode I watched was in wide screen aspect, which made all the characters look 4 foot tall with heads 1 foot wide.  No more old series for me. I'll stick with Netflix which shows them properly.",1469491200,,479,4.359550561797753

1525694,3,B00005JO2C,Garner is good...Jack kelly is just so-so...at times he is great.  tried to watch the entire series but they started to charge $1.99 per episode even with a stars subscription.

1525695,5,B00005JO2C,"Before I bought this for my dad as a gift, the only Maverick I knew of was the Movie with Mel Gibson.  I recommend watching the movie. Very funny.  Very clever.  This Television series is also very well thought out.  Aside from what we would view as cheesy fight scenes now, especially since we focus on those a lot more, this television series makes up for that with clever story lines, witty characters and great one liners.  Easily one of my favorite television shows!",1467504000,,471,4.559523809523809
1525696,5,B00005JO2C,"How could this not get 5 stars?  All three of the Mavericks were great.  When you could sit down and get suspense, humor and drama.  When TV was fun, clean, wholesome entertainment.  Wish they made series like this now.",1467158400,,219,4.538461538461538

1525698,4,B00005JO2C,"This was one of the first TV shows I saw as a kid growing up in Iceland. It was broadcast through the American Naval base there. We did not have a TV so my friends and I would go downtown to a store selling TVs and watched this show through the window.  To be able to watch this show on my Galaxy phone only shows how far we have come. I eventually got a TV and enjoyed all the American TV westerns. This is why it was important to me to get STARZ which includes the ENCORE channels, one of which is the Western channel.  They have been playing all of those old westerns, like Wanted Dead or Alive, Have Gun Will Travel )the best in my book), Gunsmoke, Cheyenne and others, Top marks to Starz and Amazon to bring it to all my devices.",1466726400,,734,4.055172413793104

1526061,5,B00005JO2C,"This charming western made stars of James Garner (Bret Maverick) and Jack Kelly (Bart Maverick) and came from the fertile creative mind of writer-producer Roy Huggins (""The Fugitive,"" ""77 Sunset Strip,"" ""The Rockford Files,"" ""Cheyenne,"" etc). Still fun to watch today, it has several truly classic episodes: ""Shady Deal at Sunny Acres,"" a precursor to ""The Sting"" with Garner enlisting the aid of Brother Bart, Dandy Jim Buckley (Efrem Zimbalist Jr,), Samantha Crawford (Diane Brewster), Gentleman Jack Darby (Richard Long), Big Mike McComb (Leo Gordon) and Cindy Lou Brown (Arlene Howell) in getting his money back from a crooked banker (John Dehner); ""Gun-Shy,"" a take-off on ""Gunsmoke""; ""The Saga of Waco Williams,"" with Wayde Preston (""Colt .45"") in the title role, was the template for Tom Selleck's ""teflon hero"" Lance White in ""The Rockford Files"" (which, in turn, was essentially Bret Maverick as a detective), ""The Rivals,"" an adaptation of a Robert Louis Stevenson story, with Roger Moore switching places with Garner, presaging Moore's turn as British cousin Beau Maverick in the fourth season; ""Hadley's Hunter's,"" wherein Kelly attempts to enlist the aid of other Warner Bros. western heroes (Clint ""Cheyenne"" Walker, Ty ""Bronco"" Hardin, Will ""Sugarfoot"" Hutchins, etc.) in tracking down a fugitive from the law played by Robert Colbert (who went on to become the fourth Maverick, Brent) and ""Three Queens Full,"" a spoof of ""Bonanza."" While Garner started as a ""solo"" act in the first seven shows, it was Kelly who lasted the longest in the title role, had the highest-rated episode and managed to be just as watchable in the increasingly low-budget final season. Between them, Garner and Kelly ""stole"" Sunday nights from Ed Sullivan and Steve Allen while leaving the Wild West a much milder and funnier place. Stars on the way up and the way down the ladder of fame added to the joy of watching ""Maverick,"" making the three Maverick brothers, an English cousin and sage old ""Pappy"" folks we are still willing to welcome into our living rooms.

Brett and Bart Maverick (played by James Garner and Jack Kelly respectively) play Everyman on the U.S. frontier of the 1870s. More often than not, the Maverick boys solve the problems in their stories with their brains rather than with their brawn. This series is the Thinking Man's Western.

Diane Brewster as Samantha Crawford, Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as Dandy Jim Buckley and a small group of recurring favorites, many of them joining forces in one episode during season 2 'Shady Deal In Sunny Acres'. Watching the Mel Gibson movie after seeing the series was a real disappointment. Mel is no Maverick and if Jody Foster was supposed to play her character in the manner of Brewster's Crawford, she too was a failure.",1426982400,,593,4.5

1526129,4,B00005JO2C,"I always cringe when a slightly younger generation tells me about how great were old programs like like Three's Company or Gilligan's Island. Having grown up in what some now call the Golden Age, I do not remember programming so determined to tell me I am stupid.

Then again that generation did not have a posse of great western's flickering in black and white across the three network channels.

 This brings us to Maverick, staring James Garner as the sometimes hard, but usually bemused common sense guy with a fast draw and a good eye for cards. Throw in the occasional pretty lady, sometimes in distress and sometimes in the off the shoulder salon girl mode and what young'un needs more to say glued to the living room couch?

Yes I agree that Maverick can get kind of formulaic and that this character will be the standard James Garner character for the next 50 or 60 years. Varying the formula was the occasionally shared and alternating adventures with Jack Kelly as brother Bart. The chemistry between them is good and the personality differences between them added dimension and variation. I like Bret and am glad it was his show, but somehow the arrival of Bart always felt like a family reunion.

Sets were at best primitive. In fact I think this had to be a western because the outside was free. Spare yourself the trouble. Comparing the New Orleans sets used here a few times and the NCIS New Orleans , largely shot on location can only cause you to break out in a spontaneous chorus of ""You've Come a Long Way Baby"". On the matter of sets, take a cue from the usually light mood of Bret Maverick and you'll realize sets were not why you liked the old westerns..

For me, season one is enough. I have other westerns I want to re play. As much as I like Garner and  Maverick is a program I enjoyed and still enjoy; 27 episodes is enough.",1422576000,2,1851,4.491071428571429

1526131,5,B00005JO2C,"Maverick is the show that put James Garner's name on the map. Although he had appeared in small roles in movies and other TV series, this show rocketed him to stardom. He appeared in the first three seasons and then quit in a dispute with Warner Bros TV. There were five seasons altogether and all have been released on DVD. Roger Moore, famous for the TV series ""The Saint"" and playing James Bond appears in the fourth season as cousin Beau from Great Britain and Robert Colbert famous as Dr Doug Philips in the cult sci-fi series ""The Time Tunnel"" appears as another brother, Brent in the fifth and final season. Jack Kelly played brother Bart throughout the series. James Garner would appear in one episode in the fourth season as this was already filmed before that season started.
This series tells the tale of two gamblers who travelled throughout the west getting into various predicaments. Played more for laughs than your traditional western series this show became very popular in the late fifties.
Two episodes to watch out for is, Gun-Shy, a parody on ""Gunsmoke"" with a marshal called Mort Dooley in the second season and  Three Queens Full, a parody of ""Bonanza"" with three brothers called Moose, Henry and small Paul Wheelwright in the fifth season.
This series sometimes alternated with two other western series ""Sugarfoot"" and ""Bronco"" when originally aired.
Bret Maverick played by Garner was no hero when it came to trouble preferring to use cunning and cons to get out of a situation. Pretty much like his character on ""The Rockford Files"". Garner would also sometimes play another character, in make up, on the show called Pappy. Father to Bret and Bart.
Made in black and white this is one classic western. A full house in gambling terms.",1422144000,,1759,4.805280528052806

I refuse to watch most of the garbage of today so I've been on the hunt for quality TV shows and movies of Hollywood's Golden Age.

Suffice it to say that Maverick delivers in spades. I can't say I grew up with old shows like this but I am most thankful they are readily available. The acting is on point and believable. The writing is always clever and intriguing. I also very much enjoy the backdrops and set pieces.

Currently I'm watching season two and I think it's turning out even better. For interesting and worthwhile entertainment you can't beat this show. Maverick is a classic.",1421107200,,736,4.444444444444445

1526135,5,B00005JO2C,"The 'Boot Hill Soliloquy's' that introduced each episode of Gunsmoke for the first few seasons seem ridiculous and somewhat scary by the time you've gone through all twenty seasons and 650 episodes, and started the series over again (which is a scary thought itself). Marshall Dillon literally kills more 'bad guys' than Dodge City has people, making Boot Hill -- the place where dead bank robbers and cattle rustlers and gunfighters are buried -- a Necropolis that matches the town below, a dark mirror and testament to the one-man holocaust whose double-decade slaughterama is legitimised by a badge. Compared to the typically light-hearted predicaments of 'Maverick', the 'Gunsmoke' of the 1950's and early 60's featured some pretty dark, intelligent scripts, mostly by John Meston.

The Mavericks, on the other hand, both Brett and Bart, have very few notches on their guns. Maybe the best show of its time, and one of the best series in TV history, 'Maverick' featured incredibly clever writing and great acting. James Garner is in his prime, playing the slick gambler and original title character. His performances throughout the first three seasons are dead-on, and the character truly was unlike anything the public had seen before. Brett was no gunman, but he could shoot if he had to, and fight as well. But for the most part, he relied on his mind, his imagination, and his charm to extricate himself from dangerous situations. His brother, Bart, played by Jack Kelly, was introduced early in season 1, since the demanding production schedule required that two episodes be filmed simultaneously. Despite being a bit hokey, forgoing the dry, low key wit of Garner for an interesting mix of Jimmy Stewart and Jerry Lewis, Kelly would've been a great solo star. But he came a distant second to Garner, and it took a while for audiences to warm to him. Some of the best episodes featured both brothers, like the classic 'Shady Deal at Sunny Acres' -- which was also the 'inspiration' for the plot of the popular film 'The Sting'. Eventually, Kelly owned the role, and would go on to lead the series for seasons 4 and 5 after Garner quit, sharing episodes with new number 2, Roger Moore.

There aren't too many shows I can say this about, but every episode of seasons 1, 2, and 3 are great, thoroughly enjoyable. There's even a couple dead-on parody episodes, one of 'Gunsmoke', and one of 'Bonanza'. Maverick doesn't have Gunsmoke's mountain of bullet-riddled corpses; Bonanza saw Little Joe, Hoss, or Adam, arrested for crimes they didn't commit almost every third episode, and Little Joe racks up a pretty ludicrous body-count of his own; even Maverick has it's faults... if you pay attention to how many times Brett and Bart are knocked unconscious by a blow to the back of the head, you'll discover it's dozens of times. They should both be brain-dead drooling wrecks by the end of season 3. But who cares? Maverick is usually half-way to parody, so realism or continuity are irrelevant. Season 1 hits the ground running, but there are a couple rough patches in the first three or four episodes. They're still entertaining, however, and by episode 5 or 6, things are running with a machine-like precision: the writing, directing and acting working together perfectly.",1418601600,2,3278,4.936594202898551
1526136,5,B00005JO2C,"I was too young to watch this when it first ran but over the years I've become so addicted to the series whenever I could find it in reruns. For years I've been begging for the powers that be to release it on DVD and for whatever reason they just waited. In fact they probably waited too long as most of us fans are beginning to go senile and forget the old shows. But finally here it is. So far I've purchased Season One and look forward to adding Season Two soon.

What made this show special was of course James Garner and Jack Kelly, Kelly being added to the cast after about six shows. But you also have to credit the writers with great scripts as well. The show covered the spectrum of western situations with both intensity and tongue-in-cheek humor. Although most episodes starred either Garner or Kelly alone there were also some that included both. When that happened the chemistry was just perfect.

Seriously if you enjoyed the old TV westerns then you just have to have this in your collection. Great characters coupled with wonderful writing equals a great show. My only concern is starting with the release of Season Three the shows are on DVD-Rs which to me spell lesser quality. Plus the price has gotten a bit high as of this review.

The plots are not necessarily predictable - other than the good guy usually prevails. And even when he doesn't, the bad guy suffers in some regard. So it's 50s-60s TV, but good fun. Interesting when you watch these old shows in sequence that you start to notice the same few seconds of film - usually the more expensive location shots - being reused.

The video and sound are fantastic but there are no extra's. I've really gotten to enjoy the commentaries offered by most ""Complete Series"" and a lot of them include little behind the scenes factoids that allow you to get a glimpse behind the cameras. This has none of those. Its simply the show.  Some of the Reviews from 2007 state there is a sound difference on the Disc's.  They must have fixed it as I don't see it here.  Or more likely its that Amazon policy of lumping all the release reviews into one bucket.  So those reviews might have been from a different publisher.

Maverick is an American Western television series with comedic overtones created by Roy Huggins. The show ran from September 22, 1957 to July 8, 1962 on ABC and stars James Garner as Bret Maverick, an adroitly articulate cardsharp. Eight episodes into the first season, he was joined by Jack Kelly as his brother Bart, and from that point on, Garner and Kelly alternated leads from week to week, sometimes teaming up for the occasional two-brother episode. The Mavericks were poker players from Texas who traveled all over the American Old West and on Mississippi riverboats, constantly getting into and out of life-threatening trouble of one sort or another, usually involving money, women, or both. They would typically find themselves weighing a financial windfall against a moral dilemma. More often than not, their consciences trumped their wallets since both Mavericks were intensely ethical. What made this show so popular at the time of the cowboy shows was that are heroes would rather talk their way out of a situation than shoot it out like most of the other iconic cowboys.

First season (1957-1958)

James Garner (as Bret Maverick) is the sole star for the first seven episodes. With episode eight, he's joined by Jack Kelly as brother Bart Maverick. From that point on, the two alternate leads from week to week, sometimes teaming up for the occasional episode. Recurring characters include rival gamblers/operators Samantha Crawford, Dandy Jim Buckley and Big Mike McComb.

Episodes;
~War of the Silver Kings
According to Roy Huggins' Archive of American Television interview, a Warners-owned property called ""War of the Copper Kings"" was selected by the studio as the basis for this episode's script in order to cheat Huggins out of the series creator residuals. The episode also features occasionally recurring character Big Mike McComb (Leo Gordon), here clearly set up to be Maverick's continuing sidekick -- something that never came to pass. Directed by Budd Boetticher.
~Point Blank
Huggins wrote this episode as the pilot but Warner Brothers insisted on first airing an episode based on a property they previously owned. Huggins noted in his Archive of American Television interview that this was done to deny him the residuals for creating the series, a typical gambit for the studio at that time. Huggins wasn't given credit as series creator by the studio until the movie version with Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, and Garner almost forty years later. Mike Connors plays a different character in this episode than his subsequent role in ""The Naked Gallows"" and Peter Brown briefly appears as a deputy. Directed by Budd Boetticher.
~According to Hoyle
Maverick debut of Samantha Crawford, in a high-stakes riverboat poker contest with Maverick. Diane Brewster had also played Crawford the previous year in an episode of Cheyenne called ""Dark Rider"", and writer/producer Roy Huggins had given the character his mother's maiden name. The supporting cast includes Tol Avery, Jay Novello, and Robert Carson. This episode was written by Russell S. Hughes from a story by Horace McCoy and directed by Budd Boetticher.
~Ghost Rider
Maverick offers a strange beauty a ride home in a buckboard then later learns that she had died days before he met her. Billed as ""Stacy Keach"", Stacy Keach's lookalike father portrays the sheriff. Directed by Leslie H. Martinson.
~The Long Hunt Bret
In the aftermath of a failed stagecoach robbery, a gunshot criminal tells Maverick with his dying breaths that an innocent man remains in prison for a crime that he didn't commit, leaving the gambler with the responsibility of straightening it out. Maverick finds himself forced to intermittently become an amateur detective over a period of months. Directed by Douglas Heyes.
~Stage West
Based on a tensely dramatic Louis Lamour story. With Erin O'Brien, Edd Byrnes, and Chubby Johnson. O'Brien's name is listed at the beginning of the episode after Garner's, an honor only accorded a small handful of actors during the series (Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., Peggy King, Adam West, Troy Donahue, etc.). Ray Teal, later the sincere sheriff on Bonanza, performs one of his several Maverick turns as a vicious villain. Directed by Leslie H. Martinson.
~Relic of Fort Tejon
Features Maverick and an affectionate camel. The gambler quickly realizes that a saloon's poker game is rigged and finds himself facing down a professional killer. Tyler MacDuff appears as Drake. Directed by Leslie H. Martinson.
~Hostage
Bart's first appearance occurs in this two-brother episode, the eighth in the series. Bret has summoned Bart to New Orleans help him in a money-making venture: crashing a private cruise where gambling will be taking place. But when the ship captain's daughter is kidnapped, the plan goes awry and the Mavericks are prime suspects in the kidnapping case. For his first several shows, Jack Kelly as Bart wore a grey suit similar in color to his hat for greater contrast with Garner's standard black suit, but eventually switched to mainly a black suit himself while keeping the lighter colored hat, which remained his main costume through most of the run of the series. Written by Gerald Drayson Adams and directed by Richard L. Bare.
~Stampede
Dandy Jim Buckley's first of five appearances. One of many episodes that begin on a riverboat. Chris Alcaide appears as Tony Cadiz in this epic adventure. The second half was remade over a decade later as ""Fight of the Century"" for Garner's subsequent Western television series Nichols. Written by Gerald Drayson Adams and directed by Abner Biberman.
~The Jeweled Gun
The first of Kathleen Crowley's eight different appearances in several roles, a series record by a wide margin for leading ladies. Bret appears in this episode only briefly, receiving under two minutes of screen time. Some of the plot was later cannabilized for a Garner episode entitled ""A Rage for Vengeance"". The early part of ""The Jeweled Gun"" occurs in a Spanish-influenced town. Huggins noted in his Archive of American Television interview that Garner was originally slated to play Kelly's role in this episode but the leads were switched at the last minute due to a scheduling conflict. Although Bart makes brief appearances in several Bret episodes, this is the only time Bret does so in a Bart episode. This is essentially Kelly's first solo episode. Dean Fredericks appears as Mitchell.
~The Wrecker
Based on a Robert Louis Stevenson ocean adventure of the same name. This is the only episode with substantial time accorded to both brothers in which Kelly's role is larger than Garner's. According to Roy Huggins' Archive of American Television interview, the two-brother scripts designated the brothers as ""Maverick 1"" and ""Maverick 2"", with Garner choosing which role he wanted to play due to his seniority in the series.
~The Quick and the Dead
With Gerald Mohr as Doc Holliday and film noir queen Marie Windsor as a saloon owner in this tense drama about an angry gunslinger. Written and directed by Douglas Heyes.
~The Naked Gallows
With Mike Connors as a mustachioed sheriff, Morris Ankrum as a crazed zealot, Sherry Jackson as an underage temptress, and Bing Russell. The story concerns Bart's curiosity about a year-old murder, which ushers in a world of trouble. Bret appears at the opening of the episode, addressing the camera directly to introduce the story. James Garner, however, receives no
billing in this episode.
~The Comstock Conspiracy
With Ruta Lee and Werner Klemperer. Convoluted mysteries keep compounding, leaving a flummoxed Bret to wonder why this is happening. Written by Gene Levitt and directed by Howard W. Koch.
~The Third Rider
With Dick Foran as a lawman thwarted by Bart in this action-packed dramatic episode featuring Barbara Nichols. James Garner, dressed as Bret, makes a 15-second appearance to address the camera directly and introduce the episode, but receives no billing.
~Rage for Vengeance
With Catherine McLeod, Russ Conway as a sheriff, and a villainous John Russell. The only episode in the series in which Bret openly falls in love (with McLeod in her only series appearance) and wants to actually get married.
~Rope of Cards
Bret is reluctantly dragooned into being a juror in a small-town murder case. This courtroom drama features Will Wright as an elderly attorney, Tol Avery as a murderously jealous villain, Joan Marshall as the town schoolteacher, William Reynolds as a man accused of murder, Frank Cady as an even-handed shopkeeper, and Emile Meyer as a truculently stubborn juror. Bret is offscreen, or seen only as a silent juror, for long stretches of time -- at one point, nearly 20 minutes of screen time pass without a line for Bret. However, Bret demonstrates a memorable card trick in the jury room, and according to Roy Huggins in his Archive of American Television interview, every deck of cards in the United States sold out the day after this episode was first broadcast.
~Diamond in the Rough
Written by Marion Hargrove from a story by Roy Huggins. Bart gets assaulted and shanghaied. The San Francisco diamond swindle depicted in this episode was loosely based on the true story of the Great Diamond Hoax of 1872. With Jacqueline Beer, Fredd Wayne, Lilli Valenty, and Sig Ruman. Bart mentions his old friend Dandy Jim Buckley -- who at this point had yet to appear in a Bart episode. As with other early Bart-only episodes, James Garner, dressed as Bret, makes a 15-second appearance to address the camera directly and introduce the episode, but receives no billing.
~Day of Reckoning
A cowboy accuses Bret of cheating during a poker game and a blow to the head from the Marshall accidentally executes the complainant in this complex dramatic episode. With Jean Willes as Lil, Virginia Gregg as Amy Hardie, and Tod Griffin as Jack Wade.
~The Savage Hills
Bart takes a turn with Samantha Crawford on a riverboat adventure. An unbilled James Garner, dressed as Bret, introduces the episode.
~Trail West to Fury
A flashback episode about the Maverick brothers returning from the American Civil War, as told to Dandy Jim Buckley (Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.) while the three of them are trapped during a flood. The plotline involves the Bret and Bart having to avoid Texas after being falsely accused of a murder there, with only a mysteriously disappeared ""tall man"" as a witness who could exonerate them if only they could locate him. Writer/producer Roy Huggins would recycle this plot as the basis for his later television series The Fugitive, with Diane Brewster in a recurring cameo role as Richard Kimble's murdered wife.
~The Burning Sky
With a Mexican Gerald Mohr, Joanna Barnes, and Whitney Blake. An unbilled James Garner, dressed as Bret, introduces the episode, in which Bart is one of a group of six ambushed stagecoach passengers. While the group of six strangers are under siege, it becomes clear the ambushers have targeted this specific stagecoach because one of the six passengers must be secretly carrying something valuable -- but who, and where could it be hidden?
~The Seventh Hand Bret
Against his better judgement, Bret allows Samantha Crawford to sponsor him in a high-stakes poker game -- which soon leads to an apparent double-cross and a cross-country chase. When Samantha idly wonders about what it might be like to marry Bret, he responds, ""We couldn't afford it."" James Philbrook, in his first year as an actor, appears as Sloan in this episode. Written by Russell S. Hughes.
~Plunder of Paradise Bart
Bart and Big Mike hunt for a buried treasure in Mexico, while being relentlessly shadowed by a group of bandits led by Jay Novello. This is the first Maverick episode in which James Garner does not appear at all -- not even to introduce the show. With Ruta Lee as dance hall singer Dolly Muldoon. Written and directed by Douglas Heyes, who also co-wrote Dolly's musical number, ""Virtue Is Its Own Reward"".
~Black Fire
Hans Conried plays a friend who recruits Bret to borrow his identity for a family reunion, one that's presided over by a hard-bitten patriarch portrayed by Will Wright. Charles Bateman made his first screen appearance as Cousin Jeff Martin. One of only two Garner episodes not included in Columbia House's 1990s library of series videotapes (the other was ""Holiday at Hollow Rock""). Though James Garner introduced several Bart-only episodes, this marks the only time that Jack Kelly (unbilled) does so for a Bret-only episode. Kelly addresses the camera directly to introduce the episode, and then narrates the episode in character as Bart.
~Burial Ground of the Gods
After getting robbed at gunpoint of $850, Bart traces thief Paisley Briggs (Claude Akins) to Denver, then to Wyoming. Once there, he gets hired to guard the now-penniless Briggs, who has convinced a putative widow that her husband is still alive, and that Briggs is the only person who knows where to find him.
~Seed of Deception
The Maverick brothers are mistaken for Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp in this two-brother episode. Huggins' wife Adele Mara plays a saloon dancer, and Bart is still wearing his grey suit. Ron Hayes made one of his first acting appearances in the episode. Bret and Bart would technically appear in sixteen episodes together over the course of the series but only share a large amount of screen time in eleven of them. The others are actually Garner's episodes with brief appearances by Kelly except ""The Jeweled Gun"", in which their roles were switched at the last minute due to a schedule conflict and Garner wound up making his single cameo appearance in a Kelly installment.",1410998400,3,14370,5.009205020920502

As an adult the show is cleverly written. While it follows the typical hero loner model, there's generally a clever twist or at least a sign that some thought was put into even the smallest characters. Garner was one of those guys who you almost thought you could be like if you were just a little cooler. I prefer the Garner(Brett Maverick) episodes over the Jack Kelly (Bart Maverick) episodes; kelly was more serious and his plots were more of conventional hero type.

If you watching season 1 the first 7 episodes are all with Garner. Kelly was introduced in episode 8 and then they alternated each week. I've read this was initially done because of the lengthy shooting schedule. In later season it was due to Garner moving on to feature films.

When I was a kid, Maverick was on TV and we used to eat dinner on TV trays to watch it when it was on.  We all three really enjoyed watching it again in series of marathon sessions over a few days.  I was amazed at how much better the scripting and story lines are in this old series compared to the junk on TV these days.  Anyone who enjoyed the original series will enjoy watching it again just as much, if not more.

We've really enjoyed watching these old tv shows at my house.  The late 50's and 60's were full of cowboy shows and they were my husband's favorite.  This is good cheap entertainment for those cold winter weekends-get the popcorn or pizza ready.  These old shows are much more family friendly than most of what's available on the networks today.  Public tv is another option that's worth watching.  It's interesting to watch James Garner develop through the years.  First, Maverick, then,  his ""Support Your Local Sheriff"" era doing the 60's, Rockford Files during the 70's...etc.....

I love the comical twists to the stories and the way the locations move all over the West. I think this must be where I first got intrigued by the west. I must say that the stories and acting are so good I don't even notice that they are in black and white. These are true entertainment!

I thought it would be a purely nostalgia trip (i.e., I'd be the only one to like it), but my wife also seems to dig the show. James Garner is just impossible not to like, and the supporting casts, costumes and scenery are all first rate. Compare the production values of this show to the way more popular Star Trek (original series) and you'll have to laugh at how crude and cheaply produced the latter was (not to knock Star Trek, but it was shot on a shoestring budget). I'll probably buy the second season, too. It's nice to watch some simple entertainment for a change from all the angst of modern TV.",1384041600,,686,4.244274809160306
1526838,5,B00005JO2C,Maverick.  What can be said about this series?  This was a very well produced western by Warner Bros.

As James Garner (Bret Maverick) noted, his character wasn't an anti-hero, as is sometimes said, but a reluctant hero. He preferred to play poker but he didn't like to see other people taken advantage of. The plots are very good, the writing superb and the acting is fine also.

average western rarely is.",1376006400,,244,4.444444444444445
1526928,3,B00005JO2C,"I remember ""Maverick"" as the apex of fifties television, despite the fact that I didn't regularly see television until late in 1958. My wife also remembered the program in much the same way, and she was raised with a television set in her home so early that she doesn't remember a time when television wasn't a part of her life. When the price of ""Maverick: The Complete First Season"" fell a little a few weeks after Christmas last year, we decided to buy a copy although the price did seem a little too dear; sad to say, we were disappointed. The reality of the first season did not match our memories of the series. Granted, I never saw a single episode of the first season until the DVD set arrived (and at that time the second season was not yet available, or I would have ordered it instead because it was the first season of the series I was able to watch and I probably saw ninety per cent of the episodes). I suppose, in hindsight, that we shouldn't have been expected the first season to match our expectations; ""Maverick"" always seemed a little unbalanced, since it was more like two closely related series than a consistently entertaining program. I knew that Jack Kelly hadn't originally been part of the series and had been introduced to give James Garner some relief in a grueling work schedule (and I suspect to keep the individual shows from seeming rushed and/or unpolished). Watching the first seven episodes, I really didn't expect great material nor did I get it, although the stories did seem a bit different than the few other series from the same year that I have been able to see again recently, and the scripts seemed a bit better than those of the competiion. However, once the Bart Maverick character was introduced, I expected much better episodes and, naturally, they did not meet my expectations; the ones with James Garner were appreciably no better, and those with Jack Kelly clearly weren't in the same league. I will admit that there were two or three episodes (one featuring Kelly solo) that were quite good, but I was seeing very little sign of the ""old Maverick Magic."" Frankly, I wonder if any part of the series was as good as I remember it being, because the first season may have had great potential but it seldom realized that potential. It could be that Maverick was head and shoulders above most of the competition at the time, might even have been the apex of fifties television with the '58 - '59 and/or the '59 - '60 season, but that the true high water marks of early television hadn't yet been reached during the first season. To make a long story shorter, we watched the entire first season of Maverick then put it away and have not looked at any of it again (I might dig it out again when the weather gets cold and the nights are longer, but I might not).

 I'll admit that I would like to see at least part of the Second season, and since I would be doing that with lowered expectations it might seem better than I fear. I do know that given my experience with the initial season, the price will have to come down some before I would seriously consider taking another chance.",1375488000,2,3127,4.5132275132275135
1526929,5,B00005JO2C,"After a long wait, the first two seasons of""Maverick"" are now on DVD.  The first two seasons are among the finest in television, much less westerns.  Amidst the plethora of TV westerns at that time, Roy Huggins (creator and producer of ""Maverick"") came out with this gem of a character, as much at home in a dusty cowtown as in a royal gaming salon...wherever there was a poker game.  The show boasts a variety of writers, from Louis L'Amour to Robert Louis Stevenson and deals with some advanced subjects like adultery, child abuse and sexuality, unheard of topics in the whitewashed world of early TV .  Even the Bart Maverick (Jack Kelly) episodes are superior, though some people discount them as 'lesser' shows.  Alas, Roy Huggins took severely ill at the end of season two, and without his guiding hand the show fell apart.  Bret Maverick became a buffoon (and in fact James Garner left the series after season 3) and the scripts became more mundane, lacking the cleverness and sharpness of the early shows.  Although the show continued for 5 seasons, it never matched the quality of the first two seasons.",1375488000,7,1112,4.760416666666667

These western episodes with the handsome, intelligent, down-to-earth gambler are refreshing because of the light approach paired with classic situations from the settling of the west.

1527201,4,B00005JO2C,"This was really a good show.  I am a fan of westerns, and this was one of my favorites growing up.  Great Actors and good story lines.  Fun, clean, entertainment for families.  Though my memory fades me of the episodes, getting re-aquainted will be an enjoyment.

James Garner, and Jack Kelly were so cool, handsome, and smart. Though they got into a jam many times, it was always fun to watch them overcome their dilemma.  Many times, Jack Kelly had to get James Garner out of trouble.  James Garner, a card shark, and Jack Kelly, a ladies man among many other things.

One poster noted the theme song not being present in the episodes, which I did notice as well.  It was not present in the ending of the episode either.  I am not sure when the title song was sang during the show.  So far, only the music was played.  This is not a problem for me, for my interest is in the show itself.  There are some grainy areas in the show as another reviewer pointed out.  As long as its not too bad, I can put up with it.

I will say that the packaging is terrible.  The case is bulky and cheap.  My case was broken on one end.  I placed some tape to secure the other side from losing any of the discs.  This show deserves better packaging as others I've seen in the past.  To save a dollar, some companies will put out just about anything.  This tells me a lot about the value of their image.  Because of this, I gave one less star for the packaging issue.  Five stars for the show though.  Do a better job of packaging these great shows people.",1362528000,4,1539,4.209621993127148

1527273,4,B00005JO2C,"Season 1 of Maverick provides some insight into what the series eventually became.  It started off as a straight Western before figuring out that they could make better use of James Garner's comedic skills and became more of a pastiche.  The season 1 episodes are well written and directed, but lack the brilliance of later seasons.  Also, you have to put up with the occasional ""Bart"" episode with Jack Kelly, which are ok but not as good as the ""Bret"" episodes (Garner introduces these episodes like an apology to the viewers).  I hope more seasons become available and the true brilliance of this series can reach a new generation.",1361664000,2,634,4.7889908256880735

worked well for a gift.  debi",1361232000,2,272,4.09433962264151
1527275,1,B00005JO2C,"Yes Maverick is a great series, probably one of the best TV series ever made.  I watched the episodes when they originally aired and every time they ran in syndication before 1970.  I've only watched a few episodes on this one and have no complaints about the quality for the ones I've watched.

My gripe about this set is that a vocal version of the famous Maverick theme song is not to be found on this DVD.  The tune is heard in strategic places but no lyrics.  The Maverick theme song is arguably the most well known theme song in television history.  It did exactly what a theme song was supposed to do;  set the series premise, and convey enough information about the character to capture the viewer's interest.  Listening to the theme song and seeing the stylized portraits of the gamblers was a sheer delight and it certainly established the proper lighthearted western mood which the series thrived on.

I just can't describe how much I was disappointed to not hear the famous Maverick theme song being sung at any point over the opening or closing credits.  Absence of the theme song is why I haven't watched the entire set by now.  I suppose someday I'll get around to watching the rest.  But without the theme song the hook just isn't there.

""Who is the tall dark stranger there?
Maverick is the name.
Ridin' the trail to who knows where,
Luck is his companion,
Gamblin' is his game.

Smooth as a handle on a gun,
Maverick is the name.
Wild as a wind in Oregon
Blowin' up a canyon.
Easier to tame.

Riverboat ring your bell,
Fair thee well Anna Bell.
Luck is a Lady that he loves the best.
Natches to New Orleans,
Livin' on Jacks and Queens,
Maverick is a legend of the west.

Several posts of the theme song appear on Youtube.

It is entirely possible that the well known theme song did not appear until a subsequent season. My memory back to 1957 is not 100%. On this set there is no voiced song over the closing credits. There is only an instrumental version.

If I had known that the Maverick theme song was not to be found on this DVD I would not have bought it.  I would have waited until a season was published which included the theme song.  I didn't want my investment in Maverick to be more than one season's worth.

So I guess the take-away for prospective purchasers of this DVD is that there is definitely no vocal arrangement of the well known Maverick theme song anywhere on this DVD.",1360886400,15,2412,4.4363636363636365

1527375,4,B00005JO2C,"I don't have much to add to what others have already enthusiastically noted on this board. Maverick is a superior western from back when westerns ruled the TV roost. Garner and, to a lesser extent, Kelly are personable actors who quietly established the low-key, anti-hero persona that Garner would so effectively revive in his '70s series, The Rockford Files. The guest stars are good in that late '50s/early '60s vein and the plots -- many lifted from novellas and short stories written by established authors -- are consistently entertaining. Plus there's that charming theme music. My only knock on the package is that there are no extras. The question is, where's season two? Get on the ball, Warner Bros.",1358294400,4,710,4.974789915966387

Maverick makes you feel good about life and people after you watch it - maybe that's why it is one of the most difficult tv shows to find now-a-days? Roy Huggins was the show's creator and he was kind of a Frank Capra type. Huggins was married to Adele Mara, who is in one of the Maverick episodes. You can get a better idea of what attracted Roy to Adele by watching 'The Inner Circle' 1946 - it is free online, and she is a real hum-dinger. She died just about a year ago.

What a pleasant surprise to find tha Maverick holds up well over the years.  I will caution you that the first few episodes are 1/2 hour and they are not nearly as good as as the later hour long episodes - more time to develop story, charactor, etc.  James Garner's charm and aptitude for humor, as well as script, acting, and sets make this one of the most enjoyable shows of that time era.

Happily, we had become adults when the Encore Westerns channel revived the series. The sardonic humor hooked us; when the channel rotated off Bret and Bart and Beau (and loyal Big Mike McComb, con-woman Samantha, Doc Holliday, Dandy Jim Buckley), we suffered severe withdrawal. Like other fans, we chafed when Warner Bros delayed releasing the series. No wonder that I rushed to buy the Complete First Season. We tried to have some self-control watching these episodes, like never watch more than three episodes on a work-night, but all too soon we've run through the box. Now I see why people think maryjane is medicinal.

Each episode is a riff on larceny, greed, or bullying by a character that would be recognizable today: just substitute Wall Street for St. Louis, Denver, or San Francisco; insert Bernie Madoff, Joe the Plumber, the name of your local gang chieftain (or mayor) for the crook-of-the-episode. And the brothers Bret and Bart, English cousin Beau, and allies show us how to outwit them. Usually.

As my old Pappy used to say, ""Only a fool would issue the full series at once when you can put them out year-by-year.""

The stories are very engaging and Garner and Kelly are excellent in the parts. The received wisdom has always been that Jack Kelly was somehow not as good as James Garner in the lead. I would dispute this. It's true that Garner is the bigger star,and was the original Maverick but Kelly's performance is equally entertaining and he brings his own style to the role. I noticed how his character had a habit of giving people nicknames. The chemistry between the two leads is great and Diane Brewster as Samantha Crawford is wonderful! It would be a pleasure to be conned by her! I can't wait for season 2 (and 3, 4 & 5) to be released. I'm sure they will be. In fact I'd bet on it!",1341964800,7,812,4.245161290322581

Technically, Maverick was a Western, but the plots were varied and interesting, and rarely relied on the traditional themes of ""Westerns"". I've just finished watching the whole set, and almost every episode is a delight, with light-hearted, self-deprecating humor and just enough plot twists, drama, and action, even occasional philosophizing. For those who've seen the somewhat more recent movie ""Maverick"" with Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster, that movie was entirely faithful to the spirit of the series.

My biggest disappointment is that WB either didn't take the time or spend the money to dig up some extras -- promotional appearances by the cast, TV commercials from the time, interviews...ANYthing!
Maybe with Season 2?

Let's hope WB sees fit to bring out the rest of the show's 5 seasons ASAP. And while they're at it, bringing James Garner's NICHOLS and BRET MAVERICK series to DVD would be most welcome.

This 1st season of ""Maverick"" has no extras except you can access the written words of the script
in French, Spanish and for the hearing impaired English.

1527966,4,B00005JO2C,"After all these years, the celebrated first full season of the classic Western series ""Maverick"" finally makes it to DVD. This was the series that made James Garner famous and shaped much of his image that audiences enjoyed in his second TV hit ""The Rockford Files"" as well as films such as ""The Great Escape"" and ""Support Your Local Sheriff"".

When ""Maverick"" first appeared in 1957, it immediately set itself apart from most Western series thanks to its somewhat lighter approach and the magnetic character that Garner had created. While the first episodes of the season are generally more serious in tone than what ""Maverick"" became famous for, the sheer entertainment value and strong story telling is apparent right from the get-go with the pilot episode ""War of the Silver Kings"" which demonstrated the ability of Bret Maverick to quickly think on his feet.

The first seven episodes feature only James Garner, but it was taking too long to shoot each episode to fulfill the contract so they brought in Jack Kelly as Bret's brother Bart Maverick and they began splitting episodes. Kelly brought a much needed addition to the series with his unique personality and style which worked well with Garner. The series then began taking on the somewhat lighter tone that made ""Maverick"" famous.

This 27 episode collection on 7 DVDs is moderately priced and well packaged, though there are no extras whatsoever which is a little sad considering the long wait for this series to come to DVD. There is a small insert which gives a basic description of each episode and highlights the noteworthy guest stars. Otherwise, this collection is fairly bare bones though it does have some highly entertaining episodes such as the aforementioned ""War of the Silver Kings"".

Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this release is the fair to good quality of the episode prints themselves. There are scenes in some episodes such as ""Ghost Rider"" that are grainy and of poor quality. Perhaps the master prints are not in very good shape and either no effort or attempt was made to restore them. Plus, some episodes such as ""According to Hoyle"" and ""The Long Hunt"" actually used old stock footage from previous Warner Brother's western films such as ""Dodge City"".

For the generally poorer quality of the episode prints and the lack of any extras, I am docking this DVD collection one star. However, this should not reflect poorly on the highly entertaining nature of the episodes themselves which certainly deserve a 5 star rating.

For those who want to see James Garner establish the character that he became famous for, this is still a fine collection for those who want to see one of the most entertaining Western TV series ever made.",1338422400,109,2725,4.900216919739696

1527968,5,B00005JO2C,"The first season of Maverick was the best season. There were alot of episodes where James Garner and Jack Kelly starred together and these were the best episodes in my view. Alot of gambling and confidence schemes abound with the likes of Diane Brewster,Efrim Zimbalist and Richard Long( later of Big Valley fame)as some of the culprits. After season 1 it seemed as though either Garner or Kelly would appear as the lone star in most episodes with just a few of them together and in season 3 it seemed that Kelly did the greater share of episodes as Garner was phased out of the series...most of the time as cameo appearances. Season 4 was ok as Kelly and Roger Moore as cousin Beau took turns in most of the episodes and cousin Brent(Colbert)appeared in a few. Season 5 was a short season where Kelly appeared in all the episodes and Peter Breck(later of Big Valley fame)appeared in quite a few as Doc Holliday(Breck also appeared as other characters in the previous seasons).Encore Westerns just finished up a 3 year run of all 5 seasons in Dec 2011 where each episode was shown probably 10 times or more in that span and I got to see all of them several times..........Season 1 is the best season and is a must buy for the tv western fan.",1337904000,7,1241,4.495575221238938

It was charming to read some of the comments of the ""baby boomers"" who were telling Warner to please release this series before they all died out!  I second their words.  But I would add this:  all of my children (we had a large family) positively adore that series because they could sense right away its quality.  I was able to scare up a half dozen episdoes of the series and they just watched them over and over.  When they heard the great news about this upcoming release they were ecstatic.  In fact, all ten of my children have already pre-ordered the set along with their aging Dad.

So, hats off to Warner - and may the rest of the series follow soon.  And may they also bring back other classic Warner shows like the highly entertaining 77 SUNSET STRIP.  And for those of you unfamiliar with MAVERICK I can highly recommend that you give this one a try.

The clever writing and great acting made it stand out to the point that it won the time slot beating some real heavy weights. James Garner made Bret Maverick come to life and put his own personal touch to that character. Jack Kelly tried to do justice to Bart but basicly he copied Garner's style. Roy Huggins was a masterfull writer and some of the most classic and best shows were his work. My favorite was ""Shady Deal at Sunny Acres"" which involved all of the characters introduced earlier.

Glenn Ford's ""The Sheepman"" also had that rare kind of real humor.  Unlike some of the other viewers, I always enjoyed Jack Kelly's episodes, too.

However, I don't get that channel and I miss Maverick soooo much. C'mon WB lots of us want Maverick so just release it!!!",1240185600,8,251,4.340425531914893
1528212,5,B00005JO2C,Is there a sign that this fantastic show will EVER be released? What kind of company refuses to release a sure-fire winner in the middle of a recession?,1236902400,6,152,4.464285714285714
1528333,5,B00005JO2C,When will this ever happen?  We have been waiting so long!  This is a great series.  James Garner is extraordinary in this series.  Please do what you can to expedite this series onto DVD's.,1225238400,5,190,4.5
1528334,5,B00005JO2C,"When will Warner Bros. wake up and realize that their fan base for Maverick want the tv show from the 50's and not the newer versions. They keep releasing the show to cable stations that most of fans don't have.
Wake up WB and get this out on DVD.",1225152000,7,247,4.061224489795919

1528336,5,B00005JO2C,"I am 59 years old and have waited and waited to see the TV series Maverick released on DVD. With all the garbage that has been released why oh why can't such an outstanding series be released...will this occur before my passing Mr Warner? This series was at the forfront of television viewing and was very popular. I have no doubt that there are many fans out there just waiting to see this series become available.
Can any-one tell me why it is taking so long?",1215993600,8,461,4.372093023255814
1528337,5,B00005JO2C,"Come on, Warner Brothers, what's taking so long?

Most of the best TV shows of the fifties and the sixties have been released in complete season sets, remastered and in beautiful transfers -- but Maverick, one of the best shows of all time, remains unreleased.

Well, it's about time, all right? Warner Brothers, the world is passing you by. Most of the first season can be found by assidious searchers on the Internet -- in distorted, godawful form, from videotapes recorded by dedicated tapers years ago. But why force us to watch bootlegs when the real thing lies in studio vaults?

Maverick isn't just the legend of the West, it's probably the only show of the fifties/early-sixties western craze that remains watchable today, with a true antihero -- a guy who really doesn't want to play the hero and get his head blown off in the bargain (but who usually winds up playing the hero despite himself).

Anyway, it's about time this one came out on DVD. So how about it?

1528338,5,B00005JO2C,"I bought every available episode of ""Maverick"" as offered by Columbia House ($25 for 2 episodes) - I think about 50 total - and it was wonderful. After a while the plots seem to be recycled, but to watch James Garner take the TV western where it had never gone before was amazing to review as an adult, 50 years later. Physically, Garner did not look 29 at the start of the series nor his acting seem that of someone relatively new to acting for film/TV but he was extraordinary from the start.

I stumbled into looking for the DVDs and was amazed that they have not been released.",1205798400,59,581,4.330275229357798

1528340,5,B00005JO2C,I've only seen the 3-show teaser DVD but I throroughly enjoyed all 3 episodes and would definitely buy the first season.  The shows (I saw) were hilarious and entertaining.  They were good clean entertainment with no bad language and little violence--I actually want my four-year-old to watch these!,1200096000,10,299,5.208333333333333

Lets get this ball rolling .. As my old pappy used to say never put off for tomorrow saving an earned penny cuz it might be a rainy day ... That was the head injury talking but still my old pappy was a good guy and he would have wanted all men to have access to all Maverick all the time so head em up .. move em out.,1192665600,17,468,3.7373737373737375
