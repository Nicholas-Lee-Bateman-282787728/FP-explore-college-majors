2928077,4,B000V02CUU,"TIME (aka. Shi gan) is the 2006 offering of acclaimed Korean director Kim Ki-Duk (the Bow, The Isle, Spring Summer Fall..., 3-IRON). Kim's style of film-making usually involves limited dialogue, allowing silence to express the screenplay by way of unspoken emotional expression. Much of his films involve marginalized worlds or a way of life; he takes his audiences to that world, the main goal is to make us understand how it operates and see certain rules that may apply. In his film; ""Time"", he tackles the desire for youth and beauty, also the fears of love.

A young and attractive woman named Seh-hee (Ji Yeon Park) is worried that her boyfriend, Ji-woo (Ha Jeong-woo) is growing tired of her. She occasionally observes him looking at other beautiful women. She-hee is a jealous type and always insists that she doesn't excite him anymore during lovemaking.  She-hee even goes as far as suggesting that he imagine her as someone else while making love. Seh-hee, takes drastic measures to keep her boyfriend's love. She disappears for a time to undergo extensive plastic surgery; to change her appearance.
Six months pass, and Seh-hee re-introduces herself to her ex-boyfriend as Ji-hee (Seong Hyeon-a, Woman is the Future of Man, the Intimate) and they start a new romance. Now, Ji-hee realizes that Ji-woo hasn't gotten over his former love; Seh-hee. She learns that he is STILL very much in love with her former face. Ji-hee is faced with a terrible dilemma.

Plastic surgery has become an ""in"" thing in South Korea, so it is no wonder that movies that deal with this current wave (Time, Cinderella) will be made. Unlike many of Kim's films, ""TIME"" has a lot of dialogue, although there are moments in the film wherein silence is used for expression. There are some subtle symbolisms and potent themes in the screenplay; I think the failure of communication is strongly represented in ""Time"". The film plays like a ballad, even though the setting is a huge concrete world, the film never failed to entrance me and at times, even bewilder me. The cinematography is great as usual, places are revisited, and photos are memorized but NEVER for a moment did the proceedings felt dull and boring. The cinematography is actually mesmerizing.

I've read that Kim originally refused to play ""Time"" in Korea, only after an online petition by thousands of fans did he agree to it. The film received a bit of disdain from the Korean people, which further cements Kim's status as an ""outcast"" director. ""TIME"" is far from becoming a mainstream drama, but surprisingly, it may contain a bit of sly humor which are absent in his past films. Kim never fleshes out his characters entirely, but one thing no one can deny is that he never fails to engage his audience's brain with cerebral fascination.  Kim's style of directing is truly inspired; it retains that symmetrical genius, both in visuals and narration. ""Time"" may have a bit of a minimalist approach, the use of symbolic themes and metaphors in the sculptures, the proceedings stay grounded and still came to me as a slice of pure human drama than a fable.

The strong performance of  Hyeon-a Seong is the highlight of this film, she succeeds in expressing all the needed emotions in portraying Ji-hee's character. She is excellent in her performance. Ji-woo's character isn't fleshed out as I would have wished. The lead characters' motivation in their actions is very much left to our interpretation at times.

I have the Korean region-3 release by KD MEDIA. I think it's safe to say that the U.S. release will utilize a similar transfer.
VIDEO/AUDIO: 1.78 anamorphic widescreen. The PQ is exceptional. Bright, radiant colors with strong blacks(when needed). Clean and crisp picture quality. 5.1 Dolby Digital Korean track is sufficient for this film. The sound is clear with the excellent English subs.

Parting thoughts:
""Time"" may mark a new direction in Kim's work, only ""time"" (pun intended) will tell. This films tackles important issues even though it is not as cryptic as his previous films, but it is still entertaining and nonetheless challenging. As usual, the climax of the film is left to the audiences' interpretation. ""Time"" is truly worth a look for fans of Kim Ki-Duk's work.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! [4 stars]",1191974400,18,4276,4.944289693593315

This movie visits the darker areas of Korean culture with plastic surgery obsession and I wouldn't be surprised if something like this has already happened in real life.

2928084,5,B000V02CUU,"A good movie and recommendable.
I think the main characters were great but I could not wrap me head around See Hee's sanity she was so crazy and insecure within her self that she believed she needed to change and be someone else to be with the man she claimed to have love so much. His heart was broken when she left without a word and returns as a new person who is still crazy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If I was the owner of the cafe I would have banned them from my place of business !!!!!!!!!!!
He then decides he needs to go change his appearance to get back at her. He was a whack job too !!!!!
In the end all I got from this movie was that no matter how you change the outside its whats on the inside that has always mattered.
It was then assumed that he was the one that was hit by the car but was it truly him because he never did identify him self.
I don't recall seeing his new look, Did I miss it?

2928089,5,B000V02CUU,"A fitting end to a journey through low self esteem and the pressure society puts on women and men to be perfect. To be someone's idea of beautiful. And who defines what beauty is? Television, magazines, the fashion runway? Beauty is a form of truth and truth is not something that has multiple and contrasting meanings. It is sad to know that stories like this actually occur in real life. We lose ourselves while chasing after something called happiness which we believe resides outside ourselves. Little do we know that happiness comes with self acceptance and self love.

If the heroine had any idea of her self worth, all her problems would have been solved. She would have realized that changing her face could not bring her the things she craved the most; it was only a temporary fix. Happiness and love will never be found on the cosmetic surgeon's operating table, in some miracle diet or some bottle of alcohol or hair dye. Only when these things are first found within do they become timeless.",1368316800,,1003,4.698863636363637
2928090,2,B000V02CUU,There is a great film to be made symbolizing romantic obsessions and the lengths some may go to please a partner.  This isn't it.  It starts and ends with a women changing their faces through plastic surgery.  Everything in between is confusing and unnecessarily complex.  Part of the problem is that Koreans really do look alike with their almond shaped eyes and fair skin.  Another problem is that they all go from timid to aggressive in a split second.  I had trouble keeping track of different characters.,1361836800,2,509,4.793103448275862
2928091,1,B000V02CUU,"Not worth seeing. It made me laugh but not because it was a comedy, because it was stupid. Won't recommend it to anyone. Unfortunate that I can't give it zero stars.

For instance, niether character apparently has a job since you never see them at work yet they have plenty of money to get plastic surgery and live in nice apartments. Moreover, the surgeries are not done in sterile operating rooms using standard sterile techniques.

But let's talk about the basic story line. Crazy women gets a face change to make her boyfriend happy but then she changes her name and ID to trick him, only to find that he doesn't love the her as the new stranger and although he still loves the old her, the gets a face change himself and  makes no effort to be with her.

2928092,4,B000V02CUU,"In combining elements of sci-fi and fantasy with a thoughtful, contemplative study of human relationships, the Korean film, ""Time,"" brings the adage ""Beauty is only skin deep"" to a whole new level.

When she begins to sense that her boyfriend, Ji-woo, may be losing interest in her, Seh-hee decides to undergo plastic surgery so radical that even he will not be able to recognize her.  Her plan is to then insinuate herself back into Ji-woo's life under the guise of her new identity, hoping to stave off his growing indifference and, in so doing, give them what amounts to a second chance as a couple.  Needless, to say, Seh-hee `s scheme does not work out quite as planned and she learns some pretty powerful lessons about the way true love actually works.

Although Seh-hee clearly believes that by altering her appearance she will be able to change her inner makeup as well, the truth is that she remains every bit as grasping, jealous, melodramatic and paranoid after the surgery as she was before.  No amount of change in her looks can raise her self-esteem or make her any less difficult to deal with.  Her boyfriend, meanwhile, becomes a pawn in her twisted game, as he is tricked into inadvertently rekindling a romance with a woman who carries with her all the same baggage he had so much trouble putting up with in the previous relationship (despite the fact that he genuinely loves her).

An attack on the looks-obsessed nature of modern culture, ""Time"" is not a ""thriller"" in the conventional sense of the term.  It demands patience as it goes about the business of laying out its storyline and doesn't go in for a whole lot of fancy horror movie pyrotechnics to raise the audience's hackles.  Instead, it relies mainly on subtle psychological insights to generate a feeling of imbalance and unease.  Seh-hee is clearly mentally and emotionally unstable, and writer/director Ki-duk Kim's subtle, almost Pirandellian way of dealing with that madness makes it all the more disturbing.

Strong performances, steady direction, sharp cinematography and an unnerving view of human nature all combine to make ""Time"" an offbeat, memorable experience.  Don't expect to jump out of your seat or bury your face in your hands during the course of this film - for in the case of ""Time,"" the chills all take place in the mind.",1233878400,5,2325,4.843434343434343
2928093,5,B000V02CUU,"This is a brilliant treatment of human insecurity and relationships, of loneliness and superficiality.

What do you get when you mix deep love, insecurity, Korean culture, modern medical advances and a superficial society?  If you're a master director like Kim Ki-Duk, you get a a movie like ""Time.""  While this certainly isn't his best work, it is strong nonetheless and will capture your attention with it's confusing and revealing twists and turns.

The Story and the Script

It's not uncommon to experience some distancing when a couple has been together for a few years.  When Seh-hee (Ji Yeon Park) lets her insecurity get the best of her, she begins to worry that her boyfriend Ji-Woo (Ha Jeong-Woo) has tired of her.  She goes to some extra-ordinary lengths to address that issue, and therein lies the first twist in our story.

Seh-hee's jealousy is also part and parcel to her insecurity.  Needless to say, the story gets more intriguing as  we examine Ji-Woo's confusion and attempts to cope with at first the uncertainty and eventually the strangeness of Seh-hee's actions.  The plot is thick and rich with purposeful surprises that reveal more and more layers of these characters.

The culture of superficiality which has taken hold in South Korea as in most of the world takes center stage during this movie.  The dialogue in the film often seems rough, perhaps mainly for reasons of cultural differences.  Still, the writing is interesting and will keep you guessing.

Some elements of the film made me wary, such as Korean men that have no issue with smacking their dates and a desperate hornyness that seems all too common among the male characters.  Still, all these elements are well integrated in the story, and certainly there's nothing really gratuitous here.

Cinematography

Imagery is also used to great effect, and the cinematography is top notch.  Locations and sets become characters that add depth and interest to the story as it unfolds.  Ji-Woo is a photography buff and we get to enjoy his pastime through him.  And the shots of sculpture park become a dream-like symbol for the characters' descent.

Acting and Direction

The movie is stocked full of very strong actors and beautiful scenes of Korea.  Of course the visually beautiful backdrop is in contrast to our protagonists, who seem ill at ease with themselves.

The two lead actors each deliver very impressive performances that help smooth over a script that appears to have been written with the intent of sometimes making viewers uncomfortable.

Features and Extras

There are some disappointing aspects to this film.  The DVD includes only a fluffy making-of featurette that is just inadequate.  Additionally, the subtitles are poorly done in a white that often blends in with on-screen images making it almost illegible.  It would have been nice to have the translations placed below the widescreen frame.  I do not speak Korean.  :)

Conclusion

Despite these minor things, I think this movie is well worth your time.

Overall, worth watching.  If you are a huge fan of philosophical drama, it's worth owning as well.

2928095,5,B000V02CUU,"Once again, Kim Ki Duk has produced another excellent movie showing the more sensitive nature of his korean culture, up close and personal. The photography is top quality and the images of surgery donot linger too long for affect but give just the right atmosphere of desperation to the story. Kim's treatment of love is unique in that he shows love is with us all the time but it can take many hardships to see it. Kim also shows that, like Deity, love has no limits known by man except for the limits man places on it which can never last. A great movie. Buy it!",1197417600,9,564,4.330188679245283
2928096,5,B000V02CUU,"Time is a superb film, directed by the most prominent Korean filmmaker ever born until this date. As matter of fact Kim Ki Duk not only has become in one the referential icons of this craft, besides he has risen himself as one the finest directors of the world, blending admirably text and image, making of this last item part of the speech, transcending the anecdote by itself.

We have a couple in crisis. She is not profoundly in love with him, but besides she is possessed by a sort of fetishistic attraction. She makes the best she can to give him the absolute satisfaction, but her inner insecurity is so strong that she begins to bore about the fact of being always the same woman.

So, when she decides to leave him without previous announcement, in order to surprise him thanks to the imminent physical transformation, through a plastic surgeon during the next six months, she will cause a multidimensional and unexpected at different levels.
The rest of the plot must be hidden by obvious reasons. But the only fact remark is the powerful and mature approach around the events to come.

A well rounded script, a superb cast, a splendid photograph and a profound reflection about the final consequences that this decision may carry with itself.

In the recent past, two films come to my mind: Seconds (the admirable cult movie and many times forgotten of john Frankenheimer of 1968) and Ash Wednesday (a swampy and boring melodrama, that may be regarded possibly as the worst film of Elizabeth Taylor), but in honor of the truth, no other film had arrived so long and explored so deep the last consequences with such meridian crudeness.

A major film that must be seen, no matter your level of interest for the cinema. This is an authentic masterwork.",1196726400,2,1760,4.719869706840391

8216054,3,B000V02CUU,"Smart enough film whose title is somewhat misleading.  Yes, time encapsulates the film, however, it is memory that gives time meaning.  Physical memory, emotional memory, false memory, photographical memory, memory of the senses; these are the thematic elements resonating at the core of this film. Laughable is the Cinderella motif where the main character attempts to find the right fit, the right touch, the correct memory that sustains the timelessness of love. Not all quaint, this movie does present images of butchery--both benign and malignant. If repetition weren't a necessary ingredient for the film's theme then it would be one of its short comings.

A Chinese-American dermatologist friend in Hawaii told me that Koreans go ""gaga"" over plastic surgery and skin (mainly face) treatment and that clientele is the main source of her practice's revenue stream. Wow -- I never knew that the business segment was that huge.

The director, Kim Ki Duk, is an absolute GENIUS as he weaves beautiful cinematography into a compelling storyline. My eyes were glued to the screen every single minute of this film.

The female lead, Seh-hee (Ji Yeon Park), played her character very convincingly and made her obsession very real for the viewer. She is not ugly by any stretch but wants something ""different""...

The male lead, Ji-woo (Ha Jeong-woo), was also very well played and he made sure you knew what he was trying to do to show Seh-hee (she is kinda nuts...,) his love.
