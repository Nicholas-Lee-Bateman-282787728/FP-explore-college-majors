6096822,5,B00GOT15N2,This film is amazing!!  You experience every emotion in that hour and a half.  It inspires you to look beyond yourself and love others despite the difficulty you might face.  It also shows the power of love and prayer on a human body.  The love that comes from Rocky isn't his own and it's so evident.,1385424000,17,301,4.321428571428571

6096825,5,B00GOT15N2,"Blood Brother is very moving.  If nothing else, it makes you question your place in the world and how you interact with others. Are you willing to make the sacrifices that Rocky makes and put yourself in the vulnerable position he is in?  If not, why?  How much does your fellow human mean to you?  If you care for a touching movie, after which you will be posed into deep reflection, then Blood Brother is for you.",1476921600,,415,4.35064935064935

6096834,5,B00GOT15N2,"A moving account of a young man's journey to find himself. Rocky seems made to work with these HIV positive, rejected children.

The movie is well edited, filmed and directed. This is not a film for the weak of heart...you see one child go through the ravages of an AIDS related illness. Rocky stays by his side, caring for him in a hands on kind of way.

I highly recommend this video!",1458000000,,386,4.347222222222222

6096839,5,B00GOT15N2,"This is one of the most extraordinary, loving, heartbreaking tear-jerking documentary that I have ever seen.

It touches the heart and it sends the mind into an emotional torment and yet also in a beautiful way. To witness this young man, give up his life in America to take care of these, beautiful children with HIV/AIDS is what true love is about.

These children are abandoned, slowly dying, suffering and yet they so beautiful with smiles and love. They love Rocky with all their heart and he loves these children with all his heart. He is a true savior. He's a hero, a beautiful man to be able to do what he does.

I highly recommend this documentary for any person that wants to see something truly touching. Truly extraordinary. Truly peaceful and yet so sad but also beautiful at the same time.

This group of children need love, and compassion. These children who are sick need touching hands, love, and human companionship.

This documentary showcases Rocky giving his life to these children. You witness his everyday life, you witness his darkest moments, emotional moments. You witness him taking care of these children that are falling apart and slowly wasting away.

This was filmed by Rocky's friend Stephen who decided to come over and witness what his best friend does and it forever changed his life. This documentary forever changed my life. Viewing this film was a beautiful experience. An experience that touched my heart. I cried bitterly through this film.

This is a humbling documentary; it brings you down to earth. It makes you think and makes you question your petty wanted needs. These children suffer, seeking the medicine they need, the care they deserve. These children have been abandoned and we worry about what fashion is in and what Justin Bieber does.

It's truly, truly saddening this still happens today in this world. The suffering of innocent children, forgotten children. These children never asked for this and yet this documentary showcases the brutality of this disease. The brutality of society toward these people, truly shocking, truly mind-numbing, truly eye-opening, and heart touching.

This holds nothing back in the graphic detail from the lesions, skin splitting open, the blood and mucus and the pain is unbearable for the viewer to watch. I think that's a problem with a lot of films that detail AIDS and other diseases. They sugarcoat it Hollywood style. It gets big movie stars, but when a real documentary comes out and showcases the brutality of this horrible murdering disease, it makes you think.

This film truly brings you down to earth and it makes you contemplate. It makes you think. It makes you see that AIDS is a suffering disease and it does not discriminate, it kills horribly.

There are moments in this documentary that I closed my eyes. Just seeing the child laying in the hospital bed suffering with his blood coated lips and sealed eyes and the horrible lesions all over his body and yet Rocky, this wonderful, peaceful man, that struggles like all of us, but he cares. He's is not a saint. He has his bad days, but he's there. Rocky is there making a difference. He has his two hands and his arms hugging HIV or AIDS infested children; that he knows will die more or less. He's there hugging them, kissing them, feeding them, playing with them. He is a living saint, if you want to call him that.

Rocky's hands, heart and soul function as modern Mother Teresa.

There are moments when he's taking care of the children's cuts and scrapes and bleeding boo-boos and yes he does not flinch, he takes them in his hands, he caresses them, he feels their need for companionship, their need for loving touch. They are not monsters. They are not the creatures under the bed. They have a horrible murdering disease, but the time that they are here on this Earth, they should be treated like human beings that they are.

In 2011, 2.8 million people had aids in India. I don't care what your lifestyle is, or what you do, no one deserves to die of this horrible disease. It shouldn't even be thought of, with these innocent children. They are the ones that are punished and destroyed. They should never have to deal with this unbearable disease. They should never be denied, the love, companionship and caring hands, while going through this horror.

What I like about this documentary is it touches on the human side of Rocky. The average everyday life of Rocky coming back to America to visit his friend. His personal family struggles. His daily walks. His humble little home. His marriage to a beautiful India lady. You see him suffering through illness. You see him sleeping. You see him angry. You see him cry. He is human, he's no different than you and I, but what makes him blessed, what makes him different, he is willing to caress, comfort and be there for the suffering children.

He could've easily boosted himself up and say ""oh look what I am doing,"" or he could've showed off through pride. He could've wanted accolades, but no. Rocky is a humble man, a humble person with humbled needs.

In my book this makes him a true, true hero. The word hero is flawed this day and age. We say my hero is a football star. We say my hero is a music star. That's not a hero. A Hero is soldier on the front lines defending their nation. A hero is a person that steps in front of bullet for another person. A hero is donating food or clothes to the needy. A hero is a caring doctor or nurse, firefighter, or police persons. A hero is Rocky, who loves these children like they are his own.

Steve Hoover, Rocky's friend, set out to experience and see why his friend gave up everything in America. What he experiences is a life altering reality. He directed and created this stunningly beautiful heart wrenching portrait of Rocky, and the reality that is happening as you read this review.

It's a loving portrait of a film. A piece of fantastical art woven around the sadness and the atrocities of an unbearable disease, yet, as long as there are hands like Rocky and tears like Rocky's, there will be peace, love, caring and most of all companionship for these beautiful, amazing, lovable, children.

I wanted to hug, kiss, show love to these passionate and beautiful children.

This is a must see, must own, must be talked about, must be spread to others. This is a flawless documentary. It is a masterpiece of heart wrenching and ultimately a truthful reality of life.",1449532800,,6438,4.689716312056738

6096845,5,B00GOT15N2,"One of the most profound and thought provoking films I've seen in a long time. This is not just a film that is focused on the sad circumstances of a group of children but one that is about how these children live their lives and the light they have to find everyday despite their circumstances. I don't think it was their intention, but the film also is a critique of ""vacation charity"" where well-meaning foreigners visit orphanages for a day, give money, and then never come back again. These types of visits likely do more emotional harm than good since orphan children's hearts get broken as they make new connections with foreigners and those connections are severed abruptly. Beautiful film that everyone should watch",1443312000,,723,4.838709677419355

6096882,4,B00GOT15N2,"Kids get HIV not because they're gay, have unprotected sex or use IV drugs. Kids are born every day with HIV and Rocky was so what unaware of this causal relationship. He visited India and fell in love, and didn't want to leave. He fell in love with kids who had been essentially abandoned and stigmatized because they had HIV. The home helps women and children who are HIV positive. This documentary tells of Rocky and his love for the children, how he was first apprehensive and then grew to love every child, and weep for every loss. The agonizing tale of a near death is the climax of the film, which had me at tears.
Ricky's love for India grows, he tries to immerse himself as much as he can, even as far as forgoing indoor plumbing In his home.
The film ends with Rocky marrying in India and none of his biological family is there, but he has a new family in India, no less worthy to be there for him.
A very moving tale of self discovery and accepting stigmas around HIV.  A must see for caring hearts and open minds.",1400371200,,1025,4.283505154639175

6096885,5,B00GOT15N2,Wow! This is an amazing story! I was very moved & inspired by the young man's sacrifice. He makes it seem like it isn't really a sacrifice to serve in this way because his whole heart is in what he is doing. His heart for the people he serves is incredible.

6096888,5,B00GOT15N2,When I saw Blood Brother on Independent Lens I knew if I ever had the opportunity I would buy it.  Rocky Braat's story is very inspiring and when you see the bond of love between him and the children at the orphanage you can understand why he would sell everything he had to move to India and commit his life to them.  The documentary is much like real life - with both joyful happy and even miraculous occasions as well as tragic and gut wrenching moments.  The extra footage included on the DVD is a welcome addition - you want to see more footage of this life.  I have recommended this to friends and can't imagine anyone not being affected after watching.,1398297600,,659,4.377049180327869

6096895,5,B00GOT15N2,"This is slightly strange. I have made 5 trips to India, 3 have been to Chennai, though a good deal older (58) and had a lot of media coverage for various things I won't bore you with however, I found this amazingly honest, poignant,and fearless in a way that is truly humbling. I have often felt that there are vast reservoirs in younger people, that will change the world for the better and Rocky proves that. And his bringing Surya back from the point of death is one of the most disarming proofs of loves power that I think I have ever witnessed. At first I thought he was oddly cocky ,and then , I realized he just doesn't take himself that seriously in a kind of way that was a real lesson for me. I think this should be required watching for people everywhere. There are not enough good things about it. Ironically I was supposed to be in India now with my children in a certain area which shall remain private, however there is something so real ,and 3 dimensional about this story I am just overwhelmed.",1396396800,,1011,4.354497354497354

6096897,1,B00GOT15N2,"On the one hand it is very provocative and challenging, deep and significant. On the other hand I wonder if Mother Teresa has returned as a man to help orphans in India? I also wonder if Mother Teresa would have had a film crew come to her Order of Nuns in Calcutta to film the great suffering of children, and her role in their lives? I wonder if she would have then started selling the recorded film on a CD to raise money for her cause?

It seems more like martyrdom to me the documentary depicts. Of course again it is a matter of perception. If you want to go help people, do not draw attention to yourself so you can ""raise awareness"" in mankind. If this is a being's calling, so be it. Is it also a being's calling to produce a film to share with others who then tell you how wonderful your work is?

I can watch it over and over again and still so moved and emotional from the scenes where Rocky relentlessly love and care for these precious kids. It is obvious that the love of Christ flows effortlessly from Rocky and prompting him to open his eyes, radically leave everything behind to move to India and love these kids. Some parts of the movie will wreck you, the poverty and sufferings revealed in the movie are real. But love, love wins all. Rocky came to the orphanage to love, and he didn't give up even though things are so hard. Blood Brother is a good reminder that sometimes our mundane and problems are not really that bad, it's a good picture of what love can do. It can change the world.

When it came available online I purchased it to ""watch it now"" and honestly I took away even more watching it the 2nd time because the first time I don't think my mind could truly grasp everything I was seeing because there were so many layers and levels of emotion to the story. It was equally as moving the 2nd time and I caught a few things I missed the 1st time. I'm anxious to share it with as many as I can. Wonderfully filmed and beautifully told~ Fantastic!!! I wish those who have negative comments could see this film through the eyes of a friend who is telling a story about a friend and his journey in his life which happens to bring about an awareness to us of what goes on beyond our own little world and the impact it can have when we step out of our comfort zone and allow ourselves to give when we didn't realize we had anything worth giving. If we show compassion, caring and love towards another human being even if it's in hopes to full fill a void or need within ourselves...it's still a win-win situation.

In these days of easy comfort and banal advice, I was refreshed by a message grounded in truth. That sounds pretty heavy, yet there is no getting around it. If you live you will suffer. You can avoid the suffering by consuming goods, services and or substances to get distracted. Additionally, you can try to keep your suffering to a minimum by keeping an emotional distance from the pain of others.

The movie was a healing experience as it both clarified and confirmed my own view that we are here to help, to serve and to love. That's it. The choice to love is the choice to care, and by definition that will includes suffering.  In the end though, love is not diminished by suffering. It is burnished and strengthened.

What I find so beautiful about this story is that Rocky (main character) doesn't have a huge fantastical vision of what he wants to do or the kind of change he ends up making in this world. But because he follows his heart and acts on what he knows is good and true and the right thing to do, he alters the course of many lives.....quite literally.

In that same environment, many people would probably (and probably have) shaken their heads & walked away for good. This is simply one man that chose not to. Think if more of us did the same.

After recently seeing such emotional films as 12Years a Slave, Dallas Buyers Club and Philomena, I felt that I had no emotion left to be exposed but this heartfelt documentary knocked me out.  This is about as honest as a film can get.  Rocky is just an average guy who is immature and at times even reckless.  Yet when called, he rises to a task of caring for a group of children many would rather avoid.  There is a spiritual dimension to this story that I found very humbling.  I salute Rocky for his efforts and dedication.  And not to be forgotten, his friend Steve who feels drawn to tell this story of service to the needy must be applauded.
