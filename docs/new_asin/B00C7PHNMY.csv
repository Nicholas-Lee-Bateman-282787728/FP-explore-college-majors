8578358,5,B00C7PHNMY,"Hopefully it doesn't sound too corny when I say that the Dream Share Project is a film about following your dreams. I oftentimes find myself inclined to dismiss ""inspirational"" movies as maudlin or overdone. However, Dream Share Project, the filmmaking debut of recent college graduates Chip Hiden and Alexis Irvin, is very much an inspirational movie and it totally avoids these pitfalls.

Clocking in at just over an hour, this fast-paced road movie takes us across the country, introducing us to a diverse cast of characters including an Olympic skier and a slam poet. The Dream Share Project provides us with a broad and widely encompassing definition of ""success"" - rather than having goal making seem like an imposition, this film makes it feel liberating.",1374796800,,762,5.096
8578359,5,B00C7PHNMY,"Absolutely delightful documentary. These two lovebirds are goin' places, I tell ya. The Dream Share Project is inspiring, funny and genuine. This is a must see for anyone who ever thought to themselves, ""I've made a huge mistake"" and wants to make a change for a happier and more rewarding life",1369785600,,294,4.784313725490196
8578360,5,B00C7PHNMY,"The least cheesiest somewhat ""self help"" film. Highly recommend this film to recent graduates, or anyone in need of some inspiration. What is really great is that the filmmakers explored how all different kinds of people went about achieving their goals, not one specific kind of person in one specific field. Other topics: dealing with setbacks, discovering your passion, taking risks. Do what you love is really the end all be all. What's a better message than that?",1369353600,2,468,5.012820512820513
8578361,5,B00C7PHNMY,"This doc is funny, heart warming and incredibly inspirational. The creators of film were showing it at a local college when I first saw it. Immediately afterwards I quit my desk job working for my step dad, and applied to intern at labs on the campus. Now I'm about to finish up with my fast track certificate, my start-up just turned a profit, and I moved out of my parents house into my new home that I purchased myself. I dreamt big and worked hard because of this doc. You can change your life if you put your mind to it, even at 45 years young.",1369353600,2,549,4.188679245283019
8578362,5,B00C7PHNMY,"I am always skeptical of inspirational films, but this film brings following your dreams down to reality. It's funny, moving, and most of all effective. Following two young adults, who quit their day jobs to travel cross-country to figure out their dreams would make for a great documentary on its own. Add in interviews with folks already living their dreams including writers, entrepreneurs, actors, comedians, and activists and you have a very compelling road map to living out your own dreams. This is a very low budget film, which the first time filmmakers give playful, self-aware nods to, but the content easily makes up for any minor shortcomings.

Also, there are bears. Bears!",1367193600,2,686,5.070796460176991
8578363,5,B00C7PHNMY,"what a terrific film, Chip and Alexis inspired me to start writing a book after putting it off for only 30 years. A must see for everyone who ever had a dream  thanks, K",1365724800,2,169,3.9705882352941178
