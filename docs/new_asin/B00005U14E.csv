7953968,3,B00005U14E,"Gonin 2. Definately not a sequel to the first one(there really couldn't be anyway), not nearly as good, but not a total dissapointment.
This one's more of a traditional movie. An old man(Ken Ogata from Mishima and the Pillow Book) looks for revenge after Yakuza hoods raped and killed his wife. A group of makeshift, female Jewelry Store robbers [anger] the Yakuza after fumbling their heist and get the old man's attention after they steal the ring he wanted to purchase for his dead wife. Then, worlds colide as they all run into each other blasting and chopping away.
The character developement is poor and the Yakuza are as stereotypical as they get. There is some good dialogue betweeen the female robbers, charming stuff at times, but it's minimal.
There's some cool stuff. The old man makes his own sword in order to get his revenge. So, sword in hand, he goes around chopping up yakuza looking like the bad guy from I Know What You Did Last Summer. Pretty cool considering it's Ken Ogata.
Then there's some bizare stuff involving te dead wife...I won't spoil it for you, but if you don't want to see a movie a step down and more B-movieish than the first Gonin, this one may not be for you. It's more action than anything and it's a hell of a lot simpler and more generic. Something you wouldn't be surprised to see on Cinemax at 2 in the morning, but Japanese and starring the guy from Mishima. Only in the mighty Nippon!",1018742400,6,1430,4.546511627906977
