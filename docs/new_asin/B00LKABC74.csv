8666285,4,B00LKABC74,"I definitely loved to finally own the entire first 16 seasons of Power Rangers, and being able to watch them from the first episode ""Day of the Dumpster"" in Series 1 to when the entire original Power Rangers saga ended for the last episode of Power Rangers: In Space. However, I wish the Power Rangers series would have continued though.",1502496000,,337,4.633333333333334
8666286,3,B00LKABC74,It is okay for you to get them all in one shipping but I to would suggest just ordering them one by one in the same order rather than ordering them as a bundle because it is cheaper. Each one has a retail price of 80-85.00 which would be around 320-340 all together. Plus tax it would be around 380-390.00. It is better same quality just at a cheaper price.,1480550400,,357,4.114285714285714
8666287,1,B00LKABC74,More expensive than buying each series seperately. If you want this complete collection just buy each other the 4 sets ranging from 80-100 dollars each with free shipping.,1469318400,14,171,5.142857142857143
