Unlike her mother wendy and her little brother she is a realist and doesn't beileve in fairy tales and most of all peter pan. Until that is one day as she is relaxing on her window bed she is snatched it's captain hook "" hello wendy"" as jane is trying to explain "" but i'm not wendy i'm her daughter jane"" but it's too late and now peter pan is coming to the rescue.

1436490,3,B00005JKX3,"There have been numerous Peter Pan movies, several of which take place AFTER the original story (""Hook"" being the best rendition so far). However, Disney, with it's Direct to video roll, for some odd reason, decided to put this one on the big screen!
As an animator myself i can honestly say that this is far below disney's usual standard. The animaton is stiff and akward. The voices of the characters are not even remotely close to the original (especially the lost boys) and Peter Pan himself comes across as nothing more than a brat without his charm that has made him such a beloved icon.
Disney is also 'getting with the times' and instead of confrunting and trying to debunk the horrible stereotyped ""injuns,"" the indian camp looks more like they were wiped out and aren't even mentioned in the movie, just to be safe.
As for the story, it had a lot going for it. The material was all there, it's just a shame the writers just took whatever came by first. Jane is non-empathetic, and her transition from wanting to grow up to being a kid is very downplayed.
This film is much more lighter than the original Peter Pan which was rather dark in places. The worse that happens in this is Peter Pan is thrown 5 feet to the deck of a ship. ow.
I must give them credit though for the ending. Peter and Wendy's reuniting was something i thought they wouldn't even bother with because it was too dissapointing, but they were somehow able to put a light spin on it. good job disney! at least you're not completely out of ideas yet!
Granted kids will enjoy it for there is enough potty humor to keep them entertained, but parents might suffer seeing their beloved childhood memories dashed into bits.",1024272000,22,1696,4.527687296416938

1436613,5,B00005JKX3,"When I consolidated my DVD/Blu Ray collection (to make it actually fit in my house), I put this film, Ariel's Beginning, and the Lion King Trilogy in one box. The reason why is simple: The Lion King Trilogy works beautifully together to tell an African/Shakespearean epic, and Ariel's Beginning and Return to Never Land give life and substance to the worlds of Disney that somehow just don't hold up all that well in their original form after all these years. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

A long time ago, a very good friend of mine told me that he saw this animated film and really liked it. I shouldn't have been surprised, as he told me at the time his favorite film was Mary Poppins, but at the time I dismissed it. The trailer for this film quite frankly looked ridiculous. It wasn't until a long time later when I was in a BlockBuster Video and saw Ariel's Beginning playing on a TV, that I realized I had completely neglected the direct-to-video films Disney had been putting out, and the animation quality of THAT feature led me to believe I definitely needed to get all the sequels a shot. The result? I've seen Cinderella 2 and 3. I've seen Tarzan 2. I've even tried to watch the Aladdin sequels, and suffered through Pochontas' trip to Europe. Out of all that, the Lion King Trilogy, Ariel's Beginning, and this film FLEW to the top.

Prior to writing this review I watched this film again to refresh my memory and some major areas stand out.

Gorgeous Animation

This film was made just before Disney gave up traditional animation, and it shows. For a lower-budget feature, it has FANTASTIC art direction, beautiful backgrounds, decent CGI, and fluid, colorful, gorgeous character animation. The thing that really stands out is just how much traditional animation can be improved using modern computer-driven assitance. There is light and shadow and coloration that gives everything a 3D effect, and this sort of thing simply wasn't possible when the original was made. For someone like me who loves traditional animation, this is outstanding, at a level with Fantasia 2000 (one of my other favorite modern Disney features that combines traditional cell animation with computer-assisted graphics).

Music

Some of the music sounds a bit too Disney-Radio for my tastes, but the score of the film is magnificent, reminiscent of some John Williams' and Alan Silvestri best work (no, I'm not kidding). I've ordered a copy of the soundtrack to take a listen on it's own without the film to see how it holds up. In the meantime, just know that while a great many animated film scores are fine while watching the film, not many feel a dynamic and sweeping film score, and while watching this film, yes, this one does. I even watched through the end credits so I could hear some more of it. Very surprising.

Story and Characterization

My biggest problem with many of Disney's biggest hits is that there simply isn't any character development. Characters like Peter Pan, Aladdin, Ariel, etc don't really have a history or personality, so much as a stereotype or caricature of a personality. What Ariel's Beginning did for Atlantica, this film does for Never Land. Peter Pan acts suitably cartoonish and silly, but also has meaningful interaction with Jane. He's less one dimensional, and seems more aware of the thoughts and feelings of those around him. The cynicism of Jane who grows up during World War II is a wonderful contrast to the idealism of the era Wendy grew up in, and allow us to explore the deeper life issue of growing up and responsibility vs faith, belief, and optimism. Great stuff. The conflict with Captain Hook is suitably over-the-top and ridiculous, and made even more silly and goofy than in the first film, but he still serves as an excellent foil to Peter Pan. Add in the Lost Boys being able to fly, and a GIRL saving the day for a change, and you have a recipe for a great family film (provided you don't mind the juvenile gross-out humor of spit-handshakes and the like).

Vocal Talent

The voices used here are obviously different from the first Peter Pan film, and the difference could be jarring if you are expecting the exact same characters and voices. That said, the voice acting is uniformly excellent. Jane is always sincere, Peter is again more of a real person and the voice actor plenty of credit there. The lost boys are much more fully fleshed out this go-around and seem more like individual children than place-holders. But of course Captain Hook is the one who steals the show. The voice actor is absolutely fantastic in his role and own it.

I watched this film right after seeing the live action film Peter Pan (which I feel is most faithful to the book/play). That film is fantastic, and definitely worth owning and re-watching. I do not own the original animated film Peter Pan, because it's just too one-dimensional for me. But I own this film. Because it's really, really good.",1450137600,5,4939,4.751458576429405

1436615,5,B00005JKX3,"I am not usually a fan of Disney sequels. However, The Lion King, The Little Mermaid, and Peter Pan have sequels worth watching. This movie captures the magic of Peter Pan all over again, and takes me back to my youth. There's a surprisingly emotional and fantastic scene in the end, where Peter and Wendy meet again, this time with her as a grown woman. It's magical and brings tears to my eyes every time. If you at all loved the original Peter Pan, this is definitely worth watching!",1446681600,,486,4.47191011235955

Spoiler Alert! You won't see much of the original Peter Pan characters. And I thought it starting in WWll  Era was a little sad for a kids movie. But I guess Disney always has a bit of sad note.",1431648000,,424,4.096385542168675
1436670,5,B00005JKX3,"This cartoon tried to make the time period accurate and made the opening of the movie take place during the war. The original movie, Peter Pan used this time to introduce the characters and this did the same thing. I didn't like the first part but the rest of the movie I did like.

Not my first choice. I really wanted to get the original Peter Pan cartoon movie but Disney makes it unavailable for long periods at a time. This one had to do. My kids are still happy to watch it and enjoyed it. I did too, once it got out of the reality of the war. But what is the story of Peter Pan, but an escape from reality?

Overall it was a good movie.",1431648000,,643,4.015625
1436671,2,B00005JKX3,"I watched it and found it quite scary as it starts out with the war, kind of like that done in Chronicles of Narnia and then has Captain Hook go to Wendy's house, Dad had just gone to war (think how to say). Hook kidnaps Wendy's daughter who he thinks is Wendy.  The Kidnapping is the real scary part I believe for children.  It was even hard for me to watch.  In fact, I watched it (copy I got elsewhere due to it coming scratched), had enough and pitched it in the trash as I am very sensitive to certain violence.  The actual movie (not scratched/skipping) was well animated in how the characters and background were drawn/portrayed.  They used a different sea animal this time in place of the crocodile and there were no indians, no Tiger Lilly in the film.",1428019200,,761,4.368794326241135

1436721,5,B00005JKX3,"The kid loves it every bit as much as the original, so that warrants 5-stars. Surprisingly good for a straight-to-video Disney flick, with a main character (Jane) who has a lot more depth than the kids in the original. My only warning is the WW2 stuff at the beginning may be slightly scary for a young child.

Edit: Turns out this was actually in theaters once. I had no idea.",1421798400,,377,4.385714285714286
1436722,1,B00005JKX3,"I'm writing this because I want to warn people about this movie - despite the 5-star reviews. Except for the ending, its BEYOND AWFUL.

I'll admit that I only saw it once, years ago, but that was enough. I remember almost every important detail in this movie, and believe me - what I remember is NOT good. The octopus that chases captain hook throughout the movie (which is seemingly a replacement for the crocodile) is so freaky that it gave me nightmares for MONTHS! And I usually LOVE seeing octopi in movies (and in real life too)!

However, ONE horrible scene in particular has haunted me for the entire ten years or so since I saw this movie. I'm not going to say what happens, but I will say this:

Somebody really important almost dies because of Jane's actions.

Because of that ONE scene, I was sobbing as I left the theater, despite the happy ending. I will probably NEVER forget this movie - even though I've tried to for years.",1421625600,,940,4.47953216374269

1436728,2,B00005JKX3,"Basically, this is just a bad remake of the famous story, offering nothing new while wrecking the charm inherent in the original.  This time it's Wendy's sourpuss daughter Jane who gets to visit Never Land, pouting and complaining all the way.  She doesn't believe in fairies yet is easily duped by Hook.  Apparently, she has selective difficulty dealing with `reality' (flying pirates are one thing, fairies quite another?).  This nasty little brat wrings all the joy out of the story, leveling it with her uncompromising bitterness, which she abruptly loses while no one is watching.  This is a dreary addition to the collection of Never Land movies.  Set during the war, which it deals with in an offhand fashion, the story drudges its way from London to Never Land.  Hook is as wily as ever, with his faithful nitwit sidekick Mr. Smee, but the famous crocodile is missing, no reason given for its disappearance.  It's replaced by an octopus (that makes for a poor substitute).  I all but hated this film at times.  It might have been passable had they not included Jane.  At least they kept Tinker Bell as the psychotic fairy she was in the original, but she has an abrupt change of heart towards the end, which entirely ruins the dynamic.
This is insufferable twaddle.",1417219200,,1273,4.793577981651376

1437102,5,B00005JKX3,"This is an adorable movie about Wendy's daughter being kidnapped and taken to Never Land.  The story starts out during the war time where Jane is basically an adult rather the the child she actually is.  She doesn't believe in the fairy tales her mother, Wendy, tells Jane's brother nor does she believe in anything that is impractical.  That is until she of course meets Hook and Peter Pan!  The story is a great tale to remind kids to be kids and to be imaginative.  My kids and I enjoyed this movie and watched it a few times already.  I also should add that I was worries about the animation since this is a sequel to a Disney movie and sometimes the animation is not so good but this one is perfectly animated or should I say remastered since this is not a new title just a new special edition copy!",1378080000,,804,4.291390728476821

I had concerns about the scenes where it shows Londan being in war, the father going away, the city being bombed, and the children going to be taken away from the mother.  These were all upseting to my daughter and I thought there could have been a different story line then that to a children's video.",1377734400,,452,4.357142857142857

1437106,4,B00005JKX3,"We are a big Disney family and as such we love to watch Disney movies and add new ones to our collection, so we were excited to add this one to our collection as well. This movie has a great storyline and kept up the action of the original with a different storyline and undertone. I never know whether I will like some of the sequels that have come out for the Disney movies, as some have been ok, while others have struggled. I have to say that my family and I enjoyed this one and felt that it added some depth to the main character that you already know and love while adding some new characters to the mix as well.

The movie still talks about some of the main topics that have been discussed in the original, particularly, growing up and the battle between youth and adulthood. The movie is fast paced and a lot of fun to watch and enjoy with your family.

One of the best parts for me has to be the ending (though there were other good parts too), but the ending was well done and very personal and touching. If you haven't seen this yet, do, and you too will see what I mean!

He was very disappointed when I told him I could not put it on his ipad to watch when we are out because the digital copy is only to stream the movie on Amazon or Vudu.

1437354,3,B00005JKX3,"Return to Never Land is one hour and twelve minutes and was released in theaters on February 15, 2002. Return to Never Land was supposed to be a direct to video release. Gone in this movie is the crocodile and in this time is a giant octopus. It is hard to tell what time line the movie is set in; the military planes and jeeps looks to be World War II era, but the military and civilian clothing looks World War I. Wendy is now grown up and is married and has a daughter named Jane and a son named Danny. Jane is eleven and Danny is four years old. Jane no longer believes in the stories of Peter Pan as told by her mother. Jane has become sort of a tomboy and somewhat mature since her dad went off to war. During one evening Jane is kidnapped by Captain Hook and his band of pirates and taken to Never Land; Captain Hook thinks he has captured Wendy. Jane is rescues by Peter Pan and is taken to where he and the Lost Boys live. Peter Pan assumes that she is Wendy's daughter that she too would like to become a mother to the Lost Boys. The only thing Jane want to do is to go back to London, but the only way to leave Never Land is to learn how to fly. Jane tells off Peter Pan, the Lost Boys and tells Tinker Bell that fairies are not real. When Tinker Bell hears this, she begins to loose her powers. She leaves the home of Peter Pan and tries to get back to London on her but fails. She eventually meets up with Captain Hook and he strikes up a deal with her. Jane must locate Captain Hook's stolen treasure and in return he will take her back to London. Jane agrees to this and Hook gives her a whistle to blow when she finds the treasure. Jane goes looking for Peter Pan and the Lost Boys while Peter Pan and the Lost Boys goes looking for Jane so they can get her to believe in fairies and make Tinker Bell well again. They all run into each other and Jane suggest they play a game called treasure hunt. Jane does find the treasure but throws the whistle away. Peter Pan and the Lost Boys make Jane the first Lost Girl and while doing so Tootles find the whistle and blows it; not knowing he just alerted Captain Hook and his band of pirates. Captain Hook and his band of pirates take Peter Pan and the Lost Boys back to his ship to die. Jane hurries back to Tinker Bell, but it is too late. This is where the movie goes down hill. While Jane is sobbing away because she believes she arrived too late, Tinker Bell regains her powers and comes back to life. If you notice in the movie, Jane never did say at Tinker Bell's death bed that she believed in furies. In the end Jane rescues Peter Pan and the Lost Boys, Captain Hook and his crew are defeated and are seen fleeing for their lives from the giant octopus, Jane returns home to London, and Peter Pan is reunited with Wendy.

The movie was good until it got to the death bed scene and the writers just could not come up with a better ending. This does not live up to its original Peter Pan movie and in my opinion this is why Disney should not do sequels. With the exception of the Rescuers Down Under, no other Disney sequel has ever lived up to the original. Return to Never Land gets a C-.

1437358,3,B00005JKX3,"While things haven't changed in Neverland, it's been years in our world.  Wendy has grown up and has a daughter of her own.  Jane (Harriet Owen) doesn't share her mother's fantasy world, however.  As a young girl in London during World War II, she is all practicality and no fun.

But things change when she becomes the pawn in Captain Hook's (Corey Burton) latest plot to catch Peter Pan (Blayne Weaver).  Hook thinks he's kidnapped Wendy, but Peter doesn't seem to care.  He is excited to have Jane on the island.  But Jane only wants to return home.  Will she find a way?  Will Hook get his ultimate revenge on Peter Pan?

As much as I love the original movie, I have been reluctant to watch this one.  It looked like too much of a retread to me.  And I was right.  Oh, they tried to change things up some.  And Jane's journey from cynic to faith is fun.  But the Hook/Peter battles felt all too familiar.  And the octopus filled in way too much for the crocodile, right down to the unexplained jerky ticking movements.

The animation was done in the old style, and I liked it.  It wasn't flashy most of the time, but it felt like a continuation of the original.  Likewise, the voice actors who took on the classic characters were remarkably accurate.

It's not that this is a bad film, but it's not all that great, either.  Kids will enjoy it, but adult fans aren't missing anything if they skip it.",1262217600,,1403,4.40234375

I like Disney sequels and prequels, I really do. At least sometimes.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-Mermaid-2/dp/B001G2S3X2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little Mermaid 2</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ariel-s-Beginning/dp/B000XUOIQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ariel's Beginning</a>&nbsp;were superb, as well as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lion-King-2/dp/B0001I55W4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lion King 2</a>, and each dealt carefully with issues that arose out of the previous movies. Return to Neverland, on the other hand, seems stale, flat, and dull - a soulless retread of the original.

The premise was a good one. Wendy's daughter, raised in a much more adult world, one defined by war, has no time for fairy tales. Robbed of a childhood, she is frustrated with her younger brother, and fears that the ""silly nonsense"" in his head may bring him to harm. When she finds herself transported by force into Neverland (in an absolutely eye-rollingly awful scene involving Hook, a flying ship, and a kidnapping scheme gone wrong), she is simply not ready to appreciate the fairy-tale-come-true world she finds herself in. Unfortunately, in order to leave, she must learn how to love Neverland, because only fairy dust (and faith!) will allow her to fly home.

With such a promising premise, it's hard to say how this movie went so wrong. The personalities seem to be sucked out of the characters. The Lost Boys are indistinguishable from one another (even more so than in the first movie), which is really just inexcusable when more recent efforts have shown that it doesn't need to be this way. Peter himself has no charm at all, none of the boyish delight that causes people to love him in spite of his faults. Tinkerbell has become a simpering sweet caricature of herself, apparently in preparation for her own movie in which Disney has decided to whitewash her into a sweet little fairy instead of the vibrant miniature woman Barrie imagined her to be. Hook has lost a great deal of character, too - where he was smooth, cruel, and calculating, he is now a bumbling fool and seems more comic relief than genuine menace. Apparently, this was an attempt to ""tone down"" the movie for younger audiences, but I do not believe it was a wise decision. Nor was the ""swap"" from crocodile to octopus, which is just painfully bad to watch.

You won't see much of Neverland here. The ""Indian camp"" has been razed to the ground, with nary a soul in sight, presumably because Disney couldn't figure out how to respectfully treat the natives and decided to bypass the issue. Again, more recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peter-Pan/dp/B0001HAISG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peter Pan</a>&nbsp;movies have managed to do this just fine, so it's a shame that Disney couldn't be bothered. Most of the sets - the mermaid lagoon, the tree house, the beach - fly by in quick succession as the paper-thin story plods along: Jane must be made to learn to relax and ""have fun"" before she can appreciate Neverland, believe in fairies (and save Tinkerbell's life), and go home. (""Faith!! Trust!! And pixie dust!!"" is shouted so often that my teeth began to stand on edge.)

I had hoped this would be a pro-female movie, but without the ""perfect princess"" platform that Disney usually relies on. Jane seems a good candidate for a ""just as good as a boy"" type of story where Peter and Jane both realize that they have a lot to learn from each other (even if Peter cannot learn to be serious, he could at least confront his own internal issues with females). No attempt is made at mutual self-discovery, however - Jane is ""taught"" that she needs to lighten up and stop being so serious and that's the end of it. The superficial ""lesson"" leaves the viewer unsatisfied and it would have been better if a little more depth had been expended to highlight the fact that there is a time and a place for both silliness AND seriousness, and that one must be wise to know which is which.

This movie is closed captioned for the hearing impaired.

there is a bunch of special features including Peter Pans alternate opening, deleted songs, Games like Sudoku challenge (i don't know any kids that can play sudoku) and Tarrrget practice and Pixie Hollow clips that are not in movie are placed in all three movie extras.

Also included are three pictures one from each film. They are now in my daughters room of course. The first is Peter with Wendy and her brothers flying by the clock. The second shows Jane holding on to Peter and a little angry Tinker Bell in front of them. The third is of tinker bell sprinkling fairy dust, over what, who knows i can't remember what scene that was from.

The movies are great, they arrived quickly and it was a great price about $35 i see now they bumped it up to $44 so i got lucky.

1437380,2,B00005JKX3,"Where do I begin?  Disney has again put out another lousy sequel to a great classic.  I never had high expectations for this movie when I decided to rent it, so I guess it was just a little bit better than I expected, but I still think it is a pretty dumb movie.
I won't waste my time summarizing the movie, so I'll just try to tell you what I liked and what I didn't like about it.
What I liked was most of the animation of this movie.  The style of the background art seemed to stay true to the original movie from the 1950s, although there was quite a bit of CGI used throughout the film.  Really, the animation was the only thing that I liked.
What I didn't like about the movie:
1. The Script
The dialogue of this movie is so boring to me.  A child in grade school could have written a better script than this one.  It seems like someone just made a rough draft and they just said, ""Yeah, we'll just use that,"" instead of taking any time to make it better.  Most Disney films are made for KIDS, but this one seems like it was just made for babies (who would probably also find it pretty boring).  In the first movie, while Peter was a kid, he was also very brave and clever.  In this movie, he just seems stupid.
2. The Music
There are absolutley no good songs in this movie.  The song about the lost boys is horrible.
3. Voices
Obviously, when you do a sequel to a movie that is over 50 years old, many of the original actors are either dead or too old to reprise their roles, so new people must be found.  With several characters, I feel that they made the wrong choice of actor.  For example, the chubby lost boy who they call Cubby in this movie has a voice that is nowhere near the original voice.  I feel that they should find people who can come close to doing the old voice and go with the person who does it best.  Otherwise the voice doesn't fit the character.  The person who did the voice of Smee sounded very much like the original, though.
So basically, this movie was a waste of time to me.  It could have been a very good sequal, but Disney just decided not to put any real effort into it, which is why it falls very short.  But like I said, I never had high expectations for it to begin with.",1215561600,3,2214,4.099767981438515
1437381,5,B00005JKX3,"Even as an adult, I'm still facinated by the Peter Pan story and this sequel gives fans a fun visual continuation of the story. It's not an award wining movie, but one that my two young daughters (ages 4 and 2) and I have watched over and over since receiving it. You get to know the Lost Boys a little more in this story and there's just enough action to hold the girls attention. Who doesn't dream of shouting ""I can fly!""?! Let this movie take you for another ride to Never Land.",1213920000,,482,4.193548387096774
1437399,4,B00005JKX3,"Walt Disney's production of J.M. Barrie's wonderful ""Peter Pan"" gets a whole new chapter with ""Return To Neverland.""  In this tale, a grown-up Wendy and her husband (who's been shipped off to war) are raising two young children in WWII London.  As she promised him in the original film, Wendy has never forgotten Peter Pan and she tells her children of his many adventures.  Young Daniel finds comfort in these tales as London is being bombed through the night.  Jane thinks such stories are rubbish and only for little kids.  She does not believe.

In an attempt to catch Peter once and for all, Captain Hook shows up in London the night before Jane and Daniel are to be sent to the country for protection and steals Jane mistaking her for Wendy.  When Jane arrives in Neverland, she must come to terms with this fantasy-turned-reality in order to save herself, the Lost Boys and little Tinkerbell.

Diehard fans of the first film (adults in particular) will likely pick this film apart for any and every imperfection or diversion from the original tale.  Fear not, faithful fans, this film doesn't try to remake the original.  It's a good story in its own right.  The animation is excellent, although the CG animation stands out a bit too much at moments.  There's little in the way of songs and there are no Indians or crocs to be seen.  Still, this is a fun tale that I'm sure the whole family will enjoy.

The DVD is very good.  As always, Disney has loaded this disc up with plenty of previews,as well as a Tinker Bell game, deleted scenes and a preview of the Disney ""Fairies"" collection.

This is a nice sequel.  It doesn't quite measure up to ""Cinderella Three:  A Twist In Time,"" but it is one of the better sequels that Disney has produced.  It's always tough to top the original of any film series, and especially a Disney original.  With that said, I give ""Return To Neverland"" a solid recommendation.",1211760000,2,1914,4.606508875739645
1437400,4,B00005JKX3,"I don't believe Disney has ever made a sequel that lived up to the magic of the original film.  That said, some sequels are better than others and this is one of the better ones.  I think this movie was very good mainly because it didn't ""re-do"" the original story in reverse (like Lady & the Tranp 2 or Little Mermaid 2) or try to lamely continue the old one (Cinderella 2, Jungle Book 2).  This is a new story with a new heroine, and stands on its own merits.

Wendy's daughter doesn't believe.  She has had to grow up fast in a world where her father is off to war and London is under seige.  So when Captain Hook kidnaps her thinking she is Wendy, she needs to learn how to believe again.  And that belief will give her family hope.  An uplifting story, filled with adventure and familiar characters.  It's not as good as the original, but is definitely worth watching.",1200441600,5,873,4.306748466257669
1437401,4,B00005JKX3,"I have quite a Disney collection, including animated and live movies.  I grew up with Disney.  ""Return to Never Land"" is a cute little follow-up to Peter Pan although it doesn't stand up to the original.  It involves the spunky daughter of Wendy, Peter's heartthrob from umpteen years ago.  I missed the crocodile, but the kids got a big kick out of the octopus.  My wife and I saw it in the theater when it was first released.  At first, I thought we'd be surrounded by screaming brats.  There was a surprising number of kidless adults there, and the kids present gave no problems once the movie started.  I figured that any movie that can appeal to that wide an age range must be worth getting for the home collection.  Four stars, one less for almost too much cute factor and no croc.",1200096000,,787,4.4475524475524475
1437402,4,B00005JKX3,"As good as the original if not better, Peter Pan in Return to Neverland is a surprisingly befitting sequel to one of the most popular of Disney's animated features. Featuring familiar faces and a touch of more mature themes, including a setting of war-torn London, this more thrilling adventure finds the daughter of Wendy being kidnapped by the ruthless pirate Captain James Hook (we always wanted to know his first name). Astounding animation and excellent voice acting provides for a highly entertaining sequel - which is certainly a rarity when it comes to animated features.

Wendy is all grown up and now has a family of her own. Her husband is away at war, and her young daughter Jane is supposed to look after the family, which also consists of little brother Daniel and the dog, Nana 2 (apparently Nana didn't live long enough to make the sequel). When a government decree is ordered to ship all the children off to the countryside for safekeeping, Jane is distraught at having to leave the family and annoyed at continually hearing about the adventures of Peter Pan. The stories from Wendy sooth little Daniel, but Jane is far too mature for such nonsense. When Captain Hook appears in London, he kidnaps Jane, mistaking her for Wendy, and brings her to Neverland to lure Pan. The high-flying adventurer quickly rescues her, only to realize that she's a bit too adult to have much fun in Neverland. Hook doesn't give up easily and returns to trick Jane into helping him capture Peter Pan and the Lost Boys once and for all.

It's an interesting and perhaps risky decision for the creators to choose a setting of presumably World War II in wartime London as bombs rattle homes and streets. It's a choice that actually works quite well to complement Jane's decidedly mature outlook on life and the fictitious Peter Pan. Things as childish as Peter Pan are discarded by Jane, although she secretly seems to wish she could be as carefree and fun-loving as both Daniel and Wendy and the stories they dwell on. And until Hook actually shows up, they are indeed just stories, of which she believes to be completely fabricated for Daniel's benefit. The first portion of the film would make a fine beginning for a live-action movie, as would much of the swashbuckling events later on.

Once again the animation is of the highest quality. Although shadows are typically done with less detail on animated films that don't go to theaters (this film was created by Disney's TV animation team), the character designs, movements and especially squash and scratch secondary movements are nearly unequaled. Some CG animation makes an appearance early on, primarily with Captain Hook's ship The Jolly Roger, but as with most of Disney's later feature-length films, they do a satisfactory job of blending it into the traditional.

The chirpy songs of the original are curiously absent, save for a single tune from the Lost Boys, and are instead replaced with somber melodies and music played in the background. This actually creates a more refreshingly serious tone - perhaps Return to Neverland's strongest feature is its unexpected seriousness. In the original film, everyone took Peter Pan and his existence for granted - here it is more emotional and realistic to see Jane struggling to believe in the fairytale world (and fairies at all, which causes Tinkerbell's light to dim) even as she interacts with its many amazing wonders.

The story is actually better crafted than the original, although J.M. Barrie's timeless tale will doubtlessly always win over the general vote, and Return to Neverland measures up to its predecessor admirably in every other aspect. Having all the elements that make a great animated feature, Peter Pan in Return to Neverland is one of the finest projects to come from the overabundance of sequels from Disney.

1437403,5,B00005JKX3,"We have been big fans of Peter Pan and The Return to Neverland for several years.  My daughter is now 6 and when she was 1 or 2 she received a hand-me-down figurine of Jane (Wendy's daughter from the Return to Neverland) and didn't let go of it for years...it was the one toy she wanted to take with her everywhere and luckily we managed to find a few more of them online and from family (came in handy when we lost one.)  When her brother came along (he's now 3), he grabbed onto the love of Peter Pan and The Return to Neverland as well and even wanted to hold the Jane figurine a lot as well (we were amazed as he's much more into boy things but still loves Jane.) They have really enjoyed The Return to Neverland and my husband and I find that it is one movie we don't mind watching with them sometimes.  We think it's a cute movie and love reading the storybook of Return to Neverland at bedtime too (we have watched the movie so many times that we have some of the dialogue down pat.)  And we like a couple of the songs in the movie (I think one is called ""I Try."") Others may not see the point to this sequel but I certainly do...it has brought so many smiles to my little ones and that's worth everything to me!",1196467200,2,1219,4.087866108786611
1437404,3,B00005JKX3,"I put this movie in the DVD player fully expecting the piece of crap movie that many of the reviews here talk about. After watching it ALL THE WAY THROUGH, I wonder if these reviewers actually watched the whole thing? Granted, it's not the caliber of the original, but it is definitely a more than pleasant family film to enjoy together with the children. The positives: the animation and backgrounds really amazed me; the characterization of Tinker Bell is especially faithful to the original. At times, the backgrounds slip into an almost too-perfect computer generated look, but overall, the animation is very good and better than what you normally see. Kudos also to the voices, especially the one of Captain Hook, who (again) is very faithful to the original. The story is also quite good; somewhat predictable, but definitely different enough to separate it from the original. I enjoyed the homage to the Mary Martin TV series (believing in Fairies/Tinkerbell getting weak) and the feistiness of the Jane character. The beginning of the film owes a little to the Narnia series, as it is set during the war when children were being shipped off for their own protection. Once in Neverland, it is back to fantasy and the realities of the war are not really dealt with again. The negatives are few; my biggest gripe is the potty/gross-out humor that I feel mars the film. The powers that be seem to be fascinated with snot; I could definitely do without the constant visual reference to this body fluid. In general, what this film really lacks is a strong plot-mover. It is entertaining, but not riveting; at no time would it be difficult to stop the movie and get a snack, makting this a great DVD to watch, but definitely not a movie to run to the theater to watch. The DVD itself has some nice extras; a few deleted scenes with commentary by the show's production team. There are also a few sneak peaks for the upcoming Tinkerbell movie (Tink looks better in traditional animation; not too swift in computer 3D style) and the obligatory game, ""Quest for the Light."" Overall, a good film to watch with the kids that is above the level of most of what's out there; if you are attempting to compare it to the original though, you will be slightly disappointed.",1195862400,6,2262,4.7146464646464645

I'm not just a hater of new Disney, I own and have seen this movie. Some of it is actually not too bad. Captain hook is funny and the animation is top notch. However, Peter Pan doesn't seem like the same Peter. He seems more immature and annoying. Also, why did they need to have the same dog and call it Nanna 2? This just goes to show how little thought was put into the movie. Out of all the names for the dog, they choose Nana 2.... my god!",1174694400,3,648,4.225806451612903

1437418,3,B00005JKX3,"It was a wonderful idea to make a ""sequel"" (if you can call the film a sequel fifty years later) to Peter Pan.  In the original novel, after Wendy has grown up, Peter returns to meet her daughter Jane.  I was very excited about this movie.

The movie begins as if it will be truly as magical as the original, and as appealing to children as to adults - which is part of the magic of Peter Pan.  The film takes place during WWII as London is being bombed.  Jane is the older child of grown-up Wendy.  Jane's father is off to war.  Jane's brother thrills to Wendy's tales of Neverland and Peter Pan.  Jane, however, does not believe in such ""childish nonsense.""  So here we have a great story - a child who does not believe in Peter Pan!  She must be saved from becoming a grown up!  Hook comes to kidnap Jane, thinking she is Wendy.  Then viewers are thrilled by a stunning opening sequence of Hook's flying pirate ship soaring over London among WWII fighter planes.

Unfortunately, the film climaxes here, just as it is beginning.  The rest of the film is mostly silly slapstick stuff.  Oh, Captain Hook has heart underwear - that is so FUNNY!  Jane becomes a kid just by skipping over some rocks.  The film is not so much a return to Neverland, because the rest of the movie is all action between the Lost Boys and the pirates.  Where is the exploration of the magical land?  The Indians? The mermaids?

The appeal to adults returns briefly at the end with a touching reunion between Wendy and Peter.

So this movie is great for kids - but only after they have seen the original.",1127520000,,1580,4.360824742268041

As the movie opens, Wendy (Kath Soucie) now grown up is married, has 2 kids, and when her husband goes off to serve in a war, Wendy stays home with daughter Jane (Harriet Owen) and son Danny (Andrew McDonough) but London is also keeping the children safe, and so both Jane and Danny will have to take a train for safety. Danny believes Wendy's stories about Peter Pan, but his older sister Jane does not. The night before Danny and Jane has to leave home, Captain Hook (Corey Burton) shows up, and mistakes Jane for Wendy, and kidnaps her. In Neverland, she is rescured by Peter Pan (Blayne Weaver).

The one thing I didn't like though was the lack of indians! They didn't even mention the word ""indian"". Sure, they showed the camp, but it was as empty as a ghost town. Oh well.

1437458,5,B00005JKX3,"I have three children - ages 6, 4 and 2.  I will be reviewing this movie from their perspective, not that of an adults.  They really enjoyed the movie.  Since they are not professional cartoonist, they did not care about the quality of the drawings.  If anything, the 'old style' cartoon movie (similar to the first Peter Pan) kept the feel of the first movie.  If they had used too many computer graphics, it would not have flowed well from the first movie.  My children also liked the story.  It was exciting, but not scary - even for the youngest.  Each of the characters was reasonably developed, although Jane is the focus of the movie.  She is Wendy's daughter, and Peter gets a supporting role in the plot.  Hook is back and is mean without being frightening.  Even the octopus, Hook's tormentor, is pretty tame.  As for the quality of the music, my kids liked it and even asked for the soundtrack.  (It is OK, but mostly instrumental takes from the movie.  There are three good songs on it though...) Finally, some reviewers have critiqued the voices and complained they are not exact matches for the first Peter Pan.  If you know him personally, then you might have a complaint.  You have also grown-up way too much to ever enjoy this movie.  (Go see the Exorcist or something!)  Unless you have gone to bed every night since the 50's listening to Peter, you will not notice anything different on the voices.  From a child's perspective, you won't be thinking of such things anyway.  The story deals with typical Neverland topics: growing up, the pressures of being a kid, and the battle between carefree youth and grumpy people.  By the way, this is all done without making adults or parents out to be the bad guys.  The pace of the movie is great, keeping the kid's interest and being long enough to take them on a meaningful adventure without exhausting their attention span.
The best part of the movie is the end when Peter takes the kids home and is reunited with Wendy.  It is a great scene and one that brings back memories of the first movie's magic to both young and old.  I know my kids loved it.  I thought this movie did not strike me as a lot of Disney movies do these days - shallow, trashy and money driven.  This is a 1950's style Disney film, not the crud they also release these days with cussing, stupid adults and not too subtle adult themes.
My kids thought this movie was great and a real clean story.  Appreciate a kid's movie through their eyes, not an adult's, and you will escape to Neverland with your children enjoying the trip along the way!",1046044800,110,2579,4.502155172413793

I personally hate Disney sequels and i had no intention of even watching this one; but my stepdad bought it for my little sister and i swear she watched it at least 5 times a day! and she watched it so much i learned the lines to this movie by just hearing it accross the room! so last night i finally asked her to let me watch her peter pan movie with her and she got really happy i was blown away with:
 -----how they pick up were they left off on Peter Pan
 -----the animation is pretty good compared to other disney sequels (i.e. return of jafar)
 -----the music is pretty good (jonatha brooke) C' mon someone complained about the music here but it is 2002 and the first was in the 1950's so we have to be up to date w/ our music soundtracks
 ----- all of the characters almost have the same voices i personally did not find a voice that didn't match.
 ----- the plot dosen't suck compared to the other poor excuse disney sequels, that's why i guess it was released in theatres
the only think that left me bugged was the inexplicable disapearence of the tick tock crocodile?..... but fear not he was repleaced by a super funny ""tick tock"" octopus that i personally found really hilarious!
so above all this is a very nice movie for all ages, very clean and descent for a sequel (again) i reccomend it if you wonder what ever happened after peter pan left wendy and the boys at their window...
so i am going to buy this movie before it is too late (jan 31 is the last shipment) and add it to my Disney DVD collection!",1041638400,5,1697,4.241486068111455

I missed the Crocodial and his predicatable ""tic tic tic"". The new octopus just didn't do it for me! I did purchase this, as a last min. gift for the 5 year old ( He is just now reading the ""Original Story""). It filled time on the long holiday afternoons when the adults were just all ""played/read out"". The 5 year old along with preverbal sibs and older cousins watched this DVD about twice in 14 days. They watched other versions of Peter Pan more often. The only advantage I can see is that we now have: the entire collection from Mary Martin /Original Disney/ Robin Williams/ Two World Class Ballet Company Performances ( Kirov and ABT)on Video & now the ""New Version"" of the Very Magical Tale/ gone awry. I hope Peter in Kennsington Gardens doesnt get word of the new character roles, ( Tinker Bell in this DVD/Video would scare Jas Hook Himself)

1437461,3,B00005JKX3,"""Return to Neverland"" has been released recently in Japan more unceremoniously as ""Peter Pan 2"", and for all this uninviting alternate title the film is not a commercial flop.  Japanese distributors might give heartfelt thanks for the brand name of Disney.
The plot is so simple, being summerized in the original title, but it is given a twist.  This time, not Wendy, but her daughter Jane goes, or returns, to Neverland, kidnapped by Captain Hook and his men.  And Jane is not a girl who could easily believe in fairy tales, but her cynical quality causes another trouble in Neverland after she is saved by Peter Pan and the Lost Boys.  Oh, and lovely Tinker Bell appears again.
Adults would be quick to find out the flaw of the film, which was originally to be released as a video; that is the very thin story.  Actually, its running time is slightly more than 70 minutes, and even with the inclusion of a delightful short film ""Pluto's Fledgling"", we still doubt the necessity of its theatrical release.  In fact, everything is given too short time; new character such as Tick-tock Octopus is funny, but not fully used: The Lost Boys are there, but have little to do: the descriptions of Wendy/Jane's family are minimal as if making a parody of Hollywood tradition -- two kids, one daughter and one oy, a dog, father is away and mother at home etc..  But the most regrettable is Tinker Bell, who could have been more intriguing  existence in Neverland.  Being envious of Jane's presence, lovely Tink tries to dismiss Jane back to human's world, and her action is more interesting than that of ever-young Peter Pan or one-note Captain Hook.  How come they decided to treat her that way?
The visual of the film is first-rate with good character and production designs.  But it is Disney, you know, and that does not come as surprise.  After watching this film, which is not a disappointment, I admit, I still was wondering why the studio gave it a theatrical release.  The film is much better than ill-fated production such as Spielberg's ""Hook"" -- no kids get hurt -- and I believe parents can hand over a copy of this film without worry.  But as animation film fan, looking at the hit-or-miss releases of Disney such as ""Atlantis"", ""Lilo and Stitch"", and ""Treasure Planet"" (I do not say which is ""hit"" because you already know that), I start to worry about the future of this celebrated studio, which is clearly eclipsed by the advent of other newer companies like Pixar.",1040947200,2,2474,4.683602771362587

I was quite shocked when I saw it. Jane was taken out of the original Peter Pan story (She appears in the last chapter of the book ""When Wendy grew up"".)And she was taken to Neverland then before the book ended.
Also, the part where Jane had to believe in fairies came from the book too. Though in the book, Tinker Bell drank poison to save Peter & Peter had to make the children clap to show they believe.

I used to watch The Wonderful World of Disney every week to see the previews because maybe something from the movie might be on the show. I saw it more than 20 times in the theaters right through college  until it was finally released on video.
Walt was an innovative artist. This movie is garbage.
If Walt Disney were alive this film would make him ill; it never would have been released. I believe that is true of all of the so called ""sequels"" that Disney Studios has released. All they are doing is taking an extremely popular part of film history and releasing sequels to generate millions of dollars because of the bottom line, and because so many fans just buy it.
The animation in the film is weak, the story line[is weak], the characters are the same without the personality, and their is a lack of true escape and adventure. This was probably originally slated to be released straight to video, as were the other animated sequels, but the lure of ripping off the public for the almighty dollar was too enticing.

Peter Pan has still not grown up, Captain Hook is still quite mean, especially for a kid's feature, Tinkerbell is still a babe, and The Lost Boys seem to have been lost when they were giving out brains.
However, it's basically the same plot all over again.  Only substitute Wendy's daughter, who is at first mistaken for Wendy by those who don't understand the concept of aging.

So when I heard a sequel to Peter Pan was coming out I rolled my eyes and prepared for another poor excuse for a movie. To my surprise, Return to Neverland is not only good, but I actually liked it better than the original movie! I can't believe I actually said that! And to think I LOVED Peter Pan was I was younger. This movie has beautiful animation, a pretty decent story, and nice voice acting. My only complaint is the voice of Peter. His voice is WAY too young sounding to fit his character model. Peter has the body of a teenager 15-16 years old. He's slightly more muscular in this than the original. And yet he sounds like he's 8 years old. Another downer is that Peter hasn't matured any. I know he doesn't age any in Neverland but sometimes he just get annoying with his childish antics. He looks too old to be such a brat. The music in this movie is also not so good.

I miss the Indians (my favorites in the original), but they are paid their tribute as well. But the best work is the animation...Lilo and Stitch has been given raves for it's retro look, but this stuff REALLY nails the classic 50's Disney style, with great 3-D camera work, lush backgrounds and for a knock-off Disney sequel, well-drawn character depth...

There is not an orginal thought in this movie, basically recycling plot after plot, and retelling plots that were wrapped up in the first one. The voices are terrible, not anything like the orginal-Smee is the ultimate in this regard. The animation is substandard, the computer animation seems out of place and from a video game of the same name, and the songs are GOD AWFUL! I am no musician, but this music makes me want to cringe. Also, to add insult to injury, the makers of this film bring in the themes from the orginal every once in a while to help to remind you that this is a sequal to a much better motion picture.
 I haven't come to expect much from Disney movies lately. This is a good example of why Disney is a running joke in my household.
 If you thought Little Mermaid 2, Cinderella 2, Hunchback 2, etc...were just as good as the orginal, then this movie is highly recommended. But, if the above mentioned titles are seen as terrible worthless pieces of animation with their recycled plots and subpar animation, then stay away from this movie, you'll be doing yourself a big favor.",1030233600,2,1220,4.490990990990991
1437508,5,B00005JKX3,"After the Williams/Spielberg ""Hook"" fiasco, I wondered if even Disney could actually pull of a worthy sequel to their classic Peter Pan movie. I needn't have worried. Almost fifty years on, Return To Never Land fully recaptures the magic of the original.
One reason this works so well is that the modern animators have remained true to the original character and set designs. Add to this an inspired piece of voice casting, which was essential and entirely successful in the Hook, Pan and Smee characters, and you have a fairly seamless continuation of the classic story.
There are a few minor technical glitches, such as Wendy taking her son to the ""bomb shelter"" instead of the ""air raid shelter"" or ""Anderson shelter"", the appearance of Stuka dive bombers on a night raid, and the emergency vehicles using a type of siren that did not appear in Britain until the sixties. Still, this hardly detracts from what is a first class piece of entertainment.
The animation is superb throughout and at times, simply breathtaking, especially the aerial sequences and the arrival of Hook's ship. On the heels of the utterly superb Atlantis: The Lost Empire, Return To Never Land is yet another example of Disney stamping their authority on the world of animation.
The modern touches also work well in the mix, such as when Hook's ship passes through a mandala-laden stargate to reach the Never Land. The directions, ""second star to the right and straight on till morning"" were probably an allusion to Sirius, which was suspected of being a binary (twin) star even at the time of the original Peter Pan book.
I know some people were disappointed with the movie and I respect their opinions, but for me, it worked brilliantly, and the soundtrack contains some classic songs. My youngest daughter watched it four times in a row upon getting it home (we bought it this morning - the release date for Canada) and she's normally a pretty stern critic of anything ""average"".
A breathtaking first fifteen minutes and a beautiful ending sandwiching a highly entertaining middle section. Hey, that can't be so bad.",1029801600,7,2096,4.890449438202247
1437509,4,B00005JKX3,"As a child I loved Peter Pan (didn't we all?).  At 21, I still love it (yes, I'm a hopeless Disney buff).  When they at last released a sequal, one strong enough to release to theatres instead of directly to video, I WAS ecstatic.  Although this movie was directed more at kids than adults than the first one, I still enjoyed it very much.
The animation is gorgeous.  That is the film's biggest plus.  Disney went all out to create a Neverland by today's standards, increasing on the beauty of the original that, in the widescreen theatre I attended, was perfect enough to dazzle my eyes.  I felt I was flying along with them as they soared.
Plotwise, even though it is somewhat thinner than the original Peter Pan (hence four stars instead of five) there are very intense emotional moments that seared itself into my brain.  I have almost never cried at a movie before but this one had tears in my eyes at times.  I forsee this as a classic in the making.  They did a wonderful job.
Captain Hook was a slight disappointment, but the humor surrounding him was funny enough (at least, for kids) to almost make up for it.  I tend to see him as more of a side character than in the first one, and the main point, having Jane rediscover her child within amidst WWII, being more of the focus.
I really enjoyed how the Lost Boys played a bigger part in this, as well.  They spoke more and had more intelligence, though they were still funny.
I definetly reccomend this DVD to anyone when it comes out.  If I enjoyed it this much in the theatres, I doubt I'll enjoy it any less at home.",1025481600,8,1579,4.351535836177474
1437510,4,B00005JKX3,"Disney's straight to video sequels are obviously going downhill. ""Return to Neverland"" was started as a straight to video sequel, but after a close look at the story, Walt Disney Feature Animation decided to give it a higher budget and release it in theaters. The animation was smooth and there were several good computer animation sequences. It really is a clever story picking up from where the original play ends. At the end of the play, Wendy is all grown up with a daughter, Jane. Peter, holding to his promis, comes back for Wendy who can't return to Neverland since she is grown up. So he takes Jane. In the movie, because no one in Neverland has a sense of time, Captain Hook kidnaps Jane mistaking her for Wendy. Peter rescues Jane, but is having an awful time trying to teach Jane how to fly so she can return home. Jane's father has not come back from WW2 and Jane and her brother are going to be placed in a shelter away from their mother. It is a little darker than the original and in no way is better, but it is still good and suitible for the whole family to sit and enjoy.",1025395200,6,1089,4.3431372549019605
1437511,2,B00005JKX3,"Neverland?  More like ""Never again.""
A lackluster effort churned out by Disney's television animation team (and seemingly written by a computer), _Return to Neverland_ still managed to dredge up decent box office from movie-starved families back in February 2002.
Of course, _Return_ plays shamelessly on boomers' fond memories of Disney's _Peter Pan_ (itself a thoroughly gutted adaptation of J.M. Barrie's stage play).  But for some reason that I cannot fathom let alone explain, _Return_ consistently sabotages the light-hearted tone that made the first film at least palatable, if not especially distinguished.
Parents be warned: _Return to Neverland_ is a very SERIOUS children's film.  If one were to judge by this sequel, one would suspect that the original playwright was not J.M. Barrie, but Ibsen or Chekhov.  So what the deuce was Der Maushaus thinking?  With an unlikable sourpuss for a heroine, terrifying scenes of the London blitz, and the lingering near-death of a major character, no one has any fun in Neverland this time around.
Even a generous dollop of pixie dust in the third act can't keep this film from crashing and burning.  Still, a typically solid DVD package from Disney mitigates the grinding disappointment.",1025222400,2,1238,5.290816326530612
1437512,5,B00005JKX3,"First off, I'm 21 years old but still have a place in my heart for cartoons and Disney usually does an excellent job of putting on a good show for both children and adults. This movie fell short by a huge margin. Most animated movies produced in the last 10 years have had something for both children and adults. This one hopes to entertain little kids at best.
As plot goes, Disney suceeds in telling the same story that the told in Peter Pan with a few alterations.  The story revolves around a trip from the real world into Neverland and the strange antics that go on there.  Then after a time the main character's decide that they want to go home.  The battles that are fought with Captain Hook take place again in this movie and it comes across as being almost exactly the same.  The characters to struggle to be different from the original Peter Pan. The main thing they did was change the names. Wendy's daughter (Jane) is now the main character.  She is too grown up to believe in Peter Pan which is the only destiguishing aspect of her character.  The other main character change was the alligator.  Now instead of an alligator with a clock in his stomach there is a giant octopus chasing Captain Hook, and he does the exact same things that the alligator did, snapping his suction cups instead of the clock ticking.  The story itself is only differed by the way Jane gets to Neverland, being obducted by Captain Hook, instead of going willingly with Peter.  And the subplot with Tigerlily and the indians isn't included or redone.
The music in this movie falls way short of what you'd expect from a full length Disney feature. The oscar winning composers of several Disney movies must have left this one up to the understudies.  The music, while trying to stay true to the original, was matched with lyrics that didn't even fit into the patterns that were played.  And while that sells records for bands like ""System of a Down"" it just didn't work in this movie.  The rhythm of most of the songs was so uneven that it sounded like a 4 year old wrote them. And the Lost Boy song alone made me very anxious for the end credits to come up and I can usually watch a movie two times in a row without getting bored.
There really isn't any aspect of this movie that gives me reason to recommend it to adults who might want to see this movie. Something is just missing. My recommendation, watch another Disney movie, like the original Peter Pan or just let the little kids can watch it by themselves while you watch something that has a little more to it.
The Breakdown:
1. Plot-6 (Same story as original, typical sequel by disney)
2. Characters-5 (Same characters as the first, some just in different form)
3. Flow-5 (Slow pace, songs dragged a lot)
4. Atmosphere-4 (Nothing special, songs actually took away points)
5. Animation-5 (Hook's ship was neat but everything else was to simple)
6. Entertainment factor-4 (I liked Peter Pan, but this sequel was pretty boring)
7. Replay factor-1 (The only way I'll ever see this again is if my kids want to watch it some day)
8. Character Depth-4 (Bad replacements for characters in the original)
9. Relevance to genre-3 (I expect more from Disney)
10. X-factors-2 (A few funny moments but that was it)
