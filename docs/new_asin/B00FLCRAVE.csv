6006826,5,B00FLCRAVE,"""The Cat"" aka ""Two Eyes That See Death"" is making its Western shores blu-ray debut in January. I saw this film in 2012. For those that may think that Asian Horror has gotten stale, this is the film to restore your faith. My wife and I were terrified watching this film. If you like K-Horror films like ""Phone"", ""A Tale of Two Sisters"", ""Arang"", ""Apartment"", ""Epitaph"", ""Ryeong"" and others, then this one will please you as well. Can't wait for this blu-ray!!! Kudos to Well Go USA! Now if Well Go USA can just release ""Howling"" (2012) starring Song Kang Ho on blu-ray; another awesome film!",1381622400,21,590,4.5754716981132075

6006838,5,B00FLCRAVE,"Though this wasn't a scary movie, it was a very good movie.  It had a well-paced, developed plot.  The general synopsis is that there were a bunch of stray cats picked up from a condo's basement.  The few surviving animals are adopted, but then the owners died.  Before they die, they all claim they see a little girl.  The end is rather sad.

My only complaint was with the subtitles.  They were very small and italic.  When they were on a white background, they had a tendency to fade.  Though I was able to keep up with the movie, I did miss some parts of the conversation.",1412553600,,576,4.308411214953271
6006839,5,B00FLCRAVE,"Excellent Korean horror.  South Korea has an excellent film industry with kudos to their horror genre.  Discovered few years back with ""a Tail of Two Sisters"".  South Korean names generally have a hyphen in last name.",1410652800,4,217,4.972222222222222

6006842,3,B00FLCRAVE,"Not really my cup of tea, but still an original plot.

In the film, So-yeon works as a pet groomer, where she enjoys a rather peaceful life, until one of her clients dies. In fact, she dies soon after picking up her cat, Silky, from So-yoen's business.  Not knowing what to do with the cat, the police allow So-yeon to take the cat home. Once she does, she begins to see the image of a little girl haunting her. Both at her house and at her business. It complicates matters for So-yeon who also happens to be claustrophobic. At first she thinks seeing the little girl could be psychological, but soon she discovers otherwise as more misfortunes follow her through the people she knows. Later, she discovers that more cats are connected to the haunting and a slight mystery develops. The film takes a few interesting twists and turns until it reaches a predictable conclusion, I won't spoil it for you.

Well, I liked how this film used an original idea. However, for me, a cat is not a frightening creature. Granted, the film did jump me a few times, but it didn't have the full scare potential that it could have. Cats being a big part of the horror aspect was the culprit.  However, the little girl haunting So-yeon did add some spice. But it wasn't done as well like I've seen in other films. The Japanese movie Dark Water comes to mind. That story also involves the haunting of a little girl and was a lot scarier in my opinion. Plus, if I'm not mistaken, The Cat may have borrowed a few ideas from Dark Water. It was very reminiscent of Dark Water near the end.

In addition, the mystery about the little girl was rather weak in my opinion. It seems to get shoved at you near the end of the film, like it was trying to conveinently tie things up. Almost like the film was deciding whether the horror aspect was supposed to be about the cats or the little girl. I got everything by the end, but it didn't blow me out of the water. It was very run of the mill.

On the up side, one of the more interesting factors in the film is So-yoen's claustrophobia. It plays a role in some of her encounters and creates more terror for her. I also liked the back story of her friend and her boyfriend's ex. That helped bring a little more drama to the situation and helped set the tone for the type of person So-yeon was. Basically a gentle woman who has a big heart for both people and animals alike, particularly cats. It was in contrast to many of the people she came across in the film. But this is also a complaint, as it seemed like the contrast was just an excuse to create more targets for the haunting. At least, that's the way it came across to me.

In any case, the film is in Korean only with English subtitles. No other features appear.

In the end I gave the film three stars. It was fairly original in its ideas, and So-yoen was likeable enough. I also liked the back story with her friend and the little love triangle it created. But the love triangle gets cut short in my opinion, due to the film trying push more horror onto the viewer. So it was a mixed bag for me.

Also, here's a slight warning note for you if you like cats. This film may not sit well with people who are avid cat lovers, as there are a few scenes that aren't very forgiving to cats. But if you are a cat lover, it might heighten the creepiness factor for you. You never know, people are different. Not a terrible film, just not a great one either. A decent rental at best, but probably not a keeper for most.",1398038400,2,3490,4.275757575757575
6006843,4,B00FLCRAVE,"Once again, S.Korea outdoes itself with one of the best offerings in the genre. Creepy at times, horrific at others, and unexpectedly heartbreaking (the cats, man, the cats....*sniff*), by the end I knew how the story was going to unfold, but it didn't make it any less difficult to watch. One of the most effective horror films I have seen in a long time. Highly recommended.",1395705600,3,376,4.712121212121212
6006844,2,B00FLCRAVE,"I should have know this movie about Animal wasn't going to be a EVENING with "" Hot tea & cookies ""! I have held off giving My opinion because I usually enjoy giving positive reviews! Well,Here Goes, #1 I always like when Someone pays for thier CRIMES! One of My ""biggest problems ""today is It appears ONE CAN DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING ,but never receive the"" Consequences""for thier actions! "" #2 This movie DOES provide  this! #3 The Biggest  problem with the Movie is the way They make a choice to show  the condition of some of the cats! I think They were getting thier message across without showing This!  This isn't a movie I would watch again ! It is ""Expensive"" & If You aren't watching it again especially AFTER You ordered it in advance because I thought it would be a GOOD MOVIE ?",1394150400,,787,4.36986301369863
6006845,5,B00FLCRAVE,"Glad that line was displayed immediately after the last scene. I was worried. Its hard for me to give this movie a 5 star rating, as a cat lover, given the hardship the poor guys faced throughout the movie. However, the humans were getting theirs too. Plus, I think its only a reflection of reality, and portraying the inhumanity of the human species can hardly be cause to deduct a star from an otherwise very well done and entertaining film.

The synopsis is all you really need to know about the plot. Its a very interesting and engaging story, with the ""why"" of it all, gradually unfolding at a proper pace. The thematic content is nothing new but the casting of cats to tell it is and kept it from becoming an ""oh, that again"",storyline. .

The acting was strong and effective. The visuals were striking and production values high. No complaints regarding the music or sound effects. No complaints at all. If  you enjoy Asian horror, I think you will be satisfied by this offering. I sure was. I will watch it again, despite how tough it was at times to watch the plight of the cats in the film. FYI, I don't mean a sicko individual cat torturer but institutionalized cruelty, as in shelters, for the most part. There were some individuals whose behavior would've earned them a butt kicking if I was around.. But like I said, the cats scored some points too. .",1391299200,14,1365,4.518218623481781
6006846,4,B00FLCRAVE,"Knd of a cross between the movies ""Willard"" and ""The Grudge"". Like ""Willard"" except with cats instead of rats. And like ""The Grudge"" I'm not sure how the possession took place. I liked it. Its worth the rental.",1391126400,3,210,4.552631578947368

The disc itself seems to okay fine, but after watching the movie for a bit it looks like the edges were slightly cut off. The video quality seems good though.",1529366400,,317,4.129032258064516

8616676,4,B00FLCRAVE,"This evening I wanted to watch foreign movies because I would like to see different culture, heritage, place and its actor. However, this movie is a bit slow from the beginning but something is lacking in this movie. The cat here is scary (glaring eyes and a bit wild) whoever owned this cat will die from unexplained tragedy. The last part almost made me cry about this little girl fell off from the dry water tank. Anyways, I thought Im not going to like it as I post this comment while I was in the middle of the movie.",1429660800,3,522,4.282828282828283
