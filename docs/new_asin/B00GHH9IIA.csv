6075622,5,B00GHH9IIA,"Scream Factory releases are hit and miss. Sometimes the extras are lacking or they have great extras the movie itself is lacking but this isn't the case for their release of the 80s Cult Classic, Night Of The Demons. The film itself looks amazing. Having first watched this movie on VHS, then DVD, and now Blu Ray, the Blu Ray has brought out elements of the cinematography and the special make-up effects that were lost in their original releases. The commentary track with the cast and director was fun to listen to. I loved it. But the making of on this release was hands down the best extra on this release. You learn so much of what went on behind the scenes and how the movie came to be made. It would compare it to the making of of John Carpenter's The Thing. It's not as thorough but it came pretty close. Growing up, I always had a crush on Cathy Podewell and she still looks stunning! If you're a fan of the movie, you should purchase this release. It's a must! ""...where you going? The party's just begun"".",1393977600,3,1017,4.386243386243386
6075623,4,B00GHH9IIA,"I have nostalgic feelings about this film but if you were to judge it on its own merritt then I'd give it a watch once then forget it. Not bad to watch but probably not worth owning for most. If your really into horror then this movie might get you a few times, I know it scared me as a child.",1393804800,,293,3.819672131147541
6075624,5,B00GHH9IIA,I liked the fact that it was mostly human interaction it wasn't a lot of high tech special effects an dthe characters to me were believable they were really scared plus everybody did not die some of them made it out,1392768000,,215,4.2682926829268295
6075625,5,B00GHH9IIA,"Now we all know horror films are not for everyone, so thats why this review is solely for horror fans who love the classic 80's cheese movies. This movie reminds me very much of Lamberto Bava's 'Demons'. A bunch of stupid teens get trapped in a building and they end up at the mercy of a bunch of evil Demons! You get what you hope for here. You get bad acting, nudity and gore. It moves along at a fast pace and you never get bored. A great movie to stick on at an Halloween party. Its a blast.

I very much liked the music score in the movie, Its very creepy and plus you get your dose of heavy metal music. Awesome.

My fellow horror fans, you will have a great time with this flick. Go out and buy it. Actually , i think i might watch it again so i can see Linnea Quigley breasts again.",1392336000,4,790,3.9936708860759493

Everybodys headed to Hull House, a deserted funeral home, formerly the home of a mass murderer. But when the partygoers decide to have a seance, they awaken something evil...and these party crashers have a thirst for blood. Now its a battle for who can survive the night in Hull House.

This horror flick also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 16 years old in my Sophomore year in high school during its theatrical release in the Fall of 1988.",1391731200,,543,4.540816326530612

6075628,4,B00GHH9IIA,"You get a Blu-ray and a DVD in this Shout! Factory release. Night of the Demons (1988) was directed by Kevin S. Tenney. This is the unrated cut of the movie. This collector's edition also comes with a new commentary and new interviews.

The following scenes included in the unrated version were cut from the theatrical release to earn an MPAA rating of ""R"" rather than an ""X"":
*The scene in which Angela bites off Stooge's tongue is a few seconds longer with a little bit more blood.
*When Suzanne gouges out Jay's eyes, the shot lingers slightly longer, exposing more gore.
*The close up shot of the razor blade ripping from the old man's throat is slightly extended with more gore.
*In the convenience store scene at the beginning of the unrated version, Linnea Quigley's character asks the two male clerks if they have ""Sour Balls"". In the R rated version, she simply walks past them, and out of the store.
*In the unrated version, the party scene is a little longer with more exposition.
*There are substantially more shots of Angela floating through the hallway.
*For reasons still unknown, the giant demon head that appears over Hull House at the end of the film has animated glowing red eyes in the unrated version, but does not in the R-rated theatrical cut.

6075629,5,B00GHH9IIA,"I honestly hadn't seen Night of the Demons for about a decade when I sat down to watch this Blu-ray. Most of my memories of the film were from watching an old VHS copy, so this Collector's Edition Blu-ray from Shout! Factory was something of a revelation. The first thing I noticed was how much the film owes to classic horror tropes. When I first saw the film I didn't realize how much it was playing with expectations about teen movies. Of course the poster art explicitly calls out Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street, but the film itself is going for more classic teen archetypes, from the guy wearing the pig nose and being a jerk to the virginal girl and her Alice costume.

More importantly, this time I noticed just how different Night of the Demons is from its eighties counterparts. The film isn't a killfest from start to finish. Instead, we get almost half the running time before things really start to happen in terms of gore and kills. Though I wouldn't argue that the kids involved in this Halloween massacre are Shakespearean creations, they are a bit more delineated than the average slasher bait. That first half is crucial for establishing atmosphere, from the creepy Hull House to the weird dancing of Angela. Then, once things kick off, Night of the Demons makes a crucial decision that sets it above many of its contemporaries: rather than giving us a single bad guy to stalk each of the characters, multiple teens are possessed. This gives the final act a lot more momentum and sets it apart from the many hack-and-slash horror films of the era.

Night of the Demons (Blu-ray) proves even the most cultish of cult films can benefit from an excellent hi-def release. Things start with a beautiful 1.85:1/1080p AVC-encoded transfer. It seems to have been struck from a re-mastered print of the film, and even manages to best the decent DVD from ten years ago. This transfer maintains a brilliantly film-like look, with appropriate grain throughout. The numerous scenes in the near-dark of Hull House showcase solid black levels and good range between the shadows and full darkness. Perhaps the biggest complaint is that the image is sometimes a bit soft, but that seems like a fact of shooting rather than a problem with this transfer. No excessive sharpening or DNR seems to have been applied to compensate.

Fans get their choice of three DTS-HD tracks. The first is the film's original 2.0 stereo track. It sounds a bit dated, with a more limited dynamic range and directionality, but it's clean and clear. Next up is a 5.1 mix that adds a bit more directionality and sounds just a bit fuller. There's also a re-mastered stereo track that sounds like it might be a downmix of the 5.1 track. All three suffer a bit for being almost thirty years old. Dialogue, though, is generally clean and clear, and the synth-driven score sounds better than I've heard it before.

Extras, though, are where this release really shines. Things kick off with a pair of commentaries. The first is a vintage track from 2004 featuring director Kevin Tenney, producer Jeff Goeffray, and exec producer Walter Josten that covers a lot of ground, including the difficulty casting the film and wrangling a low budget. Then, we get a new commentary again featuring Tenney, along with effects guru Steve Johnson and stars Cathy Podewell, Billy Gallo, and Hal Havins. This track is a bit more anecdotal, but both are fun. Then, we get a 72-minute documentary that's brand new and goes into pretty much everything you could want to know about the making of Night of the Demons. All the major players show up for interviews, and there's plenty of footage to spice up their talking-heads. Mimi Kincade gets an extended 23-minute interview, which is nice for the star of the franchise. We also get a host of promo material, including a pair of trailers, a TV spot, a radio spot, and an EPK. Finally, there's a set of still galleries. Also in the set is a DVD copy of the film, and the liner notes are reversible.

6075630,4,B00GHH9IIA,"Scream Factory is extremely efficient at their job of releasing and cleaning up many of the lost genre gems of the 1980s and 1990s. I'm beginning to have a hard time introducing each new Blu-ray or DVD versions of the movies they save from obscurity. It's now time for ""Night of the Demons"" to make its high definition debut.

Weirdo party girl Angela (Amelia Kinkade) invites a group of school friends to a Halloween party at the secluded Hull House. It's the perfect place to host the get-together, considering it was once a funeral home with a mysterious past rooted in the occult. It doesn't take long before the good times go bad, as each attendee becomes possessed by demons or killed by them.

I remember seeing ""Night of the Demons"" back in the early 1990s and thinking it was absolutely awful in every way. I thought the acting was bad. I thought the special effects were unbelievably cheesy. Watching it again now, I realized that the acting really WAS bad really bad. However, I would categorize it as ""so bad, it's good."" I was completely wrong about the special effects. Every severed limb and gory sequence is handled with care and efficiency.

It's safe to say ""Night of the Demons"" has probably never looked or sounded so great. The hi-def conversion didn't take any of the 1980s ""real film"" flavor out of the viewing experience. The clean picture makes sure that every spurt of blood is as bright as it should be. The audio upgrade surrounds the audience in all the blood-curdling screams and squishy gross-out sound effects you can think of.

The Scream Factory Collector's Edition of ""Night of the Demons"" is unrated and claims to have more gore and violence. There certainly is a lot of blood dripping and oozing out of people. There's also some full-frontal nudity and these characters curse like sailors. It's pretty standard stuff for a 1980s horror film.

The movie might have demons, but don't expect anything remotely theologically sound from a religious standpoint. That's not the point of ""Night of the Demons."" Nothing is to be taken seriously in this fun and entertaining grade-B flick. I guess you could say the message of the movie is don't conjure demons or mess with the occult.

As we've all come to expect, Scream Factory's Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack comes with some great bonus material. New commentary is provided by Director Kevin S. Tenney and actors Cathy Podewell, Hal Havins, Billy Gallo, and FX artist Steve Johnson. A second commentary track features Director Tenney, Executive Producer Walter Josten, and Producer Jeff Geoffray sharing their insights. New interviews with both the cast and crew include Director Tenney, Writer/Producer Joe Augustyn, actress Linnea Quigley, and others. A promo reel, video trailer, theatrical trailer, TV and radio spots, still galleries, and more are found as well.

Revisiting ""Night of the Demons"" for this special Collector's Edition made me appreciate it more than I did when I first saw it 20 years ago. It's a near-perfect example of schlock 1980s comedy/horror with parts that will have you laughing out loud. It also reminds the viewer how much fun movies were when there were practical effects versus everything being CGI the way it is today.",1390176000,20,3229,4.892138939670932
6075631,5,B00GHH9IIA,"I remember watching this movie when I was about 8 or 10 years old.

6075636,4,B00GHH9IIA,"Among my favorite horror films of the 1980s so absolutely I knew what I was ordering and I've no problem with the film itself. This set contains a blu ray and a dvd and I always appreciate that. However, upon arrival, I discovered that one of the discs had come loose from its encasement (plastic holder) and had been shifting around loose inside the case. So one of the discs was scratched beyond repair. Upon phoning Amazon and describing the problem they actually credited my account for the item and the other disc plays fine. I genuinely appreciated Amazon for doing this because it's always difficult with dvds/blu rays - once they're opened they're not returnable - but you don't know they're damaged until you open them. So I do thank Amazon for reimbursing me for this issue. Damaged disc aside - as aforementioned, this is one of my favorite horror films.",1502409600,,865,4.697368421052632
6075637,5,B00GHH9IIA,"I really like this movie, and the genre as well.  There's something about 1980's movies.  They are serious, funny, interesting, and reasonably fast-paced.

Now almost 30 years later I was curious to see how this held up, and am very pleased to say it's every bit as good as I recall. TON of 80's horror tropes in here, but there are still so many touches of originality and surprises that you didn't see in many of the other films of the time. Effects are great, the cast is lively and full of distinct personalities, and the climax is still one of my favorites.

6075669,5,B00GHH9IIA,"Its Halloween and for just one night all things evil roam among us freely.  And not just evildouchebags are out tonight, too.

Stooge (Hal Havins; Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-o-Rama, Witchtrap) and his fellow teenage delinquents are out on Halloween night harassing the elderly and looking for trouble.  Two couples (including Cathy Podewell) have the misfortune of joining these degenerates to a Halloween party thrown by the weird girl from school Angela (Mimi/Amelia Kinkade; Night of the Demons 2-3) and her sultry friend Suzanne (Scream Queen Linnea Quigley; Creepozoids, Silent Night, Deadly Night).

The party is being held in an abandoned funeral home, a haunted venue called Hull House where the family and staff were all brutally murdered. So what could possibly go wrong?

How about demonic possession?  Much as in the Evil Dead series (1981, 1987, 2013) and Demons 1-2 (1985, 1986), demonic possession is quite contagious.

This film was clearly the high point of director Kevin Tenneys (Witchboard 1-2, Pinocchios Revenge, The Cellar) career.  This cult classic has its raunchy moments, taking every opportunity to have women changing clothes on-screen, bra and panty shots, abundant boobage, Linnea Quigley offers up the longest naughty panty shot in horror history, and a LOT of sexy dancing.  Sexy demon-possessed dancing actually turns out to be a theme in this franchise.

The raunchiness is heavily complemented by the campy cheese factor permeating the writing.  The malevolent old man with his razor blades, an underground stream that runs in a circle around Hull House (because we all know streams flow in circles!) entrapping the evil spirits, lame dialogue, girl-on-girl kissing to transmit demonic possession like an STD need I go on?

The effects and gore include bitten out tongues, demonic faces with mangled demon teeth, the iconic disappearing lipstick scene, an awesomely eye-popping eye gauge, fire-scalded melty flesh, tattered demon zombies this is no one trick pony.  We enjoy a nice range of horror effects entertainment.

But as far as the plot goes, its all pretty haphazard really.  Essentially, a bunch of teenagers go to a demon-infested house, people become possessed and then either try to infect or kill those who remain.  There is no sense of story, climax, challenge or goal other than to survive and escape the house.  Our once semi-clever demons had a few tricks up their sleeve, but by the end they are senselessly reduced to a nearly mindless and tactless zombie horde, and despite being featured on the DVD cover the Angela demon is no more menacing or in charge than the others.  Although she probably won the sexy demon-possessed dance off challenge!

After the lipstick scene of course, the best scene was the lastin which a crotchety old man (from the opening scene) eats a lethal pie made from his razor-blade apples.  Cheeky and memorable.

The diversity of effects and the silliness of the growling-laughing demons continues to make this work as a cult classic while clearly offering nothing in the way of substance (or style).  Its pretty stupid.  But even more so, its pretty fun!  Highly recommended for a laugh while unwinding after your Halloween party, or as an installment to mark on your 31 Streaming Films for 31 Days Horror Calendar.",1476403200,,3310,5.121042830540037

A bunch of 30 year old teens have a party on Halloween night in a abandoned mortuary.  Demons that reside there want to get in on the fun too.  If you are looking for story or great acting move along.  A couple quick items of interest:
NOTD is one of those movies that is so brainless that it actually is pretty smart,
while never really scary it is never boring and the pacing is good,
It does get more tense as it goes along,
the camera work and set design are top notch,
it has some great quotes""eat a bowl of f***"",
a great use of a Bauhaus song,
the lipstick scene,
almost all of the special effects are good,
and the ending wall climb is pretty cool.
If anyone tells me this is the worst movie they ever seen must see Manos: the Hands of Fate immediately(and not the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version).",1436140800,,947,4.2154696132596685

  The video,audio,everything has been cleaned up and it makes a big difference,especially with a movie from the late 1980's- mostly all low light situations and you can really see what is going on.
  I haven't watched this movie in a few years but it is one of those i continue to go back to.
  Bonuses galore in this version. Almost everyone involved in this original is on the bonus tracks and it makes for a really nice one on one experience. Everyone worked very hard and had to put up with difficult conditions,make-up-hours after hours in the make up chair,etc.,etc. Inhaling blue smoke and coughing it up for months afterward. You name it! They have all earned this extra exposure!

The only problem I had with this one is on the new commentary the sounding kept going in and out you would thought they would have tested it before releasing it not that it was a bad commentary they just need to be more careful.

6075814,5,B00GHH9IIA,"Night of the Demons was one of those movies that I used to rent wayyyy back in the 80's during my high school years (back in the day when you had to ""be kind... rewind!""). Unlike most of the scads of mindless horror films that would grace my VCR, Night of the Demons is one that always stood out to me.  From the beautiful, eye-catching animated opening to the then-unconventional ending (one of the survivors/heroes is the type of person who usually would have been killed off first in most horror movies of the time), NotD impressed and entertained me.

Now granted that some of the ideas aren't exactly original or groundbreaking... group of ""kids"" -- most of them looking obviously quite a bit long in the tooth to be high schoolers -- goes to a haunted house, lots of sex and bare breasts, demonic possession, etc.  But the way in which they were presented gave them a freshness and originality.  The effects were pretty amazing considering the budget constraints.  I remember rewinding and replaying the scene with Linea Quigley and her disappearing lipstick trick about 50 times in slack-jawed amazement thinking, ""how the heck did they DO that??""  The acting was pretty perfect for the type of movie it was.  With a title like Night of the Demons, most viewers aren't expecting Shakespearean delivery, so all the actors and actresses did a great job at keeping it fun and campy.  As another reviewer smartly noted, it was a great idea to have each character who was killed off come back possessed.  Not only were they cutting down the number of protagonists, at the same time they were increasing the number of antagonists which really amped up the fear factor past the normal single-slasher-picking-off-kids-one-by-one level.

The Blu-Ray looks amazing. They did a wonderful job making sure the picture is clean and sharp... while watching it, it was almost hard to believe the movie is over 25 years old (ugh... now I feel ancient).  I haven't watched all the special features yet nor have I had a chance to listen to the audio commentaries, but the lengthy documentary on the making of the film is almost worth the price of the disks alone!  The film had such an easy, organic quality that it was really amazing to find out all the hard work, talent, and planning that went into executing it.  It made me appreciate the film even more.  The interviews are both informative and  entertaining... I was surprised to see that, with so many cast and crew members giving information and anecdotes, they were all very funny and engaging to watch.  Even at over an hour long, it never seemed tedious or drawn out.

I VERY rarely purchase movies any more because I'm not one to watch movies numerous times.  That said, Night of the Demons is one of the very few movies I enjoy watching over and over (and introducing others to as well), so I'm extremely happy with my purchase of this well-made and thorough edition.",1403827200,,2918,4.710629921259843

which only had a 14mins interview with Linniea quigly and an audio commentary

it's time to throw out the old Anchor bay release
and get this all new Scream factory blu-ray release
first of all the picture quality does look amazing in High Definition
with an all new 5.1 HD Master audio track, better than the Anchor bay dvd

2nd, there is all new making of Documentary YOU'RE INVITED goes for about 70mins
all in depth interviews with all the cast and crew from the film
Director Kevin Tenney, writer/producer Joe Augustyn
plus Linnea Quigley Cathy Podewell all the cast basically is interviewed
Steve Johnson is interviewed about his make up effects
plus a new Audio commentary with the Director and some of the Actors
which is not really a informative commentary, they mess around alot and Joke
about their experiences in the film
so i thought the commentary was pointless not worth listening to
but the Documentary is excellent
there is also a seperate interview with the Actress that plays Angela
there's still Galleries, Trailers, TV spots
plus i almost forgot this new blu-ray release is the UNRATED version
completely uncut with extra Blood and Gore and violence

so this new blu-ray from scream factory definitely is a collectors edition for sure
this release also comes with a dvd of the film which i didn't bother watching
i'm only interested in blu-ray quality these days, DVD is long gone
Definitely time for an upgrade and get this new blu-ray release by scream factory

While it's been hailed as the ultimate 80s horror film, wise choices for costuming and music have kept it fresh. According to an interview with writer-producer Joe Augustyn, he designed it to make the most of its budget. The first quarter of the movie is comedic, with sardonic dialog and sight gags. The horror is delayed, but once it starts its unrelenting, with some eye-popping effects and good jump scares, courtesy of effects master Steve Johnson and director Kevin Tenney.
