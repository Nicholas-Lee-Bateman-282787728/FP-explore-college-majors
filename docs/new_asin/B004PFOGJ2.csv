4444292,5,B004PFOGJ2,"I honestly wasn't expecting much from SIEGE OF THE DEAD (a.k.a: RAMMBOCK). I've seen all recent zombie movies, and only just recently watched DEAD SET and HORDE (both very excellent). This looked like a low budget movie with a generic plot. I was pleasantly surprised. This movie was, as it turns out, hampered by a low budget, but the director, Marvin Kren managed to put out a great production, tied together by a solid script, and anchored by an inspiring young lead actor, Michael Fuith. If you're a fan of the genre, or even want to watch a suspenseful movie, this is a good bet. This DVD was pretty good. Not much on it besides the feature, but it played fine in my USA player, and the subtitles were excellent.",1299369600,3,717,4.523076923076923

4444298,4,B004PFOGJ2,"This one has some great strong points, but alas, some weaknesses that keep it from being a 5 star flick.

It's short, only roughly an hour or so. I kind of appreciate that they didn't try to stretch it out another half hour or so to get that 'full movie feel'. It was long enough to do what needed doing and didn't try to be something it's not.

The story quickly throws you into the midst of it. There's no drawn out character development or back plot explanation, though you know enough. You're in the thick of it 3 or 5 minutes in, and it's chaotic and leaves you with a million questions. You really get sucked into what's going on with the main character and his panic and struggle to figure out what's happening become yours. This one drew me in from the start with its fast paced beginning.

The infected are truly awesome. Think 28 Days later awesome. Fast, driven and vicious, these are not your slowpoke moaning lumberers. The special effects appear somewhat minimal but they're fabulous all the same and I find these more 'minimal' zombies very well done and more effective than the infected/zombies that rely too heavily on looking scary rather than actually being scary.

The plot's decent. It held my interest throughout, which surprised me a little bit, once I figured out that most of the movie takes place in the apartment building. I mean, how much can you DO in that scenario? Enough, it turns out.

There's a simple but unexpected twist in battling the infected. While on one hand it feels somewhat like too simple a solution, on the other the simplicity's actually refreshing. Once again, much like with run time, this movie is what it is and doesn't deviate to try to be exactly what's expected in this genre.

So the bad...really, it's the main character. He's selfish and annoying at best with his constant lovesick, heartbroken behavior. At times he's like a 15 year old girl busy sulking over small potatoes in the middle of the zombie apocalypse. I liked him less and less as the movie progressed, so much so that what might have been his act of redemption really didn't sway my feelings about him. He was too unlikeable to be the hero, but not bad enough to be a villain. His Average Joe image worked at first but as time wore on, he exposed himself for the self-absorbed jerk that he was.

I didn't like him, but I did enjoy the movie as a whole. It probably won't knock your socks off if you're into all-things-zombie, but it's just different enough to deserve a watch.",1420848000,,2499,4.552338530066815

However if you enjoy a well written, directed and acted zombie movie like I do give it a chance despite the subtitles which I quickly adjusted to.
The Premise of the Movie : A man decides to surprise visit his girlfriend and try to mend their rocky relationship.
His girlfriend lives in a appartment complex that has a courtyard in the middle which is significant to the movie.
After arriving to his girlfriends appartment he finds a father and son handyman team working on her heater however she had left to run some errands.
It is while waiting people start showing up in the courtyard and attacking residents of the complex which of coarse spreads the infection and the battle is on for survival of the residents and the boyfriend who still hopes to finf his girlfriend.
The zombies are mean, ugly and fast which adds to the tension of the residents trapped inside their appartments.
I hope this rating assist anyone with questions about this movie.",1364428800,,1076,4.668421052631579
4444314,4,B004PFOGJ2,"I liked this movie, being a fan of the zombie genre.  My rating of four stars presumes that you are a fan of the horror / zombie genre and not looking for Oscar-worthy cinema.  Be warned, the movie is in German.  The movie is sub-titled and I was able to ""read"" and follow the movie with no problem but I know many folks dislike (or hate) having to ""read"" a movie.

This is not a long movie -- just over 60 minutes -- but does not feel like a ""short film"".  The movie follows Michael, who has come to Berlin in an effort to see (and re-connect) with his ex-girlfriend.  As he enters her block of apartments, he (and we) hear yelling and gunshots in the distance.  Michael finds the apartment, but his love is not there.  He is then confronted with the outbreak and ends up trapped in the apartment with a young plumber's assistant.  There is an interesting ""rear window"" dynamic between various characters trapped in their apartments but able to see and communicate with their neighbors (this block of apartments faces a central courtyard).  The characters are believable in their actions and quirks, which is not always the case for zombie movies and helps make this a superior zombie film.

From a ""technical"" perspective, this is a viral outbreak movie where the infected become white eyed, mouth frothing homicidal maniacs (a la 28 Days Later or the American version of Rec).  The zombies are ""fast shamblers"" and our heroes discover they are sensitive to light (which becomes part of the obligatory PLAN the survivors come up with to escape).

So put on your reading glasses, grab a German beer (but not so many as to slow your reading) and enjoy.",1363219200,,1652,4.597269624573379

4444317,1,B004PFOGJ2,"There were times when i thought this movie could have been saved. i really feel as if they intention of this movie was to give the viewer the hope of seeing an enjoyable film and then steal that hope away with bad acting, bad character decisions, bad plot decisions, and bad zombie weakness.

First complaint is the acting. i have never wanted to punch a main character more than i did while watching this movie. He really did complain about the weakest of topics while he sat idly as the world was collapsing around him. i watched this movie with two friends and we made fun of the main character most of the time. Just way too whiny for my taste. he prevented me from giving the movie hope at all.

Character decisions is next. the smartest and bravest guy in the whole movie, was the jacked dude who hung himself right before he turned. that should tell you something about the characters of the film. The sad pouty ex-boyfriend looking for his Ex, who dumped him along time ago, but he's still in love and sad, while being sad, and pouty, with more sad. It was such crap acting and I really felt like he should've been asking when he could feed the rabbits. (""Of Mice and Men""). the jerk sissy from across the way that shouts out ideas that he wants others to try because he's too scared. The husband that wants to off himself because of his wife, the ex gf who feels bad, but not bad enough to do anything about it. pretty much every character in the whole movie had an awful role. The handy man's helper did a pretty good job at acting though, so 1 point for him.

Poor plot decisions come from the bad character decisions. Much like the cliche falling down while running away, opening the door without checking the peep, running upstairs, or sticking with the dumb guy, this movie had the equivelant just in different form. the only person that didn't perish from their own doing was the brother and sister, and the jerk. Everyone else killed themselves for ridiculous reason and in ridiculous ways. they seriously should've put a gun in their mouths and saved me 45 minutes.

Zombie afraid of flashing lights?.... really? Haze yourself immediately.

this movie was aweful. Don't buy it or rent it and only watch it ifis the result of losing a bet.",1357171200,3,2255,4.490243902439024

4444319,4,B004PFOGJ2,"Christmastime has seen my nearest and dearest furnish me with a stack of new horror DVDs and so, I started working my way through them with 2010's Siege of the Dead, which (to my knowledge) is a first for me since I have never watched a German zombie film before.

Within the first few minutes of the film, I was worried. Worried that what I was watching would simply turn out to be a German rip-off of excellent Spanish horror REC, which was regurgitated almost scene for scene for Western audiences in Quarantine. Thankfully, my fears were allayed and Siege of the Dead proved to be considerably more realistic than many zombie films, in that these survivors don't find themselves conveniently holed up in a shopping mall, which happens to be replete with gun stores and so on; these very ordinary people are in their own homes and forced to utilise whatever they have to hand in order to keep the undead at bay.

The zombies are of the 28 Days Later ilk rather than your Romeroesque undead but due to the location of where the survivors find themselves trapped, there is a distinctly claustrophobic feel to proceedings that is missing from many other larger budget zombie affairs and the characters attempt to negotiate the flats that were once their homes and is now effectively their coffin. Also, I quite enjoyed the novel take on the infected provided by this film, something that I will not reveal and leave you to discover!

Unfortunately, the film is far too short with a running time of only 62 minutes and additionally, the cover is misleading, with an Apache helicopter launching rocket strikes on a zombie horde... a scene which never occurs in the movie! Also, I would suggest that the final line of the synopsis is not simply hyping up the movie but is clearly untrue. This film does not have ""astonishing special effects"", most definitely not a ""gorefest"" and is not ""laced with pitch-black humour"". What Siege of the Dead is though, is a competent little zombie flick with something missing from many genre films, characters that you genuinely care about their plight and are interested to see the outcome of proceedings for them. Michael Fuith and Theo Trebs work very well as the protagonists thrown together by this unforeseen zombie apocalypse and there's certainly worse ways to spend a little over an hour than by watching this!",1355356800,,2352,4.773955773955774
4444320,4,B004PFOGJ2,"This is an effective and efficient German zombie romp with affecting characters and suspenseful plotting.

To be honest, I wasn't expecting much but found myself attracted to the interesting personalities and fairly sophisticated themes.  The Berlin location adds a nice European gloss too.",1355097600,,290,5.72093023255814
4444321,5,B004PFOGJ2,"I was pleasantly surprised by this German movie, Rammbock. At first, it appeared to be another zombie film but the characters have heart and the acting is very good. Just when I think I know what's going to happen, the movie turns in a completely different direction. The movie is about a lovelorn guy returning his girlfriend's keys to her apartment when he encounters a plumber who turns into a zombie. The premise of the movie is about apartment dwellers who try to survive the zombies in claustophobic conditions. The movie has surprising insights into human nature and humanity. One thing I love about European films is that the actors look like normal people instead of Hollywoodized dolls. This is probably one of the best zombie movies I have seen. If you are a zombie fan, it is a must watch in your zombie repertiore.",1353456000,,827,4.710344827586207
4444322,3,B004PFOGJ2,"With a fairly familiar storyline, Rammbock: Berlin Undead (2010) is another viral outbreak film that features homicidal flesheaters.  Running just over an hour, the story is set primarily in an apartment building in Berlin, which has suddenly been overrun by the infected.  The movie doesn't have a large budget, but with German as the spoken language, still features some good acting performances, and decent action scenes.  Although the outbreak genre is quite saturated, Rammbock still manages to incorporate a few new wrinkles.

Michael (Michael Fuith) arrives at his girlfriend Gabi's apartment, hoping to patch up their relationship.  She isn't home, and Michael suddenly finds himself being attacked by a plumber who was working in the unit.  Along with Harper (Theo Trebs), the plumber's helper, Michael manages to evict the infected man, and lock themselves inside the apartment.  Safe for the moment, the pair peer out a window overlooking a courtyard, and see other survivors in the units on the other side.  They all watch as a group of the infected swam into the building, and attack anyone they encounter.

The survivors learn from TV new reports that there has been an outbreak, and that sedatives may be effective in slowing the effects.  One of the survivors on the other side, tells Michael that there is a supply of sedatives in the unit next to Gabi's, and offers food in return for the drugs.  In a creative move, Harper and Michael build a battering ram, and break through the wall into the adjoining apartment, but they are soon on the run from the infected.  Harper discovers that the infected have a weakness, and manages to drive the hoard from the building, and lock them outside.  The small group of survivors comes up with a bold plan, but selfishness produces tragic results, and forces them to improvise.

Shot mostly in dimly lighted locations, the film has a dull, gritty look, and dark depressing atmosphere, as the infected appear to be mostly former working class types.  The makeup effects and gore are adequate, and not overdone.  For non-speakers of German, evaluating the acting via subtitles involves some speculation, but the performances seem to be fairly well grounded in reality.

Aware of its limitations, Rammbock doesn't attempt to do too much, taking a rather simplistic approach, that is mostly effective.  Cut to the bone, the film isn't padded with unnecessary scenes, or overdramatic banter.  While not perfect, it's a tight little adventure that provides some solid scares, and down to earth performances.",1349136000,,2559,5.078947368421052

So on a regular scale this is a two star movie. It's very low budget , in fact the whole thing takes place in a apartment complex in Berlin. Now that's a small budget affair to the extreme. If you like that premise and budget constrants then you may like this. The flick is decent in some ways with some decent acting , and some fast moving infected people ala 28 days later.  However the film is a very average zombie flick and we all have seen many worse than this one. but.... the dvd looks fine though. This is a short movie , very short.

Rammbock: Berlin Undead tells the story of Michael, a guy who goes to Berlin to see his girlfriend: Gabi. Yet, when he gets there, a terrible virus starts spreading across the city turning people into mindless zombies. Thankfully, Gabi isn't home. There, he meets Harper. Together, He and Harper must face off against zombies that have surrounded the apartment building. It's going to take all the wits about them and then some to make their way out to find Gabi.

I think what disappointed me the most was the fact that the movie was way too short. Course, you can look at other reviews here and tell I'm not the only one who felt that way. Second, it isn't as gory as most zombie movies are yet that makes things more creepy and effective I suppose. Third, it doesn't try to be original. The only area where they were original was with the storyline. Everything else is pretty much typical zombie-fare. Lastly, the movie feels like it isn't complete. You know, like there's more story to be told even though the end pretty much leaves things there.

What I did like most about the movie was its' humanity. Those little moments that mirrored real life in the movie, even though this unnatural thing was happening. Touching moments.

While it isn't a complete waste of time for a zombie movie, it doesn't have alot of redeeming qualities to it that would make me want to recommend it to everyone. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie. Even though it's a lowbudgeter, you couldn't really tell. It should tide over zombie fans looking for something to sink their teeth into. Just don't expect the Earth to move with this movie. Lol, it ain't going to happen.

This movie is so typical of this latest wave of zombie films; think ""28 days later"", ""The Horde"", and ""28 weeks later"", ""The Walking Dead""tv show; yet these films far surpass Rammbock. Rammbock steals from every zombie movie, but it doesn't steal anything worth repeating. Dark, depressing, minimal dialogue, no chance whatsoever against the undead, stupid story and forgettable characters. Yawn, I gave it about 35 minutes than I wanted to take a nap. There are sooo many better zombie films out there worth watching, don't waste your time on this one. I think a lot of newer zombie movie fans think this and the walking dead are the typical fare for films like this.

I always enjoy a low budget zombie movie, as long as the script isn't left out of the budget and written on toilet paper.  What we have here is a form of Rabies, not a zombie situation.  These zombie wanna-bes can run, and they like to bite a lot.  Their weakness is bright lights.  No half skeletonized humans here, just a little blood and white contact lenses. The actors fit their roles, so no faulting the acting.  The ending does have hope for some of the characters, which I like in a zombie movie.  I like watching zombie movies when they are zombies.

Here's the scoop. A guy goes to his ex-girl's apartment to return her keys. The two are history and he's broken up about it. While in her complex, he goes to her apartment to find she's not there, but two workmen are. One goes zombie-fied and tries to kill him. The young assistant intervenes and the two find themselves in survivalist mode as the complex is overrun by more zombies.

This movie does induce some of the horror found in ""Night of the Living Dead"" along with that movie's attempts of the protagonists to survive in an enclosed space. It also aims at delving into the human side of things as depicted in ""The Walking Dead"" series. This is all done in a nice, neat little package. It's set in a multi-story complex so the shut-ins can see and communicate with each other out of windows facing each other across the courtyard. They are neighbors who know and care for each other. They're not just a faceless lot of zombie fodder. Our hero is a decent sort. He wants to get out of course, but he puts himself in harm's way to help others. He's a bit off his rocker in trying to locate his ex in the ensuing mayhem, but, other than that that, he's an Okay guy. He does find his gal but it's less than an ideal reunion. As a result, his plans for escape become more focused and realizable. The horror/ action is tight and makes sense in its own right. What happens to our hero is sad and, the final scene when he runs into his gal, is both surreal and sad. I don't believe anything like this has been done before.

This is just a nifty little flick. I'm probably a half star heavy on my rating but, at 64 minutes, fans of the genre should have a jolly good time.",1326067200,,1839,4.278735632183908
4444335,4,B004PFOGJ2,"<strong>Rammbock</strong> (Marvin Kren, 2010)

<em>Rammbock</em> runs just sixty-one minutes. This is to its credit; Kren and Hessler, both working on their first feature-length project, deliver a lean, mean flick heavy on the problem-solving skills and character interaction, but with still enough time for some stupid fun. What there isn't is a single wasted moment.

Michael (<em>Free to Leave</em>'s Michael Fuith) is a sad sack who has come back to Berlin (he lives in another city now) in order to return housekeys to his ex Gabi (Polish child actress Anna Graczyk in her first grown-up role), hoping to have one last chance to win her back. How pathetic is he? In the opening scene of the movie, he's trying out his delivery of the ""I brought your keys back"" routine on the guy he thumbed a ride from. Yeah, you know this will not end well. Just how badly it's going to turn out, though, Manni has no clue. Gabi's apartment doesn't have Gabi, but there's a plumber who's... chained to the radiator? Okay, why not? Michael thinks, and continues looking for Gabi, not realizing said plumber seems to be trying to eat him. (Think the immortal scene with Simon Pegg in the convenience store in <em>Shaun of the Dead</em>.) The plumber's assistant, Harper (<em>Die Weisse Band</em>'s Theo Trebs), is the first person to clue Michael in to the fact that something is amiss. The second clue comes when a horde of other flesh-hungry people try to find themselves a free Michael appetizer. (While the subtitle of the film in its American release is ""Berlin Undead"", I'm going with a Rage-like disease here instead, given the makeup, way of movement, etc.) At this point, with Michael and Harper trapped in Gabi's apartment, they notice a number of other survivors in other apartments, and the lot of them start sharing information by calling to one another across the courtyard. A bad idea if you've got a bunch of flesh-eaters running around, so the first part of the plan of attack: luring out the cannibals and closing off the courtyard...

Given that you've got a cast of mostly unknowns and a writer and director who have previously only worked on a handful of shorts, this is quite a good little movie, mostly straightforward action/horror/comedy, but with a few touches of the surreal thrown in for good measure (WHAT IN THE NAME OF GOD WAS WITH THE FURSUIT???). But the best thing about it, for my money, is Michael's continuing preoccupation as the movie goes on. There are flesh-eaters banging on the door clamoring to tear you limb from limb and feast on your pancreas and you're still moping about your girlfriend leaving you? That's pure comedy gold right there. *** ",1325116800,,2678,4.853391684901532
4444336,3,B004PFOGJ2,"Once Christmas has elapsed and good tidings are gone, it's only natural that our minds turn to horror cinema and, specifically, to the business of the zombie apocalypse (because you never know). As such, in the interest of self-preservation, it behooves us all to keep apprised of all zombie film releases. Case in point, RAMMBOCK BERLIN UNDEAD.

I'm always hoping to pick up new survival tips from these walking dead pictures. Sadly, RAMMBOCK offers not much fresh illumination. It's a good thing there are other more helpful, info-friendly zombie films out there, else you can pretty much kiss humanity goodbye when the zombie apocalypse falls upon us. From purely a movie buff's perspective, I suppose that you can savor the pretty decent acting and the film's focus on characterization. As ever, a zombie flick's success depends on whether the viewer can latch onto the characters and emotionally invest in them. And I appreciate the lack of stupidity exhibited by the characters. Other than that chick yelling from her window, I didn't have much occasion to roll my eyes. But it's important to keep in mind that while zombies are indeed undead, it doesn't mean that they're deaf.

The plot has an Austrian bloke named Michael traveling from Vienna to Berlin to drop in unannounced on his ex-girlfriend, Gabi, ostensibly to return her keys but, really, to see if he can rekindle that old flame. Except that he chooses to do this just as the zombie infestation was in the offing. In Gabi's cramped apartment, Michael evicts an infected plumber and horrifyingly learns that Gabi isn't home, having just stepped out for a mite, or so the young plumber's assistant, Harper, informs Michael. With zombies feverishly prowling and feasting outside, Michael and Harper find no recourse but to barricade themselves in Gabi's apartment. How it must've sucked when their sole bridge to the outside world - the television in which the networks had promised to keep viewers apprised of the epidemic - begins to show test patterns.

RAMMBOCK BERLIN UNDEAD - in German with English sub-titles - is solid if unspectacular. It clocks in at a no-nonsense 61 minutes. The survivalist story takes place in the confines of an apartment block and, unfortunately for this tiny pocket of humanity, these zombies aren't the plodding, shambling kind. This contagion is more in keeping with the rage virus from 28 DAYS LATER, and so the deceased tend to flit around like Carl friggin' Lewis. The talking heads on the idiot box are pretty pointed about warning those who get infected to stay calm as losing one's cool would propel the virus to take effect even sooner.

One nugget I did walk away with from this film: zombies may have aversion for bright lights. Survivalists all over should already be well stocked on batteries and halogen lamps. But maybe you should get an extra supply? You may not be as lucky as the cast of HAMMBOCK whose zombies demonstrate the courtesy of not being much in the film. There are occasional frenzied bursts of action as swarming infected maniacs compel the few survivors to fight their way out and scurry from room to room. But gorehounds will be disappointed by the lack of icky gore - or kill scenes, for that matter. Oh, and Michael does eventually find his ex-girlfriend Gabi. But, by then, he's lost the keys.

The DVD's bonus stuff:

- ""Zombiefication"" - tongue-in-cheek safety tips on how to survive exposure to zombies, except that this is just regurgitated material for old hands like us (00:07:04 minutes)

4444337,4,B004PFOGJ2,"If you like zombie flicks, you wade through tons of garbage for handful of good ones.  While this wasn't Zombieland or ""Dawn of the Dead"" to me, it indeed was a find.

Unlike most straight-to-dvd crap you see from the domestic production, the quality of this film is excellent all around.  It doesn't overreach either.  Most of the film takes place in this taller apartment building(reminiscent of [REC]), and it last just hair over an hour.  While the film is subtitled, I doubt even the audience generally reluctant to watch foreign film would be bothered by it.  All dialog are straight forward.

In my opinion, for hardcore zombie fans, this would be a recommended buy.  For casual fans, you might prefer to rent it first.  Personally, I think I'd buy it if I encounter it in the bargain bin, down the line.  People involved in this film pulled off a great work.

4444338,5,B004PFOGJ2,"I've now watched a German, a French, an Irish, an Australian, a New Zealand, a Hong Kong, a Thailand and a Japanese zombie film.  This, of course, in addition to the prolific Italian and Spanish genres.  And each has had its own special aura.  ""Berlin Undead"" has a dark, brooding, almost introspective feel to it.  It's very slight on action, even on suspense; but the atmosphere is almost overpowering.  There's nothing surprising about seeing a group of zombies suddenly appear from out of nowhere because it just looks and feels like the kind of place where zombies might spontaneously generate.

I didn't go to the ""Setup Menu"" because I just assumed it would be in German with English subtitles; but it wasn't, so my first viewing was in German only.  Even so, I could pretty easily follow along and enjoy the film.  I watched it a second time with English dialogue.  I had missed four crucial pieces. 1) The young man, Harper, was a plumber's helper - not the son of the main character, Michael's, girl friend Gabi, as I first thought.  2) The zombie plague was pathogenic in nature.  3) There apparently was a cure.  And 4), the use of sedatives could slow the pathogen's progress - this fourth piece of information made sense of the pills being passed around.

The best part of the movie was the ending.  It wasn't the usual ambiguous ending but rather a clear escape by the survivors.  They were in a boat rowing down what appeared at first to be a little backwater stream till the scene opened up to show the boat being rowed in a great river (presumably either the Spree or the Havel).  They were headed for a ship whose foghorn had sounded sporadically throughout the film; it was assumed that the water provided the only safe haven.  This scene, of the rowboat all alone in the water, was even more brooding and introspective than the rest of the movie.

All in all, this was probably the most unique zombie film I've ever seen. The zombies took a back seat not only to the main characters but to the environment itself.  And when the survivors planned and executed their escape, it wasn't so much to get away from the zombies as it was to seek food and a safe haven.",1319760000,,2181,4.546153846153846

C. VanDam, Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statum are not in it)! The creators and writers of Rammbock did a fantastic job of coming up with a great story and then coming up with a well thought out and written script. The actors are super great, adding believability to the movie. Film production was also top notch; great filming, lighting and editing. And the zombies, well, they were good and zombie, no slacker fx / make-up jobs in this movie. I don't know what kind of budget the production had to work with, but they did a great job with every German cent they had. The movie had a real, raw grit feel to it, not like some over blown Resident Hollywood Evil over produced and under written high gloss crap that for some reason continues to make sequels.  Dubbing was not to bad, or I got use to it, accepted it and went with it and enjoyed the zombie goodness that Rammbock delivered. And for those of you looking for ""something new to the zombie genre"" well Rammbock's got that too.... You're not dealing with your same old reanimated dead undead zombies, nope, these guys are infected and all it takes is a bit of strong emotion to set them off into full attack zombie mode. And what is really nice about the film is that they don't gore it up, the writers were intelligent enough to come up with believable and realistic dialog so the actors didn't have to act all low class and ignorant by cussing their lungs out with F bombs every breath!, and it wasn't your same old ""get your John Wayne hat on and lets all go Hollywood action hero shoot um up"" with out of nowhere military issue artillery!

Berlin Undead does have some interesting things inside of it.  The make up is pretty good, even the setting of the movie has a lot of promise to tell an interesting story.  People can move about and still have the element of danger around every corner.  The acting might have been top notch in the original film but the English dubbing is just ok at best.  Nothing really stands out as amazing.

4444346,4,B004PFOGJ2,"I rented this movie from Amazon literally by mistake. I clicked on the wrong movie and decided to watch it anyway. I like zombie movies--though the good ones are few and far between. After the decidedly disappointing French film, The Horde, I didn't expect much from this film. Well, I was pleasantly surprised.

The action takes place almost entirely in an apartment block, and this limited framework works well for the film. It's enough, what with a seeming labyrinth of stairwells, attic spaces, apartments and courtyard. The film shows what real people would do in such a situation--it's very un-Hollywood. No catchphrases and Bruce Willis-style heroics. The characters do smart things and stupid things--not due to bad writing, but because sometimes people do stupid things. It rings true.

The main character is a sort of nebbish loser, but that's okay, it provides his character with a chance to grow into a more realized man, a character arc in a zombie film. Who'da thunk?

If you are looking for massive gore, look elsewhere. The zombies in this film are not really zombies. They are more like the infected in 28 Days Later. They are violent and they bite, but there is no sign that they devour human flesh (except for said bites). The gore there is is done well. The acting is really believable. The subtitles are clearly done by someone with a command of the English language.

Michael arrives in Berlin to see his gf or ex-gf Gabi. In her apartment he finds an infected Toj Johnson type fellow who attacks. He manages to save himself along with a young man named Harper. They are in contact with other people locked in their apartments via shouting out the windows, which is not good because it attracts Olympic sprinting zombies. From the radio broadcast we find out that this is a rabies style virus and adrenaline causes the virus to go to the brain and make one a zombie. If bit, stay calm and take a sedative. (I can see NORML launching a campaign now.) The movie is about their survival and what one will do to survive.

Michael is torn between the microcosm of finding his gf and saving her forks from harm and the macrocosm of the enormity of the situation. It examines the spectrum of human emotions and what we would do when faced with a full blown viral zombie infection.

This movie also needlessly deals with ""where do we go to the bathroom"" issue. Clearly this is the German mind at work, attempting to place realism in a zombie flick.

No real explanation for the outbreak is given and they're not ""technically"" zombies but I don't really get that picky. Apparently getting agitated after a bite transforms you and taking sedatives can hold back the change for a bit.
Most of the story revolves around Michael who came to Berlin to bring some apartment keys to his ex-girlfriend Gabi who's out while a couple of plumbers are working. One of the Plumbers turns zombie and the other, a kid named Harper, along with Michael, lock themselves in the apartment. From there it's a matter of figuring out what to do next along with a few other apartment dwellers across the central courtyard. Michael is desperate to find Gabi and only seems to be thinking of her, while Harper seems a bit more ready to fight back.

4444353,5,B004PFOGJ2,"Greetings my shambling shuffling friends.

I just finished watching the German answer to zombie movies named Rammbock, aka Seige of the Dead, aka Rammbock: Berlin Undead.

Siege of the Dead was directed by Marvin Kren, and written by Benjamin Hessler, starring Sebastian Achilles, Ingrid Beerbaum and Carsten Behrendt.

Let me start by saying, that having dead, or undead in the name is not correct, these are infected people, not zombies, zombies are people who became infected, died and reanimated, in Siege of the Dead, they become infected, get upset, and adrenalin tiggers the crazed reaction, resulting in rabid, mouth foaming, running, strong, aggressive, infected.

With that out of the way, I can say that this is a really good movie. Siege of the Dead, had a good storyline, a good plot, and was able to add a new twist to the ever growing genre of zombie movies. The market has been flooded as of late with too many zom""B"" movies, and I was tickled to my rotten funny bone to be able to watch this first class movie.

The movie begins with Michael visiting his ex-girlfriend to return her keys, when at that moment the infection begins trapping him and another guy in her apartment. Everyone else who are trapped in there apartments in the same building, can only communicate by shouting at each other from their windows across a courtyard, which keeps reattracting the infected everytime things calm down. Michael escapes the apartment through a hole in the wall, and barely makes it to the building attic, when Michael stumbles upon his ex-girlfriend and the man she cheated on him with in hiding. The guy is a real prick and forces Michael onto the roof, where he takes the time to start helping other people in the complex.

Michael and company soon discover a novel way to chase away the infected safely, and are able to close the courtyard doors, giving them time to plan an escape to the harbor where boats are awaiting any survivors.

I can't say much more without giving away all the good points so it is time to give Siege of the Dead a G.R.E.A.T. Score.

-
G-ore: While there were no gut spilling scenes, the make up jobs on the infected were fantastic, 7.0

R-ealism: The way people were dealing with the situation they were handed was believable, the characters seemed like real people you could meet anywhere and they handled themseleves accordingly, 8.5

E-ntertainment: This movie had my attention the whole time, no boring parts, and is very well written, 9.0

A-ction: Normally I would list this as acting, but I covered that in realism, so I am going with action, lots of action, with great little twists thrown in, 8.75

T-hrills: as they venture through the building, I could sense the excitment building in myself, while the main characters were trying to avoid the infected, 9.0

 -

This great score averages out to 8.45! That is a fairly good score, and one of the best I have given.

Remember you can find this movie on Amazon.com, and I highly recommend adding this to your zombie movie collection.

But before I go, I would like to pose a question to you:

Would your love for your ex be strong enough to make you forget they cheated and make you want to be with them till the very end during an apocalyptic situation?

You will have to watch Siege of the Dead to find out.

Thanks for reading, and until my next post, I will be shuffling along with the lost.

4444354,4,B004PFOGJ2,"I don't know if it's a good thing or not, but it felt like this movie was a lot longer than 63 minutes.  I didn't realize it was that short until after watching the movie.  As for its length being an issue, that was standard practice in the 30s through the 50s; it helped with double features, a short, and a cartoon on the billing if movies were kept to shorter viewing times.  If it's a good movie, what difference does it make how long it is?
I am a fan of this genre and as such, I try to watch every zombie movie that comes to DVD.
I loved the DVD cover, when I saw it I just had to buy it.  Is it a fair representation of what the movie is like?  Not really.  The movie was seen less at eye level than is depicted on the cover; it's an interesting perspective to take for a zombie movie.  Most of the story takes place in confined spaces: an apartment complex with a courtyard.  The two main characters go from one confined area to another (despite what it says on the DVD case; they could neither hide nor run).  In that sense, they did a good job.  These zombies are like a pack of wolves chasing them from room to room, apartment to apartment, ever upward, into an attic then the rooftop.  How can you truly run from an infection?
This is basically a two character story involving an average lovelorn dolt named Michael and a very resourceful plumber's assistant, Harper.  It starts quietly enough, a bit of sad comedy, yells, gunshots.  The epidemic hits a plumber first then suddenly the building is full of them.  From that point on things escalate, as would be expected, as it happens in most zombie flicks.  The only difference here is the brief glimpses of humanity in confusion, neighbors conversing through open windows high above the courtyard that rapidly fills with zombies.  It's these pauses that give this movie more heart than most of its type.  The sight of Michael dressed in a bear suit, the way he gets angry when Harper tries to make weapons from forks.  ""Those are Gabi's forks!""  The expectation that things will return to normal and the forks will be needed once more.  An overwhelming sense of futility infuses this piece and yet, finally, there is a small act of hope (or desperation), that gives this movie its heart and soul.",1309996800,15,2261,4.415458937198068
4444355,4,B004PFOGJ2,"I heard about this movie months ago and waited with eager anticipation for its US release. Rammbock is the story of a group of survivors making due in Berlin during a ""Viral"" outbreak. The virus turns its victims into mindless killing machines (like zombies) that prey upon uninfected humans. Never once did the movie state that the infected were ""undead"" which was disappointing given the title of the movie. There was a palatable lack of gore and the zombie smashing/bashing I've become accustomed to in recent genre films. This movie lacked intensity, which was building during each scene and then lost at the moment of truth each time. Except for the lack of violence this was a decent Romero-esque zombie film laden with characters you could both identify and empathize with. I would like to have seen a longer movie but hey....budgetary restraints. I was thinking of adding this movie to my zombie collection and I still might but I doubt if I'll watch it with great enthusiasm.",1309996800,,984,4.863095238095238
4444356,2,B004PFOGJ2,"I am always excited about a new zombie movie, so when my fiance brought this one in to watch of course I was game.

When we first put it in it was in German, but don't worry you can change it to English. It's sort of like a Japanese movie, their mouthing doesn't fit the words perfectly, but it didn't annoy me.

There are some pretty scary scenes in this movie. Does it live up to I Am Legend or The First Resident Evil? *Sorry if I am being biased, but those are my two favorite zombie movies* Certainly not. The production of this movie is not nearly the caliber of those two (obviously, haha) and it's a bit more of a funny zombie movie. Not Shaun of the Dead funny, but bad acting funny.

The main character Michael (Michael Fuith) is looking for his ex-girlfriend Gabby. You do not know that they are exes in the beginning because of how in love, almost obsessively, he is with her. Maybe it was just the voice that was dubbed in English, but it started to annoy me how many times he said ""Gabby."" (Would make a GREAT drinking game!)

The movie is short, very short at one hour, so it get's to the action right away... which isn't a bad thing. Of course the zombies (which are less than par special effect make up wise) do have a kryptonite, which is light... what I don't understand is that they do come out in sunlight, but they do not like bright flashes...

The end is romantic, but just not enough in my opinion. When it was over my fiance and I looked at each other and thought ""that's it?"" I was a bit disappointed for the price I paid. I would suggest only if you like corny zombie movies.",1309824000,2,1603,4.208469055374593
4444357,5,B004PFOGJ2,"with so many movies that go on for far too long, i felt a little cheated at first with the 1 hour running length - wait, it's over already?
it's the model of german efficiency, nothing drags and everything is thoroughly engaging,",1309737600,,229,4.476190476190476
4444358,4,B004PFOGJ2,I won't explain too much about the movie; you just need to know that is about zombies in germany and people try to run away from these zombies! The movie is in german but you have your english subtitles option. The movie is an hour long so is really short. Does not matter that the movie was too short still the plot was really good.. You should watch it if you like movies about zombies or any virus of that kind. THANKA!!,1309651200,3,423,4.170731707317073
4444359,5,B004PFOGJ2,"This past year, the living dead have amassed their carcasses all over the world and now Germany takes up the Horror mantle with Director Marvin Kren's 'RAMMBOCK-BERLIN UNDEAD'.  Clocking in at just under 60 minutes , the film zips along rapid fire as the action takes place inside an apartment complex as this time a pandemic virus infects the brain including adrenalin stressed victims.  Michael comes to Vienna to give back keys to his girlfriend Gaby and gets sucked into a maelstrom of horror as he tries to get to her no matter the obstacles that pop up in front of him.  The script and performances are top notch and the film is not bogged down by the usual gory effects.  Kren goes for atmospheric jolts and breakneck editing for his photoplay and this film comes highly recommended for all Zombie film fans.  Vivendi Entertainment releases the film in a beautiful 1.85 transfer in German with English subtitles, a documentary on the making of the film getting an insight on the filmmakers and a humorous documentary called 'ZOMBIEFICATION'- ways to cope with the living dead in a movie theater.  The ending is beautifully poetic as the futility of survival comes full circle.",1309651200,3,1183,4.8316831683168315
4444360,5,B004PFOGJ2,"I really enjoyed this.  I'm a die hard zombie fan, which means I have sat through trash upon trash upon trash.  But I can't help it.  I have to sift though the chaff in hope for some wheat.  And if you're a die hard zombie fan, you know how rare the wheat is.

I think you will be pleasantly surprised by this too.  It's German, and since I'm a xenophile, I'm happy for anything that doesn't follow an exact Hollywood formula.  This will remind you of 28 Days/Weeks Later, but not so much as to be a waste of time.

I like the little touches foreigners put in their films.  They made the main character mostly an average guy, but also obsessive over his girlfriend.  They didn't waste money they didn't have making the film expansive, but rather kept the film close and tight and quality.

And the pace was good.  Not too much for the story it told (like Hollywood would have done), but definitely enough to keep your attention from beginning to end.",1309651200,15,950,4.365714285714286
4444361,4,B004PFOGJ2,"I watched Rammbock last night and like the last reviewer was also pleasantly surprised, as a big zombie fan, you tend to wade through a lot of average or just plain bad films...I put this on with an almost sigh of `go on then'.

At just over an hour I was impressed at how the film managed to bring the necessary elements that keeps one interested and entertained; I think this was achieved by having two main characters who were both very likable (rather than attitude filled).  Only after did I notice the lack of any real gore, but realised that it did not take away from a good amount of tension used at the right moments.

The only negative thing I would say - maybe not even negative, just observational thing...for a mass zombie outbreak these guys take it in their stride, personally id spend 3 days locked in a cupboard holding myself in tears; then again maybe they have seen all the bad zombie films I have and just sighed `come on then'.",1309392000,,949,4.411428571428571
4444362,5,B004PFOGJ2,"RAMMBOCK (aka: SIEGE OF THE DEAD) is a brilliant little ""infected-zombie"" film from Germany. At a mere 1hr in length, RAMMBOCK gets right into the action w/ a small group of survivors trapped in an apartment complex. A mysterious infection is turning those bitten into mindless, foaming-mouthed, killing machines. This movie has two major strengths going for it: 1- The characters, though in a panic, are not stupid, and come up w/ some innovative ideas in order to escape / survive. 2- There's a central theme of humanity within the carnage-filled chaos, making things more believable and heart-breaking, not just shocking. RAMMBOCK is one of the best zombie movies I've seen in a while. Fans of the genre should definitely see this one...",1303430400,31,740,5.024390243902439

8437631,3,B004PFOGJ2,"Ever have one of those days where your girlfriend dumps you followed by a zombie breakout? Well Michael is, so he has a friend drop him of at his girlfriends apartment in an attempt to get her to take him back. His girlfriend appears not to be home so he asks people in the building if they have seen her and in the process encounters his first zombie that send him fleeing with a teen boy to his girlfriends apartment. Michael is a bit on the moody whiney side and hearing him sulk does get old but we have all been there I think. The film does try out some new ideas like its possible to survive this virus is you can stay calm long enough for the body to fight it, but if you get angry or upset you become a zombie. Also this Zombies do not like the flashes on cameras so you better hope you got an old camera around. The Film is pretty standard, a few zombies running around the apartment complex and its not till the end we see larger groupings. I just felt like for being in Berlin there should have been a ton of zombies and so it did not really feel like they were in a major city sometimes. The first time I watched the English dubbing was bad and toneless and made Michael seem incredibly whiney and annoying to the point I wanted to throw him to the zombies and it made the acting feel weaker. So I watched it in German and liked it a lot better, the acting seemed fine and Michael did not seem that annoying.  I am going to rate it a 6 (average.) and ok movie but if you miss it your not really missing out on anything.",1517270400,,1531,4.069536423841059

8437634,5,B004PFOGJ2,"Many horror films treat characters as an afterthought. This film is the exception. Very intelligent script, good characters. Some nice scary bits. This is not a film to pass because it was made in German with a smaller budget. See it if you like very good horror with some touches of comedy and pathos. Can't guarantee you will like the ending - these zombie things often end on a dark note - but this film will gain a following, mark my words.",1501113600,,444,4.426829268292683
8437635,2,B004PFOGJ2,I was really looking forward to this film and high expectations usually is the reason for someone not to enjoy a movie but I don't think that's the reason. There might be minor spoilers from here on. First of all the movie takes place in maybe 2 or 3 rooms. And the shots from looking out side the belcony to the ground were so obviously blocked off areas to shot in. The shots of looking of the patio took all the realism out of the film. Not to mention how stupid people are in this film. Main example would be the. Either and sister in the building across from the main charecter. And I had a couple more problems with this film but I don't wanna give away pain points. I only recommend this film of you LOVe zombies. Other than that it's a pass.,1492041600,,749,4.172413793103448

Its a pretty standard setup, but the runtime of barely over an hour keeps things moving at a nice clip.  The characters behaved more realistically than in many movies of this type by avoiding contact with the infected at all costs.  Unlike many reviewers, I was not put off my Michaels preoccupation with his girlfriend; it seemed like a form of denial while the world fell apart around him.",1466380800,,578,4.647058823529412
