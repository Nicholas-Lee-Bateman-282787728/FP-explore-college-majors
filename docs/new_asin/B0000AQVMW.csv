1908543,5,B0000AQVMW,"MAY 2009!, U.S. DVD release! I didn't get where I am today not wanting THE FALL & RISE OF REGINALD PERRIN complete series on NTSC DVD. Greatest Episodic UK TV Comedy Series Ever! Towers Even above Fawlty Towers. May Martin Welborn find you well when this DVD set is released in America. NEVER RELEASED on home video in the United States! get it, Live it.",1232755200,2,354,4.461538461538462
1908544,5,B0000AQVMW,"Why is this brilliant comedy series, which includes Geoffrey Palmer, not available in NTSC format? For that matter, why is it available only at a price approaching a barrel of crude oil?  This witty satire is about a man who decides to get away from the rat-race only to have the rat-race discover his whereabouts and join him in his escape.

Please, O DVD Powers-That-Be, grace us impoverished NTSC viewers who must pay in dollars, with Reginald Perrin at a price less than a tank of gas!!!",1214352000,4,491,4.632183908045977
1908545,5,B0000AQVMW,"Extremely funny, smart satire. The comedic delivery (both verbal and non-verbal) and timing are perfect. David Warwick is nothing short of brilliant, with his smirky exasperation and sardonic commentary (both out loud and within his own mind) with regards to his circumstances and the people around him. But don't allow the latter to give you the impression that this is just another sharp-edged satire. The characters are all very likable, despite their lunacy, and Reginald Perrin himself, in the end, has an indomitable spirit. The title of the program says it all. The supporting cast - a bizarre variety of eccentrics -  is also superb. Rise and Fall is at least on par with Monty Python and other great British comedy (or any comedy, for that matter). Highly recommended.",1189036800,3,777,5.023255813953488
1908546,5,B0000AQVMW,"I got my used copy from Amazon's UK site for around 25 pounds, which is about

$50.00 US dollars. If you prefer new, they have those for about 32 pounds which

is around $64.00 US dollars. The international shipping is only a few dollars,

and over all you'll pay about half of what they want for this here in the US!!

Afterall, whether you buy it in the US or the UK and save half the money, they

are both region 2 coded. Go online and find out if there is a code to hack the

dvd player that you currently own like I did, set it for region ""0"" and you're

golden! If you can't, then invest in a cheap one that you can hack or buy one

here at Amazon that's ""0"" or region free. It's worth it in the long run because

you can get these British dvds much cheaper from Amazon UK.",1178755200,17,779,3.9423076923076925
1908547,5,B0000AQVMW,"If you are of a certain Gen X age that grew up dreaming of the next britcom import being served up by your friendly local PBS station, then you certainly remember the indomitable Perrin.  The story of a man fed up with daily life and corporate idiocy, driting off into the ridiculous and dangerous world of his own daydreams.  Yes, at first, he ""falls"" into the trap of following those dreams, but he will ""rise"" again to find anew that which matters. Sounds sappy; but I assure you it is not.  It is biting, fast-paced, straight to the gut satire for the modern age.  You will see all the precursors of current greats, including The Office.  It is a heritage classic in every respect.",1176595200,7,685,4.491935483870968

Revmoving random bits because of how SOMEONE might PERCEIVE them is assinine. It destroys the work and would leave someone scratching their head who never saw the original.

Amazon - please implore the providers of this show for a competely uncensored version.  In fact, if there is a ""Director's Cut"" I would love that.

1908560,5,B0000AQVMW,One of the first British sitcoms I ever watch from the late 70's. The best thing about buying the DVD is you get to watch the series in order from beginning to end. Something you'll never see on PBS.,1381536000,2,199,4.128205128205129
1908561,3,B0000AQVMW,"I won't comment on the groundbreaking nature of this series -- which others have adequately covered -- nor the censorship in Season Three -- also elsewhere discussed.  What I would like to bring up is the strange region coding I encountered.

Discs 1, 2 & 3 (containing the series) are all region 1 (or 0, not sure) but the 4th disc, with the extras on it, is region 2.  It plays the introductory logo then shuts itself off.  Luckily I recently provisioned myself with a region-free player so I was able to pop the disc into the other machine and watch the goodies, but I found this more than a trifle odd.",1381104000,4,606,4.383928571428571
1908562,5,B0000AQVMW,I saw this on TV years ago.  It is one of the funniest series I have ever seen. and I am not a big fan of British comedy except Monty Python and Faulty Towers.  This is even better than Faulty towers.  Not as good as The Holy Grail.  But then nothing is. The thing is you really have to watch it. not just be in the room like US TV.

1908565,5,B0000AQVMW,"I quit watching the series during its initial third-year run.  The premise was changed and obviously the writers had run out of ideas.

Never mind. The first two years are worth the purchase.

As for the PC cuts, as described I don't recall having seen them in the original.  I will make clear that I consider any cutting for the purpose of Political Correctness is abominable, but that won't spoil my enjoyment of the DVDs.  My failure to recollect saves me there.  (Cuts for timing purposes are to be expected.)

No one could ever rival Rossiter as Perrin, and the rest of the cast is superb: a rare and highly original combination.

The only BBC series I enjoyed as much (I prorogue the marvelous mysteries, of course) was ""Good Neighbors"" with the toothsome Felicity Kendall and a wonderfully dopey Richard Briars.  The latter series mentioned was a whole 'nother smoke, however, so there is really no competition or contradiction here.

Few individuals, I think, realize that Rossiter was a such a versital actor: a delicious villain in Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"" and a fine King John in the BBC Shakespeare series.",1377129600,,1118,4.836842105263158
1908566,5,B0000AQVMW,"This is very funny mainly because of the brilliant acting of Rossiter. If you stand back and consider the story objectively, it is very unlikely, but you don't do that because his brilliance carries you along.

1908567,5,B0000AQVMW,This was a series for the ages. It expressed middle-age malaise in the most hilarious way.

I have watched some of the episodes and so far I find it as entertaining as I remembered.  While some parts of it may have been edited for political correctness, I don't remember enough from my prior viewing to personally know for certain.  I do know it's as quirky and interesting to me as I remember.  It really made an impression on me all those years ago.

If someone has seen it before, or is a fan of British comedy programs, I think it is a good set to own and enjoy watching. I know I am very pleased with it!",1326412800,,680,4.044776119402985
1908577,1,B0000AQVMW,"The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin was simply the most inspired, profound, brilliantly written, and painfully truthful series ever to find its way onto television.  This was something rare...TV for smart people!  Chaucer would have loved this, and Shakespeare would have stolen plots from it.

I happened to have been in London and saw Leonard Rossiter on stage in Loot a few nights before he died (during a performance.)  He was a great actor, and in PERRIN was supported by a brilliant cast.  The humor cut to the core of society's hypocrisy unlike any other show, before, or since, and was a weekly beacon of hope for the jaded cynics whose senses of values were daily buffeted by this maddening world.

So what does the modern day Inquisition do?  It's been PC  sanitized for our protection.

END CENSORSHIP!  DON'T BUY THIS.  DEMAND the original in its full anti-social glory.",1307318400,79,883,4.82
1908578,5,B0000AQVMW,"The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin is one of those pricelessly absurd British comedies, in a vein similar to Fawlty Towers. Reggie is going through what we would call a mid-life crisis and desperately wants out. He's in a dead-end job, he's constantly late to work (""22 minute delay at Thurston due to goats on the track."" He constantly thinks of his mother-in-law as a hippo and has lust in his heart for his secretary, even though his wife is loving and wise. He finally goes off the deep end and the more he tries to fail, the more successful he becomes. The second series, centered around his ""Grot"" shops is just fall-off-the-couch hilarious. Highly recommended if Absolutely Fabulous, Fawlty Towers, Are You Being Served, and Vicar of Dilby are your cup of tea.",1306281600,2,769,4.703703703703703
1908579,4,B0000AQVMW,"I didn't get where I am today by writing DVD reviews, but here is my DVD review (after only seeing the first DVD).  Loved it.  Laughed every time I saw the hippo.

1908588,4,B0000AQVMW,"There was a time when American Public Television was called ""Educational Television"" and a staple of their offering included shows like ""The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin.""  (Let's put ""Dad's Army, The Good Neighbors"" and ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" in there, as well.)  Like most British situation comedies, it's best to ""make friends"" with this series by watching an episode, or two, sequentially then reviewing the whole thing to catch what you missed the first time.  (a la' ""The Big Lewbowski."")  Each character is strong and don't be surprised if you find yourself saying things like ""I didn't get where I am today by...."" or ""I'm not a (insert whatever you want here) person."" or, even, ""A bit of a cockup on the (insert an activity here) front.""  Then, watch for the blank stares that follow from those that just don't ""get it.""

You'll find nearly the complete series here, the only scenes missing are those that might be considered racist, using our 21st Century sensitivities.  (And also the reason for four stars instead of five).

Get it, let yourself get into the story and the characters but don't expect those you love to ""get it"" like you do.",1267574400,6,1165,4.79
1908589,5,B0000AQVMW,"I remember seeing this show in my 20s, when it was first broadcast in America. At the time, it was hysterically funny, but nothing more than that to a young man who couldn't imagine growing older. Some 30+ years later, it's just as funny, but its satiric sting hits a lot more closely to home!

Reginald Perrin is an Everyman, working at a mid-level Everyjob, with a loving but complacent wife, living an decent but ordinary life. Except that he's reached the point where he's begun to wonder, ""Is this all there is? Did I work so hard just for this?""  He's clearly headed for a breakdown ... and we watch it unfold in all its absurdity & underlying despair, episode by episode. Poor Reggie is smart enough to realize how utterly banal & meaningless his life has become; but while he can't simply give in to it, he doesn't know how to break out of it, either. Which means he slowly, inexorably begins to crumble from within.

When he does break out, it's with manic intensity, following a crazy scheme that seems quite logical & sensible to him. But can he really escape that life & leave it behind? The answer to that question is ironic & ruefully funny, but it's not that far removed from ""No Exit.""

I don't want to make it all sound too heavy, though! Before all else, this is a comedy, and it certainly delivers the laughs. But as with all good comedy, there's more to it -- the repeated catchphrases are not only good jokes, but they reinforce the endless repetition that is Reggie's day-to-day life. Always the same jokes, always the same people, playing out their familiar roles without variation ... you'll laugh, but you'll also recognize its essential & harsh truth.

The essence of the series is in its first season. As previous reviewers have mentioned, there is a bit of falling off in the subsequent seasons, although they aren't without a fair share of humor as well. But that first season alone makes the entire set worth 5 stars, and well worth buying -- highly recommended!",1266796800,,1992,4.584269662921348

1908591,5,B0000AQVMW,"Finally! The BBC has brought us hitherto deprived NTSC viewers ""The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin,"" one of the most imaginative British comedies of all time (and if this statement be hyperbole, well, Tough City, Arizona!). In addition, the Beeb (May it continue to flourish!) has also provided us with legible subtitles so that we can fully appreciate every benighted word uttered by the inspired Leonard Rossiter and his delightfully daffy supporting cast, which includes a young(ish) Geoffrey Palmer for whom time had not yet gone by entirely.

It is difficult to believe that the series was first launched in 1976, since the theme of man's alienation from the increasing complexities (and banalities) of an industrialized and mercenary society seems as valid today.

The first two years of the series are so brilliant that they merit the five stars that I have given it. However, the criticisms leveled by other reviewers are true: material has indeed been cut from the series; not merely scenes, but whole episodes. I definitely recall what must have been the sequel to the third year (shown on PBS years ago), in which Reggie again does a flit and escapes this time to a small town where no one knows him, and, one-by-one, the usual suspects join him. In this series, as I recall, the catch-phrase ""[Whatever] City, Arizona"" was caught by every one of the characters, including Geoffrey Palmer, whose deadpan addition of ""Arizona"" to expressions such as ""Panic City"" was so funny that similar catch-phrases entered into my own vocabulary, much to the bewilderment of my friends who had not seen the show. As disappointed as I was not to re-experience these episodes, I was nonetheless gratified to know that I had not imagined that something was definitely missing!

The aforementioned criticisms notwithstanding, seasons one and two will leave you laughing beyond the edge of tears. They are so good that they compensate for any shortcomings of omission or commission on the part of the BBC, to whom we should be thankful for bringing us Reggie Perrin in any form.

Well worth the price of laughing gas!",1255046400,11,2112,4.9576271186440675
1908592,4,B0000AQVMW,"This is NOT a complete series.  I have an unabridged copy of season three.  It is about nine minutes longer than season three on this set.  Four of the episodes run under 30 minutes and are complete.  Three of them run over 30 minutes, and scenes were cut out to shorten the total time.  Some very funny bits have been scrapped. Moreover, the story would have better continuity if the purchase of the neighboring houses were shown.

I have seasons one and two on VHS tape, but haven't compared them to the dvd yet.  If memory serves me right, there's another scene with Reggie's cat, which is missing from this set.  But I could be wrong.  When I find the time, I'll check.",1254009600,20,673,4.40650406504065
1908593,5,B0000AQVMW,"Odds are if you are reaading this review, you are a fan of the series. Over the years I've thought about these episodes and how smart they are more times than I can count. I was moved by the show's ""truths"" decades ago and my only concern, as with other older pieces, was if in viewing it today, it might be dated. Did its biting wit survive the years? Absolutely. If you are considering buying this set, do it, you won't be disappointed. It was like welcoming an old friend back home.

The workplace is often so disheartening and dehumanizing -- which is perfectly portrayed in this series. Capitalizing on the absurdity of life by breaking free from the corporate world and creating the GROT shops which sell nothing of any use to anyone, is so smart and life-affirming. The sameness of the corporate world, the usual set of characters, like the pompous ignorant boss, the yes-men, etc., and the numerous ways in which employees, on a daily basis, are humiliated and have the life sucked out of them, is dead-on accurate.

But, what really sets this series apart is the title character's attempt to break from the lemmings. Watching his success, and happiness at his independence is joyful, yet temporary. Eventually, as the GROT shops expand in number and popularity, he realizes he has created the same corporate environment he was attempting to escape. It is the realization that no matter how unique an idea and its execution, once the business reaches a certain size it morphs into the corporate model. But he refuses to give up. He is determined to keep shaking things up -- a human spirit at its best. This is an individual who, in mid-life, decides to have a re-birth, and reinvent himself in order to live a happy meaningful life. This is simply a brilliant series.

I ordered a used set listed on this page but was sent the earlier Region 2 version without the extras. I note this because I cannot speak to that part of the package. I don't like edited movies and I certainly don't want an ignorantly censored US version of a very special British TV comedy. Am I happy?  I am delighted even though I can only play this set through my laptop. The quality is excellent -- not at all grainy and the sound is clear.",1253059200,7,2223,4.577889447236181

What is particularly galling about this censorship, is that the portions removed were making fun of the types of people who would flee a neighborhood just because somebody ""different"" moved in.

Leonard Rossiter's performance as Reggie is so funny and yet you feel his tension and frustration and you delight in his bizarre ways of trying to bring change to his situation.

1908603,5,B0000AQVMW,"I am relieved. Whenever you get a chance to revisit an old TV series or movie, you hope that it lives up to your fondest recollections. I remember ""The Fall and Rise"" from the 1970s as one of the most original and funniest things I'd ever seen on TV. Now, thirty years later, it finally arrives on DVD for American viewers, and we have an opportunity to check our realities.

The series is often compared to ""Fawlty Towers,"" but aside from it coming from the same decade of British TV comedy, this comparison isn't fair, really -- ""Fawlty"" was then and probably still is today the greatest TV comedy series of all time. You could write a PhD dissertation on ""Fawlty,"" and I'd wager someone already has.

The writing isn't quite as sturdy and consistent as ""Fawlty,"" and some of the humor is dated, a bit broader than we might have remembered it, and also particular to British events and individuals of the period. In that respect, the series has not worn as well as ""Fawlty."" But ""Fall and Rise"" takes an entirely different approach to its troubled central character. Where ""Fawlty"" is episodic, ""Fall and Rise"" was based on a novel, which gives the story a more conventional arc -- a beginning, middle and end, as we all learned in high school English. Without giving too much away to those who haven't seen the series, it's the story that wins us over in the end.

Much has also been said about the comedic genius of Leonard Rossiter, which doesn't need to be repeated. Also no need to compare Rossiter to John Cleese -- they are both stratospheric -- and much of the reason to watch ""Fall and Rise"" is to see Rossiter at his best, navigating the endless agonies of our hero, Reginald Iolanthe Perrin (initials RIP, which I haven't seen mentioned before).

So I am relieved. This series is still very funny, very original, and essential viewing for any fan of the darker side of British comedy.",1242604800,7,1897,4.587020648967552

1908606,5,B0000AQVMW,"Reginald Perrin is a middle-aged man in a bland job who has a bland existence, a boss who speaks in slogans, a marriage that has seemed to have lost its spark, and a grown daughter whose husband is unbearable company. He also finds himself constantly daydreaming about his attractive young secretary.

Unlike Al Bundy of ""Married With Children"", though, Reggy does not plan to suffer in silence. Instead, he plans and executes an escape. He fakes his own death and assumes that his new life will be full of fun and adventure. However, with no references since he essentially has no past after his ""resurrection"", he finds he can only get a job as an assistant to a pig farmer. Also, he finds himself missing and drawn back to his wife/widow.

The comedy is quite British. If you don't appreciate that kind of humor you won't like this series, but it seems quite relevant even though it was made over 30 years ago. It pokes fun at what and who society finds valuable and why, and the scenes of Reggy talking things over at night with his cat are hilarious.

There is one big difference between Al Bundy and John Cleese's Mr. Fawlty though - Reggy Perrin really does love his wife and she loves him. Their tenderness and fondness for one another shines through regardless of what else happens. I haven't seen this show aired in America for about 25 years, and then it was only shown on PBS as far as I know. It will be great to have it in a form where I can see the whole series over a short time frame rather than just one episode every Sunday night.

Word of warning: For some people, this show takes a bit of getting used to.  Trust me, it is funnier every time you watch it (due, I suppose, to the fact that you begin to anticipate the funny lines).  You need to invest a little time getting to know the characters.

I think my favorite scene is in the third season when Reggie goes out looking for C.J. and finds him panhandling on the streets of London.  No, wait a minute.  I think it is the scene in which Reggie attempts to sack Seamus Finnegan.  Oh, I can't decide.  You'd better buy the set and figure it out for yourself.",1236556800,17,939,4.12707182320442
1908615,5,B0000AQVMW,"I first saw TFARORP many years ago when the Dallas PBS affiliate KERA imported it, and it is completely on par with ""Fawlty Towers"" and ""Ab Fab"" as far as comedic worthiness while breaking through traditional sitcom barriers.

Reginald Perrin (as portrayed by Leonard Rossiter) is  a middle-aged, middle manager at a London-area dessert factory who couldn't be more dissatisfied with the banality of day-to-day life. So he comes up with a plan to end it all (without really ending it all).

Rossiter is genius and the rest of the casting couldn't be more spot-on -- these are characters that will stay with you always (and that you'll probably recognize from your own lives).

And if you think ""Saturday Night Live"" is a catch-phrase factory, wait 'til you catch yourself trying to work the cleverness of Reggie and company into your conversations!

Like ""The Office,"" they tried to ""American-ize"" this program in 1983; unlike ""The Office,"" it failed.

1908617,5,B0000AQVMW,"And yet...  I'm doing one anyway, based on the television series and NOT the quality of the DVD set (which at this point is unknown).  However, we can make some good guesses here and guesses which are at least valuable in deciding whether or not you'll be interested in this.

First of all, this is as English a series as it comes.  Absolutely no attempt is made to ""Americanize"" it, so if you have trouble understanding English accents (and even *I* do at times) or dislike the English sense of humor then stay well aware from this.

Otherwise, this is a *superb* show, equally on par with Fawlty Towers as one of the best the English has to offer. It's sharp satire but not ""crazy"" in the Monty Python sense.  Reginald is a man who gets fed up with the middle class rut he's living in, and fakes his own death to get away from it all -- except he can't get away from it all and no matter how he tries to fail he keeps succeeding even more.  It stars the late Leonard Rossiter who is absolutely brilliant in this -- actually, the entire cast is superb.

The show is a hidden treasure -- here in the States there were two VHS tapes released fifteen years ago which covered only the first half of the series (the ""fall"" of Reginald).  Then you could buy a PAL set of this (assuming you had the ability to play it) but that's gone out of stock as well.  This NTSC DVD set looks to be the entire show and worth every penny.
