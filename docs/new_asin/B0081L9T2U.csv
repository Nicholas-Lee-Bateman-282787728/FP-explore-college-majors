5118449,5,B0081L9T2U,"My son LOVES this series! I'm sorry the series has come to an end. We have all the DVDs and my kid watches his favorite episodes over and over.  I wish they'd take some of the jobs and create a kids' nonfiction set of books. My son learned so much from the show - the different dirty jobs, of course, but also about the different parts of America, appreciating where food / products come from and that people are proud to do a hard day's work.",1370476800,,443,4.151162790697675

5118453,5,B0081L9T2U,"As it turns out this will be a last season collection of Dirty Jobs. Sadly after 50 states , it is suddenly over. Hopefully we will see Mike in future shows on TV as his talent is  going to be missed terribly by his fans .",1354924800,3,222,3.8260869565217392
5118454,5,B0081L9T2U,"Have always loved the show 'Dirty Jobs' and was hoping that I could order each season, which I found here on amazon.  Not only was I able to order each season, but I received them within 3 days and in top condition.  I have ordered from Amazon time and time again and never been disappointed.",1354752000,,292,4.290909090909091

5118460,5,B0081L9T2U,"Still love Mikes humour but this disc isn't really""  Dirty Jobs ""  it's a must do disc with very few Dirty Jobs left to do I guess. Prefer the earlier stuff that was down right dirty !",1425340800,,184,3.945945945945946

5118465,4,B0081L9T2U,It's fun and educational. Mike Rowe is a great host and puts a humorous spin on the dirty jobs he does across the country. It also reminds me of how good I have it with my job.,1390435200,,176,3.7837837837837838

5118467,5,B0081L9T2U,"Dirty jobs is great,  discovery sucks for cancelling it.  This IS and was a great great show,  showing the everyday man working for his money,  instead of all the stuffy crappy managers and banker types who don't work for a living.  It was a good run,  I wish they would have done more.",1375660800,2,286,4.30188679245283

8523994,5,B0081L9T2U,"""Dirty Jobs"" is a brilliantly simple concept, but Mike Rowe and his crew go beyond any reasonable person's expectations in their quest to get dirty. As with the other installments in the series, ""Dirty Jobs Collection 8"" is a sublime combination of muck, mess, mirth, and mayhem as Mike undertakes some truly unappealing occupations. I will say that ""Blueberry Connoisseur"" is probably the least dirty job ever seen on the show (though the harvesting technique is backbreaking and startlingly unautomated), but some of these are downright gruesome, notably the epic and infamous ""Bug Detective"" episode which finds Mike exploring a pig carcass in a dumpster among other horrors. If you don't like bugs, you will also be a bit squeamish during ""Hair Fairy"", which definitely demonstrates the proper way to wield a louse comb. For sheer horror, ""Custom Meat Processor"" made my list (and is definitely not one for the kids), while ""Sponge Diver"" had all sorts of ways to go wrong. One of my favorite episodes is ""Jellybean Creator"" which isn't terribly dirty, but definitely stinks due to flavors like ""Skunk Spray"" and ""Rotten Eggs"". This is a great selection of ""Dirty Jobs"" episodes and I recommend it highly.",1481241600,,1209,5.05

8523997,5,B0081L9T2U,"Just love Mike Rowe.  Hours and hours of great entertainment.  My 8 year old watches the DVD over and over. Likes to be grossed out. I'm hoping that by exposing her to some of the jobs Mike Rowe is willing to do she will have a better appreciation for people who do the dirty work to make her life easier.  Plus hopefully she won't be afraid to ""get her hands dirty"" she already is brave enough to bait her own hooks when fishing. Did Mike Rowe inspire her? hmmm",1467936000,,462,4.168539325842697
