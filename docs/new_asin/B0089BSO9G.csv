8526259,5,B0089BSO9G,"The most noteworthy aspect of this film for me was my discovery of Herbert Marshall. For my taste he's the perfect leading man. Smart both in brains and looks and a consummate actor. He played his part as the doctor with depth pulling off a mix of scalliwag/devoted friend /counselor/a guy who has seen too much in life.

Stanwyck is admirable as the ambitious business-climber who makes a name for herself while nursing a broken heart. And what a mother she makes! There is pathos in her eyes, and an honest affection toward the little boy who turns out to be her son. The child actor Johnny Russell is simply adorable. An unassuming, natural talent who might have gone far. However according to IMDb he apparently made no movies after 1940. What happened to him?

Cesar Romero is incredible as the spoiled gentry/annoying as heck sagacious sidekick. He offered another bit of comic relief in a film that has at its heart a serious theme. The storyline of AG would play out completely differently if set in contemporary times yet the script is progressive. And very funny in parts. And intelligent. And touching, too.

The ending is worth waiting for. And depending on how you view things will either make you cheer or shed a tear. Or perhaps a little of both.

This film now ranks as one of my favorites.",1497312000,,1306,4.640692640692641

8526262,3,B0089BSO9G,"In 1937, Barbara Stanwyck starred in ""Stella Dallas"", a blockbuster weepy which contains one of her finest performances. Stanwyck had a deal with 20th Century Fox at the time and had been on suspension for a long period, refusing unsuitable scripts. ""Always Goodbye"" was an attempt to cash in on ""Stella Dallas"".  Another mother love yarn, but lacking the direction and script of Dallas, the merits are beautiful photography, sets and costumes but the film moves from one incredulity to the next, all managed by Stanwyck's warm playing but undermined by the inanity of the script. Herbert Marshall has an unbelievable part but his rapport with Stanwyck is palpable. The film has the compulsory ghastly child actor.

The film has been released in the Fox Cinema Archives Series which means it is expensive and spartan.  However, the print is very good and if you like Stanwyck, you will want to see the  film.",1455926400,,908,4.915032679738562

8526266,5,B0089BSO9G,"The DVD is one of those special order made by demand DVDs but at least it isn't a bootleg.  FOr years, that's all that was available for this rare Stanwyck film made in 1938.  The transfer quality is excellent!!  The film would probably qualify as a 20th Century Fox programmer for the period.  Stanwyck is stunningly photographed and wears a gorgeous wardrobe. She is her usual sincere self although the script isn't much of a challenge for her.  She plays a woman whose fiancee is killed on his way to marry her.  She is pregnant with his child and she has to give the child up for adoption with the help of Herbert Marshall in an insipid role.  Years later, she becomes a successful fashion buyer and in Paris happens upon a little boy and develops a sweet attachment for him before finding out that he is her child.

I won't reveal anymore of the plot for the sake of spoiler activity.  However, Stanwyck makes the film worthwhile and will disappoint none of her admirers.  This film is worth a look if you are a Stanwyck fan and have not seen it.  Again, the DVD transfer is beautiful and clear but has no chapter/scene selection, no subtitles and no trailer.  Just the movie.",1347235200,32,1181,4.492957746478873
