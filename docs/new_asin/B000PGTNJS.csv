8191231,5,B000PGTNJS,"The French have a way with over-the-top comedies. Slapstick abounds, and gross-outs - but it is warm-hearted at the same time. I've seen the PAL version only, so I hope that the American release was not too bowdlerized. The French, unlike us PC Americans, don't censor sex or nudity. Friends who have watched this film with me find it ""laugh out loud"" funny. It bears repeated viewing, and remains extremely funny. This may eventually become a cult classic if enough people pick up on it.",1254528000,,488,4.752941176470588
