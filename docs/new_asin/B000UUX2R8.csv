Super Show, The complete collection of The Legend of Zelda, The collection of Super Mario Bros. 3, and the collection set of the first two seasons of Captain N. This set looks to be the finale of these cartoons including the third and final season of Captain N as well as the few Super Mario World cartoons they made. I really enjoyed all of these and if you have the others mentioned above it'd be great to add this final one to your collection. (There may be others but I think this is it as far as I can remember) I have one or two episodes of the third season of Captain N taped on VHS but it kind of slipped by fast so if you missed it like me that's a must! Super Mario World introduced Yoshi and the Cave people to the screen as well as the Chargin' Chucks so I know any Mario/Nintendo fan will enjoy it.",1192665600,8,857,4.047058823529412
2925433,5,B000UUX2R8,What good then just bringing something from the past to show to the kids. They may not understand that this show old but its injoyable. Mario bro shows have life lessions that teaches kids about something. Remines me old GI joe shows in 80s after the show ends lol.,1317168000,,265,4.428571428571429
2925434,5,B000UUX2R8,"This is my son's latest, favorite thing to watch.  I personally loved captain N when I was growing up.  It was one of my favorite all-time cartoons.  I already had seasons 1 and 2 of captain N but I had completely forgotten about this show until I saw it on amazon.  The only problem is that now, while I can enjoy the show on an every-once-in-a-while basis, my son has fallen in love with these cartoons and I have to see them every other day... AAAAAARGH!  Well I guess that's the price you pay.  I understand my dad much better now!!!  Still it's worth the love and my boy enjoys them every bit as much as I did when I was growing up.",1305590400,,637,4.130081300813008
2925435,4,B000UUX2R8,"As a collector myself, I could not look past this spectacular DVD. Not only did it have the complete The New Super Mario World series, but it also has the last season of Captian N: The Game Master. If you have never watched either of these series, this DVD may not be right for you. The cartoons are not as well done as others in their time. But if you are a fan of Mario or a longtime fan of the series, this DVD is right up your alley.",1286582400,,437,3.9213483146067416
2925436,3,B000UUX2R8,"I bought this dvd set just to have the complete Super Mario World series in english. The cartoon falls in the same category as the super show or the Zelda cartoon, where it can be perceived as being so bad it's good. Peach is not at her best in this one. I like that she has the red hair, but something about the way she is drawn makes her not very attractive.

Captain N was really a bonus for me, although I find the show terrible no matter how you look at it. But if you grew up when both of these cartoons were on saturday morning in the early 90's - which is right in my time frame but I didn't know about it - this dvd set is worth it to relive any of you memories of the 90's you may have.",1285113600,3,696,3.8333333333333335
2925437,4,B000UUX2R8,"Personally I bought this dvd for the Super Mario World cartoons. I have searched high and low at stores like Walmart and Target but no result...

Anyway I found it online, and I'm pleased. I have to fight over my little sister in order to watch it! I didn't care for Captain N as a kid (I barely remebered that show.) but I remeber watching Super Mario World from the early 90s to the late 90s.  I cried when it was taken off television...but I started to watch Pokemon(but not as cool) and thats ANOTHER STORY.

The show is the same I remebered and very funny(the writers got their sense of humor back from Super Mario3)look for jokes about PBS, the stupidity of the cave people, and etc.

I could care less for Captain N but Super Mario World is a blast!

Now if they could release Earthworm Jim on dvd. :D",1265068800,,808,4.2894736842105265
2925438,2,B000UUX2R8,"I am a fan of the old Nintendo cartoons, but these are the bottom of the barrel.  I would be happier NOT seeing some of this.

Seriously, season three of original (G1) ""Transformers"" cartoon was better...and THAT wasn't good.",1257292800,,225,4.743589743589744
2925439,5,B000UUX2R8,"the final and best nintendo inspired show now on dvd a must buy for any fan of either or both shows!! my young nieces having super mario world for the gameboy absolutely love the mario world cartoons. their only wish is that there more episodes which is sad that there was only 13 that were ever made and sadly only 7 episodes of captain n season 3. i think the mario's have even overtook my niece's fav show spongebob so definitely buy this set, if not for yourself, the kids will just fall in love with it the same as those of us who got to witness these shows in all their sat morning cartoon glory!!",1245801600,2,603,4.206896551724138
2925440,5,B000UUX2R8,"superb collection for the video game collector or someone who likes the nostalgia of an era gone but NEVER forgotten. Keep the past alive with this shining gem!

5 stars, my highest recommendation!

Nostalgia, history, video game memories!",1232668800,,239,5.2631578947368425
2925441,4,B000UUX2R8,"To start off, if you're buying this product, you are either a really big fan of Nintendo or buying it for a child. Whatever your reason, this is a great DVD for both. Keep in mind that it was made some time ago, but regardless, it has all the familiar characters and sounds of the Mario Franchise that is sure to entertain both young and old.",1199664000,,342,4.196969696969697
2925442,5,B000UUX2R8,"Captain N and the New Super Mario World is the best way to round off any possible collection for video game cartooning.  First, these two shows were far apart. Then, they were back-to-back with new seasons.  Now, they are side by side with their very own 30 minute show.  It's the last 7 eps of Captain N: The game master and 13 episodes showcasing the adventure in Super Mario World.  What I really like about this set is the ability to...wait for it....watch the episodes completely separate of each other.  You can watch both, or just Captain N or Mario World episodes.  Alas, there aren't many menu choices as their predecessors, but, the collection itself is more than enough to satiate your appetite.  So, whether you're a fan of Captain N, Mario, or both, get this series!",1197936000,7,779,4.642335766423358

8214980,3,B000UUX2R8,"Liked the Captain N episodes on this box-set. Liked the fact that you could you choose what series to watch.
Super Mario World was a little to much for children for my taste.
Captain N was a nostalgic throwback though.",1444953600,,218,4.475
8214981,5,B000UUX2R8,Great old show glad to have purchased this item. In great condition. Very very happy with this cartoon. A great Item,1402012800,,116,4.571428571428571
8214982,5,B000UUX2R8,"I was happy to find this set, it made a great gift. This series is kind of rare in my opinion so I was happy to have found it hanging out on amazon for a decent price. Shipped fast, packaged well, arrived in time for Christmas. :D",1390003200,,230,3.9148936170212765
8214983,5,B000UUX2R8,I'm glad that I got this set for myself. Now I have the whole set for two series shows that I've been looking for probably the last five years. I'm so happy right now.,1374278400,,167,3.9411764705882355

8214985,5,B000UUX2R8,Talk about bringing back memories! Used to watch the show every morning. This one contains season three of Captain N and a bunch of Super Mario Bros episodes.,1370304000,,158,4.678571428571429
8214986,5,B000UUX2R8,an awsome ending to a great series even though its actually two series in one still a great collection glad i bought it,1368748800,,119,4.217391304347826
8214987,5,B000UUX2R8,i saw this when i was a kid it reminds me of playing nintendo games and supermario world it comes to life on dvd,1362614400,,112,3.7083333333333335
8214988,3,B000UUX2R8,"UPDATE 2/27/18: For the longest time, I was frustrated with this show. But now, I'm becoming reasonable and understanding with every aspects with this show. The first two shows, ""Super Mario Bros. Super Show"" and ""The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3"", were done at Sei Young Animation in South Korea, and this show, ""Super Mario World"", was done at Pacific Rams Production in China. Unlike the first two shows, ""Super Mario World"" is more geared towards tots 3-8 years olds due to the lack of plot, which was set up due to the whole ""United States Federal Communications Commissions enacted the Children's Television Act"" thing back when ""The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3"" aired in 1990. The animation is not as bad looking, but not one of the best. For the record, I'd rather watch this than to watch the live action adaptations of the Disney classics, which sickens me with the darker plot. Your preschool kids may love this, but anyone older, such as almost going to middle school and onward, are so advised to have something else to watch.",1321056000,,1050,4.743169398907104
