He demonstrates strategies and provides simple, yet effective drills to help you. One thing that was missing is that the description says you will learn how to analyze fighting styles. I was looking forward do that section. However, it isn't in this DVD! I thought I missed it, so I watched the DVD again--it is not covered. On the packaging it says the DVD is 30 minutes. It's actually 81 minutes. Overall, a valuable DVD on a very important aspect of fighting.",1324252800,,564,4.707070707070707
8052008,5,B0007UZN3M,"even if you think you know sparring, you should see this video. Although some of the items are obvious to those of us who have been training a while, there are a few points that will make you think ""hm. am i myself doing something wrong sometimes?""

rather than making the whole hour and a half repetitive drills, he shows you techniques that you should then, on your own, go and practice and become familiar with. this i always a good policy in any martial art!

don't expect to be babied through it though. i believe that mr lewis expects you to know something about whatever art you happen to be in. it definitely merits more than one watching, too.",1210464000,2,652,4.425
