7875644,3,6304483090,"I have not seen this edition, but I have the VHS version. The music on that is so important to the story, that I can't imagine a version without it.  I was planning to replace mine with a DVD, but after learning there was no soundtrack I will not do it.  I am sad about this as Elinor Faire is my cousin and this movie is part of my family history.  My VHS still works fine and I treasure it.  I watch it maybe once a year. I give the movie 5 stars, but have to reduce that due to the incompleteness of it without the music.",1487548800,,524,3.869158878504673

7875647,5,6304483090,First leading role by William Boyd and a good Cecil B DeMille movie too.  I give it a 5 star rating -- William Boyd is my all time favorite actor.  What can I say!!,1435795200,,164,3.7941176470588234
7875648,1,6304483090,"First off, The Volga Boatman is one of my favorite silent movies.  If you've never seen it, then you MUST see it, at some point in time - it is that good - but be prepared, if you decide to order THIS version of The Volga Boatman (""manufacture on demand"" DVD-R)...  I have this film on VHS, and have waited all these years for it to FINALLY come out on DVD.  When I saw it listed on Amazon.com, I jumped at the chance of getting the DVD, and ordered it right away.  The day it arrived, I immediately popped it into my DVD player, and it started up... silent.  And, I mean SILENT(!)...  I skipped ahead, and it was STILL silent...  No sound at all...  Yes, the movie is a ""silent movie"" - but there's supposed to be music playing in the background (it's there on the VHS version I have)...  There is no musical score - none...  The VHS copy I have has a beautiful soundtrack to play underneath the silent movie... Even one of the reviews here on Amazon mentions music (piano) - but the copy I received has nothing.  It is COMPLETELY silent.  I returned it, knowing full well someone must not have connected the audio link when making this DVD copy (as it's a ""manufacture on demand"" DVD), but the replacement copy I received  is also without any sound at all - it is COMPLETELY silent.  This is not the way to see this movie. Silent Era Films on Home Video lists this movie, describes this movie (MENTIONING THE SOUNDTRACK as being ""canned music"" - but it DOES say there's music!), shows a photo of the cover (same as the one Amazon shows), and even provides a link to Amazon.com, where someone can purchase the DVD.  I tried twice - original order, and the replacement order - and both times... failure.  Too bad, too - because this truly is a great movie.  I guess I'll have to keep waiting 'til someone actually restores it, and re-releases it on DVD.",1424044800,2,1853,4.355685131195335
7875649,3,6304483090,"Cecil B. DeMille is heralded as one of the finest motion picture directors of all time. His silent work is cherished by fans of the era, and his penchant for historical material is put to work here. The Volga Boatman is about a slave (William Boyd) whose revolutionary thoughts are in direct contrast to his current lifestyle. When he sees princess Vera (Elinor Fair) with her betrothed (Victor Varconi), he is disgusted by their wealth and snobbery. Soon, the disgruntled masses rise against the aristocracy, leaving bodies and bloodshed along their trail. The slave, however, finds himself lusting for the princess, and steals her away from the angry mob to save her life, putting his own at risk in the process.

There are a few interesting scenes, including the transition of the slave from a revolution leader to a lovestruck traitor. Unfortunately, though, the action is altogether too slow. I found myself dozing off, and to get through the film, I fast forwarded it (slow enough to see the movie and read the titles, of course). DeMille was known for sweeping epics, but the best parts of this film are the relationships between the characters, not the sets or the social implications.",1248912000,,1193,4.905940594059406
7875650,5,6304483090,"Famous for his lavish spectacles, director Cecil B DeMille does not disappoint us with ""The Volga Boatman"", even though it was filmed at the Sacramento River instead of the Volga in Russia.  This 2-hour epic has most of the usual DeMille hallmarks which have become synonymous with the word ""Hollywood"": visually stunning with just the right balance of drama, passion, romance, suspense and excitement.  ""The Volga Boatman"" is essentially a love story about two people from opposite ends of society, shown starkly in the setting of the Russian Revolution which saw the poor peasant revolt against the rich aristocrats.  The Volga boatman, a poor laborer, becomes a leader of the peasant revolt in the Red Army, while his love, Princess Vera from the royal and rich class, is engaged to an officer of the White Army.  Although the spotlight is always on the love story and main characters, I found there were a few good points brought out about this conflict between the two groups which gave more depth to the whole film.  The intertitles are short, easy and often marvellously poignant, and the levels of suspense and excitement rise and fall several times throughout the story as we follow the unlikely lovers through dangers from both sides of the Revolution.  Perfect picture quality, great acting and a good piano score from original cue sheets and with a touch of Russian flavour add even more to this excellent film which any DeMille or Classic Hollywood fan would surely enjoy.",1099872000,4,1485,4.943775100401607
7875651,4,6304483090,"Even in his early days, DeMille was a technological wizard who applied the  credo ""more is better"" to his movies. In his silent epic, The  Volga Boatman, he certainly employed all the cinematic devices available to  him to paint a picture of the Bolshevik revolution, not so much on a  sweeping political scale, as on a personal level, that of a peasant and a  princess.
The imagery in this movie is DeMille at his most visually  expressive:  the Volga boatmen, the human mules of Russia, in their rags  contrasting with the richly dressed aristocrats, particularly Princess Vera  whose gowns were designed by Adrian; the clock in the background inexorably  ticking away the minutes of Vera's life as she plays the brave aristocrat,  defying Feodor, the steely-eyed boatman/Bolshevik leader, not to love her;  and the grand ballroom scene where the cream of Russian society dances  while Mother Russia convulses in political upheaval.
Imagery conveys  meaning in silent movies more so than the dialog, however, the dialog in  The Volga Boatman is studded with acerbic lines emphasizing the disparity  between classes and adding to the overall atmosphere of cultural  inequality. Unfortunately, we only read one of the best lines of dialog  ever written. Despite the fact that Bill Boyd's (Feodor's) rich baritone  voice was a generous mixture of northern Oklahoma and north Hollywood  accents, I enjoy imagining what he could have done with the line:  ""We've waited 500 years for freedom, you can wait five minutes to  die.""
As a devoted fan of the movies, particularly movies having  some historical content, The Volga Boatman remains a highly appealing and  ""watchable"" film for me because it focuses on timeless human  relationships and not the stale political tracts which can be supplanted.  In addition, DeMille's technical craftsmanship is most ably demonstrated in  the beautiful composition of each scene. Mr. DeMille went on to direct  Technicolor extravaganza's but this hand-tinted, silent classic is one that  stands out as an example of DeMille at his cinematic best.",965520000,7,2081,5.2024169184290034
