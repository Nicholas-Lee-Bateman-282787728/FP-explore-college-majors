1407938,4,B000059PF0,"This production moved me when it first aired, and I was not disappointed when I bought the DVD.  I remember thinking back in 1982 that some performances/songs were fantastic, others less so.  This holds true today: Eileen Brennan is heart-wrenching as the millworker, as is her song; Rita Moreno is perfection as the waitress, with another great song; Beth Howland may not have been the perfect choice for the housewife, but the song is so good it doesn't matter; and who can resist Edie McClurg as the hotel switchboard operator?

Overall, this production has much to commend it - the closing number chokes me up every time I see it.  It may not be perfect, but let's be glad it was done!",1101686400,5,689,4.622950819672131
1407939,4,B000059PF0,"The story of my life? So begins one of the most underratd musicals ever. With a simple message, ""Everyone has a story."" This is a TV adaptation of a musical based on a book by Sociologist and pundit Studs Terkel available by the grace of God for the first time on DVD. I knew the play from high school and was anxious to see it on film. It's a fairly reliable adaptation of the play, except that it omits two very fine songs and is kind of simply set up (it was PBS after all).
For those unfamiliar with the book or the musical, Working is based on a series of interviews Terkel performed with people from all walks of life. The book was subtitled ""People Talking About What They Do All Day And How They Feel About What They Do."" Composer and Lyricist Stephen Schwartz (with help from the likes of James Taylor and Craig Carnelia) adapted the interviews (which were verbatim from these peoples' mouths) into a musical.
Now let me adress a common concern right here. ""I don't like musicals."" Something like that is simply impossible to say. It's like saying ""I don't like soup."" You can't. There are too many different kinds of musicals (indeed soups) to say that you hate them all. Do you hate bright and sunny musicals like ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" or lavish dance numbers like ""42nd Street"" or quasi-historic grandeur like ""Camelot?"" In Working the musical performances are limited to singing at the camera, or singing off camera.
And the singing is performed by some wonderful people. ""Rocky Horror's"" Barry Bostwick as the Steelworker, Scatman Crothers as a Parking Lot Attendant called ""Lovin' Al: The Wizard,"" ""West Side Story's"" Rita Moreno as a Waitress who feels like an artist, Charles Durning as a retiree, Patti LaBelle as a Cleaning Woman and James Taylor (mentioned above) as a Trucker. Highlights include Bostwick's stirring ballad ""Fathers and Sons"" Moreno's ""It's an Art"" and the highly affecting ""Me and My Machine"" performed by an unseen vocalist during the Millworker scene.
People who do these jobs, might be inspired by these completely true stories. And people who interact with these people might be inspired as well. Inspired to spend a few brain cells thinking about the guy who put his car together, talking to the telephone operator who's been having a hard day, showing respect for the cleaning woman, you even see hookers in a new light.
""Hey somebody, don't you want to hear the story of my life?""",1034640000,24,2426,4.710588235294118
1407940,2,B000059PF0,"...- the production is flat & lacking in energy (especially in the chorus numbers ""See That Building"" & ""I Hear America Singing/All the Livelong Day"") and sets look cheap.  And some of the actors are miscast or can't sing very well.  It would have been much better filmed in performance with an audience instead of an empty studio.
I happen to have done this musical & like it, but this is just an OK production.  Fans of the show will want to buy it as it's the only ""movie"" version available.
There are standout performances - Barbara Hershey as a vulnerable hooker, Eileen Brennan as an exhausted millworker, Edie McClurg as a perky operator, Charles ""Hill St Blues"" Haid as the mischievous ""gas man,"" Charles Durning as a retiree, and James Taylor adds a nice touch as he sings something he actually wrote for the show (""Brother Trucker"").
But there are also annoying, jarring or boring performances, like Beth Howland as the housewife & Didi ""Grease"" Conn as a receptionist - both of them breathy & nasal.
Some actors push it too hard - seems like most were cast because they were the ""hot A list"" for the moment (i.e. the late 70s) which makes the show a little dated.  It would have been better casting some unknowns (but great singers from Broadway).  So ""Where Are They Now?"" - Eileen Brennan?  Barbara Barrie?  Beth Howland?  Didi Conn?  Matt Landers?  Vernee Watson-Johnson?
Good thing they didn't make an album of this soundtrack - its thin singing & orchestrations pale in comparison to the original cast album of 1978, which has much better singers (like Bob Gunton & David Patrick Kelley) and there's more excitement, feeling & fullness in the songs.
Interesting note:  Lynne Thigpen (cast as receptionist) & David Patrick Kelley (playing an activist Copyboy complaining about his capitalist newspaper) are the only ones from the original Broadway cast to make it into this broadcast, originally shown on PBS ~1982.  On Broadway, Kelly sang the soaring ballad ""The Mason,"" which very unfortunately was cut from this version.  Pigpen sang ""Cleaning Women.""",1030060800,11,2070,4.88
1407941,5,B000059PF0,"First off, the reason that they are all ""staring at the camera"" is because this is filmed in a documentary style.  As if all of the people are being interviewed about their lives and jobs.
Great performances by an all-star cast.  Eileen Brennan (""Clue,"" ""Murder by Death"") gives a WONDERFUL performance, but unfortunately does not sing her character's ""Millwork"" song herself.  Patti LaBelle sings the [...] out of her ""Cleaning Women"" song, but does not seem all that emotionally involved in the proceedings.  Barry Bostwick gives a touching and brilliant performance, delivering a heart-wrending rendition of ""Fathers and Sons.""  Rita Moreno stops the show, and other wonderful performances given by all.
The sets are rather like ""Sesame Street for adults,"" but I personally find it to be very affective and theatrical.  Semi-realism with some flat, 2-dimensional pieces thrown in there for you to remember that this is--after all--a theatrical piece (despite all of the realism in the documentary-style acting and film-making).
All in all, this is a BEAUTIFUL piece.  A show about REAL human beings, telling their lives and stories in a non-linear way.  Few musicals about real people are out there (only Sondheim's and Kander & Ebb's pieces, as well as I DO! I DO!, FIDDLER ON THE ROOF, and RAGTIME come to mind), but those that are are very affective and are truely quite moving.
However, my one MAJOR let down: Craig Carneila's beautiful song ""The Mason"" is not in this film.",1024790400,11,1481,5.040983606557377
1407942,2,B000059PF0,"This PBS production for American Playhouse is basically just a filmed version of the songs and monologues that make up the Broadway musical WORKING.  Unfortunately, the film lacks most of the energy or the excitement of the live version.  There are still some wonderful performances, most notably Rita Moreno as the Waitress singing ""It's An Art"", Eileen Brennan as the tired factory worker, Barbara Hershey as the prostitute, Patti Labelle as the cleaning woman and Barry Bostwick as the steelworker singing ""Fathers & Sons"".  Overall, the acting is stronger than the singing (except for in Labelle's case,where the opposite is true) and the actors, while well cast, are not helped by awkward transitions and poor directing.
The big cast musical numbers that open and close the show are totally lacking in energy, mostly due to the fact that they are stagnant (no musical staging), probably because the director didn't know how to film movement.
This is only interesting for those who want to have a record of the material (songs and monologues) that comprise the show.
It would be nice if someone were to film a stage production of this show and edit it properly.  That would make for a much more interesting viewing.",1018483200,6,1219,4.96078431372549
1407943,3,B000059PF0,"First let me say that I am a big fan of much of the show WORKING. Still, making Studs Terkel's book into a big, Broadway show was a mistake, as these stories are small and intimate. I remember watching this production on PBS in my youth, and I looked forward to the release of the DVD. I found most of this production unwatchable, or watchable only as a curiosity. Many of the monologues are played straight to the camera in a very self-concious way. Several of the ""locations"" are visibly low-budget and take away from the text. The big exception is Eileen Brennan and the ""Millworker"" segment, which is brilliantly realized. Somehow she found a different way of communicating with the camera that is unselfconcious and natural. It is great that this DVD exists as a document of the show, but it easy to see why the Broadway show failed. The group numbers have an artificial ""upbeat"" quality (especially the ""See That Building"" finale) that seems to contradict the flavor of most of the interviews that Mr. Terkel collected. It is fun to see many favorite performers back in their younger days, especially Barry Bostwick. Overall, this DVD is of interest to collectors and people who work in the theater, but many sections were difficult for me to sit through.",1015027200,3,1261,4.736363636363636
1407944,5,B000059PF0,"This video is an American Playhouse production first presented on PBS in the early eighties. It was adapted from the 1978 Broadway musical, which in turn was adapted from Studs Turkel's book of interviews with the American worker. I actually saw the original stage production while it was in previews on Broadway -- a Saturday afternoon matinee. My seat was in the balcony almost at the end of the row on the right side. A couple of empty seats away there was a gentleman wearing a wrinkled trench coat; halfway through the show I finally realized he was actually Studs Turkel. I worked up the nerve to ask him to sign my program, and was waiting for a break in the action to ask him to do so. Unfortunately, he used that break to get up and go backstage. Never did get his autograph
Stephen Schwartz adapted his original Broadway script  for this video production and added Studs Turkel as a narrator. The premise of the show is simple -- it's about real people telling  Mr. Turkel and us what they do for a living and what they like or dislike about their work. Their stories are told here both in words and songs. And since the songs were created by six very talented people the music and lyrics  cover a wide variety of styles while developing and explaining each the character singing them. That's a lesson most of today's new Broadway composers could learn.
While the original Broadway production used a very creative unit set with the characters and their career props moving on and off stage;  the video opts for more realistic job sites and locations for each character. This is an acceptible alternative, but not nearly as creative or exciting.
But then this is a show about people, and that is where it stands out! The entire cast is outstanding and it would be unfair to single out just one performance. Just look at the cast list and remember they were at the peak of their careers when this show was recorded. Expect the best, because that is what you'll get -- Broadway at its best!
One final note, I was a young man in the prime of my working career when I first saw this show. Today I am an early retiree. This time around I can emotionally relate and identify with the story of JOE.
Order this video now, it will be worth the wait to get it!",997401600,11,2259,4.4624697336561745

7933843,4,B000059PF0,"I saw this show when it originally aired but remembered it being better than it is. It's not bad, but if you're looking for a great production of ""Working"" seek out a theatre company doing the original version, not the updated one. It's not bad, and some of the performances are really quite good, but as a whole, it doesn't ""speak"" to me the way the stage version did. Not sure if it's because it was produced for television as a TV show, with ""real people"" being interviewed by Studs, of if it's the 1980's slickness, but rather than just sharing these stories/vignettes, they've tried to telegraph how the viewer should feel.

7933845,1,B000059PF0,"I can never understand why so many film versions of musicals are cast with people who can't sing.  With the exception of Rita Moreno and Patti LaBelle, this movie version is performed by people whose singing voices are painful to listen to.  Even James Taylor is disappointing.  Granted, the majority of the cast is made up of a lot of gifted and recognizable character actors, but it's a musical!  News Flash:  There will be singing involved!!!!

I had always wanted to see this musical, but as far as I know it has never been performed professionally in my area, so I was really excited when I learned there was a film version.  I just finished watching it, and my ears are practically bleeding!  I paid around $20 for it, which was about $19 too much.  Now I see that the price has gone up to over $40!  Anyone who shells out that kind of money for this amateurish and painful production will certainly regret it.  One of the most disappointing musical adaptations I have ever seen.
