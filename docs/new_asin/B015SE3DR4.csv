8734533,3,B015SE3DR4,"A schooner roams the sea with a huge, hidden gun looking for German submarines to sink. The captain falls in love with a beautiful blonde who turns out to be a German spy. This film is directed by John Ford, which is a plus, but the acting is subpar. There is some action at sea and also some intrigue in port, but this is an average film which you can skip without missing much.",1522540800,,379,4.135135135135135
