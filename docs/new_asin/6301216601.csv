The spare, elegant, aristocratic Sir John Gielgud is equally wrong for the vulgar and self indulgent Wolsey.

320091,5,6301216601,"This version of the Thomas More story, with Charlton Heston as More, is exceptional.  I've seen the Paul Scofield version and actually found the Heston film to be better all around.  Heston is seen in a role that is unlike most if not all of his previous work.  Possibly the closest role to this was his role as General Gordon in Khartoum.  Heston brings a great deal of passion to the role - one has no trouble understanding his torment as he tries to serve both his conscience and his King.  Vanessa Redgrave gives another steller performance as More's wife.  The lessor roles are all played to perfection.  The character of Cromwell is interesting as he sees that there are risks to bringing down More which could impact him as well.  The character of Rich is likewise played exceptionally well.  We see Rich on the slippery slope of compromise as he works with Rich to bring down More, in the name of the King.  I feel that the characters are more developed in this version of the story.  Also, the technique of having a chorus, in this case Everyman, works quite well as a bridge between different time settings.  In several cases Everyman mentions dates which gives you a sense of how long and drawn out this whole episode in the history of England was - several years.  Giving a bit of time line helps with understanding the background of the story.  I higly recommend this film  to those with an interest in English history.",1408492800,3,1432,4.56078431372549

continued to watch it I was very much drawn into the story and the overall production. The one thing I did not
like was the acting job for Henry VIII, which was totally lacking in subtlety. But Charlton Heston is really very,
very good as Thomas More. The language of the script seems to fit his acting style well. I liked this film much
more than the Paul Scofield version, which I found rather boring. Also I enjoyed seeing a more direct adaptation
of Robert Bolt's play. This production clarifies the moral stance of More and speaks powerfully to the issues of
human moral courage in the face of autocracy and corrupt power structures. In this sense it is very relevant to
today's social and political reality.",1375660800,4,825,4.543624161073826

320122,5,6301216601,"As mentioned, this is not the screen play that was adapted for the 1966 film starring Paul Scofield, but rather a filmed version of the original stage play by Robert Bolt.  Of course much material overlaps, but it is a distinctly different approach and performance.  This is NOT a video of a thetrical performance, but a fully realized 'film' performance, simply using the theatrical script as screen play.  The most noticeable difference is, of course, the presence of The Common Man (admirably executed by Roy Kinnear), a character which is cut in the 1966 film adaptation and replaced by individual actors playing the host of characters The Common Man covers in the play.  John Gielgud is given an upper billing, and he is of course an excellent--if more slender than one would expect-- Cardinal Wolsey.  His Wolsey is not as menacing as Orson Welles' Wolsey in the '66 movie, but none-the-less is clearly a determined, pragmatic, Machiavellian bureaucrat who makes it clear he will brook no resistance from Sir Thomas More, or anyone else.  But these are Gielgud's only few moments on the screen (Wolsey's ""Fall"" is not depicted in the play, as it was in the earlier film, but only mentioned in passing later).  Vanessa Redgrave returns to the script, this time as Lady Alice More, Thomas' wife (she appeared briefly in the non-speaking role of Anne Boleyn in the '66 film; Mistress Boleyn is never actually seen in the play) and she is by turns humorous, fierce, tragic and always convincing.
For me, the most pleasant surprise was Charleton Heston-- an accomplished actor, whose unfortunate late-in-life attachments to 'campier' film projects and far-right politics caused him to be dismissed as a significant talent by many.  However his abilities are fully shown here.  The performance is subtle, elegant, and powerful.  He takes a different approach than Scofield, as one would expect, and it works to the character's and story line's advantage (I take nothing from Sir Paul; he is the Definitive Man for All Seasons, of course).  Scofield plays the noble, determined martyr who won't give in; Heston is more unconvinced of his ability to face what he knows must happen and musters his courage through the certainty that he is right to stand up for what he believes in.  Both are convincingly saddened when they realize the lengths that former friends will go to in order to achieve their ends.
If you are already a fan of this play and the 1966 movie, this is highly recommended.  If you are just getting to know it, stil highly recommended.  The theatrical purist may find it more to his or her liking than the 1966 film version.",1369958400,6,2640,4.876957494407159

320125,4,6301216601,"I remember having seen this when it first ran on Television in 1988 and was instantly captivated by it. I never thought much of Charlton Heston save for ""The Omega Man"", ""Soylent Green"", ""Planet of the Apes"" and ""Touch of Evil' (despite the horrid Mexican make-up).  But in all else, including ""Ben Hur"", he always portrayed a wooden sense of movement.  In this version (truer to the stage version by Robert Bolt)he still can't from time to time shake his woodenness but he plays a vivid, passionate, very much alive More. The More portrayed by Paul Scofield was to me, an emotionless, calculating mental machine.  But Heston truly breathes life into the role and gives you a man, full of blood and fire. A man you can relate to. This is what captivated me.  By today's standards the movie seems to run a little slow but one does stick with it.  I waited many score years for this come out on dvd and was not disappointed by the passage of years or the veneer of memory.  It may not be as fresh as the day I first saw it on TV but it is still, to me, a sterling production and a side of Charlton Heston's acting ability that few of us ever got to see.  If you can't stand Charlton Heston, you probably won't like him in this movie either. But if you don't like him give the movie a whirl and I think your opinions might be altered somewhat.

320157,5,6301216601,"Man for All Seasons is a fantastic play and turned into a great movie.
I much prefer the Charlton Heston version. For one thing, he keeps the all important narrator, the everyman figure, the one who represents most of humanity.
Heston does a good job in making Thomas More not only a lawyer, an intellectual and saint but also a very human, witty man. He loves life but when his principles come into conflict with the wishes of Henry VIII of England he follows those principles to the very end of his life. Wish we had more like him today.
The acting is uniformly good, nay outstanding. Heston has been accused of being stiff and grandiose - not in this movie. His portrayal is very human, down to earth. The rest of the cast is also very, very good. Can't go wrong with Vanessa Redgrave, Sir John Gielgud and Richard Johnson.",1318032000,12,826,4.47682119205298

320160,3,6301216601,"While I agree that Heston wasn't as good a fit for More as Scofield, one thing I did like about this version was its fidelity to the full play.  The original cinematic version strayed from it, especially from the device of having Matthew/the Common Man play multiple roles throughout.

I also found that some of the other characters were better developed here:  Henry VIII demonstrated more of the desire for More's approval than Shaw's performance; Cromwell was much more conniving and shrewd; Rich was more weak and duplicitous even than Hurt's portrayal.",1194393600,17,557,5.032608695652174
320161,5,6301216601,"I think most of the comments for this film are rather unfair. Unfair to the actor Charlton Heston and unfair to the film itself. Please let me explain:

It seems to me a sort of ""England, England!"" thing is standing in the way of a fair and objective comment on this film.

To do away with the 1988 version of Heston as a failed attempt to improve on Fred Zinneman is not only an unfair comparison but also a foolish one.
To begin with: Heston's version is far closer and more true to Robert Bolt's play than is the Fred Zinneman version. In addition, Heston's performance, although more obviously dramatical than that of Scofield, is more passionate. The scene in which he thrashes Roper and stands for his daughter Meg is simply the greatest (""They put about too nimbly!!!""), as is his performance with the Duke of Norfolk when they discuss water spaniels.
Next to Heston, the performance of his fellow actors should not be discarded.

Roy Kinnear, bless his soul, is brilliant as the common man (a Robert Bolt invention that stayed alive in this version but was left out of the 1966 Zinneman production)

In addition, the role of the king is played simply brilliantly by Martin Chamberlain. The scene in More's garden is an unrivalled scene.

Vanessa Redgrave gives one of her finest performances as More's wife. The scene in the Tower where they part for the last time is always tearing me apart! (Oh God, all these plain simple men!)

And of course the roles of the ""two ugly ladies"" Benjamin Withrow and Jonathan Hackett are delicious and not to be found anywhere so great in the 1966 Zinneman version.

So I beg you: Please be fair, enjoy the Zinneman version, but also take the time to appreciate Heston's version!

320162,4,6301216601,"I love this story, as a fragment of history (such as we know of it), as a dramatic work by a fine playwright and in both extant film productions.  The 1966 film directed by Zinnemann is a wonderful filmic reworking of the play with some noble acting and art direction.  It retains the essence of the story whilst changing 'operatically' the angle, rather like Milos Forman has done with Peter Schaffer's ""Amadeus"".  Heston's TV film, on the other hand, sticks rather more closely to the play, in both script and format and succeeds equally well.  This isn't a 'remake'; rather, it is a new approach in its own right.  Both films are valid additions to the canon.  Heston was, indeed, a great actor who was more than equal to this task; all too often he has been the target of 'casting snobs'.  Finally, the late Roy Kinnear's contribution as the 'Common Man' (a part not featured as such in the 1966 film, Colin Blakely as More's servant, Matthew being the closest comparable) is a little gem!",1144540800,46,993,4.607954545454546
320163,2,6301216601,"If you were expecting something similar to the Oscar-winning 'Man for All Seasons' starring Paul Scofield, Orson Welles and co., you will not find it here.  Sometimes remakes can be wonderful, and sometimes they can add a fresh interpretation to time-honoured themes and stories; alas, such is not the case here.

Charleton Heston is woefully mis-cast as the principled and intelligent Thomas More; Heston is a very good actor, and has done such a range of characters that it is not that I see a Moses or Michelangelo here - it just doesn't work.  I freely confess that it may be that the Scofield performance is too much locked in my consciousness, but then again, I am one who usually likes remakes...

Another element here is Sir John Gielgud, who is one of my favourite actors by far.  Unfortunately, he just doesn't have enough screen-time or involvement in the overall plot to save this piece.  Vanessa Redgrave as Lady Alice is also another terrific actor mis-cast; Redgrave's stunning performances in film and on stage (I've been fortunate to see her in several West End productions) have something that isn't present here.

The minor casting of important figures like Richard Rich, Henry VIII and Cranmer also pale so far from the original film casting that the less said here, the better.

I give one star for reasonable sets and production values, and a second star for having the presence of mind to recall this wonderful Bolt play and screenplay and try to revive it for a new generation of viewers.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't work here.",1130025600,18,1555,4.837735849056604
320164,1,6301216601,"Okay, let's step back a moment and review what we have here.  The original of this movie was named Best Picture and it's lead actor, Paul Scofield, was named best actor.  The original is heralded as one of the best movies ever made.  In short, the original comes about as close to perfection as a movie can.

So why even attempt a remake?  What is to be gained?  A better question might be, ""what is to be lost?""

Much!  This remake doesn't even come remotely close to what was achieved by the original.  A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS, the remake, is a movie that had no business being made.

Charlton Heston as Thomas More? Not a patch to Scofield's performance. In fact as Chuck's performance continued, I found myself whispering to myself the lines from a far better Heston acting effort, THE AGONY AND THE ECSTASY, ""When will you make an end, Michelangelo?"" Heston's performance here was pure agony! John Gielgud, as Cardinal Wolsey, can't even begin to touch the hem of the robes worn by Orson Welles who defined and mastered this role in the original.  And it's incredibly bizarre, as well, that Vanessa Redgrave, who cameoed nicely the part of Anne Boleyn in the original, wouldn't know better about assuming the role of Lady Alice More and falling considerable short of the original performance of Wendy Hiller.

The rest of the cast is equally miscast as they attempt to fill shoes of veritable ""Who's Who"" of British and American Cinema, shoes so big that none of them had a chance from the beginning.  But, again, how do you compete with or remake a movie that was perfect to begin with?

Don't waste your time with this flop.  The original is still with us and available on DVD and here's hoping it ever will be!

7810251,4,6301216601,"Bolt's play ""A Man for All Seasons"" is a thought-provoking work that is well worth seeing.  As you probably know, there was a great movie version made in the 1960s and starring Paul Scofield.  This one from the 1980s starring Charlton Heston is also very good.  Heston was also the director.  This version feels more like a play than the older one; one of the actors plays several parts and speaks to the audience on occasion.  I personally prefer the older version because Scofield was a superb actor with a great speaking voice and was well cast in the role.  But this one is also very good.  Heston was a very good actor, he is also well cast, and I suspect that he strongly agreed personally with the message of Bolt's play, and this commitment comes across in his performance.  The great John Gielgud plays the small role of Cardinal Wolsey.  More's wife is played by Vanessa Redgrave.  Her performance sticks with me; it's a very different, much earthier, interpretation of the role than Wendy Hiller took in the Scofield film.  So if you already know and like the Scofield film, by all means see this one.  It is an interesting  contrast.

7810256,3,6301216601,"First, I'm not sure why ""Verified Purchase"" is not listed with this review, as I definitely bought this DVD from Amazon.  Anyway:

I've been a fan of the 1966 movie but was highly intrigued by this production with some excellent actors, so I bought it. This 1988 film reflects a somewhat different approach to the material (even though playwright Robert Bolton wrote the screenplays for both movies). In a nutshell, I found the 1966 version more riveting and entertaining, except for several features of the 1988 version that were definitely better:

 Benjamin Whitrow does far, far more with the character of Thomas Cromwell than Leo McKern does in the 1966 version. Don't get me wrong. Leo McKern is a great character actor, but Whitrow (who is of course famous for playing Mr. Bennett in ""the"" definitive ""Pride and Prejudice"") is just DELIGHTFUL (!) to watch as the cunning, duplicitous Cromwell. Every scene he is in energizes this movie, not just dramatically (for example, a brief amazing vignette with a candle) but also comedically (some very amusing repartee with other characters). Indeed, I'd venture to say that Whitrow's scene-stealing performance is the single most noticeable improvement over the 1966 movie.

 I will admit that I didn't think that Heston did as well as Paul Scofield with the character of Thomas More for the first half of the movie, but I must also say that Heston definitely held his own, if not exceeded Scofield in the more emotionally intense drama of the second half of the play. The farewell scene in the Tower had considerably more emotional punch than the '66 version (ironically, of course, the '66 portrayal may be a bit truer to the ""muted"" , restrained style of handling emotions among patrician English men and women. But I think Heston and Vanessa Redgrave surpass Scofield and Wendy Hiller in this scene).

 Richard Johnson's Duke of York is a much more interesting to watch character than Nigel Davenport's rendering in the 1966 version. The Duke of York is an important character for the plot and character development of More, and Johnson breathes greater life and humanity into this character. Consequently, the More-York friendship had a deeper dimension in this 1988 version.

Otherwise, the performances of John Hurt (as Richard Rich) and Robert Shaw (as Henry VIII) were (much) more captivating than their counterparts in this 1988 version. And I had mixed feelings about the greater prominence of the Common Man in the 1988 version: sometimes this character deepened the story and experience, sometimes it detracted from it.

Perhaps 3 stars is a bit harsh in light of the several points made above, but that is based partly on the idea that if you could only watch *one* version, I'd recommend the 1966 version. But the best recommendation is: watch both.",1469404800,2,2816,4.974468085106383
