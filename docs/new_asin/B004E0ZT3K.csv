Here he explores the ancient world that eventually became the British Isles from prehistoric times up to the Celts. The series is concluded with the second half, Celtic Britain.",1520121600,,322,5.46
8426360,5,B004E0ZT3K,"Solid, interesting, entertaining documentary.  Scottish presenter and all the rocks you could possibly want.  I liked it.  I like this sort of thing: a qualified person goes out with a crew, speaks a coherent narrative, and shows you stuff.  The Brits are good at this.  Wish the Americans were as good :(",1483488000,,305,4.788461538461538
8426361,5,B004E0ZT3K,First of all I haven't seen a Neil Oliver documentary I didn't like so I picked this up on name alone hoping it would cover more Celtic period Britain than most documentaries on this topic do.  Not only Celtic Britain is covered but the pre-history time frame as well so this documentary covers thousands and thousands of years.  Since most documentaries cover Britain around 1BCE and above there was a lot of material covered that I wasn't expecting to learn but I'm glad that I did.  Off the top of my head I think he covers around 25000BCE and up so you'll learn a lot about what the land masses looked like back then which was a lot different than what you see on a map today.,1480636800,,680,4.338582677165355

8426363,5,B004E0ZT3K,Great archaeology! The narrator is superb. A good story of prehistory through Roman occupation in Britain. The second volume is also worth the price. His History of Scotland is even better.,1448409600,,189,5.129032258064516
8426364,4,B004E0ZT3K,"I really enjoy Neil Oliver's story telling abilities!  He is fun and interesting to watch and adds his opinions to the story, which I enjoy.  This is a good historical review of Britain and it's up's and down's.  Strongly recommend this video for anyone that loves history and the history of warfare! This video reviews British history at it's best and worse!",1429228800,,359,4.758064516129032

Why do they have to be in different formats for different countries??  FRUSTRATING!",1402790400,3,260,4.863636363636363

8426368,5,B004E0ZT3K,"Those of you who enjoyed archaeologist Neil Oliver's excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-History-of-Scotland/dp/B003K025MI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A History of Scotland</a>&nbsp;will savor this story of how Britain came to be forged over thousands of years of ancient history. It's one of the most lucid descriptions of prehistory I have encountered. Neil Oliver's narration helps the past feel present to viewers, Ty Unwin's music is extraordinary, and the cinematography of Britain's landscapes, by Patrick Acum and Toby Wilkinson, is superb.

Age of Ice
This Paleolithic Age begins with a chilly landscape, when the ice was one kilometer deep over Scotland, and Britain was part of the European peninsula. Neil Oliver shows the gorgeous horse-carved bone and Ibis cave, 14,000 - 15,000 years ago. On the island of Colonsay, in the Scottish Hebrides, during the Mesolithic, 7,000 - 9,000 years ago, 1/3 million pounds of hazelnut shells were piled in mounds from food production. The resourcefulness of people on the islands during the Mesolithic is remarkable. On the other side of Scotland, in the Montrose Basin of the northeast, 6,100 years ago inhabitants did not fare so well, when an enormous landslide in Norway caused a giant tsunami to rush 40 kilometers inland, with massive loss of life, and permanent, large-scale alteration of the geography. Britain became an island.

Age of Ancestors
Neil Oliver describes this Neolithic Age, visiting the Isle of Mann, and western Ireland, with its expansive Neolithic cattle enclosure complex, dating 5,500 years ago. A delightful moment occurs when Oliver and fellow archaeologist Seamus Caulfield agree, whilst digging peat, that the weather is ""truly foul.""

The Age of Cosmology
Neil Oliver describes that during this period, human lives became ruled by sun and stars, with Britain in the throes of a Neolithic revolution. He visits the central fells of the Lake District, with Mark Edmonds, of the University of York. In the Lake District's magnificent landscape, they explore a Cumbrian axe factory, with exquisitely worked and polished stone axes. Then, Oliver takes us to 3,100 BC and the Orkney Islands, and the Neolithic settlement of Skara Brae, which was occupied for 600 years! He discusses stone circles, from Maes Howe, to the Ring of Brodgar, to the Stones of Stennes, and then beyond, to Stonehenge. With Clive O'Gibny, a sea-going Irish ""currach"" is tested as a means of transport, then Neil Oliver visits Newgrange tomb.

Age of Bronze
This journey begins with the exploration of ancient mine-shafts in Norfolk; 433 mines for flint dot the landscape. Then ancient copper mining on Ross Island, County Kerry, Ireland, is explored with William O'Brien; see his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ross-Island-Mining-Metal-and-Society-in-Early-Ireland-Bronze-Age-Studies/dp/0953562034/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ross Island: Mining, Metal and Society in Early Ireland (Bronze Age Studies)</a>. By 2,500 B.C., the Beaker People arrive from Alpine areas; an example is the earliest copper knife, in Wiltshire. Along the Cornish coast, and in Ireland and Scotland, copper and tin are mined and combined, creating Bronze. Metal axes become the norm, and Neil Oliver describes sword casting. The flow of metal and trade created wealth in Argyll, Scotland, in places like Kilmartin; Oliver examines a jet necklace imported from Yorkshire 2,150 years ago. The narrative travels to the marvels of the round-house settlement of Flag Fen, dating from 1,300 B.C., in Cambridgeshire, and we meet another old colleague, Francis Pryor. Twisted yew branches, called ""withies"" were used in the construction of round-houses, an enduring form of architecture that lasted 1000 years. A poignant site is out on the wonderfully bleak hills of Dartmoor, in Devon, with a complex of field systems and housing on a grand scale that ended when the climate changed again and the soil was depleted.

The series is 234 minutes, with English subtitles. I highly recommend this vivid journey through ancient Britain. You'll need a Region-free DVD player. Enjoy!

For Britain's post-Roman history, I highly recommend the excellent DVD series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Time-Team-Unearthing-the-Roman-Invasion/dp/B0079ILI2U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Time Team: Unearthing the Roman Invasion</a>.",1366761600,8,4474,5.928682170542635
