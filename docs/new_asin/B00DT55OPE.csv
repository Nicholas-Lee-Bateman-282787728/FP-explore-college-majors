5854157,5,B00DT55OPE,Humorous both subtle and broad.  I loved it.  I think everyone over the age of six should sit down and watch this movie with their grand parents,1384128000,7,144,4.296296296296297
5854158,5,B00DT55OPE,This was so fabulous! Great script. Very entertaining. More importantly provided insight and perspective on reform Judaism that many a boomer grew up with in the U.S.,1384041600,7,166,5.185185185185185
5854159,5,B00DT55OPE,"This wonderful movie is a delightful tour through a century and a half of the history of Hava Nagila, At times sentimental and kitchy, so was the music itself. That part of the hilarious fun. Hearing Harry Belafonte sing and talk about Hava is a delight.  Hearing Bob Dylan sing it may not be painful but is a true hoot.  Hearing Hava in so many forms is amazing.

Throughout my life, Hava Nagila has been the one melody that could get everyone on their feet dancing, whether they knew how or not.  No wedding, no Bar Mitzvah, no simcha, is complete until your hear and dance to this storied song.''

In addition to capturing all of that, this movie reveals competing versions of how Hava came to be.  Learn the secrets of  Hava. Nagila.",1384041600,13,737,4.455223880597015

5854195,5,B00DT55OPE,"Is very interesting the concept of this documentary
Is taking, in my opinion, a small concept, and become great, for the dimension in the analisis
Is wonderful to take a concept, and exhausted, and this is the case
Also important, is how this is touching the life of many people
The deepness of the concept is not a problem to do a very serious movie, with hilarious situation
Just great
Thank you",1391385600,3,397,4.527777777777778
5854196,5,B00DT55OPE,This is a really good documentary exploring a Jewish song I've known almost since childbirth ... and as it turns out I really knew nothing about it at all.,1389830400,6,155,4.379310344827586
5854197,5,B00DT55OPE,"I had the chance to see this highly entertaining  75-minute documentary at the Philadelphia Jewish Film Festival in 2012 and I could hardly wait for the DVD release, hoping there would be neat bonus features. And there are  about 30 minutes worth.

EVERYONE  Jewish or not  knows the song but very few know: How old it is? Who wrote it? Who had the biggest hit recording? (Hint. The singer was Italian, not Jewish with the runner-up being African-American) and WHY is it so popular?  Director Roberta Grossman gives you all the answers, and more, in this tightly edited film , produced by Marta Kaufman (a co-creator of the TV hit Friends). The narration is by Rusty Schwimmer.
A few more interesting tidbits youll learn (but I won't be a spoiler here  just a hint  is how Leonard Nimoy created the infamous hand signal for his character, Spock, on Star Trek, and which of the following pop artists  Bob Dylan, Dick Dale, Lena Horne - recorded the song?

The bonuses on the DVD (another reason to see the film, even if you saw it at a festival) include outtakes, extended interviews, the playing of the earliest known recording of the song (1922) and both the theatrical trailer and the wonderful 10-minute sample reel that Goldman created for the Kickstarter campaign to finish the film. It was seen by over 1 million people (and the long  I mean LONG  list of donors in the final credits- shows the result) and got the film released.

The next time I hear the song at a Bar Mitzvah or a wedding, Ill now be able to ask those around me Did you know that.?)

Mazel Tov to Grossman and her team. I cant wait to see what she does next!
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5854198,5,B00DT55OPE,"This movie documented the history of Hava Nagila in a light but enlightening way. I learned many things I had never known about the song. Knowing a couple people who were interviewed also made it even better for me, not that it wasn't extremely well made to begin with. I highly recommend this movie to all!",1387843200,5,307,4.5
5854199,5,B00DT55OPE,"As a born and bred gentile, Hava Nagila: The Movie is a seriously funny history lesson. From the eloquence of Harry Belafonte and Leonard Nimoy to the insights from Jewish scholars and musicians, to the humor from all the attempts to 'explain' and interpret Hava, this is a great ride start to finish. A perfect addition to anyone's library.
I was on the film crew at the former synagogue in Sadagora, Ukraine, when, just before packing up to leave, and, after years of fruitless searching by the director for descendents of the original Rabbi where Hava was likely to have originated, a bus pulled up, disgorging a group of British school kids on a tour of Jewish history in Europe. The leader of the group was not only the descendent, but the namesake of that original Rabbi of that ruin of a Synagogue in that obscure corner of Ukraine. I'm a believer in coincidence, but that came close to converting me to the divine.",1387756800,10,922,4.628048780487805

8597441,5,B00DT55OPE,"I bought this for my great-granddaughter when she was 12 and studying for her Bat Mitzvah. She really loved it and so did her rabbi. He ordered one for himself and I understand that after he showed it to some of the congregants they, too, wanted their own. This movie tells the who, what, when, where, why, and how - fun facts about the iconic song. It is definitely well worth having if you're Jewish or even if you're not because the song, in and of itself, is known to both Jews and non-Jews.",1506816000,,495,4.276595744680851

8597446,5,B00DT55OPE,"This is a good documentary of the history of the melody and words of Hava Nagila and its later association with the dance Hora. The song, according to this film, began as a wordless melody song by Chassidic Jews who wanted to express joy. It was only after 1948, when the State of Israel was founded, that words were added, ""come let us rejoice."" There is a dispute among two families who composed the words. The song caught on especially when it was joined to the Hora dance. It has been song by many non-Jews, including Elvis Presley. Harry Bellefonte made it into a great hit. Klezmer music was for a short time seen to be in opposition to Hava. Klezmer is music from Europe, but Hava, although the melody is from Europe, the words are from Israel, and many Jews wanted to connect with their ancestors in Europe. But Hava won out and is the most sought after music at Jewish Bar Mitzva ceremonies and wedding.",1449360000,2,912,4.467065868263473
