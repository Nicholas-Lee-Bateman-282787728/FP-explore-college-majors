1715562,1,B000067J0H,"I'm still trying to figure this movie out. I got it mostly because I loved Lucio Fulci's great ""Zombie."" House of Clocks was made for Italian TV and looks it. Bad photography, lighting, terrible performances and a script that makes zero sense. The story involves a large Italian villa filled with clocks and clock hands that turn endlessly backwards. An old couple murders a maid. Then three jerks--a gal and two guys--break in and mayhem ensues. The clock hands turn even more furiously backwards. I think it means that the past keeps coming back to this one villa but then you're confronted with a dead married couple whose bodies lay in coffins in the attic. They suddenly come alive. Then...oh, I can't go on. It gets so confusing that I may have to go back and watch it again. God forbid. For Fulci addicts only.",1077235200,6,817,4.641379310344828
1715563,4,B000067J0H,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Fulci fan and have several of his movies.  However, his movies fall into two categories: ""So bad it's good"" (Don't Torture a Duckling, Zombie, City of Living Dead, Beyond) and ""so bad it's awful"" (""Cat in the Brain, Manhattan Baby"").  This originally made-for-TV film is the cornerstone of a third Fulci tier: a sincerely creepy, effective success of a horror movie.
Instead of utilizing the common concept of shoddy acting, implausible plotlines and buckets o'gore, Fulci makes House of Clocks an atmospheric and tense affair, relying more on narrative and disturbing ambiance- with surprising success.  He still gives into the temptation for a bit of gore sprinkled throughout but nothing to the puke factor extent seen in Zombie or City of Living Dead.
A well crafted horror yarn in the mode of Avati's ""House with Windows that Laugh"".  Had he continued along the same vein of restricting the gross-out factor while still incorporating plenty of shock as he did with Clocks, Fulci may have found more success than his Herschell Gordon Lewis-esque icon status amongst gorehounds.",1051488000,4,1111,5.054644808743169
1715564,4,B000067J0H,"This is a very weird film by Italian goremeister Lucio Fulci that was originally made for an Italian TV horror series called ""House Of Doom"" but was deemed too violent to be shown on TV. It concerns a wealthy elderly couple in a large estate which the husband has filled with all manner of ticking clocks and timepieces he has collected over the years. They seem benign at first but are revealed to be insane. They have murdered their niece and nephew-in-law and entombed their rotting corpses in the estate's chapel dressed in wedding attire. The wife, Sara, also murders the maid in the greenhouse when she discovers the corpses and threatens to leave. Meanwile, three fresh faced pot-smoking thieves (two guys and a girl) decide to rob the estate. Things go awry and the elderly couple is killed along with their one-eyed gardener. When the old man dies, his grandfather clock stops ticking and all the other clocks follow suit. The young thieves panic and try to get out but the couples' three big black Dobermans stand guard trapping them inside. Then all the clocks start spinning backwards and time begins reversing. The dead gardener, maid and elderly couple come back and begin killing the thieves leaving only the girl watching helplessly while the dead niece and nephew-in-law also return to life and kill the elderly couple! Whew! As if this wasn't enough, the whole thing turns out to be a nightmare experienced by the thieves simultaneously before they broke into the house! After discussing the ""dream"" and laughing it off, they decide NOT to rob the house and drive off only to die in a bloody car accident when the black cat they had found and put in a bag leaps out and mauls the driver's face causing him to run off an embankment. Well. As for complicated plot twists, this takes the cake. Fulci's reputation for gore is evident here as there is plenty of it in the deaths of the characters. The dubbing is ludicrous at times but not too bad and the film moves along rather nicely with the twists sustaining interest throughout. The performances are good and the photography is excellent. It's creepy, spooky and even scary at times. The DVD presentation is fine and the transfer is crisp and clear. I've read that this is tame for Fulci but I find it handled rather well. It's very watchable and I recommend it as a really strange Italian horror film for buffs. Check it out.",1041984000,6,2395,4.6912114014251785
1715565,4,B000067J0H,"Fulci's sucess is a teeter-totter of unravelled contents and zombie-head explosions, but House of Clocks isn't a gore epic. I enjoyed this movie because of the inventive plot-concept Fulci uses to engage, not confuse--as in some of his flicks such as City of the Walking Dead. The characters, a trio of cleptos, find themselves caught up in a time warp started when they accidentally kill an old couple in their clock-ridden mansion.  Don't give up until the end, the twist is deadly and I admit, it put a twisted smile on my face.  There are a few gory moments--a lot of bullet wounds--in this movie, but if that's all you care about, then look somewhere else.  Fulci fans need this as much as I need a damn good zombie movie.",1041379200,11,727,4.576923076923077

7962943,4,B000067J0H,"This is a really good and spooky film that would improve considerably if it got a new Blu-ray release. The soundtrack during the beginning credits is very eerie and may also be considered somewhat depressing to some, and I thought the entire film is well scored. The story involves some thieves invading an old mansion with its elderly owners and their handyman. The place is decorated by loads of clocks that have a power to reverse time, so this comes into effect when the burglary goes wrong. There is nice scenery with the mansion that also provides a good atmospheric type quality to film. Most of the film takes place indoors at this mansion, so some may or may not like that choice of setting. It has only a bit of topless nudity, but there're some very good Fulci type gore scenes. Don't expect the level of gore like some of his early works, but it has its moments. Overall, the film does concentrate more on the story, character, scenery and atmosphere than the gore; although it does have some gruesome parts. Despite the fact that I liked the film, I didn't think the replay value was as strong as many of his other films. To me, this was probably the main problem with the whole thing.

This Shriek Show DVD looks good. You get interviews as well.",1475280000,,1260,4.526315789473684

7962945,5,B000067J0H,"This was actually one of late director Lucio Fulci's Italian TV movies that he made in 1989 (the other being SWEET HOUSE OF HORRORS). It is definitely one of Fulci's better of his later films and proves that you could get away with a lot more on 1989 Italian TV than you can with most American TV today. I won't give away the plot (but the title does play a major role), but it is an atmospheric supernatural thriller with dollops of gore (it's not his usual gorefest and is better for it). If you like subtle horror, you could do a lot worse than THE HOUSE OF CLOCKS. Just don't go in expecting ZOMBIE or THE BEYOND and you may be surprised how enjoyable this film is.",1424217600,2,669,4.234375

Happy to have it in my collection and I watch it often along with The Beyond and New York Ripper. Not really anything bad about this film to me, solid piece of horror from one of the greats.

7962947,2,B000067J0H,"I am a big fan of Lucio Fulci and have most of his films on DVD.  I saw this on amazon and bought it.  It is not very good.  There is not one decent person / charecter in the whole film.  In a film, you need at least one person you care about.  This film is populated with the most disgusting vile people anyone can come up with.  Murders, thieves, people who torture animals.  You need at least one hero.  There was not one person in this that i cared about. It is about a very sick and demented couple how have a house  full of clocks and can some how, thru the clocks, reverse time.  When A trio of sick demented crooks/ animal abusers decide to rob the rich elderly couple, they are thrust into strange world where time reveses it's self and the dead come back to life.  Once the young trio murder the elderly couple, all the clocks start to go backwards and history repeates it's self, with the elderly couple coming back to life, all fixed up and no sign of thier  wounds.  Then they go about chasing and killing the three.  There is no explaination as to how the couple can control time or why they are even doing it.  The pace is slow, the acting only fair and the blood, well this film has alot less blood then other Fulci films.  The whole film reminded me if the pacing of the ""Blind dead"" films.",1325462400,2,1307,4.168
7962948,4,B000067J0H,"I really believe that people critical of Fulci just don't get it. That's ok, though. People are entitled to opinions, however much they may be inconsistent with mine.

This movie is flawed in certain ways, but only if you look at this in a traditional narrative sense or if you like your acting to be proficient. If you want great acting and a narrative storyline, then go to your local multiplex.

Fulci's movies are about the visuals, feeling, impulse, hidden desires.  Even though this was made for a TV release (secondarily, cinematic), the sense of dread, the fluid feel of emotion and fear, the gore gags, etc., are all present.

Rather than being derided for flaws in narrative structure and poor acting, this should be celebrated and studied by filmmakers interested in the what really is possible with small budgets and impossible time constraints.

However, with that being said, I bet that most people wouldn't like this. Their loss.",1283904000,,944,4.911949685534591
7962949,1,B000067J0H,"In a word, Baloney

If you're still interested in watching any late 1980's movies by gore master Lucio Fulci, chances are you might want to add this to your list. Well, don't. It's another total turkey. As far as I can see, Fulci started a downward slide with ""Manhattan Baby"", and never recovered. I have seen ""Aenigma"" (a joke) ""Touch of Death"" (pitiful), ""A Cat in the Brain"" (nonsensical), ""Voices From Beyond (snoozefest), and even sat through ""The Ghosts of Sodom"" (run as far as you can from this abomination), so I have no-one else to blame but myself for even giving ""House of Clocks"" a try.

The plot is roughly this: An elderly couple inhabit a large mansion, and they are more than a little eccentric, by which I mean that from the very outset they are both seen to have homicidal tendencies! Into this situation drop three young petty criminals who have designs on stealing some loot from the treasure laden house. The twist is that the treasures of the house are all clocks, and when the violent youths meet the crazy old couple, the clocks themselves play a big part in what happens next...

Ok so what's wrong with this movie? Well basically, most of it. As with all of Fulci's later works it's hampered by everything that could possibly make a passable horror movie into a disaster. The acting is really poor. I've never seen such amateurish mugging and wailing as we get here from the three central youngsters. They are just terrible. A really, REALLY bad dubbing job only makes things worse, and English speaking dubbing team don't seem to have a clue about matching dialogue up to lip movements, there is barely a moment when the cast look like they are using their own voices. The elderly couple are just as bad, even though they don't ham it up, they are lumbered with an equally hopeless dub job.

Sadly, the list of shame goes on. The direction and camera work are totally uninspired. Fulci has a few trademark images that he continues to roll out over and over again. Cameras mount staircases, zoom in on shadows or doorknobs, jump rapidly in focus from foreground to background and back again, etc etc. I've seen all these tricks a hundred times and the novelty has long since worn off. Worse still, the effects are now beyond lame. All the gore scenes (brief and not very explicit) are really poor, the effects are very shoddy and they just don't work. The non-gore special effects are equally terrible, and sadly this film relies on a few trick shots for important scenes, all of which are botched. It's like Fulci doesn't know how to make anything pass for realistic, or just doesn't care.

But the very worst offender of all is the plot. Oh my god. Words fail me in trying to explain what's going on here. The film has a major supernatural twist and from the moment that everything in the house goes pear shaped (you'll know when), the film just unravels totally. Nothing works, nothing makes sense, nothing gets explained. Don't think I am just not getting it. I love surreal cinema and being made to think. But this is an insult. As stupid event followed stupid event I was almost laughing, but by the time the end credits rolled, I was wondering how this was ever passed off as serious entertainment, it's such a mess it's just not funny.

Take my advice and don't go near this. I'm sorry to be so negative about Lucio Fulci when he has produced some of the genre's finest shockers, but his later films never repeated the success of the golden days, and this is just another example of him churning out pot-boilers when he had long since lost the ability or interest in making a good product.",1196121600,,3625,4.58641975308642
7962950,3,B000067J0H,"It's always said when it comes to Lucio Fulci fans are split in the middle on his career. I myself am a big fan of Lucio Fulci, but I do understand why some people dislike his work. But the one thing I think even Fulci fans can agree on is after 1982 he seemed to have lost his edge. Most of the later day Fulci flicks I have seen lacked compared to his earlier work.

The House of Clocks for me is no different and I'm actually surprised at all the positive reviews. While I wouldn't say The House of Clocks is a bad movie it just for me falls flat. The House of Clocks was actually made for TV, but never aired on Italian TV as it was seen as too gory so it got a theatrical release instead.

The House of Clocks was written by Gianfranco Clerici & Daniele Stroppa from a story written by Lucio Fulci. The story wasn't bad it actually has a pretty decent premise. The screenplay however is rather weak; horror films in general aren't know for their great scripts, but you need something good enough to at least keep things interested when there is nothing happening.

The script is no worse than some other ones out there, but it does lack. The characters are pretty much the run of the mill horror movie characters. The old couple while clichd were probably the most interesting of all the characters. Lucio Fulci in his career always seemed to be hit or miss even within the same movie. I have always though liked Fulci's visual style and sometimes he could make a movie a lot creepier than it should have been.

With The House of Clocks, Fulci actually does manage to build some atmosphere, but I felt he never used his location to full advantage. The outside of the house did have a creepy vibe at night and the inside of the house was big and should have been explored more. At times we do see flashes of classic Fulci where as other times we see a guy who has lost his edge. The pacing for The House of Clocks is a bit messy.

The first half of the movie can be slow at times and with the lack of any likable characters that doesn't help matters. The 2nd half does pick up, but at times the movie can still drag. Even though The House of Clocks only runs at about 84-minutes I actually feel a couple of minutes could have been left on the cutting room floor.

I'm a huge die hard fan of Italian cinema but let's face it a lot of these movies can have these incoherent moments. Nor Fulci or the writers really attempt to explain anything all that happens has no explanation at all. Gore wise Fulci delivers; don't expect the movie to be as gory as most of his movies were from the 79-82 era. The House of Clocks doesn't feature the gore he was known for, but in its own right it's pretty gory when it comes time for it. Like I said just don't expect the gore to be as extreme as the 79-82 era.

A lot of people didn't like the ending, but I actually quite liked it I thought it was a pretty decent twist. At first I was rather upset about it. But the closing scene made up for it.

In closing The House of Clocks isn't a bad movie, but just seems to lack in certain spots. It's a decent but forgettable movie. The House of Clocks is probably one of the better late day Fulci flicks, but your best bet is to stick with his 70s & early 80s work.

If you are a fan of Lucio Fulci you might get some enjoyment out of it like I did despite the flaws. I would say though if you don't like Fulci's work best bet is to stay away as I doubt this will sway you on his work.",1183248000,,3470,4.128888888888889
7962951,5,B000067J0H,"If you're in the mood for something different, I would suggest this film.  It's setting and general mood is strange, especially considering the demeanor of main characters.  The set designs are great, and they really give the house a unique look.  It's a different kind of film from Fulci, and it shows versatility and great imagination on his part.  I was entertained from start to finish.  I felt that the ending was satisfying, and it gave me a good chuckle.  Some people have a hard time understanding this film, which is too bad.  I wasn't confused at any point, but it does demand attention.  I recommend films, like this, that require you to bring your own imagination to the table and have a good time.",1177027200,,710,4.624
