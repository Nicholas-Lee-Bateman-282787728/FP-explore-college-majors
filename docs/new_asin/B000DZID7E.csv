8199920,5,B000DZID7E,"REALLY HARD TO FIND HANS STORY ON THIS DVD.  THERE WERE A FEW VERSIONS MADE WHICH I SAW ON T.V. AS A CHILD WHICH DO NOT EXIST TODAY. LOOKED EVERYWHERE !  THE MOST MEMORABLE SHOWED THE 3 DOGS PROGRESSIVELY LARGER WHERE DOG NUMBER 3 WAS THE SIZE OF A 4 STORY BUILDING.  THIS VERSION TELLS THE STORY VERY WELL AND FITS RIGHT IN TO VIEW FROM THANKSGIVING TO CHRISTMAS WHEN IT WAS TRADITIONALLY SHOWN ON T.V. MANY YEARS AGO.  I PERSONALLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD; GREAT FUN FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS AND A GREAT FAMILY ORIENTED STORY.  THIS DVD ALSO HAS OTHER GOOD HCA STORIES....
AMAZON HAD THIS DVD FOR SALE AT A GOOD PRICE AND THEIR VAST INVENTORY IS THE FIRST PLACE I LOOK FOR HARD TO FIND ITEMS !",1327104000,3,689,4.269230769230769
