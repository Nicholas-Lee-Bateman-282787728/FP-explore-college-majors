I was in the movie and was wanting to see it.

8433503,4,B004KWHLWO,"This is a film from the 1980s which explores the naivete of the conquering 5th Division of the American army as it takes Napoli and advances on to Rome. What they encounter is the veneer of civility scraped over some of the most intense brutality you have ever seen. There are two main protagonists. The naive Jimmy from Cleveland is taken by the worldly Italian aristocrat Malaparte and shown this twilight world, every one welcomes the Americans and no-one was ever a fascist. German prisoners of war are fed up while the local population starves, and everything, absolutely everything, is for sale, and the free market is in full swing. It seems absurdly cheap to Jimmy, but as he is dragged further in he realises there is always a heavy price to pay.

Some things you should know:

1) it is in Italian ONLY - no subtitles, no English soundtrack. This is a real pity because the original movie was in Italian and English and subtitled into either one or the other. So if you don't speak Italian you are going to have to rip this movie to a hard drive and combine it with some open-source subs

2) the movie is region 2 in PAL

3) the aspect ratio is 4:3

I knew all that before I bought it, and still bought it. That should tell you something.",1359763200,2,1247,4.427947598253275
