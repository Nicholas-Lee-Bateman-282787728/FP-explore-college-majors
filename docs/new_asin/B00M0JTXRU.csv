6537542,5,B00M0JTXRU,"Wow, I have never seen a film that represents the Holy Spirit so clearly. This film will challenge those who don't know the Holy Spirit, and encourage those that do to go deeper in Him. Praise the Lord for this film. This film is packed with sound doctrine, and powerful exploits showing that God is bigger than any darkness we can come across.

For those familiar with Finger of God, Furious Love, or Father of lights, this one is different. It doesn't have the same feel of discovering who God is as those did, this was more bold, fast paced, and Holy Spirit wanted to make a solid point of His character and nature. This film is something only Holy Spirit can script and raises the bar of what Jesus can do through lives surrendered to Him.",1411776000,41,743,4.423357664233577

6537545,5,B00M0JTXRU,"I watched this streaming online from the Bethel church premiere and can't wait for my deluxe edition when it comes out
I think this film has to be unique. God is responsible for the world's most popular book. I watch a lot of movies and I've thought 'if God made a movie, what would it be about, what would it look like? Well, I think I now have an idea. Darren Wilson didn't know what the content of his film was to be about from my understanding. He let the Holy Spirit direct where he went, what he filmed and God picked the cast. The filmmaker was just along for the ride in a sense. As I watched the film I was continually reminded of this.
I saw the heart of God reaching out to the heart man in the most unexpected and incredible ways. I'm glad I watched this at home because I spent most of the film crying. ( It seems crying is what it takes to get me to write a review on amazon - therefore this is only my 2nd or 3rd!) God turns up in the most unexpected places to show people who don't know Him how much He loves THEM and wants relationship with them. Who knew God hung out at Korn concerts? This didn't surprise me as much as the response of the hard core Korn FANS to God being there!
I've seen finger of God, Furious Love and Father of Lights and read Filming God - and I had no idea what to expect from this film as it wasn't part of that series, but I think Darren has really developed an intimacy with God and this becomes more obvious in each film that comes out. I respect the filmmaker's integrity, refreshing honesty, and I especially love that he doesn't use Christian cliches and spiritual sounding language. He just seems to love God with such a friendship.
If you don't believe in God; or have a negative conception of God because you've been hurt through churches or put off by Christians - I pray this film will show you what Jesus is really like. If you're a Christian and want to have your faith built up, see what the third Person of the Trinity is doing in the world and see what He wants to do through you, don't hesitate to see this film",1410220800,82,2071,4.154228855721393

6537585,2,B00M0JTXRU,"I really wanted to love this movie.  I'm a Spirit-filled believer, but I know that God values faithfulness.  In a movie of all things, they end up trashing a guy's ministry who's been out there preaching faithfully for decades, and yet he's come up against very tough soil.  In contrast, they're out there saying things to the tune of, 'Hey, when I do this, do you feel better?  Double it.  Double it!  Oh, that's the Holy Ghost' and saying that they're doing better work in 30 minutes than the guy who has been preaching Jesus for 30 years...yet not once in their feelings-fest do I see that group (there are several in the movie) bring up a clear message of Jesus' life, death, and Resurrection in the movie.  I'm hoping that clear message was presented behind the scenes, but I don't know why that would be left out of a movie with clear intent of some sort of evangelism.  The Holy Ghost is not a feeling, though yes, He can and does make His presence known.  He is a person of the Godhead who comforts, empowers, and leads people to Jesus, the process/event of which involves repentance and renewal, not simply how one feels at a certain time.  I see Romans 10:9-10, 1 John 1:9, Jesus talking with Nicodemus in John 3, His promises in John 14, etc., but the feelings thing seems vapid and likely of eisegetical derivation.

There is ONE part of the movie that I did love -- when one of the evangelists actually brings up the Gospel for once at the Korn concert.  Yes, several are out there talking to people and praying for people, but that one moment where Jesus is actually preached clearly.  YES!  FINALLY!  That was nice.  But then there are concerns with the scenario.  While two of the members of Korn have seemingly experienced revival, the way they portray their testimony is that they needed a feeling to replace their drug addiction, which is a bit worrisome, but I know that God does often reach us when we're the most abased and despondent.  Essentially, the Holy Spirit was the new addiction, and yet at the same concert, there are close-ups (if I remember correctly, during the invitation...) of abandoned bras, the infamous mic stands of the Korn band (which haven't changed -- e.g. one is a naked woman, and there's an unfamiliar one that looked like a demon), etc. which made me grieve about the message being portrayed.  Simple discernment...people are going to the concert, a few in the crowd are hearing the Gospel (which is great), but then are inundated with the world.  Is this really in-and-not-of the world?  I think the likelihood is thorny soil, but the hope is for much better.

I do also question some of the elements of the India trip.  The people seemed really cordial...even the high priest of several deities is leading them around the city and enjoys their music.  But what's being sung?  Basically, ""Freedom"" and ""You are loved"" (very generic).  There's wisdom in when to say certain things, but I don't see those things ever being presented anyway in those scenes.  In another part, a guy is actually praying for people and bringing up Jesus as the healer, and nobody has a problem with it.  That's the cool part of that trip to me.  Yes, pray for people in Jesus' Name, go for it!  But with all the context given, I'm a bit skeptical that they were chased out of the park/city, especially when they had a whole crowd sitting there peacefully enjoying the guitar and ambiguous music.  Regardless, they got out safely and visited temples that only did so much as have people maybe raise an eyebrow as to why they were there.

Basically, God is all about transformation...but ""how will they hear without a preacher?""  Sometimes soil is rough, and numbers shouldn't be paraded as the tell-all in ministry success.  What happened with Jeremiah's ministry, and how faithful was he?  Sometimes we also hit seasons in which we see dramatic fruit from our ministry, and other seasons in which things are more difficult, and we have to trust in God and keep going in faithfulness and obedience to Him.  Many come to know the Lord, because the Holy Spirit has been preparing them.  We're part of the work, and as long as we're obedient and faithful and proclaiming repentance, faith, and the hope that only comes through Jesus, we're going to be on a good trajectory.  But the message was so garbled in this movie in so many ways.

God is not about parlor tricks.  He sacrificed His Son because of our sin and for the penalty of our sin.  It's really serious business to God.  In any ministry, please be clear about Jesus and the need to put your faith in Him.  Heaven and Hell are at stake.  Jesus loves you.  Let's make all of that known.

Outside of that, the case was shattered when I got it, but the DVDs were in fine shape.  Overall, 2 stars, but such a disappointed 2 stars.  I was looking forward to this so much, but ended up grieved at a lot of lost opportunities and questionable circumstances.",1489795200,2,4936,4.587428571428571

6537664,5,B00M0JTXRU,I was so intrigued by this film when I saw it stream live from Bethel back a few years ago that I bought it as soon as it was released on DVD. The way God used the crew to show His love for people no matter what part of the world they are from was absolutely amazing. I can truly say this film has brought me into a deeper level of knowing God and the way the Holy Ghost works and I've watched it somewhere along the lines of about 15 times now and it never gets boring and there is always some new revelation I gather each time I view it. And I cry each time I see those young people at the Korn concert all gather in to Todd and Feldy and Brian's prayer group and give their lives to Jesus.

6537667,5,B00M0JTXRU,"Very challenging to produce a movie directed by the Holy Spirit rather than a script.  I loaned this movie to three people.  Two of them loved it as I did.  The third refused to watch beyond the first third of the DVD.

I found the DVD very moving and uplifting as did my Latino friend who recommended the movie to me.  Let me break the review down to three major major parts of the movie:

1st part contained  scenes shot in Salt Lake City -  parts of this were great, but I was put off by the scene where the movie directed a boy to bend his hand beyond the limits that the metal implanted in his hand would allow.  A fellow viewer felt that this scene could be compared to a cheap carnival act, and he was so turned off by this , that he refused to watch the rest of the DVD.  His wife watched the entire DVD and enjoyed it.

2nd Part -  Long scene of Heavy Metal Band members leading people to Christ, and the witness of two band members of their experience with Christ.  This  part of the DVD was inspiring, but I would have preferred that it was shortened.  However, this was the most moving part of the DVD to my other friend who shared this DVD with his prayer group and they all loved the entire DVD.

3rd Part - Shot in Indian temples and a village along the Ganges river.  Every instant of theses scenes are incredible and they alone make the DVD worth buying and watching.  I will not describe them further, because you need to watch them yourself.

In general, I think this is a great film and I will view/buy others by this filmmaker.",1472688000,3,1548,4.186440677966102

6537821,5,B00M0JTXRU,"Holy Ghost is a movie made entirely under the direction of the Holy Spirit. It involves the obedience of the film crew and people involved with the film to listen to and wait on the direction of the Holy Spirit. The sequence of things that do not immediately connect, the places, the people the crew met along this journey was fascinating. It goes beyond all expectations.. When the Lord gives you a direction, it usually isn't for your immediate understanding. It may be a partial picture, a couple of steps at a time that you are given. This film crosses racial lines, faith practices, countries, has no plot except sharing the Gospel in word or music. In a human realm, it gets very dangerous, exciting, risky and sticks its neck out.

The people don't want the truth. They want to believe you can live any way you wish and are on your way to heaven as long as you ""believe in Jesus"". But the bible says even the demons believe. This film is a mockery and if you are truly born again, your discernment detector will be going haywire if you should decide to sit through this garbage. This is just a tool of the enemy to deceive people into thinking they are saved when they aren't.. Go to you tube and look up Brian Welch exposed.

6537890,5,B00M0JTXRU,"Great film, what I love is that it challenges be to do the Bible and not just read it. I grew up in the church so I know what it is like to believe God in your mind but it never makes its way to the heart. If we truly believe the words of the Bible it would send us to the streets and require some sort of responsibility on our part to advance the Kingdom of God. Jesus sent out the 72 and gave them an assignment. There are a lot of Christians (I admit I was one of them) that know they have a responsibility to share and invite people into a relationship with Jesus but they are afraid or just lazy. I like this film because it shows that there are people that actually believe what God says to the point that it makes them get up and go do something about it.",1440979200,,762,3.891025641025641

6537959,5,B00M0JTXRU,An excellent movie to expose millions of unbelieving believers to the fact that the Holy Spirit didn't cease working when the last Apostle died.,1431388800,,144,5.041666666666667
6537960,5,B00M0JTXRU,"Excellent movie displaying the willingness of the Holy Spirit to bless and transform our lives by his love, grace, and power.  Many people do not understand this movie correctly, and the director knew this beforehand.  I have read the one star reviews.  These one star reviews represent the misunderstanding ones.  Holy Spirit is overly eager to heal (Sozo) you.  Look at Jesus and His life and compare it to people who do not walk in the fullness: therein lies the issue.  Watch the movie and let your mind be open.  You will only be as free in the Spirit as you allow yourself to be.",1431302400,,585,4.514285714285714

6537962,1,B00M0JTXRU,"I was excited when I saw the trailer for this film, especially since it co-starred a few musicians I use to be into.  Right off the bat I knew I was going to have a difficult time with this movie: when the cast goes around suggesting to be able to heal people immediately of their ailments!  If that's the case, get off of the street and go down to a children's hospital and work your healing there.  I'm not saying that the Holy Spirit can't move and heal immediately, but it was off-putting to see the cast suggest that they could use the Holy Spirit heal immediately, and then push the person being prayed for to suggest that their ailment was better and celebrate if they hinted it was even a little bit better.",1430956800,11,715,4.32089552238806
6537963,5,B00M0JTXRU,"Another miraculous work of the acts of God through His vessels here on earth in the 21st Century. God is Spirit and if you want to EXPERIENCE HIM you must seek after Him in spirit and truth through and only through His One True Son Jesus, less we begin to embrace the supernatural with the wrong motive. It is with the wrong motive that we find ourselves trapped in witchcraft, satanism and the occult. The miraculous and the supernatural of God bring glory and fame to Jesus and point to the Father's love through the cross of Jesus. This film is about those seeking to re-present Jesus to others through a spiritual encounter (He is Spirit) and the Father has placed His signs and wonders on their ministry to confirm that He is with them.",1430784000,2,741,4.496296296296296

Praise the Lord for this film. This film is packed with sound doctrine, and powerful exploits showing that God is bigger than any darkness we can come across.

I would have liked to see more miraculous footage of healing, but then I always want more.",1430265600,7,419,4.586666666666667

6538051,2,B00M0JTXRU,"I'm sorry to say this was a HUGE disappointment! I have seen all three of Darren Wilson's previous DVDs and expected some really interesting footage of the Holy Spirit moving amongst people. What I saw, instead, was a very repetitive, superficial ""display"" of one particular emphasis, as well as reams of endless, often boring prattle, constant camera movement which made me nauseous, a lot of meaningless running here and there, and very little substance. It was more irritating than exhilarating. At the end of it, I wasn't even sure what the point was supposed to be. So very unfortunate.",1425513600,3,591,4.97979797979798

6538377,3,B00M0JTXRU,Love the concept but this is merely Darren walking around on the street with a camera. We saw this same style of film in the last movie. I thought he would actually go into churches and meetings and concerts and actually reveal what the Spirit is ACTUALLY doing today. I thought he would capture the Spirit transforming lives through His gifts and manifestations. Kinda misleading title...,1414540800,8,389,4.909090909090909

6538379,1,B00M0JTXRU,"Disappointed with this movie.  I have not seen any of Darren Wilson's other movies. I don't agree with the practice of testing or provoking our Creator or the Holy Spirit to get our way.  Yahweh's will, not ours be done. I was also uncomfortable with how the street minister in Utah was spoken to by Darren's street ""healers""  They treated this minister as if everything he was doing was wrong.  And then asked his wife behind his back, ""How many people has your husband brought to salvation?""  I mean, really, they are putting themselves above this man who probably has spent countless hours talking to people in the streets without fanfare for himself.  And why did the Hindu leader in the movie accept them?  Is it because he realizes these healers are just like him or under the same influence as he is?  I don't know the answer but I am skeptical. In these last days we need to pray for discernment and honor Yahweh and our personal time and relationship with Him above everything else. I learned an important lesson from watching this movie, although I do believe in prayer and Yahweh's healing and deliverance I aim to be careful whom I let lay hands on me to ""heal"" me.  My faith is in Yeshua, not mankind or the world.  Todd White seems to have good character but I question the company he keeps. I suggest watching ""Brian Welch Spirituality Exposed"" on You Tube and you will see the  life of KORN. and friends. Pretty disgusting behavior and you can see how other  false prophets, Todd Bentley, Bill Johnson pastor of Bethel Church Redding CA,  Bob Jones, Matthew Ford, Patricia King, John Crowder, the Whosoevers, etc twist the Bible. These false prophets lead in Luciferian doctrines and mock the one and only true Messiah, Yeshua Hamashiach.  In watching this video I believe one can clearly discern how vital it is to follow our Good Shepherd,  Yeshua, not man.  Many believers seem to be addicted to and needy of signs and wonders as well as addiction to chaotic environments with  yelling, shaking and laughing uncontrollably, sometimes even violent behavior and being ""drunken in the spirit""  slurring words, falling, etc. That behavior is demonic  Following Yeshua is peace, having self control, repentance, compassion, love and humility, following the one and only true Gospel of Yeshua Hamashiach.",1414195200,28,2317,4.820253164556962

And, trust me, this is not just a staged event. God is also working powerfully in my family's life, where miraculous encounters are happening. To God Be the Glory!",1414108800,17,341,4.7

6538383,4,B00M0JTXRU,I personally enjoyed this very much. Such depth is shown in faith and obedience. He calls on all of us to serve but many do not. I hope many will watch this with an open mind and seek faith in Jesus.,1413936000,3,199,3.8780487804878048
6538384,4,B00M0JTXRU,"Enjoyed the movie.  Shipped and received on time as promised.  I wasn't as enthralled, as I was with Father of Lights.  I think I enjoyed that a little better.  I think one reason why I enjoyed Father of Lights a little more was it didn't have a lot of side interviews like this one did.  I don't mind some interviews or presenting different points of view, but I felt there was too many interviews.  I would have liked to have seen more of Ravi.  I found his story and testimony to be very moving.  He was not in this documentary at all. I'm only giving this 4 stars because I felt it was missing something in the documentary in comparison with Father of Lights.",1413936000,2,663,4.290322580645161

6538416,4,B00M0JTXRU,"Made me think in new ways. Not sure what I think about a lot of it, but they did a good job of presenting different world views in an intriguing setting and circumstances. The ending bothered me a bit. The cameo by Michael W. Smith changed my life. I will never view relationships the same again. Was worth watching just for that. I do agree that if the two camps (Word based and Spirit based) ever meet we will see a revival like the world hasn't seen since Pentecost. This film is best watched alone and then with a friend or few. It definitely will spark discussion.",1413849600,4,569,4.327102803738318

8669502,1,B00M0JTXRU,"I have no clue how this rubbish got the multiple stars from so many viewers. The cover is very misleading and the entire video is nothing but rubbish. Two, three obese, mid 30s men going around different places and touching young people and telling them the holy spirit has just come into them.
Once in a while they'd try to 'heal' a youth (by suggestion) putting their hands on him and saying the holy ghost was healing him. They had to do it 3X! (with the power of suggestion). The so-called ministers would jump with glee when they would do this.
I'd try to get my $ back but I'll 'eat it' out of my stupidity. The ***** is what fooled me.
I live in Vegas. You can walk to multiple corners and you'll see the same charades going on! Smoke and mirrors, that's all it is.
If your going to throw your money away, you'd be better off placing a bet on a blackjack table! You might win.
Ugh! Huge mistake. People, move on!
That's my opinion and I stand by it. Anyone disagreeing can kiss my grits.",1510358400,,994,4.264550264550264
