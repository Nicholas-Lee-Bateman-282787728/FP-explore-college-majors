The only one I hadn't seen before was Pistachio and that was a pretty good one.,1361923200,,255,3.923076923076923

5158812,5,B008FXLZ08,"We love Veggie Tales at our house, and the Little Ones Can Do BIG Things Too! DVD is perfect for our family of littles.

Three Veggie Tale classic stories {Dave & The Giant Pickle - one of my personal favorites, Lyle the Kindly Viking, and Pistachio: The Little Boy Who Woodn't} are combined together on this fun DVD that helps little ones realize that they don't have to be big to do great things for God.

This DVD has great examples of characters who were little but who did what God asked them to and ended up doing BIG things for Him. It's a great tool for teaching my own little ones the importance of doing what God asks of them each and every day because they'll never know when He'll take their ""little"" and turn it into something ""big"" for His glory.",1348617600,4,760,4.3076923076923075
5158813,5,B008FXLZ08,"My family has been a fan of Veggie Tales for a long time and this new DVD a great compilation of past Veggie Tale classics that show kids that they can do so many great things if they just put their minds to it. At the same time it helps kids understand that all things that they accomplish are through the grace and gifts of God. As a parent I have always loved these shows as they have messages that I want my kids to learn, not only about their own spirituality, but also about friendship, and so much more. This DVD, though more of a compilation DVD than new material, brings together so many wonderful messages and songs that all kids and parents will enjoy!",1347235200,,663,4.26984126984127

My favorite of all time, of course, is the old classic Madame Blueberry. I've watched it so many times I can remember the lines to the Stuff-Mart song and the all-time great ""You're My Cheeseburger."" Inspired lunacy with a heart and a point. But this tale is also great.",1474416000,,485,4.705882352941177
