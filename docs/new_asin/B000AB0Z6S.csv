This one is particularly satisfying because it shows how the tables  can be turned on theieves and , ruffians and bad guys and that if you just wait, fate will make sure that everyone gets what's comming to them in the end.

It is a strong moral lesson and one that today's young people would be better off if they heard it more and more often - instead of the type of modern movies where the bad guys seem to win.

The main plot point is that a robber barron heads off to the high sees in order to avoid getting arrested for being a theif and a criminal.

Almost as soon as he is out on the water, however, pirates raid his ship and make him work for them.

He soon finds out what it feels like to have peopel steal from hiim and I sure puts some thought to how the people he stole from must have felt about his bad deeds.

There is a lot of intense pirate footage and the sea is very well shot.

I reccomend this film to anyone who wants to see a classic holywood swashbuckler film with a modern moral message.",1162771200,,1204,4.050632911392405

It's surprising because it doesn't start out as pirates. Instead a guy has to serve court papers on a sea captain, so he sneaks on board as a deckhand. But then, in a plot twist, the boat is attacked by pirates and the two guys end up fighting together against the bad guys while sailin to Hawaii. It's a ridiculous plot, but is good fun to sit down and veg out with. I liked it alot.",1148428800,,533,4.184466019417476
