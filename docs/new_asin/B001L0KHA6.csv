3676276,5,B001L0KHA6,"A wonderfull set of DVD that take us to a journey of reality about the Universe we live.
In my opinion the only negative point of ths product is that it has no subtittle, and a serie like this must have subtittles in various languages, including Portuguese.
All the schools in the world  have to have this DVDs to exib it to the fellows.",1233360000,18,337,4.265625

3676280,2,B001L0KHA6,These programs are 8th grade science at best.  The cast are over acted and the visuals (CGI) over done.  Couldnt finish the series as they became very annoying.,1436745600,,160,4.678571428571429
3676281,1,B001L0KHA6,"I viewed via Amazon Fire and Prime.  I had been elated to be able to watch ""The Universe"" and quickly added each season to my Watchlist.  I completed seasons one and two.  I viewed Episode 1 of Season 3 and started Episode 2.  A couple of days later when I next attempted to view Episode 2, I was perplexed to see in place of ""Watch Now Free. Include with Prime"" the choice of ""Watch Now for $2.99""!  I thought it was some mistake and tried again the next evening, only to find that not only would I have to purchase the episode for $2.99 or the season for $14.99, but all past episodes I had viewed now require payment.  Now I wonder what else I hope to view as ""Included with Prime"" will suddenly no longer be available unless purchased for additional charge.  I'm now leery of being able to actually view everything on my Whatchlist that is currently advertised as ""Included with Prime"".",1424390400,,890,4.390243902439025

3676290,4,B001L0KHA6,I enjoyed this season less than the previous two. The theme of the end of earth was too repetitive also I like more scientific approaches than speculations.,1419033600,,156,4.814814814814815

3676310,5,B001L0KHA6,"This is a very interesting series, but scary too.  I have always thought that it was important to learn about our Multiverse, but this series points out just what could happen when humans embark on conquest.  It seems to be the natural personality of humans to conquer viciously.  Just look at the way men act here on Earth and how the innocent suffer.  If men can't learn to negotiate then they should leave Space alone.",1404259200,,421,4.573333333333333
3676311,4,B001L0KHA6,Morgan Freeman does a great job of narrating this program and there is alway's something new to learn.  It is explained in layman's terms so that everybody can understand it.,1403568000,,174,4.8
3676312,5,B001L0KHA6,"I'd recommend this show for anyone interested in learning a little more about our Earth and what lies outside it. The shows cover a range of physical phenomena and explain the underlying science in an extremely accessible manner. Great graphics and explanations from researchers in the field add explanatory power. If you're at all curious about our planet, about space travel, about what lies in and outside our solar system, this is a good show for you.",1402012800,,455,4.922077922077922

3676315,2,B001L0KHA6,"Nice images, but overall flat and lackluster series.
Nothing compares to the original ""Cosmos"" series with Carl Sagan. This is more like a series of short clips from people who know their jobs, but completely lack the 'spark' to amaza others. Disappointed.",1400976000,,256,5.119047619047619
3676316,5,B001L0KHA6,"This is the best series I've seen for explanations of the mysteries of the universe. This is so because of the narrator and program host Brian Greene. Neil Degrasse Tyson on the new Cosmos program cannot compete in Mr. Greene's league. As a matter of fact Mr. Greene should have been appointed heir to Carl Sagan's legacy. His demonstrations of metaphorical analogs of the entire Big Bang process is the most succinct and understandable I have ever seen. I've always had trouble getting my head around the quantum physics concept of Einsteins ""spooky action at a distance"" but Mr. Greene demonstrates it very well, so well in fact I actually remembered it for about a week. If you care as I do about the creation of the universe you will love this series. I highly recommend the entire series.",1399852800,,793,4.712230215827338

3676320,5,B001L0KHA6,"He is a wonderful instructor he is well educated on his subject and this allows him to teach in a matter that makes is simplified for those of us that are not schooled about the Universe
What i did not like..They seem to have a thought that the universe will one day end .This is not in what God says, but again God says our thoughts are not like his thoughts his is much higher,seeming none of man has ever created a planet or any stars ect ectit is understandable that his thoughts are much higher. How ever it is great to see some of his creation in these programs make me wonder why mankind thinks too much of themselves.. Watch this and enjoy being impressed",1399075200,,663,4.26984126984127

3676337,5,B001L0KHA6,The Universe documentary series should win awards hands down. My family and I have learned so much about science from this series we hope for more to come. It blows away Nova and Nat Geo.,1391299200,,187,4.371428571428571

3676344,5,B001L0KHA6,"All six seasons of ""The Universe"" series are remarkable. Anyone wanting an in-depth understanding of the cosmos need look no further. That's not to say he or she shouldn't look further. This series is in the same class as the original ""Cosmos"", ""The Planets"", ""How the Universe Works"" and many Nova specials.

3676353,5,B001L0KHA6,"I love cosmology and this series is very satisfying. I wish these series would go into more detail at times by tackling more chemistry, more detail on the many scientific space missions, and just more detail. Otherwise great stuff.",1386201600,,231,4.948717948717949

If you are one that likes to know more, or has this in your area of study or expertise, it gives points to lead off with to learn more, or brush up on that of what you forget from university days...either way you cut it, it is a fun way to watch a program, better than mind numbing idiocy that fills most of our tv scheduling any more...!",1381104000,,439,4.176470588235294

I owned the first three seasons of this EPIC series on dvd and had been disappointed by the double black bars (fullscreen letterbox) presentation of this series. A quick fix was to change your zoom settings on your set or player, but this fix was quite awful in what seems to be lower than a 480i resolution.

The Blu-ray release of this series is truly wonderful in full 1920x1080 HD. This is a true widescreen release. The audio is presented in lossless 2.0 Dolby Stereo. Each Season is individually packaged in separate Blu-ray boxes.

The graphics and special effects can be and most of the time are the best of any production I have ever seen. It stands alone in comparison to anything the BBC, NOVA, The Science Channel, or The Discovery Channel has ever created.

If you are interested in a mind blowing, educational, heavily entertaining piece of eye candy, then do not pass this product up.",1268870400,43,2344,4.969387755102041
3676402,3,B001L0KHA6,"Overall the series is interesting, but it lacks in actual video and images. There is a huge supply out there, yet they rely on animation. I understand many of the things discussed are too distant, or simply haven't been caught on film, but still. Now to the theory. Almost everything discussed is theory, yet they too often treat it as fact. The episode on alternate universes is a joke. Sure, there are people that believe it, but I can't believe the way it was presented. Does anyone seriously believe that there is a doppelganger for each one of us in some other parallel universe? To say that George W. Bush may be the commissioner of baseball in another universe is absurd. Finally, they are extremely-extremely-extremely lazy in the over-use of the same animation and images that show up in many of the episodes. Despite these annoyances, there seem to be just enough nuggets of interesting things that make it worth a watch, just not sure it will get a repeat viewing.",1268352000,5,975,4.707602339181286
3676403,5,B001L0KHA6,"First, I must say that most facts given or theories discussed are as beyond my comprehension as are the distant galaxies & Black Holes, yet, most of those interviewed or those scientists that are featured on this series are American. As a teacher in the American Public School System, I often drive home from work even more cynical than when I arrived that morning. After hearing and watching many of the scientists featured on this series, I am elated and refreshed by the genius minds of the many young people in this presentation. Yes, the American Public School System is still, very much, in trouble and is what could bankrupt this country if we do not get the politicians out of the decision making processes as well as to revamp curriculum in the very same system. The Public School System caters not to the American born child, rather, plays into the hands of those children of the world, who have just come to the shores of America but speak no english and have much lower learning skills. It is a politicians dream come true and they play into their whims, day in and day out. The American born student is an afterthought and is why America now ranks approximately #37, in the world of education. You can say goodbye to any future universe series, as long as this trend continues. The Universe Series is a mind-blowing phenomenon, creatively presented, however, with, at times, far too many CG charged scenes. I believe with the photos I have viewed, which were taken from the Hubble Space Telescope, there should be fewer times when CG are needed. In any event, the Universe, in BlueRay, is something not to be missed or forgotten and should be studied by young and old. I have not seen the entire series but can emphatically state that I will be ordering the remaining episodes in the series. The one thing it did not have to offer was, Dr. Carl Sagan, a genius, a brilliant, forward thinking mind, lost to the ravages of cancer.",1268092800,,1941,4.628985507246377

""Search for ET"" and ""Beyond the Big Bang"", are the climax to the first season and the most interesting of the first season and are somewhat inexplicably missing. Where are the missing episodes?? Such a shame as this is a very interseting series and should have been a 5 star product, but due to the omitted 2 crucial parts I can only award the 1.",1267401600,33,634,4.427350427350428

The one thing that I did not find in any of the other reviews or in any of the product pictures that was a concern of mine was the size/look that this collection would have on my shelf. When I got these blu-rays in the mail I was pleasantly surprised to find that they are the 3 single packaged seasons of The Universe inside of a decorative cardboard box so if you want to leave them in the box on the shelf that would be fine or you could take them out and it would be as if you had purchased each separately (which is what I'll be doing since I'm also buying season 4 and it would look strange in my opinion to have 3 boxed and one separate). So if packaging was something holding you back from taking advantage of the price difference between buying the seasons separately or in this package deal then you can rest assured that this package is the better alternative.

For the people who said they liked or loved it, that is great! But why? Why just write saying it was woth seeing?

In my opinion this should be shown in every school in the world and people who are already grown, somehow organize a way for them to be mandated to watch the series!

Now, for the people who didn't like Season 3. Too much Science Fiction? That just up sets me!!  What was Science fiction at the dawn of the last centry in many ways became a reality. I hope you know where I paraphrased that quote from too! My Grandmother is 85 years old, she still thinks it is so amazing that you can fly across the earth in a matter of hrs and that we somehow got to the moon a few years ago.

I will agree with the comment about sex in space not being on of their best episodes, frankly I was really shocked to see that in the collection since I only watch the episodes on DVD and not when they are on TV.

Yeah there were some repeat visual affects, but if anything, it works as a great learning tool driving home the actual remember aspect and consistency of the material.

I would say to enhance Season 3, you should have watched the first 2 Seasons and have a fundamental understanding of our physical world, but idealistically everyone should watch this Season and the entire series. We need to believe in this life and the universe we currently live in and not about which god to worship or who to kill becuase people don't believe in their god....Believe in the here and now and what may come of it.

I hope you buy this Season and enjoy it as much as I did and will in the future... and yes I will mandate people closest to me in my life watch this, but many of people who I associate with have already seen the series and they are always a great conversational piece.",1262476800,5,2013,4.183462532299742

3676417,2,B001L0KHA6,"Ok.  As a scientist, I found the first 2 seasons to be quite entertaining even though the material is fairly basic (it's not meant to be for astrophysics geeks).  The show has always had alot of bang and big and bold photos, very colorful, very creative.  Then there's the third season... come on.  Sex in space?  what a crappy episode.  There is so much that we know (and don't know) about space that they can go on and on and talk about the Universe for the next 30 years...but instead they got this snoozer lame episode about popping out kids in space with very little fact and mostly just opinions and speculation.  They didn't even really bother getting into the details regarding the animal research that has been done.  I had to shut it off...couldn't finish watching that stupid episode.  And the episode which talks about neutrinos....didn't even properly define it.  Good job, professors.  If you are really trying to educate the public about space and you want to talk about particles, you should really go back to the basics of physics and talk about each particle and their importance...then talk about neutrinos.  Instead, we get a smoke-and-mirrors light show which is supposed to represent a bunch of neutrinos whizzing around.

I figure that the people watching Season 3 of The Universe have probably seen the first two seasons or if not, after watching episodes from this season, should be motivated to watch 1 and 2.  Maybe the people making the show should make it a little more sophisticated and elevate the level of complexity of the show...but instead, the show tries to oversimply abstract complex theories instead of teaching its viewers anything concrete; The Universe, our Heisenberg Multiverse of 11 dimensions, is just a cheap light show in Season 3.

3676420,5,B001L0KHA6,"A lot of animation with good narrations. 4 disks Set. Every disk 3 episodes about 45 min duration.

Disk 1

""Deep space disasters""
""Parallel Universes"" - Our co-existence in parallel dimensions
""Light speed""

Disk 2

""Sex in space"" - kinda awkward theme but gives you a thought about impossibility to develop healthy body in weightless conditions.
""Alien faces"" - like Sci Fi movie based on guesses and graphic
""Deadly comets and meteors"" - Endlessly dieing dinosaurs and continuously falling meteors on Earth, theories of evading deadly meteors.

Disk 3

""Living in space"" - Animated theories of possible life on Mars or other planets. Mars expedition preparations.
""Stopping Armageddon"" - Dinosaurs dieing ""again"" and again. Too much death the same animated poor animal.
""Another Earth"" Animated theories about possible planet like Earth

Disk 4 - is my favorite

""Strangest things"" - Animated presentation about our Solar system, Galaxies, Black wholes, Pulsars and Magnetars and so on.
""Edge of Space"" - Possibility of private flights for regular persons.
""Cosmic phenomena"" - Auroras, Gamma rays, Sprites, Elf's, Blue Jets. Last three I did not know about before watching this DVD. This is amazing lightnings which are not like regular lightnings we can see but much bigger in the Earth scale and invisible for regular eye reaction.

Good set.
I'd recommend it!",1253750400,2,1366,5.229357798165138

3676422,5,B001L0KHA6,"Very informative, educational, interesting, and fun!  The special effects and great narrative performance makes this show my favorite.  This is by far the best TV series I have ever seen.  I have watch every episode multiple times.  Another great thing about this show is that it includes some of the greatest physicist of today, such as Michio Kaku.  I highly recommended anybody who is even slightest interested in the final frontier to add this DVD set to their collection.

I especially love the episode ""Parallel Universes"".  For all open minded people, this is an episode you must see.",1248739200,11,591,4.969387755102041
3676423,5,B001L0KHA6,"I had been waiting with bated breath for this last season to come out,and I wasn't disappointed. I am also happy that they returned to the packaging they had for season one. As for the programs themselves, they are beautiful and thought provoking while explaining their concepts as clearly as possible. It is a series definitely worth having.",1247961600,2,342,4.913793103448276
3676424,3,B001L0KHA6,"As with season 2, I found this collection interesting but difficult to undergo.  The constant use of sound effects for celestial events -- which, since they take place in the vacuum of space, transmit no sound -- made me think of the Flash Gordon films of the 50s with a rocket absurdly buzzing through space. I suppose this constant aural stimulation is intended to keep the TV spectator awake and interested.  For me it is a constant source of annoyance.",1245628800,9,456,4.6875
