3418773,5,B0018RNEWA,"Great documentary about the great Joe Louis, and the very unfair treatment he received form the american government. This is a must for every Louis fan.",1410220800,,152,4.884615384615385
3418774,5,B0018RNEWA,The DVD arrived before the due date in new condition as advertised. I'd been wanting to see this documentary for a few years but wan't able to due to my job location. I'm very glad I bought it I learned things that I wasn't aware of about what was done to him by our government.,1335571200,,278,4.072727272727272
3418775,5,B0018RNEWA,"A huge fan of boxing all my life, I've known the legend of Joe Louis.  I didn't, however, know the story of Joe Louis the man and the many demons (personal, societal, and governmental) that hounded him for much of his life.  A story, brilliantly told, such as this one truly deserves a place in the AMERICAN annals.  It's a story of both love and hate.  One of many rags-to-riches stories we love to hear about in America.  The underdog who somehow, despite insurmountable odds, seems to make it in spite of his many adversities. Later contrasted by the stories we love to hate and never want to listen to or take ownership of as Americans.  By that, I refer to the myriad stories of countless persons of color who, too, are American.  The story of the average ""Joe"" who is mercilessly hounded, villified, and bamboozled by an American government that always seems to have its hand out for more at a time when no more is to be had.  We brazonly turn our backs on our one-time heroes as if to say ""...he's no friend of mine.""  We call these people crooks, bums, and bandits who simply don't want to give ""their fair share.""  One American to another...the question begs to be asked.  When is enough...enough?  The story of Joe Louis (the man in front of all those myths and legends) is one that you'll soon never forget.  It is our story.  An American story.  A story that should leave us all wondering ""...is this the way we want to be remembered for treating the befallen among us?""  God...I hope not!!!",1281830400,3,1503,4.470588235294118
3418776,2,B0018RNEWA,"Joe Louis was before my time but always been a big fan of his ..Was disappointed in this DVD ..Didn't tell
 me anything I didn't already know. HBO, producer didn't do their  homework..Left out how the  war started between
  between Joe and IRS - USO benefit fight..The original film clips were entertaining but that was about it..HBO should get another producer and do a remake ..HBO missed the boat on this one...",1261267200,,414,4.694444444444445
3418777,5,B0018RNEWA,This is a great DVD for anyone who's a boxing fan or just someone who's curious about American History.  Joe Louis was and is still one of America's great heroes.,1240790400,3,162,4.4
3418778,5,B0018RNEWA,"This documentary describes Joe Louis as the champion who knew the art and science of boxing.  It also shows how loyal and dedicated he was to his country. He donated some of his earnings or purses to the Armed Forces of the United States. He became a role model for America,and would travel the world over in which he gave boxing exhibitions free of charge. The story shows how quickly he gave and never wished for in return,but years later when he fell upon troubled times the US Government betrayed him but later relented. Very interesting story.  I recommend it for many to see.",1233792000,12,581,4.576923076923077
3418779,5,B0018RNEWA,"This is a great Bio on the great champion Joe Louis!  The content is totally engaging with intimate insight on the man by his son Joe Louis, Jr.  I first felt hurt, betrayed and then angry by the way America used this Black man (and to a certain extend, Joe allowed himself to be used) for their own means and then discarded him after he was no longer useful to America (the patriotic drum beating, etc.)!  However, in the end America redeems herself and does what is right by Joe even though most of the redeemption comes posthumously.  This is a great view!",1220918400,10,559,4.398058252427185

8270769,5,B0018RNEWA,"This is a very engaging documentary on one of our greatest heavyweights.  It's too bad its not available on instant streaming (but can be rented on NFlx).  I don't generally consider myself a gigantic boxing fan, but some of the boxing greats led very interesting lives, and thus led to very interesting documentaries....including Joe Louis' story.  Some of famous boxer's lives lend themselves to almost quasi-Shakespearian type tragedies...probably partly due to the brutal livelihood that they're involved with (though not that that specifically was the reason for Louis' later troubles).

Overall, I think this is a very important ""American"" story and tragedy that will likely leave you upset!  It's a possible microcosm on both race relations and how we treat our heroes and celebrities as soon as they start to fall from their prime.

The title is very apt, as you'll learn from watching the documentary.  (Mild spoilers)  Joe Louis felt he did what was expected of him when it came it public persona, took on the premier German heavyweight during WW2 (which likely gave our country an immeasurable confidence boost when it came to feeling we could stand against nazi ideology....and likely had a corresponding arrow to the morale of Hitler and the Nazis).  Louis also volunteered for the military in WW2, and did what he could to help less fortunate soldiers and take a stand when it came to race relations.  Yet, unfortunately in his later life the U.S. government could have been there for him....but wasn't, as this documentary describes.  In his prime Louis had an incredible athletic physique.  And while the images of Louis in has later life are somewhat sad, to put things in perspective at least he had his pick of beautiful women as ""company"" in his prime...including Lana Turner!!!

I believe there is also a Espn documentary (i.e. sports century) on Joe Louis, as well, that is similar to this...but ""America's Hero...Betrayed"" is a bit longer and more comprehensive.

This documentary also makes comparisons between Louis and the very first African-American heavyweight champ - Jack Johnson.  Also highly recommended is the PBS Jack Johnson documentary called (""Unforgivable Blackness"")!",1439596800,2,2206,5.174647887323943
