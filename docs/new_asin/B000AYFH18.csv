8080701,5,B000AYFH18,"im not really sure who puts this series together but i would like to contact them and tell them how much i enjoy them,i have the whole airplane series and the u boat one too (the grey wolves) Ive been watching documentaries on WW2 for years and i am a WW2 historian and when you watch these things there is always footage i guaranty you haven't seen before, i know they use propaganda footage a lot but its narrated very well and its that guy that has the really cool British voice i think, the narrator always saves or breaks these docos,i watch them over and over. sometimes you can find them used for considerably less. buy these if you get the chance, they are great and for those really anal people out there, you only live once, enjoy yourself and don't be so picky because there is always gonna be something WRONG every time you watch something, too slow, too long,not enough footage, the guy didn't talk right,the pictures were used before,the black and white was too white or too black etc etc",1418947200,,1002,4.451086956521739
8080702,4,B000AYFH18,"All footage is from official German wartime newsreels, but the voice-over is a more recent British narrator. The last 15 minutes is on seaplanes, flying boats, and bombing raids on ships.

We see the Bloem-Voss 238, the heaviest aircraft ever flown, with its massive shape and 6 engines, and 3000 mile range. Anti-shipping missiles, the Hs-293, were radio-controlled and launched from He-111s. You will see one explode on its target.

Highlights: Focke-Wulf 189 twin engine, twin fuselage ""Flying Eye""; Dornier 217; Ju-288, Fw-191, and He-177 Grief 4-engine bomber, all very advanced for the time but suffering from poor engines; lots of coverage of the March 1943 Battle of Kharkov, with the Germans retaking Russia's 4th largest city, with He 111s employed not only as bombers but also as ground attack aircraft. He-177 was further hampered by the requirement that it also be designed to serve as a dive-bomber. The Ju88 A4 made up half of all bombers on the Eastern Front at one point.

Other highlights: German-Italian cooperation in torpedo bombing in the Mediterranean; the He-111 as a V1 rocket launching vehicle, and a raid by 200 He-111s based in Poland against 72 B-17s from the 15th or 8th U.S. Air Force based at Poltava in the Soviet Union. Of the 72 U.S. B-17s, 44 were destroyed, 26 were damaged, and 400,000 gallons of aviation fuel was destroyed.

The theme of the bombers serving as flying artillery came up repeatedly, but bombers did find time for long range work, in the bombing of the armament works in Yaroslav and Gorky, before returning to ground-support in preparation for the gigantic Kursk Battle.

Criticism: No info on crews in these bombers. You need only watch a few minutes of the feature films 12 O`Clock High or Memphis Belle to learn that 10 men staffed the B-17. But how many flew in a Ju-88 or a He-111 or a Do-17? By the end of the war, the mighty bomber force was reduced-- the He-111 is shown transporting cargo in Russia.",1369267200,3,1963,4.813056379821958
8080703,4,B000AYFH18,"The video in this dvd is primarily compiled from German newsreels from WWII. As a result it paints quite a rosy picture of the German bomber force during this period (i.e., very positive bomber ""results"" with no losses). Nevertheless the footage is quite interesting. Most of the footage, like most of the rest of the ""War Archives"" series, is pretty much in line with actual German aircraft useage during this period. About 80-90% of the bomber footage is of JU 88 and HE 111 in operation (about the proportion of these aircraft that composed the entire German bomber force). There is also some footage of other bombers  such as the Grief and JU 188 but this is quite limited. Most of footage is the bombers being used against tactical ground targets supporting ground offensives. The little footage available beyond this includes attacks on railroads and road conveys. There is also some pretty good footage of torpedo and bomb attacks on vessels primarily in the Mediteranean. In addition, about 15 minutes of the DVD's one hour is dedicated to float planes. Not very relevant to bombers but still interesting nevertheless, especially considering how rare such footage was. Most of the sea plane footage is of aircraft operating off Norway.

Beyond the video footage, there is also some analysis of the aircraft and this is quite interesting, especially that of the less used German bombers (i.e., JU 188 and Grief) explaining why they proved so poor in operational use (primarily teething technical problems that were never overcome). This explains why the JU 88 and HE 111, despite their age and technological obsolesence, lumbered on so long in service through the end of the war.",1267488000,3,1686,4.975177304964539
8080704,2,B000AYFH18,"The worst documentry in the WW2 german series. The series of DVDS this belongs to cover in a 5 star rating the U-Boats,Tanks,and Support weapons of WW2 but when it came to doing this DVD the research was just not there nor did one learn much about German bombing missions during ww2 other than bombers were used as extended artillery. Skip this one and look for much better in the series.",1260662400,,388,4.47887323943662
8080705,5,B000AYFH18,"The format isn't 'glitzy'........ but the information in this series of DVD's is just what you want, if you want the facts. Some have the only known footage of some weapons systems ever made. The reliance on real footage, is better than the re-enactor programs that pass for 'history' shows today!",1214784000,3,297,4.8431372549019605
