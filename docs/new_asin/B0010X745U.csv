3053010,2,B0010X745U,"What I failed to remember was that each year ""The Archies"" shows changed a lot.  I was hoping to get some cartoons that maintained a story.  Or even I enjoyed the year when Archie had Dick Tracy, Broom Hilda and other cartoons on.  This particular season had neither.  It was basically Laugh-In with the Archie characters.  While these little skits that appear may of been funny at the time...today they appear as a bunch of dated short gags.  I played the first episode for my daughter and even she lost interest before one episode was done.  I wish I would picked the volume with Archie on the cover or even the Sabrina edition.  Previous reviewers give the 5 stars and I write this review to give you a different view point.

3053011,5,B0010X745U,"Archie's version of ""Laugh-in"" is a whole series of episodes with rapid-fire one-liners.  All tastefully done by the way, no dirt humor here. The video is sharp and clear and so is the audio.

The Archies perform three songs per episode which honestly don't have the high production quality of their earlier songs, but they're not bad at all.  ""Love Vibrations"" however is a classic.  I think one thing missing from this set is an audio CD of the show's songs.  You know this collector will snap it up.

The bonus feature featuring Ron Dante is worth the price.  He leaves no question unanswered about how he became ""Archie"" for Don Kirshner's music machine.  The Archies' music was just as good as anyone's during this time of the late 60's and early 70's.  They had top-notch session musicians, singers, and producers.  Jeff Barry was their main songwriter and producer and yes, ladies & gentlemen, a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame.  One mistake I noticed was the transpositioning of the names Jeff Barry and Andy Kim when they were superimposed over their images.  Jeff is on the screen's left, Andy is on the right.

Ive never seen this before so didn't know what to truly expect other than archie and the gang. This show is like a recording of real live action kids who are in a theatre like setting sitting in chiars to watch archie and his gang up on a stage/screen. Once the show starts archie and his pals dance and tell jokes and such and the view goes from archie or jughead in animation to a real live action shot of kids in chairs laughing or jumping/dancing around. I had to stop after the second episode or so just for a lil break. Almost felt like i was babysitting there for a moment lol. Still it is archie and the gang just be prepared for over excited kids on screen and lots of jokes youve prob heard years ago that haven't gotten better with time.,1388534400,2,894,4.0852272727272725
3053053,4,B0010X745U,"Archie's Funhouse, which aired in 1970, followed The Archie Show, which aired on CBS in 1969, and was itself followed by Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (1971). Each of these series is available in high-quality, official DVD sets which are far better than the numerous bootleg sets:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Archie-Show-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000P6R9O4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Archie Show: The Complete Series</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sabrina-the-Teenage-Witch-The-Complete-Animated-Series/dp/B00125WAY6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sabrina the Teenage Witch - The Complete Animated Series</a>. But whereas The Archie Show and Sabrina both consisted of animated stories, not unlike the comic books they came from, Archie's Funhouse replaced the story line with a non-stop barrage of jokes and songs, not unlike the more adult hit show, ""Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In"".

Why jokes?  One reason is that some of the writers were from Laugh-In. Another is that this was yet another variety of the numerous Archie comic books-- the laughs or jokes book. Why songs? That answer is given on the third disc, in a very long and interesting interview with Ron Dante, the singing voice of Archie (Archie's talking voice was Dallas McKennon). Dante had a going career singing jingles for the likes of McDonalds and Dr. Pepper, when he was approached by Don Kirshner, New York producer and wunderkind, to sing the lead for a band called The Archies. The rest is history, and their best-known single, ""Sugar Sugar"" sold six million copies. While they never toured, they were skilled musicians, and two members of the band played on Paul McCartney's ""Ram"" album.

The menus are very good on this three-disc set, which lists sixteen double episodes on the first two discs. The third disc is entirely considered to be ""bonus features"" for the reason that the seven episodes there, which have a bit more of a story line  (and I therefore found more enjoyable), are from The Archie Comedy Hour (1970), which later became the half-hour Funhouse. While the songs were taped in New York, the animation was done by Filmation in California, and the format is somewhat odd, with the animated Archies appearing before a live-action very young audience in the credits and throughout the show.

Other bonus features include ""Archie and His New Pals"" an animated special which aired on CBS in 1969, and ""Sugar Sugar"" and ""Jingle Jangle"" music videos with the animated Archies. There's also a feature called ""Jukebox"" on discs one and two, with a menu of over thirty Archies songs set to animated clips from the shows. While the Funhouse format was not to my taste (I would have preferred The Archie Show to have gone on forever), ""Everything's Archie"", to quote the title of the fifth Archie cartoon show from 1973 (which consisted entirely of reruns of the previous four). Archie made his comic book appearance in the 'forties, and some seventy years later the likable redhead from Riverdale shows no sign of running out of steam. I was enthralled with a relatively recent entry called ""Archie's Weird Mysteries"" (see my Amazon review)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Archie-s-Weird-Mysteries-The-Complete-Series/dp/B006WDWBK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Archie's Weird Mysteries - The Complete Series</a>.",1381449600,,3422,5.822355289421158

3053069,5,B0010X745U,"Archie's Funhouse (1970) is actually ""The Archie Comedy Hour"" (1969) on CBS, but what has been added as it was broadcast in 1970 is the Giant Jukebox of music and the ""Side Show"" with funny one-liner jokes. Sabrina might even show you a magic trick. Moose and Mr. Weatherbee also join in the fun.
  ""The Archie Show"" was an animated cartoon tv series on Saturday morning television for children. . It was based upon the teenagers who went to Riverdale High School. Archie is the nice red-head guy. Jughead is the tall, skinny best friend of Archie's who wears a hat made into a crown. Jughead loves to eat. Veronica is the brunette with a southern accent. Betty is the blond. She is in love with Archie and writes tall-tales in her diary.

  Archie comes out on stage in the theater and welcomes the excited children in the seats. Reggie is up to his practical jokes on Archie. Jughead is trying to keep his cool, but, here comes Big Ethel. Actually Ethel is skinny and a farm girl. She loves Jughead and chases after him.

After Archie and his friends entertain you and make you laugh, they will treat you to 3 songs. In the first episode, ""Love Vibrations"" ""Falling in Love is Fun"", ""I'm Just Your Puppet on a String"".
  Each episode is full of jokes and fun and you always get 3 songs.
 All 23 episodes are wholesome and pre-teens love the show. If you are an adult, you might catch herself singing some of the songs to yourself in the kitchen.

Voices of Dallas McKennon (Archie), Howard Morris, Jane Webb, John Erwin.

  The biggest hit from ""The Archies"" is ""Sugar Sugar"" and it was at the top of the charts on the radio.

  Disc One and Disc Two contain as a ""Bonus Feature"" the Giant Jukebox. All 28 songs are on the Giant Jukebox and you can chose any selection you want. The songs are digitally-remastered.

  Disc One has the ""Sugar Sugar"" music video. Disc Two has the ""Jingle Jangle"" music video.

  Disc Three: Contains 7 bonus episodes. Featurette: ""Ron Dante: The Voice of ""The Archies"" (26 mins), ""Archie and his New Pals Special"", broadcast September 14, 1969.

3053070,5,B0010X745U,"I mainly got this DVD for the ""lost"" songs that are on the bonus tracks of 2 of the 3 dvd's. I already own the 5 main albums of the Archies, but many of these songs did not make it to vinyl at the time. I guess I've always enjoyed the positive and very talented music of the Archies as long as I remember seeing them on Saturday morning cartoons. I remember as a young boy my first experience listening to an Archies' song was when I begged Mom to buy a box of Super Sugar Crisp because it had an Archies record on the back that you had to cut out. If memory serves me correct, it was the size of a 45 rpm single but had to be played at 33 1/3 rpm. Because it was on cardboard stock my parents wouldn't let me play it on the new stereo so I took the cardboard record over to a teenager's house who was a bit older than me. I'll never forget as we sat there the sound of a lead guitar started cranking out the tune ""Hide and Seek"". It hit me with an electricity I will never forget and basically introduced me the world of Rock and Roll. We were both awestruck at the energy coming from this little cardboard cutout. From that point on I was sold on The Archies. I had Mom buy me my first album of theirs ""The Archies"". Although it contained some really great songs (including 'Hide and Seek') it was missing the song 'Sugar, Sugar'. I had to have the album that contained that song too so I ended up buying The Archies' ""Everything's Archie"". I later collected ""Jingle Jangle"". I was well into my 30's before I realized there were two more albums by the Archies I had never heard. So, thanks to the internet I was able to aquire ""Sunshine"" and ""This is Love"". One of them was still sealed! All in all, this collection of 34 songs makes my collection pretty much complete as far as I know. A few of the songs are on some of the albums but most have been ""lost"" which is a shame because there are at least 12 or more I feel would have made another really great album. I guess deep down inside no matter how old I get I still believe 'everythings' Archie!",1300147200,9,2052,4.094292803970223
3053071,1,B0010X745U,"My daughter loves Archie and the gang, but absolutely hated this show. There is no plot, just the characters looking at the camera and making corny jokes. The jokes are very dated, my kids couldn't understand many of them.

By those standards, the show was high-tech entertainment, combining animation with a live children's audience, very inventive and ahead of its time.  All of the Archies gang--Archie, Betty, Reggie, Veronica, Jughead, Hot Dog, Moose, Dilton and Big Ethel--still belt out the hardy laughs as well as the songs that are reminiscent of childhood innocence gone by.

What's big about this collection is the addition of the SUGAR, SUGAR video that was scene in the original Archie Show.  That really makes my day whenever I wake up and want to put on an old cartoon instead of the same old morning newscast.",1287705600,2,691,4.830508474576271

While the songs were taped in New York, the animation was done by Filmation in California, and the format is somewhat odd, with the animated Archies appearing before a live-action very young audience in the credits and throughout the show.

Other bonus features include ""Archie and His New Pals"" an animated special which aired on CBS in 1969, and ""Sugar Sugar"" and ""Jingle Jangle"" music videos with the animated Archies. There's also a feature called ""Jukebox"" on discs one and two, with a menu of over thirty Archies songs set to animated clips from the shows. While the Funhouse format was not to my taste (I would have preferred The Archie Show to have gone on forever), ""Everything's Archie"", to quote the title of the fifth Archie cartoon show from 1973 (which consisted entirely of reruns of the previous four). Archie made his comic book appearance in the 'forties, and some seventy years later the likable redhead from Riverdale shows no sign of running out of steam. I was enthralled with a relatively recent entry called ""Archie's Weird Mysteries"" (see my Amazon review)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Archie-s-Weird-Mysteries-The-Complete-Series/dp/B006WDWBK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Archie's Weird Mysteries - The Complete Series</a>.",1381449600,,3422,5.822355289421158

3287566,5,B0010X745U,"Archie's Funhouse (1970) is actually ""The Archie Comedy Hour"" (1969) on CBS, but what has been added as it was broadcast in 1970 is the Giant Jukebox of music and the ""Side Show"" with funny one-liner jokes. Sabrina might even show you a magic trick. Moose and Mr. Weatherbee also join in the fun.
  ""The Archie Show"" was an animated cartoon tv series on Saturday morning television for children. . It was based upon the teenagers who went to Riverdale High School. Archie is the nice red-head guy. Jughead is the tall, skinny best friend of Archie's who wears a hat made into a crown. Jughead loves to eat. Veronica is the brunette with a southern accent. Betty is the blond. She is in love with Archie and writes tall-tales in her diary.

  Archie comes out on stage in the theater and welcomes the excited children in the seats. Reggie is up to his practical jokes on Archie. Jughead is trying to keep his cool, but, here comes Big Ethel. Actually Ethel is skinny and a farm girl. She loves Jughead and chases after him.

After Archie and his friends entertain you and make you laugh, they will treat you to 3 songs. In the first episode, ""Love Vibrations"" ""Falling in Love is Fun"", ""I'm Just Your Puppet on a String"".
  Each episode is full of jokes and fun and you always get 3 songs.
 All 23 episodes are wholesome and pre-teens love the show. If you are an adult, you might catch herself singing some of the songs to yourself in the kitchen.

Voices of Dallas McKennon (Archie), Howard Morris, Jane Webb, John Erwin.

  The biggest hit from ""The Archies"" is ""Sugar Sugar"" and it was at the top of the charts on the radio.

  Disc One and Disc Two contain as a ""Bonus Feature"" the Giant Jukebox. All 28 songs are on the Giant Jukebox and you can chose any selection you want. The songs are digitally-remastered.

3287567,5,B0010X745U,"I mainly got this DVD for the ""lost"" songs that are on the bonus tracks of 2 of the 3 dvd's. I already own the 5 main albums of the Archies, but many of these songs did not make it to vinyl at the time. I guess I've always enjoyed the positive and very talented music of the Archies as long as I remember seeing them on Saturday morning cartoons. I remember as a young boy my first experience listening to an Archies' song was when I begged Mom to buy a box of Super Sugar Crisp because it had an Archies record on the back that you had to cut out. If memory serves me correct, it was the size of a 45 rpm single but had to be played at 33 1/3 rpm. Because it was on cardboard stock my parents wouldn't let me play it on the new stereo so I took the cardboard record over to a teenager's house who was a bit older than me. I'll never forget as we sat there the sound of a lead guitar started cranking out the tune ""Hide and Seek"". It hit me with an electricity I will never forget and basically introduced me the world of Rock and Roll. We were both awestruck at the energy coming from this little cardboard cutout. From that point on I was sold on The Archies. I had Mom buy me my first album of theirs ""The Archies"". Although it contained some really great songs (including 'Hide and Seek') it was missing the song 'Sugar, Sugar'. I had to have the album that contained that song too so I ended up buying The Archies' ""Everything's Archie"". I later collected ""Jingle Jangle"". I was well into my 30's before I realized there were two more albums by the Archies I had never heard. So, thanks to the internet I was able to aquire ""Sunshine"" and ""This is Love"". One of them was still sealed! All in all, this collection of 34 songs makes my collection pretty much complete as far as I know. A few of the songs are on some of the albums but most have been ""lost"" which is a shame because there are at least 12 or more I feel would have made another really great album. I guess deep down inside no matter how old I get I still believe 'everythings' Archie!",1300147200,9,2052,4.094292803970223
3287568,1,B0010X745U,"My daughter loves Archie and the gang, but absolutely hated this show. There is no plot, just the characters looking at the camera and making corny jokes. The jokes are very dated, my kids couldn't understand many of them.
The best part of this cartoon is watching the horrible outfits the kids in the audience are wearing.",1291334400,2,323,4.684210526315789
3287569,3,B0010X745U,"This series is a lot different than I remember. It's Archie and the gang in a variety show format. There are plenty of schoolyard level jokes but it doesn't have the sense that the characters are having any sort of adventure. Cutting to the live kids audience reminds us that this is a period piece. I suppose if I was one of the kids in the audience I would be thrilled to posses this DVD set but unless you are really, truly a die-hard Archie fan get the first series: The Archie Show: The Complete Series (1968).",1290211200,,515,4.319587628865979
3287570,5,B0010X745U,"I was about seven years old when ARCHIE'S FUNHOUSE premiered on CBS in the fall of 1972.  By those standards, the show was high-tech entertainment, combining animation with a live children's audience, very inventive and ahead of its time.  All of the Archies gang--Archie, Betty, Reggie, Veronica, Jughead, Hot Dog, Moose, Dilton and Big Ethel--still belt out the hardy laughs as well as the songs that are reminiscent of childhood innocence gone by.

What's big about this collection is the addition of the SUGAR, SUGAR video that was scene in the original Archie Show.  That really makes my day whenever I wake up and want to put on an old cartoon instead of the same old morning newscast.",1287705600,2,691,4.830508474576271
