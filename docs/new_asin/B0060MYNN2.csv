4913687,5,B0060MYNN2,This story is wonderful and I expect to keep buying and watching for a long time.  This character Nurse Jackie is so real and so not normal but normal.  She totally fascinates me.,1356566400,13,179,4.393939393939394

4913689,5,B0060MYNN2,"Everyone is making the right choices with each season of this show.  This season was the best yet. First, there is a terrific addition to the cast, Bobby Cannavale, as the head administrator to the hospital.  He does everything that the powers that be want so he is anathema to the rest of the staff. He and Jackie mesh like oil and water but they both carry drug secrets. This season also shows Jackie doing partial rehab, being in marital war with her ex over child issues, and trying to help another addict recover, a young man. The supporting characters also have a lot going on and now everyone is likable compared to Bobby Cannavale as their boss.  The former administrator has to go back to being a nurse. The UK doctor is pregnant. This was a terrific season.  Don't miss it.

4913690,5,B0060MYNN2,"can't wait to add this season to my collection.  in this season, we see more drama, more suspense, more everything. another amazing season of an incredible show.",1352160000,11,161,4.962962962962963
4913691,4,B0060MYNN2,"I am honestly still not sure exactly how I feel about this show after four seasons, which is pretty unusual for me.  The best thing about this show by far is the extremely great actors and the well-written characters they play.  No one can deny that Edie Falco is one of the best actresses on television, and her co-stars just make her shine more.  Eve Best plays the witty and charismatic Dr. Eleanor O'Hara, Merritt Wever plays the completely hilarious and eccentric Zoey Barkow, and Joey Facinelli is the handsome but very socially awkward Dr. Cooper.  Not to mention, Paul Schulze, Stephen Wallem, Anna Deavere Smith, and the rest of the cast.  No complaints at all in casting.  Also we are joined this season by Bobby Cannavale as Dr. Mike Cruz, who plays Jackie's foil.  We also meet a new kid named Charlie this season, which takes an interesting twist.  He's by far my least favorite character, because I find his attempts of acting like a drug addicted kid weak at best.  Probably more to do with the writing than the actor.  Oh, and if Paul Schulze (Eddie) wasn't enough (he played Father Phil Intintola, a semi-""love interest"" to Carmela Soprano [Eddie Falco] in The Sopranos in season 1), Aida Turturro plays Jackie's lawyer, who was Carmela's sister-in-law, Janice Soprano, in The Sopranos as well.  Love those references.

Anyway, as far as storylines go, it DOES get soapier than ever this season.  I was HIGHLY hoping that Jackie wouldn't end up in rehab, but that's where she starts this season.  It's not a totally ridiculous, cheesy storyline, but I can't help feel like the show started out hard and is now pushing up its ""anti-drug"" propaganda at the audience.  I'm not into recreational drugs, but I don't need a television show to tell me that.  If you google ""does nurse jackie have a problem,"" read the first article and you'll have an understanding of what I mean.  Plenty of people are prescribed the amount of drugs that Jackie takes, but if you don't have a prescription - drug addict.  So, prescribed drug addict is okay?  I didn't feel like the show was being too preachy about this the first couple of seasons, but it's definitely heading there fast.  Jackie's problem is commonly referred to as when she ""uses,"" and the season finale had such a god-awful last scene and sentence cliche that I just can't shake off.  Hopefully with the change of showrunner, things can get a little less soapy and more gritty, which I think this show has true potential even still to achieve.

Regardless, this show is addictive.  It is constant, non-stop drama, and you can easily roll through this season quickly if you don't watch the time.  The writing is clever, funny, and directed well.  It's filled with a good wit and humor, but something about the show is still lacking.  I don't think the show has quite found itself yet, and hopefully it will.  It borders between incredibly dark and incredibly cheesy, which is strange.  The dark opening theme music throws me into feeling like it's a dramedy, but then the corny songs usually played at the end of the show make me feel otherwise.  It's more than just the music, but that just adds to the confusion.  Anyway, I do love the show and will continue to watch it, but really wondering where it's heading.",1346198400,3,3277,4.698245614035088
4913692,5,B0060MYNN2,"""Nurse Jackie"" just keeps getting better and better. Season Four of the show is by far the best season to date, and that's saying a lot. This season, Jackie (Edie Falco) is reeling from her breakup with Kevin and her self-admission of being a drug addict. She finally (albeit grudgingly) begins taking responsibility for her past behavior and enters rehab while fighting to retain custody of her two kids. Meanwhile, big changes are underway over at All Saints as Bobby Cannavale joins the cast as the high-strung control freak Dr. Mike Cruz, the new head of the hospital who shakes up the E.R. and becomes a major thorn in everyone's side, especially Jackie's. The supporting cast members all enjoy great storylines as well. O'Hara and Zoe make big decisions about their personal lives, Gloria and Eddie are forced to make some big changes of their own, and Thor is has some of the funniest one-liners of the season and never fails to steal the show whenever he's on screen. Perhaps the one shortcoming of the season is the show's under-utilization of Coop, who doesn't have much of a storyline this time around. Still, the other fabulous elements of this season compensate for that, in my opinion. (The character of Kevin also doesn't appear much this season, but it seems like he's being phased out, and really, who cares? He's so boring.)

The final episode of the season is the most shocking and moving episode of the show that we've ever seen. The final few moments are something that I didn't see coming, and it's unknown how everything will pan out for everyone in Season 5. I'm hoping that Cannavale returns to the show next season, as his character was unbelievably fabulous and adds a great new dynamic to everything. Applause to everyone for an awesome season...can't wait for the next one!",1339891200,20,1802,4.794212218649518

4914351,5,B0060MYNN2,"Basically this is a tv series about a nurse that is addicted to pills and other drugs. She eventually recovers, relapses, etc and it involves the live of a addict and the problems that  go with it especially when your trying to hide it from everyone, including family. Great, great showtime show!!!",1401840000,,298,4.730769230769231
4914352,5,B0060MYNN2,"I just love this series.  The characters are a lot of fun.  Even dealing with this kind of subject matter, the show manages to be mostly light and fun while maintaining a mostly real-world type aspect.  With every episode I am almost always surprised as to what can happen next in the ""insanity"" that is the main character's life and it's just really enjoyable.  I can't wait to watch the next season when I have time.  I highly recommend this series to anyone who likes medical shows with a bit of a bite or an edge to them.",1401580800,,525,4.316326530612245
4914353,5,B0060MYNN2,I love all the seasons of nurse Jackie. I am a nurse and my husband always asks me if my work is like Greys anatomy or other medical dramas and I just have to laugh. I think this is probably the closest to real life. Bitchy coworkers and peoples lives falling apart because of bad decisions that they have made. No one gets the guy every time and not every  character has a life threatening emergency on a weekly basis. I love this show...,1401494400,,439,4.226190476190476

4914355,5,B0060MYNN2,I think season 4 with it's portrayal of an overcrowded ER gives a truer reflection of what it's really like for these nurses and doctors on a daily basis. Yeah for the nurses! I think as Jackie is more comfortable in her sobriety we see her take charge in more areas of her life such as accepting that she has to get her hands dirty to keep her kids and also being willing to take a real risk in ordering more staffing in the ER. A fact known by all but not easily fixed in our current health care system.,1400630400,,505,4.06

4914376,3,B0060MYNN2,"The first three seasons of ""Nurse Jackie"" represent classic television, but Season Four makes a few wrong turns that hurt the offbeat series. Edie Falco and a stalwart ensemble do their best to overcome the occasional plot contrivances. Unfortunately, the addition of Bobby Cannavale's abrasive Dr. Cruz was a big mistake  disrupting the inspired serio-comic balance. Hopefully, Season Five will recapture the show's early brilliance.",1395014400,,434,5.676923076923077

We are big Sopranos fans so Edie Falco is an immediate draw but the other actors are all quite engaging.  the story is, as in all good t.v. shows, only slightly plausible but the episodes are interesting, funny and/or moving.  Very enjoyable watch.",1392595200,,424,4.397435897435898

Add to that pressure an unintended addiction to pain relievers (much too accessible) and you have a fairly gripping story line. Edie Falco is wonderful as Nurse Jackie. In fact the entire cast makes this whole scenario quite believable.

4914567,3,B0060MYNN2,"Nurse Jackie: Season Four
Note: mild spoilers below. You'll live.

""Nurse Jackie"" was a hard-sell to begin with for me - I heard about the show and was mistrustful of the premise, actively avoiding it for a year or so. Finally, though, I hit a slow patch in my viewing schedule and tried out Season One, and was pleasantly surprised. I was never as into it as my wife, but the acerbic lead character played by Edie Falco reminded me of some tough, grumpy, magnetic people I've known in my life, and it was a compelling portrayal.

So we followed it along from season to season and were psyched to see S4... Sadly, this season turned out to be a little bit of a dud. I liked them having Jackie straighten up and get off the pills - it actually makes her character more compelling, although I do think they could have kept her in rehab a bit longer... that angle had dramatic possibilities that so far seem unexplored... But overall, this season seemed pretty slack, and we felt deflated by the abrupt ending and the overall laxity of the season's arc. I don't think the creative team overdid anything or lost their way, the show just seems to have run out of steam.  It's possible Season Five will surprise me, and I'll certainly give it a shot, but as far as following the show forever, I'm definitely on the fence after S4.  Oh, well. (Axton)",1376524800,,1343,4.4471544715447155
4914568,5,B0060MYNN2,Love that Nurse Jackie... Excellent work writers! The story lines in this show are so interesting and believable... Keeps you right on the edge of your seat dying for more.,1376438400,,172,4.766666666666667

4914610,5,B0060MYNN2,"I could go on and on about how amazing Nurse Jackie is. However, if you're looking at season 4, you know. This season will not disappoint and the story is even better than the last three seasons. I thought I would hate to see Jackie get sober, but the new characters this revelation uncovers makes this season one of the best. I hope this show runs for a long, long time.",1375920000,5,371,4.23943661971831

4914615,4,B0060MYNN2,"Continue with Jackie's complicated, brutal personal life.  Less irritating than the end of season 3 - Zooey and Dr Cooper totally unbelievable and ridiculous rather than entertaining.  This season a little more digestible.

4914617,5,B0060MYNN2,"I liked the last season of this series although it was a shorter ten programs rather than 12.  It was something we look forward to watching as both people in my house have medical backgrounds and an interest in alcohol and drug addiction.. The topic is timely as there are many, many health care workers who are addicted to drugs and can manipulate the hell out of everything and everyone to get their drugs.",1374710400,2,408,4.513513513513513
4914618,5,B0060MYNN2,"I got into nurse Jackie when it first started and loved it but as the show progressed I really started to hate nurse Jackie's character.

For these reasons:

1.shes a hypocritical bitch

2.she never faces real consequences for her actions.

3. The way she treats Eddie

Now Season four finally puts Jackie in her place I won't spoil it for you but trust me you will be satisfied. And I actually started to like Jackie again. But the main reason I watch this show now is to watch Zoey  who is the best thing of about the show.

Season 4 is the best of the series so far.

The addition of Bobby Cavinalle as Dr Cruz really added Zest to this season and the back and forth and sparing between Edie Falco and Bobby Cavinalle is an Acting Fans Dream though it still doesnt compare to the team of Edie and the late James Gandolfini(but then again, what would?). Jackie's battle with sobriety and the consequences of her actions is the focus of the fourth season and her journey to finding herself makes for very compelling storytelling and the writers did a fine job with that! I also enjoyed the journey of all the other characters with each of them growing despite their own set of problems! I enjoyed every single episode of this season and I cannot wait for Season Five!

was the best season yet.  I cried at the end.  Loved, loved, loved it!  Other people reviewing might say that they are straying away from
what the story was originally about, a nurse dealing with her drug habit and trying to live a decent life.  She is still dealing with her drug habit, just in a different way.  I think it is good that the writers are concentrating on her improvements instead of more disaster that can happen to her.

4914921,3,B0060MYNN2,"SPOILERS This is still a good season. But i have to say the change the way the show end( doing a 180 having Jackie sober) is kind of a slap in the face to the series.

I  really think the show Jumped the shark.

Nurse Jackie is a functional addict. Thats what the show should have been doing. We were rooting for a woman staying on painkillers for her back. She was sacrificing herself for her kids..
Season 4 turned everything around. Plus her marriage ended. I miss the older jackie....

Plus Zoey was better in the past as well. She was funnier... Shes still good. but better in the past. I liked the only Zoey unsure of herself who barely got along with Jackie

Now the 2 are living together and she is alot more sure of herself... like i said total 180.

Plus Its depressing a little. Gloria and Eddie got fired. Jackie gets fired at the end.
each episode is under 30 minutes long.. That didn't give us much screen time to get to know each of these characters before we turned the show UPSIDE DOWN!

It was a very bad move on the creators/writers part. They should have attempted this in season 6 or 7... NOT 4.

I think the series is going down hill.

If anyone has any questions about this please don't be afraid to ask me. I'd be more than happy to answer any and all of them.",1364428800,4,1284,4.208163265306123

If I wanted to watch commercials, I would watch broadcast TV.  These guys want you to pay to see the other shows they sell.  This DVD has more promotions than a NASCAR driver's jacket.  AND there are fewer shows than their previous seasons.  All in all, I would not buy this again, and suggest you get your Jackie fix from an internet video streaming service.

Typically when new characters are introduced into a series it detracts from or means the series is fading toward cancellation. This is not the case with Nurse Jackie season 4.

The writers of this series go beyond any award-winning TV show that I've seen in years. Kudos to Showtime. Elie Falco is unstoppable. I so appreciate how every character grows wings and begins to soar high above their issues, challenges and situations. Cruz is masterfully portrayed by Bobby Cannavale.

If you haven't watched Nurse Jackie at all, please start at the beginning. Watch until the end of season 4. You will not regret it. One of the best shows ever.",1363651200,,754,4.661654135338346

Things are bad and getting worse every day....

My wife and I are addicted to Nurse Jackie and Edie Falco plays the roll to her maximum potential.  She is the kind of woman and nurse that you want to love, hate and then adore again.  Jackie is trapped with her drug habit and the constant lying that she does to cover-up her personal, work and family problems.  This is a good show and we have learned to like all of the characters in the show.  It is funny, sad and real to life and that is what keeps you attracted and entertained while you watch the series.

4915138,5,B0060MYNN2,"I loved Nurse Jackie and this season did not disappoint.  As with all the AMC shows there is a long wait between seasons, and if you have no cable tv, well the wait is insufferable!

I must admit, I watched the entire season in one sitting--a cold rainy day of course!

I love that Amazon lowers the price until they can get it to you and give you an update as to when it might arrive--it made it a bit more barable...............but so worth it..........Season 5!",1362096000,,464,4.372093023255814

The story lines centers around Jackie working in a hospital...the things that go on and happen are quite believable...It totally worth the $...I can't wait until the next season....Other DVD that one may want to see is ""Weeds"".....",1361923200,,390,4.75

It is full of OMG and will keep you laughing, grabbing for a tissue, and cheering for Nurse Jackie and a fabulous supporting cast .  No spoilers here except Season Four continues to emphasize the ups and downs of life - a slice at a time.  Hurry up Season 5!

4915194,5,B0060MYNN2,"I have enjoyed Edie Falco's acting since she played Carmela Soprano. I have even seen her perform live in Frankie and Johnnie in the Claire De Lune. Season 4 of Nurse Jackie shows Jackie dealing with her drug addiction, in and out of rehab. After her husband walks out on her for her addiction and the exposure of her affair with fellow employee, Eddie, Jackie struggles with losing custody of her daughters. She fights to stay clean. At work she battles with the new head of the hospital and still fights for patient's rights. Season 4 is worth your time, whether you purchase the packaged DVD or as I did with Amazons' Instant Vidoes.",1361404800,,636,4.587719298245614

Who would call an hour show of 5 episodes a season? I wouldn't.
So, yes 24.99 is a little steep for so little actual play time, so I nicked off a star.",1361318400,11,225,4.136363636363637
4915198,4,B0060MYNN2,"A big improvement over the stagnant Season Three, these ten episodes of ""Nurse Jackie"" benefit from some much-needed changes as the writers attempt to shake things up for our titular heroine--both personally and professionally.

**NOTE** SPOILERS AHEAD

Finally admitting she's got a problem, Jackie enters rehab and tries to play by the rules as for as long as she can. Look for the wonderful Mary-Louise Wilson (""One Day at a Time"") as a cussing octagernarian during this story arc. Testing Jackie's commitment to stay clean is the fact that there's trouble at work and not only is her marriage on the rocks but she's in danger of losing her kids.

All Saints gains an ambitious but power-tripping new administrator/doctor (Bobby Cannavale) which bumps Gloria Akalitus back on the floor as just another nurse. O'Hara's preganancy figures largely this season but unfortunately this story arc makes the imbecilic Dr. Cooper (my least favorite character) even more annoying than usual--not to mention the fact for some reason Dr. Cooper is sporting more eyeliner than Alice Cooper all season long.

There's some twists here and there but nothing too surprising. The show's still not as good as it was Season 1 but this is an improvement over last year. The tension between Jackie and her new boss really made for some great dramatic moments. The show's at its best when Jackie defies authority to do things her way.

FOUR STARS.",1361232000,,1427,5.0042194092827
4915199,5,B0060MYNN2,"This season is also good.  Jackie's character remains mostly the same, but she is encountering some realizations that the world does not just revolve around her.  We will see what she does with it in a later season.  Not sure what the new management team is adding.",1361232000,,265,4.595744680851064

4915201,1,B0060MYNN2,Was very disappointed by this season. Hated dr Cruz character. But worst of all hardly any dr cooper scenes.  I am a big fan of that character and the Cruz one took all his screen time. Not much to this season either. Very sorry I bought this season. Will stick to the first three and hope season 5 will be better especially More dr. Cooper! Will be getting rid of this worthless season.,1360886400,,387,4.301369863013699

8490519,5,B0060MYNN2,"This show is very funny.  I've seen all seasons, but I don't want to share the ending with you.  Like I said the series has a lot of really humorous parts to it.  The subject of her addiction starts out slowly.  I don't know if any of you have experienced addiction either for yourself or someone close to you.  As the show continues, the seriousness of addiction finally comes into play.  The character is a genius at protecting the fact of her addiction and continuing it despite interventions.  I am a recovering addict myself, so this show really hit home for me and was very sobering as the series progressed.  I have to say though that it did give me a ton of laughs.  Nurse Jackie is an opportunity to have some laughs, but also learn something about life.",1483315200,,763,4.431654676258993
