8621300,3,B00G7QQ4J2,"The sound quality was disappointing.  I had to turn up the volume and then the quality was tinny and abrasive.  As for the story, it's extremely dated, of course.  Carny barker and girly-show dancer go for the big-time in NYC.  The relationship between Lupe and Lee's characters is volatile with the occasional smack across the face.  This is presented as somewhat acceptable, hot-blooded bursts of manly indignation.  It makes it hard to like the movie.  Its redeeming quality is the ""Carpenter"" song & dance routine by Lupe Velez.  It's racy and delightful.  And Lee Tracy is terrific even if his character is creepy.",1445731200,2,619,4.932038834951456
8621301,5,B00G7QQ4J2,"I first became aware of Lupe Velez (1908-1944) when the 1932 comedy ""The Half Naked Truth"" (great title) was broadcast on Turner Classic Movies three years ago.
It was love at first sight.

Lupe plays a carnival side-show dancer who tries to go legit with the help of scheming boyfriend/manager Lee Tracy.
Funny film with lots of pre-code humor
(everyone thinks Eugene Pallette is a eunuch.)
Very revealing costumes for Lupe.

Check out the orchestra conductor at Lupe's Broadway debut.
He is legendary composer Max Steiner, one year before he revolutionized film music with the score for ""King Kong"", and seven years before he won the Academy Award for ""Gone With the Wind"".

Fascinating woman.
Engaged to Gary Cooper, she dumped him for Johnny Weismuller (Tarzan).
I have a major crush on a woman who committed suicide in 1944.
Can't help it.
