3046974,2,B00104Z86Q,"If this is the best of the Tom Tyler movies, I hate to think how bad the others are. The film needs a competent director.",1419206400,,121,3.88
3046975,3,B00104Z86Q,"This is a B western. It was meant to run with another B western on Saturday afternoons along with cartoons and a newsreel and, maybe, a somewhat bigger flick. It had no academy intentions; it was there to get kids into the theater and out of their parent's hair. Those of us in that generation enjoyed it for what it was. Seems to be nitpicky to rate it not as s movie but because someone did or did not have an uncredited extra role. Look, like the movie, Don't like the movie. Rate the movie.",1408838400,,494,4.2105263157894735

It is Jean Carmen who stars in this film and not both actresses as the product description states. Do not buy this film on the basis that the great Miss Arhur is in it as I almost did!",1200441600,5,300,3.8548387096774195

8237069,2,B00104Z86Q,"A 1935 ""talkie"" Western with the look and feel of a ""Perils of Pauline"" silent flic.  These kinds of films were generated by the dozens and . were the ""B"" movies of their day.  Extremely low budget, it's clear that the director's job was to minimize waste and cost, getting the film in the can as quickly as possible.  The cinematography, direction and sets are all very cheap.  There's not enough plot to write home about. The Amazon description is completely unrealistic.",1498521600,,473,4.7317073170731705

8237071,1,B00104Z86Q,"Boring, OK if your only interested in old westerns, but not if you've seen good ones. Interesting snapshot of the era, morals/how to make a show/what a show should be, etc etc. Just too many really good ones out there.",1484524800,,218,4.475
8237072,2,B00104Z86Q,If your an oldie movie buff this might appeal.  Did not care for the story line or portrayal of main character.,1483315200,,111,4.285714285714286
