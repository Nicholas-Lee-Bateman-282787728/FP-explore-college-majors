1779272,5,B00006JDSE,"There is an entire series of ""Civil War Minutes"" and each one focuses on a main theme.  I am an American Civil War buff  and I happened on this series by chance.  They are very well done and they are historically accurate.  The running time is about an hour, give or take a few minutes, but they are well worth your time.  If you are interested in the American Civil War or just history in general you will find these well worth your time.",1427328000,,439,4.178571428571429

1779275,3,B00006JDSE,"I really enjoyed this documentary.  Why only 3 stars?  Well, despite the fact that these films are some of the most informative documentaries I've ever seen, they make no sense.  The way they are formatted is all kinds of crazy.  For example, in Confederate Vol. 2, they go in to great detail about Col. Robert Johnston and his career from West Point to the end of the war.  Then the next section is all about the Confederate Richmond Rifle.  There was no segue, no bit of info to tie them together.  This is rampant throughout these documentaries.  Michael Kraus also could use some practice in front of a camera as he is quite flat and monotone.

On the other hand, as I said before, these have more information than just about any other documentary I've ever seen.  The narrator is pretty good, with the exception of Kraus, the info is all spot on, and you can tell that a lot of love and work went in to them.

The bottom line is, watch these docs.  The subject matter is what is most important, and these films have an incredible wealth of information.  While a little dry (no problem for me, I like to read encyclopedias!), they are totally worth a watch and I would recommend any of these to Civil War buffs and laymen alike.",1420502400,,1232,4.4222222222222225
