2693362,5,B000KLQUT4,"Surprisingly this was almost as enjoyable (I won't say ""good"") as I remembered it! The tempo is high. McGoohan becomes comfortable with the role of John Drake after a while and the stories are only slightly more silly than a lot of modern stuff. Black and white suits the mood and John Drakes occasional dry commentaries add just a tiny touch of ""noir"". McGoohans high ethical standards shine through and, in my opinion, contributes favourably to the generally pleasing caracter of this series.

2693393,5,B000KLQUT4,"Well written, well acted and more enjoyable than I expected. I don't remember watching it when it was on TV, but I enjoy many of the British series so I decided to invest in it.

There were so many clever spy accessories John Drake had at his disposal that it was rather fun to see what would turn up in the next episode. John Drake is a great character, owing to the expertise of Patrick McGoohan's many skills in portrayal of the character, his ability to convince the producers to allow him to shape the character, and his knowledge of how each episode was best developed.

I really preferred the half-hour episodes mostly because they were faster paced, but the hour long ones often were more involved and never really disappointed me. The only criticism I have is about the audio. As other reviewers have mentioned, it needed to be played at maximum volume. Especially in scenes where Drake had to speak quietly so the villains couldn't' overhear the conversation. I really don't think this is the fault in the manufacturer's production. I think the problems were in the locations used for filming since much of it was done on location rather than in-studio. As for the overly-loud volume at the opening of each show, that was not unusual for lots of shows, since it was a way to get attention to the show starting and getting folks planted in front of the tube. Ratings are still all-powerful in TV land.

There is also a very insightful interview with McGoohan's oldest daughter on the last disc which is really a great bonus of the set.",1479686400,4,1544,4.607272727272727

2693398,3,B000KLQUT4,"Odds are you won't like this show.  Odds are even greater you won't like this set of recordings of this great show.

I'm disappointed that none of these disks seems to feature the Johnny Rivers theme song (from the U.S. repackaging as ""Secret Agent""), even in the disk menu bumps.  This is very strange, as previous DVD sets of the show (I rented disks from Netflix when they were still worth dealing with) had the American theme at the beginning of each disk (although not at the beginning of each episode).

The sound quality on these disks is very poor.  Even with the volume turned to full, much of the dialogue is unintelligible, even while the background noise is intolerably loud and distorted.  There is no subtitle feature, at least on the season one episodes.  And, yes, it's deplorable to have to enable English subtitles on English-speaking programs, but it's an effect I and many others younger than I am are encountering more and more frequently as the quality of actors and producers diminishes.  No snub against McGoohan, who is a consummate actor.  It's the quality of the reproductions to which I object.

Danger Man is a great show which still holds up fifty years later.  Just a shame this set of recordings is not up to the high standard of the show itself.",1473465600,5,1278,4.660714285714286

2693433,5,B000KLQUT4,"DVD specific review:
This DVD collection rolls up the entire Danger Man / Secret Agent series, including both the 1960 series and the 1964 series. It's the whole kit & caboodle. Of the 3 volumes in the set, Volume 1 contains the 1/2 hour, one season 1960 series. Volumes 2 and 3 contain the one hour, three season 1964 series.

I found two bonuses in the set so far. There is an interview with Patrick McGoohan's daughter; Catherine McGoohan. She has some interesting things to say about her father, including a reveal that he was a championship boxer in school. That tends to explain how he was able to do many of his own fight scenes in the series. The interview is on the last disk of Volume 3.

Another bonus is a handful of commentary tracks scattered throughout the volumes. There are a few, quite possibly never revealed before, Danger Man tidbits to be picked up. Take for example a 1960 series episode entitled ""The Nurse"" (Volume 1, Disc 5). Director Peter Graham Scott, and writer Brian Clemens narrate the episode and we hear that although Clemens wrote the script, he shared writing credits with the show's creator Ralph Smart. Apparently Smart received royalties from any episode he wrote, so in addition to the episodes he wrote outright, he would at times take a script written by someone else, touch it up a bit, and take co-credit. Who knew?!

I've also found commentary tracks for ""View from the Villa"" (Volume 1, Disk 1), and ""Affair of State"" (Volume 1, Disc 2). There may be others.

No captions/sub titles for this collection. Not sure if any prior release had them. ??

Here now is a general review I've posted to other Danger Man releases listed on Amazon:

Danger Man vs I Spy
If you've never watched the ""Spy TV"" of the 60s you are in for a treat. Two of the more serious endeavors in the television realm was the American based 'I Spy' series, starring the inimitable Bill Cosby and the show's co-creator Robert Culp, and the British based 'Danger Man' series (known as 'Secret Agent' in America) starring the enigmatic Patrick McGoohan. Spinoffs such as The Avengers, Get Smart, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., and The Saint were a bit more tongue-in-cheek entrees to say the least. Mission Impossible was a serious drama but not quite in the same vein as I Spy and Danger Man. These two shows were true contemporaries (although the temporal overlap was minor), and comparing I Spy to Danger Man helps ferret out the strengths of both shows. Each series is well worth viewing.

To set a context, Danger Man came out in 1960. It was pre-James Bond, pre-I Spy, and pre-most anything else in the genre. Danger Man, which began life as a  hour production and later morphed into a 1 hour show in 1964, launched the first of the solo, lone wolf-esk, righter-of-wrong characters with that all important ultra-cool substrate. 6'2"" consummate actor Patrick McGoohan IS secret agent John Drake. Just as Peter Falk fully embodied 'Columbo' (a show that received both McGoohan and Culp as guest stars) it is impossible to imagine anyone other than McGoohan in the John Drake role. As with I Spy's Kelly Robinson & Alexander Scott, Danger Man's Drake traveled the world, engaging in high intrigue across other lands and within other cultures.

And it is the traveling element that let's us draw our first distinction between I Spy and Danger Man. I Spy was shot on location! With few exceptions, Danger Man was shot in the studio, with stock footage of other countries cleverly blended in. But I Spy was truly shot on location. They actually took the crew to Italy, to Greece, to Spain and to Asia. When you're watching I Spy you are getting a glimpse of what it looked like around the world in the 60s. In my view this is one of the best reasons to go through the series. It is 'boots on the ground' realism as we follow Robinson and Scott on their world-wide adventures.

Having said that, I have to be quite frank and point out that I Spy does not hold up as well as Danger Man. Danger Man (both the  hr and 1 hr versions) had very tight scripts, thanks in large part to the constant involvement of the show's creator (and writing contributor) Ralph Smart, as well as strong input from McGoohan. This may be hard to believe but I don't think I've ever seen a bad Danger Man. I Spy on the other hand sprouted a few stinker episodes. There is one reason for this; weak writing. Robert Culp actually discusses the show's writing in the commentary track he recorded for several episodes. The concept of I Spy was great, with Culp and Cosby adeptly pulling off the playful banter that was the substrate of the show. But the thing was, the writers often didn't get it. They often wrote *under* the show (scripts were often loose and full of plot holes) as opposed writing to what Culp/Cosby were capable of executing. If you are a ""cross the Ts and dot the I's"" kind of viewer some of the I Spy episodes are nearly unwatchable.

However, the chemistry of Culp and Cosby, the locations shooting with its voyeuristic look at the 60s is without compare. I don't think I'd buy the whole series, but there are some great episodes (with specific recommendations from other reviewers). Conversely, I do have the entire Danger Man series. If you check it out don't overlook the earlier  hr series. It is surprisingly well done. They somehow managed to contain an integral story arc in that 28 or so minutes. The intro of this first series also has a very Bond-like McGoohan introducing himself as ""Drake .... John Drake"". This, two years before Sean Connery introduced himself as Bond ... James Bond in Dr. No!

The last contrasting feature I can think to bring up is the use of firearms. Patrick McGoohan, who was a very moral man and had a heavy influence on the John Drake character, rarely used a gun. He wanted a family show, with minimal violence and sex. Drake was all about brains over brawn, and thanks to great writing the gun element is not missed. Scott and Robinson are more conventional spys and are rarely caught not packing. The pair are somewhat discreet with their use of unnecessary gun play however, so I would say this difference in the shows is less about any I Spy violence and more about the extra work required by the Danger Man writing staff to get Drake out of a jam without the quick and easy plot device afforded by a gun.

Music-wise I Spy and Danger Man are on similar footing, with memorable scores for both series. The 1960-62  hr Danger Man has a punchy, jazzy theme, with an even punchier theme accompanying the 1964-66 1 hr version (sold in the USA as Secret Agent, with the unforgettable Johnny Rivers theme). I absolutely love the I Spy theme as well, which rests nicely on the opening visuals where Kelly Robinson, in the blink of an eye transforms from a racket swinging tennis bum to an armed spy, taking the shot, and disappearing through the doorway formed by the upper case ""I"" in the title. So, a total of four themes... all of them winners (as is true of so many 60s TV shows).

ps - Given the claim made about Danger Man being one of the first spy dramas with a super cool agent, it should be noted that a production of Ian Fleming's 'Casino Royale' was aired in the 1950s on live TV in America. You can find this short but excellent production included in the extras on the DVD for the 1967 parody version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale/dp/B00005JL0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale</a>&nbsp;starring Peter Sellers. In another interesting parallel between John Drake and James Bond, the Bond in this 50's production is an AMERICAN working for the CIA. Likewise the early Danger Man series had John Drake also portrayed as an American, albeit working for NATO. All subsequent Drake/Bond characters were of course British.",1449532800,9,7836,4.691411935953421

2693436,5,B000KLQUT4,"Clearly this is a five star series -- brilliant scripts and actors -- simply top notch. Beautifully directed -- never a dull moment. Riveting. Plausible. Rewarding.

Image quality.  Originally filmed on 35mm B&W film (the last two episodes in color), the DVD set looks exemplary. I held off for years for a Blu-ray release but that never happened. Still, once the episode begins, I am simply absorbed by the story.

Audio quality.  Dialog is clean and clear and never buried in the mono mix. The only issue here is volume. You'll need to keep it down for most of the menus and then dial it up for the episodes. You get used to the procedure quickly.

Closed captions.  None. Zero. Zip. Nada. What were they (not) thinking? Apparently this absence is consistent throughout A&E's various repackaging -- no expense was spared in this department.

Extras. Minimal slides of McGoohan's biography and filmography and promo stills. Repeated on each disc.

Menus. Once you hit the Secret Agent era, the menus play, repeatedly, an incomplete version of Johnny River's song -- irritating. They should have it play once, if that, and then go to silence. Again, irritating. Did I mention it's irritating? Well, it is.

Content. This series had been re-packaged at least three times. Actual content is reportedly the same with only a change of covers.

Packaging. Two discs per slim case. Works well and certainly more compact than the release which preceded it.

Summary.  Action, adventure, suspense, drama. Taut stories played out well. It's all here. All those glowing reviews here on Amazon are understatements. Patrick McGoohan is a force of nature and this series is absolutely first rate and bears repeated viewing. Highly recommended!

2693455,4,B000KLQUT4,"If you're like me, you knew about and watched The Prisoner before this show, but you never watched it because, well, you had no interest in a 60's spy show.  However, my curiosity got the best of me finally and I decided to rent the first season from Netflix.  As soon as I started watching it, I got hooked.  The first season are half-hour shows, and they're the most economical shows I've ever seen.  These shows are extremely fast-paced and you have to pay attention to everything, but they're so much fun to watch and I got addicted.  So, seeing that Netflix didn't have the rest of the series, I bought this set.

The rest of the series are hour-long shows, and unfortunately the quick pace of the shorter episodes is replaced by a more even pace.  Unfortunately, depending on the episode I felt the length of the episode and I was a little disappointed.  That's not to say there aren't great episodes later on, it's just that some episodes feel a little long.

Other than that, it's a very enjoyable series.  If you're into gadgets, there's a bunch of them in here, all very realistic looking, unlike what you see in the James Bond series.  In fact, this show is the antithesis of the Bond movies, and John Drake is a more interesting character than Bond anyway.  Also, it's prime McGoohan, who's eminently watchable and quotable.  Try it out, but make sure you watch a mixture of episodes from all the seasons so you can get a better idea for the feel of the show.",1436313600,6,1471,4.484962406015038

2693459,5,B000KLQUT4,"Most people remember the Secret Agent tv series as the summer replacement series run Saturday nights by CBS with the great Johnny Rivers theme song.  When this show premiered in the summer of '65, the James Bond film series was taking off and The Man from U.N.C.L.E. was starting to soar.  I watched and loved it from the start and along with The Saint, it remains my favorite British tv series.  When the hour series were released on DVD, I purchased all of the sets. (Interesting that the second summer of Secret Agent was replaced on CBS by another spy series some of us remember: Mission: Impossible.)
However, most people do not remember the half-hour episodes run in the U.S. under the title ""Danger Man,"" (the British title of the hour episodes as well.)  I have a vague memory of watching those half-hour episodes with my father (and I actually do have the comic book Dell published from this series.)  It was to get these half-hour episodes that I purchased this set and I have not been disappointed.  It is amazing what good stories they could get into an episode running a little more than 20 minutes.  (I saw an excellent one the other day guest-starring a young Donald Pleasance and Lois Maxwell, 2 years away from becoming the first Miss Moneypenny in the James Bond series.)
Anyway, the half-hour Danger Mans are very good. (Interestingly, McGoohan as John Drake appears to be an American working for NATO in these episodes.  In the hour episodes Drake is the British agent we all remember.)
The one extra feature is an interview with the late McGoohan's daughter, Catherine.  We learn what a very serious actor and a moral man he was.  (I've read this a lot over the years.  Some liked him, some did not.  I once read an interview with a British actress that appeared on many series of the time and worked with McGoohan on The Prisoner and absolutely loathed him.)
This is an excellent set and worth getting for both the half-hour episodes and the classic hour Secret Agents.  Quality seems fine.",1432512000,,2012,4.665722379603399

2693465,5,B000KLQUT4,"I have to confess that I'm writing this review without having watched all of the episodes in this great DVD set!

If another reviewer were to admit to not watching a DVD set before reviewing it, I'd jump all over him or her (""How can you possibly review something you haven't even seen???"", etc., etc.). So be it--I'm guilty as charged. But I've relaxed my rule for one simple reason: ""Danger Man"" is so darned good that I just couldn't wait until I worked my way through the entire series to post a review. Who knows, it may go out-of-print soon, and I definitely want to encourage others who may be unfamiliar with the series to buy it while the set is still available.

The episodes I've watched so far are trim, tidy, well-crafted short stories that perfectly capture the spirit of the times when they were made--the early- to mid-1960s. We're talking the original Avengers and early James Bond period here. I'm not sure which was the influencer and which was the influencee, but ""Danger Man"" grabs ahold of the ""secret agent"" genre of the 1960s and never lets go. As icing on the cake, the production values for the black-and-white shows are truly outstanding, with crisp, contrasty video and easily understood dialogue. This is a great-looking series for its time, or for any time.

I don't remember ever seeing the series when it aired as ""Secret Agent"" in the U.S., which is a bit surprising, because I never missed an episode of ""The Avengers"" when it aired at around the same time. Yes, I had a pubescent crush on the lovely Diana Rigg as Mrs. Emma Peel--as did millions of other teenage boys, I'm sure. Anyway, the positive reviews posted here made me as anxious to pick up this set as any release in recent memory.

I was not disappointed, and you won't be either. Now put this set in your Shopping Card and get ready for many, many hours of sheer retro pleasure. Oh, and if by any chance you don't have an MP3 of Johnny Rivers' iconic ""Secret Agent Man"" to get you in the mood, you should pick that up as well. Enjoy!",1428105600,4,2030,4.508152173913044

2693489,5,B000KLQUT4,"When Secret Agent came to America back in 1965, I was 13 1/2 years old and my brother was 18.  Our parents were very much into bowling at the time and would leave us at home on league nights.  Like most American households in 1965, we had one television.  So, when we boys were left at home we would fight over what to watch on TV.  There was no remote to fight over, we had to physically turn the knob of the television tuner.

My brother and I knew that we might be attacked by the other while turning to the channel we wanted to watch, and occasionally such an attack would interrupt our turning of the tuner knob resulting in landing on a channel neither of us intended.  One night when the tuner landed on an unintended channel we heard the familiar voice of Johnny Rivers.  We stood frozen as we watch the intro to Secret Agent.  Wow!  We watched the episode together and we both agreed that it was very cool.

I purchased the 2010 A&E set a couple of years ago.  This Christmas I gave my brother the new Shout! Factory/Timeless Media set.  He has already watched the first and second seasons.  We still agree, as we did back in 1965 that Secret Agent is -- very cool!

I was quite young and loved it. It made an impression that has lasted. When Secret Agent was on TV back then, I was there to watch to hear the Johnny Rivers theme song starting: ""There's a man who lives a life of danger...""

After many years I was thrilled when I found this set of the entire series. When I watched it I was not disappointed. I was surprised how very well it held up over time.

I like that Patrick McGoohan's John Drake character used his mind and strategy more than guns and violence. Yes, the occasional fight and gunshot, but more the exception than the rule. Clever disguise and misdirection gave simple solutions to difficult situations. It was a time when smart and clever was favored over violence and explosions.

When thinking about the technical quality of the video I think it's important to allow for when it was made. By today's high definition and digital world it will seem crude. I take those artifacts as a reminder of that time; as part of the context needed to appreciate the series.

Earlier shows (the Danger Man episodes) are for 30m airing but the later (Secret Agent) ones were for 1h airing (if commercials were included). The last two episodes are in color which was both delightful and makes those two seem a little jarring after watching the rest in B&W.

The original batch of 39 half hours, are straight forward, fast paced dramas, followed after a two year gap by hour stories with more plot development.

2693526,5,B000KLQUT4,"If you've never watched the ""Spy TV"" of the 60s you are in for a treat. Two of the more serious endeavors in the television realm was the American based 'I Spy' series, starring the inimitable Bill Cosby and the show's co-creator Robert Culp, and the British based 'Danger Man' series (known as 'Secret Agent' in America) starring the enigmatic Patrick McGoohan. Spinoffs such as The Avengers, Get Smart, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., and The Saint were a bit more tongue-in-cheek entrees to say the least. Mission Impossible was a serious drama but not quite in the same vein as I Spy and Danger Man. These two shows were true contemporaries (although the temporal overlap was minor), and comparing I Spy to Danger Man helps ferret out the strengths of both shows. Each series is well worth viewing.

To set a context, Danger Man came out in 1960. It was pre-James Bond, pre-I Spy, and pre-most anything else in the genre. Danger Man, which began life as a  hour production and later morphed into a 1 hour show in 1964, launched the first of the solo, lone wolf-esk, righter-of-wrong characters with that all important ultra-cool substrate. 6'2"" consummate actor Patrick McGoohan IS secret agent John Drake. Just as Peter Falk fully embodied 'Columbo' (a show that received both McGoohan and Culp as guest stars) it is impossible to imagine anyone other than McGoohan in the John Drake role. As with I Spy's Kelly Robinson & Alexander Scott, Danger Man's Drake traveled the world, engaging in high intrigue across other lands and within other cultures.

And it is the traveling element that let's us draw our first distinction between I Spy and Danger Man. I Spy was shot on location! With few exceptions, Danger Man was shot in the studio, with stock footage of other countries cleverly blended in. But I Spy was truly shot on location. They actually took the crew to Italy, to Greece, to Spain and to Asia. When you're watching I Spy you are getting a glimpse of what it looked like around the world in the 60s. In my view this is one of the best reasons to go through the series. It is 'boots on the ground' realism as we follow Robinson and Scott on their world-wide adventures.

Having said that, I have to be quite frank and point out that I Spy does not hold up as well as Danger Man. Danger Man (both the  hr and 1 hr versions) had very tight scripts, thanks in large part to the constant involvement of the show's creator/producer (and writing contributor) Ralph Smart, as well as strong input from McGoohan (and with several episodes directed by Peter Yates, who directed Steve McQueen in Bullitt!). This may be hard to believe but I don't think I've ever seen a bad Danger Man. I Spy on the other hand sprouted a few stinker episodes. There is one reason for this; weak writing. Robert Culp actually discusses the show's writing in the commentary track he recorded for several episodes. The concept of I Spy was great, with Culp and Cosby adeptly pulling off the playful banter that was the substrate of the show. But the thing was, the writers often didn't get it. They often wrote *under* the show (scripts were often loose and full of plot holes) as opposed writing to what Culp/Cosby were capable of executing.

However, the chemistry of Culp and Cosby, the locations shooting with its voyeuristic look at the 60s is without compare. I don't think I'd buy the whole series, but there are some great episodes (with specific recommendations from other reviewers). Conversely, I do have the entire Danger Man series. If you check it out don't overlook the earlier  hr series. It is surprisingly well done. They somehow managed to contain an integral story arc in that 28 or so minutes. The intro of this first series also has a very Bond-like McGoohan introducing himself as ""Drake .... John Drake"". This, two years before Sean Connery introduced himself as Bond ... James Bond in Dr. No!

The last contrasting feature I can think to bring up is the use of firearms. Patrick McGoohan, who was a very moral man and had a heavy influence on the John Drake character, rarely used a gun. He wanted a family show, with minimal violence and sex. Drake was all about brains over brawn, and thanks to great writing the gun element is not missed. Scott and Robinson are more conventional spys and are rarely caught not packing. The pair are somewhat discreet with their use of unnecessary gun play however, so I would say this difference in the shows is less about any excess I Spy violence and more about the extra work required by the Danger Man writing staff to get Drake out of a jam without the quick and easy plot device afforded by a gun.

Music-wise I Spy and Danger Man are on similar footing, with memorable scores for both series. The 1960-62  hr Danger Man has a punchy, jazzy theme, with an even punchier theme accompanying the 1964-66 1 hr version (sold in the USA as Secret Agent, with the unforgettable Johnny Rivers theme). I absolutely love the I Spy theme as well, which rests nicely on the opening visuals where Kelly Robinson, in the blink of an eye transforms from a racket swinging tennis bum to an armed spy, taking the shot, and disappearing through the doorway formed by the upper case ""I"" in the title. So, a total of four themes... all of them winners (as is true of so many 60s TV shows).

----------------------------------------------------
ps - Given the claim made about Danger Man being one of the first spy dramas with a super cool agent, it should be noted that a production of Ian Fleming's 'Casino Royale' was aired in the 1950s on live TV in America. You can find this short but excellent production included in the extras on the DVD for the 1967 parody version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale/dp/B00005JL0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale</a>&nbsp;starring Peter Sellers. In another interesting parallel between John Drake and James Bond, the Bond in this 50's production is an AMERICAN working for the CIA. Likewise the early Danger Man series had John Drake also portrayed as an American, albeit working for NATO. All subsequent Drake/Bond characters were of course British.",1404864000,2,6184,4.79718309859155

It was filmed in black and white, known as Danger Man in Great Britain and Secret Agent in the U.S.  It predates the James Bond series and I Spy TV series.  Considering how old it is, you would think it would be silly spy stuff by today's standards.  Yet, it holds up as serious drama better than the older James Bond movies or the I Spy series.

Secret Agent John Drake ( Patrick McGoohan),  Secret Agent has just the right attitude and skill set to be a cult classic.

Agent John Drake completes his missions in  unique but morally superior ways; oh did I forget to say it is also fun to watch.

2693625,5,B000KLQUT4,"I am enjoying this series immensely.  I was very young when this was aired, but I remember it pretty well.  Of course I remember the American introduction with Johnny Rivers's great song, ""Secret Agent Man.""  After watching all of the episodes, I made the point to my wife that John Drake did not kiss any of the women.  One of the lines in Rivers's song says, ""Oh no, you let the wrong words slip while kissing persuasive lips.""  I Googled Patrick McGoohan and found out that he put it in his contract that there would be no kissing.  He also was not interested in being James Bond because he felt it was against his religious convictions.  Perhaps he didn't want to kiss a woman other than his wife, even though it was just acting.  In any event, I really respect his views concerning those issues.  Danger Man does not suffer in the least from the absence of kissing.

The series is excellent.  I like A&E's packaging.  They are contained in a nice box.  There are eighteen, one-sided disks in the set.  The picture quality is excellent.  Great clarity!  I really enjoy old black and white British television.  It is great!  There are two color episodes in the set.

It is near impossible to pick a favorite episode.  However, there is an episode where Drake poses as a butler for a  wife-beating creep.  Drake has to keep his cool.  I love great acting, and Patrick McGoohan is outstanding in this episode.

Thanks for one of the best shows of the past.",1344729600,3,349,4.390625
2693627,5,B000KLQUT4,"discovered this series on KTEH 54-San Jose, a local PBS station, and I was astounded by the quality of the acting and of the writing. The dialogue is simply outstanding and far outpaces anything you will see on primetime tv today featuring the work of many well-known directors like Peter Yates (Bullitt), who are well-respected in the UK and abroad.

I think John Drake is the epitome of cool--examine the icy interchange between Darren Nesbitt and McGoohan in ""Sting in the Tail"" for example--you will be riveted to the screen. Supporting cast include reliable, stock actors from the ITC stable and some notable British film stars like John Fraser, Bernard Lee, (M from the James Bond films) and Finlay Currie.

Personally, I never grow tired watching these expertly written episodes over and over again--a product of Great Britain's when it still had something resembling an empire. The strength in Secret Agent lies in the scripts, characterization of the lead (McGoohan), and the gritty realism portrayed. In fact, McGoohan directed several of the episodes including ""The Paper Chase"" which has some whimsical, if not humorous, elements to it--I won't spoil it for you, but let's just say Drake's means of eluding the bad guys in this installment is a go-kart!

Drake is not infalliable and does not always win the day: watch the episode ""Judgment Day"" and see why. Personally, these hour long episodes are far superior than the 30 minute ""Danger Man"" episodes that were produced a few years before.

Secret Agent is played seriously--not like the candy coated sci fi James Bond ""espionage entertainments"" served up by Brosnan and Co. ridiculously replete with cars that fly or laden with machine guns and death rays. No, here is an agent that, although an expert marksman, refuses to use a gun, but instead relies on his wits to get the job done.

Take my word for it, Secret Agent Mega set is the ticket to hours of viewing pleasure and an interesting window into Cold War politics and intrigue--Enjoy!",1340236800,6,2009,4.931952662721893

2693639,4,B000KLQUT4,"This 18-disc omnibus collection contains the complete adventures of Patrick McGoohan as secret agent John Drake. The first fifty or so episodes are half an hour long and all but the last two are in black-and-white. The half-hour episodes are taut, straightforward thrillers, often long on action and short on plot and character development. The hour-long episodes give a little more room for characterization and more intricate plot lines, but some of the earlier ones feel like they were made from scripts intended for the half-hour format that were padded to fill a full 50 minutes, but rest assured the pace does pick up. Drake's agency affiliation also changes between the half-hour and full-hour episodes. In the former, he seems to be working for NATO, perhaps on a freelance basis to clean up ""messy situations"". In the latter, it is more clearly established that he's working for a British agency called ""M9"".

Known as ""Danger Man"" in the UK and ""Secret Agent"" in the U.S, the series ended when Patrick McGoohan quit the show to make his cult classic mini-series ""The Prisoner"". Although McGoohan often denied that his character in ""The Prisoner,"" Number Six, was actually John Drake of ""Danger Man""/""Secret Agent"" (which may have been due to a copyright issue), there are several threads, besides McGoohan himself, tie the show together. Portmerion resort in northern Wales, where much of the exterior footage for ""The Prisoner"" was shot, makes an appearance in one of the first episodes of ""Danger Man"". One of the early half-hour epsiodes, titled ""Colony Three"" is set in an isolated village somewhere in eastern Europe where communist spies are trained to assimilate themselves into British culture. There are many similarities between life in that village and life in The Village, chief among them is that no one can escape. In ""Danger Man,"" Drake often takes his leave with the phrase ""be seeing you"", which figures more prominently in ""The Prisoner"".

It is also interesting to note that McGoohan was offered the role of James Bond in the first film of that franchise, ""Dr. No"", based on his portrayal of John Drake. McGoohan, a staunch Roman Catholic, turned the role down because he didn't approve of Bond's womanizing ways. One of the early half-hour episodes of the show features Lois Maxwell, who played Miss Moneypenny in the Bond films opposite Sean Connnery, George Lazenby, and Roger Moore. Unlike her Bond character, Maxwell's character in ""Danger Man"" is a field agent who is in the thick of the action alongside Drake. Also, Donald Pleasance, who famously played arch villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld in ""You Only Live Twice"", appears in a couple of episodes.

2693643,5,B000KLQUT4,"I, too caught the tail end of the U.S. run of ""The Secret Agent Man""over 40 years ago. There was something true about the character, so streetwise and versatile while under cover, so much that I made a point of swallowing the next Patrick McGoohan vehicle in toto,""The Prisoner."" By the time the chance came to acquire the entire series on DVD, I couldn't wait. Realizing that the character of John Drake(cynic,  iconoclast or bonhomie when necessary)was reaching the same audience captivated by the James Bond fictional character without dividing loyalties is most exceptional. Although both are fictional, the John Drake ""Danger Man"" character stands out and apart from James Bond who remains mostly fantasy. McGoohan, as Drake, enlarges his character over several episodes and enjoys the advantage of acquiring personal demons that never bedevil Mr. Bond, like depression, emotional exhaustion or betrayal. Not seen in over many years, Danger Man, remains as relevant today as back then. Cinema verite on-location shooting(brilliant b&w photography) throughout enhances the realism making it like a LeCarre novel, or a continuation of ""The Spy Who Came In From the Cold"" starkness. The bonus episodes in color actually dim Danger Man's lustre only slightly by detracting from its newsreel time-capsule feel. Another thing bears worth noting, the gadgetry encountered along the way makes ""Q"" like an unproductive underling in comparison. Bond only speaks English, while Drake speaks French, Italian and Spanish depending on locale. Bond never impersonated anyone but himself, 007. (Perhaps when Drake proclaimed:""I'm a name, not a number!"" in Prisoner he meant it as a double entendre, a slap to Bond.) After seeing this engrossing Danger Man compilation, I am convinced that John Drake(McGoohan) was a Super Bond, really. And, as others pointed out, he delivers nuggets of human philosophy and compassionate psychology while preserving King and Country and the unnamed Agency as well, without losing his moral compass. It's sadly ironic that we now send armies and annual budgets into the same locales(Baghdad, Libya, Yemen et.al)that John Drake smoothed over in a single episode. Perhaps our agents are only interested in book deals these days. Thankfully, John Drake was no mere policeman.

One side note: Danger Man utilized a large pool of actors (frequently in reverse/roles) every now and then your will spot a future cinema star in a cameo scene uncredited like Judy Geeson, playing a restless teen with accuracy years before her launch in ""To Sir, With Love"".",1316217600,13,2570,5.296568627450981
2693644,5,B000KLQUT4,"I'm another Prisoner fan who wanted to see some of McGoohan's other work, and in many respects Danger Man / Secret Agent showcases his acting talents more than the later series. Why? Because he often takes on cover roles on his assignments, a tactic increasingly evident once the show goes to the hour long format. (In 'The Prisoner', he's essentially just one character.)

I concur with many of the other reviewers: The video transfer is awfully good for a show this old (although there's an annoying white thread across Drake's nose in the one version of the opening titles). Audio is marginal at times and muddy, but good enough for viewing. For most of the episodes, the audio is actually decent.

The 30 minute episodes are very, very fast-paced, and one can sometimes tell they were trying to cram a little too much plot and dialog into the time available. Everybody talks fast, and sometimes McGoohan seems to be playing up his supposedly American origins a bit much, almost Cagney-style. They clearly eased up a lot when going to the hour-long format (and Drake was said to be British), and I think the extra time allowed for much better story development.

Absolutely: The show was produced cheaply. Stock footage. Rear-projection. Re-used sets. Indoor studio sets standing in for outdoors. Re-using the same actors in multiple roles across shows (William Marshall is especially conspicuous). Caucasian British nationals done up badly in make-up to make them look African, East Indian, or Chinese. (On the other hand, there's less of this in the hour-long shows; probably reflective of larger budget and the fact there was a fair amount of social progress between 1960 and 1964.) Yes, everybody drinks like fish and smokes like chimneys. In fact, offering people cigarettes is one of John Drake's particular affectations, and he's constantly using his smoking as a cover for taking pictures with his miniaturized camera disguised as a (functional) lighter.

But I can overlook all that when there's good acting and writing. As I said, McGoohan really shines when he pretty much ditches his Drake surname and becomes someone else. A prim, unflappable butler. A neurotic novelist. A drunken ne'er-do-well. A tennis instructor. A playboy. A just-released prison inmate. An unemployed nebbish schoolteacher. An Army major. A professional spy-master. The whole ""taken away your name"" line from the American version theme song actually has some meaning here, in that Drake spends so much time being someone else, one could easily imagine him losing his real self.

Then there's the writing. I am very particular and highly critical of bad writing. I hate it when I can figure out how a story is going to end in the first five minutes -- and these shows almost never reveal where they're going until the last scene. Often Drake will concoct a complicated plan...only to have something go very wrong, and then he has to improvise like mad. Moreover, his foes -- ""the other side"" as they're often called -- are rarely stupid. Drake has to outsmart and outmaneuver them, and even then the outcome isn't always as he wants it to be.

I also like the way Drake doesn't lean very heavily on his gadgets (all of which are totally plausible given 1960s technology), and he almost never uses a gun. His chief weapons are his wits and ability to improvise. Whatever the assignment, he has a moral code that is so strict, he'll sometimes bend his orders to achieve what to him is a better outcome. Or try to -- again, sometimes he doesn't win 100%.  Most of all, he comes across as genuine and real.

Anyway, for the current Amazon price of a little over forty bucks for the entire set, spanning 86 episodes, it's hard to go wrong. With the slimline-packaging version, it won't even take up much space on the video shelf.",1313625600,15,3812,4.871913580246914

Based on this TV series, Patrick McGoohan was Ian Fleming's choice to play James Bond in the forthcoming movies based on Fleming's books. McGoohan passed on the role and he suggested Sean Connery for the role. Connery went on to star in many of the Bond films. But, it was this Patrick McGoohan spy series which first caught Fleming's eye as to how Ian Fleming wanted his character, James Bond to be portrayed on the big screen.

Patrick McGoohan went on to create The Prisoner tv series. For my money, The Prisoner is the greatest TV series ever presented on television. This iconic and enigmatic TV series is still revered and is still argued about today. Secret Agent/Danger Man is the prequel to The Prisoner.",1308355200,7,820,4.774647887323944

McGoohan portrays a plausible international trouble-shooter without the high body counts and anti-gravity acrobatics of today's TV action heroes.  Many of the plot lines have been repackaged in current TV fare.  MacGyver fans may enjoy John Drake's occasional improvisation with items at hand.",1307145600,10,648,5.173076923076923
2693658,5,B000KLQUT4,I have been watching some Danger Man episodes. What a treat! First there is the great Patrick Mcgoohan in the lead. Second great writing and story telling. While viewing these treasures I found myself wishing they still did shows like this. It was truly unique a one of a kind. This is not Bond in anyway(I do enjoy Bond in books and films)I sincerely recommend this set to anyone into sixties TV or the spyphenomena of the same time. I know you will not be dissappointed.,1305158400,4,472,4.5

Not anything like James Bond, this guy has class, principles, and a Mini Cooper, not a gun, an Aston Martin, & loose chicks. We like Patrick McGoohan's style. He was one of a kind. This set was well worth buying & we're glad we found it!",1302220800,10,394,4.12987012987013
2693661,4,B000KLQUT4,Great series. Even the black and white shows are excellent. Good plots good acting. Only thing wrong is that you have to watch the opening titles over and over again unless you want to play around with the Fast Forward. Have only seen the first few discs. Looking forward to the American shows.,1301616000,4,294,4.566037735849057
2693662,5,B000KLQUT4,"If you have a high-resolution TV set, it might be surprising that shows from the 60's look better than shows from 70's, 80's and 90's.  Back then, TV shows were filmed instead of videotaped, and film has a much better resolution than early videotape.  Filmed B&W looks gorgeous on a big TV.

I am a huge fan of The Prisoner, which also looks gorgeous.  So I decided to check out Danger Man.  Black and White can look very crisp when done with this level of care.

There is an amusingly SHOCKING amount of smoking in these shows.  Smoking while trying to hide. Numerous people smoking in bed.  A sniper is smoker while he's trying to get a shot.  When a trauma patient wakes up, they try to get her to smoke.  Every episode, John Drake has his cigarette case out to offer cigarettes.  I would have liked to see a selection of 1960's cigarette commercials that went along with these shows, just so I could get some context.  As I said, amusing.

Patrick McGoohan is fantastic as John Drake, and gives him a very fascinating character.  He isn't always pleasant, but always well-grounded.  Lots of really long takes, often with excellent dialog.

Highly recommended.",1301529600,15,1163,4.627450980392157
2693663,4,B000KLQUT4,"If John Le Carre wrote short stories,rather than novels about spies,they would resemble the scripts of this intelligent and well-done series.

2693664,5,B000KLQUT4,"It's been written that the creators and crew of this show strived to bring cinema quality to television and for the most part they succeeded. From lead actor McGoohan to the directors to the photography and especially to the writing and concepts behind the show, it all comes together in a way that hasn't been duplicated yet. And of course the program all indirectly leads to the more famous ""Prisoner"" series.

This DVD set is compact with very little in the way of extras. The first season of half-hour shows are good and contain some excellent episodes although that season is more of a typical spy show. It's the hour shows that really bloom, only a few off episodes and even those are watchable and entertaining. The final black and white hour episodes are some of the best of the series.

The entire series has dated well although you'll start to recognize the same sets being reused and the episodes with English actors in Asian makeup are absurd to watch now. Some episodes have muddy audio which sounds like the original audio tracks are decomposing but they are still listenable. The video quality is excellent.  Also included are the final two color episodes which were never aired in the series proper. These are among the weakest episodes in the package and provide some clues why Patrick McGoohan decided to end the series and switch to his own project, ""The Prisoner"". It seems clear that the color show was veering towards spy fluff in the vein of fellow ITC series, ""The Saint"" and both McGoohan and Danger Man series creator Ralph Smart weren't interested.

This is an excellent set, you will not regret getting this.",1301097600,10,1636,4.75
2693665,4,B000KLQUT4,"A reminder of a time when characters in a tv series didn't spend most of their time sleeping with each other. One might also note only one commercial break in the middle of the show, as opposed to a break every 7 or 8 minutes today. Still a pretty neat series. But that ""Danger Man"" theme and the hysterically shrill jazz at every action scene are totally annoying, and sometimes just silly. Not much in the line of extra features, but consider that the price is pretty cheap for 86 episodes. Most of the video transfers look good, although audio is often murky. The writers packed a lot of story into very small time slots, so don't expect to see many drawn-out ""thinking"" or character-development sequences -- the script just moves from one action scene to the next. Dated stuff, but still involving.",1300838400,6,802,4.615384615384615

2693667,5,B000KLQUT4,"Secret Agent is, quite simply, the best TV series ever made.  It depends on superb acting and great scripts for its content and its quality.  There are no special effects.  There is little or no violence, and almost never does a gun make an appearance.  Most of the episodes were noticeably shot on the same set, often with the same cast.  But the level of suspense the episodes generate is incredible.  The music--often in the form of single notes, or even silence--coupled with the action puts the viewer on the edge of his or her chair.

If you want to watch a gimmick-free, brilliant, suspenseful, intelligent, and timeless series, this set is for you.  It shows that consistent high quality of scripts and acting can trump high budgets and gore.  There is a lesson here somewhere.",1296000000,20,785,4.713235294117647
2693678,5,B000KLQUT4,"This was the most intelligent secret agent show ever. Dangerman ran 29 half and hour episodes and then several seasons as a hour show. Unfortunately it's not in color though. I wish they'd give us a choice of colorized episodes but that's a minor thing and it didn't make the show any less great. This is a show based on well scripted and acted stories so that helps alot. It's so good that even several young people I showed it to were hooked! In spite of the black and white, few youngster can even watch black and white anymore. So that's how good this show really is. Some people think that this is the same character who is the prisoner. That may be the case but probably isn't.  That show is another classic that Patrick M. was involved with, this one however is close in excellence to that one.",1294531200,6,801,4.375838926174497

2693682,5,B000KLQUT4,"Growing up I always liked to watch Secret Agent (Man).  We always added the word ""Man"" to the title because of the song ""Secret Agent Man"" (they're giving you a number and taking away your name).
What I like about the program, after years of reflecting on it, but didn't realize as a child, was the moral outlook of John Drake.  He differed from James Bond. He was bold, brave, and acted on the situation, but he had morals.  You could see that he was not the amoral, uncaring secret agent.  He struggled to do the right thing.  Many times he uses brain over the gun.  He was a good role model to follow.  Many times when his superiors said the person was not the primary concern of the mission but national security was, John Drake differed and made the person involved the primary concern.  Nor was he seduced by a beautiful woman.  He was romantic, but always kept clear of sexual liasons.  He proved you could be a dynamic, caring, and loyal person without ending up in bed with the enemy.
I never saw ""Danger Man"" as a child, that I can remember, so this collection with the ""Danger Man"" part of John Drakes life is great.  It is like getting new episodes.

Patrick McGoohan probably was the only one who could portray John Drake, given his moral upbringing and his strict contract signing conditions for this series. In McGoohan eyes,  John Drake had to be a very moral man.  He turned down the role of James Bond and similar characters because of the moral issues.  Here he shows the morality of John Drake. McGoohan shows this aspect in the opening of the sequel to ""Secret Agent"", ""The Prisoner.""  The opening of ""The Prisoner"" shows a secret agent quiting because of the moral ramifications of the job.  His bosses don't understand this aspect and try to find out why he defected.  McGoohan wanted to be a moral role model in an amoral world of spying.

I would recommend this series for children because it portrays a definite right and a definite wrong in characters and moral situations.",1285977600,74,2000,4.5363128491620115

This spy drama aired at the height of the popularity of the big screen's James Bond.  The Bond films inspired the TV series ""Secret Agent"" in England as well as NBC's ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E"" in America.

Patrick McGoohan plays agent John Drake, who travels all over the world in pursuit of international criminals, corrupt politicians, and stolen secrets.  All 86 episodes are included in broadcast order, from the original season, which aired only in the United Kingdom as ""Danger Man,"" to the 47 episodes of ""Secret Agent"" that were seen internationally, including two color episodes that marked the finale to the long-running suspense thriller.",1285200000,20,781,5.023255813953488

McGoohan had tremendous screen charisma and intelligence, neither of which can be faked.  He made a few movies and was exceptional in those as well, but true superstardom eluded him for reasons I could never understand.  If you're thinking about buying this series, I could not give it a stronger recommendation.

He was James Bond before James Bond hit the big screen and he really would have been perfect for the role.  The Secret Agent Danger Man series was similar to Fleming's Bond in the books.  Bond and Secret Danger Man both had intrique, violence, high-tech gadgetry (for the time) and exotic locales.  What Secret Danger Man did not have was sex or a gun compared to Ian Fleming's James Bond.  All around a good buy now that the price has dropped.

2693695,5,B000KLQUT4,"As a child, I watched Secret Agent on PBS. Years later, from the prospective of someone who grew up during the Cold War, the show still does not disappoint.

I've now watched all of the half-hour Danger Man episodes, and they are just as good as the full-hour Secret Agent episodes; some are among the very best episodes in the entire series. Patrick McGoohan's wry presence; lots of snappy, fast-paced dialogue (delivered in McGoohan's inimitable style); lots of fun pseudo-judo; wonderful character actors in supporting roles. This is simply a fun show. It's also unique, as far as I know, in that John Drake is a secret agent for NATO, rather than MI5 or CIA. I'm not aware of any other program or movie with this little twist.

I have been very happy with the picture quality thus far, and, while it's annoying that there are no subtitles, I have not experienced the sound or foreign accent issues that a couple of others have noted. I find it all very easy to understand, and the recording levels to be perfectly adequate.

By the way, I'd say most episodes of this show are okay for older kids, maybe 12 and older. There is some comparatively mellow gun play and violence - nothing much worse than that found in Disney's Pocahontas (seriously); and some mild sexual situations - nothing much more salacious than in Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame (seriously).

So, they lack the Johnny Rivers 'Secret Agent Man' song and accompanying lead-in theme that we 'Yanks' enjoyed so much.

2693707,5,B000KLQUT4,"Danger Man is a compelling, interesting and complex spy show that consciously strives for realism at every possible level. Varied locals, dangerous opposition and a dynamic lead all combine to create a show where, as one of the episode titles claims, ""Parallel Lines Sometimes Meet.""

This comprehensive set contains all four seasons of the show Danger Man; the first season of half-hour shows and the second, third and fourth seasons of the hour-long shows. (The fourth season consists of only two episodes, both filmed in color)

The main character in the show is a man named Drake, John Drake. In the first season (half-hour episodes) he is an Irish American agent employed by NATO to tackle their `messy jobs.' In the later seasons (hour-long episodes) he has lost his slightly American accent and now works for the British Government in Special Branch, M9 specifically. Though John Drake's character remains intact through changes between the first and later seasons, there is obvious character development that takes place over the first to second season hiatus.

John Drake, as he appears in the first season of half-hour episodes, is a young, cool, efficient agent. He is bold, quick thinking and moves fast--he has to. The time constraints of the show limit any excess time or trouble. The shows are fairly uncomplicated, but for the most part quite interesting. Drake is very involved in the repercussions of his work and regularly confronts his superiors with the possible consequences of his orders. Drake has a much more personal voice in these episodes, as occasional voice-overs allow us to get inside his head and understand what he is seeing. In this first series, Drake is perhaps a little heartless in his dealings and is always very, very impatient with others' incompetence or mistakes. There is no margin for error in his own work, he allows for no margin in the work of those he meets.

In the later series, the expanded hour-long episodes grant us more intricate episodes. Where the first season had speed and intensity on their side, these next seasons have depth, complexity and suspense. In these later seasons, Drake is more sympathetic and more fallible. He also seems to have reached a little more maturity when it comes to failings in his fellow agents. It has not, however, given him any more respect for his superiors--he still harasses them regularly, particularly in the later episodes.
One of Drakes most appealing and enigmatical traits is his strict moral code. He has what might be called a ""knight in shining armor"" complex, as Drake seems incapable of ignoring a plea for help. Another peculiar habit is his aversion to violence. When it comes to tight situations, Drake will first try to talk his way out, then try to sneak out and finally, if there is no other way, he will use (usually weaponless) force. Even though it is frequently demonstrated that he is an excellent shot, Drake actually carries a gun in only a few episodes and fires a weapon at someone in even fewer.  He would rather disarm and hold his opponent at bay or use his sizable fists to render his opponent harmless.

His relationships with women also fall under the category of his unusual morality. Though he is obviously very attractive to most of the women who appear in the show, he either coldly rebuffs or dryly discourages their attempts in all but a few instances. His most intimate sign of favor is a courteous kiss on the cheek for a few greatly admired ladies. His respect for women as thinking, feeling people rather than objects of desire makes his interactions with them far more interesting than that of a ""love `em and leave `em"" style hero so common in the spy genre.

Interesting and dynamic, Danger Man is as real as TV spy shows get. The gadgets are believable, the action is complex and the stories are compelling. The show has aged well, with very few of the `campy' moments that typically plague other television shows of the period. Its moral, relentless hero and its realistic plotlines make Danger Man a must-see TV show for anyone interested in spies, politics or human nature.",1189296000,74,4117,4.856125356125356
2693708,5,B000KLQUT4,"DangerMan set the tone, the quality and the style for everything that followed, be it Bond (which it predates ""The name's Drake, John Drake"", come on!) or The Man From UNCLE, Mission Impossible etc. Drake did it all first. Accepted it's dated, but still superb, stylish and adept storytelling for its time with the facilities available. The storylines are certainly more compelling than most modern day TV dramas, and the acting certainly so. Also a terrific score by Edwin Astley. This is one of the foundations of TV history. A 'must watch'.",1182902400,10,543,4.913043478260869
2693709,5,B000KLQUT4,"Although I was very young when this series was first shown in the States and have no memory of watching it, I've been a Patrick McGoohan fan for many years (ever since seeing him in Disney's ""The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh"").  The fact that he was in Danger Man was the primary reason that I purchased it, but remarks from other reviewers regarding the fact that the hero rarely used a gun and didn't spend his time falling in and out of bed with the nearest handy female, was another HUGE selling point.  I rarely watch television anymore because I'm so disgusted by the rubbish that's shown, so am always grateful when good televisions series' are brought to DVD.  My family and I have watched just about the entire series and have enjoyed the episodes we've seen.  Thank you so much for making this available!",1180396800,15,811,4.572413793103448

2693712,5,B000KLQUT4,"Patrick McGoohan is cool as John Drake, secret agent first for N.A.T.O.
(North Atlantic Treaty Organization) in the 30 minute show, then for
British Intelligence in the 60 minute show.  His accent also changed
from ""American"" to ""English"" when he started the hour shows.

  A messy job, that's when they call him.  He storms out of the
fluorescent-lit building, gets into a convertible sports-car, and
races off to the airport.  In no time, he is in a foreign country,
meeting dangerous characters and fetching dolls.  He mostly uses
wits and cunning instead of violence, but still can beat up bad guys
three at a time.  He doesn't have time to romance the women, except
maybe after the fade-out.  A tall, strong, intelligent, and handsome
guy, he is British TV's ""thinking person's"" James Bond.  Enjoy all the
great British support actors and actresses, b&w film-noir style, and
socko ""hard-jazz"" music.

  The American weekly opening for the hour show, though great with the
classic Johnny Rivers song, promises lots of gun-shooting and violence,
which in fact is rarely delivered in this intriguing program!",1178928000,4,1110,5.066298342541437
2693713,5,B000KLQUT4,"First of all, I'd wish to send a BIG THANK YOU to the Amazon.com for make my every night dream come true!!!I was looking for this episodes for years!!

 I've just received the Secret Agent (aka Danger Man) - The Complete Collection Megaset 2007...and all I can say is:if your a Prisoner addicted, you have to buy this terrific series..

 When I was young, back in 60's, I used to watch every episode of this serie with my father and I can remember my loved father always sayin' : """"This actor plays as natural as a real spy....Patrick McGoohan is the right actor in the right series"""""" ....today, the name of my son is PATRICK..I pick this name from Patrick McGoohan!!!!!'cause you know: Danger Man (John Drake) was the super spy who didn't use a single gun!!!!  A MUST HAVE!!!!!",1177632000,10,779,4.535714285714286
2693714,4,B000KLQUT4,"I bought this set rather on impulse.  I have a couple of the ""Secret Agent"" DVD's and love them (having watched, and loved, ""The Prisoner"" in my teens).  So, knowing that those were great, surely Danger Man had to be great too.

And it is, though in a much different way. I'm watching the disks in order, so I'm only a little ways in, but I've enjoyed almost all the stories so far.  They're a bit campy, (though less so than the later series) and (as another reviewer noted) sometimes a bit rushed, but generally well written with good production values. Pat McGoohan is always great.  The guest actors are a bit more variable (a few dodgy accents, a tendency to put 'dark' make-up on Anglo actors to make them pass for Indians and North Africans)but most do a good job.

It's especially interesting, in the first disk or two, to see how the writers and producers (and actors) gradually settled in, making subtle changes as they went along. (In the first couple of episodes, they seemed to want to avoid setting the stories in any 'real' places, so they simply avoiding naming them -- leading to some bizarre dialogue about 'why are you visiting our country?' and 'where did you learn to speak the langauge of this country?' Eventually they apparently decided to just make up countries, so we get a wide assortment of imaginary Eastern European, Middle Eastern and Latin American locales. (Where, of course, everyone speaks fluent English with accents.)

Looking forward to watching more.

So why only 4 stars? At least one of the episodes is unwatchable, lots of freezing and break-ups.  And, while I suppose I shouldn't complain given the price, the complete lack of extras is frustrating.  There aren't even any subtitles.",1176076800,20,1726,4.761744966442953
2693715,5,B000KLQUT4,"I've been waiting decades for a proper reissue of this show which was my all-time favourite when I was a teenager, just as I waited almost as long for the release of Bob Dylan's ""Albert Hall"" concert from 1966 and even longer for the Superman TV series.  The transfer quality of these series is excellent.  I'm only a few discs in so far but am still looking forward to the rest.

The John Drake character is an intriguingly quirky one.  Most heroes, even today, are either traditional square-jawed empty vessels or ones that have tacked-on characteristics or ""issues"": wheelchair, shabby coat, fat, obsessive-compulsive, etc.

John Drake was a confident professional with a keen sense of personal honour who was not afraid to ignore his orders if he believed he knew better.  Plenty of those types around, yes, but what made Drake different was the way McGoohan made him almost asexual - we never see him in a meaningful and serious clinch (I think, as I haven't re-viewed them all yet) and he has a very precise and staccato way of moving as well as speaking - and that he refused to use a gun.  Also, no-one else had a forehead like Patrick McGoohan's.  He usually keeps his head down to amplify this attribute which makes him seem more cerebral than physical.  John Drake leads with his forehead, not his fists.  Despite this he does, of course, always win the traditional end-of-show fist fight.  And no other TV star had the confidence, and the will, to give up a successful show (where he made more money than any other UK TV star) to go and make something as different as The Prisoner.  Good for him.

All I need now are the remastered Fleischer Popeye cartoons, promised for later this year, and the full run of both Bilko and Get Smart and I can move into old-age happily.

P.S. As a UK resident, I never I understood why the name was changed to ""Secret Agent"" in the US.  Does ""Danger Man"" mean something bad or stupid in America?",1175817600,13,1941,4.569364161849711

2693717,5,B000KLQUT4,"This set was compiled by the A&E TV network. The picture and sound quality are quite good, certainly as good as possible given today's technology and the technology of when the shows were originally made.

There are 87 episodes in this collection.

The first 39 are half-hour (actually 26-minute) episodes, shown only in the UK originally. The copyrights at the ends say they were made in the late 1950s. In these shows, John Drake (I'm not making this up) is supposed to be an American agent working for NATO, though neither his accent nor wordplay sound remotely American.

The other 47 are the hour-shows (52 minutes) we American boomers remember. The copyrights say early 1960s. Now Drake is a British agent, obviously emulating 007.

These were low-budget productions. The half-hour shows are rushed - too much plot and too little time. The hour-shows are dated, if not out and corny. But I accept all that, because Patrick McGoohan's acting and especially the scriptwriters were excellent.

Americans be forewarned. All these episodes aired in the UK as Danger Man, and that's the version you get in this set. You won't hear Johnny Rivers singing Secret Agent Man during the credits. Instead you hear a few seconds of nondescript organ music or something. That's my only real regret about this collection.",1174176000,8,1311,4.968036529680365
