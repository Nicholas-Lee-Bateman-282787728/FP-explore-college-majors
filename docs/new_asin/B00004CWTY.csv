But I was 100% percent wrong!
It came as though it was brand new and I found nothing broken or even scratched up!

1340228,2,B00004CWTY,I am huge fan of Michael Jackson and ordered this set. The songs listed on this DVD are the best songs. But there are no Subtitles and the DVD quality is also not so good as I thought. This is like watching on basic TV channel but at least they have Closed Captions to see what the lyrics are. I wanted to return this DVD but I did not see any other DVD set of Michael Jackson that has subtitles.,1345766400,,396,3.9625
1340229,5,B00004CWTY,Purchased both of the History Films. If you are looking for a perfect collection of MJ's most popular videos. These DVD's will be the perfect collection. It inlcudes the full length version of his exteneded videos (which is something many other's don't). So if you are looking for a DVD collection of his best video's this would be the one. 5 thumbs up!!!!!!,1336608000,,358,4.698412698412699
1340230,2,B00004CWTY,I actually like the material on this DVD -- BUT it does not work on a computer.  It has some kind of copy protection.  Then it would not eject from my mac mini.,1326499200,,160,3.8181818181818183
1340231,5,B00004CWTY,This is the Michael Jackson video I have searched for quite some time.  Amazon really lives up to its name when it comes to price and deliver of orders requested.  I am more than pleased with the Michael Jackson video since it shows more than what was expected.  The price was right and everyone should really view this particular one!,1323907200,,335,4.55
1340232,5,B00004CWTY,My son is a true MJ fan so he loves this. Its a collection of music videos of some of the best tunes that MJ ever made. Smooth Criminal is my all time favourite video. :),1300838400,,170,3.75

1340254,5,B00004CWTY,"For anyone who is a fan of the king of pop, this is a must have.  A great blend of his wonderful videos both old and new, and my favorite is the MTV music awards....even his sister Janet was in awe.",1294444800,,198,3.8292682926829267
1340255,1,B00004CWTY,"So....I bought this for my 9 year old son for Chrsitmas becuase he is a very musical little boy in song and dance. Who better to see than Michael Jackson? I was so very wrong. Side A was awesome, however when we started to watch side B a whole different Michael Jackson image appreared. The one I wanted to ""protect"" my 9 year old from. The worst was with his sister Janet, who in this video was grabbing her breasts, flipping everyone off into the Camera, and standing in front of a toilet as if to ""pee"" like a man. I don't care WHAT the twisted message was trying to convey, my son and I were appauled. After that, was a video of Michael rising from a pond with angel wings attached to his back as we watch him emerge from the water. So....what's wrong with THAT picture. Both the first DVD and this version is ""Not Rated"", but I will not risk buying the first one after that shock attack!!!! Certainly wish that I could get my $$ back for this one!!!!!! Absolutely disgusted!",1293926400,,979,4.297297297297297
1340256,3,B00004CWTY,"I bought this DVD for my Grandson who is 6 because he likes MJ's stage moves and energy. I don't mind him watching talented entertainers like MJ and i will not expose him to untalented phoney so called performers of the day in which unfortunatley there are too many. If you can't sing and you must talk in time to the same base beat don't call it singing please. I have heard too many singing live on TV that were off key and flat and just awful or use a voice synthesiser aid to help them cover up their lack of talent. Thank God for real talent like Elvis and Michael Jackson we can see entertainment at its best. There are some duds on this DVD but when MJ is on he is really on and all other entertainers of today pale in comparison. Elvis, Michael rest in peace knowing there are no others like you.",1292889600,,804,4.160256410256411
1340257,5,B00004CWTY,"A wonderful treat to see most of Michael's music videos. There were some I hadn't seen before and certainly not the long editions.

This is a beautiful tribute to a part of Michael Jackson's career. He hand picked each piece and made it for his fans to cherish.  He took his God given gifts and fine tuned them into the magnificent King of Pop that will live forever as long as we continue to play his music and watch his videos. He captured our hearts because his own heart was bigger than any person I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. His music and dancing will live on forever as long as we listen to his songs and watch his short films. I don't want the world to forget this beautiful creature who took the basics of entertaining and catapulted them into the moves we've been attempting to copy for years. He was a wonderful Father, a Fabulous Entertainer and One of a kind; and he was my friend. I miss you Michael.",1287446400,,987,5.130434782608695
1340259,4,B00004CWTY,This is a very good film with footage probably not seen on other DVD's.  I enjoyed it wey much. Michael at his best. I didn't realize that ther are 2 sides to play on this disc. Well worth the $.,1286755200,,195,3.875
1340260,4,B00004CWTY,I purchased this dvd to have record of a great artist. I am glad to have been alive while an artist of Michael Jackson's caliber was performing. It's too bad that he left us so early.,1284940800,,183,4.111111111111111

1340283,5,B00004CWTY,This DVD is ridiculously awesome. MJ is soo many things to me. He takes my breath away. I think he is absolutely beautiful. I particularly love to watch his 1995 MTV VMA Performance. It is spectacular. It makes my heart ache that he isn't here anymore. Buy this DVD.,1273708800,,266,4.448979591836735

1340285,5,B00004CWTY,"This DVD includes Thriller, and Beat It, a repeat from Vol. 1, but buy this one anyway. Smooth Criminal, Earth Song, They Don't Care About Us, are all worth the price.",1272326400,,167,4.419354838709677
1340286,5,B00004CWTY,"This DVD is one of my favorite Michael Jackson possesions. His music videos are amazing and this even includes his famous ""Motown 25"" performance and his performance at the 1995 MTV VMA's which is amazing. Michael's music videos is what made really get into Michael Jackson. He redefines the music video and truly his videos aren't music videos they are short films. In addition to HIStory on film vol. 1 this is a MUST HAVE for all MJ fans. I watch this DVD quite a bit and it really never gets old. Not only do you get his classics like Thriller, Beat It, and Smooth Criminal; but you also get some of his newer music videos which, in my opinion, I think were totally uinderestimated. His video ""Scream"" with sister Janet Jackson is fantastic along with ""They Don't Care About Us"" and ""Earth Song."" I watch this DVD more than vol. 1 and if you have vol. 1 you definitley need this DVD. Vol. 1 is great but it doesn't have ""Smooth Criminal"" which is defintley one of MJ's greatest short films and you also don't get the ""Motown 25"" performance which is classic. Also, I think that Michael's performance at the 1995 VMA's is one of his best dancing wise...he lip syncs due to larengitis but who cares? His dance moves are unexplainable. You also get the video ""Liberian Girl"" which isn't one of his best but it's different and funny. The only thing with these HIStory on film DVDs is that you still don't get some of his greatest work such as ""Dirty Diana,"" ""Man in the Mirror,"" ""You Rock my World,"" ""In the Closet,"" ""Jam,"" and so on. So if you like those videos too I would also look into buying ""Dangerous Short Films,"" ""The One,"" and ""Number Ones on DVD."" But anyways all Michael fans would love love love this DVD and it's worth your money.",1271289600,,1744,4.453125

1340291,5,B00004CWTY,"I'm going to be honest. I got this video for one reason and one reason only. Although I can view it online, I HAD to have the EPIC Scream video so I could view it on my television. The video has amazing quality, too. There are other favorites of mine on this video as well which is the best video or short film as Michael preferred to call them and that's Thriller. You will also get the video that skyrocketed Michael's career to another galaxy and that's the Billie Jean performance at the Motown 25: Yesterday, Today and Forever anniversary. The performance that the late legendary Fred Astaire enjoyed and who also happened to be one of Michael's idols next to James Brown. It was also the performance that was enjoyed immensely by the late Marvin Gaye. This is a must have for every Michael Jackson fan.",1264809600,,808,4.503401360544218

It has Motown 25's Billie Jean, Beat It, Liberian Girl, Smooth Criminal, 1995 MTV Awards Billie Jean and Dangerous, Thriller, Scream, Childhood, You Are Not Alone, Earth Song,They Don't Care about Us (Brazil), Stranger in Moscow, Blood on the Dance Floor (Refugee Camp Mix), and Brace Yourself ( Marching scenes). This DVD is my favorite of the short film DVDs that I have.  I plan to donate my MJ books to the local library after I've read them. It is a way to get out that he was innocent and that his kind of entertainment talent only happens once. I am a new fan; post MJ's death. To keep his legacy alive we need to spread the word. I'd like to see a book dedicated soley to MJ's humanitarian deeds. He was such a loving and caring person.",1261526400,,887,4.408536585365853

Enjoyed MTV footage but I've seen this same footage in other tapes of MJs so it isn't anything new. Extremely disappointed in ""Blood on the Dance Floor"". Song is redone against a RAP song. Why in the world someone would choose rap music on an MJ song is confusing to me. MJs name doesn't even show up on the credits (not surprising). Also, the CD is not labeled at all which makes me wonder if its ""home-made"". I thought I was purchasing an original MJ DVD. Guess the jokes on me!

I am glad that I purchased this collection. I also purchased the Dangerous short films, Video history one, and the Michael Jackson Dangerous concert.. All are awesome and make a great collections. I would like to see a dvd with all of MJ's videos on one dvd instead of several here and there. For instant man in the mirror is on the number one's dvd.. I would have liked to have seen that on one of these collections. With that said, theses are still great to have. I don't know if I will purchase the number one's dvd.

1340342,5,B00004CWTY,Excellent collection of Michael's videos.  My brohter bought a copy and I watched it and loved it so much I bought my own. Yea Michael Jackson!,1257724800,,143,4.5
1340353,4,B00004CWTY,"TEASER - This is why I say that Michael can't do anything small. Just watch it and you'll see what I mean. He takes something as small as a music video DVD release and turns it 360 degress with this teaser into a whole lot more than that. Only Michael, folks, only Michael.

BILLIE JEAN - Motown 25. Live. Michael Jackson and Billie Jean. They go together perfectly. And when you can see the wheels in Michael's head turning, you know that something special is about to happen -- and that's when the debut of the moonwalk -- very spontaneously -- happens. Very historic performance, very historic that I'm glad that they put on this DVD.

BEAT IT - This is one of the video's that broke the color barrier on MTV, and it has very good reason to have done so. I love the plot of Michael breaking up a gang fight by using the power of dance -- only Michael could get by with this stuff, in all honesty.

LIBERIAN GIRL - I love all of the celebrity guest appearances -- we even get a guest appearance from Bubbles! Everybody is looking around for Michael, and then he descends from the sky on a camera. So simple, yet very effective...and actually quite fun.

SMOOTH CRIMINAL - This is one of Michael's most known songs, and one of the more beloved from the perfect Bad album. And this video is proof of why. It's the full moonwalker version, and it contains the ever famous anti-gravity lean. When I was younger, this video didn't make any sense to me, but now that I'm older and finally understand what I'm seeing, I can say that I really do appreciate and love this video.

1995 MTV VIDEO MUSIC AWARDS PERFORMANCE - Wow. Michael is DEFINITELY the greatest entertainer that ever lived. Songs include ""Don't Stop Til You Get Enough,"" ""The Way You Make Me Feel,"" ""Jam,"" ""Scream,"" ""Beat It,"" ""Black Or White,"" ""Billie Jean, ""Dangerous,"" and ""You Are Not Alone."" This is 15 minutes, 16 at most, and Michael simply does not stop. He proves here that he's the greatest entertainer in the world.

THRILLER - You can't make a Michael Jackson video collection WITHOUT including this video. I'm sure it's been on all of them (except for Dangerous) in the past, and I'm sure that it'll be on all of them in the future. This is the ultimate music video, and, for that matter, it's the ultimate Michael Jackson video. So it HAS to be included here.

Now we flip it to side two...

SCREAM - The most expensive video at the time of it's making, featuring his sister Janet, Scream looks like technology come to life...especially for 1995 it looks like technology come to life. You can tell that Michael and Janet are having the time of their lives, too, which is always something good to see.

CHILDHOOD - The theme from Free Willy 2, the video doesn't really do much for me. Quite possibly my least favorite video on the entire collection, but that's not saying that it's a bad video. It just, to me anyway, doesn't feel too much like a typical Michael Jackson video.

YOU ARE NOT ALONE - I LOVE this video. This video just has to be seen to be believed. Trust me, for 1995, THIS is Michael at his absolute best!

THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT US - Ah, this was so controversial. It actually had two video's made for it, but the one included on this disc is the publicly released video. It'd have been much more cool if they'd have included the banned video, but I love the song and I love the video, so I'm not going to complain too much.

STRANGER IN MOSCOW - Remember what I said about ""You Are Not Alone?"" Now, take that down here, change the title to ""Stranger In Moscow,"" and you have my thoughts on this video.

BLOOD ON THE DANCE FLOOR - It's HIStory in the mix, ya know? I love this video. It just goes and goes and goes and goes -- and then, when you think it's done, it goes even more! Michael simply doesn't stop -- of course -- and the atmosphere of the video is completely awesome. One of my favorites on this set.

BRACE YOURSELVES - Yep. You should always brace yourself when it comes to Michael Jackson, because you never know WHAT in the world is going to happen!",1257638400,,4056,4.383488681757656
1340354,5,B00004CWTY,"To me, this is the best MJ DVD to have for devoted Michael Jackson fans. Michael sends us the message beyond the grave that he loves us and we should always remember that. This magnificant work also shows Michael's fun playful side, as well as his serious side, and his great, dedicated humanitarian efforts. We have lost a true angel on earth, but we can rest assured knowing that he is an angel in heaven.",1257033600,,407,4.44
1340355,5,B00004CWTY,"If you want to see an incredible musical genius then you should own this compilation. The Michael Jackson history on film volume II is amazing. But if you love Michael Jackson then you should already know that. The teaser is tremendous with Michael surrounded by military guards like the king that he truly is, it then goes into the motown 25 performance. This performace is the birth of an icon, many of Michael's signature moves are seen here for the first time including the moonwalk. The dvd includes some of his most famous short films: smooth criminal, thriller, and beat it; all ground breaking and all phenomemal. The dvd also includes the rarely seem videos liberian girl and a stranger in moscow. The dvd also includes one of Michael's greatest MTV performance which is a combination of some of his greatest hits and includes the guitarist Slash. The one downside to the dvd is that it is placed on two side instead of one. The second side includes his duet with sister Janet, and the song childhood which Michael has always recommended as a way for all to get to know who he truly is. Another video on the dvd is earth song, which highlightes one of Michael's greatest passions which is to heal the world by taking better care of the planet. The video happens to be one of the most requested short films of all time. The dvd also contains one of Michael's most controversial songs ""they don't care about us"" It is a good idea to get both volume one and two of the history collection, it makes for an almost complete collection of the superstar.",1256774400,,1555,4.577060931899641

I wish that Michael and Janet had done more videos together. I love both of their voices and music style. I didn't like Janet 'giving the finger' in the video nor them using the 'f' word (the word is partially bleeped out), and especially since Michael was such an advocate for the children, but I guess we have to have a flaw somewhere.

1340390,5,B00004CWTY,"This DVD is well worth the time it takes to watch. I loved it. Got a few minutes? Here's why, in intimate detail:

I must admit, it's been quite a while since I sat and watched Michael Jackson videos one after another. But now I'm looking at them through different eyes, trying to make sense of his senseless death, and whatever is being written or broadcast about him these days, I find I simply cannot look away right now. I want to know everything, and remember, and thank him somehow. Was there ever an entertainer before this who stripped himself naked for us, asked us to really see who he was, in so many ways? I don't think so. He makes us willing voyeurs, and welcomes our intrusion.

I've just finished watching Michael Jackson: HIStory on Film Volume II with those new eyes I mentioned. Some of the videos included on it I've seen many times before, but now they are clearly valuable as a chronicle of the evolution of a unique performer.

The teaser is very funny and over the top, a good example of the famously wicked MJ sense of humor, in this case spoofing himself. Here also you have the seminal introduction of moonwalking and Michael-bling in the Motown 25 live performance of ""Billie Jean"", and this is a performance that really has a sense of defiance to it, saying ""Here I am on my own, not The Jacksons but THE Jackson, and get ready coz I'm happening!"" It's also interesting as the first public indication that this artist was not going to stay in the Motown ""standard"" for very much longer. Included also is the slightly vague and disjointed ""Billie Jean"" video, historical as the first video by a black performer to be shown on MTV, not really satisfying on its own but rather an omen of better things to come...

And here's the huge Grammy winner ""Beat It"", where MJ now seems such a young nave idealist and is all forearms and legs, a gawky fawn with attitude and grace that surprises you, and the determination to show you what he thinks about gang violence whether you want to hear or not. Contrast this much simpler video with the huge scope of another idealistic video, ""Earth Song"", where his need to speak out to us about serious social and global issues is again evident but the level of sophistication and production complexity has increased exponentially, as has the level of emotion Michael puts into his performance. The local residents recruited for the video are awesome. It's clear that he really feels deeply what he has written about in this song, and it makes a striking and interesting video. Gives me goosepimples.

The MJ ideals are given another outing in ""They Don't Care About Us"", this is the Brazil version, with director Spike Lee providing an edgy forum for Michael's growing displeasure with ""them"", and frankly, given the impressive logistics that must have gone into filming this piece, I can't imagine anyone but Michael Jackson being able to pull it off. (Well... okay, maybe Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford, but they probably weren't available that day...)

Speaking of Spielberg, there he was amongst the movie and television luminaries (and holy primates, Batman, it's Bubbles the chimp, conversing with Suzanne Somers!) that were gathered to cameo in MJ's charming video ""Liberian Girl"", and here is one of the perfect examples of Michael's huge love of movies. He expressed in many interviews his fascination with film past and future, and after playing the scarecrow in ""The Wiz"", which he loved doing, it really fired his desire to express himself cinematically. The music, though in the background in the video, seems to have come right from a 1930's musical night club act. As you finally see him behind the camera at the end of the video, his joy at the fun of it is written all over his face; even though he seems a bit shy, he just beams. A sweet piece. So is the dedication to Elizabeth Taylor.

This joy and fun were also at the core of the (dare I say) immortal video ""Thriller"", which I dearly love, because Michael is so obviously having a blast and sharing that with us every minute. I've seen this video so many times, but somehow it (and the song) never gets old. The song all by itself is terrific, and the lyrics (and the inimitable Vincent Price's poetry delivery) always make me smile - having grown up fiercely addicted to the Friday night screamfest called ""Creature Features"" in my home town, I have happy memories of scaring myself silly watching classic horror films every week and dreaming of monsters and ghouls all night. However, none of them ever danced quite as wonderfully as Michael, and I will see his devilish grin and wolfish eyes at the end of this video in my mind forever. Quincy Jones and Michael Jackson was a match made in musical heaven and I'm sure they both knew it very well. Adding John Landis to the mix (after his success with ""Werewolf in London"") really frosted the cake and changed music video forever.

Also on this DVD is another very cinematic video, among my favorites - ""Smooth Criminal"".  Here MJ gets into a complex dance number with a sort of a gangsta plot that's really fun to watch, he gets to hoof it a la Fred Astaire (whom he named at 18 as one of his early inspirations) and we get a taste of his propensity to get kids into his videos. (The little boy who ""taught him all he knows"" and imitates MJ's moves is really cute. Wonder what he's doing now?) However - I would have liked to see more of Michael dancing alone in this video, instead of getting lost in the crowd so much. And wow, time for another stark contrast: look at ""Smooth Criminal"" and ""Blood on the Dance Floor"", where suddenly MJ doesn't look like a kid wearing Fred Astaire's costume anymore but rather a grown man with great presence and intensity and sexual energy (and OMG doesn't he look killer in dark red leather and satin! Whew!) I had not seen this video before, and he blew me away. Here he really is as much a trained dancer as he is a singer/composer. His body is filled out more, he moves with more forcefulness, he actually dances with a partner, and is really impressive in a rather overwhelmingly sensual video - lots of color and eye candy. Ignore the negative comments on this one, it's a keeper. As in the other video though, he gets lost in the crowd of other dancers too many times for my taste.  (Do all video editors have Attention Deficit Disorder? Stop hopping around, guys! Let the scene flow!)

Another surprise on this DVD is the MTV awards performance, which is almost worth the price of the thing all by itself. Lucky MTV audience! An extended live performance by any television measure, with perfectly timed pyro and Slashy geetar majic (if the guy wears any more jewelry he may electrocute himself on his guitar! hahaha), and several extended dance numbers (including a tantalizing portion of one of my all-time favorite MJ songs, ""Dangerous""), a reprise of ""You Are Not Alone"", and oh yes, kids. Michael seems extremely open, genuine and happy on this particular evening, a feeling seemingly not shared by Lisa Marie Presley, who the cameras hunt down and expose with rather sour and grumpy looks on her face.

And of course we get a full serving of Lisa Marie in the video ""You Are Not Alone"", which is a really great song, a beautiful sentiment, and very well sung ... but the video troubles me a bit. It seems to be another moment of Michael baring and sharing who he really is with us, and the intimacy becomes rather excruciating (not to mention extremely revealing!), and I haven't figured out who he is in it yet or what he really wants to say. The angel shots are a bit unsettling too, viewed in 2009... And right alongside this video in the ""Yikes, Michael, did you really have to tell us that?"" department is ""Childhood"", which I had not seen before, and for a moment I thought I was seeing Janet Jackson behind the soft focus! But of course it wasn't, and there were all these kids, with dreams in their eyes... and magical flying boats... and by the end of it I was sniffling, dammit. He's stripping off layers of himself again and I'm never quite ready, especially when he hits a nerve in my own complicated psyche.

Janet Jackson does however turn up with MJ in ""Scream"", a sort of space fantasy with very cool costumes and lots of special effects (Fred Astaire would have loved the dancing on the ceiling parts, Michael, another salute to the past from you) and lyrics that must have been very satisfying for both of the performing siblings to express, especially when directed at the media, and rather ironic to see now given the general crucifixion Michael got in the press in 2003-2005. This is a very interesting video visually, obviously cost a small fortune to produce, but not a song that stays with you terribly long. I enjoyed seeing the brother-sister dynamics though.

""Stranger in Moscow"" is another one I suspect was inspired by honest emotion on MJ's part, and heck, he might have even written it in Moscow; I'm sure he went there at some point, and I'm sure he was lonely. He was a (beloved) stranger all over the world and completely alone in huge masses of people. The pervasive loneliness of his life pops out at various moments in his music and interviews, and this video hits you in a stark place, is even shot in black and white to increase the detachment about which Michael sings. It brings forward the silence that is the flip side of all the hullabaloo and excitement of fame and touring and performing: it's the thoughts that come when you're alone in the middle of the night. Don't watch this video if you're contemplating suicide and it's raining.

Finally, the HIStory Volume II DVD treats us to a mind-numbing epilogue of sorts, which plunges us into a frenetic compressed hyper-edited Michael's-eye view of what his touring life was like. (Hey, let's hang a sign on the sound tower so the guy remembers where he is tonight!) It ends with what I'm sure was meant at the time of its release in 1995 as a positive, endearing, encouraging grabber of a teaser line: ""BRACE YOURSELF"".  We were to look forward, more to come, stay tuned!

Well, as they say in the movies, ""we wuz robbed"". His impassioned and improbable personal life has deprived us of the next iteration of Michael Jackson and all the fabulous ideas that were still rattling around in his marvelously talented brain. Personally I think that ""This Is It"" would have been just what he needed to turn it all around, and probably cathartic too, but I suppose it could have done damage if it had turned out to be less than the success the perfectionist that he was all his life he was used to, and needed. Sadly we'll never know. The good news is that his extensive musical legacy will live on for a long time, more things will appear out of various vaults and collections and get released to the public, and other performers will want to keep it alive in their own interpretations too. But to see the incomparable Michael Jackson, as he really was, in all his guises and disguises, you'll need all of the videos, warts and all. This DVD is a must for MJ collectors.",1252281600,,11102,4.598989898989899

1340406,5,B00004CWTY,"Nearly 2 hrs of goodies...Love the Teaser, & 1995 MTV Video Music Awards Performance with Lisa Marie in the audience; those were happy times I wish never ended.

My favorites on this DVD beside the MTV performance are Michael's duet; Scream with Janet, You Are Not Alone, Earth Song (FABULOUS video), They Don't Care About Us (Love the drums!) & the hauntingly beautiful Stranger in Moscow...

Blood On The Dance Floor is another one I love but this one is a different mix called; Refugee Camp Mix.  It's more mellow than the original one.  Can't decide if I like it or not; kind of grows on you.  I wish they would have put BOTH of them on this DVD.  But watching him dance with a partner in a club setting is definitely worth seeing.  Burgundy leather & his hair pulled back; what can you do?  Keep It In The Closet?

1340410,5,B00004CWTY,"I just loved this DVD from head to toe.  All videos are amazing and created with exceptional mastery.  My favorites are ""Liberian Girl"" and MJ's performance at the MTV awards. Liberian Girl features a lot of actors like John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John among others.  MJ doesn't appear in the whole video until the end.  It is like everybody is waiting for him to shoot the video and it turns out that MJ is directing it.
MJ's MTV performance is incredible. During his performance, Slash, the guitarist plays his guitar in a solo performance while MJ is dancing/singing.  After MJ is done with the singing, Slash keeps playing (I don't think this was part of the show). MJ asks him to stop and he doesn't.  MJ starts singing again while Slash keeps playing his solo... they had to unplug his guitar sound.  After the show MJ thanked Slash.  I guess you couldn't do anything out of the lines and MJ didn't really like it.  But, his performance is amazing.  This is a must have DVD!!

You can watch them again and again and never get tired of them...they're candy for your eyes. You just don't see many vidoes on this caliber.

1340428,3,B00004CWTY,"Unfortunately, this isn't it.  I purchased this DVD because it is the most highly recommended, fairly comprehensive on Amazon.  Still? This DVD seemed to be something lacking - with a plain, silver disk, and no booklet or anything outlining Michael's career.  I'm happy with the purchases I've made - this DVD, and the Dangerous DVD.  The cinematography for this one is terrific, what can I say?  But it doesn't have BAD.  It doesn't have LEAVE ME ALONE.  It doesn't have a few of the pieces History I has.  Boo!

Still, I do not even have any of the oldest videos Michael did in the early '80s.  Wouldn't it be nice to also have performances like BEN, and a few of the solo songs Michael did when he was with the Jackson 5???  Or how about a comprehensive package with EVERRRRYYYYTHINGGGG?!  I would PAY for that! The Jackson 5 Years! MJ's early 80's stuff, as well as songs like - ""Leave Me Alone"", and ""Bad"" and ""Beat It"".  It's time for a complete, comprehensive collection of Michael Jackson, for us die-hards.  Nothing less will do.

These current DVD's just aren't cutting it right now - they are fun to have, but grieving fans need something more.  So I'll be waiting to buy anything more with Michael Jackson until I can have it ALL!",1250035200,,1242,4.527027027027027

I went with Volume 2 of HIStory instead of Volume 1 because Volume 2 included Thriller, Smooth Criminal, and the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards performance, an excellent performance from an awesome entertainer.

1340474,4,B00004CWTY,"I owned ""Michael Jackson - History on Film vol. 2"" for years.  I've always wanted to get the second installment, but never did for one reason or another.  When Michael died, I knew it was time.

I watched it for the first time tonight, and I'm very bitter about two things.  ""Thriller"" and ""Beat It""'s videos were repeated on vol. 2 when they already appeared on vol. 1.  I wouldn't have minded a live version or either video, or maybe a ""making of"".  I was disappointed for their repeats, when there were several videos that could have taken their place, like ""Dirty Diana"", ""Keep it In the Closet"", ""Leave Me Alone"", etc. that would have been splendid.

Having said that, there are three points of highlight that makes this DVD worthwhile: the 1995 MTV Music Awards performance (OMG) and ""Scream"", which in its day was the most expensive video ever made, and the only one Michael did with Janet.  Last but not least, the first public performance of the moonwalk, on Motown's ""25: Yesterday, Today and Forever"", which rumored that MJ wasn't intending on performing in originally.  Aren't we glad that he did?

Make sure you know what you're getting before purchasing.  For my money, I would have bought vol. 1 only.

Side One:
1.  Program Start
2.  Teaser
3.  Billie Jean (Motown 25; Yesterday, Today and Forever)
4.  Beat it (the repeated video)
5.  Liberian Girl
6.  Smooth Criminal (not in its entirety... I could have sworn there was a whole nother part of this video that's missing)
7.  1995 MTV Video Music Awards Performance
8.  Thriller (the other repeated video in question)

Side 2:
1.  Scream
2  Childhood
3.  Earth Song
4.  You Are Not Alone
5.  They Don't Care About Us
6.  Stranger In Moscow
7.  Blood on the Dance Floor
8.  Brace Yourself (also a repeat from vol. 1 as far as I can see)",1248134400,,1802,4.561128526645768

Earth Song shows a strong message.  The whole cd has so much energy you can't sit still watching it!!  Michael was a special person! Such a great talent gone too soon!! I'm happy I grew up in the same era Michael grew up and remember what a great talent he is and always will be!! Thank You Michael!!",1247961600,,643,4.219512195121951
1340497,4,B00004CWTY,"There are some standout reasons to own this DVD:
- Smooth Criminal - The original version (from Moonwalker), not the horrible blurry remix video
- 1995 MTV VMA performance.  Amazing Dangerous choreography. Great medley.
- Billie Jean - Motown 25 performance - totally classic MJ moment in history.
- Videos from History hits like They don't really care about us, Scream, SiM, Earth Song
-$8.99? what a bargain for some of the greatest music videos of all time

Thriller and Beat It are amazing as always, but they were also on History - Video Greatest Hits (Vol. 1), so not sure they needed to be repeated here, when they could have added Leave me Alone or The Super Bowl performance to make it a better collection that goes together.  I would say this DVD would rule out needing the Vol 1. except Vol. 1 has the full versions of Bad, Remember the Time, B&W, and The Way you make me Feel, which makes it totally worth getting as well.  The two together make almost a complete collection.  I also highly recommend getting live in bucharest.  What would I love to see released?  One DVD with all the videos that were short films in their full lengths, the ones on these two dvds with Ghosts and You Rock my World added :)

One caveat, I find it really annoying that you have to flip the disc over 1/2 way through.  With a run time of 106 minutes there is no reason on earth it can't all be on one side.  That's probably my main reason for taking away a star.  However, I do think this is absolutely worth getting as Michael Jackson was a music video and performance genius!",1247788800,,1571,4.420138888888889
1340498,5,B00004CWTY,"Michael Jackson's heartbreaking death drew me, like so many others, to his music. Rediscovering familiar songs & videos was fun, but most meaningful to me has been acquiring an appreciation for the songs I was not as familiar with. Earth Song tops the list. The music video is hard to watch because it shows man's overwhelmingly cruel treatment of animals and the rape of the earth & rainforests, no doubt due to greed. I believe the song and video are pure Michael Jackson genius. The music is not only beautiful but haunting, and it sticks in your head-- along with the causes it promotes. It will move you to tears, and leave no doubt Michael put his heart and soul into crying out about these atrocities. It is a lasting, forever gift (along with all of the rest of his music) that he gave to us in his effort to make the world a better place. The best gift we could give back to him in return, would be to DO something-- however large or small, to stop the cruel slaughtering of animals & horrific destruction of earth & rainforests.
 There is no way you can go wrong adding this DVD to your collection. You will watch these videos again and again-- each and every one.",1247788800,,1174,4.435185185185185
1340499,5,B00004CWTY,"There are a couple of top reviews here that name everything in the video, so I won't go into too much detail on that. But I will justify my 5 stars to note that there are a few things here that may be hard to find for some people. A reviewer pointed out that the Motown 25th ""Billie Jean"" number had songs cut off, well, that is true and that does suck, I agree, but I'm sure I taped that on a VHS...10+ years ago and don't have it/can't find it/video won't play, so it is nice to have it again on DVD. I think this was a great performance, but to make it a true Michael Jackson experience it should have included his ENTIRE performance.

That said, we also get a performance from the 1995 Grammy Awards that is very good, great dancing, lovely performance and even get a dabble of MJ talking. Loved his soft, sweet voice. I bought this for ""Smooth Criminal"" and there are several versions of this video, but this is an extended cut, even if there are a couple minutes cut off. Consider it the ""long"" version.

""Scream"" is also a goodie, with two of my favorite Jackson's having fun, dance battling and just kicking butt in a great video while bashing the media at the same time. Priceless.

However, you can certainly tell the sound quality is very poor. For me this is most evident watching ""Thriller"" No base, no nothing, it sounded very flat. You can tell a bit on ""Smooth Criminal"" too. That is really bad. I also hate duel sided DVD's. Very cheap in my opinion.  Scene selection is OK, and I do like the title cards for each video, and love the teaser with MJ walking among soldiers to unveil his massive statue of himself. He had no idea how sexy he really was.

Overall, this video needs a third disc with more videos. It definitely leaves something to be desired. But the fact that there are a few things that are hard to find, even on YouTube in some cases, is great. I know we all saw these performances/videos in 1993 or whenever they aired, but those were usually once in a moment times on shows that were never rerun. That's it, they're gone. And when are actually videos shown nowadays? I don't want you to think you're getting great golden gems in extras anyway, basically it's a way for you to have some of his videos, maybe some of your favorites and a couple of nice live performances at hand. This is probably his best video DVD compilation to date.",1247616000,,2369,4.3386004514672685
1340500,5,B00004CWTY,"I bought both this and his History dvd (greatest hits on dvd).

If you are looking for incredible value this is probably the best way to get a pretty complete collection.  If you must only get one though, get History Volume 2.  It's about 20 minutes longer, and has many more tracks.

Here's why:  Not only does it have the staples you would expect such as Thriller (full length), Beat it, Smooth Criminal.

If you're like me, watching Thriller definitely brought back the great memories of the first time I saw it, maybe 25 years, who I was with, how much we were wowed.  It's funny how you can remember something just before you reexperience it.

It also has the live version of Billie Jean at the Motown 25 celebration in 1993, when he debuted the moonwalk.  Definitely, one of Michael's best performances, in my opinion probably the best.  That makes this a must own for that reason alone.

It also contains the 1995 MTV live performance, of Black or White with Slash going crazy with his guitar solo. You wonder if it's part of the act, or if he is genuinely possessed.

Scream with Janet, not a particular fan of the song, but love the video. Janet brings the attitude, an amazing video really.

You are not alone: with Lisa Marie Presley.  She brings the sexy and sensual in a very artful way, absolutely stunning. I have never seen Lisa Marie this way before. Hmmm..  In this video, Michael goes from being with her, to portraying an asexual angel half clad almost waist deep in water.  Perhaps Freud or Jung might be able to shed some light on this.

Childhood. A Peter Pan type ballad with children passing by overhead in a boat, no doubt a repesentation of his childhood passing by.  Have you seen my childhood...

Earthsong.  Quite a spectacular movie filmed over several continents.  Obviously, Michael was very serious about respecting life on the planet, and shows images of restoring life. Outstanding.

Blood on the Dance Floor.  I can't explain why I like this so much.  It's totally new to me, has a great vibe, and I just love it.

There is also a starstudded Hollywood video.  I was surprised to see both John Travolta, and Olivia Newton John among many others.

Now, if you are considering getting the first dvd as well, there is a little duplication.  It also has Thriller, and Beat it.  Billie Jean is the video version, so not a duplication.

Highlights of that dvd include: Bad, the 18 minute version directed by Martin Scorsese, The Pharaoh video with Eddie Murphy, Imam, and Magic Johnson, Black or White with the infamous Panther Dance, The Way you make me feel with the model and the car, and the destruction sequence at the end. That dvd is about 20 minutes shorter.

If you are like me and you cannot decide which one to get, get both. Because I don't think you can get such a comprehensive collection any other way, and I find it to be incredible to get most of the best videos of probably the greatest entertainer who definitely made the best videos at this price. I certainly will be checking out Lisa Marie again.

I hope this was helpful.",1247356800,,3075,4.564899451553931
1340501,5,B00004CWTY,"Who'd ever think I'd end up picking up this DVD,something I've thought of doing for years right after his passing?Hopping on the bandwagon?Nope. Just seemed as right a time as any. I picked this one up because looking at the video selection I could see that this was a very interesting video collection. Unlike a lot of people in this day and age Michael Jackson is less interesting to me as a phenomenon than as a musical entity. And that is what you get here-14 videos and 1 hour,46 minutes of MJ videos. Michael's musical talent had two parts:one audio and one visual and both were equally as penetrating and powerful. This is a double sided DVD.On the first side...well sentimentality aside you get Michael Jackson at the height of his game,doing his famous dance on Motown 25. It's called the backstep (the moonwalk is the same basic move done in a circle) but by whatever name it's the dance that propelled Michael into an entertainer in the league of Sammy Davis and Fred Astaire. Between ""Smooth Criminal"",""Thriller"" and ""Beat It"" you see more of MJ doing his stuff that dazzled me and everyone else in the 80's. You could be cynical now and say ""well he ripped off his moves from James Brown or whoever and just made them faster paced"" but I don't;not even people who try today can move exactly the way he does. Here he was in a league of his own.""Liberian Girl"" is very atypical of an MJ video as it takes the form of a comical rehersal featuring some of MJ's celebrity friends-he himself only makes a brief appearance at the end. His 1995 American Music Awards performance point to some of the content on the second side of the DVD. Six of the eight videos featured on it are from his intense 1995 album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HIStory-Past-Present-and-Future-Book-I/dp/B0000029LG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I</a>&nbsp;and find a very different Michael Jackson,a man with a broken reputation and in a far more uncertain place. Because each video tells a different kind of story I'll review them seperately:
SCREAM
 Actually one of my favorite of Michaels later videos,this duet with sister Janet features a busy,angry mixture of sci-fi and different forms of emotional metaphores from smashing guitars Pete Townsand style to anime and other things I'm not sure of. It's one of his angriest songs and the video is a great document of internal torment
CHILDHOOD
 Yes the video is overly cutesy and it's clear it was set up to inspire a lot of MJ bleeding heart-ism. But whether he sacrificed his childhood for the benifit of our entertainment or not it's rather strange for him to emphasize the issue of his childhood and other children (floating in the sky on boats Peter Pan style) in this kind of way. It's one of his most personal songs even if the video seems a bit planned.
YOU ARE NOT ALONE
  This video says more about Michaels personal life than it planned. An overly effeminine looking MJ is seen rather withdrawn from his obviously wanton wife Lisa Marie and,an image of him with angel wings aside is a non to sudtle expression of his romantic uncertainties. It's a bit too alienated feeling to be really sexy but it isn't a bad video and great to watch.
EARTH SONG
  A video such as this is something I support for the most part. Michael is clearly saddened genuinely by the terrible plight of environmental damage and war. And the imagry of poached elephants,pollution,starvation and despire WILL make you think about what we don't often see or choose to see. But.....the ending is rather questionable:Michael depicting himself as some biblical type hero who alone has the power to reverse the worlds ills and wrongs. Not to speak ill of the dead but is this his take on benevolance or...a distressing detour into near full blown meglomania? Maybe both,maybe neither. Either way it's an amazing visual experience,if having more questions than answers.
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT US
  Here's a great video! Michael dancing through the streets with a chorus of drummers. Even though he's indulging in some heavy self victimization here (the infamous ""jew me/sue me"" line is carefully rolled over with pounding drums so as not to be heard) it's great to see Michael dancing again in his videos,even if it's in a more angry state of mind.
STRANGER IN MOSCOW
  Dealing with depression in video was kind of overdone during the 90's (sorry) but this again says more about MJ's state of mind at the time than it probably meant to. Another B&W video here Michael is NOT dancing happily but taking a sad,lonely walk through a dank,rainy city where time itself draws to a hault. Considering his situation from this point until now..........this is the most haunting visualization of his woes of later life.
BLOOD ON THE DANCEFLOOR
  Admitedly this was from a time where Michael Jackson's transformation from respected performer/singer/composer into a huge media circus was a bit of a turn off for me. Michael is a rather static figure here at a funky retro 70's dance party and there are similarities to ""Smooth Criminal"" and ""Thriller"". But it's kind of repeating past glories and isn't saying anything all that new for him in the video arena.

  The ending of the video is kind of a long litany of the...well kind of idolotry that REALLY turned me off. Of course it begins the same way with the VERY infamous HIStory teaser that....well it's hard not to see it as either an expression (or parody) of pure meglomania and self obsession. Whatever it was based on,either that or Michael's yearning to to an epic film about his own idolotry is still a mystery. It's beyond over the top and is the only thing here or that Michael had ever done that qualifies as kitch to me. But that luckily doesn't take too much away from the other marvels,old and new to be found on this DVD that serve to remind us of his talents in the medium of music video.",1247097600,,5940,4.809803921568627

1340503,5,B00004CWTY,"I had not followed much of MJ's music for a few years, but this DVD definitely left me in awe. I had to watch the MTV performance 3 times. Michael Jackson was truely the greatest entertainer of our time when it comes to his command of the stage, the feeling he put into his music, and his art of dance combined with that wonderful voice. We may never see an entertainer with all these gifts rolled into one for a long time, if ever again! I can understand why millions of people mourned his passing. He was truely a great artist.

1340504,5,B00004CWTY,"This DVD contains some of Michael Jackson's finest work.  I grew up with the Jackson 5.  They are woven into the tapestry of my life and I never knew how much until Michael died. The mainstream cuts such as ""Billy Jean"", ""Beat It"", etc... are the classics you never get tired of watching, but ""You are not alone"", ""Earth Song"", and ""They don't care about us"", ""Childhood"", ""Stranger in Moscow"", is pure genius. If you love Michael, you'll love this DVD. Trust me.",1247011200,,463,4.566265060240964

Out of a possible 5 Stars, I give this a 10! Best Music Video I ever saw! Combined with genius level MUSIC to go along with it. The man had more talent in his little finger than most have in their entire bodies. You really shouldn't miss out on this! After having watched it, YOU'LL BE NO LESS THAN AWESTRUCK! I can almost guarantee, You Will Not Be Disappointed! The color picture quality is absolutely stunning! The Sound Mix is audiophile 24-bit (Stereo/5.1 Surround) quality which seemingly puts you right into the video, You are There! ""Up Front And In Your Face"". AND YES! These are FULL VERSION AUDIO/VIDEO tracks. 106 Minutes of pure brilliance! I had to take a double take on the price! It's unbelievably if not ridiculously low! About half the price I paid when it first came out. Watched the video at another hard core rock collectors home on a 40,000.00 dollar stereo system, and knew immediately after watching it, I HAD TO HAVE IT! and the best part is, I never get tired of watching it. Very impressive if you want to show case your huge 60"" screen or sound system.

Songs that really hit home! EARTH SONG, CHILDHOOD, LIBERIAN GIRL, YOU ARE NOT ALONE, 95' MTV MUSIC AWARDS PERFORMANCE, THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT US, STRANGER IN MOSCOW, SCREAM (w/Janet Jackson).....Seriously!

My condolences to the Jackson Family! We Feel The Loss!
In my own heartfelt words, I can not help but feel, Michael will be up there right along with the Almighty, Planning out the new Heavens and never ending Universe. He was truly a highly inventive and creative artist! HE WAS! A True Child Of God! Now promoted to higher power of being! So I don't pray he rests in peace! But fully alive and even more so now! God Bless You Michael! You my friend have been blessed to finally leave this cruel planet and all it's money mongering witch hunt finger pointers.

And may I respond to the ignorance of those who have made ugly remarks in false judgment towards MJ. The man was not a child molester, he was a very kind and giving person who gave LOVE to those who had NONE! Anyone who went after his money by falsely accusing Michael will one day meet their maker! He Was Never Found Guilty! and in this country, You are INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY! It would be completely ignorant of anyone to think any differently.

The album is the best selling Double Album in History! And for a VERY GOOD REASON! BUY IT! You won't regret it!",1246147200,,2937,4.542533081285444

1340532,5,B00004CWTY,"There are some amazing high-lights in this video that just remind a person exactly why Michael Jackson reached such off-the-scale stardom in the first place.

There is the performance that he put on at the MTV Awards in about 1995, which gives you the Billie Jean performance all over again - only much better.  By now, Michael Jackson has developed with an extra inner magic as an addition to what he already had.  He is even slicker and even more cool.

Among many of my favourite short films is Earth Song.  Not only is it a hugely powerful song but, combined with the powerful visual images, it reaches the heart and imagination with great impact.  This work is hugely unconventional and deep with meaning. It just took my breath away.

""Michael Jackson: History on Film, Vol. II"" demonstrates the artist's growth and development since those incredible old days.",1134777600,,866,4.8108108108108105

No matter what the press says, he is truly amazing & one of a kind! The 1995 MTV performance is just show stopping & the proof is in the standing ovation he gets when he finishes. I also loved the Blood on the dance floor video because for the first time, it shows Michael partner dancing with another girl which looks hot. I like the teaser at the beginning & it has a better version of the Smooth Criminal video than the Number Ones DVD. It even includes the legendary Motown 25 performance where he performs Billie Jean & for the first time, does his iconic moonwalk. This DVD is a must have for all fans & those who want to see some of Michael's best work!",1127520000,,834,4.122699386503068
1340534,4,B00004CWTY,This has to be one of the best MJ videos on the market. I recommend it.,1125187200,,71,3.5
1340535,5,B00004CWTY,I really enjoyed the DVD.  It's very entertaining and it has some songs that do not appear in his other DVDs.  I was well worth it's cost.,1122940800,,138,4.074074074074074
1340546,5,B00004CWTY,"If I could only pick one dvd of music videos from all of my favorite artists, this would be what I would pick. This dvd is the real enchilada. It comes packed with MJ's most recent and cutting-edge videos, along with several classic videos that brought him to be known not only as the king of pop, but the also the king of music videos. He set a deadly precedent from early on in his career, with such videos as ""Beat It"", ""Billie Jean"", ""Smooth Criminal"", and of course, ""Thriller"". It is tough to consistently live up to such great expectations when so many prior videos have been legendary, but I feel Michael certainly did not fail to please with the newer videos that went with his ""HIStory"" CD. Most of us at one point or another have seen the majority of Michael's older films. This dvd offers a look at several of his videos that were rarely seen on television in the U.S. ""Scream"", a duet with sister Janet, is probably the best known short film from the HIStory cd, and rightfully so. The special effects and dancing is simply amazing, and the song itself is quite intoxicating. Another great video that is lesser known is ""They Don't Care About Us"". This song features an awesome percussion beat along with rocking guitar sounds. The video is directed by Spike Lee and features the Brazilian percussion group Olodum. It was shot on the streets of Brazil, and is a very powerful video. Perhaps the most emotionally moving video is ""Earth Song"", which is a deep and soulful song, mourning for the Earth as we do various things to destroy it. The video shows various kinds of destruction, ranging from the clearing of rain forests, industrial pollution, poaching, and war. The presentation is absolutely astounding.

The video works to show how several factors come together to impact people and animals all over the world. I am not a man to shed a tear very often, but this video was a tear-jerker even for me. The video is beautiful, with the overall message that there is still time to turn things around. ""Stranger In Moscow"" is yet another marvelous video, trading dancing and blatant messages for a more subtle symbolism. Even in the absence of MJ's signature dancing, this is a more than satisfying video. ""You Are Not Alone"" is another of his newer works on this dvd. This is a poignant song that really showcases the range of Michael's voice. The video features his then-wife Lisa Marie Presley. It is a solid video, but this reviewer feels the video doesn't quite do the song justice. The two live performances included on this dvd are a special treat. The ""Billie Jean"" performance from the Apollo is when Michael first debuted the moonwalk. In this day when we are used to seeing a singer on stage accompanied by tons of backup dancers, it is refreshing to see Michael, on the stage alone delivering a stellar performance, singing and dancing his heart out. The 15 minute MTV performance is yet another jaw-dropping show. Michael performs a medley of ""Don't Stop Til You Get Enough"", ""Scream"", ""Beat It"", ""Black or White""(featuring Slash) and ""The Way You Make Me Feel"". He delivers full performances of ""Dangerous"" (mesmerizing dancing!)and ""You Are Not Alone"". The newer videos which are overall stellar, combined with some of Michael's best earlier works make this an unrivaled music dvd. Morever, there is all kinds of music here. Some songs make you want to get out of your chair and dance, some are smooth and relaxing, some are very thought-provoking, some are rebellious, and some are even lugubrious. Overall, it is a tempting schmear for the emotions and the senses. The vast majority of the videos are as awesome to see as they are to hear. Even if you are not an MJ fan, the entertainment value is still outstanding with this dvd. If you aren't sure why Michael is regarded as the King of Pop, watching this dvd should leave you with no questions.",1120780800,,3879,4.687683284457478
1340547,4,B00004CWTY,"I bought the number ones dvd and the dangerous dvd as well as this dvd. Many of the videos are the same on all 3 disc however the long version of black or white on the number ones disc i beleive and the long version to ""The Way You Make Me Feel is on the number ones dvd. Also the number ones goes up to 2000 with ""You Rock My World"" while History II goes up to 1991. You do get dirty diana on the number ones but the short version to Smooth Criminal on it. The long version to smooth criminal is  on this dvd. Many of the same videos from the 80's are on History I and II dvds which is why didn't get History I. I do however have the History Book I album. The volume II dvd also has the incomplete edited version to They don't care about us which I was disappointed in. However in the book I cd it is unedited which came out before the controversial part of the video. The video is longer also. I wish they would have put You Are Not Alone and Speed Demon on the disc. Speed Demon was animated with a rabbit with Mike on a motorcycle while Leave Me Alone had an amusement park ride Mike was riding in and he got up and the miniature roller coaster built on him fell apart. Really cool. I was expecting those songs to be on the History cd as well. Thats one of the greatest songs ever that i grew up with. The dangerous cd is one of the best because it has one repeatitive songs on it because its the whole dangeous album. The songs on it aren't on any of the other dvds expect remember the time which is a great video with Eddie Murphy Emon and Magic Johnson. I love In the Closet with Niomi Campbell its about my favorite song on dangerous.",1105401600,,1642,4.0060975609756095

That video features MJ's sister Janet,who's freaky like her brother. Take note of two censorships when the video is seen on MTV or VH1. The second word of the quoted line in SCREAM that goes ""stop f---ing with me"" is muted and also during that,Janet ""flips the digit"" which is blurred. Sorry,they're just following FCC regulations.

1340550,5,B00004CWTY,"Michael Jackson does it again with HIStory on Film: Volume II. This DVD features 14 short films (3 featured on Michael's other DVD) on a two-sided DVD designed to blow you away! Michael Jackson's ability to excite the millions who listen to his music and watch his short films is just magical and mystical, but cool nonetheless.
This is the lineup on this DVD:
SIDE ONE:
1. Program Start - nothing really, just the title screen pretty much.
2. Teaser - The promotional video used for the HIStory album features the unveiling of a gigantic statue of Michael Jackson. very cool to watch, and sets you up for the rest of the video.
3. Billie Jean (Motown 25 Performance)- The 1983 performance of Michael's hit ""Billie Jean"" where Michael debuted the most awe-inspiring dance move in history, the Moonwalk. This concert received an Emmy nomination and is the landmark for Michael's ability to perform in front of many. A good performance overall.
4. Beat It - Featured on the first HIStory DVD, titled ""Video Greatest Hits: HIStory"", this video contains outstanding choreography and excellent dance moves by Michael. A good video for any Michael Jackson fan.
5. Liberian Girl - A very rare music video featuring many A-list actors like John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, Corey Feldman (huge MJ fan), Dan Akroyd and Steve Guttenberg, as well as musical icons like ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, Paula Abdul, and producer Quincy Jones. A great video, a must see.
6. Smooth Criminal - The full version taken from the 1988 movie ""Moonwalker"" features very complex choreography and good music and plot. A very good short film to watch.
7. 1995 MTV Video Music Awards Performance -  Michael Jackson performed a 15-minute medley of past and present hits including ""The Way You Make Me Feel"", ""Dangerous"", ""Billie Jean"", and ""You Are Not Alone"". This outstanding performance literally stole the show and is forever known as one of the greatest Michael Jackson performances to this date.
8. Thriller - Also taken from the first Michael Jackson DVD, this is the masterpiece that made Michael Jackson a household name. Choreography and a plot ""to die for"" make this a must-see for all people, MJ fans or not.
SIDE TWO:
1. Scream (Duet With Janet Jackson) - Michael released this music video in 1995. The video features cool dance moves, dazzling special effects and other sweet tidbits, making it one of the most popular (and the most expensive) music video ever made!
2. Childhood (Theme from Free Willy 2) - Michael Jackson really touches the heart with this video. Although it seems childish at times (children riding in flying boats, that kind of stuff), this is a side of Michael Jackson that people tend to ignore. A good video and song indeed.
3. You Are Not Alone - Michael's most sensitive video in my opinion. Not only does it prove that Michael can be sensitive and calm in his music videos, it also proves that Michael is not afraid to go shirtless (lol). A touching and sensitive video, a must-see.
4. Earth Song - One word: MASTERPIECE. No other word can sum up the single most influential, most magnificent, most sensitive video Michael Jackson has ever made. An outstanding song with a more outstanding video. The title seems corny, but a corny video this ain't! See for yourself!
5. They Don't Care About Us - Two versions of this video were made. This is the version that takes place in Brazil. This video proves that Michael can do it all. Great moves accompanied by a great beat emphasized by drummers featured in the video. A great video to watch and enjoy.
6. Stranger In Moscow - A simple yet solemn video featuring Michael walking down a street in Moscow. The video is purposely in slow motion, so no, it is not a problem with your DVD player. This video is sort of dark, maybe it's the weather in it, but it is a good video that can touch a person's heart.
7. Blood On The Dance Floor (Refugee Camp Remix) - By far the worst video on the DVD. I saw the original video, and it was great. Why didn't they use that? oh well. The video's okay, but the song I guess does not fit it. It's just not Michael Jackson I guess.
8. Brace Yourself (A Kaleidoscope of Michael Jackson HIStory) - Featured on the first Michael Jackson DVD, this is not a short film, but rather a look into the career of Michael Jackson and the impact he has had on the music industry as well as the world. This puts out the simple message: Brace Yourself.",1073088000,,4422,4.654731457800511

This is one great DVD and it should definitley be in your collection!",1071792000,,342,4.276923076923077
1340552,5,B00004CWTY,"This DVD by Michael Jackson, features 13 of his greatest music videos and television performances, from 1983 to 1997.
The most outstanding performance on this DVD would have to be the live version of ""Billie Jean"", which was performed way back in 1983. This was the very first time that Michael ever performed the ""moonwalk"" in public, and the rest is HIStory.
Other highlights include 1989's ""Liberian Girl (from BAD)""
""Smooth Criminal (short version)"", a ""1995 MTV performance""
""Scream"", ""You Are Not Alone"", and ""Blood on the Dance Floor.""
It was great to finally have ""Smooth Criminal"" on DVD. I also own the VHS ""Moonwalker (1988)"", but the tracking on the video has gone to hell. Now I can watch ""Smooth Criminal"", whenever I want to, along with ""Billie Jean (live)"", ""Beat It"" and ""Thriller"", which I also own on VHS as well.
Any fan of great dancing, catchy beats, R&B, and phenominal directing, would enjoy this treat by the King of Pop,
""Michael Jackson."" Hopefully, he'll put out another DVD in the near future (maybe ""Moonwalker?"").",1066176000,,1044,4.903954802259887

The King of Pop, Rock and Soul brings us an exciting international flavor in his mixture of unique and upbeat songs and dances.  Earth Song shines brighter than the rest, with the truth about the earth and what we humans are doing to it.  Grab the tissues, preparing for your tears to flow.  Then go out and do something positive to help heal the world.",1057190400,,410,4.426666666666667

The photography / camera, editing compilation is excellent. Can be avoided two similar tracks such as Bille Jen, and against that could have provided any one additional new track. OTHERWISE LIBRARY COPY, one should have it.",1034467200,,449,4.555555555555555

Technically they are flawless and interesting. If you are Michael fan - you'll love this. If you are not - getting this CD will let you see the creative talent of him, his producers, writers and directors have been.
Children will love the visuals and adults should get the messages. This is a fun DVD for everyone to watch and enjoy at home. I just wish it had commentary by him making these videos. That would have been the best ever!",1024876800,,664,4.40650406504065
1340576,5,B00004CWTY,"Anyone who is even vaguely familiar with The King of POP knows that he likes to make mini movies instead of normal length videos. Some of the videos are cut mercifully short, getting rid of tedious story lines. This is nice. I just want to see the dancing, the music and the special effects.
HIStory volume two is just marvelous to watch over and over. One of the complaints I have is that the segment Brace Yourself is used on both volumes one and two...
Although volume one has the bare essentials from the early years, volume two has the superior videos. That only makes sense because they are newer. Volume two also has more political, earth and world themes. His anger at the media comes out in these videos. You must check out the Grammy award winning Scream.",1018915200,,765,4.510791366906475

1340579,5,B00004CWTY,"The HIStory On Film, Volume II DVD is an AWESOME disc for those who wanted MORE after buying HIStory On Film or is a suuuper DVD for any collector or Michael Jackson lover. The only fault in the DVD is that it must be flipped to view the second session of its content. It is STILL DEFINITELY a 5-star DVD! It's only a little annoying when you're loafing, dazed by the Michael magic, to pry yourself from your sofa to flip the disc.
Side One is a collection of the greatest performances and classic hits (2 which weren't on HIStory On Film). The compliation is a nice little memory trip. If you're a kid, it is nice to catch some of those old moments that you weren't around to see.
:::Side One:::
~*~ Teaser [from 'HIStory' Album]
~*~ Motown 25: Billie Jean Performance [ Michael Jackson's first MOONWALKING !]
~*~ Beat It
~*~ Liberian Girl
~*~ Smooth Criminal (phenominal full-lenth video)
~*~ 1995 MTV Video Music Awards Performance
~*~ Thriller
Side Two may have been separated from Side One because of its content. Michael Jackson has always liked to be family friendly in his lyrics and videos. However, Side Two features 'SCREAM' in which Janet Jackson flashes the finger, and 'You Are Not Alone' with Michael Jackson and his beloved ex-wife Lisa Marie Presley next to nude. You will still want to watch the 'Earth Song' video which is, to say the least, stunning and 'Brace Yourself', an awesome collage sort of piece.
:::Side Two:::
~*~ Scream
~*~ Childhood [song featured in FREE WILLY 2]
~*~ You Are Not Alone
~*~ Earth Song [an emotional masterpiece]
~*~ They Don't Care About Us [South American version]
~*~ Stranger In Moscow
~*~ Blood On The Dance Floor [Refugee Camp remiX]
~*~ Brace Yourself [klaleidoscope of Michael-mania]
The whole DVD aims to please and is stellar! 'SMOOTH CRIMINAL' will have you dancing for days, while 'EARTH SONG' will keep you crying for years to come. Well worth the petty 17 dollars!! A piece of music history.",1006300800,,1954,4.699708454810495
1340580,3,B00004CWTY,"I was thinking perhaps it's just my DVD, but it appears others are having an issue with the DVD sound quality. I like the videos on DVD format because that way you can skip over to the next if you don't like the one you're watching. I happen to skip over Beat It and Thriller. I'm not and never was one to like either of those songs or videos. I would say the same for Billie Jean if it was the video.
I also dislike the fact that it is a 2 sided disc and fail to understand why it is?
On the upside and why I gave it a 3 is because Michael Jackson is by far my favorite entertainer. I am an admirer of him by his works (music, videos, etc) as well as by his personal strength to continue on with life, regardless.
Watching Liberian Girl after all of these years, makes me wonder where, in the world, are some of these old stars? Where did they go to?
Unfortunately, I seem to skip over Smooth Criminal video, which is a shame because Smooth Criminal is my favorite video of all time. But due to the sound quality on the DVD...it just isn't worth listening to or watching.
As far as the HIStory videos themselves, fantastic for those of us that live in America. We rarely get to see They Don't Care About Us, Stranger In Moscow, and Earth Song!
Honestly, if you're not a Michael Jackson fan, skip the DVD and just buy the VHS if you are thinking about buying this. The dvd is nothing special and no extras, other than the lyrics...",999820800,,1431,4.151079136690647
1340581,4,B00004CWTY,"A great collection of some of Michael's most famous work (Thriller, Smooth Criminal) as well as videos we've rarely seen (Liberian Girl, Earth Song, etc.). This disc makes you remeber why he is one of the greatest entertainers of this century.
Two Highlights of this disc are: 1)Michael's 1995 MTV Awards performance. It's probably his single best performance of  his career. 15 minutes of singing and dancing to five or six of his past hits and finishing off with ""You Are Not Alone"" in front of a choir. 2)A Special feature that allows you to read the lyrics of the song as you watch the videos.
The only negative is the fact that you have to flip the disc over. For some reason it's on two sides. Other than that, Enjoy!",994809600,,723,4.519083969465649

1340603,5,B00004CWTY,"I don't care if you don't like Michael Jackson, you might think he is too weird or too much like a stereotypical popstar; his very apparant enormous ego might put you off, but . . . THE MAN HAS TALENT. And it is all on History Vol2.
The highlights of this package are without doubt
 -Smooth Criminal (encapsulates all of Mj's dance moves)
 -95 MTV award performance (special appearance by Slash for guns & roses + a great array of songs)
 -SCREAM (Janet and Michael duet set in a spaceship - it is very spectacular and the beat grows on you)
 -Billy Jean live performance (so far i have not seen one person take their eyes of the TV whenever this is on, I still can't after 50 viewings.
These are the highlights, there are heaps of other songs
-Liberian Girl (clip with heaps of celebs)
-Beat it
-thriller (the whole clip with intro)
-Earth song
-Childhood
-Stranger in Moscow
-They don't really care about us
-Blood on the dancefloor
The so called 'teaser' intro is unbelievable.  It sounds great and looks fantastic.  The 'teaser' shows Michael being treated as some kind of military leader at the unveiling of his huge gold statue (strange). Anyway it is worth a laugh, and it does look cool.
The end song is a package containing footage from many overcrowded Jackson concerts with Excalibur music in the background. He will return.

The first, ""Liberian Girl,"" is a  beautiful ballad, and the celebrity-filled video is one of Jacko's rarely  seen videos. The other, ""Scream,"" which was the most expensive  video ever made has Michael and his sister, Janet, in a futuristic  spaceship setting, that was beautifully directed by Music Video guru Mark  Romanek (Madonna's ""Bedtime Story"" was also his work).
