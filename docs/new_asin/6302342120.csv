Yes, Domingo still thrashes about on the stage but singing one note and resting on his laurels. The Met was once a great house and this is the end of that age - without the greatness. Don't waste your time on such trivia. Had this been done a couple decades earlier with REAL voices (Nilsson, Tucker, Merrill, Moffo, Peters, Tozzi, Hines) and REAL conductors like Cleva instead of that idiot Levine, Then you'd have seen what the Met was all about.  This isn't it except for the easily impressed and who don't know opera.",1282780800,4,658,4.483333333333333
455073,5,6302342120,"This is a very special dvd to ahve for any opera lover. Mix of old greats with their future counterparts. Luciano and Domingo fun and in great voice, a delightful setting for the ""guests""parts, so many to choose from.  This is the magic the Met used to have. Kathleen Battle was glorious, and Freni was not bad in Adriana, Millo stupendous in the Chenier, delightful and full of great singing and performing values.  a must have for any opera fan, and much better in DVD than the VHS.",1280880000,7,484,4.488636363636363
455074,5,6302342120,"The year 1991 is significant, in that it saw the dividing line between the 'glorious 20th century' of western opera, and the afterward decline.
In this wonderful gala, we have a handsome array of male voices, but less significant line up of female voices.
The excerpts from Rigoletto and Otello represented the two major 'calling cards' of the operatic kings of the century - Pavarotti as the Duke of Mantua, and Placido Domingo as Otello.
That said, with great sets and great orchestration to match, one sees the start of the wane of the prime of Luciano Pavarotti, not so much vocally, but definitely visually, as the Duke of Mantua. As for Domingo, his Otello was simply the best visually, but alas, vocally he was just one jot too 'velvety' and soft-grained for this extremely dramatic role.
The excerpt from Die Fledermaus features the German baritone Hermann Prey in the latter part of his career. While he is not one bit past his prime, it is still a bit too harsh to demand his performance as Papageno, a role he treasured greatly in his heydays, pairing up with none other than the great Fritz Wunderlich.
All three gentlemen rightfully claimed to represent the best of male operatic singing of the second part of the 20th century, with a welcomed addition in the person of Thomas Hampson.
As for the ladies, perhaps the story is a bit different. To an Asian listener like myself, the best performance still rested with Mirella Freni, though she, like Pavarotti and Prey, could no longer be considered to be in her absolute prime in this performance.
In an age when Callas was gone and Tebaldi and Gencer retired and Scotto in the wane, Freni was about the only truly 'major' soprano left on the operatic stage in the last decade of the 20th century.
I regret to have to say that, good even though they are, the other sopranos in this show simply weren't in the same league as Freni, despite the fact that most of them were in their absolute prime in 1991!
Cheryl Studer and June Anderson not surpassing Freni in bel canto, Aprile Millo not surpassing Freni in lyical spinto.
The only consolation is in Anne Sofie von Otter, who convinced me that von Stade and Horne had found a rightful heiress in her.",1280880000,9,2212,4.645408163265306
455075,5,6302342120,"Another VHS that I can finally retire! This is probably my favorite Met video. The Fledermaus ""guest performances"" are priceless. It's fun to see Domingo and Pavarotti joking around before starting the Boheme Act IV duet, and Hermann Prey's Papageno always makes me smile.",1278720000,8,272,5.204545454545454
455076,5,6302342120,"I owned a laserdisc of this program until I had to get rid of it when the 12"" laserdisc was outmoded in Taiwan.  Since then, I have waited for it reissue in the form of DVD, but it never came out until now.  I ordered from AMAZON right away.  I got it from the mail two days ago and have been re-acquainting the tape for the past two days. I used to like it a lot and I like it even more now.

RIGOLETTO & OTELLO both in Act III are of course brilliantly performed.  But I like Rigoletto better not because it's better performed but because I don't like the story of Otello at all.  Otello is such a pathetic character that it's disgusting to watch.  I kind of think that Shakespeare is a racist here that he should portray Otello to be such a jerk; besides Act III doesn't have beautiful aria or arias like the duet in Act I and the ""Willo Song"" in Act 4. I really wish that the last Act was presented instead of Act III.

Now let's come to the main attraction of the evening or the Gala:  All the artists are above average but I would like to mention the ones that I like better.  Federica von Stade's high mezzo soprano works to her advantage in Offenbach's aria; she has always been one of my favorites.

Thomas Hampson, tall and handsom, swashbuckling in ""Largo al factotum"". His high baritone works to his advantage in this like von Stade.

June Anderson, was regarded by many to be a second Joan Sutherland-even looks like her, not only looks good but also sings brilliantly.

Aprile Millo, carries herself like a diva but, she, nevertheless has the artistry to complement her deportment.  Her ""La mamma morta"" is movingly beautiful.

Kathleen Battle, hers is the sweetest and most beautiful instrument of the evening.  She too carries herself like a diva and has the technique and artistry to match. Dispite all the negative reports of her unprofessional conducts in real life, I still cherish her, BEAUTIFUL AND TALENTED.

Mirella Freni's ""Io son l'umile ancella"" still shines with sheen and lustre of yesteryears.

The evening appropriately closes with the two giants of that time. Pavarotti and Domingo with lots of fanfares befit
the Gala.

The Met's 25th Anniversary Gala is brilliantly presented as only the Met could.",1278028800,4,2232,4.562814070351759
455077,5,6302342120,"This is the first time that this ""1991 GALA"" is on DVD.  For years I have owned the Laserdisc version but it was getting too worn and the video and audio were suffering.  But for some strange reason, DG never put this on DVD....until now.  Thanks DG.

Well, ya really gonna love this Gala.  Wrapped up in a spectacular DVD is Act III of ""RIGOLETTO""...the Otto Schenk production with Luciano Pavarotti, Leo Nucci, Cheryl Studer and Nicolai Ghaurov;  the Act III of ""OTELLO""...that wonderful old production of Franco Zeffirelli with Placido Domingo, Mirella Freni and Justino Diaz;  and the icing on the cake:  Act II of Otto Schenk's ""DIE FLEDERMAUS"" with Hermann Prey, Barbara Daniels and Anne Sofe Von Otter.  The gala-within-the gala sequence in ""Fledermaus"" will dazzle you with many of the Met Stars of their day.  The singing is magnificent!  The Pavarotti/Domingo duet is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

The video and audio (DTS) are to DG's highest standards.

Don't miss out on this one.",1277510400,34,997,4.96969696969697
455078,5,6302342120,"Although the description indeed refers to the ""Metropolitan Opera Gala 1991 - 25th Anniversary at Lincoln Center"", the picture refers to ""James Levine's 25th Anniversary - Metropolitan Opera Gala"", which took place in 1996 and of which there is also a DVD. I have asked DGG several times whether they would issue a DVD of the 1991 Gala, but they have no intention doing so. I wonder how this mix up came into being, but it's not only happening at Amazon.

When I get offer from Amazon this DVD and realized that it wasn't similar to the Centennial Metropolitan Gala that I bought before I got it.
I can say that I liked the fragments of the three different operas (Act III of Rigoletto III act from Otello and the last one from Die Fledermaus, but I enjoyed the last part the most when some of the artists performed as guests different areas from other operas using the palace scenery of the last opera. At first I was very confused when Hermann Prey who played Gabriel von Eisenstain was the first to participate in this ""concert"" singing ""Ein Madchen oder Weibchen"" from The Magic Flute because I that it was part of the opera,but then the rest of the participants sang different areas as they were also guests in the palace,all sang very wellIt was very emotional for Pavarotti and Placido Domingo to sing together the duet from the last Act of La Boheme.
I am glad I bought this wonderful DVD.
