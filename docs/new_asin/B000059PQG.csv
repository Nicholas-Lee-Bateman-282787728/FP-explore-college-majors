1409193,5,B000059PQG,"This DVD offers some great episodes of Flip, notably Muhammad Ali and a great scene with Marty Feldman. The design of the disk from the fun FBI logo through to the music and applause behind the main menu maintain the light entertaining integrety of everything Flip's show stood for.  The quality of picture and sound are excellent considering the age of these shows.  Direct accessabilty to Guest stars is a convieniant feature I wish more DVDs released with classic shows, would employ.",982972800,13,487,4.926829268292683
1409214,4,B000059PQG,"I have not managed to see all of it, but what I have
seen, it seems great. I purchased this because
Johnny Mathis is on one of them, but the rest is also great.
I love thes old tv-shows
The quality is good, the delivery was ok, and I am pleased.
I believe that I bought it used, but it looks quite new.",1289779200,,302,3.8095238095238093
1409215,3,B000059PQG,"I use to watch this show with my family as a kid.  I don't believe a person who's not familiar with this show or similar shows from this era will enjoy this.

I enjoyed seeing Muhammad Ali and other celebrity guests from the 70's. My daughter has never seen a young Muhammad Ali and can't relate to how popular he was at this time. While younger people who've watched Martin Lawrence's Shanana character may not realize she is an updated version of Flip's Geraldine, they probably will enjoy watching Shanana more than Geraldine.",1285977600,4,529,4.67741935483871

1409217,5,B000059PQG,"I really enjoyed this DVD. My only regret is, that Flip only made 3 DVDs.",1265155200,,73,3.933333333333333
1409218,2,B000059PQG,I  love Flip Wilson but this dvd was a bit dissapointing. He played Geraldine but where is Rev. Leroy?,1172880000,3,102,4.368421052631579
1409219,1,B000059PQG,I remember this show as being very funny and risque humor. Viewing it today and it looks dull and stilted. Nothing about the humor seems funny in today's light. I ended up donating this to an old folks home...,1168473600,5,209,4.384615384615385
1409220,5,B000059PQG,"I remember when Flip Wilson started his shows on TV; it's been over 30 years now and I was just a child, but, to me each Thursday night, it was a treat as well as a privilege(couldn't watch it unless I did homework and learned my multiplication tables)to watch; but, now, I find that folks forgot what a great show that was all those years ago; To get this DVD is just a trip to remember all the great shows  now that he is gone and to keep the memory alive; See, Flip had a heck of characters on that show; but I feel the most famous one was Geraldine (""Watch it sucker""). Child, if that show didn't have Geraldine on that night, folks would be sorely disappointed. And when his show ended, he didn't put the shows in syndication; so the memories dimmed; I was soo glad that someone convinced him to put them shows back on; It was a true sin to just put them shows somewhere where no one could watch them; so I am real glad that these shows are available; My mom bought this one and plan to get the rest because we want to remember the man who kept us laughing on Thursday nights on Channel 4(NBC) in NYC;",1145750400,29,1106,4.144186046511628
1409221,5,B000059PQG,He should have ran longer than four years - I thought he was really great.  Another thing - he used to call all his characters Leroy; I had a chocolate point Siamese cat named Leroy when he was on in prime time.,1145577600,4,211,4.023809523809524
1409222,5,B000059PQG,Flip wilson was a Ground Breaking Brother.

Flip was versatile&His show was always interesting in the writing&overall Creativity.,1105142400,13,279,5.363636363636363
1409223,4,B000059PQG,"This is a great Video, however, the bonus episode ( with Marty Feldman, Howard Cosell and Sandy Duncan ) was out of sync.on the audio.  It isn't funny to hear the words and watch the mouths move after the fact.  Could this be just on my disk - haven't heard any other comments about this problem...Buy it, anyway-it's that good,totally.",1092268800,21,336,4.583333333333333

7934111,4,B000059PQG,The quality is great. I am reliving my childhood watching these shows again. Flip Wilson was truly one of the unsung comedians of his time. He didn't get enough credit for his work. He was such a wonderful talent and had so many wonderful acts on his show.,1354492800,,256,4.354166666666667
