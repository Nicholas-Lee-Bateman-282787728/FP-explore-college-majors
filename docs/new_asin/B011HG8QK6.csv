8724189,5,B011HG8QK6,"Ever wondered what it would have been like, had the CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON been uglier, and had an even hotter temper? Well, MONSTER OF PIEDRAS BLANCAS answers these questions, and more! Kept fed by a lighthouse keeper (John Harmon) on a beach, it misses a meal and goes berserk, causing mayhem. This monster rips heads right off their shoulders! Stars both Les Tremayne (WAR OF THE WORLDS, THE MONOLITH MONSTERS, ANGRY RED PLANET) as Dr. Jorgenson, and Don Sullivan (THE GIANT GILA MONSTER, TEENAGE ZOMBIES) as Fred! Co-stars the beautiful Jeanne Carmen as Fred's girlfriend, Lucy. The finale in the lighthouse is a classic, and probably inspired a young John Carpenter's similar sequence in THE FOG. Great stuff!...",1442620800,,725,5.05
