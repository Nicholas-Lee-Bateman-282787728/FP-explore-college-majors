3725290,4,B001O0QFRM,"""JCVD"" means, of course, Jean-Claude Van Damme, but if you are looking for an action film like ""Timecop"" or ""Hard Target,"" sorry, you don't find one here. In ""JCVD"" the Belgium-born action star (sort of) plays himself: a 48-year-old actor whose life is falling apart. In LA he fights for the custody of his daughter in court and he has lost his latest job to another action star with a ponytail. In fact ""JCVD"" is an off-beat comedy in which Jean-Claude Van Damme finds himself trapped in a most curious situation back in his hometown.

Belgian/Luxembourgian/French-made ""JCVD"" is largely set in Brussels. Jean-Claude Van Damme has come back to his hometown. Though he is obviously tired after the legal battle, the star is a very nice guy as the clerk (and his big fan) at the local rental video shop finds. Then Van Damme goes to a post office and something unusual happens. For the reasons explained later on, a gun fires and an officer is shot at from inside the post office. In ""Dog Day Afternoon""-like hostage situation that follows, the action star is now a robber.

What really happened will be told later in a ""Rashomon"" way. ""JCVD,"" it is certain, contains elements of thriller, but actually the film is more effective as a unique off-beat comedy in which Van Damme virtually plays himself. French-born director Mabrouk El Mechri (his second feature film) is clearly a fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme, but the director, and the star too, isn't afraid of telling and showing what most of us feel about Van Damme's career. At one scene Van Damme even talks directly to the screen. And the scene is pretty long.

Here Van Damme is no heroic figure and he is surprisingly credible as the star trying to get his life back together. The supporting actors are all effective, especially Zinedine Soualem as a short-tempered man and Karim Belkhadra, a guard who is also an avid Van Damme fan. The film has a gimmick narrative structure based on the star's own life, but the gimmick doesn't work without decent performances from the players, which ""JCVD"" has.

In spite of its clever concept, however, ""JCVD"" has flaws. I think the film needs a better way to wrap up the story, and some parts of the film look a bit repetitious. At times it seems the film doesn't know where it is going. Still ""JCVD"" is an enjoyable film featuring Van Damme as himself with his signature high kicks. But remember, here his high kicks are used in a totally different context.",1233360000,2,2455,4.689095127610209
3725291,5,B001O0QFRM,"I watched this movie at a screening at my school and was really impressed by it.  It was an interesting way to tell a story and is unlike anything I've seen Jean Claude Van Damme do. The main story is fictional, but Jean Claude basically plays himself.  Very well made film. Excellent acting. I would recommend this to just about anyone.",1233014400,3,337,4.508196721311475
3725292,4,B001O0QFRM,"likely to be the most underrated film of the year JCVD is a film that shows the very human side of Jean-Claude and that the man can really act. In JCVD Jean-Claude is a down on his luck B movie actor that can not catch a break. He's in a custody battle for his daughter, his credit cards are maxed out and worst of all he keeps losing rolls to Steven Segal. In a desperate attempt to wire money to his lawyer, Jean-Claude rushes to the bank only to find it's being robbed by a couple of goons. A great misunderstanding ensues and the media thinks that Jean-Claude has finally snapped and has decided to pull a heist. JCVD is not an action film. A common misconception is that Jean-Claude goes into the bank and regulates. Not so. It's rather a character study on a star once respected but now brought low. The best part of the film is also the strangest. A distraught Jean-Claude is sitting in a chair then the platform he's on starts to rise up, Jean-Claude then goes into a mono log about how he was a scrawny kid from Brussels who believed in his dojo and honor but everything got away from him and those things that meant so much to him couldn't save him anymore. It's a very touching part of the film and you get the feeling that it's not his acting but rather an honest and heartfelt confession to us . JCVD is a superb film. After watching, you may realize that you're a Jean -Claude fan all over again..  '",1232064000,,1414,4.256505576208179
3725293,4,B001O0QFRM,"A film that finally allows Jean-Claude Van Damme to show his acting prowess. It turns out that the karate-film-star is actually quite good as a serious actor. The film is shot in sepia and brown hues to give it a documentary-like film and it manages to question what is real and what is part of the cinematographic alternate reality. The film is as much a satire as it is a statement about our perceptions of movie stars. There's a 6-minute, one-take monologue that breaks the fourth wall that's worth looking at as part of the movie as much as by itself - it's an intriguing sequence in its own right. The film is as witty as it is humorous at times and is action-packed without being overwhelmingly so (as just about every film of JCVD's career). This is a must-see for any Van Damme's fans.",1230076800,4,793,4.475862068965517
3725294,5,B001O0QFRM,"Now like many I too accept that Jean Claude Van Damme isn't the greatest actor in the world. He's an action hero after all and much like Steven Seagal, he's someone we wouldn't usually expect a 5 star acting performance from. He's just used to kicking people in the head and looking all attractive whilst doing so. Now he's older and currently a man who's career was absolutely dying a death, at least until this film was made and now he has the possibility to be back on form and revive his career as a more serious actor.

So what makes this film different from all the rest? I hear you ask. Well for one he's not playing some clichd character who you end up shouting ""kick his head off"" at. He's actually playing himself in a fictional setting and as strange as it sounds it actually allows him to display much more acting talent than you would have first thought.

So what's the film about? I hear you secondly ask. Well, JCVD's life isn't going too well and is constantly in battle to win movie roles but is constantly beaten by his rival Steven Seagal. His wife has divorced him and is in legal battles for the right to have access to his daughter. He also has quite a few tax and money troubles to boot, so to escape his troubles he decides to go home to his native Belgium only this isn't as peaceful as he'd hoped.

Upon his arrival in Belgium he goes into a Post Office, and after his fans tell a local policeman that the legendary Jean Claude Van Damme is home and in the local post office. Then out of nowhere a gunshot rings from the post office sending people into a panic and shocked that it turns out to be the movie star himself holding up the post office, or is it?

Well what entails is a film about hostage negotiation and a traumatic movie star life that is topped off with a difficult situation. It's not the typical JCVD film as it contains very little fighting karate style, but the film is made truly special with the defining monologue. Roughly half way through the film, JCVD is brought away from the story and the film in quite a strange style that allows him to deliver a monologue that gives the impression it comes straight from the heart. He talks about his life and career and how he wants to be remembered as a more serious actor. I got the impression that a lot of the monologue although in a scripted movie, was actually improvised or at least written by JCVD himself.

I would highly recommend this film to any JCVD and non-JCVD fan as it's truly his best work to date. This is seriously a possible breakthrough movie for him to bring his career back up to speed and rather than continuing to star in ""straight to DVD"" movies like this one, sadly, he may be given more movies that start in the cinema and give him a wider appeal as the man is still a name that captures peoples interests.

Get it, you won't be disappointed.",1229644800,,2861,4.338317757009346

3725330,5,B001O0QFRM,"This is not the first film where JCVD shows his acting talent.  It is, however, a departure from his Martial arts roots.  The story is based on the person of JCVD.  The thing is that it is not based in reality.  The story opens with him doing a scene.  Complete he complains to the director that he is too old to do things the way he just did them.  This sets the stage for a story about an aging actor that has lost his place in the spotlight.  We then discover that he is going thru a custody fight.  With disappointment at every turn.  JCVD returns to Belgium in hopes of reigniting his career.  On his way to his parent house in Belgium, he stops to pick up a wire transfer from the states as he is having cash flow problems.  The thing is that he walks in on a robbery.  The rest is for you to discover.

I do want to share with you some observations.  The acting by all is on point for the genre.  The direction is excellent, the cinema photography needs the direction of the director but it feels like two different people are at the wheel.  The post-processing, for lack of a better word, sucks.  The writing is obviously absent.  We are told that 30% is adlib.  it shows.  In spite of the failures, the movie is enjoyable.  So sit back, clear your mind and take in the ambiance of a downtown in Belgium and a stand-out performance from Jean-Claude Van Damme.",1516406400,,1367,4.2412451361867705

3725332,5,B001O0QFRM,"This is NOT an action movie, which is what all viewers would expect from JCVD. Instead, it's more of an introspective art film that weaves fine threads of reality into a glamourless fictional tapestry. Most action movies, by comparison, are designed to manipulate our feelings to the point where violence not only seems perfectly justified, but it's also deeply desired. This film has a completely goal in mind. (You'll have to watch the film and decide for yourself what the goal is. I'm not giving it away.) Enjoy this unusual film with an open mind, and don't forget to laugh. There's some devilishly subtle humor infused in the details.",1516320000,,640,4.8807339449541285

And the writer/director was clearly tapped into the complexities of the whole hometown boy does good tension that exists when someone is trying to rebuild their lives in the very place they chose to leave.

3725340,5,B001O0QFRM,"Jean-Claude Van Damme was my idol as a child, no hyperbole at all. My father took me to see Street Fighter three times at theaters (sorry, dad), I had my own little dojo in our basement, and I'd practice his moves almost every day, aspiring to be like him. No, he's not a terribly good actor if you look at his body of work. This is not news to anyone. However, if you take his films for what they are and you like martial arts, it should be a match made in heaven.

As for the film JCVD, it's definitely one of his best. Not so much for the action, but Van Damme's superb acting. No, I'm not kidding. In particular, he gives a hearfelt, 100 percent authentic monologue reflecting on his own life and the mistakes hes made. It was beautifully done. I'll save you the plot details, you can look those up yourself. Just know that if you're a fan and you haven't seen this, do so immediately.",1513296000,,889,4.229411764705882

3725344,3,B001O0QFRM,"Van Damme is great, but this story, as another reviewer put it, is depressing, and somewhat confusing. Without giving anything away, the end just doesn't follow logic, and if there was some deeper message, I missed it.

It was great seeing Van Damme in a movie again, but not like this. He could have aged gracefully and taken roles that fit, like, maybe a police detective, or something where his action skills would come into play, but wouldn't be the central focus of his character.",1512086400,,485,4.705882352941177

3725352,2,B001O0QFRM,"Artfully done film about Van Damme in some kind of semi-autobiographical story about his family problems and entrapment in a bank robbery. Too heavy-handed and very conspicuous effort to make some kind of mea culpa about his failing career or a foray into real drama. The film portrays this karate superhero as a vulnerable human being. The scenario, however, doesn't add up. He is neither a hero nor a complete waste of human life. Very strange choice. As many famous actors at the end of their careers, they play characters that they made famous, instead of playing a character, such as DeNiro in Meet the Parents. Here we have JCVD playing himself as a fictional character. Just didn't work for me. I think the karate superhero genre has been usurped by the cartoon super hero genre. Maybe imagination is more important now, but it moves us away from real-life accomplishments, such as Bruce Lee, VD, Seagal, Norris have shown us is possible in the real world of martial arts.",1509494400,,979,4.798816568047338

Very imaginative concept and not overdone. This film makes you think how much JCVD was involved in the script, ect, because it has personal parts to it.

Very interesting film. Van Damme has dealt with his fair share of problems (in the 90s he says he spent $10,000 a day on cocaine). While Van Damme himself is hopefully better off in this film than he is in real life it still paints a portrait of an actor who made money on a few films and then went direct to video.

3725376,2,B001O0QFRM,"JCVD is a faux behind-the-scenes look at an older action-hero dealing with on set problems as well as personal life traumas (his wife divorces him and wins custody of their daughter). This isn't typical fare for Jean-Claude fans as he does less karate-oriented action and lot of REAL ACTING. BUT, do U want to see JCVD pulling a Meryl Streep. His monologues in the film really did deep and his scarred skin and wrinkles certainly lend weight to his performance, but do U want this man to kick-ass or make U think about life in the world of B-movie action filmmaking. To be a ""brand"" that has aged out of the genre and now is in constant physical danger because everyone expects him to be the same old JCVD. If don't mind being made sad, then this might be worth a watch but some of it is poorly conceived, like a scene where an old lady and a couple of men see JCVD on the street and then comment on his career after the runs an errand. Overall, this movie seems to be an epilogue to wrap a career as one of the most endurable action heroes of the modern B-action movie era. Maybe he'll try doing Broadway next, in any case, this kind of self-examination is more painful to watch than his normal fight scenes. Worth a watch for die-hard fans and people wanting to follow in his footsteps.

If I were to tell you that this is a fantastic dramatic comedy and not some self promotion, since his name IS the title, you provably brush me off along with my opinion. This, however, is good movie, it's a simple movie and it deserved better. Van Damme does a fantastic job as an actor with the worst of luck just trying to get by in a bad situation. Honestly, after watching this I think his biggest issue was his accent and a few poor choices in roles.

I do have one complain and that is the Blu-Ray cover. This isn't an action movie, except for Van Damme nothing in that cover is true, there are no buildings, no exploding cars and no helicopters.

At first the movie starts out really interesting by showing the reality of what happens when Van Damme is not in his prime anymore and Hollywood is done with him. I appreciate the realistic approach to show after your peak of fame, it's not all glitz and glam.

The movie went downhill for me after the burglars made it seem like Van Damme was the one holding the hostages. The middle and majority of the film became centered on this random burglary. By then he lost the case for custody of his daughter and then he goes to prison in the end.

3725393,5,B001O0QFRM,"Damme original, Damme well directed and Van Damme at his ultimate Damme best.

Most of JCVD's films deliver with high scores just as great action films and never disappoint.

But this film is something totally different and totally unexpected and thus a rare treat.
I always had the strong suspicion whilst watching Jean-Claude's action films that there was a lot more to this man than we were allowed to see as he did his thing against ""the Evil Doers"".  I knew that behind all the kicks and more kicks lurked a very sensitive and highly evolved human being who possessed a rare degree of human smarts and real wisdom and a really high degree of caring and empathy for his fellow human beings.

If you are satisfied to just see pure and well done action films by J-C there are plenty of great ones to choose from.
But if your taste is attracted to dramatic action films that also reflect the potential intellectual capabilities and gradual growth of human beings, then this film is a MUST WATCH movie.  And even if you knew nothing about this mega talented actor and had never heard of him before or seen a single movie in which he had starred.

The originality of the screenplay and how the movie opens and is then constructed is truly amazing and in a few ways reminds me of that Mega Blockbuster from years ago:  PULP FICTION in the way the action and various scenes do not always run in a straight line but sometimes  weave in and out of one another during the ongoing time sequences as the story evolves.

There are many aspects of this great film that reflect simply incredible originality in the way one is immersed in straight action sequences which then magically morph into almost documentary style interviews of J-C which really tear at one's Heart and cause one to meet a Jean-Claude Van Damme we never knew before in all these years.

There are action movies that chiefly deliver action ""candy"" for the eyes.  And that is fine.
But in ""JCVD"" we also receive a big dose of intellectual stimulation for the mind.

If I could meet and interview, or just get to spend quality time, with any actor in the world today, it would be Jean-Claude Van Damme.

This film breaks new ground in every way and on all levels.
It is that DAMME good.  See it immediately at your very earliest opportunity.

You will doubtless wish to see it again and then again.

3725401,4,B001O0QFRM,"Jean-Claude Van Damme is not known for being a prolific actor. He is known for kicking the heads of many opponents in various creative ways and other martial arts mayhem. He is not known for his acting skills, although a few of his films did show he started building the chops for it. In many ways JCVD is the antithesis of the Van Damme movie in that it isn't an action or adventure film in the slightest. It is a drama. Sometimes a humorous and quirky drama, sometimes a morose and emotional drama. The best thing is Van Damme pulls it off splendidly. It doesn't hurt that the film has a solid script and directing style that draw you into this oddly unreal, yet real story about Jean-Claude Van Damme.

JCVD is about Jean-Claude. A down and out action star who is going through a messy child custody battle. He returns to his home town of Brussels for a sabbatical and gets involved in something dangerous. I won't say anything more from there, because doing so would spoil a bit of the charm and magic of how this film moves the story forward. The movie starts with Jean-Claude doing an extended action sequence for a movie (about the only action of any significant level on the film), which isn't a bad intro. From there you get to see a pretty somber life with a custody hearing and other bad news. Then the movie switches into different modes, depending on one's point of view. First you get an outsider's view of something going down involving Jean-Claude, then you get JC's point of view. It's a really cool cinematic element that is pulled off quite well, and that's not the only thing done. There is a monologue that breaks the cinematic fourth wall, a sort of ""alternate"" take on a scene, and a few other little tricks that help make the film at that more interesting.

It's not just how the film is shot and edited. The camera filtering adds a good deal of grain and a slight color tint that gives the movie a gritty look and feel. A good chunk of the dialog, I think 30%, was improvised. This gave the movie a more organic and even documentary feel. I am guessing some of those unscripted scenes are spots like where Jean-Claude is talking to a cab driver or when some shop owners asked for autographs and photos. This combination of elements make the movie very fascinating to watch.

Like I said before Jean-Claude Van Damme's martial arts aren't so strong in this movie, but he hits it out of the park acting-wise. I don't know if it's because a lot of the content hits close to home for him, or if he's just gotten better with age. Of course his serious and stoic look dominates many of the scenes, but it also works. More importantly are those moments when just looking serious isn't enough. He puts the kind of expression you would expect on a documentary. It's raw and believable, even in the scenes that are undoubtedly fictional in every way. Then there is this monologue he does almost out of the blue and outside of the film's realm. It's hard not to feel for the guy when he spills so much on that scene. It's almost like the entire movie was made just so Jean-Claude Van Damme can have this very personal talk with the film audience.

So the movie itself is great, but this U.S. release leave a bit to be desired. First off the U.S. Blu-Ray disc is a single layer 25 GB disc as opposed to the U.K. BD release at 50 GB. I haven't really noticed any visual quality differences between the two, but the U.S. disc has an odd way to deal with languages. Instead of a languages menu there is actually four separate versions of the film if you believe the menu. The original theatrical release, English version, French version and Spanish version. JCVD was filmed in French with English subtitles. The French version is the same, only the English subtitles are taken out and French subtitles put in for the English speaking scenes. The English version is a badly dubbed version where the dialog is stale and flat. The Spanish version is the Theatrical version only with Spanish subtitles. Really you have just one version of JCVD with different language options presented in a weird way.

Audio also isn't quite as good as the U.K. release as it is presented in Digital 5.1 instead of Dolby TrueHD 5.1. This may not really make much of a difference for most home entertainment situations, but if you have a dynamic audio system and are big on wanting that full low end you will be getting a less than perfect audio experience. All of this is forgivable as a clunky menu and great, but not excellent audio aren't all that bad. However the extras on the U.S. seriously pale in comparison to the U.K. Blu-Ray, which has two excellent featurettes (""A Day with JCVD"" and ""Making-of JCVD""). Instead you just get five minutes of deleted scenes, which are kind of cool, but really pale in comparison to these two documentaries you are missing out on.

JCVD is a treat for fans of the action hero, but this disc doesn't give you the most bang for your buck. If you can find the Revolver Entertainment U.K. import and get all the benefits of better audio, better menu interface and two awesome documentaries. It's also region free so you don't have to worry about compatibility issues.",1429574400,,5195,4.5212765957446805

3725407,3,B001O0QFRM,"JCVD is a clever bit of meta-fiction that has Jean-Claude Van Damme playing a version of himself in the real world.  Obviously a low-budget affair, there is a certain charm in watching the man himself turn your expectations around, and ultimately turn inward.  The film gets a little artsy at one point with JCVD addressing the audience in a confessional monologue that stood out in my opinion, as a singular moment that made the film worth watching, even if you didn't enjoy the rest of it.  The film is not action heavy, but more of a Belgian version of ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" with JCVD caught up in the middle of it all.  In an interesting and ironic way, the film does not take itself seriously, and in that -  the filmmakers and JCVD himself have made it a more effective commentary on what it means to be a celebrity, especially one whose star power is past the expiration date.  Well played, JCVD.",1419120000,,902,4.537037037037037
3725408,3,B001O0QFRM,"It's a bank robbery film with a subplot about how miserable Jean-Claude Van Damme is.  The acting he does in the film is certainly superior to anything else he has ever done, and there is a cathartic moment towards the latter portion where he opens up and talks directly to the camera about his life (the ""you win, and I lose"" speech) which is excellent.

It certainly felt revelatory seeing Van Damme in this kind of role, and he handles it nicely.  On the other hand, the overall impact of the movie is underwhelming.  Take away a few moments of brutal honesty from Van Damme, and there isn't much here.  It's also worth noting that unless you are a fan of his and take the trajectory of his life and career seriously, some of the impact of the film might lost on you; which is ironic, because this is exactly the sort of film the average Van Damme film is unlikely to watch.",1418774400,,877,4.355828220858895

3725420,5,B001O0QFRM,"Fans of kung-fu flicks and ""bad movies"" rejoice! JCVD makes a movie about JCVD, called ""JCVD"". It's a legitimately good movie. Not ""good"" like passable, but actually good. Easily his best film to date. And I don't mean ""best"" as in my favorite Van Damme film is ""The Quest"", I mean good as in this should have won people over at Cannes.

The opening: There's explosions everywhere, JCVD is spin-kicking muscle-headed soldiers into oblivion. Bodies pile up left and right, and then Jean-Claude proceeds to... walk off the set and discuss the scene with the director? The fourth wall will be broken.

The plot: I'd have to say the plot is a true metaphor such that revealing anything is a semi-spoiler. Trying not to ruin the fun too much, the whole point of the film is that JCVD believes he has been misunderstood- as an actor and as a person- so when the movie reveals that a weary-sounding JCVD is robbing a post office, you sense there's more to the story. So much more.

So why should you watch it? JCVD (and company) are telling a very direct and personal story to the audience using film as a medium- this is high art. The ""climax"" of the movie is really when JCVD is raised above the set to deliver an impassioned monologue directly to the camera, with the stage lights and equipment clearly visible behind him. Eyes full of tears, apologizing for his mistakes but full of hope and pride over his accomplishments, he pours his soul out to the world openly and without reservation. Then, at the end, he is lowered back into the scene and rolls right back into the script without breaking the one-shot. This must be seen.

Fans of JCVD and kung-fu movies in general will get lots of what they want, from over-the-top action scenes to quips about Steven Seagal. People who've stared and wondered all this time at who this guy is or why he keeps making bad movies, will get the explanation they've been looking for (and it's not a clearcut as they expect). Movie fans in general, this is just a well-made movie. Highly recommended, to anyone old enough to watch an action movie and who doesn't mind French with subtitles.

Also of note, do watch the bonus deleted scenes. There's just a few cuts there, but they demonstrate that a good portion of the movie was done in the long single-shots that open the film and including much ad-libbing from JCVD. These elements add a lot of difficulty to an action movie (and that's not just a jab at Van Damme). To think that the movie was shot in this style, with such a personal and intricate plot, really goes to show the heart that went into this film. An all-time classic, JCVD should be a staple of fight films and arthouse together. This movie says more about the man, than any biopic ever will.",1399766400,8,2744,4.5465587044534415

few movies pull it off well enough so it doesn't leave you a little confused.  This wasn't an exception to that either..

3725430,2,B001O0QFRM,"This a very good concept, which seems to be a spoof of the life of an aging action film star. JCVD plays himself in his later years. You can see he has trouble getting new roles, has child custody issues, and other random things an ex-star may face.
  I was disappointed that the movie tried to be funny, but fails in this regard mostly because of the script. There are some good lines and scenarios, such as when he finds out that Seagal won a role by cutting off his ponytail. Another was when his daughter talks about how her friends make fun of her about her dad's roles.
  However I thought that there was too much violence and seriousness about some of the characters. This took away from many of the lighter sides of the movie. I am not sure what the director intended, but it is too serious for a spoof and is not really an action-type of drama either.
  I would have loved to see this movie as a pure light-hearted spoof without the violence. It had potential but somehow the plot became lost. I was waiting for the movie to end after about halfway through it.",1379376000,,1069,4.32

3725436,3,B001O0QFRM,"I've heard next to nothing about this movie except for the fact that van Damme apparently acted very well in this movie. So I checked it out and I have to say that the movie is certainly interesting, and I don't mean that in a bad way.

On the same token, it's not exactly a movie I liked or loved, but it wasn't bad or terrible either! It was just interesting, and unfortunately I think that drifts the movie into ""meh"" territory which is sad. The movie had an interesting way of progressing the plot for you, almost 3 different POV's documenting when JCVD goes into the post office.

Really, there's not much plot in this movie. It's mainly about JCVD kind of... venting, which is the best way I could describe it. It talks about his custody battle issues with his kid, going back to Belgium in order to rediscover himself, and I'm not sure... but I think there were money issues hinted at but it didn't make sense. He made it seem like he had money and that he was having trouble with his bank, yet he was having trouble paying his lawyer, so that didn't make any sense to me.

Anyway, the main highlight of this movie is the monologue JCVD gives to the audience. It was delivered with such authenticity that you couldn't tell whether he was acting or if it was real. Unfortunately, the monologue alone isn't enough to recommend this movie, a whole lot of nothing happens. If anything, I'd recommend watching the speech on youtube but maybe skipping the movie altogether unless you're a huge JCVD fan.",1374451200,,1504,4.481751824817518
3725437,5,B001O0QFRM,"I caught this movie on Showtime on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I got sucked into it immediately. Now, I am not a Van Damme fan by any means.

But as many have commented here, this movie is not about Van Damme, the actor playing cliched roles; rather, this is Van Damme playing himself. Think of this movie like a cross between ""Lock, Stock, and 2 Smoking Barrels"" and ""Pulp Fiction"".

This movie really pulls at the deeper part of you. For example: Van Damme has this monologue/ aside during the bank heist- where he is held hostage- where he questions the whole process, life, his decisions, fame, fortune, and the payback for those things. It's akin to a Shakespearean Hamlet ""to be, or not to be..."" moment. Pivotal. Inciteful.

What I never liked about Van Damme movies were that they were always about Van Damme. As in, he was playing some 2nd- rate role as a stereotypical hero who always came through in the end. Blah. The movie centered on Van Damme kicking things. This is much more. Van Damme as human, Van Damme as reflective. Van Damme as truthful.

If you want kicks and explosions, pass on this one.

However, if you really love quality acting, directing, and storytelling and are looking for something to surprise you from a film industry that produces more formulaic duds than heavy-hitters as of late, then this will NOT disappoint!",1371945600,3,1346,4.662447257383966

3725439,4,B001O0QFRM,"There are a few 1 star reviews lurking about for this film. Please be aware that the vast majority of them revolve around the fact that JCVD is 'not in English'. That is to say that the people delivering those reviews A: Can't read fast enough to deal with subtitles, B: Can't read at all or they'd know it was a foreign film before they started watching and C: Don't know what language this film is actually in (it's french) and thusly use the phrase 'not in English' to describe it.

I give JCVD 4/5 on Amazon because it's certainly worth the rental to see Van Damme bust out some actual acting chops. The direction was solid, the dialogue was well written in both languages (yes, it has some english in it) and the film was entertaining. My IMDB score put it at a 7/10 which is .2 below it's current average on that site.

Bottom line, don't come looking for Bloodsport and you won't be disappointed. This is a self deprecating comedic drama and it's an above average one at that.",1362355200,,983,4.395604395604396
3725440,4,B001O0QFRM,"This is a different type of movie.  It is not just a movie starring Jean-Claude Van Damme; it is about Jean-Claude Van Damme, with an interesting mixture of fact and fiction.  JCVD, after a series of disappointing B-movies and the loss of a custody case with his daughter, returns to Belgium, where he is regarded as a hero.  Only he finds himself part of a bank robbery.  Using his wits, acting experience and martial arts abilities, he is pushed to the limit as he seeks to survive this harrowing experience--trying to save his own life and that of his fellow captives as well.

The movie offers a glimpse into the darker side of Hollywood fame.  There is little glitz and glamour here as we see the aging star, both broke and broken.  If anyone ever thought that he was simply a pretty boy with some cool martial arts skills, they are wrong.  Van Damme demonstrates in this movie that he can act in dramatic parts as well.  As much as I like Bloodsport, this is the best movie he has ever made.

The blu-ray transfer is adequate, but not stellar.  The entire movie is cast in a sepia tint that gives it an aged, washed-out look.  The quality is not much different than an upconverted DVD.  So if you already own the DVD and are considering an upgrade to blu-ray, you are probably fine staying with the DVD.

Parental Advisory: This movie features an extended fighting sequence (which turns out to be a scene being filmed in a movie).  A man is shot in one scene, and there are other scenes where hostages are under duress.  The movie contains some profanity, including the F-word (sometimes in French).  There is discussion involving past drug addiction.  In one scene that takes place in a video store, apparently the covers of some racy films are visible (I did not notice this, but my wife did).  The movie is rated-R, but with some minor changes it could have been PG-13.  Most parents would probably be fine with their teenagers seeing it, but not their smaller children.

In summary, I recommend this movie.  It is a different type of role for JCVD, and that is a good thing.  It will be interesting to see where he goes from here.  Hopefully, not just more movies like The Expdendables 2.",1360454400,3,2198,4.534351145038168

The story line is obviously just that, a story, but I believe the story behind the story might be real. Its a movie about a real person struggling through life, drugs, divorce, child custody etc. balanced with the fame of a hollywood star. I give JC big two thumbs up for making this movie and showing the world he is just a person, and a pretty good actor too.

Well the real reason was that it had no subtitles and just looking at the film to try and understand was not making any sense. I was a big JCVD fan back in my younger days when action movies with basic story lines were all you wanted to see. Then these movies started to become ""b"" rated movies and all the famous action heros/stars started to get less (in size and quantity...lol).
  I was very happy when JCVD decided to join the Expendables cast and he was very convincing as the ""bad guy"".So good I decided to check on so older films I did not see. Out came this great review for a movie I never gave a second look at. I clicked buy it now on AMAZON (free advertising) and got it in a short time.
  So I got the bluray for the english version and BOOM! What a movie! I could not believe how entertained I was now that I understood the dialogue.

3725447,5,B001O0QFRM,"Damme!  Who knew that Jean Claude can really act?

This movie is trippy.  I enjoyed it so much that I told many people about it and lent it out to whomever would bite and, thusly, I have lost this gem.  But my friends who also watched it agreed that the movie was a surprise, and a headscratcher as it left you off-balance and kind of wondering what was exactly what.  This piece of fiction, if you want to call it that, feels at once like a ""found footage"" film largely unfolding in real time for the most part.  However, if you have a cursory idea of Jean Claude Van Damme and his history, you'll begin to wonder if it is part documentary with the titularly initialed star exposing his all-to-real and painful life onscreen.  Lastly, you'll be scratching your head as you wonder if this movie is really a movie or publicity stunt or what as it has elements of light action but is not particularly close to a normal Jean Claude action flick.  I'm serious about all of this!  Like I said, this movie is trippy.  For those who want to know more, warning, spoilers ahead:

The movie starts off like a typical low-budget straight-to-video Jean Claude turd.  He is wading through some war conflict, kicking the bad guy's patooties, and it looks particularly bad.  The stunt men miss their marks, Damme himself is slow and not throwing his punches or kicks in a powerful way, and the special effect technicians are off on their timing while blowing stuff up.  Damme bears the brunt of the director's wrath and it is revealed that we are watching the real man himself get chewed out on the set of the movie that he's starring in by his director.  It's not a happy time for him and he's having real trouble keeping up with what is required of him.  The film then shifts to showing Damme driving through the countryside having a variety of phone calls and arguments with family and business partners and exposing to us, the audience, that he is in dire straits due to how he has (mis)conducted his life and his affairs.  Drug use, financial mismanagement, affairs, he doesn't spare us from his real life misadventures nor does he hide how they have come close to ruining him.  He is trying to get someone to give him some coin as he needs it pronto in order to be able to do something involving his kids (I forget what exactly) and he goes to a bank.  Well, guess what?  While he's there a bank robbery occurs and he's one of the hostages.  The robbers recognize him but still don't spare him; they're careful with him because they've seen his movies and know what he's capable of.  In the ensuing squalor Damme has a couple of ""out of body"" moments where he speaks directly to the camera and waxes philosophical about his real life and the predicament that he is in.  He's just another regular joe amongst the rest of the hostages and he gets beat up a bit.  He doesn't rush in, play hero, and save the day against all odds.  Mind you, he becomes the hero and does save the day at the end of the film (by utilizing a move he's trained in and uses in all of his films) but he leaves the bank the same beleaguered man that had entered that bank.  There is no resolution over than a tacit admission that his schlocky film career was good for something.

This is, simply put, an utterly fascinating movie.  But people who aren't fans of Damme won't watch it and fans will watch it and go, ""What the hell?""  It's unusual in that it alienates both of its target audiences.  And that's truly unfortunate as so many people won't get to see this odd and wonderful movie; it is not ""one of his best"" movies, it is his best movie.  And that's from someone who loves ""Bloodsport"".",1345766400,,3661,4.411326378539493

3725449,1,B001O0QFRM,This movie is just as bad as any other movie that JCVD has made in the past 15 years.  It was a big waste of money and time...,1310774400,2,126,3.5
3725450,4,B001O0QFRM,"I was in video distribution when Van Damme was releasing a lot of movies so I got to see my fair share of them. Overall I enjoyed them. He had a good screen presence and ended up with better scripts and slightly larger budgets than some of the others in that neck of the woods. At the end of the day however he was considered an action star with little hope of aspiring to anything more. And action stars usually have a limited shelf life. For him this was compounded by bad press involving drugs.

So here he is in a movie that requires him to actually act with something other than his biceps and he really steps up to the plate.

Here's the scoop. In this movie he plays himself. He's approaching over-the-hill-dom. He's fighting for rolls. His marriage is shot. He's fighting for custody of his daughter and he's having cash flow issues. He heads into a Belgium post office to retrieve a wire transfer of some cash and finds himself in the middle of a robbery.

Van Damme wears his years on his face. He has his share of wrinkles and he looks beleaguered. Now he's in a situation where the officials think he's one of the perps and a legion of fans gathered around the post office don't care. He has to get out of this with as much of himself in tact as possible and maybe use his experience and popularity to make certain the situation doesn't degrade past the point of no return.

Van Damme does better than I could have possibly imagined. He has one scene in particular where he waxes introspectively and does an astounding job. This is all done in one take. So either he really has honed his acting skills or he's truly speaking from the heart. Or possibly both. I don't know how close all of this is to real life but it's spooky to not know what is true and what isn't. The bad guys do a good job. One in particular is the kind of guy you hope to never meet in real life. He's ugly down to his bones. There is also some humor thrown in which helps to keep things from getting too overwrought.

I also liked the structure. The viewer sees several scenes a couple of times but from different perspectives. It might not be a new technique but it works well here. The producers/director don't set up the story and try slog through it to the end. The cutting of time and perspective helped keep me involved. I also like that things don't all work out in the end. They aren't bad for Van Damme but they aren't perfect. About the only thing I didn't care for was the color palette. It was almost a sepia with much of the color washed out.

This is a good movie and I hope it helps Van Damme reach the next stage in his career. If you want to see an old dog learn a new trick, this is a good place to be.",1309132800,,2705,4.212355212355212

3725452,5,B001O0QFRM,"I was a huge fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme's in the eighties and early nineties.  After paying to see The Quest and Street Fighter, I stopped paying theater prices to see Jean-Claude Van Damme movies.  I actually lost track of the guy until I heard about this movie, JCVD, in 2010.  I have no idea why I hadn't heard about the movie when it came out in 2008, but I knew I had to buy it.  After buying, watching, and thoroughly enjoying JCVD, I proceeded to purchase DVDs of many of his other movies that escaped my notice over the years...Maximum Risk, Replicant, Wake of Death, Until Death, Universal Soldier (Yes, I totally missed this one.  How did I own TimeCop and Hard Target, but never recall hearing about Universal Soldier?)  Jean-Claude is accused of being a non-actor over and over again.  I just don't get it.  He is believable in the roles that he plays.  He imparts entertainment (most of the time) via his movies/characters.  He was especially good in Maximum Risk, Wake of Death and Until Death.  Why is this guy never given his due?  I am anxiously awaiting his return to the theater.  I will pay theater prices to see this guy on the big screen again.  Supposedly, he has two movies coming out this year (2010 and I hope not just straight to DVD), and a British reality show is in the works to track his progress as he prepares himself physically for a real-life fight in Las Vegas in March 2011.  I am pulling for him to make a big comeback...even though he's never been gone.  He's continued to make movies over the years, with only one year (I believe it was 2000) where he didn't make one.  It's about time he's given the credit he's earned.  JCVD was not the first movie that he's proven to be a good actor.  Maybe it's just the first one that many people outside of his fan base chose to see.",1280880000,,1815,4.396396396396397

The bulk of the acting is surprisingly good.  The only reason that I don't give the movie a higher rating is because the production values, editing and some of the supporting performances aren't up to JC's bar in this case.",1277942400,,493,4.395604395604396

3725455,5,B001O0QFRM,"If any of you have followed my recent activity in reviews you know one of my latest was a Jean Claude Van Damme two pack with Replicant and,what I thought was one of Van Dammes best efforts,Legionnaire. In that I intimated there was more to this star than just his action movie work and I said the movie showed what he was capable of. I also stated that it was kind of a coming out for me to admit I was a JCVD fan at all,but there it is. So what has this to do with this movie,JVCD? Well soon after I posted that review one of my friends who is definitely NOT a JCVD fan begrudging suggested I watch JVCD.""Why,you don't like him?"",I queried.""Just watch it,you'll see"",he replied. So I did...and wow! This is the one,folks. This movie,JCVD(released June/08),illustrates the point I tried to make in that recent review. THIS is what Van Damme was/is capable of doing and it is in short.....spectacular.
The story takes us inside and outside the movie business throughout its' 97 minute duration. It starts off with Van Damme systematically fighting his way through a bevy of bad guys and situations. There are clues along the way but in a short time a director yells ""cut"" and we are on a movie set with Van Damme trying to tell a snobbish oriental producer with plenty of attitude,c/w translator,that he thought he could have done it better. But his pleas fall on deaf ears,as Van Damme can only shake his head in disgust. The scene then switches to him talking to his producer about lining up a new production. His agent suggests one title with a totally inane name,but he's already shot it. He suggests another equally ridiculous title but it's a sequel-a number 2. Further along in their discussion is a very telling verbal exchange about how movies are financed and how actors are used  while others get rich off of their name.""Haven't I always taken care of you?"",his agent asks? First it's a pig headed director now it's a leach of an agent. We then find Van Damme in court trying unsuccessfully to get custody of his daughter. The opposing lawyer is citing a list of his movies which ""even I wouldn't watch"",as a prosecution tactic. It works;Van Damme loses again.
On the way to the airport heading back to Belgium,Van Damme gets a call from his attorney saying his cheque bounced and he needs payment right away. Once back home he stops at a post office to get some money. When he steps out of his cab two fans accost him for a picture which he obligingly poses for,then he walks across the street. A short time later alarm bells go off and shots are heard from the post office. A policeman who happened to arrive after he went inside goes over to the post office only to be waved away by Van Damme. He tries to enter but gets shot. Van Damme has apparently tried to rob the post office and has taken hostages.
The truth is another matter. As the movie smartly unfolds the answers before us through visual hints and circumstance-connected replays,we find out after Van Damme entered the post office he became a hostage himself. Three men had already entered,had taken hostages and had been attempting to steal from the post office when,to their bad luck,Van Damme entered the picture. They force Van Damme to be their ""connection"" to the police and thus perpetuate the lie that HE is the hostage taker and not them. Van Damme is beaten and even shot throughout the ordeal showing alot of vulnerability. At one point with a television in the background,the chair Van Damme is sitting in suddenly lifts upward to reveal a partial set and /lighting in the background. He now comes out of the scene,smashing the fourth wall betwixt actor and audience,and delivers a very touching soliloquy. Rehearsed or not(it appears ad-libbed)it is totally riveting. He starts with ""There you are,you and me"",looking very disheveled,not like a ""movie star"" and not like the 47 years old he was at the time.""You made my dreams come true-I promised you something in return and(tearing)I haven't delivered yet. You win,I lose"".He talks about the hurdles he has had to face in his career,his younger years in karate and the ""dojo"" principal that he came to respect,live by and believe in. But naively he found others in the business didn't have the same principals and he got caught up in the whole movie world thing with all its' ups and downs. He goes on to speak of his cocaine addiction and the media's very shallow reporting of his unfortunate circumstances,no matter how self inflicted they may have been. He questions his career and success. His emotions over flow when he says he can't understand why people with so much better talent than he have not made it in the business. He asks what he has done with his life:""What have I done on this Earth?.......nothing"".Letting us know that he has to put the fourth wall back up soon he says he may die in the post office. But with a parting shot before he does he says""It's hard for me to judge people,but hard for them NOT to judge me. Yeah...something like that"",wiping tears from his face. And with that the fourth wall goes back up and the chair slowly lowers back into the room and the movie continues. In point of fact the fourth wall was actually breached twice. This time and when JCVD first entered the post office to get his funds. Frustrated,emotionally upset and drained he stops,looks around and says out loud that this must be candid camera,then pointing he says ""Camera....camera....camera"".One of them is the one we're looking at him through and he's being filmed with.
The hostage taking and negotiations between Van Damme(for the real robbers)and the police continue. Van Damme makes a connection with one of the robbers named Arthur,who at one point(in a funny scene)asks him to demonstrate a kick boxing move by kicking a cigarette out of the mouth of another hostage. Van Damme protests but relents,cleanly removing the cigarette with a quick leg lift. When Arthur tries it,he knocks the guy out! The entire crisis comes to a crumbling end when Arthur shoots and kills the crook-in-charge and then the police storm the post office. Arthur is killed as Van Damme pleads with him to not shoot. Then Van Damme is taken hostage by the remaining crook. The scene plays out two ways-the first as we might expect it to happen in a Van Damme movie,with a great scissor kick and down goes the bad guy,and the actual way,Van Damme is able to subtly elbow punch the crook in the gut and the police move in. But Van Damme is arrested and is convicted of extortion,with two years probation and a year of actual prison time!!The reason?:it seems a suggestion Van Damme made to the crooks during the siege to send $495,000 to his attorney instead of asking the cops for a movie-like million dollars,was actually done. Unreal? Yep,but this is the movies...or is it?
The movie ends with Van Damme's mother visiting him in prison. After a brief exchange she presents him with a surprise. After a few seconds his daughter is sitting on the other side of the glass with phone in hand and she says ""Hi"".Van Damme just stares in disbelief for a few telling seconds,then quickly picks up the phone and returns the ""Hi"".He lightly hits himself on the side of the head with the phone as brutal ""reality"" comes around again-cut to black.
This is Van Damme at his rawest and most vulnerable both personally and as an actor. It is full at gibes at the industry he has slaved in for many years and which has taken advantage of him and his colleagues for their own self interests and profit. There is quite the telling moments when Arthur and he sit discussing his career. Arthur tells him he was the one who brought famed Hong Kong director Johnny Woo to Hollywood and what thanks did he get?.Then when asked about a movie Arthur thought he had coming up Van Damme says that Steven Seagal got the part not him,because he(Seagal)offered to cut off his pony tail.""You're way better than him"",Arthur says emphatically.
Technically the film has been transferred well to DVD and it is filmed in a sepia toned style to give it a better impact and poignancy. You get the original French version and the English version with sub-titles. The theatrical trailer is here,as well as two deleted scenes. The second one is very telling and I highly recommend it be watched to get a further understanding of Van Damme's personal thoughts on life and his career. And oh yes watch for that funny animated credit opening,which is not the usual Gaumont film company opening. The usual is a little boy picking a daisy which floats and becomes the Gaumont logo. This time Van Damme enters the scene and when he asks the boy for the daisy he is rebuked and...drop kicks him!
The film is both a telling commentary on Hollywood and everything that goes with it and a scathing self-reality check for Van Damme himself. The ""real"" interposed within his ""natural"" environment of the ""unreal"".Unsettling at times and aimed straight for our guts from Van Damme's heart. Highly recommended!",1272153600,,8991,4.676136363636363

Jean-Claude Van Damme--international movie star.

Jean-Claude Van Damme--the Muscles from Brussels.

Jean-Claude Van Damme--loved by millions

Jean-Claude Van Damme--criminal?

It's a post office hostage situation and Van Damme is suspected to be the guy running the show. He talks to the cops, tells them what he wants, is alone inside with the hostages--he's got guilty written all over him.

Except not all is what it seems and Van Damme--hero to all--is having the worst day of his life. Not only did he lose custody of his daughter, he's broke, has no new movie on the horizon and now he's getting framed taking a post office with a built-in bank hostage.

I just finished watching this and I'm still soaking it in. I've seen most of Van Damme's movies and JCVD is nothing like any of them. This isn't an action movie despite it starting that way. This is a drama. Big time, and Van Damme proves here he is way more than just muscles, high kicks, and guns. This Van Damme is raw, brutally honest, caring and just downright human. No eight-foot-tall-and-bullet-proof karate guy here. This is the story about Van Damme the man (he goes by his own name in the movie), one with heart, potent emotion and a performance that should have been nominated for an Oscar. Seriously.

Van Damme's not listed in the movie's writing credits, but there's a point in the movie where he talks to the camera about life, Hollywood, the ups and downs and simply apologizes for the mistakes he's made in real life to those he knows and to those, like us, he doesn't. Just phenomenal.

My only little thing was the story seemed to move slowly in parts, but, hey, that could just be me.

And the ending . . . man, it was just perfect. I really liked how they presented it, especially the climatic scene between Van Damme and the bad guys. To go any other way would have completely ruined the movie, but this was handled nicely. Good on them.

The sepia coloring used throughout the film added a wonderful grittiness to it, enhancing the drama and its foreign and rustic atmosphere.

This is a Van Damme movie you've never seen before. This is a Van Damme you've never seen before.

You need to see this.

I can put the English track on but you get the annoying words and lips that don't match up.  I'm not sure, but I don't think Van Damme does his own english voice over.  No to little action in the movie.  The idea of the movie is really cool (thats why I bought it)  but very little fighting and a lot of BORING!",1271635200,2,474,3.875

3725459,4,B001O0QFRM,"What would Jean Claude Van Damme do if he really did find himself in a situation that calls for an action hero?  This film envisions JCVD as an aging action star, in the midst of a heated custody battle and losing all the good action roles to Steven Seagal. He finds himself stuck in the middle of a hostage crisis, and, unlike in the movies, he knows in this case his fists and feet won't save anybody.  In the thrilling opening sequence, a single take from a film within the film, after dispatching an entire military unit almost entirely unarmed, he asks the director why he always has to throw away his guns, and the response is that his character eschews guns for the sake of purity.  In real life, though, he knows he's helpless with a gun to his head.

Ironically, what the situation calls for is brain rather than the brawn he portrays in his classic martial arts pictures.  It's a surprisingly honest set up and performance, that acknowledges all of the cliches and jokes one might raise about the man and his movies, at the same time as it highlights the fact that he really is just a guy who dreamed big and worked hard and did something.  In a pivotal monologue, Van Damme wonders what it was he really accomplished and it feels utterly authentic.  A hometown hero in Brussels for ""making it"" in Hollywood, sure, but he knows his films are also something of a joke, and at least as depicted here his life is a mess.  For all the punishment he takes to make the fight scenes authentic, there's something that always feels fake about his action films; here, even though there's less actual fighting, he takes an emotional beating and it really feels genuine, even if most of it is in fact scripted.  There's still a quasi-documentary feel to it all.  Obviously recommended for fans of JCVD.  I never was (though I still recall the visceral thrill of watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kickboxer/dp/B0021FP3EA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kickboxer</a>&nbsp;-- I could laugh, but it was impressive and thrilling too).  Who wouldn't dig this?  It's a rare action film with good acting, and a very clever screenplay.",1264809600,,2170,4.896174863387978
3725460,4,B001O0QFRM,"In JCVD, Jean-Claude Van Damme, stretching himself artistically, plays a washed up actor named Jean-Claude Van Damme, whose history parallels the real man's life, and whose string of violent B-movie films are used as ammunition against him in his suit for custody of his children.  Beaten, broken, and bankrupt, he returns to his native Belgium to try and regroup and start over, only to step into the middle of a bank robbery in his hometown.

At this point, according to the movies of Van Damme's that I've seen before, I would expect him to mop up the place with the three less than competent gunmen, but JCVD hews closer to reality, and Jean-Claude does what any sane person would do when someone puts a gun to their head - he shuts up and does what he's told.  Through a mix-up, the police initially think that Van Damme is the bank robber, and the gunmen seize on that fact, forcing him to negotiate for them.

As the hostage situation drags on, director Mabrouk El Mechri breaks the 4th wall, and Van Damme speaks directly into the camera about his life, his success and failure, and intimates what it means for a regular joe to wear the shell of a celebrity.  I wouldn't ordinarily have expected JCVD to be different from any other Jean-Claude Van Damme movie, but this monologue was what made me curious about the film in the first place.  I'd heard of it, and heard it highly praised.  Over-praised, I think, now that I've seen it, as it was presented as a genuine and moving cri de coeur - but while the plight of broken and exhausted celebrities may be terrifically sad, I have a hard time empathizing.  Plus, not only was there the image of the sadder but wiser older man, but I caught a distinct impression that his regret over past actions might cause him far less heartburn if his star status hadn't dimmed as it has.

Maybe I'm being unfair, but it doesn't matter because JCVD doesn't depend on the frankness of Jean-Claude's confession to make it an interesting film.  Interesting - not great - though I enjoyed it for what it was.  I though it was a clever look at what makes a person a person, about the illusions we hold concerning other people and about ourselves, and a nice skewering of the film industry.

Unfortunately, if the film were viewed as Jean-Claude Van Damme's personal story, it could also be considered a celebrity peep-show, and a blueprint for actors who wish to recast themselves as genuine people via the fiction of film - and its success is likely to bring imitation.  As a convention, I think it would grow tiresome quickly.

Mr. Van Damme is also applauded for his acting in this film, which does seem above par, though I've always thought that his acting suffered mostly from his having to appear solely in English speaking movies.  That and how his movies generally went to such goofy lengths to explain his accent.  In JCVD, he carries his acting chores well, but after all, he is playing himself.  That certainly makes it easier to get in character.

This movie is likely to receive mixed results, as longtime fans of Mr. Van Damme aren't going to see the action movie they might have expected, and viewers who may appreciate the subtleties of JCVD may not realize that it ISN'T the action movie they expect.  I will say that, barring anything unfortunate, this movie should resurrect Mr. Van Damme's film career.  After the catalog of challenges that such a career brings, which he listed so effectively in his monologue, only he knows if it was worth it.",1264032000,6,3505,4.622580645161291
3725461,5,B001O0QFRM,"Rivetting movie, heart-felt story and happy to have bought it. I hope to see Van Damme do more of these types of movies and he deserves to receive great praises!",1259366400,,161,4.4
3725462,5,B001O0QFRM,"Ok actually i saw his acting improvement before this movie in a movie called ""From Hell"". The movie sucked, but his acting was superb. Well JCVD he takes it to a new level. I now fully see that his real acting talent is now finally blooming and you can expect Van Damme to be a serious star in the next decade or two. He still looks tough as nails and with his distinguished aging he looks even meaner. Hell i would be looking to cast him in a mob movie (French or Belgium mob of course cuz i don't know if hes worked on a NYC accent :) Anyway back to the movie. Great acting all around, an pretty original situation that i won't spoil here but its not your typical bank robbery. He certainly the underdog in this movie, so much so that early on you start to realize things won't end well but whether they do or don't i won't say, all i can say is that there is a scene in this movie that made me get up and cheer like i haven't done since i saw Rocky IV in the theaters towards the end of the cold war.

JCVD, i really hope this means your back. Just please don't be afraid to take action roles, its fine if you continue to do that because your loyal fans will still enjoy that. BUT PLEASE KEEP THIS NEW ERA GOING! Your a serious actor now. Get more serious roles! You will finally put Steven Seagal under your heal, because i never thought he had half the talent you do.

3725464,4,B001O0QFRM,"After almost twenty-five years and more than thirty films, we all assumed we knew Jean-Claude Van Damme: fancy martial arts and painful acting. JCVD therefore comes as a shock. Thankfully, the US (Region 1) release provides DVD cover art that helps soften the blow for those expecting another direct-to-video action effort. The same cannot be said for the Region 2 UK release by Revolver Entertainment. Looking at that cover art (complete with exploding buildings and hovering helicopter) would have you believe this is more of the same from Mr. Van Damme. Word to the wise: I bought the R2 release for the extra bonus features.

I will not spoil your enjoyment of what is ultimately a film worth watching. Mr. Van Damme shows he can act with emotion. But there are caveats. First, he is playing himself, with all the baggage that entails. Perhaps channeling his Method Acting was organic. Can he do as well playing a character? Second, much of his speaking in JCVD is in his native French. Can he ever reach a comfort level with American English or will the language barrier limit his appeal to European cinema?

More importantly, and after watching the ""Making Of"" documentary (on the UK release), I'm not sure another director will want to invest in the kind of hand-holding that seemed necessary to bring out the best in Mr. Van Damme. It's almost as if he was never taught how to act and he is just learning it all for the first time. Or like a child with developmental delays who gets frustrated when he has trouble picking up a new skill quickly. And as that child may lash out physically, so too does Mr. Van Damme need a gentle but firm chaperone on set. So unless Mabrouk El Mechri wants to work with him exclusively, despite JCVD being a personal tour de force, it might not be a breakout performance for Mr. Van Damme after all. We need to see what kind of projects he can attach himself to going forward. But I will say this: the director (M el M) has a very bright future. I could easily see him doing a stylish, gritty action movie, a la Bourne.

Not sure why JCVD did not have more exposure stateside. Still, Mr. Van Damme garnered a Best Actor nomination from the Toronto Film Critics Association (2008).

I'm rating this 4 stars because it doesn't come with extras (other than perhaps the deleted scenes). If you have a region-free player, I strongly suggest getting the R2 release of JCVD. It's cheaper, plus it comes with the aforementioned ""Making of JCVD"" documentary, as well as an insightful ""A Day with JCVD"" featurette.

There is some action, some comedy and a lot of talking, and throughout ""JCVD"" stays interesting.  This movie borders on Euro art-house territory, without crossing that line of pretension that makes me kick movies out of the player a quarter of the way through.

However - and this is a bit startling - you might benefit from some patience, as well as a familiarity with French 'art-house' cinema. I was completely taken off guard by many of the directing decisions, which are often risky, but typically pay off in amazing ways. Van Damme is likable and carries this idea admirably to its finish. Though I doubt it will breathe life into his career (and I don't think it was intended to), the film captures the sadness in his face in every scene. In all, this is a surprisingly watchable examination of celebrity, victimization, and regret, carried out in the hyper-realistic tradition of 'Being John Malcovich' and 'Coffee & Cigarettes'.

I loved this film.  I didn't know what to expect; other than it was ""different"" from his usual film.  What an unexpected treat to see a washed-up film action star playing a version of himself with such painful honesty and introspection.  It's some of the most honest acting I've seen in a long time (compares well with Mickey O'Rourke's performance in The Wrestler).

Van Damme's soliloquy just past the half-way point in the film, where he speaks directly to the audience, is nothing short of existential brilliance.  He gives us a heartfelt monologue on his life, his shortcomings, and even hints at deeper metaphysical subjects, such as the meaning of life.  However, don't think it's some pretentious art film just because of this scene.  There's still plenty of violence and action, just not mindless violence.  This film actually compares well with a lot of the great French ""new wave"" crime dramas from the 1960s, such as ""Breathless"", ""Touchez Pas Au Grisbi"", and ""Bob Le Flambeur"".",1248739200,2,1239,4.811320754716981

3725477,4,B001O0QFRM,"In the reality-twisting, self-parodying, French-talking film JCVD, Jean-Claude Van Damme gets another crack at something he can't swing a helicopter kick at: an acting role. In his cinematic career Van Damme has had spots in which he's delivered with nicely acted scenes, all found in his better movies (NOWHERE TO RUN, HARD TARGET, UNIVERSAL SOLDIER, TIMECOP). But mostly all that's ever been required of him are those helicopter kicks and a chiseled body. But JCVD finds the Muscles from Brussels stepping out of his B-movie action genre and into a pretty darn dramatic role. Here, we finally get a real peek at Van Damme's acting chops. But who would've have thought his role of a lifetime would be that of playing himself?

In L.A. he's just lost a custody battle for his daughter. He hasn't slept in two days, and, having just flown from L.A. to his native home of Brussels, he's suffering from serious jet lag. He's low on funds; the ATM has just rejected his credit cards. And the Belgian police think he's masterminded a post office robbery which has just escalated into a hostage situation. Or as one member of the converging media solemnly states: ""We have an actor here who's obviously disgruntled..."" This is about as down-and-out as Jean-Claude Van Damme can get.

Word to the wise, when you watch this one, don't expect yet another cheesy action flick. After an extended tracking shot sequence in the opening - in which Van Damme, in a scene within a scene, does his patented action hero thing to a string of stuntmen - JCVD buckles down to a deliberately-paced thriller-drama. Meaning that, while there is suspense, there certainly isn't much in the way of martial arts mayhem. JCVD marks a departure for Van Damme, and considering that most of his films reek with a career-crippling sense of sameness, the man had to be excited to do this movie and demonstrate to the world that, yep, he can actually turn in a noteworthy acting performance. Is the film gimmicky? Oh, yes, brother. But it's also a gimmicky film that's compelling. I don't hesitate to call the final product a fine and revelatory brand of meta-storytelling.

The fun part is that JCVD manages to throw in these nice and funny little digs. Van Damme clearly doesn't mind skewering his image, his reputation, and his movies. In the film he finds himself being chastised by a woman cabbie and his movies denounced as unfit for children. And I snorted when, in the film, he learns that he'd just lost a part to Steven Seagal, who got the nod when he agreed to snip off his ponytail. There's this funny line about John Woo served up by one outraged thug (a huge fan of Van Damme), who credits the Muscles from Brussels with bringing John Woo to Hollywood. This thug states that, without Van Damme, John Woo would ""still be filming pigeons in Hong Kong."" Heh. But the most fascinating bit arrives over an hour into the film, when Van Damme seems to rise like the holy ghost, breaks down the fourth wall, and has a six-minute confessional heart-to-heart with the movie audience (and are those tears glistening in his eyes? I think they are).

Slim pickings in the way of DVD bonus features. There's the ever-present theatrical trailer. There are two deleted scenes, a different take, respectively, on the cigarette kicking scene and the scene with Jean-Claude attempting to define what being ""aware"" is to one of the hostage takers (although, really, Jean-Claude is just rambling here). And that's it for bonus features. Like I said, slim pickings.

I really like this movie, but if I have to come up with a peeve, here's a minor one. The way it plays out, it's a bit unbelievable to me that Van Damme's lawyer needed to be woken up by a phone call, after one of Van Damme's ""demands"" has the police transferring funds into his legal firm's account and, more importantly, considering the fact that it's this lawyer's movie star client who's being surrounded by the Belgian constabulary with the media and a massive crowd camped out. You'd think this lawyer guy would be sitting around, transfixed in front of his TV set.

I'm fairly certain that Van Damme's life is better in real life. I'm also quite positive that Van Damme has never been taken hostage or been mistaken for a heist ringleader. But he probably shares his onscreen counterpart's insecurities and frustration about his film career. Van Damme has taken his share of snarky shots (and, yes, I've bagged on him, too), so I'm guiltily stoked for the dude that JCVD has been garnering so many rave reviews. No, JCVD isn't your typical low rent straight-to-video action flick. This is a surprisingly good art house picture, featuring a consistently effective Jean-Claude Van Damme who, at 47 years old, now shows wear and tear on his face and who, after more than two decades in the movie business, has also managed to improve on his craft. Guy has always had helicopter kicks. But, now, he's also got gravitas.",1242518400,2,4946,4.765460910151692
3725478,3,B001O0QFRM,"Maybe I'm just a dumb hick, but I didn't see what was so great about this film. The highlight of the critical reviews all focused on JCVD's acting. Maybe I was already aware (no, pun intended) of Van Damme's acting ability. I mean, it's nothing I hadn't seen him do in Until Death (a bravura performance where he plays a drug addict who has a near death experience), In Hell (a man falsely imprisoned for his wife's murder), and even in the beginning of the often neglected Desert Heat (Van Damme in the desert drunk and suicidal, a lot of emotion in these scenes). But, anyways, I'm glad my childhood hero finally gets his due. Even if the film itself (in my opinion) wasn't that great, the experience of watching Van Damme's dwindling star light up again was enjoyable enough.

If you're renting this expecting anything at all in the way of action then you are going to be extremely disappointed because apart from the opening scene (which turns out to be a scene from a movie he is supposedly filming) there is a total of two kicks, an elbow, and maybe a punch. I think that perhaps as Van Damme nears 50 has realized that his career as an action star is living on borrowed time and that this film might serve as his calling card to the world of serious film-makers, at least in Europe. And it definitely does that in a most impressive fashion. With the making of this film the Muscles from Brussles proves himself to be undoubtedly the most talented thespian of all kwailo martial artists, and probably most Asian martial artists as well. Here he presents himself as amiable-- though world weary, down trodden, and scrambling to hold together the last vestiges of his fading career, and he does so very convinvcingly. Its been said that the most difficult thing for an actor to play is himself. If that's the case then Van Damme deserves an Oscar.",1242259200,28,1177,4.5046728971962615

Of course, he's playing himself. Returning to Brussels after a disappointing trip to Hollywood, Van Damme politely poses for pictures with a few fans before hurrying off to withdraw some money from a Post Office bank. But the bank is being robbed by three men who take Van Damme hostage. A police officer who sees Van Damme through a window assumes he is one of the criminals. The criminals decide it's a good idea to go along with this perception. Meanwhile, a crowd of fans gathers in the street outside to cheer their favorite action hero on.

Mabrouk El Mechri directed and co-wrote this smart dark comedy. He spares neither Van Damme nor his fans. Van Damme, the character, is an aging action hero whose career is on the skids, his personal life at a low point, and he's short of cash. He's a nobody in Hollywood, but everyone in Belgium worships him and knows the details of his private life. Stressed and sleep-derived, Van Damme ends up in the middle of a robbery, where everyone's expectations of him make it difficult to do the right thing. He's a sympathetic character with real troubles. The film has a dark aesthetic that borders on murky at times. But its impressive melange of ideas build tension and incorporate some action, all the while being clever, funny, and insightful. In English and French with subtitles.

The DVD (PeaceArch 2009): The film is available in several language versions. The theatrical release is in French and English with English subtitles for the French. There is an English version that dubs the French in English. And there is also a French version that subtitles the English in French. And there are Spanish and English SDH subtitled versions. Bonus features are a theatrical trailer (English, 2 1/2 min), 2 deleted or extended scenes (5 1/2 min) with optional English subtitles.

3725482,5,B001O0QFRM,"JCVD.  It's one of the best movies I've seen this year.  Although it had only a limited 2008 theatrical release, it is now widely available on Blu-Ray and DVD.

The movie is fictional, and yet highly auto-biographical for action star Jean-Claude Van Damme (J.C.V.D.), who was a huge Hollywood star peaking in the early 1990's.  Van Damme plays himself.  A former A-list actor now struggling to make b-movies and hard up for cash in the midst of a child custody battle.  He's tired.  He's 47 years old.  And he keeps losing the few roles he can get his hands on to Steven Seagal.  But he's still buff, and when he does land a role, he's still able to deliver the acrobatic kicks that have been his trade mark since 1988.

JCVD begins as a movie within a movie.  Van Damme kicks, punches and shoots his way out of some war-torn Asian city until part of the set collapses.  An out-of-breath Van Damme tries to explain to the complacent director that he's too old to do every scene in one take.  The director scoffs and says, ""He thinks we're making Citizen Kane.""

Cut to the courtroom where his child custody battle ensues.  His daughter admits she is the butt of jokes due to her has been father.  Then we see his agent won't help him get a role in a studio movie (Van Damme even offers to do it for free).  His lawyer calls him to say his check bounced and is about to drop the child custody case.

And exhausted and desperate Van Damme returns to his birthplace in Belgium where the locals are still eager to meet him and have their picture taken with him.  But Van Damme runs into trouble when he gets caught up in a post office hold-up and the authorities mistake him for the criminal.  We soon learn that there are hostages inside, including a child and a wounded man, and the authorities reach out to Van Damme (who we find out later is being held at gun point while on the phone with the cops) and ask what his demands are.

I won't spill any more of this entertaining story, except I must mention the movie's surprising centerpiece.  As we march towards the climax, a bloodied and exhausted Van Damme resigns himself to a chair amongst the other hostages, seemingly giving up hope, and then something completely extraordinary happens that no one would see coming.  He jumps up and disarms all three crooks with one mighty karate kick?  Nope.

The narrative halts as Van Damme's chair is lifted into the rafters where we can clearly see that he is on a movie set.  He looks right into the camera and begins one of the most moving monologues I can ever remember seeing.  His eyes fill with tears as he truthfully recounts how he came to Hollywood with nothing, not even knowing English, but that he believed in his dreams.  He goes on to talk about his ups and downs, how he got hooked and then beat drugs, how he believes in love and honor (what the martial arts taught him), and how the devils in tinsel town really treat people, and the real-life Hollywood producers' quote he uses will stun viewers.  He can't help but to break down and cry as he admits he is tortured when he sees those less fortunate than him who are just as talented if not more so.  He openly wonders why he was successful when so many are not.  In an unheard of position of vulnerability, and perhaps redeeming the guilt he might have for making violent movies, the action star concludes with genuine tears streaking down his face, ""it's so stupid to kill people, they're so beautiful!""

Without this piece, the movie's smart, entertaining and good.  With it, a masterpiece.

I commend JCVD, as a person for the willingness to self analyze, and as a film. His two dialogue spots are incredible (the contract discussion with his agent and the monologue towards the end).

As far as the Blu goes, it came across beautifully. The subtitles look crisp, the large volume of silvers and halo lighting actually shine through nicely. The clarity was improved enough from the DVD that I could actually read all of the boxes in the movie store (sounds corny but as a movie store owner it was interesting for me). The sound was adequate and was closest to perfection in the theatrical cut, as the dubbed version was atrocious - skipper there.

I hope fans of his give this one a try and are not disappointed. As far as the Blu goes it is not the best color display, I believe there are none, but it is crisp and worth the time.",1241136000,2,994,4.338709677419355

3725485,2,B001O0QFRM,"...because it's pretty boring.

Seriously.

I had heard stuff about this film, that it was suppose to show Van Damme in a whole new light, well it does, and that new light is, ""boring"".

I've seen just about every Van Damme film there is, and I'd be willing to call him anything (so-so actor, etc.) but, ""boring"" is a word that I would never in a million years thought that I'd ever use to describe him in a film, but that's the only word I can think of to describe this movie and his performance, ""boring"".

Now the actual plot of this film sounds interesting enough, Van Damme plays himself (a discontented, B rated action star, who just wants to be taken seriously as an actor, pining for any small part, in any relevant, big screen movie, which conflicts with his management's plans for him; plans that will keep him playing B rated action movies for large sums of quick cash) who stumbles into a robbery situation, which he is then accused of being the instigator of, while it's taking place.

The problem with the execution is, the pacing, which makes this movie feel like a slowly paced stage play; so slow in fact as to become actually boring, real fast.

I personally only managed to sit through 45 minutes of this thing before I had to watch something else for fear of acquiring Narcolepsy (or for fear of having my brains slide down into my shoes, as can sometimes happen, when one finds oneself watching something so boring, as to actually make the prospect of watching grass grow, seem like a pleasure).

Now, I've managed to sit, all the way through, some really inane drivel, but this movie just couldn't keep my interest enough for me to really care, what the outcome of the film would be.

If you really want to see Van Damme stretch his acting chops then I'd suggest you check out, WAKE OF DEATH and/or IN HELL, both films are chalk full of action sequences, but also give Van Damme a great platform to show us some surprisingly good, dramatic acting abilities.

I had some high hopes for this film, but was ultimately disappointed with the story and pacing (I will say this much for the film though, it does have one of the best opening credit scenes that I've ever seen (although, even though it's suppose to be one continuous scene with no camera brakes, you can still see the camera ""cheats"" that were done to accomplish this effect) it's just too bad that the rest of the movie couldn't live up to the imaginative scope of the opening scene).",1241136000,4,2465,4.50896860986547
3725486,4,B001O0QFRM,"Jean-Claude Van Damme has pretty much always been known as a cliche action movie star. He's known for his skills in various different types of martial arts and if you haven't seen any of his films, you can pretty much figure out what they're heavy on (and more than likely light on) considering his talents. Along comes JCVD, a film that tells the story of what it's like to be a washed up action star. Between his money problems and his ongoing custody battle for his daughter with his ex-wife, Van Damme has a full plate. So he decides to travel to Belgium, his homeland, to reconnect with his parents and hopefully just get away from all the headaches that come with living a Hollywood lifestyle. Then, a simple trip to the post office turns into a nightmare as Van Damme realizes he may not be walking out of there alive.

JCVD shows a side of Van Damme that nobody has really seen before. His acting chops take center stage this time around and it's incredible how much range he actually has. He's able to showcase the fact that he has a lot more talent than fans or the moviegoing audience actually gave him credit for. There's a six minute monologue that might just be the best scene in the film. You can hear the pain in Van Damme's voice as the anguish he's going through bleeds through the words spilling from his mouth. Tears stream down his face as his face wrenches in torment. And then as quickly as the monologue begins, it ends. The scene itself, along with the way it was pulled off, is really the most memorable part of the film for me.

JCVD highlights all of the potential Jean-Claude Van Damme has as an actor. Not as an action movie star, but as a legitimate actor. Don't go into this expecting the usual bone breaking or face bashing someone may find in a film that Van Damme is usually found in. This film has a kick to it and not in the literal sense. It's an unexpected surprise that could put Van Damme back on top of his game, if played right. It could certainly do for him what The Wrestler did for Mickey Rourke. People who aren't fans of Van Damme's work will more than likely still enjoy this if they're willing to give it a chance.

3725487,5,B001O0QFRM,"The stereotypical Jean-Claude role involves a high focus on action and strings together a series of A-B plot sequences, which works effectively and cleanly in most karate/kung fu films.  JCVD is not one of these films.  This is a landmark achievement and deserves praise and consideration.  If you have ever looked upon the action film star in a derisive manner, if you have ever brushed off the ability of Jean-Claude as both an actor and a martial artist, or if you have ever criticized someone for leading their life the way they choose without having all the details, then this movie is without question for you.
I will not give a plot summary, or attempt to go into the details of the movie, nevertheless it should be noted that this film is in many ways a critique of hollywood's abusive treatment of a hard-working class of people.  It is a critique of destructive media practices, of the prying star stalker that hounds an individual for attempting to earn a living doing something he or she loves.  It is a critique of parenthood and family and what matters most in life.
This film documents real emotion in a surreal manner, taking the spectator into a highly produced piece in order to offer a perspective from the inside looking out.  Jean-Claude masterfully utilizes his life experience to convey his true feelings about his aspirations, his dreams - both fulfilled and shot down, and his undying hope in his work.  This is more than a comeback movie.  This film is Belgium.
Belgium is a highly interesting country, having three national languages and being the home of the United Nations, and its history in media is even more curious.  Very often, artists and writers from Belgium will publish in France in order to gain a larger public, since there are more French-speakers world-wide than Flemish speakers, and yet, since the time of Baudelaire's Fleurs du Mal Belgium has had received a bad reputation in literature and the arts, mostly thanks to France's elitist narcissism.  JCVD is set in Belgium and is made for his fans in Belgium.  Despite the obvious language tie to the French here, this movie is Belgian through and through.
Rent it.  Buy it.  Watch it.  It will take you by surprise and most likely be a delightful change of pace from the typical action movie role you are used to seeing Jean-Claude play.
Jean-Claude...Continue making movies!  Don't quit, no matter how difficult it may seem!  You are your dream, and although it may not be apparent at times, know that your work is appreciated.",1240617600,5,2524,4.78110599078341

Van Damme basically does play himself here: a washed up actor who blew his Hollywood stardom and is stuck in a bitter custody battle over his daughter.  He's reduced to starring in sub-par B-movies, and on top of it all, he's broke.  Now back in Brussels, Van Damme goes on his way to the post office to sort out his money situation, only to walk head first into a robbery, where the crooks make it look like he's the one behind it.  Despite many of the reviews on here, JCVD is neither fantastic nor dreadful, it just falls somewhere in between.  However, for Van Damme fans, JCVD is a must see.  Van Damme is unusually good playing himself, and his monologue to the camera towards the end of the film is especially heartfelt.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Jean- Claude Van Damme's getting no respect
2. It's so bad that even Steven Seagal steals a movie role from him
3. ""The Muscles"" returns to Brussels where at least everyone knows his name
4. His cash-strapped position leads him to the post office
5. People go postal
6. He's misunderstood once again
7. He gets no respect, except from the people watching this movie.

Van Damme is brilliant playing a down and out version of himself, as he suffers the heartbreak of a custody battle, the indignity of a shortage of cash, and worse of all, the loss of the lead role in a B movie to Steven Seagal.

Speaking about his life, his wives and his career, he shows that he's quite willing to take pot shots at himself, and why not? Almost everybody does at one time or another.

From the opening action scene, which is to die (laughing) for, to the tense conclusion and nonsensical wrap-up, this is a new side of JCVD, and I think I like it.

I must confess that I was a hugh Van Damme fan all through the 90's. Since Bloodsport, all the way till Maximum Risk I've always paid to see his films. As we all know he fell off making only R rated films all through the 2000's, but I feel JCVD is his tickets back into a second wind of stardom!

I never thought through his career that he acted badly, as some others protrayed. But in JCVD is definitely showed that he is without a doubt, an actor! I feel this movie opens the door for more great films to come from him.

Also, the film is partly in French, which really isn't all that bad, because I'm a big fan of films being authentic. Regardless if you are a fan of Van Damme's or not, this is worth at least checking out once.",1236902400,10,849,4.13939393939394

10. Is his enemy unbeatable? How does one truly conquer one's own demons?
11. Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance?  In life, in court, and in a precarious post office predicament, JCVD is constantly plagued by his own shining star.
12. Does he win? The most revealing win of his career.

Beginning with an introspective peek inside production at a JCVD movie, we learn that he is no longer the man he once was.  Sure, he's still dynamic, powerful, and above all a bona fide superstar, but he's also not quite as capable as he once was at a younger age.  Despite the fact that he's 47 - something his new director disregards like a slave driver - he still manages to put together a pulse-pounding intro in a single take, with multiple attackers, countless weapons, a wall falling over like in a Buster Keaton movie, and even his patented testicle attacks.

The plot of the movie itself is rather ingenious.  It's JCVD playing himself, in a movie soaked in the realism of his every day life.  What it must be like to be one of a few superstars in a smaller country.  He handles his situation with class, poise, and humility.  Facing a ruthless child custody hearing, he must display those traits just to maintain a semblance of sanity.  All that changes when he walks into a robbery and the criminals decide to use his celebrity to their advantage.  What ensues is a battle of wills and wits, as Van Damme uses his status to gain the trust of his fellow prisoners, as well as to manipulate the mind and break the bond between the trio of robbers.

Most impressive about JCVD is a lengthy, heartfelt monologue midway through the movie.  He talks directly into the camera and completely exposes his innermost thoughts.  Separated from the cast and the set for a moment, similar to how a play differentiates group acting and audience interaction - a break from the other characters - he pours out raw emotion.  Directly mocking Hollywood stardom, he struggles emotionally through real life references to his marriage and drug problems; it's personal, and it's deep.

His stardom is obviously a difficult subject.  How he feels both vindicated and tortured by his success at the same time - why can't others be as lucky?  On the verge of tears, a breakdown must have been difficult to hold back; it wouldn't be surprising to discover the scene took multiple takes.  It reinforces his frailties, and it supports the script that proposes his humanism, his mortality, that would clearly take over were a real gun placed to his head.

The monologue is also where JCVD displays his acting ability.  He's actually a good actor - something obvious to anyone who has seen In Hell, Wake of Death, or Nowhere to Run.  Speaking in his native language, it's easier to express emotions.  In all actuality, it's probably the language barrier in other films that makes him less believable.  When working with familiarity, the acting range flows as easily as the dialogue (the subtitles are fast, unobtrusive, and seamlessly integrated).  It's hard not to side with Van Damme, from the very beginning the viewer is privy to the behind the scenes treatment he often receives, and the undeserved lack of respect he commands as an actor

JCVD deserves similar praise to the fawning Mickey Rourke has received for ""The Wrestler"".  This film poignantly proves that he has real acting chops, and that he can truly tap into that deep-seeded trauma which all great actors grasp when needed.  He's painfully sincere, and completely fascinating in this exposition.  His jump may have lost an inch, his kick may have lost some power, and his splits may not be as straight as they once were, but he is revitalized in this tour de force.  Even for non-fans, JCVD comes highly recommended.",1235952000,7,4534,4.642857142857143

3725497,4,B001O0QFRM,"This is a good movie on many levels.  It's a deep movie and very well thought out and it is a honest and heartfelt flick that features a excellent performance from jean claude van damme.  The actor almost destroyed himself due to drugs back in his heyday and now he's clean and that's great news because people's choices in hero positions wether it be karate hero or sports hero can heavily influence others.  In fact he  explains his life and choices  in a wonderful tearfilled monologue  that takes place within the context of the movie.
The movie should be applauded for it's realism in showing how real violence and reacting to it usually happens.  This isn't regular action film stuff; it's people stunned and traumatized and even action heroes may not know what to do, or if they do they might not  come out unhurt either. They may die or be maimed. this fact only makes one realize how hard the job of soldier or policeman really is after all.
It looks easy on reel movie life,  but it's all overwelming and a shock to the system in real life.  This point is made when jean imagines himself in a  film hero type rescue and then tries a desperate move to do the right thing.
This why perhaps they should show real bloody victims on tv of gang violence or robbery violence and then people can stop fantasizing about outlaws as heroes.
 This movie is a good movie but it isn't really a typical action movie at all.  And it's worth watching if you don't expect a standard action flick with many explosive scenes and a more escapist nonrealistic approach. Those movies have their place and are fun but this isn't one of them. It is a good drama and jean claude will hopefully stay sober and keep making more movies of any type including dramas. This movie can be watched in a dubbed english version or in it's native french version.  The blu ray print is excellent and like most modern movies you don't want to see this on standard dvd when you can see it on blu ray.",1235692800,2,1969,4.433333333333334
3725498,5,B001O0QFRM,"Like the majority, I stopped watching V.D. when his movies became so cookie-cutter and over the top.  Then he went and did two movies under the radar and long past his prime.  They were ""In Hell"" and ""Wake of Death.""  This renewed my faith in Mr. Splits.  Of course, he doesn't do his over-the-top moves in either of those movies, as the stories are more character driven...yes, I said it, he has movies that are character driven.  Anyway, it inticed me to see what else he has been doing and sure enough along came JCVD.

This movie was a pleasure to view.  It starts off as him starring in an underbudget action movie replica of his early career.  It turns into a sarcastic mock when he and the director try to work out a scene.  After that, Van Damme doesn't do much in the kick/punch genre.  This is a straight up great story and Van Damme does a wonderful job reflecting on his life choices and how it has led him into this particular situation.

You will get to see Van Damme act and dare I say, much better than several actors who have won presitgous awards.  I think it helps that he speaks in his native tongue and it doesn't sound like broken english.  If by somechance they make a DUBBED version, I hope no one sees it, because it won't do it justice.  There are some english spoken lines, but most of it is done with subtitles...it works!

After watching these three movies, I sure hope Van Damme is given a chance with an American studio to show his Acting, not fighting, chops.

Off the subject, ""In Hell"" is a dark look at a foreign prison and how it takes a toll on someone, while ""Wake of Death"" is very very violent at times...has some standard cliches, but overall, it is a good picture.  Not for kids!",1234310400,3,1721,4.344827586206897
3725499,5,B001O0QFRM,"JCVD has never been so convincing!!

3725500,5,B001O0QFRM,"I caught a screening of this film recently and was blown away. I've only been a fan of Bloodsport, and that's about it when it comes to Van Damme's filmography. But I feel JCVD is his best yet. It's personal, it's funny, it's sad, it's got so many different aspects that make it a strong film. It's a comeback of sorts even though he's been making films overseas for quite some time. This year has been a great time to watch films with so many great stories and performances. JCVD has both of them.

I could tell by the way the film was shot that it's going to look GREAT on blu ray. I'm going to be picking this one on blu ray instead of the DVD.",1233878400,5,647,4.094488188976378

3725502,5,B001O0QFRM,"I came upon a crowd outside a movie theater bearing the title: JCVD. The theater is jammed with dedicated fans having memories of Van Damme's past International super star status from the 1988 Bloodsport.

What a movie! It likely surpassing the collective expectations from the start of the entire audience. The opening scene rocks. A 4-minute film within a film begins with vintage-like Van Damme moments of high energy action. This single-shot sequence unfolds vamping up Van Damme's pre-existing persona in dynamic fashion. Then this incredible assembly of action ends with a hilarious fake wall falling over when a door is simply slammed too hard by a winded and exhausted Van Damme blithely complaining to a movie director, who couldn't care less (as in real life), that he is 47 and it is simply too hard to do these mad action scenes at his age!

The film then pivots under the young but world class directorship of Mabrouk El Mechri to the main story, where the audience is treated to a Van Damme they have never seen before acting with incredible depth and character. This transformation from a shallow bigger-than-life action hero to portraying true down-to-life emotions will be worth the admission alone.

Van Damme's dramatic performance and his featured monologue --- are remarkable. The director caught Van Damme on film in a way to make any audience celebrate with rousing enthusiasm alongside Van Damme as he convincingly relates his belief in the American dream, then address his marriage and drug problems of his past, and how he wants a second chance to make a difference in the world. It is one of those cinema moments bordering on being a masterpiece; it re-invents Van Damme.

The camera floats through the chaos of Van Damme's life and caresses Van Damme's face that has taken on a good amount of character. Van Damme has stories in his eyes. Van Damme has life in his eyes. Van Damme has sadness in his eyes. Van Damme has regrets in his eyes. Van Damme has a message to deliver. The movie cleverly uncovers the pitfalls behind celebrity status with humor that Van Damme does very well.

The plot borrows on Van Damme's trying past.  Playing himself, a beaten and depressed Van Damme returns to his native Belgium in hopes of getting out of the limelight. Van Damme is financially drained and makes a bee line to his home bank. But the Belgium bank is in the midst of being robbed. Van Damme is caught up in the ensuing mayhem as the police on arrival wrongly assume Van Damme is part of the robbery team. The actual criminals are enjoying extravagant good luck. Not only do they have Belgium's biggest movie star in their control, but through his ill-luck he is also taking the fall for them! In trying to find a way out, Van Damme realizes his Hollywood action roles of his past all fall flat when a real gun is pressed to his head.

This is a movie to be seen, not merely read about. Not only is Van Damme re-born but so too is the audience through a shared experience with Van Damme's factual failures and triumphs! (Dr. R. Witmer, Ph. D. co-author of Van Damme's Biography appearing [...])",1233878400,29,3119,4.701465201465202
3725503,5,B001O0QFRM,"Now like many I too accept that Jean Claude Van Damme isn't the greatest actor in the world. He's an action hero after all and much like Steven Seagal, he's someone we wouldn't usually expect a 5 star acting performance from. He's just used to kicking people in the head and looking all attractive whilst doing so. Now he's older and currently a man who's career was absolutely dying a death, at least until this film was made and now he has the possibility to be back on form and revive his career as a more serious actor.

So what makes this film different from all the rest? I hear you ask. Well for one he's not playing some clichd character who you end up shouting ""kick his head off"" at. He's actually playing himself in a fictional setting and as strange as it sounds it actually allows him to display much more acting talent than you would have first thought.

So what's the film about? I hear you secondly ask. Well, JCVD's life isn't going too well and is constantly in battle to win movie roles but is constantly beaten by his rival Steven Seagal. His wife has divorced him and is in legal battles for the right to have access to his daughter. He also has quite a few tax and money troubles to boot, so to escape his troubles he decides to go home to his native Belgium only this isn't as peaceful as he'd hoped.

Upon his arrival in Belgium he goes into a Post Office, and after his fans tell a local policeman that the legendary Jean Claude Van Damme is home and in the local post office. Then out of nowhere a gunshot rings from the post office sending people into a panic and shocked that it turns out to be the movie star himself holding up the post office, or is it?

Well what entails is a film about hostage negotiation and a traumatic movie star life that is topped off with a difficult situation. It's not the typical JCVD film as it contains very little fighting karate style, but the film is made truly special with the defining monologue. Roughly half way through the film, JCVD is brought away from the story and the film in quite a strange style that allows him to deliver a monologue that gives the impression it comes straight from the heart. He talks about his life and career and how he wants to be remembered as a more serious actor. I got the impression that a lot of the monologue although in a scripted movie, was actually improvised or at least written by JCVD himself.

I would highly recommend this film to any JCVD and non-JCVD fan as it's truly his best work to date. This is seriously a possible breakthrough movie for him to bring his career back up to speed and rather than continuing to star in ""straight to DVD"" movies like this one, sadly, he may be given more movies that start in the cinema and give him a wider appeal as the man is still a name that captures peoples interests.

There is some remarkable cinematography throughout, witty language, and great editing throughout. The movie breaks the fourth wall unapologetically and it absolutely enhances this terrific movie.
