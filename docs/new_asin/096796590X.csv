173471,5,096796590X,Naader is my first and only yoga instructor.  His classes provide a great physical workout and a spiritually uplifting experience.  This video is a  great resource for the times I cannot make it to class.,965088000,5,204,4.771428571428571
173472,5,096796590X,Naader has taken his class directly to video - this is a wonderful  opportunity to experience his caring and warm direction for beginning to  intermediate students of hatha yoga.  The next best thing to being there.,964569600,,215,4.916666666666667
173473,5,096796590X,"This is a wonderful yoga video and it provides a complete mind, body and spirit workout.  Naader Shagagi is a peaceful guide who not only helps you place your body in the right position but gives you insight to give your  mind a workout as well.  This is an intermediate level ""class""  and it provides an outstanding workout of the entire body from head to toe.  I've only seen a few yoga videos but this is by far the best I have  encountered.",964483200,17,444,4.289156626506024
173474,5,096796590X,"I am fortunate to be a student in Naader's yoga classes at Yoga Kingdom in Pasadena, CA. As someone who has studied yoga on and off for 25 years, i can confidently say that Naader's class is the most complete and  well-rounded I have ever taken. For those in other parts of the world who  would like access to an energizing, healing yoga workout, I would highly  recommend this video.",964483200,3,384,4.457142857142857
173475,5,096796590X,"I love this video.  I'm more than 100 pounds overweight and this video is about the only exercise I ever get. The reviews say this video is for intermediate yoga students but I've been doing most of the exercises since  I was a beginner.  There are only a few postures that are beyond my  capability.  I just fast forward through those postures.  This is a very  step-by-step exercise program that holds the positions long enough for us  ""slower"" folks to get into position and still hold it long enough  to get the full workout.  I've tried other videos and I either can't keep  up or I can't follow what the teacher is doing.  With Naader I can keep up  and get the full workout I need and want.  I've given this video to many of  my slim friends and they love it too!",964483200,,770,4.286713286713287
173476,5,096796590X,"This is a great video for beginners and intermediate yoga students. Naader has a calming presence and inspirational presentation. Of all the yoga videos I've watched, this is the best. I loved the quotes and music and  overall presentation. This video has built up my concentration, will power,  balance, flexibility and strength, unlike other videos which only  concentrate on one or two. For me, this is the only one I need.",964051200,4,426,4.971830985915493

7794097,5,096796590X,"I've been using ""The Power of Hatha Yoga"" for over a year now and I find it to be very challenging, and yet surprisingly calming, at the same time.  The tape is pretty long, but when it's over, you hardly notice that 80 minutes has gone by.  It's hard to do this tape after work, as I wind up finishing around 8:00pm, which is kind of late to be eating dinner.  But, I usually skip dinner on those nights and just have a small protein shake or light salad.  I can stay up much later and sleep so much more peaceful on the nights that I complete this yoga tape.  I wouldn't recommend this tape for anyone who has small children, unless you have a quiet place without interruptions.  Eighty minutes is a long time to ignore the little kiddies.  Out of all of the yoga tapes that I own, this is by far my favorite!",1096243200,,811,4.160256410256411
7794098,5,096796590X,"This is an excellent video!  Naader Shagagi is an inspiration to watch and practice with.  His easy-to-listen-to voice provides clarity and understanding as he guides you through this very thorough yoga workout.  It is challenging enough for the seasoned yoga student and athlete, while it covers some basic essentials of Hatha yoga that will benefit anyone on a more introductory level.  If you have to buy just one yoga video, this should be the one.",1069372800,,452,4.986666666666666
7794099,5,096796590X,"I have been practicing yoga for 12 years and recently my schedule required me to practice on my own.  I found Shagagi's tape online and I couldn't be more pleased.  The poses are strong and the breath coaching is the best I've seen in any video.  I love that the video follows the basic tenants of classic hatha yoga and holds to those principles.
Even better, I have had occasion to practice with my elderly neighbor who also found the tape doable.  She is new to hatha yoga but was able to follow Mr. Shagagi's instructions for modifications.  She also found his voice soothing, his words encouraging and inspiring.
All in all, I find this the BEST video for hatha yoga out there!!",1054598400,3,683,4.520325203252033
7794100,5,096796590X,"Naader Shagagi is a gifted and gentle teacher. He leads you through the exercises very slowly.  Naader, will lead you through 35 clearly instucted postures and two breathing exercises.  This video requires about 90 minutes to do, and it is not for beginners.
However, I look forward to the weekends so I can devote that much time to yoga. This tape really helps increas your willpower and will help you develop flexibility. This is truly a very beatiful tape. This tape helps recapture lost youth and vitality",1053129600,4,509,4.839080459770115
7794101,5,096796590X,"There is no comparison to the live Naader Shagagi but this videotape comes awful close.  Living in Montana without any yoga studios near by, we decided to set up a yoga room in our home.  We started as beginners and tapes were our only option.  Luckily we found Naader, just when we became disenchanted with what ""the popular ones"" had to offer.  Two years later (as intermediate practitioners), this tape is truly our favorite.  For it is the one we've found that most benefits the evolution of our yoga practice.
Naader's practice is the complete practice, from beginning to end.  It is entirely what yoga is supposed to be. . . .spiritually, mentally, physically, and emotionally.  The directions are comprehensive (although it's important to watch the complete video at least once before actually practicing), the demonstrations beautiful, and breathing instructions unsurpassable.  Just when you forget to take that breath, Naader is there to remind you!  Yes, you actually feel like he's right there in your yoga room!
Don't hesitate to order this tape.  You will not be disappointed.  We have since ordered dozens and shared them with so many of our friends, all having very different levels and abilities.  Everyone loves it and finds it most helpful in their personal achievements.
Now if we can only make his clone and move him to Montana. . . . .",1040256000,5,1357,4.9035087719298245
7794102,5,096796590X,"I love this video.  I was looking for a yoga class and couldn't find one that would fit my busy schedule. So I decided to purchase a tape that I could do anytime. I went on-line and found ""The Power of Hatha Yoga"" with Naader Shagagi. It is a wonderful workout for mind, body and spirit.  To achieve maximum benifits of any exercise program I believe all three of these elements are essential.  Naader is awesome.  He explains everything very thoroughly and also how the postures are helping your internal organs.  I look forward to my workouts with Naader. He epitomizes Hatha Yoga and what it can do for you...",1034899200,8,612,4.527272727272727
7794103,5,096796590X,"I have several yoga tapes and I found this one to be far superior to the others.  It is photographed simply, elegantly, and with a purity that reflects the qualities one hopes to achieve with the practice of yoga.  The soft colors and lighting combined with the choice of music further enhance the calm.
The tape is essentially a class with Naader.  It is a 90-minute tape, the length of one of his classes.  He demonstrates each pose and moves from one to another with incredible grace.  That alone is worth the price of the tape.  The ease with which he does the poses belies the challenge many of the poses present, e.g., fish pose, my personal nemesis, er um, challenge.  He stresses the importance of breath in the poses and using breath to enhance the poses.
We have yoga classes at my office and I loaned the tape to our instructor.  She returned it saying it was extraordinary.  It had re-inspired her and she recommended it to everyone in class.",1027641600,4,954,4.5321637426900585
7794104,4,096796590X,"Firstly, I would say if you have access to a decent place to practice yoga with a live teacher and classmates, I would recommend it.  As for me, I am an American ex-pat living in Taiwan and there are no schools anywhere near the small town I live in.  So I decided to order a few videos.  One being this, the other a set of Power Yoga tapes from Baron Baptiste's website.
As for this one, it is rather long compared to most tapes--for many that might not be what they're looking for, but for me it is great.  It runs around an hour and a half.  There is ample rest time to focus on the changes in body awareness between postures.  If one was a beginner I might say some of the poses might be challenging to get into and maintain, but anyone in decent shape shouldn't be too lagged during the sequence.  All in all, this is ""slow yoga""--I term this in comparison to the power yogas and ashtanga styles that are prevalent it seems, in Amazon's yoga tape selection.
For a total neophyte I would probably not recommend this as Naader does not spend excessive time explaining the poses--for anyone with experience it is Ok cause none of these postures will be unrecognizable and then it is more of a ""follow the leader"" session.  But beginners, I suggest something with more explanation.
As for the respondent with the apparent personal vendeta, I don't know what to say...certainly this video does NOT lead anyone to risk bodily injury.  That is nonsense.  Moreover, Naader's voice and the music on the tape ae not distracting. My wife has stated that she likes his tone of voice even.  As for your claims of his ""delusions"" and not ""practicing the tenets of yoga""--I don't know the man personally--but I would ask if slamming someone on a board where they have no place to defend themselves is in line with those tenets?  Your further claims on his ego and belief he is one with God--well we all are one with God so......all I am saying is you sound more like a slighted girlfriend than someone trying to spread information so we can save ourselves from a harmful yoga teacher.  You define yourself more than him.
All in all, a good tape I say--but better by far if you have a lot of time for yoga in the morning(add a 30 minute meditation at the end of the session and you got a 2 hour program) and at least 6 months to a year of yoga experience cause he doesn't explain everything.  Also, I like it more when I alternate between Naader's yoga and Baron's Power Yoga series on an every-other-day basis.
Peace",1024099200,8,2506,4.431372549019608
7794105,5,096796590X,"I have known Naader for several years and he was the first Yoga instructor that really got me to stick with yoga for a long time.  When I moved away from Los Angeles where Naader teaches, I started to loose touch with yoga -- at a pretty big cost to my peace of mind and back pain.  After trying a number of classes near my new home, I found that the tape was the best way to go.  Its a great, straight foward tape that moves you through a very thorough workout that will take care of every single part of your body.",971654400,,516,3.9902912621359223
7794106,5,096796590X,"Naader was my first yoga teacher.  When we moved out of state, this video  was my link to the best yoga routine I have ever done.  I tried other  instructors and other videos, but Naader's approach is the best -- a  balanced mix of yoga instruction and inspiration.  I have shared this tape  with many friends (who then bought their own copy!) and they all agree that  Naader's instructions are easy to follow and the pace is slow enough that  beginners can figure out what is going on before the next pose; but not so  slow that experienced students get bored.  Furthermore, since he is doing  the poses along with the student, he knows just when to offer that extra  word of encouragement when you are about to give up!  I find something new  to ponder each time I listen to this tape. Naader's words are from the  heart and they reach out to touch your heart as well as your body.  Buy  this tape and use it!!",965606400,19,912,4.3273809523809526
