Sisters is a television drama which aired on NBC for six seasons, from 1991 to 1996. The show debuted on May 11, 1991 for a seven-episode test run and was subsequently renewed for the 1991 fall schedule.

The show revolved around the Reed sisters, who lived in Winnetka, Illinois. Their recently deceased father, a doctor, had been absent and a workaholic, while their long-suffering mother had turned to alcoholism to cope with his neglect and affairs. Having always wanted sons, their father had called the girls by male versions of their full names: Alexandra was called Alex, Theodora was Teddy, Georgianna was Georgie and Francesca was Frankie.

The show became a hit with viewers. In the first episode we saw Teddy write the word 'Slut' on her sister Frankie's car, and in the last episode we saw the sisters deal with the death of their mother. The audience got to know and love these sisters.

During it's run, Sisters earned one Emmy,",1265414400,9,1301,4.730088495575221

3068760,5,B0011UO8XI,"I love the Tv series ""Sisters"" and was disappointed when it went off the air.  I loved the show cause it dealt with real issues like Georgie a stay at home wife/mom.

Teddy was a recovering Alcoholic who was trying to make amends but was very needy. That was our introduction to Sela Ward. I tried to put it on my Que in Netflix and couldn't find it.  Then I decided to purchase from Amazon cause they have everything.  I was disappointed to find out that they didn't have it either. It looks like a lot of people want to purchase this series in DVD.

Are there legal issues or is it simply that there is not enough interest?  I think there are MANY people who love this show and if odd comedies and rare dramas make their way to DVD, why not a show that ran for YEARS!  I used to love this show.  I have one of my favorite episodes on VHS that was taped way back when.  It was the THANKSGIVING episode when Georgie had a flashback to when she was younger and we learned of Beatrice's drinking problem.

3068782,5,B0011UO8XI,We are a family that came from Mexico and we used to watch the series more than 10 years ago.  My mother is a superfan of the whole series and wants so bad to have it on DVD.  Once we signed up here with our email so we could be confirmed when the series would be coming out.  It's one of the best 90's series we have ever watched.  Why are you guys taking long to release it.  We hope the series would come out even available in the Spanish language like we used to watched back home.

3068806,5,B0011UO8XI,"I was so glad to finally be able to sign up for notification when ""Sisters"" would be out on DVD - I've waited for years!  However it has been since January - and  other, lesser quaility, DVD's have been released with lightning speed.  Is there anywhere we can find out when ""Sisters"" will be out?
I had taped a few episodes and the other day I watched ""Some Tuesday in July"". Evan, Georgie's son, was diagnosed with cancer and her husband, John, gave up his dream of singing to support the family..the last scene where John, dressed in his business suit on his way to work, holding Evan in the hospital room and singing to him is one of those heartfelt moments that made ""Sisters"" so great.
It seems so much in the media today has gone astray - this show did address addiction, alcoholism, betrayl...but it wasn't screaming and raw and  ""in your face"" like so many shows are today.  It still showed character and kindness in the midst of struggles.
So - please - release it soon!",1215475200,57,979,4.446927374301676

3068809,5,B0011UO8XI,"I have 5 sisters (yes, we are 6!) and we used to LOVE watching this show with our Mom (God rest her soul) who was an only child.  Our favorite quote is when the Mom character tells the sisters ""The men in your life may leave you, children grow up, parents pass away. The only ones who are there for you, from cradle to grave, are your sisters.""  We made it our own and have been saying ""cradle to grave"" as our goodbye in emails, at then end of phone calls, a whisper in the ear during a hug goodbye.  I'm even going to get a license plate holder with that tagline.  I can't wait for this show to come out on DVD.  We're gonna buy it for sure!",1205971200,7,643,3.953488372093023

I came across it at the aol site and watched everyone of the episodes with in a week. I love this show. They actually have an image available and I think you can buy the show already. I went to the warner brothers website and searched it and it gave me a link to a website that said ""buy now"" its $250, but as a college student I might have to wait until amazon gets it and maybe it will be a little bit cheaper.

3303275,5,B0011UO8XI,"Watching this series, along with my two sisters and mother, was something we treasure to this day. We created moments together while watching ourselves through this wonderfully crafted window that display women in similiar situations as ourselves. Please DO NOT hold out any longer. What the writer, cast, and crew put together and sent out there for women to watch, learn from, laugh, and go through soooo many tissues, would be a waste to keep it from us much longer.",1235779200,,469,4.875

With all of the crappy so-called reality shows that are getting DVD releases as if anyone will care about them in the future, it is really frustrating to see good shows like Sisters go unreleased.

Once we signed up here with our email so we could be confirmed when the series would be coming out.  It's one of the best 90's series we have ever watched.  Why are you guys taking long to release it.  We hope the series would come out even available in the Spanish language like we used to watched back home.

3303302,5,B0011UO8XI,I too have been waiting for this sitcom to become available. I was addicted to this show when my son was born. the night before he was born i was ever so faithful in front of the TV.This show portrayed every day living and all problems and blessings in life.

3303303,5,B0011UO8XI,"I was so glad to finally be able to sign up for notification when ""Sisters"" would be out on DVD - I've waited for years!  However it has been since January - and  other, lesser quaility, DVD's have been released with lightning speed.  Is there anywhere we can find out when ""Sisters"" will be out?
I had taped a few episodes and the other day I watched ""Some Tuesday in July"". Evan, Georgie's son, was diagnosed with cancer and her husband, John, gave up his dream of singing to support the family..the last scene where John, dressed in his business suit on his way to work, holding Evan in the hospital room and singing to him is one of those heartfelt moments that made ""Sisters"" so great.
It seems so much in the media today has gone astray - this show did address addiction, alcoholism, betrayl...but it wasn't screaming and raw and  ""in your face"" like so many shows are today.  It still showed character and kindness in the midst of struggles.
So - please - release it soon!",1215475200,57,979,4.446927374301676

3303306,5,B0011UO8XI,"I have 5 sisters (yes, we are 6!) and we used to LOVE watching this show with our Mom (God rest her soul) who was an only child.  Our favorite quote is when the Mom character tells the sisters ""The men in your life may leave you, children grow up, parents pass away. The only ones who are there for you, from cradle to grave, are your sisters.""  We made it our own and have been saying ""cradle to grave"" as our goodbye in emails, at then end of phone calls, a whisper in the ear during a hug goodbye.  I'm even going to get a license plate holder with that tagline.  I can't wait for this show to come out on DVD.  We're gonna buy it for sure!",1205971200,7,643,3.953488372093023

I could only remember bits and pieces because most of the time I was in bed when the show came on so I saw only a little pieces of the show once in a while. I came across it at the aol site and watched everyone of the episodes with in a week. I love this show. They actually have an image available and I think you can buy the show already. I went to the warner brothers website and searched it and it gave me a link to a website that said ""buy now"" its $250, but as a college student I might have to wait until amazon gets it and maybe it will be a little bit cheaper.

8242498,5,B0011UO8XI,"I watched very little primetime during the 1990s, but when I would be out with friends on a saturday night, I made a point of programming the machine for Sisters. I can't understand how a nauseating show like Thirtysomething gets a full release within a year of it hitting retail outlets, yet Sisters, which is a very well-written series has yet to be commercially viable. I just loved it. At the time, I also watched Melrose Place the first few seasons until they kept adding more & more new characters, at which point I no longer had any desire to carry on with it. It was changing into a show I barely recognized. In contrast, Sisters never lost sight of its focal point. The series was always tops with me. My friend once asked which was my favorite (Melrose or Sisters) & I told him. He was quite surprised by my answer. But really, a choice between the two... no contest. Sisters by a mile. Now if only we don't have to wait another decade before it's officially released.",1359244800,,978,4.4692737430167595

I agree with ALL the posts >>>with the trash that is now showing , why is a quality series like ""Sisters"" not released ? or is that the answer to the question ? It would show the current shows up to be what they are : superficial and exagerrated dramas full of sound and visual effects and very little acting .
I grew up with this series and would love to re-live it.",1353024000,,500,3.911764705882353
