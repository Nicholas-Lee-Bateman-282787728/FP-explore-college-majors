1377678,4,B00004YS97,"I first caught ""The St. Francisville Experiment"" at the Los Angeles Independent Film Festival.  What an exhilirating ride! Sort of a Blair Witch Project meets Scooby Doo Mysteries meets MTV's Real World, there are some things caught on film that we (the viewers) aren't sure should have been?  (Lest we upset any sensitive spirits?)  Still, the ""reality"" in this film makes for great fright and fun. Overall, MUCH more satisfying than the Blair Witch Project, and following in the vein of favorite ""Survivor,"" ""Road Rules,"" and ""Real World"" reality shows, this one outdoes them all ... Special kudos to Paul Palmer and Madison Charap whose vulnerability as ""participants"" adds to the fun.",971740800,4,688,5.125

1377691,2,B00004YS97,"I tried to sit through this one. I really did. And I've made it through some pretty terrible movies. The only ""scary"" parts are some really cheap jump scares that build up way too much tension before hand and absolutely ruins them. I really don't like most of the cast. Tim is really the only redeeming character simply because he is constantly cracking jokes and not taking it seriously. Ryan is so overactive it's painful to watch. Every scary moment is outshined by her whining and crying. The other female is so absorbed in her seances and prayers that it gets incredibly annoying. I made it over halfway through, but not to the end, so maybe there was an ending that paid off, but I didn't see it.",1501977600,,702,4.4921875

You never see anything only the usual chairs and doors moving, people being dragged by nothing. It could have been an interesting movie but the characters just run from one room to the next. Then they do what all bad horror movie characters do, separate for some reason. Hidden doors, holes in the floor with objects in them and the usual roaches/mice.

The two girls were annoying a lot of the time especially Ryan and Paul taking forever to get in the room was also a waste of time, but most other parts were enjoyable.

Maybe partially due to the numerous clunkers I've been watching on prime lately (that I can't even seem to watch through to the end) but this flick kept me interested! It could have used a tad better character development, and LESS dialogue from the ditzy ""medium"" (if you can call her that), but overall, it was watchable, and even, dare I say, entertaining most of the time!!

I guess I expected that they would be a bit more professional...but why?  it's a movie after al!, right?  and they did seem young.  good actors.

Lastly, you have your frat boys, whose so-called looks are to bring in the female viewers.  They try to act the ""big bad macho"" in the beginning but as it goes on, they are s***ting themselves over rats and a bump here or there.

Spirits or perhaps demons can leave scratch marks on your body because some of them are made of a fire that you can't see.  Some just touch you and make their presence known.  Some have the ability to make noises or close doors, but not much more than that.  Some spirits or demons (which most if not all are) can take possession or you can be demonically influenced.  If a true possession does occur or someone demonically influenced they have the ability to read minds, or foresee a possible future out of unlimited outcomes.

I love this history behind the story Madam Delphine LaLuarie. which I found out years later was true after watching American Horror Story Coven. It is definitely your normal found footage. You gather some kids together and throw them in haunted house. I found all the characters to be a little annoying, but other than that I loved it. It's kinda cheesy, but I can deal with that.

1377816,3,B00004YS97,"Had a good background, set with true stories and legends (Madame LaLaurie and her house on Royal St), as well as the Paranormal Expert (Troy Taylor).  In that aspect, it was a lot like the Blair Witch Project, with a real legend.  Additionally, it seems, according to my research, that the ""actors,"" including Mr. Taylor, were real people who had no idea that they were going to be in a set-up, unlike the BWP, where they were really actors, but didn't know what was going to happen.  That made a lot of the early action and their reactions very realistic, but according to my sources, the early ""paranormal activity"" wasn't enough for the production  company, so the later activity, especially the ""cleansing"" in the dark house, was shot later, after the four ""actors"" were brought back, and was edited in.

St. Francisville is the site of a lot of supposed haunted locations, most notably the Myrtles Plantation, and the movie gets 3 stars for the realistic legend and setting, but loses the 2 stars for the poor acting in the set-up scenes.",1421625600,,1043,4.708791208791209

1377845,2,B00004YS97,"""I feel more afraid of my own fears than anything else."" - Actual quote from the movie.

Four dumb kids go into a house that might be haunted. One is the ""team leader."" I don't know what that even means in the context of this movie. One is the token douchebag. He provides the first ""scare"" of the movie by seemingly disappearing and then jumping out to shout ""Boo!"" when the others start to worry. The team leader thinks that ""Dude, that is so funny."" One is a history major who doesn't know the history behind the house. All teams of ghost hunters need one of those. Rounding up the group is my favorite, an overly-sensitive psychic who prefaces all of her lines with ""guys..."" or ""I feel..."" and a whining tone. They are given psuedo-scientific ghost-finding gear none of them have any experience with.
Like the Blair Witch Project this movie so blatantly rips off, there seems to be no end of improvised dialogue here. If you loved BWP and aren't bothered by rip-offs, you might want to give this a go. It slowly builds a kind of creepy atmosphere as long as you can tolerate the annoying psychic character. And if you're in the right mood, this movie can provide its fair share of unintentional laughs. The St. Francisville Experiment is a bad movie, but it's not wholly unwatchable.",1417651200,,1288,4.575757575757576
1377846,4,B00004YS97,"Funny thing I didn't remember watching it, when I rolled over the movie, still in my watchlist it gave me the option to resume. Oooh, ok so I resumed. Tim was just getting ready to look under the bed. Right away I had that squinting eyes,slightly looking away don't look under the bed feeling. As I am watching Tim and the mystery with his room and the secret hallway. I have to admit I jumped. That one scene made me go all the way back to the very beginning and rewatch this movie.

Then I remembered it,

The acting wasn't horrible, though both actresses annoyed me. At different times mind you, but still both girls really got under my skin. The guys weren't as bad and I think the females worked better with male counterparts. But all in all the cast weren't horrible. I've seen worse.
I loved the back story, I thought it was a brilliant idea and it does leave it open for the movie to be redone or just for something to be done based on this storyline, or if it is an original N.O. legend then someone should open up that pandora's box. You never hear of a woman being a sick sadistic slave owner from those days and I am sure their were plenty. But someone so vile and evil that a mob of white people were gathering to arrest or just hang her?.. Had to be pretty severe.  I wouldn't want to see a movie about this woman alive. I'd only be able to stomach her (and that is hard to do) evil spirit haunting her macabre home.

Not for this flick. I think it was well made, and had enough flaws in it for the viewer to believe they were college kids doing this for the first time and not seasoned professionals.

1377882,5,B00004YS97,"I am a sixth generation Louisianan and have been completely infatuated with the state's many ghost stories and rich supernatural lore my entire life.  While this movie is intended as a work of fiction, there are many truths to it's background that merit noting.  Madame LaLaurie was indeed a real person and the narrative provided at the start of the movie is 100 percent accurate down to the address on Royal where her grand home burned thus revealing her horrific pastimes. In fact, the truth of her cruelty is much more dark and if you are into this kind of research, you should look her up.  Madame arrived from France with her two homely daughters, or so often reported as such, the wife of a mid-level diplomat and promptly set up a stately household as if she were the queen herself.  It is also true that her whereabouts after that fateful fire were unknown but most believe she actually fled back to France where she would enjoy immunity, of the law at least.  It was thought for a while that she may have taken shelter for some time at one of the plantation homes featured in the movie, namely the St. Francisville Inn where the bulk of the interior scenes were filmed.  It was thought when the movie first came out that the Myrtles hosted filming but that was false.  Actually, the two homes used in the movie are both reputed to be haunted, especially the St. Francisville Inn.  (But if you really want a guaranteed scare, stick to the Myrtles!)  Many a fruitful ghost hunt have been conducted on such premises but none to the extent enjoyed in this film  If you are looking for a good old fashioned scary tale, this one delivers when you know the background but if you are searching for a stylized high budget slick flick, then you will be disappointed.  I for one love this movie and own it on VHS...caveman format alas...and truly enjoy watching it again every so often, especially Madison's last solo scene.  Good fun in my opinion, especially knowing the history of LaLaurie's atrocities.  The main flaw to me is the idea that the preyed upon would haunt her sanctuary when it's well know in the Big Easy that the Royal house is where the horror happened.",1405900800,,2172,4.56701030927835

1377899,4,B00004YS97,"You have to go way back to the early days of the found footage genre for The St. Francisville Experiment, which emerged in 2000, just a year after The Blair Witch Project put this type of filmmaking on the map.  It is, of course, difficult to follow in the immediate footsteps of the phenomenon that was Blair Witch (just like at how incredibly crappy the official sequel was), but I think The St. Francisville Experiment hit on a pretty good formula.  The film starts out as a documentary of sorts, where we meet the main characters and get the historical context of the experiment, which culminates in a group of four young people spending the night in what is reputed to be one of the most haunted of houses in the most haunted of towns.  That historical context, it must be noted, does come from the actual annals of history.  The name Marie Delphine LaLaurie doesnt conjure up the anything fearful for most people these days, but this prominent New Orleans socialite of the early 19th century more than earned a spot on the list of most depraved serial killers by torturing and killing an unknown number of slaves.  Her crimes tended to be exaggerated as the years went by, but the woman was truly one sick puppy.

Only when an aged cook Madam LaLaurie had chained to the kitchen stove attempted to kill herself by starting a fire were this serial killers dark secrets discovered  in the form of several slaves found horribly mutilated and tortured  yet still alive.  Soon thereafter, a mob of people, incensed at LaLauries brutal treatment of her slaves, violently attacked the residence.  LaLaurie herself, unfortunately, managed to escape the mob and most likely made her way to Paris (no one really knows where she went or what happened to her).  Purely for the purposes of this movie, though, it is rumored that she actually settled in St. Francisville, Louisiana.  That sets the stage for the story.

Supposedly, this was originally supposed to be a real documentary about the investigation of a real haunted house, which explains why real ghost hunter Troy Taylor turns up to demonstrate the different pieces of ghost hunting equipment the designated investigators will use.  Somewhere along the line, though, that original idea  for better or for worst  was scrapped.  Enter the four young people chosen to participate in this experiment: Paul, looking to authenticate some of his own ghostly encounters; Tim, the film student who is basically there for the filmmaking experience; Ryan, a female history student who gets spooked easily; and Madison, a psychic and true believer who feels it is her mission to free the ghosts residing in the house.  The acting is surprisingly good overall for such a low-budget film (250 grand), and the interplay between characters feels natural.  A lot of viewers find Madison annoying; she can be loud, she talks a lot, and shes always going on about white light and protecting themselves.  Shes really the only person who takes the whole investigation seriously (and appreciates the possible dangers) from the beginning, though, so it makes sense to me that she would behave the way she does.

The movie never really generates any real scares, but it does have its creepy moments (as well as one unforgettably gross scene)  and it doesnt screw up everything that came before with a lame ending.  I do hope that folks will look past all of the one-star reviews and at least give The St. Francisville Experiment a chance.  Ive watched  and enjoyed  it twice now, and Im pretty sure Ill watch it again sometime in the not too distant future.

The flighty new age girl. The ""I'm scared"" horror victim girl....you can tick off the tropes as the movie progresses. It's obvious that the film makers saw Blair Witch and said ""We can do that, and make a ton of money doing it!""

There's a few isolated moments of creepiness, mostly because of the atmosphere. However by the end, even those moments fall apart quickly, and we're left with screaming college students who don't even manage to actually sound really afraid.

I spun around thinking it was my partner trying to scare me, but no one was there and he was sound asleep. He woke up and turned on the light and asked me what happened to my shoulder. I looked in the mirror and there was the perfect outline of a handprint where I felt someone grab me.

If you have relatives or friends under the age of 14, give them a video camera and turn them loose in a dark house after instructing them to ""make a scary movie."" I guarantee you, they will make a more frightening film than this 77-minute wad of bad-intentions-gone-worse piece of drek. It's hard to determine what's worse in this movie-- the acting or the production values.

No one enjoys a good horror film more than I, and no one enjoys a BAD horror film more than I, but the ""St. Francisville Experiment"" is neither. It's a shameless, moronic ""Blair Witch"" ripoff that will make you wonder just how embarrassed you can be simply by watching TV.",1161216000,2,752,4.522058823529412

She finally takes a bite or two and pretends she has taken the roach into her mouth....but you never actually she it as she pretends to take it out and toss it across the room.  Then, of course screams her lungs out.  The whole movie is like this.  The fireplace seen is even funnier with her.

1377983,2,B00004YS97,"You have to love a good ghost story to enjoy ""The St. Francisville Experiment,"" a rehash of the immensely popular ""Blair Witch Project"" which came out the year before in 1999. Both films are pseudo documentaries filmed by annoying youngsters who set out to crack the mystery of ominous old legends. In both cases, the kids start their respective expeditions confident and self-assured, hand-held cameras jerking about while they spout wisecracks at the nearest shadows. Eventually, the kids end up terrified, surrounded by supernatural forces they could never have imagined.

I consider ""The Blair Witch Project"" to be a modern-day horror classic, well acted and perfectly executed. It frightened me, and I enjoyed the fact that the monsters could never quite be seen. The filmmakers caught lightning in a bottle, and when they released its fiercely mediocre sequel a couple of years later, it was apparent the magic was gone.

There is some magic in ""The St. Francisville Experiment,"" but it is still inferior to ""The Blair Witch Project"" in almost every way. The acting is forced, the locale at a supposed haunted house in Louisiana is only slightly eerie, and the conclusion is never believable. And yet there's a scene, when a ghostly specter makes an appearance, that will definitely give you the creeps. It's all fun, and perhaps the young at heart will get a kick out of this carnival ride.

Four kids, including a filmmaker, historian, psychic and the obligatory ""team leader,"" decide to spend the night in a haunted house. Prior to the big bash, the history of the house is documented. Somehow, and none too convincingly, they connect the house's history with the infamous New Orleans' legend of Madame LaLaurie. An 1830s Creole socialite who lived in the French Quarter, her house supposedly burned down and discovered within was a torture chamber where she conducted hideous experiments on slaves. She fled New Orleans in the middle of the night and, according to this film, eventually holed up in the secluded St. Francisville home.

The Madame LaLaurie legend, the Grand Guignol of New Orleans ghost stories, has never been convincingly proven, though it has been recited for over 100 years. I actually enjoyed the fact that ""The St. Francisville Experiment"" attempted to connect its story with this most famous of urban legends. The tale is as creepy as the set-up for ""The Blair Witch Project,"" and unlike the latter film, the legend is at least partially based on fact.

The kids arrive in the middle of the night, enter the house and begin exploring its interior. The house is certainly authentic, but it's apparent that at least someone arrives on a regular basis to dust and clean its interior. But never mind. Closets are explored, a seance is conducted and a chair flies across the attic - and it all works for the most part. My problem at this point is the growing fear of the actors. Their hyperventilating terror is never convincing and it is abundantly clear they are mimicking the very good performances from ""The Blair Witch Project."" Additional secrets are discovered, including hidden chambers, but I realized I could have just as well bought a ticket to a Halloween funhouse for the same scares.

The beauty of ""The Blair Witch Project"" was that during its frantic running time, there was never a moment of doubt. Certainly the documentary was fabricated, but it was always convincing. I was never convinced by ""The St. Francisville Experiment."" Had the filmmakers spent a bit more time with their idea, they could have struck a nerve. There is always something unsettling about an old abandoned house, similar to what was seen during the final moments of ""The Blair Witch Project."" But the house used in this film, even with its hidden chambers and old furniture, looks like a display at the local museum.

It took a great amount of skill and imagination to pull off ""The Blair Witch Project."" There were so many missteps that could have been taken. None were. ""The St. Francisville Experiment"" lumbers around and makes these very mistakes. We see chains falling, chairs flying and ghosts hovering within mirrors. I liked the ghost, but the film leaves little to the imagination, and thus its authenticity is compromised. For a low budget flick such as this, that is a mistake.",1107216000,17,4308,4.933793103448276
1377984,2,B00004YS97,"The success of ""The Blair Witch Project"" in 1999 virtually assured a few other people would rush out, with video cameras firmly in hand, in an attempt to ride a similar wave to fame and fortune. Who can blame them? The two guys who made ""Blair Witch"" laughed all the way to the bank, I think, although I don't know how much they made off the film. I suspect the people responsible for ""The St. Francisville Experiment"" didn't necessarily laugh as much as they chuckled faintly to the nearest money lending institution. You see, this film is a blatant rip-off of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" right down to real people playing themselves as the characters, an ancient ghostly presence haunting a location (in this case a house), and the final ""horrific"" denouement as the characters encounter something definitely not of this world. The best thing about ""Blair Witch"" wasn't the film itself but the absolutely chilling pseudo-documentary that aired on the Sci-Fi Channel before the film arrived in theaters. ""The St. Francisville Experiment"" tries something similar by telling us the history of who supposedly haunts the house.

According to the slightly interesting introductory segment, the spirit of Madame LaLaurie has been causing quite a stir. Who is Madame LaLaurie? Some lady who tortured slaves back in the nineteenth century before disappearing after a fire exposed her nefarious crimes to society. Yeah, that Madame LaLaurie. The movie fills us in on all the gory details just so we know the ghost of this infernal creature could cause a lot of nasty problems for those sticking their noses where they don't belong. Then we get on to the movie, as four annoying dimwits set off to investigate a house supposedly haunted by this spirit--or something like that. The characters include a psychically sensitive woman named Madison Charap, the team leader Paul Cason, ""videographer"" Tim Thompson, and a female historian named Ryan Larson. All of these young people go trooping into this house with a bunch of food, cameras, and other necessary equipment to capture their experiences. They also go in at night since we all know ghosts will never, ever come out during daylight. Locked inside for the night, the team must wander around the house and record their impressions. They don't get started right away because they have to spend a lot of time mooning around in the first room they enter.

Nonetheless, weird stuff starts happening after awhile. Anything you can think of associated with a haunting turns up in this movie. You've got cold spots, voices, noises, bangings, and doors opening and closing. You also get chains falling out of chimneys, bloodstained tools found in a chest in the basement, something sinister wrapped up in a cloth in an armoire, and the famous chair flying across the room. The chair scene alone seems to consume an enormous amount of screen time, as the four researchers must hover around the camera to rewatch the chair moving under its own power, talk about the spiritual implications of such a disturbing incident for what feels like hours, and then must go back up to the attic where the whole thing took place. We even see a bug crawling out of someone's sandwich and a cat jumping out to scare everyone senseless. The conclusion to the film sees all four split up for their own personal encounters with the spirits plaguing this house. Are all of these events related to a sinister spiritual manifestation? Sure they are since this film claims that everything we see is the absolute, irrefutable, uncontested truth. Who are we to argue otherwise? More importantly, who are YOU to argue otherwise?

Very little works in ""The St. Francisville Experiment"" beyond the nifty chair gag and perhaps selected segments of the ending. Let's begin and end with the four airheads involved in the ""experiment."" Other viewers are correct in asserting that Madison Charap, she of the white light and other crackpot bunkum, is assuredly the most annoying human being presently living on this mortal coil. Move over, Meg Ryan. Step aside, Britney Spears. Hit the road, Mariah Carey. There's a new sheriff in town and her name is Madison Charap. That grating tone, that constant intonation to surround oneself with white light, that emphasis on feeling what's going on around oneself; these are the things uttered by this raven haired dipstick that had me reaching for a heavy yet easily tossed object. Sadly, none of the other three present a viable alternative to Charap's dithering. Ryan shrieks and screams so much I thought her foot was caught in a bear trap. The two male members of the crew are nothing compared to the two prancing clowns named Larson and Charap. I would like to personally thank the ghosts for tormenting these four yucks. Rest in peace now, spirits; you have done well. Move toward the light!

The most significant liability in ""The St. Francisville Experiment"" is the performances, but the house itself isn't all that scary. When the young people walked in, I expected a grungy, dingy, spooky atmosphere--and what we see is a fully furnished house replete with furniture, draperies, fully made beds, and a working electrical system. I kept expecting the residents to come in the front door from a night out demanding to know why these people were poking around their abode. Since the whole ""film"" is supposedly true in every way, it's nice the distributors included a batch of trailers for other real life films like ""Crocodile,"" ""Octopus,"" and ""Storm of the Century."" We also get a little featurette on how to conduct your own ghost hunting expedition. The only ghosts I will try to exorcize in the near future are the memories of this film.",1097539200,8,5693,4.927083333333333

 And St. Francisville was a fun film. There were actually some very good (and frightful) moments. The chair flying across the room, for one. The people who are upset that B.W. and ST.

It was entertaining, and it had a couple moments that were so eerie, so creepy as to induce goosebumps. yes, the end is a bit of a letdown, but the initial chills were fun. If you can watch this little piece of atmosphere alone, in a dark room, without getting that feeling--you know...that cold dread of fear at the base of the spine...as it slowly moves upward, the hair on your arms stands up, the skin begins to crawl, the heart beats a bit harder, now there is definately a creeping,cold chill...like dead fingers brushing at the base of your skull washing over you and your no longer sure that you WANT to see whats in the attic, or in that closet...or what might be hidden, behind those old clothes, in that hole in the wall,--at least once...well, my friend, you are officially jaded. too bad for you!

 This is a well done ghost/haunted house story. Lots of atmosphere and tension, could have used more subtlty for realism, but oh well. The ending is fun, albeit a tad cheezy, and a nice little capper for the story. For those of you who were angry at the BWP for not showing you the MONSTA (which i can't understand, by the way.

In the days of all the other cheesy horror flicks.....can we say Nightmare on Elm St?.....this one truly takes the cake for being a true horror flick.  Granted, it follows in the footsteps of Blair Witch, but at least the actors in this movie do not show up in the Steak and Shake comercials.  This movie explores the true possibilities of the after-life by not revealing a sketchpad monster but yet leads you to make up you own conclusion on who or what is in the mansion.  Many people have experienced paranormal experiences in their life and this movie in my opinion shows what some of those experiences could materialize as.  From the shackles in the fireplace, to the chair in the attic, to the mirror in the bedroom, I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie.  And the fact that it takes place in such a historic area of our country adds to the spook element.  Whether or not this documentary was real or staged, they did one hell of a believable job.  I mean if I were in the house I'm not sure if I would materialize as ""all knowing"" Madison, or ""cry-baby"" Ryan, or steriotypical ""macho men"" Paul and Tim whose sarcastic comments cover the fact that they are scared ****less.  This is definitely one movie that I never tire of.  Every time a friend comes over that has not seen the movie, it's number one on the playlist for the evening.

The plot basically centers on four college age kids who spend, or attempt to spend a night in a St. Francisville plantation.  These four are:  Madison, Paul, Tim, and Ryan.  By the way, Madison is psychic.  After an informational beginning, in which the true story of Madame Lalaurie is told, we finally came to the house.  While exploring the house, some very interesting things happen.  A chadelier falls as the team leaves an anonymous room.  The ghost is obviously a fan of Phantom of the Opera.  Then while in the attic a light mysteriously flickers, and a chair hurls itself across the attic. Creepy.  After an interesting Ouija board session with a spirit named Charlie, and a few cold spots and closing doors, Madison decides the team should cleanse the house.  With the ""white light of heaven"" no less.  Unfortunately some of the spirits of the house aren't to happy about this, included a tortured slave, and supposedly Madame Lalaurie herself. (gasp)
You'll have to watch the movie to find out if the team escapes.
This is one of my favorite horror films of all time, mainly because I am one of those silly people who have trouble deciding whether or not the movie was real.  At any rate Madison's new world psychic crap certainly makes her character believable.  The other characters, if they are actors, certainly portray fear well.

Do you honestly think it wouldn't have been found?) had me groaning out loud.  But quite honestly, that last ""cleansing ritual"" made me sit up and take notice, from the point where Madison's candle blew out onwards.  Tim's succession of doors, the ghost in the mirror, Madison covered in blood and screaming in terror, I felt all of those scenes were nicely done.  Is this one of the great haunted house movies?

SFE is a lot like sitting around and telling scary stories during a sleepover. All it is really, is a device that is trying to spook you. Let yourself go and you stand a great chance of being freaked out by this movie. I know I was.
The story is simple. Take ""Blair Witch,"" cut the general plot and characters (plus a few more) and paste the whole deal into a haunted house. Add minimal FX and wash, rinse, repeat.
The best difference between SFE and BWP is that SFE feels like there is some design to the way it was made. It feels produced, but scarier because it wasn't made by some kids in the forest who don't know the first thing about suspense (or in their case, improvisation).

While it stated in the beginning that it is all real, there were moments when I believed it, and many moments when I didn't. For instance, Madison, the so-called psychic was so overdramatic and seemed like she was reading lines off a cue card.

You can buy those things at K-Mart, so that was a give away that it was all staged.

I love how those cameras the actors are carrying always seem to fall in the perfect position when they are dropped - filming that bug in ths sandwhich, filming that kid getting dragged away, filming their own faces perfectly in the center of the screen.

The three actors in Blair Witch were so convincing that you thought the footage was real.  One of the four actors in St. Francisville was soooooo bad that it was obviously a movie you were watching.  Regardless of the some terrible acting and a not-so satisfying ending, the movie does a good job creating some tension.  Definitely more satisfying than a lot of bigger budget movies with name stars, so it's worth watching and you can garner your own opinion.",1013126400,2,547,4.608247422680412

I have some psychic abilities and I know that using them can be scary. My heart went out to all the people in the movie! This is a gotta-see movie if you are into ghosts and haunted houses.

After watching this movie I can honestly say that I was angry.  Not because the movie tries to gimmick itself as real, not because the actors and dialogue are lame, not even because the movie is just bad, but because it was such a lackluster production that was probably whipped together in month to ride on the Blair Witch Project coat tails.
It is a blatant rip-off that does not even try to impress the viewer.  That is the most unforgivable thing about this movie.

1378052,4,B00004YS97,"The comparisons between this film and BW are inevitible; they go with the same general idea of a small band of young people exploring a paranormal experience. What made this movie much better for me than Blair Witch was believeability. Whereas the plot, acting, and interactions in BW were all very bad in my opinion, this movie scared the bejesus out of me. A sign of a good scary movie is that it will affect you after you finish watching it, looking over your shoulder. I laughed through most of BW and that was seeing it in a theater. TSFP on the other hand, I watched at home by myself, and I had to have a light on. I do not scare very easily, and the only thing that does make me go into the whole ""fight or flight"" adrenaline-pumping frightened mode is real stories and videos of ghosts. While a few of the events and the too perfect selection of people tips you off that this really is just a movie, the actors and interactions are just real enough to leave you questioning whether or not it could possibly be real. Also I'd like to say I thought the actors did a wonderful job portraying who they did, and I believed them through the movie. Whereas I laughed when the girl was talking into the camera in BW, I felt really frightened and sympathetic for the ""psychic"" in the one ""mirror"" scene (If you watch it, you'll know which one I mean.). Probably what also helped this was I didn't know whether it was real or not at the beginning. That's the one edge BW should have had, but never did because of the media hype that surrounded it. Even with that, I felt TSFP was far superior in many ways and on what had to be an even smaller budget. In fact the only thing that keeps it from 5 stars is mearly the first thing that happens and the ending, otherwise a great scary movie, perfect for scaring yourself senseless on Holloween if you can't find a haunted house of your own to visit.",1003708800,2,1894,4.30812324929972

""The St. Francisville Experiment"" obviously used a group of unknown actors...probably unknown because of their acting abilities.  However, the story behind the film is accurate...the stories behind some of the local plantations have been scaring the bejeebers out of me for years.  It would have been nice, though, if a little bit more money had been put into the film to help the events seem a little more realistic.

The only reason i rented this cheeeesy movie was because my friend hyped me up about it saying , "" the scariest movie i have ever seen! Better than the blair witch!"" now i saw the blair witch w/this particular friend and i must say it freaked me out, so to hear him say this about the movie got me thinkin. If it was possible to get the time i wasted back after watching this movie, i would.  The actors who are supposedly ""real people"" are fake and boring. The 4 characters are 1 physcic named Madison, 1 history major Ryan (girl), 1 team leader chicken Paul and 1 goofy cameraman Tim. While watching the first 15 min you get a feeling of the Blair witch w/ many interviews w/ local people and directors and what not. The house if supposedly haunted by a women in the 1800's who mutilated many of her salves. She then escaped a mob and then supposedly hid in the st. francisville house where she did even more gruesome acts. It sounded like a pretty intersting plot i must say.
At the time the gang reaches the house you have about 55 minutes left. I couldn't understand what they could do for 55 min when the first 15 min felt like 1 hour.  The group gets in, the only way out if the front door. the windows and the rest of the doors are locked tight. They make camp in the front living room. and start a HOUSE WARMING party. they pray to the house, "" we come in peace, and are protected by the white light."" If i ever hear a person say WHITE LIGHT again i might die.  After this they go throught rooms where every closet has a sound, but only have cats jumpin out of them.

First of all the legend itself is really eerie, and I think I have heard of Madame Levay (sp?). The idea of the torture chamber, and the shackles and all that hidden room jazz just combines to spell fREAKY!!
Watch closely or you will miss the best parts of the film.
I really liked the humour in this movie as well, I found myself laughing and laughing at the wisecracks of the guys.
And if the characters are farmiliar: the dumb blonde, the flaky psychic, the macho guys, then remember that we are not talking about an Oscar flick here, its a straight to video meant merely to entertain.

Upon further investigation the fire fighters discovered the attic where other servants were being tortured in ways to disturbing to mention here. Madame LaLaurie fled in her carriage and noone is quite sure where she went. I believe this part of the story to be the truth...it's the rest of the story that I have my doubts about. The basic premise of the movie is that the house in St. Francesville became the new home to the LaLaurie family and is haunted by the spirits of the tourtured souls there. So, hey, let's take 4 strangers and throw them in there with some high tech equipment and see if they survive the night. Some of the events in the house seem obviously planned and the psychic spends too much time trying to convince her teammates that she is a psychic.

The middle with the amateur ghostbusters  exploring the haunted house is at best preposterous. The ending is rushed and offers few answers.

1378082,2,B00004YS97,"When I rented this DVD, I found myself laughing more than screaming.  Of course, I wasn't really expecting anything more than a ""Blair Witch"" rip-off, which is what it was.
I think what made the movie particularly funny was the fact that it tried to pass the events off as real, even though it was obviously set up.  Well, first of all, the characters, four twenty-somethings, were overly annoying.  You have your typical blonde ""Britney Spears""-type girl who screams and cries unnecessarily at everything, and the so-called ""psychic"" girl who wants to surround everything in a Bright White Light.  Really, she reminded me of Molly Shannon's character on ""Saturday Night Live""'s Goth Talk, which made it all the more hilarious.
And the two guys were typical you-have-an-opinion-you-must-be-on-your-period jerks.  I was almost rooting for the ghosts to put this foursome out of their misery.
The other thing that made this film unbelieveable was the fact that they sent four idiots to do a serious investigation.  Every time a simple draft or noise occurred, they jumped at shadows.  Seriously--you feed a group of young, idiotic people with ghost stories and put them in a supposedly haunted house all night to look for ghosts, and they're going to see something.  It's called group hysteria, which is a real thing.
Maybe if they hadn't tried to pass off the film as real it might have worked better for me.  As I said before, it was obviously set up.  I mean, first of all, that chandelier falls the first time they turn on a light switch--and half the time, they walk around the rooms with flashlights, mysteriously forgetting about a little thing called electricity.
I mean, the whole movie is just so cheesey that it's ridiculous.  The ending is particularly hokey, but I'm not going to give it away in case you decide to watch it.
I think the only real interesting part is the story about that society matron in New Orleans, and about what she did to her servants.  That was a genuinely creepy story.
The rest of the movie, however, is pretty much a joke.  Cheap laughs at best.",980812800,9,2083,4.8011204481792715

They wouldn't send 4 people into a supposedly haunted house, and leave them alone for the night.  But just to throw that out there, who cares if it's not real, it's entertainment value.
Anyways, about the movie.  Albeit, a little short, and slow at the beginning, once they get into the house, the blood starts to run cold and the scares begin.  I'm not saying this is the best movie, nor the worst.  But the laughs at the comments by the actors, and the scares that this movie provides, is more than worth the sluggish start.  I don't care what anyone says about this movie, it's worth watching.  The Blair Witch, although having a better backstory, and the hype factor, didn't live up to what we expected.  Personally, I enjoyed the ending of this movie over the Blair Witch, because things actually happen, you actually see things happening.  Instead of strange noises, and jumpy cameras, you actually see things happening.  And the end is quite freaky.
While not the best of movies, I definitely recommend you people to watch it once, and then decide on yourselves if you liked it.  Don't take what all these people here who obviously have no sense of imagination and fun, ruin it for you people.  See it yourselves.
