7929823,5,B0000525JN,"In this second volume of Sailor Moon Season 1, we are introduced to two characters that will be with us until the end. This tape contains two episodes which further along the season story arch, making it an important part of your collection!

Episode 5: Computer School Blues - 1st Appearance of Amy (Sailor Mercury). In this episode, a new girl (Amy) shows up to school. Most of the students gossip about her since she's so smart. Luna senses something about her and suspects Amy is a monster from the Negaverse. However, as Serena begins befriending Amy, Jedite's true plot is revealed and before the day is out, Sailor Moon will have a new ally in the form of the revived sailor scout, Sailor Mercury.

Episode 6: Time Bomb - Now having to deal with 2 sailor scouts, Jedite continues his attempts to gain energy for Queen Beryl and the Negaverse. New alarm clocks cause people to rush around town, exerting energy. Serena is affected and with the help of Amy, the two scouts face down Jedite's newest monster. One thing to note is that Luna gives Amy her Mercury computer, which will be used throughout the rest of the series. Overall, one of the more amusing filler episodes.

Episode 7: An Uncharmed Life - 1st Appearance of Raye (Sailor Mars). Girls who visit the local temple are disappearing! When Serena and Amy check it out, they meet the beautiful young priestess, Raye Hino. Little does Raye realize that Jedite is working for her grandfather, kidnapping local girls with a bus. When Serena and Raye are trapped with the other girls, Luna discovers that Raye is more than she seems! Introducing Sailor Mars!

Episode 8: Nightmare in Dreamland - Now, with three sailor scouts activated, the young girls get together and visit the new theme park. This episode really presents the relationship between Serena and Raye, who are constantly bickering about one thing or another. A decent filler episode.",1104192000,7,1909,4.793313069908814
7929824,4,B0000525JN,"This video is a collection of episodes 5-8 from the first season of the TV series.  There are no special features or anything, just episodes 5-8 back to back to back to back with the beginning and ending songs before and after each episode.  If you missed the first season (Like me) I'm sure you'll enjoy seeing the episodes in which the Sailor Scouts first became...well, the Sailor Scouts, and seeing the Scouts' first enemy, Queen Beryl and her evil henchmen, who want to suck energy from the people of earth.  Here is basically what each episode is about:

Computer School Blues: A new girl starts going to Serena's school.  Serena's classmates think the girl, Amy, is a nerd, and Luna thinks Amy is from the Negaverse.  But Amy is about to surprise them all...

Time Bomb: When a new clock store opens in the mall, everyone wants to buy one of the beautiful watches, or cute clocks.  But it seems like ever since they brought home their new clocks, they have been impatient, and pressed for time.  One of those people being the normally lazy Serena!

An Uncharmed Life: Raye Hino is a beautiful girl, who, along with her grandfather, is being blamed for buses disappearing near their temple.  But Raye claims she is not responsible for the missing buses, and seems to believe someone else is the cause of all the problems.  Luna seems to believe something else, too; something that will change Raye forever...

Nightmare in Dreamland: A new, candy-filled theme park has opened up near Serena.  Serena, a child at heart, can't contain herself once she's inside the cute park; but Luna insists that she focus on the fact that people have been disappearing at the park, and that it could be the doing of the Negaverse.",1098403200,2,1720,4.67109634551495
7929825,1,B0000525JN,This tape is not very good. Its all chopped up. All of the good parts are taken out. Why can't DIC leave it UNCUT. The Uncut version is so much better. It makes more sense to . So if you love Sailor Moon buy Sailor Moon season one uncut on DVD.If you go to ebay you can get episodes 1-200.,1058745600,3,289,3.8333333333333335
