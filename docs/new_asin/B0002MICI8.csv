2104726,3,B0002MICI8,"I am one of the few who actually love these two sequels, but I won't go into the plots or whatever, just tell you what is NOT included in these DVD's even though the listing (well the picture of the back of the case) say otherwise. On Halloween 4, there is NO Audio commentary with writer Alan B. McElroy and on Halloween 5 there is no Introduction by Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris. This is the second time I ordered something from Amazon where the listing's picture shows certain contents, but they are not there. I wish Amazon would UPDATE their stupid listings so I wouldn't have to waste my hard earned money. My pic of the back shows what is actually on the discs, and of course doesn't show the missing two features (which are not that special, but still, as a completest I was not happy).",1512086400,,799,4.405405405405405

So you get both films on separate discs for a decent price & at the same time it saves room. If you have a huge DVD collection like me you need to save as much room as possible & sets like this help a lot. Each disc is a special edition of the film & comes with special features as well

2104875,4,B0002MICI8,"everyone for the most part, loves the original Halloween. the second one gained a good fan base as well as the third one. but 4 and 5 are a real touchy subject for me at least. they both were the first Halloween films (from what I recall) I had seen on tv. I loved them, but now, re watching them..... idk there alright.

Halloween 4 the return. ok so this film is all about Jamie, a young girl who is related to Laurie from the first and second Halloween. I believe she is Laurie's daughter. she is taken in by a new family, Rachel is basically Laurie in this film, well she kind of plays the same roll. a baby sitter, to be stalked by killer lol. ok so Michael in this movie is after Jamie cause she is a relative of Laurie and I think, Jamie, is the last relative. but idk for sure. ok so this film leaves ite viewers in question, SPOILER WARNING!!!!!

why, did Jamie kill her mom in the end part. I will tell ya why, cause when she touched Michaels hand, she got some evil transferred into her. yup, no joke the Halloween films, are now containing elements of the supernatural. but wait a darned second, laurie had touched Michael in the first film, at least once. why is laurie not a killer clown. idk. plot hole is what I cal it I guess idk.

Halloween 5 never makes it clear, if she actually killed the mom. I mean we see flash baks of it, but then the nurse lady tells Jamie she will call her mother :/ huh. so idk, I guess Michael myers has the ability to posses, and the mom has the power to come back to life.

pleas forgive me if I totally did not make sense, and if I am wrong on any thing, you can correct me in the comments.",1402704000,,1639,4.080745341614906

2104894,4,B0002MICI8,"This pair of Halloween films centered around Michael Myer's niece, Jamie Lloyd, are definitely my favorite of the sequels. Halloween IV is the closest to the original with the dark, brooding scenery throughout Haddonfield. It features the very welcomed return of Donald Pleasence as Dr. Samuel Loomis. Also featuring the strong casting of Danielle Harris as Jamie Lloyd, and Ellie Cornell as the fan-favorite, Rachel Carruther. With chases throughout a foggy Halloween night, whether in the halls of a school, or the streets of Haddonfield, the action is almost always on. The film's pace is never altered, even when things seem calm as the lights go out in Haddonfield. This sequel seems to capture the essence of the original the best.

Halloween V is by far the campiest film in the series, and you can tell it is an 80s film. The zany style of Wendy Kaplan as ""Tina"", the camp music that plays around her, and the goofy cops helps to bring fun to the series. Counter-balancing the film's fun is the growing rage of Michael Myers, and Dr. Samuel Loomis. The latter had his script squandered to parts where he's reduced to repeating the same phrases throughout. You can tell this film is not the best in the series, and probably behind Halloween VI (theatrical cut) as the worst in the series - in terms of a coherent plot. As a bonus, Ellie Cornell makes a return!

The bonus features are fun, and show a behind the scenes look at the production, some interviews, and various information.",1343779200,,1491,4.7528957528957525
2104895,4,B0002MICI8,Now I Know Everyone Knows These Are Two Great Horror Ficks or at least in my opinion and a great improvment from Halloween 3. Now I was lucky and about a year ago bought this a Walmart for 5 dollars. It was a steal compared to the seventeen dollars now. I would still pay 17 dollars or buy them seperate because they're 5 dollars Cheaper. If your a Michael myers Fan or Just a horror fan in gerneral your gonna like these two classick flicks,1330646400,,441,4.2
2104896,3,B0002MICI8,product came fast and ordered new but the dvd inside was slidding around and gained a couple of scratches from the trip.,1324857600,,120,4.5
2104897,5,B0002MICI8,"Halloween 4 was a hit the momment in went in production and was told it was coming to theater.  Only a year later Direct to video brought us another good chapter in the series it brought us Halloween 5.  This is a perfect way to have two of the best films in a box set (2-DISC), the case is a normal DVD case with both disc seperate from each other.  If you enjoyed Halloween 1 and 2 you will love Halloween 4 and 5.

Halloween 4:  He has escaped and is after his 8 year old niece Jamie.  He stalks after her just as before in Halloween 1 and 2 with his sister.

Halloween 5: He is back yet again and he is mad.  The thought they killed him a year before and now he is hunting a little girl and everyone he comes in contact with.",1319500800,,729,3.9115646258503403
2104898,5,B0002MICI8,"I'm a big fan of the Halloween films, even the later no-so-good ones.  I love Michael Myers as a villian, who really set the standard for slasher flicks.  Halloween IV and V continue the battle between Dr. Loomis and Michael, and Michael's obsession with killing his family, in this case, his niece.  As you might imagine, Michael terrorizes the town of Haddonfield in both films, killing people left and right and stalking his victims, inspiring the same dread as ever.  Let's face it, either you like these sort of movies or you don't.

If you do, this doublepack is great if you don't yet have these films.  If you do have them, there isn't anything new on these films.",1318377600,,672,4.605042016806722
2104899,5,B0002MICI8,"Halloween has always ben my favorite horror movie since I was 3. These two especially. This involves Jamie. Jamie is a little girl going through life, but she is the niece of a deranged serial killer. I highly recommend these DVD's!",1304812800,,232,4.682926829268292
2104900,5,B0002MICI8,"Halloween 4: It's Halloween, 1988, and Michael Myers is back, this time to stalk the small daughter of now deceased Laurie Strode. Michael's niece is named Jamie, and she is now in the custody of a foster family, complete with a teenaged foster-sister, Rachel, whose friends make a nice selection of prey for the oncoming killer. Thankfully, Dr. Loomis survived the great fire of Halloween 2 as well, and he is hot on Michael's trail, as always.

Halloween 5: After the tragic turn of the previous film, little Jamie is now in a children's psychiatric hospital and mute, while Michael is back on the hunt for her. It's Halloween again, and Dr. Loomis is around as well, this time trying to use a psychic link Jamie has developed with her diabolical uncle to track and destroy the relentless shape of evil. But there is another sinister force present this time as well.

After the producers of the Halloween franchise begun by John Carpenter and Debra Hill attempted to take it in a new, anthology-style direction with Halloween 3, and commercially failed (though, frankly, I am one of the rare folks who love that one), it was decided to bring Michael Myers and Doctor Loomis back from the dead to do battle in a string of hopefully more successful sequels. And so, Halloween 4 through 6 carried out just that plan. Without Jamie Lee Curtis to play Laurie Strode, the series was given a new central victim/survivor girl in daughter Jamie, played magnificently by a very young Danielle Harris. Ellie Cornell played big sis Rachel, and of course, the great Donald Pleasence returned as Dr. Sam Loomis. The resulted Halloween 4, directed by Dwight H. Little, was actually a very good addition to the franchise. Watching it now without distraction for the first time in a long time, this is a pretty darn good slasher movie, a genre I often find tedious(I tend to prefer monsters to slashers). As mentioned before, Danielle Harris is an incredible little actress in both 4 and 5. It's a crime she hasn't been given more work in her career, especially since she not only was an adorable kid, but grew up to be absolutely gorgeous (and I'm not one of these longtime Danielle Harris obsessors who have had a crush on her since 1988, but it's hard not to fall in love with current Danielle while watching the bonus material on these discs and listening to her angelic voice on the commentaries). There is not much to complain about in Halloween 4, and one appreciates it all the more when listening to the commentary from its very capable writer, Alan B. McElroy, who even points out some places where the directing flubbed up things the writing had planned much better. Of course, what I really enjoy on the H4 disc bonus features is the Danielle Harris/Ellie Cornell commentary. I enjoy commentaries when I have time, because it's like watching the movie with someone else, and who wouldn't want to snuggle up and watch a movie with Danielle Harris? Yeah, I know, and this is just a new crush for me, ha. Anyway, the H4 disc serves up a fine set of bonuses with both commentaries, plus the trailer, a making of featurette, and discussion panel. Yeah, that's where Danielle first really started to get to me; such a cutie! Put her in more movies! If I ever get to make some Moonlight Motel flicks, Danielle, you're on my love-interest list, ha. Anyway, there was one complaint I did want to make about the film. Okay, I could make two, since it does seem ridiculous that Michael is fine now after having both eyes shot out, if I remember correctly, in Halloween 2, and that's ignoring the fiery explosion. But the thing that bugged me more in the otherwise very good Halloween 4 is that I didn't like the look of Michael. Gone was the William Shatner mask for a less appealing (in my opinion) white mask, and to me it was often quite obvious that he was wearing padding underneath his suit. Whenever that was painfully obvious to me, well, it just ruined it. Otherwise though, I have to admit really liking this film after giving it a chance again for the first time in a long time.

Halloween 5 takes place the following year, so basically, these films must have been made back to back (the surviving cast returns, too). However, gone is the suit padding that hurt part 4 for me, though I still miss the original mask and continued to in the subsequent films. These others just don't work for me. Anyway, 5 is an okay film. It's entertaining enough, and I fondly remember seeing this one in a theater on Halloween night as a very young teen. There are interesting new characters, and there's an underlying conspiracy plot of sorts. It's clear they are trying to do more with the concept here than allowing it to become just another collection of sequels about a guy going around killing people (which Halloween 8 sort of turns the franchise towards). The Shape is still out to get his last relative, so his drive is still there too. However, the problem with it is in its missed potential at continuing more directly with the twisted idea they ended the previous film with, which was more true to the original films and had a much more interesting theme of passing on the undying evil of Halloween. Instead, things go in a more hokey direction with 5, leaving part 6 to be just plain weird and yet easily forgettable. So, part 5, good, but could have and should have been a much better sequel. The cast is still great though. This time, it was directed by Dominique Othenin-Girard, and he also provides a commentary on the H5 disc with stars Danielle Harris and Jeffrey Landman (who plays a little boy sidekick of Jamie's) at his side. Also included are the trailer, a making-of, an on-set footage featurette, and intros from Danielle and Ellie. Now, one last thing about part 5. As I said, there is something darker going on in this film. A secret plot that in part 6 is unveiled to be something that in some ways puts me in mind of part 3, though in a less interesting way. Basically, a new character is introduced in Halloween 5. A mysterious stranger who has an important role in the film's ending. Many folks wonder who this character was supposed to be and feel it was never followed up on in part 6. I used to feel that way too, but having recently watched all the films again, I don't know why. In my opinion, his role is explained enough with what is shown in part 6, and he even might be one of the characters from that film. So, seeing all the films again in succession, I kinda feel more closure on the topic of the mysterious man in black, or at least what he was role was. If that is not enough for you though, you can always watch with the commentary for the explanation of what they originally intended him to be when making part 5.  It's rather different from the route that was taking in 6.

So, there ya have it. Halloween 4 and 5, collected here on two discs from Anchor Bay in one DVD double feature set with lots of excellent bonus features. This is a great way to add two more Halloween films to your collection, and 4 is actually really good, while 5 isn't really too bad, but it should have been something much better. I also find the much loved Tina character (friend of Rachel and Jamie) to be a little on the annoying side. Anyway, seek this out or buy the films separately. If you like Michael Myers, or films like the Friday the 13th series and the like, you should enjoy these at least on some level.

Oh yeah, I do remember having a crush on Danielle Harris once before. Back when they aired a pilot for a sitcom called ""1775"". Yes, it was set in 1775 colonial America, a perfect sitcom for a 1776 fan like myself, ha. Man, I wonder if that's on YouTube! I've always been sad that series only ever aired one episode, to my knowledge.",1289952000,,7759,4.518861209964413

2104902,5,B0002MICI8,"HALLOWEEN 4- I thought it would be awesome to review this movie on this day! Ten years after Michael tried to kill his sister, and six years after Dan Challis saved the kids from dying from the Silver Shamrock masks, Michael comes out of his coma and wants to kill his niece, Jamie Lloyd. Dr. Loomis tries to stop Michael from doing that. Jamie lives with the Carruthers family. Her step-sister Rachel has a big date on HALLOWEEN, but the babysitter broke her ankle at the ice rink, so Rachel has to babysit Jamie. When Rachel takes Jamie trick-or-treating, Rachel sees her boyfriend with the Sheriff's daughter. Soon, Michael comes after Jamie. Some rednecks try to stop Michael also. Jamie, Rachel, Brady, and Kelly all get stuck in the Sheriff's house with Michael inside. If you love the HALLOWEEN series, you'll love HALLOWEEN 4: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS!!!

HALLOWEEN 5- I love almost all the HALLOWEEN films, but this one goes a little downhill for me for two reasons; If they made the Myers house more believable and not a mansion. Not hint about the stupid thorn curse, then I would probably like it a lot more! One year after stabbing her foster mother, Jamie Lloyd has been taken to a children's hospital. Since Jamie touched Michael's hand, she exhibits signs of a telepathic link with her Uncle Michael. On HALLOWEEN, Michael returns to Haddonfield to finish what he started last year. Rachel, Tina, Mikey, Spitz, and Sammy become Michael's new targets at a HALLOWEEN party as he tries to find Jamie. (That party was awesome with all the HALLOWEEN decorations and costumes!) I love the scene when Michael is chasing Jamie, Billy, and Tina through the cornfields with the car! Donald Pleasence is back playing the awesome Dr. Loomis who tries to hunt Michael throughout the HALLOWEEN night at all costs. Later, Loomis takes Jamie to the Myers house. I love scenes of the police and S.W.A.T. team stakeout at Michael's house. That's pretty cool. Loomis tries to reason with Michael one last time before the showdown. Loomis uses Jamie as bait to trap Michael. When Loomis finally stops Michael, he is taken to the police station, so that the U.S. National Guard will take Michael to a maximum-security prison until he dies, but something bad happens. What happens? You'll just have to watch! If you love the HALLOWEEN series, maybe you'll love HALLOWEEN 5: THE REVENGE OF MICHAEL MYERS!!!",1256947200,,2402,4.830097087378641
2104903,4,B0002MICI8,"""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"": 11 years after the events of Halloween 1 and 2, Haddonfield has been having peaceful Halloweens since then and have rejoiced at the celebration of Michael's burning. He has been resurrected as he goes back to his home town yet again, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) was assumed to be dead as he's badly scarred by that burning on half of his face must track down Myers once more. Laurie Strode is presumed to have died in a car accident and her 11 year old daughter Jamie (Danielle Harris) is left for a new family as her life is now at risk. ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers"" is set after the last one as Jamie is sent to a children's hospital after being traumatized by the events, she discovers that she has a psychic link to her presumed dead uncle Michael who goes off yet again to search for her and Dr. Loomis must try to save her again from the hellish phantom.

Halloween 4 is a very good follow-up to the first two Halloween movies, after Halloween 3 Season of the Witch disappointed fans due to Michael's disappearence in that one is because the filmmakers wanted to make the franchise into a big screen Twilight Zone or Tales from The Crypt like anthology of Halloween themed horror stories every year failed. Moustappha Akkad decided to get the rights to Michael after John Carpenter and Debra Hill left the franchise for good, Alan McElroy who co-wrote the script came up with a fantastic idea to bring the Shape back and he succeeded thus it became a three weeks at the box-office hit. The acting is good in this sequel and has the most brutal kills this side of Rob Zombie's Halloween and i also love the twist in the end. Halloween 5 is a very weak sequel that pails in comparisions of the first three movies as it seems almost like a downfall to the series but the kills are still good with the storyline being weak at their best.

Both DVDs are digitally remastered wonderfully with awesome picture and sound with extras like featurettes, Trailers, Audio Commentaries, an introduction on part 5 and behind-the-scenes features.",1256515200,,2101,4.6
