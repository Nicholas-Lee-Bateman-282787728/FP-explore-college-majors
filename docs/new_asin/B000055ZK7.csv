1396121,5,B000055ZK7,"Aside from the Chyna Vs. Ivory match which was total crap in my opinion, ""Royal Rumble 2001"" was a terrific PPV.  The Dudley Boys took home the tag belts in a great opening match with Edge and Christian.  It wasn't the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match of ""Summerslam 2000"" but it was a great way to open it up.  The ladder match for the IC belt between Benoit and Jericho was phenominal.  This was some of the best one on one wrestling I had seen in a while in the WWF with both wrestlers more than outdoing what they do best.  EXCELLENT MATCH.  The match between Angle and Triple H for the title was sort of weak but nevertheless a good match.  Both Angle and Triple H are great at what they do and while this wasn't their best effort it was certainly entertaining.  The Rumble was very good despite some dumb comic relief from Drew Carey (though Honkey Tonk Man's return was pretty funny).  Big Show also came back for about a minute but managed to choke slam everyone including putting the Rock throught the Spanish announcing table.  Kane owned the rumble for he was like the 6th man in and the last out after being defeated by Austin.  Definately a good PPV all in all.",986169600,,1175,4.368663594470046
1396122,4,B000055ZK7,"This was a great PPV, with an excellent effort by all, especially Benoit v. Jericho (IC Title Ladder Match).  With the exception of Chyna v. Ivory, the card was spectacular, with no match being less than extremely good.  Chyna v. Ivory has no value whatsoever, however, so I'd reccomend just fast-forwarding through the 4 minutes that takes.  Anyway, thumbs way up for Royal Rumble 2001!",985996800,,387,4.923076923076923
1396123,5,B000055ZK7,"I don't own the video, but I watched the pay-per-view, and it was a solid show from beginning to end, the only exception being the Chyna vs. Ivory match.  The Jericho/Benoit ladder match is worth the price of the video itself.  The Royal Rumble match is action packed, and has some hilarious moments to boot.  This is one of the best pay-per-views the WWF has produced in a long time.  I highly recommend it to any wrestling fan.",983750400,,429,4.461538461538462
1396124,5,B000055ZK7,"This is the best ppv i've ever seen you can't beat it. WCW, ECW, and the WWF have never made such a great ppv. i was on tv in new orleans behind the announcers at the royal rumble and trust me BUY it! especially from amazon they have the best quality!",982972800,,251,3.9411764705882355
1396125,5,B000055ZK7,"From beginning to end, this was a stand out pay-per-view..not just a Royal Rumble. Things started off in a very entertaining tag team championship match with Edge/Christian(c) vs. the Dudley Boyz. As much as I think E/C are the best tag team in the WWF, the Dudley Boyz proved me wrong. From there, the Intercontinental title was up for grabs in a tremendous Ladder Match between Chris Benoit(c) vs. Y2J. Ok, I'm a big Y2J fan, always been, since ECW, but, this match was one of his best..along with Benoit. Not only was this match scientific, it was brutal as well. The high point of the match was when Benoit did a suicide dive through the ropes to receive a chair shot to the face..must see to believe, definately a match of the year candidate already; like all Jericho/Benoit matches. The womens title was up for grabs shortly after. Ivory(c) vs. Chyna. This was entertaining, but, due to the 2 matches before, it didn't really get me going. The WWF title was up for grabs last as Kurt Angle(c) took on Triple H. Not only can these 2 get under your skin, but they sure can put on a great match. Though it had a screw job ending, Earl Hebner gets a nod from me for taking a couple of bumps. Now, the grand finale, the Royal Rumble match itself. Possibly, the best field of competitors in a very long time. Some could say that it was predictable, some would say otherwise. I was shocked as well as I was excited. Kane put on a monster showing as he lasted for over an hour. Drew Carrey made an appearance, along with the Honky Tonk Man and Haku (wcw's Meng). The highlight of the Royal Rumble itself was when Kane and Undertaker were in the ring alone and the clock counted down from 10 and Stone Cold's theme hit. Though Triple H ran interference before he could hit the ring, the atmosphere, anticipation, and guessing what would/could happen made me excited. If you think that the Royal Rumble event is predictable, this is the one that proved that wrong as Stone Cold Steve Austin rose above the other 29 wrestlers as he is on his way to the Wrestlemania X-Seven main event. So, from Jeff Hardy being #1 in the Rumble, to the mini hardcore Rumble, to Big Show making a return, and to Kane being last eliminated, the Royal Rumble match was the most entertaining of all matches. Definately, this is a must for all wrestling fans.",982886400,,2333,4.466042154566745
1396126,4,B000055ZK7,"To start off a new year WWF wanted to make this a memerable ppv, and they did just that. The 1st match was for the WWF Tag Team Titles The Dudleys vs Edge and Christan. Great opener and we do see the titles change hands. 2nd  was for the IC title in a ladder match Benoit vs. Y2J. Y2J just proved him wrong just like what he was going to do. 3rd was for the Womens title Ivory vs. Chyna. Well the outcome is stupid with RTC beatin her. 4th is for the WWF title Kurt with Trish vs. HHH with Steph. Well although Kurt won it was because of Stone Cold Steve Austin. Now for the fastest 60 minutes on TV the Royal Rumble. It was the best Royal Rumble it had The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin, ABA, Kane, Rikishi and some surprise people like Drew Carry, The Big Show, Honkey Tonk Man. Plus with another 22 superstars. And the winner is a person who has already won it 2 times Stone Cold Steve Austin making him the 1st to ever win the Royal Rumble 3 times. So buy this tape and THATS THE BOTTOM LINE CAUSE STONE COLD SAID SO.",980121600,2,1021,4.029556650246305
1396127,5,B000055ZK7,"The most intense 3 hour PPV yet lived up to that phrase.  Everyone I wanted to win did, the ONLY downfall is that Chyna hurts hurself.  This is definitely worth the money to re-live it over and over.  The matches are: 1-WWF Tag Team Championship: Dudley Boyz vs. Edge & Christian 2-WWF Intercontinental Championship ladder match: Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit 3-WWF Women's Championship: Ivory vs. Chyna 4-WWF Championship: Triple H w/ Stephanie vs. Kurt Angle w/ Trish Stratus 5-30 man Royal Rumble: The one man left in the ring after all 30 have entered will go on to WrestleMania to face the WWF Champion for the title.",980121600,2,623,4.75
1396128,3,B000055ZK7,"This event was a little weaker than I expected.  It started off with a fairly good tag team match between the Dudleyz and Edge and Christian.  As always these two teams put up a good effort and it was a good match.  The next match featured Benoit and Jerich in a ladder match for the IC title.  These two have proved they can peform great in a submission, two out of three falls or any other type of match and this match was no exception.  Very fast paced and very brutal.  Next up was Chyna nad Ivory.  Pathetic match.  After watching the WWF for over 10 years I have come to accept some things that in reality would never happen but this was too much to swallow.  The WWF title was on the line between HHH and Angle.  I won't tell you who wins but it had a bad ending with interference like most WWF title matches.  The Rumble match itself is what brings this video down.  In previous Rumbles men would be involved in a match and than would compete in the Rumble later in the night.  They had men like Honkey Tonk Man and Haku (former WWF wrestlers) and even Drew Carey.  What the hell are they doing in the Rumble instead of guys like Jericho and Benoit I will never know.  Also in the Rumble match there were way to many times when there were only two or three people in the ring and the most was 8.  I think the best Rumbles are the one's when many Superstars are in the ring at once.  All in all a decent PPV but expected more",980035200,,1432,4.111913357400722
1396147,4,B000055ZK7,"I looked foward to the Tag Title match to kick things off, I figure the ladder match would be solid, and the WWE Championship should also be very good. Plus the rumble match should be very good as it usually is, anything can happen during those sixty minutes.

WWE Tag Team Championships:

Edge and Christian(c)vs. The Dudley Boyz

Another match between the two in their feud, Edge and Christian attacked the Dudley's and beat them up and gave them both concussions. Dudley's did a okay job selling it, but it did not hurt the match to much. Both teams were solid which made the match a nice opener for the rumble it was given about 10 minutes probably should have been given alittle more time but due to the injuries that the Dudley's were selling it can be excused. Overall a good opener to get the crowd pumped up, new tag champions. Match Length:10 minutes

Winner: The Dudley Boyz

Intercontinental Championship Ladder Match:

Chris Benoit(c) vs. Chris Jericho

These two had been feuding for awhile over the championship, you know these two will give you a solid match and they most certainly did. Awesome match between the two, match of the year candidate, but definately match of the night as both men gave you everything they had. Jericho nailing Benoit with a chair shot as he tried a suicide dive was a huge surprise and highlight. Great match between two great performers, Jericho wins back the Championship. Match Length: 18 Minutes

Winner: Chris Jericho

Women's Championship:

Ivory(c)vs. Chyna

Did not expect much,but this was a waste of time sure it kept the storyline going between Chyna and Ivory for there Mania showdown. Otherwise it was a waste of time, luckly the rest of the card picks up the ball after this failure. Chyna reinjuries her neck allowing Ivory to take advantage and pin her. Match Length: Under 4 minutes

Winner: Ivory

WWE Championship Match:

Kurt Angle(c)w/Trish Stratus vs. HHH w/Stephanie Mcmahon

Very good match between these two that was expected,it also helped plant the seeds for the feud for Austin and HHH as well as the feud between Stephanie and Trish. It definately did that as Stonecold came in and cost HHH his chance at the title just like HHH did to Austin a couple of weeks prior to it. Anyway both HHH and Angle went at it in a good contest. Match Length: 24 minutes

Winner: Kurt Angle

Royal Rumble Match:

Very good Rumble match, Kane was awesomely dominate and I also think he should have ended up winning the whole thing as he worked hard and really should have been rewarded for his effort. Kane lasted over fifty minutes, Drew Carrey also ended up in the match but he quickly decided to get out of there after he was nearly chokeslammed. Honky Tonk Man returns for the rumble and sings for the crowd but Kane smashed him with the guitar and eliminated him. Haku returned to the WWE also, Matt and Jeff Hardy fought agaist each other for a short time before they eliminated each other. Rock lasted close to 40 minutes, Bradshaw lasted quite awhile. HHH came down and busted up Austin setting up there match at No Way Out. Big Show chokeslams the Rock through the announce table after Rock eliminated him.

Overall Thoughts: Very good PPV, Tag Match was good, Ladder match was awesome, WWE Title Match was also very good with a nice royal rumble match makes this a nice solid PPV to kick off 2001.",1219536000,,3365,4.653716216216216
1396148,4,B000055ZK7,"The Royal Rumble is always a mixed bag. This years card was pretty weak and the Rumble itself was a mumbled mess. There is only one match on the whole card that actully was worth watching.

The Dudley Boys vs. Edge and Christian: Decent match but nothing really speical happened in this match.

Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit in a Ladder Match: One of the greatest, physical ladder matches ive ever witnessed. This is probably the only reason to see this PPV. Its also on a much better set, WWE ladder matches but if your crazy about scratched out WWF logos, this one doesnt have scratched out logos.

Ivory vs. Chyna: Dont like women wrestling as I said many times before. Call me sexist but I just don't see the point. Well for men to go goo goo crazy over it I guess. I'd rather watch porn.

Kurt Angle vs. Triple H: Good main event even though I hated Triple H at this era.

2001 Royal Rumble: I really thought this Rumble was as bad as 1996. Kane did put on a great performance but I thought Drew Carrey ruined it. I didn't like JR and King promoting his show about every few minutes after he appeared. It was pretty cool to see the Rumble turn hardcore as Raven entered. I always hate when one person gets a burst of energy and WHAM! Its only one guy left after eliminating 6 guys. Of course that was Kane with brother Undertaker. Big Show entered and cleaned house. Once again, Big Show cleared house and then got eliminated way to early. Its funny the dues men put in WWE just to get ahead about four years or so later. I did like Triple H busting open the Rattlesnake and him coming back to win it all.  I was shocked at Haku's come back, although that really didn't last long.

A decent Rumble with only one match that was excellent.",1195948800,,1743,4.3119266055045875
1396149,5,B000055ZK7,"This was the Rumble leading up to the apex of the ""Attitude Era"" which was WrestleMania 17.  The entire undercard (with one exception) was solid from start to finish and helped develop storylines leading into not only WrestleMania but the No Way Out PPV the next month as well.  Overall, one of the best Royal Rumbles during this time period.

WWF Tag Team Champions Edge & Christian vs. The Dudley Boys - Dudleys were selling their concussions from earlier in the week as the match itself was short but did enough to get the crowd & show kicked off in a good direction.  They had better matches & would go on to have better ones in the future which make this match forgettable in most people's minds.

Ladder Match: Intercontinental Champion Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho - I was upset that this match wasn't on Chris Benoit's DVD because it was one of WWF's best ladder matches and you know you can NEVER fail with Jericho & Benoit in the same match.  They took from brutal bumps & the chairshot delievered when Benoit went though the ropes was ""hardcore"" to say the least.  It wasn't the time length as say the WMX ladder match but it was still classic in quality.

Womens Champion Ivory vs. Chyna - This was the dud I was talking about earlier in that it was only on here to continue the RTC/Chyna storyline & set up the rematch (and eventual squash match) between these two at WrestleMania.

WWF Champion Kurt Angle w/Trish Stratus vs. Triple H w/Stephanie McMahon - They had better matches in the past but this was still solid in ring action.  However, this match were was to advance other storylines such as continuing the Austin/HHH fued into No Way Out and also push the Trish/Stephanie rivarly that included a catfight on the outside that was so wild that even the guys in the ring stopped what they were doing to watch it.

Royal Rumble Battle Royal - This Rumble was filled with plenty of highlights such as the reunion of the Brothers Of Destruction & returns of Big Show & Haku, who was the current WCW Hardcore Champion at that time.  Comedian Drew Carrey & Honky Tonk Man both made special appearences & Kane set his current Rumble record of 11 eliminations, the most of any one wrestler.  Stone Cold would eventually win it in the end but Kane was the MVP of this Rumble.

Solid matches from top to bottom (except for one but that was real short) and one of the most entertaining Rumbles of all time, I highly recommend.",1175644800,,2438,4.511363636363637
1396150,5,B000055ZK7,"The 2001 Royal Rumble was the last good Rumble for a couple years, so its definitely worth taking a look at. Besides having a great main event, the undercard was excellent.

The Dudley Boys vs. Edge (C) and Christian (C)

This match was decent. Edge and Christian carried the Dudleys through the match and made it respectable but its easily forgettable.

Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit (C) in a Ladder Match

Anytime you put Benoit in a match, it's going to be good, and when you put him in there with someone as talented as Chris Jericho, you're in for something special. These two put on one hell of a match, and the ladder match gimmick was a great way to end one of the best feuds in WWE history. These two took some brutal bumps and kept going. I cant rave enough about this one.

Ivory (C) vs. Chyna

This match really doesnt belong on a pay per view. Pretty much every women's match involving Chyna was a squash, and this match wasn't any different. Ivory gets in a little bit of offense and doesnt look terrible, but fortunately the match was short.

Kurt Angle (C) vs. Triple H

This match was excellent. Its also one of the few times you'll ever see these two wrestle each other. Great variety and pacing help make this match one of the best of the year. These two can really wrestle. For once, the interference angle comes off well and only makes the match better.

2001 Royal Rumble

Personally, I loved this match. Kane put on an absolutely outstanding performance. Aside from lasting over 50 minutes and eliminating a record 11 people, he just looked good out there, proving that just because you're a big guy, it doesnt mean you cant wrestle. This is the only rumble match to date which featured alot of weapons, though that segment started quickly and ended abruptly. Kane and the Undertaker worked well together. Austin's role in the match was overplayed though, and the Rock was dull. The wrong man won, or at least, the attack angle was just stupid. Although Kane will never win a Royal Rumble, he really should have won this one.

This is one of the best Royal Rumble events to date. A great undercard and a great Royal Rumble. The only weak spot on this card lasts about three minutes. It's definitely worth buying immediatly.",1139356800,11,2247,4.537128712871287
1396151,5,B000055ZK7,"This was definitely one of the best Royal Rumbles. The action was great in every match except for the women's match.

1. Edge and Christian vs. Dudley Boyz(WWF Tag Team Championship)

This was an amazing tag team match. Anytime these two teams get together, you know that it will be good. There were great moves throughout and it was very well paced. 10 out of 10.

2. Ladder Match

Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit(WWF Intercontinental Championship)

This was an excellent match. These guys had an intense rivalry going into the match, and I thought that this was a great way to end the rivalry. There was a sick chair shot to Benoit when he did a suicide dive. 10 out of 10.

3. Chyna vs. Ivory(WWF Womens Championship)

This wasn't good at all. These two women are not very good looking and the match absolutely sucked because Chyna got injured during the match. Just skip this and enjoy the other matches. 2 out of 10.

4. Kurt Angle vs. Triple H(WWF Championship)

This was definitely one of the best matches that these two have had with each other,and it was intense. The interference was great too, because it came into play again later on in the Royal Rumble match. 10 out of 10.

5. Royal Rumble Match(Winner Gets Title Shot At Wrestlemania)

This was one of the best Royal Rumble Matches in history, mainly because of the variety. What I mean is that at one point, its a normal match, then it gets hardcore, and then it gets funny,etc. 10 out of 10.",1138406400,,1457,4.501901140684411

Match One-Tag Team Titles-Edge & Christian(C)Vs The Dudley Boyz-This was a good choice for the opener as it was exciting and it was two great teams wrestling each other. The finish was great as long with most of this match. What an excellent way to start off this show. My rating 6.58/10.

Match Two-Ladder Match-Intercontinental Championship-Chris Benoit(C)Vs Y2J-This was a good solid ladder match with both men putting their bodies on the line to gain the Intercontinental Title. I hope these two keep feuding for a long part of this year as they work awesome together and they are both really great wrestlers who deserve the major title around their waist. My rating 7.78/10.

Match Three-Womens Title-Ivory(C)Vs Chyna-This match was a basic womens match and what I expected from Chyna. There was some powerful moves used and some technical stuff. You can't miss the ending of this its very supprising. My rating 4.52/10.

Match Four-WWE Title Match-Kurt Angle(C)Vs HHH-This match was spectacular. It had lots of surprises,risks and a great ending which leads to something in the next match which is awesome. These two men are great wrestlers and they both deserve this match up the top of this card. Hopefully these two keep feuding and it goes strong and finishes strong. My rating 7.96/10.

Match Five-Main Event-Royal Rumble Match-This Rumble had a few good surprise entries such as Drew Carey,Honky Tonk Man and Haku. There was lots of action as well as some hardcore action early on as well. The Hardyz teamed up and worked together and so did Kane and his brother The Undertaker. Austin got busted open before he had even entered the ring. The ending was great and this was one of the most emotional Rumbles ever. My rating 8.42/10.

And I'd just like to note: It seems WWE felt sorry for all of the worst wrestlers in the business, in 2001, and felt they had to give them a push...so, the worst group of all time, was born...Right to Censor SUCKS! 0/10

Match #4 HHH vs. Kurt Angle (c) for the WWF Championship: Great title match eventhough I never have and never will like HHH. HHH will never be the star that Austin, Rock, or even Ric Flair are no matter how many times he is pushed as champ, and this match was the start of all of that! Thank God Stone Cold saved this match and destroyed HHH. Kurt retains, it's true, it's true!!! 8/10

Match #5 Royal Rumble Match: Awesome rumble! It was practically a Hardcore Rumble for a little while there with all the crap in the ring! Great performances by Rock, Kane, and Stone Cold! Plus the editions of Drew Carey and The Honky Tonk Man made it funny as well! And Rikishi sucks, he didn't deserve #30 and he even eliminated Undertaker! HHH also tried to get revenge on Austin but it didn't work cuz Stone Cold won!!! 10/10

This DVD had a lot of extras and the match taped for HEAT with Kai En Tai and Lo Down. Kai En Tai is hilarious! Basically this is a great DVD. You should buy it! Just skip past Chyna and Ivory and don't watch the Right to Censor extra...they re horrible!!!",1099440000,,2165,4.4296482412060305

1396160,4,B000055ZK7,"The 2001 Royal Rumble pretty muched lived up to the hype with some great matches and a awesome royal rumble match.
The opening match is the Tag Team Championship match between The Dudley Boyz & champions Edge & Christian.  Suprisingly good match between two of the most successful tag teams ever.  Get everybody hyped up for the pay per view.  Next is a ladder match between Chris Jericho & Intercontinental Champion Chris Benoit.  Could be the match of the night.  Features some brutal hardcore moves like, Chris Jericho's chair shot to Chris Benoit when he's jumping out of the ring.  Highspeed match between these two talented athletes.
The next match is Chyna vs. Ivory for the Women's Championship.  This was on its way to being a pretty good match but ends with Chyna reinjuring her neck.  Better than there Wrestlemania match but the ending is worse.  The WWF Championship match between Champion Kurt Angle & Triple H, is an ok main event.  Things get stupid when Trish Stratus & Stephanie McMahon Helmsley start having a chick fight in the middle of the ring.  Match ends with Stone Cold interfering.
The Royal Rumble match was full of surprises.  Here are some highlights.  Jeff Hardy enters the match at number 1, with his brother entering at #3.  Its fun to see the Hardy Boyz fighting.  Also, the Honky Tonk Man makes a special appearance, as well as Drew Carey, Haku, & The Big Show who gives a vicious chokeslam to The Rock on the announcers table.  Most people should be impressed with Kane on this DVD, as he was in the match for over and hour, and elimanted more people than anyone.

Chyna Vs. Ivory:0 Almost as dissapointing as the Goldberg/Lesnar Match at Wrestlemania 20.
Angle Vs. HHH:**1/2 Pretty lame, except for the catfight between Trish and Stephanie, and, my favorite part, Austin screwing HHH outta the title.
The Royal Rumble:***** The best reason to buy the DVD is the best Rumble ever. Drew Carey was a pleasant surprise, Rock got chokeslammed through a table, and I couldn't think of a better final 2. Incredible.

While there have been many memorable Royal Rumble shows, I would have to say that the 2001 Royal Rumble was the best one that I ever saw. The actual Royal Rumble is absolutely outstanding. Most of the time, the WWE sticks a few stars in with 28 other wrestlers that no one cares about. However, the 2001 Royal Rumble had almost every major star competing in it. This made the match very unpredictable because any number of people could've won. One of the funniest moments of the night had to be when Drew Carrey of all people came out and competed as one of the participants in the Royal Rumble. However, the best match of the show would have to be the ""Ladder Match"" for the IC Title between Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit. This would probably rank in the top 3 ladder matches of all time. It was filled with tons of technical work and high flying action. The match went back and forth the whole time, and you are never quite sure who is going to win. The match for the WWE title between Kurt Angle and Triple H was also very satisfying as well.
The 2001 Royal Rumble was one of the most entertaining and well rounded WWE shows I have ever seen. The DVD extras are also pretty good as well. This is truly a must for any WWE fan!!",1078099200,,1355,4.195402298850575

Intercontinental Championship Ladder Match: Chris Benoit (champion) vs. Chris Jericho - Match of the night in my view! Not the best one on one Ladder Match but definitely one of the better one's. Still haven't seen a one on one Ladder match to top the two classics from Shawn Michaels & Scott ""Razor Ramon"" Hall but this one comes pretty close!
Women's Championship Match: Ivory (champion) vs. Chyna - This slaughter was kept mercifully short!
WWF Championship Match: Kurt Angle (champion) with Trish Stratus vs. Triple H with Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley - Didn't live up to its potential at all. Having Austin interfere actually hurt Kurt more than helped as I don't think he needed it to beat HHH! Kurt more than proved that later on in the year thru now! Not one of HHH's best performances though no where near as bad as his matches with Scott Steiner in 2003.
30-Man Royal Rumble Match - Good energy from the crowd. Nice change by having it hardcore for a segment or two! I agree with one reviewer in that it should've been Austin Vs. Rock at the end instead of Austin Vs. Kane. A good Rumble match nonetheless.

A good portion of the matches were good with the exception of probably one of the best Singles Ladder Matches ever (Benoit vs Jericho, IC belt on the line). The Championship match between HHH and Angle was pretty good and even the Tag Team championship between the Dudleyz and Edge/Christian was O.k.
Match you could easily skip/fast forward through? Ivory and Chyna. I absolutely hated this match and still do to this day. I didn't like RTC (Right To Censor) Ivory and this match was totally one-sided and boring. Best thing about this match? It ended.
The Rumble Match itself was great, with guest entries from WWE great The Honky Tonk Man and TV star Drew Carrey. Give it up to Drew on this one because he did help eliminate the Hardy Boyz. This Royal Rumble also saw some Hardcore rules in it as well and a great Rumble outing from Kane, probably one of his best Rumbles.
I'd this one is worth checking out just on the basis of Benoit and Jericho's Ladder match. I still think that was one of the most memorable Ladder matches (TLC's NOT included, just Ladder matches). And again, the Rumble match was pretty good in this one as well. Check out ROYAL RUMBLE 2001 and also check out ROYAL RUMBLE 2002, INVASION and WRESTLEMANIA X7.",1043712000,,1263,4.568281938325991

Edge and Christian vs The Dudleyz for the tag team championship.
This match was better than i thought it would be.  Great spots, good storyline, you expected this match to be bad?!  Dudleyz pull it off with the 3D and the win!!!...
Jericho vs Benoit IC title ladder match.  Wow, i've seen lots of ladder matches and all that, and this was the first one to make me say ""havent they killed each other enough""  Good grief at this match, it was beyond belief.  I'd say buy this video just for that match.  Jericho gets the win, Go Jericho Go...
Chyna vs Ivory for women's title.  DUD.  Chyna injures neck, Ivory pins her for that for the win, but the match itself was ok.  It was good they saved it up for WM17, even if the match was short.  *
Triple H vs Kurt Angle for the WWF Title.  I expected this match to be way better, since their matches before than like at Summerslam and Unforgiven were better, but i was wrong.  The main thing ppl remember about it is Trish and Steph catfight, as well as Stone Cold hittin the stunner to give Kurt the win. **
The Royal Rumble.  Wow, I was impressed with Kane.  Entered #6 and eliminated the last.  Great spots in this match.  Kane eliminatin lots of ppl with trash can lid, Big Show chokeslammin everyone, includin Rock thru a table, etc.  Stone Cold gets the win even tho he used a chair, who i was rootin for.  A great Royal Rumble with him winning it and going to Wrestlemania...
This Royal Rumble was a great ppv.  I'd recommend anyone to buy it.  I'm gonna try and get it for Christmas.  Maybe the best Royal Rumble ever.",1038700800,,1724,4.288819875776397

The Royal Rumble logo then flashes onto the screen, and it cuts to the arena where the pyro explodes and JR and Jerry Lawler welcome fans to the Royal Rumble, live from New Orleans, LA.
Match No. 1 - The Dudley Boys vs. Edge and Christan for the WWE Tag Team Titles: Nice fast paced opening bout to kick of the show, and an excellent way to open the show with the very popular Dudleys taking on the Tag Team Champions Edge and Christian. Some nice spots and sequences, such as Edge stopping Christian getting the 3D with a spear, and Edge and Christian attempting their own ""Wassup"" headbutt. The Dudleys win the Tag Titles in 10:10, much to the pleasure of the crowd. Rating - 7/10
Match No. 2 - Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit in a ladder match for the Intercontinental Title: Brutal match up, with both Canadians pounding the living hell out of each other with the ladder and a steel chair. Notable spots include Jericho countering Benoits suicide dive with a thudding chair shot, and Benoit shoving Jeriocho off the ladder onto the ropes. Jericho wins after sending Benoit crashing to the floor at 18:48. Excellent match, among the best ladder matches I have seen. Rating - 9/10
Match No. 3 - Chyna vs. Ivory for the WWE Womens Title: Chyna, who had supposedly been injured by Ivory previously, was returning and looking for revenge against the RTC member. Chyna dominates the whole match, with clotheslines, a top rope snapmare, a overhead gorilla press and a nastly looking powerbomb. Its looks as though Chyna is going to capture the Womens belt as she sets Ivory up for a Somersault Elbow, but lands on her neck and reinjures it, allowing Ivory to get the pin at 3:33. A load of nonsense here, and Chyna gave out some horribly sloppy offense. Rating - 1/10
Match No. 4 - Triple H vs. Kurt Angle for the WWE Title: Both men enter with their respective managers, Trish Stratus and Stephanie McMahon. Both work a nice technical exibition, including many suplexes performed by Angle, Triple H punishing Angle with some hard hitting offense. Near the end, both hit their finishing moves, the Angle Slam and the Pedigree, but the referee gets knocked out. Angle hits a top rope arm drag, but Triple H counters and looks to get the pin, but Stone Cold interferes and helps Kurt Angle retain the title at 24:12. It lagged a bit in the middle, but other than that it was an excellent suplex filled battle. Rating - 8/10
Match No. 5 - The Royal Rumble: Great Rumble, with all the big name WWE Superstars involved as 30 men battle out to win a title shot at Wrestlemania X7. Several cool things happen, suchn as the Hardy Boys fighting one another, Kane staying in the Rumble an incredible 60 minutes, and Drew Carey making a special appearence. When Stone Cold makes his entrance, Triple H jumps him and pounds him into a bloody mess. Unphased, Austin enters the Rumble and eliminates the last particpant Kane, to win the title shot. Awesome Rumble, with lots of big name stars and hardcore carnage too. Rating 9/10
Summary:
+ Excellent Opener, which fires the crowd right up
+ Ladder match features lots of hard hitting offense
+ Strong match between Angle and HHH
+ Rumble does not dissapoint, and is one of the best I have seen
- Chyna and Ivory assemble a horrible battle
- The crowd was very quiet during the WWE title match
- The PPV seemed to built around the HHH/Austin feud, making everything else seem less important.
Overall, despite a few glitches, a great event, well worth buying. The Ladder match is a Match of the Year contender, whereas everything else bar the Womens match also includes top notch effort. Definately worth purchasing.

Remember, I said the best Royal Rumble, not the best pay-per-view. When I say Royal Rumble, I am speaking of the Rumble match itself. From the beginning with the Hardy's going at it - to Drew Carey's enterance - to the Hardcore Rumble - to Kanes complete domination - to Austin coming out with Undertaker and Kane in the ring - all the way to the last man who stood alone..which we all know is Austin..this Rumble did not have one moment where it lost your attention. I have watched this Rumble over and over again. One of my favorite gimmick matches of all time.
The rest of the pay-per-view was stacked as well. All 3 of the major titles were on the card. The tag team championship (Edge/Christian vs. the Dudley Boyz), the intercontinental championship (Benoit vs. Jericho - Ladder Match), and the world championship (Angle vs. HHH).

It was a solid match that never fails to lose your attention, with good selling for the concussions.  Next is Jericho vs. Benoit in a classic ladder match.  I'm glad to see a match like this that isn't all high-spots, even though those matches ae entertaining too.  Also, Benoit takes a wicked shot from a steel chair when diving through the ropes.

Edge and Christian vs. The Dudley Boyz, Tag Titles. Very good opener, very exciting finish, but not really anything special.
Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho, IC Title, Ladder Match. Excellent match. Innovative and exciting. Not quite the spotfest of a TLC or anything, but a five star technical match, made only more exciting by the stipulation. Stole the show.
Chyna vs. Ivory, Women's Title. DUD. Boring lame squash with a poor ending.
HHH vs. Kurt Angle, World Title. Good, but not great. I figured that Trish and Steph would make a bigger impact. Good action, but kinda just like a really long raw main event.
Royal Rumble: Excellent rumble. Good action, very unpredictable. Several wrestlers had excelent showings, with a dramatic finish. Good overall PPV but not amazing or anything.",999129600,,941,4.8875

5. Royal Rumble: This was by far the most star studded Rumble ever with names such as Taker,Kane,Rikishi,Rock and Stone Cold it was very hard to pick a winner for this one. I loved the hardcore element and hope it is used again next year. I also liked Honkys guest appearance and the fact that Kane dominated. The bit with Austin/Triple H was great and only built up for their match at No Way Out. The ending was also superb and after the stare-down between Austin and Rocky it was obvious they were going to meet at WrestleMania.*****

Matches: (All matches ratings out of 5 stars)
0. Lo Down Vs. Kaientai - Extra DVD match - The winner of this match gets to pick one of their wrestlers to enter the Royal Rumble. Pretty cool that this was included. A really short match though. Kaientai, the Rodney Dangerfield of the WWF, doesn't get any respect for their skills. Same for D'Lo. Only lasts 2 minutes, but what's there is good.  **
1. Edge & Christian Vs. The Dudely Boys - Tag Team Championship - An average match. Both Dudleys had suffered major concussions at the hands of Edge & Christian (which they looked a bit silly selling) and sought revenge. No lumber used here. I think I'm spoiled at the death defying matches of these tag-teams, but it's still a good match!  ***
2. Chris Benoit Vs. Chris Jericho - IC Championship Ladder Match - Both Canadians have been feuding off and on for a year and decided to finish it in a dangerous ladder match. This is a Match of the year contender as both men take ridiculous risks to win the belt including the ""Walls of Jericho"" on the top of the ladder! Benoit dives out of the ring like a bullet only to fly right into one of the most vicous chairshots I've ever seen/heard! Lots of drama here much like the Michaels/Ramon ladder matches of the mid-90's. A very exciting match!  *****
3. Ivory Vs. Chyna - Womens Championship - DUD.. Ivory's a little entertaining but that's about it. 1/2*
4. Kurt Angle Vs. Triple-H - WWF Championship - Champion Kurt Angle had Trish Stratus in her corner and HHH had Stephanie McMahon. Both were big heels (bad guys) but I think the crowd was behind Angle in this one. I firmly think this could have been an amazing match except for 2 problems.. 1) The ending [is bad], I don't want to give it away but it [is bad].. 2) The crowd was *Never* into the match, except for when the 2 girls went at it in a catfight. They were basically sitting on their hands for the entire match. Nonetheless Angle and Triple-H put on a great match! In a Ric Flair-like match, Triple-H unmercifully worked on Angle's leg for most of the match. Angle came back though and both men put on a display of incredible moves such as the Razor's Edge, an Angle-sault, and an arm-drag off the top rope. All in all a good match that could have been great!  ****
5. Pretty good Rumble! The Winner of this Rumble will take on the World Champion at Wrestlemania 2001. Some of the main contender's include The Rock, Steve Austin, The Undertaker, Rikishi, and Kane. Speaking of Kane, the big-red machine last over 55 minutes in the ring! Also The Big Show makes his comeback assaulting The Rock, Austin is busted open on the way to the ring, and for awhile it's a hardcore Rumble as all hardcore contenders miraculously are in the ring at the same time. Plus there's 2 surprise wrestlers and 1 surprise celebrity (don't worry, it's not Arquette).. A really great ending ends a really great Royal Rumble. ****
DVD Extras: Nothing much here, only one audio track and a bunch of retrospects of the matches and interviews with the wrestlers. One neat thing is the addition of the Lo Down vs. Kaientai Heat match. Off course as in all WWF DVD's, great audio and video quality.

Edge and Christian had recently jumped The Dudleyz on an episode of Raw with a Conchairto, so the Dudleyz went in to the match less than 100% but that didn't stop them from starting the match almost immediately. The Tag Team division was still hot after the Dudleyz, the Hardyz, and E&C took it over the previous year in 2000. E&C work over D-Von and his injured head throughout the match. D-Von ends up making the hot tag and Bubba comes in and takes out E&C. The Dudleyz go for the 3D on Christian, but Edge prevents it with a Spear on Bubba only to get the close 2 count. E&C mess around and attempt the Wassup on Bubba but D-Von prevents it from happening. The Dudleyz flatten Edge with a 3D and we have new Tag Team Champions.

2.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Ladder Match: Chris Jericho vs Chris Benoit (c)

Jericho and Benoit had a spectacular feud in 2000, beating the stuffing out of each other on numerous occasions on both television and PPV for the Intercontinental Championship. After numerous classic battles the previous year, they'd settle the score once and for all in this Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship. This match was as intense as you'd expect it to be. There were some amazing spots throughout this match, including one where Jericho trapped Benoit in the Walls of Jericho on the ladder. After an amazing brutal back and forth bout, Jericho hits Benoit with a chair and tips him off the ladder to the outside. Y2J climbs the ladder and grabs the title for the win. This was nothing short of an intense, fast paced, high action match. Couldn't have asked for a better way to have this feud end. This match remains my favorite Royal Rumble undercard match and one of my favorites from the Attitude Era

3.) WWF Women's Championship Match: Ivory (c) w/Steven Richards vs Chyna

For the last 2 years, Chyna had been booked as a seemingly unstoppable diva (I use that loosely for her) in the WWF. After taking a spike piledriver from Val Venis and Ivory that broke her neck a few weeks prior to the PPV, her dominance and future of her career came into question. This match only lasted about maybe 3 minutes at best. Chyna dominates Ivory, Richards tries to come in to stop it but takes a beating from the 9th Wonder of the World. Chyna connects with a handspring elbow on Ivory in the corner but collapses immediately after. Ivory pins Chyna to retain the title. Chyna remains frozen in place after the match almost as if she suffered from temporary paralysis. Jerry Lawler and Billy Gunn get in the ring and check on Chyna and she's eventually placed in a neck brace and wheeled out on a stretcher

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) WWF Championship Match: Triple H w/Stephanie McMahon vs Kurt Angle (c) w/Trish Stratus

After Vince McMahon made Triple H the #1 Contender for Kurt Angle's championship and learned that Stephanie would be in HHH's corner, Angle decided that he needed a manager to watch his back too and aligned with Trish. It was also around this time that Trish began her ""relationship"" with Vince McMahon, which didn't sit well with Stephanie, which is why the 2 were butting heads leading up to the match. The match itself was great; a technical and showmanship treat to watch. The HHH/Angle feud from 2000 poured into 2001 and just like Jericho/Benoit would be the final match for their feud...for the time being. This was a heel vs heel match which was rare to see during the latter parts of the Attitude Era. This was probably head and shoulders better than their Unforgiven match. HHH injures Angle's knee with a chair behind the referee's back early on and works over Angle's knee for most of the match. Of course, Stephanie and Trish end up getting into a huge catfight at ringside that'd make even Jerry Springer proud. Vince comes out and fails to break up the fight as he gets caught in the middle of it as they brawl to the backstage area. Earl Hebner is bumped into on 2 different occasions. Triple H finishes off the Olympic champion with a Pedigree but suddenly Austin shows up and attacks Triple H. Stone Cold busts Triple H open with the championship belt and hits a Stunner for good measure. Angle makes the cover and Hebner revives to count the 3 count pinfall. Great match to end the Angle/HHH feud all while continuing the Austin/HHH one

5.) 2001 Royal Rumble Match

The build-up for the Royal Rumble match was perfectly booked. The top 5 favorites who were centered around the Rumble match and the favorites to win were The Rock, Kane, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Rikishi, and The Undertaker. It was the first time since maybe the 1996 or 1997 Royal Rumble where the Royal Rumble match revolved around more than one superstar who looked to be a favorite to win. Jeff Jardy at #1 and Bull Buchanan at #2 start off the match with Bull getting the upperhand on Jeff. That changes when Matt comes in at #3 and he and Jeff work together to eliminate him before going after each other. They make easy work of Faarooq at #4. Drew Carey is next at #5 but he watches from ringside the Hardyz take each other apart. Both the Hardyz eliminate each other and Drew is left in the ring awaiting the next entry. Kane is out at #6 which is where things get interesting. He stalks the ring, staring down Drew Carey before entering. Kane prepares to Chokeslam Carey but he's stopped by Raven who enters at #7 and saves him by hitting Kane with a kendo stick. Carey eliminates himself from the Rumble and things get down to business. When people think of the 2001 Royal Rumble, they think of Kane, as this was the Rumble where he set his record for 11 eliminations in one Royal Rumble match. A record that'd go untouched until last year's Rumble PPV. Honky Tonk Man comes at #12 but gets demolished by Kane and eliminated. The remaining favorites entered at different intervals. The Rock was #13, Big Show returned at #23 and Chokeslammed everyone in sight before being eliminated by Rock, just like the previous year's Rumble. An enraged Show dragged The Rock out of the ring and Chokeslammed him through the announce table. The remaining favorites; Undertaker, Steve Austin, and Rikishi entered out different intervals. Undertaker at #25, Austin at #27, and Rikishi at #30. Triple H attacked Austin on his way to the ring and busted him open. The final 2 were Austin and Kane. After multiple chair shots to the head, Austin knocks Kane over the top rope to win his 3rd Royal Rumble which would be the last Rumble he'd win

Overall: Hot off the heels of 2000, which was probably the best year for the WWF in the Attitude Era, behind 1998, WWF's first PPV of 2001 was off the charts and was a sign to come of many of the other amazing PPVs they'd have that year. As far as I'm concerned, there hasn't been a Royal Rumble--before or after the 2001 Royal Rumble that was as stacked and exciting, beginning to end like this one. Every undercard match delivered. Jericho and Benoit ended their feud with a historic Ladder Match, Triple H and Kurt Angle ended their feud....until next year with a nice heel vs heel match while the HHH/Austin feud continued. And the Royal Rumble match was exciting and fun to watch, beginning to end. A few nice surprise entrants here and there. I do believe that Kane should've won the Royal Rumble match. Austin had already won 2 Rumbles and Kane has never had as dominant of a performance in a Royal Rumble match since this one. All though in fairness, Austin winning did lead to the historic Austin/Rock match at Wrestlemania X7. Overall, the 2001 Royal Rumble was a fun one to watch and highly recommend adding it to your collection",1421712000,,9900,5.136024844720497

7931608,5,B000055ZK7,"This, overall, was a good ppv. It had great matches and great moments.

1)Edge & Christian v. Dudleys: This was agood match to start the show off with. The crowd was in to it and so was I.

2)Chris Benoit v. Chris Jericho(Ladder Match 4 I.C. title): This is a great ladder match. In fact, it's one of the best I've seen. It's not just two guys falling off the ladder like other ladder matches; it has some wrestling, weapons, and some big moves in it. This should be in both of their most memorable matches.(When Benoit died, Raw showed his greatest matches and this was one of them)

3)Ivory v. Chyna: In my opinion, this was a good match. Chyna had just been injured by the Right to Censor and this was her first match back. Throughout the match, Chyna was taking out Ivory. Then, at the end of the match, Chyna gets injured again.

4)Kurt Angle w/ Trish Stratus v. Triple H w/Stephanie (WWF Title): This was a really great match. It showed wrestling move after wrestling move from HHH which is something we don't see HHH use that much. The storyline for this match had a lot to do with Trish and Stephanie. In fact, half of the pre match promo was about the fued between Stephanie and Trish. When Trish gets involved in the match, Stephanie takes her out. The two get into a big fight which brings out Vince. Then at the end Stone Cold interferes in the match and he costs Triple H the title.

5)Royal Rumble: It's an o.k. royal rumble match. I'ts not the best. The big suprise is that Drew Carry is in it. So is the Honky Tonk Man. It had big names in it like Undertaker, Kane, The Rock, Stone Cold, etc.

In my opinion, this is one of the best Royal Rumbles ever. All of the matches were good and all of them had good storylines. My favorite match was the WWF title match. It had good wrestling moves and a great fight at ringside. I would recommend anyone to buy it.",1226188800,,1872,4.2740112994350286
7931609,5,B000055ZK7,"Royal Rumble 2001 started out a huge and phenonemal year in ppv's . 2001 had a great and unpressidented year. Royal Rumble was non-stop action all the way through. There's was a bad match on the card but only due to an injury. Also I have to say that the 2001's Royal Rumble Match was the best in my view, it was unbelieveable. Another thing, watch for Drew Carey's entry into the Royal Rumble Match.

1. WWE Tag Team Titles
Edge & Christian vs. The Dudley Boyz
A great opener. These two along with the Hardys always put on good and entertaining matches and this was no exception. Both teams looked good and the crowd was all in this match. Great tag team match. 4.25/5

2. Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Title
Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho
Talk about a show stealer. This is one of those matches that when you look back on the ppv this match was the match of the night. Jericho and Benoit are both great athletes and they always put on a great show for us. The ladder gets frequently used and they used that thing a lot. The ladder would come into play many times. This match to me was the best IC title ladder match of all time. Just a breath taking match. A classic ladder bout. 5/5

3. Women's Title
Chyna vs. Ivory w/ Steven Richards
This was a personal match for Chyna. Chyna just woman handles Ivory and not letting Ivory get in any offense at all. Chyna would just be dominant all the way through until she re-injures herself in the corner. I give Chyna credit here. She looked absolutly awesome, too bad for the injury though. 2.5/5

4. WWE Title
Kurt Angle w/ Trish Stratus vs. Triple H w/ Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley
This was a great match. This is one of the better bouts these two has had with each other and the Trish/Steph factor did not bring down the match at all. Triple H really works on the leg and knee of Angle and just using everything he could including a steel chair and the ring steps to add more punishment to the knee. The match had some good reversals and counters. This isn't a classic match but it is pretty darn good. 5/5

5. The Royal Rumble Match
Like I said earlier, in my eyes this is the best Rumble match I have ever seen. There was everything in this match from wrestling, entertainment, weapon use, return of superstars, great names to partake in it, blood, great eliminations, just everything.

The Rumble starts out with the Hardy brothers battling themselves and putting on a good show. It really got picked up when Kane entered the match at entry number 6 and started to get hardcore with Raven. Kane had an awesome performance and to me he had the best Royal Rumble performance of all time right here. He really deserves more credit for this match than he gets. The Rock had a pretty impressive showing as well. Big Show had a great return and just chokeslamming everybody in sight and even chokeslamming the Rock through an announce table. Kane was just great all the way through though, throwing out a record of 11 people and lasting well over a hour until he was thrown out by Stone Cold. This Rumble match is a must have, a phenomenal Royal Rumble Match. 5/5

Royal Rumble 2001 is a must a ppv, I highly recommend on this purchase.",1221091200,,3187,4.4190800681431
