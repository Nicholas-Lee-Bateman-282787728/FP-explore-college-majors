8268372,5,B00183SMQ2,"When this DVD becomes widely available to the public, do not hesitate...buy it! Thankfully, I made a DVD from my recording - I was not sure if or when the MET would ever let us see it again.

The entire cast's singing is of the first order; the costumes / sets are amazing; and the staging is engaging for every minute you are watching. Nathan Gunn (Papageno), Erika Miklosa (Queen of the Night), Rene Pape (Sarastro) & Ying Huang (Pamina) will always own these parts in your mind - they are such stand outs. But is is Julie Taymor's (Lion King) freedom to create and her inate, deft originality that  makes this astonishing DVD a cut above all others. Hats off to her and Peter Gelb who is the deepest breath of fresh air the MET has had since Bing departed from us.",1223251200,8,767,4.356643356643357
