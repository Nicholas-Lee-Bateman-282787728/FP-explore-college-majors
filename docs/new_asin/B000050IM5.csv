7929085,5,B000050IM5,"To start off the series with a little twist, Ash oversleeps on the first day of his Pokmon journey, to find that all the Pokmon have been taken, except for Pikachu, who isn't too happy with it's new trainer. They get attacked by a flock of Spearow. Pikachu manages to hold them off, but is critically injured, so they flee to Viridian City with Misty in pursuit, as Ash ""borrowed"" her bike. Pikachu is treated at the Viridian City Pokmon Center and is about to take a nap in the recovery room when Team Rocket shows up, cuts the power and attacks. Luckily, the center's alternative electricity is a bunch of Pikachu, who all thundershock Team Rocket. Ash's Pikachu wakes up, and shocks them again, causing their Koffing to explode and Team Rocket to ""Blast off again..."" . Misty, who came into Viridian City a little while after Ash came, starts to follow him so he can repay her for her bike. ""Our heroes"" (the narrator's words, not mine!) head into Viridian forest, where Ash catches a Caterpie, and later, a Pigeotto.
A great start to a great anime. And Pokmon is not a Digimon rip-off or vice versa, the goal in Pokmon is to become the world's greatest Pokmon master, where the Digigoal is to save the Digiworld. Enough said, just buy the video already!",980553600,,1257,4.566371681415929
