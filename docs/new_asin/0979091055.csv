8628701,5,0979091055,"In true Dr. Tenpenny style, she factually lays out data in an easy to follow manner shining light on the deceptive nature of the vaccine business. From, skewed studies giving the illusion of effective vaccination programs to serious conflicts of interest between vaccine manufacturers and government officials who are in place to dictate ""mandated"" vaccine schedules, Dr. Tenpenny exposes this deep-rooted corruption that plagues the medical field.  And setting all the hype aside, she exposes the truth behind the smallpox and polio vaccines; revealing they were not the miracle cure they have been made out to be all these years.  Vaccine Developers Heroes or Villains also offers incredible insight into the safety and efficacy of several different vaccines as well as giving informative facts as to why they are not necessary (and often contradictory) to maintaining good health. This is an excellent video for those well-studied in vaccine dangers as well as those who are just now starting to question the use of vaccines.",1274832000,6,1028,5.262195121951219
