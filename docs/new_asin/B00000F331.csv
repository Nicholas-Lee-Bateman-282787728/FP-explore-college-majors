1201206,5,B00000F331,"I can't believe no one has reviewed this yet!  I think this is the best 80's Bowie video.  If you like Bowie, then you will LOVE this.  In this concert, Bowie and his kick-ass band play through a great song set.  His band includes the excellent Carlos Alomar on guitar, who comes out in the first couple of minutes and shows where Steve Vai and Joe Satriani got their ideas from, Carmine Rojas on bass, who along with the drummer, lay down incredible rhythm for every song, and of course, Peter Frampton, whose guitar is just excellent song after song. Bowie and Frampton are old school pals, and they used to hang out and play music when they were teens, where Bowie says Frampton was already an excellent guitarist--Bowie brings him along and kind of brings him back into the game here, and he delivers. Bowies vocals are incredible throughout.  He and a cast do try to do some theater/drama stuff, which sometimes is really cool, and sometimes kind of corny, but who cares?  It is the music that matters man.  enjoy.",1065484800,19,1019,4.565934065934066
1201375,1,B00000F331,I was exciting to get this DVD so i ignored the comments and i SHOULD'T have. It states English and yes it was done in Sydney Australia but the DVD is in fact NOT English. So if you get this just for the music fine but if you were looking forward to the extras and such you will be disappointed unless you speak the language this DVD was NOT said to be. I am so disappointed.,1391385600,5,375,3.9473684210526314

I bought the Glass Spider DVD sold by Sold by Rare Imports. Despite the Product Details claim of English Language and Region 1 compatibility, the text appears to be SPANISH or PORTUGUESE and it WILL NOT play in any of my DVD players.",1391299200,4,281,4.9787234042553195

1201381,3,B00000F331,"Comprei este DVD aqui no Brasil e realmente avalio que tem muito baixa qualidade em &aacute;udio e v&iacute;deo, bem como ocorre perda de sincronismo entre som e imagem no momento em que o editor ""junta"" as duas metades do show, e isso &eacute; lament&aacute;vel. Se o produto &agrave; venda na Amazon for de origem brasileira, desaconselho a compra. Tamb&eacute;m no entendo porque uma gravadora ""de peso"" ainda no lanou este t&iacute;tulo.",1153267200,,441,5.225352112676056
1201382,3,B00000F331,"I consider myself a dyed-in-the-wool Bowie aficionado, but the first time I say this video it was downright painful. Bear in mind, this is the video of the tour to promote ""Never Let Me Down"", widely regarded as probably Bowie's worst album (...o.k., with Hours a close second.) The entire set is pretentious and overdone. The fact that Bowie mines so many of the set pieces from 1980's Scary Monsters (A truly FANTASTIC album) is a confession of the weakness of the material. As is the grandstanding of Peter Frampton and Charlie Sexton (...currently residing in the ""where are they now?"" bin.) Bowie himself even admitted in an interview that the tour was a flop. (He blamed it on bad lighting--REALLY!!!) If anyone in charge of releasing Bowie videos is reading this, the tour to release on DVD is the ""Sound 'N' Vision"" Tour from 1991. Now THAT was a show with Bowie as his relaxed self, not the plastic yellow-blonde pop star of Serious Moonlight (...which he insisted be shot entirely on video, a fairly new technology at the time, and which looks like hell:  soft and gauzey!)",1077667200,10,1083,4.73015873015873
1201383,5,B00000F331,"This the best Bowie concert video hands down. I bought the VHS tape 10 years ago when it first came out. It actually had better sound than an import DVD version I bought (and sold).  The Brazilian DVD version is much better, but video quality just average. Why a good old american version has not been put out on DVD is a complete mystery to me.

In terms of the concert itself, what a show!  I suspect the Bowie ""purists"" put this one down because it's mainstream and too pop. It is...and his songs never sounded better.  Some even sound better than the original.  And the glass spider backdrop & theme is great.  Toni Basil arranged all the dance numbers. Unusual costumes and characters, but this is Bowie after all, and the stage dancing adds to the concert fun.  Peter Frampton rips it up on his guitar solos - one of the most under-rated guitarists on the planet.  Charlie Sextant joins in at the end for 3 numbers that require full volume to be fully appreciated!  This is Bowie at his peak in my view.",1072828800,11,1009,4.410810810810811
