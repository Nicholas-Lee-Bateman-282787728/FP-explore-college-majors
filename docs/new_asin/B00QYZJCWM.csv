Acting was non-existent. they replaced acting with looks or confusion. Fight scenes were pathetic, not very well rehearsed or choreographed. The DVD cover says it won Like 6 awards? No Way, Impossible. Never will I believe that again! This was not even remotely convincing. One fight sequence had comic book...whams and bams and whawacks?????? Really? The last fight had some really terrible camera effects.  I beg you not to bother with this drivel!",1439164800,,584,4.959183673469388
8693390,1,B00QYZJCWM,"I'ts been quite sometime since I had seen such a louzy movie. Not worth seeing at all, I was not able to finish it. The supposed awards on the cover must be a hoax.",1427155200,,164,3.8529411764705883
