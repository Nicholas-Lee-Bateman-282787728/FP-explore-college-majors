3704556,5,B001N0LEA6,"If you are like me, you have traveled the vegetarian or vegan road, and got lost always returning to a dinner table full of meat and processed food. Now with the help of this DVD, ""Beyond Raw: A Philosophy"" starring Robin Keiko Gregory, I think I have the information to keep me on that healthy highway of eating raw and eating the right foods for a longer, healthier life. This DVD takes you beyond vegetarianism and explains in detail how food has to have a balance. I have learned why certain foods go well with each other in a nutritional and spiritual manner. This DVD has left me with a new respect and knowledge of food and how food controls us and our society. Even if you are not a vegetarian, vegan, or raw person, this DVD will give you the knowledge to understand the people in your life that has chosen that lifestyle. If Amazon had more stars to rate this product, the rating would be 5+ infinity.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-Your-Best-Friend-Becomes-Your-Old-Friend-How-To-Care-For-Your-Geriatric-Canine/dp/1438251149/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When Your Best Friend Becomes Your Old Friend: How To Care For Your Geriatric Canine</a>",1232841600,9,1200,5.456989247311828

8322729,3,B001N0LEA6,There are much better ones out there but if you are a beginner in raw foods this might help to get you going.,1362441600,,109,3.782608695652174
8322730,5,B001N0LEA6,"This is a very spiritual and philosophical discussion with one of the top Raw Food intellectuals.  To say its deep is a vast understatement.

Of course there is a lot about Raw food, and its importance but it goes far beyond that into aspects of things that I had never even thought about in terms of the connection to raw food.

From health, to politics, to media, to the earth and much more, and its not just want you think, this is not a 'new age' discussion, its all tied to Raw Food, but on a level that you will not encounter with knowing or listening to Dorit.

On my 3rd viewing.

Note: These are 2 DVDs.",1255478400,,612,4.196581196581197
8322731,5,B001N0LEA6,"I usually don't order DVD's - being a book reading person - but wanted to hear more from Dorit after reading about her and hearing her on the radio.

After I watched the DVD, I felt so honored! This lady should be the ambassador for raw, green, and common sense! Forget Al Gore, etc, this lady has no hidden agenda, is very strong in her opinions, her logic, and optimism - yet she calls it like she sees it. I feel that I have gotten to know her now, as I have watched this DVD 2 times on my own, and so far once with friends, I am going to invite more people over to watch and discuss it.

Dorit on this DVD makes you THINK - for some who are not open to hearing opinions they don't like will not enjoy this program - be warned - this is a powerful message on many levels - it's not for the average TV watching American or 'weekend vegetarian'.

I can't recommend this DVD more strongly, and I'm going to continue to show it to intelligent, open friends.

Great, great work Dorit, thank you.",1247097600,,993,4.129533678756476
8322732,2,B001N0LEA6,"From the other reviews, I expected something really great. It should have cost no more than $10. Two amateur video sessions just interviewing someone who came across as smug and the two interviewers as idol worshippers. I hoped the 2nd CD would be longer and have more to say on a Raw lifestyle but it did not. If you are a groupie of this womans work than maybe it would be worth it-I still think it would cost too much. Very disappointed.",1245110400,5,440,4.378048780487805
8322733,5,B001N0LEA6,"I received this as a gift after my diagnosis with cancer and I have now returned to Raw, after a brief respite. The recipes are wonderful but more than that, the philosophy. Powerful DVDs. Perfect timing for this knowledge for me!",1242864000,9,230,4.634146341463414
8322734,5,B001N0LEA6,"I began looking at eating Raw food for my own health, and gradually began to see there was a lot more to it then just eating right.  A friend recommended this lady, Dorit, (who has only one name) and I found this DVD to listen to.

Wow!  She blew me away!  Much more then just a way to eat, its a way of life.  Watching these DVDs were like sitting at the feet of a philosopher and it was a treasure to listen to.

This 2 dvd set is a must for anyone who is raw, and anyone who is conscious of the planet, and of life.  It truly is wonderful.",1240444800,,542,3.828828828828829
8322735,5,B001N0LEA6,"One of the most brilliant women of our time.

Dorit is noting shore of genius.  A powerful communicator, an inspirational leader, a courageous fighter for freedom to live your life and enjoy health without state interference, a deep thinker and an agent for change.

This DVD should be seen.",1240185600,,291,4.8979591836734695
8322736,5,B001N0LEA6,"I'm just new into Raw, and wanted something that was more then just recipes, I wanted to know more about the why's and wonders of it - perhaps its a girl thing - but I did want to know about the philosophical side of Raw- and this DVD set (in HD) is very powerful.  Full of great stories, knowledge, its hard to describe, it took me places I had not thought of before.  If you are Raw, watch Dorit's video!",1239753600,3,406,4.0625
8322737,5,B001N0LEA6,"I was always impressed with the intellect, strength and knowledge of this wonderful Raw woman.  But it was not until I listened to both of these 2 DVD's (I did not realize it's a 2 DVD set when I ordered it) that I really understood the depth she has.  She is simply powerful!

If people think raw folks are a bunch of tired old hippies, they need to match wits with Dorit.  She is THE raw philosopher.

I now understand why others say she is humbling.

Powerful woman.",1237420800,6,469,4.2727272727272725
8322738,5,B001N0LEA6,"I feel truly blessed to have watched this presentation.  It's not only fun and entertaining, but powerfully intelligent and full of wisdom.

Much deeper then evey I expected, gave me so much to think about.  I will tresure this and pass it on to my loved ones.

Well recommended, this should be seen by ALL.

Thank you.",1236556800,,319,4.526315789473684
