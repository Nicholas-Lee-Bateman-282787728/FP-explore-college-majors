5696225,5,B00C7MW5CA,Two classic movies from the 80's.  Full of laughs and good humor.  Highly recommended.,1459555200,,86,5.071428571428571
5696226,4,B00C7MW5CA,This is a surprisingly good buy.  I remember watching both of these movies in theater in the late 1980's and enjoying them back then.  Uncle Buck is a very satisfying John Candy movie that can be watched several times without growing tiresome.  The surprise was that I could sit through a movie starring Chevy Chase.  Fletch was actually a decent movie that was worth watching once or twice.  Kudos to the manufacturer combining these two movies into a single package.,1443052800,3,468,4.8

8578233,5,B00C7MW5CA,Uncle Buck is a perfect 80's John Hughes style comedy.  Fletch is less than perfect but I think Uncle Buck more than makes up for what passes for comedy in this film.,1521158400,,166,4.1875
