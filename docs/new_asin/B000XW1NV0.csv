3009842,5,B000XW1NV0,"First of all, The product itself is increible. i watched the movie 5 times and it doesnt get old. it is incredible. the sellers who gave me the movie shipped it to me 1 day after order and it arrived 2 days later. it wasn't even express but it came immediately.",1198108800,2,261,4.137254901960785
3009843,5,B000XW1NV0,"This is a great climbing video. It documents many of Sharma's past acheivements through his most recent deep-water solo ascent. The adaquate funding for this video is reflected in its exotic locations, expert editing and quality film resolution.",1198108800,4,245,5.473684210526316
3009844,5,B000XW1NV0,The directors Josh/Peter have outdone themselves with this new outing. King Lines gets to the essence of climbing and entertains while doing it.,1196640000,,144,5.304347826086956
3009845,5,B000XW1NV0,This video is off the hook. Sharma is one of the most interesting climbers to me because of his philosophy and insane strength. This video illustrates both of these things very well.,1194739200,,182,4.71875
3009846,5,B000XW1NV0,"Beautiful film work. The scenery is breathtaking. The HD really adds to the quality. Chris Sharma really inspires the new generation of climbers to take climbing to a higher level. Chris is a pioneer who innovates the sport. He is a very humble individual who never gloats or boasts about his skill. He is an ideal role model and this movie clearly shows that. The music combined with the suspense of the ascent really puts the viewer on the ""edge"". I caught myself saying ""Whoah...now that is just crazy"". I recommend this video for all climbers(new and experienced) and for all nature lovers. Very inspirational.",1238544000,3,614,4.857142857142857
3009847,5,B000XW1NV0,King Lines is a great documentary film about the lifestyle of Chris Sharma.  It captures the very essence of Sharma's journey to climb the hardest routes in the world.  The music and personal narration of Sharma and the people that he interacts with complements the film well.  This is not merely a bunch of shots of Chris climbing up and down routes but an informative and thrilling documentary about how the world's best climber lives his life.  Great video and I would highly recommend it to any aspiring climbers.,1237593600,,517,4.775280898876405
3009848,3,B000XW1NV0,"Sharma is an incredible climber to watch and the video has some great shots of him climbing, but really tough to hold interest in their words.  A great video for incredible climbing, but very poor in script....",1231200000,,210,4.675675675675675
3009849,5,B000XW1NV0,"I was very happy with this video, I love watching chris sharma climb, he is just so good at it. This shows him going all over the world to some very exotic places and climbing things that have never been climbed or even seen before. There is a lot of amazing footage of sharma and his friends climbing, bouldering, and just having a good time. The video itself was put together very well, the editing was terrific. Awesome buy, definately worth the money.",1228521600,,455,4.493975903614458
3009850,5,B000XW1NV0,"Chris Sharma isn't great because he's the strongest, or because he has the best technique, or whatever else you can think of.  He's great because he believes he can climb anything if he tries hard enough...and he's right.  He has ""no knots in his mind"", as I've heard it said.  Sharma is great, the DVD is great, and the sound track is pretty bangin' too.",1222646400,,355,4.430769230769231
3009851,5,B000XW1NV0,the movie is awsome. it is filled with some intense climbing and great bouldering. i reccomend this movie if you wanna get motivated to go climb or you just wanna see some great moves.,1207440000,,184,4.4411764705882355
3009852,5,B000XW1NV0,Amazing climbing in amazingly beautiful places. David Graham lends some comic relief during his brief appearances.,1202601600,,114,6.1875
3009853,5,B000XW1NV0,"I've never purchased a rock climbing video or dvd before, so I didn't know what to expect.  I read reviews on Amazon and other web sites which repeatedly said this dvd was ""high quality"" and lacked the childish stunts apparently included in other climbing dvds.  After watching ""King Lines"", I have to agree.

When it first starts out, you get a lot of commercials and some kind of ""fast-editing"" introduction.  Thankfully, the rest wasn't like that.  You get to find out who Chris Sharma is.  He lives a life very different from most people.  He engages in a sport very different from most sports.

I would never do what he does, but for some reason, I am facinatated by it.  The things Chris and the other climbers do are just incredible, not to mention dangerous.  This video will teach you that to accomplish a goal, you must be passionate about it and never give up.  Tremendous job.

Highly recommended for anyone even remotely interested in rock climbing.  Makes an unusual and entertaining gift.",1199145600,14,1003,4.728323699421965
3009854,5,B000XW1NV0,This movie provides a balance between inspiring scenes of extremely technical climbing with insights into Chris Sharma's personal life.  Highly recommended for anyone that finds climbing to be a spiritual experience.,1198886400,8,216,5.967741935483871
3009855,5,B000XW1NV0,I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he LOVED it.  The camera angles and the production is very good.,1198713600,,111,4.285714285714286

8230038,5,B000XW1NV0,I recommend this DVD if you are new or experienced climber. It is very motivational and the footage is amazing.,1380067200,,111,4.6
8230039,5,B000XW1NV0,Great video.  Very motivational.  A video you can watch again and again.  It's amazing what the human body is capable of if pushed to its limits.,1373068800,,145,4.5
8230040,5,B000XW1NV0,"This Video follows Chris Sharma as he works on routes in the United States, South America, and Europe as he searches for the hardest routes in the world. There are plenty of falls that show the truly difficult nature of these routes not just the amazingly successful attempts. For example you get to see Sharma taking 60 to 80 foot lead falls as he skips 3-4 clips on one extremely difficult route.

It also has a quick bio overview of Sharma's life as a rock climber and his travels throughout the film.. The movie itself is just over an hour long but don't skip the extra footage section which adds another approx 25 minutes of fully edited with commentary video that was apparently cut from the main movie. Its good footage that has some Sharma but shows off many of the wonderful climbers that work these routes with Chris Sharma.

Don't be taken off guard by the sponsor shots at the start of the video. These climbing companies put up big cash to make the video happen and you get about 2 minutes of strait climbing company ads right at the start. After that its all movie though there are some clearly purposely shot zoom ins on shoes and other equipment made by the sponsors during the climbs.

A great video with fantastic routes that will motivate you, crazy falls that will impress, and some solid biography on the Micheal Jordan of Rock Climbing, Chris Sharma.",1362268800,,1372,4.569105691056911
8230041,5,B000XW1NV0,"This movie is a fascinating look at Chris Sharma and the world of high-level climbing. The cinematography is amazing and it's not just climbing stunts; really shows how Sharma works on those 5.15 climbs in the middle of the ocean! Fun for climbing kids too; there's one PG-language moment (Sharma's partner says ""I'm not your wall *itch"") but otherwise lots of inspiration for all ages!",1293580800,,386,4.953846153846154
8230042,5,B000XW1NV0,"By far this movie is one of my top 5 climbing movies. It captures awesome climbing, what climbing is all about, the quest for getting better and yet the zen-mind about climbing. Great movie, please buy it, you won't regret it.",1265932800,,226,4.536585365853658
8230043,5,B000XW1NV0,"Such a great movie! My boyfriend is obsessed with this guy (I got this movie for him for his birthday). I'm more into doing the climbing, than watching others do it for me. I have to say though, this is a good one. It is inspiring and drives you to want to climb more, climb better and set your sights higher. The film is well done, and not like other sponsored/low budget climbing films. There are some beautiful scenes and mind blowing shots in here!",1265155200,,452,4.329411764705882
8230044,4,B000XW1NV0,"Not as ""cool"" as the Dosages when it comes to ""thrills"" and more like a biography of Chris, but a unique glimpse of his amazing life as one of the very best climbers ever...with plenty of beautiful locations and great climbing...the DVD is a must-have...",1244419200,,254,4.666666666666667
