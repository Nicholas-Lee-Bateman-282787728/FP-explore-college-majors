At the end of the tape the credits start rolling but don't stop the tape! 4 more songs follow!
Get this video now...Frankie Avalon does a wonderful job as host and performer.",1010102400,2,412,4.5675675675675675
7880134,5,6304922531,"I admit it, I bought this video mainly to see The Supremes and was pleasantly wowed by the rest of the show too. It felt less like a show than a party where the audience is invited to watch. The Supremes feature  prominently singing three songs at least (Back In My Arms Again, You're  Nobody Till Somebody Loves You and I Feel Fine in the medley), and joining  Frankie Avalon when he sings Stop! In The Name of Love. My obsession with  them aside, there is also sensual Barbara McNair belting out When The Sun  Comes Out, Joanie Sommers trying to avoid being kicked by the male dancers  as she sings Don't Pity Me and a showcase on the Hullabaloo dancers that I  really loved. The dancing really is kinda cool, even if it is dated (Who  frugs anymore?) That kind of innocent energy of the sixties is sorely  lacking nowadays. I ran out and bought a Hollies CD after seeing them sing  Yes I Will in the Hullabaloo A Go-Go segment. The harmonies on that song  stick in your head. Other acts that were okay: Peter and Gordon (True Love  Ways), The Byrds (Mr. Tambourine Man, Feel A Whole Lot Better), Marianne  Faithfull (Come And Stay With Me). Acts that mostly stunk: Sam The Sham  & The Pharaohs (Wooly Bully) Yech, Sam's voice cracks halfway through  their hit song! They do better in the medley; Little Anthony & The  Imperials (Hurt So Bad) Yeah, it's a classic hit, but it's such a downer on  this show; The Nashville Teens (Tobacco Road) One-hit wonders that  thankfully faded into obscurity. It is also neat to see the artists  covering hit songs, like Frankie, Joanie and Barbara harmonizing on a  Beatles medley and TOP POPs with all the different guests singing the then  current hits. If you're a student of sixties style and music (or if you  love the early Supremes!) this is a treasure.",954201600,12,1800,4.507739938080495
7880135,5,6304922531,"Being a huge Supremes fan, I must say this is one of the best videos featuring all three girls.  This is not a showcase for Diane, but a wonderful group effort, with each one of them showing that something  special that made them the Supremes. Flo and Mary are prominently featured  throughout the video, displaying their own personalities and talents.  A  must have for any Supremes fan.",950400000,10,388,4.731343283582089
7880136,4,6304922531,"The performances of the original Supremes on this show captures their timeless magic.  Singing live, Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, Florence Ballard perform their new release, ""Back In My Arms Again"", as well as  the song that help break them into the supper club circuit, ""You're  Nobody Until Somebody Loves You"".
In the Tops Of The Pops segment,  the Supremes sing the Beatles ""I Feel Fine"" with Flo being  prominately featured, and they also do a special version of ""Stop In  The Name Of Love"" with host Frankie Avalon.  Unlike their recordings,  which featured primarily Diana Ross, all 3 Supremes can be distinctly heard  on this performances.
Other notable performers include The Byrds and  Little Anthony & The Imperials performing their classics ""Mr.  Tambourine Man"" and ""Hurt So Bad"", respectively.
The main  negative about this tape is the black & white kinescope recording  quality, as videotape recording hadn't been perfected yet when the show was  originally aired in 1965!",926294400,12,983,5.139240506329114
