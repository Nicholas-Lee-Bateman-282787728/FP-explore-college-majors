31353,5,078060718X,"Michael Tolkin, the writer and director of this film has acheived something truly remarkable: he has made an astonishing modern tragedy from the pat phrases - usually so mind-numbingly banal, even infantile - of  Born-Again Christianity. He does this by treating it all with a surprising  unflinching respect, allowing us to grasp the world from within that closed  system of beliefs, never stooping to condescension. Tolkin asks the simple  question: what if the day of judgement were to come soon - and exactly in  the way that Fundamentalists believe it will - what would we do? Or more  importantly, what should we think about the nature of God's bargain with  the world? (If Abraham had had to sacrifice Isaac, would he still have been  able to love God? Or would he have cursed him?)
Out of this Tolkin  manages to wring a truly profound tragic meditation on the nature of faith  and sacrifice, all set against the most bland, low-mimetic, presentation of  the world imaginable. Mimi Rodgers is extraordinary and deserved an award.  But the greatest star must be the script. There is no word for it but  'genius'.",946339200,10,1119,4.857142857142857

31355,4,078060718X,"This film portrays & embraces the contradictions in one woman's soul & life path.  I was impressed by the seriousness with which her spiritual journey & apocalyptic beliefs were treated.  The mainstream  media tend to denigrate & deride the fundamentalist faith &  ""true believers"", portraying them as crossburning rednecks,  hopeless losers, or manipulative & materialistic entrepeneurs running  their religious scams.  The picture was obviously made on a tiny budget but  realized its vision of the apocalypse convincingly & powerfully.  The  director's courage in leaving the final scene as he did is all too  uncommon.  While neither a Christian nor a believer in the apocalypse  depicted in Revelations, I was moved.  Caveat: To get anything out of this  film watch it with respect for the characters & their beliefs: just go  with the flow. It's a hell of a ride!

31412,5,078060718X,"I've looked in vain for a DVD of this for years and years. It's not comfort viewing, but it captures a form of self-disgust and a desire to change better than any film I can think of offhand. And it's clever as well as intelligent: just when we've become fully invested in the fates of the protagonists, it abruptly pulls the rug out from under them and us. Don't worry; there's no proselytizing here. If anything, religion is less a topic than a metaphor for the high -- the exorbitant? -- cost of willing a moral or ethical life in a relentlessly secular consumer culture. All the performances are top-notch, but it's Mimi Rogers's movie, and she meets the challenge convincingly. David Duchovny has never struck me as an expressive actor, but he's up to the task he's set here. Anything more risks crossing into spoiler territory, which certainly isn't my intention. So i'll end by saying, ""Watch it!"" ""Watch i!"" ""Watch it!""",1477699200,4,927,4.693251533742331

31501,4,078060718X,"Fatalistic film features a distraught and unhappy mid-career woman (played superbly by Mimi Rogers) who spends her weekends drowning her sorrows in meaningless ""sexcapades"" and orgiastic behavior, clearly a woman who is not ""satisfied"" in more than the physical sense. She gets a knock on her door from some Evangelical boys who convince her that the Lord is on his way soon, and before you can say Jerry Falwell she is under the spell of a mysterious quickening of spirit that convinces her that Jesus may be coming back sooner than the world thinks (her final previously promiscuous lover, played by the X-Files standby David Duchovny, has an especially tragic and memorable role in her life). After much searching of spirit she finally decides to take her daughter out to the desert to look for signs of the Second Coming, and signs she does indeed witness...
As a film critic, I cannot quite make up my mind about Michael Tolkin. He is unquestionably an ingenious satirist (I still enjoy the ""lightweight"" humor of THE PLAYER) but I wonder if he doesn't have more quality dramatic material within him that Hollywood is simply too afraid to touch (the fact that THE RAPTURE got made at all is a triumph in itself). In the rather disappointing audio commentary track (with the exception of some fun comments from Duchovny and Rogers) Tolkin doesn't explain in much detail the story's genesis, but I gather that he was taken with the fiery rhetoric of the Baptist strain of Christian eschatology and dispensational truth, and he set out to write a story that would examine the paradox of religious faith in the world of the secular West (the fact that Christians are upset by this movie is simply more proof that they are incapable of separating the sin from the sinner, at least in terms of their seemingly hateful condemnation against ""sinners""). But Tolkin's THE RAPTURE is smarter than any other religious picture I have watched because it doesn't tell a viewer how to think about the paradox of the scriptures and those seeking God's love but rather it shows one the journey that a person takes from sinner to a person of faith, and it examines the psychology of the Rogers character in a lot of menacing detail. And the ending...despite its tragedy, I really did like it and I found it quite chilling. I found the Rogers character to be fascinating because she is not trying to undo the shackles of religious indoctrination imposed upon her but rather trying to find a way to fit into those beliefs after having lived life in a wholly nihilistic fashion beforehand. It is too bad that Tolkin probably won't be allowed to make more expensive films because he can draw solid performances out of his actors and he can tell gripping emotional stories.
The DVD offers terrific picture and sound (this was made in 1991) and it is (to my knowledge) the complete version of the film. So if you are not easily offended by religious stories that look at things from a different perspective and you want to see something unique, let THE RAPTURE take you up tonight.

31548,3,078060718X,"There was something to upset everyone in this film, but it was a more intelligent treatment of religion than, for example Bill Mahars ""Religulous"" or the comedy farce ""Dogma.""  Of course, that's not saying much.

I have no pity for those one-star raters who did not bother to note the R rating or read it PLAINLY at the beginning of the film.  Outraged claimers that it was not a ""family film"" or ""for children"" should hang their heads in shame at their own stupidity. Go ahead and run the DVD through a meat-grinder or whatever floats your boat.

It is easy to take cheap shots at religion in any movie, it is another thing to showcase the problem of extreme people who search for meaning and the dark places they find along the way.  This film attempts that, and it is up to you and your beliefs to decide whether it succeeds or fails.

The main character is in a true mindless dead-end job with no explanation how she got into the world of call-centers. Her attitudes towards ""hooking up"" (very casual sex) is self-destructive. I'm not sure why they felt her actions needed to be on display so graphically and within minutes of the film starting. I guess subtlety was not the goal.

When she gets inspired to find out more about her relationship with God, she does not seek out more of the mainstream belief systems, asking questions of a Rabbi, Priest or Pastor.  Instead she finds herself in the company of what I would consider fringe groups with their own child-prophet.

Is she going mad or is she a God-drunken fool that may someday do saintly things?  I won't say any more.

A fine cast of actors with some dialog that was good, but other parts sounding like they were lifted from the script of some low-budget ""end of days"" film done by a religious group with no movie making experience.

Perhaps best enjoyed by those studying religion or more likely comparative religion.  For a lot of people, it will just be an annoyance. This is not a put-down of those people, but this film may end up just being a confused mess that too many people took too seriously, like the early 70's film ""The Magus.""

THE RAPTURE: Theres got to be more to life than being a phone company operator by day and a swinger by night. At least thats what Sharon (Rogers) suspects. She needs a new direction in her life, to fill the void inside her. Suicide is an acceptable alternativeuntil she dreams of The Pearl, and accepts Jesus Christ into her heart. There is a God, and Im going to meet him, she determines. I want my salvation.

Her conversion costs her her old life, but brings her into a circle of evangelical Christians awaiting the imminent Apocalypse of the Book of Revelations. She marries Randy (Duchovny) and raises her daughter Mary to believe these are the Final Days. But bad things happen to good people; when God takes Randy early, visions invite the girls into the desert to await His call. They go, and wait. And wait... And wait... Obviously shes nuts. But what if shes right?

Discussion: Its difficult to name many films like this, in which Biblical predictions come literally truebut its a safe bet to say this is the best of the lot. While the interpretation of Biblical passages is taken literally by the characters, the film itself is a metaphor for a meditation on faith in a faithless age. Is Sharon experiencing religious conversion or a nervous breakdown? Is she just doing God instead of doing drugs? Are her convictions faith or fanaticism? The movie refuses to admit to easy answers, and even goes so far as to pose the ultimate chilling question: What if, in spite of all logic, the Fundamentalists are correct, and the Day of Reckoning is indeed at hand?

The plot of The Rapture is so astonishingly original that we can never predict or even guess the twists it takes; the film itself is slow but mesmerizingly tense, glowing with luminous photography and suffused with an ethereal spirit, ending in a hallucinatory nightmare of black magical realism. Traces of Abraham and Job can be detected, and Marys Sermon on the Mount is a terrifying masterpiece of logic at odds with religionan awe-striking high point of the drama. The heart of this film, however, is the ultimate question of faith: How can one love a God whod murder his own son?",1422921600,6,2409,4.634660421545667

Everyone expects the rapture, well most everyone that claim they are religious, but what if even the most faithful become cynical because no rapture happens despite world events? She wants to believe so badly but grows weary with waiting and waiting and waiting. Then, after giving up all hope and rejecting the idea of the rapture, it happens. But too late for Mimi. She has already lost all faith. A sex addict turn religious, then facing the worse life has to offer to test ones faith, Mimi commits the ultimate sin after losing her faith and realizing for her the rapture is just wishful thinking. Not too unlike many Christians of today, I would think. Christians expecting better in life, rewards for their faith, but instead constantly handed a can of worms for their faithful efforts. This is not a religious film as it were, but more so a drama about a lady trying to turn her life around by doing what is expected of her. Lost in her go-nowhere job, growing weary of her empty sex exploits, she is seeking a little magic to turn her life around and break the boredom. She then looks to religion for that break and meaning to her life. But she finds that too, ie religion, will let her down as well. Definitely 5 stars for acting, cast, and originality of theme.

Hey, lets try to so offend our target audience that they will smash the DVD before we even try to speak our message.  To say that the early nudity and sex scenes are gratuitous is an understatement.  You can communicate sexual decadence without swinging boobs and sundry body parts filling the camera lens.  There are great themes here that I will never be able to discuss with my adult sunday school class.  Themes about how a beautiful thing like religious conversion can become toxic with no or poor spiritual guidance.  About how faith guided only by emotional experiences without seeking wisdom or reflection can even become murderous.

Mimi Rogers transition from a life of hedonism to one of piety is fascinating to watch.  While I couldn't relate to the extremes she went to, her quest for some undefinable thing missing from her life is something that resonated.

The fact that Hollywood used them to represent to bring the message of the salvation of Christ showed me that they did not know what they were talking about since the Mormons believe that Christ and Satan are brothers and do not represent the bible but they represent the Book of Mormon. They did quote some scripture correctly but the dream of the pearl was just way too out there for me. I threw the movie in the trash.

31881,5,078060718X,"I first saw The Rapture at a theater in Vegas. It's the only movie I've ever seen, where people remained in the lobby afterwards and discussed the film. It was that powerful and thought provoking. It was empowering that someone had the nerve to be brave and write a film that showed how dangerous religion is. I related to the character ""Sharon"" played by Mimi Rogers. I have a fundy in the family, who is just as overzealous as Sharon is at first... except Sharon, after doing terrible things in the name of God, finally wises up and tells her sort of love interest policeman, that God has too many rules. Although by this time she's gone past the point of no return. But one of the rules involes how do I say this gracefully, kissing God's butt to get into heaven. Sharon is not having any of it. God must have sure been shocked when she looked him in the eye and said I don't think so. Even her daughter urging her to just give it up already and tell God/Jesus you love him, doesn't help. Sharon stands her ground and refuses to tell God the magic words. Good for her!  The film is unlike anything you will ever see. I read most of the other reviews with bemusement. What experts these one star reviewers are in all things regarding God. The film challenges people and the notion of the unfair mean fairytale that has lingered like smog for thousands of years. Sharon isn't crazy. She feels empty inside and instead of taking a few steps to improve and live a better way of life, she goes from one drug to another. I just ordered the DVD of The Rapture and I for one am going to watch it again and again. I'm not going to get the vapors and throw it into the trash. But just a helpful hint, the DVD will make an excellent frisbee if your nerves can't handle all the sex and grody stuff in the first half hour. Oh, well. The Devil made me do it. Hail Satan.

31905,5,078060718X,"This is a film which irradiates the life changing events of a woman who finds that in accepting Christianity and becoming ""born again"" she can escape her former life. Sharon, a telephone operator, is unhappy with her mundane job. She amuses herself at night by drinking, getting high and engaging in sexually sordid; uninhibited behaviors with her ""swing"" partner Vic. While she fills her nights with one night stands, she is unfulfilled and lonely.

 The film moves very quickly in the beginning. Sharon overhears a conversation in the break room at work which peaks her curiosity, some of the employees are whispering about the rapture. Then she gets a visit from two believers spreading the word who leave her with some profound questions and a New Testament.  It's not long before she meets Randy on one of her nightly excursions with Vic. This is when we see Sharon's first sign of her desire to change.

She begins seeing Randy (whom she discovers has murdered a man for money) exclusively and she becomes repulsed by Vic's continued sexual activity.  She begins to question her lifestyle and wants to change. After a failed attempt at suicide, she accepts Christ and because of this she rids herself of everything and everyone connected with her sordid past. She soon convinces Randy to make the change with her and accept Christ. They are married and have a child, Mary. They attend church meetings together under the teachings of a boy prophet who tells the group of the impending rapture.

Sharon's faith is tested when Randy is murdered by a disgruntled former employee. Sharon believes her dreams are telling her to go to the dessert and wait with Mary to be raptured. In obedience she takes her daughter to wait on GOD. When they aren't raptured, Mary begs her mother to let her die so she can go to heaven. Sharon shoots Mary, killing her. She intends to kill herself, but, suicide is a sin that will prevent her from going to heaven.

A policeman named Foster, who befriended Sharon and Mary ends up being the one to have to arrest Sharon after she confesses to the murder of her daughter. While in jail awaiting her punishment, the Rapture begins, and all the prisons cell gates collapse freeing the prisoners. Foster and Sharon return to the dessert where they are raptured. Foster who was skeptical of GOD in his life sees Mary and listens to her when she asks him to accept the Love of GOD and enter heaven. Sharon refuses to relinquish her feelings of anger and disappointment in the loss of her husband and daughter. She denounces GOD and the opportunity to be with HIM.

The film ends with Sharon in a dark; desolate place of loneliness. This was a great film. I viewed it twice. This a good film for those students interested in Christianity or, who have questions about salvation and forgiveness. The film not only enlightened me to some of the beliefs and principles of being ""born again"", but also in the transformation that happens to people when they commit themselves to a life of faith. I saw a woman who had a lifetime of disappointments fill with hope and happiness.

31935,5,078060718X,"This is truly one of the best films made about FAITH and what role it plays in Christianity. As the story begins we meet Sharon, played by Mimi Rogers, a bored telephone operator who finds excitement by having sexual encounters with strangers. Slowly, she finds these sexual games less fulfilling and at the same time begins to notice that people around her, particularly her colleagues, are finding solace in their belief that the ""Second Coming"" of Christ is imminent. She then becomes torn between her old life that offers temporary solace and the new one that seems to offer spiritual fulfillment. Finally she, along with a past lover Randy, played by David Duchovny, marry and join this group and are ""reborn"". This is just the beginning of a long road of belief, tragedy, belief and disillusionment. For me it reminded me of the popular question, ""Why do bad things happen to good people?"" and generally how much can an pious individual take before questioning the actions of God or the universe. The final scenes of this film are earth shattering in every sense of that phrase. This is one of those films that you will continue to think about long after it is over.

31970,4,078060718X,"I wanted to re-watch this film as I have not seen it since it first appeared in 1991 and many video stores do not carry it as it is something of a eccentric choice and non-traditional entertainment. It is a movie that has stayed with me, however, despite its flaws or limitations (which are easy to forgive because of its ambitions). How you feel watching this film may have a good deal to do with your own position on Christianity. If you are a non-believer and someone who has turned away from faith in God because of legalism and rules you were exposed to in your own life's journey, the movie seems to offer a strong anti-apolegetic, the case against a loving God. But as someone who first saw the film in that context and now after a series of isolating or separating life experiences has reclaimed my own personal faith in Christ, this film does appear less of a portrait about the limits of faith then about the peril of self-delusion. Here's how I see the film or the main character of Sharon played by Mimi Rogers (who does an excellent job). She works a telephone information operator in a place where others employed there are involved in a secretive cult that they discuss in hushed tones in the breakroom. She is also a woman who seeks pleasure and dominance in the world through sexual adventure but loses affection for that lifestyle and chooses in her emptiness to try God. In the struggle to free herself, she has a pure spiritual encounter with God reading a Bible in a motel room where she has narrowly escaped being a victim of dangerous hitchhiker she has picked up. Unfortunately, the authenticity of her conversion (Which I think the films presents without mockery and as a genuine moment of transformation) is doomed. Instead of applying the same rational watching skepticism she has displayed in her swinging lifestyle, she now confuses a cult led by the revelations of a child prophet as the embodiment of God's True Church. She does not study God's Word in full, she focuses on the end days and apocalyptic revelation when as a new child of faith she needs apply patience and discernment of false prophecies and beliefs. The end result is when she is faced with a horrific test of her unsteady faith through the grief of losing her husband (an admittedly, tough test for even a well rooted believer), she embarks along with her daughter on a literal death march. Where she loses her faith is in her shift and reversal of the direction she is traveling on as one of a sinner redeemed on a path towards God. By holding desperately in her grief to her childish beliefs which assume she has been given a gnostic sign to know within days the exact timing of the Rapture, she enter herself into a risky spiritual misadventure (going to the desert with her daughter to await a moment only God in Heaven knows, not even Christ himself), she makes an equally disturbing flip. She now is standing in the desert, quite literally demanding that God travel to her. This is testing God, a clear temptation from the Enemy that Jesus resisted and warned against. You can see how badly she has lost it when you hear the anger in her voice telling her tired hungry daughter ""Let's give God one more chance!"" Whoah! If she had been brought forward in her early faith well rooted in a real church and not a cult, she would know better than to go to that dark place of judging God by her own limited shadowy understanding of the world He created and is alone in comprehending fully. Once she crosses that line, God knowing her peril and forgiving her ignorance, sends her repeated signs and revelations through her daughter to plead with her. This is where I think the film falls short of what I feel could have been an opportunity for greatness and where as a believer I see the film departs from what as a biblical follower I believe God does with the doubting and the hurting. God does not send a child to do a grown-up work. I wish the police officer character of Will had been the wise believer who could have presented the more reasoned view of faith that Sharon needs to find if she is to back away from her angry attempt to dominate God. In the Book of Job, Job in all his difficulties and afflictions and trials, thoroughly questions why God even gave Him life in the first place. God answers Job. He doesn't send a child to say ""C'mon, love God?? Don't you love God?"" My experience is that God can and will answer hard heartfelt questions. He does not duck them nor does He tell us to just hurry up, suck it up and love Him no matter what we are struggling with.  The film seems to at this point to error on leaving it open to wonder if it's God that's the self-absorbed narcissist and not a willful woman who insists on dominating God in spiritual matters the way she once did lustful men in sexual matters. But to quote several wise earlier lines from the film. ""Only the humble hear the voice of God."" And when Sharon is first evangelized earlier in the film by door to door missionaries (not those in the cult she gave herself over to in her early faith), she asks them if they know about ""The Boy"" (the child prophet of her co-worker's mysterious sect she is yet to be accepted into), their wise words go unheeded. ""Yes, we have heard of him. There are others too like him."" Sharon: ""Should I trust him (""The Boy"")?"" Missionary: ""I would trust God."" In other words, trust in God's Word and study it. Jesus said ""be wise as serpents and innocent as doves"". This movie is an excellent cautionary tale for those who are enchanted by false belief systems masquerading as God's Church. It would be, however, unfortunate if in seeing and sympathizing with the character of Sharon, those who are agnostic chose to overlook that its her loyalty to her own certainty in her cult-inspired beliefs that separate her from a mature understanding of God and the ability to be fully reconciled with Him for all that she has suffered as a result of those beliefs and not God's harsh ""rules"" which never required her to do the horrific choices she alone chose to make.",1326672000,5,6072,4.514986376021798
31971,5,078060718X,"Once upon a time there was a breed known as independent filmmakers. Usually with shoestring budgets, the indies, taking no prisoners, discarded business plans, forgot to look at marketing strategies, and the image of a proposed target audience was as abstract and surreal to them as their films often were to audiences. The indies were decidedly reactionary to the Hollywood institution. Maya Deren once said ""I make films for what Hollywood spends on lipstick."" It was the indies who were progressively harking back to the dawn of cinema, before the rules of filmmaking had been established and canonized.

Stanley Kubrick was the closest Hollywood would get to the indie spirit, but Kubrick, for all his aesthetic brilliance, was, essentially, an academic. Whatever Kubrick's genre, be it sci-fi, porn, horror, war, swashbuckler, his approach stemmed from a safe classroom distance. Kubrick lacked the fevered intensity and aesthetic struggle of the indies, and subjects such as horror and sex were rendered as studies and, therefore, matters on somewhat safe critical ground for the mainstream.

Newly minted and authorized film critics, such as Roger Ebert, would lavish heaps of praise on Dr. Kubrick, but Ebert was clearly out of his ivory towered ball park when trying to grasp the likes of Larry Cohen`s God Told Me To or Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate, which is unfortunate considering Ebert once scripted for Hollywood outsider Russ Meyer.

The 1990s was the last real decade of the independents. Even by then, they were becoming an extinct breed, and in their place were the new breed of timid indie-lites, who merely emulate the Hollywood recipe without having the budget for the high priced, bland ingredients.

In 1991 Michael Tolkin's The Rapture did what an independent film is supposed to do: took critics by surprise. Some critics even managed praise. Tolkin followed this success with The New Age in 1994 and then, unfortunately, disappeared from the radar. The Rapture came on the heels of the previous year's Begotten (1990, E. Elias Merhige), and both are films with spiritually organic testicles.

Sharon (Mimi Rogers, in a mesmerizing role) works as a telephone operator by day.  It is a mind-numbingly monotonous job.  By night, she likes to have sex and she has it passionately.  Sharon plays the swinging game, seeking out new adventures and new partners.  Swinging, however, is becoming as robotic as her day job, because, despite her passion, Sharon is seeking something more.  She is seeking a personally relentless communication which at first she thought she might find through the amorous escapades of the night.

One day at work, Sharon overhears Christian co-workers talking about a dream of a pearl.  The pearl is something akin to an allegorical hymn for the world's end.  To Sharon, it appears that those who dream of the pearl find God and the meaning of life.  Sharon tries to pass herself off as a Christian, but it's a bit like someone pretending to be drunk, and her co-workers see through it.

A couple that Sharon swings with cease a night of sex long enough to speak of the Pearl, which one of them has tattooed on her back.  Christian proselytizers show up at Sharon's door, trying to convert her, and they too speak of the Pearl.  Through the vision of the Pearl, Sharon believes God is calling out to her.  Sharon is in anguish.  One lover abandons her.  Randy (David Duchovny), another lover, argues with her.  Randy is an atheist, who once murdered for money; he sees no meaning at all in life, and compares Sharon's God-seeking to a heroin addict looking for a fix.

Sharon finally has the religious experience for which she has been yearning.  Like an overzealous, sanctimonious twelve year old girl at Vacation Bible School, the newly reborn Sharon begins proselytizing to callers at work.  Sharon's boss, himself a Christian, tells Sharon there is a time and place for everything, but not at work.  Sharon knows now that her life must be clean for God.

The power of great sex prevails and Randy, seeing the light of God, marries Sharon.  They have a child and join a fundamentalist group, bonding with those who want to understand God and his plans.  All too briefly, Randy becomes Sharon's sole personal connection and provides the life she seeks.  Tragedy prevails, however, and bathos rears its ugly head as Sharon is put through several tests.  Her life is thrown into a frenzied quagmire.  Believing she knows God's intention, Sharon commits a heinous crime when she feels God has failed to deliver his promise.  When all seems lost, the dreaded apocalypse literally comes true and Sharon faces a choice.  Will she profess her love for her heavenly Father or not?

Sharon faces the same dilemma that Job faced, but for Sharon, God is no different than those countless lovers from one night stands so many years before.  God screwed her, but he would not give her the personal communication that she needed.  God used her and took away everything she loved.  When Sharon called out for an answer, God turned his back to her and merely said, ""You must still love me.""

The Rapture is about free will, and that includes free will to love or reject the idea of the divine.  Sharon remains fiercely independent in the tradition of Bizet's Carmen.  She is not afraid of the consequences, even in the threat of a purgatorial eternity.  Sharon's life and choices are startling.  She is a stupid, proud, passionate woman who has the audacity to tell God, ""I knocked and the door was not opened.  I am a stupid woman, but it's your fault I'm stupid because I asked for wisdom and you denied me.  I will take the purity of my heart over your cold mind and I will not worship the likes of so selfish a lover.""

Of course, Sharon is as selfish as she believes God to be, but she no longer expects to be loved. The Rapture harshly embraces a defiantly feminine spirituality which rejects the barren, patriarchal idea of God.

Like the late Mary Daly, Sharon goes ""Beyond God the Father,"" and that is simultaneously liberating for her and her downfall, because she approaches her liberating moment with the black and white extremes which have characterized her entire life.

In the Gospel of John, the apostles are instructed to ""Go and spread the Good News.""  News is always new and The Rapture takes a new and refreshing approach to a subject which, more often than not, is hopelessly pious, stagnant and, ultimately, saccharine.  This is one of the most challenging, humanistic and Christian films of the last twenty years.

I did not realize that I would have to forward through the first half of the movie. At first,I thought it was miss-labeled or some sort of parody making fun of Christians who believe in the Rapture.

 I saw the R rating label, but I believed that was because the movie might have a little more kick that might offend some more conservative or younger viewers. The labeling was deceiving & not explicit enough. There was full blown nudity & depraved sexual acts. For a moment, before fast forwarding through *multiple scenes* of sex acts, I felt like I was watching a Porno Flick!!

Yes, this movie talks about Christianity & one woman's struggle & journey, but most of the Christians in this movie are Robotic or Cultish. They are not portrayed in a very positive light. Anyone who is truly a devout believer & follower of Christ and knows the true word of God may feel offended by this film. On the other-hand; if you are not, you may be encouraged to watch & you just may love this film.

This film sends out conflicting & mixed signals!!

32009,5,078060718X,"You will either love or hate The Rapture. There is hardly any middle ground here. If nothing else, you will find yourself shaking your head in disbelief.  Michael Tolkin is a fantastic screenwriter/director although I don't know exactly what he intended for us to walk away with from this film but it's a powerful work nonetheless & a very difficult film to review.

Mimi Rogers is, quite simply, captivating in her role as a bored telephone operator seeking deeper meaning in her life outside of work & the illicit activties. Eventually, she finds a religious sect who preach firmly about the end of time. It would seem her life is about ready to turn around. She marries a man who also accepts her faith, has a beautiful daughter, & lives the life that most only dream about.

After the tragic death of her husband, she is beckoned to the desert with her young daughter in where her descent into madness is set. From there on, we get the full, almost sinister treatment which will ultimately lead to some very tragic consequences.

The Rapture really grabs it's viewer by the horns & won't let go. The entire film experience is one not soon forgotten irregardless of whether you follow any specific religious guidelines or not. I found myself in tears by the end of the film & even surprisingly laughing at times at some of the near satyrical dialogue. This is really divulging a lot here as I was brought up in the Protestant church & I'm sure no one I attended sunday school with would approve of such a film.

If you are looking for a film which will garner much discussion, look no further. The Rapture will draw heated debates from Christians/Non-Christians alike. Again, I'm not sure what the writer's intentions were but I do know that the script  dares to venture where few others ever would attempt & I don't think Mimi Rogers was ever blessed with a role quite as meaty again. I have to give her props on this one as so many other actresses read the script & turned it down.",1309219200,8,1986,4.564606741573034
32010,5,078060718X,"I saw ""The Rapture"" once again after the world didn't end on May 21st and was even more amazed the second time by its visionary artistry twenty years after its release in 1991.  Heroine Sharon's job as telephone operator number 134 in an anonymous cubicle anticipates the sometimes dehumanizing Information Age with its Internet and social media sites.  The theme of social fragmentation is underscored by the many drifters who arrive in LA from all over the country and the swinger scene in which Sharon engages during the first part of the film.

Here we witness a milieu still all too familiar to us Angelenos of beautiful interiors and chic black clothing, of style without substance.  I know so many younger people who, like Sharon and her fellow believers in the Rapture, yearn to exchange this empty Tinseltown life through service to others and the Lord.

As is proper for a spiritual film, allegories and dualities abound.  ""Rapture"" can refer to both sexual and religious ecstasy.  Names seem very significant.  Sharon and her daughter Mary perhaps represent Judaism and Christianity.  Lover/husband Randy may exemplify aggressive male sexuality, while Deputy Foster's surname suggests masculinity's nurturing and protective aspects.  All of these characters evoke love and commitment in its many and varied forms which often conflict with one another.

The film brilliantly shows the terrible price which we mortals can pay for these very attempts at holy love and commitment.  Randy's well-meaning efforts to help an unstable alcoholic employee result in his murder.  This in turn triggers Sharon's shooting of little Mary so the child can join her father in Heaven.

So many of us adults in search of an ethical compass have also felt like rats in a maze, eternally begging our God for guidance and mercy in a world which He or She barely allows us to understand.  No wonder Deputy Foster retreats to the desert and doesn't want to give up his gun.  Hell can indeed be other people and the living may envy the dead.

In the role of Sharon Mimi Rogers shows utterly remarkable depth and range.  Her incandescent performance reminded me of Susan Sarandon's evolution from Hollywood starlet to the nun in ""Dead Man Walking"" to the feminist vigilante in ""Thelma and Louise"" during a mere 100 minutes of screen time.  Flashes of humor and wit relieve the story's appropriately somber tone. The movie's taut scripting and editing plus its fully motivated use of sex, violence, and special effects in turn recalled another of my favorite existential dramas, BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT with Randy's murderer as the Joker.

This film may impart to viewers the courage to give God one more chance again and again in spite of life's many punishments.  I expect to re-view and reflect upon ""The Rapture's"" intensely thought-provoking messages for many years to come as I mature.",1309046400,3,2876,5.012631578947368

32012,5,078060718X,"What a great review, K. Harris! It's nice to read the opinions of someone who finds as much depth in this film as I do. I agree with you on many points; the film is underrated, probably because as you said, ""Religion is not a very fashionable topic."" Having been raised in a religious, Christian home and having since become non-religious, I find this film so rich. The imagery (angels baring flaming swords and the innocent, child prophet) seem biblical, and the plot is in some ways 100% typical of Christian mythology, especially Evangelical mythology. Here's a true ""lost"" soul, wandering through the ""wilderness"" until she experiences God and her whole life is changed.

For me, however, the film is about blind faith and its seductive powers, and this is made clear by the final scenes. Sharon has bought into the church with every ounce of her being. Her newfound deep sense of peace is palpable. She has found a panacea, but the costs are high. After her conversion, she never questions because that would show a lack of faith. She is a sheep. However, ultimately she chooses to practice her free will, and she refuses a god who is vengeful and obtuse.

I love this film because it raises more questions than it answers. How can Christians justify our free will with the existence of an omnipotent God, who has an ultimate plan which we don't need to question or try to understand? Why would a god create the human race with abilities to think and reason, not to mention our drives and desires, simply to ask to give up all of these things where he is concerned?",1306540800,2,1570,4.623655913978495
32013,4,078060718X,"Do not read this if you have not yet seen this fine little film starring the incredibly gorgeous Mimi Rogers. The only thing that I have to say about it is concerning the last quarter of the film. After Sharon's husband Randy (David Duchovny) is murdered by a troubled co-worker, she sees pictures coming out of a machine which show him beckoning to her from a desert. She interprets this as a calling from God....that is the beginning of her fall from grace. The Devil is actually using her grief against her. OR....GOD is testing Sharon's faith. The saddest part is when she grants her daughter, Mary's wish to see her daddy in Heaven by shooting her. From that point on, she ultimately feels completely betrayed by God and literally condemns herself to Hell after the Rapture comes. Ultimately, she loses the whole concept of what it means to have your faith tested. Even Jesus himself cried out, ""Father, why have you forsaken me"", shortly before he died on the cross. I really doubt that any believer would have chosen the same fate that Sharon did. Especially after talking TWICE with her deceased daughter. She loses the whole concept of what ""It's a question of faith"" is all about. It really should not have ended the way that it did.",1302998400,,1243,4.654545454545454

32042,1,078060718X,"Just caught the movie this week on SyFY channel. I was expecting a monster movie. Because it starred David Duchovny, I kept waiting for the trick ending. In the end, I felt tricked

The movie sets up Christians as simpletons worshipping a cruel god who will not take his heel off your neck until you say you love him. The heroine refuses to 'say uncle' and gets zapped as a reward

It is a grim movie used to play out the various arguments against the existence of the god of the Christians. If your God loves us, why does He let good people die horrible deaths etc. Assumption: if your God loves us, He owes us

The film uses the most literal interpretation of I Thessalonian: 16-17 (For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord) which is called 'the rapture' by many Christians.

The usage 'rapture' is derived from 'rapiemur' in St Jerome's latin Vulgate translation of verse 17 : ""deinde nos qui vivimus qui relinquimur simul rapiemur c*um illis in nubibus obviam Domino in aera et sic semper cu*m Domino erimus""

'rapiemur', is a form of the verb 'rapio' - snatch, seize, carry off

Since Americans in particular understand 'rapture' to imply ecstasy and joy, the use of 'rapture' to explain various apocalyptic explanations of Thessalonians, Joel etc gives Bible bashers a weapon to make their arguments about an unjust god, and the fools who believe in him. Some rapture, suckers

The physical interpretation of some end times doctrine/dogma in the film is well done and has a shocking effect. When the trump sounds, literally, it is haunting, and the horsemen of the apocalypse are intense. The director created some powerful images with the lesser animation capabilities of the era. The specter of death has that effect

As propaganda it is heavy handed but should give satisfaction to the ones who have a need to see their beliefs reinforced by a fantasy.

Myself, I felt I wasted a lot of time watching Duchovny, expecting any minute a trick ending, some space aliens, or at least a few mutants",1288224000,7,2277,4.602469135802469

The genius here is in the writer/director's ability to make a Christian see it as Christian, and a non-Christian to see it as a subtle, scathing rebuttal of the faith. That surely cannot be easy to accomplish. My own personal take is that it illustrated that one of ""Sharon's""  (Mimi Rogers) lifestyles was just as destructive and excessive as the other - neither fulfilled her. God is referred to as a rather pathetic Hitler-esque character that says he loves, but he destroys and will destroy you as well unless you ""say you love God"".

32070,3,078060718X,"I caught this film recently on the SyFy Channel.  I thought it gave a fair representation of a particular ""Christian"" eschatology, namely the 19th & 20th century phenomena of the ""born again believer"" and their obsession, over everything else Christian, on ""The Rapture.""  Mimi Rogers, as Sharon, gives a fine performance as an obsessed pleasure feeling sex addict who comes to see the emptiness of her life.  Sharon works at a dead end job as an 411 operator.  While cruising with her friend Vic, played by Patrick Bauchau, ever on the prowl for swingers at airport lounges, she meets a couple, the woman who has a strange tattoo on her back, of The Pearl.  Obviously a reference to the parable of Jesus and the story of the ""Pearl of Great Price.""  One day while eavesdropping on her Christian co-workers she hears them speaking of ""The Pearl.""  She is visited by two fundamentalists who leave her a copy of the New Testament.  She converts a former sex partner, Randy, played by David Duchovny.  There is also a prophet, a young boy, who I think is her bosses' son who predicts the near end of the world.  Well things go swimmingly for Sharon and Randy.  They have a daughter and all is good in the world.  But, for how long?  Not very long.  Randy, is murdered by a disgruntled former employee at his place of business.  Sharon gets a vision to go to the desert with the daughter to await the Rapture.  Well, they are befriended by a local sheriff, but are on the verge of starvation.  Sharon kills her daughter to send her to heaven faster, and obvious reference to Abraham and Issac or Dylan's Highway 61.  Anyway, I will not ruin the ending.  I liked the movie, because despite its faults it gives a fair portrayal of belief built on feeling, which is what drove Sharon all along, whether sinner or saint.  And this analogy can be used for religion, politics, really anything in life.  For an independent film, not too bad.  Why it was shown on the SyFy Channel is beyond me, it more properly belongs on the Trinity Network, though I doubt the pretty descriptive sex scenes in the beginning of the film would pass muster.",1256601600,4,2128,4.574074074074074

On the surface, a movie about a bored hedonist who has a religious conversion and goes into the desert to await the coming of the Lord doesn't sound like something that would appeal. Yet the performances - particularly Mimi Rogers (as Sharon) - make it worthwhile.

It is slow-paced but not overly so. (I watched it with my daughter who was bored to tears- but hey it isn't an action movie.)

A film about religion (well faith) is something that doesn't exactly make it to the Multi-plexes very often but the subject matter it raises is worth exploring.

  I cry when I am witness to what i think or believe is heroism...sacrifice for the greater good/ sacrifice for a personal conviction. It's a spiritual thing i think driven by the concrete real world experience of loss and suffering; not so much our own as others (we must first transcend our own selfishness). The sacrifice is that much greater in relation to the degree of the threat/ temptation that blocks the way. Nazi's, Commies, mad scientists, monied drug lords, Corporate CEOS from hell, sirens from mars...? Bring'em on!
  But what if it's GOD? What if it's GOD itself, irrefutably proven all-powerful Christian GOD? Could I or you look GOD in the eyes and say NO? Could you or I suffer every loss, every deprivation for the sake of our convictions?

32095,3,078060718X,"As a born again Christian, the one thing I have learned from God is to be understanding of others.  The opinions of the reviewers is just that opinions, as is mine. Mimi Roger, portraying  a person struggling with the meaning of life, was very good.  She being A SCIENTOLOGIST, would have a hidden agenda for acting in this movie. Religion is man made, God is real and the love He has for us is simply that.  He gave man a conscience so that man could have the ability to make a choice between right and wrong. In this movie, I felt Mimi Rogers condenscension of belief in God from the very beginning.  Yes, the sandal wearing, peace loving attitude she portrayed, is what a true believer feels upon salvation.  That is because when Christ truly enters your heart, and might I add it is because you ask Him to, you see the world through His eyes, that of love.  As you grow in your Christian faith, He delivers you from all the angst you carry around.  For some it is immediate, for me it is through stages of growth and having a loving partnership with Him.  Whether you believe or not, to me it makes sense to have this attitude towards the world than the one in which you live in cynicism, ignorance, and apathetic conclusions.  If this film did nothing else it makes you want to figure out what is the answer.  The character of Sharon wanted to believe there was something out there better than what she had.  Well...look where her ""belief"" took her, into a clean living life with understanding and compassion for the world.  She led others to a true saving knowledge of Jesus Christ especially the man she marries and has a beautiful child with. (HOW TERRIBLE THAT WAS) No where in the Bible does it state that becoming a christian guarantees a life without problems.  Matter of fact it brings problems to your life  because of the other entity called Satan.  Yes, he is just as real and he controls the earthly realms of life.  Nothing makes him angrier that someone giving up their life of sin to serve and believe in Jesus Christ.  If the producer of this film had tried to bring this truth into the film rather than placing the blame totally on God, then viewers would have had a more legitimate claim to an opinion.  As it were the character of Sharon did what a lot of people do who do not ground their faith in scripture, they look for the first thing they can to cast blame on anything other than looking at the flaws within themselves.  The non believers who watched this film were vindicated in their opinions because they speak of which they do not know.  The portrayal of the brain washing tatics of the character towards her daughter was true to an extent with some christians.  But with those of us who read the bible and believe it as God's word, it was ludicrous.  God would never tell you to kill your child, he hates murder.  God would never tell you when He was coming, because he expects you to be ready whether you are eating, sleeping, or playing monopoly.  He will not choose any special one above the other to reveal this too.  He loves us all the same.  As a christian I was not offended by this movie but at the blatant one sided opinion of God it portrayed.  The character made her choices from the beginning.  She CHOSE to live a sinful life, she chose to try something different, she chose to improve her life, she chose to end her daughters life, she chose to turn away from the truth. SHE RECEIVED HELL BECAUSE SHE CHOSE IT.  Her daughter asks her do you see heaven, she says yes and chose to live in darkness because of an all too human trait, PRIDE.  Pride is what Satan gives you in order to justify your feeling of being more intelligent than God. If you are standing as she was at a portal of living clean and free or dirty and trapped, why in the world would you choose the latter.  Because Satan convinces you through pride and arrogance that you are smarter and better than such a simplistic choice of God.  It all boiled down to faith, it always will.  Either you have the faith to believe or you have the faith you are right to not believe.  What a gracious God we have to give us that choice because even when you choose to not believe, he still loves you.  As with any good parent, we love our children unconditionally even when they do something wrong.  If that is the decision made we have to let them deal with the consequences, bad or good.  That is what God does.

So laugh if you will at us Christians, choose to have an opinion on a subject you are not versed to speak or dare to stand up for yourself and find out what is real about God.  A movie is just a story out of someones mind, an entertainment, take what that persons vision makes you feel and follow through with your own conclusions.  After all you have nothing to lose but your soul.  Just look at Sharon in the end.  Scary.",1240358400,4,4841,4.350055741360089

32097,5,078060718X,"As previous comments show, this unique film evokes intense responses from its viewers, both positive & negative. And with the increasing presence of fundamentalism on the national & world stage, the questions it poses become ever more pressing & pertinent. Interestingly, both believers & non-believers fall on both the positive & negative sides here!

The basic story is common enough today: Sharon (a superb, risk-taking Mimi Rogers) works at an unfulfilling job & leads an unfulfilling personal life of empty group sex. She's desperate for meaning, purpose, structure -- drifting through a desolate modern landscape that offers neither sanctuary or salavation to the lost & achingly lonely soul.

And then she begins to dream of The Pearl, as some of her born-again co-workers discuss some mysterious boy prophet among themselves ... and she finds her purpose & meaning in a devout, unquestioning acceptance of the fundamentalist Jesus. The End Times are coming soon, and the faithful must prepare for it. She does so by marrying & converting erstwhile sex partner David Duchovny, and having a lovely little girl with him. It's the life she'd been seeking all those years.

And then random -- or is it? -- tragedy strikes, leaving her a widow. She seemingly copes with this tremendous loss through her faith, yet questions are nagging at her unconscious. She decides that God is calling her & her daughter to the desert, as a trial & purification of sorts, to await the Rapture.

I won't give away any more of the story, except to say that writer-director Michael Tolkin follows the idea of fundamentalism to a logical, chilling conclusion. And he poses some wrenching questions -- while the idea of a Godless, meaningless Universe is terrifying & unbearable for many, he suggests that a universe of fundamentalist meaning where God does exist may be even more terrifying, if you insist on personal autonomy & satisfactory answers over submission to an infinite but strangely narrow love. Or can it truly be called love, on the terms offered?

The final choice in this film has led to a good deal of discussion. Not wanting to spoil it, I'll only say that Sharon seems to make that choice out of anger & defiance, not pride & guilt. Her choice reminds me very much of the conclusion to Camus' classic essay, ""The Myth of Sisyphus."" It's definitely an existential choice, and I think an honorable one. But you'll make your own decision on that.

Yes, the production values aren't big budget. That's actually an advantage, as spectacular CGI would only get in the way of the story & its ideas. It's worth the loss of special effects dollars to maintain the integrity of Tolkin's vision, like it or loathe it. I guarantee that you won't be unmoved as the final credits roll.

Director Michael Tolkin, actors David Duchovny and Mimi Rogers are all together in one location discussing the film, while actor Patrick Bauchau's comments are occasionally dubbed in (at a much lower volume). Duchovny, an unknown when he made this film, makes some hilarious comments about a particular nude shot that wound up on the Internet.

This is a film about contemporary Christianity. There are few films available that even begin to attempt to take on this notion. The subject matter is adult. The characters are complex, fairly real (in an urban sense at least) and represent longing in many forms. The fact that there are crude scenes, parts of the acting/script may be lacking or hard to fathom and the production as a whole has a very ""non-mainstream presented in a mainstream medium"" feeling, it is essential viewing relative to what is out there. Christians bemoan Hollywood's depiction of faith, but what have those so angry and insulted brought to the screen. You have to take a gamble and a leap of faith to make a film, almost any film.

She realizes that her life has no purpose and leads her nowhere and she turns to a religious sect for spiritual guidance...

It's been several weeks since I saw the film and I am still not sure what it was, a riveting dark drama about searching for faith, accepting spiritual awakening, preparing yourself for the second coming of Christ and for Apocalypses now or the ridiculous piece of trash. I think it could be both and it depends on how you feel toward the Christianity, the possibility of undergoing a religious conversion, and the readiness to sacrifice the most precious that you have to prove your faith and love for God. It also depends on how you feel about the dialogs in the movie - the quote that I've chosen for the title of this review may give you an idea of what to expect.

What I am sure of is that Mimi Rogers gave a fine performance, and she is a reason enough to see ""The Rapture"". Rogers is a very capable and attractive actress and should be recognized more.

32129,1,078060718X,"There isn't much to save this movie. People are upset with its portrayal of a born-again Christian, but the hard, sad truth is, MANY people are like this. They live empty, shallow lives, get bored, turn around, preach to everybody, fall by the wayside, and wind up disillusioned with their new-found faith. And they wind up worse than before. Very typical.

People call this a slap in the face of Christianity, due to its portrayal of a believer, but really, it hurls the slap in the direction of people who don't believe as Christians do. It is annoying. Annoying, also, is the boy's constant referral of the final book of the New Testament as ""the book of Revelations."" If you actually LOOK at the text, you'll see it's just called ""Revelation."" No ""S."" This irks me. A genuine sign of lack of comprehension, is adding a final ""S"" to titles that are written in the singular. I see it all the time. As I do here.
And the writer of the film says War is the First Horseman. Actually, the leading horse is white, a false peace, leading up to war.

But the general message of this film is, only a few of the billions of people on Earth will wind up in Paradise. God, in His infinite wisdom, keeps pumping more and more people into a corrupt, over-crowded world, hoping one day he might get it right, creating the same flawed beings over and over, but turning his back on them when they stumble.

A disturbing thing in this film is, I believe, a very realistic depiction of the psychological abuse the youngsters experience at the hands of the pious. The born-again's roots are not deep enough to take hold, as per the parable in the Gospel, and the innocent pay. The psychobabble of the mother talking about God taking them, the mother and daughter, up to Heaven, to be with the husband, who is the girl's father, and being left to look like fools when it doesn't happen, which has ALWAYS been the case with stories of the Second Coming, are, of course, what are expected to happen here. The woman looked like Linus Van Pelt, in his annual camp-out in the pumpkin patch, awaiting the ""Great Pumpkin."" This has happened many, many times in the real world, and it leaves people with egg on their face every time.

I think my biggest problem with this film is, it leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth, so to speak. The doubters are seen as cynical, and the believers are seen as a secret society, and the main character is a bit of a loose cannon, who looks for God, can't find Him, suffers disappointment after disappointment, committing illegal, immoral acts along the way, and finally being taken to the gate of Heaven, just for God to say ""Nah, I don't think so,""  and leave her in the ""Outer Darkness"" to look in from the outside, forever.

It's a propaganda film, and a bad one, at that.

32131,5,078060718X,"This is one of my all time favorite films.

One of the film's novel twists is that it criticizes the beliefs of fundamentalists not by questioning their God's existence, but by asking whether their God's actions are fair.

The first 3/4 of the film follows a fairly typical religionist's  ""I was lost but now I'm found""  story line.

  The last part skillfully portrays the film's heroine coming to terms with the growing realization that her God's actions (or inaction in some instances) do not appear to be justified.
  The movie does this by placing her in situations somewhat reminiscent of the Biblical stories of Job and also Abraham & Isaac.

After a while it seems that God has abandoned her; or perhaps God is simply 'testing' her, and He is waiting for her to commit an act which involves a huge leap-of-faith.
She (as a good fundamentalist) chooses to believe the latter with bitter and tragic consequences.

Late in the film she meets another devout Christian who tells her that God is great because He forgives us for our sins,
her response is: ""Who forgives God?"".",1167091200,5,1078,4.741935483870968
32132,5,078060718X,"The most interesting thing about this movie is how so many different people can give completely different interpretations of what it means to them. In this respect, the script is excellent.

Clearly this is not a movie made by Christians and for Christians, as evidenced by the topless scenes, minutes into the movie. So whatever the message of this movie is, it is not going to be pro-Christian. That Christians can view this movie and believe that it could be a pro-Christian movie is a testament to the wonderful ability of the director to accurately typecast Christians exactly as they are.

The thesis of this movie is: all one has to do to be saved is believe. You do not have to live a good life or go to Church or preach the gospel. You can enjoy a nasty life right up to the last trumpet call of God and still be saved. It happened to the non-believing cop who arrested Mimi, it happened to the prisoners in the jail scene, and it happened to the atheist taxi cab driver. It could have happened to Mimi.

The symbol of the Christian life is the dream of the pearl. The dream could not be faked and people who had the dream could easily tell when other people tried to fake having the dream. When God asks Mimi to sacrifice everything to go live in the desert and await the rapture, as proof that Mimi was on the right path, God constantly gives Mimi dreams of the pearl. But when food and patience ran out for Mimi, Mimi faces a dilemma: disobey God and go back to civilization and live, or stay in the desert and die a slow death. Mimi cannot go back because she wants to please God, so she shoots her daughter so her daughter will not have to die a slow death, then tries to kill herself but she cannot do it when she realizes that suicides are not allowed in Heaven.

After Mimi murders her daughter, she is arrested. As she waits in jail, the first trumpet of God sounds. Vile and nasty people all around her are making last minute decisions to believe in God and are saved. Mimi realizes that she could have disobeyed God to go back to living in sin with her daughter still alive and she still could have gone to Heaven anyway. Therefore the dream of the pearl was portrayed as a farce perpetuated by a God to fool believers into thinking they were special, and then use that to manipulate them into suffering for God's sadistic pleasure. That makes God the most immoral kind of person there is, hence the reason that Mimi rejects God in the end, even when God tries to bribe her into believing by offering her daughter as bait. Mimi could not be bribed and her soul was not for sale, so God gets even by placing Mimi in Hell to be tortured with loneliness forever and ever.",1165276800,5,2688,4.348605577689243

32144,4,078060718X,"THE RAPTURE explores a subject that few films dare explore with any effort at seriousness:  religion.  In movies, religion is usually made fun of or satirized.  Rarely is it shown as a force that can actually make people's lives better.  (Exceptions include Robert Duvall's remarkable THE APOSTLE).

In THE RAPTURE, we have Mimi Rogers (in a performance that should have gotten her some awards) as a telephone operator (""What city, please?) by day and a party-girl swinger by night.  She leads a VERY hedonistic lifestyle...one that clearly leaves her empty and full of self-loathing...as it would any thinking person.  During one of her trysts, she meets David Duchovny, and the two develop a closeness (despite Duchovny's horrible mullet!).  Meanwhile, Rogers begins to overhear conversations at the workplace about The Rapture and other portents of the end of the world.

She is drawn to these people, because they seem to have a peace and a certainty that's missing from her life.  Eventually, she is born again and even manages to bring Duchovny along with her.

Years later, her faith is put to the test, and she undergoes some severe personal loss.  When the rapture does arrive (this is when God is supposed to call all the Christians to heaven just prior to the start of the end times), Rogers has some mixed feelings.  I know this paragraph doesn't tell much, but if I go into details, I easily spoil the second half of the film...and it's full of interesting ethical, moral and religious dilemnas.

Here's what I like.  Rogers is great.  She's almost worth the price of admission on her own.  She's never done anything since to approach this.  Will Patton, in a small but important role, is charismatic.  And as an X-Files fan, Duchovny is an added bonus.

Furthermore, as I said, the film explores...without laughing...the idea that believing in God and turning your life over to Jesus is a viable choice.  That Christians do find peace in their choice and that God does perhaps answer prayers.  Whether one is a Christian or not...one must also recognize that a lot of people are and that it is a lifestyle that the movies all but ignore.

However, that being said, the movie does depict all its Christians as being obsessed with prophecy about the end times, the coming apocalypse and the rapture.  Yes, many Christians are concerned with this.  But the vast majority of ""mainstream"" Christianity hesitates to try to interpret the Book of Revelations and discussions of what the end of the world will be like are avoided.  Revelations is too strange.  The movie would have you believe that this is pretty much the only book in the Bible that Christians read.  I would have liked more balance...fewer extremes.  Just as Rogers character at the beginning is extreme in her hedonism...so is she extreme in her beliefs.

But at least they aren't mocked, and I liked that.  There has never really been a movie quite like THE RAPTURE before.  It takes on big subjects and isn't afraid to provoke thought or debate.  It has moments of pretty raw emotion.  While obviously made on a VERY low budget...that helps the film seem more real, the people more mundane and down to earth.

The film is a hard R, and should not be viewed by kids...who would be exposed to sexual images they don't need early on and who would be bored to tears by the more intellectual parts later on.  But for adults who are looking for something different, and who don't mind having some hard-core beliefs explored...then I highly recommend this flawed but riveting work.",1157500800,11,3551,4.811570247933885

This is a film about one's faith and how deep that faith is when things in life get exceedingly tough or to the point where life becomes almost unbearable.

And despite the whining from some, usually hardline Christian, corners, it's not anti-christian at all. What it is is simply great, imaginative and clever film making, and a superbly done character piece centered around a magnificent performance from Mimi Rogers, ably supported by the likes of David Duchovny, Will Patton and Patrick Bauchau.

I'm not going to go into it too deeply simply because it's one of those films that should be seen and experienced with as little up front knowledge as possible.

(Please note that I'm not attacking Christians or Christianity above, just a small, but, as usual, vocal closed minded minority that always gets up in arms about any film that dares tackle any such subject with any degree of honesty instead of going down the traditional biblical fawning path. People who will instantly hate a film like this just ""on principle"" and then proclaim to all that they should avoid ""such trash"". You know exactly the kind of people I'm talking about. They're a minority, they just happen to be a very vocal and closed minded one. And none of that has anything to do with their christianity as much as it has to do with their absolute closed mindedness and their fear of anything that dares stray from a certain comfortable path.)

The DVD: The good news, this film is finally on dvd, and with a pretty decent audio commetary to boot. The bad news, the movie has been badly misframed, which is something that becomes obvious in a couple of key scenes especially. I'm not sure whether this was done as a form of censorship (as the misframing of one scene does effectively nullify a sequence of any real nudity that it once had) or whether it was just a botched transfer, but it is clearly misframed regardless as I saw this film twice on it's theatrical run and the framing is different now than it was then. Plus the misframing is quite obvious anyway, and on the audio commentary you can even hear remarks about the film pertaining to parts of the print that are no longer visible due to said misframing (so clearly they were watching the film in it's proper framing).

Unfortunately this doesn't appear to be available anywhere else on dvd, so if you want the film on dvd right now this is your only option, just be aware going in, and hope for a better release somewhere down the track. Apart from the framing issue the sound and audio quality are perfectly fine, and the only other notable extra is the film's trailer.

32151,4,078060718X,"I've read some of the reviews already posted (from Christians who are touchy about the subject through to those who clearly are Anti-Christian and delight in poking fun at believers). The diverse opinions suffice to tell you this is not as simplistic or poorly done a film as some might suggest. I do not understand the reviews that say they are confused and don't understand. The movie is hardly that complicated that you can't get some coherent understanding of the plot.

NOTE: I may review more detail than you wish. Consider this a spoiler warning, although I don't give it all away, I wouldn't want you to feel cheated.

First off: I'm a believer. Yes, I believe in God, Christ, the Bible, the historic creeds and in the Rapture to come (I'm post-trib, for those who care). With all that, I liked this film. I enjoyed Mimi Rogers' performance and I enjoyed seeing the journey of this troubled character. We're not dealing with a character who does things in moderation. When she was pre-Christian, she didn't just have sex, she had SEX!, promiscuously, in groups, etc. We learn it's her way of filling this void she feels, the boredom of her meaningless existence. She attempts suicide. She's a mess. BUT...she has a vision of ""the pearl"" and it gives her a sense of peace and soon she's turned her life over to God and she's a Christian with a Z for ZEAL, evangelizing anyone she can--on the job, on the phone, friends, strangers. To some believers, this seems quite fine and laudable. To some, it will seem strange and immoderate. I think that's part of the interest. Where is this woman going now?

The movie has this haunting air about it. You get a sense of being on the edge of doom, which is suitable given the subject matter. Even when she's all aglow and talking about God, you get the sense this character is rushing headlong into another type of excess. The character may have found something that gives her purpose, and a stability, but something about her is still unbalanced emotionally. Even her ""peace"" is an excessive peace. Tragedy befalls her--SPOILERS--stop reading if you don't wanna know:--when her husband is murdered in a killing spree at work, and still she keeps this strange calm. You don't see her really break down or do anything a normal grieving woman--Christian or otherwise--would do. It's rather spooky.

When she has visions that beckon her to the desert, visions that gave me the willies and seemed kind of sinister, like a haunting--visions that have even her church's Prophetic Boy warning her that they stand unconfirmed by other believers and might be from Satan--we have a growing suspicion that something will go terribly wrong.

And it does.

One can look at this story as the descent into madness of a never very stable woman and wonder if anything in those last minutes is real or if it's all imagined, sanity banished.

From a Christian perspective, I take enjoyment in a more literal reading that, despite any directorial intention is the most taken away from the film. This is a woman we've seen crack up, a woman whose been kept in check by her faith, her husband and her church. When she loses her ties to a husband, who never had that weird, glazed look like the main character,  and when she then distances herself from the accountability and safety net of a church by heading for the wilderness, and then when she allows her faith to buckle, she's left with nothing to stop her from rashness and crazed decisions.

What should this woman know? She should know from her church sermons that to go into the desert is typically a sign of temptation to come: Jesus went into the desert and the devil tried to get him to move away from his mission and disobey God.  Here, we see a woman who is tempted, perhaps not by Satan, but by her own desires. She wants to be raptured. She wants to go to heaven. She wants to be done with life down here. She wants the culmination of her faith. She's tried to die before and failed, she wants to go to the better place. The temptation is great, so great, she forgets simple admonitions she surely knows by heart--

Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt love the Lord thy God, thou shalt not put the Lord thy God to the test.

A simple prophetic warning that is uttered by the Prophet Boy and subsequently by the character's daughter, one that is ambiguous at best--""Don't expect God to meet you halfway""--is twisted, as any advice can be, to suit one's emotional needs or fears.

To Christians, some things will irk. For instance, the innacurate rendering of a well-known Biblical doctrine/verse: We love Him because He first loved us. Well, here it becomes, ""He loves us because we love him.""  A total turnaround of truth.

The Controversial Ending:  To any orthodox (not as in Greek Orthodox but as in traditionally doctrinal) Christian, the ending is not controversial. Are we suprised that God both showers grace and forgives at the last minute or that he implacably judges and condemns? I think not. We know He does both.

However, God shows his grace by giving the character multiple opportunities to make a different decision. Providentially, someone she knows from her past shows up near the end. Then another character counsels her. Then another gives her an example. So many chances....Then character chooses her final fate, all the while unwilling to see where she is at fault. It's easier to just blame God.

The director/writer may have meant this to be Anti-Christian. Dunno. I didn't HAVE to take that away from it. I could choose to see it as an examination of a particular character with specific weaknesses and how it manifests in the context of Christian eschatology. The other Christians aren't shown being cruel or harsh or encouraging disastrous outcomes. Ultimately, this is about this ONE woman. One woman's choice. A very pro-choice film, actually. And the ending may cheer fans of INVICTUS, but it will make most of us feel pity.

If one wants to see it as a mental degeneration of a troubled woman, that works, too. But I don't think it works as well as accepting the ending as ""real"".  The film's power works only if the woman's choice is a true-life scenario and not the mental figment of a lunatic.

The Rapture can lead to fruitful and interesting discussion after viewing, even for believers. I recommend it.",1121126400,193,6326,4.706787330316742
32152,4,078060718X,"The Rapture is a brave film about a hedonistic woman who, bored and empty from her swinging, tries to fill the void with an ecstatic brand of Christianity in which dreams, revelations, and portents are the main focus of her new faith. She is so vulnerable and naive that she embraces the most dangerous elements of religious conversion--emotionalism, fanaticism, end-of-the-world fatalism. Mimi Rogers' performance is excellent as a woman slowly having a religious meltdown but the final act goes on too long and becomes to maudlin for my tastes. Nevertheless, this is a brave film filled with excellent dialogue that questions faith from many angles. Is the film anti-religious? I don't think so. Atheism and hedonism are not kindly looked at in this film. Nor is blind faith. But just because Tolken shows the dangers of a fanatic, doesn't mean he is hostile to all forms of religion. Those charges are unfair. The film is far more complex than being a screed against this or that brand of faith.",1117324800,4,998,4.911242603550296
32153,5,078060718X,"Someone on this page lobbed an interesting criticism of Michael Tolkin's astonishing and hypnotic The Rapture, saying that it's anti-Christian propaganda.  I think that criticism has more validity than many would give it credit for - not because sex or violence is immediately anti-Christian, but because its central character takes her faith way too far, and then retreats from it to a defensive position of pride when the world actually does end.  And because, despite all the things this movie does right, that depiction of the apocalypse is visually a bit hard to swallow - is the afterlife really that inundated with fog machines?  The reason I think this movie is so good and so important, though, is that it presents the extremes of faith and pride, of redemption and personal emptiness as just part of the everyday concerns of this character, embodied with brave and gripping humanity by Mimi Rogers in an astonishing performance.  Her character is so complicated and fascinating that it dismisses the hard-earned truth of movie to say its point is simply ""Christians bad.""  Instead, it examines with empathy the very human factors that lead people to faith, the dark possibilities of excessive devotion to it, and the anger and pride at having been through it all.

She discovers a religious sect who follow the prophecies of a child (""...and a child shall lead them..."") about the rapture, the second coming of Christ and judgement day. She is hesitant at first, but after a near suicide, she crosses over and becomes ""saved"". She marries an old boyfriend from her past (David Duchovney) and has a little girl. When tragedy strikes and she's troubled by an apparent vision, she steadfastly believes the rapture is here and takes to the desert with her child to await God. There, her faith will be put to the ultimate test. While some may find this film arty, far-fetched or even pretentious, I found it excellent and quite unlike anything I've ever seen. Rogers is marvelous as Sharon and believable as a modern woman who has questions about faith and God. Duchovney is also good as Randy who sticks by Sharon because he loves her. The film has shocking moments to be sure but it has a dream like quality which gives the subject matter an eerie edge. There are times when it even approaches spellbinding. For those who enjoy challenging films that leave you talking about it later, this is one to watch. Even if you don't like it, you'll think about it.

32196,5,078060718X,"When I first saw The Rapture (when it first came out), I was struck by how meticulous (and amusing) the (non-denominational) portrayals of the Born Agains (or, as I prefer to call this particular stripe of same, Apocalyptic Wowsers) were, from the faux Mormon missionaries to the painful earnestness of the young daughter asking to be with God and her daddy.  This movie was saying everything I had wanted to say about religious Millenialism, and saying it (I thought) loud and clear.
Sharon, the character played by Mimi Rogers, was not living a life she was happy with, so, like so many others, instead of looking within herself to see what she could do to fix it, she (however unconsciously) sought without.  Naturally there are always people willing to provide a sense of safety, surety, and surface happiness, or to show you how to achieve those things.  All you have to do is give up what you are, and put all your faith in something that demands everything (and everything most certainly is demanded) of you, not only your life, but your soul.
Michael Tolkin is laughing at Born Again-ism, Millenialists, and fundies of the Christian persuasion in this movie. The Rapture is a primer on getting just what you pray for - here is what will happen if this is what you truly believe.  Fortunately, he is also able to show us a woman who is strong enough to resist, at the end, although it means spending her eternity caught between Heaven and Hell.
When looking for meaning or layers, or subtext, or whatever, in a movie (or any other work of art, for that matter), it always helps to put the thing in context with other works by the same person.

32198,1,078060718X,"Although this movie does have some intriguing points and does a good job of bringing up age old scepticism,it inadequatly depicts Christianity by demonizing religon and lionizing the proud and rebelious. Mimi Rogers who plays Sharon does a few things that make me wonder why so many people would feel sorry for her. First of all(and I blame this largely on Hollywood)when Sharon decides to turn a new leaf and try to better herself AKA not sleeping around in promiscuous group sex,she instantly goes to a 180 extreme by rigid rules and preaching to others instead of knowing God,loving God,treating herself and others with reaspect and trying to lead a decent life. Hollywood always makes this statement that you're either extremely pious or you indulge in every kind of sin;no inbetween,how unoriginal and closeminded.
Secondly,she kills her daughter one day before the rapture not because God told her to,but because of her own lack of faith. All she had to do was wait ONE DAY!That in itself shows her selfishness and how shallow her soul is.
Lastly,near the end of the movie,when she is sooo angry with God(
why I don't know,God did not order her to kill her daughter)
she has the chance to be reunited with her daughter in Heaven if she would just accept God and His commandments. Naturally being the idiot that she is,she refuses. If any human is that proud and that self-absorbed then they don't deserve to be in Paradise.
I really like Mimi Rogers,but this script was so sterotypical and biased that it would turn away anyone who was considering a religous life.",1019174400,21,1570,4.818518518518519
32199,4,078060718X,"If you yawned you missed this one when it first came out in the movies years ago. An ""R"" rated look at the Christian Rapture, it scared off Christians with its rating and heathens with its topic matter, so basically had no audience.
After watching it twice now, I still don't know what to make of it. The life of sexual hedonism and its emptiness is shown, but not to a degree that you really got the feeling she would be suicidal. Her Christian conversion and subsequent life changes were interesting, and true in many respects, but with the typical hollywood portrayal of all personal Christianity -- rather shallow. It had the feel that ""7th Heaven"" has as a TV show showing Christianity. The people trying to show what it's like are on the outside looking in, not those who trully experience it.
The main character's turning back away from God is equally as puzzling. Things don't happen the way she expects ""We'll give God one more chance"", then she chooses actions that she can't forgive God for. She's in the desert several weeks, then shoots her daughter the day before the Rapture comes. Oddly, she never seems to figure out that if she waited one more day everything would have been fine, and God didn't ask her to shoot her daughter.
The Rapture scenes are cursory and not filled out, which fits the movie. It's not deep theology and isn't meant to be. The film is much more about concepts than specifics. Some of the lines will make Christians cringe because they don't match Christian thought ""God loves us because we love Him"", but overall for a Hollywood movie they do a good job.
I recommend the film, but I'm not sure why. You'll either like it or you won't, but for a semi shallow undertaking if does create a depth of thinking.",1017619200,16,1746,4.563694267515924

The acting is third rate (you can practically see the actors trying to stifle yawns as they lurch mechanically through the wooden script), the concept trite beyond belief, and the conclusion almost (but, sadly, not quite) comic.  Anyone with an IQ greater than their hat size is unlikely to enjoy this film.  It is, in short, Christian schlock as only Hollywood can make it.  The tedium of the religious content comes from the total lack of imagination with which it is treated.  Whereas an atheist can find something of artistic interest in Goethe's Faust, even a born again type is unlikely to find much to write home about in this terrible story of a woman who moves from one shallow life (a ""sex addict"") to another (a ""born again""), who loses her husband and then feels compelled by her god to shoot her daughter (wasn't there something in the Christian philosophy about not killing?  I guess that got lost somewhere along the way).  Just when the film presents the (slender) possibility that a critique of religious extremism and emotional pain might be on offer, the film lurches to a conclusion in which the end of the world arrives (but not soon enough to spare us from this film!) and the protagonist's narrow little world of gods and heavens is revealed to be (of course) true after all.

32226,5,078060718X,"Sharon suffers great confusion about her role and nature in her body/space/time matrix.  After she immerses herself into body and sensate consciousness about as much as a human can, she finds despair.  A message is creeping into her through dreams, and she attaches its meaning to the prophecies of a cult of sincere fundamentalists who are possessed by the idea of the Rapture.  Passionate and obsessive about one thing or another as always, Sharon becomes as immersed in her interpretation of Revelation as she was about thrill-seeking.  In her bottom-line desire to ""lose herself"" in one thing or another, she finds that she cannot lose her Self at all.  At the end, she can neither accept the idea of a total, forgiving Authority any more than she can accept responsibility and forgiveness for her own misinterpretations of reality.  She is left at the edge of the River Styx, unable to cross.  She will not surrender her grievances, because they have become - and may have always been - the basis of her Self-Concept.  She would rather cling to her judgments and grievances that be delivered.
Tolkin is an astonishing filmmaker, and THE RAPTURE has not lost any of its eerie power since I saw it in a Century City theater in 1991.  What amazes me is some Christians' inability to grasp its depth or sincerity, but it is a theological rubix cube, and those who like Kirkengaard and more mystical investigations into Christianity will relish it, as it cautions against 'literalism' as much as it eviscerates 'pride'.
Is it outrageous that Mimi Rogers was not awarded some honor for her portrayal of the troubled ""Can't find my limits"" Sharon.  Nevermind she has probably ruffled some Hollywood feathers with her personal life, but everytime I watch this film I am left speechless by her immersion into this tragic character, whose angst will move anyone that has searched the Long Night for under-standing.
Add to her bravura acting a well-cast David Duchovny, the wonderfully sybaritic Patric Buchau (spelling?), and a fine score by Thomas Newman, along with some great use of pop songs (Nico's ""I'll Be Your Mirror"" creeps through the wall like an Angel just as Sharon is about to kill herself in a dingy motel room!), and one has a knockout film.
Nevermind the special effects are on the low-end, what does that matter, really? This is a film about content, soul's content, so Tolkin can be forgiven his restrictions for bells and whistles.  In fact, the FX are rather in keeping with Sharon's consciousness, anyway, and to have them blown up would have derailed the film's focus.

I find it a stroke of genius to create a film that can be taken on many different levels.  Yes, one can watch this film and take it literally - the plights of a misguided hedonist who turns to Christianity and experiences ""The Rapture"" portended by her beliefs.  But the interpretation that I come up with is a floundering woman's descent into insanity.  All of her adult life, she is searching for an answer.  She doesn't find it in casual sex.  She doesn't find it in marriage and a ""happy home life"".  She doesn't find it in the birth of her daughter.  And she doesn't find it in Jesus.  Ultimately (not to give away the plot), when a catastrophic life event happens, disrupting her seemingly normal life, she begins the slow descent into darkness.
No, I don't believe the ending of this movie actually occurs anyplace other than her mind.  She is hopelessly lost and rejects any hope of salvation (mental or otherwise) whenever offered.

Mimi Rogers gives the performance of her life as Sharon, the hedonistic young woman in a dead-end job in Los Angeles who becomes converted into believing that the Apocalypse is coming--and its not giving too much of the plot away to tell you that she turns out to be right. Rogers' beatific splendor on the phone lines at her awful job after she's been converted is almost as touching as her terrible anguish after she's forced into committing herself to a horrible ethical choice near the end of the film. Although the film is somewhat marred by the appalling performance of a child actor as Sharon's daughter, this is one of the most sophisticated and intelligent takes on religious faith ever to come out of Hollywood.",981244800,5,914,4.754716981132075

32232,5,078060718X,"Simply put, the movie is a cinimatic representation of the timeless ""problem of evil"" argument against a benevolent God.  That is, if God is so good and powerful then why is the world full of terrible things?  Sharon turns toward God after living a less than fulfilling lifestyle.  In  the end, her devotion is met with pain and suffering including the  senseless death of her husband and killing of her daughter as they wait for  the rapture (which comes only a few days after the death of her child).  The final scene depicts Sharon's choice between embracing a god that would  allow such suffering in the world or spending eternity in purgatory.  It is  really well done and has not been repeated in anything I've seen.  I would  recommend this film to anyone, especially any amateur or professional  philosophers out there who would like to see this age-old argument played  out on screen.",954633600,13,893,4.751633986928105
32233,4,078060718X,"How do I review this movie?  Well lets start by saying that I overall liked The Rapture, but I still don't understand the whole concept either.  The Movie deals with Mimi Rogers caracter Sharon, a telephone operator by  day, swinger by night.  After fealing (the emptyness) in her heart Sharon  begins to look for something else, in her life, and that something happens  to be a new kindled love with God.  And then the movie really starts to  shake things up.  Sharon's husband is murdered by a disgruntled  employee(this scene is really hard to watch), and then she thinks God is  telling her to take her child out in to the desert and wait for the second  coming of Christ.  The movie ends with a real negative aspect on God and  the Church, that I really don't understand, or mabey I don't want to  understand.  Whatever the case may be, The Rapture leaves you with a sence  to depression, and hurt fellings for the caracters, and your self for years  to come.",949536000,15,964,4.505813953488372
