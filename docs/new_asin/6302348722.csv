7825090,3,6302348722,"In 1951 Akira Kurosawa followed up his critical and commercial breakthrough Rashomon (especially outside Japan, where it become the first widely released Japanese film) with this strange adaptation of Dostoyevsky's famous novel (Kurosawa would return to form the next year with the widely acclaimed Ikiru).

Masayuki Mori is the Idiot, who wants to do so much good to the world that he looks like an imbecile to most people. Toshiro Mifune is Akama (Rogozhin in the novel), showing a weird scowl during most of the movie. The entirely black clad femme fatale Taeko (Nastasya Filippovna in the original Dostoyevsky novel) is the object of their rivalry, and is played here by the legendary Japanese actress Setsuko Hara, still alive as of 2015, in a completely different register from the characters she played in the films of Yasujiro Ozu.

Kurosawa originally made a 265 minutes (more than six hours!) film, and that version was shown to a preview audience, which reacted negatively to it. The studio then cut the running time to three hours, and Kurosawa more or less disowned the movie. It is believed that the original version no longer exists. Despite the cuts and studio interference, it is a fascinating, if completely anti naturalistic film. The movie looks like a mess, surely due to the studio cuts, but, with its melodramatic moments and ultra weird performances, is mostly a fascinating, enjoyable, if sometimes confusing mess.

However, at three hours the movie is a bit too much (apparently it was shown in two parts of roughly an hour and a half). Watching a six hour movie of this is unimaginable to me.

Set in Northern Japan after World War II (though the setting is really atemporal, as we see little of cars or other technologies of the time). The wintry Hokkaido locations are a plus.",1428451200,,1805,4.908196721311476
7825091,5,6302348722,"I was in college when I first read Dostoyevski's novel ""The Idiot"".  It was not part of the required reading for any of my classes and I still recall my classmates making faces that I would read Dostoyevski in my spare time...  I loved the book and I still have it in my library.

It was only recently that I started exploring Akiro Kurosawa's movies and taking time to see all of them.  In his films, Kurosawa often makes observations about social and political setting of society we live it.  I could not resist to see Kurosawa's  interpretation of this great novel.

Film is made in Japan during winter season.  It almost looks like Russia in winter.  Actors are Japanese and all character names from the novel are replaced with Japanese names.  The intensity of the film also comes from the fact that it is made in black and white.  Main character (""the idiot"") is a soldier who is released from the army due to his epileptic sezures.  Because of his condition and his physically fragile disposition, people mistake his kindness, truthfulness and sincerity for idiocy.  When he states the obvious truth about the certain facts that other characters are trying to ignore or simply do not see because of their own arogance and insensitivity, most people just laugh it off trying to minimize the importance of (idiot's) observations.

Without disclosing the plot, all I can say is that this film is the tale of how humanity often neglects the kind and sensitive people who express their love and caring for others in unconventional ways.  Some people, like the main character of this film, have higher moral calling that is so divine and powerful - most people are unable to achieve that in their lifetime.  And in the world where greed, jealousy and spitefulness are general code of conduct, people like ""The Idiot"" stand out because their goodness and compassion is a threat to how others want to be perceived by the members of society.  Is it possible for goodness and purity to survive on its own?  Do people ever understand it and treasure it - or does it take an irreversible set of events to unfold, so that full understanding of these qualities in one person can finally be achieved?

Anyway, I was so touched by this movie, that I think I will start re-reading Dostoyevski again.  For me personally, Dostoyevski was kind of genious who understood not just human nature but also the Russian soul.  He was able to put powerful messages in his works in a kind of language that deserves eternal adoration for past and future generations of readers.",1368057600,,2554,4.720090293453724
7825092,5,6302348722,"The profound gaze of Akira Kurosawa about a simple man, nave and idiot, considered by the doctors as a dement epileptic, will face the world with his only weapon; the truth and nothing more the truth. But as you know, in this world of wolves, you must sleep with an eye open and just a few persons are capable to accept  the awful truth that can make you blind.

This powerful dramatis personae will involve two women who will love him from different perspectives. Inspired in the famous work of Dostoievsky, this another great gem of this master filmmaker.

Watch it and you will experience the crude reality of the madness and feel what it means to be just in the razor's edge.

Extraordinary and one of my top one hundred desert island films.",1173484800,2,745,4.537313432835821
7825093,5,6302348722,"In 1951 the Shochiku film studio released Akira Kurosawa's adaptation of Dostoevsky's ""The Idiot"" in a much-cut and rather mangled form. It flopped, and when Shockiku insisted the film be cut it again...Kurosawa said, ""Next time cut it down the middle...lengthwise!"" In other words, cutting would destroy the film. Anyway, the original Kurosawa-cut version was lost, and what remains is this much-pared-down version....

And, somehow, like a damaged soul, it is unbelievably affecting. It is a film that shows great nobility of spirit, contrasted against the tragic consequences of one's choices and actions based on fear, loathing, avarice, hate, and yes, love.

What a strange film! Kurosawa chose Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan's islands, and the most European-like. The houses look like European houses, and the weather! Snow covers the windowsills and blows in from open doors. What a desolate and deeply affecting visual...the windows with crescents of snow, while inside, near a stove, the tragic human dramas unfold.

Utterly fascinating. I cannot tell you how lovely and strange and disturbing a film this is! Maybe that overlay of Christianity, transplanted to Buddhism, is able to take the Christ-like central ""Prince Myishkin"" figure into a new realm of possibility of meaning: a universal secular application of the principle of loving one another.

Suddenly, in this film, everything is re-made: new and at the same time resonant of our own shared histories.

I have a memory of being in the Peter and Paul fortress in St. Petersberg and seeing a cell, and being told that Dostoevsky had been imprisoned, brought before a firing squad, blindfolded, the shots rang out...but the whole thing had been a cruel joke..they had not shot the novelist, he had been reprieved.

I know that Dostoevsky lived in St. Peteresberg, and I know that he had been in the army, and that he suffered from epilepsy and this reprieve from death, well, it would be pretty much the history (or to use film lingo, ""backstory"") of the central character in ""The Idiot"".

The acting is the kind of heated, overwrought acting you might expect in a silent film (and this is not to belittle the acting..! A silent film must communicate visually, and here, Kurosawa does the nearly impossible: allows us to enter into the pained and tortured souls of the characters through their eyes and how they hold their bodies, how they react to one another. These are people at the edge of sanity, desperate and full of self-loathing and fear. Their passions, even, are a source of pain. And, you will feel it, viscerally!).

Setsuko Hara is amazing. You will never see her like this in an Ozu film! Imperious, tortured.

Despite some awareness that the film was damaged and incomplete

(according to Kurosawa's original vision), and despite a disagreeable

encounter with the initial scenes where there are abrupt cuts, intertitles as elipses for lost footage, and some jumpy discontinuity-I attribute most of this to Shochiku's insistence on paring down of the film for time, and find, that, by the second half of the film, I've been won over, completely, and haunted and deeply moved.

In comparing this with another Kurosawa adaption of a Russian author;

Gorky's ""The Lower Depths"", one is immediately aware of the different

approach, and the masterful handling of the latter is so easeful and sure. In comparison, ""The Idiot"" is flawed, difficult.

But, for all it's flaws, I found ""The Idiot"" to be one of the best films I have ever seen!

Masayuki Mori, as the Prince Myishkin character (Kameda in the film) is deeply affecting. It is the surprise of his sudden smile, coming like sun on snow, or a light in a dark room, of his humility when he's said something painfully honest that shocks everyone, and he puts his hands to his head and apologizes..he is ""damaged"", and meant no harm by his words. In the scene where he takes the now-mad Toshiro Mifune's head in his hands (Mifune plays Akama..the Rogozhin character from the novel) his hands, even, seem to be imbued with a gentle love. By that point in the film, though, I completely believe in him! So beautiful, those deep, pained and loving eyes!

Setusko Hara, as Taeko (the Nastasya character in the novel) is utterly unlike anything we've seen in Ozu! You know, every short synopsis of the novel mentions the character as capricious...but, here, in this film, it so much more!!! We feel her motivations, her pain, her fury and desperation. We especially feel her pain through Mori's eyes. When she is at the point of tears, forcing Mori to choose her over another...there is an electricity...she holds her head back proudly, trying not to cry...imperiously raising her hand and telling Mori he must choose her and abandon his other love...and there is so much tension, everyone is at the breaking point, and it is truly her face, at this moment that terrifies! I have never seen her so desperate and in such pain! She is magnificent, heartbreaking.

Takashi Shimura is here, and it's always good to see him! Bokuzen Hidari, with a ""Hitler-esque"" moustache is here...being funny, as usual...the mom from ""Tokyo Story"" is here-her solid frame, those wonderful eyes (she feels like a family friend, doesn't she? Everyone has an aunt or mom or relative like her), and good 'old Minoru Chiaki, playing an uncharacteristically crummy guy (he's usually loveable in most of his roles).

This film has suffered from a bad rap. If you really love film, this is brilliant, so see it without prejuduice, forget what anyone might have told you about it, just remember the ways in which films are different from books, and remember that Kurosawa loved the book deeply, and trust him-he was even a better director than you thought he was.",1136419200,13,5769,4.947259565667012
7825094,5,6302348722,"I would never critique Kurosawa and I would never take a pass on any of his films. This movie's not perfect, but how could you ever give him less than 5 stars?  Either you want to see every Kurosawa film ever made or you don't want to see any.

This was beautiful, sad, and terrifying. I'd love to see it as originally shot. This was my first of his ""modern"" films. How exciting to see other actors I'd only seen in Ozu films-it made me appreciate them even more. See it if you get the chance!",1121731200,8,493,4.125
7825095,4,6302348722,"To me this film only used the framework of Doestoevsky's tale. Instead to me it shows the tragedy of postwar Japan. My favorite moment is when Kameda and Akama walk through the streets of
Hokkaido and they see the image of Taeko Nasu and Kurosawa makes the portrait our focus and the two men are merely the reflections in the glass.  It foreshadows the pending tragedy beautifully. The music in the background is haunting and it too captures the sadness of all three of the characters.
I loved Doestoevsky's novel, but to me this film brought it to life. Made it accessable and ultimately painful because as the film moves on I came to love Kameda in a way I couldn't with Prince Myshkin.
I am sad this film is out of print I would love to get this on DVD.",1069977600,4,756,4.361702127659575
7825096,2,6302348722,"I love a lot of Kurosawa's films and his worst is probably better than some directors' best.  But The Idiot, in my opinion, really misses its mark.  The beauty, depth and humor of the original Dostoevsky novel are totally lost in this film version.  (Perhaps they would be in any film version.) I found the acting of the lead character in particular, to be stilted and even a bit ridiculous.  Kurosawa somehow turned a rich, dynamic and very realistic psychological exploration into a weepy melodrama.  And I can't imagine the film will seem much better if you haven't read the novel.  You are much better off buying the book, one of the most perfect, profound and entertaining stories ever written, and leaving this movie alone.",1030233600,9,729,4.792
7825097,4,6302348722,"""The Idiot"" is a very complicated story and fitting all the characters and subplots into a two and a half hour movie does not work.  I read that the studio that released it cut the film from six hours to the length we see.  They should have left it alone.  The characters are fascinating.  The acting is a bit over the top.  Mifune can get away with chewing the scenery but some of the other actors are not as fortunate.  Don't let this review turn you off.  It is an engrossing film with some memorable moments!",995500800,9,512,4.270833333333333
