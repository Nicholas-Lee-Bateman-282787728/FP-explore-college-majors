8752661,5,B01CDHYH0Q,"Kate, Shaun and Daz grow up together forging a strong bond that follows them into adulthood.  There are flashbacks of their youth that's given equal time to the present.  So we know why things turn out as they do.  Shaun struggles with dyslexia, in a time before it was recognized as such or understood and it  is termed as just being slow.  It, however,  drives his  frustration and isolation and therein trouble abounds, as there were few resources to help him cope.  But this film is about friendship and youth and the bonds that we cling to when life hands us lemons.  It is  earthy, heart-wrenching, and I found it a good watch.",1537228800,,633,4.522123893805309
8752662,2,B01CDHYH0Q,It's ok.  I couldn't sympathize with any of the characters.  There seemed to be no character development; just melancholy dreariness throughout the film. At least the movie is well made in terms of cinematography and score.,1529452800,,223,5.166666666666667

8752664,5,B01CDHYH0Q,"This was such a beautiful movie, I'm so glad it was available here, finally. Don't deprive yourself of some superb acting. Some of Robert Carlyles movies are hard to find, and that is a real shame.",1467072000,2,197,4.5
8752665,5,B01CDHYH0Q,"I really love this movie! Meloncholy, charming, sentimental but not maudlin, tragic and painful in parts but never wallowing in tragedy or self indulgence, it's a beautiful slice of life film. Slipping back and forth between the childhood, the wild youth, and the difficult adulthood of the two characters, Shaun and Daz, Shaun's memories of the past act as both a golden refuge from his adult life and a slow revelation for the viewer of how he (and Daz) ended up living the life he's living. And it's a life that could and should feel soul-crushing and even predestined to that aforementioned tragedy but there's a spirited gallows humor in Evets' Daz, and a waifish charm in Carlyle's Shaun, and neither character invites pity, even in their darkest, angriest, saddest hours. Really, there's not a performance in this film that doesn't come across as heart-felt and sincere, and it's just all so beautifully done. (Although the kid playing teenaged Shaun doesn't look at all like he'd have grown up to be Robert Carlyle, but his actual performance is great, so I can forgive them going for acting skill and sincerity over a ""look."")

What I love most though is what I mentioned at the start: that in spite of pretty tragic circumstances brought on by bad decisions and by bad luck there is a gentle humor that runs through the movie and a hopefulness that feels so real and true to life, not for a ""happy ending"" (because those aren't real, life ends in death, not story arcs) but for a happy now and for the memories of happy yesterdays.

I like this movie enough that having seen it when I was briefly trying Hulu last year, I bought a (cheap) region free DVD player just so I could buy a region 2 copy of this movie and watch it whenever I wanted. I didn't think it would ever be available to American audiences and when I saw tonight that it was on Amazon I had to purchase and rewatch it, even though I already own a copy.

If you're up for a quiet, sad but hopeful sort of movie that's just all-around gorgeous, I strongly recommend this one.",1458000000,4,2051,4.5528455284552845
