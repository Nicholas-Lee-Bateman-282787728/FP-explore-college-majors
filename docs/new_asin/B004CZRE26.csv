4330903,5,B004CZRE26,"[DUFFY - (1968)] Fresh off a run of highly successful and enjoyable films ('Our Man Flint', 'Dead Heat On A Merry Go Round', 'In Like Flint' and 'The President's Analyst'), James Coburn scores again in 'Duffy', a crime caper with its tongue planted firmly in its cheek. It's more a homage to the late 60's time period itself, though I doubt director Robert Parrish was aware of this when filming, being rife with all the cool accoutrements of the psychedelic era. Coburn, though no means a kin of the 60's himself, appeared to be an emblem of all that was hip, escapist, cool and groovy at that time without seeming lame, stupid or out of place. Both adults as well as the youth found him suave, fetching and 'with it', and this film, along with those listed above, were solid reasons why. This time out, he's just one step short of campy and kitschy, but manages to avert this pratfall nicely. As only he could. It's a symbiotic relationship we have here - he's having fun with this role, so we're having fun with it too. Albeit lightweight, it's comic, breezy, engaging and festive all around. And it's laden with enough eye-candy to keep even the sweetest tooth pacified.

James Mason (another favorite of mine, who doesn't get a ton of screen time; his role is brief but significant) is the wealthy father of two embarrassing sons in their twenties; one's ""a moron"" as Mason aptly calls him but employs him nonetheless (simply because no one else would), and the other a ne'er-do-well who thinks he's a sharper stick than he actually is (they're played by James Fox and John Alderton). Overhearing Mason on a phone call to Spain, the sons learn that dad is planning to ship a million pounds sterling (back then approx. 3 million dollars) back to London on one of his ocean liners in a shady business deal, and they plan on intercepting it via high seas piracy with the assistance of Duffy, who's now enjoying resplendent retirement in the most groovy and psychedelic shack on the Spanish coast. He frequents a place called 'The Garden of Allah', a happening hashish den populated by swinging tourists and local businessmen who conduct trade between puffs on hookahs while taking in belly-dancers. Ah, the good old days...

The caper itself takes a back seat to the characters, posh scenery and assortment of afore-mentioned eye candy, exemplified here by Susannah York, who looks absolutely marvelous in a dark tan, short hair and assortment of bikinis and 'colorful threads'. This is a good thing, IMHO, as she's ten times more enthralling than she was the previous year in a very similar role in 'Kaleidoscope', co-starring with Warren Beatty, where the elaborate caper consumed both the characters and the bulk of the film. Here, the details of the caper are not the vortex of the film; the actors and the results are. I've never seen York in a more befitting role.

Of course, as in all crime caper flicks, there are assorted red herrings to add a hitch to the well-plotted proceedings, and this one has its share, but never fear, Duffy's here, there and everywhere when we need him, and by the conclusion of this amusement park ride, we viewers exit happily and probably ready to take the ride again. I won't spoil it for you by revealing more - if you enjoy 60's comedies, capers, fashions, real tans on real women, sexy and psych cinema, you need to inhale on this one - it's a gas, man, a real gas...",1308182400,17,3412,4.6738768718802

4330905,4,B004CZRE26,"This is a time piece unparalleled.  The loose feel of the Sixties is captured
here completely; before everything went commercial and dark.  The landscape
exposed in this trippy-caper is Hellerwonderful. The long shot goodbye
conversation between Coburn and York is simply brilliant.  Coburn
steals the movie in all ways with his hipness.  If you caught part of it
late at night in the Seventies and loved it; you will bath in its campness
and coolness now.  The soundtrack is worth it alone!  Just Be...Just Be...",1301616000,14,513,4.976470588235294

4330928,5,B004CZRE26,"People would ask me over the years, 'what's your favorite movie"" - my reply was ""Duffy"".
only the reviewers here know why.
people ask what was great about the 60's - this pic shows some of the magic of it.
the plot is the best caper ever to be put on film and not many people know about it.
it's sort of a ""morality crime"".
the music, the color and locations and care-free acting by a bunch of stalworth actors compliments the original idea and amusing script.
it is my dream to go to some of the locations but i am sure they filled with concrete monstrosities (although morocco is probably still pretty wild - even though those scenes were shot in southern spain.
the movie is so well shot you can feel every scene like if you were there.
when the movie came out, i can understand why some critics saw it as a forgettable B movie, there was magic in making of Duffy that only those who know know.",1426118400,2,897,4.251461988304094

4330946,5,B004CZRE26,"""Duffy"" with James Coburn,  of all the films he was in during the Sixties, because even more than the ""Our Man Flint"" films and ""The President's Analyst,"" is my favorite because it defined his screen persona during that decade as the cool, well-traveled ""international man of mystery,"" his own defining moment
. This is s cool, fun and very entertaining film, with a great supporting cast: James Fox, James Mason and Susannah York. The score alternates between upbeat rock and cool jazz, at times a combination of the two. It's an entertaining caper film of the highest order, with Coburn recruited by James Fox, brother John Alderton and girlfriend S. York to steal a huge shipment of cash belonging to their father James Mason on the high seas. ""Duffy"" is amusing, psychedelic, colorful and just plain fun, with an interesting plot twist at the very end. It also features a cool theme sung by Lou R a w l s, ""I'm Satisfied"" : ""As long as I can dig the ride/I'm satisfied."" Highly recommended!",1379030400,7,994,4.712643678160919
4330947,4,B004CZRE26,"Great late 60's caper movie featuring the inimitable James Coburn as Duffy - Sailor, Mercenary, Roustabout, and Lover, of course.  The dialogue is a little dated [Groovy, Baby], but still a lot of fun.  Great location shots in Tangiers.",1378598400,4,236,5.0256410256410255

The best Coburn is, at his sexiest and his most cool.....Some say that Steve McQueen is the ""King of Cool"", NO DICE. James Coburn is, and he is just that in this film. THE MUSIC ALONE is worth buying. Would order again from this seller! Thanks for making a dream come true.  Lyric",1368403200,7,373,4.405797101449275
4330950,5,B004CZRE26,"I had only ever seen clips of Duffy on Youtube, never on TV, so I felt a compunction to buy the DVD to see the film in full and I was not disappointed.

Firstly the plot: a shrewd, scheming, buccaneering and canny millionaire (James Mason) despairs of his dim-wit sons from different marriages (a smug, hippie James Fox and a gormless John Alderton) living off his wealth and amounting to nothing. He clearly can run rings around them effortlessly and never ceases to remind them of it. Fed up with being shown up as duds, and joined by their free-spirited girlfriend, Segolene (Susannah York), they decide to thieve a shipment of money from their father's shipping vessel in the Mediterranean and recruit a former employee of their father's shipping company, Duffy (James Coburn) to lead the operation. Duffy is an ulta-cool, middle-aged but trim hipster living the sixties drug culture ideal in Tangier, Morocco, but he has high standards, is particular in the way he does things and won't put up with being strung along by the brothers. But who is really stealing from whom and who is Segolene aiming to ally herself with at the end?

This really is the epitome of the cool and swinging 60s; it's so relaxed that the plotline is slow to unfold, but I didn't mind as as I was taking in the sumptuous and mellow aura of the setting.

It is clear the cast were having fun. Fox and Alderton look very youthful, Susannah York has never looked more beautiful and alluring, and even a dapper James Mason seems to have rolled back the years. The Daddy-Of-Cool, James Coburn, even by his own standards, redefines cool to such an extent it is almost to the point of self-parody coming fresh off the back of the Derek Flint brace of movies.

The print is pretty well the best I've seen of any film of the period and posseses lush, crisp and vibrant colours. The organ-driven score roles along effortlessly. The fruit machine-inspired opening credits are imaginative and original. The cinematography and script are of a very high standard. The DVD is finished off with an accompanying trailer. Importantly, this is a region free DVD and although Amazon list it as a Region 1, it played no problem at all on my Region 2 DVD / Blu Ray player.

I thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience and would recommend this as a must-have purchase whatever the price.",1362787200,3,2343,4.690997566909975
4330951,5,B004CZRE26,"What a great film! I read an interview with James Coburn where he said it was the favorite film he made. Great cast, and Coburn is even cooler than Flint in this one, and in a very realistic way, too.",1343174400,6,200,4.025
4330952,5,B004CZRE26,"Molto molto molto bellino, qualit del dvd ottima, bel film davvero, misto tra giallo e commedia.

4330954,4,B004CZRE26,"I wore out my videocassette of this one. Coburn really owned the late 60's as the action guy
with a killer smile. He was ready to kick ass or get all zen on you, depending on the occasion. This film sports excellent cinematography of the Mediterranean & a super-cool bachelor pad soundtrack. Films like Austin Powers are trying vainly to re-create what this pulls off effortlessly. It's a psychedelic put-on. How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people? Indeed!
From when I first saw this as a kid, I was astounded by Duffy's Tangiers pad, decorated w/ strange art & sculptures. This film catches a special moment where the counter culture met the swingers, the beatniks & original hipsters passed the baton to the hippies, and even the rich, society people wanted to get in on the scene and dance to the Les McCann-like grooves. Everyone gets used & uses everyone else. The ending is classic, & if you're not smiling, then you don't get the '60's or Coburn-cool.",1337990400,9,970,4.645348837209302
4330955,5,B004CZRE26,"A fantastic slice of hipness from the sixties that captures the flavor of it's time in a magical way.
This movie will transport you to a time when real actors captured your attention and held on to it until the film concluded with a bang.
Jim Coburn is at the top of his game as the aging hippy, Duffy. Duffy is pulled into a crime caper by the sons of James Mason who want to get back at dad to the tune of stealing dad's hard earned loot. Mason is ice cold as the regretful dad of two morons who aren't fit to tie his shoelaces but are intelligent enough to recruit Duffy into pulling off the audacious theft. Susannah York is on hand as the sexy foil who comes between Duffy and Mason's sons and........nah! That would be telling.
I'll leave the nifty ending to the viewer to savor. Enjoy!",1320969600,6,792,4.251655629139073

8424173,1,B004CZRE26,"I bought this film not knowing anything about it other than it was a 1960's heist flick starring James Coburn. How bad could it be, right? Unfortunately, over a grueling hour and forty-one minutes, I would be made to find out.

This era and genre spawned some truly great pictures; HOW TO STEAL A MILLION (1966), GRAND SLAM (1967), THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR (1968), THE ITALIAN JOB (1969), and even the original OCEAN'S 11 (1960) spring to mind. Sadly, this movie lacks all the charm, intrigue, suspense, originality, and style of those films.

Honestly, it's as though the filmmakers involved in this production had only recently been made aware of the concepts of conflict, tension, and suspense, and were only just beginning to dabble in their usage. The only thing that could possibly make this movie an enjoyable experience is if you viewed it over the silhouettes of a guy and his two snarky robot friends.",1488240000,,910,4.826923076923077

8424180,3,B004CZRE26,"Directed by Robert Parrish and partly set in ""groovy"" mod London (but mainly Almera, Andaluca, Spain), crime caper DUFFY (UK/USA-1968) stars James Coburn, James Mason, James Fox and John Alderton. An at times annoyingly repetitive soundtrack is by cool cat keyboardist Ernie Freeman.

This one's awash with the anachronistic slang of that era and since screenwriter Harry Joe Brown Jr. was a Beverly Hills native, he sometimes has the British characters using expressions that are peculiarly American.

An early odd moment: one of the young Brits (Fox) makes a Sgt. Pepper's reference (""tangerine trees and marmalade skies"") to which Coburn sings an off-key ""Lucy in the sky with diamonds"" response.

Typical of the day, we have more than one party sequence to get through. A brief such scene has Coburn toking on a hookah while Freeman's Hammond organ leads a small club band. This moment is all motion, captured by a handheld camera. It just feels like a shoehorned in extra.

DUFFY is exactly what IMDb voters have rated it, a middling (5.9) heist picture, where a hip American crook helps two snobby upper class brothers rip off a ship that's transporting all of their disrespected papa's funds: ""Just over a million pounds, or if you prefer, just under three million dollars.""

TRIVIA: This was originally called ""Avec-Avec,"" that is, ""with it"" in French.
COLUMBIA wisely chose a new title despite objections from the film's main cast.",1431043200,,1440,5.059071729957806
