8319150,4,B001LNOMPE,"OK 60's West German-made, English-dubbed black-and-white jungle adventure.  A woman hires a somewhat disreputable river boat captain to transport her into the deep Amazonian jungle to search for her missing father.  They run afoul of jungle pirates who make their search and their lives miserable.  The DVD-R is adequate quality but it is obvious that the film has not been re-mastered.  I think this is the only version available.  Recommended for adventure fans.",1430611200,,464,5.301369863013699
