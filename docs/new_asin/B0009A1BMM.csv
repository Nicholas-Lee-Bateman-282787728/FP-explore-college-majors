2274103,5,B0009A1BMM,"The Last Chapter isn't so much about Bikers as it is about power; deals made and broken, promises not kept, and lies to family and friends. Canada's largest Biker gang, the Triple Sixers, wants a conduit to Ontario. Bob Durelle (Michael Ironside) wants to be that conduit, with 10 new Triple Six chapters of his own, while best friend Ross Desbiens (Roy Dupuis) wants no part of the Sixers. Bob and Ross make a secret deal to divide and conquer, but as Bob grows more and more powerful, can he hold up his end of the deal? Does he still want to?

This series is not about dudes on bikes. It digs so much deeper into the souls of the gang leaders, exposing us to their families, their friends, their loyalties, and their trust. Marini Orsini gives an amazing performance in the role of Bob's wife, who can't believe what's happening before her very eyes. Also outstanding is Michel Forget as Guenette, the police force's Biker ""expert,"" who actually understands the Biker's mindset as he tries desperately to keep the peace, even after ""his services are no longer required.""

In the Last Chapter Two, loyalty and trust are a thing of the past. Bikers are double- and triple-dealing, and it's a little difficult to keep the players straight as they change allegiances back and forth and back again. Bob learns it isn't always good to be da king, as take-over pressures mount from all sides.

Yes, the Bikers do ride bikes in this series. But this is also the story of how they live, and of how they die.

There are extras on every disk, but I would advise watching the entire series before watching the extras, particularly the ""Deleted Scenes"" and the ""Last Chapter Files."" They need to be seen, but they can spoil the story if you haven't watched the entire film.",1131062400,26,1763,4.6050955414012735
2274104,3,B0009A1BMM,"I discovered this item while browsing for biker stuff.  The description said ""Sopranos on Harleys"" so I invested.  This was a miniseries that aired in Canada, and was not shown in the US.  I didn't get the Sopranos feel from it, and there truthfully weren't enough riding scenes for my taste, but it was still passable in other ways.  I believe this must have been inspired by real events between biker clubs in Canada, I won't name them, but you can find the headlines.  They must have had some advisors detailing the way things work inside a club.  For instance, they were using chalkboards and talking with their mouths covered to avoid surveillence.  A small part of this is in french with subtitles, but it was a Canadian production.

  The story is of a small club that patches over (joins by changing their name and colors) to one of the big clubs to consolidate drug deals.  There is dissention in the ranks and a few of the little guys refuse to join.  Things quickly become unfriendly and the brotherhood erodes with well placed car bombs and drive by shootings.  Women will probably root for the pretty boy (Dupuis) but like the real deal, there are no good guys.  Michael Ironside excels in showing the slide from the top to deep paranoia.  But its the guys in the background that keep it interesting.

  This is both parts 1 and 2 and lasts about 9 hours.  It is pretty entertaining and also informative, if you know what you're looking at.",1129593600,16,1453,4.562015503875969
2274105,5,B0009A1BMM,This is an awesome mini series.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and recomend to all!  Once I started watching...I couldn't stop!!  I had to go through both vol 1 & 2 marathon. Awesome story...great acting!!  If you like the Soprano's...you'll love this!!  You won't be disappointed.,1127260800,6,275,5.022222222222222

2274107,3,B0009A1BMM,"The series got way too dramatic near the end.  Once it wasn't about biker gangs and about a boss's marital affairs, it got very boring.  Good biker gang exposure for the most parts though.",1382486400,,188,4.5

2274110,5,B0009A1BMM,"The overall acting shines in this epic story of the Canadian biker gang era.  The show is about a broken friendship and trust set against the backdrop of Harleys, power, and corruption.  I bought this years ago, have watched it several times, and highly recommend it.",1349222400,,267,4.782608695652174
2274111,3,B0009A1BMM,I was expecting more riding and was a little bored during the first 2 parts. The last two parts were much better. The overall story line was more like the Sopranos or something. It's just a typical story line of what some people conceive about motorcycle clubs.,1346198400,,261,4.574468085106383
2274112,5,B0009A1BMM,"A great series that came BEFORE - SONS OF ANARCHY.  In Fact, is it possible that SONS OF ANARCHY plagarized some of LAST CHAPTER?

If you want to see MIchael Ironside play a fully blown character, this is a MUST SEE.  Great character development, plot and story line.  The show grabs you from the beginning and drags you in.  Hard to wait for the next show.  And, hated it when it was over!

2274113,5,B0009A1BMM,"I loved this movie! As a huge fan of Roy Dupuis since his days of La Femme Nikita, I was intrigued and bought the movie, not knowing much about the series. It's about two men,Bob Durelle and Ross Desbiens, played by Michael Ironside and Roy Dupuis respectively, who decide to straddle the biker gang fence. Bob takes his crew and merges with the Sixers whereas Ross makes alliances with another gang, so that the Sixers don't completely take over. These two men are best friends at the start of the series, but by the end, they're bitter enemies. A tragic situation pits Ross early on against Bob and suddenly, their fake feud isn't so fake. This series is about how absolute power corrupts absolutely in the case of Bob Durelle, who becomes high on the good life of being associated with the Triple Sixers. It's a great series. It's been unfairly compared to the Sopranos, but considering I've never seen that series, I loved TLC. This series reminded me of how Roy's Michael (from LFN) would behave if Nikita was dead and he had nothing left to lose. I adored his deviousness in getting revenge and Roy looks incredibly delicious with the long hair. :D His voice is deepened in this series, so it takes getting used to if you were primarily a fan of LFN, but it works. And well.

It was filmed both in French and English and I purchased the series in English. As much as I love Roy's other films, it was nice on the ears to hear him speaking English again...Although, French sounds utterly delicious as well. ;P Enjoy! I sure did.",1325289600,,1532,4.530685920577618
2274114,5,B0009A1BMM,"This is a well acted mini series. It is taut and suspenseful. If you are looking for just a fast moving, shootum
up type of movie, this is not it. It has good dialogue and keeps you guessing as you are never quite sure what to expect. Very good show and worth the price for both part 1 and 2.",1325116800,,292,3.8833333333333333
2274115,5,B0009A1BMM,"I had a very poor quality VHS home made copy of The Last Chapter that I bought in the late 90's and it was very hard to watch. It was taped by a Canadian off the television . It was just recently released in the US on DVD and I ordered it right away ! It is a story of a large motorcycle club that is taking in smaller clubs to expand. The new leader is not really a biker but a yuppie who takes up golf and drives an expensive sports car. He is a killer and sits on top of a large drug business . This show sucks you in , I actually like it better than Sons of Anarchy . It is like the Sopranos on Wheels and is much more realistic than some other biker shows . I give it three thumbs up !",1312156800,4,690,3.668918918918919
2274116,5,B0009A1BMM,"This was either a series or mini-series for CBC and is a dramatization of the so-called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/biker-wars/dp/0676975992/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""biker wars""</a>&nbsp;between the HA's and (apparently)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/every-other-club-in-Canada/dp/0470677635/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">every other club in Canada</a>.

The similarities are so blatant that the Matadores don't sport an M/C patch.  If you watch closely, you'll see that their patch reads, MG - motorcycle gang, just like the Bandido's did at one point in the 70's.

This series is hard-core and makes the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sons-of-Anarchy/dp/B003L77GK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sons of Anarchy</a>&nbsp;look like a bunch of boy scouts.

2274117,5,B0009A1BMM,This is a wonderful example of Canada's ability to make good movies. I enjoy the entire series. It was a informative story that was more in depth than any American film has done. I would love to see more of Canada works available on Amazon.,1277769600,2,240,4.355555555555555
2274118,5,B0009A1BMM,"After the series LeFemme Nikita ended I hoped that Roy Dupuis would do another series.  I soon realized this would probably not happen after reading and seeing several post Nikita interviews.  When I heard that he was making a mini-series in Canada I had hoped that it would be shown in the US, but it was not. I was happy to be able to locate it and purchase it on Amazon.  It lived up to its name, The Last Chapter. As always Roy Dupuis'performance is thought provoking and real. Without giving away any of the plot his role as Ross is as introspective and riveting as that of Michael Samuel.",1276473600,4,594,4.381818181818182
2274119,5,B0009A1BMM,"You don't have to be particularly interested in bikers to enjoy this mini-series. The plot is complex, with well-developed central characters. The script is top-notch and the cast is uniformly excellent. It's a tragedy that starts playing out its inevitable outcome from the very first episode. Greed, the lust for power, and revenge all play a part in moving its main characters, played by Michael Ironside and Roy Dupuis, to their bitter destinies.",1255219200,6,450,5.178082191780822

2274123,1,B0009A1BMM,Very slow series. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It was truly a waste of time and money.,1205798400,2,92,4.166666666666667
2274124,2,B0009A1BMM,"This is a slow moving, poorly acted, low production valued affair all the way around. More importantly though, I don't think the producers would know what a true 1%er is like if one came up and robbed them at gun point. I have spent a good deal of my life around real bikers and guess what? They don't go to art galleries, don't drink wine over candle light while discussing club business, don't live in mansions, oh, and they ride motorcycles. A 1%er would never wear their cut in a van or car, would never allow disrespect from fellow bikers, and sure as HELL wouldn't let their old ladies have a say in anything they did. This struck me as a very bad attempt at the style of intrigue you find in the Sopranos but failed greatly.

  Save your time, your money, and hopes for a real show about real bikers. This series with it's clean 1%ers who have cocktail parites at their mansions, talk about their art work while cooking gourmet meals, and hanging out in their squeaky clean club house's just fails on so many levels. Now then, if you are a biker, hang around bikers, or have a clue what it is to be a 1%er then at the very least you will get as many laughs out this comedy as I did.",1199750400,7,1189,4.252212389380531
2274125,4,B0009A1BMM,"This is a drama based on the entrance of a large motorcycle gang into the Ontario market: a thinly veiled depiction of the Hells Angels, called the ""triple-sixers"".  In 2000-2001 the HA entered the Ontario market through a series of patchovers of existing clubs such as the Satan's Choice, Para Dice Riders, Lobos and Vagabonds.  The plot is realistic enough, with Canadian production values (fellow Canucks will know what this means): earnest, made in two versions shot concurrently, one for each official language (English and French).  If you are interested in the subject, you will find this engaging.  Even as a basic crime show it holds up.  The police, for the most part, are depicted as more interested in their internal politics than actually catching anyone and the bikers are about what one would expect.  Unique in its Canadian setting and loosely based on real life, it is worth a look.",1176163200,2,899,4.920529801324503

8058581,1,B0009A1BMM,The quality of the DVD itself was fine however; considering the movie aspect of it....the majority of the acting sucked,1421193600,,119,5.0
8058582,1,B0009A1BMM,"This is a 'Biker' movie only using the loosest possible definition.  There is probably a total of 20 minutes of motorcycles in the whole nine hour series.

It's a sad commentary on the Canadian Broadcasting company's concept of the 1% lifestyle.  I'm sure that it was well received....in Canada. However, I have watched it with some of my friends who are Bikers, including some who are 1%ers, and the general consensus was that it was shallow (as in no plot to speak of) and more to the point...BORING...in fact most of the people who watched it with me couldn't remember the last time they played golf.

It even has the obligatory, and completely unnecessary, handicapped person to apparently make it more palatable to the general Canadian public....and of course to help ensure that they would be able to get Canadian Government funding to help the filmmakers fund this snoozer.  In fact the only reason that we could think of for this going on for nine hours, when it would have been better cut to about 60 minutes, is so that the CBC could use it to stuff the network to help them obtain their required, and obligatory percentage of Canadian content.

When some of the 'key' individuals die at the end of the series, you have to wonder why they didn't just kill them off earlier to clean up the script....actually, by the end of the series you find yourself wishing that they would all follow the lead of their Canadian cousins the Lemmings, and hurl themselves into the sea.

I suppose that Canada felt that they had been badly treated when the problems arose between clubs like the Hells Angels, Rock Machine, Bandidos...etc....and tried to 'get even' by producing this series and hoping to make some money off of the problem.  It is however a complete rip-off at anything over $9.00....but of course you will play hell finding it at that price anywhere.

Save your money, or use the $9.00 to buy a copy of Wild Angels...it didn't have a plot either, but at least they were riding motorcycles...and it was amusing.
