8355189,3,B0027W59P0,"In 1970, producer Raymond Chow left Shaw Bros. to establish a new studio, Golden Harvest, expressly to compete with Shaw Bros., which dominated film production in Hong Kong. Golden Harvest's earliest productions, like ANGRY RIVER (Angela Mao's first film), THE INVINCIBLE EIGHT, and this one, THE FAST SWORD (1971), tended to be cheaper, cruder versions of the much slicker Shaw Bros. martial arts films. THE FAST SWORD, however, benefited from extensive location shooting in Taiwan. It also employed a team of three action choreographers to fill the film with a variety of fight scenes, often involving large numbers of combatants, ranging from swordfights to hand-to-hand combat to a heroine wielding a mean whip. One of those choreographers was a young Sammo Hung, who went on to become a major kung fu star (THE MAGNIFICENT BUTCHER) and film director (EASTERN CONDORS) in his own right. He's even seen here to good advantage in at least two of the fight scenes. There are ten major fight scenes overall and they're spread evenly among the film's 84 minutes.

The plot has to do with a hero who kills a brutal warlord to avenge his father and is then arrested by a constable who's been sent by the local magistrate. The constable is a righteous man, so the hero decides to trust him and go back for trial. Their mutual respect and their extensive martial arts expertise insure that when the warlord's thugs come out in force to get their own revenge, the two heroes will fight together against them. The hero's sister, the one with the whip, and blind mother get into the act when the warlord's men attack their farmhouse. The mother uses a heavy walking staff and inflicts quite a few casualties of her own in fight scenes obviously inspired by Japan's Zatoichi films. It gets a little far-fetched at times, especially when the heroes do exaggerated acrobatic stunts and impossibly high leaps and constantly surmount much greater odds. But the pace never flags and the action is often quite imaginative, especially amidst so many natural settings.

The role of the constable is played by Chang Yi, a onetime star of Shaw Bros. films and, later on, a notable villain in the wave of kung fu films made in Taiwan in the late 1970s, including EAGLE'S CLAW and CHALLENGE OF DEATH. The hero under arrest is played by Shih Jun, star of King Hu's A TOUCH OF ZEN. The hero's proactive sister is played by Han Hsiang Chin, an actress I'd never seen before nor have I heard of any of her other films. She's quite good. The blind mother is played by veteran actress Wang Lai (WILD WILD ROSE), whom I've seen many times, but never in fight scenes like these.

The film print used for this DVD has not been restored or remastered, but except for the occasional scratches and minor shifts in color, it looks sharp and bright, better than average for these Fortune Star/Legendary Collection DVDs. The music score consists entirely of cues lifted from Dominic Frontiere's soundtrack for the Clint Eastwood western, HANG 'EM HIGH (1968), an inexplicable staple of so many kung fu films. The only extras on the disc are the three-minute original trailer and a ""photo gallery"" consisting of a handful of original lobby cards.",1323648000,5,3209,4.809782608695652
