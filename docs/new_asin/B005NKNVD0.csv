First of all i love the movie. The animation style is great and i love Picha's humor. Shame of the Jungle (aka Tarzoon),B.C. Rock (original VHS release only) and The Big Bang are all essential to my collection. Absolutely love the animation and humor in all 3.
Now to this release,which unfortunately for most USA customers is in PAL format and will not play in any non region free players.

This release has the movie in French and in English with all the famous voices (John Belushi,Bill Murray etc). The extras include an interview with Picha,storyboards & production, and some great short animated films rarely seen. Unfortunately all the extras are in French but the animated shorts are still very enjoyable since they are mostly visual with minimal dialog.

This is the best looking,best sounding version released BY FAR and the only version ever with extras and the audio is not cut/garbled when ""Shame"" is mentioned. The Australian DVD of the film is from a VHS copy and is hazy pic with avg sound. The recent UK Jungle Burger DVD version is from a dirty print and is not nearly as clear,vibrant picture and has no extras.

I have had multiple VHS and DVD releases of this film over the last 30 years always searching for a better,cleaner,unedited print. The original French version is supposedly about 6-10 minutes longer but does not seem to exist. I have never seen that cut available since i first found this great film on the Z channel in Los Angeles around 1981. There was a lawsuit over the name Shame sounding too much like Shane from the old film so some releases either garbled the audio or cut out the audio any time Shame is mentioned in the movie.
If you can play Pal region 2 DVD,this is absolutely the best version to get bar none. After 30 years I can finally stop looking for a better version of Shame Of The Jungle because (unless the original French version ever surfaces) THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS!
