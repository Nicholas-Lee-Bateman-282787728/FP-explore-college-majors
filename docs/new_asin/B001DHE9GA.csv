3529714,5,B001DHE9GA,"Absolutely one of the most memorable short lived series from the 70's. I actually have a 30 year old copy of it on BETA that I recorded when it was broadcast. Glad to see the studios are releasing some of the lesser known series. Buck Henery pulls off a real good Mel Brooks but with a little more plot and fewer slapstick jokes. Like Firefly, the series had a lot more in it than the studios were willing to support. Too bad.",1219104000,6,426,4.2073170731707314
3529715,5,B001DHE9GA,"Truly a bit of comic SF genius!  It poked fun at every current SF blockbuster out there at the time...the take -off on Star Wars with Hans Conried as the voice of ""The Source"" is worth the price of the series by itself as it is one of the best of the early parodies of the movies.

The series is hokey, it *knows* it's hokey and revels in it.  Like the equally little-known ""Wizards and Warriors"", it mercilessly impales and lampoons an entire genre with a few well-written quips.

If you enjoy good parody, buy this baby.  We need to encourage the studios to both bring these gems out of the vaults and to create more.",1218844800,52,619,4.301724137931035

3529717,5,B001DHE9GA,"""It"" hit the television world on February 24, 1978 like a galaxy-class starship slamming into a Quasi-norm. Quark, NBC's fantastic science-fiction spoof from the mind of Buck Henry, was released about the same time as Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century and Battlestar Galactica were making their impact on the science fiction community. The short-lived series featured Richard Benjamin as Adam Quark along with his crazy crew aboard a spacefaring garbage scow.  Well ahead of it's time, the series has become a cult classic with precious few original copies available -- until now! Buck Henry's oddball creation will easily bring you back (and forth) in time.  Although Amazon briefly covers what the series is all about, here's a little more information on the crew...

Our hero, Adam Quark (Richard Benjamin) commands the United Galaxy Sanitation Patrol ship. Quark's mission?  To collect space baggies from United Galactic spacecraft.  His other mission? Always getting himself into (and out of) trouble.

Quark's love interests are Betty I and Betty II (Cyb and Patricia Barnstable, the Doublemint twins of the 70s). The Betties co-pilot and co-co-pilot the 23rd century starship. The pretty one is the clone.

Ficus Pandorata (Richard Kelton) is a Vegeton. He is the ship's half-man, half-plant, Spock-like science officer.  Wait until you see how he mates!

Gene/Jean (Timothy Thomerson) is a transmute. He/she has an equal number of male and female chromosomes (i.e., he's half-man, half-woman). His male half is never around when Quark needs it -- typically during a fight.

Quark's bosses are Dr. Otto Palindrome (Conrad Janis from Mork and Mindy) and an entity simply known as The Head (Alan Caillou).  The head is a disembodied head floating through space.  Together, they rule the galaxy!  Well, not really.  They rule Quark, and that's good enough for constant laughs.  You'll see...",1217808000,43,1940,5.233009708737864
3529718,4,B001DHE9GA,"Get this for your nerdiest sci-fi friend and have a binge-watching viewing party with this one.  This series was a great parody of TOS Star Trek but also of Glen Larson's ""Buck Rogers"" TV show.

What an amazing idea for a Sci-fi series, intergalactic garbage man with a wacky crew. I love every episode and was so sad when it was cancelled. I highly recommend this series to every Sci-fi comedy fan.",1359849600,,353,3.9859154929577465
3529726,5,B001DHE9GA,"I saw this short-lived series in the mid-late 70's, but it seemed to have vanished from the face of the earth - until it was released on DVD.

Rather quirky and unabashedly coattailing the then-recent release of Star Wars, it was typical of many Buck Henry series in its use of satire and physical humor - but then that's what makes it so enjoyable!  It's pretty good example in the rare genre of ""Sci-Fi Comedy"" and its somewhat cheesy (but fairly good, for the time and budget) effects only add to the charm.",1358208000,,510,4.473118279569892
3529727,2,B001DHE9GA,"Apparently I'm not the only reviewer who had fond memories of watching this very short series when it originally aired in the late 1970s, only to have those recollections shatter against the hard reality of dated humor, weak humor or just-plain-no-humor-at-all. It is today embarrassing and painful to watch -- some bad film and television I can savor alone and wallow in the wonderful badness of it all, but Quark is truly toxic, incapable of being enjoyed without discomfort even solo. Largely devoted to parodying a variety of science fictional tropes and cliches, it makes even Spaceballs look epic. Oh, there was a little bit of good stuff here and there, primarily limited to exchanges between Adam Quark and Ficus, though those bits quickly became repetitious, and Andy the neurotic robot was also a prime hoot. Beyond those spare elements, however, the show was a true mix of bad writing, cheap production and unrewarding stereotypes. It just goes to show you that memory can indeed produce some memorable malfunctions. In the show, Quark was a garbage hauler. At least they got that right.",1353888000,4,1098,5.005464480874317

3529729,5,B001DHE9GA,"A wonderfully tacky spoof on the semi-serious space operas in the 70's. If you get a kick out of watching a Star Trek episode where they shake the cameras and Kirk and Spock run back and forth on the set to simulate an explosion...Or silly space 'types' you'll love this cheesy series. The 'twins', one of whom is a clone and one real, Ficus, half man half plant (The Spock replacement) ...Good stuff! Loved it.",1336262400,,411,4.493333333333333
3529730,3,B001DHE9GA,"This was written as a parody of many SciFi shows that it pokes fun at just to mention a few, Star Wars, Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers, Star Trek, Mork and Mindy....  It was definatley a low budget series and very short lived but it was okay.  If you like spoof type SciFi and some laughs you should like this.  Perhaps if it had lasted longer it might have developed into something better but as it is only 8 episodes they really don't have much character development I can't offer to many praises for this.",1332979200,,503,4.329787234042553

My family loved Farscape. My family loved Spaceballs.  My family loved Star Wars and Star Trek and Get Smart.

3529736,5,B001DHE9GA,"QUARK

This was aired in Queensland (Australia)on ABC TV back in the early 1980's.

Reviewing the DVD, The show was a little slow to start but after the Pilot the crew change and interaction was done very well.
This created an absolute amazing comedy with send ups of just about every Science Fiction show of the past.

The characters are a real scream!

I think it is funny and a well written , Thanks Buck!

What a pity the CEO's canned this like they did to Star Trek!

Enjoy it! Even if you only see it for a Millisecond!

The price is right and that's no Garbage!

3529737,4,B001DHE9GA,I remember not only watching this show as a kid but also my Daddy liking it a lot as well. This late-70's NBC series which lasted less than a full season (it was a mid-season replacement series) spoofed just about every major sci-fi genre around at the time. Goofy? Yes. Cheesy? Absolutely! Stupid? Sometimes. But fun to watch for some mindless humor.,1297900800,,351,4.67741935483871

3529739,3,B001DHE9GA,"This rather trippy late 1970's early 1980's light comedy series (lasting a mere 8 episodes) was, I gather, a piss-take on the run of sci-fi movies doing the rounds at the time, a bit of Alien, Star Wars, Battlestar Gallactica, Buck Rogers, Spaceballs and even Star Trek.  It featured Richard Benjamin (Westworld) in the title role of Adam Quark, commander of a Garbage Scow spacecraft, with the raucous crew consisting of Clone(ttes) Betty/Betty (played by twins Cyb & Trisha Barnsdale) a trans-mute Gene/Jean (played by Timothy Thomerson) a vegetoid (?) Ficus (played by Richard Kelton) and a deranged & cowardly android named Andy (voiced by Bobby Porter).  Each episode commences at the base station of 'Perma-One' run by Pallendrome (Conrad Janis of Mork & Mindy) and 'Headed' (pardon the pun) by his boss known only as 'The Head' (played by Alan Calliou).  The storylines are a little on the 'under-done' side, in the original (first) episode there was another Crew member named Doc whose only mission was to tend to Andy, and then without so much as a whisper he was written out and replaced with Ficus (his introduction to the series was never included).  The odd 'guest' star such as Melody Anderson playing Interface (a space tele-communications operator with 4 arms) and Hans Conreid voicing a character called 'The Source' was a slight relief to the tedium.  Originally written by Buck Henry (Get Smart), it suffered at times with a lack-lustre script and storylines, the old chestnut of 'The good, the bad and the ficus' was a direct rip-off of a Star Trek episode of split dimensions good Kirk & bad Kirk, was a rather desperate and sadly failed attempt to CPR this beast.  I recall seeing the series when it was originally shown - I enjoyed it then for its quirkiness (or is that quarkiness??), however nearly 30 years on, it won't be remembered as a pioneer of 'space' comedy, rather more as a brief blip on the scan-o-scope. Bit of a giggle - and alot of kitsch!",1289174400,2,1978,4.802941176470588
3529740,3,B001DHE9GA,"I'm not  a big sci-fi fan but my boyfriend is.  I do however like a good sci-fi comedy, so when I saw this recommended based on other movies and tv shows I thought well I'll just rent it as it seems like something both of us could agree on.

In the end I think the both of us did agree ""It's no Red Dwarf"".  The concept and descriptions are, in our opinions, much better than the actual execution.

We have The Head - just what his name implies, a giant head that appears on a screen.  He's the big boss.  Palindrome - he's Quark's immediate boss, running the base where Quark is stationed and acting as the intermediary between The Head and Quark and the others.  Ficus - a Vegeton aka a plant in human form, very Spock like personality wise (he replaces a professor from the pilot episode, luckily - as that character didn't quite work).  Andy - the robot who gets one of the best scenes of the series but otherwise is pretty annoying.  The Betties - one Betty is the ""real Betty"" and one is a clone, they spend the series fighting over which is which.  Gene/Jean - a transmute, both male and female, more male than female but switching at random potentially leading to interesting situations.  And last but not least, Quark.  Ahh Quark - the space garbage man who complains a lot about garbage duty and yet realizes if he wants to get ahead and someday end up with a real ship he needs to play nice and do everything that is asked of him, work his way up through the ranks.  He also somehow almost never really ends up picking up garbage but instead ends up in the worst of the worst situations and never really gets credit for that.

Sounds fun, right?  It sort of is.  Still as we watched we couldn't help but feel as though the person who came up with the idea handed it over to people who didn't quite follow through properly.  We'd find ourselves saying ""If they'd done this instead...""  The show just started to get into its groove as it ended, so it's really hard to judge what they could have really done with it.",1284076800,2,2024,4.306878306878307
3529741,5,B001DHE9GA,So glad I bought this DVD but I should have got 2 as my 14yr old son has claimed it. It arrived faster than expected.,1280016000,,117,3.72
3529742,4,B001DHE9GA,"Few remember this program as it came and went so quickly in 1977, but it is quite funny.  There are only nine episodes so Sony threw in an episode of ""I Dream Of Jeannie"" and an episode of ""Fantasy Island"".  I docked them one star for that as I fail to see the connection.",1271635200,,272,4.018518518518518
3529743,4,B001DHE9GA,"Quark? No, this is not a series about the DS9 bar owner. But, I have to wonder if Star Trek made its own tribute to this series by naming its funniest character (ever!) after this series.  I diidn't realize it was only 8 episodes when I ordered it. That's a bit slim, but I suppose they have a to make some money on it to make it worth their effort. They included a couple of entertaining bonus episodes from other TV shows, just to fill the disc.
  I thought this was hilarious when I was a kid, I thought the Barnstable twins were super hot! Well, friends, I was a gullible kid, what can I say! It's still entertaining and a worthy addition to any SciFi buff's collection. Like most Mel Brooks stuff, the more you watch it, the funnier it gets. The special effects are ok, actually not quite as good as Space Academy, but passable. It is a comedy after all. Enjoy!",1268352000,6,866,4.2682926829268295
3529744,5,B001DHE9GA,"I originally watched Quark when it was aired back in the late `70s and fondly remembered it as a funny, hip sci-fi spoof.  When I found it had been released on DVD I had to get it, eagerly sat down to watch it with my teenage daughter having told her several times how much I enjoyed it at her age.

YIKES!  What was Buck Henry thinking?  Was this thing a product of a lost weekend at studio 54?  Exactly how much coke would one have to do to believe this was a good idea?  I mean I was a stupid kid, they were entertainment professionals!  Re-watching this drek has put in question all of my opinions and memories from back then.  Do I need to rethink my old friends?  Do I need to discard all my warmest high school memories as now suspect and unreliable?

Luckily there are only eight episodes to get though and as another TV show once observed: ""Eight is Enough"".  Thank you Sony Pictures for driving yet another nail into the coffin of my youth.

3529745,4,B001DHE9GA,"I like TV shows on DVD because it lets you whatch what you want whenever you want. It doesn't matter if any channel airs it in syndication or not, and most channels pick from the same pool of shows to air in syndication anyway it seems. I really like discovering obscure and short-lived series on DVD. I like seeing something that I never knew of, or only vaguely remember. This short-lived series ""Quark"" falls into the ""Never Knew Of"" category, but I'm glad DVD has let me find out about it.
This show is a space adventure spoof, kind of like ""Spaceballs"" but from years earlier. This show is about the crew of a garbage collecting spaceship who end up saving the galaxy from dangers other that just overflowing waste-baskets and dumpsters. I love the low-budget, quirky design of the props, sets, and costumes. The ship itself is hilarious when they show it collecting garbage, which itself is in a gigantic garbage bag! I also like how the costume department was inconsistent with the insignia patches on everybody's uniforms. I'm glad that they included the pilot episode, even though it includes the old ship's engineer as the one who built Andy the nervous robot instead of Quark himself as stated in the other seven episodes. I like the rest of the crew - the non-emotional plant-man Ficus (spoof of Spock) who replaced the old guy, Gene/Jean the tough guy/sensitive woman, and Betty & Betty who argue about which is the clone and which is real. I also like the crew from the space station headquarters - Otto Palindrome the sniveling bureaucrat, his assistant who was introduced in episode two and looks and sounds like a cousin of Cousin It, and The Head the main guy in charge of the galaxy who is a big floating head, and of course the other ships' captains who each episode are given exciting assignments while Quark is sent on a suicide mission or a mundane garbage collecting run that somehow turns into a suicide mission.

3529746,4,B001DHE9GA,"Star Wars really had the nations attention in the late 70's and suddenly outer space was cool again. Shows like Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rodgers & Blake's 7 were riding out the Star Wars craze while Quark was poking fun at it. This short lived sci-fi comedy from 1978 stars Richard Benjamin (""West World"") as Adam Quark the captain of an intergalactic garbage ship who dreams of glory but ends up collecting trash instead. Tim Thomerson (""Trancers"") in an early role here credited as Timothy Thomerson plays Gene/Jene a transmute who has the DNA of both male and female (he/she will switch personalities without warning) is a stand out. Conrad Janis (""Mork & Mindy"") is Quarks' supervisor Palindrome and Cyb and Patricia Barnstable (The Doublemint girls for anyone who is old enough to remember those ads) as Betty & Betty, twins who claim that the other is a ""clone"" who are both hot to trot for Quark's attention with their... shall we say assets. Slinky sexy half naked women applenty in this low budget comedy created by Buck Henry (co-creator of ""Get Smart"" & writer for ""Saturday Night Live"") that cleverly pokes fun of the conventions of sci-fi, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, Star Trek and countless other sci-fi staples.

3529749,5,B001DHE9GA,"Ignoring the laugh track, this series had so much potential!  There were some hilarious moments making fun of all the sci-fi shows before it.

Of special humor was the two part episode about ""IT"".  IT was more of a rock, but they made fun of the force.  There is also a scene where Quark is granted a promotion to another ship, and does a Kirk-like stand up for his crew saying he doesn't want the promotion if his crew doesn't come with him.  The ""Head"" says very well and vanishes.  This leaves Quark saying how that isn't negotiation!  Trust me, you have to see it to appreciate it.

When I heard it was released to DVD I was thrilled. If you like Spaceballs and corny humor ala Get Smart, you'll love Quark! I watched all eight episodes over two nights.
I expected to be disappointed. Things are NEVER as good as you remembered them as a kid. Not so this time!

My kids love it and are currently wearing it out.

3529758,4,B001DHE9GA,"You have to know the shows and characters (OMG, the character names!!! ;-) being satirized, parodied, lampooned and otherwise skewered.  There are many hysterical moments:
* The Betty's blowing up an evil ship, then making hash-marks with a lipstick on their battle station.
* Quark apologizing to Princess Libido in her guard disguise just before she decks him.
* The enraged Betty's screaming ""Plant!"" at Ficus after he criticizes their dancing on Polumbus.
* Ficus and Joan Van Ark pollinating together: ""Was it good for you?""  ""I think so?!????!?""
* An antique Quark falling face down onto Princess Carna's sleeping dais and having to be rolled over like a log by Carna's serving wenches.

Yes, the EFX are hokey.  Yes, the plots are questionable.  Yes, the acting is a bit rough in spots.  Yes, the female flesh is all too apparent.  Get over it; so was the original Star Trek for the first 8 episodes (and if you doubt that, go back and compare the first 8 episodes when the writers and actors were also still struggling with the characters to the second season shows when everything had gelled).

Alas, we got no more than the first draft of Quark.  But it was hysterical while it lasted, if you know your pre-quark SF and enjoy a good harpooning.

Four stars only because of a complete lack of any Quark-related content except the shows.  We could easily have had a section of publicity stills or other material, but we got nothing.",1227571200,7,1440,4.72

It's dated, it's corny, but some ideas were actually rather advanced. The idea of a vegetable as a crew member (think Farscape's Zan) was weird at the time, but with time, became an interesting concept to explore.

3529764,1,B001DHE9GA,"I've read fan writings concerning this show that hail it as the next best thing since sliced bread. But the whole time I was watching it all I could think of was what were they watching that I wasn't?

Could it be one of those shows you watched as a kid that you remember fondly yet when you view it as an adult you realize how wrong you were? I grew up in the seventies and didn't get to see this show before it was pulled. As I watch it now on DVD I'm amazed less that there are fans than by the fact it wasn't pulled sooner.

Richard Benjamin stars as Adam Quark, the captain of a spaceship responsible for picking up intergalactic garbage. Cheesy effects show the ship reaching out with mechanical hands to lift and intake a giant green garbage bag while floating in space. And that's one of the funniest jokes it offers.

Tim Thomerson (an unappreciated actor) plays Gene/Jean, a hybrid of male/female parts whose demeanor changes depending on who is in control at the moment. While this character has some of the funniest moments, it is a one note joke that falls flat fast.

Conrad Janis of MORK AND MINDY fame is the desk jockey that sends Quark and his crew out on ridiculous missions. A catastrophic attack is planned on our galaxy. Who best to send? Quark and the garbage scow!

The show came out around the time that science fiction was at an all time high. With the success of STAR WARS in theaters and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA on television, one would think that the world was ripe for a parody of the genre. It was. But this was not the one to do it right. The short film HARDWARE WARS was funnier in less than 15 minutes than this entire series.

The creator behind the series was Buck Henry. It hadn't been long since Henry had teamed up with writer Mel Brooks (yes writer as he had yet to direct yet) to make one of the funniest spoofs seen on television, GET SMART. After watching QUARK I thought back to the laughs from SMART and from Brooks other films. It left me with the feeling that the best of SMART came from Brooks and not Henry.

I've seen this show called a spoof, a parody and a satire of the times. And yet while watching it, and yes I did sit through it, I was left wondering where the charm was for this series so hailed by its fans. Where was the wit? Where was the comedy? Most importantly, where were the laughs (other than those on the overused laugh track)?

I never cracked a smile during the entire running time. I never found myself drawn in by the cheesiness of the sets and effects. I understood that they were attempting humor with them but they weren't the least bit funny.

So what does that make QUARK in the long run? A show that die hard fans have longed for and now have the chance to own. A memory that may not live up to the hype or those same memories of what it was. At worst, is it a show that was low on laughs. I would recommend this series to one group of people: its fans. All others beware.",1225152000,14,2947,4.257602862254025
3529765,1,B001DHE9GA,"The world could do with a good science fiction parody. This isn't it. Everyone involved with this show forgot the basic idea behind a comedy: being funny.

Right from the opening theme you know you're in trouble. The music is a definite reference to Star Trek, but the visuals are nothing but trite sci-fi cliches. Couldn't they have done something a little bit funny for the opening they'd show every week? I don't think the idea occurred to them. (I almost forgot-- Conrad Janis does something weird with his eyes. ha freakin' ha)

The pilot episode should be banned forever as a form of unbearable torture. The second episode shows that serious re-thinking of the show was done, and a new character, Ficus was added. They should have re-thought the idea of doing the show at all. From the unbearable torture of the pilot episode, the remaining episodes sometimes make it all the way up to ""really lame"".

Ficus actually is the best part of the show, but perhaps Star Trek's Spock is just so parody-able. But as you watch Ficus, you end up wishing that you could transport him out of this show into one that had decent writers and decent co-stars.

Richard Benjamin (Quark) has all the comic presence and timing of a used tea bag. With him as the star, it wouldn't matter if the writing didn't stink, the direction didn't stink, and the visuals didn't stink. Benjamin is enough to sink the show on his own.

The other actors appear game, but they don't have anything to work with. The character of Gene/Jean is just stupid. Betty and Betty have nothing to do. Andy the robot sounds like his lines were written by a third-grader.

A comedy has the right to use some really bad special effects. And if they had tried to work that angle, there could have been some laughs. But they want to be impressive and then make such stupid mistakes as using exactly the same model ships to represent both the good guys and the bad guys. Done with a wink and a smile, that could have been funny. But since it was done deadly serious, I was left wondering what the heck was supposed to be going on.

A total waste of time and money.",1223942400,10,2119,4.502604166666667
3529766,5,B001DHE9GA,"If Buck Henry is  behind it, it has to be good, right?  If you believe that, then you may have never seen Quark.

Produced from 1977-78, Quark starred Richard Benjamin as Adam Quark, Captain of the  United Galactic Sanitation Patrol ship, Richard Kelton as Fiscus (vegetable-human officer), Tricia and Cyb Barstable as Betty and Betty, clone twin engineers (for the price of one), and Timothy Thomerson as Gene/Jean, a transmute male/female officer.  Conrad Janis of Mork and Mindy fame, played Palindrome, and the `Head' included the top half of the shoulders of Alan Cailou.  While only lasting 8 episodes, the show has garnered an audience for memorable TV series  viewers, if not for the sheer lunacy of the show.

Imagine, a garbage scow captain saving the universe from the evil High Gorgon, Zoltar the Magnificent and Zargon the Malevolent.  Only on TV they say.  But, you can do anything with the Source (this is not a commercial for Radio Shack) if you only believe in it...anything...except explain just how Betty and Betty manage to hang onto Captain Quark in times of trouble, and those darned Daisy Duke short sets in the middle of space.  There must be some kind of fashion program at Perma One.  Gene/jean is funny however, as the he-she character switches at the wrong (did I break a nail) times.  As a science officer, Fiscus, is intelligent, but annoying.  The `Head' used here is obviously inspiration for Third Rock (and Shatner) who did the floating head routine so much better inspite of needing singing lessons.

While the characters are memorable, the episodes suffer from something resembling too much effort for so little return.  Even the laugh track seems strained.  The stunts just stink at time.  But, remember, it's all about the audience, and Quark screams ""watch Me"".

The 8 episodes presented are:

Quark (Give me garbage or give me death)
May the Source Be with You  (Star Wars never had it so good)
The Old and The Beautiful (The blind and the bald)
The Good, the Bad and the Ficus (Just where is the `good' Quark)
Goodbye, Polumbus (Shore Leave redux)
