I liked it very much.

The juxtaposition of witchcraft,
mesmerism, parasitic infection
and possessing spirit is a great theme
and it is realized well.

The music and colors create
a lot of spooky atmosphere.

There are moments of great tension
and some cringe induction.
There is a little gore as well.
Just enough.
Creepiness too.

The acting is quite good.
I particularly appreciate the characters
behaving as mature adults
which is somewhat of a rarity
in horror films.

For a scary movie good time,
""Parasite"" will not disappoint.",1230595200,3,568,5.0
