2793189,5,B000OCXNPI,"There is no question...this is a show for 'blokes' primarily:

""Are you married?""
""No, I've always walked with a limp""

It's hard to sum up the genius of The Sweeney. When you watch 'Snatch' and 'Lock Stock...' they are good movies but you watch The Sweeney and there is no overacting...it's all almost natural. The one-liners are delivered with as much ease as asking someone to pass the salt.  Reagans snarly face and caustic wit, Carter's ethics but overriding loyalty and the leash pulling guv Haskins or 'askins just add constant flavor and spice to each episode.

The villians are always one-dimensional no good fiends. Everyone always gets hauled in for questioning with no regard for red-tape ""nick 'im an' all""

It's wonderful stuff. No great mystery or plots but great characters. John Thaw was a genius RIP but Dennis Waterman is almost like Nicholas Lyndhurst's Rodney to Del Boy...he's crucial to Thaw's Reagan.",1186704000,9,924,4.974025974025974
2793190,5,B000OCXNPI,"If you're a Brit this TV show is as famous as Starsky & Hutch, so allow me to address the US consumer for a moment.

Remember when US TV comedy was mostly cringe inducing twaddle, but British TV comedy was genius stuff like Fawlty Towers and Good Neighbors?  What you DIDN'T know was that serious British TV drama was often just as brilliant, but didn't translate as well (""too British"") and had no hope of a US licensing deal to allow you to see it.

And thus we have THE SWEENEY, a ground-breaking show about Britain's elite coppers The Flying Squad. (Cockney rhyming slang: Flying Squad = Sweeney Todd = The Sweeney.)  Previous British police shows had been relatively genteel affairs, but THE SWEENEY exposed the raw side of street policing.  Inspector Jack Regan (John Thaw of Inspector Morse fame) is a born cop and a stone predator in the crime jungle.  He will bend the rules when necessary to achieve rough justice.  His sidekick George Carter (Dennis Waterman) often calls his methods into question, but is always ready when the scrap is on.

Rather than dissect every episode and angle, let me just say that if you cherish great acting, strong casting, inventive plotting and tasty style, THE SWEENEY will afford you many hours of pleasure.  The dialog will, at times, require a US viewer to listen attentively.  Once you've watched a few episodes and gotten into the London and Manchester argot, it becomes easier.  I could wish for an English subtitle track in future series however.  It's been a lifesaver with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-on-Mars-Series-1-Region-2/dp/B000RKBU5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life on Mars: Series 1 [Region 2</a>] where it can get a bit thick.",1183334400,28,1739,5.193548387096774
2793191,5,B000OCXNPI,"American viewers will know John Thaw from 'Morse' but for many British viewers he will always be 'Jack Reagan' of Scotland Yard's Flying Squad.

The Sweeney was complusive viewing in the nineteen seventies. The Sweeney is cockney slang for the Flying Squad a group of elite dectectives who battle organised crime, armeed robbery and other crimes carried out by professional criminals.

THe success of the show is due to the partership of John Thaw as Inspecter Jack Reagan and his sidekick Sargent George Carter played by Denis Waterman. Reagan and Carter spend as much of their time drinking, smoking and chasing women as they do catching criminals, this is the seventies after all. Morse may use his brains to catch the criminal, Reagan is more likely to use his fists.

Unlike other British dectective shows the Sweeney does not involve complex murder cases set amougst the middle classes. The bad guys in the Sweeney are working class armed robbers, professional burglars and safe crackers. Reagan and Carter while being totaly honest (the real Flying Squad was famous for it's corruption) behave just like the villians they chase.

Because guns have always been less common in Britain than in the US, even amougst criminals, the Sweeney contains some great fight scenes as the police battle it out with criminals armed with pickaxe handles, chains etc. The show also has some great comic one liners making it one of the most funny drama series ever.

The Sweeney is a must for all lovers of cop shows.

A few of the slang terms used in the show are,

Bird -  Woman
Blag -  Robbery
Blagger -  Robber
Blower -  Telephone
Bottle -  Nerve or courage as in 'lost his bottle'
Brahams -  Drunk
Bubble -  A Greek
Drum -  House or flat
Face -  Known criminal
Germans -  Hands
Have it away -  To escape, in particular to escape with stolen goods,
  also to have sex
Manor -  An area of London, a police district.
Monkey -  500
Nick -  Police station
Nicked -  Arrested, as in your nicked.
Pony -  25
Score -  20
Skip -  Police Sargent
Slagg -  Orginaly a women who slept arround, now a general term of abuse.
Smudge -  Photograph
Tealeaf -  Thief
Tom -  Jewelry or a prostitute.
Ton -  one hundred especially 100
Tooled up -  Armed",1179964800,48,2226,4.596938775510204
2793192,5,B000OCXNPI,"If you don't know your Mockney slang (Cockney rhyming slang), you might have some difficulty following one of the grittiest cop shows on either side of the Atlantic. Long before NYPD Blue was catching the attention of our FCC censors, The Sweeney (Scotland Yard's Flying Squad of plain clothes detectives) was thrust upon UK viewers in the mid 70's, with some harsh language, occasional topless girls, and the over the top, violent antics of the fiercest cops in England.

John Thaw, as Detective Inspector Jack Regan, perfectly fills what is possibly his best known role, apart from Inspector Morse. Dennis Waterman, as Regan's partner, Sergeant George Carter, is equally talented in fisticuffs, which would come in handy in Waterman's next series, Minder, where he played bodyguard for hire, Terry McCann.

Regan often twisted the rules of the law to apprehend his criminals, usually convincing the apprehensive Carter to help. Regan was often in trouble with his superiors, and was under constant scrutiny from internal affairs. The show lasted 4 seasons, and ended with Regan actually getting ... well, I won't give it away!

Apart from the double disc set of the 2 late 70's Sweeney big screen films, which has been available on Amazon for years now, the 4 seasons of this hugely popular British show have not been available in the US until now!  It's about time!",1175212800,56,1368,4.9868421052631575
2793193,5,B000OCXNPI,"This set takes me back. I used to watch the series religiously when it originally ran in the seventies. The haircuts and bell-bottoms look a bit dated, but the dialog between Regan and Carter still crackles. The series was iconoclastic, because prior to that all British bobby shows featured very buttoned down and righteous officers of the law. There was never a suggestion that a copper would look the other way in exchange for a bung, or that sometimes suspects ""fell down the station steps"" to elicit a confession. The only problem if you're American is you'll probably need a glossary for all the Cockney rhyming slang",1391731200,3,623,4.831775700934579

If you are a John Thaw / Dennis Waterman fan, this series is the gold standard.  I'm just six years younger than Dennis Waterman, so this series is an absolute Time Machine for me!  It's 'comfort food' for the soul -- without any calories!

I also have the two Sweeney feature films.  Don't hesitate to buy them, if you get the chance.  They are both GREAT!",1389830400,,535,4.29

2793197,3,B000OCXNPI,I was delighted to find the service was once more available. However season one was not what I remembered. Perhaps it is later seasons which get that hard edge I remember. Nevertheless I enjoyed it and intend to get the rest of them.,1376092800,,233,4.441860465116279
2793198,5,B000OCXNPI,"I don't know how these shows appeared before their restoration, but they are of as high quality as I have seen, better than most of their age. (1974)  The programs are good, and the introduction by the actors appearing in some episodes are very interesting also.  If you like the type of British crime dramas that have been shown here in the last 25 years on A&E and PBS, you should like this series.  I liked it enough to order the next season.",1363219200,2,445,4.337349397590361
2793199,2,B000OCXNPI,"John Thaw is good as Regan, as is Waterman but the rest of the cast are pretty bad.  The background music/sound drowns out the dialogue and it is difficult to hear what the actors are saying.  Too bad there isn't any cc but I didn't expect that there would be and I don't think that it would have improved the series.  Lots of shouting and racing around and I am sorry that I watched the early acting of John Thaw.  I so enjoyed Morse and it is obvious how much his acting skills improved.  Really disappointed with ""The Sweeney"" and would not recommend it as it is too dated.",1331683200,3,576,4.247706422018348
2793200,5,B000OCXNPI,"Awesome to see the Sweeney available again after so long. The original tough, gritty, exciting, shocking, real to life London cop show, a true classic and WELL worth buying / watching!

2793202,5,B000OCXNPI,"Great series!!! If you're an American, like me, and got hooked on the BBC series Life on Mars and Ashes to Ashes, then you need to see this wonderful and often humourous crime drama set in London during the 1970s that was the inspiration for the developers of those two fantastic shows. The talented acting of the late John Thaw, he also played Inspector Morse in his later years, is worth giving this series five stars let alone brillant work of the rest of the outstanding cast and the wonderfully written stories.",1295308800,3,516,4.619565217391305
2793203,4,B000OCXNPI,"My wife and I loved John Thaw in the ""Morse"" series and ""Cavanaugh QC"".  We were saddened by Mr. Thaws death and wish to extend our sympathies to his family and all who enjoyed his work as much as we did.

Because of our feelings for John Thaw, we decided to try ""The Sweeney"" even though it is a 1970's vintage English TV series.  Well, to our surprise, we loved that old series also.  The appeal is the outstanding writing, great directing, and excellent acting.  The Sweeney is an interesting character study of the chief protagonist and the lead characters in every episode.  The stories are as relevant today as they were in the 70's, and the audience can become immersed in the plot, even in the Summer 2010.  The only drawback is revisiting 1970's technologies, which can sometimes give the viewer a little chuckle.  We highly recommend this series.",1282176000,7,856,4.66
2793204,5,B000OCXNPI,"This set of the first season of 'the sweeney"" is a well done set of classic cop shows.  It's high on drama and good 70's style police work. The sweeney were uncorruptible officiers of scotland yard and this show does them justice. With great acting from the whole cast.  Unfortunately we never got the rest of this series in region one. The company that put this out went out of business.  But if you buy a all region player you can get the rest of the series on dvd.  region 2 has them all and even a boxset of all 4 seasons, the pilot movie 'regan' and the two movies that were released to theaters.  Or you can buy them seperately.  I disagree that this is too seventies it's one of that decades best and yes it's not flashy like some of todays cop shows. Which I do enjoy alot but it is worth watching and enjoying the great John Thaw lay down the law in London circa 1975-79. The dvd has a great picture and this is similiar to what network dvd did with the series, They released the whole series overseas and you can go to their website or amazon.uk to get the rest of the series.  or the pilot movie 'regan'. You can still get the two movies on amazon.com though.  All region players are on sale on amazon.com as well.  Anyways this is a great cop show that is from it's era and brought british tv into the modern cop show. Before this they never put corrupt cop stories on etc.  BCI did a great job , rip bci.",1265932800,2,1417,4.157509157509158
2793205,5,B000OCXNPI,"This season one box set is a good start if you are unfamiliar with The Sweeney, the seminal british police procedural of the seventies.  I would put this series high on a list of all time greatest cop shows, irregardless of country of origin. Though notably lacking the pilot episode ""Regan"", The set has more than a few classic episodes, including ""Ringer"" and the hilarious ""Thin Ice"".  The Sweeney has a reputation of being quite violent, but most modern viewers have nothing to worry about on this score (though i sense that people that have an even mild interest .  The violence and hard charging police tactics are mild by today's television standards.  There is a seventies pre-delection for action, punch-ups and car chases.  Fans of Starsky and Hutch and Miami Vice will not be disappointed in their choice of The Sweeney, Season One for this very reason.  That said, there is a decidedly more realistic and cerebral under current at play in the Sweeney, mostly due to the excellent characterizations provide by John Thaw and Dennis Waterman. The character of Regan provides an interesting counterpoint to John Thaw's later, more famous work as Inspector Morse, the similarities being, if anything, more interesting than the differences. Thaw frequently played an alcoholic with a fanatical sense of duty and workaholic tendencies. Apparently, Thaw had these qualities in real life, so it was a fairly easy sell to produce on screen. Necessarily, the later character of Morse is a far less physical being, relying on almost entirely on brains with the brawn and pint purchasing ability provide by sergeant Lewis.  Regan, befitting a much younger man, a man raised in the tough mancunian north, kicks down his own doors, and seems to relish putting a hand on the bad guys.  Besides that, the differences are mainly structural and procedural.  Regan is the head of the flying squad, similar to a major crimes unit in the U.S.  The flying squad deals mostly with grand theft, forgery, and racketeering.  Morse is, of course, murder police through and through, and the Oxford locale of the Inspector Morse series begs for an more nuanced approach to policing.  All for now, enjoy season one on DVD, and hope that the PAL",1252108800,,2225,4.919786096256685

Wonderful acting from John Thaw - feels like you are watching Inspector Morse in his early career.  Great classic cars too. If you are an Inspector Morse fan and like British TV I don't think you will be dissapointed. Yes it's old fashioned but that's a nice change from modern TV shows and no ""politcal correctness"" I was only 4 when they made this TV series so wasn't sure I'd like it but it's great!",1208908800,3,529,4.43298969072165

Compared to NYPD Blue, and even Hill Street Blues, this is simple, slow and feels much more like TV than reality.

However, I found it to be too dated to be really interesting now and the macho atmosphere a bit juvenile.  I can imagine it was quite a sensation when it first appeared but cop shows, whether character or action driven and whether about upper crust characters or street denizens, have come a long way since then.  Also, the central character as a maverick officer/detective has also been done a lot and done better since that time.  Inspectors Morse, Frost, Lynley, and others like Vincent, DaVinci, Barnaby, the Sandbaggers,  etc. have all portrayed the smart cop who doesn't like to follow the rules and I found most of those to be better done and more engrossing than The Sweeney.",1192665600,10,779,4.7407407407407405
2793211,5,B000OCXNPI,"THE SWEENEY was one of the great TV cop series from Euston Films of the 1970s. As one reviewer noted, before John Thaw was Inspector Morse he was Jack Regan. I've got all the sets from England and hope the rest will be issued in the USA, especially with the audio-commentaries and introduction from featured actors who often say something like, ""When the Sweeney was on everybody made a point of watching in and it was an honor to appear in the show. You can't say the same about anything on British TV now (this was pre-LIFE ON MARS and NEW TRICKS). They are not exaggerating!

 Dennis Waterman, one of the NEW TRICKS team, went on to appear as Terry in the long running Euston series MINDER. It was a shame that PBS never showed these series in the USA since they were really innovative and much better than Guy Ritchie's awful ""mockney"" British gangster films. THE SWEENEY was an inspiration for LIFE ON MARS now being adapted (and obviously ruined!!!) for American TV.

 Enjoy this series which has finally reached this side of the pond and give PBS programmers ""a good kicking"" (as Regan and George Carter would say) for not transmitting it earlier.",1186963200,8,1154,4.614634146341463

A ground-breaking series by any standards, the worst episodes are good and the best episodes are television of the highest quality. Well-written, sharply directed and the main cast are perfection. Nobody ever drank alcohol like Jack Regan; there was a certain way he swallowed the drink. John Thaw was perfect for this role, a gifted actor who added something special to it. As his sidekick Dennis Waterman was dam good as well.

OK there are a few cliches that run through the series, such as Carter always getting beaten up, but these are small failings, more than compensated for by its brilliance in other areas. For the younger generation this will look old, the cars, the fashion (or lack of it) are all of the time, and unless you were around in the 70's it may be a difficult program stick with. Hopefully ""Life on Mars"" will have addressed this issue because this is a series that has a lot to say.
