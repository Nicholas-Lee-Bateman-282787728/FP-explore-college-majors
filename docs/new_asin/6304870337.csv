8180537,4,6304870337,"This DVD ""Winds of the Wasteland"" and ""Lucky Texan"" offers two great early John Wayne westerns.  Basically, if you enjoy the old 1930's B westerns you should purchase this DVD.  I am buying all of the B movies I can find so I can be certain I'll have them preserved on DVD for my grandchildren to enjoy.",1047772800,,303,4.298245614035087
