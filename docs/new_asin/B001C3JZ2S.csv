If only the subs in the last episodes had been correct and not so puzzling to either figure out or dismis, this purchase would've been the best. The actors really are great. It's a joy watching Misako (Ishihara Satomi) switch personalities or display very bad English skills or even go so crazy for money that she forgets to think twice xD The boys are sooo lovable :3 How is it possible not to see through the deceitful girls' facade? xD It's just so funny the way Yamamoto Yusuke knows that he shouldn't use his weekend on something and then changes his mind imidiately when that girl touches his hand xD Nagayama Kento and Kimura Ryo along with Yamamoto Yusuke are just brilliant at playing these prodegies who're supposed to be really smart :)",1299628800,,842,4.695945945945946
