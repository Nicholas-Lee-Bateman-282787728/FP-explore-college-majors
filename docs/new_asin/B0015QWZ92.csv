3146841,5,B0015QWZ92,"I can't begin to tell you how many times I've watched Season 1 of Mama's Family since it was released nearly two years ago. Since Amazon has listed this as an item ""waiting for a release date,"" I've been checking and checking for any new information on Season 2.

Warner Home Video, we've discussed this... We, as devout fans of this show, would rather have the syndicated versions of these episodes RATHER THAN these not being released at all. So, enough with the teasing, please release season 2 (with the rest to follow).

I agree with the other reviewers that this show only got better with time. Of course with the absence of Ellen (Betty White) and Eunice (Carol Burnett), with the exception of an episode or two, this show really found it's groove in its progression.

The wait is becoming painful for this season because I need to watch and rewatch with my friends ""Ask Thelma"" and ""Rashomama"" just as much as I've watched ""The Wedding Parts 1 and 2"" and ""Positive Thinking.""

Please release season two. Good Lord, it could use some fresh air on the store shelf.

Now, I'll stop my bickering before the neighbors start lovin this...",1219622400,9,1140,4.651741293532338
3146842,5,B0015QWZ92,"Mama's Family debuted the same year I did. I only watched the show through syndicated reruns but I am a staunch Thelma Harper fan FOR LIFE.

Mama, aka Thelma Harper, is the only member of the family who has a lick of sense. Her hopelessly dimwitted son Vint, who has the personality of a doorknob, and his ditzy, cheaply dressed wife Naomi provide Mama with lots of aggravation and are usually the targets for one of her hilariously acid-laced temper explosions. Grandson Bubba, supposedly a teenager (although the actor looks 30 if he's a day), and neighbor Iola Boyland are less essential to the overall framework of the show but still serve to irritate Mama, even though she loves them. Other characters include daughter Ellen, aunt Fran, and the only character EVER to be funnier than Mama, Carol Burnett's EUNICE, a microcosm of Mama herself.

A typical episode involves the supporting characters screwing up in some way or causing Mama a problem, leading up to one big insult-filled tirade by Mama. Her reprimands are always deserved and always hilarious, because Mama tells the truth like she sees it. She says what everyone watching the show is thinking.

For the rabid fans like myself: 1. The characters wear the same colors in every show. Mama- blue or purple, Vint- white and khaki, Naomi- yellow, Bubba- green, and Iola- pink.
2. In nearly every episode, Mama utters the tagline, ""Uh OH!""

Get some more seasons on DVD already!!",1216684800,19,1441,4.845528455284553
3146843,5,B0015QWZ92,"Some fans may have been disappointed with the syndicated release of Mama's Family Season 1, but others loved it otherwise.  Fans of the series have started an online petition to support the release of season two.  Every fan will be happy and be able to support edited masters (syndicated version) on DVD.  Despite not owning the original masters, fans of the show will be happy to have Seasons 2 and the other 4 seasons on DVD.  Please release the 5 remaining seasons of Mama's Family on DVD!",1215129600,6,492,4.620689655172414
3146844,5,B0015QWZ92,"I have been waiting forever for the second season of Mama's Family which includes 22 episodes from the network NBC who unwisedly canceled it in favor of programming to attract a different audience.

Mama's Family was the first sitcom that was all about family, dysfunctional. The Harpers were the first television family that I recalled that they yelled at each other and they were not perfect. Mama Thelma Crowley Harper comes more alive in this season as she campaigns and wins a mayoral campaign against her daughter Ellen's boyfriend and former Mayor, Alvin Tutwiler. Mama, Vint, and Naomi attend Ellen's woman of the year banquet unknown to her at the country club where Mama asks for a beer in a can.

In this season, there was a less of Eunice and Ed Higgins but this was the season that the show came alive and could have stayed. Sadly, the network canceled the show despite the ratings. It resurfaced in syndication with cast changes including the introduction of Iola Boyland, an arts and crafts neighbor who cares for a shut-in mother, played brilliantly by Beverly Archer. She is Thelma's best friend.

The show lost Rue McClanahan who played Aunt Frances Crowley. To tell you the truth, I didn't care about Golden Girls as much as I did Mama's Family. The show also lost Betty White who played Ellen Harper Jackson, the snobby daughter, as well probably because of scheduling conflicts. Ellen is so anti-Rose that you can compare and contrast the two characters.

The teenagers, Sonia and Buzz, were written out in order for Thelma to deal with Ed and Eunice's son, Bubba. Ed and Eunice had 2 sons but we never heard about the other. Ed and Eunice move to Florida when the show entered syndication in 1986 after the Golden Girls stole Betty White and Rue McClanahan away.

Even though, this show was an ensemble cast. I love Aunt Effie played by writer and actress, Dorothy Van and her husband Jim Evering. I have to say that I was glad to see the show resurface in syndication despite the obvious changes. Producer Joe Hamilton and his then wife Carol Burnett divorced. Hamilton received the show. Regardless, Mama's Family fans are out there and we come from all walks of life.",1211241600,45,2192,4.742782152230971
3146845,5,B0015QWZ92,"I agree with your other reviewer that Mama's Family never goes stale. Mama's Family, in my opinion, is one of those series that never quits giving laughs and entertainment. It is my number one favorite TV Series, and I have come to love the characters as though they were part of my own family. I have already purchased Mama's Family Season One, from Amazon, and can hardly wait until Season 2, and all of the Series are put on dvds, so I will always be able to watch Mama's Family, not only now, but in the future, when the reruns may not be shown anymore.

3146857,5,B0015QWZ92,"I think it's safe to say that this is never happening. It's unfortunate that some people had to make such a big deal out of the first season being the syndicated cuts. This is the result. You might be a huge Mama's family fan, like myself, but lets face it... ""Mama's Family"" isn't making WB much money these days. In the last few years, it hasn't even made the lineup on the most obscure TV channels, offically ending its nearly non-stop, 25 year run of repeats. I doubt WB's profits on the first season's DVD release were overwhelming. Then, the overly agressive outcry only made things worse. WB famously responded with a somewhat condescending letter about their syndicated episodes not being ""good enough"" for the rabid fans (who at the time were encouraging others not to buy the DVDs. Their reviews are still posted). I do have to say that i believe WB severely underestimates this shows popularity, regardless. ""Mamas Family"" is my all time favorite sitcom and all ways will be. I've literally grown up watching it for 20 years. It's a silly show that has a very special, very nostalgic place in my heart.
  It's too bad only one season will be released, despite numerous requests and petitions over the last 6+ years. What ever happened with those petitions? The second season is definitely one of, if not THE best of the show's run. We love them all of course, right? There are several online sellers that offer bootlegged versions of the show, but the picture and audio quality aren't the best. Perhaps, someday, WB will sell the rights and we will finally see ""Mama's Family"" In the official package it deserves. After all, Vicki Lawrence STILL tours the country as Mama to sold out crowds. i think by now it must be close to becoming one of the only sitcoms NOT complete on DVD ( soon to be a dying format itself). If even Betty White's huge popularity cant ressurect this on DVD after all these years, Im afraid it doesnt look good. I'd also like to add that perhaps Amazon's streaming service could get their hands on it? I'd be happy to purchase the seasons digitally, if nothing else.",1354060800,4,2101,4.630026809651475

3146859,5,B0015QWZ92,I would like to have the entire series of Mama's Family.  It is one of the best shows ever.  I especially like the ones with Bubba in them.  I also like Eunice and Ellen.  I did not care for Vint's kids.  I thought they were just whinny and boring.  I would like the whole series boxed together.  It needs to be offered.  I know alot of people that would buy it.,1352419200,4,362,4.0
3146860,5,B0015QWZ92,"It has been nearly 6 years since WB released Season One of ""Mama's Family"" on DVD, and they basically shot themselves in the foot with that release by including CUT episodes. When the series debuted in early 1983, those first-season airings contained pompous spoken introductions by ""your host"" Alistair Quince (Harvey Korman parodying 'Masterpiece Theatre' on PBS). These intros were not included on the DVDs and fans cried foul and this likely hurt potential sales. WB probably figured ""Fine...if you want to bellyache...that will be the end of Mama on DVD"".

This was one of THE most successful sitcoms in first-run syndication that enjoyed renewed popularity for another decade after it was picked up by TBS in 1997, so the market and loyal fanbase IS there.

The problem likely lies in Music Rights Hell. The second-season opener ""The Flaming Forties"" (one of my favorites of the entire series) contains a performance of Mama, Naomi and Aunt Fran lip-synching to the Andrews Sisters' ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"". It's one of the most entertaining and uplifting moments in ""Mama's Family"" history and is sadly not going to make it to DVD officially. Too bad, because some of the series' best episodes appear this season, ""Rashomama"" (the gooseberry-jam show with Carol Burnett as Eunice); ""Black Belt Mama"", ""Supermarket"" and ""Mama Learns to Drive"".

The first two seasons had more of a theatre ambience than the syndicated ones, plus Rue McClanahan, Betty White and Carol Burnett. It was still great, although more cartoonish in the later years. Mama was more believable here as a crabby sourpuss, than as a hip senior shaking her booty to ""Proud Mary"" while carrying in her groceries, etc.

I would LOVE Warner Archive to release this, along with ""It's a Living"" and ""Alice"", but sadly it's the music rights issues that will likely make it impossible.",1333238400,6,1855,5.03257328990228

Hopefully, TimeLife.com will make these sets available through Amazon.com, as Amazon has millions more buyers than TimeLife.com, I would think.

They were able to get 12 episodes per disc, keep in mind these were single sided 4.7 gb dvds. Therefore, needless to say I would definatley buy if they commercially released all the seasons to dvd.

3146882,3,B0015QWZ92,"Just like in today's music industry, Warner Brothers only cares about what young consumers have to say.  This is why they continue to release dumb teenybopper shows and reality shows onto DVD. People my age, who were around in the 80s, Warner Brother does not care about us.  We have been begging them for 3 years, signing petitions, sending emails, writing on every messageboard for them to please release the other Seasons of Mama's Family, whether they are syndicated or not.  However, Warner Brother continues to ignore and turn their back on the public.  If people don't want to buy the sydicated shows, then fine because there are just as many people who would be happy to have the sydicated versions.  Warner Brother is missing out on a l ot of money to be made and, in the meantime, making some very ardent supportors of both their company and products, very angry and I'm sick of it!!!  Until they give US what WE want, I will no longer purchase any Warner Brother product or any other company affilated with them.

UPDATE:  JANUARY 2014 -  Well, it only took 8 years but we finally got the Complete Series on DVD!!!  I paid under $200 for the set on the studio's site.  I think they really took advantage because they knew fans have been waiting for so many years to get this and a lot of us were so happy, we were willing to pay just about anything.  I love FINALLY having the complete series released but, along with the outrageous price, my biggest complaint is, for that kind of money, you would think they would have given a complete detailed episode guide for for each season.  Seasons 1 and 2 have them but Seasons 3-6 only have the title of each episode, no details so you really don't know what each episode is about.  I had to print out my own episode guide off of the net.

Because they finally released the series, I'm updating my original 1-star rating to 3-stars.  3 stars because of the price and not giving enough episode details.  I'm not changing the title of my review because I still think Warner does not care about us.

Warner Home Video, we've discussed this... We, as devout fans of this show, would rather have the syndicated versions of these episodes RATHER THAN these not being released at all. So, enough with the teasing, please release season 2 (with the rest to follow).

I agree with the other reviewers that this show only got better with time. Of course with the absence of Ellen (Betty White) and Eunice (Carol Burnett), with the exception of an episode or two, this show really found it's groove in its progression.

The wait is becoming painful for this season because I need to watch and rewatch with my friends ""Ask Thelma"" and ""Rashomama"" just as much as I've watched ""The Wedding Parts 1 and 2"" and ""Positive Thinking.""

3381339,5,B0015QWZ92,"Mama's Family debuted the same year I did. I only watched the show through syndicated reruns but I am a staunch Thelma Harper fan FOR LIFE.

Mama, aka Thelma Harper, is the only member of the family who has a lick of sense. Her hopelessly dimwitted son Vint, who has the personality of a doorknob, and his ditzy, cheaply dressed wife Naomi provide Mama with lots of aggravation and are usually the targets for one of her hilariously acid-laced temper explosions. Grandson Bubba, supposedly a teenager (although the actor looks 30 if he's a day), and neighbor Iola Boyland are less essential to the overall framework of the show but still serve to irritate Mama, even though she loves them. Other characters include daughter Ellen, aunt Fran, and the only character EVER to be funnier than Mama, Carol Burnett's EUNICE, a microcosm of Mama herself.

A typical episode involves the supporting characters screwing up in some way or causing Mama a problem, leading up to one big insult-filled tirade by Mama. Her reprimands are always deserved and always hilarious, because Mama tells the truth like she sees it. She says what everyone watching the show is thinking.

For the rabid fans like myself: 1. The characters wear the same colors in every show. Mama- blue or purple, Vint- white and khaki, Naomi- yellow, Bubba- green, and Iola- pink.
2. In nearly every episode, Mama utters the tagline, ""Uh OH!""

3381341,5,B0015QWZ92,"I have been waiting forever for the second season of Mama's Family which includes 22 episodes from the network NBC who unwisedly canceled it in favor of programming to attract a different audience.

Mama's Family was the first sitcom that was all about family, dysfunctional. The Harpers were the first television family that I recalled that they yelled at each other and they were not perfect. Mama Thelma Crowley Harper comes more alive in this season as she campaigns and wins a mayoral campaign against her daughter Ellen's boyfriend and former Mayor, Alvin Tutwiler. Mama, Vint, and Naomi attend Ellen's woman of the year banquet unknown to her at the country club where Mama asks for a beer in a can.

In this season, there was a less of Eunice and Ed Higgins but this was the season that the show came alive and could have stayed. Sadly, the network canceled the show despite the ratings. It resurfaced in syndication with cast changes including the introduction of Iola Boyland, an arts and crafts neighbor who cares for a shut-in mother, played brilliantly by Beverly Archer. She is Thelma's best friend.

The show lost Rue McClanahan who played Aunt Frances Crowley. To tell you the truth, I didn't care about Golden Girls as much as I did Mama's Family. The show also lost Betty White who played Ellen Harper Jackson, the snobby daughter, as well probably because of scheduling conflicts. Ellen is so anti-Rose that you can compare and contrast the two characters.

The teenagers, Sonia and Buzz, were written out in order for Thelma to deal with Ed and Eunice's son, Bubba. Ed and Eunice had 2 sons but we never heard about the other. Ed and Eunice move to Florida when the show entered syndication in 1986 after the Golden Girls stole Betty White and Rue McClanahan away.

Even though, this show was an ensemble cast. I love Aunt Effie played by writer and actress, Dorothy Van and her husband Jim Evering. I have to say that I was glad to see the show resurface in syndication despite the obvious changes. Producer Joe Hamilton and his then wife Carol Burnett divorced. Hamilton received the show.

3381354,5,B0015QWZ92,"I think it's safe to say that this is never happening. It's unfortunate that some people had to make such a big deal out of the first season being the syndicated cuts. This is the result. You might be a huge Mama's family fan, like myself, but lets face it... ""Mama's Family"" isn't making WB much money these days. In the last few years, it hasn't even made the lineup on the most obscure TV channels, offically ending its nearly non-stop, 25 year run of repeats. I doubt WB's profits on the first season's DVD release were overwhelming. Then, the overly agressive outcry only made things worse. WB famously responded with a somewhat condescending letter about their syndicated episodes not being ""good enough"" for the rabid fans (who at the time were encouraging others not to buy the DVDs. Their reviews are still posted). I do have to say that i believe WB severely underestimates this shows popularity, regardless. ""Mamas Family"" is my all time favorite sitcom and all ways will be. I've literally grown up watching it for 20 years. It's a silly show that has a very special, very nostalgic place in my heart.
  It's too bad only one season will be released, despite numerous requests and petitions over the last 6+ years. What ever happened with those petitions? The second season is definitely one of, if not THE best of the show's run. We love them all of course, right? There are several online sellers that offer bootlegged versions of the show, but the picture and audio quality aren't the best. Perhaps, someday, WB will sell the rights and we will finally see ""Mama's Family"" In the official package it deserves. After all, Vicki Lawrence STILL tours the country as Mama to sold out crowds. i think by now it must be close to becoming one of the only sitcoms NOT complete on DVD ( soon to be a dying format itself). If even Betty White's huge popularity cant ressurect this on DVD after all these years, Im afraid it doesnt look good. I'd also like to add that perhaps Amazon's streaming service could get their hands on it? I'd be happy to purchase the seasons digitally, if nothing else.",1354060800,4,2101,4.630026809651475

3381356,5,B0015QWZ92,I would like to have the entire series of Mama's Family.  It is one of the best shows ever.  I especially like the ones with Bubba in them.  I also like Eunice and Ellen.  I did not care for Vint's kids.  I thought they were just whinny and boring.  I would like the whole series boxed together.  It needs to be offered.  I know alot of people that would buy it.,1352419200,4,362,4.0
3381357,5,B0015QWZ92,"It has been nearly 6 years since WB released Season One of ""Mama's Family"" on DVD, and they basically shot themselves in the foot with that release by including CUT episodes. When the series debuted in early 1983, those first-season airings contained pompous spoken introductions by ""your host"" Alistair Quince (Harvey Korman parodying 'Masterpiece Theatre' on PBS). These intros were not included on the DVDs and fans cried foul and this likely hurt potential sales. WB probably figured ""Fine...if you want to bellyache...that will be the end of Mama on DVD"".

This was one of THE most successful sitcoms in first-run syndication that enjoyed renewed popularity for another decade after it was picked up by TBS in 1997, so the market and loyal fanbase IS there.

The problem likely lies in Music Rights Hell. The second-season opener ""The Flaming Forties"" (one of my favorites of the entire series) contains a performance of Mama, Naomi and Aunt Fran lip-synching to the Andrews Sisters' ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"". It's one of the most entertaining and uplifting moments in ""Mama's Family"" history and is sadly not going to make it to DVD officially. Too bad, because some of the series' best episodes appear this season, ""Rashomama"" (the gooseberry-jam show with Carol Burnett as Eunice); ""Black Belt Mama"", ""Supermarket"" and ""Mama Learns to Drive"".

The first two seasons had more of a theatre ambience than the syndicated ones, plus Rue McClanahan, Betty White and Carol Burnett. It was still great, although more cartoonish in the later years. Mama was more believable here as a crabby sourpuss, than as a hip senior shaking her booty to ""Proud Mary"" while carrying in her groceries, etc.

I would LOVE Warner Archive to release this, along with ""It's a Living"" and ""Alice"", but sadly it's the music rights issues that will likely make it impossible.",1333238400,6,1855,5.03257328990228

Whether its the hilarity of the characters, or simply because if you're from the South like myself, you can sure relate to it all. I know plenty of Thelma Harpers in my neck of the woods, Y'all! Mama's Family has 2 versions- and I enjoy them both equally. You get a slightly different feel with the NBC cast, then you do with the later ones that include Bubba and Iola- but each is great in its own way. I really really really wish they would release more Seasons of Mama's Family on DVD. Warner Bros, owes it to us fans- and there are many of us! Mama's Family has a loyal and dedicated following- for all of us who enjoy it for its great campy quality and endearing characters.",1292112000,3,747,4.267605633802817

Instead of releasing the remaining seasons of a quality sitcom like ""Mama's Family"", Warner Brothers contnues to release other shows on DVD that no one even cares about.

3381379,3,B0015QWZ92,"Just like in today's music industry, Warner Brothers only cares about what young consumers have to say.  This is why they continue to release dumb teenybopper shows and reality shows onto DVD. People my age, who were around in the 80s, Warner Brother does not care about us.  We have been begging them for 3 years, signing petitions, sending emails, writing on every messageboard for them to please release the other Seasons of Mama's Family, whether they are syndicated or not.  However, Warner Brother continues to ignore and turn their back on the public.  If people don't want to buy the sydicated shows, then fine because there are just as many people who would be happy to have the sydicated versions.  Warner Brother is missing out on a l ot of money to be made and, in the meantime, making some very ardent supportors of both their company and products, very angry and I'm sick of it!!!  Until they give US what WE want, I will no longer purchase any Warner Brother product or any other company affilated with them.

UPDATE:  JANUARY 2014 -  Well, it only took 8 years but we finally got the Complete Series on DVD!!!  I paid under $200 for the set on the studio's site.  I think they really took advantage because they knew fans have been waiting for so many years to get this and a lot of us were so happy, we were willing to pay just about anything.  I love FINALLY having the complete series released but, along with the outrageous price, my biggest complaint is, for that kind of money, you would think they would have given a complete detailed episode guide for for each season.  Seasons 1 and 2 have them but Seasons 3-6 only have the title of each episode, no details so you really don't know what each episode is about.  I had to print out my own episode guide off of the net.

Because they finally released the series, I'm updating my original 1-star rating to 3-stars.  3 stars because of the price and not giving enough episode details.  I'm not changing the title of my review because I still think Warner does not care about us.  They only care about taking advantage by charging outrageous prices for the set.",1250899200,34,2132,4.522193211488251

If your here, then you don't need me to tell you that or anything else about the show because I'm sure you already know!  But just in case, the first 2 seasons were some what slow compared to the rest of the series once it was syndicated.  But don't get me wrong, one of the best episodes was Rashomama and I loved the Wedding episodes.  Infact, ok never mind the first two seasons were just as good as the rest of the series.

Maybe thats part of the problem, seasons 1 & 2 were produced and airred on the NBC network, while the remaning four seasons were syndicated and had to be bought by mulitple networks.

8259481,5,B0015QWZ92,"Based on the immensely popular Family sketches on The Carol Burnett Show, Mama's Family follows the life of the dysfunctional Harper family of Raytown. Those who have viewed both The Family skits and Mama's Family will definitely notice the differences between the two. The Family sketches focused on the dysfunctional life of Thelma ""Mama"" Harper (Vicki Lawrence) and mostly her ungrateful daughter Eunice Harper Higgins (Carol Burnett) and her naive husband Ed (Harvey Korman). Other characters appearing the skits were Mama's other children Ellen Jackson (Betty White) and Jack and Phillip Harper, both played by various actors. By the time Mama's Family came along, Mama's sons were meshed into a new, previously unmentioned son, Vinton (Ken Berry). Others characters were added to the mix to round out the cast for the forthcoming series.

Vicki Lawrence, Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman, and Ken Berry starred as Mama, Eunice, Ed, and Phillip, respectively, in the CBS made-for-TV movie, Eunice. It first aired on March 15, 1982 to positive reviews and achieved a high rating share. Carol Burnett and her then-husband, producer Joe Hamilton, convinced Vicki Lawrence into agreeing to play Mama in a television sitcom. The rights to the story and its characters were sold to NBC, who agreed to film a 13-episode season, beginning on January 22, 1983. In the first episode of the series, Vinton Harper (Ken Berry) is has been divorced for a year and has just been evicted from his home. He convinces his Mama (Vicki Lawrence) to allow him as well as his two teen-aged children, Vinton, Jr., known as Buzz (Eric Brown) and Sonja (Karin Argoud), to move in with her on what was to be a ""temporary"" basis. Mama's younger, spinster sister Fran Crowley (Rue McClanahan) was initially against their moving in, but eventually relents. Ellen Jackson (Betty White) and even Eunice (Carol Burnett) and Ed Higgins (Harvey Korman) make frequent appearances.

In the series' first episode, Vinton reunites with his high school crush, Naomi Oates (Dorothy Lyman), who lives next door to Mama and begins a romantic relationship with her and the love birds soon marry. Mama's Family was not overly well-received during its run on NBC, receiving lower-than-imagined ratings and mixed reviews. NBC failed to believe that Mama's Family would eventually garner the ratings with the younger viewers the network sought, so it was canceled in 1984 after 35 episodes.

Reruns continued to air sporadically over the next two years, garnering the ratings NBC sought, urging producer Joe Hamilton to collaborate with Lorimar-Telepictures to bring Mama's Family back in first-run syndication in 1986. Carol Burnett, now divorced from Hamilton, decided not to return, as did Harvey Korman. Both Betty White and Rue McClanahan had began starring together as Rose Nylund and Blanche Devereaux, respectively, on NBC's newest fire hit, The Golden Girls, rendering them unavailable to return. Although Betty White made a brief return as Ellen in a 1986 episode, Rue McClanahan's Aunt Fran was killed off early in season three; over time, the two characters were never mentioned again. For unknown reasons, the characters of Buzz of Sonja were also dropped, and were never mentioned again.

To fill the void left by the multiple cast exits, Allan Kayser was brought in as Bubba Higgins, the previously mentioned but unseen delinquent son of Eunice and Ed, who, in the syndicated years, have relocated to Florida. He moved in with Mama, Vinton, and Naomi after being released from Juvenile Hall early due to ""good behavior"". Bubba wished to join his parents in Florida, but since he was on probation and a minor, he could not leave the state for one year, thus forcing him to move in with Mama and the others. Also added to the cast was Beverly Archer as Iola Boylan, the family's prissy neighbor and Mama's best friend. The Boylan family was mentioned briefly during the NBC episodes, but were never mentioned by name and were never seen on camera.

The syndicated years of Mama's Family is when the series switched tones. The scripts are given a lighter, sillier tone; Vinton and Naomi become more dimwitted; Mama becomes more of a hero and the leader of the family; Bubba provides the perfect dose of teen-age naive-ness and hilarity; and Iola meshes in as an extended member of the family who has her eyes on Vinton. Mama's Family grew in popularity during its syndicated years, becoming the highest-rated sitcom in syndication, besting even the popular Charles in Charge starring teen heartthrob Scott Baio.

Overall, Mama's Family is a very good show. The syndicated seasons (Seasons 3-6) are generally more popular with fans and rightly so. Although the network seasons (Seasons 1 and 2) are of high quality, they focus a lot on bickering with a lot of hollering and screaming between the characters, which some find boring. I personally enjoyed the first two seasons. Regular appearances by Rue McClanahan and Betty White, along with the guest appearances by Carol Burnett and Harvey Korman, give it a fun and great feel. The characters of Buzz and Sonja, I believe, were miscalculated and did not catch on with audiences. I was not sad to see them haven disappeared in Season 3, but I missed the others. At least Rue and Betty went on to the great Golden Girls, which ran for seven hilarious, highly rated, and critically acclaimed seasons.

Mama's Family is a great dose of Southern-fried comedy. I remember watching reruns with my Mama and Daddy when I was young, but my image of the series was blurred. I remembered Rue McClanahan being on it, but from my adolescent point-of-view, I thought Aunt Fran, Bubba, and Iola were on the same episodes, but this is not the case. Whatever the case, this is a great series that has not failed me yet. My six-year-old has fallen in love with it, she watches it every time I popped it in the DVD player. This old-fashioned, but well-to-do sitcom is great entertainment and will not disappoint.",1406505600,,6009,5.003
