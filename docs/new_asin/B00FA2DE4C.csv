8613594,3,B00FA2DE4C,"This is a five star film along with five star packaging. Unfortunately, the well-worn two star print does indeed weaken the viewing enjoyment. To be fair, the ALPHA version is watchable and I know of no other version readily available, except for one offered by SINISTER CINEMA which may be sourced from the same print because I understand that it too leaves a lot to be desired. ALPHA's website offers many tempting silent film purchases: LIVINGSTON, ROBINSON CRUSOE, ELLA CINDERS and several Mary Pickford and Sennett comedy shorts. So it's hard for me to condemn ALPHA for their poor prints when they're the only company out there even releasing such stuff in mass quantities. Many of their titles (especially the silent Westerns) I never knew even existed...Still, even though this film version of SHE is the closest to Haggard's novel, be warned of possible eye strain, poor print quality and that the product is recorded on dvd-r material. I'll keep my copy (certainly bargain priced) until a better version shows up...someday.

...as for someday showing up, can anyone out there answer a few questions?
1) Can these poor ALPHA prints ever be restored or offered in better condition by anyone else? I'm assuming 35mm nitrate prints do not exist for ALPHA's versions of SHE, CRIME AND PUNISHMENT or both versions of STUDENT OF PRAGUE. Are these the best versions we'll ever see, or can KINO or CRITERION do something here?

2) Will the Laurel and Hardy silent shorts ever see the light of day on dvd in this country? I have many on vhs and they're great looking, but would really like to have them all, as complete as possible on dvd.

3) That goes the same for Kevin Brownlow's BUSTER KEATON, A HARD ACT TO FOLLOW as well as HAROLD LLOYD, THE THIRD GENIUS and Brownlow's excellent series on silent Hollywood which played on PBS in the 1980s.

4) Ditto for Von Stroheim's GREED and THE WEDDING MARCH. I know great prints exist. When will Gance's NAPOLEON ever see release on dvd, THE EAGLE (with Carl Davis' wonderful score), THE WIND starring Lillian Gish or even Griffith's JUDITH OF BETHULIA? KINO put out a nice version of JUDITH on vhs years ago.

5) TURNER gave us a Mack Sennett festival a while back with good looking prints of dozens of comedy shorts. Any future dvd release for these planned?

These are just a few questions that have puzzled me, because I've seen these mentioned films or programs at one time in restored splendor but they don't seem to be headed for dvd release anytime soon. Legal problems? Not enough interest?
...If there's no hope for great looking prints to ever be released then what chance does a film like SHE ever have of being restored? Which makes it important to purchase poor prints of films like SHE just to be able to see them before they become deleted and are never available again. That just seems to be too sad a situation to be true.",1386115200,7,2887,4.695652173913044
8613595,2,B00FA2DE4C,"It's a shame that Alpha Video's version of the 1925 silent epic ""She"" is so disappointing when it comes to trying to view it. Silent screen legend Betty Blythe plays Ayesha (""She Who Must Be Obeyed""), a queen hidden away in her mountain kingdom deep in the jungles of Africa.  According to legend, ""She"" can live forever, but even ""She"" cannot live without love.

The Alpha version has a nicely designed DVD case and the notes on the back are also well written, but the film itself, at best,  is visually poor to average. For the most part, the film is very washed out and the focus is fuzzy, almost to the point of being blurry in places. Characters' faces are bleached white to the point of not being able to see any of their features. The soundtrack music, however, is okay and works reasonably well with the film.

Also, all the big hoopla about Miss Blythe's sexy portrayal of Queen Ayesha is totally lost due to the fact that the picture is so washed out that oftentimes it's hard to see her and what she is wearing, or not wearing. I'm no expert, but this print appears to have been duped from an old, well-worn videotape.

Having said all this, ""She"" is still watchable, but the enjoyment level is greatly diminished due to the film's dismal picture quality. If any readers of this review know of a better DVD version of 1925's ""She,"" please come forward.",1384819200,10,1363,4.502024291497976
8613596,4,B00FA2DE4C,"H. Rider Haggard's She is one of my favorite novels; I reread it this year.  Recently, I came across this film in a catalog and decided to see how well it stands up to the book. I'd already seen the 1935 film with Helen Gahagan and did not care much for it and I've yet to see the version with Ursula Andress. I have my doubts that any film could ever do full justice to the visions Haggard presented of Ayesha, She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed, a woman possessed of both fantastic power and beauty.  She is one of fiction's most stunning characters.  Still, this silent film proves to be a reasonably faithful adaptation (it was interesting to learn that in 1925, this was already the seventh film version of She).  The film is only about an hour, so the filmmakers seemed to focus on the story's high points.  Horace Holly and his ward Leo Vincey are exploring Africa trying to verify a legend that Leo's ancestors had an encounter with an immortal woman of great power.  After capture by a primitive tribe, they learn the legend is quite true.  Even more, Ayesha, who lords over the tribe, is convinced Leo is not just the descendent but the actual reincarnation of the man who spurned her centuries ago and she has a new chance to win his love. By today's standards, the sets and special effects might look a tad clunky, but judged by their times, they are quite good.  Betty Blythe plays Ayesha and her interpretation is a strong effort.  As noted above, I doubt the character can ever be fully captured, but Blythe does give us a good idea of Ayesha's ruthlessness, sexiness and vulnerability.  A scene at the climax shows her in nothing but strategically placed long hair; I imagine 1925 audiences found this most daring, but it is faithful to the scene in the book.  Likewise, Carlyle Blackwell and Henry George do resemble Haggard's descriptions of Leo Vincey and Horace Holly, respectively.  While definitely a condensed version, fans of the original story will find this film has captured a fair bit of the book's magic.",1382140800,10,2021,4.661971830985915
