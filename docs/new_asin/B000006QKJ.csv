Some people may agree with the whole ""the devil made me do it, but now I'm Christian so it's ok"" thing, whereas some people may think he's a total nutbar and Satan and God have nothing to do with it.  I'm bordering on two opinions right now.  My first reaction was this may be the work of black magic by a satanic cult and that he was seduced by evil spirits, not Satan.  In my religion that's what would make sense, I don't believe in the devil.  I believe in evil.  The other opinion I could believe is that this didn't have to do with the devil or God.  It's very possible that this man is just insane.  I'm sick of hearing that just because someone becomes a born again Christian everyone all of the sudden thinks their saved.  To me, that is just an easy out.  I've ran into plenty of Christians that in reality, are not so Christian.  This is a good biography though and worth the buy.  But I hope anyone who buys it keeps their mind open to possibilities, no matter what your faith is.  Just my opinion, I'm sure plenty of people will be outraged by it, but tough noogies, welcome to America, freedom of speech, freedom of religion (supposedly).",1187740800,4,1220,4.298245614035087

7904925,4,B000006QKJ,"This video about David Berkowitz, formerly known as the Son of Sam,now  known as the Son of Hope, is a good documentary of what happened during the  time of his killing spree. It recreates alot of the tension of the time  when David was on his rampage. It shows that it was more than just a man  doing these killings. Through the words of David himself, he shows that the  killings were the work of Satan, using David as a willing pawn to do his  evil deeds. Though being duped, David has acknowledged his guilt and is  very sorry for his past. He, and especially the victims families all suffer  continually with the memories of what took place. As David explains, it was  the work of an organized Satanic cult to cause chaos in the streets of New  York and they were very successful in doing that. He goes on to explain  that there are many such satanic cults operating today in America and  throughout the world to bring about mayhem, destruction, murder and  anarchy. He says they are very real and explains that they only way he  himself has escaped this cult was to become a born again Christian. He  speaks a bit on his faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and how he truly  believes that even he has been forgiven by God. He has entrusted his life  to Christ Jesus and you can certainly see the difference in him! His official website can be found at  [...] A good video and worth the  investment!",960768000,4,1399,4.373540856031128
