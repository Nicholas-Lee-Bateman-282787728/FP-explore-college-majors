8030024,4,B0002OXUQA,"Just got this DVD today and I'm very impressed. He shows how to use the brush and apply the paint. I have only practiced a few things but I have become motivated after watching his video. I would recommend it to anyone who has absolutely no talent, such as myself.",1509148800,2,264,4.3
8030025,3,B0002OXUQA,"Frank Clarke is the encouraging amateur -- an Irish charmer. I had hoped, however, for an INTRODUCTION to acrylic paints and their use. This meant their characteristics, color mixing, brush choice, drying capacities, mediums, etc. Unfortunately, one has to wade through a lot of cheesy ""instruction"" on doing bone-headed skies, rivers, people, etc. Clarke also moves at a rather slow pace, though he maintains a nice demeanor.

This is a video for the hobbyist ""pitcher maker"" poised to venture into Michael's or Aaron Brothers to get some supplies and try their hand at ""art."" It is not an instruction in acrylics as an artistic medium of expression.",1423612800,3,651,5.08411214953271
8030026,5,B0002OXUQA,Perfect intro to anyone interested in trying their had at painting but having trouble knowing where to start.  Subsequent episodes of Simply painting taper off in usefulness.,1415923200,5,174,5.444444444444445
