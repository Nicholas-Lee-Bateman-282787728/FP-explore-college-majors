The Phantom of the Opera songs were great, the special effects were great, perhaps the whole concert was great. Especially the duet with that sexy  Andrea Bocelli guy whom I was totally ""foaming at the mouth"" for.  My suggestion: Get it as soon as possible!",943747200,8,332,4.610169491525424
945087,3,6304916531,"Wonderful, talented, beautiful, loving Sarah Brightman deserves better than this video has to offer. While the music and Sarah are overwhelming in beauty, the POOR QUALITY OF THE VIDEO REPRODUCTION is unforgivable. All  through the concert the static sounds diminish greatly the enjoyment of  music. The static distracts and ruins the moment. During all events of  applause the skips in sound are horrible. It sounds as if the microphone  was being turned off and on all during applause. It prevents one from even  enjoying the applause given to the artists. In the last song with Andrea  Bocelli the skips in sound and static was at its worst. I regret paying the  price for this video. I respect Sarah far too much to allow this junky  video on the market. Edsol Crowder",943228800,16,772,4.8396946564885495
945088,3,6304916531,"Don't get me wrong, I very much enjoy Sarah Brightman and her beautiful voice and I have been a fan for almost 5 years now. If you close your eyes, this video can be a real treat! What I'm trying to say is, she's not quite  easy on the eyes. Some find it enchanting or charming when she gets that  wide-eyed, tranced look while she's singing but it's a tad too dramatic for  me whether it's natural or not. She is in great voice here though and this  video contains many of her selections from her CD ""Timeless"", or  ""Time to Say  Goodbye"", which established her name in the United  States. In a nutshell, this video has beautiful music and a beautiful voice  with not quite so beautiful visuals, but it's still a treat for many fans.",938563200,7,734,4.306569343065694
945089,5,6304916531,When you watch this video you get the impression that Sarah goes into a bit of a trance before singing and what comes out is so unimaginably beautiful that you would think the Holy Spirit had litterally taken over  her mind and body to produce what may very well be the most beautiful music  you will ever have the pleasure of listening to.,938304000,4,340,4.380952380952381

In person (PBS fund drives) she  is just perfection.  I've been a fan since hearing her in PHANTOM.  Her ex  Andrew L Webber was correct selecting her as Christine.

Her duet with Andrea Bocelli, ""Time to Say Goodbye"" is worth the price of the DVD.  I liked the guest appearance of Andrew Lloyd Weber who acknowledged that her voice was wonderful that night.  Sarah sat on the piano and sang while Andrew played one of his new and quite beautiful new show tunes.

The concert was excellent. It was held in London back in 1997. Needless to say, Sarah (that's what she wants me to call her, by the way) was absolutely wonderful. Her voice has always been so beautiful; and as beautiful as she looks at this concert, too. Her list of songs were mainly from her time with Andrew Lloyd Webber: songs like Don't Cry For Me, Argentina; The Music of the Night; and Pie Jesu. Mr. Webber himself makes a visit as does tenor Andrea Bocelli. I believe this is a concert that you will enjoy very much.",1390694400,,760,4.212328767123288

945344,5,6304916531,"This 1997 concert, featuring a rare appearance together of Sarah Brightman and Andrea Bocelli, ushered in a new era of great music. You could call it popularized classical music, but there is just as much classicized popular music here. Simon Cowell was so excited about it that he created Il Divo in this image. And now Paul Potts and Alessandro Safina and others are adopting similar styles. Make no mistake: The creative Brightman, even more than superb Bocelli, invented this style. It is her arrangement of Time to Say Goodbye that they sing, even though originally it was his song. He sang it in a different style.

I have the entire collection of Brightman concerts and, ironically, this is probably the least brilliant of the five, which seem to become progressively better. But this is the concert PBS points to as its all-time most popular. It belongs in the collection of everyone who appreciates great music.

Brightman's purity of voice, range and versatility are boldly on display. She is equally adept in operatic style (O Mio Babbino Caro, Summertime) as in show tunes from West Side Story and Phantom of the Opera. Her Pie Jesu duet with a young boy (Adam Clarke) is extraordinarily beautiful. She also is in full control of Latin passion in Tu Quieres Volver. She blows me away every time I hear her sing Who Wants to Live Forever. But the highlight, of course, is the duet with Bocelli.

Negatives: Well, several times blaring French horns mar the beautiful notes emanating from Brightman's mouth. Her costuming isn't great. There is no choreography. And she must have had a bad hair day. However, the video is clear and there is no static, so if your DVD has static, send it back. If you are bothered by any visual problems, simply close your eyes and let the beautiful notes wash over you like the gentlest waves of a placid sea.",1253232000,3,1850,4.739130434782608

945347,4,6304916531,"I must say that I found myself unable to believe that this sweet, seraphic, wide-eyed woman is the same woman who appeared nude in two later music videos:  Winter Light and Ave Maria.

The voice is even different.  I didn't think a good voice could get better with age, but hers certainly has.  She went from great to even better!  Brava, Sarah, for all the hard vocal training.  She does her homework.

Five stars for the voice and presentation.  Some have complained of her facial expressions, but I must say that watching some of the more portly opera divas in action is sometimes excruciating to watch.  This is tame by comparison, and she appears much more natural.  Observe the way she raises her arms to get more breath in her lungs in a very poised, relaxed motion.  This woman knows what she's doing.

I have previously criticized Ms. Brightman's overt sexuality on the ""Ave Maria"" video and on the ""Classics"" CD jacket.  Regretfully, in this day and age, it takes more than sheer talent to sell a record to the masses.  At least I can respect her decision to be sensual in an artistic way.  As I watch this concert, I can hardly believe it's the same Sarah from both eras of her career.  Amazing.

This video is a treat for anyone who loves Sarah, a good concert, a good voice, or all of the above.  Don't expect the Sarah from the ""Live in Las Vegas"" DVD, however.  That is Future-Sarah, and I can't wait to see what she does next.

Sarah also sings ""Music of the Night"", which is something she says she doesn't get to do often, since the song was written for the Phantom. It's a rare treat.

On a side note, we took this DVD to my daughter's music instructor to show her the types of songs she wanted to learn. Her instructor was very impressed and thought my daughter could learn a lot from Sarah's style and stage presence.",1141257600,7,515,4.5978260869565215
945349,3,6304916531,"We are fans of Sarah Brightman, but this is an early video and it does not show her imagination and performing ability as the later videos do.  It starts out rather slow with her singing with the orchestra a variety of opera style songs and then graduates to her Phantom of the Opera songs which everyone seems to love.  She has too short of a performance with Andrea Bocelli-together they are great.",1141171200,,400,4.541666666666667

Now, I bought the LA LUNA-LIVE IN CONCERT DVD, slipped it in and veiwed the entire concert with my JAW on the floor! She is facinating in reveiling several costume changes with a theatrical flair. She has been vocally trained to perfection in Opera and has a big theatrical background. This all comes to life when she mixes Opera together with many songs sung in English such as ""a whiter Shade of Pale"". A couple of Spanish + 1 in Italian. Then she combines  Opera and straight vocal songs beautifully together in songs which is the ULTIMATE!!! A MUST SEE!!!AAAAA*****",1070928000,13,732,4.587786259541985
945452,4,6304916531,"I FINALLY BOUGHT THE DVD! It is worth having, because my VHS is glowing, and has finally begun to wear out. I added the DVD to my collection after debating whether or not I should really get it. Now I have it, and it is fine. The sound and picture is fine. The instrumental intro with short personal clips of Sarah is a nice touch. All the chamelionic looks are gorgeous. I don't have much to say about this DVD, other than the exquisite song selection, the appreciative audience and the well demanded encores. I think out of all three Brightman DVDs (One Night in Eden, La Luna, and Sarah Brightman in concert), the audience here appreciates her the most.
I have grown to like ""Tu Quieres Volver"" more, now that I've seen it many times live, and have seen it on the DVD. The song right away, broke the classical first half of the show. It's nice to hear more rarely sung songs from Brightman like ""Chanson Espagnol"", Solveig's song"", ""I feel pretty"" and ""Tonight"". I have never heard Sarah sing these 4 songs before hearing/watching them on my DVD/VHS.
The concert is made up of a decent time of approx. 73 minutes, considering some songs were a bit short, and some were long.
My copy has the photo taken from the box cover on it. The color is a bit off, but it's not bad. The item is good for collectors, classical music buffs, and diehard Brightman fans. I am all three. :)
My Sarah Brightman DVD collection is almost complete. Because of this DVD, I want to buy One night in Eden, on DVD, as well as the Royal Albert Hall Celebration.

Overture
Bailero

945453,5,6304916531,"IN CONCERT AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL
Sarah is amazing - her voice is phenomenal - there is no doubt that Sarah has the best and most beautiful voice in the world - ever! She is so talented - her voice is so warm and bright - no matter what style she sings: opera, musical or pop. Sarah looks so beautiful in this concert (she always do), the long sleek black hair looks so beautiful to her. Her warm-heartedness charisma and charm goes straight to your heart and soul.
The sound and the picture on this DVD are excellent.
The DVD begins with clips from Sarah's career: From her time with Pan's People and Hot Gossip. Together with Andrea Bocelli when they present an honour from the sale of TIME TO SAY GOODBYE. Sarah together with Frank Peterson. The Olympic Games in Barcelona 1992, when she and Jos Carreras sang AMIGOS PARA SIEMPRE. The church mess REQUIEM. As Christine in The Phantom of the Opera and the duet ALL I ASK OF YOU with Cliff Richard.
The concert starts with the very impressive song BAILERO.
Delibes' CHANSON ESPAGNOL from LES FILLES DE CADIZ is a wonderful and lively song.
Puccini's O MIO BABBINO CARO is so beautiful performed by Sarah.
Grieg's SOLVEIG'S SONG and Gershwin's SUMMERTIME are two wonderful songs.
PIE JESU from Andrew's church mess REQUIEM, Sarah sings duet with a young boy Adam Clarke, excellent.
Bernstein's SOMEWHERE, I FEEL PRETTY and TONIGHT. Somewhere I have to repeat myself, Sarah looks pretty and sings fantastic tonight at the concert.
Gipsy Kings' TU QUIERES VOLVER sounds great with acoustic guitar accompany - Sarah sings it so fantastic.
Queen's WHO WANTS TO LIVE FOREVER, wonderful.
Sarah sits on the piano when she sings WHISTLE DOWN THE WIND, with Andrew at the piano - playing. She looks so lovely. Nobody has a warmer smile and beautiful eyes than Sarah.
Sarah performs her two songs WISHING YOU WERE SOMEHOW HERE AGAIN and MUSIC OF THE NIGHT so wonderful.
Her most famous song, the duet TIME TO SAY GOODBYE she sings together with Andrea Bocelli at the concert. It's so wonderful and beautiful.
The final song DON'T CRY FOR ME ARGENTINA, Sarah sings it very emotionally and beautiful.
This DVD can be enjoyed again and again. Sarah is so fantastic - on this DVD too.

This CD contains many tracks from her ""Time to Say Goodbye"" CD.  Also, ""Balerio"" is the original version, not the one remade by Peterson from Eden.  If you are into her newer stuff, I wouldn't buy this one,however, if you like her voice, and you REALLY like classical pieces, you will certainly enjoy.  She also does the normal Phantom pieces as she still peforms today in her concerts.",1012953600,3,544,4.74468085106383
945457,5,6304916531,"Sarah Brightman's first concert video, performed live at the Royal Albert Hall and recorded in September 1997, contains material taken from Time To Say Goodbye, The Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection, and songs not on any other album.  Hearing the latter material is the real treat, and makes me wish a studio rendition would be put out on a future album.  The opening number, ""Bailero,"" would later appear on her Eden album.
In particular is her rendition of the Spanish-tinged ""Chanson Espagnol"" and Grieg's ""Solveig's Song.""  In the latter song, she covers her face with her hands, removes them, and sings, finishing the song with the covering gesture.
Ever since hearing ""O Mio Babbino Caro"" on Classics, I've really come to enjoy this song more than ever since hearing it on Time To Say Goodbye.  And seeing her perform ""Tu Quieres Volver"" and ""Who Wants To Live Forever"" alone is worth the video.
No, she does not bow out after ""Music Of The Night.""  She does an encore by dragging out Andrea Bocelli, and singing...um.. oh yeah, ""Time To Say Goodbye.""  She concludes with ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina"" from Evita.
The concert is divided in three sections, the first set of songs being the more operatic, up to the medley, and the second set utilizing her pop vocal, from ""Tu Quieres Volver"" to ""Whistle Down The Wind,"" by which time her voice is all rested up and ready to go on the Phantom songs and the encore.  One comment on ""Music Of The Night.""  What a nerve ALW had in giving that song to the phantom!  It's Sarah's by right and she proves it too!
Sarah's face is a little moon-faced here, and that aspect of her lends to her beauty.  It gives her face more articulation, especially when her eyes bulge round whenever she hits a high note.  She reminds me of a very cute hootie owl.  And I am blown away by that sweet smile of hers.
Sarah is easily a supernova compared to her guest performers, even ex-husband Andrew Lloyd Webber, who plays piano as she sings ""Whistle Down The Wind.""  Young choirboy Adam Clarke, who joins her on ""Pie Jesu,"" looks very bashful, but that's understandable, as he is no doubt overwhelmed at performing on stage live and alongside a goddess.  And as for poor Andrea Bocelli, well, need I say more?  At least someone made sure his tie was straight.
Seeing Sarah sing instead of hearing her merely sing her on five-inch silver disc is a triple treat, of which there are two other servings:  the Eden and La Luna concert videos.  Stay tuned!",1009584000,48,2479,4.610478359908884

945538,4,6304916531,"When I bought the video, I couldn't wait to listen to it. The sound quality is great. Sarah chose very exquisite songs for her repertoire. The concert was done in 3 styles. There was classic music like ""Les filles de Cadiz"", ""Pie Jesu"" and ""O mio babbino caro"". Other songs included music by Lloyd Webber.
In the 2nd part, Sarah serenaded us with her angelic renditions of hits like ""Who wants to live forever"", ""Tu quieres volver"" and a song from a new Lloyd Webber musical called ""Whistle down the wind"". Between parts, Sarah does 3 costume changes. She goes from an angel in a blue gown, which was almost bedroom curtain-like, to a tight black corset, then a flowing white floor length gown.
If there was anything funny about the video, it had to be the expressions on Sarah's face. She glanced wide-eyed into the camera, singing almost as if she was in pain. Despite that, she sang well. Some songs I found short. Some boring. The most boring was probably ""Summer time"". Another boring one was The 1st song, ""Bailero"". It went on too long.
The best part of all, had to be the 3rd part. Sarah did material from ""Phantom..."", ""Evita"" and the ever popular song ""Time to say goodbye"". The duet was perfect with Andrea Bocelli. It raises the hair up on my neck every time. You might find it better than the CD version. This song definately got a greater audience response than the other songs. Sarah looked every inch dignified at the end in ""Don't cry for me Argentina"".  It would've been nice to see her after, signing autographs.
I'm not bothered though. Buy the video if you like Sarah Brightman. It is a good cassette to add to your collection.",973987200,39,1648,4.548821548821548

""Sarah Brighman in Concert"" preceeded ""Eden""  by at least a year, however I have just recently purchased the video.  ""In Concert"" is not ""Eden"", it gets off to a rather  slow start, but it has a dynamite finish.
I am now scouring the net  attemptiing to find any other Sarah Brightman videos.",948672000,13,500,4.7011494252873565
945544,3,6304916531,"Sarah is not a world class singer in the class of  Maria Callas, Victoria de los Angeles, Renata Scotto, Helga Dernesch, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Elizabeth Schwarzkopf, Mirella Freni, Madi Mespli, and others you can hear  on ""The Best Opera Album in the World, Ever"" (EMI/Virgin #42203,  double CD). This latter double CD will make you cry, it is so beautiful,  and this from someone who never liked opera. I listen to it only about once  a week, so I won't get tired of it, and after several months it still grabs  my by the throat and makes tears run down my face. In 40 years of listening  to rock and pop, I have never experienced this before. Buy it! Skip this  video by Brightman. I hear she has done other good videos, but this is not  one of them.",944092800,16,751,4.307142857142857

There is a wide variety of songs:from Pie Jesu to ""Who Wants to Live Forever"" ( a Queen song).  I choked up when she sang ""Time to Say Goodbye"" with Andrea Bocelli.  I am very glad I bought this.  This is 2016 and I believe this concert is timeless.",1457740800,,361,3.8904109589041096
