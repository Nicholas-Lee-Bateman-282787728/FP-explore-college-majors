8754859,2,B01D4PHZ4G,"Disappointing sequel to 2012's The Bullet Vanishes with Lau Ching Wan back as Detective Song Donglu, investigating another series of seemingly impossible murders.  But this time around the detective isn't nearly as clever or quirky and the film suffers from the same air of general inferiority that almost inevitably affects Hollywood sequels, which are made for the bucks rather than because someone has a really great idea for the new film.

Fu Yuan (Yiyan Jiang), the mastermind behind the murders in the original escapes from solitary confinement in a women's prison and leaves a message for Song, who caught her in the first film, to meet her in the city.  They end up at a railroad station where someone apparently jumps from the roof of a building with an indictment against the town's leading industrialist painted across his shirt.  It looks like suicide but Song strongly suspects murder.  How do you make murder look exactly like a suicide?  And can it really be a coincidence that Fu Yuan led Song directly to the scene of this potential crime and used the opportunity to again vanish?

The Vanished Murderer boasts a genuinely hissable villain in the cold-blooded industrialist, a few suspects, a couple of twists and some reasonably well-staged if occasionally very silly action sequences, but the whole thing feels too perfunctory.  There are too many people involved with the crimes, which aren't ultimately all that clever or complicated this time around.  The motivations for the perpetrators are pretty murky, and how or why they came to work together is also never really explained.  There's also a general laziness to the storytelling--at one point the detective takes a dog from a crying little girl whose mom was the first murder victim to use as a witness, but we are apparently not supposed to think about the fate of the girl after the detective secures her dog.  Since she is filthy and talks about living with her mom (who is dead) there is reason to be concerned about her situation--not that the detective or the local cop with him seem to care.  Later the film's primary villain (the industrialist) disappears from the movie--apparently we aren't supposed to think about what happens to him either.

The Vanished Murderer is reasonably watchable if you like mysteries or lead actor Lau Ching Wan, but it's hard not to be disappointed considering the overall quality drop-off compared with the first film or with the many unsatisfying, illogical or poorly thought out elements in the screenplay, which feels like it was cobbled together without much thought or care.  Unfortunately, The Vanished Murderer proves that Hollywood doesn't have a monopoly on mediocre and unnecessary sequels.",1459555200,,2717,5.049217002237136
