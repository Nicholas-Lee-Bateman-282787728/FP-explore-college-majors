378244,3,6301925769,"I bought Goliath Awaits on tape, clearly edited down to an hour and a half from its original three hour run (airing over two nights back then). That was quite a hack job.

I've read another review that an entire subplot with John McIntire and Jeannette Nolan having a letter was removed. Yes, it was.

Also removed was much of Christopher Lee's explanation about how the atmosphere was maintained.

Another scene cut I always remembered was the diver emerging and the camera is from the diver's view and we see figures standing along the edge and suddenly the diver is shot and killed. This was removed.

I guess alot with Carradine was deleted as well.

What we do end up with is a young, overly-enthusiastic Mark Harmon.

And I had completely forgotten about this ""disease"" that afflicted the injured with a low, virtually nil, survival rate.

What we are left to enjoy (or try to enjoy) is scenes of Robert Riker, Jean Marsh, Alex Cord, Frank Gorshin, Carradine. Can't help but think this thing, with these people, should have been better.

The editing job is noticeable. I think there is a moment, possibly with Samms, where she is grieving one moment, then right off, she's chirping happily about something else.

Still before one can start to grumble about the plot or pacing, the movie will be over (I do recall watching it back then how it seemed unmercifully long, even then) so perhaps the editing job is for the better here.",1300406400,4,1435,4.685258964143427
378245,2,6301925769,"Improbable storyline, cheesy dialogue. This movie is in many ways a cult classic. Emma Samms made this movie right before she landed on General Hospital as Holly and she is utterly breathtaking in this film. A waste of a highly talented cast. Still a fun Saturday Night Cult Film.",1248480000,,280,4.73469387755102
378246,5,6301925769,Always have liked Mark Harmon and when this movie originally aired I watched it.  I always hoped it would come out on video.  The only thing that would make it better is if it came out on DVD and the deleted parts would be added back in.  Still would recommend this movie to other viewers.,1239667200,4,289,4.218181818181818
378247,4,6301925769,"I watched this movie because a friend recommended it to me and was not dissapointed. Just a great idea that was realised,usually these movies can't keep you interested for the sort of time this does. Later I was able to get it as and ex rental for $2,what a bargain but now my video player has died I am hoping they release it on DVD.But just a fun movie for all ages.",1205712000,4,368,4.125
378248,5,6301925769,"i will just start off by saying...I LOVE THIS MOVIE!...i watched it when it originally was first shown on tv, and then got a copy on vhs (that i had to pay over $100 for, back when these things were still rare)...now, we have entered the century of dvd's, and yet, this film was incredibly left behind...what they should have left behind was the terrifically horrendous TITANIC, which was more like a high school play compared to this movie...and, of course, with the new version of POSEIDON out (reviving the cult status of the original terrific flick), you would think that someone would get on the stick and get this puppy into production again...Christopher Lee, Mark Harmon, Emma Samms, Frank Gorshin...this was intelligent, and totally believable, given it's 'unique' concept...the acting was great, the sets were perfect, and the script, uncut, couldn't have been more sound...and, if the only way you can view this is in vhs form, i say, dump your dvd, throw away your ps2, trash your xbox, and get back to the basics...",1160006400,10,1028,4.846590909090909
378249,4,6301925769,"In 1939, luxury passenger liner Goliath was torpedoed and sank with presumably all hands lost.  Discovered in 1981, the salvage crew was a bit startled to find some 337 survivors aboard.  It turns out that the heroic crew took measures to ""hold the water back"" and special pumps were rigged to clean their remaining oxygen.  Once aboard, the salvagers discover a quasi-utopian society run by Captain Christopher Lee - but his dicatatorship has more than a few dark secrets.
Engrossing undersea adventure stretches credibility paper-thin but certainly scores points for originality.  I haven't seen the condensed video version, but try to catch the complete version on TV or cable.",1017360000,36,680,5.2110091743119265

""Showtime"" and ""The Movie Channel"" used to run this movie in it's full length with a break in the middle.  The VHS and Laserdisc versions of this movie have been cut and edited so poorly it ruins the movie.  This movie should be released in it's full length.  (Maybe they will do it for DVD).  Let's hope so.  I rated it a two only because of the bad editing in the Video.  The movie itself get's a Five!",983318400,30,484,4.085106382978723
378251,4,6301925769,I seen most of this movie many years ago.  On a tv mini series.  It was great.  lots of twists.  Been waiting to get a copy for myself so I can see the few parts I have missed.  This movie has kept me waiting to see the  whole thing for over 15 years,957225600,11,250,3.6226415094339623
378252,3,6301925769,"I was extremely disappointed with the video copy of ""Goliath Awaits"".  The original movie - I believe it was made for television - was more detailed.  The video, in fact, deletes an entire section about the  importance of the documents that went down on the Goliath and the U.S.  senator that went down with the ship.  It leaves a blank space in the film.  I wish they had left it alone and made the video the same as the film  version. The story is interesting and with the fairly recent discovery of  the Titanic time relevant.  What if someone had survived underwater?  I  honestly not sure that whoever edited this film actually watched it first.  Bad editing of the plot gives this a 3.",947030400,44,691,4.483870967741935

7816756,3,6301925769,"I saw this and had been wanting to buy this for decades. Seeing Amazon only had the VHS version I went with ""The Vermont Movie Store."" (an advertiser on the page) I had bought from them once before and got my order promptly and complete.
The DVD version is the full length (as least from what I can remember) However...
The DVD version is most likely made straight from the VHS and although a 2 disk set, the quality was at best so-so. I had to adjust the brightness and contrast on my 60 inch plasma quite a bit. After that it was watchable.
This being said there were many 'jumps' in the film that looked like old movie film splices, but not to the point of ruining the story (more annoying)

I still thought the movie (mini-series to be more exact) was just as good as when I saw it on TV. Which brings me to one other minor annoyance...through most of the movie there was a 'blurred out' spot on the screen where the channel logo had been blocked out. It was done fairly well and wasn't too distracting.

The story is still one of the original plots that to my knowledge has not been repeated in other movies and recommend it to sci-fi, adventure buffs.",1457740800,2,1157,4.302752293577981

7816762,5,6301925769,"I saw this on TV when it first came out many, many years ago and really enjoyed it. So much so that I remembered the title and actors names which is rare for me. I've seen so many older movies like this released to DVD that I've never even heard of  I can't believe that this movie is only on VHS and cost prohibitive to own. This REALLY should be released on DVD. I'll be the first one in line to buy it. Will someone please release a good quality digital version (not a low quality, grainy, made in someones living room copy)??

Update 3 years later: I just found this on a 2 DVD set, 194 minutes for $11 plus $3 for 1st class shipping from a store in VT that advertises at the bottom of Amazon's page for this item. I hope it's good quality as it says but at least I can finally see it now. Why it took so long and why Amazon didn't come up with it I don't know. I'll try to follow up with results positive or negative.

Results: Well the DVD version was pretty poor quality; at times hard to even make out what images were but at least I got to see the movie I hadn't seen in over 30 years. The case and artwork are all new and sealed as promised it just wasn't a good quality reproduction as I feared but still satisfied for the price since I finally got to see it. I've seen the same quality on other Amazon DVD's of older movies.",1351296000,3,1336,4.015037593984962
7816763,2,6301925769,"I bought this VHS version of Goliath Awaits! without bothering to first read any of the customer reviews. Big mistake. Had I done so, I might have discovered that this was a ""condensed"" version, which means that it was edited (in fact about an hour was cut from the film,) and I would never have bought it. 'Cause if there's one thing I can't stand, it's having a good movie cut all to hell. And they sure ruined this one! But I won't despair, because I know that Justice Awaits! There's got to be a special place in Hell for those who edit good movies, and the people at Vidmark and Columbia who did this piece of butchery will surely see it.",1305158400,5,643,4.278688524590164
