7806467,5,6300213404,"Contrary to all the ridiculousness that has been said about this movie, just because it says ""Jackie Chan's"" doesn't mean he's in it. Do your homework before buying a movie. He's directing it. It was still an excellent movie!  The choreography was superb. Each actor showed excellent technique and it was full time action packed with fight scenes. You have to remember the time and era in which it was made. In those days, the ""Kung Fu"" flick became all the rage. It wasn't about intricate plots and special effects. It was about raw in your face Kung Fu action from start to finish. This movie reminded me of the old Karate video games like Double Dragon and River City Ransom where the fighter starts out simple and then advances to bigger, more difficult and technical fights. The last fight being the toughest boss.

It still has the trademark corney Asian humor that was standard to some of the old movies, especially involving Jackie Chan. But nevertheless, a classic in its own right and worth watching by anyone who claims to love watching great Kung Fu movies. Enjoy it!",1382400000,,1079,4.703703703703703
7806468,5,6300213404,Excellent condition and quick sending.  Does not contain Young Master though but instead contains Drunken Master so look for Young Master elsewhere.,1297728000,,148,5.7272727272727275

7806470,4,6300213404,"While on shore leave, Scotty blacks out and is accused of murdering a local tavern girl. Kirk wants to clear Scotty of the charge but, for diplomatic reasons, must submit to the planet's own judicial process. The guilty party turns out to be an evil entity who was also responsible for the Jack the Ripper murders centuries earlier on Earth. This might sound far-fetched, but the episode unfolds step by step as a gripping murder mystery, so that when the revelation is finally presented, it does not seem so absurd.

Several features make this episode of interest.

The planet is made up neither of barbarians nor an advanced species, but rather a highly civilized, peace-loving people whose technology lags behind our own yet don't particularly need Federation help. The sets and costumes are vaguely Middle Eastern, but these people are not necessarily Muslims.

The values of this culture differ from Earth's, in that the people seem content with a late Medeival (or early modern) level of technology and value simple pleasures over industrialization. But unusually for Trek, this culture is not ultimately seen to be invalid or inferior to our own! Indeed, the leader of the planet prefers his way of life but is not so closed-minded as to refuse technology when needed to save the life of an innocent man. The law of the planet is ""the Law of Love,"" he declares. Strangely, the penalty for murder is ""death by slow torture,"" which would seem to contradict the Law of Love. This contradiction is resolved only by imagining that there have been no murders for many years.

Another notable aspect of this episode is that it is one of the few ""hard science"" episodes -- or rather, hard math. When the entity flees into the Enterprise computer, Kirk and Spock neutralize it by giving the computer a command that can never be completed: calculate pi to the last digit. This task so overloads the computer banks that the entity is forced to flee into another body, where Kirk finally defeats it.

Finally, another delightful aspect of the episode involves a ""happy drug."" The entity feeds not so much on death as on fear and terror. Therefore, to fight the entity, McCoy injects the entire crew with a drug to induce giddy euphoria. George Takei (Sulu) has one of his all-time great scenes, responding to Kirk's orders while being stoned.",1186963200,,2337,4.8325
7806471,3,6300213404,"Great fight coreagrphy by Jackie Chan. 98 lb weakling, begs to join temple to learn kung-fu to avenge his father. he learns with amazing speed. tons and tons of long involved fights. he wins some he loses, he goes back for 1 week of training, he wins, gets new challenge, 1 month training, fights the big boss master, he wins, with help, the end.",1151971200,,346,4.421875
7806472,1,6300213404,"As some of the other viewers have already noted... this film does not star Jackie Chan (however, he did direct it).  The movie is actually pretty good- but I am here to tell you that this (Brentwood Home Video) copy is horrible.  You can even see people walking in front the screen during certain parts- the images are cut off due to it being filmed directly from a TV screen.  Vintage Video released the same film in ""Jackie Chan- Triple Punch Collection"".  The box set is cheap and the transfer is actually a trasfer- not a video of a TV screen.  The quality is still low, but acceptable considering it is not digitally remastered.  It is ashame that Amazon carries Brentwood- they should rethink carrying such a shady company.  (Just so you know- the triple punch is not that great of a deal, the second movie ""fantasy mission"" is ridiculously poor by any standards).

All the above aside- the film should get some credit- it is not the fault of  Hua Chen that his movie was pirated and deviously marketed.  The movie IS good, the surrounding context is what makes this a rip off.",1123718400,7,1083,4.536082474226804
7806473,2,6300213404,"Do not believe the cover of the movie. This is not a Jackie Chan movie. You see him in a behind the scenes bit in the beginning, but that's it. As far as the movie itself, I've only seen it once and it wasn't good enough for me to not get so easily distracted from it. I can't really remember too much about it anymore. Not memorable.",1121990400,,334,4.0
7806474,1,6300213404,"This is not a JC Flick. If we are talking about standards of Jackie Chan actually starring in the movie that is. He was the director of the movie that is for sure but he does not play any cameo whatsoever in this movie. I was dissapointed when realizing this. My fault was not reading any reviews whatsoever and any reviews that I did read did not fortell this information. Well their ya go there is no Jackie Chan in this movie whatsoever. The fighting scenes are beautiful and are demonstrated fantastically but the movie lacks in storyline (Much like any other Jackie Chan movie). I suggest several other movies consisting on what you are looking for. This movie is certainly a action orianted movie set out to feed the action hungry flick goer. If you enjoy a good action flick with a nice story line check Accidental Spy also by Jackie Chan. Another with a more Dramatic touch to it is the Drunken Master Saga including several great martial artists Saga includes>>

Ledgend of Drunken Master--Return of the Drunken Master

Names of movies change due to language barrier and marketing excuses. --India name is--Drunken Monkey in Tiger Eye--

Taiwan--Drunken Monkey Fist--

Keep a look out for the movies and read the reviews. Many have different tnames then what you really read them for. Just be careful. Nevertheless I would recommend this film if you are looking for a good Action flick..not a Jackie Chan action movie!",1097452800,2,1427,4.765182186234818
