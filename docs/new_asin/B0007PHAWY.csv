8050304,5,B0007PHAWY,"This ballet, or dance drama as Gillian Lynne, prefers to call it, was a long-wished for collaboration between herself and the composer, Carl Davis. It came about as a result of a very open-ended commission form the BBC to `make something' (BBC quote) to celebrate L.S. Lowry's work for a television production celebrating the 100th anniversary of his birth (1887-1976).

The talents of the Northern Ballet were combined with those of Christopher Gable and Moira Shearer who were persuaded to come out of dance retirement, and with a great deal of training in the particular dance/acting moves required `A Simple Man' became reality. Finally Albert Finney was engaged to provide an illustrated introduction - a choice based on his shared experience of growing up in Salford like Lowry.

The production takes the form of 8 scenes depicting stages in Lowry's life based upon the images and situations depicted in his paintings. An enormous amount of care was taken to achieve exactly the correct postures and gestures and it was this aspect that was the most challenging for the dancers who had to learn a whole range of new dance movements and styles.

All of this is explained in a totally fascinating 50 minute retrospective conversation between Gillian Lynne and Carl Davis as a bonus feature. The equally interesting 11 minute introduction by Albert Finney is also included. These two features add enormously to the appreciation of the ballet/dance drama.

The actual production and dancing fully justifies this immense care and is a very rewarding experience. The production went on to be a staple stage production featured in the Northern Ballet repertoire for years and Christopher Gable was engaged as their director in 1987 after the broadcast.

The visual format of the ballet and introduction is in 4:3 but this scarcely matters as this format was exactly how it had been conceived for filming. Any wider image would have been wrong therefore. The actual imaging is totally crisp and very well lit and stands up excellently to close scrutiny. The sound is in excellent stereo. The later documentary is in 16:9 format. Opus Arte have made a fine job of processing the original BBC recording for this DVD presentation.

There is no alternative to this DVD production which, thankfully, is a model of its kind. As everything about it is of the highest quality and exactly as originally conceived, I can see no justification in withholding and of the full 5 stars. This is therefore a very highly recommended issue in my opinion.",1343088000,3,2534,4.992890995260663
8050305,5,B0007PHAWY,"It is with great embarrassment that I admit I'd never heard of the subject of this narrative ballet, 'A Simple Man': the English painter L. S. Lowry. Laurence Stephen Lowry (1887-1976) is claimed by some to be the best-known English painter of the 20th century. In his paintings he depicted the industrial landscapes of the Midlands, with backgrounds of chimneys and industrial buildings before which crowds of drably dressed figures move in a state of isolation. Color is subdued and the naive elements lead one to believe that Lowry was himself naive, but closer inspection shows the masterful composition and tonal combinations he used. He was a native of Salford, a suburb of Manchester, and this ballet was commissioned in 1987 by that city to commemorate the centenary of his birth. This DVD is of that 1987 performance. It brought together the talents of choreographer Gillian Lynne, who choreographed 'Cats' and 'Phantom of the Opera,' and composer Carl Davis, a New Yorker long resident in England, who is best known for his work in TV and films and as the co-composer of Paul McCartney's 'Requiem.'

Best of all this performance by the Northern Ballet Theatre brings back two long-retired stars of the Royal Ballet as the main soloists: Moira Shearer, best known for her luminous performance in the movie 'The Red Shoes,' and Christopher Gable, possibly the best-known male dancer at the Royal Ballet until his retirement. He was 47 when this ballet was filmed and he has since died of cancer. The music is performed by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra under the composer.

The ballet is introduced by Albert Finney, himself a native of Salford. He gives us the basic facts of Lowry's life -- his devotion to his mother, with whom he lived until her death when he was 51, and his living alone, grief-stricken, for the rest of his life, working his day job as a rent-collector and painting at night in a small room in his home. The ballet relives this story against a background similar to Lowry's paintings. The corps de ballet are clothed as the people in his paintings.

This all sounds very grim, but indeed Lynne's choreography is quirky, angular and often comic. Shearer and Gable are simply stupendous in their roles. Shearer, still slim and with that crown of glorious red hair, acts and dances the Mother's fragility and imposing will with artistry. Gable is enormously effective in his role as Lowry; he is a consummate actor. Lynne's choreography and Gable's dancing of Lowry's grief are stunningly done. Davis's music, unfailing tonal and tuneful, is suitably lyrical, tender, dramatic or comic as the story dictates. Videography is crisp and unobtrusive.

I will admit that I'm not an aficionado of dance, and certainly not qualified as a dance critic, but I did love this ballet and its presentation. The opportunity to see Moira Shearer dance  again -- she had retired from dancing to become an actress at age 27 -- was a delight.
