4158941,5,B003NHMYJM,"I like the way Shout!, along with Classic Media and Tokyo Shock are finally giving these old monster movies the respect they deserve. Even though this looks like a $5.00 movie bin double feature at Wal-Mart or Target, don't be fooled. You get a picture gallery for each movie, and like it says, both english and uncut Japanese versions for both movies. I haven't even watched the english versions yet...I'm afraid to. After Gamera vs. Gyaos, they got really bad in terms of dubbing, especially the Sandy Frank versions. Everyone knows these movies are stinky, but when you hear everyone's voices as they really are, they aren't as annoying. 10 year-old kids don't sound like teenagers on dope, and the grown-ups don't sound like they have frogs in their throats. Even bad movies, when given a good representation can be much better. If you like this kind of movie, this is worth buying. And the price is good, too. Thank you Shout! for this great deal, and hopefully everyone who is interested will buy this. It's much better than any of the other releases I've seen so far.",1294444800,,1074,4.718085106382978
4158942,3,B003NHMYJM,I have been buying all of the Gamera Dvd's that Shout has been making and this one is my least favorite. I watched it as a kid and it was filled with more excitement but when i watched Gamera Vs. Guiron again it was focused more around humans than Gamera. Guiron is a pretty cool monster and when Gamera and Guiron did fight it was more than awesome. Gamera is like a five medal winning gymnastic in the movie. The only thing you really have to get used to is the english dubs but if your a fan of monster movies you will deal with it. I suggest you buy it just so your collection is complete.,1290729600,,593,4.076923076923077
4158943,5,B003NHMYJM,"Okay folks, Neither one of these movies are worthy of any awards or critical praise. Not even by monster standards. But I do like what they did with this dvd. This is a one sided disc not a flipper. That's the first good thing. Another good thing is IT HAS ENGLISH DUBS! YES, THAT IS A GOOD THING! NOT A BAD THING! But you purists don't have to worry. Both movies are presented with Japanese language tracks in vibrant color in the 2:35.1 widescreen aspect ratio. Back to the English dubs. Unless you go to set-up and specifically select the English dub the movie automatically plays the Japanese version. So I don't see the validity of giving this dvd a bad review because of the available options to hear the movies in english. Gamera vs Jiger aka Gamera vs Monster X the second of the two has only one English dub. Take it or leave it.  Gamera vs Guiron has two. I forget which number choice is which, but if you select a dub and the voice acting is absolutely dreadful you'll know you got the Sandy Frank version. Here's probably the biggest reason I like this dvd so much. Before this dvd came out you had the choice of either getting the AIP version (the superior dub) of this on dvd with the Space Gyaos getting sliced up edited out, under the alternate title ATTACK OF THE MONSTERS, not to be confused with WAR OF THE MONSTERS, the alternate title for GAMERA vs BARUGON (pronounced barooo-gon) not to be confused with Toho's Baragon (pronounced..well, baragon) ORRRRR, the unedited yet so horrible to listen to Sandy Frank version. This is what the makers of this dvd did to correct that problem. You can select the AIP voice track. When that Gyaos slice scene comes up you'll just briefly hear the Sandy Frank dub. Then it reverts back to the AIP. In closing, a quick assessment of both movies. Gamera vs Guiron, by far has got to be the worst Gamera movie ever made. It makes Gamera vs Viras aka Destroy all Planets look like a respectable effort. Gamera vs Jiger aka Gamera vs Monster X  (oops, I mentioned that already, didn't I) tries to recapture the flavor of the first three Gamera films, but doesn't want to lose the bankable ""Gamera friend to children"" nitch. So what we wind up with is a fun to watch once in a while weak effort, that doesn't take itself too seriously, but somehow you wish it did. Oh... how you wish... it did. I have an UPDATE 1/29/2013 which no one will probably read, but I'll write it anyway. English Dub 1 is the AIP version and English Dub 2 is the Sandy Frank dub. The only drawback is you can not change the audio directly with your dvd audio button on your remote. You have to go to the main menu and select set-up to choose an audio.",1285804800,20,2680,4.401209677419355
4158944,2,B003NHMYJM,"This is not how Americans should see Japanese films and just add to the
bad reputations these films have in the U.S.A.
As I said in my review of the last Gamera release:
I likd the first two releases of Gamera The Giant Monster and Gamera vs.
Barugon and enjoyed August Ragone's commentary very very much.
I was at first disappointed that these new discs would not have a commentary,
but was then elated when I found out that these would have English dub tracks.
It is pretty common knowledge, I believe, that some of the Gamera films have
not just one, but two, existing English vocal tracks. One superior track
recorded by American international on the second through fifth films and
a very inferior set of tracks released on the the first three, fifth and
seventh films. I wondered why they had not utilized one one the first two disks.
Well, printed on the covers of this disc and its companion release was a notice
that, not only did they have the English vocal track, but where applicable
they would have both existing English tracks. Well, I thought to myself
that its about time someone got this smart with these things.

THEN I WATCHED THEM. HORROR AND FRUSTRATION!!!

Both English tracks are out of sink with the movies. Sometimes as long as
six seconds off. Its as if they simply played the English tracks against
the visual and didn't even bother to try to edit or make it fit, and I am
reasonably sure that is exactly all they did. They just started the sound
and the film at the same time and let them play to the end. It is terrible
and a blight on Japanese films in America.

DID THEY EVEN CARE!!

We have characters moving their mouths and nothing coming out. Then voices from
out of nowhere when no ones lips are moving. It is frustrating in
the extreme. It is especially bad on the already inferior tracks, but the
superior American International track is also way out of sink.

IT""S LIKE A BOOTLEG. THE ENGLISH AUDIO IS OF PIRATE QUALITY.
I cannot stress this enough.

American's already think that dubbing is terrible on Japanese monster
movies. Now they are right. Congratulations on this major screw up.
I can only shudder when I think of what the next release, Gamera vs. Zigra/
Gamera Super Monster, will be like. Both of those films are pretty bad already
they sure as hell don't need bad dubbing to add t it.

I have some DVDs I bought at a convention, where they had the Japanese Laser
Disks of Johnny Sokko dubbed over with English audio some kid had recorded
in the early 70's by holding a microphone up to the TV speaker. It never really
matches except once or twice. Even a broken clock is correct twice a day.
That is what these are like.",1285632000,2,2671,4.483539094650205
4158945,3,B003NHMYJM,"Shout Factory continues the Gamera series with 2 more in this double feature DVD
At this point in the Gamera series, the movies began to decline and rely heavily on the use of children as the main focus. With lots of kids, children singing the Gamera song, goofy music Gamera doing some weird tricks against his foes,the movies got odder and odder...
This set is of no exception - 2 more 'way out there' Gamera movies coming up !
Gamera vs. Guiron aka Guillon aka Attack of the Monsters has Gamera fighting off a giant knife monster on the Planet Terra. 2 kids accidentally fly out into space & land on this planet where 2 alien ladies want to eat their brains. On this planet is also a species of Space Gyaos (one of which gets hacked by Guiron which is cut in several prints)
There are many transfers to this title such as the AIP version was used by Alpha and was a cut crummy transfer while on VHS The Celebrity Video version (Sandy Frank version) was uncut and used by Mystery Science Theater 3000. The dubbing is atrocious in my opinion. So was the hammy music. Listen for the kid (Akio) going on throughout the film about traffic accidents. And he gets his head shaved in this too. And of course there is the character ""KornChan"" (office Kondo) which on the MST version he's Cornjob by Joel & the Bots. He's in Gamera vs. Jiger too.
Recently, various websites are reporting that the DVD for Gamera vs Guiron will contain 2 English language versions (Sandy Frank & The AIP version)  + A Japanese version will be included.
After watching it - the Sandy Frank dub can be heard during the AIP cut of the film where Guiron is chopping Space Gyaos into pieces. This was originally cut from the AIP due to its content.
Neptune Video had a great English language widescreen VHS version which this reviewer hopes was hoping that it be used for this DVD release. It isnt, so keep your tapes :)
Gamera vs. Jiger aka Monster X has a monster coming to life to destroy Expo 70 when a statue is taken off sacred ground releasing this monster. This monster is a quadruped that can fly, float , spit spears..its like something from a Johnny Sokko movie. Retromedia released the AIP version on DVD and it was just OK - some of us were thankful that someone finally released it to home video. I expect (& we do get) a MUCH better transfer from Shout on this title. This DVD will have the AIP English language version along with the Japanese version.
Thanks again Shout for getting the rights to genre titles that many Gamera and Kaiju fans have waited a long time for
Not only do we get Japanese and English language versions but we also  get some very sharp clean transfers for all the titles..the widescreen transfers are excellent. You won't find a cleaner transfer on any DVD anywhere, anytime except of course the Japanese DVDs.
Also the titles for both English dubs are the Japanese title of the movie..",1279324800,8,2897,4.484848484848484
4158976,5,B003NHMYJM,"Guiron has and will always be my favorite vintage Gamera film. Growing up in the 70's meant weekends were reserved for Creature Feature nights on television and this was scene quite frequently on my local channels.
  The video & audio on these are the best I have ever seen released in the United States. You get the original and English dubs to these films.  Guiron gives you 2 English Dubs and even has the banned dismemberment scene that was cut from the American versions. Highly recommended!",1387065600,,496,4.744186046511628
4158977,5,B003NHMYJM,"While I adore the MST3K versions of these Gamera films, it's a real eye-opener to see what these looked like before Sandy Frank got ahold of them. It's best to watch in Japanese with captions on for the original experience. The quality is superb in both video and audio. This review also goes for the other two Gamera double-feature releases: Gamera vs. Zigra / Gamera: The Super Monster and Gamera vs. Gyaos / Gamera vs. Viras.",1378339200,,428,4.644736842105263
4158978,5,B003NHMYJM,"The picture looks great, the sound quality is great considering the time period these films were made in, and yes the Sandy Frank English dubbed version is included in this double feature so we finally get to see the deleted scene within the film in which Guiron decapitates and dismembers Space Gyaos!",1376697600,,302,4.826923076923077
4158979,5,B003NHMYJM,"Go Gamera!!!  As far as monsters go, he's not the strongest, or the fastest, or the most coordinated, and he sometimes crash lands, and can be a bit of a cry baby when he gets hurt.  But, he's a giant flying turtle with jet packs for legs with great theme music and a huge heart!  Loved him as a kid, love him still.  This double set of Gamera vs. Guiron/Jiger are classic little boys adventures, including flying saucers, beautiful space women, a miniature submarine, a mysterious statue with secret powers, and so much more. Gamera rules!",1360800000,,540,4.59375
4158980,4,B003NHMYJM,Very well put together.  Brought back good memories from when I was a kid watching giant monster movies like Gamera and Godzilla.  Hokey shows but fun!,1360195200,,151,4.769230769230769
4158981,5,B003NHMYJM,ths was a reailly cool gift i got  never seen this one movie on there i always look for lots and have tons of these movies thanks,1355011200,,129,3.7777777777777777
4158982,5,B003NHMYJM,"Shout Factory is to be commended for its treatment of what many consider to be, second rate Godzilla movies.  These are the ultimate versions of these films for western monster fans.

The prints are beautiful and the options to watch original Japanese or one of two dubbed versions (Sandy Frank) makes this a must have for any Kaiju (Giant Monster) fan.

Now if only they would go back and do this with the first two films in the series then I would be content.

Bless you Shout Factory!",1322697600,,487,4.5
4158983,4,B003NHMYJM,"Family friendly Godzilla-like Movies (No cussing, no using the Lord's name in vain, and no sexual content)! Some of the monster to monster violence might be too scary for smaller kids (shows purple monster blood). Gamera is a good monster that defends children, and so the main characters are children, and that aspect draws children into the movie. I also highly recommend the double feature DVD from Shout! Factory of Gamera vs. Gyaos (1967)/Gamera vs. Viras (1968). On the setup menu choose the English Audio Dub #1, it is a clean English version that doesn't use words like ""hell"".

I also recommend the family friendly 2006 movie Gamera the Brave.

The Gamera 90's Trilogy is awesome, but they are not for children (they are much darker/violent/scary) and had cussing in them. Here is why I didn't like the other older Gamera movies: The 1st original movie was in Black & White and he doesn't fight anyone, the 2nd movie Gamera vs. Barugon has a lot of human to human ugly violence and a lot of cussing (and the fights with Barugon are re-shown in the Viras movie, so you won't miss them), Gamera vs Zigra was just terrible and had bad dark underwater lighting the whole movie (I think it used the Lord's name in vain, but can't remember), Super Monster was terrible (90% of it was clips from the previous Gamera movies) and had cussing in it and a girl wearing a very skimpy bikini.",1317427200,,1388,4.638211382113822
4158984,5,B003NHMYJM,"""Messages from outer space?""
That's the premise behind Gamera VS. Guiron, an unabashed children's movie about a space ship landing on Earth.  Two boys hijack this space ship and take off with Gamera in hot pursuit (apparently, besides being a friend to children, Gamera is also psychic and knows when they're in trouble).  They land on a planet just in time to witness a knife-headed monster hack another monster into pieces, literally.  The planet is called Terra and is a twin to Earth, occupying the exact opposite orbital position as Earth, which explains why it's never been seen (an idea that's been used before).  The last remaining inhabitants are two women, desperate to get to Earth; will the two boys help them?
Wonderfully absurd, inconsequential fluff, the two greatest revelations in this film is that Gamera knows gymnastics and the villains of this piece aren't the monsters but the two women (with gruesome appetites)!
Not bad, as Gamera films go, but I could have done without the ""stop wars"" message tacked onto the end.

The second feature has Gamera battling a different monster: Jiger.  Jiger is particularly vicious, able to shoot quills, an energy beam; she also has a special suction feature and a secret weapon: the ability of injecting her victim with an egg.  This plot device allows 2 boys to enter Gamera and kill the baby Jiger inside....while Gamera lies comatose on a beach, quietly turning a whiter shade of pale.  It's a tossup as to which scene is the creepiest; this one or the sight of Gamera shoving telephone poles into his ears!
I can do without the weird theme song, but that aside, two enjoyable entries in this series.  A keeper.",1307836800,4,1673,4.842105263157895

8401119,5,B003NHMYJM,"Gorgeous-looking copies of both movies include not only the beloved AIP English dubs we grew up with as kids, but the notoriously silly Sandy Frank dubs as well, which were created for the films when they made their first go-round on home video in the glory days of VHS. Film Purists can also watch 'em both in their native Japanese language with English subtitles if they so choose.

GAMERA vs. GUIRON: 2 kids (one American & one Japanese) discover a spaceship en route to Earth while searching the stars with their telescope. It conveniently lands nearby and the tykes climb on board to investigate. Before you can say ""Holy Hijacking!"" they're whisked away through galactic space to a barren, icy planetoid called 'Terra' which we are told sits directly on the opposite side of the sun from Earth. On all of Terra, only two female inhabitants remain. The planet has been overrun by deep-space cousins of the batty Gyaos monsters, so the Terrans created 'Guiron,' a giant fish/dog guardian creature, with a huge knife-shaped head and built in ninja throwing stars. Whoa! Watch out, Gamera!! Guiron may seem to have Gamera beaten by a nose, but we all know that nothing can keep our gymnastic turtle hero down for the count! And as for those gorgeous gals... be careful boys! Sure, those Terran tarts seem warm & friendly - AT FIRST! - but watch out, because those supposedly groovy space babes are actually brain-hungry cannibals! Yikes!

GAMERA vs. JIGER: My personal all-time favorite entry in the entire series. A team of scientists are intent on delivering a mysterious statue, discovered on exotic Wester Island, to a specially constructed display at the soon-to-open 1970 World Expo in Japan. But, when the stone totem is removed from its perch atop a massive mound of boulders, they unwittingly unleash an ancient curse in the form of the deadly monster Jiger (aka Monster X). She (that's right, SHE) is one mean bee-yotch, lemma tell ya! When Gamera tries to intercede on mankind's behalf, his reward is to be injected with one of Jiger's embryos, which immediately hatches and begins feeding on our hero's blood, quickly rendering him unconscious! Zoinks! Will Jiger destroy Expo '70 or can Gamera recover from his coma, stop the fiendish fanged female and Save The Day? It's goofy, grand adventure all the way, as our two brave young heroes do a cool reverse-take on the Fantastic Voyage concept, boldly piloting a homemade mini-sub INSIDE Gamera to combat the vampiric Jiger infant at the source! Inner Space was never so Far Out! (Oh, and brace yourself for the unforgettable, gross-out, ""elephant trunk surgery"" scene! It'll stick with you looong after the movie's over! LOL.) They truly do not make them like this anymore.

Both features are finally available here in their proper aspect ratio on 1 single-sided DVD, and thankfully neither has been tampered with. These wonderful new releases are a real treat to watch. For decades, Gamera fans have had to suffer with heavily-edited, faded, grainy-looking, garbly-sounding Public Domain copies. Well, no more! Bless you Shout! Factory for a wonderful job restoring these kaiju classics to their original aspect ratios. Both are beautiful, brightly colored, clean sounding and razor sharp. These Shout! 'GAMERA' DVDs have been available for some time now, so picking them up used means you can afford to collect the entire Showa-era Gamera film franchise for cheap! If you've been waiting, then wait no longer! If you've never had the surreal pleasure of watching an old school Gamera movie then you're in for a trippy treat, times two! 5 STARS for this superb double feature DVD of Gamera.",1387584000,5,3656,4.980360065466448
