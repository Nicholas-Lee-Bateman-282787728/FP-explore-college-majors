5020220,5,B006UTDGDS,"What happens when you cross ""Sgt. Frog"" with ""Invader Zim""? You get a whole lot of SQUID! If you're looking for a good comedy series that will always put a smile on your face, then look no further. ""Squid Girl"" is about a half-girl/half-squid who's come up to the surface land to enslave the humans who have been polluting her ocean. The only problem is that she easily gets side-tracked from her mission and ends up getting bullied into working at a beach house restaurant.

I'm not an expert in the technical aspects of video and audio on home video discs; however, the picture quality of the Blu-Ray looks great, and the sound quality sounds fine as well.

In short, if you're a fan of comedy anime shows, be sure to give this squid a little love.",1334620800,14,750,4.467153284671533

8504706,4,B006UTDGDS,"Honestly, this kind of stuff is really up for grabs. Many will like it, many others will not. I like this anime because it's lighthearted, it's funny, and very random; gives it a slice-of-life feel to it. The only thing I'm not too keen on is the way she speaks, though I will admit its quite clever how she incorporates words like beak, ink, or phrases like ""are you squidding me?!"" Another thing I don't like about Squid Girl is how annoying she is. But I guess that's her core personality so there really isn't much I could gripe about. Anyway, funny anime, but with all her different abilities, I think the producers as well as the graphic novelist could utilize it a little better and make her more badass as opposed to a total klutz.",1367020800,,739,4.4411764705882355
8504707,4,B006UTDGDS,"My younger sister and I saw this series on Netflix, we watched all 12 episode of season one in a few days. The puns were cute, and we had quite a few laughs. Overall, this anime was really fun and enjoyable, Squid Girl was adorable, and I liked all the other characters as well. The series was very well done.

Iffy Content: However, there are a few things I wish the series had left out. Occasionally throughout the episodes there was some language, which is too bad since it is directed towards a younger audience, but I know anime typically has some language. Also in one episode, the three men scientist who are often trying to test out their alien equipment on Squid Girl get their clothes cut off. We briefly see them from behind cowering on the ground. The final thing was there is a girl who is completely obsessed with Squid Girl, it was a bit awkward/uncomfortable at times, but there wasn't anything really inappropriate.

If those things don't bother you, or if you just want to keep them in mind, then I would say watch Squid Girl! :)",1366243200,2,1047,4.476439790575916
8504708,5,B006UTDGDS,"This is a really good series; cute, funny, full of puns (like 'scared the kelp out of me', 'shut your beak', 'inkredible!', 'I'm just jetting off', 'what the squid??' etc.!).

All the characters are great in their own way, from the quietly scary big sis Chizuru Aizawa, through younger sister, the pushy, red-headed Eiko, who run the 'Beach House 'Lemon'' seaside restaurant, and their little brother Takeru, who adores Squid Girl, and calls her 'Squid Girly' in the English dub (Ika Nee-chan, lit. 'Big Squid Sister' in the Japanese); he thinks of her as a big sister and playmate. Squid Girl herself is bonkers; she was sent to the surface world to conquer humanity for polluting the oceans, but has not exactly researched her invasion; she thinks there are only about 1,000 people in the world! She never thinks anything through, has the attention span of a goldfish (or maybe a squid?), is scared of plastic killer-whale buoyancy toys, and eats like a horse (but not a sea-horse!); in one episode, she was given 10,000 yen (about $110) as a reward for finding and returning a lost wallet, and spent it all on shrimp from the local supermarket, which she then proceeded to eat all in one go! She sometimes vomits up black squid ink (which Chizuru decides to use as spaghetti sauce in the restaurant, at which Eiko comments 'You cannot be serious?! I just watched her barf that up!'), and loves teasing waitress Nagisa Sait, who is the only person who is genuinely scared of her, and actually sees her as a threat to humanity! However, she soon warms to the other characters, and becomes a good friend and useful employee of the restaurant, aided by her ability to use her tentacles to carry multiple orders to customers at once!

I really enjoyed the series, except that it was too short at only 12 episodes, but there is a second season in the offing; I can't wait!",1359417600,5,1869,4.677811550151976
8504709,5,B006UTDGDS,"I purchased this version of the anime at Youmacon 2012 in Detroit Michigan. I also purchased the original season one back at the convention last year.

 This anime is a fun light-hearted comedy. It does have it's fan-service like moments, but they are fairly far between. The use of squid in this anime is always funny, and the characters are all full of personality. Media Blasters did an amazing job on casting the voices for this anime, as the english dub is very well done. When viewing these in my Blu-ray player I found it to be of good quality, the colors rich and vibrant, and the lines to be nice and crisp.

- Fudgetruck's final verdict: ""This anime is great if you just want to watch a comedy that won't put you through a roller-coaster of emotion. It'll always make you laugh with it's sometimes odd sense of humor. And watching squid girl run around trying to ""Invade"" the world is pretty hysterical, you should defiantly buy this, it's a great addition to anyone's collection.",1353369600,,990,4.613636363636363
8504710,5,B006UTDGDS,"Good value for the 35 0dd dollars I got it for. There aren't too many shows that are available in a well done English dub, so I make an effort to buy the ones that come around.",1350000000,,176,3.7837837837837838
8504711,5,B006UTDGDS,"Squid Girl (Shinryaku! Ika Musume in its original Japanese incarnation) is a short and sweet venture into pun-based and, almost literally, fish-out-of-water comedy. Our protagonist and seaborne invader arrives on land, ready to conquer the surface; slowly, but surely! She quickly realized that this task might have been a little too daunting for someone with her... (let's be kind here) limited martial experience. She's not one to call it quits, though, and she got a hairful of tentacles to aid her in her quest! Quicker than you could say ""fried shrimp"", however, she finds herself working at a local beach restaurant to pay off her newly acquired debt. Looks like the invasion will have to be put on the back-burner... or could this be a blessing in disguise; the perfect opportunity to infiltrate human society and gain valuable intel?

Much of the humor in the show is based around Squid Girl's inability to even come close to accomplishing any of the lofty goals she sets for herself, but there is also a good deal of focus on the rest of the cast, who offer great variety and personality. Without going through each and every character, there's Chizuru; the strict and frighteningly powerful older sister and Eiko, the younger straight-woman of the group, as well as Sanae; a girl who has an inexplicable, stalker-level crush on Squid Girl. There's also a trio of supposed MIT graduate researchers who are convinced that Squid Girl is an extraterrestrial being, who they are naturally very eager to learn more about, however they can. These three are the only part of the show that can get a little bit grating on occasion; their shtick outstay its welcome pretty quick. They're not horrible, and the only reason I feel the need to point this out is because it contrasts so strongly with the rest of the show, which is consistently hilarious throughout the series' 12-episode run.

I'd be remiss to leave out how cute the show can be, Squid Girl in particular is incredibly charming and moe. It never feels like the show is pushing its cuteness on you, it just naturally emerges. Even more importantly, with the exception of the small mini-Squid segments, the cuteness never compromises the humor. The two work in tandem, and the show is very good about keeping the focus on the delivery of the jokes' punchlines/payoffs.

Visually, the show has a charming esthetic, with round and fairly simple faces, warm colors and a great sea-side setting that lends itself well to that summer feel. The animation serves the show well, while never being dazzling, it doesn't need to be either; this being a comedy through and through. The soundtrack is much the same, serving its role well, but not blowing you away enough to make a strong lasting impact. The opening and ending, however, are standouts and really set the tone for the show. The opening is energetic and insanely catchy; you won't want to skip it, no matter how much you want to get on with the episode. The ending is exactly opposite, being very calming and relaxing. There are usually some episode-specific changes to the ending animation, so you might want to stick around and check those out; might put a little smile on your face.

The bottom line is this: Squid Girl is very, very funny. It excels as a comedy, and makes you care about the characters along the way. The setting is unique and fun, and Squid Girl naturally steals the show. Pick this up if you're tired of the dozens of anime comedies set in high schools, want something cute, light and charming or just a plain ol' funny comedy.

Let's hope Media Blasters comes through with the release of the second season!",1346803200,2,3643,4.78537360890302
8504712,4,B006UTDGDS,the show is all right it is funny and have a lot of jokes about fish. I would say it is a good show to get or atless see,1344384000,,120,3.1724137931034484
8504713,5,B006UTDGDS,"Squid Girl is a series about, well... a girl who's a squid who comes to invade the surface world, as retribution for polluting the oceans, in order to conquer humanity. Except, she encounters many problems while trying to accomplish her goal. The series as a whole is very entertaining with great comedy; the script is filled with ocean puns, and the characters are easy to like, with each having their own quirks. It's hard to not like Squid Girl herself as she's genuinely naive to the world around her, and often gets picked on by the humans she encounters.

As with the DVDs there is both English and Japanese audio available with English subtitles for the script or songs/signs. Both the English and Japanese voice acting performances are enjoyable, and really well done. I find watching it in either language to be just as comedic and entertaining. If you're looking for a lighthearted comedy series, then you won't be disappointed with Squid Girl.

What makes this release special is that it's presented on Blu-ray disc in full 1080P with lossless DTS-HD Master Audio. It comes on 2 discs in a single Blu-ray case, and includes the full series with all of the bonuses that were featured on the DVD sets. The cover image is different than what was originally pictured, in that it's not a plain white and blue background, and instead has a beach look to coincide with the series and the previous DVD sets. The fans asked for this series to be released on Blu-ray, and Media Blasters responded! I am glad that they were able to produce this release for the fans, and I look forward to them bringing over Season 2 for us as well, considering how good of a job they did on the first season.",1335916800,21,1692,4.617940199335548
