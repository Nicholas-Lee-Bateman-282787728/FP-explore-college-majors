1725518,2,B000068MBI,"As more and more movies get made, the quest to do something different becomes more of a challenge. And if a movie is called predictable that's generally seen as a put-down. But of all the hit-and-miss efforts to make something that won't incur that label, some make good old tried-and-true formulae and predictability look not so bad by comparison. One device that can invite a misfire that would make predictability look better is that of twist endings. A few years ago, PRIMAL FEAR was the first movie in which a twist ending made me feel cheated out of the very movie premise I had bought into. I just invested too much energy into the body of the movie taken at face value. Then when the ending turned all that on its head, I felt that the heart of my movie-going experience was jerked out from under me. The same didn't happen again for a while, but just recently, the phenomenon seems back with a vengeance. With FRAILTY, MURDER BY NUMBERS, and now HIGH CRIMES, movies have got me really on overload with the ending that says, ""And now we're going to undermine you're whole movie experience that you just underwent."" It has me really nostalgic for many a good old fashioned formulaic and predictable thriller where I can pull for the good guys and in the end they -- are at least still the good guys.",1027641600,4,1306,4.538135593220339
1725519,5,B000068MBI,"This movie took me by surprise.  I was expecting a standard Hollywood crap-a-thon, but instead, I got a brilliantly acted, sharply directed and tightly written bullet of a thriller.  By far the most exciting movie so far this year ...  The DVD has the director's commentary -- should be interesting.  Definitely a buy.",1026000000,,318,4.943396226415095
1725520,2,B000068MBI,"Beside the critically praised ""Devil in a Blue Dress,"" Carl Franklin's ""High Crimes"" looks inferior in every respect -- story, predictable; characters, unmemorable, and even acting itself on the side of reliable Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman, not-so-impressive as the hitman Don Cheadle in the former.  In a word, this film is a great disappointment.
The plot is about a first-rate lawyer Claire Kubik (Judd) whose life changes out of the blue when her beloved husband is arrested on the street of San Fransico by FBI.  Her love Jim Caviezel, it is claimed, is in fact an ex-marine who is once charged for killing innocent civilians during the mission in El Salvador.  Claire stands up for her husband, now in unfamiliar territory of military court, with a help from Morgan Freeman's laywer Grimes, but she soon finds out that ""Everything You trust, Everything You Know, May be a Lie,"" as the tugline of the film goes.
The film treads on every clithed method of spending time, like some made-for-TV thriller, and practically what it shows on the screen is only the basics of story without any added skills or flavor.  There is no time for us to be drawn into this too rudimentary storyline, as we only observe the progress of the ""case,"" which is too busy to explain itself before the audience.  The ""by the number"" fashion of unfolding the story is too painful to watch for all the good cast thrown in this film.
If you think my review too unkind, compare this with such works as ""Rules of Engagement"" by William Friedkin.  The latter is a  flawed film, but knows how to generate tension of the war, make the audience fell the need for the characters to regain their  lost dignity, and most of all, the atomosphere of the court scenes, which are sadly lacking in ""High Crimes.""  Surely we are told here that in the military world, it is not ""judge"", but ""investigating officier""; it is not ""jury"", but ""members.""  However, this image of rigid, strict, by-the-book authority of the marine is not fully developed, and the case ends somehow in a disappointing way.  Like this (at first) promising sides of the film, many things pop up in the film, only to be wasted in a half-baked way; we see romance, we see war; we see the court; we see Amanda Peet as a vivacious sister of Clair, but none of them work, probably because of the pointless development of them.
Freeman shows unexpected comical side with his acting as a down-and-out lawyer, and Judd herself is good (but often painful to watch, again after ""Kiss the Girls"") but those two cannot save the too routine storytelling of the film.  Even the location of San Fransisco and its dry, moody picture cannot help much in this low patches of ""High Crimes""",1024704000,3,2709,4.68

1725556,5,B000068MBI,"AND PAR IS """"""""""EXCELLENT"""""""""""""" OR """"""""""ABOVE THE GRAIN""""""""""""

THIS MOVIE WAS LIKE JAZZ AND THE BLUES, AND CLASSICAL AND POPULAR....ALL AT THE SAME CONCERT.
It was like salty and loving and sexy and full of love and desire,  all in one.
I mean who wants to love a '''''killer of women and children''''''?
(I ached for her.  I really did.  I loved the husband's performance.  Just loved it.)
It's like any woman, or every woman, who tremendously loves her husband and is very proud of her husband......my,my, my!
But then....she does not know his past.  She has to learn his past but it is so hard...so hard to get to it.
All you want is for it to all end and you are left alone with your husband to make the baby you want.... to make the love perfect.
BUT...the tables keep turning from bitter to sweet....

YES....this is an excellent movie: excellent, exciting, and a very mysterious script.  I will watch it again and again.
Give a wife a break!  It takes a long time for her to re-register her love inside for him to hate and despising.
She has to go from totally '''captured''' by this man to hating his guts, which she never does get to that level.
(I don't think.)  That's why I think THIS fact of life is worth mentioning.

1725572,5,B000068MBI,"High Crimes is the best crime drama that I have seen in a very long time, arguably the best ever. The plot is good and moves along at a quick pace, it is realistic, and every actor in the film does a very fine job. If I hadn't read and enjoyed the book, I would have been surprised at the film's ending. I highly recommend seeing this film.
The plot focuses on a very loving couple. Everything is going just right for them. Then, suddenly, the husband is arrested and charged with the murder of civilians during an army action. The wife did not know he had been in the army. She knew him under one name, but soon discovers that this is not his real name. He is tried in a military court. The wife, although a superb lawyer, knows nothing about the procedures in a military trial. A young lieutenant, with no real experience, is assigned to represent the husband. The prosecuting attorney is the best in his field. The judge is unconcerned with how he conducts the trial because he is about to retire.
The wife decides she must help her husband, but she needs the aid of an ex-military man who is a very good lawyer who also knows the system. She finds someone who fits the bill, but he is, or perhaps better said ""was,"" a drunk, sober for only a year.
It soon becomes clear that the military wants the court to find the husband guilty. Even worse, soldiers harass and harm the pregnant wife and even cause her to lose her baby when they bang into her car and turn it over. The man the wife chose to aid her is brutally beaten.",1479427200,,1526,4.26551724137931

Info for possible concerns viewers might have:  There is no blood/gore.  No strong language whatsoever.  No violence, to speak of.  No military jargon a civilian might not understand.

1725718,3,B000068MBI,"""High Crimes"" rates pretty well as a thriller. The plot contains many conflicting and mysterious motives, and the events drive the viewer into widely varying suspicions and significant uncertainty. The dramatic events throughout provide a good level of tension. The military is portrayed as unremittingly and unpardonably protecting its sins from the public. The acting is credible. The ending isn't bad, though Claire's rapid recovery from her many traumas was nothing short of miraculous. My main objection to the plot is that, after the twist, many of the events that occurred earlier in the film seem to be poorly motivated and unrealistic. PG-13 rating is not far off.",1454371200,,673,5.2407407407407405

It is an interesting film, even though it is a bit dated. The film is advertised as having a twist, which meant I knew the ending, just not how we get there. Good performances.

This is a story about Claire Kubik, a woman criminal defense lawyer. Her house was burglarized, she calls the police. The police test the fingerprints and arrest her husband Tom! For what? They are not allowed to tell her. It is secret and confidential. She goes to a military base to talk to Ron Chapman, her husbands real name. He is accused of something he didn't do, he says. The Marines supply a defense lawyer. Claire is shocked by all these charges. A murder charge will result in the death penalty. Will he get a good defense lawyer? Years ago three American tourists were killed by a bomb. Marines were sent to a small village to hunt for the terrorists. One Major shot nine villages, the Brigadier General backed him. When Tom Kubik objected he was framed for the murders.

Claire Kubik seeks an experienced military lawyer, Charles Grimes. He was retired due to an indiscretion. Claires sister is moving in, she was ejected from her apartment. Grimes asks for a public trial, as per the Sixth Amendment. There is a problem: five of the seven witnesses are now dead! Major Waldron calls to suggest a deal - one count of manslaughter. Tom says he will be killed in prison to silence him: no deals. Later an intruder invades Claires home to threaten her and her sister! Tom takes a lie detector test to prove his innocence to Claire. The Court-Martial continues. The Colonel is caught in a mis-statement. A stranger gives Claire a message in a grocery store. Can anyone beat the box? They say so. Charlie Grimes visits a bar only to be worked over by men in civilian clothes.

How did those men know about the polygraph test? Will one witness be tracked down after he was released from jail? Grimes does this and uses a ruse to talk to him. He makes an admission about the crime. A man in a parked car watches Claire return home! That tape is played for the judge; he excludes the recording! Claire files an appeal. Grimes finds a bug on her telephone line. [That explains how they knew what was discussed.] Mrs. Kubik meets General Marks, he rejects her and walks away. Claire meets reporters, her comments are on the news. A strange man talks to her and takes her for a ride. He tells what really happened.

Claire returns, when she drives she has an auto accident! Grimes suggests a check on the insurance reports for one witness (for an injury). She asks General Marks to make the charges go away. The next day there is a surprise. The charges against Sergeant Chapman are withdrawn! They avoid the reporters at their home, and plan a vacation in Mexico. A widow tells Grimes about the death of her husband. He asks Claire about her husbands whereabouts. [A new complication?] Her husband Tom returns. Did he do it? Its what he was trained to do. Claire runs away but Tom catches her. There is a surprise and more action! [Can you believe it?] There is a new development. Grimes and Garibaldi? [Note the smog in the background.]

This is an interesting and dramatic story as long as you don't question some of its assumptions. I do, and consider is average.",1432771200,,3093,4.575812274368231

1725776,4,B000068MBI,"High Crimes is a thriller film based on a novel by Joseph Finder.

Defense attorney Claire Kubik seems to have the perfect life. She has a high profile job at a big firm, a beautiful home outside San Francisco, and a husband, Tom, who loves her. Claire's biggest problem appears to be that she wants to have a baby, and she's having trouble getting pregnant. But when the police investigate a routine break-in at her home, they uncover the truth about her husband's identity, and her life is thrown into turmoil. Claire finds out that her husband's name is actually Ron Chapman, and that he's an ex-marine accused of murdering seven innocent civilians in El Salvador during a raid in the late '80s. He admits that he was there, and that he changed his identity to escape prosecution for the crimes, but he insists that he's innocent, and that the massacre was committed by another soldier under the orders of a powerful general, who is using Ron as a patsy to cover it up. Claire is eventually convinced that Ron's telling the truth. Faced with defending her husband in an unfamiliar military courtroom, Claire enlists the aid of Charles Grimes, an ex-Army judge advocate with an ax to grind. Stonewalled by the military bureaucracy at every turn, they uncover a web of deception and disappearing witnesses, and they soon find their own lives in danger.

The movie starts out as taut and intriguing story but seems to get more clichd and predictable as it goes on. It has its fair share of decent courtroom scenes but the legal tussles are far better than the emotional ones. But nevertheless,it becomes fun and entertaining due to the performances of Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman.",1428451200,,1683,4.760273972602739

1725816,5,B000068MBI,"Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman were 'Outstanding' in Acting Performance. In fact, as a team in other movies and this one included, they were Fantastic. 'High Crimes' delivers an engaging, heartfelt, and thrilling story that entertains right up to the Surprise ending! I viewed this movie several times, and it had me fooled with the chilling twist at the end.

Ashley Judd plays the role of a noted, top-notch attorney with a good reputation. She is also the faithful, loving, devoted wife to her husband, who was accused and arrested for a brutal military murder. Nothing can get in her way, despite all the threats on her life, to defend her husband, and prove his innocence. However, she needs help, because military attorneys and laws are new to outside lawyers. This is where Morgan Freeman comes in, when she seeks his help. He's a brilliant attorney, and an expert on military law. But, there's one problem. Can he stay off the booze, and clean-up his act long enough to pull through for this murder case?

He comes through, like a shining star. More important, he did everything to find out the truth, regardless of threats on his life. This fast-paced thriller moves like a bullet, and ends with an explosive bang. This movie had incredible twists-and-turns, grabbed your attention in the beginning, and had you mesmerized until the end. At times, there were edge-of-your-seat suspense, good action and emotional moments, such as when Claire lost her first baby after a car accident. Chilling, Thrilling, and suspenseful.

It might have indeed been Judd and Freeman's ""best production to date"", but that unfortunately doesn't mean it's good. This was like another book-to-movie production that pulls the audience's strings based on its current anxieties. Ashley Judd's character desperately wants to conceive a child and is all but wrecking her marriage in the effort. But guess what! Her all-American former military husband is potentially a raging psycho. Will she survive once she begins to dig? So junky. So predictable. Ho hum script, suggesting a manufactured best seller.

1725843,4,B000068MBI,"Okay, there should be a law that says that Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman are required to do a film together at least every eighteen months.  I know they have a number of collaborations under their belts, but more are needed.  Come on, people!  Get on this!  Anyway, in this installment of this fine partnership, Ashley Judd plays a woman/lawyer who's husband is suddenly arrested and revealed to be a wanted war criminal living under an assumed name.  Believing the pleas of innocence coming from the man who's real name she's only just learned, Jud recruits Morgan Freeman to help her navigate the inner workings of a military court, where the ballgame is quite different from the civilian courts.  Okay, so the first half of this film was great and interesting...but then it began to get crazy with conspiracies and cover-ups that just served to confuse me.  Personally, I'm never really a fan of these sorts of things which end up including factors like ""how high up the conspiracy reaches within the organization"" and ""who is left to trust"".  Also, the ending felt like one big cop out.  Did someone just read the script halfway through production and realize the original ending just wouldn't work given everything else that had already been thrown in?  It almost made the movie redundant.  I know this is based on a novel, and I will probably read that novel just to see if the ending's the same.  Maybe it works better on paper, but it just didn't do it for me in this film.  I do recommend it because Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman are awesome regardless.  They are just always worth watching.  And I have to admit, after the cop out ending, their final scene together is amusing, even if it is just a bit clich...again, they make it work so well.  Enjoy.",1402876800,,1764,4.641935483870967

I love Morgan Freeman and also love Ashley Judd but honestly didn't think I was going to love the subject matter....I was completely surprised.

She doubts his military-assigned defense attorney, Adam Scott, is up to the challenge, so assigns herself to the case and also recruits former marine attorney Morgan Freeman.

She and Freeman encounter several instances of violence supposedly perpetrated by higher-ups in the marines - stretching one's credulity.

Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd, especially in the two ""Alex Cross"" character movies fall into that category.  The story, to be sure, is first rate - and the twists and turns are deliciously entertaining - but without the deliver of these two fine actors, some of the story's ""edge"" may have been lost.  Also there are no ""love scenes"" between them - only an emerging mutual high regard and sincere respect for the essence of each of the characters portrayed.

The film follows a loving couple who are thrust into turmoil when the husband is accused of an atrocity thirteen years prior and is brought before military court.  His wife, a lawyer, is convinced of her husband's innocence and is determined to prove it.  `High Crimes' is a tad standard in its direction, never really pushing any envelopes and so you won't feel like this is a truly inspired piece of filmmaking, but it is remarkably solid in what it is trying to get across.  Morgan Freeman is adequate, although he seems to be stuck in a particular performance that he regurgitates time and time again, and the scenes with Michael Shannon are somewhat unsettled in the flow of the film.

Starring Ashley Judd as a high-profile defense attorney who is trying to conceive a child with her husband, James Caviezel, all seems well at first.  Then, suddenly, her husband is arrested by the FBI and he is accused of a massacre in a Latin American village while he was a marine several years before.  Immediately, she tries to defend him, even moving to the southern city where his trial will be held.  Everything seems against him but she, and the viewers, all presume his innocence.  He seems to be persecuted unjustly with a government conspiracy against him.  And even Ms. Judd's competent legal skills can't seem to save him.

Enter Morgan Freeman as a experienced former military attorney.  He's been in disgrace for a while because of his alcoholism but he seems to be reformed and is brilliant in the courtroom where he helps Ms. Judd defend her husband.  The plot moves swiftly and it kept me on the edge of my seat.  All of the actors were excellent.  There are good guys and bad guys.  And the conspiracy against James Caviezel seems awful. But the plot twists and turns.  The viewer starts to wonder what, exactly is the truth.  And the climax is startling and unexpected.

1725928,5,B000068MBI,"Because Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman are so comfortable working together you find yourself simply enjoying the ride in director Carl Franklin's glossy suspense thriller. Very entertaining, beautifully photographed, and with two leads easy to like, this is Hollywood entertainment at its best. It receives high marks for doing what it was designed to do.

Claire (Ashley Judd) has a nice life as this film opens. A defense attorney for a respected law firm in lovely San Francisco, she and her husband Ron are trying to start a family. But when she finds herself face down on the street while her husband is taken in to police custody, who claim he is someone else, Claire's world begins to crumble. Judd does a nice job showing the mix of conflicting emotions as everything she thought she knew about her husband goes out the window. Her husband is charged with the murder of civilians in El Salvador while in uniform, and will be given a military trial. Claire believes in his innocence and when he is assigned a green 1st. Lieutenent (Adam Scott) to defend him, she knows he needs help.

Enter Morgan Freeman as Charlie Grimes. He's been sober for over a year, and his sharp wit and knowledge of a military courtroom remain in tact. The chemistry between Freeman and Judd is as comfortable as our favorite old pair of jeans, allowing us to sit back and enjoy the story, without scrutinizing every plot point. The closer they get to what really happened and the cover up that goes all the way to the top, the more dangerous it becomes for them. Even when evidence they uncover is used as a bargaining chip to have the charges dropped, all is not well. Charlie has discovered something about the case in Mexico that will shed a bright light on the truth.

Adapted from a Joseph Finder novel, this is sparkling entertainment. A very enjoyable last few moments leaves the viewer wanting more of Judd and Freeman working together. Amanda Peet also gives a fine performance as Claire's free-spirited sister, Jackie. We may have been here before but Judd and Freeman take us through the paces so deftly that we can't help but enjoy the journey. This is a good film which entertains exactly as it was made to.",1270857600,2,2205,4.69250645994832

kind of movie, that will keep you on the edge of your seat for
most of the picture, until the very end, notwithstanding some
jaded and defeatist comments seen elsewhere on this site from
other movie goers.

The military tribunal, and the portrayal of military life, mility
justice and those who work in that industry - as living in a
significantly differnet world than the civilian one - is
accurate. Obviously, anyone having done basic training will
recall the indoctrination, team values, hard work, dedication and
focus that those joining it are expected to incorporate into
themselves, that some might also call, brainwashing or hazing.

In this movie, James Caviezel plays a character that is difficult
to discern, as a good guy or bad guy...he keeps the audience
guessing until the very end. Most will fail to recognize him, as
Mel Gibson's Jesus, as I did, certainly.

The weak spot of this movie, are 1 or 2 special effects and
action scenes, .. such as when the SUV is pushed over the side of
the highway, and flips over. The vehicle didn't seem to have the
natural momentum to flip, and this is later shown accurate in the
extras part of the DVD, which shows wires pulling the SUV to one
side, digitally manipulated afterwards to hide those wires from
the viewers. Others effects and scene and better filmed, such as
the scene in the street, with the SWAT team.

All in all, this movie, with Morgan Freeman bringing his
credibility to it, and Ashley Judd showing her dynamic and
articulate presence, is not to be underestimated, considering
that it will impact the mind of the viewers with a strong and
remarkably powerful artistic statement.",1270166400,,1718,4.793918918918919

1725943,2,B000068MBI,"THE CASE: High Crimes begins with grainy footage of a bunch of bodies lined up in a grungy town, while an elderly woman wails over and over.  We flash back to the happy marriage of Claire (Ashley Judd) and Tom Kubik (James Caviezel) who are trying to start a family.  She's a successful lawyer; he's a successful Marine.  Their life is disrupted by a break-in by some punks.

In a trend that is highly representative of the disjointed plotline of High Crimes, Tom is suddenly arrested.  Tom's name is actually Sergeant Ron Chapman, and he is wanted for the execution of a bunch of people in another country. But Tom/Ron proclaims his innocence, complicated by the fact that Claire is pregnant.

So Claire buckles down.  She decides to stand by her man and act as counsel on the case after meeting Ron's defense, Lieutenant Terrence Embry (Adam Scott), a newbie for sure.  Claire's not dumb; she knows she needs help.  She pulls in Dr. Alex Cross...I mean Charles W. Grimes, played by Morgan Freeman.  Complicating things is Jackie (Amanda Peet), Claire's sister.

I'm bringing High Crimes up on charges of opaque plot points, awful stereotypes, and worst of all, just being plain boring.  The charges are as follows:

HIGH CRIME #1: Using Grimes' alcoholism for laughs.  It's not funny and it's insulting to alcoholics.

HIGH CRIME #2: Portraying the Marines as bloodthirsty, incompetent thugs who terrorize women and the downtrodden. It's offensive to just about everyone in the armed forces.

HIGH CRIME #3: The Jackie character doesn't need to be in the movie. Peet's sole purpose is apparently to walk around in underwear so that Judd doesn't have to.

HIGH CRIME #4: Idiotic clues.  Ambidextrous people do NOT all throw things back and forth in their hands; that is certainly not indicative of a person being a criminal.  Worse, in the flashback sequences, the main bad guy tosses an AK-47 (not an easy weapon to toss around) back and forth in his hands.  All to demonstrate he's ambidextrous and therefore the killer.

HIGH CRIME #5: A long, drawn-out (115 minute) plot with a depressing conclusion that doesn't make up for any of the nonsense we had to put up with to get to the end.

LESSER CHARGES: Unbelievable plot points (a civilian lawyer defending her military husband?), choppy editing (what does the break-in have to do with anything?), cheesy music that telegraphs When Bad Things Are About to Happen (TM), characters that appear out of nowhere and then disappear until conveniently needed, and really stupid terror tactics by the shadowy bad guys.

In El Salvador, she is givne the wrong information and she uses touch tactics with the government lawyer to expose the whole covert operation (so like the Green Berets in Vietnam) which gives her client the edge so as not to make the U. S. Marines look bad.  She pays dearly for this mistake.

This whole film was Ashley Judd, and she just was not capable of carrying the show.  Making the alcoholic attorney with a suite of offices in a yellow adobe in Mexico appear incompetent was a bummer.

1725951,4,B000068MBI,"Joseph Finder's bestselling novel comes to life in this well-made, though somewhat predictable, thriller as a savvy and love-struck lawyer is pitted against the military and its covert actions.  Ashley Judd plays Claire Kubik, a lawyer on the way to a partnership until her husband is arrested for a military crime he swears he didn't commit.  To defend him, Claire must navigate military law and threats, getting in deeper and more dangerously with every half-truth she uncovers.
The plot has fewer holes than most thrillers, although most viewers will see the ""twist"" a mile away.  And that a law firm would jettison one of its promising stars because her husband was arrested is preposterous.  Wouldn't they help in the defense?  Still, given the holes in most thrillers these days, these lapses are minor.  The acting is solid, with Judd creating a gutsy, smart woman who is capable of both unfaltering love and fury.  Morgan Freeman does a fine job with his thin material as a once-alcoholic lawyer who is ""a thorn in the military's side.""  James Caveziel, as Claire's husband, is less complex; his pleading got on my nerves by the end.  Supporting roles by Amanda Peet (Claire's floozy sister) and Adam Smith (a young military lawyer) are adequate, though not highly memorable.
The strength of this film is in the pacing and the seamless way in which it unfolds.

Ashley Judd plays Claire Kubik, who discovers that her husband isn't who he says he is, and then has to confront her own doubts as she tries to save his life.
Morgan Freeman is the recovering alcoholic, former military attorney, who decides to help her out and keep off the juice.

Bruce Davison's small role as the big shot general, is coldly efficient.

The film is about Claire Kubik(Judd) whose husband is being accused of murder. With the help of Charles Grimes (Freeman),Lt.

The plot twists are just like ""The Recruit"" in a way,except this movie was made first.

The story is semi-interesting, but is nothing you haven't seen in a Lifetime movie, and it makes you wonder why the two leads signed onto this project at all, other than the chance to work together again.

1725961,4,B000068MBI,"""High Crimes"" was one of those movies that just started pushing the wrong buttons on me, which surprised me because usually any film with Morgan Freeman in it is going to be a safe bet.  The man is one of the finest actors around and his playing God in the new Jim Carey movie would probably be considered typecasting by everyone who has worked with him.  But I am not going to blame him for why I got on the wrong side of this movie, nor am I going to point a finger at screenwriters Yuri Zeltser and Cary Bickley, becaue I am pretty sure the objectionable elements were in the original novel by Joseph Finder.

Freeman is paired with Ashley Judd in this 2002 film, five years after they worked together in ""Kiss the Girls.""  However, this time Judd does the heavy lifting and the basic premise is quite compelling.  Judd plays Claire Kubik, a defense attorney whose is about to make partner at a big law firm.  Life is good.  But then her husband is arrested by the FBI and changed with having murdered civilians is El Salvador when he was in the Army.  That is only half the shock, because Claire also finds out that he married her under an assumed name.  Her husband is going to be court-martialed for the massacre and if found guilty he will be sentenced to death.  But when she sees the young first lieutenant (Adam Scott) assigned to defend the case, she makes herself co-counsel, and, to help her understand the playing field, she tracks down Charlie Grimes (Freeman), an ex-military lawyer and recovering alcoholic.

The character's alcoholism is one of the aforementioned buttons, because of course the sobriety of Grimes comes into play.  I will grant that the situation is contrived well in terms of the plot, but contrivance becomes the key word to describe this plot element.  The net benefit is a mild sense of concern because, well, Grimes is played by Morgan Freeman and is clearly a good guy.  The other button that gets pushed is that ""High Crimes"" is another one of these films were the United States military is portrayed as being psychopathic killers.  Not only that, they are INCOMPETENCE psychopathic killers.  Claire's husband claims somebody else is to blame and that there is a conspiracy going on and eventually she starts getting too close to the truth and shadowy figures try to take care of her in a way that is ultimately guaranteed to shine even more publicity on this case.  Fortunately, some of the shadowy figures are on Claire's side.

I want to point out that my disdain for the U.S. military being portrayed as incompetent psychopathic killers existed long before the war to liberate Iraq.  Just as I got tired of villains turning out to be Nazis and drug crazed Vietnam vets, I am already tired of villains being ultra-right military men whose ideological beliefs overwhelms their professionalism and sense of morality.  Claire's husband says the real killer is a guy named Hernandez (Juan Carlos Hernndez), now a Major, who looks brazenly homicidal.  But the military is covering things up apparently, so it is not a big deal.

Judd's performance is what hold the movie together on these terms.  She might be questioning everything her husband ever told her since the day they met but in the courtroom here legal instincts take over.  Every motion she makes might be denied, but she knows how to dissect witnesses with a nice combination of sharp questions and pointed attitude.  This is one of those films where it ain't over until its over, so I was ticked off, but I was also entertained, so if you have different buttons than I do you will obviously enjoy this film more than I did.  Also, a tip of the hat to Tom Bower as FBI Special Agent Mullins, who gets off some nice shots during a scene with Claire on a park bench; always nice to see a veteran actor milk his little scene for everything it is worth.",1053734400,,3852,4.619676945668135
1725962,5,B000068MBI,"""High Crimes"" finds Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman reunited and they make a truly brilliant team. Judd plays a young lawyer whose husband finds himself taken down by FBI agents while out Christmas shopping in San Francisco. The crime? Murder.
He swears he didn't do it and Judd trusts him because she knows her own husband. Or does she? Judd finds herself on a marine base in southern California defending her husband on murder charges in a military courtroom. She finds that the laws are a little different when it comes to the military. She decides she needs to get an ace military lawyer who can help her to defend the man she loves.
In come Freeman who plays an ex-military lawyer who just happens to be a drunk. He's been clean and sober for quite a while but it doesn't take long for things to spin out of control in this story of deceit and suprise twists.
I'll be honest and say that I didn't see what happened in the last few minutes of the film coming. This film will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.

1725963,3,B000068MBI,"High Crimes is a drama, centered around the efforts of San Francisco based lawyer Claire Kubik (Ashley Judd) to vindicate her ex-marine husband Tom (James Caviezel), who is charged with the murder of some villagers, while on a mission in El Salvador, twelve years previous.  Husband Tom, (real name Ron) was a member of a small unit, sent to ferret out a terrorist.  Though what actually happened is in dispute, the end result was nine dead civilians killed by Marine fire.
Charged with ""high crimes"", Tom is held for trial in a USMC base in San Lazaro, CA.  His appointed counsel is green Marine lawyer, Lt. Embry (Adam Scott).  Claire joins the defense team, but seeks someone with expertise in military procedures to bolster the team.  Enter ""wild card"" Charlie Grimes, (Morgan Freeman) a civilian lawyer with past JAG experience.  Together, along with Claire's sister, Jackie (Amanda Peet), the defense team works to uncover the ""truth"".
Freeman and Judd star in their second film together, having first worked together in 1998's ""Kiss the Girls"".  And indeed, it is the interplay between the two that creates most of the interest in the story.  However, this alone is not enough, and the illogical plot twists added to create excitement and maintain interest, produce a rather formulamatic tale, that ultimately leaves one disappointed.  Freeman's performance is steady, but not special.  Judd does an excellent job displaying a wide range of emotions.  Yet neither can overcome the weakness of the story.
Director Carl Franklin's commentary track, provides a wealth of trivia, and too often he tends to speak of his other films and filmmaking in general rather than comment specifically on what we are seeing.

1725965,2,B000068MBI,"Disappointing courtroom thriller has an excellent Ashley Judd capitalizing on her success two years earlier in Double Jeopardy. She plays a successful attorney married to a really nice guy (Jim Caviezel) who has no particular occupation except to attempt to impregnate her in the mornings and then work in the toolshed for the rest of the day. She discovers that he actually has a past when the FBI take him into custody and accuse him of a war crime involving the murder of innocent El Salvadoran civilians that he supposedly committed when he was still a marine (and had a different name). Judd, completely perplexed and unsure of who's she even married to at this point, decides to go with her gut instinct anyway and appoints herself her husband's attorney along with the green novice (Adam Scott) they've already given him, and to make sure she fully can comprehend military law enlists the help of a wild-card washed up ex-alcoholic lawyer (Morgan Freeman, Judd's costar from the 1997 thriller Kiss The Girls). Despite the annoying setbacks (the lame subplot involving Amanda Peet as Judd's irresponsible younger sister, not to mention cloying scenes like Caviezel insisting he and his wife get it on in the lie-detector test room because *wink wink* no one's looking), the majority of the film's running plot is actually quite involving: twists and turns and incredible complications kept me riveted to the screen, desperate to find out how Judd would get herself and her family out of this incredible mess. Plus the film benefits from genuine chemistry between the lady heroine and Freeman, their characters written a slight cut above the usual Determined with a capital D freedom fighters you get in these kinds of films. Director Carl Franklin is obviously interested in making something more than just the average Hollywood thriller, something apparent from his more imaginative camera angles and editing techniques, but the film eventually takes an obvious turn in its third act that in itself reveals the film's climactic finale before it even happens, and you're left with an empty feeling like you've seen it all before.

So Judd goes on her mission to prove her husband's innocence, and Morgan Freeman and Adam Scott desperately try to save this movie from being the Hallmark thriller of the week.

1725979,4,B000068MBI,"The primary reason to see this film is the terrific acting by an ensemble cast composed of Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, Jim Cavieze, and Amanda Peet. We are treated to a snapshot view of Ashley and Jim living a outrageously happy life together until suddenly and inexplicably it is shattered by his arrest for crimes committed years ago as a special forces operative in Central America under a different name, from which it appears he had been fleeing for decades. What evolves is another standard jostling of criminal minds, both offenders and lawyers, as well as those of darker forces who seem determined to railroad Jim character for reasons not immediately apparent.
Yet Ashley's character is hardly defeated. Given the fact she happens to be a skilled defense lawyer, she enlists the support of Morgan Freeman, a man once known for his legal expertise but now sidelined by bouts with the bottle. He becomes the lynchpin in the defense efforts to unravel the mystery behind the scenes in order to save Ashley's husband from conviction.  It is entertaining to watch freeman and Judd play off each other, in this, their second outing together (""Kiss The Girls""). Each is a consummate dramatic actor in his or her own right, and the way they use each other to lend credence and gravity to a scene is marvelous to watch.
Cavieze is also quite good, a convincing straight man who lies so well even the audience cannot tell when he is doing so. The supporting cast is also quite good, and one finds the time flying by, always an indication that the script and performances are working well.  The plot is too traditional, and fairly predictable at that, yet the characters woven by the cast catch one up into the fantasy nonetheless, and what results is an altogether enjoyable and entertaining movie experience.

I started watching it not really expecting anything out of it and a boring two hours but boy was I wrong. I really liked it and the movie was very entertaining. I never really liked Morgan Freeman but I really thought he was good in this movie. I loved how they combined drama,suspense,and to make it even better they stuck in a joke here and there to losen the mood. It made the movie worth watching and I will buy the DVD soon.
The movie's ending was very unexpected because once you think that the movie is going to end it doesn't and they continue going with the idea. Ashley Judd's acting was perfect for her role as a desprete wife trying to prove that her husband is innocent. Morgan Freeman was good playing a lawyer who was a recent alcoholic.
The plot was about a couple who was married. Tom Kubrek(Jim Casedriel)and Claire Kubrek(Ashley Judd)are trying to have a baby and there whole life is perfect untill one night they go for a walk and the FBI show up. They saw that Tom's name is really a man named Ron who was in the milatary years ago where his team says he shot 9 people somewhere in Spain.

She finds Charlie Grimes, a down-and-out recovering alcoholic who has been booted out of the Marines himself for conduct unbecoming an officer (he slept with his superior's wife).  Together, Claire and Charlie pursue the tangled and twisted trail of secrets while up against a literal army of men who will only stop short of killing them.  One secret leads to another, and soon the incident that prompted Tom's arrest is much larger, capable of bringing down a military general and causing more murders.
Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman acted together in KISS THE GIRLS, the first Alex Cross novel by best-selling author James Patterson to be filmed.  Judd has also starred in DEVINE SECRETS OF THE YA-YA SISTERHOOD, WHERE THE HEART IS, EYE OF THE BEHOLDER, DOUBLE JEOPADY, and is slated to star in CATWOMAN, a movie about the costumed superhero.  Freeman has starred in THE SUM OF ALL FEARS, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, ALONG CAME A SPIDER, DEEP IMPACT, HARD RAIN, and CHAIN REACTION.  The director, Carl Franklin, has directed ONE FALSE MOVE, NOWHERE TO RUN, and DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS.
Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman are excellent in their craft and those skills come to the forefront in HIGH CRIMES.  Judd stars as a very successful attorney with a corner office in a big firm and comes across dynamically in that role.  She knows how to stage a power play and how to be the debutante at a large social event.  At the other end of the spectrum, she also knows how to play the victim (after she's attacked by masked invaders) and the frightened wife (when she first learns of her husband's arrest, and again when she realizes that she really doesn't know her husband well).  Freeman plays seedy recovering alcoholic attorney Charlie Grimes to a tee, then smoothly steps into the role of an experienced trial attorney facing the double-barreled threat of the military court.  The action in the movies comes across smartly paced, moving through the progression of things getting worse and worse, while at the same time the twists and turns the plot takes leaves the watcher uncertain who to trust and exactly how much that person can be trusted.  Both Freeman and Judd's characters have important driving missions to accomplish, but Judd manages to steal the show several times, due in part to the script and in part because she is a fantastic actress.  All of the plot points are developed, and every character in the film is a worthwhile investment for the watcher.  Everyone is under the microscope in this thriller, and that's exactly how it should be.  The additional materials included on the DVD include an interview with the author of the book, HIGH CRIMES, on which the movie was based that is a very good piece, showing the difference between the movie and the book.  An interesting note is that Joseph Finder also had a cameo in the movie-with his head shaved.  Another featurette covers the differences between civilian and military courts that is an excellent presentation.
As good as this movie was, there were a couple issues that got glossed over.  After fourteen years passed, why would the Marines be so concerned over Chapman's story that they would break even more laws by intimidating and then trying to kill Claire Kubik?  Also, not all of the movie's villains get the comeuppance they so richly deserved.  At the finale, though it seems impossible, Freeman and Judd should have been together to face the end together.
Fans of Judd's and Freeman's work on KISS THE GIRLS will want to add this gem of a thriller movie to their personal collection.  People who want a relatively bloodless edge-of-the-seat thriller with a rock-solid mystery will want to see this one.  Definitely worth an evening's entertainment for legal film fans or for a couple wanting a his-and-her movie that delivers on both ends.",1030924800,,4751,4.88293897882939
1725984,4,B000068MBI,"What makes this a worthwhile movie are the performances by Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman. Both are actors who are so good in everything they do that they don't seem to be acting but to be living out their roles. Judd is especially good this time out as a clever attorney who winds up defending her husband in a military trial, with the able Freeman (why hasn't this man won an academy award for at least one of his splendid performances?) as co-counsel. Freeman plays a recovering alcoholic whose law practise has been allowed to slide downhill to the point where his primariy client is a hooker. Given the actor's public acknowledgement of his own issues with substance abuse, his performance is right on the money--not too big but just enough to make the viewer feel a terrible anxiety when his sobriety is at stake.
While the script isn't particularly inspired, the cast more than compensates by offering solid performances across the board. And a nice little twist ending rounds things off well--although the post script scene detracts from what has gone before, leaving one with the feeling that they've just watched the premiere of what's going to be a one-hour TV series.
Definitely worth seeing.",1030838400,,1204,4.849514563106796
1725985,5,B000068MBI,"In High Crimes Ashley Judd plays an attorney forced to defend her husband. He's charged with murder in a past life she didn't even know about To help her Claire hires a grubby, disgruntled ex-marine lawyer named Charlie Grimes (Morgan Freeman), who's eager to take on the military brass that disgraced him years before.
even the The plot was predictable but Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman make this film work and Jim Caviezel is great in this film If you've been searching for a good suspense-thriller kept you guessing right up till the end  pick this movie .
The audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, which intensifies suspenseful scenes. Several Special Features are also included on this DVD: audio commentary with Director Carl Franklin, six featurettes and the original theatrical trailer",1030752000,2,806,5.06015037593985
1725986,4,B000068MBI,"Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd (""Kiss the Girls"") team up again in this courtroom thriller, which is entertaining despite its worn plot and obvious ending.  The reason it doesn't descend to a level consistent with the screenplay's unoriginality is the superior acting by the three principal performers.
Claire (Ashley Judd) and Tom (James Caviezel) are living an idyllic and romantic married life, trying hard to have a baby.  Everything is going swimmingly until one day Tom is arrested and charged with murder and war crimes dating back to his military service and raid in El Salvatore years earlier.  It seems Tom's entire identity is a lie and his name is really Ron Chapman, a former Special Forces commando.
Claire, who is conveniently a prominent defense lawyer, takes up his case determined to prove he is innocent, choosing to believe his denials despite the fact that everything she knows about him is a fabrication.  She hires Charlie Grimes (Morgan Freeman) to assist her because until he became a broken down alcoholic, he was once one of the top lawyers in the military.
The film is paced well and balanced between courtroom drama and other related storylines like constant death threats, a dirty general and a mystery man.  It is fairly standard fare, but the presentation is engaging.
Morgan Freeman is such a terrific actor, that even a trite script can't keep him down.  He is wily and insolent as the washed up lawyer with a few tricks left up his sleeve.  Freeman projects an unassuming power in his work, full of dynamism yet highly amiable.  His interaction with Judd is wonderful, treating her with avuncular kindness and intellectual respect.
Ashley Judd is a fine dramatic actor, who returns to serious drama after an ill advised detour into romantic comedy (""Someone Like You"").  Judd is razor sharp in this film, coming across as bright, energetic and passionate.  She is tough as nails and doesn't back down to pompous military officers or thugs trying to intimidate her.
Jim Caviezel rounds out the cast with a strong performance as the accused.  This is a tough character because he is so mysterious and duplicitous.  Caviezel delivered a strong portrayal of an enigmatic character in ""Angel Eyes"", so he had some experience with this type of role.  He handles the part well, appearing utterly sincere whether his character is telling the truth or not.
Amanda Peet gives her standard performance as Claire's hair brained and sex obsessed sister.  Peet is no serious dramatic talent, but she has this character down and comes across as believably ditzy and concerned about her sister despite their obvious sibling rivalry.
This film doesn't fool anyone with its surprise ending, but it does deliver good suspense, a tried and true formula and some excellent performances.  I rated it a 7/10.  It's worth a look for viewers who like mysteries.",1030752000,,2871,4.97489539748954
1725987,1,B000068MBI,"The movie was well acted and well filmed.  There were some interesting moments. Unfortunately, by the second half of the film, there are just too many grotesquely unbelieveable things happening. They might as well have had the Road Runner pop out from behind the sofa and resolve disparate plot elements as what actually occured.
A story has to have something unusual going on or it may be boring, but if everything is wierd, you are watching a fantasy or a cartoon.
They start off with Judd as a high-powered lady lawyer. Not common but ok.  She is married to an ex-marine enlisted man. Not likely, but concievable. He is a complete sweetheart that has never given her a moments worry in 6 years. But wait, he is also a mass murderer who is going to kill her when she discovers his secret. He travels about the country killing possible witnesses but nobody notices. The entire Marine Corps is full of bad guys that are trying to keep Judd from defending her husband, even though they are innocent.  They are getting ready to break  Morgan Freeman's neck just for coming in their bar.  And so on and on.....
If this was a Tom Green movie you would not expect for it to make sense, but with these actors and a few script changes this could have been an excellent movie. It was very irritating to see the time and talent wasted.",1030579200,7,1326,4.508333333333334
1725988,3,B000068MBI,"I was expecting more from the director of Devil In A Blue Dress, Carl Franklin. Any diehard movie goer would be able to see where this movie is heading and how it is going to end. It appears Director Franklin doesn't appreciate the intellegence of his audience and lays in too many little give-aways.
The story: Attorney Ashley Judd is married to a chap who has years earlier assumed a new identity to escape military justice. She discovers this interesting facet of his personality when the FBI jumps on them and takes him away to face murder charges at a military court martial. He is accused of killing citizens in a raid on a El Salvador village while in the Marine Corps. After reeling with shock that her husband is some other guy Ashley settles down and decides she will stand by him. Not only stand by him, but defend him. A court martial being out of her groove she contacts an attorney with military experience. Enter Morgan Freeman. Up to this point the story has been very good, leaving me wondering: ""How would I deal with this situation? What would I do?""
Now the movie shifts gears and the most interesting part is not the story which involves the court martial and dealing with the military mind, but the interaction between Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman. Ashley Judd is quite beautiful and charming and I am sure her best work is still ahead, but it is Morgan Freeman who commands your attention. He does not play that cool, confident character he does so well, rather he plays an achoholic in need of a haircut. A man with problems of his own. This is the best on-screen work he has ever done.(Aside: Wouldn't Bagger Vance have been a great film if Freeman had been the caddy?).
The story warps and weaves its way to a very nice last scene that leaves a pleasent glow if you have watched the preceeding, so hang in there.",1030579200,,1840,4.5119760479041915
1725989,3,B000068MBI,"Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman are truly a dream team.  I love to watch the two of them together.  Apparently so do the two of them - because Judd was brought this project and requested that Freeman be brought on board.
This movie isn't bad - not bad at all - it's just predictable.
Judd's character and her husband (Jim Cavaziel) are lovey dovey (so you know something bad is going to happen to them) in love.  What happens is her husband is arrested by the FBI and the military for mass murder.  This is a big deal.  Judd, being a famed defense lawyer, takes it upon herself to defend him in military court.  She and everyone else knows that he has been framed.  Or has he?
Freeman plays a former JAG corp lawyer who is now a recovering alocholic and assists Judd's character with the case.
The film is interesting and has some really exciting scenes, but even they weren't presented as well or as suspenseful as they could have been (I blame this on the director and editor, not the actors).
Speaking of the director...There are times when I really liked what he did with the film and others I didn't.  One of the really neat things I liked was that on several occasions he did this ""rough close up"" (my term) effect that I haven't seen utilized since the old Dirty Harry and Bullitt type movies of the 1970's.  It's really kind of cool and fit in this film.  It's just a shame that there wasn't more action here.  A decent car chase scene built into this film would have fit.  There is one, but it's just a few seconds long (shame).
This film just wasn't enough to satisfy my appettite.  It was too predictable and the audience only got to really know the lead characters well.  It would have helped if we'd had more character data on the ""villains"" and been sent down a few more wrong paths and provided more red herrings.
I did like this film, but I know that so much more could have been done with it.  I'm absolutely nuts about the two leads and I'd pay to see them read the newspaper aloud, but Hollywood really needs to pair the two of them up in an action packed action thriller.  Let's get it right the next time.",1030579200,4,2125,4.328282828282828
1725990,4,B000068MBI,"Let me just start by saying, chemistry between actors can make a good movie great! Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman have proved they work well together before in Kiss the Girls, and they do it again in High Crimes.
 The movie starts out with Judd's characters world being turned upside down, when she finds out her husband is not who he says he is. Freeman, a recovering alcholholic, and a lawyer, helps her sift through the world of military justice, to clear her husbands name. That is no easy task when you are being threatened every time you get close to the truth.
 High Crimes is and emotional roller coaster, that does not let you down. All in all, I believe this movie is worth watching and I look forward to any movie that combines Judd and Freeman in the future.",1030579200,,770,4.453900709219858
1725991,4,B000068MBI,"""High Crimes"" is based on a book of the same name by Joseph Finder, and is so frequently the case, the book is better than the movie. Which isn't to say that this is a bad movie; in fact, it is a very good one. In today's world, fascinated with trials and the legal system, the emphasis on courtroom events is to be expected, but as a retired lawyer with 30 years in the Courts, I find this aspect a bit ho-hum. But the underlying plot of a military atrocity being possibly covered up by the court martial of a scapegoat NCO is effectively rendered here. Ashley Judd, who I view as a B- level actress does a commendable job as the lawyer wife of the accused ex-soldier. Morgan Freeman, who I rank as an A- actor, and a favorite of mine, is excellent as the alchoholic ex-military lawyer who tries to help defend the accused, played very well by Jim Caviezel. It is a fast paced flic with a surprise twist ending that is a good effort and an enjoyable movie.",1030492800,20,957,4.263736263736264
