7821429,5,6302126134,"Clarissa by Richardson has the honor to be the longest novel eevr written in English. The story is the typical novel that was in fashion at the moment. Its author wanted to use the story of this honorable lady as a moral lesson.

This production by the BBC is a wonderful one. The cast, location, dialogues are perfect. But I must admit is a serie that maybe not everybody will enjoy. This is not a romantic film. Richardson presents their characters perfectly well depicted and they always act following their tempers. Lovelace is a villain, a libertine and he acts consequently. Doing everything to have Clarissa. He tries to be  gentle, but he will use every trick to get his aim, which is to bed her.

Clarissa Harlowe is an honorable lady, alone in a world of men who use her as an object and when she defies them by leaving with Lovelace she is punsished.

Do not expect the Love conquers all idea. This is not about love, it is about appetites and dignity. It is a great depcition of a time and a society that Richardson presents in its darkerst way. His critics to the family institution are poignant and severe

Sean Bean and Saskia Wickham are extremely well playing Lovelace and Clarissa. I think that specially Bean makes a great effort showing how good an actor he is.

If you like period dramas with more than the girl meets boy idea you will enjoy this great serie.",1102464000,,1380,4.5
