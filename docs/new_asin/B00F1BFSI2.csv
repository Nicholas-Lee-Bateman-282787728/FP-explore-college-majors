5962676,5,B00F1BFSI2,Excellent movie. Every parrot owner should watch!!,1411603200,,50,6.285714285714286
5962677,5,B00F1BFSI2,"Wonderful documentary about these long lived creatures.  Anyone who is thinking about adopting a parrot should watch this -- a parrot requires a life-long commitment.  A parrot can bring you great joy, but if you decide it was a mistake to bring a parrot into your home, the options for finding the parrot a new home may be seriously limited and very cruel for the parrot.",1392249600,8,372,4.621212121212121
5962678,5,B00F1BFSI2,"This well-researched documentary is true-to-life reflecting the rewards and disappointments of parrots as pets. A delight for anyone curious about parrots and people in the same home.
Parrots are not dogs or cats or even like other exotic pets. They both require and deserve to be seen exactly as they are: parrots. Certainly, not the pets for many people, but for those of us completely owned by these brilliant and unique creatures, there is no comparison or equal.",1389052800,7,467,5.0
5962679,5,B00F1BFSI2,I would like to show this to all zoo campers before our introduction to the parrots found in the zoo.,1388620800,,101,4.1
5962680,5,B00F1BFSI2,"Finally, an accurate portrayal of the realities that surround parrots in captivity. Exactly what breeders and pet stores DON""T want potential customers to know -- which is that parrots don't make good pets for most people, but there's nothing wrong with parrots. Sociable, noisy, active, messy, long-lived and complex, parrots belong in the wild, not in living rooms. This wonderful documentary by Argo Films shows the heartbreak of captivity experienced by thousands and thousands (perhaps millions) of parrots who end up in sanctuaries and rescues through no fault of their own. People who really love parrots don't buy them -- they adopt. And, everyone can help parrots in the wild. Just go to [...] to see some of the many projects going on world-wide to ensure that parrots stay where they belong: in savannahs, rain forests, on remote islands and wild plains, with their flocks, flying free. Great film!",1388188800,9,909,5.10738255033557
5962681,5,B00F1BFSI2,"Let me just start by saying i watched this documentary on WGBH as i do most of there animal programs. And I thought it was a fantastic ""reality check"" for folks out there who are either contemplating a new parrot as a pet. Or to just get a better understanding on these HIGHLY intelligent animals. I've been in the avian field now for nearly 30yrs having both wild & exotic pet bird species experience. And i've worked with and owned NUMEROUS parrot species over the years as well. I know Mark Foster well and what he has done at his ""Foster Parrots"" sanctuary is nothing less than a miracle. The devotion, time, passion, & commitment this man and his wife have put into there surrendered birds at the sanctuary is unparalleled especially when nobody else wanted them. His mindset is one of ""freedom"" for these animals and to a degree i believe he is correct. Why i say to a degree...? Is because the birds that are ""captive bred"" who know nothing of being in the wild can make extremely good pet companions. HOWEVER, and that's a big HOWEVER only if the prospective individual has extensively researched beforehand the species of parrot there interested in. I happen to work from home, so my ""fids"" I.E. flock as us Aviculturists call it are constantly getting the enrichment and best diet possible captive bred birds could possibly get at the present time. I own 5 parrots ALL of ""varying personalities"" as i strongly believe no two birds are alike even if there from the same species. My IRN or Indian Ringneck Keiko, Green-Cheek Conure Kiwi, Senegal Parrot Kia, Red-bellied Parrot Tiki, & Hahn's Macaw Loco CERTAINLY keep my hands full no doubt about it...!!! But if you were to ask me right now what would happen if i didn't have them in my life. Quite honestly, i'm not sure how i would answer that question because i treat my ""fids"" as we Aviculturists call them like they were my kids. And that isn't such a ""bizarre answer"" considering some of these parrots in fact DO have the intellect of a 3yr old child and to me that is EXTREMELY intelligent as well as mind boggling when you stop to think about it. This all said, for ANYONE out there considering one of these ""feathered jewels"" as i call them. I cannot stress enough the importance of educating oneself before impulsively diving headfirst into such a challenging hobby. What i can say with certainty is the more literature you read and the more discussions you have. With either a ""reputable & knowledgeable breeder"" OR ""parrot behaviorist"" the better and greater chances you'll have before making any mistakes that will affect not only you but the birds long-term welfare. As Mark pointed out in this documentary there is ABSOLUTELY no cage big or suitable enough for a large Macaw or Cockatoo. Which is why i firmly believe do to these larger birds ""mental health"" that they do in fact belong in the wild. Since it's extremely difficult for the ""average owner"" to meet ALL of there needs to properly survive the long lifespans they so rightfully deserve.",1385164800,15,3022,4.671669793621013
5962682,5,B00F1BFSI2,"Even if you don't think you like parrots you really need to watch this. Again, the Nature Series has outdone itself with this program. I don't even own a parrot but found this documentary spellbinding.  I have friends who own them and have always found their tales of trials and tribulations interesting.

I was really sad for some of the subjects in the program. It is certainly understandable how they get a bad rap sometime. I have an idea; why don't we just leave them in the wild for all to enjoy.",1384992000,8,502,4.445652173913044
8611333,5,B00F1BFSI2,"As a parrot rescue, I totally enjoyed the wisdom that went into making this film.",1503964800,,81,4.466666666666667
8611334,5,B00F1BFSI2,"I really enjoyed watching this documentary - being a bird owner myself. Very insightful and sobering look at how people treat birds, and why - for the most part - birds should not be someone's pet, but should be viewed in the wilds. Moreso since parrots have exhibited intelligence on a human range. These are intelligent, feeling creatures who do not deserve to be caged.  In my case (so as not to appear hypocritical), as with some others, mine is fully flighted, can go anywhere he wants, and is absolutely bonded to me by choice, and we go everywhere together. Unless you can provide a truly fully functional home life, parrots are best left wild.",1498089600,,651,4.660869565217391
8611335,5,B00F1BFSI2,"First saw this film on PBS and knew I wanted to add it to my home DVD collection.  Confidential is a beautifully filmed, narrated and an important film for anyone who owns a parrot or is considering buying a parrot.",1476576000,,215,4.375
8611336,5,B00F1BFSI2,"I watched the show Parrot Confidential on NatGeo, and I really liked it.  I liked all the depicted rescues and stories the people had to tell, altho' I was brought to tears several times.  I am owned by 5 parrots myself, all acquired in the late 1980's and early 1990's, so they've been with me a long time.  My oldest one is 28 - not so old in parrot years.  But I'm getting older.  I was 41 when I got my first one, and of course, didn't think ahead and realize that one day I would be very old, and they would probably have quite a few years left.  So I'll be faced with tough choices, more than likely, down the road.  My grandchildren are still all in school, but maybe down that road, they might take a couple of them.  Time will tell; if not, I hope I can find compassionate people or a good sanctuary for them.  I know I'll be planning ahead though, and praying each night that things will work out for us.",1457395200,3,914,4.11864406779661
8611337,4,B00F1BFSI2,"Good DVD, but is shows pet parrot ownership in a very negative light.  Yes, parrots are neglected, but so are all other animals kept as pets.  Parrots born in captivity can have happy lives, full of love, with the right care.  If you are thinking about getting a parrot, watch this first, then decide how to proceed.",1447200000,2,316,4.508771929824562
8611338,5,B00F1BFSI2,Wonderful documentary on the lives of parrots and other exotic birds we turn into our pets without considering their basic natural needs.  I certainly learned a lot and regret that I didn't know many things about them until now.  Thanks to the producers and the principals in the film who taught us a lot.  Hope that millions of people viewed this or will be viewing this soon.,1440028800,2,377,4.597014925373134
8611339,5,B00F1BFSI2,Potential parrot owners must see.  My Yellow Naped Amazon loves this DVD!,1426291200,,73,5.083333333333333
8611340,5,B00F1BFSI2,"This is real.  It's hard to imagine what it takes for a human to fulfill the needs of a parrot, and the reality is devastating.  I thought this documentary kept a good pace, delving into the issues facing parrots in captivity and the wild without patronizing or sensationalizing.",1422316800,,279,4.791666666666667
8611341,4,B00F1BFSI2,"This is an excellent program.  It's very informative and educational about the intelligence of parrots, as well as the demands and problems of keeping them in captivity.  It should be required viewing for anyone contemplating owning a parrot.  Sadly most people who decide they want one won't see this, and more birds will end up unwanted and abandoned at overburdened sanctuaries, deprived of the lives they should have led in the wild.",1420588800,4,437,5.041666666666667
8611342,5,B00F1BFSI2,"This should be mandatory viewing for anyone, like me, who is thinking of getting a parrot.  Now I know better.  Fascinating documentary.  So glad I saw it.",1413072000,,155,4.666666666666667
