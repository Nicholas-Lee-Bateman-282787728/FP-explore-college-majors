4487744,5,B004WMOSLE,"Undercover agents in occupied France was the way that the British organized the resistance in the early days of the war. Up until the time of the D-Day invasion, it was the only way to fight on the european continent. This story shows what it must have been like for the agents from training to actual missions. I enjoyed all three series immensely. Make sure that you get all three.",1320796800,,383,4.485714285714286
4487745,5,B004WMOSLE,"Good drama with superb acting.  Good story line too.  I liked the character...forgot her name, playing the code translator.  She was hot headed and I could see how she left doubts with the superiors.  However, she turned out to be determined and held out.  I couldn't wait to start the next segment...Series 2.",1319500800,,310,4.773584905660377
4487746,5,B004WMOSLE,This has been such an enjoyable series.  I've enjoyed every episode and can't wait for the next one.  This gives us an idea of conditions in wartime Europe. Well worth the money.,1316217600,2,178,4.53125
4487747,5,B004WMOSLE,Great series and very interesting.  If you like WWII stories these are based on facts and done very well.  Well worth the cost.,1315267200,2,127,4.478260869565218
4487748,3,B004WMOSLE,"The story opens with Adele (Jane Snowden), a British resistance worker, nearly being arrested by the Nazis after she was caught with a radio set at the highway checkpoint on the way to Le Crest, France. Adele and her British colleagues are in Le Crest to aid the Maquis du Vercors, a French resistance group. The work they have to do is difficult and their lives are often at stake against the Nazis who have no qualms when it comes to killing innocent citizens.

D-Day is drawing closer and the Special Operations Executive branch in England has requested that the Maquis stage an uprising to divert Nazi resources from Normandy. But things don't go as planned. There is an informer in the resistance group and someone makes a deadly mistake that will have grave consequences on everyone.

Wish Me Luck, Series 3 is based on actual events that happened during World War II. This made the story all the more real and heartbreaking. There are eight episodes, and in every episode, heavy usage of pathos was evident. The finale was depressing to say the least. If you are a fan of happy endings, stay away from this series.

This series is a British television drama. There are three series altogether, which aired from 1988 to 1990. Unlike many television series nowadays, the producers of this series were not afraid of sad endings. Being brought up in a television culture of happy endings, this series was an unusual one for me. It was unusual in a good way because it reinforced the belief of reality. Happy endings don't always happen in real life.

Acorn Media released this series in DVD in July. The sound and image quality are excellent and clear. I particularly liked the availability of subtitles. Since I have difficulty understanding Western accents, they came in handy. The advertisements for other British television series made available by Acorn Media that came on each time I played the DVD were a bother, I managed to skip them to enter the main menu of the DVD after a couple of tries.

While I did not like the ending, I had to accept that things weren't all happy and good during World War II. The Nazis were cruel and heartless. And that was real life. If you are a fan of World War II movies, this series will definitely pique your interest. It is heartwarming in a strange way because it showed that there were unnamed, fearless heroes during World War II who were willing to stand up against evil.

There was mystery, adventure, intrigue and the little dose of humor and romance. What more can you ask for? Give Wish Me Luck, Series 3 a watch, but first, be prepared with a box of tissues.

Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this DVD free from Acorn Media. I was not required to write a positive review.",1314748800,11,2740,4.637113402061856
4487749,2,B004WMOSLE,Unfortunately  We felt that the last episodes of Wish me luck left a lot to be desired -way to much story around the priest and some other characters instead of making the actual story and history of this herioc group of people --the fact that this little town could hold up like it did with little or no actual military might and the times that no help was on its way got to be --been there done that type of thing --not to believeable and not very interesting.,1314403200,,462,4.25
4487750,5,B004WMOSLE,We had no idea how involved Britain was in the French underground during WWII especially the roles of women.  The series is well done and quite informative. I would recommend it highly.,1314316800,2,185,4.78125
4487751,5,B004WMOSLE,"I had to get the whole set - it just wasn't what I expected at all from a BBC made for TV period show.
Perhaps I was expecting something in the ""Allo Allo"" vein set in occupied France, I can only say my surprise was complete.

I had previously thought the best effort on WW2 to come from the UK was Foyles War - from a woman's perspective I'm afraid Wish ME Luck might just have an edge. That really would come down to personal preference.

Series three of Wish ME Luck builds on the same surviving characters we came to know and be drawn into through series one and two as it brings us to the end of the war.

It has all the elements that made series one and two so captivating, for me at least. Love, betrayal, loyalty, courage, determination and force of character were all displayed by the actors in a very finely tuned and most professional way - a way that had the ice-cream forgotten and melting in the bowl!

All aspects of this series about the Women's spy service were excellently executed - the costumes were very detailed, the sets profesional, even the aircraft didn't look like cheaply done computer animations or enhancements.

Between the characters, the storylines, both of which were excellently developed, and the sets the viewer is almost irresistably drawn into and through the period with every advancing episode.

The only advice I could possibly give to anyone, and its from a personal perspective, if you like drama, and set around this period, buy the entire set. You probably will eventually anyway. If you must or can only get one series, start with the first.

I do not think you will be disappointed.",1311292800,14,1630,4.561643835616438
4487752,5,B004WMOSLE,"A war thriller, action, suspense. British women in the Special Operations Executive (SOE) branch of the war fought in silence, often leading men, risking all on the French theater. Subplots in these 8 episodes also finding occasional love. Duty for the women gets ugly and hard. Triumphs with tragedy. Takes place in 1944 in SE France, with bits in London HQ. Women in strong roles (based on REAL stories), and tense episodes that provide a magnificent view of idyllic French countryside. Excellent attention to period detail. 8 episodes with a continuing story, picked up from the previous season. So good my wife and I watched all, one after another.

""WISH ME LUCK: Series 1 & 2"" might be considered as well. One introduces characters that continue throughout the 3 years by involvement in some dicey espionage. More military/spy action/fighting in 2nd. Historically accurate war drama. Fantastic 1940s depiction of London and France. It's a segment of real war action that is seldom featured.

Cast: now head of HQ-Faith (Jane Asher-Death at a Funeral).....Spy Kit (Michael J. Jackson-The Glory Boys, Mobile).....Spy-Liz (Kate Buffery-Trial & Retribution)....Spy Emily (Jane Snowden who reminds me of Honeysuckle Weeks)...Fr. Girl Sylvie (Shirley Henderson-The Way We Live Now)...Nazi Gen (Terrence Hardiman-Cadfael; Prime Suspect)...well, and a bunch more.

 Episode details for those interested. Each average 52 minutes.
All DO have SUBTITLES
Episode 1 French Alps set and a Frenchie, Nicole, helps when the Nazi nearly capture Emily traveling to join Kit. London's new SOE head, Faith, sends 2 spies to Le Crest, Virginia & Lewis, an antagonistic team. Nicole has her own interest in the resistance people.

2 Kit's to lead a major military supported uprising. Luc suspects an informer in the Le Crest resistance group. Virginia has the biggest surprise of all.

3 Faith threatens to resign when leaders above her fail to make good on promises. Emily makes a bad mistake. Virginia secretly meets with someone from her past life in France.

4 A massacre as a result of Father Martin's escape. The uprising grows and the BBC has an Allied landing of France broadcast. Emily finds the informant's ID.

5 There is Nazi brutality & gruesome discovery ahead for Le Crest. Nicole must face her fate. Faith tries new measures in London HQ.

6Resistance struggles to get information from a captured collaborator. Lewis and his spy boss, Virginia, are at odds. Germans attack receives no help even after please from Emily.

7 An attempted airport assault leaves Luc injured and 2 important leaders captured. An English spy is sent to warn the British to get out while they can.

8 The Le Crest attack from the Nazi troops is underway. It is life and death. A final battle at Le Crest and conclusion for the 3rd and final series of ""Wish Me Luck."" For whom has luck run out?

Action, Suspense, Romance, World War Two, Spies, Intrigue, 1944 period perfection, Astounding cast, Gripping drama, and women as tough as they are beautiful; all blended together. It's like women replacing Foyle (See Foyle's War) with the action set in France. Also consider looking at ""We'll Meet Again"" if you like this behind the front type of war suspense. Not one to rent, but buy, you will watch it again and again.",1307491200,21,3293,5.022018348623853

4487771,4,B004WMOSLE,"Excellent series which made every effort to be as authentic as possible in every detail and for me as military history enthusiast having the correct period vehicles, uniforms and equipment is a must.

4487772,4,B004WMOSLE,"Series One of WISH ME LUCK left me wanting more. Series Two left me on the edge of my seat. I could hardly wait for the third and final series!
The contribution of female British agents in World War II is a time-honoured, though still under-represented, topic in films. Beginning with such films as Odette and Carve Her Name With Pride (both made in the 50s), the British have taken occasional stabs at presenting the stories of these courageous women whose contribution to the war effort is often over-looked. WISH ME LUCK is a gripping program that seeks to give credit where credit is due.

Series Three picks up where Series Two left off, though there is one notable absence, at least on the home front. Julian Glover for some reason left the show and while Jane Asher is promoted to the central home front role, she isn't as commanding a presence as Glover. This really serves as a metaphor for the whole series by this point: something is missing and you wish theyd recover it, or just get on with things!

Dont get me wrong, its still a gripping espionage thriller, but by now weve seen everything were going to see from these characters, even though there are some changes in the central cast. In harms way previously, Kate Buffery was a wonderful protagonist. While it is entirely believable that her character would disappear for a while, she was sorely missed. She did appear for the finale, which was a good thing, and helped to give the series a proper finish.

I thoroughly enjoyed Series Three of WISH ME LUCK, though the storylines had become awfully familiar by now.

Still, its nice when a quality program has the opportunity to wrap up loose ends and finish things properly. Fans of Series One and Two will thoroughly enjoy Series Three, even if they may occasionally be looking at their watches.",1397433600,2,1815,4.6625

4487774,4,B004WMOSLE,A good historical drama delving into the lives of ordinary people who leave the comfort of their homes to be part of something greater than themselves.  Does a good job capturing the issues with the private and professional lives of the men and women who volunteered for service.  An older series (1980's) but still very relevant and engaging today.,1393027200,,349,4.898305084745763

4487776,5,B004WMOSLE,A great story of the British civilian agents who risked it all to sabotage the German military in France during WWII. Scenery was superb high in the French Alps (I think) and filming was very well done. The horror of the occupation and the fight for freedom is well captured in this great series.,1386288000,,296,4.5

4487778,5,B004WMOSLE,This series was one of best we have seen in a very long time.  It covers a time period of history that we do not know that much about.  It shows a nation in very bad trouble and how the citzens worked to make the world free once again.  Not just men but the women who gave up their families and lives to make this happen.  Great cast.

4487786,3,B004WMOSLE,The final season is a bit weaker than the first two. The spy group leaders all seem to have hidden personal agenda which compromise their mission and assignment.

4487798,1,B004WMOSLE,"I'm a total anglophile, and I'm easily charmed by pretty much anything with a British accent.  But ""Wish Me Luck"" series 3 is a marathon of ghastly acting and miserable writing that makes ""CSI Miami"" look like ""Mad Men"".

An example:  A priest who works with the Resistance is rescued from the Nazis and goes into hiding.  Fine--Except he doesn't even bother to change his cassock, or even to hide his clerical collar.  And then he holds Mass in the crowded local church.  Another:  A character (Emily) visits a prisoner the night before the prisoner's scheduled execution solely to tell her that she (Emily) never wants to speak to her again, which raises the question of why she's there in the first place.

But that's typical of the lousy writing.  Characters repeatedly withhold key information from each other, for no other reason than that it's necessary for the idiotic plot.

I'm a little sorry to be venting this vehemently about a series that very few people will ever see, but I can't remember being as irritated about a UK program as I am about this one.

One final note:  It won't take long before you find yourself dreading the constant reappearance of the tedious theme music.",1339891200,4,1191,4.728155339805825

4487802,4,B004WMOSLE,"Tale focuses on the British SOE (Special Operations Executive) who recruit and train British women who have backgrounds that will let them pass as French women in Nazi occupied France during WWII. For those so interested the SOE really existed and was created in 1940 by Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Minister of Economic Warfare Hugh Dalton to conduct guerrilla warfare against the Axis and to instruct and aid local resistance movements. The last series of this TV show was in some ways the weakes of the three but in other ways one of the strongest. First off, some of new characters were just below par in acting abilities. The Jewish girl courier overacted, trying to talk in an overly sophisticated voice and bulging her eyes and sticking her chin out too much. It just looked weird and a spy would try to fit in, not stand out. She was easily the most noticeable and irriating and while there were some others they were several notches down. In other areas it was strong because it used characters from the previous two series and it also built up the ending to a tragic conclusion.
The third and final series is based on the actions of the Maquis du Vercors and the events in Vassieux-en-Vercors, though the locations used are given fictional names, such as the village being named Couermont and the plateau ""Le Crest"".  Nice touch on showing the home people getting too attached to their agents when bad things happen at the end. The German general was played by Terrance Hardiman, who was also Abbot Radulfus in the CADFAEL series.
