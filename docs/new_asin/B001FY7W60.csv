8303098,5,B001FY7W60,"I know Allen Dobbs. My husband was also a Vietnam veteran who died in 2000 from post traumatic stress disorder. The film deals with war and its consequences. It is not the glory it's been portrayed in most war movies, especially in the early years. Very interesting, informative and sad. War is hell.
