8660392,5,B00JWS9G1K,"If you have any interest at all in American art at the grass roots level, this is the film to see. A mixture of older and newer rock poster artists, most still working today, this documentary is a fascinating blend of artistic styles and motivations, all at the DIY level, all with a real passion you don't find in the high-brow art world.
This gives you an appreciation of what real creatively means, both in the art and in the process to create that art. Everybody is in this film and it's just a plain blast to watch it besides!
See is soon and watch it often!",1269734400,10,563,4.271028037383178
