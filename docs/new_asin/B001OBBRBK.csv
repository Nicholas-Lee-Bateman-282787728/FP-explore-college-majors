3729423,5,B001OBBRBK,"This volume ended the series rather abruptly in a ""its not over, yet"" kind of way because the Manga is still being made and all 26 episodes were pretty much derived from 4 volumes of Manga (still ongoing). so there will prolly be another season in like 2-3 years, in fact an OAV was already created and licensed.
anyways, this volume holds up to the prior volumes in its comedy and originality. its well worth the purchase and will most likely shine as an anime classic that others will fail to recreate.
-the only problem i had with this volume is that the voice actress for Konata changed her voice slightly and added way too roughness in way too many lines instead of doing the cutesy type voice and it kinda messed up the experience a litte.
-Other than that this volume ruled",1243468800,3,780,4.461538461538462
3729424,4,B001OBBRBK,"This is the final volume of the Lucky Star OVA containing episodes 21-24. Since the usual TV season in Japan is 13 episodes, the termination of the show at episode 24 instead of 26 is odd. The four episodes on the disk are a strange variety - two are the typical ""slice of life"" episodes with little plot aside from the joke of the scene. Two of the episodes tell a bit of a story, with Konata asking her father about her dead mother and also about his lolita complex which terminates with a visitation by the spirit of Konata's mom. The other deals obliquely with the older girl's pending graduation. And I will be honest, I was expecting the anime to be similar to other ""slice of high school life"" anime shows like Azimanga Diaoh with a touching final episode, or a heart rending final episode like the Kimagare Orange Road OVAs where one girl is chosen, the other dumped and she tries to go on with life and hide the fact just how much the betrayal is hurting her. But as the final episode started winding down, and our girls were still planning their final school festival, with college exams and graduation still a month or so away, I began to worry that the series might leave me hanging in the air. And sure enough, the final scene left all the important questions unanswered and left me feeling dissastisfied. I had to view the final scene a second time and sit down and think about why the directors would chose to end the series at that point, rather than showing us what would happen to the girls after graduation. I thought about my own graduation, so many years ago, and how few of us really knew what we wanted to do with our lives, even those in my class who had college lined up. And how unprepared for what the world had in store for us. In the end, I believe the message the director and writers meant for us to get from the ending was that a bright, unknown future awaited the girls, and so long as they had each other's support and friendship, there was nothing to fear. Either I am painfully slow, however, or the message was too subtle for me to pick up at first viewing. At the beginning of this series, I did not quite like ""Lucky Star"" but the stories and characters grew on me to the point where now, at the end, I wanted to know what fate held in store for Konata and friends. The fact that I was denied such closure left me feeling unhappy, though it also leaves the producers free to do a second series or specials if they so desire. The fact that Lucky Star didn't sell well enough that the Special Edition of vol. 6 was cancelled leads me to believe that there will probably be no more Lucky Star, which is a bit of a shame. Reaching the end of Lucky Star was like coming to the last piece of the best box of chocolates you ever ate, wanting more, and finding out that the candy company went out of business. The end of Azamanga Diaoh left me choked up, fondly remembering my own high school days. The end of Lucky Star did not give much such deep emotional ties to the story and characters, instead I was left thinking ""Oh, nuts, it can't just end here!""",1237507200,6,3087,4.296740994854202
8330121,4,B001OBBRBK,"First of all I don't recommend this unless you're a hardcore anime collector (due to the price). But if your looking for a rare out of print anime dvd this one is nearly impossible to find. The shipping of this was extermly fast, heck I ordered this yesterday the package was a bit damaged but the dvd was fine. Over all I am happy with my purchase finally completing my luck star collection after a year of hunting for all 7 dvds",1439337600,,430,4.2560975609756095

8330123,4,B001OBBRBK,"An amazing show, but points off for the rushed release leading to there not being an LE version of this volume.",1418860800,,111,4.333333333333333
8330124,5,B001OBBRBK,"The best disc in the whole series, but the last disc usually is.

Note to potential buyers; I purchased this item for $40 on Amazon a few months ago.  You have to be patient, but if you check the different sites eventually you will see one for sale for a reasonable price.  Even at anime conventions where everything is gouged you won't find this going for over $60.  Don't be discouraged by the lunatics trying to strike it rich on someone with more money than sense.  Your time for owning the elusive Vol 6. will come!",1399852800,,520,4.375
8330125,4,B001OBBRBK,"This is the end (unless you count the OVA). :(
Very sad to see it go, but this was a cute show while it was around.",1383004800,,115,3.4615384615384617
8330126,4,B001OBBRBK,"If you liked the first five volumes, you're going to like this one too. The appearance of Konata's mother (not really a spoiler since it's the cover art of the volume) is nice, although brief.
The only real complaints I have are that it is the end of the series, and that the last episode actually feels a little anticlimactic when compared to something like the finale of Azumanga Daioh. It's not bad by any means, but I wanted something more.",1375142400,,444,4.493827160493828
8330127,3,B001OBBRBK,Really. You can get the entire series for ~$100-$200 as the anime legends set. Or the Blu-Ray set (which also has dubs/subs) for ~250. Paying anything over MAYBE $50 for this single disc is straight up legal robbery. Resellers and profiteers are cancerous scum.,1369785600,13,261,4.954545454545454
8330128,3,B001OBBRBK,"I appreciated that the DVD was at a discount. That does not mean I was expecting an ex-library DVD that was covered in stickers. Usually this would not be a problem but the stickers were under the protective plastic. This ruined the cover picture. Wherever it came from originally I would have liked to have a full description of the item instead of just saying ""used"". That was too much of an understatement.",1357862400,,409,4.616438356164384
8330129,5,B001OBBRBK,"This one is really good. Its the last few days of High School for the girls and things get really fun when it was time for the Arts Festival.

8330130,3,B001OBBRBK,"With this disc being the combo breaker of the series by being the only one not to have a limited edition. But you do get the DVD  at a more reasonable price and the cover is a but sentimental with Konata's mom following the two.

For a smaller price you get less, but then again it isn't the limited edition stuff that's the most important, but rather the DVD itself.",1247011200,4,367,4.228571428571429
