7914722,4,B00001TZ59,"In my humble opinion, this is one of India's greatest films of the 1990s. The wealth on talent on show has never been equalled in any other indian film.

The story is basically about two warring families in Rajisthan, and how various members of each family try to end this feud. The film climaxes with a brilliantly choreographed fight sequence between Sunny Deol and Sanjay Dutt. The scenery and musical score during this fight is magnificent, as it is during most of the duration of the movie. My only gripe is the slightly corny scenes set in the UK.

Considering the epic storyline being told over two generations, and the large number of characters involved, I get the feeling that the version I saw (which runs for about 180 minutes) had been edited significantly to reduce it to a sensible running time. I would love to see the full version as it would help to flesh out some of the characters.

All in all, its another brilliant movie from one of my favourite directors, J P Dutta.",1304380800,,989,4.576271186440678
