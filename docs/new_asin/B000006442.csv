7903632,4,B000006442,"""Jazz Ball"" is a VHS I have been trying to obtain for years,having only a few scenes recorded by a friend.  This video gives us a glimpse of some of the great ambassadors--Duke Ellington,Louis Armstrong, Gene Krupa,Bob Crosby's Bobcats,  , and the Mills Brothers,among many. It was great to see and sing along with the Mills Brothers in some rare footage. Unfortunately, my VHS copy had some sound and tracking problems, but it's worth seeing early jazz pioneers,like Red Nichols and Ina Ray Hutton.",1145318400,,499,4.928571428571429
