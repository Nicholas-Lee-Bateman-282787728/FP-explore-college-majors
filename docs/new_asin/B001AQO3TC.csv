3459311,5,B001AQO3TC,"I am also waiting for the 4th season of diagnosis murder to be out. I did sign up to be alerted when it does.  Why hasn't it been released yet???  I love Dick Van Dyke, he is a fantastic actor.  I also think that it is wonderful that his son is also on the show, they work very well together.  Please Amazon, if you can do anything to release the rest of the series, do so ASAP.  The show has a lot of fans out there!!!!!!!!!
It is a great show!!!!!!!!!!!!!

3459312,5,B001AQO3TC,Why haven't the other seasons been released? So many people want them and have asked for them. And we have waited patiently for so long. Please release the other seasons soon. The show is a family favorite. It is rare to find a good show that your whole family can watch together and truly enjoy. Please please please release the other seasons!

Today is Dec. 8th 2009 for all of you guys who wrote in 6 months ago you're not alone. Someone's not doing there job the way there supposed to and needs to step down and let a real T.V. and movie fan take over. The people in charge of the new releases probably don't even know who Dick Van Dike is,yet alone heard of Diagnosis Murder. Anyway my fingers are crossed  Namaste' everyone.",1260230400,17,505,4.05

3459318,5,B001AQO3TC,"I agree with the other person whose review is going on a year old! Please Amazon, if you have any clout with Paramount TV, get them to release the rest of the Diagnosis Murder series. I couldn't find how to sign up to be notified of any new DM DVDs so I thought I'd just write this review in the hopes that someone at Amazon will see it and realize we DM fans just want the rest of our show on DVD. Pretty much everything else I like is already making good progress on DVDs such as House, Bones, and some of the newer ones. Please light a fire under the powers that be so that the rest of DM can be released soon! Season 4 is awesome, I remember from watching it first time around and from my tapes that I have to rely on if I want anything past season 3.",1237593600,25,755,3.9411764705882355

3459369,5,B001AQO3TC,This is the fourth season for Diagnosis Murder.  Dr. Sloan has his work cut out for him with each episode dealing with his career as a doctor and working with the police department solving crimes that happen with the help of his son Steve Sloan.  In this season Mark reveals he has a daughter and that they are not close like he and his son are and he regrets that fact. Also Mark gets the chance to make up with his daughter and start to build their relationship back up.  The series has a shocking season ending episode with the murder of Dr. Sloan by a man who blames him for getting sent to prison and his death has an impact of all at the hospital.  This is a good addition to the series collection.,1462838400,,704,4.192592592592592

3459573,4,B001AQO3TC,Great price for a whole season. But my wife learned that some episodes wouldn't work on her Sony portable dvd player nor on any of my dvd burners on my computer. Put it in a old Panasonic DVD player and it works fine. Seems like it uses some obsolete video codecs on some of the episodes. Looks great on the television anyway.,1405728000,4,326,4.274193548387097

Anyone who is a fan of Dick Van Dyke and Mysteries will be lined anxiously awaiting the next installment of this series.  Wednesday, June 06, 2012......

Matlock, Father Dowling Mysteries, Murder She Wrote ....  All have most or all seasons on DVD but not Diagnosis Murder.  WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE HERE??!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  They are releasing some great shows but someone (or some people) are biased against the DIAGNOIS MURDER series.  Why are we being made to suffer when they are releasing all kinds of stuff to DVD?  They are dropping out B grade horror movies, all kinds of westerns, made for TV Movies and (of course) DIRECT TO VIDEO (DVD).  What is the deal here???!!!!  WE need to all send a letter to the CBS offices and start demanding they get of their collective butts and get these out.  This was an awesome series and I don't want to see it lost in limbo never to be finished on DVD. It's all great that they are putting this on the web via HULU or whatever service, but being an old-fashioned person I really want the movies so I can kick back on the couch and plug them to watch over and over and over...

3459665,5,B001AQO3TC,"I have watched every Diagnosis Murder episode from each season numerous times. I love Dick Van Dyke and the entire cast. They made you believe they cared for the people they were trying to help in each episode, and for each other. Dr. Sloan made you want him as your doctor, your neighbor, your father, and your friend. It is a show that tells a light-hearted story usually within one hour, sometimes more, but most of all, it is a show that has values, yes...values, which is difficult to find in today's television programming.

I am patiently waiting for Season 4 (along with the remaining seasons) to be released soon. I hope somebody who can make this happen is listening to us all. We want our Diagnosis Murder!! We have waited long enough. Somebody, please make this happen!! It is definitely time.",1333670400,2,805,4.669014084507042

3459668,5,B001AQO3TC,"Diagnosis Murder was one of the best shows of the 90s, in my opinion. Dick Van Dyke was awesome as Dr. Mark Sloan (the FIRST Mark Sloan), and Mark was one of my favorite tv characters growing up. The series really started getting good when Jesse was brought into the mix in season 3, and I was hoping that my favorite show was going to continue to be released. I understand if CBS doesn't want to release it massively if it didn't sell well, but they've done other shows through CreateSpace Manufactured-On-Demand through amazon. Could they not do this show the same way?! I love DM!! Please continue releasing the seasons!",1312934400,6,623,4.621621621621622
