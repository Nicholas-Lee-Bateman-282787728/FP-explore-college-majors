8493383,5,B0065IYIIG,"Back in late 1981, the Seven Network in Australia took a plunge with a twice weekly serial set in rural New South Wales with the title A Country Prcatice. The series was launched in the summer months when there are usually fewer people in front of their TV sets than in other times of the year. From this point on at 7.30pm twice a week, millions of Australians would tune in to Seven to delve into the stories surrounding the inhabitants and visitors around Wandin Valley.
These 14 episodes introduce the viewer to Sister Marta Kertesz (Helen Scott) a Hungarian born nursing sister who has settled in Wandin Valley. We also meet the newly arrived Joneses from Adelaide - wild Molly (Anne Tenney) and Brendan (Shane Witthington). Anne and Shane would later marry in real-life. Dr Simon Bowen (Grant Dodwell), a Sydney born late 20s doctor is also a recent arrival to Wandin Valley and seems interested in the local vet Vicky Dean (Penny Cook) who is daughter of Sister Shirley Dean (Lorrae Desmond). Shirley is in her late 40s and works as a receptionist at the medical practice where Dr Terence Elliott (Shane Porteous) and Simon practise. Other locals include Sergeant Frank Gilroy (Brian Wenzel), busybody Esme Watson (Joyce Jacobs), Vernon ""Cookie"" Locke (Syd Heylen) and Bob Hatfield (Gordon Piper).
The series which went on to run for over 1000 episodes features a wealth of guest stars from the whole Australian acting world. Many hours can be spent spotting the ""Sons and Daughters"" or ""The Young Doctors"", additionally the odd ""Prisoner: Cell Block H"" who pop up during the series' run.
Every week two episodes were devoted to a particular theme involving guest artists. The regulars had their own longer-running stories as well.
This set is a treat!
Enjoy travelling back to 1981 and back to Wandin Valley! I did!",1323129600,3,1823,4.864951768488746
