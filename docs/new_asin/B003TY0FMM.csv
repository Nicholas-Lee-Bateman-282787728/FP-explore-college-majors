4192992,5,B003TY0FMM,"Juliet Jivanti has put together a beautiful dvd that is not only easy to follow, but so important for anyone looking to bring balance to their practice.  The Ayurvedic approach will allow the student to choose whichever area they are feeling needs attention (i.e. more energy, more calm, more grounding) and apply this to their practice.  The setting is also extremely peaceful.  I love it!",1283299200,3,390,4.969230769230769
8405528,5,B003TY0FMM,"If it wasn't for Juliet I would have never found my love for yoga. I used to take her classes before I moved out of state. I have yet to find a good yoga studio near me, thankfully I have her DVD at home to keep me going in my yoga practice. Since I can't go to her classes in person I get to bring her all the way to New Mexico into my living room. It's not the same but it's the next best thing. I highly recommend people buy her DVD she's easy to follow and knows the true meaning of yoga!",1385510400,,492,3.7403846153846154
8405529,5,B003TY0FMM,"Finally a yoga video that focuses on each dosha!  This enables my husband & I to focus on balancing what needs to be and gives us work out options to keep things interesting.  The instructor does move a little fast through the poses (asanas), but we can pause the disk and get situated.  We are true beginners and middle-aged folks who are quite out of shape.  It it would be nice if someone out there could make a truly ""beginners"" Ayurvedic yoga DVD so us older folks can do the poses without toppling over or injuring ourselves.  So far this DVD is our favorite and we've purchased several over the past few months.",1372118400,4,618,4.433628318584071
8405530,5,B003TY0FMM,"I have been doing yoga at local yoga studios for years but I hit this place of wanting a deeper knowledge and wanting to practice intuitively on my own.  Many times I found myself drained after yoga and knew that there must be a better way.  I wanted to learn to listen to what my body needed for that day and practice accordingly. Juliet's DVD was a wonderful way for me to do that by offering 3 different practices that could be used to energize, calm or strengthen. Myself, along with husband and two daughters(8 and 12)have seen the benefits of the dvd.  I highly recommend for anyone looking to feel better and bring balance into their day!",1361577600,3,645,4.4491525423728815
8405531,5,B003TY0FMM,"These routines, based on body type or dosha, are perfectly un-intimidating. All the movements are well within the capabilities of my over-60yr body.

The production is superb...excellent camera angles so you can see what poses are supposed to look like; a setting by the shore which is energizing (wind/waves) but not noisy thanks to a great job of over-dubbing by Juliet.

This is definitely at the top of my 'desert-island' list (if you could only take one cd...).",1322697600,6,466,4.961538461538462
8405532,5,B003TY0FMM,"This video is full of great information for both Yoga and Ayurveda.  It has personalized yoga sessions for specific body and emotional types, which helped me to feel calm and grounded in my practice.  As a yoga instructor I was pleasantly surprised that the subtle adjustments and approaches that Juliet takes on yoga had profound effects on my practice.  I also appreciated the detailed description and tips for each body type (dosha).  This allowed me to take my Yoga and Ayurveda practice off the mat and into my daily routine, diet and outlook on life.  I highly recommend this video to anyone looking for a unique and comprehensive healing experience.",1317686400,,656,4.927272727272728
8405533,5,B003TY0FMM,"I consider myself a beginning student of yoga so some of the yoga positions in this DVD were a challenge for me; however I love that!  I want a yoga workout that stretches my abilities and keeps me motivated and this DVD does that.  The explanations of Ayurveda and Yoga combined were educational and helpful.  I love the music and ocean location (living in Montana mid-winter, location helps big time!)  I look forward to continuing using the yoga workouts on this DVD!  Thanks!",1298332800,,479,4.72289156626506
8405534,5,B003TY0FMM,"I'm one of those people who has read a lot about yoga, but practiced little. I was first introduced to Ayurvedic yoga while on a trip to Nepal last year. I purchased this DVD with the intention of incorporating it as part of early morning motions.

I feel and think I've found a match. Although, I'm a beginner, I can say that Juliet's routines are very much doable. All throughout the 3 sections, Juliet does a smooth voice-over job which meshes well with the energy work at hand.

There is also this flow about each routine. Maybe it's the combination of great scenery, a great sequence of postures and Juliet's calm and pleasant voice and manner.

I'm happy to say that this was a great purchase. I'm looking forward waking up earlier than usual to do some yoga.",1298160000,11,765,4.528985507246377
8405535,5,B003TY0FMM,"I have been using this DVD for some time now. What I enjoy most is the ability to pick a routine to balance any issues for any particular day. If I am feeling stressed and scattered I'll slow things down with the Vata routine. If I am working a little to hard in the week I'll twist out the stress with the Pitta routine. Whatever I need the DVD provides. Plus it has such an impressive collection of other techniques to help balance your constitution. Much more than I ever expected. I love these routines as they allow me to pick one short session for those busy days or combine them for a longer routine. Overall, it has been a very useful addition to my practice.",1297900800,3,667,4.301587301587301
8405536,4,B003TY0FMM,"I like to be able to take care of myself.  I like to feel well and maximize that feeling of wellness.  This video supports my ability to be well by having a home practice.  It is an excellent investment in one's health and even one's happiness and outlook.  It is full of information about the doshas.  It has three routines that have different effects on one's energy level.  They each are about 20 minutes.  With even somewhat consistent use and incorporating other daily routines, this way of taking care of yourself is pleasurable in the execution and in the after effects. I aplaud Juliet for providing such an array of services, including this video for home pratice.  I can't help but love those who are so giving of themselves so that others may be well in such a wholistic manner.  Such a generous offering by Juliet, and approved by Dr. Vasant Lad!!  Namaste to Juliet and to those who read this review!",1292371200,6,913,4.580246913580247
8405537,5,B003TY0FMM,"As a yoga teacher and Ayurvedic practitioner, I love this DVD. It is a perfect tool for home practice. I use it myself, because it's nice to follow another teacher's lead, and it is especially nice in the cold winter months since the DVD is shot in outside beside the ocean. The visuals, music, and Juliet's voice are very calming, which is perfect for a yoga practice. I also really enjoy the sections that describe the Doshas (body types) in more detail. It is a great primer on Ayurvedic principles and is nice offering to my clients for their reference at home.",1291593600,,565,4.549019607843137
