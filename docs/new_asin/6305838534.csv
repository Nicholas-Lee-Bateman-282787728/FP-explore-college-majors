7898088,4,6305838534,"Once again another of the Naxos range of Musical Journey DVDs has proved to be very enjoyable. The photography as usual is superb and we are taken around the Southern Tyrol in Italy while Symphony #40 is playing, but for  the remainder of the disk, the ""journey"" is around Innsbruck in  Austria. This is just a bit surprising considering that all the pieces in  this collection are composed by Mozart who was born in Salzburg which is  just a short 100 miles to the east of Innsbruck. Some views of the old city  where his house is situated as well as the house itself would have surely  been appropriate. Nevertheless, what we are shown is very nice  indeed.
One word of criticism is that all the DVDs seem to be only 56  minutes in length. Considering how much will go on a DVD, this seems to be  a bit miserly by Naxos, especially when one realises that many, if not most  Naxos audio CDs run longer than 56 minutes.",964051200,7,919,4.384615384615385
