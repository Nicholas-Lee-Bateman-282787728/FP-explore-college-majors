3152265,5,B001662FKA,"Ah, Lucky Star.. an excellent anime for those just looking for complete random comedy and is full of parodies. The anime follows the life of high school girls, one of them being an otaku (just like I am, but I'm not as hard core as Konata Izumi is).

[...] was excellent with shipping when I pre-ordered this a little over a month ago. By the time it was officially released, I got the the box set in 2 days, using the free shipping option. I was rather surprised, and glad about how fast it actually got here. Everything was in great condition, even the shirt was. (bit big for me though XD)

Lucky Star isn't for everyone, but I'm sure there are many people who like animes like these.",1212537600,2,687,4.317829457364341
3152266,5,B001662FKA,"The best review is one that tells you exactly what you're getting:

I was quite surprised at just how well made physically the items i the set are. The box itself has a lip so the DVD's don't fall out (as in i can literally hold it upside down with the one disc it it and nothing will move.) as well as coming with a ribbon to pull them out if it proves troublesome, and art EVERYWHERE, even inside the box. The CD's are excellent, with lyrics in the insert and nice art. the coronet screenwipe is interesting, and a nice complementary novelty. The shirt is nice, good quality (though if i ever wore it in public i'd be called MANY things.) The DVD case is a special edition (which means it has alternate artwork) that is pretty cool, and comes with liner notes as said above so you can fully understand all of the humor. The show itself, is as said before, love it or hate it, but if you're buying the disc, you like it.",1210982400,9,921,4.203389830508475

3152269,5,B001662FKA,"This is by far, one of the best ""limited"" deals for one of the best anime series, ever.  The T-Shirt is XL, and I'm going to wear it to work tomorrow.  I expect odd looks, considering I'm a guy hahaha!  The screen wipe (chocolate coronet) is just adorable - there's no way I'd have the heart to get it dirty from my screen.  The music cd's are good - The opening song is full length, accompanied by another song which is just as enjoyable (also includes off-vocal versions).  The second music cd is based off Konata - it's an enjoyable listen.  For the dvd, Japanese vocal is preserved (with English subtitles!), and the English voice track...well I don't think I could watch it because I'm used to the Japanese vocals.  So yes, the entire package is a definate 5 *'s.

For the anime itself, you'll either love it or hate it.  I recommend watching ""The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi"", as this anime makes ""several"" references to it.  Lucky Star also references Japanese life and culture, so it may be difficult to make many connections, but fortunately, included with the DVD is a list of what things mean in Japanese culture!  Good job on this one.",1210204800,39,1149,4.556097560975609
3152270,5,B001662FKA,"I have been heavy into anime for ten years now, and my favorite animes such as: Black Lagoon, Claymore, Ergo Proxy, etc.  (adult themes).

Lucky Star is a cute-sy style anime, and yes, it may not be for everyone.

I agree it will be enjoyed more by fans of anime, due to all the references to existing anime.  But this anime was not solely targeted to otaku/fans...anyone can enjoy it.

I can't get into the english dub.  It doesn't do the show justice. The ""cuteness"" of the japanese voice actors matches the characters perfectly - English voice actors can't come close.  But that is just my opinion.

Regarding the other comment posted here from Guillermo (or whatever) April 24th, 2008:  I couldn't disagree more with you.  Plus, if you think Cromartie High School is good anime, that says much about your taste.  That is the most horrible joke of an anime ever released.  I understand completely there is no arguing taste - but cmon, you're joking, right?

Bottom line: regardless what level anime fan you are --> if you enjoy watching anime and can appreciate the japanese audio with english subs, don't miss Lucky Star, you really should check it out - you will have a great deal of fun.

3152271,5,B001662FKA,"When I first laid eyes on Lucky Star, I really had no idea what I was watching.  From the obscure yet (amazing!) opening theme, questions will rise to the head very quickly as you try to assume what this series is made of. Of course, as I watched Lucky Star, I grew more and more into it, and so first impressions affected me no longer. Set to the everyday lives of four Highschool girls, Lucky Star is a comedy anime which questions the aspects of everything. Each episode is composed of multiple short scenes (like Peanuts or Garfield) in which they talk about or refer to specific subjects (commonly refering to pop culture), and many times you find that you can relate to what they are talking about, this is why I enjoyed it so much. There are tons of referances to other anime and videogames, and this is why I assume it gained popularity so quickly as it was dubbed the most popular anime of 2007 in Japan.

 However, I can foresee that the English version might not appeal to as many viewers, probably because many of the jokes and subjects that are popular in Lucky Star pertain to the Japanese culture. Of course this doesn't mean that casual anime fans will dislike the show, as I know people who do not even watch anime who loved the show.  Yet, I believe very few people know what it is so far, and so its possible only the huge anime fans will know it even exists.  I've heard that the English voice cast was good, and I look forward to discovering exactly how good they are.  I was incredibly pleased with the Japanese cast, as Hirano Aya did a flawless job on Konata Izumi, the main character.

I also hear that the manga is coming to America; under Tokyo Pop.  This I really look forward to, as the manga was done in 4-panel comic strips throughout each volume, and has the same comedy from the show, if not better. Keep a lookout for it!

All in all, I believe that people who find the series will enjoy it, Lucky Star kind of has something for everyone.  However, I will admit that the first episode can be a bad first impression, and in my opinion I found that after that episode, the series escalates into a great show.  The characters are designed well, the humor is fresh, the animation is well done, and despite american appeal, I believe it has surprises in store for any anime fan. 5/5",1209081600,17,2311,4.388758782201405
3152272,1,B001662FKA,"Beware this review is for the people that don't know what LUCKY STAR is, not for its fanatics, remember it's your money.

Lucky Star is another parody show that combines the comedy of Azumanga Daioh, Cromartie High School & Excel Saga . The story ( if there is one ) is about four friends in school living their normal lifes. Yep, it sounds stupid but that is all.

The English version has a good cast of voice overs Wendee Lee ( AKA Haruhi ) as Konata, Karen Strassman (AKA Ren from Dears) as Miyuki, Michelle Ruff ( AKA Miharu fom Girls Bravo ) and Kari Wahlgren ( AKA Haruhara from FLCL) as Kagami, but some actors need more passion for their characters , I though kagami was going to sound like Haruko Haruhara from FLCL or like Jeane from No More Heroes but nooo, the Japanese track is as always perfect.

Pros:
+ Fluent animation.
+ The English version of Stukasa and Miyuki are surprisingly similar to the original seiyu.
+ Character design.
+ large amounts of otaku humor.
+ Lucky Channel
+ There is always the Japanese track.

Cons:
- Dialog.
- The show became famous because the use of many anime references, not for originality.
- The English version of Konata, Kagami and Akira don't sound like the Japanese seiyu
- The characters look like 10 years-old but they are actually 16 to 18.
- There is no ending theme, at the end of each episode a song from another anime or show is preformed by one of the characters in karaoke style, some people might find this funny but it becomes annoying after a while.
- Some jokes are not that funny.

I'm a big fan of Kyoto Animation, shows like Air, Haruhi Suzumiya and Kanon are top-notch but this show is just over-rated, I recommend better comedies like Ninja Nonsense, Pani Poni Dash, Cromartie High School, School Rumble, Strawberry Marshmallow, Ah My Goddess, or read a book, but Lucky Star is just a very MEHHH show, 1 out 5.",1208995200,9,1882,4.475218658892128

The characters are pretty flat, nothing really happens, and the only interesting part of the show is the ""Lucky Channel"" bits where two characters with actual personalities comment on each episode.  Sure, there's a time and a place for slice of life anime, but this one fails at it because the characters aren't deep enough to make their slice of life appealing.

3152296,5,B001662FKA,"Lucky Star is an anime where 4 girls talk about casual themes. We have the geek girl Konata, the tsundere (yes, I dare it :D) Kagami, the shy & clumsy Tsukasa & the smart moe Miyuki. Those girls gained cult status faster than a rocket and made the series a whole success, pushing Lucky Star from a four panels magazine manga stripe to an anime.
There is no in between, if you like the series you like it, if you hate it, you hate it.

So what's special about this box edition?
It contains the first four episodes of Lucky Star on a dvd, the theme cd single Motteke! Sailor Fuku, the cd single Lucky Star Character Song collection feat. Konata Izumi, a t-shirt with the girl's school winter uniform printed on it (careful with wearing, it's smaller than it looks) and a screen swipe in a tiny chocolate cornet formed bag.

I ordered the collector's version of the first three sets so far, with no hope of being able to actually wear the t-shirts that were included. To my surprise they were all XL and good quality shirts. This made me even happier with this purchase and I will be getting the rest of the series collector versions soon. The CD's are also a good bonus, as well as the hard box that comes with the first set, which has enough room to put the other dvd cases in as well. This is great as the rest come in not quite as convenient or sturdy boxes, but are still great sets nonetheless. Very great deal for the price as the dvd's would be at least as much for most anime (if not more) and the shirts are well worth the price alone.

All of the episodes are terrific and of course very funny.

3152312,5,B001662FKA,"so i chose to buy the LE instead of the box set because, 1. the box set was 39.99 and the LE averaged around $10 apiece. 2. the LE comes with A LOT of cool stuff. this vol is by far the best by way of extras. it comes with the dvd, t-shirt (summer uniform), 2 cds, a lucky star screen wipe, and a chocolate cornet plushy. so if you buy the 5 vols of the LE and the 6th SE at around 10 bucks apiece, your only paying 20 dollars more and you get 5 shirts and some cds. sounds good to me.

as for my order...
it was a lot better than i was expecting. the box (one of the best parts) was really well made, and magnetically seals closed. the art on the box is really nice, and the product description on the back peals off to reveal more. the cds really only have 2 songs each, which is kind of sad. the shirt is XL, but since you probably won't want to where it out in public too much, it shouldnt matter if its a little too big. the cornet is a little smaller than i expected, but in the end its good because im going to attach it to my keys. the dvd comes with a page that explains the cultural and obscure references made in the show.

if your a fan of the show, you'll be very happy. if your just getting into it, its a cool and cheap way to see if you like it. if you don't like the show your probable insane and should seek help.

My boyfriend had to open it for me because I was so entranced with admiration, when I finally got to dissecting the box of goodies I found the true to its XL size T-shirt all neatly wrapped up, two CD's that contain four tracks on each (one is based on the opening song/ knee-socks remix with off-vocal tracks too, while the other CD features sung in a horribly cute manner by the much loved otaku, Konata), the DVD containing the first four episodes with a drawn picture of Kagami in her shrine outfit by Konata as the cover, and of course the  adorable pun widely known by lucky star fans: the chocolate cornet shaped screen-wiper. In my package everything besides the t-shirt was in its original plastic wrap.
I love EVERYTHING that came in the box, but the size of chocolate cornet was a tad disappointing. It's actually a tiny plush with the cloth (screen wipe) with Lucky Star printed on it folded neatly with a cell phone string attached to it, and that string is threaded through the top of the cornet plush. Essentially one could take out the cloth, put it somewhere memorable and have the cornet sitting in a cute place such as on top of a desk.
Despite my finickiness of the cornet, the price of the product, the product itself, and the shipping: Excellent.

If you're a Lucky Star fan, why are you hesitating to buy this limited edition? It's completely worth it for such a great price!",1332460800,,1862,4.568862275449102

3152316,5,B001662FKA,"Those familiar with Lucky Star will get exactly what they want out of this DVD.  It contains the first 4 episodes of the anime, with both English and the original Japanese voices and both English and Japanese subtitles.  It also contains plenty of extras, including a text-less version of the opening theme song with lyrics so you can learn and sing along with it and the amusing 'Adventures of Minoru Shiraishi' series.  The case itself is a simple white color and all the text on the box is brightly colored so it pops and is easy to read.

If you're unfamiliar with the series, Lucky Star was originally a manga short series written by Kagami Yoshimizu published in issues of Comptiq starting back in 2004, and it eventually went on to become its own fully published book series and then the anime you see before you.  It is a series of loose stories mostly following Konata Izumi, twins Kagami and Tsukasa Hiiragi, and Miyuki Takara, four friends attending high school in the city of Kasukabe.  Their conversations range from anime and manga to how to properly eat a chocolate cornet.  Always light-hearted and amusing, it's highly recommended for people who want a light, feel-good anime to watch and are perhaps feeling a bit lethargic.",1296259200,,1242,4.775700934579439

3152320,4,B001662FKA,"Alright, first thing I have to say about this anime- it is one of the *few* that I can actually stand to watch in English! The voice acting is very good and fits the characters well (except that one recycled voice of the various cashier ladies).

It is very fun, and I miss it dearly. I mean, I finished the series- and I own it- but it is never the same to simply re-watch it. I laughed, I cried (not really), and I enjoyed every second of it. It is a very random series that offers a plot that is questioned by many, meaning it either seems like it [the plot] doesn't exist, or it is fragmented and difficult to identify. However, it works with this series. Basically, the story follows Konata and her friends through highschool and all of their other activities, discussions, and dilemmas. There are countless references to other anime series in this one, and creative running gags speckle the premise.

""Lucky Star"" is one of those series that are fun to watch for the sake of laughs and, dare I say, ""lulz"". I feel it deserves an award for being the best anime to watch while either completely out of it, in a bad mood, or just bored. It requires very little devotion to attention as, again, there really isn't a deep storyline. However, once in a while, one of the characters makes a smart comment or action that is just hilarious but difficult to spot. The one thing that seems both repetitive and uniquely valuable is the rotation of different conversations that the characters have that can last quite a while.

The art is alright for the kind of anime it is. If it was somethng other than a comedy, I would be a little bit unimpressed.

Why didn't I give it a 5 out of 5 stars? Well, as much as I love Lucky Star, and although I will never forget about it as the wonderful series it is, I just felt as if there was something missing when I watched it. Also, I don't exactly feel the need to re-view the entire series again, as it was easy to understand and it would not make it any more or less of a series to me if I did so. Furthermore, it simply is *not* my favorite series. It is my favorite in terms of merchandise, memes, legacy, and characters, but I would not put it on the absolute top of my list. I am *not* advising to blow off this series, or to decide not to like it before you watch. In fact, I strongly suggest that you do watch it all the way through!

As the icing on the cake, a plushy chocolate cornet with a screen wiper (watch out it doesn't fall out!).
But again the shirt isn't satisfying... But the rest (especially the box art) makes up for it.

3152322,3,B001662FKA,"I love Lucky Star as it progresses. Even though it starts off as a non sequitur anime of everyday jokes, it turns into a fascinating character study of the everyday lives of Japanese high school girls.

However, it starts off rather slowly, with a couple of bland jokes about Japanese food and eating habits. Anime fans might get especially bored of the jokes about the right way to eat a chocolate cornett.

But as the series goes on, the anime and video game jokes start to take over. The main character, the blue-haired high-school girl Konata Izumi, is an MMORPG addict who just barely manages to get good enough grades. She just can't stop fantasizing her friends as her favorite anime character characters, and some of her bizarre fantasies make for some great parodies of Street Fighter II and other various video games and anime.

Kagami Hiragi, the genius of the four girls who hang out together, tries as hard as she can to get Konata to stop slacking off. But no matter how hard Konata struggles to do her work, she somehow ends up crawling back to her MMORPG for a long break.

Of course, one also has to wonder why Konata is also into dating simulation games, many of which offer men sexual fantasies. Well, Konata's mother isn't around--she passed away. And her father likes playing them, so she got into them too. Konata and her friends have plenty of fun discussing whether an addiction to dating games is a healthy habit for Konata.

As one can see, this series is a zany mix of anime and video game jokes, some of which work and some of which shot over my head. However, whenever Konata and the gang pull off their dating game jokes, I can't help but laugh.

Probably the best part of the series, however, is the Lucky Channel section at the end of each episode. Featuring the cute Akira Kogami and her male assistant, Minoru Shiraishi. They're supposed to give informative bios on the main characters, but somehow their conversations turn to Akira's grouchy rant over her miniscule salary and the awful life of a Japanese diva. Akira's attitude usually takes a complete 180, from cute to a grumpy, angry moper. Sometimes Minoru really has to tread lightly, or Akira will take her anger out on Minoru.

""Lucky Star"" has an especially large amount of extras. First, ""The Adventures of Minoru Shiraishi"" documents Minoru's journey around Japan, as he sings anime songs and dances in the most inconvenient places. His work is for an important cause, really! However, anime viewers won't get to see his ending credits performances until volume three of ""Lucky Star."" Second, this DVD features an awesome karaoke version of the opening theme, with Japanese characters and everything.

All in all ""Lucky Star"" is a great slice-of-life series, as long as people don't get too turned off by the first few episodes. This series is best seen with Japanese subtitles, rather than the decent, but slightly subpar American dubs.",1242518400,,2933,4.77120315581854

3152324,5,B001662FKA,"Lucky Star is a unique delight in anime.  Where most series follow the standard trend of every other show in existence of following a long, strung-out and sometimes convoluted plotline, Lucky Star subscribes to the K.I.S.S. method, or more appropriately, the Seinfeld approach.  Essentially, it's an anime about nothing.

Following the lives of four Japanese teenage girls (Yes, they're all 17-ish despite their prepubescent look), Lucky Star keeps things high-paced with short segments strung together in each episode, usually focused around the four girls talking about aspects of their lives, their dreams, their questions and thoughts, or just overall goofing around.  It never really follows any sort of singular plotline or progression, save for the movement of the year, but the dialogue and antics of the characters keep you fascinated, and the pacing and timing remains high, making sure that you don't get bored.

The majority of the series' laughs come in the form of references and jabs to anime, gaming and the resultant cultures, but there's something here for everyone regardless of their level of anime fandom.  In Lucky Star, we get an honest and adorable glimpse into the lives and thoughts of young girls growing up in Japan, and all at once the viewer gains insight as well as finds similarities.  Before long, you'll wonder who you are and who amongst your circle of friends fits the mold of the show's characters.  Each episode wraps up with Lucky Channel, featuring the antics of fallen diva Akira and her assistant-cum-punching bag Shiraishi, which almost always provides side-splitting moments.

Huge kudos has to go to the localization team and English vocal talent, who retain the charm and cute level of the characters they voice, though many will still proclaim that the Japanese cast cannot be touched.  Better still, the references to Japanese culture and lifestyles remain intact--a brave and wise move by Bandai Entertainment.  They could have easily gone the 4Kids route and attempt to re-mold the series to better suit American trends and tastes, but here all things are left intact, preserving the colorful and insightful nature of the show.

Even if you're a passing fan of anime, you owe it to yourself to check out Lucky Star.  It's funny, it's whimsical, it's fascinating, and it's all around plain unchecked fun.  Everyone could use a dose of kawaii now and then.",1231804800,16,2404,5.099489795918367

However I wanted to point out that if you expect for the subtitles to be on par with the fansubs, they're not. They feel rather incomplete. The english dub is horrible. It destroys the charachter's personalities in addition to making alot of the jokes bland. Odds are that you will probably go back to watching the well done fansubs and this will sit on your shelf as a collectors item and nothing more. If you're okay with that, then it is a nice purchase with tons of goodies. Although I doubt anyone will listen to the CDs more than once or wear the shirt outside of perhaps an anime convention. The screenwipe on the other hand is awesome. It's kind of hard to tell what it really is from online pictures but it's a little stuffed plushy pastry. Within the pastry is what looks like nylon chocolate attatched to a string, however upon pulling on the chocolate you discover that it is actually an unfoldable flag with a big lucky star logo on it. Possibly the best extra in the bunch.

I rated this 5 stars because the show itself (no matter how butchered the translation) is one of the most creative and fun to watch anime titles ever made.

3152329,5,B001662FKA,"I wasn't at first certain what to make of Lucky Star. Like Strawberry Marshmallow and Azimanga Dioah, this is one of those odd Japanese series about nothing. I bought the first three volumes at one time on the strength of a review on an anime podcase. After watching only the first disk, I wondered what I had got myself into. The first four episodes were almost terrible - just a lot of anime talking heads (faithful to the four-panel gag format of the original manga but not good anime). Happily for the viewer, though, after the first four episodes, the director was replaced and then we get to see the girls going out and doing things. The art is extremely odd. The girls are supposedly 17 year old high school juniors, but are drawn as grade school girls, hence the ""loli"" reference in the title of this review. The animation is excellent, the voice acting superior. And, unlike Azimanga Dioah, we actually get to see the girls' parents and families. The story revolves around four girls, immature Konata, an otaku who spends all her time with manga, anime and video games, twin sisters Kagami and Tsukasa, and pretty Miyuki, the ""Belldandy"" of the group. We see slices of the girl's home life, school life and daily life through short segments. One whole episode is about nothing more than the proper way to eat a chocolate cornet. The format begins to work after the fifth episode (on the second volume), and by the end of the third volume, I was hoping for more, which is not bad considering I nearly gave up on it after watching the first disk. If you can get past the first four episodes, you will probably get hooked on this series.

I can't get into the english dub.  It doesn't do the show justice. The ""cuteness"" of the japanese voice actors matches the characters perfectly - English voice actors can't come close.  But that is just my opinion.

Regarding the other comment posted here from Guillermo (or whatever) April 24th, 2008:  I couldn't disagree more with you.  Plus, if you think Cromartie High School is good anime, that says much about your taste.  That is the most horrible joke of an anime ever released.

3386768,5,B001662FKA,"When I first laid eyes on Lucky Star, I really had no idea what I was watching.  From the obscure yet (amazing!) opening theme, questions will rise to the head very quickly as you try to assume what this series is made of. Of course, as I watched Lucky Star, I grew more and more into it, and so first impressions affected me no longer. Set to the everyday lives of four Highschool girls, Lucky Star is a comedy anime which questions the aspects of everything. Each episode is composed of multiple short scenes (like Peanuts or Garfield) in which they talk about or refer to specific subjects (commonly refering to pop culture), and many times you find that you can relate to what they are talking about, this is why I enjoyed it so much. There are tons of referances to other anime and videogames, and this is why I assume it gained popularity so quickly as it was dubbed the most popular anime of 2007 in Japan.

 However, I can foresee that the English version might not appeal to as many viewers, probably because many of the jokes and subjects that are popular in Lucky Star pertain to the Japanese culture. Of course this doesn't mean that casual anime fans will dislike the show, as I know people who do not even watch anime who loved the show.  Yet, I believe very few people know what it is so far, and so its possible only the huge anime fans will know it even exists.  I've heard that the English voice cast was good, and I look forward to discovering exactly how good they are.  I was incredibly pleased with the Japanese cast, as Hirano Aya did a flawless job on Konata Izumi, the main character.

I also hear that the manga is coming to America; under Tokyo Pop.  This I really look forward to, as the manga was done in 4-panel comic strips throughout each volume, and has the same comedy from the show, if not better. Keep a lookout for it!

All in all, I believe that people who find the series will enjoy it, Lucky Star kind of has something for everyone.  However, I will admit that the first episode can be a bad first impression, and in my opinion I found that after that episode, the series escalates into a great show.  The characters are designed well, the humor is fresh, the animation is well done, and despite american appeal, I believe it has surprises in store for any anime fan. 5/5",1209081600,17,2311,4.388758782201405
3386769,1,B001662FKA,"Beware this review is for the people that don't know what LUCKY STAR is, not for its fanatics, remember it's your money.

Lucky Star is another parody show that combines the comedy of Azumanga Daioh, Cromartie High School & Excel Saga . The story ( if there is one ) is about four friends in school living their normal lifes. Yep, it sounds stupid but that is all.

The English version has a good cast of voice overs Wendee Lee ( AKA Haruhi ) as Konata, Karen Strassman (AKA Ren from Dears) as Miyuki, Michelle Ruff ( AKA Miharu fom Girls Bravo ) and Kari Wahlgren ( AKA Haruhara from FLCL) as Kagami, but some actors need more passion for their characters , I though kagami was going to sound like Haruko Haruhara from FLCL or like Jeane from No More Heroes but nooo, the Japanese track is as always perfect.

Pros:
+ Fluent animation.
+ The English version of Stukasa and Miyuki are surprisingly similar to the original seiyu.
+ Character design.
+ large amounts of otaku humor.
+ Lucky Channel
+ There is always the Japanese track.

Cons:
- Dialog.
- The show became famous because the use of many anime references, not for originality.
- The English version of Konata, Kagami and Akira don't sound like the Japanese seiyu
- The characters look like 10 years-old but they are actually 16 to 18.
- There is no ending theme, at the end of each episode a song from another anime or show is preformed by one of the characters in karaoke style, some people might find this funny but it becomes annoying after a while.
- Some jokes are not that funny.

I'm a big fan of Kyoto Animation, shows like Air, Haruhi Suzumiya and Kanon are top-notch but this show is just over-rated, I recommend better comedies like Ninja Nonsense, Pani Poni Dash, Cromartie High School, School Rumble, Strawberry Marshmallow, Ah My Goddess, or read a book, but Lucky Star is just a very MEHHH show, 1 out 5.",1208995200,9,1882,4.475218658892128

The characters are pretty flat, nothing really happens, and the only interesting part of the show is the ""Lucky Channel"" bits where two characters with actual personalities comment on each episode.  Sure, there's a time and a place for slice of life anime, but this one fails at it because the characters aren't deep enough to make their slice of life appealing.

We have the geek girl Konata, the tsundere (yes, I dare it :D) Kagami, the shy & clumsy Tsukasa & the smart moe Miyuki. Those girls gained cult status faster than a rocket and made the series a whole success, pushing Lucky Star from a four panels magazine manga stripe to an anime.
There is no in between, if you like the series you like it, if you hate it, you hate it.

So what's special about this box edition?
It contains the first four episodes of Lucky Star on a dvd, the theme cd single Motteke! Sailor Fuku, the cd single Lucky Star Character Song collection feat. Konata Izumi, a t-shirt with the girl's school winter uniform printed on it (careful with wearing, it's smaller than it looks) and a screen swipe in a tiny chocolate cornet formed bag.

The CD's are also a good bonus, as well as the hard box that comes with the first set, which has enough room to put the other dvd cases in as well. This is great as the rest come in not quite as convenient or sturdy boxes, but are still great sets nonetheless. Very great deal for the price as the dvd's would be at least as much for most anime (if not more) and the shirts are well worth the price alone.

-The dvd itself
-2 CD's
-A chocolate cornet screen wiper
It all comes in an outer tin box :)

-Efforts and Results
-Various People

All of the episodes are terrific and of course very funny.

The first is Motteke! Sailor-fuku and has 4 tracks including the theme itself.
The second is titled Lucky Star character song volume 001. It features 5 various sung by the voice actors.

There is a character in this series that is obsessed with the Haruhi Suzumiya anime. I think that's kinda funny since the voice actor was the same as in that series too. There's not really much to tell about Lucky Star, but even if that's true it's still pretty cute and funny. You may like if you give it a shot.",1351728000,2,572,4.563106796116505

3386809,5,B001662FKA,"so i chose to buy the LE instead of the box set because, 1. the box set was 39.99 and the LE averaged around $10 apiece. 2. the LE comes with A LOT of cool stuff. this vol is by far the best by way of extras. it comes with the dvd, t-shirt (summer uniform), 2 cds, a lucky star screen wipe, and a chocolate cornet plushy. so if you buy the 5 vols of the LE and the 6th SE at around 10 bucks apiece, your only paying 20 dollars more and you get 5 shirts and some cds. sounds good to me.

as for my order...
it was a lot better than i was expecting. the box (one of the best parts) was really well made, and magnetically seals closed. the art on the box is really nice, and the product description on the back peals off to reveal more. the cds really only have 2 songs each, which is kind of sad. the shirt is XL, but since you probably won't want to where it out in public too much, it shouldnt matter if its a little too big. the cornet is a little smaller than i expected, but in the end its good because im going to attach it to my keys. the dvd comes with a page that explains the cultural and obscure references made in the show.

if your a fan of the show, you'll be very happy. if your just getting into it, its a cool and cheap way to see if you like it. if you don't like the show your probable insane and should seek help.

You must have already have made your mind up about the show otherwise you wouldn't be buying something Limited Edition, right? So let me review the product overall:

The art box is absolutely wonderful with amazing quality. My boyfriend had to open it for me because I was so entranced with admiration, when I finally got to dissecting the box of goodies I found the true to its XL size T-shirt all neatly wrapped up, two CD's that contain four tracks on each (one is based on the opening song/ knee-socks remix with off-vocal tracks too, while the other CD features sung in a horribly cute manner by the much loved otaku, Konata), the DVD containing the first four episodes with a drawn picture of Kagami in her shrine outfit by Konata as the cover, and of course the  adorable pun widely known by lucky star fans: the chocolate cornet shaped screen-wiper. In my package everything besides the t-shirt was in its original plastic wrap.
I love EVERYTHING that came in the box, but the size of chocolate cornet was a tad disappointing. It's actually a tiny plush with the cloth (screen wipe) with Lucky Star printed on it folded neatly with a cell phone string attached to it, and that string is threaded through the top of the cornet plush. Essentially one could take out the cloth, put it somewhere memorable and have the cornet sitting in a cute place such as on top of a desk.
Despite my finickiness of the cornet, the price of the product, the product itself, and the shipping: Excellent.

If you're a Lucky Star fan, why are you hesitating to buy this limited edition? It's completely worth it for such a great price!",1332460800,,1862,4.568862275449102

3386813,5,B001662FKA,"Those familiar with Lucky Star will get exactly what they want out of this DVD.  It contains the first 4 episodes of the anime, with both English and the original Japanese voices and both English and Japanese subtitles.  It also contains plenty of extras, including a text-less version of the opening theme song with lyrics so you can learn and sing along with it and the amusing 'Adventures of Minoru Shiraishi' series.  The case itself is a simple white color and all the text on the box is brightly colored so it pops and is easy to read.

If you're unfamiliar with the series, Lucky Star was originally a manga short series written by Kagami Yoshimizu published in issues of Comptiq starting back in 2004, and it eventually went on to become its own fully published book series and then the anime you see before you.  It is a series of loose stories mostly following Konata Izumi, twins Kagami and Tsukasa Hiiragi, and Miyuki Takara, four friends attending high school in the city of Kasukabe.  Their conversations range from anime and manga to how to properly eat a chocolate cornet.

3386817,4,B001662FKA,"Alright, first thing I have to say about this anime- it is one of the *few* that I can actually stand to watch in English! The voice acting is very good and fits the characters well (except that one recycled voice of the various cashier ladies).

It is very fun, and I miss it dearly. I mean, I finished the series- and I own it- but it is never the same to simply re-watch it. I laughed, I cried (not really), and I enjoyed every second of it. It is a very random series that offers a plot that is questioned by many, meaning it either seems like it [the plot] doesn't exist, or it is fragmented and difficult to identify. However, it works with this series. Basically, the story follows Konata and her friends through highschool and all of their other activities, discussions, and dilemmas. There are countless references to other anime series in this one, and creative running gags speckle the premise.

""Lucky Star"" is one of those series that are fun to watch for the sake of laughs and, dare I say, ""lulz"". I feel it deserves an award for being the best anime to watch while either completely out of it, in a bad mood, or just bored. It requires very little devotion to attention as, again, there really isn't a deep storyline. However, once in a while, one of the characters makes a smart comment or action that is just hilarious but difficult to spot. The one thing that seems both repetitive and uniquely valuable is the rotation of different conversations that the characters have that can last quite a while.

The art is alright for the kind of anime it is. If it was somethng other than a comedy, I would be a little bit unimpressed.

Why didn't I give it a 5 out of 5 stars? Well, as much as I love Lucky Star, and although I will never forget about it as the wonderful series it is, I just felt as if there was something missing when I watched it. Also, I don't exactly feel the need to re-view the entire series again, as it was easy to understand and it would not make it any more or less of a series to me if I did so. Furthermore, it simply is *not* my favorite series. It is my favorite in terms of merchandise, memes, legacy, and characters, but I would not put it on the absolute top of my list. I am *not* advising to blow off this series, or to decide not to like it before you watch. In fact, I strongly suggest that you do watch it all the way through!

Buy this series. View it, love it, want more of it.",1252713600,,2430,4.239740820734341
3386818,5,B001662FKA,"It'll be hard for any box art ever to 'wow' me again after i've seen this one as not a single side of this box is left alone, neither on the inside or outside. The inside is then used to store the 6 DVDs. In it are 2 CDs (opening themes and Konata character CD) each with some interesting songs and the DVD of course. As the icing on the cake, a plushy chocolate cornet with a screen wiper (watch out it doesn't fall out!).
But again the shirt isn't satisfying... But the rest (especially the box art) makes up for it.

Well worth the investment :3",1247011200,,548,4.121495327102804
3386819,3,B001662FKA,"I love Lucky Star as it progresses. Even though it starts off as a non sequitur anime of everyday jokes, it turns into a fascinating character study of the everyday lives of Japanese high school girls.

However, it starts off rather slowly, with a couple of bland jokes about Japanese food and eating habits. Anime fans might get especially bored of the jokes about the right way to eat a chocolate cornett.

But as the series goes on, the anime and video game jokes start to take over. The main character, the blue-haired high-school girl Konata Izumi, is an MMORPG addict who just barely manages to get good enough grades. She just can't stop fantasizing her friends as her favorite anime character characters, and some of her bizarre fantasies make for some great parodies of Street Fighter II and other various video games and anime.

Kagami Hiragi, the genius of the four girls who hang out together, tries as hard as she can to get Konata to stop slacking off. But no matter how hard Konata struggles to do her work, she somehow ends up crawling back to her MMORPG for a long break.

Of course, one also has to wonder why Konata is also into dating simulation games, many of which offer men sexual fantasies. Well, Konata's mother isn't around--she passed away. And her father likes playing them, so she got into them too. Konata and her friends have plenty of fun discussing whether an addiction to dating games is a healthy habit for Konata.

As one can see, this series is a zany mix of anime and video game jokes, some of which work and some of which shot over my head. However, whenever Konata and the gang pull off their dating game jokes, I can't help but laugh.

Probably the best part of the series, however, is the Lucky Channel section at the end of each episode. Featuring the cute Akira Kogami and her male assistant, Minoru Shiraishi. They're supposed to give informative bios on the main characters, but somehow their conversations turn to Akira's grouchy rant over her miniscule salary and the awful life of a Japanese diva. Akira's attitude usually takes a complete 180, from cute to a grumpy, angry moper. Sometimes Minoru really has to tread lightly, or Akira will take her anger out on Minoru.

""Lucky Star"" has an especially large amount of extras. First, ""The Adventures of Minoru Shiraishi"" documents Minoru's journey around Japan, as he sings anime songs and dances in the most inconvenient places. His work is for an important cause, really! However, anime viewers won't get to see his ending credits performances until volume three of ""Lucky Star."" Second, this DVD features an awesome karaoke version of the opening theme, with Japanese characters and everything.

All in all ""Lucky Star"" is a great slice-of-life series, as long as people don't get too turned off by the first few episodes. This series is best seen with Japanese subtitles, rather than the decent, but slightly subpar American dubs.",1242518400,,2933,4.77120315581854

3386821,5,B001662FKA,"Lucky Star is a unique delight in anime.  Where most series follow the standard trend of every other show in existence of following a long, strung-out and sometimes convoluted plotline, Lucky Star subscribes to the K.I.S.S. method, or more appropriately, the Seinfeld approach.  Essentially, it's an anime about nothing.

Following the lives of four Japanese teenage girls (Yes, they're all 17-ish despite their prepubescent look), Lucky Star keeps things high-paced with short segments strung together in each episode, usually focused around the four girls talking about aspects of their lives, their dreams, their questions and thoughts, or just overall goofing around.  It never really follows any sort of singular plotline or progression, save for the movement of the year, but the dialogue and antics of the characters keep you fascinated, and the pacing and timing remains high, making sure that you don't get bored.

The majority of the series' laughs come in the form of references and jabs to anime, gaming and the resultant cultures, but there's something here for everyone regardless of their level of anime fandom.  In Lucky Star, we get an honest and adorable glimpse into the lives and thoughts of young girls growing up in Japan, and all at once the viewer gains insight as well as finds similarities.  Before long, you'll wonder who you are and who amongst your circle of friends fits the mold of the show's characters.  Each episode wraps up with Lucky Channel, featuring the antics of fallen diva Akira and her assistant-cum-punching bag Shiraishi, which almost always provides side-splitting moments.

Huge kudos has to go to the localization team and English vocal talent, who retain the charm and cute level of the characters they voice, though many will still proclaim that the Japanese cast cannot be touched.  Better still, the references to Japanese culture and lifestyles remain intact--a brave and wise move by Bandai Entertainment.  They could have easily gone the 4Kids route and attempt to re-mold the series to better suit American trends and tastes, but here all things are left intact, preserving the colorful and insightful nature of the show.

Even if you're a passing fan of anime, you owe it to yourself to check out Lucky Star.  It's funny, it's whimsical, it's fascinating, and it's all around plain unchecked fun.  Everyone could use a dose of kawaii now and then.",1231804800,16,2404,5.099489795918367

There are no important things in the stories.
But it is well presented Japanese high school days.
People call a person without Mr. and Ms.
Instead of Mr. or Ms., chan or san are used after the name.
It is explained in the notes in the package.
In japanese, speaking is a little slow.

3386823,5,B001662FKA,"Okay here is the deal, like it was previously stated, if you're looking at this then you obviously know what this series is all about and have your mind made up about it. However I wanted to point out that if you expect for the subtitles to be on par with the fansubs, they're not. They feel rather incomplete. The english dub is horrible. It destroys the charachter's personalities in addition to making alot of the jokes bland. Odds are that you will probably go back to watching the well done fansubs and this will sit on your shelf as a collectors item and nothing more. If you're okay with that, then it is a nice purchase with tons of goodies. Although I doubt anyone will listen to the CDs more than once or wear the shirt outside of perhaps an anime convention. The screenwipe on the other hand is awesome. It's kind of hard to tell what it really is from online pictures but it's a little stuffed plushy pastry. Within the pastry is what looks like nylon chocolate attatched to a string, however upon pulling on the chocolate you discover that it is actually an unfoldable flag with a big lucky star logo on it. Possibly the best extra in the bunch.

I rated this 5 stars because the show itself (no matter how butchered the translation) is one of the most creative and fun to watch anime titles ever made.

3386826,5,B001662FKA,"I wasn't at first certain what to make of Lucky Star. Like Strawberry Marshmallow and Azimanga Dioah, this is one of those odd Japanese series about nothing. I bought the first three volumes at one time on the strength of a review on an anime podcase. After watching only the first disk, I wondered what I had got myself into. The first four episodes were almost terrible - just a lot of anime talking heads (faithful to the four-panel gag format of the original manga but not good anime). Happily for the viewer, though, after the first four episodes, the director was replaced and then we get to see the girls going out and doing things. The art is extremely odd. The girls are supposedly 17 year old high school juniors, but are drawn as grade school girls, hence the ""loli"" reference in the title of this review. The animation is excellent, the voice acting superior. And, unlike Azimanga Dioah, we actually get to see the girls' parents and families. The story revolves around four girls, immature Konata, an otaku who spends all her time with manga, anime and video games, twin sisters Kagami and Tsukasa, and pretty Miyuki, the ""Belldandy"" of the group. We see slices of the girl's home life, school life and daily life through short segments. One whole episode is about nothing more than the proper way to eat a chocolate cornet. The format begins to work after the fifth episode (on the second volume), and by the end of the third volume, I was hoping for more, which is not bad considering I nearly gave up on it after watching the first disk. If you can get past the first four episodes, you will probably get hooked on this series. If you like this sort of anime, don't let this first disk put you off from enjoying the rest of the series.",1222387200,,1751,4.526813880126183
