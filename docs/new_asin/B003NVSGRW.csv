8401328,5,B003NVSGRW,"I liked this movie. It was kind of like the movie ""Heart and Souls"" with Robert Downey Jr. (USA) Honestly, the real reason to watch this movie is the romantic story line of the characters Roopi and Raj. Their friends are fun characters too. But the characters Roopi and Raj really drive this story. The actor who plays Raj - Sendhil Ramamurthy has a classic ""Cary Grant"" style. He is not just a handsome guy, he has a heart too. The actress who plays Roopi - Goldy Notay has a classic girl next door style that anyone can relate with. Don't get too upset about some of the events in the movie. Take it for what it is - A Comedy about life!",1478131200,,639,4.203252032520325
