7955235,3,B00005UQ9N,"""Mystery"" contains five episodes: a great deal for the price.  However, these episodes are a bit predictable.

Episode 12 - ""Garden of Crying Reeds"" - The saddest of them all, absolutely painful to watch.  If you are a cat lover, I recommend skipping this one.

Episodes 13 & 14: ""Light of the Sea, Pts. I & II"" The best two on this disc.  A mystery unfolds as Larva is compelled to leave Miyu's side for a reason he cannot name.  Miyu goes after her beloved companion.  These episodes tell the story of Larva's past, and how he and Miyu met.

Episode 15: ""Dream of the Mermaid"" - This mermaid is so pretty to look at, but when are mermaids ever good?  So you know what will happen, but when it does, it still scared me.  Animation is so exceptional in ""Mermaid.""

Episode 16: ""Woman Priest"" - A fine Chinese woman priest comes to Japan on a revenge mission, and runs into Miyu.

A final note.  Watch this DVD in a darkened room, because the animation is so dark that you cannot see it in a sunny room.",1095811200,,1002,4.294117647058823
7955236,5,B00005UQ9N,"All of the stories on this DVD turn on two of the most persistent themes of the Miyu stories - destiny and eternal life or immortality.  Miyu's destiny as a Guardian, the nature of her relationship with Larva, and the inexorable tragedy of the effects of the demonic Shinma on humans all play a part.  But we are also brought to see that Miyu's gift for granting a human eternal happiness, like the curse of immortality one gets from eating the flesh of a mermaid are not so much great boons as escapes from one reality into another.  Thus they will always prove false for humans, who need to be able to make their own choices to find true happiness.
In 'Garden of Crying Reeds' a young man seeking his lost cat stumbles upon a beautiful woman at a foreboding mansion who expresses sympathy.  When Chisato finds a kitten he decides to see if the woman would like to have it as a pet.  Of course, the woman is a Shinma with a cat garden and Miyu must do some pruning.
'Light of the Sea' is a two-part story of Larva's sudden disappearance when some of his old 'friends' come to Japan for a visit.  At the same time, Miyu finds herself dealing with two local Shinma who have fallen in love with each other.  Somehow, they hold part of the secret to Larva's mystery.  Miyu must fight for Larva's freedom and then finds herself at war with Reiha, but not before we learn a great deal about the first meeting between the vampire and Larva.
In 'Dream of the Mermaid' another young man seeking escape from his own loss comes upon a mermaid in an aquarium.  They find a form of love, but the mermaid is a Shinma.  Deluded he wants to free her, but Miyu must intervene to fulfill her own destiny and bring an ancient legend to a conclusion.
In a change of pace episode, 'Woman Priest,' Miyu meets Yui-Li, a Chinese spiritualist and martial arts expert.  She is hunting a Shinma that killed her family.  Despite a very unfriendly initial meeting, she draws Miyu's interest.  The vampire helps her, but not the way expected.",1041379200,6,2013,4.4375
7955237,5,B00005UQ9N,"The episodes of the first two dvds (1-7) I thought were good.
I was introduced to Vampire Princess Miyu through the four OAV episodes involving Himiko the Spiritualist.
The TV episodes seemed to have less of a plot, and I was afraid that it would only be Miyu vanishing Shinmas to the dark and no other plot.  But, by the second DVD, I was amazed at the animation improvement and plot development.  By the third dvd (episodes 8-11) I was hooked and I watched each episode three times to make sure I got everything.  All episodes in this DVD (vol 4) are amazing, though I thought Light of the Sea could have been shortened to one episode, but I guess they wanted a cliff hanger.  My favorite is the last episode where Miyu shows how much she cares for arrogant human beings.
If you are Miyu fan, I would recommend this DVD wholeheartedly, but be sure to watch the three other DVDs before you get to this one.",1015891200,16,907,4.380952380952381
