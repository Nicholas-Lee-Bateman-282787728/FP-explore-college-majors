2269162,5,B00097DNW6,"This magnificent open level program is all about the embellishments for belly dance.  A must have reference tool for the belly dancer.

This is a wonderful collection of expressive arm gestures, turns,  hand movement; all the little non verbal phrases that captivate an audience, so richly done!  Working with this 90 minute  program is so enjoyable and has brought awareness to the subtle nuances that make huge impacts in dance.

 Neon is not only beautiful and very graceful, but her work is superb and sophisticated. Her instructional videos are perfectly organized or ""catalogued"" to facilitate learning. This concept is useful especially when referring back to specific material.

 The Body Language of Belly Dance Movement Catalogue consists of:

Body language phrases by themes: magic/ritual, spiritual experience, majesty, divinity, drama flirtation, compassion, dream and inspiration.

Arm trajectories- parallel arms and circles, inward outward exchanging use of the palms.

Trajectories into phrases-this is a very extensive section for the arms, hands using spirals, circles and exchanges position of the palms.

Enhancing expressivity-this section utilizes accents and angles for the face, head. In addition, rotation of wrists, finger ripples, chest movement along with  3 step turns, paddle and pivot turns.

Sample body language ""choreographies"" Neon takes the movement into mini choreographies to convey messages of magic, and a beautiful sampler of ""odalisque"". Easy to follow along as the movement flow is well organized.

Performances: 2 fabulous performances, one solo by Neon
Program music only is a wonderful feature.",1312329600,6,1641,5.663934426229508
2269163,5,B00097DNW6,"""The Body Language of Belly Dance"" is a wonderful exploration of non-verbal communication through dance, and though made for belly dancers, this instructional DVD could be advantageous for choreographers and performers of many genres.

Neon knows how to express herself exquisitely through dance, and also verbally, as she explains throughout this well written 90 minute DVD how to tell a story with gestures.  Neon also has a mellow, melodic voice that is easy to listen to, with her attractive Russian accent.  The instruction is photographed against a plain blue background, making every movement easy to see.

Neon starts with a Body Language dictionary, and then moves on to ""Arm Trajectories,"" and ""Accents and Angles,"" going into more detail and incorporating the whole body in these movements that tell a story. The final performances are terrific: The first, ""In Love with a Time Bomb,"" Neon dances with Angelys and Jenna Ray, and then finishes with a dazzling solo, ""Odalisque."" Neon is a marvel. A stunning beauty, a modern Scheherazade, who can tell 1001 tales with the flick of a wrist or a graceful step.",1311897600,8,1118,5.092896174863388

8057947,5,B00097DNW6,"This is a really good DVD for those who want to add an extra layer to their belly dance.  It's like a dictionary full of gestures and postures that convey a variety of emotions to the audience you are dancing for.  Even if you dance alone or for a workout, this DVD is great because it will teach you how to better express yourself through dance.  I absolutely loved it.  Neon is an incredibly talented teacher.

8057948,5,B00097DNW6,"The instructor has a very pleasant teaching approach. I liked the voice, the music was nice and I enjoyed learning the moves, which I found them simple to follow. Even though I would prefer to study belly dancing in the class setting, but I can not find any nearby, so this is a good alternative for right now.",1367193600,,310,4.362068965517241
8057949,5,B00097DNW6,"I am an intermediate-advanced bellydancer (4-5 years experience, several styles). Like the DVD says, 'this is not a dance instruction', so leave it if you are looking for something to drill or practice at home. Great if you are looking for inspiration while creating a fusion coreography.

CONTENT:

This DVD is really a CATALOGUE of poses and hand gestures, seasoned with head tosses and looks. Means, there are dozens of moves, but they are demonstrated at most twice each, with Neon facing you (so you have to mirror the poses), and moving quickly from one to the other. Seeing her moving is enchanting and inspiring, but next to impossible to follow. The very first section 'bodylanguage of bellydance' is a rapid collection of poses, divided into themes. This could be used as inspiration when you create a coreogrphy.
 Then there are two  sections on arm trajectories- one with very simple arm movements (again, very quickly demonstrated) and one combined with steps, which look great but are again hard to imitate because of speed and front facing. Finally there is a section on hands, head tosses, etc, which basically suggests how to give different connotations to a movement through these details.

HOW TO USE IT:

 This is still a mistery to me. Just following through dozens of poses can be of no help. Probably, you can choose a couple of poses each time and practice in front of a mirror rewinding or stopping the image. There is no real clue on how to achieve each pose, but this is no problem if you have great ability in copying what she is doing.

EDITING: The title menus work, the voice is recorded separately and flows perfectly with the moves.  Neon dances against a blue background like if her figure had been cut out and glued on top. All of her movements convey a sense of perfection.

Why 5 stars? It is an emotional judgement. I hope one day my unconscious will figure out a way of making sense of it.",1366243200,2,1928,4.677514792899408
8057950,5,B00097DNW6,"Neon is such an incredible teacher.  Motivational and Inspiring.  Her directions are clear and concise.  I love that she combines easier moves with harder ones so that there is always a constant challenge to surmount.  I have to admit that while practicing some of the moves in the mirror with the dvd instructions playing in the background, I sometimes have to look behind me as she speaks a technical correction .....and darn if I wasn't doing the exact movement she is correcting!!  Neon is definitely my favorite instructor.  When I finally give up trying to achieve gracefulness for the day, she is so much fun to watch - so graceful and beautiful!  Definitely recommend this and all of her other dvds as well!!",1355788800,,716,4.772357723577236
8057951,5,B00097DNW6,"It is just amazing! The poses, the movements of the hands and arms  and the explanation of them are really nice and accurate",1340582400,,124,4.391304347826087
8057952,2,B00097DNW6,"I understood that this was a catalog of movements, but the movements were so exaggerated that I really did not find them to be useful. The performances at the end of the dvd were more like a bellydance  fusion and good; unfortunately Im not a fan. This dvd isn't for someone looking for a caralog of dance moves to build into a choreography for oriental dancing. I don't think the movements were helpful. Sorry",1335052800,4,410,4.54054054054054
8057953,4,B00097DNW6,"This video is non-stop arm movements and gestures.  Some are a little hard to follow but pausing and rewinding solves that problem.  She does not break down the movements at all and goes through the moves about twice, quickly, before going to the next.  She includes advice on when to make eye contact with the audience (to avoid making them uncomfortable by doing it at the wrong time), how to hold your head, how to convey submissiveness and dominance, how to show respect and sensuality, when to accent your poses and movements, when to touch your body versus not, etc.  Overall a very helpful video with lots of good information to help the dancer understand how her dance is ""speaking"" to her audience.",1331251200,7,707,4.723577235772358
8057954,5,B00097DNW6,"Do you envy Neon's style, grace and expressiveness?  Her secrets are revealed in this DVD! Take your dance to aother level by learning expression.  This is yet another DVD from World Dance New York that is on my list of videos to get if you want to do video learning (and who doesn't? It is convenient and you can start, stop, and work at your own pace!)to your routine. With this DVD you will learn that it is the entire body integrated that gives real meaning and expressiveness to belly dance, and you will learn HOW to do it!  So let's see what that body has to say!",1316563200,,570,4.2592592592592595
8057955,5,B00097DNW6,"A twirl of the wrist, a tilt of the head. A lifted gaze, a softly extended arm... Such are the elements of body language that can take you from movement to meaning, from dexterity to expressivity. With the lovely Neon you can become a proud goddess, a humble slave girl, a flirty princess, or a girl in a dream. But always, you will be a dancer - one who knows the secret to making your dance sheer poetry in motion. Just draw from this 'catalog' of poses, gestures, accents and movement strings to enhance and deepen even the simplest dance.

This DVD is so beautiful you can just watch it a few hundred times. I'm very familiar with Neon's many videos and have been reviewing them for many years. Because she specializes in beginner instruction, you don't often get to see her full dance repertoire. But on this DVD you see how nuanced her dancing can be.

The preview and product description are completely explanatory. Neon sets the right expectation by pointing out this is not an instructional video but a catalog and demo.  All the same, it would have been so nice to deepen the explanation - and go a bit slower. Like some of the newer videos from World Dance New York, it has a rushed feel, going from one move to the next without a pause to assimilate. Perhaps some separators between movement collections would have worked, but I can also see that this would have disturbed the flow. Still, all it needed to go  from demo to instruction is a little slowing down. That said, just watching many times will lead to internalizing this beautiful language - a language that is, after all, a stylized and dancer's version of everyday human communication.

The elements and phrases Neon shows you, arranged in themes, as you can see from the description, are melting and liquid. You can't look at them and not want to produce them yourself.  Watching this lovely demonstration I find myself amazed at how a tiny nuance like an upturned palm or a flick of the fingers can completely change the message given the same move.  It makes you wonder, not just at Neon's mastery of a dancer's language but get how much more eloquent than words body language can be.

I would unhesitatingly say that every belly dancer should see this and then go ahead and explore these movements in her very own way.",1312502400,11,2295,4.580487804878048
