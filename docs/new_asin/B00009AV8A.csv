7990308,5,B00009AV8A,"Just as crazy and funny as the first volume, now the alien in-laws are coming for a visit and all hell breaks loose. Now Kei has to deal with Mizuho Kazami's over protective sister who tries to blast him every chance he gets while trying to keep his and Mizuho's marriage a secret on a hotel visit honey moon when they run into his classmates/friends. It is just as fun as the first volume and I recommend you pick it up if you enjoy the series.",1358812800,,445,4.186046511627907
7990309,4,B00009AV8A,"Kei is a 18 year old boy in a class full of 15 year olds because of a strange disease he calls a ""Standstill"" that put him in a coma for 3 years. None of his friends know this because he tries to keep it a secret.
Now after a series of pretty awkward events he finds himself married to his teacher who happens to be a young, attractive, half human Alien undercover galactic reporter. Which isn't a problem so much as keeping it a secret from everyone else. And thats just where the problems start...
For story line info read the Amazon review. I'm just going to comment on my overall impression of the disk.
The first installment was so close to the books you could've followed along page by page. This disk breaks away without breaking away from the story line (much). Kind of like this is what happened between the chapters in the book.
I didn't get into the first disk but I'm really glad I gave the second disk a try. The story is good. The gags and awkward situations are better played. And Mizuho's little sister Maho (which is the Japanese word for either witch or magic - can't remember which) was done very well and turned out to be a cute little atom bomb. I think the book series made her out to be a little older and portrayed her concern for her sister a little better. The American voice for Maho was a little strange but bearable as is Kei's voice.
The art is very good. The music is ok. The extras are pretty decent - theres a full length video to the opening song that's pretty nice.
Because of this disk I'll finish out the series.
I still highly recommend the books (manga) to this series.",1066780800,8,1608,4.292763157894737
7990310,5,B00009AV8A,"While Kei and Mizuho try to find a peaceful place for a summer honeymoon, they run into the rest of Kei's classmates.  As Hyosuke tries to find out if Kei likes her or not, the rest of the gang gets into some trouble.  Adult, mature trouble.  While the events happen off screen the story takes a very serious twist when two of the characters make love to each other.  Now they have to decide if they LOVE each other, if you get what I mean.  This makes episode 6 a very serious one.
If that isn't complex enough now add the fact that Mizuho's pretty mom and [aggrivated] sister show up to check out her new Earthling husband.  Maho, the sister, acts very much like Skuld from 'Oh My Goddess!' while the mom, Hatsuho, acts very much like Urd from 'Oh My Goddess!' right down to the sexy body!",1059091200,6,791,4.275167785234899

7990312,5,B00009AV8A,"Just to start off, Please Teacher is a very nicly done anime. Anyways, the first episode of the volume starts off with Kei and Ms. Kazami on their honeymoon on a southern island. They soon find out that Hyosuke, Matagu and the others are on the island too. The second episode is one of the most serious episodes I think of the whole series. Hyosuke and Kaede have to work out the feelings they have torwards each other. The second episode also deels with when Kei meets Ms. Kazami's mother and little sister. With Maho (Ms. Kazami's little sister) trying to get rid of Kei and Hatsuho's (Ms. Kazami's mother) advances. The third has to do mostly about Kei, Ms. Kazami and Ms. Kazami's mother and sister working everything out between each other. The series is funny but it does have quite a lot of serious moments. The one thing that impresses me most about this series is the way the students have problems just like teen, everyday problems such as love and friendship. Please Teacher is ranked up with Evangelion and .hack//SIGN",1058227200,4,1030,4.633879781420765
