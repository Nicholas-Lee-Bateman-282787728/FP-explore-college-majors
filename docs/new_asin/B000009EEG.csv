7905470,4,B000009EEG,"Of all the east-meets-west styled action films presented by Ng See Yuen (the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Retreat-No-Surrender/dp/B0002848WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Retreat, No Surrender</a>&nbsp;series), ""Superfights"" here is among the lesser-known, probably because it flaunts the least famous stars of the bunch - no Jean-Claude Van Damme or Gary Daniels to be found here. Luckily, the cast is nevertheless just as impressive as anybody the series has given us thus far, and despite the film's reputation of being the worst/cheesiest of the collection, I didn't think it any less enjoyable than the movies that came before or after it.

The story: when young martial artists Jack Cody (Brandon Gaines) rescues a young woman (Yu Fei Hong,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Thousand-Years-of-Good-Prayers/dp/B001RJ1Y5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Thousand Years of Good Prayers</a>) from a mugging, he's heralded an American hero and invited to join his favorite TV program, the karate & wrestling fusion of ""Superfights."" However, his dream-come-true will turn into a nightmare upon finding out that not only are the televised fights rigged, but the whole show is a setup for manager Robert Sawyer (Keith Vitali,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revenge-of-the-Ninja/dp/B000092Q4V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revenge of the Ninja</a>) to run a crime ring which threatens the lives of Jack's friends and family.

Is there fighting? Yes, yes yes! And oh yes, it's good stuff! Director/choreographer Tony Leung (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ip-Man/dp/B003INBNXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ip Man</a>) wrangles some darn fine hand-to-hand encounters that would make Hollywood turn green with envy for their speed, fluidity, and ingenuity. There are about nine of these fights, set among several shorter scuffles, all performed by top underrated talent: martial artists Gaines and Vitali, as well as Kelly Gallant (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Talons-of-the-Eagle/dp/B00020HB46/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Talons of the Eagle</a>), Chuck Jeffreys (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodmoon/dp/B000034DDT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodmoon</a>), Cliff Lenderman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Shaolin-King-of-Kickboxers-2/dp/B00008G8NL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Shaolin: King of Kickboxers 2</a>), and kickboxer/pro wrestler Rob Van Dam (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Mask-2-City-of-Masks/dp/B000077VQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Mask 2: City of Masks</a>) light up the screen to the point that there really isn't a bad fight among the pack...although the best of the best has to be the final showdown between Gaines and Vitali, which can match McKinney/Van Damme, Avedon/Hues, or Daniels/Shahlavi any day.

When the fighting stops, however, we're left to contend with the thoroughly interesting dramatics that have become a trademark of the See Yuen series. Plainly, none of the cast can act their way out of an empty dojo. Brandon Gaines doesn't fail as dramatically as Kurt McKinney or Loren Avedon in earlier features, but dammit, that's still some damn bad acting going on. There are plenty of cheesy scenes to point and snort at, like when Jack gets smacked around by his girlfriend's tai chi-practicing grandfather (Patrick Lung-Kong), or the aftermath of the mugging wherein he jogs to sentimental music and schoolchildren yell ""Hey, there's the hero!"", or the rather blatant sexual harassment he suffers at the hands of his theatrically-stunted older trainer, Kelly Gallant. If you believe such things would hinder your movie-watching experience, then don't give this film another thought, but if you love the cheesiness for the sake of cheesiness, then ""Superfights"" is definitely for you.

And hey, how many songs have their own theme songs?

On the amusement scale, ""Superfights"" ranks high, though you can't watch it too many times in a row: as great as it is, the film has the potential to cause lasting brain damage. Still, fans of the series know it's worth it, so if you're game to awesome fighting and nothing substantially else, pick this one out and knock yourself out; you probably will, since this movie is guaranteed to compel spontaneous karate kicking.",1256860800,,4545,6.762393162393162
7905471,3,B000009EEG,"I agree with Rob Nile...this movie is not meant to be taken seriously as it is mainly made for children to watch and have a great time with the entertainment which has some costumes and strange characters of different wrestling types...kinda like a try hard WWF but martial arts orientated instead of wrestling. Keith Vitali is a great martial artist and has one fight scene in the movie.

I vaguely remember watching this movie but I liked it and I plan to purchase it myself sometime soon so I can watch it again. The music is kinda gay so don't expect a good soundtrack,lol. (You'll understand what I mean when you watch the flick). The storyline is good but could've done with more spice and the acting was just average. The fight scenes show some good kicks and some good acrobatic/martial arts moves combined from Brandon Gaines.",1219190400,,835,4.680272108843537
7905472,1,B000009EEG,"I hate to say this, but this is possibly the worst martial arts movie I have ever seen.  The amount of cheese could keep one in the bathroom for weeks and the acting is so bad I think everyone was told to act as poorly as possible.  Although loaded with fights, half the time they look great and the other ridiculus.

Jack Cody (Brandon Gaines) is our main character, a very skinny, whiny, annoying brat who become a hero after saving a girl from a gang at an atm.  You'd think he saved Earth from extinction the way he is publicized - gimme a break, its like someone's fantasy dream being played out or something.  Anyways, his publicity cathes the attention of the owner of Superfights, played by Keith Vitali, the movie's villain - he is scary too because his acting is horrificly bad.  Everything at the Superfights goes well for Jack, until he begins to realize he has become part of a very dirty underground organization and has to fight his way out.

There really is only one notable thing in the film and that is the final fight between Keth Vitali and Brandon Gaines.  It is fast and furious, with decent choreography and goes on and on for about 8 minutes.  But by the time you see it, you lose so much respect for these 2 throughout the film that you just want the movie to be over.

I have reviewed about 75 martial arts films to this point, and this is the only one I have given 1 star for, and its only cause of the final fight.  Without that, i'd give Superfights 0 stars.",1178496000,,1487,4.31294964028777
7905473,4,B000009EEG,"Hey! I was in this film! We spent a long hot day in 1995 shooting my fight scenes in Harrisburg,PA. I was involved in several fight scenes. Look for the guy with the braids! We had fun! Lots of butt kicking action in this one. Not much story, and the directors didn't speak english so they had to show us what to do through body language! You get the picture.....see ya!",1066348800,,370,4.225352112676056
7905474,5,B000009EEG,"Incredible movie!, one of the best that I have seen in my life, spectacular combats, especially the final combat between(among) Brandon Gaines and Keith Vitali, all the excellent figthers of this movie in his(its,her) papers(roles) definitively I think the best movie that has gone out of the seasonal pictures.
cool!",1018656000,,317,5.36
7905475,4,B000009EEG,"This movie Has some fantastic work. I have low standards for martial arts plots but I really loved this movie. My only complaints are as follows. note I am not being sarcastic 1)It seems to be made for children. the uniforms and the charicters do (by the movies own admission) look like eighties style pro wrestling. The main charicter Jack Cody played by Brandon Gains acts like a child that babysitters charge extra for. He's skinny and full of energy but that helps make him the best flying kicker I have ever seen. (he still looks about 70 pounds)
2) The choreogropher doesn't seem to work within limits. These fights are some of the most physically demanding bits I have ever seen. Sure Brandon Gains doesn't have too much body to lift so he can fly all over, but for guest star Keith Hackney (yup the UFC guy) the flying is too much for him and the combos look like crap.
most of the time the fighters can manage but it looks bad when some fighters try to use moves in combat that they haven't quite gotten the hang of yet
3) the bad guy (keith vitali) is the worst villan ever. Not only does he have the cheeziest lines to repeat but he, being somone who cares only about money has no problem killing off all of his money making fighters. He even kills somone running their head through a wooden ceiling fan. He has officially earned the ""Outrageously Bad Actors Award"" believe me he earned it.
With that in mind this movie is great. There is at least one fight or training sequence in every five minutes of fim, and this more than makes up for defects defects in the silly old plot. Half these movies don't even really have a plot. This one's even enjoyable! I'd love to see more of Brandon Gains and choreoghapher Tony Leung. Keep an eye out for this one. It has some great stuff",983577600,4,1788,4.38855421686747
7905476,5,B000009EEG,"Great movie. Some of the best karate/tae-kwon-do instructors in the Harrisburg area are showcased here. Especially you Marianne... pull that skirt down!
If you blink, you'll miss me, but i'm in 4 scenes. I'm  still wondering where my credit is.",963273600,,244,5.1
