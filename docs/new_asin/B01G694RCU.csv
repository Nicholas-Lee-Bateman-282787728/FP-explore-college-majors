7756169,5,B01G694RCU,It's about damn time!,1465516800,3,21,4.5
7756170,5,B01G694RCU,"First I feel I should address a fallacious argument too many people have used to critique the quality of this remaster and ones like it:
I see a lot of reviewers complaining about this not being a widescreen release, referencing Dragonball Z's widescreen remasters and asking ""why didn't Bleach do this?"" As someone who's actually researched this I can tell you that's impossible without cropping the top and bottom of the image. Dragonball Z was physically mastered in cells (each frame was physically stored with the potential of being rescanned in a different aspect ratio) whereas Bleach was never stored that way. Bleach was produced and mastered digitally at a predetermined resolution. This method is more efficient and now more common but with the drawback of not being ""expandable."" If they mastered it in 4:3, which they did for the series' first 8 seasons, they can't simply rescan the cells like Funimation did with Dragonball Z because there are no cells to rescan. It's not a result of laziness people, it's an impossibility. Dragonball is an example of a ""traditionally animated"" series with little involvement of digital technology in its production but the same cannot be said of Bleach so stop comparing the two.

Now considering that Viz did the best they could within the realm of practicality this is in no way wasteful remaster and I'll explain why:
The picture quality is still leagues ahead of the old DVD releases, showing slighter details with greater clarity and with greater depth of color. Digital video streams are compressed data that drop in acuity during ""fast-moving"" scenes. This is because the compression algorithms used to encode the streams work by finding redundancies between sequential frames and in scenes with a lot of motion there is less redundancy to take advantage of; for example if one scene simply shows a character sitting in a chair eyeing a cup of tea and the only thing moving in that scene is the steam rising from the cup everything else in that scene can be encoded just once for all those frames (of which there are usually 24 per second). In contrast if a scene shows several characters sprinting toward some location that increase of movement decreases the redundancy between frames and the quality of each frame drops because the algorithm is forced to compensate. Blu-rays, which predominantly use AVC, do this much more efficiently than DVD's, which use MPEG-2, meaning they can produce a stream of the same perceived quality and at the same resolution as a DVD but using less data. This alone makes Blu-rays superior. In addition to that Blu-rays usually have lossless audio tracks. ""Losslessly compressed data"" is data that can still be decompressed into the exact original data; if you need an example picture '9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9' as a string of data. An algorithm then compresses that string as '9 x 12' so that it takes up less space but can still be decoded as a verbatim copy of the original data. This means that Blu-rays can potentially contain studio-quality audio, which this release does. DVD's on the other hand usually use lossy compression methods that allow for much greater compression but can only approximate the data. These are really simplistic descriptions of how these things work but I meant for them to be easily understood.",1465430400,4,3318,4.872566371681416

7756175,5,B01G694RCU,"The first 3 seasons of Bleach have only been available in Standard Def until now, so I was very excited to get this.

The picture quality looks great compared to the DVD's I've had for a decade now. It is an upscale, as others have said, but that is because these seasons of Bleach were animated and aired in Standard Def. It is doubtful higher quality masters exist given that it was drawn digitally.

That being said, the picture is very improved and the sound quality is superb. The lines are cleaned up, the animation is noticeably smoother, and the soundtrack has never sounded better! The HD mastering may not stand up next to other series animated in HD or series that had higher quality masters available, but keep in mind that this is over a decade old now. If you are a Bleach fan looking to upgrade, or someone looking to get into the series for the first time, this set is a great buy.

I hope they continue these releases with success to get more interest in the series again -- I've sorely missed it since it's ending//cancellation and have a fool's dream of seeing the final chapters animated...",1501113600,,1110,4.512437810945274

7756178,3,B01G694RCU,"As much as I'd like to give this a stellar 5 star review, I can't. Honestly if I had waited and saw this on a shelf I probably wouldn't have purchased it. But saw Bleach releasing on Blu-ray they had my pre-order. When this was first being released it was being labeled as an HD remaster. Which led me and others to believe that it was being recut and redone in wide-screen HD like the last DBZ Blu-ray releases. Which I love. If done correctly I personally don't mind it being cropped and retouched to better display on modern TVs. I understand those who want the original 4:3, you will probably enjoy this set.
I don't know whether it is Amazon or the studio but this listing still does not list the format as being 4:3.

If you don't already own Bleach these releases are a great way to get into an amazing show. But I just don't feel that the upcoming done here is worth a repurchase. Hopefully somewhere down the line we get a complete remastering.",1489017600,,953,4.353932584269663

But, I am rather disappointed that I can't watch it in full screen mode like I could the DVDS. I am also disappointed that the Stereo is still 2.0 instead of 5.0 or higher with typical remasters of old anime's. But nonetheless still worth buying. I can't wait to see how the other sets turnout. I hope they put more effort in the future sets to come. I hope they release the 2 other Movies on Blu-ray as well as a quadruple feature set.",1476748800,,587,4.0256410256410255

It's Bleach on Blu-Ray! It's finally here. Picture quality looks great and is what I'd expect from a Blu-Ray disc. Because YuYu Hakusho was released on Blu-Ray, as old as YuYu Hakusho is, I knew eventually they would get around to releasing Bleach on Blu-Ray as well, which is what's kept my patience going so strong all these years as I've waited for this release of Bleach on Blu-Ray. Anyway, I've already watched all 27 episodes! And I can hardly even wait for the 2nd Blu-Ray release for Bleach. I can imagine that one who might've already bought all the DVD's wouldn't be that interested in repurchasing all on Blu-Ray, but if you're like me, one who's waited patiently for years, you have to get your hands on this!

The quality of this set looks great, and the menus are looking good as well. There's even a nice feature to turn on subtitles for the openings/endings as well as any subtitles for the signs/posters/text that are in Japanese kanji throughout the episodes.

7756191,5,B01G694RCU,"If you're looking for a good alternative to the DVDs, anime Blu-Ray buyers, this is a really good release to get. It's done by the same people who remastered Death Note for its Blu-Ray release, so you know it's in good hands. Now, the show didn't go HD until episode 168, so it'll be a while before we get the actual HD-produced episodes. Not to say that this is bad. The upscale is really well handled. Certainly watchable & enough reason for me to replace the DVD sets I have & buy the releases for the ones that I don't have. My ultimate hope is that the sales from these will continue to have these come out, as well as the first 2 movies, since they've been released on Blu-Ray everywhere EXCEPT here in America. I mean, come on, Viz. First Naruto's first 4 movies & Bleach's too? What's the deal?
Anyways, yeah. It's upscaled to great quality. Yes, It's 4:3, but the fact that some people think HD means something has to be 16:9 right off the bat *cough* EDM *cough*, is completely ridiculous. There are PLENTY of older TV shows & movies that have been remastered in HD, but aren't 16:9. Now, this wasn't remastered in Japan, but it's no DBZ Blu-Rays. Trust me, those were awful, to say the least. Not remastered in the least, just painted over with watercolors that oversaturated the colors in the images, then don't even get me started on the cropping. If you can't handle an old show having at least a LITTLE amount of grain, & isn't in your precious widescreen, then you have NO right to call yourself a fan of visual media. This is a show from before the standard became widescreen & HD. Before 2009, only select shows started to be produced in widescreen, let alone HD. Before that, it was pretty much films that got that treatment. So, get over it already.
Anyways, everything from the DVD releases have been ported over. The episodes & behind the scenes features are here & you get 7 more than the DVDs. I would recommend waiting for the price to go down if you're on the fence, but it's worth getting for those who're Bleach fans & want a good release of these, I recommend it.",1469318400,4,2092,4.422279792746114

7756193,3,B01G694RCU,"in all honesty im a big bleach fan but this..was a bit of a let down....

2 disks popped out and were moving about in the case, but thanks to being bluray no damage .. just a heads up on that

the video itself is not  that impressive  and let me explain why .... I was watching  it initially to enjoy the show all over again but things kept popping out that bugged me so I decided to do a comparison

- watching in a sony bluray player, sony ps3, xbox 1 , sony udhd upscale bluray player and a samsung udhd upscale player yields the same results. yes separate players ....two separate tvs (moved players around to verify they were not the issue) 45""

-video format is in 16.9 fixed but it is cut on the side to be a  fixed 4.3 viewing (using tv full screen of hd-full will fix this but its a bit annoying
not a 16.9 HD ...in reality its 4.3 hd .... id prefer 16.9 which isn't that hard to actually accomplish viz....

when viewing I compared the two tvs and the quality to the original Dvd release of the episodes side by side at the same time , with two tvs of the same rating and size 120hz and 45

EDIT:(i even later tried this out on a custom plasma 4k tv setup ....same results , but smoother motion....600hz wins out there)

the blue ray is a lot cleaner in comparison but there are definite trouble parts throughout the shows that they missed in the ""cleanup""

the standard dvd quality pops up in weird spots here and there (in hair, teeth, hands, random backgrounds), these weird spots that were in the exact same quality as the dvd ....

granted these are small, and appear at random, but its a bit of a let down when its supposed to have been cleaned up and in hd

it dosnt seem like the best effort was made on this set 1 , I hope they improve the set 2",1469145600,4,1764,4.104956268221574

7756195,5,B01G694RCU,"This is a good release. I'm really happy Viz did this. I mean, they need the sales, I get it. Some reviews here mentioned the quality looks like a simple upscale, and I think that might be the case here. I mean understand the footage is 10+ years old, it wasn't meant to be true HD, you know what I mean. Until I think around ep 243 or somewhere around there. they start encoding widescreen HD. But don't get it twisted, the footage comparison between this and the DVD is quite noticeable, especially in well lit colorful scenes. I especially loved the holographic look to the casing, they could've just gone with white like the dvd release, so I'm glad there was some consideration to make it look better. I mean, I really got no gripes, for the price, not bad at all. I was hoping this wouldn't be something like the Sailor Moon Blu-ray release, and it superseded my expectations.

7756197,5,B01G694RCU,"I never review anything but when it came to this, I felt obligated to leave my thoughts. I've been a huge Bleach fan for years. So when I heard an official Bluray release was coming, I had to pick it up. I was so excited yet so worried. I've heard about a lot of series that had poor releases on bluray compared to their dvd counterparts. But After sitting down and binge watching this, I can wholeheartedly say this bluray release is amazing! I know it might sound like a weird worry but my biggest concern was that they might have cropped or edited the picture to 16:9 in an attempt to make it look better/newer but thankfully It's in its original 4:3 format. The menus are quick and easy to navigate. I especially like the option to only turn on subtitles for songs and written text in the show. The image quality itself is amazing. To get the picture to a beautiful 1080p without it looking awful or choppy truly shows they took care when making this product. But it does make me wonder. With the cancellation of the anime and decline in sales/popularity of the manga, why release this now? Is it because the manga is nearing it's end? Or.. Perhaps a hint the anime may return..? A fan can only hope. So to wrap up, I highly recommend any and all Bleach fans to pick this up. It is a must have for everyone!! I rate it 36.5 out of 10.",1468886400,18,1338,4.271653543307087

For $35-$40 dollars you can't really complain. For not owning any of the Bleach DVD releases - I have no complaints with this set.

Anyway, if you like Bleach, and you like anime and you want to continue to see it released stateside - buy it.

If you're unfamiliar with bleach - this show early on was really very good. Like a lot of other long running anime the show struggles with pacing and filler issues after about 60-70 episodes.

8762399,5,B01G694RCU,"Bleach is a very lengthy series, not as lengthy as natuto but still very lengthy. It holds a special place in my heart, I used to watch the series weekly back when I was in middle school... Good times... . The entire series is 366 episodes with collection 4 coming up to episode 111 or something in may. So I will imagine that if they plan to put it all on bluray, it will be as much as the fairy tail blu rays were it has more than 10 collections, might want to buy them one at a time.

The bleach anime isn't THAT old, so it's not that noticable that it doesn't seem like a dramatic HD improvement, but it is better. For one the animation is very crisp and clear, amost making it like a brand new anime in that blu ray quality, also the audio is very crisp and clear as well. My only complaint would be that there is no blu-ray + dvd combo pack, but I can forgive them due to the shear size on the series (well that and the series was cancelled before the final ark of the manga due to filters, only ending at the fullbringer ark or whatever you spell it) Anyways lets get a quick review on bleach.

Here we have our protagonist ichigo, were just on one normal day all of the sudden some demon looking creature called hollows. Rukia, a Shinigami, was tasked on a ""exorcism"" of the hollow as the job of the shinigamis are to defeat the demon that has taken over a human soul and sending that human soul to the ""next life"" which is the soul society. She unfourtuntly gets stabbed by the hollow trying to protect ichigo from the hollow, so in order for ichigo to save this family and this mysterious girl he accepts Rukias power as a Shinigami. He defeats the hollow and is victorious. However since he took Rukias spiritual energy, he now has to temporarily do her job while she waits for her spiritual energy to return. This is were the series begins. Now ichigo tasked with doing Rukias job as a shinigami has to go and defeat hollows but gets caught up in something bigger along the way. This is pretty much the first ark of bleach, leading up to the rukia rescue ark were ruika is sent to be executed by the higerups because of the fact that she gave her power to a human.... Which will be on collection 2 were is the series really starts to pick up. Ichigo is very weak and underpowered at the start of the series, but he ends up being the most powerful soul eater in existance. Oh yes and ichigo has friends that also can use spiritual powers gradually in the series as well, though not all are shinigamis. Man this set reminds me how much I love bleach 

In any case this is a great set to have, the hell are you waiting for? Get it while it's still cheap!!!",1525219200,,2665,4.19921875
