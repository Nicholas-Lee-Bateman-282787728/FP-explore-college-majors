2614706,5,B000GJQ5FE,"I really miss the old school Lifetime suspense movies from the 90s/ early 2000s.. they were pretty awesome and Lying Eyes from 1996 is no exception! The newer movies aren't nearly as good  and the acting is almost always atrocious as well.
Anyway, this movie is definitely a good one. It's about a naive 18 year-old high school student who quickly falls for a charming older guy in his 30s. He soon wines and dines her, buys her expensive gifts and says all the right things. Hmmm... he sounds too good to be true and of course he is. Amy discovers that her perfect boyfriend is actually a married man with two young children. She tries to break it off with him but he insists that he is going to leave his wife very soon and everything will work out if she can just be patient while he tries to end things. Meanwhile, she is being stalked repeatedly by a mysterious person who is terrorizing her and threatening her life. Is it the angry wife who has found out about the affair? Or could it be someone else....?
Fast paced Drama/Mystery/Thriller that keeps your attention and keeps you guessing.  So glad it's available for a great price on DVD.",1345852800,16,1146,4.478468899521531
2614707,5,B000GJQ5FE,maybe you'll see he's lying and is married. This is a true story of a girl who naviely falls in love with a married man. He lies and lies until she finally is getting stalk and scared out of her mind. Very good movie it is a must see. If they say they are not married don't believe them.,1332547200,3,287,3.8813559322033897
2614708,3,B000GJQ5FE,"I won't lie, this is a total lifetime movie. But it's a good one! It's about this cheerleader who is a senior in high school who meets this hot older man who is everything a girl wants: good looking, smart, rich, a respected lawyer, and he is totally crazy about her. Things heat up between them and she is totally happy, until someone starts following her and leaving threatening letters. It gets pretty intense and the person behind it is not who you'd think. If you like the ""lifetime movie"" genre, it's one of their better ones.",1229299200,,532,4.494845360824742

2614727,5,B000GJQ5FE,"This is my all time favorite Lifetime tv movie!!!! It takes me back to my teenage days in the late 90s when these movies ruled!! The popular pretty head-cheerleader with the hottest guy in school or in this case, the hottest married guy in town lol. And of course the scandalous drama that naturally comes with this storyline. These movies are predictable but addicting to any woman. Romance novels come to life. I love this though because I feel teenage girls could learn a lot from it. Those perfect dreamy prince charming types are never what they seem but the truth always comes out in the end. The ending of this movie was the shocker for me because regardless of all that played out, the womanizing Derek was right back at it. A must see!!",1400630400,2,745,4.525925925925926
2614728,5,B000GJQ5FE,"I first saw this movie on Lifetime and fell asleep so I didn't see the ending.  I bought the DVD because I enjoyed it so much.

8133258,4,B000GJQ5FE,"Lifetime addict stamp of approval. It had everything - an inappropriately aged love affair, jealous wife, cheerleading montages, single mom side plot, not as hot best friend, more than one creepy locker room scene, and a fabulous twist at the end.
