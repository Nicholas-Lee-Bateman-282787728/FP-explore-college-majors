7386438,5,B014DEGQZ6,Highly recomend. A great family movie. One for the entire family and friends. A must see movie.,1446940800,5,95,4.647058823529412
7386439,5,B014DEGQZ6,"This is a cute Christmas movie. You will want to participate in the Angel Tree or any type of "" pull a name off a tree"" to help a child/teen have a Christmas. Beautiful plot!!! You never know someone's story, we all have a walk and if we can ease a burden along the way, I'm all for that!!!",1446681600,28,290,3.9322033898305087
7386440,5,B014DEGQZ6,"Have you ever seen a Christmas tree display with paper symbols hanging. On each symbol is a name of a child with some items the child wants or needs for Christmas. So you take one, buy the items , return to the gifts to the center and probably not think another thing about it.

This movie will make you rethink your actions. It is a movie what will move you in many ways. You will encounter a mother who runs away with her children to escape her abusive husband. You see her try to build a new life for her and her children. You see the many challenges the family faces. You will see how the paper angel tree established by the Salvation Army enables a family to enjoy a blessed Christmas.

Thomas , the son , shows us all through his character that there is more to learn from a person than their outside appearance. He shows us hope,l perseverance, love, commitment, and unselfishness , but also disappointment, hurt, and anger.

Due to Thomas' personality, the people he meets along the way, he makes a difference in so many lives. Thomas had a vision to help, no money, but he was able to make a special Christmas for many children/families.

To me this was a great family movie to share, but with the older children in your family. I can see a wonderful discussion initiated by the movie which may prove to help those less fortunate in your own community.

I believe this movie is well worth your time to watch and share.

7386441,5,B014DEGQZ6,I watched this on TV last year.  It was a movie about the Salvation Army angel tree.  It had two interrelated families stories going on.  The ending brought me to tears and I was surprised.  This was the best family Christmas movie I had seen in a few years.,1445040000,33,258,4.204081632653061

7386454,5,B014DEGQZ6,"Yep I do believe that this can happen. You can be negative or positive with the message on a movie like this, but the positive ones are what makes this story a possibility.  Made me learn a bit on what I am shooting for in myself.",1513987200,,230,4.0
7386455,1,B014DEGQZ6,"This was a slickly created and cleverly disguised CHRISTMAS movie that robbed the script of all references to what CHRISTmas is all about: CHRIST. In doing so, it left the viewer with a gooey sugar-coated mess of a script with no messenger in sight. The future of ALL THINGS CHRISTIAN, no doubt, unless the CONSUMER continues to EDUCATE themselves about propaganda. Merry CHRISTmas!",1511222400,,382,5.079365079365079

7386458,5,B014DEGQZ6,Very interesting story line. Two families are intertwined. Shows how people can help each other through simple everyday words and actions. Demonstrates selflessness. Realistic in the problems and solutions it offers. Worth your time and interest. Certainly could be encouraging to children and teenagers in facing difficulties.

7386497,4,B014DEGQZ6,"This is a lovely story that draws attention to the benefit of participating in the Salvation Army's ""Angel Tree Program"". Although they are a ""Christian"" organization, and the story happens during Christmas, it is not an overtly religious film. I think anyone who enjoys stories that are uplifting and show how all of us as human being can make the lives of those around us better, will love this film. It is definitely appropriate for all ages, excepting children who still ""believe"" and might be confused about why the impoverished children in the story wouldn't be getting presents on Christmas.",1483401600,,598,4.99

7386577,5,B014DEGQZ6,"My granddaughter and I watched this film together. Paper Angels is a good feeling film ,and it is perfect for the holidays. Gather around your families, and take it all in.

A family, mom, teen son,  daughter and son leave an abusive husband/ father. They move to a new area, poor paying job for mom, new school for son, Thomas and daughter. Things are not great,  but they all have faith.

Into this mix another family, mind his wife pregnant with twins. His business is losing it's best client, one of the twins is not growing well. Things look dismal. All if these people have some sort of guiding star from within that leads them on the path to the right.

A film that will lift your spirits, and will,bring the true meaning of Christmas.

7386634,4,B014DEGQZ6,"Let me make clear that I do not enjoy ""Christian movies""; they tend toward bad acting, bad filming, and eye rollingly unrealistic plots that come over as bad propaganda. While there are a couple of brow-raising plot moments in this one, anyone who claims the filming or acting was bad must not have watched the same movie, and the plot was pretty good. There was also no constant ""hit you over the head"" Christian bombast, people went to church a couple times and said something about having faith here and there but nothing that would cause a nonChristian to be really discomforted.  These people just acted like the Christian friends I have who don't shove anyone's face in their religion, they just try to be good people and occasionally say something about God or Jesus or whathaveyou regarding their beliefs when it comes up.  I actually enjoyed this movie and to be blunt the basic messages in it are the sort that would make human life far better if we all thought about them and took them to heart whatever ""faith"" we profess (including none).  And yes, I take names from the ""Giving Trees"" (which is what they're called where I live) and put together packages for the kids and seniors who have even less than this older veteran living on disability.  Even if you can;t buy an expensive electronic gadget, there are always kids who want scarf-and-mitten sets, blind seniors who want audio books, and other requests you can find in thrift stores or make yourself to brighten their lives.  The movie is completely realistic about everyone needing a little help now and then to get back on their feet - or stay there.",1482796800,3,1622,4.67719298245614

There was a time where my family couldn't afford Christmas gifts and barely dinner. Instead of being hard to understand and bratty about it come Christmas morning I got up and helped my mom with breakfast. I was the younger child and by my doing that this changed the entire course of the day. My sister joined in and helped and even my brother (who was known to be a sour patch kid over everything) was pleasant and actually sat down for breakfast that morning.

The storyline lagged just a little in the middle, especially with what happened with one of the main character's jobs (you may see what I mean), but it was worth seeing it through. There was some seriousness to the movie, as the bio touches on, but the story didn't dwell so much on the hardships that it overshadowed the larger message of hope and peace. I especially appreciated that (slight spoiler alert) the movie ends well, but everything is not left wrapped up in such a pretty bow that the topic of alcoholism and abuse is treated too lightly. All in all, a very balanced perspective of both the challenges and possibilities regarding making a change for the better. Merry Christmas!!",1481846400,,927,4.763975155279503

But even for the ones who are not Christian, this movie still shows a wonderful message of how much helping even if it's a little bit can do much good to others.  I've been ignoring the Salvation Army volunteers all month now--being unemployed and without receiving any income, and after watching this movie, it hit me, I can still help.  I can still volunteer my time.  That won't cost me anything now that I am going through a very difficult situation myself, so I can still give and maybe help make someone's life less difficult, or just to bring a smile to a child's face.

But apart from this, there were serious flaws in this film: the acting by most in the cast was not fully up to par, the storyline was rather simplistic, and too much depended on the power of prayer, the Salvation Army, and a belief in Christ. Why be so exclusive? Caring for others is such a universal moral admonition that Hindus, Muslims, and even agnostics could comfortably be accommodated as well. 2 1/2 stars",1477440000,,518,4.766666666666667

And then there's the occasional surprise and this was one of those.  The ending was unexpected and nice, if a tad far-fetched and just a bit too-tidy.  But overall, this was a good movie.  It's a keeper.  Just wish it had had subtitles or closed captioning.",1447459200,7,424,4.30379746835443

8730321,4,B014DEGQZ6,"The acting was not superlative, but all of the scenarios were very real to me, so each actor worked very well in his or her situation and environment, and were thus pleasing to watch.

The basic story is the unintentional intertwining of two very different families: one, a youngish couple, the wife of which is close to term on their first children, a set of boy twins, the husband of which is a successful and very talented graphic design artist; the second family is a wife with two teenage children, a girl, about 12 or 13, the boy, about 16, very talented in basketball with an uplifting and kind heart.  Their situation involves leaving suddenly their home and long time alcoholic dad/husband, and driving to
a far away nice right sized town having to start all over again close to Christmas with school  for the kinds and a new job waitressing  for  the mom.

How the two families become interconnected is subtle and nicely done; it's fun to be the audience, enabled to see how close they skate toward each other, and with what effect.  Waitress mom  tells her two kids that she's signed them up for the Paper Angel Program (Have any of you heard of this?  It sounded like such a good idea!) where, if the child makes a list of desires under his or her name written on the paper angel, it is tied to a Christmas tree, and some one may pick them to commit to purchasing the contents of the list.  The children never learn the donor's name, nor does the donor know the child's last name.  Someone apparently off scene picks the daughter's name, and the artist/designer picks the  teen aged boy's name.

What is most heartening about this movie is how the members of each family not only interact with each other in understanding and as much support  as can be generated, but they truly are willing to go through the hardships together,  which means not
blaming each other, or staying bitter about the sad things that seem to be happening during a wonderful holiday.  Mr. Artist/Designer is actually losing his business, because his largest client cannot, though loving his work, continue with another
contract for the next year. Meanwhile, the Church  minister encourages  him to get rid of some anxiety by  working it off in the basketball court when the team is not there.  His Mrs. is doing alright in late term, heeding the doctor's advice to rest a lot and lift her feet and legs, but  one month before term, the smaller twin is exhibiting increasing stress symptoms, so she is hospitalized.
Hubby meanwhile has unknowingly picked Thomas, the teenaged boy as his  Paper Angel, in addition to getting into basketball
practice together, still without knowing each others' names.  They have a good chemistry and communicated easily with one another.

The now single mom is meeting her challenges, especially with two responsible, responsive, and supportive kids. They all talk things over when a major decision must be made.  Mrs. Designer's wife is pretty sensible toward and sensitive to her husband's
discomfort at nearly everything but always has a sensitive insight into what's bothering him, and  thus  keeps him going.  He helps her by lovingly doing the cooking and cleaning in addition to his full-time job.

What keeps this story so interesting is how the older boy, really the focus of the tale, is doing
at his new high school.  He seems calm, and confident , able to deal with the loneliness, until
he has a run-in with the local jock who reacts defensively and aggressively to this new kid's talent in basketball and posts a defamation on  Facebook which went viral in the school.

His  solution is to ignore it, which doesn't move much, but he does discuss it with  the artist designer shooting hoops in the gym, who advises to listen to his deep feelings inside,
as guide for the best solution that will help as many people as can.

To see how he handles this cyber bully is an inspiring moment and well worth the movie.  To return good for evil can be very challenging, but  he  does it with panache.

I recommend this movie as uplifting and inspiring in a real live context, situations we can all understand.",1514678400,,4133,4.6875
