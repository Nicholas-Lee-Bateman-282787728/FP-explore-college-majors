8204190,5,B000S2XCZK,I loved this movie when I first saw it on Nick years ago I think that they were geniuses to come up with this.,1407110400,,110,3.625
8204191,4,B000S2XCZK,"This, frankly, is the first book on bullying that I found refreshing.  This is such an issue and this whole series provides the ""bullied"" with a delightful option not just for revenge, but also for change.",1396051200,,205,4.694444444444445
8204192,4,B000S2XCZK,thay could have mad it a little longer but it was nice as it was would like to seen him try to jkiss the girl,1377475200,,109,3.4
8204193,5,B000S2XCZK,"Saw this movie on Nickelodeon a couple of years ago.  We no longer have cable and only place to see/rent/purchase is at Amazon.  We love Ned's Declassified (where lead character (Devon Werkheiser) was first known) and he's just as hilarious in this movie as he was as Ned.  Good, wholesome family watching and tons of laughs.  All kids (and their parents) will identify with the dilemmas and frustrations the kids face in the movie -- pretty good morals, too.",1357862400,,459,4.772151898734177
8204194,5,B000S2XCZK,"this was a great movie, no foul language, no cheesy ending, just a really great movie. The only complaint I have is OVER ACTING! It wasn't in the whole movie, but there was some spots that I laughed at. (even though it wasn't meant to be funny...)",1310688000,,247,4.276595744680851
8204195,1,B000S2XCZK,"I was excited to find the Shredderman available at Amazon but when I tried to show the DVD to my students after reading the book aloud, I was dissappointed.  The end of the movie was unwatchable because it kept breaking up.  I returned the DVD for credit.",1224374400,,255,4.404255319148936
8204196,4,B000S2XCZK,"while the movie is great fun and a good story, the outstanding feature of this video is devon's music video in the extras.  i was quite surprised to hear his voice.  it is not in the disney/nick genre.  he was supposed to do a cd and i would certainly buy it.
