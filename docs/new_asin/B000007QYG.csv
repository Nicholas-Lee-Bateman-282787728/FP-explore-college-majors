8560980,5,B000007QYG,"This movie was terrific! The story was great. I laughed, I cried. It moved me so much that I can honestly say it even brought me closer to God. The acting was superb, especially the older blond girl with the glasses. I believe that role was played by a young Hillary Higgins. The Academy should have nominated her for the Oscar for that performance. If they had, I'm sure Hillary would have continued her acting career rather than becoming a gourmet chef. Again, just a totally awesome movie.",1040342400,,492,4.6022727272727275
