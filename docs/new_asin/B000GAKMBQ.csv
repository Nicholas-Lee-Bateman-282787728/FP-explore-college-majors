It doesn't make any sense for the producers of this show to distribute only Seasons 1, 2 and 3 and stop producing Seasons 4 and 5.  Michael Landon and Victor French are looking down at us from Heaven and maybe there is now a Highway to Earth but the Producers and Distributors of this extraordinary show owe it to its many fans to put Seasons 4 and 5 on DVD to complete this wonderful set.  Please don't leave us high and dry wanting more.  There were 24 episodes in Season 4 and 13 episodes in Season 5.  Isn't there anyone out there who will put Seasons 4 and 5 on DVD to complete this series.  Michael Landon wrote and directed a series of Love and Honesty and People Loving People.  Not completing this series is doing the greatest disservice to a wonderful man and actor who would have loved to have left us a complete television series.  Remember Bonanza and Little House on the Prairie.  We all get hurt if we are left with an incomplete Series.",1395532800,,1066,4.311557788944723
8129972,5,B000GAKMBQ,"i love this show. landon at his best! victor french and landon work so well together. highway to heaven can make the most hardened person cry their eyes out. my favorite episode was when french and a spoiled actress switched bodies so that they could see what it was like for the opposite sexes. you will roll off your seat laughing at that one!
my only complaint is that the movie people stopped putting them out after season 3. there were only 5 seasons anyway, so why not finish them so we can have them all? i don't buy tv series on dvd anymore cause they won't finish them.  RAWHIDE was done the same way after 3 seasons as well.",1300665600,,634,4.283333333333333
