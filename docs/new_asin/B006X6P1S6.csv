5032839,5,B006X6P1S6,"This is a goofy movie. I first saw it late at night at an anime convention as a teenager, and had I been given any food or drink by strangers I would have thought I had been drugged. This movie is a little on the bizarre side. That being said, when I had a child and he got to an age where he could watch movies, this is one of the first titles I bought. I love Miyazaki. This is a great film for young kids. It doesn't teach any obnoxious lessons, it is pure entertainment, and as it is two films, it can be broken up so your child isn't vegging out in front of the TV as long. Also, my son was irrationally obsessed with trains when I bought this, so part two with the amazing unstoppable train was a huge hit. I like this film, and none of the voice acting is as annoying as say, Mei from Totoro.",1386892800,3,799,3.9382716049382718

It is a good movie for all ages and fun to watch.
The characters are so cute.",1370476800,,112,4.136363636363637
5032841,5,B006X6P1S6,"What more is there to say? If its Ghibli, it's beautiful artwork, a good story. Who could ask for more?",1364774400,2,103,4.2
5032842,5,B006X6P1S6,"Love Ghibli films and this is a very cute addition to the collection. This is NOT a full length film, but a 2 episode DVD. Its a sweet story about a little girl and the 2 pandas that become her family. It's geared for younger kids, so don't expect a sweeping epic like ""Howl's Moving Castle"" or ""Spirited Away"" etc. but it is a great starter for younger, just starting out Ghibli fans! I would say an audience age range of 3-8 (but the adults will enjoy watching along).
This is the ENGLISH DUBBED VERSION, not just Japanese with subtitles.",1364256000,,540,4.41
5032843,4,B006X6P1S6,"I have been searching for this for some time now ever since I saw a clip at work due to a project I was working on.  It's very rarely available and it has been out of stock here on Amazon for a long time. I ended up picking mine up in Walt Disney World EPCOT in Japan for $14.99.  (Of course, now I see it's available here again...just my luck lol).

Anyway, this DVD consists of two 1/2 hour ""episodes"". The first ""Panda Go Panda"" and the Second ""Rainy Day Circus"".

The first is by far the best! It's quirky, very cute animation and dialogue. (Do not expect anything as complex and well written as Totoro etc). This is clearly geared towards young children but the quirky oddness of it appeals to many of those with a sense of humor and a fan of silly anime.

The second ""episode"" is still cute but definitely more for a younger crowd. Not as silly as the first and there's just alot of running and laughing, like something you'd see on NickJr. Still enjoyable though.

Overall it is very cute and silly. Definitely one for your Miyazaki collection :)",1355097600,,1053,4.346938775510204
5032844,5,B006X6P1S6,"Folks, this is pure Showa-period (1970s Japan) kids' entertainment by the master animator Miyazaki Hayao who did this movie for his own children. If you enjoy anime this is a good example of when it was starting to emerge as a serious form of entertainment in Japan. My 5 and 9 year old daughters love it, so you can see who the audience is. Finally, it's good, harmless, simple fun, and is a movie and story that you won't have to worry about letting your kids watch -- a genuine G-rated movie. Highly recommended.",1354492800,5,515,4.48936170212766
5032845,5,B006X6P1S6,"This is the original pre-Studio Ghibli classic from the legendary Hayao Miyazaki, founder of Studio Ghibli and creator to classics such as Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke and many more. Panda Go Panda is a masterpiece early work, that still deserves to be seen by everyone. You get two cartoons for the price of one, Panda go Panda and Rainy Day Circus.

In Panda! Go, Panda!, young Mimiko is left alone by her grandmother and so a daddy panda and a baby panda show up at her house to keep her company, after apparently leaving a nearby zoo. Fun and trouble persists.

In Rainy-Day Circus, a tiger cub has escaped from a traveling sideshow and has hidden out in Mimiko's house. What will Mimiko do?

Both are lovely touching stories, that every adult and child should see. You can choose between English Dubbed or Japanese with English subtitles, both are great options. As with all Discotek releases, the video, audio and extras have been upgraded substantially beyond previous releases. Never seen before extras include the original trailer, a 13 minute storyboard and  40 minute interview with one of the directors. If your child enjoyed any of the previous Ghibli stories, particularly My Neighbor Totoro then pick this up now.

Rating - A",1344124800,6,1269,4.911214953271028
5032846,4,B006X6P1S6,"This movie's bitrate is quite a bit lower than on the Japanese release (approx. 5 megabits per second on average compared to 7) but it's excusable considering that it's on a single-layer disc and has to fit the movie, the 40-minute interview with Isao Takahata, and about 20 minutes of other special features.  Panda Go Panda isn't a movie that has many fast-paced action sequences, so it's really not an issue when watching it.

The only true problem is that the authoring house set the aspect ratio flag incorrectly for the 13-minute ""Panda Go Panda Exhibit"" special feature, so the video appears vertically stretched in a 4:3 ratio instead of the player converting the natively anamorphic video into widescreen like it should.  Depending on what DVD player and TV you have, you may be able to force the video into a widescreen format by using an adjustable ""zoom"" function.  Even if you can't, the movie itself and the major bonus feature (the Takahata interview) are natively 4:3 full-screen, so they aren't affected by this issue.  When you take into account that Eastern Star is a relatively small label, I'm willing to give them a pass in this instance.

Before you think about skipping this release and getting the somewhat techinally superior Japanese release, remember this:  While the Japanese release has a higher video bitrate as well as English audio and subtitles for the main feature, its extras lack English subtitles.  Also note that it costs about $50, which is about 3x what I paid for this release from Eastern Star.  As for the previous US release from Pioneer/Geneon, it's long out-of-print and doesn't have any substantial extras.  Even if it were available at a reasonable price, I'd rather own this release instead.

All said, considering that I didn't have any hope of ever getting Panda Go Panda at a reasonable price after Pioneer/Geneon went out of business, I give a sincere tip of the hat to Eastern Star for rescuing the license to this and putting out a very good DVD.  Thumbs up!",1335225600,21,2014,4.839650145772595
