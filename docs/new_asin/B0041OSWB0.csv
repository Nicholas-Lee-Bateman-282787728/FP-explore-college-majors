This game is a semifinal of the first BIG APPLE NIT(preseason). Ironically, two teams that would end their season in the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament begin their season in the Final Four of the preseason NIT. And they play like it! Fast paced, highly competitive, and tight throughout as the two heavyweights deliver a game worthy of their lofty status and the high expectations that made up there 1985-86 season. Of course, there can be only one champion and this Friday night in November would have no baring on that Monday night in April. An entertaining and enjoyable viewing experience.",1309132800,,614,4.857142857142857
