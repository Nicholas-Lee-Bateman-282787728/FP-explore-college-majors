The girl is alone somehow in an old mansion taking care of herself, not eating properly and addicted to cheep ramen. She avoids human relationships and has this idea she does not need them because she is a doll. This fantasy keeps her from having to deal with past or start new human relationships which she will risk being hurt emotionally. She is lonely though so calls up spirits using an spooky Asian board game. She feels they can not hurt her being deep in the fantasy she is plastic and can not be hurt. The first spirit that appears lucky for her is one who promised to protect her when she was young. He proceeds to become like a father or mother figure in her life she lacks. Caring for her. Spirits in story can shift between male and female modes. Other spirits more dangerous also come to live in her house, soon the comedy commences. Story expands to include some western movie myths like extra terrestrial beings. This anime is fun to cosplay also. The characters are basic and outfits not difficult.",1439078400,,1077,4.528205128205128
