For the first month or so, I had to be there every time to witness the ""wild music "" and interpret the unfolding narrative.  After that it became her somewhat private and magical journey into the fantastical.  I buy this video and the book for every young child I know. I can still conjure up the sounds of great laughter and glee that this masterpiece evoked.",1384560000,,438,4.45
