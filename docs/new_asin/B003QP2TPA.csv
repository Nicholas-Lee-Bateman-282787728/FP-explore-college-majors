Revenge Of The Cybermen is an authentic classic for Tom Baker's Doctor Who and is so well loved it was the first story to be released on VHS home video, which is well documented in the included extra Cheques, Lies and Videotape. A very interesting piece for the history of home video and Doctor Who enthusiasts.
The story itself is a bit weak, more time devoted to character development and maybe the history of the Cybermen would have improved it. Missed potential. I think six episodes instead of four and this would be a masterpiece!
But all this being said many elements come together in a harmonious way to make an indisputable classic. It is just Super Fun and very expressively stylish.
 The Cybermen have an intense presence here, I wish we were given more to understand them.

Silver Nemesis, the other story in this set is from 1988, the Sylvester McCoy period. It was intended as a vehicle to celebrate the 25th (Silver) anniversary of the series but there is no obvious mention.
I had no prior experience with this era of Doctor Who and it was quite a jolt.
It is an interesting story with updated but still mysterious Cybermen, a time traveling sorceress with male assistant  and 1988 Neo Nazis all seeking an ethereal being made of living (silver?) metal.
Quite silly and goofy overall. It hurts a little to see that Doctor Who had become so banal by this time.
Throughout this story the Doctor is referred to as Professor by his young female companion and in their last scene together she asks, ""Professor? Doctor? Who are you? What are you? Where are you from?""
Pathetic. I should think at this late in the game she would know. The series had just one more season to go.
We never even get to enter the Tardis once in The Silver Nemesis. Disappointing.
As far as I am concerned Doctor Who had run its course by the time Tom Baker left. It is fascinating to watch his Doctor's past pass before our eyes at the end of the story Logopolis. The end of an unforgettable era.
Where else to go from the top?

Revenge Of The Cybermen is definitely from The Top. It makes this release extremely worthwhile, especially at this time when the NTSC Region 1 version is selling for around $100!
The Silver Nemesis is from The Bottom, a sad example of how something fades away or changes with time.
If it weren't for international sellers I would never have been able to see this and many other classic Whos.

Very satisfied.
