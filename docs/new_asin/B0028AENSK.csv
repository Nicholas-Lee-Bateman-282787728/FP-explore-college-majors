3872214,5,B0028AENSK,Can't miss! Midsomer Murders is one of the best British series we've stumbled across. My sister and I can't wait for set 14 to get here--we just got set 13 and  have already watched 3 of the 4 episodes! All we need is a glass of wine and the big screen tv for a most enjoyable evening with DCI Barnaby!,1257033600,9,302,4.033333333333333
3872215,5,B0028AENSK,"As a long time fan of the Midsomer Murder series, I obviously enjoy the great mysteries. You just can't figure out ""who done it"". But there is an added plus to these stories, and that is the beautiful sets. Whether the action takes place in mid-summer or fall or winter or spring, the sets are absolutely beautiful - especially if you are a student or fan of architecture and/or gardening. The sets, both indoor and out, are gorgeous. Where else do you get a story that would qualify for an Edgar, as well as an award from ""House and Garden""? What a wonderful couple of hours to give yourself!",1253491200,27,593,4.4495412844036695
3872216,5,B0028AENSK,"(if you are shopping for season 14, then I assume you know the basics already; still I am including the show outline in the PS paragraph; hope this helps)

This is such a LOOOOOONG wait, but...I thought I would share a few thoughts on the upcoming episodes: Death and Dust, A Picture of Innocence, They Seek Him Here, and Death in a Chocolate Box (eps 56 thru 59). All four were originally aired on British TV from May 2007 to May 2008. The US Feb 2010 DVD release date means we are more then two years behind. Ghrrrrr.... Still, I believe these episodes are well worth the wait: Barnaby himself becomes a murder suspect (!), MM's trademark inventive murder tools make an appearance (including a guillotine!), and we see the return of Simon, Cully's (Barnaby's daughter's) intended. Alas, Cully's wedding (episode 60) is still a long time coming (according to Acorn, set 15 has a tentative release date of June 2010, and set 16 of Oct 2010; we will have THREE sets, rather then the usual two in 2010!!!).

As excited as I am for season 14, according to Brian Tru-May, the show's executive producer, there are many well known actors interested in guest starring in future episodes, including Michael Caine, Roger Moore, and Johnny Depp (!!!). I hope this great show goes on forever! ;o) Still, no word on who is taking over for John Nettles when he retires...

UPDATE (Feb 10, 2010): Nettles' replacement has been revelaed. I have included the details in Set 16 review.

PS: For those new to this British masterpiece, Midsomer Murders is a long running ""who done it"", based on the novels of Caroline Graham, starring John Nettles (of the Bergerac fame) as the unflappable Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby. The series is set in the fictional Misomer County, which comprises of many cosy, rural villages, where wealthy and poor alike seem to do each other in at an average rate of three to four bodies per episode. The series has a worldwide following, not in the least due to the creative and macabre ways in which the MM victims are typically dispatched.",1252886400,122,2054,4.713091922005571

We've just about finished this collection and look forward to settling into a mystery with detective Barnaby. It's nice to find a main character with a ""normal"", happy family life. The characters are a bit quirky. The plots are intricate and have a definite English twist to them, which makes it nice for something different from our American series (which we also enjoy). Very entertaining!
The only drawback is that every now and then we get a disk that sticks. I hate to miss any of the stories due to this. Still giving it 5 stars because we enjoy the series so much.",1411171200,,643,4.649122807017544

3872281,5,B0028AENSK,"This is another in the long-running BBC series about Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby, an interesting, easy-to-watch, murder-after-murder in 100 minutes, yet not violent series, so viewers who are disturbed by violence before bedtime can watch the film in bed without fear.

 This story focuses on three deaths. The first occurred about a dozen years ago, when a man was convicted for beating his wife to death with a single blow from a blunt instrument. His wife allowed herself to be arrested every Friday, spent the night in jail, and had sex with many of the precinct's police officers. The second death, some dozen years later, is the same kind of killing of a man who was the police sergeant at the precinct, who did not report the Friday night escapades, and quit after they were publicized. He is married to a woman who was also a police officer at the time. She resigned with him for undisclosed reasons. The two moved to a village that had a halfway house. She trained as a psychiatric counselor. The two help released prisoners after they serve their time. One of their patients is the husband of the first murdered woman. Both this husband and the murdered man take tranquilizing drugs. The third murder is another released prisoner who came to the village to the halfway house. It is soon clarified that the postman was also a member of the Friday night escapades. Barnaby needs to unravel what is going on and who is the murderer in this delightful and unusual story.",1309478400,,1486,4.7335907335907335

3872285,4,B0028AENSK,"Midsomer murders has always been rather tongue and cheek and quirky. And that's what we love about it , this set is perhaps the least quirkiest  of any set I have yet seen though. But with the always wonderful John Nettles (who is leaving after his next season) leading the stories who can complain! ( I can't really see this show without him but I may be wrong , only the future will tell) I can say that not one of these episodes is bad in anyway though and no fan of the series will not like this set. The stories are good enough and some might complain they just aren't as great as what came before but they still are very much midsommer murder territory.  I saw the 16 set before this one and that one was in my opinion a better set. But for a show this age it has yet to ever let me down really, and that's outstanding for a 12 year old series.  The dvds look as good as ever with the usual lack of extras that british detective shows give us over here on dvd.  but I am just glad to see these be released as this is a show that will live on long after it's gone because of it's quirkiness and sure fun.",1283644800,,1109,4.004524886877828

28 August 2007 (Season 10, Episode 8)

Meets all the Midsummer's standards and again is a tad darker than previous presentations. Screenplay by Tony Etchells.

In a town referred to as a chocolate box, which is used as a halfway house for emerging convicts, we see the ceremony as the populace turns over.  What starts out festive may turn onto cranky murders. Everyone acts creepy and anyone could have done it. Turns out Barnaby (John Nettles) happens to be there because he has old friends and possibly enemies.

On a more domestic front, Joyce (Jane Wymark) Barnaby's wife seems to always be miffed at him ""Well that shows how much you know about romance.""

As with all the Midsummer's episode, we see British actors from different films and series. In this case, we get to see Edward Petherbridge whom made an excellent Lord Peter Wimsey.",1278720000,,870,4.773333333333333

And without the unnecessary Sex, Grafic Violence, Cruelty, and Vulgar Language.

Anyone old or young would enjoy these programs.",1277510400,,421,5.147058823529412

3872290,4,B0028AENSK,"It's pretty amazing that even after several years, ""Midsomer Murders"" is still one of the most entertaining TV shows on British TV. And ""Midsomer Murders: Set 14"" is a thoroughly solid set of cozy, English-village murder mysteries solved by a clever pair of coppers -- a couple of the murders are relatively easy to unravel, but the writing and acting are still strong.

In ""Death and Dust,"" a young doctor is hit by a car and killed. Barnaby soon realizes that the other driver was attempting to murder his partner Dr. Kirkwood -- who has just gotten engaged to divorcee Delyth Mostyn, much to the horror of her kids. To unravel a mess of financial and personal crimes, Barnaby and Jones will have to air out the Mostyn family skeletons in Wales.

""A Picture of Innocence"" is hard to get when a member of an elite camera club (and his nemesis) are strangled with their own equipment. And weirdly enough, Barnaby is the prime suspect. When he gets bumped from the case, Barnaby must do some investigation of his own -- including finding out who around town is pretending to be him!

""They Seek Him There"" when a new Scarlet Pimpernel movie is being filmed at Magna Manor... and the obnoxious director turns out to have a whole swarm of enemies. Then they find him beheaded by the prop guillotine -- and Barnaby and Jones have to work out who hated him enough to kill him, and stop them before they kill again...

Finally, in ""Death in a Chocolate Box"" leads to another murder when an ex-cop is bludgeoned to death in the woods, shortly after seeing Barnaby. Now Barnaby and Jones must unravel a decade-old police sex scandal, which led to a brutal murder in the village's camera obscura... but when your only suspect is a polite old man with bouts of amnesia, something is undoubtedly wrong.

""Midsomer Murders: Set 14"" has pretty much everything you'd expect from this show -- brutal and bloody murders, financial problems, old scandals, ancient manorhouses, and lots of lovely little English villages surrounded by lush forests. As an extra bonus, ""Death and Dust"" even takes us to Wales, and gives viewers a glorious aerial view of its wild beauty.

The set isn't quite perfect, since ""They Seek Him There"" is a relatively lackluster episode, and the murderer's identity is pretty obvious. But the other three are excellent, with the usual tight writing and intricate interconnected crimes -- Barnaby and Jones have to chase down some red herrings before getting their man (or woman).

It also helps that the writers still interweave some humor (Jones being menaced by an elderly man who tells him, ""I used to box for Eton!""), as well as quiet, everyday moments for the cops. And Barnaby's personal life is seamlessly intertwined with his cases -- he has to grapple with someone pretending to be him, being a suspect, and even a father's worst nightmare: his daughter getting engaged!

""Midsomer Murders: Set 14"" is a solid collection of veddy veddy British murder mysteries -- one is a little lackluster, but the rest are good stuff.",1276560000,,3037,4.771428571428571
3872291,5,B0028AENSK,I received this set of Midsomer Murders and we have watched every DVD.  We had no problem with any of them and they appeared to be a high quality set.  My experience with ordering anything from Amazon.com has always been good.  I do not hesitate to order when I see their name as the seller.,1274832000,,291,4.254545454545455
3872292,5,B0028AENSK,"First I want to to mention that on the front of the DVD reads:
The British Rural Version of Law & Order as cited by The
Sanfrancisco Chronicle. That has to be the most bizarre statement
ever uttered by anyone. There is absolutely no resemblance whatsoever of Midsomer Murders to Law and Order. Law and Order
does have some excellent actors but takes place mostly in a
court or  on NY streets and contains a goodly amount(though not
as much as Law and Order Special Victims) of very gross
descriptions of the bodies of the victims. Midsomer Murders takes
place in a quaint village in England and revolves around the
townspeople and their lives that once in a while manage to get out
of whack. In other words they are good old mystery stories.
I understand there will be at least a set 15 but not sure more
are coming. The US has such a dearth in good acting and well
written movies that I really hate to see Barnaby go. I's really
sad that we have to wait anxiously for another good British movie
to come out to satisfy our cravings for really good acting and
superb movies. HOpefully if Barnaby decides to turn in his
badge, someone else ""across the pond"" will give us more
delightful movies.",1274572800,,1192,4.442922374429224
3872293,5,B0028AENSK,"Just caught up with set 14 and I thought the final episodes, They Seek Him Here and Death in a Chocolate Box were two of the best-plotted and -acted shows in the series which now has lasted twelve years, happily with no end in sight.
  I hope the new lead, Tom Barnaby's nephew, can ably step into John Nettles' rather large shoes.
  I've heard that moderately priced region-2 dvd players can be unreliable or I'd buy one to view the many British TV shows and movies that are either unavailable in the U.S. or are delayed for years, like MM.",1274400000,,541,4.38

3872297,5,B0028AENSK,"I have watched the ""Midsomer"" series from the very beginning and have seen it go through various changes and some growing pains. The most recent installment (at least on this side of the Atlantic) has four new episodes, nicely subtitled for those who can not always make out the dialogue through music and assorted noise, and offers the usual mixture of suspense, dry wit and quirky British small-town atmosphere. John Nettles and his crew are as good as ever. There is some occasional blurring in the picture when people are in motion. Perhaps a sign of less than careful camera work? The scripts are also somewhat uneven, as can be expected with any series. Regardless, I would not miss it for anything.",1270512000,,705,4.786885245901639

3872308,4,B0028AENSK,"As other reviewers of Set 14 of Midsomer Murders series have noted, its arrival on this side of the pond is well worth the wait.  As has been the case throughout the long run of Midsomer Murders, there are enough red herrings (although, I guess the term should be ""blue herrings,"" in Midsomer) that the viewer's suspicions are cast around the entire ensemble of quirky characters.  The tradition of villages filled with sexual deviance, characters with bizarre affectations, and multiple murders for reasons that are not clear until the final 5 minutes of each episode continues.  So, why not 5 stars?  Some of the energy is missing in Set 14, the image of DCI Barnaby in a suit in sharp contrast to some of the residents of the villages mysteriously vanishes, and the production company's use of actors from previous years is not as satisfying for long-time fans as using new actors might have been.  For example, the image of a obsessive bell ringer and a somewhat-Gothic-looking innkeeper with a buried history of serial murder are so firmly etched on long-time fans that when the actors who portrayed those characters in past seasons are cast as members of an ultra-conservative camera club in Set 14 it just doesn't work as well as it might have.  Still, Set 14 is strong, and it redeems the series from the Set 13 episode, ""The Axeman Cometh,"" one of the least successful episodes in the entire run of the show.  Midsomer Murders is required weekly viewing in our house, and we're looking forward to seeing Cully's wedding in Set 15.  By the way, as John Nettles' run as DCI Barnaby comes to a close, one of the major regrets of the entire Midsomer Murders series is that Caroline Graham's book ""A Ghost in the Machine"" was never produced for the television series.  The Long and the Tall (for all you long-standing Midsomer Murders fans...): fans should buy Set 14; it is not, however, the strongest set in the run of the series.",1268611200,5,1936,4.704142011834319
3872309,5,B0028AENSK,I'm a huge fan of Midsomer Murders Fan. My constant frustation is the new series of Midsomer Murders is not producing fast enough. I love the Picture of Innocence and The Chocolate Box. I miss the cast interviews. I would to see it on future Midsomer Murders sets. I miss not seeing the series in the USA. We really miss the boat. I can't wait until June for set 15.,1268092800,,366,4.242857142857143

This is what it is like in our little villages mind you there cannot be many people alive in Midsummer. But hey the story lines are so good and Brian True May the director is known for his good directing skills,he directed Coronation Street for years and that's been going for over 40 years and still going. So folks enjoy these little bits of our country life in our sleepy little villages.

If you are a fan of Midsomer Murders, then you will DEVOUR this last batch, four episodes, in one sitting and SAVOR them later! I am a fan, they were devoured in one sitting and I will savor them for later.  I find I like the addition of 'Steven's' to the cast.  She adds a glow of someone waiting, semi-patiently, to get off the desk duty and become a 'real' part of Barnaby's circle.  Her character isn't in your face, but subtly, she's seen more and more.  I like that, a lot.  I, also, find I am liking Jones more and more.  All four episodes are solid, but, in my opinion, 'Death in a Chocolate Box' was superior!

The bonus disc is a duplicate for anyone who has purchased the 17 mystery super box of ""MIDSOMER MURDERS: BARNABY'S CASEBOOK"". That set had two bonus discs and this is one of those. For those buying this series one set at a time, the bonus disc will be a delightful added feature to your Midsomer Murders entertainment. So...Set 15 is a 4-disc pack, not 3. A value, and the episodes are suspensefully death-defying.
Order it now with your set 14--you WILL want them both.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Midsomer is the heart of murder. And the ""MIDSOMER MURDERS"" series is the heart of British Mystery Drama, and continues to be after a dozen years. It's longevity is it's greatest review recommendation. If you are new to Midsomer Murders, be made aware that Midsomer is the county of multiple murders. Almost never just one at a time. Barnaby (John Nettles) would not know what happened if he was left with only one body per case.

This 4 DVD set 14 contains 4 feature-length stand alone stories, but the same excellent regular cast. Besides DCI Barnaby, is wife Joyce (Jane Wymark) and daughter Cully (Laura Howard). They add a family home-life plot to every episode, always interrupted by the murder investigation underway. The ladies also add a delicate touch of romance to the show. Jason Hughes plays DS Jones, Barnaby's right hand man.

It is the delightful mix of murders, crime fighting, romance, and even some comedy relief; in other words a blend of sub-plots with a major multi-murder plot that makes this show one for almost anyone. Well, except maybe the REVIEWING YOUNG, someone to young to appreciate the bestseller style of suspense/mystery/romance/drama that sells millions. This show is based on the novels of Caroline Graham. It's not a comic book depiction on DVD, like YOUTH ORIENTED shows with super-action animated figures. MIDSOMER MURDERS will require some intellect to enjoy, as millions of viewers have pleasantly found.

These more recent episodes contain many award winning guest stars.
Episode 1, DEATH AND DUST, involves a murder related to an intended marriage between 2 older people with children quite vocally unfavorable to the idea. It is a delight to see Stephanie Cole (Doc Martin, great series-check it out) playing the former mother-in-law to the male of the pair. A rare episode with only one murder.
...PICTURE OF INNOCENCE, has to do with shootings, digital vs film, even a camera duel, but the murders are identical MO head bashings, all by the same odd metal instrument. Well it is a part of a large camera of sorts. Not the first time Barnaby becomes something of a suspect.
...THEY SEEK HIM HERE, a has been director plods on in a cheap version of Scarlet Pimpernel, complete with guillotine on the set. The murder apparatus is predictable, but certainly not the murderer. As with all MIDSOMER MURDERS, not good for children.
...DEATH IN A CHOCOLATE BOX, Like all Midsomer stories, this one again provides the picturesque setting, like a calendar photo, but a deep dark secret from the inside of the jail cell, ex-cons now on the outside, and corpses leave stains on the panoramic vista. Can Barnaby make tranquility return to the village?

Did I mention all episodes DO have subtitles?
Barnaby probably averages a murder every 30 minutes. That's fast-paced mystery and suspense to me! THE BEST FROM BRITAIN--PERHAPS BEST IN THE WORLD.

If you like MIDSOMER MURDERS, there is two collection boxes of episodes now available. 17 episodes in ""Midsomer Murders: Barnaby's Casebook"" (see my review) & ""Midsomer Murders - The Early Cases Collection"" contains 18 episodes.",1264550400,12,3901,5.012345679012346
3872315,5,B0028AENSK,"I read with amusement the unfavorable review; the one suggesting this show puts the ""old folks"" to sleep. I submit that if you have ADHD and need a new stabbing or shooting every 30 seconds then this is not the show for you.  If you're hooked on graphic violence or gratuitous violence to keep your interest...then keep that remote in your hand and keep changing channels.  On the other hand, if you're looking for a show where there's a little more character development, where you feel like you're getting to know the personalities of the key players then keep watching. If you're just as happy to have the violent beating, stabbing, strangling, and shooting take place ""off camera"" then you'll enjoy Midsomer Murders. If you enjoy trying to ""figure out"" the motive and identity of the culprit, this is a very good show. I enjoy ""A Touch of Frost,"" ""Inspector Morse,"" ""Prime Suspect,"" and ""Foyle's War"" as well. Tom",1262995200,43,917,4.761006289308176

Midsomer Murders does not have all these things, just good story lines, excellent character development and real actors. And as far as being ""Cute"", what planet do you come from? I am a huge mystery buff and own all the Frost, Morse, Inspector Lindley, Miss Marple, Piroit, Rough Diamond (another gem) and Sherlock Holmes DVD's and Midsomer Murders is right up there with these oustanding, well developed shows. I'm an American and let me tell you, I would rather watch all of the above shows than all the crap (with the exception of NCIS)that is on American TV.
