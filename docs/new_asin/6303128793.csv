570113,5,6303128793,"""It's fifty cent hack ride down to the bottom of Nob Hill but it takes a million dollars to get back up.""
Such are the memorable words of John Payne, musical performer and production impressario, in ""Hello, Frisco Hello.""  Payne's musical review with romantic interest Alice Faye along with Jack Oakie and June Havoc achieves success along San Francisco's Barbary Coast.  The ambitious Payne, however, has much more in mind.  He wants to become a major player in the ritzy Nob Hill scene.  Faye has the common sense to know that Payne is getting in over his head, but is powerless to stop him when he meets society matron Lynn Bari.  She has a social name and standing but is currently broke while Payne believes she is his key to cracking the big time so they unite.
Alice Faye impresses moviegoers because of her inner sincerity as well as her unswerving loyalty.  When Payne ultimately strikes out with Bari, who tells him bluntly, ""I never said I loved you,"" Alice, after a successful performing run in London, sneaks money to drunken visionary Laird Cregar, who had previously panhandled Payne, convincing him that the money is no more than a loan, and that he will eventually strike it rich by finding gold.  Payne, immensely prideful, accordingly believes that his own gold earnings are bankrolling his shows, not the fiercely loyal Alice.  Eventually Cregar reveals the truth by accident when he has had too much to drink...",1011571200,15,1432,4.816326530612245
570114,5,6303128793,I love this film! It's a mythical and musical romp through San Francisco (as seen by 1943 Hollywood.) It's survived the test of time and changing sensibilities remarkably well unlike other movies of the era...just lots of toe-tapping music and campy stage settings of SF landmarks.,1004054400,4,281,5.130434782608695
570115,5,6303128793,"Hollywood legend Alice Faye was at the peak of her career when she made this costume musical drama. She is knockout in all her numbers, particularly so in the title song, and ""Doin' the Grizzly  Bear.""
In this one, she is reunited with one of her favourite  co-stars, the darkly-handsome John Payne, and the comedy relief comes from  old timer Jack Oakie, and June Havoc, who was the character Baby June in  the musical ""Gypsy"" - the sister of the famed Gypsy Rose Lee, who  walked out on Mama Rose while a teenager to find fame in Hollywood! A  tuneful musical, beautifully photographed in Technicolor. Miss Faye never  looked lovelier.",956016000,18,637,4.736363636363636

570225,5,6303128793,"Very Nice.  Excellent, in fact.  Beautiful!  What I really like about this movie and all movies from the 1940's and 1950's is the use of super fantastic Technicolor! (especially when 20th Century Fox would film in Technicolor!)  I have found it truly inspirational and joyous to watch Technicolor films of this time period.  I have found this particular Technicolor film to be truly inspirational and joyous to watch.  Technicolor makes these films look heightened,  more than full of life, ""Hyper-Real"".  This film is no exception.  There are some films of this time period that are exceptions, that do not inspire, that do not induce joy, however, this film is not one of those.  As I have already written, this Technicolor film is truly inspirational and joyous!  And I don't mind writing it again for emphasisthis Technicolor film is truly inspirational and joyous!  The delightful colors of the costumes (and the costume designs themselves)SUPERB!  The makeup and hairMAGNIFICENT!  The gorgeous actresses (Bari, Faye) and handsome actors (Payne)BEAUTIFUL!  The direction by H. Bruce HumberstoneMASTERFUL, FREE, FULL OF MOTION, SPOT ON!  The musical numbers and choreographyARTFUL, LIVELY,  HAPPY, WITH A FEELING OF SPONTANEITY!  As an author, designer, and illustrator, I find inspiration from many elements.  Two of those elements are Technicolor films from the 1940's and 1950's, like this one, and music of the same time period.  There are inspirational gems in the films and in the music that I fill my mind with and draw from when creating.  It's more about what I'm ""SEEING"" as a designer/creator than what I'm seeing or hearing regarding the actual movie or music.  If you would like to see the creative result of being inspired, energized, enkindled, animated, quickened by Technicolor films of the 1940's and 1950's, as well as jazz, swing, and big band music of the same time period, then view the illustrations and design in my Art & Design / How-To book, Cartoon Design Revealed by visiting this Amazon.com page:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cartoon-Design-Revealed-Kristian-Andrew-Sather/dp/1478710217/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cartoon Design Revealed Kristian Andrew Sather</a>&nbsp;One never knows where inspiration will come from, when a joyous event will enter ones life, however, it's pretty near a guarantee that when the first Technicolor image from this movie is seen on your TV screen or device, you will understand, you will know.  Enjoy!",1376179200,,2513,5.5552631578947365
570226,5,6303128793,"I love this movie and have watched it several times of the years.  Alice Faye is beautiful, has such a lovely voice and she carries this fim.  I guess I am old-fashioned:  I like movies that are up-lifting, clean and have happy endings!  There were old vaudeville acts and 2 modern songs, especially ""You'll Never Know"" which captured the feelings so many experienced during World War II.",1375660800,,388,4.746268656716418
570315,5,6303128793,"Hello, Frisco Hello is a fine Fox musical featuring the wonderful Alice Faye; her fans will be delighted as she sings many numbers in this film and she never lets go of a superfluous note! I really like those song and dance numbers. In addition, the acting by all was excellent and very convincing; the sets were also very well done with great thought given to detail. The choreography and cinematography shine and the background musical score also enhances the film.

When the action starts (and there's plenty of it), Johnny Cornell (John Payne) and his fine little troupe of Trudy Evans (Alice Faye), Dan Daley (Jack Oakie) and Beulah Clancy (June Havoc) are entertaining the crowd in a club/nightspot run by Sharkey (Ward Bond) who balks and fires them after Johnny tries a new routine that wows the crowd so much they leave the bar, stop buying drinks and become fixated by the act! Johnny gets the great idea to perform on the streets for a charitable mission using their license to perform on the street--just so long as nobody knows that Johnny is actually getting lots of money from the owners of the saloon keepers and nightclubs (including Sharkey) to stay away from their nightspots! Ultimately Johnny, Trudy, Dan and Beulah get to climb the ladder; Johnny has his own theaters and they can put on their own shows.

Meanwhile, there's a kinda-sorta romance between Johnny and Trudy that ambles along until one night the wealthy heiress Bernice Croft (Lynn Bari) and her pals enter one of Johnny's nightspots--and Johnny has a thing for her at first sight. It isn't long before Bernice gets her selfish paws all over Johnny who doesn't exactly mind even though he knows in the back of his head that Trudy is hurt and saddened by this. Trudy gradually gravitates toward Bernice's friend Ned Clark (John Archer) and Bernice slowly but surely attracts Johnny to the point where he wants to help Bernice out quite a bit after Bernice loses everything! Johnny ultimately spurns Trudy altogether and he doesn't seem to truly care! Johnny decides to marry Bernice partly so she can set him up in the ritzy world of San Francisco's Nob Hill with fine opera and ""society;"" but this sets off a chain of unexpected events that nobody anticipated.

I've actually left out some plot detail and there's much more to the story than just this; but I'll stop here so you can watch and enjoy this film as much as I did! Suffice it to say that the rest of the film shows how all the issues play out.

Look also for solid performances by Laird Cregar as Sam; Frank Darien as a missionary; Charles Cane as Officer O'Riley; Frank Orth as Lou, the bartender at Sharkey's and Frank M. Thomas as the auctioneer. Watch closely you'll also see Gino Corrado in an uncredited role as an opera singer.

The DVD also comes with some nice bonus features. I particularly enjoyed ""Hello Again: The Remaking of Alice Faye"" featurette and the restoration comparison.

Hello, Frisco Hello is a must-have film for fans of the actors in it and people who appreciate classic movie musicals will not be disappointed. In addition, anyone who likes romantic comedies with excellent musical numbers from the golden era of Hollywood would do well to get this film on DVD.",1373068800,,3237,4.7304964539007095

570318,3,6303128793,A good love story with performers of there day. Enjoy the western theme of Old San Francisco. Costumes and Music was fun and entertaining,1354838400,,137,4.75
570319,5,6303128793,"This is one of the best movies, the music is great and the costumes are fabulous. Being in color it so compliments Alice Faye especially the blues with her eyes. Hearing Alice Faye makes one want to meet her, always! She is one of my very most favorites! A good message and she gets it across with her special song, singing ""You'll never know how much I love you if you don't know now..."". I also appreciate the way the camera zeros in on her. So many of the movies for Alice with wonderful Carmen Miranda, had too little of Alice and more of Carmen; not fair in my opinion. (And as wonderful as Carmen was, she was superb without the tall headdresses, just being a wonderful actress. Would have loved more of Carmen without the ""hats"", she was so special that would like to ""see"" Carmen, not ""hats""!) But that is not in this movie, so back to this one. Not sure why June Havoc was not billed above Lynn Bari. Lynn was good, but June was more involved in the main sections of the entertainment with Jack Oakie. Should have billed them together.  Hollywood film makers! had a way of hurting folks that helped pay their bills! (Such as taking so much of Alice out of ""Fallen Angels""?? and promoting Linda Darnell.) Alice was super stuff. You feel it, you know it and I appreciate her wanting to be a mom, but sure miss having more of her movies. So grateful they made this one ""hers""! John Payne is always wonderful with her - do wish they would have stuck a good romantic scene a little more for this, but the movie is still exceptional and for all time! (And thank you Jesus, they did not slam the ""religious"" part like is normally done in films.) Did not want it to end, could have enjoyed more!",1335484800,,1696,4.333333333333333

570322,5,6303128793,"The important elements in this musical:  costumes, spectacular staging, some of the greatest singing and dancing talents in movies in 1943 (Alice Faye is a standout).  A few of the songs, ""You'll Never Know"" in particular, are memorable.  A somewhat sappy love story, but the fun is in the production and the energy of the performers.  Indulge yourself in a show that was nostalgic in the year it was made.

570384,4,6303128793,"""Hello Frisco Hello"" has finally made it to DVD and Fox have done a great job. This was one of Alice Faye's most famous musicals, rich in familiar  plot cliches but magnificently produced with spectacular colour, endless songs, great costumes and sets and Alice Faye's signature tune, ""You'll Never Know"", which is spellbinding and still a showstopper today.

Faye, John Payne, Jack Oakie and June Havoc, the talented sister of Gypsy Rose Lee, play small time entertainers who make the big time through Payne's entrepreneurial skills. Faye wears her heart on her sleeve, Payne does his standard macho turn and Jack Oakie and June Havoc add much needed vitality.

The DVD contains a restored print and the technicolour has never looked better. There are some excellent extras too. A featurette on Faye and her legacy has been included and her daughter Alice, Hugh Hefner, a huge Faye fan, and Miles Kreuger, that invaluable musical historian, among others appear. The featurette not only highlights Faye's underrated legacy as a pop singer but compares the film to an earlier Faye film, ""King of Burlesque"", noting how the same screenplay could be subtly shifted from Depression urgency to war time sentiment. It is odd that the featurette notes the contribution of Jack Oakie to both films but neglects to mention June Havoc, a fine performer in her own right. All the usual marketing bits are included such as the theatrical trailer and on set stills.  Last of all, there is a audio only track which dove tails the studio recording of the music into the film without the soundtrack.  Accordingly, we can hear the songs without interrruption - a delightful feature.

All in all, this is a good DVD, best value if purchased as part of the ""Alice Faye Collection Volume 2"".",1126656000,8,1771,4.906354515050167

Ultimately, Trudy does wise up but inexplicably, she still continues to carry a torch for the scoundrel who couldn't see her for spit.
