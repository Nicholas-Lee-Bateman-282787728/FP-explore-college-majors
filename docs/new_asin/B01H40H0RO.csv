7776397,3,B01H40H0RO,"Hard Target 2 stars Scott Adkins as Wes Baylor, a fighter who has exiled himself to Bangkok after accidentally killing his best friend in the ring. A broken man  drunk and riddled with guilt  he gets by with low-level local bouts. His fortunes change when millionaire Aldrich (Robert Knepper) offers him a million dollars for a huge fight in Myanmar. When he arrives, however, Baylor learns hes been tricked into becoming the target of a human hunt. To survive, he must outsmart the heavily armed group that has paid to hunt and kill him in treacherous jungle terrain.

Though the title suggests the film is a sequel to the original starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, it isnt. It owes more to The Most Dangerous Game and The Naked Prey, films in which a human is hunted as the ultimate big game. The hunters are stereotypically differentiated: a tough-as-nails woman, a matador, a tech geek, and a father-and-son duo. Their function is merely to be knocked off one by one, so essentially they're generic bad guys, but its interesting to see how the unarmed Baylor uses his wits and knowledge of human nature to turn the odds in his favor as the hunt progresses.

For a small-budget picture, Hard Target 2 delivers in the action category. The hunt doesnt begin until about a half hour in, but once it does, the action doesnt stop.

Bonus extras on the 2-disc, widescreen Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include commentary with director Roel Reine, stars Scott Adkins and Robert Knepper; deleted scenes; and the featurettes A Fighting Chance: Behind the Scenes, Through the Lens, Thrill of the Hunt, and Into the Jungle: On Location. A digital HD copy is included.",1473120000,,1650,4.81625441696113
7776398,4,B01H40H0RO,"The film opens with a man being hunted with crossbows in a warehouse and then goes six months earlier to Las Vegas where Wes ""The Jailor"" Baylor (Scott Adkins)  kills his friend Johnny ""Solid Gold"" Sutherland (Troy Honeysett) in a kickboxing match. Wes feels bad, so like most depressed kickboxers in films he moves to Bangkok and makes chum change fighting unsanctioned street fights living in pigeon filth.

Enter Aldrich (Robert Knepper) a man who promotes high purse unsanctioned fights. Baylor agrees to the fight in corrupt Myanmar, but is tricked into being the hunted as hunters from around the world peruse Baylor through the jungle whose talents as a kickboxer are not as meaningful as all that special ops stuff he now does. You can guess how it ends. I was confused by the opening hunt, expecting it to circle around to it with the six month information, but it does not. That was a separate hunt altogether, but is a tie-in. Arrows fly in slow motion, but didn't seem to add anything.

Standard protagonist hero being hunted film. Doesn't require thinking. Decent for what it was.

7776406,1,B01H40H0RO,"Never thought about asking for money back before but the reviews on this heap of hot mess are misleading to the point of suspicious. I'm a huge Scott Atkins fan. I think he's underrated and worthy of good scripts. This is not one of them. Unbelieveable to the point of just stupid and lazy when it comes to the fight scenes (the point of watching a Scott Atkins movie) and jammed into one of the most truly unoriginal, cliche, thoughtless, unwatchable stereotypes of not B level action films, but Z level waste of time, money, and attention.

He shoots a rocket launcher from his motorcycle at the main bad-girl character who doesn't try to avoid it, but instead starts walking in SLO-MO while the explosion fills half the screen but has no effect on her whatsoever as she pulls twin crossbows and shoots them in clearly different directions (you can tell from the camera angle). Seriously? ""Is this one of those parody movies"" I thought to myself...ok...maybe it can not suck if it's a parody.

It's not a parody. It's just a truly awful movie.

He then gets into a fist fight with this same woman. BUUTTTT despite the premise of the movie being him trying to overcome guilt from beating another fighter to death because of his fighting power he side kicks this lady THROUGH A BARN WALL....let me say that again THROUGH A BARN WALL!!! makes a smug comment and jogs away before she SHAKES IT OFF a FEW SECONDS LATER!!! ""Wait - am I watching Cyborg 2...that could be ok I guess"" I thought to myself.

No. It wasn't Cyborg 2. It was just a really really really bad movie.

It was a huge turd in the toilet of my viewing evening...and those are never Hard Targets.

7776408,4,B01H40H0RO,"I like the old 70's/80's martial arts films, especially the original Bruce Lee movies (not those crappy, rip-off Bruce LI schlock-fests). I also liked the No Retreat, No Surrender films. I bought this movie based on a preview that I saw on another Blu ray disc. Previews, film quality (very important to a good movie), and actors looked really good for this one. I watched this the other night with the following observations.

MAJOR PLOT SPOILER:
This movie is obviously a variation on the old ""The Most Dangerous Game"" story by Richard Connell and made into a movie of the same title back in 1932 starring Joel McCrae as well as in many other iterations since including ""Surviving the Game. The basic premise is that a rich guy captures/entices/ or tricks people into being hunted by the rich guy or other hunters who pay for the opportunity to hunt humans.

While not an original idea for a plot, it is still an idea that, if properly executed, makes for a fun popcorn movie experience. The beginning is a little slow as it sets up the story. But, the set up is necessary and made to positive effect. Scott Adkins is a decent enough actor and does a good job in this movie. When Adkin's character finds out what is really going on he reacts as you would expect a real person to react. With disbelief.

As I mentioned earlier, I like these kinds of martial arts movies. And this movie is better than most as evidenced by the excellent camera work and the bright, crisp, clean film stock which is indicative of professional cinematography and camera equipment. As opposed to cheaper, low budget films that use cheap cameras which render the images less clear and darker. Another factor that separates this movie from the schlock films out there are the actors. They're all pretty good. With Robert Knepper who makes for an excellent villain and the various ""hunters"" including Rhona Mitra.

SPOILER ALERT
There was a point where this movie did start to drop in quality. Up to the point where Adkin's character reached the minefield everything looked great. The ""mines"" in the ""minefield"" were not buried like real mines would be. They are black, sprinkler head looking thingies sticking up about 4 inches out of the ground. Passerby's could easily see and walk around these so-called mines. Also, one of the hunters throws a javelin at Scott Adkin's character and the javelin just happens to hit the ""sprinkler head"" sized mine head exactly on top of it activating the mine. Not very realistic. There are several other scenes where Adkin's character meets a jungle girl that speaks perfect English with a thick Australian accent in the jungles of Myanmar. He is running from the hunters, yet they take time off from the hunt to patch his shoulder wound and give thanks to the local deity.

Anyway, except for the films few flaws, it was a decent martial arts flick worth watching. And, it's way better a film than the original ""Hard Target"" movie with Jean Claude Van Dam which was garbage compared to this much superior and unrelated (except by title) movie. I just wished they had not used the title which makes people think of the Van Dam film which this has nothing to do with.",1488931200,,3182,4.695340501792114
7776409,4,B01H40H0RO,"I didn't even realize they had made a Hard Target 2 - until I saw it previewed on another bluray that I was watching and decided to give it a try.  Is it a great movie?  No, but it is pretty good.  Has a lot of good actors in it that tickled my funny bone to see in this movie.

Of course, the original Hard Target with Van Damme in it wasn't a great movie, either.  Humans are the ultimate prey in this movie.  Of course you got your good guys, your bad guys and lots of action, explosions and the like.  Pretty much an action story with a little love story thrown in - pretty basic story line.

This movie and don't get me wrong is a typically themed movie that we have all seen many times. Scott plays an MMA fighter who accidentally kills his best friend in the ring and of course retires until he gets an offer to fight for a million dollars. Well, it isn't what he thought he gets hunted by a group of people who have paid big bucks to hunt a man. As I've said nothing groundbreaking but Scott Adkins has been getting to be a more appealing actor these days. If you like action, here you go.

I like Adkins, he's a phenomenal martial artist, but he sucked in this. It's just one of those movies they cranked out with him that looks he got to combine his daily workout with a paycheck for a few weeks and ""bam"".

I'm usually a heavy/deep movie kinda guy, my wife likes all the easy on the brain material, my only weakness is fight movies. And I love a good B rate fight flick. This is F level, right up there with the new kickboxer.

7776422,2,B01H40H0RO,"I will give this flick 1 star for the great location shooting and another for Rhona Mitra. Other than that it is pretty poorly done and I have come to expect much more than this from Adkins. As others have commented, the people in the movie acted stupidly. Several times Adkins leaves the weapons of fallen enemies behind and when he finally does use a discarded M-16 he easily shoots down a dozen hapless soldiers with no effort whatsoever. The weapons action on display throughout this movie is actually cringe inducing. Unforgivably, the fights are boring as well. Not only are they short (the girl vs girl face-off lasts about 30 seconds) but lazily filmed. The final slugfest on the bridge is so poorly performed you can see the missed punches and kicks. This is not worthy of Adkins at all. I am not familiar with director Roel Reine, nor would I want to be. He is either lazy or incompetent, or both. I am, however, a fan of director Isaac Florentine ever since he helmed U.S. SEALS 2 lo these many years ago. He recently worked with Adkins on the flick CLOSE RANGE. This effort probably cost half of what was spent on HARD TARGET 2 and is a great example of what Adkins is capable of doing. Try that movie if you are looking to add to your collection. I am donating my copy of HARD TARGET 2 to the local Am Vets so they can check out Rhona Mitra.",1480377600,,1354,4.376984126984127

7776434,3,B01H40H0RO,"I loved the original ""Hard Target"" when it came out in the 90s, so had to see this sequel, even though it was obvious it would not be as good as its predecessor. It is a sequel only insofar as it retells the original ""Hard Target"" story, with a different hero and different villains. The pitch was clearly ""MMA star gets hunted through the Burmese jungle.""

The MMA bit is too obviously a sop to what's happened in the world of martial arts since Van Damme rose to fame via his karate. It's worked in convincingly ONLY insofar as it explains why the hero is in such good shape and able to so convincingly fight back. We are asked to believe that a prominent MMA star accidentally kills his best friend in the ring, goes off to Thailand, gets involved in a local fight circuit, then agrees to participate in some sort of unlicensed fight in Burma, run by a shady organization that actually wants him for a man hunt. Why the shady organization, which has previously used Burmese locals for its hunts, suddenly decides to take the risk of hunting a famous MMA fighter is never explained. Sickeningly, some of the people hunting him know exactly who he is.

Plot spoiler: the hero survives and all the hunters end up dead. No surprise there. Almost every film you've ever seen in which a hero is hunted through thick woodland is drawn on in some way. Scott Adkins is good, and the fights are great, albeit that he wins them too easily. But he is let down by the script and the direction, both of which conspire to make it purely a fight movie rather than a human interest movie. Little fragments of psychological interest are not allowed to develop. For example, one of the hunters is a young man called Tobias Zimling who doesn't really want to be there -- he's there just because his father thinks he needs to ""man up."" Then the father gets killed and Tobias wants to quit altogether, but is persuaded to stay in the hunt by the chief organiser and villain, played by Robert Knepper, who says he must avenge his father. However, we're not sure whether Tobias really wants revenge, or is just afraid of Knepper. He's becoming interesting. Meanwhile Adkins has got his hands on one of the hunters' bows and turns out to be a pretty good shot with it (as he is later with a M16). He manages to put an arrow through Tobias's shoulder. For a few seconds we wonder whether this will give Tobias an excuse to leave the hunt, or whether it will make him so mad that he'll now be 100% committed to killing Adkins. But then as Tobias topples over he happens to land directly on a landmine and is blown sky high. So much for human interest! All this happens in the space of 5 minutes.

It's hard to overstate how every possible clich is drawn on. These include 1) Adkins falls in with Burmese locals who happen to speak perfect English; 2) through them he experiences some sort of spiritual enlightenment, praying before a statue of the Buddha; and 3) he looks as good when he comes out of the jungle as he did going in, though does at least grow some designer stubble (I find it particularly annoying when heroes in action films somehow find time to shave each day, however desperate their circumstances, so am grateful for that stubble at least!).

It all makes for a moderately entertaining 100-minute film, but it could have been SO much better if the writers (Dominic Morgan and Matthew Harvey) and director (Roel Rein) had thought about how they could reinvent this sort of movie rather than just rehashing what has been done before.",1475971200,,3526,4.5046875

7776447,2,B01H40H0RO,"Extremely dopey ""sequel"" to John Woo's Hollywood debut Hard Target has the same basic concept as the original film--the one ripped off from the short story The Most Dangerous Game about a man who finds himself as the quarry in a big game style hunt.  Hunting an MMA fighter isn't exactly the greatest idea for one of these films--wouldn't it be more fun if they hunted some Rambo-like person who actually has wilderness survival skills?  Scott Adkins character is so dense he doesn't even have the sense to take the weapon when he kills his first hunter.  How can anyone be that stupid, even in a straight-to-video action movie?

This is directed by Roel Reine whose undistinguished career includes The Man With the Iron Fists 2; The Condemned 2; 12 Rounds 2: Reloaded; Death Race 3: Inferno; The Scorpion KIng 3: Battle for Redemption, etc.  See a pattern here?  Reine apes some of John Woo's style (the white birds; the slow motion; the camera trained on a crossbow bolt as the background flies by) making this the first Riel Reine film with some style, even if it is borrowed.  But this is ultimately as by the numbers as Rine's other schlocky straight-to-video sequels, mainly because the script offers little in the way of imagination or surprises.

Scott Adkins isn't the most likable action star in the world--he seems to have one expression, a scowl, and has none of original Hard Target star Jean-Claude Van Damme's charisma.  TV actor Robert Knepper (Prison Break; Heroes) is much better in the Lance Henrickson part, having fun as the ringleader behind the illegal hunt.  Temuera Morrison and Rhona Mitra are wasted as members of the hunting party.  Both are fine actors when given the opportunity, but it never really seems to arise here.

Hard Target 2 is fairly serviceable if your expectations are low enough, but like all of director Roel Reine's straight-to-video sequels it can't hold a candle to the theatrical original.",1473206400,,1939,4.860182370820668
