6290826,5,B00ISS5F9C,"This triple feature is really the best!
All movies have Spanish subtitle and English Tru hd audio 7.1 and Spanish mono audio.
The extras have Spanish subtitles.
All are a classic movies for all times.
True hd resolution, the box have the three disc together in the same pack, don't have a booklet.
All have extras and special features. I recommend to 100%. Better to buy this triple feature than one by one, it's the same edition in this pack.
