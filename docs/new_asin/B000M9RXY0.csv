8167462,5,B000M9RXY0,"90 minutes of concert footage from the 1986 Sandi Patti concert tour that was called ""Let There Be Praise!"" (taped from the Dallas, Texas concert tour stop), released by Word on VHS in America in 1987.  This tour featured most of the songs on Sandi's (then new) album ""Morning Like This"".  The production values on this video are very high and this is, more or less, the precise sights and sounds of a filled Sandi concert hall in the 1980's.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Morning-Like-This/dp/B00004SOTJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Morning Like This</a>",1186617600,2,602,5.988372093023256
