This is a very very strange little movie. But it's a good one, and if you like funny things, than you should watch it. It's independently made, starring very few people, most of whom are friends of the director.  While there is a plot, rather a clever and unique one, alot of things happen that have nothing to do with the plot, but then again, the things that are important to the plot don't really matter.

People who like this sort of thing will find this the sort of thing they like.

It's very silly, delightfully doofy, technically not the best quality, but certainly not bad quality at all. Love of whatever it is the director is trying to do shines forth.

If you have some spare money, you should buy it. It will make Joe very happy, and will make you happy too. Maybe not $15 worth of happiness, but at least $12 worth of happiness, the rest you can spend on popcorn. No, I don't think the writer was on drugs while writing it, even during the scenes that seem as if he was, because I know drugs are not in the directors budget.

So what are you waiting for? You only live once, and if you die without seeing this movie, then you'll still be dead, but at least you'll have chuckled more in your life, and maybe accidentally spilled soda all over your shirt.",1239753600,,1354,4.249027237354086
