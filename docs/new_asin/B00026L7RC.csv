Wai Lana is good as ever, but this video really can't be considered a fitness aid. All it contains is clips of different moves, when you click on the title its just her doing the move, no warmups or anything of the sort, no following moves to counteract the stretch like you're supposed to have. It does let you order the moves as you like and then you can play it sort of playlist style, but when you take the DVD out the order is not saved so you have to do it each time, that is if you remember the right order! I ended up selling this back on half.com, getting it was a huge waste of $, time, and effort. Proper yoga DVDs are just hard to find. Her show is amazing and actually shows you a full workout so you can get the beneficial effects that you're supposed to from yoga, too bad they don't sell copies of all the seasons!",1299110400,,1005,4.106598984771574
