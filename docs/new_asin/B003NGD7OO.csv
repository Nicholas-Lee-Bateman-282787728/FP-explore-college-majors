8617345,4,B003NGD7OO,"This album issued by Tekila Films under the title (in Spanish) of ""The First Two Movies of Pedro Infante"", also contains a third unadvertised film, ""Los Valientes no Mueren"", with Pedro Armendriz and Miguel Aceves Meja. As for the advertised content, it is not quite accurate that these are the very first two movies of Pedro Infante. He appeared in minor roles in three prior efforts from 1939. Both ""La Feria de las Flores"" and ""Jesusita en Chihuahua"" were released in 1942. The complete content of the two discs is as follows:

DISC 1:
LA FERIA DE LAS FLORES [El Valiente Valentn] with Antonio Bad (as Valentn) and Pedro Infante (minor supporting role)

DISC 2:
a) LOS VALIENTES NO MUEREN with Pedro Armendriz and Miguel Aceves Meja
b) JESUSITA EN CHIHUAHUA with Pedro Infante, Susana Guzar and Ren Cardona

In ""La Feria de las Flores"", Pedro Infante's role (without moustache) seems to be little more than providing quality singing to Antonio Bad's heroic efforts as the legendary Valentn de la Sierra, immortalized in the famous corrido. In ""Jesusita en Chihuahua"", Pedro Infante achieves shared star billing and gives a good performance as a tough and wily town administrator. Naturally, his singing ability helps liven up a humdrum script. These two movies are wonderful for those of us who love the genre. The quality of the print, however, leaves much to be desired. Both movies suffer from shaky, scratched and blurred images throughout, and, in ""La Feria de las Flores"", the audio is poor to the point of indistinct in places. I had to turn the sound up all the way to understand much of the dialogue. In that regard, the audio in ""Jesusita en Chihuahua"" is better, if quite far from perfect. Since none of the movies come with subtitles, Spanish, English or otherwise, it may be difficult to understand by non-native speakers. I suppose we should be grateful that these movies are available at all, particularly at such a bargain price.

The interesting surprise was the complete print of ""Los Valientes no Mueren"", tacked onto the second disc. It is an amusing little campirana with a familiar script, more of an excuse to hear good singing by Miguel Aceves Meja et al. than anything of more substance. The quality of this unexpected extra, is actually considerably better than the two principal offerings. Three stars for effort plus one for the surprise bonus picture.",1361491200,,2383,4.891089108910891
