CAIRO: Tamer Ezzat suddenly realized that most of his family and friends have immigrated or are thinking about leaving the country. An uncle in New Zealand; a cousin in the United States and another in Canada are but a few examples.

Stepping out and looking at the bigger picture, he realized his case is not unique but rather a prevalent phenomenon among friends and acquaintances. Later research further confirmed his belief.

The idea that a lot of people want to permanently leave their country of origin means that ""they are looking for something else and they want to belong somewhere else; they want to settle somewhere else,"" Ezzat concludes.

""Let's go back to the basic question,"" he says. ""Where is the place that you feel at home? And that was how I started thinking about the film.""

After a year of research, interviews, filming and editing associated with a necessary search for funds, Ezzat, the film's director, was standing in the corner of a packed hall in El Sakia as people flocked to watch his documentary The Place I Call Home.

Shown as part of the Euro-Arab Film Caravan, the film follows a group of four Egyptians toying with the idea of immigration. They are a combination of ""somebody going away, somebody [who] is thinking, somebody wants to stay [and] somebody coming in.""

But ""the film is not necessarily about immigration,"" notes Ezzat. ""It tries to find out an answer to the question of `the meaning of home' through ideas of those who are trying to immigrate.""

The film doesn't stop there. As it follows its four main characters, Miriam, Sebaei, Moataz and Hams, the film surveys a variety of local concerns such as economic stability, the sense of security, emotional ordeals and the characters' journey of self-discovery.

Hams El Gabry, an Egyptian who spent most of her life abroad, talked about her perception of the country and the character changes she has gone through. But participating in the film was also educational for her.
In one scene, the director decided to make his four main characters meet and discuss their problems. Coming from different backgrounds, they all had different perspectives. Listening to others' problems, El Gabry realized how lucky she is.

Also through the film, El Gabry adds, she realized that she can't change the society she is in and its negative aspects.

The one-hour documentary required 50 hours of footage and seven months of editing. But the film, unlike the local perception of documentaries, has fewer interviews and more drama.
