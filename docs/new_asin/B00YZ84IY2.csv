7269534,5,B00YZ84IY2,"What a great movie! The story of this family is so touching. It tells a story of resilience, persistence and brings to light many of the struggles that families with HD face everyday. Way to go Matt, Adam and everyone else who shared their story. I really enjoyed watching it!",1433980800,,276,4.54
7269535,5,B00YZ84IY2,"The family in the film has no doubt been torn apart for generations over this brutal disease that is Huntington's. To see their journey through the film is really quite amazing, more so in that it was able to be captured on film. A lesson for HD families and so many others facing illness. Enjoyed the film a great deal.",1433548800,,320,4.35

8719373,2,B00YZ84IY2,"This could have been an amazing depiction of Huntington's Disease and how it affects families and individuals.  However, it is clouded by the ""I told you so"" and ""i knew what was best"" and so on and so forth.  If these family members had just deferred attention to the disease instead of to their nonsense, this would have been a great film.",1504742400,,341,4.483870967741935
8719374,5,B00YZ84IY2,I appreciate this documentary very much. Huntington's disease also has it's bony fingers on my husband. I think HD is a thing everyone wants to run from when it's ugly head is reared. However it is our life and people like those featured in this film are our inspiration and our hope. Thank you for making this film if you should ever read this review and thank you for addressing some tough issues that few people address when trying to show how this disease decimates families. Thank you for showing that HD doesn't have to take away love.,1486425600,2,541,4.530612244897959
8719375,4,B00YZ84IY2,I especially enjoyed the last 10 minutes -- family members sitting around the campfire and talking opening and honestly.  Family is everything.,1483920000,,143,5.5
8719376,5,B00YZ84IY2,"This is tough subject matter to deal with. I live with this every day, my significant other is affected by HD, I give this five stars because what HD lacks in population, it more than makes up for in its effects. Some parts were hard to watch,hitting very close to home. I appreciate the struggle in caring very much for someone with HD, trying to move heaven and earth closer to help them participate, and the HD sufferer changes what we consider success. Thank you Matt for sharing your story.",1483920000,,495,4.511111111111111

8719380,5,B00YZ84IY2,"Matt's auntie Annalise is a dear friend, and I vividly remember the phone call one morning in 1996. The honesty and courage that the Austin family show in this film is profoundly moving.",1436745600,,186,4.666666666666667
8719381,5,B00YZ84IY2,"Fantastic movie! The struggles of this ugly disease are portrayed so well in this movie. I think it touches on many aspects of the disease - from living at risk to testing positive to testing negative, from living in fear to confronting the disease head on. Matt and Adam and the entire family are inspiring.",1436400000,,308,4.618181818181818
