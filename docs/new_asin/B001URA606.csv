8344718,4,B001URA606,"If you have ever wanted to see some cool slow motion camera effects, this is THEE perfect show for you! My only complaint was that the narrator/announcer guy gets to be really annoying making all sorts of corny statements as the show progresses. It really becomes a hindrance after a while!!!",1367020800,,292,4.745098039215686
8344719,3,B001URA606,"I must admit that I'm quite fascinated by slow-mo and things that we can see once we crank the speed down. It gives you quite a different (and interesting!) insight into how the world around us operates.

This series has a massive educational potential and to certain degree, it manages to reach the expectations. A few episodes will leave you amazed when you see what actually happens with objects that explode, crash etc.

Unfortunately, I think that authors didn't quite managed to deliver the excitement expected. Some of episodes are rather dull and offer nothing but mindless, short fun that will be forgotten once you're done watching it.

Still, I do recommend getting this BR as price is quite fair and you will enjoy some of episodes. For me, although I knew a lot of these things, it was still fun and educational to see it in slow-mo.",1359504000,,846,4.702702702702703

8344723,3,B001URA606,"I thought this would be a great Blu ray show off title, but there is was too little slow mo of interesting things and way too much chat yak blab and slow mo of really stupid things. Cheerleading in slow mo?? ReallY??",1277078400,,216,4.166666666666667
8344724,5,B001URA606,I am an 8th grade teacher and I show this in my science classes.  My students love watching this show.  They get to see things happen in slow motion and the show explains the science behind why things happen.  Educational and fun for the class.,1247097600,9,244,4.377777777777778
