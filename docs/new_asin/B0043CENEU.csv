4254980,5,B0043CENEU,"Knowledgable critics say this is a Lovecraft story.  I am vaguely familiar after purchasing one movie, The Whisperer In Darkness, based on a Lovecraft novel.  But i can tell you that I have become a fan of Spanish film making.  Hollywood should watch some of these and take heed.  This was a very good tale.  I like how the story was actually about the lives of two lovers unaffected by any aspect of the occult until much later in the story when their troubled lives somehow led to that.  Then the movie takes on a dark and forboding atmosphere.  I rented this one for free with Amazon Prime and I didn't expect much.  But it was one of the best Horror Tales I've seen.  Story telling is where it's at.  Someone please tell Hollywood.",1425945600,,735,4.417910447761194

4254982,4,B0043CENEU,I liked the film. Good acting and easy to follow even though it was in spanish with english subtitles. The film easily transitions between several time eras with different actors. Unfortunately there was no warning that the movie is in two parts and this is just the first half. I have not been able to find the second part.,1425340800,7,324,4.508474576271187
4254983,4,B0043CENEU,"This is infused with the velvety flavor and aura of a reasonably well produced European costume drama transitioning between the past and present.
It's pleasing to see how even subtle details are taken into consideration, such as the correct manner in which a gentleman takes a ladies hand as a gracious gesture of honorific respect; a practice of a bygone era and usually incorrectly depicted as an actual kiss by earlier American film makers; pre-Merchant & Ivory and the subsequent raising of standards for American period films.

There are even pleasant inferences to the social and political landscape of the day such as the women's suffrage movement to help establish the viewers time reference and cement the believability of the interaction between the characters.

I had wished the Aleister Crowley character had been toned down a bit. I  understand that he was possessed of a formidable persona and was a controversial figure of his day; not to mention a shameless attention seeker, but the filmmakers portrayal of Crowley is in dire need of a more subtle and intelligent approach to using him as a springboard for the unfortunate series of events that unfold as a result of misguided dabbling in dark-side occult rituals.

I disliked the inclusion of figures such as Lizzie Borden and Bram Stoker as participants in the ritual; I considered that a cheap trick and completely unnecessary.

The overall story, however, does remain firmly intact and thoroughly enjoyable; it succeeds admirably in holding the viewers interest and attention.
The sequence of events is flawlessly maintained while the growing urgency of events builds nicely to a predictable but logical conclusion.",1425081600,8,1686,5.1838235294117645
4254984,5,B0043CENEU,"Finally, there is a creepy film inspired by H.P. Lovecraft which does the material justice. Most people, I'm afraid, are all too familiar with the films made by Brian Yuzna in the 1980s. These were travesties of filmmaking and adaptation and were full of blood and gore as well as way too much sexually explicit material, neither of which was ever implied in any of Lovecraft''s writing. Possibly the worst atrocity of this group of films was ""From Beyond"" which is based on a story barely 3 pages long. Lovecraft's material was exhausted after ten minutes and the rest of the 2 hours is a mix of Stephen King, Dean Koontz and perverted sexual fantasy.
The Valdamar Legacy is actually just part one of a much longer story. It's not really based on a specific Lovecraft tale but rather is an original story told in true Lovecraftian style. Lovecraft fans will recognize elements from ""The Case of Charles Dexter Ward"", ""The Unnamable"", ""The Shunned House"" and ""Dreams In The Witch House"" among others. The filmmakers also state in the making of - documentary that they also drew from Bram Stoker, Mary Shelley, Edgar Allen Poe and the early work of Stephen King (in my opinion his only good work).
Lovecraft had three distinct styles and this film is in the least popular of those styles: the long-winded antiquarian style which is more suspense-thriller or detective-story than what most people today recognize as horror. For this reason, the story was divided between two films. The Valdamar Legacy is the set-up which tells the sad, frightening story of the Valdemar mansion while introducing the principle players in the story. Don't look for buckets of blood or explicit sexual scenes. The villains, once they appear, are true classic horror villains who are not so much seeking world domination as answers to extreme problems in their personal lives. And as with any attempt to use the Necronomicon (wheather good or evil) it goes horribly wrong.
The film itself is beautifully filmed in HDR style. In fact, I believe that HDR was made for just this kind of film. The acting is wonderful - plenty of great talent. But as this is a Spanish film, you won't recognize any of the names. The sets, locations and costumes are wonderful. And the CGI is fantastic - this is a first-rate film.
The caveats: be sure to have part II ""The Forbidden Shadow"" on hand to finish off the story. Unfortunately, this film has not been released in a PAL Region 1 DVD format so you need to have a machine which plays Region 2 (UK and European) DVDs. Finally, it has not been dubbed into English, but there are very good subtitles. None of these gets in the way of making this a spectacular treat for the suspense-horror or H.P. Lovecraft buff.",1396656000,33,2727,4.73109243697479
4254985,3,B0043CENEU,"I bought this film, based on the Cthulhu mythos, because I had heard it was well made. From overall film production it certainly was. The acting is quite good with well known actors in Spain, there were no shortcuts here. It' simply a well made film. Where it falls short is just that the story is broken into a beginning , a middle and an end. The middle is a flash back to the late 1800s dealing with the Valdemar family. The beginning starts strong, the end finishes strong, though it simply sets up the next movie(sequel). The middle, which accounts for most of the run time of the film is just downright boring. An hour of absolute boredom.
To me, the movie was not worth the high price asked by the importer. If this were another 10-12 dollar video, or on streaming for $2, ok. But not $30. Wait until it comes out in region 1 format and you can get both this one and its sequel for $20. Don't pay 30 each for them now in Region 2 format. That's what I did. Even if you area Cthulhu fan. The cheaper B Cthulhu productions available offer a more interesting story line.
I purchased the sequel (Forbidden Shadow) as well, but haven't watched it yet, so won't comment on that one here",1389398400,4,1187,4.327354260089686

4254989,2,B0043CENEU,"Clearly low budget but interesting approach to a haunted house thriller nonetheless, subtitles were a bit distracting as always but at least there was more to the story than throwing blood at the camera.

This is OK, and I will definitely watch for #2 or however it's promoted. I was especially awed by the actor's believable performances!

Why make a movie just to end it in such a ridiculous cliffhanger?
By the anticlimactic final act, I was as confused as if I had started to watch the movie in the middle of it.
Still trying to figure out the purpose of this movie because the story led nowhere. Just because you have a sequel (which Amazon does not have for streaming) doesn't mean you can get away with not wrapping things up in a logical manner. I don't even understand why this movie starts in our time if three quarters of it were a ginormous flashback with about five minutes back in the present just to prevent you from forgetting where the movie began.
Yes, the story is somewhat interesting, but I feel absolutely cheated with the (not) conclusion.

It is one episode of a series or Part One of a series or set, the rest of which Amazon is apparently never going to make available, free or otherwise, so it is incomplete and defective. I resent this misrepresentation and waste of my time.
Since this film would have gotten very good or excellent reviews and reccomendations if it were actually being offered in entirety, Amazon is just
shooting itself in the foot shrifting viewers in this way. One could believe this is an oversight or simple mistake, but this is not the first time this has happened. It has been reported in a number of reviews (which I, unfortunately, did not see) and, I would suspect, in feedback and other avenues of customer complaint, both in this and previous cases, Nothing has ever been done about it, so it seems intentional. These items should either be completed with the missing episodes, or if that is not possible, withdrawn from Prime listing altogether, out of simple consideration for their customers, as well as for the people who made the film to begin with.

First this is a Spanish language film with subtitles. I don't mind this at all, so this isn't a problem for me. The problem though is that nowhere does Amazon mention this so anyone expecting this to be an English language film because all of the text on the film and describing it is in English will be surprised. That's not a big issue either really, the issue I have is this is part one of a two part suspense film and the second part is not just unavailable for Prime streaming -- It's just UNAVAILABLE.

So unless you want to spend a lot, wait some time, and hope the end is worth it there's not much point. This is one of those cases where Amazon is taking potentially happy paying customers and leaving them to look around the internet for somewhere to watch the rest of this if they already started it OR just give up.

4255031,3,B0043CENEU,"Not exactly camp and not hardcore horror. There is blood, cannibalism, madness, and nudity.

While I have read many of H.P. Lovecraft's writings I have not encountered this one before. I think this horror story very out of place for his normal style, so much so that it is more likely a tribute salted with his concepts. Love often plays little role in his writings and those tales almost all end in madness or death.

This a tale of tragic love harried by weak men of the world. An evil man helps the main couple greatly, but to no good end. The people that are counted on for truth and stability treat the couple terribly but with no great evil intent beyond greed. It really just seems like a retelling of a simply paraphrased saying that sometimes those that do you wrong are not your enemy and those that help you out of trouble are not your friend.

There is an element of the supernatural in the film which cannot be denied. These make up a relatively low portion of the film. Little attempt is made to delve deeply into the unexplainable horrors. There is also no good effort made at closure.

The ending was possibly meant to be a cliffhanger or lead to another film? At any rate the director falls short of a Lovecraftian ending when central characters we've met don't end up damaged from their experience with what lies beyond. The ultimate end of the appraiser is hinted at but not seen. The investigator never arrives.

Good effort and good special effects for a low budget film.

*After just a little digging it looks like this was commissioned by Lovecraft fans and premiered at a convention, and it does have a follow up film, That does little to nothing to change my review as Lovecraft hated the budding Hollywood formula and in his own words during interviews made plain that he did not wish his tales to be easily converted to film.

Offering a story within a story, with a fascinating and rather elegant 19th century thriller, wrapped in a 20th century haunted house story - and both are very Lovecraftian in tone and atmosphere.  (Footnote:  I said the film is imaginative, right?  The 'current era' story isn't exactly in our 20th century - it's a revised history, steam-punk version, complete with Zeppelins and Pullman cars ... pretty cool).  I loved the flick!  Only criticism: this is Part 1 of a two-movie series, and Part 2 is not really available anywhere for the US market.  Hopefully will be remedied soon - so chill until then.

The movie starts off in fairly typical horror movie fashion...solo woman sent to value a mysterious abandoned house with a long dreadful history. You can probably fill in much of this sequence yourself if you watched enough horror, but she ends up missing. The story, and really the beauty of this movie, comes via the recounting of the house owners' tragic history. There isn't much action once story time begins, but the story is quite immersive and detailed. I giggled (and rolled my eyes) a bit at the special ""guests"" at a key point in the movie -- making reference to prominent historical figures with dark stories. Also, I was racking my brain to figure out the actor who played Jervas, the servant, as he looked so familiar. It wasn't until the credits that I realized it was Paul Naschy! Wow...if you watched any 1970's Euro-horror, you likely will have seen him.

There is a Part 2 out there (I can find reviews but not the movie, anywhere!), and if Amazon would make that available, we'd have the whole story.  It's important here to point out that Part 2 is not a sequel - it is literally the second half of the movie.  Not a single conflict is resolved in Part 1.  In fact, two characters who seemed like they were going to be pivotal had yet to even embark to the Valdemar House before the movie ended.

Amazon - if you are going to offer part one on prime, why not part two? smh. The film was great so I'm only deducting one point for leaving me hanging.
