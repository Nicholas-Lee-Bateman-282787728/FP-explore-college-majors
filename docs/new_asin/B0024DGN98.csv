8648641,5,B0024DGN98,This is a great Blu-Ray and series for you to get into but I would suggest waiting until it come out to the US because it is a little price compared to the US version for around 20 dollars. If you can understand Japanese and have the money then by all means get it. I just think that you would want to wait until the US one comes out and the price drops.,1315267200,,354,3.863013698630137
