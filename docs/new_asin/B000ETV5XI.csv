8235259,2,B000ETV5XI,"The online description of the DVD states that it is in the NTSC format, but the back cover indicates that it is in the PAL format. While that is misleading, a PAL disc should still play on a PC. It does not and won't progress beyond the copyright warning screen. I have tried it on multiple PCs using different DVD playing software and still no luck. I have other PAL format DVDs that play just fine, so the issue is with this particular DVD. Fortunately, I have an Oppo dedicated DVD player which, interestingly, does play it.",1434585600,,527,4.443298969072165
