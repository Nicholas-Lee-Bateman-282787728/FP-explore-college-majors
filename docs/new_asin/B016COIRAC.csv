8736272,2,B016COIRAC,"In between WHATS THE MATTER WITH HELEN and WHOEVER SLEW AUNTIE ROO, Shelley Winters filmed this bland TV-movie about a middle-aged Idaho couple (John Randolph plays the husband) who fly to New York when their 20-something, eldest, stewardess daughter (Tisha Sterling--Ann Sothern's real-life daughter) and her handsome but shiftless, married boyfriend are arrested for the murder of a wealthy woman.

The cast is strong and also includes Arthur Kennedy and Harold Gould as the attorneys but this is a dull affair that plays like an average episode of something like THE NEW PERRY MASON or any other 1970s legal drama. The story is too straight-forward with no excitement or surprises and Winters is saddled with the kind of dowdy housewife role she could play in her sleep at this point in her career.

A bloated and slovenly Ann Sothern steals the movie in a single scene but otherwise, this should be selling for $9.99 or less and not the $25 I paid for it.",1505606400,,959,4.841463414634147
8736273,5,B016COIRAC,"A DEATH OF INNOCENCE is another one of those rare CBS-TV Movies Of The Week with stellar performances and an intriguing storyline not made any longer by today's standards.

I just hope that CBS DVD and Amazon keep putting out these rare gems.

Now we need, COFFEE, TEA OR ME (1973), THE FACE OF FEAR (1971) and DEADLY HARVEST (1972), all by CBS-TV, just to name a few.  RATING: FIVE STARS!",1456358400,5,389,4.450704225352113
