The scenary is grandiose, but I want to listen to ""live"" opera. Why were they wearing microphones? Would you believe they were really singing? C'mon? The editing is a disaster. There are no subtitles (as said previously). Nevertheless I must admit that the director has balls to allow this DVD to be released.",1141603200,,325,4.803571428571429
8018695,2,B0001Z4PEQ,"I did not pay heed to the previous review that was posted.  The previous reviewer was too kind.  Where do I begin with reviewing this performance?

First of all, when I received it I knew I was in trouble when I saw that the timing was 100 minutes.  I have at least 6 other versions of this singspiel and all of them run about 150 minutes (or more).  Where did the other 50 minutes go?

First of all, the overture was not truncated, but COMPLETELY OMITTED!!!  As reported previously, there are no subtitles.  I can live with this, since I have learned the story line quite well even though I do not speak German.  Time is made up, not by speeding up the pace, but by omitting much of the dialogue AND (most annoyingly) cutting short many of the arias, particularly the opening arias of Tamino and the Queen!!!!  There are no pauses whatsoever between scenes or arias.  WHAT IS THE HURRY???

I need to put in at least one good word.  The performance is not bad, not the best, but not bad.  THE EDITOR IS THE VILLAIN.  I am sure the audience did not see what is on this video.  It is a shame.  I will think twice before purchasing another video from Nutech.

My first recommendation for a purchase of ""Die Zauberflote"" is the BBC/Opus Arte production of the performance by the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden with Colin Davis conducting and Dorothea Roschmann as Pamina and Diana Damrau (the best Queen of the Night I have seen yet).  Only Papagena disappoints in this performance.",1134432000,2,1480,4.47565543071161
8018696,3,B0001Z4PEQ,"This performance was recorded in the remains of a Roman quarry so we have an out of doors setting which allows for spectacular sets. The appearance of the Queen of the Night, in all her starry glory, is breathtaking. Tamino is pursued by a gigantic two-headed dragon, maybe 40 feet high, belching real fire! The Three Ladies ride in on horses, Papageno appears in a tree house, and so forth. It really is the grandest production I have ever seen. The conductor knows what he's doing and the singers are uniformly fine. As a performance and production it is superb. SO why the warning? Well, there are no subtitles. OK, I can get a libretto. Over the overture a voice in German tells gives us a quick synopsis of the opera. Hm...well, OK.BUT..the overture comes to its midpoint and the next thing we see/hear is Tamino's first entrance WITHOUT the introduction to it! Then the section with the Three Ladies has whole sections cut from it. And so it goes through the entire performance. Every things has cuts so we lurch from section to section within arias and ensembles. Most of the time the cuts are orchestral passsages. So one gets a sense of the Reader's Digest mentality - let's cut the unimportant stuff!!!

If you know MAGIC FLUTE well and think you can sit through the abominations of this issue, I would say get it. If you are coming new to the work, get the Levine from the Met or the Haitink from Glyndebourne. Alas, this issue subverts what was  a very special performance",1114732800,4,1484,4.59622641509434
