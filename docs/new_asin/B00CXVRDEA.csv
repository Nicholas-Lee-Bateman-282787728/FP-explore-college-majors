5751675,5,B00CXVRDEA,I can't wait for this to come out. I have always loved Digimon all the seasons. I love all the characters in this show. Even though this was different from the other seasons I still enjoyed it.,1369699200,,193,4.243243243243243
5751676,5,B00CXVRDEA,"My message board has paid off; the entire 4th season of Digimon is finally coming to DVD, just 2 weeks after mine & my niece's birthday, and just 1 day before Patriot Day. Like I said with season 3, season 4 also got in some hot water for ""censored nudity"" for Spirit Evolving. All 50 American-print episodes of this landmark season are here in an 8-disc set! It's a shame Fox Kids never let us know about a 4th season in 2002 nor about where it'd be seen, causing its ratings to suffer (The Internet wasn't so plentiful or quick in those days). It was originally seen on UPN (before it became the CW with other Disneytoon shows of the time) from September of 2002 to the end of August 2003, then on ABC Family & Toon Disney until the latter channel only showed Data Squad in 2007 to 2009. A lot of people compared Data Squad to Power Rangers S.P.D. as with Digimon's 4th season to the Power Rangers in general. You won't find Zords of any kind here, nor will you find the TV movie ""Island of Lost Digimon"". This season consists of 5 new Digidestened to start out, plus their buddies, a lesser-known toon comedy duo; Bokomon & Neemon (the little wise guy & the original ""dumb bunny""). Eventually, they succeed in bringing an end to Cherubimon & his Legendary Warrior spirits turned evil, & setting Koji's twin brother Koichi free from Cherubimon's clutches, and reforming his own spirits of Darkness. There's a lot of good times to be had with season 4, as with all the others so far. Veteran Digi-fans like me are imperitive for this set. As Bokomon would put it, ""It's a 30-cent word for... fans like me have to add it to our collections, especially if you've seen it before... I can't wait to see that happen in person!"" You never know what familar or new faces & voices you'll see and/or hear next with this set! But beware, when Cherubimon is finally beaten, Lucemon & his ""Rotten Royals"" (Dynasmon & Crusadermon) take his place & finish his misguided job. Rika from season 3 narrated the majority of this season, but during the last 8 episodes, her actress had another gig to do, so Bokomon (or at least his actor) stood in for her for the last 8 shows! You get it all here, Takuya's leadership skills, Koji's anti-social attitude which mellowed out upon meeting Koichi, Tommy's pleasant-but-crybaby-type attitude, J.P. being the magician Howie Doodad/chocolate supplier/hopeless romantic, Zoe being the original Miss Independent (with Italian flair), & Koichi being turned good & knowing the team & his own brother for the better, and especially Bokomon & Neemon backing them all up on their adventures! Not to mention 9 different species of Trailmon (including Ball from the TV movie) taking them wherever they needed to go through the whole thing. Now if only we can find out when a whole Data Squad set would be out, or when the new Fusion saga will debut on Nick! As Neemon once said, ""our-river-dirt-chee!"" Bring it on, New Video Group (or Cinedigm) AND Nick, bring it on!",1369699200,17,2984,4.621468926553672
5751677,5,B00CXVRDEA,"I loved this season of Digimon with its way of having the kids transform into digimon, now that was a nice spin on the series. I can't wait for season four to be released and add it to my anime collection.",1369267200,10,205,4.024390243902439

5751683,5,B00CXVRDEA,Awesome,1441584000,,7,7.0
5751684,4,B00CXVRDEA,"Unique concept that is a first in the Digimon series, and is actually handled very well. If you can get past the initial strangeness of the new digital world and the blatant disregard for Digimon in the first three series and the events than Frontier is enjoyable. Solid storyline that manages to hit some very real topics along the way, such as loneliness, divorce, death, and bullying. Box set is the same setup as the first three season releases.",1440374400,2,449,4.69620253164557

5751696,5,B00CXVRDEA,"another great season of digimon, probably the most fantasy based of the seasons, it no the less holds the same feel of wonder and excitement that comes from any digimon series",1412121600,,175,4.67741935483871

5751700,5,B00CXVRDEA,Very good.,1407801600,,10,4.5
5751701,5,B00CXVRDEA,With this set I only need one more season to complete my collection of digimon. I was a fan as child and I still am. I hope digimon fusion comes out on blu ray,1403827200,,159,3.7058823529411766
5751702,5,B00CXVRDEA,This series is really good. The story is great and compelling. I'd recommend this to everyone who likes manga and anime.,1400889600,,120,4.761904761904762
5751703,4,B00CXVRDEA,Super happy with purchase. Has all the episodes that I have not seen. They work really well. Highly recommend it.,1400112000,,113,4.7
5751704,5,B00CXVRDEA,"I was born in the early 90s so growing up, I watched Digimon every morning before heading off to school, but I have to say
this Digimon season is the best! the fusion is just wicked!",1397952000,,182,4.083333333333333
5751705,5,B00CXVRDEA,I love it and can't stop watching it. It's excellent. My cousin can't stop begging me to watch it with her.,1395446400,,107,4.142857142857143
5751706,5,B00CXVRDEA,"If You haven't seen it...see it!

this is a solid and most definitley underrated season, if i had one key complaint its that the final arc with the royal knights\lucemon kinda drags a little bit but makes up for it with a strong finish",1393459200,,235,4.340909090909091
5751707,5,B00CXVRDEA,"If you like Digimon and Super Sentai (Power Rangers) this is a MUST season for you!  Instead of going about the prior routes in the Digimon franchise, Digimon Frontier has the Chosen Children (DigiDestined) BECOME their Digimon partner via Spirit Evolution.  Now this season is also one of the most controversial, but don't let that deter you from watching this!

Instead of being chosen and having this brought upon them against their choice as in Adventure to Tamers, the Chosen Children (Takuya, Koji, Tomoki/Tommy, Izumi/Zoe, and Junpei/J.P.) in reality chose themselves to go along this journey into the Digital World.  And like in previous seasons it shows the transition from being a kid to an adult, coupled with a major plot twist just a little after half-way in.  And this plot twist is reminiscent of Digimon Adventure 02, so I'd include Adventure 02 in this bunch as well of those who might like it!

I really didn't care about the Royal Knights arc as some people did, but the first half of the season up to the plot twist REALLY made this season wonderful.  This season also wasn't advertised that well because it was in the transition from Fox Kids to Jetix on Disney, so not many people could have had a chance to watch it.  It'll be hit or miss for most people, but in MY opinion it's one of the best, Tamers (Season 3) not being that far behind in my ratings.",1389916800,5,1377,4.614754098360656
5751708,5,B00CXVRDEA,"This is by far my favorite season. It seems so much easier to get attached to the characters. I wish they would have gone on with some of the characters into the next season like they did for 1 and 2. Also, the condition was perfect.",1384819200,,233,4.086956521739131
5751709,5,B00CXVRDEA,I'm so glad you guys sold this. Thank you. It was everything I wanted. I don't regret getting it. I loved it.,1381708800,,109,4.0
5751710,5,B00CXVRDEA,this is the last series of digimon minus the movies but a great tv series it brings back memories as a kid,1378944000,,106,3.8636363636363638
5751711,5,B00CXVRDEA,"This is mainly for the so called digimon fans that hated or dis-liked frontier. but for some reason they loved tamers but if you remember Takato becomes a digimon in digimon tamers he and Guilmon become Gallantmon.  Frontier was my favorite season. It was a breath of fresh air to me, trains and cell phones calling the digi-destine. and the whole becoming a digimon. it was great season. I enjoy every season of digimon. I'm a huge fan so next time you hear someone or yourself say ""I hated frontier because they changed into digimon, thats stupid"" refer them back to The tamers season to when it first happened. Re-Watch this season you'll fall in love with it. You were probably way to young to remember it and you couldn't relate to the characters because they seemed to come off more mature then past digimon season characters.",1378857600,2,832,4.659863945578231
5751712,5,B00CXVRDEA,I absolutely LOVED this season! It was probably my favorite (next to Season 1). I love the story line and how the digi-destined actually become digimon. Watching the first three seasons I always felt like the the digimon were doing all the hard work and their partners were just there to encourage them but now they (the digi-destined) get to save the world! I highly recommend getting it!,1377388800,,389,4.735294117647059
5751713,5,B00CXVRDEA,"I loved Frontier! The twists, the turns, the references to Christianity were epic in my opinion, and best of all the Spirit-Evolutions!!!! This season combined comedy, drama, and action into such a captivating and beautiful storyline that I can't wait to own this and watch it again and again and again!!!",1374537600,,305,5.0
5751714,5,B00CXVRDEA,"Digimon frontier may lighten up a bit from its preceded season ""Tamers"", because of its rapid darker tone through out its series, but I have to say that this is one of the seasons that I really prefer most because it does contain some natural emotional problems more than all the other seasons that I've seen. Divorces, friendships, fears, how to be a good younger/older brother, travels, hardships, jealousy, loneliness, how life is boring and all that good stuff. There was stuff that I could relate and live through out because of these Digidestined. I love this series so much that I am glad that it's going to come out. Now I can watch this season while watching the Dubbed version of Xros Wars/Fusion this fall! :D",1372896000,4,720,4.677165354330708
5751715,5,B00CXVRDEA,"I was afraid this day would never come!

This was by far my favorite season of the series. I wish they would do a continuation of season 4 like they did with seasons 1 and 2.

I will definitely be purchasing this after it gets released. And it's even better that it's official.

Thanks Amazon!",1370822400,,293,4.290909090909091
5751716,5,B00CXVRDEA,"With the first two seasons released in the US as official box sets and the third and fourth confirmed down the pipe line, come september when ""Frontier"", the fourth season, is released, all 5 seasons will be available on DVD. Amazing, considering the first series ended over 12 years before it saw an official release to DVD, i was worried we'd never be able to place this classic on our shelf. Not only are we treated to the first two seasons, but the third and fourth. Amazing. Can't, wait.",1370131200,,492,4.53932584269663
5751717,5,B00CXVRDEA,"This was my all-time favorite Digimon season ever!! The Spirit evolutions are the greatest, the comedy duo Digimon were hilarious, and after 3 amazing seasons of Digi-Destined-paired-with-Digimon, it's nice that the Digi-Destined can now protect themselves by BECOMING Digimon! This season fulfilled a great desire of mine as a child--to become powerful, like in Power Rangers! Taking that step from trainer-with-partner to becoming the actual heroes greatly separates this from similar fare of Pokemon, Medabots, and Zatch Bell (all classics btw). Can't wait! Hopefully I'll have enough money by then!",1369699200,21,602,5.7

8587383,2,B00CXVRDEA,"I was severely disappointed by the seller TheRoans. I ordered the set and the discs all came scratched and half of the episodes would not play, so I returned it and ordered a second one hoping for better results. The second set was almost as bad, I will not be buying a third time. It was a waste of money and a disappointment.",1483142400,,327,4.2063492063492065
8587384,5,B00CXVRDEA,"This was my all time favorite Digimon season so when i found it of course I had to order it. Saldy i lost disc five. Does anyone know where i can get another one? On a lighter note, I also got my niece on this and she LOVES it so i bought one for herself as a Christmas present.",1482537600,,278,3.7288135593220337
8587385,5,B00CXVRDEA,"Amazing, for me, it's the best of the digimon series",1482192000,,52,4.3
8587386,5,B00CXVRDEA,Excellent.,1475712000,,10,10.0
8587387,3,B00CXVRDEA,"I first learned of the existence of this season of Digimon when I was watching cartoons on ABC Family one day as part of the Brand Spankin' Boo series and I noticed that human characters in the Digimon episodes featured in that series were different from those I saw in Digimon Tamers. I later realized that Toei Animation had released a fourth Digimon season around the time I was moving with my family to Newport Coast, California, and what makes this season stand out from Digimon Adventure 01/02 and Digimon Tamers is that the Digimon Frontier human protagonists don't have partner Digimon but instead transform themselves into Digimon using spirits bequeathed by ancient warriors.

Interesting takeaways from Digimon Frontier:
- Several armor-level forms of the partner Digimon of the Digimon Adventure 02 Digidestined appear in this season, including Toucanmon, Chamelemon, Baromon, Sepikmon, Ponchomon, Oryxmon (he is voiced by a male actor rather than a woman, which is ironic because he is Gatomon's armor-level form thru the Digi-Egg of Hope, and Gatomon's armor-level forms speak like women given that a female does the voice of Gatomon), Sagittarimon, Swanmon, Honeybeemon, and Pteramon
- Nefertimon makes her first appearance since Digimon Adventure 02
- IceDevimon makes second appearance in Digimon.
- Datamon steals D-Tectors, but he treats Tommy with tender care, instead of kidnapping him like he did to Sora in Digimon Adventure.
- Zephyrmon and JaegerLowemon are the only Beast-type Hybrid-level Digimon who are not named for Season 1 Digimon.

I liked how the animators did the continuity part where EmperorGreymon and MagnaGarurumon unwaveringly fight Cherubimon and refuse to let themselves down, but they should have made the Episode 27 ending a bit more conclusive to the point where Beowulfmon backs off fighting Duskmon when he notices a human being inside Duskmon, that way Agnimon arrives in the Darkness Sphere to rescue Koji so that Agnimon and Beowulfmon can fight together to take down Duskmon because Koji doesn't realize until Episode 32 that Duskmon/Velgmon is his twin brother. Toei Animation should also have made the continuity sequence in Episode 38 feature EmperorGreymon and MagnaGarurumon getting out of harm's way when the Royal Knights zoom towards them after refusing to succumb to EmperorGreymon's infernos, and EmperorGreymon crushing Dynasmon with his Ice Bear Fang and Fist of the Sun Attacks, and MagnaGarurumon crushing Crusadermon with his Astral Wolf and Celestial Missile attacks.",1472688000,,2535,5.366834170854271
