8728868,1,B013U8ESCY,Program content is outstanding.  The shows are very entertaining.  The disc is the problem.  The rendition is not good like it should be.  These programs were on Black And White film that should be a good source.  The disc is a DVD-R.  There is no excuse for issuing programs on this format.,1522368000,,291,4.5
