The Nagus  proceeds to rewrite the Rules of Acquisition to promote a kinder, gentler  way of acquiring profit; or in this case, how to give it away!
When the  Nagus decides to bestow his new found knowledge to the ever-greedy Quark,  he nearly hits the floor in shock (literally!)when he reads the first new  rule of acquisition, he knows something is wrong: If they want their money  back, give it to them.
Well, Quark does some investigating and finds that  the Nagus went to the Gamma Quadrant and when he came back, the Prophets  transformed him from the almighty greed to giving to those in  need.
Seeing the end of the world is imminent, Quark decides to take a  chance that will either bring back his Nagus, or turn Ferengi commerce into  a cesspool of softies.",965865600,5,902,4.487654320987654
