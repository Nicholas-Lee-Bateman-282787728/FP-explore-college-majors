8360739,1,B002B6BP14,"While this movie is funny, kid/family friendly and overall very entertaining, this dvd purchase was an awful, waste of money. The film quality was grainy and stop-motion-esque. It seemed as though everything was delayed half a second. And subtitles were clearly written by someone who does not speak Korean or English. It was translated word for word instead of in context and did NOT make sense at all. This may not affect someone who is fluent and does not need to read (however poorly written) subtitles. But still, the bootleg picture quality still prevented me from enjoying this wonderful movie. DO NOT PURCHASE HERE.",1246060800,3,623,5.0
8360740,5,B002B6BP14,"This movie is really cute. The story goes (I can""t quite remember their names) that a really well known radio dj is talking to a girl who has never met her father and she asks the dj if she should meet her father and he encourages her, not knowing that he is her father. She comes to his doorstep with her son, and begins to live there. Its a cute movie, and I would definitely recommend it.",1245542400,,391,4.090909090909091
