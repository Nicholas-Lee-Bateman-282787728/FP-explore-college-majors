Her instructions are all correct; I have now made two sweaters and working on the third. After learning via video, it also includes written instructions.

I also like that you can email her and ask questions and actually get a response!

Very well done DVD.  Am looking forward to purchasing Nenah's ""two at a time socks"" DVD.",1365638400,2,450,4.5875
