8703099,4,B00TU8AX8C,"Jenni is described as a `super nerd' and a bit of a doormat. She has got hold of the wrong end of the stick in the life's fortune game and has had a life that few would envy. So in desperation she attempts to end her life. Enter Sam who is feisty, street wise and has a heart. She decides to help her newly acquired friend and so they head off to find Jenni's long lost father - along the way a bond grows between them.

Now this is a sweet movie and some of the scenes are borderline brilliant, but it can be a bit slow in places too and to be honest it ain't that funny. However it is one that will stay with you for the right reasons. The acting is all more than solid and it is also quite touching in places.

It is an independent effort and has had mixed reviews but most being positive - especially amongst younger women on IMDB. I am a man and I actually thought this had a really positive message and I quite enjoyed it - hence my rating which is me being generous but I like to encourage indie film makers.",1439078400,,1015,3.9950738916256157
