This video, fifth release in the On The Farm series, demonstrates the care taken  by the Fesko family to tread softly on the earth while producing a  bountiful crop.
Chris Fesko explores the critical role of water and the  earth in the life cycle.  Beginning with ""...everything starts with  water and the earth,"" she takes us from an eye and ear-popping  thunderstorm, to the fields, creeks, ponds, lakes and ocean.  Young Todd  Fesko narrates an honest, gentle wildlife management segment. Chris Fesko  has directed and produced another winning video!",957139200,4,696,5.302752293577981

8588059,5,B00004SAVX,"Chris Fesko has another winner! In my opinion, Every Day is Earth Day on the Farm is an excellent video and has a broad range in uses: from high school science or ag classes to gift-giving for young elementary aged  grandchildren. I purchased one for my own children and one to place in the  elementary school district library. The teachers are all raving to me about  the fantastic wildlife footage captured in this video and the clear  visualization it brings in understanding how water and soil play key roles  in our survival. Chris Fesko shows viewers in up-close and personal style  the intricate balance between today's farming techniques and the world  around us. Because she uses more visual explanations than narrative, it  allows the viewer to grasp what is age appropriate for them. Older  individuals will get a clearer knowledge of problems associated with  erosion and ways to prevent it. Younger viewers will marvel at all the  animals... deer, raccoons, turkeys, rabbits, to name just a few that are  brought right up close for their little eyes to see. We thoroughly enjoyed  it and have recommended it over and over to others.",955929600,3,1145,4.901041666666667
