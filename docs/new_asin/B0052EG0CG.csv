While opening the shrink wrap I was thinking this is going to be dynamite. These kids are
going to show people they can do anything if they put their mind to it. This will be as good as
a professional theater company's effort.

After five minutes I had another think a comin'. This rendition of the Verona hard luck kids
was not even rehearsed. It is bad. Am I disappointed and for these kids with Down's Syndrome.

The play or whatever you would call it had more average people types than young people with
Down's Syndrome.

The disc is functional. It is for my Shakespeare multi-media collection that is second to none.",1354752000,,706,4.715447154471545
