8184718,5,B000OCZ2XY,"Kagome is a normal high school girl, until she falls down a well at her home on her 15th birthday. She climbs out and finds herself in a 16th century Japan where demons run rampant. She is pursued by a centipede demon and finds herself clinging to a boy stuck to a tree. He wakes up and tells her if she removes him from the tree, he will kill the monster. He makes good on the promise. While the fight goes on a jewel comes out of Kagome's side. It has the power to make any demon or human immeasurably powerful. That makes it a hot commodity. While retrieving the jewel, Kagome breaks it, and the shards are scattered throughout the country. Inuyasha and Kagome must work together to find them all and keep them out of the hands of evil doers.

Inuyasha's group saves a young girl from a demon. In the past, Miroku promised to marry her. Now she is wanting to collect on his promise. Sango is angry because he promised to marry her after the battle with Naraku. This could throw a major wrench into the works. There are also 2 more very good stories in this volume. Rin and her devotion to Sesshomaru are visited in the 2nd episode. She wants tobe with him and Jaken forever, but Jaken tells her that she will one day grow old and die, leaving them behind. Sango, Kirara and Kohaku are the focus of the 3rd episode. They all nearly cross paths in a garden of flowers that is very familiar. This is a vey sentimental episode, and a great end to the DVD.

This anime is a legend. If there is someone out there who hasn't seen it, they need to remedy that situation as soon as possible. This series has everything. Drama, action, comedy, suspense, and romance. It is a fairy tale that you will never forget. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are also unforgettable. This anime is one of the best ever, and a must see for anime fans of all ages.",1353456000,,1853,4.32183908045977
