1082473,5,6305832404,This is a great family movie. I love it when I can find movies we can watch with our grandkids.,1267056000,,95,3.8
1082474,5,6305832404,"""Balloon Farm"", based on the Jerdine Nolen children's book of the same title, takes you and your family on a ride to a drought-ravaged town.  A strange visitor (Harvey Potter) tries to boost the morales of the repressed townspeople by turning a simple seed of corn into a crop of colorful balloons.  With an all-star cast including Rip Torn, Mara Wilson, and Laurie Metcalf, this movie is a sure winner with kids and their families alike!",1186099200,3,438,4.75
1082475,2,6305832404,"This movie is watchable.
Yet, despite the Disney DVD motto ""Pure Digital Magic,"" this movie is strangely unmagical.  First, to reflect the drought conditions of the plot, the film is all dull warm browns.  This should create a stunning contrast with the colorful balloons, but it just didn't work for me.  Then, the characters are written colorfully enough, but so blandly acted (except the over-the-top sheriff, the goofy bad guy neighbor, and the serenely competent Rip Torn as the balloon farmer) that they fail to bring the story to life.  Even the expected Magical Moment, (when the girl discovers balloons growing in the farmer's field) is sadly pedestrian -- the music tells us it's magical and amazing, but it looks like a few dozen balloons in a field, with a child trying to look amazed.  Then at the end (STOP reading if you don't want to know!), an aerial view of a truly amazing quantity of balloons is shot with the sunlight at such an angle that it washes out all the color.
It is a Disney show, so the story follows the standard formula:  [Choose one: CHILD, children, young person/animal] with the help of supernatural [FARMER, nanny, animal, object] teaches stuffy, foolish looking [PARENT, authority figure] a valuable life lesson.  That sums it up.",1131062400,3,1268,4.869767441860465
1082476,4,6305832404,"I am 67 years old, so I guess that I am a child at heart. The cast was uniformally wonderful. I am a big fan of Mara Wilson, and all of the cast performed equally well. The movie is a fantasy, with it's basic moral that faith can do miracles. While, unfortunately this is not always true, in this movie it certainly provides a feel good ending. So, please, lose your disbelief and enjoy this movie.",995241600,6,398,4.25
1082543,5,6305832404,Once in a while a movie will come around that touches the precious sense of inner joy and magical imagination. Absolutely delightful for young and adults alike!!,1392336000,,161,5.0
1082544,5,6305832404,"What a delightful movie.  My grandchildren have certainly enjoyed it, though a bit different from the book.  Of course, the movies stretch out and do variations on a book theme.  I saw the end of it on TV and was interested in seeing the whole thing, so I made a good purchase.",1387929600,,277,4.288461538461538
1082545,5,6305832404,"Good show--it definitely is no stupendous marvelous item....but pleasant entertainment--the concept itself is interesting and unique.
The acting is pretty good.",1378339200,,160,6.666666666666667
1082546,2,6305832404,There are several dead spots in the film where the screen goes black and there is no sound. They last for 20 or more seconds.,1356912000,,125,4.04
1082547,5,6305832404,This is a great fun family movie. Don't expect logic in this movie. Just watch and have fun with it!!!1,1355875200,,103,4.2
1082548,5,6305832404,My grand daughter and I really enjoyed this DVD.  It was so nice to share this movie with a child that has never experienced drought or a small town.  This is a delightful movie with a lot to teach little ones and adults.,1346198400,,221,4.116279069767442
1082549,5,6305832404,"My son absolutely loves balloons! He is disabled and never tires of balloons.  When I saw ""Balloon Farm"" on the Disney channel, I turned it on for him to watch. He sat and watched it, amazed. We watched it several times with the same result so I decided to try to find it at Amazon. It came in just a few days and we have watched it many times since then and never get tired of it. I would highly recommend this film to anyone.",1331683200,,427,4.023529411764706
1082550,5,6305832404,"Balloon Farm is a great movie for all ages.  Family, community and trust are the general themes.  Fun mystical moments.  Loved the actors . . . and oh, the balloons!",1285545600,,165,4.433333333333334
1082551,5,6305832404,I was pleased to recieve this movie I have lost a few hundred movies and am trying to replace them so I am happy all went well.,1280620800,,127,3.740740740740741
1082552,5,6305832404,"I have 2 daughters who are 6 years apart.  So I have gotten to enjoy this two different times.  I took it for granted as a sweet story the first time.  I enjoyed it with daughter number 1.  Now seeing it again, I appreciate it even more in a world where sweet, colorful, no bad language, no sexual inuendo is almost non existent!",1268697600,,329,4.174603174603175
7896130,5,6305832404,This is great family movie. I originally taped it off of tv many years ago and my grandchildren couldn't watch it enough. They took it home to borrow and I never saw it again. Was glad to find it on Prime so I could have another grandchild watch it.,1518652800,,249,4.1020408163265305
7896131,5,6305832404,A very cute movie,1483747200,,17,3.5
7896132,5,6305832404,"It's a great movie for young children. It was not the most popular with Disney, but a great addition to wholesome family movies. The imagination was out of the ordinary and kept all my children's attention ages 4-15. It's silly, the balloons grow from cornstalks and sort of talk to their owners. It's educational about real droughts. It taps into the strength that children have when it comes to faith and hope.",1481760000,,412,4.736111111111111
7896133,4,6305832404,For a disney movie it is a bit lacking but as a movie about the book it's pretty good. Wish they had stayed with the main characters like the book but like all movies things are always different than the original.,1463356800,,213,4.219512195121951
7896134,3,6305832404,Kind of a hard to find Rare Disney Film check it out for performances by rip torn an the little girl from Matilda !,1456790400,,115,3.8333333333333335
7896135,5,6305832404,"Every child has that one movie that they can watch until it wears out.  Balloon Farm was that movie in our house.  Originally, we had it on a much worn VHS tape that had been tucked away and I was thrilled when I found it on DVD and was able to tuck it into my daughters Christmas stocking.

There is something about the simplicity and wonder of this movie that always brings a smile to my face.

Based on Harvey Potter's Balloon Farm book, Watertown is struggled with a severe drought but through the innocence of a child, the community comes to realize that Harvey Potter is not foolish and that with a little faith and a whole lot of magic, the community can once again come together.

This will make a wonderful addition to your family movie collection.",1456531200,,757,4.41726618705036
7896136,5,6305832404,Love this book,1454716800,,14,4.0
7896137,4,6305832404,"If you're looking for a clean film, with nice family values, that you can watch with your kids and enjoy too, then I'd recommend this movie.  Understand that the special effects are low-budget, and the plot-line is simple.  The acting is actually pretty good, with the exception of the little girl and her friend, and her parents.  The sheriff's character is over the top, as are the farmer, waitress, storekeeper and most of the locals.

Even though the film isn't outstanding, I as a parent am so challenged to find ""safe""movies to watch with my children, that I really appreciated this one.",1441584000,,593,4.784313725490196
7896138,5,6305832404,"Most Excellent. A humorous and ""feel good"" movie with a good lesson for all of us.",1414368000,,82,4.1875
7896139,5,6305832404,all through this movie you will wonder where it is taking you in the plot.  It has a very fun surprising ending that makes you think.  Movies like this don't get the credit that they should.  I enjoy watching it and highly recommend it anyone who likes a movie that makes you think!!,1393545600,,283,4.30188679245283
