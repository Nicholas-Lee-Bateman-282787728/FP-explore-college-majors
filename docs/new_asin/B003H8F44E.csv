8396883,5,B003H8F44E,"For aviation fans everywhere , it's just a miracle so many of these vintage warbirds survive to be brought to life in stunning cinematography and put together in a collection like this",1443830400,,184,4.78125
8396884,5,B003H8F44E,"Great overview of WWII fighter planes, but I was particularly drawn to this collection because it included one of my all time favorite planes, the P-38 Lightning (an amazingly successful, multi-task airplane that served in the European and Pacific theaters, but an airplane which, for some reason, often gets left out of these collections). I loved both disks.",1375488000,,360,5.224137931034483
8396885,5,B003H8F44E,"Classic W.W. II warplanes shown in flight in all their restored glory.  Slightly annoying commentary by Major Paul Max Moga.  But the flying scenes (with some computer animated air to air combat as well, but not as much as the History Channels ""Dogfights"" series) more than make up for it.  Great to see an actual Mitsubishi Zero going up against a P-38 Lightning, F4U Corsair or Grumman F4F Wildcat.  There's also an MiG-15 vs F-86 Sabre episode for jet fans.  With the rarity of these warbirds (especially flying examples) I can see why they didn't make more episodes (shame, really) although the military channels website promises more(?).  Highly recommended.",1374192000,,663,5.036697247706422
