8088323,4,B000BKXAG0,"This is a well-written story with good performances by all.  Dane Clark is handsome, yet hardcore in this adversarial role.  The film has suspense, drama and a moral lesson.  Unfortunately, the edition I received has skips, pops and crackling throughout.  I am sure I missed some dialogue, however I was able to enjoy the movie.  Fans of Film Noir will definitely like this one.",1381190400,,378,4.84375
8088324,4,B000BKXAG0,"A true oddball -- not surprising considering it was produced by the Hakim brothers (who usually produced French films
such as Belle De Jour and Purple Noon).  The opening scene w/ Franchot Tone is talky, but powerful and realistic.  The final frames are straight out of a French or Italian film of the era.  It's certainly no masterpiece, but this film will stay with you while the plot of  dozens of other obscure b noir films will congeal and fade from memory.  Well worth it (I paid under $7)!!",1372982400,7,497,4.53932584269663
8088325,5,B000BKXAG0,"I love classic movies, this one is really good, I've watched it twice will buy more in the future, for a classic picture quality very good",1366156800,2,138,4.346153846153846
8088326,4,B000BKXAG0,"The story plays out like a theatre play. It is in itself nothing special or particularly original - an unsatisfied housewife has an affair that ends and she has to cope with that. It's classic melodrama stuff with tragic incidents, desperation and tears. Of interest might be the fact that the setting is a freshly built small ranch style home in one of the new, half finished housing developments in San Fernando Valley. All the trappings - and the certain bleakness - of suburban life in the early 1950ies are on display. I think this is rare for melodramas of the era, for that reason the movie is well worth watching. Part of the action takes place while the housholder tries to have a TV antenna installed on the roof on his new home. The performances of the cast are flawless.",1179619200,17,782,4.553191489361702
8088327,3,B000BKXAG0,The actors seem to be competing for an over-acting award.  This is very syrupy stuff.  The image quality is just average. Geneon [Pioneer] ver.,1135728000,6,143,4.916666666666667
