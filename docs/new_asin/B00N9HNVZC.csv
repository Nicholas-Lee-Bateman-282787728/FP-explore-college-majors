6618686,5,B00N9HNVZC,"I just watched the 3rd of the dvds available of season one of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir and once again loved it as I have the other 2 dvds. I am hoping for the 4th disc to come out to complete the first season of this wonderful series. And of course SEASON 2! The quality is incredible and Amazon has done a wonderful job on the transfer!

To all fans who love this show, buy these dvds [1,2,3] and then write to Amazon requesting the 4th and of course the second season! It is worth the purchase and of course it will be an enjoyable experience to watch this timeless classic!!!",1411084800,5,577,4.151785714285714

Faithful fans of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, please note that eight (8) episodes are missing from making it a complete set. There were a total of fifty (50) episodes aired over the two (2) seasons.  Another DVD should be available to include:
1)Dear Delusion  2)The Firehouse Five Plus Ghost  3)The Spirit of the Law  4)Puppy Love  5)Host to the Ghost  6)The Ghost of Christmas Past  7)Ladies Man, and 8)Not So Faust.

8676664,4,B00N9HNVZC,"Love the entire series, but I wonder why episode 15, ""Dear Delusion"" was omitted.  I appreciate the hard work of the service/technician that made the DVD's, but episode 15 does exist as it was recently broadcast (6-29-2017) on the gettv channel. Also, the dvd will only run on my blue ray player and not my computer or regular dvd player.",1470096000,,338,4.633333333333334
