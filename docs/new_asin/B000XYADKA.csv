The title of this 14 set DVD is deceptive to say the least. It is composed of some very old footage, often bad footage, of old movies dating back several decades ago. You have to figure out what title they reflect, or if they fit a title,that is mentioned in the ad. For example, there is one on Haiti. A very old ""few minute"" segment, the kind they showed before a film at the theater during the 50s' and that's it!
I buy quite a bit of documentaries and other videos from Amazon.com and PBS. As someone with a small library of such documentaries, I didn't even want to give this series one star.
The worst is that they don't send a phone number to call. Just an e-mail address that is not worth writing to. It came back as ""undeliverable"". I am very disappointed to say the least!!!",1244332800,3,798,4.291390728476821
