8440829,5,B004TRJR9K,"So now you've seen Volume One of ""Sorakake,"" and you're ready for more...well, this next set does not disappoint. You get to find out some backstory on various characters (why is Nami so agoraphobic??), see what makes Nerval such a bad guy, and meet two other Brain Colonies, Bonaparte (recreating himself as ""Benkei"") and Xanthippe (who -has- to be the galaxy's worst singer), both of whom are Nerval's allies and have bad history with Leopard.  Along with this, there is an Omake Theater-style episode called ""Q-Speed Infinity,"" which, for those unfamiliar with this sort of thing, takes all the main characters of ""Sorakake"" and puts them into a story completely unrelated to the main storyline...in this case, a morality tale about the use of QT (telekinetic) powers in girls' baseball. I wasn't expecting that, but after the shock wore off and I consulted some of my anime-literate friends, I relaxed and just went with it.  However, for those who prefer to watch the main story without interruption, I suggest you skip from ""Invitation To The Darkness"" to ""The Girl In The Box,"" watch from there to the end, and then go back to ""Q-Speed Infinity.""
  Although there is still lots of fun and hijinks, the story is becoming more serious, and there are a few scary parts, so you might want to stay in the room with the kids. Other than that...enjoyable, as expected.",1345593600,3,1368,4.833333333333333
