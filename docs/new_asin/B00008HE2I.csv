1848137,1,B00008HE2I,"I have seen a lot of B movies, but this one takes the cake!  I don't mind cursing in a movie but this was bad. The plot was a cute plot but never went anywhere. I gave 2.00 usd for the movie and wasted the money since i didn't add it to my movie collection. I filed it where it belonged in the trash!",1188691200,,300,3.6875
1848138,5,B00008HE2I,THIS IS THE FUNNIEST MOVIE I SEEN IN A WHILE. I DONT KNOW WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT BE THIS IS A HIP HOP CLASSIC. HEY FOR A LOW BUDGET PIC THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE. WHAT IS MORE CRAZY ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THAT THIS WAS A TRUE STORY. FUNNY CHECK IT OUT!,1187308800,,258,3.709090909090909
1848139,4,B00008HE2I,"It's interesting that with the advent of video cameras getting cheaper that independent films get made en masse. With that within reguard this one isn't bad. The lighting is good and stands out...it should it's sunlight. It was pretty funny and chances are I'm going to see it with the directors commentary...the drug scene I thought was a bit too long but beyond that it was good.

BTW you can see the infamous clip if you go to google and type ""Where's my change *itch""",1154995200,,471,4.541176470588235

1848142,3,B00008HE2I,"This movie was truly a trip, I really don't know what to make of it, even though it looks like a movie that was just put together by some brothers with one camcorder, and no lights, I still in a lot of ways found it interesting. I think all the people in the movie have a lot of potential. Jarell whom I've worked with before on a project, acts a lot like Chris Tucker, but if he can just find some of his own style and mix his Chris Tucker style, that boy will go places. I would have liked to have seen the Asian girl (Kumi) whom I also worked with, I wanted to see her more in the film, she is funny. The one that really got me, was the little boy, that little brother is FUNNY. I was a little
uneasy about his cursing at his age, but I kept over looking it cause that little ni@#$% is funny, If he keeps going he is going to be a star.
Another thing I found very interesting, is the producer/director did a low budget movie like this, with some up coming comedians with a lot of potential, and end up having it distributed by Artisan Entertainment, very clever Joe!

1848143,1,B00008HE2I,"Wow, I've never seen a movie so awful in all my life.  This movie is the result of 8 or 9 friends getting together one day and thinking to themselves, ""Hey!  Lets make a movie!  With our connections we could make SOME money.""
This movie has no plot, and no direction.  It's just a bunch of really crappy actors, with crappy stereotypical urban black dialogue.",1068249600,4,359,4.476923076923077
1848144,4,B00008HE2I,"Being low budget isn't the mark of many a good movie, and having defects in the plots doesn't normally allow one to succeed. In fact, this movie, through that combination, will be considered a failure to a plethora of people watching and shouldn't be checked out by everyone. Many will see this movie, touted as a mixture of How High and the Friday series, notice that it was made in the low finance world outside of the monster money movies, and they will scoff at it. And rightly so if they picked it up for these reasons, because it is none of the above. Unfortunately for people who leave the setting angry, the scoffing misses out on something else the movie has; the essence of what can only be called humor.
Through campy dialog, streams of profanity, a variety of strange twists, and ""gangsta"" cracks, this movie follows the lives of two ""thugs"" trying to make their way through a jobless life. They happen through the day in a fashion that can only be consider disturbingly surreal, with one motion leading to another motion until they end up with a dead crack addict in their trunk and need a way to dispose of the body. So, how does one dispose of a body like that? By getting sidetracked in a way that only those two can.
They find themselves all sorts of political and social issues that are important to us all, confronting sexual issues like the acquisition of undergarb sealife and the ways to make means by ""jacking up"" people, letting things roll on and on until they seem out of control.
And it only goes further.
Before you buy this movie, be warned. It is very low quality, has no actors you'll see again, and it has some sound problems. It also flows out-of-control, much like life does in an unstructured setting, and people who don't appreciate humor for humor and find language, sexuality, and anything else that can be joked about offensive don't want this.
If you still want to approach it after these warnings, however, then go rent it, don't expect anything, and you might find yourself laughing.
And that's the point of all stand-up comedy that people buy, spending just as much as this to watch on DVD, and it has no budget as well. And it offers a whole lot less in the realm of situational laughtracks.",1064966400,3,2235,4.548387096774194
1848145,1,B00008HE2I,This has to be the worst low budget film I have ever seen.  It has no plot.  The acting was horrible.  It has only one funny seen in it.  I don't know what type of life this is suppose to display but I assure you that it is not the life of young black men growing up in the hood where all odds are against them!  It appears that they have no idea what it's like to grow up in the hood.  I myself walked the streets in Georgia and this is not remotely close to what I have seen in my lifeThe sound quality is all messed up.  It sounds distorted.  I'm glad I only rented this garbage or I would be upset.,1063324800,7,602,3.7983870967741935
1848146,1,B00008HE2I,"This movie doesn't even rate one star. It rates a MINUS THOUSAND.  I had medium expectations realizing this was a low budget film, and have respect for all filmmakers.  However, the only interesting thing in the entire movie was the ""kid"".  Other than that, the story line was not believable, the film quality was very bad and the dialogue was redundant.  MF this, MF that, MF the other, just on and on and on and on.  I almost went nuts watching it.  Sorry, but this was the WORST movie I have EVER seen.  Want to see a really good movie, try any movie with Ice Cube and Mike Epps, Friday After Next and All About the Benjamins.  Great fun watching those.  Sorry, Amazon, but not only would I not pay ... to buy this, I would not pay one cent, no offense.",1054598400,2,756,4.267605633802817

7984536,2,B00008HE2I,"This is one of the cheapest movies i've ever seen. No story. The camera angles are absolutely unprofessional. The two main characters are partially funny, but the biggest problem is that i couldn't get a relationship to them. So i got the names of them not before the end of the film.
The only extreme funny parts of the film are the scenes of the little gangster boy! So i award this film with 2 stars!",1370217600,,403,4.315789473684211
7984537,1,B00008HE2I,I watch a  clip of this movie online and i thought this was gonna be thee funniest comedy movie. This was thee worst flick ever the only part was funny was the little boy parts.this was some bulls###. I want my money back..,1368576000,,223,4.186046511627907
7984538,3,B00008HE2I,There is only one scene in this movie that is worth watching and is the exact reason I bought it......the liquor store! The rest of the movie is terrible but again that's not why I got it.,1334793600,,188,4.108108108108108
7984539,4,B00008HE2I,"Livin tha life is a great example of comedy on a tight budget. No big name stars, no plot no sets just down to earth humor. Movie is extremely vulgar but if your searching for this movie you already know that. A must add to any urban movie lovers collection",1288310400,,257,4.16
7984540,3,B00008HE2I,"the seller came through and the movie arrived just as it was describe! GREAT JOB SELLER!!! I happened to see a clip of this movie floating around on youtube and it was pretty funny. so I decided to go ahead and buy it. When I finally recieved it and put it in the dvd player, i was instantly shocked at how it was filmed. The film looks as if it was video taped with a handycam and edited on windows movie maker! and that may be giving it too much credit! The scenes of the movie that i saw on youtube were infact the only funny parts of the movie. the rest was filled with ignorant wit and poor acting! I give this movie 6 thumbs down!",1287964800,,636,4.015748031496063
7984541,1,B00008HE2I,This has to be one of the worse movies of all times. The only thing funny was the little boy and that's sad. I did not expect this movie to look like it was shot with a personal camcorder either....sad sad sad!,1256428800,,210,4.023809523809524
7984542,1,B00008HE2I,"I thought this was stupid funny...  The thought of running around all day sratching with the crabs, was just crazy. Although low budget and poor acting the movie had a plot, dumb as hell but they had one!  Anything is possible in the hood so it wasn't that far fetch...  A classic for me with my favorite scene 'where's my change"" which was unbelievable but again, in the hood anything is possible.  I Liked!",1245628800,,408,4.472972972972973
