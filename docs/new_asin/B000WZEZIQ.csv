8226223,5,B000WZEZIQ,"One of the better character studies of the most winning oscar/academy award winning film directors in WORLD history!  John Ford is SOOO under-rated as one of the ONLY true auteur's in the world.  Labeled western director great but oh he has done soooo much MORE like this video shows and I thought I knew all about my teacher!  HAHAHA!!!!!!!  Was I wrong!  The Peter Fonda tales in this film so rich with the LOVE of genre Henry his was pushed by Ford.  Great stories Peter thank you for sharing I am grateful since I played a young YOU in,""Easy Rider>>>>>>>Cemetery Scene",1358121600,,572,4.6138613861386135
8226224,1,B000WZEZIQ,"John Ford is one of the greatest directors of all time (six oscars). But Mr. Redman made a boring ego doc. It starts with along intro that had nothing to do with Mr. Ford. The talking heads act like they know everything about Mr. Ford, and show their true egos. BUT did Mr. Redman ever interview any of the people WHO WORK with Mr. Ford. How about Harry Carey Jr, Maureen O'Hara...Patrick Wayne.

This is a bad way to honor a great director and War Honor. (Walter Hill as the vocie of Mr Ford....please!!!)",1231718400,7,506,4.382978723404255
8226225,2,B000WZEZIQ,"This documentary on John Ford focuses on his legacy from his years at Twentieth Century Fox. Accordingly, it is by no means a definitive biography of either the man or his work. However, he toiled at Fox for many years so it should be worthwhile to learn about this body of work.  Unfortunately, this DVD, while clearly well made, is deadly boring with endless talk by selected historians, actors, directors etc. The setting of the interviews is a darkened theatre with the projector hovering in the background and endless close ups of the speakers interspersed with shots of them seated with voiceovers, including a voice over for Ford himself - all very gimicky but very disruptive to the flow of the narrative. This is trendy documentary making at its worst.

Do we learn much about Ford? Not really except that he was a temperamental Irish man who went to extreme lengths to be beligerent and avoid any one scratching his brittle surface. As for his film making, in his own words, he states that he had a certain flair for composition. The films are testimony that there was much more but this documentary is not.

The DVD includes some extras. The World War 2 films which Ford made are here, including his famous film of the the battle of Midway. This is invaluable. The rest is marketing material for many of his Fox films and most of it is illegible.

You may pick the DVD up as part of one of the Ford at Fox Sets; otherwise, don't waste your money.",1222560000,10,1457,4.57088122605364
8226226,1,B000WZEZIQ,"This documentary is not worthy of a director the stature of John Ford (Feeney)and the American mythology he created that still has a stranglehold on the national and global imagination.  A good deal of his work indulged in the poetry of racial extermination; first of Native Americans and then the Japanese.  In this, Ford was a master propagandist for the White Protestant establishment who contract story-tellers to legitimize their power and control.  And who better to ask for than the son of Irish Catholic immigrants desperate to ""prove"" himself to the Anglo-Protestant class that has ruled this nation with the iron hand of military conquest encased in the velvet glove of entertainment media.  A critical biography and/or documentary of John Ford has yet to be produced.",1208995200,3,778,5.150793650793651
