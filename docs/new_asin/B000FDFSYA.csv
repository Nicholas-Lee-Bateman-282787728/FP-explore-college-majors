2561434,5,B000FDFSYA,"This movie tells the story of Danish resistance against the Nazis during WW II and centers around a Jewish family who find themselves having to harbor a Danish resistance member who is severely wounded during an attack on the Nazis. D.B. Sweeney plays Niels Jensen, a member of the Danish resistance who is given refuge by Sara Kublitz [Kelly Wolf] and her parents, Emma and Solomon [Tovah Feldshuh and Daniel Benzali]. Initially Sara's father, Solomon is upset and angry that they are forced to harbor Niels as he feels that the Nazis have left the Jews alone for the most part and they should not be antagonised. But he eventually realises that the Jews are in mortal danger and aids Niels and the Resistance in sabotaging one of the factories producing rocket parts for the Nazis. By this time, a romance develops between Niels and Sara and they are determined to stay together despite the odds.

When the Jews are told by an informant that the Nazis are going to arrest all Jews and deport them [almost certainly to the death camps in Europe], the Danish Resistance helps the Jews of Denmark escape the Nazis in one of the most heroic rescue efforts of WW II.

All in all, about 7,200 Danish Jews were safely transported to Sweden, a neutral country. Only about 400 Danish Jews were caught in the Nazi death net. The heroism of the Danish Resistance is something we can all learn from, and it's not just the members of the resistance - ordinary Danish civilians aided their Jewish friends and neighbors because they felt it was the right thing to do - the Jews were considered by the Danes to be Danish citizens just like them, and thus were entitled to the same freedoms and rights they were. I read in a book that the Danes not only helped the Danish Jews escape but also maintained properties belonging to the Jews to be reclaimed by them after the war - such a contrast to what happened elsewhere in Europe.

I'd recommend this movie for all those who are interested in WW II/Holocaust dramas. Another movie I'd recommend that also focuses on the rescue of the Danish Jews is Miracle at Midnight, starring Sam Waterston.",1231200000,15,2128,4.624338624338624
2561435,2,B000FDFSYA,"I admit I was swayed to purchase this DVD by the good reviews it received on Amazon. I like films about WWII; I like DB Sweeny; and the plight of Danish Jews sounded compelling. But the film is a 'dud' and sad to say in particular because DB Sweeny just isn't very good here.

The story of the Danish Jews escaping to Sweden just before they were to be sent to concentration camps by the Nazi's, should hold anyone's interest, but the effort by the filmaker to make an engaging movie just falls flat. Scenes go on too long with no forward movment of the story and I just couldn't find anything that likeable about the characters. So don't be fooled by the reviews; this movie isn't terrible--just 'dull' in its presentation and really not worth your time.",1219968000,33,755,4.471014492753623

2561437,5,B000FDFSYA,"I always hesitate to say too much about these movies as it takes away all the elements of surprise.

I very much enjoyed this movie. It shows how people help people and what we are able to do when we have to.

I hope by remembering where we were we will never go there again.

A must see for Holocaust survival lovers.",1212364800,13,318,4.096774193548387
2561438,5,B000FDFSYA,"One of the most remarkable feats of World War II happened in Denmark.  After about three years of believing they could live in peace with the Germans, the Jews were finally scheduled to be shipped to the death camps.  Fortunately, a trusted Dane working in the German's Command learned of the plan a day or two before it was to happen, so he secretly warned the Jews.  Within a matter of hours, the Danish Resistance help get some 7,200 Jews on boats and taken to Sweden.  Being neutral, Sweden willingly took in these Jewish refugees.  Fewer than four hundred did not escape, but were shipped out of Denmark to the camps.  This is the compelling, true story of one family in that 'miracle at midnight.'  The Disney movie of that name is a similar story, which chronicles another family experience during that same incident.

There is so much to discuss in this movie that parents will just want to watch it with their kids to decide what would be important to their family.  There is very little bad language, or anything objectionable to traditional values families in this movie.  It is one you will not soon forget.  Oh, one more thing:  When the Jews were finally able to return to Denmark after the war, they found their businesses had been kept going, their homes maintained, and even their gardens attended by the Danes!",1171497600,172,1328,4.652360515021459
2561439,5,B000FDFSYA,"This is an excellent movie, and I also think it was one of the best World War 2 movies I have ever seen.  Seeing people being courageous in the face of fear in real life is one of the most powerful things I think any movie could be about.  The relationships formed were very touching as well.  I will recommend this to any and all I see, and as proof of how good I think it is, I have never desired to write a review of any movie before this one.",1091318400,73,446,3.879120879120879

2561460,5,B000FDFSYA,"True story of the early days of the Nazis taking over in Denmark and began killing the Jews. It follows a resistance fighter who is shot and dying. A Jewish girl finds him and hides him, unknowing saving the very man who will, in the end, save her family from slaughter. Her father works for a factory and is in denial about what is happening around him, until he is brought face-to-face with the truth by the resistance fighter. Now he has to  make a decision about whether to continue working for, and thus aiding the Nazis, or standing up against them for the preservation of his people. A very well done and moving true story. I Highly recommend it.",1425600000,,653,4.441666666666666
2561461,5,B000FDFSYA,I have seen a lot of world War 2 movies.  And I seen a few movies about the plight of European Jewish communities during that awful war. This movie ranks among the top 2 movies on this subject as far as I am concerned. This movie can be used to teach racial tolerance to our younger generation. I would recommend this movie and watch it again and again.,1425427200,,353,4.1911764705882355
2561462,5,B000FDFSYA,"Very sad ending and I hope the lovers will see each other again after the war.  I like the suspense in the story.  Very good acting of the movie stars.
I like the story because there are some people who wouldn't back down to the Nazi.  They did their best to survive the war.",1424649600,,275,4.055555555555555

2561484,4,B000FDFSYA,"This is a somewhat typical WWII Holocaust story, albeit with a bit of a twist because it takes place in Denmark. It is the story of a partisan fighter who falls in love with a Jewish girl right around the time that Danish Jewish population needed to flee the country to avoid a looming Nazi crackdown. He is rescued by the girl after being shot in an attack and nursed back to health by her in spite of her father's concerns about the situation. Later, he helps her family and many other Jewish residents of the country flee. This is a fairly low-key film with reasonably good acting. It isn't an effects-laden war movie, but rather a thoughtful rendition of a lesser-known WWII story.",1369526400,,685,4.532258064516129
2561485,4,B000FDFSYA,"I collect Holocaust related movies and I've always liked this one so I added it to my collection. I only wish the DVD I purchased had some special features. That's the only negative for me. DB Sweeney and Tovah Feldshuh are always good. The other less knows actors are very good too. I don't think it was widely released. It only shows up on IMDB as ""En dag i oktober"". There are a couple of small plot holes but nothing most people would notice. Very Good movie!",1354665600,,463,4.333333333333333

2561488,2,B000FDFSYA,"Acting was lame at best.  Sounded like they were reading their scripts.  Very hokey.  Not a good representation of the incredible true events surrounding the organized escape of over 7,000 jews from Denmark, and the way it was carried out by the Danish people.  If you want to see a good movie about these events, see Miracle at Midnight.  Much much better, even though it's a Disney ""made for tv"" movie.",1276041600,11,404,4.633802816901408

Well, take my advice...roll the dice and decide if you want to get a working disc or not...and are prepared for a really poor quality image. It looks 4:3 vhs or a TV screen capture. Dreadful. I got 75% of the way through and the disc stopped playing. I returned it.
