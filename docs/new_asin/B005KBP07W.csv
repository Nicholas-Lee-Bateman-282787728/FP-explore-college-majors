4716784,5,B005KBP07W,This film is timely and relevant. It was beautifully written. It has a stellar cast and is brilliantly acted. All around excellent film.,1318896000,5,136,4.956521739130435
4716785,5,B005KBP07W,"I just saw this movie at the yearly LGBT film festival.  You never know for sure with independent movies whether they will be really good or cheap and amateurish.  Fortunately, this falls in the former category.  See Product Description for synopsis of the movie).  The acting is excellent by the whole cast, the movie is filmed very well, and the story is intense, thought provoking, and disturbing.  Mainly because it is something that could (and probably does) happen throughout the country.  It is a shame how people can immediately jump to conclusions without any facts one way or the other.  And once the accusations are made, the damage is already done.

Do yourself a favor and check out this movie.  It is a good reason to watch and support independent films.",1317513600,7,768,4.801526717557252

4716794,5,B005KBP07W,"An excellent, thought-provoking and moving film, starring Cheyenne Jackson and Julia Ormand. The film tells the story of a couple, Michael and Daniel, who become embroiled in small town drama after a student of one of the men claims to have been sexually abused. Handling themes of prejudice, love and the importance of community ""The Green"" is expertly acted and produced. Highly recommended.",1385942400,2,393,5.253968253968254
4716795,4,B005KBP07W,"I first saw this on Demand but I could not stop thinking about it so I had to purchase the DVD.  The main story is a bit of a bummer.  A gay high school teacher (Jason Butler Harner) tries to reach out to a loner student and then is accused of sexual misconduct against him.  He is arrested, suspended and the whole town turns against him.  As much as I wish I could feel for the victim's of both the teacher and the student...I just can't the kid has an abusive family but is not in the picture much.  And the teacher becomes so hurt that he turns his close friends away from him.  Those friends are what made the film for me.  Cheyenne Jackson shined as his life partner.  He is so caring and supportive until something happens that makes him step back.  Cheyenne (for those Gleek's out there) will remember that he played the coach of Vocal Adrenaline in Glee the first season.  He is also an out actor in Hollywood and one with a lot of talent.  Illianna Douglas plays a friend of the couple and a teacher at the school.  She is very outspoken and has her own demons that she must face when she has a Cancer relapse during this whole question of the main character's integrity erupts.  Julia Ormand also has an amazing part as a lawyer that is assigned to the main character and do to her sympathetic support of the accused teacher, she brings out a side of the main character that starts a turning point in which I finally stopped seeing him as annoying but as a likeable guy.  It is not a upbeat picture but it does bring to light the adage ""don't judge someone until you walk a mile in their shoes""...whether it be an accused victim, a loner student or a recluse next door neighbor.  Sometimes things aren't what they appear.",1369094400,3,1732,4.318885448916409

4716798,3,B005KBP07W,I bought this movie just to see Cheyene Jackson in a role.  He did okay but I would have rather seen him in the lead.

I've seen many hokey films about gay romance that focused more on hot bodies in bed or overly dramatic coming outs, so it was refreshing to see the gay relationships in The Green portrayed with the dignity and no exaggeration.  Well played!",1342656000,,446,4.906666666666666
4716803,3,B005KBP07W,"What's great about this movie is that it provokes serious thought and examination of prejudices and habitual reactions that may not be the truest response to a particular situation.

POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOW.

What bothers me most about this movie is that the teacher's inappropriate behavior toward the student is so much overshadowed by subsequent events - the overreaction of the townspeople and the uncovering of much worse abuse from another adult - that the teacher, in the end, comes out looking like a martyr and a hero. He was not a hero, and if he was a martyr it was only to his own egoism and delusional behavior.

His relationship with the boy was inappropriate from the very beginning - he had an unhealthy obsession, a possessiveness, and a sense of entitlement to interfere in the boy's private life that no teacher ought to have for any student, of any sex. Behavior like that toward a child - particularly a child who was not his own - is always and unequivocally inappropriate and inherently abusive. When the abuser is a teacher, with all the emotional and spiritual power any teacher has over any student, particularly a child, the abuse is especially inexcusable.

This movie masks the teacher's emotionally abusive behavior behind the other adult's physical abuse, so that he comes out smelling like a rose in contrast. The other abuser at least admitted the abuse when confronted; the teacher continued to insist - and probably believe - that he had done nothing wrong. That is outrageous.

END OF SPOILERS

Cheyenne Jackson gives an exceptionally strong, intelligent performance as the teacher's boyfriend; the other actors vary from very good (Julia Ormond as the lawyer) to reliable (Bill Sage as the mom's boyfriend, and most of the other actors) to barely competent (Chris Bert as the kid).",1341014400,,1819,4.947540983606557

The plot of the movie twists and turns in unbelievable, really ridiculous, ways.  The acting is overwrought.  The movie does not live up to the hype, to say the least.  I don't like to write negative reviews, but thought in this case I might provide fair warning to customers out there.",1336348800,3,452,4.730769230769231

4716809,5,B005KBP07W,"The Green's awards are richly deserved! Versatile, wise, touching, The Green reminded me chillingly of growing up in a small Midwest town, watching locals respond in a frenzy to unfounded rumors of a ""communist"" in town in the McCarthy era.

The story is a bit flawed in that early on it's obvious who the perpretrator is, so the climax was a bit anti-climatic. And the fight scene involving the kid and the perpetrator could have been so much more intense and gripping. So I think the movie kind of fell apart at the end and left me a bit unsatisfied.  Look for some POWERHOUSE acting though from actors playing the gay couple and the actress playing the lesbian attorney.  And Illena Douglas is excellent, as always.",1326585600,,633,4.7889908256880735
4716811,3,B005KBP07W,"Three (or more!) stars for superior performances. Harner and Jackson both turn in nuanced, nicely crafted portrayals of grown-up men in an adult relationship. These fellows are the East Coast preppy equivalent of Julianne Moore and Annette Benning as the same-sex couple leading the California good life in ""The Kids Are All Right:"" attractive, educated, tasteful house, nice cars--only the guys have a dog instead of children. Most all the performances in the film are v. good.  As the  private prep school teacher ensnared in a contemporary version of that perennially favorite New England pastime, a ritual witch hunt (the principle motif here, clearly announced in another context by one of his brighter students in an early classroom scene as grimly indicative of humans' true nature), Jason Butler Harner bears an eery resemblance to Willem Dafoe's kid brother. A surfeit of tight shots on his attractive mug reveals that Cheyenne Jackson makes extensive use of shaping his ample lips to create his character.

The disappointing part is that given the actors' apparent desire to create credible queer characters, this is the least problematic script they could find in which to invest their considerable talents. The bad guy's part is so crudely sketched, and Bill Sage, the actor playing him, given so little opportunity to improve matters, it very nearly sinks the whole picture.  Then I happened to catch a few minutes of Sage doing identical mannerisms in a Law and Order episode on the tube and recognized that here was another example of a director relying on an actor's TV persona to do the water carrying.  Sorry. Doesn't work for people who don't watch much television. Too bad. In the hands of a better writer and/or more skilled director, this might have been a seriously good picture. (Well . . . that, and there remains that generous measure of self-righteous pomposity.)

The GOOD part is that this is a real movie, as opposed to all the brain-dead gaysploitation flix, many having rightfully languished for decades without distribution, that have in the last year started abundantly proliferating like mold on stale sliced bread both here and on Netflix. It's worth noting that despite my quibbles about a weak script, The Green is so head and shoulders above that puerile drivel as to inhabit a different film universe entirely. Which is exactly as it should be for film with GBLT content. Can you imagine a video category for ""Straight"" as a genre where ""Straight"" was code for slapdash with predictable plots and gratuitous nudity?",1325808000,10,2555,5.042654028436019
4716812,5,B005KBP07W,"Excellent, thought-provoking film about a gay high school teacher who is wrongly accused of molesting one of his students.  It realistically portrays the untold damage and suffering such an accusation brings to the innocent teacher and those around him.

As an educator myself, I am fully cognizant of the perilously fine line that all compassionate teachers--especially male teachers--must be constantly aware of:  a line that separates acceptable, nurturing practices--care, support and affection--from inappropriate conduct.  It is a delicate balancing act that can lead to disaster for the instructor who crosses, or seems to cross, the line.

There are many things about this movie I like.  The performances are uniformly fine.  With one major exception, the characters are likeable enough, neither saints nor sinners, but simply humans, with all the strengths and weaknesses that word implies.  The gay angle, while central to the story, is never overplayed.  It never degenerates into an us versus them story.  I particularly like the ending.  Rather than giving us a nice pat conclusion with all the loose ends neatly tied up and all the conflicts satisfactorily resolved, we are left with uncertainty.  Does the protagonist take up teaching again?  Does he repair the damaged relationship with his partner?  Does he return to the city he fled or does he remain where he thought he had found the green he was seeking?  It is a fine ending, because that is what life is like.  We are always left with questions.",1324684800,8,1518,5.159836065573771
4716813,4,B005KBP07W,"Michael and Daniel are a gay couple, who fled the urban craziness of New York City, and relocated to a small Connecticut town.  Michael is a teacher at a private high school, and working on a novel in his spare time,  while Daniel is establishing a reputation as a creative caterer.  They quickly make some gay and straight friends in the area, and are reasonably open about their sexuality to all.

All hell breaks loose, when the parent of one of Michael's students charges that the teacher had made passes to the boy.  He is fired from his job, and shunned by most of the town.  When it comes out that there was a previous arrest in NYC - a matter of entrapment, that Michael never told to Daniel - it also threatens to ruin their relationship.  But Michael is most disappointed by the fact that the student doesn't confirm that nothing happened between them.

Small town attitudes confusing homosexuality with pedophilia is far from an original concept for a story, and there is not really much new here.  As is usually the case, there is a secret that doesn't come out until the end, which explains the actions of the student.  The acting is first rate, especially Jason Butler Harner and Cheyenne Jackson as Michael and Daniel, respectively.  Production values seem above average, especially for a low budget indie.  My only beef is the story is nothing really new.  Four stars out of five.",1324512000,2,1396,4.648979591836735
4716814,4,B005KBP07W,It's a very good movie. But there is some focusing issue that I noticed when watching. Other than that it's a good story.,1324425600,,121,4.304347826086956
4716815,2,B005KBP07W,"The movie deals with an openly gay high school teacher and his partner, living together in suburban New England. Suddenly, the teacher is accused of molesting one of his most promising students, and homophobia throughout the town takes off like a rocket.

I really wanted to like this movie. I liked the directing. I like the acting. BUT there are several things in the film that are just so wrong I could not suspend my disbelief to the extent required. First of all, try falling about 15 feet off a porch roof and landing on your side and back. Then see if you can immediately jump up and sprint a few miles full-steam ahead in an attempt to catch a younger person who's running from you. You'll be lucky if you can stand up at all... or even walk. (Something similar happened to me, and I ultimately required hip replacement surgery.)

Secondly, the molestation charge against the high school teacher becomes complicated when an earlier arrest in New York City resurfaces, adding fuel to the fire. Supposedly, the teacher was the victim of police entrapment in a public men's room near Washington Park in 1998. Here's the problem: in New York City, police entrapment in men's rooms ended in the 1970s under Mayor John Lindsay due to courts being clogged up with fabricated charges from a corrupt vice squad. Mayor Lindsay put a stop to this entrapment so that only a private citizen, not a cop, could lodge a complaint against another private citizen. (Had the writer chosen some place other than N.Y.C., he might have been able to get away with it.)

Finally, there's the issue of why the student would allow his favorite teacher to take the rap but keep quiet regarding actual abuse that's been taking place. Also, the entire police investigation is murky and incredible. The teacher is even arrested before any statement is volunteered by the student involved in the alleged molestation. In real life, this just would not happen.

Still, even with its flaws I would like to see more of the talented director, Steven Williford, and actors Jason Butler Harner, Cheyenne Jackson, Julia Ormond, and Ileana Douglas, but in something better... or, at least, better thought out.",1324080000,21,2177,4.81283422459893
4716816,4,B005KBP07W,"In this low-budgeted independent 2011 film, longtime partners (aka boyfriends) Michael (fabulously acted by Jason Jackson) and Daniel (wonderfully acted by Jason Butler Harner) have ""escaped"" (so they think) the nastiness that life can bring by leaving the big city and going to live ""where they can see some green"".  The couple ""escape"" to a ""story book"" looking  small Connecticut town, where the couple seemingly fit  in so very well never ""making any waves"" or trying so very hard not to draw any negative attention to themselves.  After all, they are well employed, hard working, nice looking, mind their own business, smart, etc type of people.  In other words in spite of being gay they are just sooooo very nice until one of life's nasty situations happens.

One of the partners that is a school teacher is falsely accused of molesting one of his students that he has taken ""under his wing"" and subsequently ""all hell breaks loose"". In this extremely well written and greatly directed and acted ""little"" film. We the viewing audience get to see a town turn against a previously and seemingly beloved citizen with he and his partner's relationship being threatened along with some of their friendships threatened mainly because those friends don't ""get"" or understand what he and his partner mean to each other.

This film was very enjoyable to me and I highly recommend it.

And then minor things that happen, just the littlest inclusion of a look or a touch that really brought the movie to a greater level. I thought they did such a good job at that, little nuances.

4716819,4,B005KBP07W,".......BUT, kidding aside, this well done work just CANNOT be put into the 5-STAR rating category of a ""Brokeback Mountain"".

((  Rather than the rating given, I would have preferred awarding between 3 1/2- and 4-STARS......Read on for my take Why  ))
.
Co-Lead performances are of a Good to near High level (but not at that peak achieved by Ledger and Gyllenhaal).  Supporting character efforts, particularly female, are very capable....BUT, think back to those we were given, and saw, 6 years ago.

Storyline / Plot (which has been well covered for us by Old Churns-em-Out):  Not so much.  The male teacher suspected / accused of inappropriate contact with a student (yes, this time a young man---but even that's been done).  Cautionary advice being given---which we know will be ignored.  A hidden truth...a misunderstanding...a breakup of lovers---all fairly stock.

AND...none could guess the REAL Bad Guy??  C'mon!!

I do very much like the way in which the ending has been handled.  Not all sweetness & flowers....not ""all is forgiven"".  YET.....there is Hope.  We are shown Hope.

PS--And speaking of those 4 small letters, which can mean so much in anyone's world.....you should TAKE HOPE.  Because there is yet another little ""Teacher / Student"" film story now working its way through world film festivals, toward a video release for we Stay-at-Home viewers.

4716823,5,B005KBP07W,"THE GREEN (to satisfy many people's quandary about the name) refers to the luxuriant fields and trees of Connecticut: in this film it represents the haven for escaping the chaos of New York City to the quiet and civilized country.  Strike 'civilized', as this film is about anything but civilized behavior on the part of the townspeople where schoolteacher/writer Michael Gavin (Jason Butler Harner) and his longtime partner, locavore caterer Daniel (Cheyenne Jackson) move from the chaotic life of New York City to the gentility of the small Connecticut town.  Michael and Gavin are gay: Michael elects to keep his sexuality sub rosa in his new job as a teacher in a private high school, a 'don't ask-don't tell' adaptation, while Daniel simply goes about his catering business with his assistant Glenn (Michael Godere).  Michael makes a good friend with Trish (Illeana Douglas) who has a healthy outlook despite the presence of recurring cancer requiring chemotherapy.  Trish tries to warn Michael of the gossip in the school, but it is not until Michael attempts to defend a bright student Jason (Chris Bert) that the students and teachers and parents accuse Michael of inappropriate behavior with the shy Jason.

Once the accusation is made the town escalates the situation, Jason runs away from home, and Jason's parents Leo (Bill Sage) and Janette (Karen Young) decide to go after Michael in court.  The men's friends Philip (Boris McGiver) and Bethanne (Mary B. McCann) attempt to help Michael but it becomes apparent that Michael need's a special lawyer - and that expert lawyer is Karen (Julia Ormond) who happens to be in a committed lesbian relationship. An old truth comes out: Michael had a prior arrest in NYC years ago for indecent exposure (police entrapment), but worse than for the case progress is the fact that Michael has never told Daniel about the incident, a fact that creates a serious schism between the two men.  There is a surprising truth that enters into the story that provides an ending few could anticipate and revealing any aspect of it would taint the experience of the new viewer.

The brilliant script was written by Paul Marcarelli and the film is directed with great sensitivity by Steven Williford. The entire cast is first rate, but special kudos have been earned by Jason Butler Harner, Cheyenne Jackson, Illeana Douglas and Julia Ormond - each deserves careful consideration for awards.  But the power of this excellent film is the presentation of homophobia both on the part of the townspeople and students and faculty, but also in the way Michael has elected to lead his life: his own fear of his true identity is as much the cause of his downfall as the external forces.  There are many lessons to be learned form this film, but above all THE GREEN is an example of superb American independent film making at its best, presenting an excellent story in a sophisticated, mature, and reasonable manner.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, October 11",1318982400,32,2990,4.958

8476699,4,B005KBP07W,"There are times in our lives when we get saturated with fast paced lifestyle and see tranquility.  That is what happens to a guy couple who move from hussle and bustle of the big city (NYC) into a picturesque little town full of lush and natural beauty.  But small town people and their attitudes are hard to change.  It is so much easier to live ""don't ask don't tell life"".  Until one day one of the troubled students makes a stunning accusation that can ruin the entire life of a happy gay couple - both personally and professionally.

This is a budget movie but ambitious nevertheless.  I loved performances by Julia Ormond who play a gay lawyer living in the same little town with her partner and Ileanna Douglass who is a friend of a gay couple and the only sincerely non-homophobic person.  Definitely worth watching.  It is a reminder how in a blink of an eye we can loose everything we care about: our lover, our job, our livelihood and hard earned money.  All it takes is a false accusation...",1456185600,,1003,4.497237569060774
