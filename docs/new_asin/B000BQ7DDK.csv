8090939,1,B000BQ7DDK,"I was looking for a bit of nostalgia with this purchase as I remember sneaking up to watch ""Bizarre"" as a young lad of nine or ten when the episodes were rerun on network television(desperately hoping that the guy in charge of placing the black box that covered the girls boobs would slack on his job just once). Alas, these skits are terrible, and should be avoided--unless you happen to be a ten year old boy that has very liberal parents, or you have the maturity level of a preteen. Even when judging these episodes in an early 80's vacuum it's hard to see ""Bizarre"" as the purveyor of impudence that it was billed as. If your looking for cornball sketch comedy from around the same time period check out the ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" which has at least one skit that still manages to offend.",1160784000,,793,4.475862068965517
