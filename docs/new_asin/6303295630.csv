8135454,5,6303295630,"Accurate, shmaccurate.  I have wonderful memories of catching this episode of nova on television with my family, and went looking for it on Amazon on a whim.  I ordered it and watched it again, and if anything it has gotten better.  I guess I don't really care if Nova lied about their methods, or if they inaccurately claim their data supports that of ""Egyptology"" - (what, the entire field of Egyptology?) - I do however value the oafish and volatile humor of the Massachusetts stonemason, boarishly out of place in his tourist clothes and big sunburnt nose, bonding with his non-English speaking crew while not speaking adequate Arabic himself.  Take Mr. This Old House and pair him with a dorky version of Indiana Jones, and you have CHEMISTRY, people, CHEMISTRY!  Watch with guilty pleasure as the bookish archaeologist gets in the way of the builders and antagonizes the pyramid theorists.  Perhaps my favorite moment is the night of completeion celebration, when angry stonemason guy dances with his crew and smiles goofily as he watches a local erotic dancer, who is decked out to look more like a sequined Cyndi Lauper on acid than what I pictured an Arabic dancer to look like, but does that bother our boy?  Heck no.
I think Margaret is right in her review when she says that Nova was not very honest or scientific about their methods, but there is a healthy smattering here of good pyramid lore and architectural information that only adds to the entertainment of the frustrated builders.  When ""This Old Pyramid"" first premiered, I predicted a place on the underground cult classics list. Unfortunately, this didn't happen.  Check it out.",984528000,9,1651,4.888888888888889
8135455,1,6303295630,"NOVA built its mini pyramid with a front-end loader (see the Houston Chronicle (Wrap-up, Saturday, November 13, 1993), while leading its audience to believe that the NOVA pyramid was built using strictly ancient means. The opening narration states, ""They'll [NOVA's workers] use the methods and materials available to the Egyptians to build them [the pyramids]."" NOVA repeated this protocol, ""Roger wanted to lower these blocks in place with a fork-lift, but Mark has insisted on ancient methods."" Because of these statements, vague references to machines, if noticeable, lead viewers to assume the use of inconsequential devices acceptable to the experiment. Examples might be instruments for checking leveling and vehicles for transporting equipment and people.  The front-end loader brought all blocks from the quarry and installed them into the mini-pyramid, except for the three or four one-ton blocks needed for the on-camera demonstration. The front-end loader even placed those few blocks onto NOVA's mini-ramp.  Even if the crew did not have time to build the pyramid by hand during its three weeks on location, the film should have been honest with its audience about how the pyramid was really built. NOVA's goal was to simulate the work of the ancient pyramid builders, who could have built a tiny pyramid in three weeks. After all, NOVA's 18-foot high unfinished mini-pyramid only incorporated less than 200 blocks each weighing either one or two tons. Egyptology calculates (and NOVA repeated this figure) that an average of one block was set in the Great Pyramid every two or three minutes per work day. Clearly, despite NOVA's claims, NOVA never proved its case.  Other fatal flaws make this misleading film useless as documentary (a full discussion of each point here appears in Morris, M., The Egyptian Pyramid Mystery Is Solved!, Margaret Morris Books, 2000).
First, although the film stated that only ancient means would be used, NOVA used modern steel tools to quarry and shape all of its pyramid blocks. NOVA's blocks were of the softest limestone at Tura. This stone is much softer than the blocks of the Great Pyramid, which are mostly medium-hard to hard and cannot be leveled or otherwise correctly shaped with the copper tools of the Pyramid Age. Moreover, fossil shells in Giza limestone make it particularly difficult to shape correctly with primitive tools.  NOVA's modern steel tools are unacceptable for an experiment showing how the ancient Egyptians might have quarried, leveled and otherwise correctly shaped fossil shell limestone blocks. Pyramid Age tools were made of wood, copper (a relatively soft metal) and stone, and their capabilities have no relationship to those of steel tools.  Thus, NOVA defied both scientific methodology and up-to-date Egyptology. Dieter Arnold, for instance, admits that the means of quarrying is unknown. Arnold writes, ""The question as to what kind of tools were used to cut the separation trenches and to lift the blocks from their beds has not been answered satisfactorily because of the contradiction between the tool marks left on the quarry walls and the tools actually found in ancient Egypt"" (Building in Egypt, 1993).
Second, the film advocates that copper tools were used to shape ancient pyramid blocks, ignoring the most up-to-date Egyptology. For instance, Arnold's Building in Egypt acknowledges that copper tools could not have been used. Aside from the inadequacy of copper tools, the mines could not have supplied the amount of copper needed.
Third, while ramps are suitable for building small pyramids, engineers, including Peter Hodges, showed that the Great Pyramid would not exist if its construction depended on any kind of ramp. NOVA should not have implied that its experiment solved major problems of building the Great Pyramid. Yet, the film concluded by claiming that NOVA solved the major unresolved problems.
Fifth, there is a basic methodological distortion in drawing conclusions from such a mini-experiment. Engineering problems multiply in full-scale operations. The congestion on a ramp of the size required for the Great Pyramid would be extraordinary. The frequent application of water would quickly cause such a ramp, made of clay and stone rubble, to become unstable.
Sixth, NOVA suggested that using a spiral ramp solves outstanding construction problems. However, such a device produces more problems than it solves with regard to the Great Pyramid's construction. The film displayed a three-dimensional computer-rendered image of a cantilevered spiral ramp. In reality, its special cantilever support beams would have to be built into the pyramid faces to meet complex engineering requirements. For instance, the beams would have to extend far enough into the core masonry to counterbalance the weight of their unsupported lengths extending beyond the pyramid's faces. Each beam must also have enough counterbalance to support the weight of its proportional load of the finished ramp, plus the proportional load of the heaviest weight moving along the ramp (like the 27 foot-long beams over the King's Chamber). The cantilevered ramp system is so demanding that it would dramatically impact calculations for building the Great Pyramid. Theorists, for instance, mostly work with an average block size of 2.5 tons, but they would need to factor in the elevation of thousands of enormous cantilever beams for the ramp itself. Given the overwhelming demands of the cantilevered ramp, it is surprising that NOVA introduced the idea.  Critics of the spiral ramp point out that it would obscure the true reference points (the four corner stones at the pyramid's base, the angle of the pyramid's sides, and its baseline). Failure to make all measurements from these absolute reference points would introduce errors that would compound as the pyramid rose. Even the slightest error would have compounded as workers took successive measurements from inaccurate reference points. The result would be a structure with irregular sides that would not form a proper pyramid shape.  NOVA offered no solution to this problem, making it impossible to take this design seriously.  This misleading film is an affront to scientific methodology. It sends a terrible message to students, who need to learn honesty and respect for scientific method.",970012800,7,6336,5.341683366733467
