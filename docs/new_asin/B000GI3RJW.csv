8132699,5,B000GI3RJW,"This is a must have for night owls who want something to listen to and watch; Burton's wonderful voice and the animated, most humorous drawings belong in your library.",1410652800,2,167,4.793103448275862
8132700,3,B000GI3RJW,This is a useful introduction to the radio play for students who find it difficult to visualize the play for themselves. It has more moments of real imagination than the poor very literal live action version with Burton and the badly miscast Elizabeth Taylor.,1212883200,2,259,4.909090909090909
