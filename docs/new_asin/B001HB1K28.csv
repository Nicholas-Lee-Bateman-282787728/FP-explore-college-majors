3627801,5,B001HB1K28,"AMERICAN FUSION is the best romantic comedy I've ever seen. It's very well written and very well acted. The story is about what happens when two cultures collide and try to combine. Yvonne, (Sylvia Chang), a Chinese journalist, meets up with Jose (Esai Morales), a Mexican dentist. And the fun begins. Yvonne is frustrated by her mother, who traditionally tries to rule her children and grandchildren's lives. Jose, is a good son, but not controlled by his mother or the rest of his family. The cast chemistry, and the dialogue is great! The interaction between Yvonne, her siblings and their mother really makes for good satire. I found myself rooting for Yvonne and Jose just because of their daring to defy the stereotyping of Chinese and Mexican cultures, and choosing to follow their hearts, not ethnic traditions.",1297555200,2,819,4.985401459854015

3627803,5,B001HB1K28,"While this movie appears to be aimed at, and will appeal to, Asian audiences, the humor and message can be appreciated by everyone.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and I think you will too, if your skin is black, white, red or yellow. It's great to see Esai Morales in a comedy.  Although most of the actors are unfamiliar to American audiences, the performances were first-rate.",1240012800,3,372,4.707692307692308
3627804,4,B001HB1K28,"Entertaining and humorous, this pokes fun at the cultural quirks of some ethnic groups. It's probably funnier if one is familiar with and have spent time around these particular peoples. It has a motley cast of characters played by a very talented cast. It also made me wonder why we don't see more of Esai Morales.",1234483200,2,315,4.642857142857143
3627805,5,B001HB1K28,"I really enjoy watching this movie, and I believe there are characters in it that everyone can relate to.  It is very funny, and has an amazing cast.  Definitely worth watching!",1232150400,,177,4.67741935483871
3627806,5,B001HB1K28,"American Fusion is a winner.  In fact, it won the audience award at the Hawaii International Film Festival and broke the record for most sold-out screenings.  It has been wined and dined quietly elsewhere since its completion.  And it is no wonder. It's an amazing debut for writer/director Frank Lin.  This sleeper has the opportunity to go big through word of mouth.  Spread the word to all who love My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Chinese culture, great cast chemistry, or romantic comedies in general.",1231804800,,499,4.892857142857143
3627807,4,B001HB1K28,"Ok, the DVD hasn't been released yet.  However, I have seen this film twice so I can provide a decent review of the film.  I can revise at a later time about the DVD and any extras.  Some minor spoilers about the film.

American Fusion is a Asian-American Independent comedy directed by first time director Frank Lin.  The film debuted at the San Francisco Asian American Film Festival around 2005.  It hit the theaters in 2007 and had an extended run in Los Angeles and Seattle.  However, due to lack of marketing, the film fizzled in other markets.

The film centers around longtime HK actress Sylvia Chang.  Chang portrays a middle-aged divorced woman who feels her life is over before she runs into a handsome doctor (Esai Morales).  In between, there is some family hijinx and jokes galore.  Some jokes are admittedly Chinese/Chinese-American-centric, and it may go over some people's heads.

However, as a Chinese-American, I immensely enjoyed the film.  I took two female friends (one Latin American, one Chinese American) and they also enjoyed the film.

I felt this film didn't get the exposure it deserved, but it gets a second life on DVD and hopefully, it will do well.",1224547200,12,1181,4.810945273631841

8308382,5,B001HB1K28,"I'm a fan of Esai Morales, but I've never heard of this movie. The entire cast is recognizable from other movies that they have starred in, and this movie is relatable no matter what language your family argues in. A movie to love.",1445644800,2,231,4.395348837209302

8308387,5,B001HB1K28,"American Fusion is one of the funniest love comedies my family has seen and a great skewering of the stereotypes we all harbor, mostly unconsciously, about each other. There are a few mildly racy scenes or bits of dialog, but by today's standards it's hardly mentionable and nothing the kids haven't seen more of in other films. Good acting (the Chinese grandmother is hilarious and could make anyone squirm!) and great entertainment -- only wish the same producers would make more movies like American Fusion!",1335052800,2,510,5.011764705882353
8308388,5,B001HB1K28,"I really enjoyed this film.  Many years ago I was involved in an intercultural relationship. Unfortunately, mine did not have a happy ending, but I was very glad that Yvonne and Jose had theirs.  ""We are all Americans"" is true, but often not truly understood.  This film is a wonderful comedy, but there are some serious messages in it from which we can all learn.",1326758400,2,364,4.569230769230769
8308389,5,B001HB1K28,"A great Asian American comedy film.  This is a very original movie that I have nothing to compare it to. I thought at first I wouldn't like this movie, but when I actually watched it, it made me laugh the whole way though. Definitely give this movie a try if you like watching Asian American films.",1316044800,2,298,4.321428571428571
