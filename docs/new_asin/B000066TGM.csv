7962495,5,B000066TGM,"For the scene when Kirk Douglas as The Maestro explains his philosophy of life to be lived as if one were filming:
5 stars!",1353369600,,123,4.166666666666667
7962496,4,B000066TGM,"Has some great moments; some really great comic acting.  A little film that was, alas, overlooked by the box office.",1209254400,2,116,4.8
7962497,4,B000066TGM,"This was a Brian De Palma film that was made as a school project.  So you get to see Nancy Allen before she had made any movies; plus pretty much every other character became famous to some extent.  And they are all playing comedy perfectly (which is to act like you are not intending to be funny).
Really different movie, probably would get an R-Rating these days, much like Animal House.  Kirk Douglas, the only ""official"" star, very unusual role for him and he brings a terrific credibility to the film.  Very, very nicely done picture. Extremely funny.",1095811200,6,556,4.642857142857143
7962498,3,B000066TGM,"If your a fan of Nancy Allen or Brian DePalma, or Keith Gordon you should enjoy this one. It's not the best of Brian DePalma's work, but I fell in love with the humour. This is deminstated in numerous scenes with Nancy Allen. I loves the two scenes when 1. Her hand puppet rabbit comes alive-who didn't laugh at the bit''I'm rabbit and this is toots with the heavenly body, catch us at the pussycat,catch us at the pussycat. 2. After she's been out eating hamburgers with Keith Gordons character, her boyfriend gets the scent of something he hasn't smelt in a long time ie( he's only eating health food- he puts her through a series of tests to see if she's worthy of being with him). It's worth a look.",1045958400,5,703,4.374045801526718
