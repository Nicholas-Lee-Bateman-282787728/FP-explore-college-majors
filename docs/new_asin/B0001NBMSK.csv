8015009,5,B0001NBMSK,"Ever since I saw a trailer for Dragon drive on one of my anime DVDs, I wanted to watch it. I loooovvvvee dragons, and I couldn't wait when the DVD would be realeased. Well, I finally bought it yesterday, and I was pleasently surprised.

Even though this is obvisouly aimed at younger boys ( or possibly young) I found myself already addicted to the storyline. I found myslef loving the main character, Reiji, because he seemed liek you're tyupical loser, and yet he had a true hidden talent, or ""sleeping dragon"" inside of him. He's not only a chracter who's easy to realte to, his character devolps strongly, even in the first five episodes.

I also enjoyed the battle scenes between the dragons, especially when Chibisuke ( Reji's adorable dragon)

It says 7 up on the back of the DVD box, but please don't let this make you stay away form the series. I'm a high school girl, and I now consider this to be one of my favorites.

I promise you, you won't regret buying it",1125705600,,971,4.468926553672317
