Usually it their story is detailed and completely focused on friendships with other girls, working out and accepting each other's differences, forgiving each other, believing in their friends, having visions for their friends, helping others...etc.  Even though this is a Japanese cartoon, it has lots of great Christian values.  Also it does not have much Romance things going on the movie.  This series, Precure 5 has a couple of guys, but they are actually animals, and it is very minimal in terms of romance factor.  Also no male figure comes and help them to fight throughout any Precure movie.  All they got is these 5 girls to fight the bad guys to help others.  I also like ""Heartcatch Precure"".  It has absolutely NO romance thing going on, it is all about girls and their friendships and help others who are struggling with their weakness, and they fight bad guys.  I wish they show Precure serious in US.  It has way better content than movies like Barbie or disney movies, which always have Romance factors, and also tend to depend on ""men"" than importance of friendships.",1296518400,2,1124,4.807291666666667
