1509205,5,B00005JMMT,"NBC gave us four new episodes of ""Boomtown"" this weekend . . . c'mon, fellas, if you're not going to keep the series on TV, at least release the first season on DVD for us!  One of the first truly intelligent and enjoyable series I've seen in a long time.  First NBC instructs the writers to ""dumb it down"" for the audience, as they decided we're not bright enough to comprehend the first-season format.  Then they opt to cancel it completely. Thanks for thinking for us, guys . . . . what would we do without you.  ; )",1072656000,12,519,4.212121212121212

Hopefully if enough people sign in at the top, the studio will release the first season (along with the first couple of episodes from this season) on DVD.  Keep supporting the show.
Maybe another network will pick it up (I doubt it, but you never know)",1070928000,3,377,4.295774647887324
1509207,5,B00005JMMT,"That lady friend of david the lawyer is OFF THE HOOK. But seriously folks, Boomtown is quite possibly the greatest crime drama ever released. It's put together amazingly in probably the most original format i've ever seen, the story lines grab you by the balls and don't let go, and it's all brought together by an amazing cast. Guy with severe underbite from forest gump, lady from minority report, and especially everyones favorite new kid ont he block, donnie wahlberg. They all bring a perfect touch of drama to this nearly perfect television show.
It would be a shame if this isn't released to the US on DVD. Season one of Boomtown truely was a masterpeice. A wiseman once said, ""The fire you kindle for your enemy often burns yourself more than him."" I don't know what this means, but i do know one thing...Boomtown was pure gold. We need to support Boomtown, if we all enter our e-mail addresses at the top of the page and vote, boomtown will rise from the ashes and become imortalized in the form of DVD.

Starting at the end but going backwards to the start, interupted with peoples lives, jobs, family, misinformation, misunderstandings! I truly believe it was on par with ""The Killing""(AMC), ""Breaking Bad""(AMC), and ""Hill Street Blues"". It was a gritty display of life as we know it and yet it was dropped. Hello? So if there is anybody out there,even at this late date, from this show, reading these reviews; the writers, the filmers, the actors (who more than likely have gone on to bigger things(?) it was great to watch, despairingly sad to see it evaporate!",1318896000,,736,4.689922480620155

1509739,5,B00005JMMT,"A stellar addition to the category of ""Why did they cancel that show but let ..... (insert any number of silly shows here) survive?"", Boomtown is second only to ""Homicide: Life on the Streets"" as a quality production.  I am so grateful to be able to revisit these episodes. The writing is fantastic; characters complex; there is comparatively little on-screen violence, relying largely on character development.  The framework of the episodes is one in which the plot is seen from the viewpoint of selected characters and gives a ""Rashomon""-like structure; the resolution of the story is usually genuinely unexpected and (I hate to get all sappy on you, but it's true) uplifting.",1249776000,,679,5.053571428571429
1509740,5,B00005JMMT,"Truly, I think this is one of the best shows not only to come out of NBC, but to ever be put on the air. The creators took a familiar setting - cops and lawyers piecing together the puzzle of the crime - and gave it new life with an understanding from everyone's personal point of view. The entire cast was wonderful, the writing was wonderful, and it still baffles me how something like this could be taken off the air so quickly. I came to the show for Donnie Wahlberg (long after my favorite New Kid stopped singing, I followed), but I stayed for the whole package. A must-own boxset, and you'll also be asking the question of why it was ever cancelled.",1243641600,,656,4.298387096774194
1509741,4,B00005JMMT,Just like everything I  buy from Amazon if its used and the description says Good condition it might as well be new. I love it!,1242604800,,127,4.08
1509742,5,B00005JMMT,"Like some other excellent TV series (Dirty Sexy Money, Gideon's Crossing, Brooklyn South), Boomtown was a victim of tough profit expectations and a viewing audience that did not fully appreciate its unusual but very watchable format, intelligent writing, and in-depth acting that made for great drama with nice character development.  I was gratified that NBC and the producers of Boomtown realized that the audience for the show was large enough to warrant a DVD box set release; as a bonus, the price is very reasonable.

In general, I still love watching the show and most of the episodes stand up to repeated watching.  I also have two quibbles with this set:

1.  The most glaring deficit is not including the six episodes of the very truncated season 2 in the set.  Although the cast and format changed slightly, the season 2 episodes are just as good , if not better in some respects, than season 1.  Season 2's inclusion would have greatly increased the appeal of this set and I believe the production costs would not have increased significantly.

2.  I greatly enjoyed most of the episode commentary included in this set.  I would have appreciated much more commentary, perhaps even for every episode, as well as quality deleted scenes.  I would have been willing to pay more for these.

On the whole, this is a reasonable-cost opportunity to catch a unique and well-acted drama that ended prematurely.",1236729600,,1412,4.88655462184874
1509743,5,B00005JMMT,"Never heard of this before but bought it on a whim when looking for a crime drama....it turned out great.  I wish there was more!  It's very unique in that it shows the day from multiple perspectives as it leads you to the end and resolving the case. Lots of great actors who have moved on to many other shows/movies. I thought it was great....wish there was a season 2,etc.",1235520000,,374,4.328571428571428

1509871,5,B00005JMMT,"Seriously, there is so much mindless drivel on tv that this series should NEVER have been cancelled!  Well acted (personally I believe that Donnie Wahlberg is as good as his brother, he just doesn't get the big roles), well directed, neat camera angels.  Just all around good.

1509874,5,B00005JMMT,"I bought this set in November 2005 and was so excited to find it for alot less than I was willing to pay (idiots).  I broke the plastic this year (July 2008) after rewatching Homicide seeason for the fourth time in the last four years.  I was looking for something gripping and excellent and remembered I had it all along.  Yes, I watched every episode when it first came out and rewatching it my only thought was - Dang!!  This was awesome TV.  Homicide, Boomtown - the elite that never got boring.  I like Law and Order but safe has always been boring.  And after a while - the impact is lost.  Boomtown never lost it.  And every character - no matter how flawed has a redeeming quality.  Ray appears to be a stereotype but isn't.  I was always a big Fearless fan but repeated viewings show that the conscience of the show is Ray.  I love this show and want to share it with the world!!

1509877,5,B00005JMMT,"I've had ""Boomtown"" in my Amazon wish list for probably a year before finally ordering it.  I was fairly certain it was a good show, but I was hesitant because I remembered some of NBC's marketing when it briefly aired.  They made it sound like a murder mystery show. It's not.

Boomtown shows the viewer not just multiple angles of a crime, but also multiple stories through the eyes of various characters that enhance the overall story.  A traditional show, especially a crime drama, will show you different parts of the story in chronological order.  There might be flashbacks, but they're generally exactly at the right time in order to fill in a necessary plot point.

Boomtown wasn't created that way.  The angle shifts according to character.  They don't flash the text ""4 hours later"" on the screen like more traditional shows like Without A Trace.  Instead, they'll have a character's name like ""Joel"" and then they'll show you his story and point of view.  Sometimes you see what he saw at the crime scene, other times you'll see something in his personal life that relates to why he's reacting a certain way to the crime. I can't think of a single show on the air or in recent memory that has ever taken this approach.  It does require paying more attention a little more brain power, but that's what makes it great TV.

Boomtown is a well blended mosaic that just seems to fit perfectly.  Because the scenes aren't chronological it allows the show more leeway to present multiple sub-stories and just better character development.  It's likely the producers of Lost watched an episode or two of Boomtown before they came up with their idea.  Boomtown's stories aren't as complex as Lost's, but it's still groundbreaking in its presentation.  Too bad it rests in obscurity while other horrible programs remain on the air.

Boomtown stars Neal McDonough and Donnie Wahlberg and was created by Grahm Yost - all three were involved in Band of Brothers, one of the highest rated programs of all time.  Boomtown isn't at the level of HBO, but the quality of work from these three men is apparent here.

I've watched many many canceled shows and found that many didn't deserve their fate.  Meanwhile, bad shows - King of Queens was on for 9 seasons(!)- remain on the air.  Boomtown is on the same list with Firefly, Wonderfalls, and many others.  It's curse was that it came out right around the time reality TV started to hit it big. It was then trounced by the dreck that curses us even now.

If you like good TV, check out Boomtown.",1211932800,2,2540,4.671171171171171

1509994,5,B00005JMMT,"Cancelling this wonderful unique series has to be NBC's biggest regret. The plot was fantastic and the acting was top rate. Sadly, people would rather watch crap reality TV than great quality shows such as this one. It probably would have done better on today's cable.

1509995,5,B00005JMMT,"How often are we presented with a show so brilliantly written and acted, with each episode and character so captivating, that you feel like there's a little hole in your life when it's over and you still mourn it years later?  The writers and directors accomplished something amazing here in making us care for each character, even the manipulative ADA David McNorris (the excellent and underappreciated Neal McDonough).  Boomtown is another in the long line of many programs (Angel, Firefly, Arrested Development and Futurama, to name a few) cut down before their time.  McDonough got Medical Investigation soon after, but that was also on NBC.  Can you guess what happened?  Well, at least I got to see him and Wahlberg this year on Tin Man and Kill Point, respectively.  They are both still at the top of their game.  I don't remember seeing any of the other actors in anything recently, though I would very much like to.  Every one of them was indispensable to Boomtown.  So, I've come to the conclusion that there is no choice for you.  Buy this DVD and enjoy it while it lasts, especially the unforgettable ""Blackout"" where we spiral down into fear with McNorris when he wakes up after a night of drinking to find blood on his car and no memory of an accident.  Another ""Must See"" is ""Home Invasion.""  I haven't seen it since it first aired, but remember certain parts vividly.  As I said to someone else not too long ago, I recommend watching it during the day, with the doors and windows locked, the alarm system on, and heavily armed sentries at points of entry with packs of vicious guard dogs by their sides.

so this episode is near the end of seas 1, I also saw Rebecca deMornay's unbelievable female robber murder the two cops, and openly threaten Vanessa Williams who is watching her. so this is all close to end of season 1.

But what happened to Season 2, Ive checked a TVtome episode guide, only shows an incomplete seas 2,maybe 6 or7 eps,

 but cant find any mention of a DVD for seas 2 on amazon or anywhere?

Are they included with some editions of the season 1 DVD set, or is it possible they were never released on DVD?

this was a sensational series..

1510127,5,B00005JMMT,"This was a wonderful show that told stories from several point of views like no other show on television.  It was a refreshing change with an excellent cast.  My favorite is defintely Neal McDonough's character David McNorris, which he played to perfection.  Donnie Wahlberg's Joel Steven's and Mykelti Williamson's Bobby ""Fearless"" Smith have such great chemistry.  I have never enjoyed a show as much as I enjoyed the rich characters and storylines on this show.  A must see in my opinion.",1168473600,5,491,5.012345679012346
1510128,5,B00005JMMT,"This series is an awesome story of the interactions between police, EMT's, and the District Attorney's office. The idea of taking the story and looking at it from the different people's point of view, is unique for television. This series will keep your attention and each episode will leave you wanting more. It was a travsity that it only lasted one season, as it rivaled ""NYPD Blue,"" and ""Third Watch,"" with the intermeangling of the lives of the characters in this series that was slowly revealing the personal lives of the people that you grow to care about. If this series doesn't make the ""Brilliant But Cancelled"" list, they should give up.",1160438400,4,648,4.794642857142857
1510129,5,B00005JMMT,"One of the most innovative, best directed, and conceived dramatic series which lasted only a brief two seasons, ""Boomtown"" is now defunct and it is our loss. Each weekly episode featured the seven different perspectives of the principle characters, beat cops Tom and Ray, detectives Fearless Smith and Joel Stevens, self-loathing alcoholic deputy D.A. McNorris, his rich-girl mistress and investigative reporter Andrea, and heart of gold EMT, Teresa. Using the L.A. streets and iconic landscapes to situate the weekly stories of crime and punishment, the cast gives mini-one act plays that feature the storyline from their unique pov. It is a subtle method of storytelling and obviously one that was much too subtle for NBC which dropped the production after it won several awards. However, the series is preserved on DVD which makes this exceptional work available. With Neal McDonaugh, Donny Wahlberg, and Jason Gedrick, directed by Graham Yost, the individual performances marked the epitome of ensemble casts. The only drawback to the series is the tinkering which NBC initiated in the second season that changed the format of the individual perspectives to feature a single actor, however that did not lessen the superior scripts and exceptional cinematography as well as performances that were showcased each week.

The DVD features some commentary by producers and cast, although the two brief exposition shorts at the end of disc 5 is far from  comprehensive.  Good for bits on each of the actors however, which lends to the appreciation of the overall series performances and directorial challenge.  One of the best so therefore, it's gone before audiences could appreciate its brilliance.",1152489600,9,1698,5.324626865671642

I have never seen a group of actors blend so splendidly throughout a series. As a viewer you wind up caring about them. You find yourself involved and relating to them and their particular situations. You want more. And wanting more is as much of a compliment as any series could hope to expect.

  A brilliant piece of filmaking all around.

  The bottom line is that one person had the authority to sign off on shutting down this show and to that person I would say: ""Boom you, and the horse you rode in on"".

It was that good.",1150934400,6,643,4.491379310344827
1510131,5,B00005JMMT,"Well, unlike many on here, I never saw this show on TV.  I only discovered it after it came out on DVD.  I am so shocked that they cancelled this great show.  I bet there was a shakeup on the set, and it got very un-popular.  I wonder if any egos got in the way.

In any case, I give this 5 stars, and two very enthusiastic thumbs up.  This DVD set is the VERY FIRST TV to DVD set I ever bought.  Funny how it stands out in my mind as my most favorite.

I was very intrigued by the ""same crime"" from a different viewpoint concept.  It really is fantastic.  I love how the writers fool you into believing one thing, but then the story completely changes by the end.

Extras were a bit lacking, but it did get cancelled early on. Its interesting that they film the extra behind the scenes when the cast is unaware that the show will be cancelled, for obvious reasons.  This way you get to hear them interviewed in a fresh scope, without any negativity in their attitudes.

I'm really glad they brought this one out on DVD.  Would have hated missing this show.

Anyone know what the ""expensive"" other Boomtown DVD is listed on Amazon?  Season 2 rarities?  Not sure.  Thanks for reading my review.",1145836800,6,1193,4.25
1510132,4,B00005JMMT,"Anytime you can find this television DVD package at a cheap price - $35 or less - you should grab it, because it's well worth the money. What a pity that the show only lasted one year. It was one of the better crime stories on TV in the past decade.

Maybe it was too intelligent for the average [...]....but that's a little snobbish. Perhaps the network was at fault, not giving a quality show enough time to develop an audience. Two years of this show might have done it. They have certainly done with other shows, most of which were of inferior quality to this.

What made this show unique was that it showed the crime from five different angles: the victim, the perpetrator, the police, the district attorney and the medical personnel. The episodes were well-acted, from the low key Donnie Walhberg to the super-intense Neal McDonough. Those two, along with Mykelti Williamson, Gary Basaraba, Nina Garbiras, Lana Parilla and Jason Gedrick all were fun to watch, even if they didn't all play likable characters.

The stories were different, too. There is enough variety to make this DVD package enjoyable for multiple viewings.",1145232000,8,1130,4.7846153846153845

1510134,2,B00005JMMT,"I will act as the lone dissenter from the crowd and say that my husband and I both thought that Boomtown was slow-moving, poorly acted, overly contrived, and well... BORING. Written by the same guy who did the similarly schmaltzy saccharine Band of Brothers, Boomtown was The Shield except... the crimes were boring... and the characters were boring... and the trope of seeing the same event through many eyes gets old fast.

If you want a great crime drama that gives you a sense of LA, the city, and is character driven and written by people with actual talent, check out the Shield and don't get tricked into thinking Boomtown is brilliant.",1142640000,,643,4.741071428571429
1510135,5,B00005JMMT,"Many of the other reviews posted here sum up Boomtown the TV show, and I add my voice to those who say what a fine program it was. In fact, in my opinion it was one of the best TV shows ever made. In this review I would like to also sing the praises of Boomtown the DVD set.

Although there isn't commentary for every single episode, it is there for what I would consider the best, most crucial episodes, provided by a variety of folks, both actors (Donnie Wahlberg, Mykelti Williamson, Neal McDonough) and behind-the-scenes people such as creator/producer Graham Yost. I have heard some commentaries that made me wonder what the point was of adding commentary, and others that were clearly scripted in advance--Boomtown's commentaries do not disappoint. They are all informative and entertaining. Especially not to be missed is Mykelti Williamson's commentary on the episode ""Fearless"", where he discusses the personal story that inspired the episode--you won't view it the same way again. Throughout the commentaries as well as the two very enjoyable featurettes, you learn about the multiple-viewpoints style of the show, and how it went from a rigid story-telling format (e.g., no character's viewpoint is seen more than once) to something much more flexible that could more easily accomodate the story-telling (e.g., ""Fearless,"" in which pretty much the whole episode is from Fearless's point of view). You also learn some of the behind-the-scenes wrangling that led to more linear stores (under pressure from NBC), and by the second season resulted in taking away from Boomtown what made it unique (and quickly got it cancelled). =(

I have shown some of these DVD episodes to several friends who never watched Boomtown on NBC; all of them really enjoyed it. Many of the episodes get better with subsequent viewing (really!), a rarity with TV episodes--you know how it goes, you buy the DVD set, watch them once, they gather dust. Not so with Boomtown. Because of the complexity of story-telling, genuine surprises, commentaries, and of course superb acting, you will watch these DVDs more than once.

Scenes/episodes to especially watch for:

* Episode 1 (""Pilot""): Classic Boomtown. The opening scene makes no sense whatsoever...until the end of the episode when a longer version of it is played. I can't help crying a little every time I see the scene when the suspect's life is shown in reverse, going back to him as a child jumping on his bed. It reminds me that even those whom society writes off started off as kids jumping on beds. (Includes commentary.)

* Episode 11 (""Monster's Brawl""): The former Doogie Howser, currently on ""How I Met Your Mother"", Neil Patrick Harris plays a character quite different from either. Unexpected twists, and a personal reaction to the case from Det. Stevens (Wahlberg) that kicks you in the gut.

* Episodes 14-15 (""Execution"" & ""Storm Watch""): Essentially a two-parter. I don't remember a lot of especially ""Boomtown""-specific story-telling, but these are exciting ""cop"" show episodes, with lots of payoff of personal stuff we've seen earlier constantly simmering. Especially not to be missed are McNorris's conversation with the death row inmate, and Stevens being forced to question his fellow officers. (Both with commentary.)

* Episode 16 (""Fearless""): As mentioned above, this is an intensely personal story, made even more personal once listening with the commentary. Mykelti Williamson shines. (Includes commentary.)

* Episode 17 (""Blackout""): Perhaps the finest episode of the season (in my opinion, a tie with the very emotional Episode 18). One of the best things about Boomtown was Neal McDonough as DA McNorris. I have seen him in other programs, but as McNorris I can't take my eyes off him. In this episode he has an alcohol-induced blackout and realizes he may be responsible for a hit-and-run that the police are investigating. The scene in his garage is incredible. Watch, rewind, watch again. Repeat. Even the scene with the--ahem, dancer--is riveting, as we gain greater insight into McNorris, and even feel as though we know the dancer at least a little. Few Boomtown conversations are mere information exchanges. (Includes commentary.)

* Episode 18 (""Lost Child""): Wow. All right, the crime is wedded to the personal story a little bit too obviously in this one, and the discovery of certain documents near the end of the episode seems a bit contrived to me, but this episode is so incredible I can let those things go. This is primarily a Stevens (Wahlberg) episode, although other characters are drawn in nicely. This episode is the climax to a story that progresses throughout the season, the death of Stevens's baby and subsequent suicide attempt of his wife, who felt responsible. Just try to get through this one without shedding a tear or two.

Most of the episodes I named as favorites fall at the end of the season. I don't think this is necessarily because the show's quality improved at the end--it was always great. It's just that underlying each episode are personal threads--sometimes prominent in the epidode, sometimes just a look between two characters. By the end of the season, you've really gotten to know and care about the characters, so you get that extra payoff in episodes like ""Fearless"", ""Blackout"", and ""Lost Child"".

I have a hard time stopping when I start talking about Boomtown, but enough said. This DVD set is well worth purchasing.",1141084800,12,5441,5.0344444444444445

I know that there are just 6 seasons of episode two, and I surely hope they would still bring out the DVD.

It DOES only have 6-10 new episodes but then everyone's collection will be complete.  I can't understand why such an excellent show was taken off the air when it got so many awards.  I, personally, am sick of reality TV-I mean, after all, life is NOT a competition.  I tend to watch Court TV, home improvement shows and dvds.  Regular tv doesn't interest me, anymore.  And then, NBC had the GALL to cancel another fine series, Joan of Arcadia.  NBC wouldn't recognize a hit if it bit them on the ass.",1124755200,6,616,4.495495495495495
1510290,4,B00005JMMT,"I suppose that Boomtown may have been in direct competition with The Shield, both are set in L.A., both have a mix of uniformed cops and detectives, unlike most cop shows which deal only with the plainclothes guys. Of the two I prefer the Shield but Boomtown was still miles better that both the CSI and Law and Order series and their spinoffs.

Boomtown may have had little that was new about it, cops under investigation, cops with family problems,cops who hasd lost friends in the army. But it was well done and the stories for the most part rang true. OK Bobby Smith doing his best to be Bruce Willis in Die Hard was bit hard to take, but for the most part the action was believable.

If you like cop shows this was was one of the best not as good as The Shield, The Wire or Hill Street Blues but up there withCagney and Lacey and NYPD Blue.",1124064000,2,845,4.24223602484472
1510291,5,B00005JMMT,"Donnie Wahlberg, Mykelti Williamson and Neal McDonough were fantastic in this series. I especially loved Mykelti Williamson with all his stories and never-ending smile. I've never seen a show just hit the ground running. The cast clicked and the first episode seemed like it was their 100th. The writing was unbelieveably good. You'll be glued to the DVD set whether you have seen all the episodes or not. Fabulous series that needs to be brought back!! Can't say enough good things about it.",1123372800,4,492,4.9397590361445785
1510292,4,B00005JMMT,"I got hooked on this show from the first episode when I got the DVD - I never had the chance to see it when it aired in 2002.  This concept in storytelling is very unique and watchable - and the previous reviewer is correct - you can't sit like a vegetable while watching it, a brain is required to connect the dots and plot fragments while solving the puzzle.

The characters are fresh and well-developed, the storylines are tight, and the acting and dialogue is excellent and well-written.

The last show that I got hooked on like this was Homicide: Life on the Street, which is of course the best dang cop TV show in the history of television.

I was saddened to see that NBC canceled this show after only 1.5 seasons.  It says a lot about the American people (nothing positive) that stupid, plotless ""reality TV""  (biggest oxymoron of the 21st century) gets top ratings and top hype, while the intellectual, top tier shows languish because there simply isn't enough of a market.

One warning I will make is to people with kids; there is a bit of off-color language and several shows have scenes in strip clubs and the subject matter in several shows is for mature audiences only.  I wouldn't let a kid younger than 13 or 15 watch it.",1116115200,6,1237,4.466666666666667
1510293,5,B00005JMMT,"I live in the UK. Period. The two shows I mentioned are probably the best cop show drama I have ever watched, surpassing even NYPD Blue. How Boomtown got dropped is beyond me. It simply doesn't get any better. The same goes for Third watch. I would buy it on DVD if it were available for gods sake. I often wonder what the world is coming too when seriously talented storytelling goes un-rewarded, especially when the acting performances add to the whole experience. If these shows are not commercially popular enough, what the hell CRAP are people watching these days????. Enough said.",1115683200,7,586,4.754901960784314
1510294,5,B00005JMMT,"i caught this show on FX289 here in the uk, i tend to watch the 1st few episodes or so of any show that comes on in this sort of genre, just to see if i can get a feel for the cast, if i can relate to the story lines, and most of all, if i can handle donating an hour (at least) a week to its cause.

Boomtown hit every single one of these buttons. The way the storyline was told was somewhat reminiscent of something Tarantino would come up with, the disjointed storylines, that all come together in the end with little twists in the tail to make an absolutely stunning climax.

It was so refreshing to see america produce a new, yet totally original show, lets look at the others:

CSI - brilliant

2 spinoffs, both pretty poor. (save gary sinese in NY as he won my praise as an actor in forrest gump)

Homicide: Life on the streets: 36,000 spinoffs

Law + order: even the good lord cant count to this number of spinoffs.

Boomtown was refreshing and original, perhaps that was its greatest downfall, the clever plotlines, the sneaky twists, it seems any show that makes an american audience have to think, rather than sit and have a predictable and (for the most part) plagerised storyline dictated to them whilst they drink their beers and shoot up their ceilings to the sound of ""yee ha's!"" will get axed.

moral of the story: if you want ratings, forget a plotline, forget characters you can relate to, - just get lots of people being shot for no apparent reason, there you have an instant american success.

when i found out Boomtown had been axed, i cant say i was particularly suprised, though i was highly dissapointed. it follows the historical traits of american tv, that it simply was, too interlectual, to powerful, 30people an episode didn't die for the sake of some blood on the screen. you could even say, it was too good.

it astounds me that the very same country that is willing to churn out the same repetetive bs for my viewing displeasure, are willing to axe such an incomprehendably unique and exciting series after just 1 series.

1510295,4,B00005JMMT,"The opening theme music is one of the most incredible 30-second snippets of emotion that I've ever heard, even though it's not incredibly complicated. I've been playing the DVD title menu through my speakers with the video off, and enjoy as it repeats continuously.

As a guitar player and songwriter, I fantasize about writing and arranging such a soul-stirring piece. Makes me wish that a soundtrack would come out, with an extended version of the theme.

As for program content, oftentimes I felt an adrenalin ""chill"" going down my spine, because something really hit home in the episode.

The marketing for this show/DVD was sadly negligible.  I decided to take a chance on it (having never seen an episode), because the price was right ($18)...  I've also slowly but surely trusted Donnie Wahlberg over the years to choose quality scripts to act in.  I would have gladly paid full-price for it, if only for the music!",1113696000,10,922,4.878205128205129
1510296,3,B00005JMMT,"Boomtown, starring Donnie Wahlberg, Mykelti Williamson and Neal McDonough, was a terrific, energetic and inventive show in which the stories were told from several different, often conflicting, points of view: the cops, the victims, the perps, the justice system, the press, the trauma units. The clever cutting and intercutting of scenes to produce one coherent storyline, the layered characters, and the usually excellent stories themselves, all combined for a really good, high-quality hour of television. When a show like this goes under I just shake my head. The need for instant rating successes crushes too many good shows too soon, and this was one of them. Well worth the time to get acquainted with this all-too short television series. You'll be sad when you view the final disc and there aren't any more. I place this show on a level with Third Watch, perhaps a cut below but not more than that. Third Watch, which ends this year after six seasons, deserves four stars from me, and The Shield, the benchmark cop show by which all others are measured, gets five. Three strong stars, maybe three and a half, for this very original hour of television. Just take a look at disc one and judge for yourself.",1113609600,10,1213,4.8647342995169085
1510297,5,B00005JMMT,"I don't write many reviews but on occassion a product or show comes around that I think deserves mention. There would never be any shortage of comments for a mainstream show like ""Friends"" or a movie like ""Titanic"" but sometimes a good show flies by almost under the radar that deserves some mention. Boomtown is one such show. Working at an NBC affiliate, this show was one of less than a handfull of shows that I actually looked forward to putting on the air. I never expected to see it released and for a bargain price of around $17 you can't go wrong.

I guarantee you've never seen a show like it. The ""seen from every side"" storytelling approach was a fresh and very effective concept. This show is certainly not your normal cop show. The characters were human- with flaws and weaknesses - not superhuman bullet spraying heros like a lot of shows. Though the episode where Fearless has the gunfight at the motel is a little too exaggerated, the rest of the show is pretty darn good and some of it is truly excellent. It sucks the viewer into it and you can sort of feel what is going on. Like someone else posted, it's not vegetable viewing as you need to be alert so as to figure out what is going on.

I recommend this show. NBC dropped the ball again by cancelling this one.",1113264000,6,1283,4.38655462184874
1510298,5,B00005JMMT,"After watching the cancelled Boomtown (Season One) I really wondered why we even have an NBC (only for Jay Leno I guess). Boomtown was absolutely the best TV police drama I have ever seen (I got bored with 24 and The Shield etc). About halfway through, I felt completely drawn into the character's lives. The characters were ""real"". The stories were ""real"".  My favorites were, the last episode, the Fearless episode, and the David McNorris episode. Heck, they were all great. Poor NBC. Always in the ratings basement. Why not stick with a winner for once!",1109203200,20,556,4.791666666666667
1510443,5,B00005JMMT,"Whatever you think about ""Homicide"" getting cancelled, you at least have to acknowledge that the brass at NBC did right by it for as long as they could in the face of its poor ratings. The current realities of network television don't seem to allow for such such partisanship. Schematic cop shows (i.e., the ""Law & Order"" and ""CSI"" franchises) are easy to sell; something different, deeper -- better -- not so easy. Viewers prefer the realtive comfort of shows which, hoewever disturbing their content, resolve themselves neatly within the 60-minute time frame. And so NBC knocked off not only its best show since ""Homicide"" (which I argue was the finest drama in the history of the medium) but anyone's best show. The creative team behind ""Boomtown"" were determined to exploit the medium in refreshing ways. I hate that phrase ""It was too good to last"" but in this case, it seems to have been true. Too good for viewers, and much too good for the suits to recognize its unique virtues.",1109030400,50,986,4.738372093023256
1510444,5,B00005JMMT,"There was never a ""Very Special 'Boomtown'.""  There wasn't an extra-special guest-star or a retrospective show.  We didn't have to deal with a season-ending cliff-hanger and a season-opening lame resolution to the cliff-hanger.  We didn't see half a dozen ""Boomtown"" knockoffs on competing networks.

In a way, it's a good thing that this wonderful show never became a hit, because it ended up living its entire life under the radar of people who had the power to ruin it.  Instead, it died with dignity, of causes that had nothing to do with any frailty of its own.

The stories are brought to life in a way that's rare to see on television.  Heck, this show makes the city of Los Angeles a character--a feat that is attempted by a few but rarely ever acheived.  Characters are compelling and conflicted and magnetic.

Of course, the character who most draws you in is DDA McNorris.  You can't help but hate the guy.  You can't help but love the guy.  As Neal McDonough plays him, he has no concept of the fact that he's a character on television and is not supposed to be so cold.  I get the impression that Mr. McDonough, who does an excellent job, has never watched television in his life.  He plays up to us viewers, not down.  I hope he'll maintain that fresh aspect of his persona as, as I expect, he becomes a Big Star.

At the end of the season, we see McNorris facing his alcoholism.  In the ""Blackout"" episode, we see the denial/bargaining/etc that anyone who has faced a shot glass faces at some point in our lives.  Throughout the season, it's been working up to this.  Then McNorris faces his own version of the monster lurking under the bed.

The series was cancelled before we got to see too much of the new improved sober McNorris.  Good thing, in a way.  The show could certainly have been great for a few seasons, but this first season was relentless.

I'm not one for buying ""Season X of Y,"" but we're not likely to see ""Boomtown"" in syndication and I'm not so sure it will be on the menu when video-on-demand supplants DVDs.  I recommend this box set.  Look at it as a good movie that extends for 18 hours or so.",1105833600,11,2133,4.449612403100775
1510445,5,B00005JMMT,"I've never been in the habit of buying TV shows on DVD, mostly for the reason that there haven't been that many shows that I want to watch over and over.  There's been a recent change in my philosphy.  The first TV package I bought was the first season of THE SOPRANOS.  The second was the first two seasons of HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET.  I bought both of those used.  The third one I bought (and the first I was willing to pay the new price for) was Season One of BOOMTOWN.

I first caught BOOMTOWN while it was still airing on NBC and I instantly fell in love with it.  It was smartly written, had a stellar cast and used arguably the most innovative storytelling design ever thought up.  When I heard that the plug had been pulled, I literally felt like going to NBC headquarters and demanding that answers be given to my face.

For whatever reason, it was evident that NBC did not want this show.  I don't know if one of the actors made a remark about the mother of one of the network executives or if just wasn't pulling in the demographic that NBC wanted, but the writing on the wall came with season two's delayed start.  The horrible truth became apparent once BOOMTOWN was moved from Sundays to Fridays (if you want a drama to lose any possible chance of viewership, just move it to Friday nights).  For their part, the producers tried.  They brought in Vanessa Williams in hopes that her name would save the sinking ship, but I'm sure the suits at NBC had already made up their minds.  The ironic thing is that BOOMTOWN would fit in perfectly with the well-written dramas that all the studios are lusting over now (24, ALIAS, LOST).

My favorite character is Detective Smith, beautifully brought to life by Mykelti Williamson. The favorite episode ""The Freak"" just had me stunned for days.

NBC's decline this season seems just punishment.  Boomtown was everything that its network was not - bold, experimental, emotionally evocative and very smart.  It wasn't perfect; if you look carefully there are continuity mistakes to be found and some suspension of disbelief required to buy some of the scenarios, but it was always powerful and compelling drama.  One of the reasons that Boomtown's non-linear, somewhat schizophrenic format worked so well is that it actually brought the viewer deeply into each characters perspective.  Rather than dealing with a generic police procedural we got careful character development and arcs that extended through the entire season.  Each episode usually involved one main case seen from multiple points of view (made clear by chapter titles with the character's name) from main characters as well as criminals and victims.  Frequently these points of view intersect, showing the same scene through different eyes, displaying different elements (using filtered colors for the intersections).  By looking through their eyes we came to know these characters and by seeing them unfold and develop over tbe course of the season we came to care about them.  My persona favorites were the conflicted DDA David McNorris and the surprizingly wise Detective Bobby ""Fearless"" Smith.  David's decline throughout the season was particularly compelling, as self-loathing and alcoholism, caused this enourmously capable and idealistic man to spin out of control.  Fearless had most of the best action in the series (in more ways than one), but never let it be gratuitous or stupid.  So in short I can strongly recommend Boomtown to anyone who loves quality television.  My only regret is that if it lasted it might have climbed to even greater heights.",1104364800,5,2126,5.106936416184971

Boomtown was a wonderfully crafted show that demanded your attention from beginning to end.  After reading a few reviews, I think we all agree that the acting  was astounding, the writing and plots were thought provoking, and the direction and production was humbling.

If you love TV that makes you despise the interruption of commercials, makes you hang on every word in every scene, and stare dumbly at the screen when credits roll, Boomtown is the show for you.

I hope when the next `Boomtown' TV show surfaces, that we as a viewing audience, are up to the challenge of being entertained by such a brilliantly rare crafted gem.",1100736000,3,732,4.862903225806452

NBC was confused by what they had, and tried to make it a formulaic cop show in Season 2, when the first season was one of the most amazing seasons of television in the last 10 years.  Everyone who enjoys developed story lines, excellent acting, amazing writing and terrific camera work must check this show out.  After watching it, you will clearly understand why it didn't stand a chance on NBC.  Just another example of why NBC is a network in free fall.

When season two began, with Vanessa Williams cast to the forefront as the center character, the show was ruined. Ms. Williams is talented, but the entire scope of the show changed also. NBC should definitely re-evaluate their mistake and regenerate the show back to the same formula that worked so well during the first season. If this were to happen, hopefully they could also resurrect the characters with the same talented cast that they had during season one. Great group of actors!",1095897600,4,719,4.845528455284553
1510628,5,B00005JMMT,"""Boomtown,"" cancelled early in its second season by NBC, featured an intriguing, complicated premise and had the ambition to stage a different, twisted mystery to its audience every single week. Watching the first season DVDs, the scope of how ambitious and great ""Boomtown"" was - and perhaps why it didn't catch on quickly with viewers - becomes abundantly clear.

""Boomtown"" promised the story of a crime told from EVERY point of view. The uniformed officers on the scene, the detectives investigating the crime, the assistant DA handling it, the reporter covering it and the paramedic working it all were main characters. The episodes themselves were divided into segments, showcasing a different perspective. Because of this, occasionally the audience would find out larger details or hidden, personal motives that the characters wouldn't themselves discover. Also, because of this ""Rashomon""-inspired twist, a different member of the cast could end up at the center of every episode.

The cast, led by Donnie Wahlberg, Mykelti Williamson and the great Neal McDonough, was incredibly talented - particularly the supporting actor Gary Basaraba, who really ought to work more.

Though the episodes focused on a crime, the gimmick of ""Boomtown"" allowed the audience to glance into the twisted, complicated lives of its main characters, as well. So, in addition to showing an episode about a weird hit-and-run accident, the audience would get to see ADA David McNorris' alcoholic descent. While dealing with an episode on a drive-by shooting, the audience gets to experience wrenching moments from the character Fearless' scarred childhood. And while the other characters think Det. Joel Stevens leads a charmed life, the audience gets to see just how bad things are getting for him at home.

The premise worked more often than it didn't, and some episodes of ""Boomtown"" are better than others. My personal favorites were ""Coyote,"" which featured an odd crime scene; ""Reeling through the Years,"" featuring an investigation into a 1976 shooting; ""The David McNorris Show,"" featuring the ADA's spin-doctor work on a crime; and ""Fearless,"" the drive-by shooting episode that left me in tears by its end.

I'm not usually a fan of cop shows, but ""Boomtown"" is far from the usual cop show.",1094256000,36,2284,5.2465753424657535

Although I didn't enjoy season 2 as much as the first, I still believe that it was better than most anything else offered right now on network television.  Neal McDonough was equal parts frustrating and heartbreaking.  He is without a doubt an one of the most talented performers today and I, for one, will be watching his new show, Medical Investigation.  As a Donnie Wahlberg fan from NKOTB, one might think that I am a little biased but I am throughly impressed with his portrayal of Joel--virtually flawless.

'Boomtown' was nothing short of brilliant. The acting, direction, writing - superb. All of which, of course, happen to be the formula for instant tanking.

Why this series was not promoted like there was no tomorrow, I will never understand. But I suppose in an era of 'reality TV shows', anything of real substance falls by the wayside.

We shall have to be satisfied with the DVD release, though I do wonder if the 4 or whatever episodes from Season 2 will ever see the light of day in this format. They were aired in the wee hours of the morning where I am, and I was unable to catch them.

It was complex enough to hold your interest, but it never got confusing.
The actors they got for the roles were perfectly cast. From Neal McDonough and his excellent vocal prowes to Donnie Wahlberg's compassionate but Joel Stevens and his tandem Mykelti Williamson with the perfect nickname ""Fearless"" every actor brought their own edge to the roles.

Boomtown was something special and still is to the people who fell in love with the stories and characters.
NBC was STUPID for letting go of this amazing show. This DVD should also add Season 2 even though it wasn't as orginal as the first it still deserves to be on this DVD!

Not NBC, who brought the show back for a second season with Vanessa L. Williams - d'oh, and ""simpler"" storylines.  The first season of this show -- the only REAL season for fans of the show -- is a tour de force.
Donnie Wahlberg finally put that boys' band completely behind him, as you watched his Detective Joel Steven put back together his life and career.  Neal McDonough here is playing one of the most richly-drawn a**holes in the history of the electronic media.  And Mykelti Williamson's Fearless is why Noir is not dead.  We still need to know people like this, and Mr. Williamson shows us more in a moment of silence than many can demonstrate with an entire soliloquy.
Gary Basaraba, Lana Parilla, Nina Garbiras and Jason Gedrick all created indelible, complex, human characters.  Characters that I grew to care about and really enjoy seeing.
I can only hope the folks at NBC don't put out season 2 (all 6 lousy episodes).  I can best describe it as saying we went from M*A*S*H to After M*A*S*H.  Hollow, poorly written with Ms. Williams (to her credit a performer hideously miscast here) deconstructing all that had come before.
So my recommendation is to BUY season 1 and FORGO season 2.",1085616000,7,1468,4.680933852140078
1510823,5,B00005JMMT,"I'd say a lot more about NBC, but I don't want to be sued for slander. Suffice it to say that the day they canceled this show after only two airings in the TV-graveyard of Friday nights, I promised to never watch any new NBC drama again. This was one of the most well written dramas i have ever seen, with characters that really carried the series. It wasn't just a situation drama, the protagonists were flawed and human yet still larger than life. I am happy to see that it's coming out on DVD and I'm more than willing to pay up for it (and I don't usually buy TV shows on DVD). Hopefully DVD can do for ""Boomtown"" what it has done for ""Family Guy""; resurrect it back for a new season in the future.

If you want to see good quality TV, watch this show. No one will ever remember ""Lyon's Den"" which killed it, or ""Kingpin"" which NBC tried to replace it with; but this show and NBC's shoddy treatment of it will be remembered as long as television exists.

I just wanted to say that I don't think Vanessa Williams ruined the show. I was willing to give it a chance and see where it would go from there, they never got a chance to focus an episode on her and it's only because NBC put her on at the same time that they forced the writers to be more ""procedural"" that we may think she brought the show down.

Me, i'm just smiling at NBC's predicament now, what with Lost and Desparate Housewives bringing intelligent and gripping TV back to us and them wallowing in last place with not one critical or ratings hit in site. Ah, Karma is a female dog...

As of April 4 2006, the only new NBC show I have watched is My Name Is Earl, and NBC still refuses to do the intelligent thing by teaming it up with Scrubs.

The cast is superb. Mykelti Williamson's ""Fearless"" is quirky and complex (he is probably best known for his role as Bubba in Forrest Gump).  Neal McDonough is superb as the uptight, upright, yet slightly out-of-control ADA David McNorris.  Jason Gedrick, Lana Parrilla, Nina Garbiras, Donnie Wahlberg, and Gary Basaraba round out an ensemble cast, painting rich portraits of people with stressful jobs and personal lives.
The photography and ""graphic look"" of the show are innovative, and the ""multiple perspective"" aspect of the plot exposition is clever and eye-opening.  There are surprising plot twists at every turn.
There are some interesting guest appearances, as well.  Patricia Wettig from Thirty-Something does a great job as a Patty Hearst-like former terrorist.
It is a sad commentary on our American culture that shows like this do not succeed while tons of pathetic, identical sewage pour from the screen daily.

It's hip, funny, tragic and brilliant. . .all at the same time.

A crime occurs at the onset, and as the episode unfolds,  we see different perspectives as to what actually happened.
No stone is left unturned.
It's a structure originally employed in the Akira Kurosawa classic Rashomon.
The difference being that in this instance, all the perspectives agree.

Repeated viewings in where Boomtown really shines.  You'll pick up elements previously missed.
Each episode is a fully realized, well-crafted story.

As with any decent show, you'll become intimately acquainted with each character.
It's an ensemble piece at its finest, and the cast is stellar and compelling:
Donnie Wahlberg, Neal McDonough, Gary Basaraba, Mykelti Williamson, Jason Gedric, Nina Garbiras, Lana Parrilla

There's no accounting for the public's taste.
A work of art like this died a quick death after an all too brief tenure (while mindless reality shows last for years...go figure).
Only 24 episodes in total (18 in the first season, 6 in the second) were produced.

The show's creator, Graham Yost said: ""Boomtown was perhaps, in retrospect, better suited for HBO or FX. But at that time, HBO had The Wire, and FX had The Shield.
So NBC was really the only place for it.""
