8195297,5,B000QB4PZO,"I loved the performance by Andrea Bocelli.  The orchestra were well rehearsed and performed with excellence.  The guests appearing with Bocelli were also spectacular.  His DVD's are always a pleasure to watch.  Behind the scenes is always something I enjoy watching.  Bravo.  Just a thought I would suggest getting this performance on DVD, not everyone still has a VHS tape player.  I would have preferred to buy a disc instead of the tape.",1326672000,2,440,4.945205479452055
8195298,5,B000QB4PZO,"I was at the concert - it was a belated Mother's Day gift to my mother. After a week of very hot temperatures, that night was delightfully cool. A perfect evening. The selections, the voices were all superb. I was beyond thrilled when he surprised the audience bringing out Sarah Brightman. But the real co-star of the evening was the World Trade Center towers standing so beautifully in the background, lit up, looking so majestic.  I can't watch this concert without crying because I worked in the World Trade Center - I was there on 9/11.",1279929600,8,541,4.635416666666667
8195299,5,B000QB4PZO,"This concert was filmed in front of the New York Skyline. The Twin Towers are seen throughout the concert, both late afternoon/evening and after dark. Mr Bocelli is in top performance mode, along with soprano Ana Maria Martinez. The surprise, though, is when Sarah Brightman sings her songs toward the end of the concert. None of the 12,000 concert goers knew she would perform as a special guest. The concert gets a late start as the concert celebrates Italian immigration with a 15 minute look at Ellis Island. I would highly recomend this VHS production from PBS.",1259280000,4,566,4.845360824742268
