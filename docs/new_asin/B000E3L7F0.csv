2486779,5,B000E3L7F0,"By far, the best series on TV in a long time (since Season 1 of the Sopranos)!  Hope they release a DVD of season 1 soon!",1129507200,2,121,3.6538461538461537
2486780,5,B000E3L7F0,"Somebody kept using the past tense in their review. Huff IS still on the air, though was almost cancelled (I think) but it is going to start sooner than expected, and got a grant of more episodes then they asked for, as far as I know.

Now, I am a person who, as a whole HATES psychiatrists, so I was reluctant to watch this, but I did, and I think this show is one of the greatest on TV. They chose a great cast, and the plots are superb. The episode, left me, like it did many viewers, on the edge of my seat (it shocked me quite a bit). It premieres in four days (Wedensday, August 24th), in case somebody needs to know.",1124496000,3,623,4.024193548387097
2486781,5,B000E3L7F0,"Huff is sensational. TV  at it's very best. The actors  are incredible ( Oliver Platt's, Hank Azaria's & Blythe Danner's characters are totally riveting).  Since the other reviewers already gave a perfect synopsis I have little to add. Other than to emphasise - watch it. You'll like it. A LOT.",1121904000,4,294,4.84
2486782,5,B000E3L7F0,"Bereft of any promotion, Huff crept unnoticed into the UK, via a new and little known satellite channel called FX. I took a gamble and was spellbound from Episode 1. Emotionally it's an extreme experience. I can't think of a series so capable of generating side-splitting laughter one minute and under-the-cushion tension the next - not forgetting all-too-frequent bouts of genuine tears. To achieve this in a cynical, stiff-upper-lip English household is no small achievement. Typically, from this UK perspective - much U.S. material is either heavy-handed with sentiment or transparently hesitant when it comes to controversial issues. Huff is not. Beautiful writing, incredible characterisation, tremendous acting, Huff is a work of genius on the part of everyone involved. I shall be buying the DVD set of Series One for my friends and I can't wait for a Series II. I just wish Russell was for real and my best friend. But then - fortunately - I have a son more than a little like Bird....",1115251200,11,993,4.9879518072289155

2486788,5,B000E3L7F0,Huff is an overlooked Showtime series from 2004-2006. I first started watching back in 2004 when I first got digital cable and Showtime for the first time. Hank Azaria and Pagett Brewster give outstanding performances as a married couple raising a son (Anton Yelchin) while dealing with their own inner mental illness problems. Huff is a big name psychiatrist in an affluent California area who takes on the zaniest mental clients you'll see on any television series. Lara Flynn Boyle gives a standout performance as a bipolar wild woman who stalks Huff and and his family. This series was cancelled after it's second season because of low ratings which is a shame because Showtime really could have used another good series besides Weeds.,1407024000,,739,5.016260162601626
2486789,1,B000E3L7F0,"Huff was the worst show I have watched - ever!  It was morbid and ludicrous. Every episode left me depressed and thinking I needed a shrink!  This series won an Emmy?????  I purchased it to see more of P. Brewster's work.  I was appalled when week after week she was the sex robot with stupid lines. The writers should have saved us all the agony and had the title character jump off a building after episode 3.  Who doesn't move when a psychotic woman attacks your wife??  He is going to give up his family to care for the psycho?  That makes him stupid AND unbelievable.  And that Mother - I'd have stabbed her with a fork after episode 2.

Although the premises and plots were truly horrid, Lara Flynn Boyle does some of the best acting of her career.  But this does not make the series worth watching.

I'm not even worried about buying the poorly made Season 2 - they can keep it.  Huff SUCKS!!!",1398816000,,900,4.323353293413174
2486790,5,B000E3L7F0,"I confess. I never watch TV situation series. I hate commercials and don't need to watch or care who is dating whom. I saw that Anton Yelchin was in this series and bought it, and without commercials, I enjoyed it all. Anton, as I have said a million times, is an actor to watch. I heard he is co-starring in a new picture. It was in the Los Angeles paper. Good for him. He started young like Brad Renfro, even younger than Brad. He co-starred in FRIGHT NIGHT with Colin Farrell. He has been with major stars in most of his films. I enjoyed HUFF, but I won't buy anymore TV series. Unlike movies, once you watch a series, you never have to watch it again. Movies I can watch over and over and over.",1397433600,,698,4.177777777777778

2486792,5,B000E3L7F0,"My love for this show, knows no bounds. It was amazing. The acting was incredible, the cast was one of the best ever assembled, the writing was solid. It was just a great show and I will be angry at Showtime for many years to come for not giving it a third season and for not putting Season Two on DVD. Though, to be fair, Paget Brewster (Beth) did go on to greatly improve Criminal Minds, which would not have happened if this show had gotten season three. There wasn't one thing I didn't love about this show, even when it was incredibly painful, it was still not to be missed.",1391040000,,579,4.225225225225225

It truly is a shame that this show got canceled.  It's hilarious, well-acted, and sexy!  It stars Hank Azaria (who also produced) (""The Simpsons"", ""Godzilla""), Paget Brewster (""Criminal Minds"", ""The Big Bad Swim""), Anton Yelchin (""Criminal Minds""), Oliver Platt (""Lake Placid""), Blythe Danner, Andy Comeau (""Criminal Minds""), and Lara Flynn Boyle (""Amerika"", ""Men In Black 2"").

But both my wife and I just felt like we were trying to like this as kept watching into about 8-9 episodes. The star actor has definitely got game. You would never recognize this talented actor (the psychiatrist) as the flaming gay butler that works for Robin Williams in The Bird Cage. Yep, that's him. Wild eh. The neg's on this series are the pscy's wining son who has a negative personality and voice that brings you down. And his mother is negative black cloud too. Did not like it.

2486801,5,B000E3L7F0,"Great cast, great story line, great show.  HBO should have made six seasons!  This is one of my favorite shows on TV.  The cast has great chemistry.",1363564800,,148,4.407407407407407
2486802,4,B000E3L7F0,"Huff is a jaded psychiatrist who pays the ultimate price of not paying attention to his patient, who has come in for an emergency session, in his rush to get to his next appointment. He basically contradicts the reason for his patient's emergency, despite the patient's jittery behavior and the seriousness of the event he came in for. Huff doesn't go in for counseling himself after this, nor supervision, and at times his psychiatry seems a little out of whack compared to the real world. However, later in the 1st season his interactions with his patients seemed more realistic (at least, for a decent therapist).

However, he continually dumps his problems on his brother Teddy. The description of the show says he is the caretaker, which he is, but he often lets his son and brother take up the slack as well. His brother is schizophrenic, and half the time in the 1st season Huff shows up to vent his problems to him-- as if Teddy didn't have enough! At one point Teddy is having a ""good day"" for him-- he is able to tolerate watching TV with other patients-- and Huff shows up to lay a bombshell on him about their parents and in particular their dad, with no thought to how it affects anyone but himself. Teddy promptly has an episode and has to be sedated.

Add to all this that Huff is repeatedly referred to as ""brilliant"" (and openly attributes his son's academic success to his genes-- as if his wife weren't intelligent, geez), his ego fluffed, and it would have been amazing if he wasn't a self-centered rich male in Los Angeles purchasing Italian designer products at lunch and rationalizing straying just because being present in his marriage is stressful when his wife, for once, needs to take care of someone else.

I can see why in the 2nd season Huff starts off in therapy, finally! Knowing this I am willing to take on the 2nd season, as Huff was starting to feel more like an anti-hero.

His wife seems a little too stereotypically distracted at times, rushing in and out with her party planning, and at one point when her planner is knocked to the ground while she is on her phone she says dramatically that her ""whole life"" is in there. Well, even then she could have computerized some of the stuff, but whatever. The moments when her character really shines are when she is faced with conflict head-on, such as when the couple find out their son has attended an inappropriate party, or when she gives it to Huff for projecting his issues on her (prior to a rather large revelation on his part, mind you). Her no-nonsense, blunt dialogue seems true to life for a good natured mother who nonetheless has quite a mouth.

I'm not sure why someone else referred to this show as an example of emasculation-- unless it is to mean that subtextual chauvinism is put up to the microscope and not let off the hook.

The mother is at first frustratingly narcissistic, but her humane side shows through when she deals with her grandson's lack of attentive parents by standing in as a parental figure at major moments, and when she deals with her best friend's stroke.

Huff Season 1 ends with Huff locking horns with his best friend, but it's no surprise since his friend is equally self-involved and has started to pay the price in his own life recently as well. While the two go at each other, Teddy takes off, Huff accidentally injures his friend, and his poor wife and mother-in-law (who are supposed to be taking the mom home to die peacefully) have to see all this. I can't blame Teddy for driving off-- I would too.",1361059200,,3535,4.575039494470774
2486803,5,B000E3L7F0,"I bought this season solely on the fact that Paget Brewster was on the show; but then, I saw how genius the show was and why it was so critically acclaimed. Paget, Hank, Blythe, Oliver, and Anton are all spectacular (not to mention the wonderful guest stars: including Swoosie Kurtz and Annie Potts, among others. The mental illness aspect of it was also a reason I bought this, because it's extremely captivating! Waiting for the season 2 DVD!",1357776000,2,444,4.705128205128205

Never have I been hooked so thoroughly and so quickly by a new ensemble of dramedy giants. Huff & his wife Beth invite you right in to one of the rawest, most real depiction of a TV marriage. It's sexy, heartbreaking and hilarious. Great scripts and spot-on casting. Where are they now?",1355702400,,391,4.850746268656716
2486807,4,B000E3L7F0,"Huff is a refrehsingly warm where you want it warm, funny when you want it funny and thoughtful where you want it thoughtful series. Azaria is remarkably comfortable in this role - one which steals (and eats) the lunch of Gabriel Bryne's character in ""In Treatment"" which is painful to watch.

Oliver Platt gives Jeremy Piven a run for his money as a sidekick and the always hotter-than-her-daughter Blythe Danner is delightfully inappropriate. Quirky without jamming it down your throat and well-written, I'm anticipating an enjoyable marathon session of watching Season 2. (Skip the Special Features...it's a big schmooze fest!)",1339632000,,630,5.3

Things get complicated for Huff with every episode, and still he manages to keep a stiff upper lip and forges headlong into every misfortune the writers of the show can come up with. Huff, in a nutshell is a Psychologist whose family is indirectly torn apart by an unfortunate suicide in Huff's office. As you might guess, Huff also plays confessor to his family and friends, which can be awkward, but also highly entertaining.

I look forward to the 2nd season someday!

It starts off good and then gets its footing and ends up great.  The last episode is as good a show as any television can ask for.  One problem is that hampers the show is the two major characters, the husband and wife, who are dour and always arguing with each other.  The hostility is great enough to question the bond with each other.  As the creators of the show point out in their commentary, the tension is that Huff puts his work and clients above his wife and child in a way that promotes the wife's hostility.  The grandmothers are often left to raise the son and promote his development into adulthood.  It definitely can happen in real life but doesn't endear the husband and wife to the audience.  The major contributions on the show are left to terrific actors who play the character roles .  They are wonderful and have great parts to play.  By the end of the season, the show suddenly hits its stride and the last episode is perfection.  Nice show, gone too soon and without an second season DVD.",1266192000,2,1158,4.457142857142857
2486815,4,B000E3L7F0,"After viewing Season 1 Disc 1, I've concluded that this series is not quite as good as ""In Treatment"". This is mainly due to intermittent lapses of reality (into the surreal) which detract from the overall dynamic.  Nevertheless, you can see that this series is comprised of a better than average storyline and acting.  In fact, entertaining characters abound.  Also worthwhile is the creative photography--especially the wide sweep segues from one scene to the next.  Recommended.",1246492800,2,481,5.2894736842105265

2486825,5,B000E3L7F0,"I watched the first episode right after I bought ""Huff"".  I found it very dark and kind of depressing.  Of course, I LOVED Blythe Danner as Huff's mother--she's the main reason I wanted to see the show--and she definitely deserved her two Emmy Awards for her wonderful performance as a woman who hides her pain with a sharp tongue.  It's worth watching ""Huff"" just for Ms. Danner.  Then a few months ago I decided to sit down and watch the second episode, which I enjoyed a lot more than the first.  Then I watched a third and a fourth episode--and I fell in love with the series and all of the memorable characters: Hank Azaria as Huff has never been better, Paget Brewster as Huff's wife Beth is letter perfect, Anton Yelchin is terrific as Huff's teenage son (his relationship with the girl he tutors is a riot), Andy Comeau is quietly effective in his brief appearances in each episode as Huff's troubled brother, and Oliver Platt is outrageous and quite touching as Huff's best friend, Russel.  Even the smaller roles are expertly cast with excellent actors, including Kimberly Brooks as Huff's no-nonsense office manager, Liza Lapira as Russel's no-nonsense secretary and Faith Prince as Kelly Knippers, whom Russel becomes involved with--all three of these women are outstanding! The only character I didn't care for was the Homeless Hungarian--I just didn't think he was necessary--and, fortunately, he's not around much in the later episodes.  With the first season ending on a doozy of a cliffhanger, I eagerly await the second season to arrive on DVD.  I have a frustrated feeling that I'll be waiting a long time for this, since I don't think Sony is in any rush to release ""Huff's"" second season on DVD.  ""Huff"" is a show that will grow on you--it sneaks up on you and forces you to love it.  Oh, and I almost forgot about one of my favorite actresses--Swoosie Kurtz, who plays Beth's ill mother--another great performance.  ""Huff"" is overflowing with greatness in all departments.  Is that high enough praise for you?  Rent it, buy it, steal it--do whatever it takes to watch one of the best shows I've seen in a long time.",1189382400,,2137,4.743243243243243

Where other TV shows falter with their ridiculous scripts and sub-average acting, Huff is a quiet achiever with outstanding dialogue and characters. After each episode, you feel satisfied having watched one of the best, most rewarding shows on TV, if not the best.

Dr Craig Huffstodt is pyschiatrist who is possibly a little jaded with both his clients and the world, until a 15-year-old patient of his, Sam, commits suicide in his office. The event shakes up Huff's existence and the show explores how he deals with the tragedy, and with the everyday dramas involving his often aggresive wife, Beth (Paget Brewster), precocious son, Byrd (Anton Yelchin), intrusive mother, Izzy (Blythe Danner) and schizophrenic brother, Teddy (Andy Comeau). Not to mention his old friend, Russell, a boozing, cocaine-snorting and hilarious lawyer brilliantly played by Oliver Platt. And, of course, Hank Azaria in the title role is perfect.

2486838,5,B000E3L7F0,"This show prides itself on presenting characters who not only speak their minds but also articulate their feelings with courageous (or sometimes catty) candor.  This makes the program compelling and endearing, if not quite true-to-life.  It's rather like the best of Bergman's b&w '60s dramas, which for me resembled O'Neill's STRANGE INTERLUDE:  people voicing non-communication in a language not familiar to me, while their actual thoughts were spelled out at the bottom of the screen.  Surely few Americans could expose their thoughts in such spoken frankness, I imagined back then.

An advantage of this narrative method is that we become engaged in the characters at several complex levels; hence the compelling nature of the series as a whole.  It's also nice to see that a creative force behind THIRTY SOMETHING before this HUFF project has grown up enough to treat elders as something more complicated than the shrill dufuss parents who got blamed so often for the main characters' problems.  The commentary says they wanted Huff's in-laws to illustrate a good marriage, but they couldn't resist replaying the ""parents' affairs in the past"" card that had cropped up with Mel's ""good marriage parents"" in the anniversary episode.  In any case, it's nice to see Blythe's bridge friends aren't dismissed as a coven of geese.

The series prides itself in dodging cliches--mid-life crisis affairs being one that threatened to flirt with predictability but pulled out in time.  The brainy son is involved in another minor plot knot of this nature, about peer pressure; it, too, is resolved in a surprising and pleasing way, though one might expect some sort of mean-spirited retribution from the other kids.  Frankly glad not to see them again, but they were a dark force that could make for an unpleasant plot development.

The yin and yang of the series are Huff the Compassionate (to a fault) and his best friend, the master of self-destruction and amoral pragmatism (is it redundant to say he's an attorney?).  The in-our-face intimacy with this jerk (including toilet paper use) is sometimes hard to take, raising in me at least the same queasiness I felt with the gamblers' impulsiveness in Altman's CALIFORNIA SPLIT.  By the last few episodes, however, these plot points appear less arbitrarily sensationalistic.

And by the time one reaches those last three programs, admiration and caring have been established for the bitchy mother, her institutionalized son, even the ever-skeletal Ms. Doyle (who never looked more beautiful and genuinely vulnerable than in her final un-mascara'ed scenes), and the entirety of the climactic final episode.

It's more frantic by about a half-turn, and resembles the straight-faced, literary social satire in minitature of Philip Roth or Don DeLillo.  Huff is the narcissistic center among a hurrican of impressionistic semi-characatures.  There's more going on here than meets the eye.

Since the therapist hears it ""all"" everyday, eight-hours a day minus summer vacation, it is little wonder these poor shrinks don't spend a lot of time on the couch themselves.  Well, they do, analyzing each other.

Family dynamics being what they are since the cave dweller, the hearth is a sticky, messy cesspool of perverseness all submerged into what the great one, S. Freud, called the unconscious.  Bubbling to the surface, these sensual desires take hold in perversions and in some cases, love of animals or inanimate objects.  Well, anyhow, the shrink sorts this all out as Huff does admirably. Huff's brain compartmentalizes the woes of the world and tends to his wife and teen kid, till a patient, a troubled, gay teen, blows his brains out during a session. Now we're on to episodic scenes of spiritual desperation.

2486857,4,B000E3L7F0,"...which is to say, that ""real life"" is anything but.  I love the disconnected feel of this show.  To me, it's how most of us live.  We have our connections, our family, our work, our friends, even our secret selves.  We travel in these circles and overlap them here and there.  Sometimes the overlap causes tumult (Russell coming into work completely fried or Teddy escaping and causing Huff to have to deal with him in real time), but we usually manage to keep the little boxes in a row.

I've also lived in Los Angeles and love how accurately life there is portrayed.  The spectre of the Huffstodt's family home in Pasadena being abandoned because of the family turmoil that happened there (no spoilers from me!) makes me picture driving down Orange Grove Boulevard and wondering just where Teddy and Craig used to ride their bikes.  Huff and Beth have moved to Brentwood, living what appears to be the ""good life"" of the successful psychiatrist and his family.  They arrange wonderful weekends at Shutters, they walk the dog down to the Santa Monica Pier, they ""dive it"" into the little clubs that abound.  That dichotomy is part of what Los Angeles is about.

I am so sad that the show has been cancelled.  The only reason I didn't give this a 5 is because of the over-the-topness of some of the scenes with Russell and his drug and sex abuse.  Yes, it could be spot on, but the juxtaposition of that lifestyle with a responsible career scares the beejesus out of me.

2486862,4,B000E3L7F0,"Huff is another shining example of why cable television is better than regular.  The first day we meet psychiatrist Craig Hufstodt, known as Huff to his friends, a teenage patient shoots himself in Huff's office.  Stricken and guilt-ridden Huff turns to his family's support to get him through this troubled time.  Huff's family is composed of his wife Beth, a party planner who seems more concerned with her career than her family, his mother Izzy (played by the always excellent Blythe Danner) who lives with him and his wife and whose antagonistic relationship with Beth is reason enough to watch the show, and his son Byrd, who Huff accurately describes as ""14 going on 40.""  Rounding out his support system are his best friend and lawyer Russell (played by Oliver Platt in an increasingly over the top and hysterical fashion) who is a misogynist with a drug, booze and debauchery problem, and his brother Teddy, a schizophrenic mental patient who Huff often visits.

This show is full of twists and turns and you never quite know what's going to happen next.  It leaves you wondering what the significance is of the homeless Hungarian man who seems to appear as if from nowhere and wondering if Huff will ever get his life sorted out.  Platt and Danner shine in their supporting roles and I've never seen finer work from Hank Azaria than in his role as Huff. Others to look out for: Lara Flynn Boyle as a manic depressive patient who goes over the edge and Swoosie Kurtz as Beth's mother.

2486864,2,B000E3L7F0,"I used to think that actors that could not succeed in cinema would inevitably find their way, by choice or otherwise, into the television circuit.  As a viewer of mainstream awards shows, I would sometimes snicker at the sight of a once strong film actor attempting to gain recognition for his work in a short-lived television series.  It felt like a dog settling for a plastic bone when the real, juicy bone was within walking distance.  I used to feel as if it was an opportunity for actors to work without really trying.  Well, it is with my greatest delight that I announce to the world that I disown that thought.  With the birth of such programming like Sopranos, Six Feet Under, and Lost television has become an incubator for both newly discovered actors to gain popularity, while bigger, sometimes seasoned actors to redefine their acting ""chops"".  As cinemas scratch their heads surrounding recent attendance records, television seems to be upping their profile to bring interesting, provocative, and creative programming to the masses.  We, as viewers, are staying at home instead of spending at the theaters because we can see stronger performances, developed stories, and power characters while sitting on the comfort of our own couch ... so why bother going out?

Recently, my wife and I had the opportunity to enjoy the first season of Huff without paying for the high price of cable.  I had heard the critic's citations surrounding the program and their boasts of amazing acting by both Hank Azaria and Blythe Danner.  I had to see the hype.  A psychiatrist evaluating his own life while attempting to save those that he treats.  It seemed like a refreshing concept.  Alas, much to my dismay, and to the disagreement of my wife, I didn't see sed hype.  What I instead witnessed were complex characters surrounded by choppy stories that seemed to jump from one tangent island to the next without any map in sight, misguided characters that used unbelievable ""real-life"" situations to gain support, ""After School Special"" acting that proved $15 can buy you fame, and just a sprinkle of jaw-dropping characters that created just enough addiction to keep you watching to the last show.  Obviously ""borrowing"" from its competitor's ideas and strengths, Huff felt like a collage of every other drama-based television program on the market.  Instead of being original, it ""borrowed"" ideas from other shows and attempted to sell us on its own originality.  Showtime, the television station, ""borrowed"" the psychologist idea from Sopranos and the insane brother from Six Feet Under, and mixed it all together to get this mediocre (at best) show.

As I fell pray to the ounce of addiction that Huff allowed, I found myself bored with most episodes, anxiously waiting for scenes that involved two side characters, and a bit insane myself with the amount of filler that was used to overcompensate for the lack of story in each 45+ minute long episode.  Again, kudos for small level of addiction that forced me to watch this series to the un-dramatic cliff-hanger of an ending, but overall this first season for Huff isn't as great as the critics seem to think.  Azaria's ""Huff"" is shallow, slow, and obviously blind to the fact that the real insanity lurks around his family, not just in the comfort of his pricey office.  His wife, Beth, who feels like she rehearsed for the scene in just an hour while applying her own make-up, accompanies him adding enough to question her own sanity through the show.  Their child, Byrd, could possibly be the only ""strong"" adult in the house, but we are unable to appreciate him because we are too consumed with Huff's conflicts.  The writers throw in meaningless banter between him and his short-time girlfriend Gail only to add to the drama.  Huff's mother, Izzy, played by Blythe Danner is powerful enough that she overshadows everyone else in this series ... except for one.  If I could say one thing positive about this program is Oliver Platt.  He, and only he, brings this series to life.  It is his character that continued to draw me into watching each episode back to back to back.  He has a spark that nobody else in the series could match and only proves my point that television is giving a larger medium for decent actors to show us their true talents.  For anyone wanting to watch this first season, Oliver Platt is electrifying.

Overall, I just felt a bit used with this series.  I felt as if the drama was put in place to fill the time, not because of character faults or circumstances.  Azaria is decent, but Danner and Platt cannot be matched.  Without these two, this would be a quickly failed series.  As I watched each episode, it became clear that resolutions were not being made, issues were not being resolved (but instead forgotten until later episodes), clich?s were being drawn, and what started as possible originality, actually felt nothing more than reused newspaper.  While my wife seemed captivated by the surroundings, I felt tired with the yelling, the screaming, the constant breaking of dishes, and the repetitive structure of the show.  Huff had opportunities to break free and become a stronger, independent program, but instead it played it safe.  It never quite explored ""darkened"" territory, but felt comfortable staying well within the lines.  I was disappointed with Huff because it did not take stronger chances, but more importantly, because it painted a obscured picture of reality.  This never felt honest, but instead glossy and primitive.

Watch it twice, shame on me.

I'd heard so many good things about it, and I know it's been an Emmy nominee for various reasons so I went ahead and ordered it since in Australia we don't get it (only got it in the last week around midnight showing).

Hank Azaria is great as I thought he might be as the lead as a psychiatrist Dr. Craig 'Huff' Huffstodt.  That's basically what the show centers around - his work life (where he is dealing with a patients suicide), his family life (great wife, interfering mother, turbulent teen son) and his own feelings about all of the above.

This is a funny show, serious and moving.  I really recommend it if you are a fan of a darker comedy with great story lines.  To be honest, I cannot stand his friend who is played by Oliver Platt.  He is the only negative for me.  He is arrogant and cocky, but the other characters are fantastic (especially Blythe Danner - Huff's mother).",1145232000,12,958,4.367231638418079

Also, I was looking forward to watching Hank Azaria the serious actor, not just the funny voice. There's just something about this guy that I wanna see: a talented guy (obviously), with a lot of humanity and intelligence enclosed in dark brown eyes. Cut short: I wanted to love this show.

What a huge disappointment that pilot was, let me tell you - and later episodes confirmed it. If anyone compares ""Huff"" to ""The Sopranos"" or ""Arrested Development"", please - that's such an insult to those fine shows. The main problem is poor writing. Badly researched, over the top incidients, unbelievable responses in the protagonists, whom, by the way are shallow, uninspired and largely unredeeming. The premise of the show is that people who need therapy (mostly attractive young girls) are ridiculous, amoral people whose greatest desire is to annoy the protagonist. Violent things that happen to people around you are of less importance than your own, smaller obsessions. The main protagonist is a ""good man"" and a push-over who lets his psycho  mother stay in his house even though it drives his wife insane.

Additionally, I have rarely been sickened by the humour of a show as frequently as I was, watching this gunk. Huff's lawyer is suppposed to be the comic relief, contrasting Huffs serious- shrink-midlife-crisis-persona. This man is a repulsing excuse for a man, believably played by Platt. I don't mind a little sex and violence and cynical humour, believe me. I don't shock easily but this was way too much information, too graphic. An example of humour: one day after having watched his patient blow his brains out in front of him, he's joking about wheter the skull fragments are still lodged in his office wall, this while canoodling carelessly with his wife. Wow, priceless. I could go on about how horrificly in bad taste the ""humour"" in this show was. Even as the episodes moved on, nothing got better. I love dark shows, Sopranos is one of them, and things got pretty nasty in New Jersey at times, but I loved every minute of it. Why? It was well written. Here - not even the sleek, expensive production, nor the great performance by Platt especially, can redeem this garbage. The cast deserve  far better, they did great with what material they had.

I'm sad to say: ""Huff"" is a boring, repulsing, unoriginal, mish-mash, a stupid, insulting drag. Hope they cancel the show and that Azaria finds something more worthwhile to work in.

Bring on season 2.,1142899200,59,465,4.411764705882353
2486870,5,B000E3L7F0,"Whenever people talk about the great shows pay cable has to offer, they always talk about HBO. Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Sex and the City, Deadwood... Showtime never gets a mention, despite such great and innovative programs such as Dead Like Me, Jeremiah and now: Huff.

With Huff, like all their shows, Showtime manages to make a show with conflicted, real characters without resorting to graphic sex or violence. The language is still as harsh as ever, but it's nothing you probably wouldn't hear in the course of a day if you were in these situations.

Even if HBO gets all the press for their sex and violence, Showtime has another winner with Huff. Great stories, wonderfully real characters who - gasp! - make mistakes, amazing acting... Craig Huffstodt and Hank Azaria are two different people who happen to look and sound a lot alike, I must say. Paget Brewster is completely believable as the harried housewife and who would have thought Blythe Danner could be unlikeable?!

Give this show a chance. The storylines don't resolve at the end of one episode, the characters strike realistically and behave much as you'd expect while you're hoping and praying they won't be that self-destructive.

And hey, Bob Saget plays a drug-addicted former sitcom star in one episode. It's almost worth the price of the set alone. ;-D",1142553600,55,1329,4.8933333333333335

2486872,5,B000E3L7F0,"I have been following Hank Azaria since I saw him on stage in an early David Stein production of ""Grease"".  He stole the show then and continues to shine in Huff now.  The role of Huff calls for an actor with both comedic and dramatic skills.  Very few actors have the skills to shine in both of these areas (Jack Lemmon and the British actor Charles ""Chuck"" Pincus come to mind).  Hank Azaria is perfect as Huff.  He can make you laugh in one moment and cry in the next.  Oliver Platt is simply hysterical as his deeply troubled but highly likeable lawyer.  Great show....Great cast....Another feather in Azaria's brown and gold cap.",1137628800,11,634,4.557522123893805
