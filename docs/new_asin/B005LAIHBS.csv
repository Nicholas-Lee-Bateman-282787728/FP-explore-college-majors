4742071,3,B005LAIHBS,"Luc Besson has been behind some of the best action and sci-fi films of the past eighteen years; directing films such as Leon: The Professional and The Fifth Element and contributing to the writing process for films such as Kiss of the Dragon, The Transporter, Revolver, and From Paris With Love. Besson's films aren't always the smartest or the best written, but they don't have to be when they're usually so damn entertaining. On top of that, I'm a fairly huge Guy Pearce fan other than last month's Seeking Justice, which we'll just pretend doesn't exist for the sake of argument. So Lockout looked like it could be a hell of a lot of fun, but there was something I couldn't quite put my finger on that didn't seem quite right in the trailers and TV spots.

Accused of a crime he didn't commit, Snow (Guy Pearce) is about to be locked away for thirty years. The president's daughter Emilie Warnock (Maggie Grace) is sent to a prison in outer space to help psychologically diagnose the prisoners when an interrogation goes wrong and prisoner Hydell (Joseph Gilgun) escapes and sets all 400+ prisoners on the space station free. Snow is offered his freedom if he can break into the prison and rescue Emilie.

Lockout has this superb beginning. The interrogation sequence with Snow and Langral (Peter Stormare) and the fight sequence immediately afterwards are both extremely entertaining and fast paced. The closing part of it with the gun is something taken right out of a Jackie Chan flick, which should be taken as the highest compliment. The entire movie has incredible momentum anyway as the slower moments are tense and everything else is just go-go-go the whole time. Snow is a great character, as well. While he's basically John McClane from the Die Hard films, he's the most entertaining character Pearce has ever played. Cynical, sarcastic, and a complete smart aleck, Snow reminds me of me to the most exaggerated extent.

Things begin to go downhill fast during the freeway chase. The special effects are very unusual. Everything is so blurry and whizzes by you so fast that you can't really process what's going on. It's like it almost feels like it's low budget or something, but it's not quite that bad. The outer space battles are along the same lines. The Snow character never gets old though as he's downright hilarious throughout the entire movie. His interactions with Emilie are just as good if not slightly better as both Pearce and Grace have fairly decent chemistry together on-screen.

The sci-fi action film has this Paul W.S. Anderson and Michael Bay quality to it that keeps you from fully enjoying it. The TV spots are comparing Lockout to Die Hard and Blade Runner. While there is a small Blade Runner vibe early on before Snow is shipped off into space, it disappears quickly. Lockout is more like a combination of Die Hard, The One, Event Horizon (without all of the implications of hell), and Armageddon. It's like there's something good in there, but it has to compete for your attention with its weird special effects and storyline that doesn't exactly put you off entirely but feels hackneyed to a certain degree.

If it wasn't for the thoroughly amusing and brilliantly written character of Snow, Lockout probably wouldn't be worth seeing at all. Since he is though, Luc Besson has helped create another fairly satisfying sci-fi action adventure. It's just a shame that its entertainment value fluctuates so often throughout its duration.",1334275200,64,3475,4.873096446700508
4742072,3,B005LAIHBS,"Nobody makes movies quite like Lockout anymore. The only person who does is Luc Besson, the French film maker who has been perpetually stuck in the 1990s, really the heyday of his significant career. Even as a producer he hires guys to make essentially the same movie with a slightly different coat of paint. Movies like Taken, The Transporter, and Colombiana. They all feature heroes with jaws like granite(even Zoe Saldana was a bit rough around the edges) who don't open their mouths unless it's to say something quippy. The bad guys come in only two flavors: either they look like Nazi skinheads who stumbled under the needle of a blind tattoo artist, or they look like extras from The Matrix. Shadowy government types lurk around every corner.

And yet there's a certain charm to a movie like Lockout, ridiculous in its overflowing machismo and mediocre special effects. Its a throwback to the days when every action hero didn't need to be that great of a guy, as long as they occasionally say something funny and get the girl in the end. Guy Pearce, who no longer remotely resembles the guy who starred in Christopher Nolan's Memento, plays a tough as nails, quick witted ex-government agent(aren't they all???) named Snow. When we meet him, in the whip smart and outrageously funny(""I'm being beaten up by a guy named Rupert?"") opening minutes, Snow is being interrogated(read: tortured) by the head of Secret Service, seeking answers for a crime Snow may or may not have committed. Railroaded, Snow is to be sent to prison on MS-One, a deep space prison full of the world's worst criminals.

Before any of that happens, the President's daughter, Emilie Warnock(Maggie Grace) goes on a diplomatic mission to MS One to make sure the deep sleep process the inmates are placed under is humane, but instead winds up a prisoner herself when a jailbreak occurs. Guess who gets to show up and reluctantly save the day? You get one guess. Snow gets to drop in like Snake Plissken, beat back the frantic, barely intelligible thugs running the joint, and secure himself a Presidential pardon if he gets the job done. It doesn't go well, and when he's not busy trying not to end up on the business end of some con's shank, he has to put up with the feisty Emilie who has her own agenda.

Pearce gives this film the comedic punch and necessary swagger it needs to overcome the shoddy special effects. Some of the jabs he hurls at Maggie Grace, with whom he shares some pretty good chemistry, will remind you of old school Bruce Willis. The problem is the film can't really keep up the pace established in the brilliant, action packed first five minutes. As the momentum staggers, the glaring weaknesses in the CG animated sequences become more of an issue. A Star Wars inspired aerial dogfight is embarrassingly bad, worse than what you can find in an average Playstation video game. There's also the issue of Snow not really having an enemy worth talking about. Grace, who played Taken's damsel in distress, is in much the same position here although her character proves to be more than capable.

None of this totally sinks the film, however, and  for those who loved movies like Die Hard, Escape from New York or anything in the 80s with Carl Weathers or Arnold Schwarzenegger, you can do worse than spending 90 minutes in outer space with Lockout.",1334102400,9,3346,4.742268041237113

Life is what you make of it!! When it gets too tough deal with it. Don't run from it but these movies do help, They are a way to escape for awhile. My advice, (you don't have to take it) take a deep breath and just enjoy them for the pure escapism; then get back to the real world and you'll find you have a better perspective on your problems.

4742323,2,B005LAIHBS,"Based on what I saw, I'm guessing they ran out of money at some point while making this film. It's the best explanation for why it's fairly solid in many places, but weirdly thin in others. Pearce is good, but there is not enough character development to get you to care about the characters or what will happen to them. Did it get left on the editing room floor? In several action sequences, things happen way too fast, like when a fall to earth from orbit takes less than a minute. Maybe gravity is stronger in 2079?

SO, if I review a vid it's because it warranted a review. Guy Pearce has started to pop up in a few good movies lately, so I've tracked his performances and he does not disappoint. In this vid, --which reminds me just a wee bit of Escape from New York-- takes place in the not so distant future. The most dangerous criminals are kept in cryonic stasis upon huge prison satellites. These unfortunate prisoners are frozen to negate any expenditure that the old earth prisons had to deal with. But here's the rub: rumours of horrific punishment begins to leak out  of this orbiting Alcatraz.  These prisoners (even though most of them deserve their fate) are being held in stasis which keeps their bodies inanimate, but THERE MINDS ARE FULLY AWAKE. Years, decades each prisoner trapped inside their heads. I can think of no worse punishment. A human rights delegation arrives at the prison hell bent on finding the truth. Among the activists, there is someone special...someone who is NOT supposed to be there: The Presidents daughter...Murphy's Law, as it so often does, comes into play. The prisoners manage to escape their pods. The President is beside himself. Desperate, The President finds an unlikely ally, a soon to be prisoner that was on his way to incarceration (Pearce) and makes a deal: get his daughter out and he walks. Only one problem. The prison is designed to lockdown AND lockout. No way out, no way in. A contingency that would stop an escape, or a prison break. The whole enormous prison is designed to automatically shut down, it's orbit would then decay and will eventually burn up upon reentry. The incinerated remains (what's left of it), will crash into the sea......The clock is ticking... Good Vid. Very much enjoyed it.",1461110400,4,1879,4.832298136645963

But it wasn't just Guy Pearce's stiff portrayal; the portrayal of the President was lame and unemotional, the Warden was, well, I think you get the picture. Was it the one-liner dialogue that did the movie in, or was it the bad acting that revealed the cliched dialogue to be what it is, resulting in one-dimensional, stereotypical action-hero-movie portrayals? This movie tries way too hard to be Die Hard in space.  The sane convict brother was a more likeable guy than the hero, and the only decent acting was done by a few actors including Lennie James (Shaw) and Vincent Regan & Joseph Gilgun, the sane and insane brother convicts who drive the movie. Because the movie was so dismal, their acting ends up shining like diamonds in a coal bin which can only help but further their careers.  I'm left wondering which came first, the chicken or the egg? Was it the bad dialogue and script that soured the acting? Or was it the acting that curdled the dialogue? It had to be a combination of both; the end result of which equals a predictable, wasted, half-hearted effort of a movie.",1425686400,,1281,4.638766519823789

4743079,1,B005LAIHBS,"Lockout

  This is an action movie on steroids.  The opening scene has hero Guy Pearce being beaten by agents of the government in the last part of the 21st century.  He knows something he is not telling, something about a missing case.  The case was taken from a murder site, a murder that he is blamed for.  Then the writers forget about the missing case and we are treated to a reprise of Escape from New York (or Escape from L.A. if you like).  The falsely condemned man is offered a pardon if he can rescue the presidents beautiful daughter from a maximum security prison-in space!
 The first time in the major league directorial team of James Mather and Stephen St. Leger direct the action as if it were a pinball game, the more bongs, gongs and lights the better.  Mather and St. Leger must also take the blame for the script which they helped to craft along with Luc Besson.  Besson also wrote the recent entertaining vengeance flick Columbiana and the very successful Taken of the recent past.  This is not Bessons best work, not by a long shot.  When you throw in the score by Alexandre Azaria (who scored Transporter 2 and Transporter 3), music which is much too loud, over whelming and over the top and the viewer feels as if he is actually inside of a video game.
 The story rushes along much faster than a speeding bullet with only the slightest strands of a story line to stitch the action all together.  The implausible is layered upon the absurd until we are left breathless, confused and disappointed.  Poor Luc Besson acted as the producer as well as writer and foolishly spent $20 million on making the film.  For the most part the production values are good, with a quite acceptable space prison, costumes and what not.  Guy Pearce, an actor with 24 big screen appearances on his resume (including the remarkable Memento) is much better as an actor than he is called upon to perform.  He wisecracks his way through the mayhem, slaying the murderous inmates with impunity while making an indelible impression on the Presidents daughter along the way.
 The most memorable character is a psychopathic prison inmate.  This is never good.  The hero should be the most memorable character.
  People are staying away from this one in droves, and they should.  This one saw blade stinker has made only $13 million  by the third week of release.  It is rated PG-13 for plenty of violence but should be rated PU.  It lasts an hour and 50 minutes.  My movie buddy this week slept through most of this thing in spite of the noise, explosions and bright primary colors.  He is a wise man.
 Remember the mysterious case that everyone was so concerned about?  The matter is resolved at the end of the film, but only the hero learns the answer.  We, the ticket buying audience are left knowing nothing.  This is not good movie making.",1424390400,,2839,4.589641434262949

4743323,2,B005LAIHBS,"When I was young I had enjoyed the film. This was ofcourse before, I knew how to correctly judge and criticize film. And of course it had a hefty heaping of violence, and at that age that was all I wanted in a movie. I wasn't too judgmental of what I saw on the screen back then... but now I am, and as such I now really loath this film. My review of 'Lockout' below.

'Lockout' follows Snow (Played by Guy Pearce) a man forced to enter a space prison, when it is over taken by about 500 rape and murder convicts who took over the ship. The surprise is, the President's own daughter, Emilie (Played by Maggie Grace) who was inspecting the safety of the prisoners, is trapped on the ship, and so it is up to Snow to enter the ship, retrieve her, and get the hell out of there.

Generic, generic, generic, generic.... That line could go on forever. I'm not even lying this has got to be the blandest, thrill-less sci-fi action film I have ever seen.

The script has few surprises, and follows the same ol GENERIC 'by the dots' action playbook route. The script has 'Snow' as a GENERIC John McLane type action hero, who enjoys making jokes while he works... not to mention he does enjoy a good smoke every now and then just like McLane. The script provides plenty of income (Taken from other films) but no outcome. Nothing here is even the slightest bit interesting. GENERIC. GENERIC. GENERIC.

Not to mention the editing is migraine inducing. We cut back and forth and back and forth between one thing and another. Even if the script is dumb and generic, I mean the action would have been at least stupid fun, but it isn't because of the editing. The action shots are so poorly edited together you cannot even make sense of what you're seeing. I hate it when movies have such sloppy editing; it basically ruins the entire product.

Wait, wait, wait, that's not even the worst part. The worst part is the particular cheesy-ness this film seems to have. Every moment of this film made me laugh out loud. The clunky dialogue, the bland characters... it's all so cheesy. I couldn't stop laughing at how bad the dialogue was... it produces the 'no duh' effect, that I always have whenever a film say's the obvious. Basically this entire film stats the obvious, it's unbelievable. And the special effects during Snow's chase sequence in the first 10 minutes of the film is just so bad, that I had to fast-forward through it. It looked like a poorly animated racing game from the 80's.

The one thing that kept me back from full out loathing this piece of trailer trash was the unbelievable amount of effort the cast made to try and keep this from sinking... obviously it sank, but it was a nice try from the cast. 'Guy Pearce' is almost always grand in any role he takes; it's just that his efforts are weighed down by his John McLane- rip off character. The guy that really got me smiling though was the outstanding breakout performance from 'Joseph Gilgun' as the psycho-nut, prisoner Hydell. It's noticeable how much this guy really tried to make the best of his character, and he does. 'Hydell' is efficient as a wacko back-up villain, to the more sophisticated one. Gilgun helped make his character juicier and fun and I liked it.

All and All 'Lockout' is almost a complete mess. Almost. If it weren't for some pretty convincing performances, 'Lockout' would have completely flopped due to the migraine inducing editing, poor scripting, laughable special effects, and just a lack of creativity. D- 5/2/14

'Lockout' is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action, and language including some sexual references. It's appropriate for ages 13 and up. I doubt anyone over and under the age of 13 would enjoy this one though.",1404691200,,3731,4.591591591591592

4743386,3,B005LAIHBS,"Luc Besson is the Writer/Director of The Fifth Element and Taken. Usually when you sit down to watch one of his films, you're in for a treat. When he said he was making a new film that combined elements of both popular movies, I was excited, and then sorely disappointed. Lockout introduces us to a new kind of a prison, one that is in outer space, and holds it's prisoners in cryogenic stasis. The daughter of the U.S. President (Maggie Grace) was set to tour the facility, to make sure the prisoners are being treated fairly, when all hell breaks loose. Wanting to restore order with a minimal amount of casualties, the President sends in one man, his best C.I.A. operative, Snow (Guy Pearce), whose job it is to save the hostages. For starters this film is so full of cliques and references to other things that it almost becomes a farce of itself. Guy Pearce is the star and he was very good, however his character plays like John McClain in Outer Space. Snow is full of jokes and is this huge tough guy, who was almost a mirror image of Bruce Willis in Die Hard. The only thing missing was a catch phrase and lets all be thankful for that. Pearce is paired with Maggie Grace, who as in Taken, finds herself as a hostage once again. To her credit, she was a lot less whiny than in Taken and even fights back a little bit, but she basically played the same character that she always does. I don't know about you, but I have a hard time feeling sorry for a beautiful spoiled blonde girl who gets into trouble because she traveled to Europe or had to take on the cause of prisoners rights. Overall, there was a lot of action, but not much of a story to play on. Guy Pearce does a pretty good job, but Lockout is honestly a predictable, paper thin story, with special effects that aren't anything to write home about. It's another big budget film that tries to wow audiences with a unique setting and lots of explosions in the previews, but the only surprise here is that the usually reliable Luc Besson fails to deliver a worthwhile film.",1398556800,,2039,4.396825396825397

The story starts with a woman in a position of authority trying to do something good for people who are imprisoned in a maximum security prison that orbits earth.  Things go from alright to desperate in a matter of seconds and her father calls in the one person capable of going in and bringing her out alive.  Not that the ""hero"" cares in the least about her or anyone else on the station.
The story was disjointed at best.  I watched it in a sub-run theater and when I left I thought the theater had never looked so grimy and dingy and dark.  Now I realize that was just my reaction to the lousy movie.
Let's put this in some perspective.  I enjoyed the TV show Firefly and I grew up watching war movies (Desert Rats, The Great Escape, The Longest Day, etc., etc.).  I also grew up watching Humphrey Bogart movies.  I own Timeline, Paycheck, Spider-Man, and The Avengers, and will probably someday own The Bourne Legacy.  I'm not opposed to action adventure movies.

4743496,4,B005LAIHBS,"Lockout is a sci-fi action/thriller co-written and produced by Luc Besson, the man who gave us The Transporter, The Fifth Element and Leon: The Professional, and tells the story of a convicted CIA agent (Guy Pearce) who must break into a maximum security prison in space to rescue the daughter (Maggie Grace) of the President of the United States. There isn't much to the story, which has been done before in different ways, but this sci-fi version and action-fueled adrenaline rush is great. Directed by Stephen Saint Leger & James Mather, Lockout is a good, fun and intense thrill ride.

The directing is good, but nothing award-winning. The look of it is more like a Stephen Sommers-film mixed with Die Hard; dark, well-paced and fun. Guy Pearce was just amazing as Snow, a CIA operative who's betrayed by the government and framed for the murder of his friend, another undercover CIA agent. Snow is rude, obnoxious and off-the-wall, but that helps give his character the creative juices to make this movie stand out. Otherwise, we'd have just a Live Free or Die Hard knock-off. Maggie Grace was really good as Emilie Warnock, the daughter of the president. The visual effects for the movie were great, given that it was very low-budget ($20 million). Sure, they're nothing compared to that of Prometheus, Elysium, Oblivion or the really massive sci-fi movies, but they're still damn good. The script, again, nothing really new here but a refreshing look back on some old action classics mixed in with some new characters and details. The thing with this movie, though, is that there can be another, even though there isn't much story material to work with. It could be more focused on the character of Snow, who I would have to say acts kind of like a futuristic Jack Sparrow, of sorts.

Lockout is a fun, ridiculous sci-fi action movie that deserves to be a part of any action-fan's collection, especially for Guy Pearce's great performance. Pearce needs more leading roles anyway, or at least ones like Lockout, where he gets to kick butt and destroy pretty much everything.

Okay okay so maybe there's some plot holes and some predictably stupid bad guys and, you know, the usual action movie props.  But there's good wit, good humor, good one-liners and good action.  It's not weighted down by a bunch of soppy drama.  The main character is perfectly likable, finding himself in a situation he'd prefer not to be in, trying to do more-or-less the right thing while also trying to arrange a little sneaky side mission he needs to get done.  It's not going to win any Oscars but the acting is solid enough to not cause any distraction.

The sets were cool, the computer animation up-to-date, and the casting was great.  This is a movie I'm glad Guy Pearce took a chance on.

The big negative was the lack of any sort of quality bad guy.  Some other reviews have pointed out parallels to Escape From New York, which is very apt, but that movie had loads of great villains (even in some sense the main character).  Lockout essentially has an psychotic tool yelling and hitting everyone with a hammer.  It didn't fit with the rest of the movie, even falling into slasher flick territory.  I know they were trying to make things visceral or claustrophobic, or maybe give an edge to an otherwise loopy spacecraft plot, but it was (almost literally) ham-fisted.

There is the under-current of romance between Pearce and Grace, and the love/hate relationship between the convict brothers is explored to a minor degree. I must say I found it strange to see Guy Pearce with muscles, but he does make a good semi-action hero.

The storyline was familiar - as usual these days - but still enjoyable. The relationship between Grace and Pearce was strange, in some ways. She was very child-like, and him even more so. I suppose that tension between them is necessary for character development more than anything else. The main bad guy (I forget his name) was excellent at being a psychopath. I really enjoyed his performance, however it was pretty obvious that his deranged brother was going to kill him in the end (spoiler alert!)

Good action scenes, watchable characters, though the ending was very familiar as well. There is always a big explosion at the end, just as the good guys escape with seconds to spare. The difference with this one was that they didn't escape in a pod.

4743607,3,B005LAIHBS,"This is a mostly failed attempt to make a good action film in space and barely a couple of weeks after watching it I already forgot most of the ""plot"" - still, it has some elements that make it possible to watch. Below, more of my impressions with some limited SPOILERS.

Year of Grace 2079. A CIA agent called Snow (Guy Pearce) is arrested for... well, something, it doesn't really matter. For reasons unknown, it is the Secret Service director Scott Langral (Peter Stormare) who is in charge of Snow's arrest, interrogation, torture and future incarceration in (deep breath here!) absolutely most maximal maximum ultra-modern high-security top-level sophisticated super space super-penitentiary MS One (you can expire now).

But lucky for him, in the same time Emilie Warnock (Maggie Grace), daughter of President of United States, arrives at (deep breath here!) absolutely most maximal maximum ultra-modern high-security top-level sophisticated super space super-penitentiary MS One (you can expire now), for some kind of bull%$t mission necessary to explain her presence there. Just a little moment after she arrives psychiatrically challenged quasi-neanderthalian inmates break out and seize control of the (deep breath here!) absolutely most maximal maximum ultra-modern high-security top-level sophisticated super space super-penitentiary MS One (you can expire now), as easily as if they were stealing lollipops from kindergarten children!

Immediately after Snow receives an offer from Langral (gosh, it seems that Secret Service director is the REAL guy in charge of USA) - he will inflitrate (deep breath here!) absolutely most maximal maximum ultra-modern high-security top-level sophisticated super space super-penitentiary MS One (you can expire now), save the girl (to hell with other hostages...) and bring her back to safety. In exchange he will receive full amnesty... And then the film continues, mostly along the lines of ""Escape from New York""...

This is not a good film and you can fast forward some fragments - and you interrupt the watching and returns it, you will not lose much... For a moment I pondered the possibility to give it two stars, but then I found some elements which allowed me to give a third one:

- Maggie Grace, a very pleasant vision (but regretfully always with her clothes on...)

- Peter Stormare and especially his character, ultimately less stereotyped and stupid than suggested at the beginning of the film

- some good lines, mostly during the exchanges between Snow and Emilie

- couple of good jokes

- Snow's first name

- one action twist, somehow less predictable than the rest of the film

- a message of hope for guys all around the world: you can verbally abuse a girl, hit her in the face, shove her around, brutally cut her hair, cover her head in dirty smelling grease and even throw her in the void from great heights - and she still will want to have sex with you. There is just a catch - you must look like Guy Pearce...

Bottom line, this is a barely average film, borrowing enormously from better movies, with a ridiculous scenario (and especially a completely laughable space battle) and an extremely predictable ending - but nevertheless still in the limits of watchable. My advice, RENT instead of buying, as it is really a thing to see once.

Fully functional brain is not necessary to watch it. Also, the intake of a minimum of three good beers just before or in the early watching stages certainly will help enjoying ""Lock out"".",1373500800,,3502,5.059027777777778

4743741,2,B005LAIHBS,"Literally the only reason to see LOCKOUT is to enjoy a loose, fun, devil-may-care performance from the usually more stoic and flat Guy Pearce.  He's always been a charismatic, interesting performer, but hasn't really built a reputation for lightness (LA CONFIDENTIAL, MEMENTO).  Yet in this predicatible, by-the-numbers film, Pearce manages to stretch himself in surprising ways.  This doesn't make the movie particularly worthwhile, not does it elevate Pearce to another level...but it was amusing.

Pearce plays Snow, a government secret agent sort in the year 2079.  Somehow never fully explained, he's gotten cross-ways with some of his superiors and he's implicated in a murder he didn't commit.  He's sentenced to prison on the off-earth penitentiary, where prisoners are put into suspended animation for the duration of their sentences.

Just before he's due to be incarcerated, the daughter of the President of the US, who is on a humanitarian visit to the penitentiary, is taken hostage when things go wrong and all 500 prisoners are released at one time.  Snow is given the opportunity to save her in exchange for charges against him being dropped.  So naturally he takes on this impossible assignment, going up against hordes of hardened criminals.  Even though I haven't seen this specific idea in just this way before...very little about the film feels new or surprising.

Except Pearce.  His Snow is a smart-mouth.  Almost everything he says is a smart-aleck comment or a snide insult.  There's nothing serious about this man.  He's like an action hero stand-up comic.  It's not believable for an instant, but it is mildly amusing.  Seeing Pearce do it adds a dimension of fun.  But make no mistake...this mindlessly violent, uninspired film is not worth seeing.

And just in case you think it MIGHT be worth seeing, I should note that there were some special effects in this film, in particular during an opening chase scene that are SO terrible, I was simply floored.  There is a motorcycle chase scene that Is no better than a half-rate cut scene in a video game.  No exaggeration.

Maggie Grace plays the President's daughter competently, but she's generic.  All the villains are uninspired, and the ""agency leaders"" who run the operation from the ground (as it were) are utterly by the book of clichd screen characters.

Okay, I loved this movie. Glaring physics errors aside (c'mon--the um... escape @ the end? that was ludicrous) but you have to willingly suspend disbelief. The haters can mock it, but come on, you expect some of the crazy stuff, right?

What stood out for me were the one-liners. Snow was sarcastic and quippy. Aren't we tired of brooding heroes yet? He smart-mouthed, refused to take things seriously (on the surface) and got annoyed with the heroine.

She was great! The dialogue between them was fun and snappy and she was more than arm-candy but not made into the stereotypical ""tough"" gal, or ""secret ninja- 'oh I studied ballet which magically becomes perfectly useful to take out huge thugs'"". Not Ripley-esque, which would not have suited her character anyway--but she made her presence known and made tough decisions.

----SPOILERS----

There was one particularly awkward part for me, as a viewer--that scene between the two of them when they are crouched behind --yet another--bulkhead. She rebukes him for leaving his friends behind/hung out to dry? Totally out of pace, character and plot. It made NO sense since she had no backstory on him. I felt like it was added to give them friction. A fake ""misunderstanding""--what is this a bad romance novel?

4743819,3,B005LAIHBS,"The question that Lockout raises that requires the most pondering from a savvy viewer is, can a single performance be so unexpected, offbeat and exuberant as to make a bad movie good. Well, not good I suppose, but it can make a humdrum experience more entertaining, interesting, and outright fun. That is precisely what Guy Pearce does for the generic genre exercise Lockout.

Playing Snow, no first name given, unless it is also Snow.  A former CIA operative, turned outlaw, framed for a crime he didn't commit. Snow is given a choice, spend thirty years cryogenically frozen in prison or go in alone to a penal colony orbiting in space to rescue the US President's daughter (Maggie Grace from Taken), who is caught up as a hostage in a prison riot.

If this sounds familiar it's because Lockout, the latest potboiler from the bane of the French critics existence Luc Besson, shamelessly  rips off John Carpenter's films Escape From New York, Escape From L.A. and to a lesser degree Assault on Prescient 13. Even a once speculated third installment to be titled ""Escape From Earth"". However, budgetary restrictions and a recycled script of derivative characters and clich dialogue makes this come across more like a Roger Corman knock off of Carpenter, which the right audience will find appealing.

The only thing that really allows Lockout to stand out, to rise above it's middling limitations is it's star performance from Guy Pearce. A long under used leading man, here Pearce shines in a character clearly patterned after Kurt Russell's ""Snake"" Plisskan, ""Snake""  still is a cooler name than Snow. Pearce brings a sense of wit, sarcasm and a lazy anti-hero streak that would make Bogie look like Sly Stallone.

Going full on commando as the chain smoking, wise cracking rebel hero, Pearce is hard not to like here. He is such a good casting choice, because he is so unexpected in the role, where a Jason Statham or Gerard Butler would have seemed as tired as the material. This is an old school sci-fi actioner, we've seen it all before, it's exhaustedly plagiaristic, but at a well paced 96 minutes and with such an amicable star performance, some how this keeps from showing all it's obvious cracks.

Lacking the artificial ""depth"" of so many of Besson's recent out put, this picture works as pure unflinching fluff. Sometimes that is just what an audience wants, even I have fallen victim to such primitive desires, but here Pearce adds the spark to the ignition that turns this puppy over to something a little more resembling a quality picture.

The writing was awful, the characters completely one-dimensional, and I even felt sorry for Guy Pearce (I like him as an actor, but what the hell was he doing in this travesty?!) and the idiotic ""chemistry"" they tried to build between him and Maggie Grace's character.
I could see the potential in this movie, which I think is why I kept watching...hoping it would get interesting. The only time I was remotely entertained was when it was finally revealed what Guy Pearce's character's first name is. But even that was trite and contrived.
This might have been better in the hands of a better director, and I thought I saw Luc Besson's name in the credits...if he had directed it, it may have been better. But still, the dialogue was so freakin' lame it was unbearable, and I doubt even the most talented director could have saved it.

4743962,4,B005LAIHBS,"This is one of those hit or miss sci fi action films that comes close to really hitting, especially on the humor and one liners.

It's basically about an agent (Guy Pearce) wrongfully convicted of a crime who is sent to rescue the American President's daughter (Maggie Grace) when she's captured at an orbital prison facility (she's investigating a drug being used to put convicts into stasis sleep and whether it has long term damage). It's set in something of a near future Sci-Fi piece with cars that drive off the ground and such.

The humorous romantic chemistry between Maggie Grace and Guy Pearce was the best consistent thread of the tale but some of supporting cast are below par. There are some nice touches here and there like the convict not letting them pass who has skull tats all around his mouth or how the ally of Grace's character gives her about another minute of air. That said, this is a lighthearted action piece which doesn't take itself seriously so consider it to be casual fun if you enjoy the genre.

This French film had a budget of $20M and made a bit over $28M at the Box Office.

Guy Pearce swaggers his way through his role as Snow, tossing off one-liners like dandruff, and is actually quite good.  TAKEN and LOST's Maggie Grace is coy and sassy as the President's endangered daughter.  The crazed prisoners are stereotypes and Peter Stormare is his usual nasty self.

4744054,4,B005LAIHBS,"It's official: Lockout is a modern guilty pleasure of mine I genuinely enjoy watching over and over. I know it's cheesy, I know it's low budget, downright ridiculous and a poor man's Escape from New York, but unlike the dreadful Escape from L.A., Lockout has won me over with its charm.

Guy Pearce plays the cliche wise cracking, too cool for school, Snow and absolutely nails the role. His performance is tongue in cheek, but he looks every bit the action hero in the scenes that calls for it and delivers his one liners with perfect comedic timing. I found the humor in this film to be genuinely funny where I laughed along with the writers and cast instead of laughing at them as I would with other campy flicks. It's a shame Pearce never had that breakout role to become a leading man because he certainly has both the acting ability and the charisma to carry a film. He's cool, he's tough, he's funny, yet he might not be as smooth with the ladies as we would think - Snow is just a great character. Not to get too political here, but I also think Snow as a character is a fierce individualist with a Libertarian streak who tries to live his life on his own terms without succumbing to statist or corporatist pressure. At one point he is criticized for being a ""relic"" because he chain smokes cigarettes in a time where ""nobody smokes any more!"" I just love this guy.

The premise of Lockout is far fetched, but creative in my opinion. It's the future, Snow is some sort of secret agent framed for a murder, there is a high tech prison orbiting the Earth and in it are the President's daughter and an incarcerated friend of Snow's who can tell him the location of a mysterious brief case he needs. After the prison is taken over by rioting inmates, Snow agrees to infiltrate it to rescue the President's daughter and to find his friend to get the location of the brief case. Simple, stupid, but so much fun. It is not a badly written script, it works for the popcorn flick this is. Action, humor, and space in one movie? Count me in.

Aside from Guy Pearce nailing the lead role, the supporting cast deserves credit as well and are a delight to watch on screen. There is a crazy Scotsman who has to be one of the better bad guys I've seen in a movie in a long time and a much larger, intimidating fellow who leads the prisoners while serving as a balance to the Scotsman. Lennie James, whom you may remember as Morgan Jones from the first season of The Walking Dead (a character we all would like to see return the series), plays Harry Shaw who is in regular communication with Snow throughout the film and the two have great chemistry with one another similar to McClane and Sgt. Al Powell in Die Hard (just nowhere near as deep of a connection). Maggie Grace is not as annoying as I feared and plays your standard hot damsel in distress which she admittedly does well in movies/shows like Taken and Lost.

What are the downsides to this film? Well if you're a big John Carpenter fan then you might have heard that this was supposed to be a sequel of sorts to Carpenter's beloved classic Escape from New York starring Kurt Russel as the raspy voiced Snake Plissken. That cult classic is a much darker film with a subtle but serious underlying theme driving the narrative; it focuses on suspense and tension over one liners and charm, and it manages to suspend audience disbelief in its admittedly over the top premise of Manhattan becoming a prison colony. To many Carpenter faithful who wanted a true spiritual scuccessor, Lockout will not deliver what you're looking for. I myself am a huge Carpenter fan, but after the abortion that was Escape from L.A. I figured it's best to put that series to rest and start anew. Like it or not, for better or worse, Lockout does its own thing.

Another downside to the film which actually prevented me from paying to see it in theaters is the PG-13 rating. I have just purchased the unrated DVD from Amazon, but from what I hear even the unrated cut doesn't go beyond PG-13 standards. Lockout does not need gratuitous sex or violence to be good, nor does it need a particularly dark tone and theme, but the movie would have benefited tremendously had there been at least a few kill shots to see. Instead we are stuck with typical PG-13 cut away shots which rob us from seeing some rather creative deaths courtesy of Snow's keen survival instincts. If a bad guy has a collar around his neck that is about to explode, then I want to see the head explode even if only for a second like in the movie Scanners; if an enemy activates a booby trap by hitting the trip wire and suddenly finds himself staring into a gun about to unload in his face, then I want so see it unload in his face as if this were a Paul Verhoeven film! The crazy Scotsman character couldn't be quite as menacing as he could of been thanks to the rating and how dangerous can a PG-13 prison really be? A lot of tension is instantly removed before even seeing the film because you know your eyes and ears are going to be protected by the rating. As charming and sarcastic as Snow is, I would have liked to have seen him in some real danger to see if it would have any effect on his nonchalant attitude. A little, just a little, Verhoeven style violence (Robocop, Total Recall) could have gone a long way in making this movie something truly special. Lockout feels like it was outright censored at times. EuropaCorp needs to make R cuts for their DVD releases, leave the PG-13 cuts for theater goers if you're worried about ticket sales.

Well that's it, there is my review of Lockout. I really liked this movie, it won me over despite its rating and cheese ball nature. It's just a lot of fun for me to watch and definitely classifies as a guilty pleasure. It's one of those movies you recommend to your friends not because you think they will enjoy it, but because you sincerely hope they do enjoy it so you can find others to share the guilt and fun with.",1356739200,3,5971,4.418710263396912

4744129,4,B005LAIHBS,"I didn't have very high expectations for this movie, but it proved to be an exciting, entertaining, fast paced flick. The glue that holds this movie together, however, is the stellar performance by Guy Pearce. He's always great in any role (too bad he isn't used more often in Hollywood), and his snarky, charismatic character in ""Lockout"" is one of his best. Something kind of weird is that he actually looks to be younger and in better shape than he did in ""Memento"", and that movie is over ten years old!

As previously mentioned, ""Lockout"" is entertaining. It got me engaged during the early going, and the pacing is fast and furious, without too much reliance on action. If the movie relies too heavily on anything, it's Pearce's one-liners... yet, somehow, they work. The plot is a bit hokey (though it seemed awfully promising initially), and it defies logic oftentimes (ONE BUTTON is pressed to release EVERY SINGLE convict in the entire prison at once!), but this is not ""The King's Speech""... it's a popcorn action flick with sci-fi elements, and on that level, it's a success.",1356134400,2,1087,4.81283422459893

4744300,4,B005LAIHBS,"When it comes to action films, Luc Besson definitely knows how to entertain the masses.

From films such as ""The Fifth Element"", ""Leon: The Professional"", ""Taken"", the ""Taxi"" films to name a few, Besson is well-known for his films. He's also known as a man who gives people chances to shine in his film, not just as acting talent but also as part of the crew.

For the 2012 film ""The Lockout"", Besson produced co-wrote the screenplay for the film with co-directors/co-writers James Mather and Stephen St. Leger (the film would be the duo's directorial debut).

The film would star Guy Pearce (""Memento"", ""L.A. Confidential"", ""The Hurt Locker""), Maggie Grace (""Lost"", ""Taken"", ""Knight and Day"") and Vincent Regan (""300, ""Troy"", ""Unleashed"").

VIDEO:

""Lockout: Unrated Edition"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  The film looks absolutely fantastic on Blu-ray!  From the opening scene of seeing the stubble on Guy Pearce's chin to the closeup of Maggie Grace's eye.  And the fact that a lot of the film's settings are CG, there resolution is high and detail is fantastic.  It's important to note that the film is more on the cool side, as the film is shot in a metallic structure of blues and grays.  But overall, ""Lockout: Unrated Edition"" looks impressive!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Lockout: Unrated Edition"" is presented in English, Italian, Portugues 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  And as one can expect from a Besson-related film, that is plenty of action.  There are explosions galore, gunshots galore, metal breaking apart, people being slammed, a chase scene... the lossless soundtrack for ""Lockout"" is immersive, chaotic and for audiophiles, they will love the immersiveness of this film.  Dialogue is crystal clear, music and special effects are crystal clear, great use of surround channels and LFE.  Impressive!

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Lockout"" comes with the following special features:

  Breaking Into Lockout - Making Of - (11:07) Featuring the directors and cast talking about their characters and working on the film.
  A Vision of the Future - Production Design & Special Effects - (10:13) Interview with Frank Walsh (Supervising Art Director), Oliver Hooge (Art Director) and richard Bain (Visual Effects Supervisor) talking about the visual effects of the film and the use of green screen.

EXTRAS:

""Lockout: Unrated Edition"" comes with a slipcase plus an UltraViolet code for instantly stream or download to PC or Mac.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Guy Pearce has been given new life as the action hero Snow in the film ""Lockout"".  While directed by James Mather and Stephen St. Leger, ""Lockout"" has the look and feel of a frenetic Besson popcorn action film!

""Lockout"" takes the banal concept of things go wrong in prison and it's up to one man to save the day.  Seems very Jack Bauer (for those familiar with ""24) but the prison is set in space and instead of grungy concrete walls, you get metallic, danky prison settings, we are given a green screen CGI futuristic prison setting which actually looks very cool!

In fact, the sci-fi futuristic visuals are well-done.  The visual effects crew were very good in focusing on creating a sci-fi look and feel of the film.  But working entirely in green screen also presents a major problem with the fact that many actors have problems in acting when no one is there and reacting when nothing is around you but green. They have to trust the director and crew and it's not the easiest thing to do for an actor.

And so, this presents the problem of ""Lockout"", the acting.  While I thought the wisecracking, stoic Snow worked well for Guy Pearce, anyone wanting more depth with his character will be sadly disappointed.  If there was anything that really didn't make sense or work is the one man having to infiltrate the prison to save the President's daughter.  One man?  President's daughter?  Farfetched isn't it? For some people, it was.

But audiences should know by now, Luc Besson films are popcorn action films that are not meant to be taken to seriously.

From ""La Femme Nikita"", ""Leon: The Professional"" and even the ""Taxi"" films, these films revolved around a single person getting involved in some trouble but yet managing to save the day despite the odds or how crazy things may seem.

It's like watching a Roland Emmerich film, you know there will be tons of action and a lot of destruction in the world.  No way should one expect anything deep or romantic, you just sit back and enjoy the ride.

I am in awe to read some people who felt disappointed that ""Lockout"" was not mentally challenging or there was not enough bloody violence.  And once again, I bring up the fact that this is a Luc Besson film.  This is not a David Fincher film, nor is it a banal horror film.  The film is about one man trying to save the President's daughter and get the hell out of the prison.

The antagonists are angry prison inmates and the callousness of some of these inmates are shown effectively (many innocent people randomly) and yes, even the president's daughter, Emilie, played by Maggie Grace, the scared and fearful hostage (although, we have seen this before for Maggie Grace in Besson's other film ""Taken"" and wouldn't be surprised if we see the same type of emotions coming from the character in the upcoming ""Taken 2).

But the fact is that these films are never meant to be serious, they are popcorn action films, nothing more and nothing less.

As for the Blu-ray release, I'm not entirely sure what scenes are unrated as the original runtime is 95 minutes and the unrated version is 95 minutes.  But I can say the film looks absolutely fantastic in HD courtesy of its CG environment.  Closeups are full of detail, such as one scene where you can see the stubble of Pearce so clearly, or even the detailed cuts of a character.  The film looks excellent on Blu-ray and it has a lossless soundtrack that is also quite immersive, considering the many action scenes.  The disappointment was mainly of its two only special features.  An audio commentary or more special features other than two, would have been nice to have on this Blu-ray release.

Overall, ""Lockout"" was a film that I enjoyed.  And for those who enjoy popcorn action films, especially films in futuristic settings will definitely enjoy ""Lockout: Unrated Edition"".",1354147200,,6405,4.877777777777778

4744303,5,B005LAIHBS,"The film's obvious influences are ""Escape From New York"" and ""Die Hard"".  If you're not paying attention Maggie Grace pretty much reprises her role in ""Taken"" as the President's hostage daughter. Regardless, ""Lockout"" has a certain ragged charm of its own almost Cormanesque.  Despite the similarities to other films it has rhythms all of its own.  I think a lot of that can be attributed to the presence of Guy Pearce in the lead role of Snow, a wrongfully disgraced CIA agent in the year 2079.  Pearce seems like the most unlikeliest of action heroes but on sheer attitude he pulls it off.  Snow is as quick with a quip as he is with a gun.  He could go toe-to-toe with John McClane in the wisecrack department.

4744349,3,B005LAIHBS,"""Lockout"" is executive-produced and co-written by Luc Besson. Perhaps this alone tells you everything you need to know about the film, of which basic idea looks like a curious mixture of ""The African Queen"" and ""The Rock."" ""Lockout"" is just another derivative action film from Besson's film company EuropaCorp, but thanks to the enjoyable performances from always reliable Guy Pearce, ""Lockout"" is mindless entertainment that is barely watchable.

In the year 2079, a CIA agent Snow is wrongly accused of murdering his friend and fellow agent. To clear his name, Snow agrees to rescue U.S. President's daughter Emilie Warnock (Maggie Grace) trapped inside MS1, a maximum security space prison taken over by 500 inmates.

Please don't ask me how come a state-of-the-art maximum security prison (made with the latest technologies) can be easily taken over by the prisoners. There are so many plot holes and head-scratchingly stupid decisions. Please don't say ""Star Wars"" if you watch the silly climactic combat scenes (apparently there would be no guided missiles in the future).

Action sequences by directors James Mather and Stephen St. Leger Watch are at best passable, but the film is still memorable for the lively performances of Guy Pearce as one-man army Snow. He is fun to watch throughout.",1353628800,,1299,5.205741626794258

4744476,2,B005LAIHBS,"Stop me if you've heard this one: President's daughter gets caught in a very bad place teeming with criminals and convicts.  A known felon gets blackmailed into helping get her out.  Yes, Snake Plissken did it all before in ""Escape From New York,"" but Lockout puts a twist on things by moving the action...to SPAAAACE!

It seems CIA agent Snow (Guy Pearce) has been framed the murder of undercover agent Frank Armstrong, who in turn had uncovered evidence of a mole within the space program selling state secrets.  When U.S. President Warnock's daughter Emilie (Maggie Grace) attends a space penitentiary known as Maximum Security (MS) One to determine if putting prisoners into stasis is cruel and unusual punishment, things go horribly awry.  SPOIEROUT: And by horribly awry I mean plot-bendingly stupid, in which her secret service bodyguard decides the best way to defend the president's daughter is to be on the side of the glass with a prisoner, and -- for reasons that only make sense to the writers -- a canister of highly explosive gas is stored directly behind the interrogation room.  Can you see where this is going? It all leads up to lots of explosions, Emilie in trouble, and Snow drafted to save her.

The plot manages to be unpredictable thanks to Hydell (Joseph Gilgun) and the ethical question of the President's personal interest in saving his daughter balanced against the possibility of a mass prison escape. Then again, this is a movie with a trailer that states with utter sincerity:

""There's only one man who can get her out.  Snow.  He's the best there is. But he's a loose cannon.""

Get that? Snow is the best there is, BUT HE'S A LOOSE CANNON!

""Lockout"" keeps piling on the silliness as the plot shambles along, complete with an automated defense system that's highly effective at keeping people out but pretty terrible at keeping people in.  What were the architects worried about, space pirates?  And if so, demonstrating the threat of space pirates might have made the whole bristling prison gunship premise a little easier to swallow.

Without Snow's witty banter with Emilie ""Lockout"" be nothing but a derivative hunk of space junk. This film is just lazy.  But it will make you wonder how the mastermind behind ""The Fifth Element"" managed to stoop so low. Here's hoping Luc Besson escapes wherever he's locked up.",1353196800,,2349,4.879093198992443

4744478,3,B005LAIHBS,"Luc Besson, as either writer, producer or director, will always deliver up something that is worth watching for some reason. That's the case here but it's not one of his better efforts.

Here's the scoop. It's 2079 and the President of the United States' daughter is on prison ship, above the earth, spearheading an investigation into the procedures being used  with the prisoners. The prisoners are in ""stasis"" but a screw-up happens and the they escape to take her hostage for their demands. The government now enlists the help of an operative, on whom they are trying to pin a treason rap, to save the day.

This is ""Escape From New York"" in outer space. But it is fraught with problems. Most are at the script level. There have been a fair number of films made using this outline. And, aside from the setting, this does little to break the mold. The plot points are hack level at best. The writing is lazy. They use certain points verbatim from other films. Other items, seen often before, needed to be more clever and it seemed they were looking for the easiest way out. Guy Pearce, who I like a lot, is given a smartalec role with no relief. Essentially everything that comes out of his mouth is a wisecrack. No one is that clever and glib all the time. As a result it gives him a lack of depth. Maggie Grace, as the President's daughter, does a good job, and her part is written a bit better. She is the one that has to draw Pearce into a level of responsibility. Peter Stormare is good as Pearce's handler and provides one of the only surprises in the film. Lennie James is Okay but has been much better in other projects. Joseph Gilgun has, by far, the most colorful character in the film. The milky blind eye, tats, thick Scottish brogue and overall crazy demeanor make him a memorable character.

This was no cheap flick. The production values were very high so it surprised me that it sported such a low level script. This is B movie fodder to be sure, but there was still room for a level of writing that was woefully absent. And the ending. That part of a movie that suffers under even the best of circumstances is laughable at best here.

This is a fun watch, so don't get me wrong. I at no time wanted to hit the stop button. Just check your brains at the door and gear up for some testosterone imbued good times.",1352937600,,2329,4.406976744186046

4744524,3,B005LAIHBS,"I decided to watch this on Netflix Streaming (available as of 11/12/12), and expected a dud due to critic and audience reactions; I was pleasantly surprised. Lockout follows Snow as he is convicted of a crime he did not commit and is offered freedom if he rescues the President's daughter from the maximum security space prison MS One, which the prisoners have taken control of. It is a mindless yet enjoyable action film, which may only be enjoyable if you try to turn off your mind for an hour and a half.

First, I enjoy the concept of a space prison and having to conduct a rescue mission. But, the characters and story generally feel formulaic and bland. Snow is a smart alec with plenty of witty responses, but sometimes his lines were clich and boring, and what is supposed to be funny feels forced; he does have some humorous lines and scenes, though. Also, the story is mostly predictable, including the generic ending; you can see it coming from a mile away, cause most blockbuster action films end this way. It really doesn't try anything new, and it doesn't try to separate itself from the horde of other blockbuster action films that release constantly. And, if you think about it, the story only progresses because the characters make stupid decisions over and over. However, if you can get past these flaws, the film does have action from beginning to end; it has edge of your seat chases, and thrilling shootouts. The special effects are mostly great and effective in creating the SciFi-like atmosphere. The acting was good, not bad but not stunning or spectacular either.

Overall, if you can get past the many minor/significant flaws (depending of the type of moviegoer you are), Lockout is a fun, action-packed movie. Recommend for fans of blockbuster action movies.

4744526,4,B005LAIHBS,"Lockout(released April/12)is a mindless,fun space romp with start to finish action,that would give a Die Hard movie a good run for its money. It stars Guy Pearce as Marion Snow,Maggie Grace as Emilie Warnock,Peter Stormare(Fargo) as Scott Langral and others. The story is by the Fifth Element man himself,Luc Besson.
The film opens in 2079 as Snow(a CIA agent)is being interrogated about a briefcase. Snow is a terminal smart butt,who just cannot resist a funny comeback under any circumstances. In a flashback we see the briefcase was thrown on board a subway car to a friend,but Snow has no idea where it is now. Snow in turn had gotten the suitcase from a friend who was murdered and who Snow is now being charged with murdering. Snow is sentenced without a court appearance to 30 years in cryo-stasis on the Earth's newest penal facility;an orbiting space station called M(aximum)S(ecurity)-1.
In tandem with this plot thread is another which involves the president's daughter Emilie,who is visiting the penal facility to inspect it. She has suspicions that the process of actual stasis has much more flaws to it than has been disclosed,especially since much of the money to build and run the station comes from private companies. On one side of a glass partition sits a deranged Irish prisoner,with a guard on either side. On the other side sits Emilie ,with the Warden,who asks about his general condition. When one of the guards gets heavy with the prisoner for being rude,the prisoner grabs a gun from him,which should NOT have been on his person and which he deliberately held from security. This is the pivotal moment,the pebble drop in the pond,and the rest of the film is the wave outwards.
From here the prisoner kills the guards and heads towards the control room,the very place Emilie has fled to. He gets all the cryo-tubes opened and the prisoners start running riot in the cell blocks. It is not too long after they have total control of the facility and are making demands back on Earth.
Snow is released on the condition that he go to the station and rescue the president's daughter. He hitches a ride aboard a space shuttle which has a hostage negotiator aboard. But that soon goes south and Snow is forced to do his thing. The crazy Irish prisoner is soon joined by his brother who takes charge and tries to keep his brother in control,with limited success. After a time the prisoners realize the valuable cargo they have in Emilie and they attempt to fetch her. However Snow gets there first and from then on it is a chase through the station. Along the way the pair find out that indeed some of the prisoners are being used as Guinea pigs. Snow tries to get Emilie on a shuttle for one but she refuses to leave and stays by Snow.
Emilie is captured by the prisoners,and after the crazed Irishman kills all the hostages,and his own brother,he turns on Emilie. But Snow is there to save her and both flee to don two heavy duty space suits. The Earth forces have charged the station and have planted a bomb which is set to detonate within a few seconds. The two leap out of the station and the resultant explosion knocks Emilie unconscious. Falling through the Stratosphere and into the atmosphere Snow gets both of their suits off and he manages to glide them safely to a landing on the off ramp to a highway.
Emilie uses her pull to get Snow exonerated of all charges and the man who sent Snow on his mission and one of his best friends,was the one behind all the intrigue. He of course is arrested,Snow gets the girl,Emilie finds the suitcase which is empty but Snow finds a micro-chip inside a lighter his dead friend had given him with the secrets,and they both walk into the sunset.
From beginning to end an enjoyable romp which will not win an academy award,and which one shouldn't delve into too deeply,lest one see some cracks in the veneer. No,this is simply one of those""I've got a neat story to tell you,listen"",so you sit back and let it tell its tale,which is over before you know it. Well paced with a very likable scoundrel(Snow),Lockout is bound to please the lovers of action and thrills,mixed with a bit of Sci-Fi,in your family.
Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras.
All in all,lovers of action mixed with Sci Fi will like this futuristic fast paced action thriller set in a space station high over the Earth. There is no time to catch your breath or think:just go with the flow and enjoy. 3 1/2-4 stars.",1352505600,,4515,4.6379525593008735

On balance the film is well acted although the writers tried too hard to do a 'Bruce Willis in Space' main character. Fine action sequences (if a bit---errr---unbelievable).

Overall the film is well lit and filmed, and overall offers an entertaining diversion from reality.

Of note is that the ""making of"" additional material is interesting in terms of how to do a lot w/o a lot of money. All of the creative thinking on a budget translated into a film that looks more expensive to produce than it did.

4744608,4,B005LAIHBS,"This action-packed film taking mostly place in outerspace was exactly what I expected  - and what I was looking for. As another reviewer mentioned, this is the kind of film who see, lay back and ""grab the pop-corn (or chocolate, or coke, or whatever you eat or drink when you watch a film...).

The story is not original. As others have mentioned, it is basically ""Escape from New York"" with a new set of actors, the prison set in space rather than New-York, and the President's daughter swaped around for the President himself. There are however a few additional twicks, such as the 500 prisoners being put into stase and this having so rather unpleasant side effects on at least some of them, or some rather nasty things happening to some of the horrible misfits which make up the guineapig population of this space prison. There are indeed references to a number of other similar films as well, many of which are from the 80s and 90s. Outland is one and having the space prison about to crash back onto Earth makes you think of one the Aliens series (the last one, if I remember correctly). As others have also mentioned, there is a bit of ""Die Hard"" in it as well, if only the wisecracking hero who gets bashed about all the time but somehow survives and wins, of course.

The science fiction bits and pieces are rather interesting, even if ""dj vu"", for most of them at least. I liked the space prison's automatic defenses although you cannot help wondering why a space prison would have top notch military defenses as if it was some kind of space fortress. This, however, is precisely what you should NOT start doing: start thinking and wondering whether it makes sense. It does not, or at least not always. Neither is this a wonderful piece of filming with superbly original roles. It is an unpretentious action-packed film with ""goodies"" and baddies"", just in a good old John Wayne cowbow film, except that here we are in space and in 2079.

Please do read other reviews I've written if you think I am some lightweight idiot who has low expectations of my entertainment preferences (no offense to WWE:Smackdown). But every once in a while, a movie just makes me laugh, without sexual references, bad language, and snarky political jokes. Every once in a while, a simple movie that was probably made to BE a simple movie comes along and is just good, clean fun. And Lockout was such a movie. If you read all the reviews here, even if you are a movie snob, please do suspend your expectations, go grab a bowl of popcorn and an ice-cold coke (or beer) and be prepared to be entertained with a simple story which is surprisingly strong in the sci fi genre, NOT the cruel stupidity the recent Syfy network has been throwing at us, which if some people are calling this a grade B movie, would make them grade X by comparison.

I'm not even a big Guy Pierce, Maggie Grace fan. I watched this movie as soon as it hit the Amazon.com streaming line up because I was jonesing for any sci fi story, if only to get the taste of the recent offerings by Syfy out of my mouth. And perhaps THEREIN lies why I really liked this movie. I had no expectations at all.

Guy Pierce plays a prisoner on his way to 30 years in ""cryogenic sleep"" for a crime he didn't commit. As he is being tranported to the prison station in space, the President's daughter, a do-gooder is at the prison making sure the prisoners are being treated with ""respect."" Surprisingly (:-0), the daughter, played quite perfectly by Maggie Grace, is taken hostage by inmates who have revolted and taken over the prison. Snow (Pierce) reluctantly ends up having to defend and *SPOILER ALERT* (who cares?) ultimately defeat the prison revolt and return Emilie (Grace) to her father (the President). It is funny, the CGI is awesome, Maggie Grace is, as I repeat myself, quite awesome, Guy Pierce saves the day as the reluctant hero....wait, you've seen this before? Probably. But you know what? You haven't seen this version. And it sure beats anything I've seen lately, i.e. the sci fi genre. Check it out. And DO check your correctly snobby expectations at the door. You'll enjoy it for what it is and might end up with a good laugh and walk away a little happier for going to the playground and swinging on the swings!",1349654400,2,2545,4.528260869565218
4744678,3,B005LAIHBS,"I am always a fan of sci-fi, thus streamed this film for cheap.  It was made by a Euro-director (Luc Besson) who has done films like Precinct 13? and other wild urban action films.  This time he goes to space and Guy Pearce is the space cowboy.  His lines are worn and his character is goofy, to say the least.  The action moves okay and the special effects are decent, but it does not add up in the long run.

Had an element of ""Big Business"" putting profit ahead of everyone's safety in a egregious manor... who would have thought...

4744682,3,B005LAIHBS,"Really, this movie is more of a comedy than an action movie.  The main character is cracking jokes and doing one-liners all through the film.  Most of it's actually pretty funny.  Still, I kinda felt like he was lacking any real charisma.  The impression he gave me was, ""Tony Stark's annoying little brother.""  But like I said, he was funny most of the time, so I really can't complain.  Then, there's the bad guy's brother who's pretty entertaining just cause he's so effing crazy.

This movie goes way overboard on the CGI at times.  I don't have a problem with CGI, but dude, there's a limit.  Some scenes look like real people walking around in a PS2 game.  There's one part where they're diving down to Earth in these space suits, and I'm thinking, ""How are they going to get through the atmosphere without blowing up?""  Their suits spark up a bit, then the flames die out and they keep falling.  So the atmosphere was pretty much like a firecracker that didn't quite go off.  I was like, ""Dude, what the hell was that?!""

Really, there's just not enough meat to the story.  It's basically ""save the president's daughter in space.""  Some characters do some stuff and then the movie ends.  The bottom line is, it's an okay movie, but nothing to get excited about.  It's alright to rent if you just like to rent movies.  There's nothing really wrong with it, it's just that there's better movies out there.  That said, it's perfectly harmless fun.  If you're into these kinda movies and you're looking for something to watch over the weekend with some friends, this is something to consider.",1349308800,,1595,4.625

Well, clearly, with ""Lockout"", nobody was thinking. At all. It is genuinely, incomprehensively bad on every level.

Apart from the lead characters who actually do a good job in this C-Grade sci-fi action-thriller. Guy Pearce, Maggie Grace and especially Vincent Regan have a lot of fun but the Universe they inhabit is so full of plot holes that it rips the heart out their credibility and if you have even a passing knowledge of sci-fi, your WTF meter will be dinging off the scale:

* Artificial Gravity - WTF?
* A satellite prison where you do your time in statis - WTF?
* Amazing automation that runs the prison, yet they still have Human guards - WTF?
* Hundreds of armed space planes just sitting around waiting for action - WTF?

Whoever is responsible for the dialogue should be laughed out of Hollywood. The constant one-liners are beyond tired and meaningless. Nothing is funny. Nothing is fun. Nothing develops in terms of character or plot. It just sits there being not particularly exciting, in fact it gets worse as the movie progresses.

The action sequence near the beginning uses CGI that is so clearly CGI, it's embarrassing. The subsequent action is uninspired and predictable.

I had to pause it a few times to look for more interesting things to do with my time, and wound up watching the last 20 minutes while playing a game on my phone, that's how entertaining this movie is.

4744885,2,B005LAIHBS,"The gleefully bad Lockout is determined to have a retro look and feel. The film aspires to be a politically incorrect and formulaic B-movie. There is no need to rack your brain over its plot holes. The simple story takes place in the future, when almost everything is dimly lit. While by no means a good film, Lockout is still somewhat entertaining.

While investigating the conditions of a space prison (yes, a prison in space), the president's daughter Emilie (Maggie Grace) finds herself in the middle of a breakout. Officials send ""Snow"" (Guy Pearce), who is on his way to jail or worse after being framed for murder. At least one convict (Joseph Gilgun, clearly having a good time) is inexplicably obsessed with Emilie after spending a few minutes talking to her. Vincent Regan adds a little gravitas as the criminal ringleader Alex, but he, like the rest of these characters, is undeveloped.

Predictably, Snow and Emilie clash. Snow is sarcastic and tough as nails, as well as disrespectful and whiny. He is not particularly likable, but he is funny and has an edge. In the face of certain death, Emilie finds it strangely necessary to try to get to know him. Her character doesn't make sense, but at least she shows a little gumption and compassion. (Grace's expressions are somewhat puzzling, though, since she looks as though she's trying not to laugh through most of the film. Or perhaps she's just unable to hide her attraction to Snow?)

Snow treats her pretty roughly in the name of getting in and out, but their tension is one of the best things about the movie. Much of the acting is quite bad, including Peter Stormare's as the man who insists Snow's guilty. Lennie James is decent as a coworker supposedly on Snow's side, though he, along with everyone else, doesn't really seem to care about the potential deaths of hundreds. The end appears to be a half-baked afterthought, but a lot here is. Sitll, if you want to watch a movie late at night that doesn't take itself too seriously, Lockout isn't necessarily a bad choice.",1347235200,,2042,4.746478873239437

4745042,5,B005LAIHBS,"It's a ""prison hostage escape"" caper set in outer space, but very verbal for all its action,
with a lot of quirky characters, odd accents (one of which, belonging to the most brutal of the
inmates, is all but unintelligible), and a hero (Guy Pearce) who is actually witty. Not just spouting
jests that fall flat (as so often in other films), but genuinely funny, with a dry, trust-no
one sensibility that recalls Steve McQueen and Paul Newman in their youth. Pearce looks great
all pumped up, and his romantic interest is an attractive blonde. Unfortunately, the writer
and director want to establish her as a modern-style ""I'm as tough as any man"" character, which
leads her to be rude and abusive to Pearce even as he's saving her life. Perhaps it's supposed
to be part of the film's comic style. Whatever. But the violence is very, very pronounced, and
if ever there was an argument in favor of capital punishment, this movie's portrayal of the
inmates who take over the prison is that argument. The head of the hostage-takers is cool in
his actions, methodical. The most brutal one is a loose cannon. But both really are as vicious
and evil as anything in a vampire flick.",1347062400,,1176,4.658653846153846

With the tags of ""Luc Besson presents"", ""From the producers of Taken"", and ""Die Hard meets Blade Runner"" you're bound for a smart, thrilling, and probably dystopically lush cinematic ride right?  Wrong.  You are taken for a ride but it isn't smart in the least and is rarely thrilling.  If you've seen the trailer then you know just about everything you need to know about this movie: renegade bad-boy agent Snow goes into earth's orbit to rescue the president's stupid daughter who finds herself trapped on a gulag-style space prison in the middle of a prison escape.  Guy Pearce, an intense and talented actor, doesn't bring anyting to his agent Snow other than snarkiness and flippancy.  And the way he can repeatedly take a punch to the jaw and temple and remain both conscious and coherent has got to qualify him for mixed martial arts!  The main villains here are an unconvincing brother team; the elder brother is the brains and the younger brother is the psychotic blacksheep of the family.  Early on in the movie, before you know of their relationship, you wonder why the elder doesn't take the younger out.  Later in the movie after this plot point has been revealed you still wonder why the elder doesn't take the younger out.  Also, the love ""story"" that develops between agent Snow and the president's daughter is also totally unbelievable (at least in how they screened it) and more than slightly misogynistic.  So with all of this bashing why am I still giving it 3 stars=""it's okay""?  Because despite the letdown it manages a peculiar style and psycho baddie younger brother plays for real but, most of all, because it generates its own winking cheekiness (at least I think it's intentional).",1346889600,,1758,4.803986710963455

4745779,4,B005LAIHBS,"LOCKOUT is one of those rare films that comes along every so often that, despite your brain telling you how ridiculous the film is, you can't help but enjoy the hell out of it. From the mind of former master filmmaker-turned B-actioner mastermind Luc Besson and first-time feature partner directors Stephen St. Leger and James Mather, they do a commendable job with orchestrating the chaos that is this film, which is a mish-mash of different genres, many of which don't cohere but do end up providing some terrific fun. Admittedly, I went into LOCKOUT for the first time with a good deal of apprehension, but the first two minutes of the film and the rather comically brutal interrogation of Snow (Guy Pearce) really helped to seal the deal that I wanted to keep watching regardless of how obviously silly it seemed. In the opening seconds of the film, you have Snow mouthing off to an off-screen interrogator with a cigarette in his mouth; a fist comes from off-screen and punches him in the face and Snow pops back up in his chair with the cigarette now hilariously broken but still in his mouth. This moment is essentially the mood of the film as well as the summation of Snow's character in a nutshell; it's funny and ridiculous and self-aware as well as being rude, sarcastic and tough.

Basically, the film is a blend of DIE HARD in Space with a heaping helping of ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and a dash of AIR FORCE ONE and a sprinkle of CON AIR as we move into the year 2079 where the President's daughter Emilie (Luc Besson's newest chanteuse Maggie Grace) has been taken hostage aboard MS-One, a orbital Super-Max prison where the worst of the worst go, and wrongly-convicted ex-government operative Snow is the one man who can save her. There are several wrinkles in the plan; first among them is that the take-over is being controlled by brothers Alex (Vincent Regan) and Hydell (Joseph Gilgun), one of whom is hopelessly and totally insane. Another is that Snow only agrees to the mission since the person who can help clear his name is on MS-One, so the President's daughter is not his first priority. Another is that Snow's bureacratic adversary Langral (Peter Stormare) is in charge. And last but not least is that since the escape started, MS-One is falling out of orbit and could have the potential to kill thousands if not completely destroyed. So we have the ticking clock combined with the sheltered damsel-in-distress mixed with the lunatics-taking-over-the-asylum blended with the bureaucratic bozos thrown up into a space station. If there are any successful action movie cliches I might have missed in there, don't worry; they pop up ALL OVER THE PLACE.

LOCKOUT starts out with an increasingly-deteriorating action sequence that begins with a simple and cool fight in a hotel room, extends to a pretty nice rooftop sequence but then quickly falls apart with a motorcycle/car/helicopter/foot chase, most of which is against extremely rushed and terribly-unpolished CG which is the centerpiece of this initial chase. It makes you wonder if the visual effects crew is up to the task of creating a visually striking and impressive space station and all that something like that would entail, and it's not a good tone to kick off the action set pieces. But despite myself, I found myself enjoying the cheesy aspects of the bad effects. Again, it sets two tones for the film; one being the emphasis on FAST and the other is that ""I hope you're not expecting AVATAR"". LOCKOUT is not intended to be a big, impressive must-see sci-fi action extravaganza; it's a film based on ""An Idea"" by Besson, who's been behind some of the most implausibly entertaining action films of the last several years, such as KISS OF THE DRAGON, THE TRANSPORTER films, the DISTRICT B13 films and probably the most successful being TAKEN. These films aren't intended, like his 1990's directorial work on LA FEMME NIKITA or LEON THE PROFESSIONAL, to be genre-bending artistic and intelligent action films. This is pure adrenaline and mass entertainment. There's nowhere in the film where you think to yourself, ""Wow, this is a very thoughful action film"". And like Besson's THE FIFTH ELEMENT, it was probably another idea he had when he was 16.

I am not a proponent of the ""Turn Off Your Brain"" excuse when it comes to films that are very simplistic in their character and storytelling, and while some people accuse this film of playing at that, I don't agree. This film does have certain levels of sophistication in some of the sequences concocted by St. Leger and Mather (especially a fun little recurring gag with a ""vocal trigger"" grenade), but also particularly when it comes to the interplay between Pearce as the badass of the film (but who in the film bears more resemblance to BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA's Jack Burton than DIE HARD's John McClane) and Grace as the distressed damsel of the film. The scenes they have together work quite well and you can certainly feel a chemistry despite Snow's attitude. The film also is smart enough to wear its intentions on its sleeve. It has no pretense about it, and that in and of itself is a step in the right direction. Rather than try to overcomplicate a simplistic film, it allows us to bathe in some pretty impressive set pieces, some terrific moments of humor, and pretty much continue to build momentum.

This is hardly Pearce's TAKEN, but I would like to see him in more roles like this because his charisma, talent and his chiseled good looks make for a good action hero. If you've seen Maggie Grace in her time on LOST, this isn't really anything new for you to see. She's very lovely and has some playfulness to her character and good chemistry with Pearce. Joseph Gilgun is the real standout here as the gleefully psychopathic Hydell, who is kind of like The Joker on meth here and Vincent Regan as the older brother is a nice, almost placid counter-balance to Hydell. Stormare doesn't have much to do here other than grimace, but that's his existence in this film.

When you break the film down, once LOCKOUT gets going, it's hardly the level of the now-classic films that it looks to emulate most specifically, like DIE HARD or ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, but if you think this is going to be something other than the simple, fun and dirty little actioner it is, you're going to be terribly disappointed.",1346544000,,6352,4.76043557168784

Completely implausible, but eminently watchable. Full of sci-fi eye candy, snappy dialogue and innovative action. Unrated upgrades the violence and gore.

If you're a nitpicker, skip it. Physics are haywire and common sense is out the door.

But you know, it's the journey. Style can be substantial, even on a thin plot. Production values are superb and the look is right and gritty. Guy Pearce fits the role perfectly in a badass way, and the hate/love relationship with Maggie Grace is right-on. Great performances include the maniac brother and cryo-addled sidekick, and the traitor's monologue (at the end).

Add some killer action scenes and you might catch a ""wow"" under your breath. It's a fun ride.

PS. I nominate Guy Pearce as Altered Carbon's Takechi Kovacs.",1346457600,2,953,6.135338345864661
4745783,5,B005LAIHBS,Lockout is a really cool action movie that everybody needs.  There's no hard plot to follow.  It's just a great action packed sci-fi movie that'll definitely pass the time.  Guy Pearce is a great walking one liner through the whole movie.  This movie is definitely worth your time and money if you're looking for a fun action movie.,1346457600,2,332,4.672413793103448

Don't get me wrong this is not Academy award winning material but if you like action movies...this movie does the trick. Guy Pearce really delivers some great one liners. He(Guy Pearce) reminded me of Bruce Willis and Kurt Russel in Die Hard and Escape from New York respectively.
So, if you are ready to suspend your beliefs and take a leap, it is what it is an action movie with some laughs thrown in for good measure. The only issue that I had was the chase scene near the beginning of the movie. The special effects were very ""fake"" looking. The Blu-ray looked and sounded great and with Amazon's fast delivery it was worth the purchase.
Don't lockout yourself of a little fun on a rainy night...watch Lockout.

4745936,3,B005LAIHBS,"Fans of bad sci fi action will likely enjoy this movie.  I'd give it a 2.5 but you can't give half stars. I'll round up because the movie surprised me a few times with witty moments that brightened up the otherwise lackluster film.  Enough so in fact that I'm sure I'll watch it again someday.
The setup for the story is very simple, good guy gets himself in trouble, has to perform a suicide rescue mission to get out of trouble.  It happens to be set in a giant space jail which adds a few enjoyable twists to the old formula.
The plot itself was barely passable.  The logic pushing the movie along was suspect at times and downright terrible at other times.  The prisoner escape scene that begins the riot is just plain ludicrous.  However, the confused plot still allowed for a good run of action balanced with a slow/funny character development scenes.  And the twist at the end might have been predictable but it raised the bar a bit.
Guy Pierce was the saving grace of the movie, he surprisingly made a great gruff sarcastic soldier.  His one liners were typical, but witty and drew some good laughs.  The other acting was pretty standard bad action movie acting.  Nothing surprising there.
The special effects were a mixed bag.  Some good, some very bad.
So that's that, just know what you're getting into and crack open a few beers or chow down some popcorn while getting in some good laughs/explosions/fun.",1346198400,,1416,4.601593625498008
4745937,1,B005LAIHBS,"Guy Pearce is Snow, a sassy, irreverent CIA agent who is on the outs after being wrongly accused of murder ... in the future! Just before he is sentenced to 30 years of suspended animation in an orbiting Maximum Security space prison, said prison is inexplicably taken over by one inmate who manages to get a hold of a single ankle holster gun. (Maximum security, indeed.) Trapped along with the engineers and other faceless staff of the prison is the American President's daughter. Now the only one crazy enough to try to infiltrate the prison and retrieve the first daughter (as well as -- hopefully -- evidence that will exonerate him) is mouthy Mr. Snow.

The glowing reviews on this site and elsewhere tell readers not to think too hard about the plot. One reviewer who might accuse me of ""artistic snootiness"" writes, ""There are some plot holes and a few maguffins that will leave you scratching your head and wondering why events happened and why characters acted the way they did, but who cares? Have some fun with this romp and let your hair down."" Ah ha! That's my problem. My hair is up. Also, I care if movies have plot holes and inconsistent characters. I guess I'm kooky that way.

Nuts to that. That's like telling me to ""just have fun"" at a magic show when I can clearly see the rabbits trying to escape out of the magician's pants. If you're going to spend twenty million dollars to make a film, wouldn't you want it to be fun to watch AND make even just a small amount of sense? Unfortunately, this film is so teeming with lunacy that only those of you willing to register it on the lowest of brainwaves will have fun watching. I knew I was in trouble the moment the prison was taken over by a single inmate, who gets a single gun, and who manages to release all 499 of the other inmates merely by cracking a scientist's head against a glowing control panel. ""Where are all the guards?"" I wondered. Why does that one gun shoot through that one window, but no other gun in the rest of the movie is able to even crack a pane of glass? Why does this station have automatic weapons that track and destroy spacecraft with the touch of a single, large, glowing silver button, but its orbit requires constant human reconfiguration or it falls out of the sky within an hour? Well, it IS a governmental building, I guess.

The only fun to be had is in Pearce's acting. His character is no different than any other Will Smith/Bruce Willis hybrid you've seen before, but at least the seasoned actor appears to be having fun with his role. That's better than can be said for the wooden, one-note performances you get from virtually every single other character, with the biggest transgressor being the President, who appears to have taken his acting lessons from cold toast. Everything else, from the story to the characters to the canned dialogue to the hyper-frenetic editing is just one clumsily executed cliche after another. Even cliches can be fun, but when they are delivered with this kind of halfhearted awkwardness, they are less fun than embarrassing and -- eventually -- annoying.

And hey, don't listen to those people who tell you to ""just have fun."" Perhaps they haven't heard of ""Moff's Law."" I quote, ""[W]hen you go out of your way to suggest that people should be thinking less -- that not using one's capacity for reason is an admirable position to take ... you are not saying anything particularly intelligent. And unless you live on a parallel version of Earth where too many people are thinking too deeply and critically about the world around them and what's going on in their own heads, you're not helping anything..."" There are a lot of cheesy, enjoyable action films out there that aren't so ludicrously rife with poor writing, directing, and acting, and there's a big difference between ""letting down your hair"" and putting up with crap just because it's loud, fast, sparkly and on fire. Even those of you who are only looking for a rip-roaring, high-octane, one-liner fest can do a WHOLE lot better than this weak excuse for a film.",1346198400,,4066,4.627423822714682

Actually there are few movies these days that make me feel that way. So I'm happy to report that the movie, just released on DVD, is well worth that $8 and more. No, it's not LAWRENCE OF ARABIA but it does offer plenty of entertainment for your money.

The year is 2079 and Guy Pearce is Snow, an ex-CIA agent caught in a trap where an old friend was killed but not before passing him a briefcase. Snow escapes with the briefcase but only enough time to pass it on to his friend Mace. Caught by the new agent in charge Scott Langrel (Peter Stormare), Snow is unwilling to give up any information and quickly sentenced to 30 years in stasis (frozen) on the newest prison rotating in space above the Earth.

Before he can get there though things happen. Emilie Wornock (Maggie Grace), the daughter of the President, is at the space station looking things over to make sure there are no civil rights violations going on. The group she works with is looking into illegal activity taking place there, experimentation on the inmates. To interview one he must be ""thawed"" as all prisoners are encapsulated in their cells. During this interview he takes a gun from the Secret Service man assigned to Emilie (that he snuck in) and begins to set free all the prisoners.

A rescue mission is set up to save the President's daughter but her chances of survival are slim. In steps Harry Shaw (Lennie James), a friend of Snow's who's been trying to help him and get information from him. He suggests that Snow is the only person alive who can be snuck onto the orbiting station and rescue Emilie without harm. Put in place as a back up plan the first attempt to rescue her fails and he heads in.

Via a tracking chip on Emilie Snow is directed to her location and tries to save her but it thwarted by her Secret Service agent. He gets around this eventually and tries to help her. While this is going on one of the worst prisoners, Alex (Vincent Regan) takes charge and sets about negotiating with those in charge for her release. Alongside him is his brother Hydell (Joseph Gilgun), a totally mad screw up who finds more pleasure in killing people than negotiations. These two along with some of the most deadly men to ever walk the Earth are now searching for Snow and Emilie with one purpose in mind: escape.

If that wasn't enough plot for you consider this extra. Mace is now imprisoned on the space prison too. Snow needs to find the briefcase he entrusted to him before he was caught to take down the bad guys that framed him and killed his friend. All he has to do is find him among the 500 or so insane criminals now set free while saving the President's daughter at the same time.

Many of the ideas found in this movie could have resulted in a truly bad low Z grade movie. But the cast, crew and writers up the ante and make it more fun than you would think possible. With the exception of a not too realistic CGI motorcycle chase, the effects are top notch. Everything from explosions to space situations seem real.

The thing that makes this work more than anything though is the acting by Pearce and Grace in their roles. Snow is a smart aleck, self assured, one man force who has the ability to save the seemingly pampered President's daughter. Emilie is the naive young woman who thinks she knows what's going on but clearly has no clue. When you couple the two together they both learn something, though Snow seems more in line to teach than learn.

The pacing is fast and furious and shot fantastically so that you catch it all on the screen. The concept of a rescue mission is well thought out even if the plans to make it happen fall apart over and over again. This movie is pure popcorn flick of the week and takes you on a ride that delivers on all accounts. I've always said that the first purpose of a movie should be to entertain.

I enjoyed everything about the film except for a poor CG chase scene.  It was a terrible sequence and should have been left on the cutting room floor.  Other than that this film had it all, great one liners, great action and even a little romance.  I can't believe I'm going to say this but I enjoyed it a lot more than Prometheus.

4746356,4,B005LAIHBS,"I enjoyed this movie.  I typically lose interest if the film has too much action, in part, because I watch on a computer and do not own a TV. On my screen the scenes filmed in dark are very hard to see. Adept cinematography and lighting let me see this action.  The credits state that this is from an original idea by Luc Besson.  Luc is a good film maker but this is hardly an original idea.  It is very much like the John Carpenter  ""Escape From...."" franchise.  Guy Pierce gets to be the Snake Pliskin character.  He even smokes and makes Pliskin like jokes.  Maggie Grace is a sassy first daughter who needs rescuing from crazed prisoners on a space station isolated in orbit.  The bad guy from Fargo plays the bad guy from Washington.  The villains from the space station are over the top nasties.  A good group of characters smashing and bashing with good special effects.  I had a fine time.  And you....yeah you who is going to check this review as not helpful because you did not like the movie and think you are the only one who's opinion counts.  Knock it off.

Well no, but then again few films are.  My all time favorite movie is Die Hard, so expecting anything else to be better than that is expecting a bit much. However, I did enjoy this action thriller.  As my title says, I really think having a super good villian on par with Hans Gruber would have greatly helped this film.  The bad guys were okay, but just did not radiate the cool calm evil that Hans did in Die Hard.  As others have posted, sometimes events were a little bit too much, but the action and humor (one liners) made up for that.  Since I rented this movie my time expires later tonight.  I think I will invite my son over and see if he wants to watch it on my big HDTV via the PS3 before my ""time is up"".  At $0.99 Amazon almost forced me to rent this movie.

I think the idea behind Lockout had potential to make a great movie, but it missed the mark on the character development.  The only person that really had any character development was Snow (Guy Pierce).  While he is the most important character in this movie there was still no emotional connection.  When the good guy gets kicked, we should be cheering for him to get back up, but I don't think we got to know Snow well enough to care.  As for the damsel in distress, she was a little too unappreciative of the 'intersteller' assistance to care about.  She came across more annoying than anything.  The movie was rushed.  At just over 90 minutes long there could have easily been longer.  One example of this would be the fact that we really didn't see any of Snow's journey into space.  One second he was on earth and then 'bam', he was in a space suit attached to some sort of shuttle ready to secretly board the orbiting prison.

4746455,3,B005LAIHBS,"I watched this film with a fair amount of expectation after hearing about it from a few people who went on and on telling me about how it was a glorious throwback to all those great action movies of the '80s and '90s. Unlike The Expendables, this film was supposed to devoid of meta-humor or irony, which was a refreshing idea, frankly. After all, the best B-movies in history were not made by people *trying* to make B-movies. So I rented it, settled in and rooted for Guy Pearce and co. to transport me back to the good old days...

Let me start off by pointing out what the film does (mostly) right:

1) It gives us the prerequisite badass antihero complete with mysterious past and snappy one-liners.

Aaaand that's about it. Seriously, Guy Pearce's character is the only reason to think about seeing this movie. He's tough, cynical, sarcastic, professional. Too bad he's all there is to it. And to top it off, the one thing he's supposed to excel at in the movie--the action--is an incoherent mess. Within the first five minutes, there's a terrible CGI sequence that moves so fast, you don't even get the sense that anything's at stake. One thing that many so-called B-movies had (and I'm thinking of the good older ones directed by guys like John Carpenter, George Cosmatos and Joseph Zito, to name a few) was spatial coherence: you knew where everything was in a scene, where every explosion was coming from, what was at stake. Lockout, unfortunately, goes for the modern action movie method where everything moves way too fast and there's no sense of spatial logic. There is some decent gunplay in the space prison, but nothing spectacular, and not much in the way of hand-to-hand combat. What the movie's really missing is one terrific, memorable action setpiece, something that most of the films Lockout is borrowing from managed to have.

People have described this as a blend of Escape From New York and Blade Runner. Well, the prison setting here isn't as interesting as in Escape (and really, how could it be), and whatever dystopian future exists in Lockout is too limited by the film's low budget to compare with Blade Runner's far-reaching exploration of 2019 L.A.  The main villains are interesting, but for all their antics, they never seem to rise above the level of minor inconvenience, and they're not all that memorable. Nobody here is going to make people forget Isaac Hayes as the Duke.

I wanted to love this movie, I really did. But at the end of the day, all we've got is one sharp lead performance surrounded by a bunch of mediocre action and CGI junk. Lockout is a B-movie among B-movies, and no, that's not a compliment.",1343433600,,2651,4.702586206896552
4746456,4,B005LAIHBS,Not a bad action flick. Didn't watch it for the script watch it for the action and it delivered. Plot was good enough to watch the entire movies,1343347200,,144,4.178571428571429
4746457,2,B005LAIHBS,"This is one of those movies that you pretty much know what to expect and that's pretty much what you get.  A bulked up Guy Pearce takes the lead as Snow, a former government agent who has been accused of espionage and murder.  I didn't know CIA/Secret Service agent were so funny but the film's writers give Snow plenty of one-liners which does have its charm.  Maggie Grace is the babe in jeopardy.  Emilie is also the do-gooder daughter of the U. S. President and is in space on the world's largest and only orbiting penal colony.

It has been very successful because all the prisoners are put in a state of suspended animation known as stasis.  In 2089, this appears to be a pretty effective way of dealing with bad guys.  While interviewing one of the most vile and ugliest criminals in the prison, Hydell (Joseph Gilgun) manages to grab a gun from one of Emilie's bodyguards.  All of the prisoners are then uncaged and the predictable fun begins.  One of the first things that all of these just freed convicts does is get into fights with each other.  Ridiculous.

Back at Secret Service headquarters, Snow has been chosen to infiltrate the prison and get Emilie out.  He agrees because he needs to find the location of a mysterious briefcase that was given to an accomplice.  That accomplice is also in the prison.  Now if I'm the prez and I have all these Navy Seal types at my disposal, is my first choice a suspected spy and murderer?  I don't think so, but off he goes.  Like numerous other films (think ""Die Hard""), Snow must navigate the inner passages of the prison aided by some scientific mapsters on the base station.

The film looks good most of the time but there are clearly evident overuses of green/blue screen trickery on some of the interior shots.  This was an unrated version but I'm not sure what was added or deleted.  While there are plenty of sexual references there is no sex or nudity.  I suspect a few more deaths are depicted although none are overly graphic.  While the film follows the playbook of a ""B"" movie, it's not horrible.  That's not saying much, is it?

If you're on the fence as to whether to watch this movie, the way you watch it might make a difference.  This Sony Blu ray transfer is in  a word, spectacular in every respect.  The 1080p transfer has a 2.39:1 aspect ratio and is of demo quality.  Everything looks great.  Black space against an orbiting prison is perfect.  Close ups look good as well.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  Likewise it's superb.  You will have perfectly centered dialog and the film's actions sequences, including some space fighter jets, will keep all your speakers jumping including the LFE channel.",1343347200,2,2686,4.589473684210526
4746458,3,B005LAIHBS,"The prison takeover film has been a Hollywood staple for decades and Lockout runs with the formula with the only real snippet of originality being that the prison is set in space.  It is the year 2079, and CIA agent Marion Snow (Pearce) is framed for the murder of another agent who was investigating stolen government secrets.  Snow is sentenced to 30 years in prison at MS One, a maximum security prison set on a floating space satellite where prisoners are kept in a cryogenic stasis.

Before his sentence can be carried out, however, Snow is given a chance at a reprieve.  The prisoners have broken out aboard MS One and have taken several people hostage, including Emilie, the daughter of the President, who was on the satellite on a humanitarian mission investigating the well-being of the prisoners.  Snow is initially reluctant to take on the mission until he learns that Mace, the man he gave the briefcase containing information that could clear him, is aboard the prison as well.  More determined to find the case rather than rescue Emilie, Snow sneaks onto the vessel to find it overrun with the most dangerous prisoners on the planet, led by Alex, and his psychotic kill-crazy brother Hydell.

The entire pretext for the prison breakout is incredibly flimsy...First the daughter of the President going into such a dangerous location with little more than a couple of Secret Service agents.  Then the whole idea of the warden unfreezing perhaps the most mentally unhinged prisoner out of some 500 total is ludicrous.  It would be like someone going to Corcoran Prison in California to check on prisoners and the warden wheels out Charlie Manson.  And of course one of the Secret Service agents are dumb enough to sneak a gun into the interview room even though they were supposed to check all weapons.  Now remember, this is supposed to be 67 years in the future...So what, they stopped using metal detectors and Backscatter X-ray machines in 2079 and now just take guys words that they are unarmed?  Right...

I've been a fan of Guy Pearce ever since Ravenous and have always enjoyed his performances, but he seems to be trying to channel a combination of Snake Plisken from Escape from New York and John McClane from Die Hard with his performance.  He forces one bad one-liner after another and ends up being more of a parody of action heroes than an actual action hero.  Thankfully Pearce is bailed out by a solid supporting cast including Maggie Grace as Emilie, and Peter Stromare as Langral, the head of the Secret Service.

The action in Lockout is wildly inconsistent.  On one hand the prison has an automated defense system of Death Star like gun turrets that are able to repel the aircraft of security forces that Langral sends in to re-take the prison.  On the other hand, Snow is able to escape at least a half dozen times from prisoners just by running through a door and closing it behind him.  Why is it he seems to be able to operate all the doors and the prisoners can't?  Lockout is a futuristic film but it didn't have the budget ($20 million) to truly pull off a futuristic look.  This unrated edition amps up the violence a little bit but this could still really pass for a PG-13 film.

Ultimately, Lockout is a middle of the road actioner that provides a mild diversion but is completely forgettable.",1343260800,,3334,4.712068965517242

No plot spoilers from me: Set in a future where criminals are placed in cryogenic sleep and are warehoused in an orbiting prison. The story follows CIA agent ""Snow"", who has been falsely accused of murder but is given the chance to redeem himself by rescuing an important hostage from the prison. The plot is fairly straight forward, with a few twists, and has decent special effects, but this is mainly an action flick with a lot of snarky one liners. The actors are all well cast for their parts and there are actually a few memorable rolls.

This goes into my lazy weekend movie list since it is one of those that can be rewatched and enjoyed anytime.

Now for my rant! warning bit of spoiler in it.

Why do they seem to spend ZERO dollars on writers and people with some science and/or physics knowledge?  This movie cost more the $20 million to make, spending $500,000 more to get people to make it more believable would have made this a A movie.  I mean seriously, anyone who's had a high school education, maybe just grade school knows how much BS physics there is in this movie.  Even little things like the ""automated defense guns"" don't make sense.  First its automatic, next they have to press a button, next it lets ships dock, next its shooting other ships.....HUH?  It has the feel of a 5 year old coming up with parts of the story.  ""Well you see their running...and then..and then  a space station crashes into them!!!""  ""YAH""  ""And then the bad guys get really, really mad...oh and he has a scar..yah and well anyway then.....""  So that's what I had narrating to me in the back of my mind.  Future tech kinda sucked as well, didn't these guys watch any sci-fi movies before making this?  Red planet had some cool ideas, better then this.

Disappointingly not so - Guy Pearce is just perfect in this role, and the writing of his character is excellent, but it does nothing to save this poor effort of a movie.

This isn't really a 'leave your brain at the door' experience, it's just a ridiculous story with moment after moment that is just beyond implausible.  Even accepting the silly premise, you still have things in most scenes that make you roll your eyes - the screenwriting uses the most basic devices and almost everything is a leap of faith which stretches way too far very early on.  And then there's Maggie Grace, playing a helpless daughter that needs to be rescued... really?

Forgive the chase scene on the road with its PC-game graphics, and the obvious Star Wars drop the bomb in the tunnel scene, and forgive a few of the missing frames to help finish the thought...these errors move so fast, you don't dwell on them before the next action and laughs have you distracted.

but then comes the end which is utter crap. They fall out of an exploding space station in space suits that fall apart and turn into skydiver suits. Then it tries to be really clever by putting a spin on why Guy was in trouble in the first place but does it in a way that doesnt connect to the rest of the movie and seems incredibly rushed.

Its a 3.5 but they don't allow that so the directors utter lack of knowledge about physics in space (i.e. theres no atmosphere in space and therefore no sound in vacuum) pushes it down to a 3.

4746707,3,B005LAIHBS,"After all the negative reviews, I almost avoided this little gem altogether. I rented it, watched it, and enjoyed it so much I purchased it on blu ray and watched it again. For those looking for a light-hearted action flick that pays homage to classic 80's action films like ""Escape From New York"" and ""Die Hard"" while never taking itself too seriously- ""Lockout"" is incredibly entertaining.

Plot in a nutshell: covert government agent Snow is falsely accused of murder and sentenced to 30 years in a maximum security prison set in outer space where the prisoners spend their time in a cryogenically frozen sleep. Just before being shipped off to serve his time, the President of the United State's daughter (who conveniently happens to be doing humanitarian work at that same prison) is taken hostage by the inmates. Snow must go in and rescue the President's daughter before time runs out...

While there's little to nothing original about ""Lockout,"" it is a very enjoyable movie with a terrific comic book atmosphere and tone. Our anti-hero is ""Snow"", wonderfully played by Guy Pearce. Snow is a wise-cracking smartass whose one-liners are biting and humorous. When he's not kicking someone's ass, someone is probably kicking his. He always gets into situations that are over his head and he never walks away unscathed. Fight scenes always go back and forth- he dishes it out and he takes it in return- and it's fun watching to see how he manages to get himself out of these bad situations.

Obviously, the movie missed its mark with a lot of people and critics in general. If you are looking for a serious, high-brow sci-fi thriller, then I advise staying far away from this movie! If you enjoy brainless action flicks that go great with pizza and a 12-pack (like ""Blade"", ""Death Race"" and ""Doomsday"") then I highly recommend ""Lockout."" If you prefer your action a bit more serious-minded like ""Taken"" - probably not so much.

Pros:
  - The movie is deeply drenched in a comic book atmosphere and tone that keeps it light and energetic.
  - Guy Pearce's snarky performace as Snow is funny, obnoxious and very entertaining.
  - The action sequences (particularly shoot outs and fist fights) are well done and bloodier than the
  PG-13 theatrical version- although the running time for both un-rated and theatrical are the same (95
  minutes) the action is jacked up a notch or two compared to the PG-13 counterpart.
  - Some of the CGI for the prision and space ships are nicely done.
  - Wonderfully paced- never a slow moment in the movie, highly entertaining from start to finish.

Cons:
  - The CGI used in the motorcycle chase scene at the beginning of the film are rather horrific. However, I
  also feel that it adds to the movie's overall cheesy charm.
  - A few acting scenes by minor characters are pretty bad: particularly the scene when the president is told
  that his daughter is taken hostage by the most ruthless criminals alive- he may as well have been told
  that his ham sandwich had mustard on it instead of mayonaisse.

Again, If you are looking for a serious, high-brow sci-fi thriller ala ""Minority Report"" or ""Blade Runner"", then I advise staying far away from this movie! If you're looking for a brainless but entertaining action flick to wash away a hard day with a 12-pack of your favorite beer- then I highly recommend ""Lockout.""

Guy Pearce is hilarious and teamed up with Maggie Grace the laughs just keep rolling. It is an action, sci-fi, comedy that is amazingly well crafted if you can take your thinking cap off and just have fun. There are a few plot twists, but nothing you didn't see coming. While Lockout doesn't really bring anything completely new to the table, it is very entertaining and well worth multiple viewings.

Due to mixed reviews I did not expect much, but Lockout really impressed me with its style and fast paced action.

4746786,3,B005LAIHBS,"So, two of the other reviews struck me.  One said closer to a 2 than a 4, and I have to agree - not ready to give it a 2 star ""Didn't Like"", but feel unsatisfied giving it a 3 star ""OK"".  The acting was ok - actually liked Maggie Grace, a lot - a cut above your average damsel in distress.  As far as Guy Pierce's Snow, another review said they were reminded of Jack Burton from Big Trouble in Little China, but whereas Kurt Russell was playing something of a blow hard in that film, Snow in this film is more like a Bruce Willis Character (I'm thinking more Joe Hallenbeck from the Last Boy Scout,  than John McLane) ...  although this felt a bit more of a caricature than a character.  Or maybe Bruce Willis is better at acting hurt as he is cracking wise while having the crap beat out of him.  Getting hit in the face like that messes you up, and to have an ""Oh-Come-On"" moment come so early in the film sets a bad tone.

I am surprised no one saw the resemblance to another  Kurt Russell movie - Escape from New York.  Pretty sure the writers have seen that one.  Now THAT movie is looking a little old these days, and could do with a re-boot, and when I saw this I was seriously expecting that.

Now ... Spoilers ...

... here is where I have a problem with the film.  Snow is still working a case he was helping a friend with, even though it crashed and burned resulting the friend dying and Snow being charged with his murder.  In fact there is something strange about his arrest in that it is pretty apparent that he is being framed, but by who?  He agrees to rescue Emilie, the President's daughter, so that he can look for his partner who has been locked up on the space station for shooting a police officer after stashing some important evidence - but we don't know evidence of what.  Emilie is looking into corporate corruption and experimentation on humans in the space prison, and during the romp through the bowls of the prison they find pretty firm proof that is exactly what is going on.  They get off the station before it is blown up (did I mention that it was falling towards the eastern seaboard of the United States?  So somehow the last 15 minutes of Star Wars is played out in the movie with fighters attacking the prison and being shot down by automated gun turrets as they try to land a time bomb at a critical location on its surface ... guided missiles and smart bombs are too old fashioned in the near future I guess), and upon landing Snow is cuffed and thrown into jail .... I am not sure why the President didn't pardon him for saving his daughter, but that isn't a major problem ... what bugs me is that Emilie finds the case that Snow was looking for, but its empty - and Snow tricks the traitor into revealing himself.  ""Did they pay you well?""  he asks (WHO????  Who is they????) ..... and then some pointless dialog  ... the girl catches up to him ... some more dialog and the credits.  Oh, and he finds a chip in the dead friends lighter which could have all sorts of information on it ... or porn - we will never know, cause the writers couldn't be bothered with the simple task of tying up the loose ends.

It was sloppy.  They could have tied all the story lines together with 2 or three more lines of dialog and provided resolution to everything, say maybe chip turns out to hold information on the corrupt corporation that runs the prison - that's what Snows friend was working on and what the traitor was being paid to bury - then Emilie could finish what she was working for ... but no - they couldn't be bothered .... this slacking off on story while throwing in gratuitous special effects bugs the heck out of me.

Pffft.  Oh well, maybe someone will bring Snake Plisskin back.",1342569600,7,3726,4.276747503566334
4746787,4,B005LAIHBS,"Guy Pearce has the charisma to carry almost any movie.  B-grade sci-fi adventure set aboard an orbiting prison?  Sure, why not?  Indeed, LOCKOUT is a thoroughly enjoyable romp, and it's almost entirely because of Guy Pearce's wisecracking machismo.  It's a role that's borrowed from countless films before it; and like the best of those, it comes across as completely authentic, lending a likability to a film that doesn't have a whole lot else to offer that's new or refreshing.

The plot is simple: the president's daughter (Maggie Grace, going beyond the damsel-in-distress stereotype) gets caught aboard said orbiting prison right before a massive prison riot.  Our hero--named simply Snow--is given a choice: go to prison for life, or rescue the First Daughter.  Snow's motivations for accepting the mission are ambiguous at first, but away he goes, to face off against a pair of evil brothers (Vincent Regan and Joseph Gilgun).  Of course, there are complications: the prison is basically falling out of the sky, meaning, unless the Eastern Seaboard is to become one giant burning graveyard, the structure will have to be blown apart...with or without Snow and his ward aboard.

The special effects aren't the greatest; they go from impressive to video game quality fairly quickly.  The action is quick and intense; much of it is meaningless, but that should be expected.  Gilgun's unpredictably psychotic Hydell is a nice change of pace from the normal mastermind villain (represented here by a stony Regan).  Peter Stormare gives a nicely ambiguous turn as a government agent.  But again, the heart here is Pearce, who rocks through the action sequences, quips a one-liner that is genuinely amusing, shoots another bad guy, and ultimately saves the day and the girl (though the girl is capable of saving herself, thank you very much).  LOCKOUT isn't the greatest sci-fi/action B movie ever made, but it's certainly one that'll pop up on cable every now and then, and if you happen to tune in, you won't be able to help but watch it again.",1342569600,,2046,5.014792899408284

Prisoners sealed in suspended animation at a space station getting an untimely release has great potential. Unfortunately the very good sets and decent stunts are only filler for real acting and a cohesive plot.

It appears much time , energy and money was put into the explosive action scenes but it just can't carry the film. Another reviewer mentioned ""suspending belief"". I would say completely detaching your cereberal cortex is an advisable step towards the viewing process. If this is a B movie, it's the most elaborate one I've seen. Another odd thing is that I was transported in my easy chair back to the decade of the 90s as I watched the suave anti establishment savior attempt to rescue the unsure and resistent female.

A guess I should have been clued in when the movie dug up old films like ""Die Hard"" & ""Blade Runner"" to use as jacket art promos. Maggie Grace plays the presidents daughter who whispers her way through the film as you can almost invision her acting coach nearby. I really hope I don't see her in another film.

 If you do find any humor it is of the old 80s ""Romancing the Stone"" style. I would equate the movie with a sci fi channel re run that never takes off but adds one more violent scene in hopes of holding ones interest.

""Lockout"" is entertaining and very self aware that its derivative having fun with the films it ""borrows"" from coming across like a hyperactive adolescent. It's not deep nor does it pretend to be.

CIA operative Snow (Pearce)finds himself falsely convicted of committing espinonage amd headed towards a new space prison. When the president's daughter Emilie(Grace) during an investigational visit is taken hostage after the prisoners are thawed out, Snow finds himself in the unique position of being the only person that could possibly save her from a psycho prisoner (Joseph Gilgun) and his brother (Vincent Regan).

The visual effects range from exceptionally good to just a step above a video game (the bike chase opening sequence)but given the small budget for this film ($20 million) ""Lockout"" LOOKS pretty impressive overall.

The Blu-ray looks terrific--blacks are inky, detail is amazingly rich and the image quality remains sharp throughout the presentation.

Audio kicks butt--it's powerful and uses the surround speakers quite well.

The special features are disappointing. We don't get any commentary track (I'd love to hear from Pearce and Grace on shooting the film in Serbia and the issues they had)we do get two featurettes on the creation of the film including ""Breaking into Lockout"" a behind-the-scenes glimpse with bits and pieces of animatics, green screen unfinished studio footage and an interview with Stephen Saint Leger co-writer/co-director. Pearce and Grace also chime in discussing their characters.

""A Vision of the Future"" gives us a peak behind the design and look of the film. We get interviews with the production designer as well as a discussion of the visual effects design.

There are also quite a few previews but no trailer for this film included.

While ""Lockout"" isn't deep, it's a fun thrill ride. If you can overlook the large gaps in logic, the large amount of coincidence and plot holes, you'll enjoy ""Lockout"" as the tongue-in-cheek thrill ride it is. Pearce is the real reason to watch the film and his cynical, humorous take on Snow is a variation on John Carpenter's Snake Plisken. The Blu-ray looks marvelous.",1342483200,2,3387,6.25107296137339

Unless egos have seriously dropped in Hollywood, laughably unlikely, the credit and/or failing goes to Co-Directors James Mather and Stephen St. Leger.

Not sure how, beyond a co-writing and non-executive producer credit, Besson was remotely involved with this project?

Interesting.

A decently fun flick that delivers what it promises. However, the plot holes in 'Lockout' are fairly numerous, enough to distract from making this a solid plus in the genre.

Per the standard requisite for male actors nowadays, Pierce really packed on the muscle for the role and honestly looks fantastic. Appreciated that the co-directors allowed the character to casually wear the weight without having to resort to a shirtless scene, which can be tacky if delivered out of context, and presumably only for female exhortation. Clearly, this isn't a chick flick.

What also lessened my appreciation is that I'm not a fan of Maggie Grace. First viewed in tv's '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost/dp/B00005JNOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost</a>' and followed her career through various roles. And truthfully, I haven't screened a production where I felt she captured her character, bringing it to life or challenging viewers with a strong interpretation. This role is no exception. Pretty much another walk-through static effort. Unsure if this is a directorial issue or one of thespian inability. I feel there's a spark of the craft somewhere in there, and she showed a bit of it in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fog/dp/B002PNKX48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fog</a>', but I have yet to see it revealed on a big stage.

As mentioned previously, there were quite a few plot incongruities and meandering threads.

Examples:

- It's never made clear whether the President is a deeply caring father willing to do what it takes to save his daughter; or if he's a disinterested spectator as suggested by Maggie's character, Emilie, who implies he's a shallow opportunist willing to sacrifice everything for political capital. As President Warnock showcases both positions, that made the high-risk rescue seem completely empty, with no real authority or sense of urgency, but simply an excuse to throw in CGI battle scenes.

- And speaking of which, the rescue itself was ill conceived. Lack of any military experience showing here - as there's no breach team. At least not one that's either indicated by the National Intelligence Director or by simply filming them preparing for their mission. Fifteen seconds of film would have been all it took for either scenario, allowing us a semblance of a fully developed plot.

- Minor spoilers, but the sidestory of Mace and The Briefcase seemed rather pointless given that we're never privy to the true impact of the contents. We don't need to know what's in the case, but we do need a better sense of how it plays into the overall main plot. Since it apparently doesn't - there's no satisfactory resolution from a viewer's perspective.

-  If the math is correct, what was the deal with the other 490-something prisoners? Other than beating the crap out of the jailhouse rats - what were they doing besides standing around? Weren't any of them interested in, you know, attempting to make their own escape?

Anyway, again a decent update of John Carpenter's work, with Guy Pierce doing a pretty decent Snake Plissken. I like to think another Mace Snow adventure is possible, but Box Office Mojo's tally numbers seem to suggest otherwise. Unfortunate. They did a pretty bang-up job with only $20 million in the budget.

Personal Note: I'm a monster fan of both character actors Peter Stomare and Lenny James, so I was very pleased to see the pair on the big screen.",1341619200,,4178,5.406153846153846

4747085,2,B005LAIHBS,"Luc Besson (""The Professional"") is known internationally as a masterful screenwriter, director and producer of witty, gritty action flicks. As a result, this Besson-written and produced PG-13 film is specifically for fans of witty gritty action flicks! We see non-stop action with no sweaty bodies, no profanity, lots of grit, gunfire and blowie uppie stuff, and as for wit... the flimsy plot is laughable.

As expected in a Besson flick, we are quickly thrown into a (CGI) action-filled opening sequence in an unnamed city; the remainder of the witty gritty action takes place in a high-security prison facility orbiting Earth. Prisoners are placed in stasis and ""stored"" for the duration of their sentences. Problem is, they are hard-core offenders and the lengthy suspended animation tends to cause mental disorders. This means by the time they revolt and take over the prison, most of them are bonkers.

These witty, gritty folks try to make it happen:
  * Guy Pearce (""The King's Speech"") is witty as Snow, wrongfully convicted of espionage, sent to retrieve information about a mysterious briefcase which seems to contain something important. Some of his terse one- and two-word responses made me laugh out loud.
  * Vincent Regan (""Snow White and the Huntsman"") is gritty as Alex, leader of the prison rebellion. He is NOT witty.
  * Maggie Grace (""Knight and Day"") is pretty as Emilie, a doctor trying to investigate the effects of stasis on the prisoners; she is taken hostage. Oh, she is also the daughter of the President.

If you get the DVD from Amazon.com, you'll see that much of the action consists of running through dark metallic corridors, dodging bullets, ducking through airlocks, and climbing up ductwork. It gives you ample time to admire Guy Pearce's newly bulked-up body; it makes him look like one of the Wahlbergs. Not a bad thing...

Did I mention there is a LOT of action? And wit? And grit?",1335657600,,1920,4.971875
4747086,3,B005LAIHBS,"- Emilie Warnock, the President's daughter (when apprised that his dad had deployed Snow): ""Did he leave a message for me?""
- Snow: ""Yeah, you're adopted.""

Luc Besson, French purveyor of fanciful adventure cinema, in his long career has treated his movie-going audiences to enough thrills that surely we can forgive him his occasional fumble. Not every venture could be as delectable as THE FIFTH ELEMENT or TAXI or DISTRICT B13. Every now and then - okay, check out this forced imagery - he'll mine his belly button of inspiration and come up with nothing but old lint. So relish LOCKOUT as diverting fluff. Australian actor Guy Pearce gets a chance to play the scruffy, mouthy action hero part. Except that I lay you odds Snake Plissken or John McClane can chew him up and spit him out.

In the near dystopian future, a few decades from now, a disillusioned ex-government agent named Snow (Pearce) is framed for murder and sentenced to cryogenic statis on M.S. One, an outer space maximum-security penitentiary orbiting Earth. And on M.S. One, Emilie Warnock (Maggie Grace), idealistic daughter of the 56th American President, is visiting on a goodwill tour when the convicts are mysteriously released from their suspended animation, and so cue the mass rioting and an explosion of orange. This then grants Snow a last moment reprieve. For certain considerations from the government, Snow is tasked with infiltrating M.S. One on a suicidal one-man rescue operation. Except that Snow, not really all that patriotic, is fueled by an ulterior motive.

LOCKOUT spotlights actors who aren't (yet) top drawer, but that's okay, for the most part. The story is constructed around an old premise - the prison breakout - and embellished with that outer space twist. There's a nice grungy vibe to the film, probably because most of the action takes place on the floating prison populated by criminals suddenly run amok. But even on the ground, we get a peek at the submerged Oval Office, transformed into an underground bunker, and we understand that this world has gone to crap. Just maybe, Snow is entitled to his subversive attitude.

On board the prison, Snow's mission immediately fubars, primarily because his sneak tactics aren't exactly at ninja levels. In a way, it makes the film more interesting because it underscores how vulnerable and unprepared Snow is. He's no master spy. He's no precise tool. He's a clumsy sledgehammer. While capable and gutsy enough, his actions are dictated more by the whims of outside forces rather than his clear vision and ability to impressively execute operations. He can improvise a bit.

It's a story that presents intriguing selling points, but, ultimately, it fails to deliver on them payoff moments. If you've seen one DIE HARD variant, you've pretty much seen them all. Dampening my enthusiasm even more is Guy Pearce's overwritten character, in the sense that the writers have overindulged with the wisecracks. Snow throws out so many one-liners (only some of which are funny), and so frequently, that it undermines the plot. But, hey, not everyone can be as on point as John McClane. And even McClane launched his quips in moderation.

As much as Maggie Grace lights up the screen with her good looks, her performance comes off as bland. There was a more palpable sense of jeopardy when she played the abducted daughter in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taken-Single-Disc-Extended-Edition/dp/B001TODCII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taken (Single-Disc Extended Edition)</a>. I was distracted by the forced banter between her and Snow. I thought the heavies were creepy, both the sensible but subtly disconcerting Vincent Regan and the filmy-eyed, indecipherable nuttter Joseph Gilgun. Peter Stormare as the bullying Secret Service agent, Langral, could also be viewed as a major antagonist.

Apropos of whatever, I don't think that lighter was showcased nearly enough. Hey, maybe it's significant!

Possibly the thing that annnoys me most is the trap that was staged to catch the culprit of Snow's frame job. I strongly feel that no self-respecting villain of average smarts would get tricked silly like that.

Still, I'm not not recommending LOCKOUT. It's good for a rental or, better yet, good for when it's available on cable. Guy Pearce's Snow does get his opportunities to demonstrate his action hero creds. Pearce imbues his character with personable grittiness and pragmatism. It's too bad the plot doesn't support him, that the special effects tend to be mediocre, that the narrative starts out promisingly but then descends into something generic and uninvolving.

4747088,2,B005LAIHBS,"Prison films have been a staple of the film industry from the earliest days. They have garnered Oscars (""The Big House"") and BAFTAs (""Birdman of Alcatraz""), generated block buster hits (""The Great Escape"", Papillon""), and helped change public policy (""I was a Fugitive from a Chain Gang""). Almost every major male actor has been in prison at least once (Wallace Beery, Chester Morris, Robert Montgomery, John Garfield, Warner Baxter, Boris Karloff, Spencer Tracy, Burt Lancaster, Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Tom Hanks, Gene Wilder, Richard Pryor, Malcolm McDowell, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwartznegger, Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Jon Voigt, Wesley Snipes, Ving Rhames, Denzel Washington, Kurt Russell, Jason Statham, Edward Norton, Nicholas Cage) and some two of more times (Cagney, Bogart, Raft, Connery, McQueen).

Prison films are so numerous that they have sub genres - women in prison (""Chained Heat""), prisoner of war (""The Great Escape""), chain gang films (""Cool Hand Luke""), foreign prison films (""Midnight Express""), prison comedies (""The Longest Yard"", ""Stir Crazy""), biographies (""The Prisoner of Shark Island""), and prison in space films. In this last category some recent examples include - Outland (1981), Critters (1986), Fortress (1993), No Escape (1994), Judge Dredd (1995), Pitch Black (2000), The Chronicles of Riddick (2004), and Alien Uprising (2009).

The latest addition to the ""prison in space"" genre is ""Lockout"", a 2012 film from Luc Besson starring Guy Pearce as an ex CIA agent sent into a maximum security space prison to rescue the daughter of the President (Maggie Grace) who is being held hostage by prisoners led by crazed (Joseph Gilgun) and nasty (Vincent Regan) brothers.

Any film from Luc Besson (1959) is worth viewing. Since 1981 Besson has been writing, directing, and/or producing films like ""Le Femme Nikita"" (1990), ""The Fifth Element"" (1997), ""The Transporter"" (2002), ""Taken"" (2008), ""District 13"" (2009) and my very favorite Besson film, ""Leon - The Professional"" (1994). He's won a BAFTA (""Nil By Mouth""), a Cesar (""The Fifth Element""), and a Wrangler (""The 3 Burials of Melquiades Estrada"") and earned more than 40 nominations in film festivals.

Australia born Guy Pearce (1967) is a great actor who has given memorable performances in films like ""LA Confidential"" (1997), ""Memento"" (2001), ""The Proposition"" (2005), ""The Hurt Locker"" (2008), and ""The King's Speech"" (2010), and he won an Emmy for his role in the TV mini series ""Mildred Pierce"" (2011). Pearce has pumped himself up physically for this role, and also seemingly spent time watching Bruce Willis films in order to get the requisite ""cynical but sarcastic"" persona down right. He does OK, although we've seen it one too many times to be intrigued.

Beautiful Maggie Grace (1983) plays the damsel in distress. She's best known for her role as Shannon in the TV series ""Lost"" (2004-10), and if this film is any gauge, that's how she will be known.

The only real treat, from an acting perspective, is Lennie James (1965) who is best known for his role on the TV series ""Jericho"" (2006-8) as the government agent with ambiguous ties to the resistance.

The film has many problems. The villain is not really so scary that we are worried about the fate of our hero and his damsel, nor is there really anything so sinister in the ""behind the scenes"" machinations of the government despite a small sub plot that fails to ignite. Nor are there any special special effects (e.g., they use guns), and the camerawork is all too ordinary. Roger Ebert gave it 2  stars; the NY Times called it ""as dopey an entertainment as imaginable""

Apparently Besson forgot the formula that made so many of his films among the very best of their genre -

- A hero should be tough, but also vulnerable - think Jean Reno from ""The Professional"" or Anne Parillaud from ""La Femme Nikita""

- The hero should be helped by a flawed sidekick - think Danny Aiello from ""The Professional"" or Tcheky Karyo from ""La Femme Nikita"" or Chris Tucker from ""The Fifth Element.""

- The ""damsel in distress"" should be attractive but vulnerable - think Natalie Portman from ""The Professional"" or Milo Jovovich from ""The Fifth Element"".

- The villain should be really scary but also capable for being a clever adversary - think Gary Oldman from ""The Professional"" and also from ""The Fifth Element"", or Jean Reno from ""La Femme Nikita""

Lockout earned $6.2 million in its opening weekend which is respectable, earning a rank of about 100 out of 2100 openings.
