The color and the photography is absolutely beautiful, and each scene was designed to allow a clear and original view of the signs.  Tears, smiles, laughters, this movie will bring you on an emotional journey, and you will never think of ""Mary had a little lamb"" the same way ever again.",1410825600,,379,4.984126984126984
