2813482,5,B000P6R6XS,"The biggest compliment I can give Mr. Lopez is that we enjoy this one hour special virtually every time we have a guest over for watching FTP's, errrrr DVD's!  Anyone who wants an honest look at George's childhood and adult experiences will definitely find this a riot.  He talks about all the crazy and ironic stuff from a typical and traditional Mexican American family!  There are some big differences in the way different cultures think . . . and George is great at nailing the visual images in this regard!  Absolutely no fluff . . . and never a dull moment!!  One bit of caution: A person may be offended if they happen to disagree that George W. and Arnold are the largest of Putos!",1192147200,6,689,4.48
2813483,5,B000P6R6XS,"George is always good. I watched this and then watched Gabriel Inglesias""Hot and Fluffy"". It made me laugh even harder when I watched it the second time.
Funny Stuff!",1190505600,,166,4.758620689655173
2813484,5,B000P6R6XS,I loved this Dvd it was funny from beginning to end!! I would recommend it to all who love a good laugh!!,1188172800,,105,3.8181818181818183
2813485,5,B000P6R6XS,"America's Mexican is simply the best performance George Lopez has had. To have an HBO special is big and only talented and funny performers like Mr. Lopez deserve to be there. I recommend this DVD to everyone, you won't be dissapointed.",1186099200,3,236,4.780487804878049
2813486,5,B000P6R6XS,As a Mexican American myself I thought this was some of his BEST work. His views from politics (FTP) to family life had us all cracking up from the beginning. If you like his TV show you'll love this from the moment it starts until the end. Even the deleted scenes were good. LMAO,1185321600,2,280,4.203703703703703
2813487,5,B000P6R6XS,"This is his best one yet! It is not for the younger ones to watch, though any adult that knows a true Mexican family will laugh to the point of tears! Highly recommended for those not easily offended.",1184716800,8,200,4.2894736842105265
2813488,5,B000P6R6XS,"In this Funny ""because it's true"" style Comedy, the laughter starts as soon as the show begins! George does not hold back on this one, with his comedic take on the Latino and White Culture ways of doing things.  His hillariouse political non sense views on Pres. Bush, ""FTP"" and Gov. Arnold Schwartzanager, are a MUST SEE!

Top it all off with those Certain family memembers we all know we have, from the worn out Aunt who's still wearing them disco thongs, to Grandma's Dimensia!  All in all if you're looking for a good laugh, George Lopez's America's Mexican is Gauranteed to Deliver!!!",1181779200,16,589,4.699029126213592
2813489,5,B000P6R6XS,"This is terrific! I am a big fan of George Lopez, have attended his comedy shows and own several DVD's. However, this is the best. He talks about everything from politics, to religion to family and beyond. He talks about being true to who you are and not giving in to the pressures of society. Great show!!!",1181174400,5,307,4.4035087719298245

2813560,1,B000P6R6XS,"My wife and I are (O.K., were) George Lopez fans, but we were sorely disappointed in this presentation. He started off basically soiling himself with excitement that Sotomayor had been appointed to the Supreme Court. Just because she's Hispanic, not because it was a well-advised decision (because it certainly wasn't).  He then launched into a racist pro-Latino, anti-white dialogue for several minutes, at which point my wife said, ""Is this going to get any better?"" and I replied, ""I sure hope so.""

Alas, improvement was not in the cards. With gratuitous use of obscenities, Mr. Lopez proceeded through several minutes of simulated masturbation and simulated farting before presenting his ""views"" on feminine hygiene products. Then, predictably, came the Bush bashing. We exercised the ""off"" switch.

Life is too short to listen to a profane political ignoramus trying to advance his views, even if he had chosen the correct forum -- which he clearly hadn't.",1309132800,,962,5.233766233766234
2813561,5,B000P6R6XS,"I know not everyone likes George Lopez, but he has a great ability for taking everyday events and make them funny.  We should all be able to laugh at our differences.",1276041600,,166,4.354838709677419
2813562,1,B000P6R6XS,"First off I'm Hispanic and I loved ""Why you Crying"", even my mom who speaks little english found it funny. Secondly I find good raunchy comedy hilarious, but in this installment of his stand up gig he fails. There is a sense of bigotry in this one, I don't know what he's trying to prove here. He glorifies stereotypes that Hispanics activists denounce. Yes it's stand up comedy and he can say what he wants, but if you want to hear something like a Mexican will wipe his butt with the hamburger and serve it to you because you're white, then you might like it. Unfortunately I'm the small percentage of Hispanics who really want equality. I'm a realistic Hispanic",1258761600,9,664,4.541666666666667
2813563,5,B000P6R6XS,You really can't say anything else.  He's a true talent.  His observational humor and pokes at his family and upbringing are hilarious.  I just watched his new HBO special and it's just as good.  I also noticed that the same guy directed both shows and he's got a website w/ some clips marty [...]. check it out.  anyhow if you have seen either one you should def check out the other,1251676800,,383,4.338028169014085
2813574,1,B000P6R6XS,"It is unfortunate that Lopez finds it necessary to use raunch to try to make people laugh.  Imitating men and women masturbating might create nervous, embarressed ""laughter"" in an audience, but watching in my own home, it was just disgusting.  Is this is the best a Mexican-American (as he continued to remind us over and over) can do?  How did we ever laugh before it became fashionable to use raunch and four-letter words?  That took skill, something most of the comedians today, especially Lopez, do not have.  Comparing his parents with ""today's"" parents could have been funnier had the sound system been up to par.  As it came over the HBO TV special, one had to strain many times to hear what he was saying.  And how sad to portray Mexican mothers as not being able to use sentences without four-letter words. You make Mexicans sound like they have no ""class"" whatsoever, while continuing to repeat how ""proud"" Mexicans are.  I wonder how much pride you really instilled with your ranting in any dignified Mexican who isn't a thief or sexually obsessed (with his/herself). I had been looking forward to this show, and I was totally disappointed and disgusted.",1249776000,3,1165,4.819095477386934
2813575,5,B000P6R6XS,"No this is NOT the George from the sitcom. You'd think people would know what to expect from this guy in his stand up acts anyway. Bottom line, this is hilariously FUNNY. George is one of the best and hopefully his next live HBO show (which I'll be seeing in person) will be as great as everything else he does.",1248134400,,311,4.2
2813576,5,B000P6R6XS,I rented this DVD and I found that after I returned it I could not stop thinking about the well done and hilarious skits Lopez did. I bought this DVD so I could watch it over and over because that is how extremely entertaining Lopez is in this comedy special. I have a great time every time I watch this DVD and I would recommend anyone above 18 to buy this DVD.,1241740800,,362,4.041666666666667
2813577,3,B000P6R6XS,"My husband and I love his last stand up but this one wasn't very funny, it was just crude.",1217721600,2,90,3.789473684210526
2813578,5,B000P6R6XS,"It's George Lopez, it's funny, if you like George, you will like this DVD. He touches on a lot of honest issues and tells it how it is. If you find this DVD offensive, it has done it's job :) Highly recommend, 100x better than the TV show, stand up in it's RAW, uncut, glorious form. If you want something rated PG, stand up is not for you!",1212019200,2,340,4.014705882352941
2813579,3,B000P6R6XS,"Like Carlos Mencia, Mr. Lopez mines ethnic stereotypes not just of Mexicans (Mariachi music, illegal immigration, drinking, crime) but also of mostly-hypothetical WASPs (BlackBerries, Bluetooths, feng shui, Starbucks).  There's plenty of jokes about how Mexicans do all the dirty work Americans supposedly won't do (""Do you know who's rebuilding New Orleans?  FEMA - Find Every Mexican Available"").

But Mr. Lopez actually shows pretty good range -- it's not just jokes based on ethnic stereotypes, but also matters as diverse as hirsute grooming, family problems and growing up poor.  He's actually funniest when he talks about the differences between his childhood and children growing up today:  ""Do you know what our `Lunchables' was?  Two weenies on a fork, over a stove!""  Overall, he has a few laugh out loud moments and is worth the time to watch, if not to purchase.",1204848000,2,875,5.207142857142857
2813580,4,B000P6R6XS,"There is A LOT of profanity in this DVD.  If any of you are buying this based on loving the TV series, you just need to be aware that it is not as family friendly as some of George's other material and certainly not as appropriate for younger ears as the TV show.  However, as always, George is hilarious and if you are a fan, you will love this too!",1200096000,4,350,3.9857142857142858
2813581,1,B000P6R6XS,"I wonder why this is not rated when it should be rated R.  He hardly says one sentence without a four letter word.  Why comedians think that makes their material funny is beyond me.  I never would have bought it had I known the language he would use all the way through. If I wanted to hear language like that I would go to the ghetto or a bar.
I wasted my money as I cannot even share it with my family.",1196553600,17,404,3.902439024390244
2813582,5,B000P6R6XS,"George Lopez hits the stage live in this magnificent HBO concert. Not many comedians have the guts to attempt a live comedy concert but Lopez shows he has the chops!
This is definately not the TV George Lopez. He delivers a concert filled with irreverent brillant material. Lopez struts the stage with a well honed comedy bravado. This man who made television history doesn't play it safe but goes out on a limb to do 75 minutes of hilarious, edgy stand-up. Lopez has all his signature family dysfunction interlaced with political satire to make one funny show. Many comedians try to imitate George Lopez but here he shows why he is an original.",1192233600,6,645,4.716814159292035
2813583,3,B000P6R6XS,"I love George Lopez and every stand up comedy he has ever done up to this one. I have to admit, I was a little offended. He really talked down on white people. I am white and am not prejudice whatsoever, but I really didn't care for this comedy this time. Other than the racist comments, it was awesome.",1192147200,8,303,4.1525423728813555

He has a way of making everyday life hilarious and making us look at it in ways we wouldn't have otherwise done. This is not appropriate for children or teenagers and they should be aaway before putting this one on to play. He does use a whole lot of inappropriate language that should not be heard by little ones and also speaks of issues that are not children appropriate.

George is hilarious in this film and will have you laughing hysterically.",1461369600,,537,4.36
