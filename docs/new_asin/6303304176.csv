I know somewhere this film is on vhs at my parents house, and I am thrilled(though appalled at the price) to see it on dvd.  I had to write this review after seeing what the parents were writing about this.  I remember this movie having a fantastic story and seeming very real as a child, but never remember is shocking me in any way, and my parents restricted me from watching even movies rated PG-13.  Children under the age of 5 would have problems understanding the plot of this movie, so I would not suggest it for anyone under this age.  This cartoon contains nothing more offensive than the cartoon of the hobbit or films such as labrynth or the dark crystal.  yuppies that are now parents will want to keep their kids away because they are offended by anything that makes their children think, but for the rest, as someone who watched this as at a young age, i hold only fond memories of this film.",1154995200,7,1023,4.473118279569892
625187,1,6303304176,"I couldn't believe the content of this movie! How it ever got a G rating I'll never know! My 3 year old bowed out of watching after about 5 minutes because it was ""too scary"". I went back and forth from playing with my 3 yr. old and watching the movie with my (almost) 5 yr. old. At one point I came in to see the father smack the ""brave frog"" across the face only to send him flying to the ground, listening to a lecture about respect! I was stunned and continued to watch thoroughly expecting it to redeem itself with a lesson or something, but the next major event (not 5 min. later) was the discovery of the ""brave frog's"" murdered friend(yes, the word murdered was used). By this point my 5 yr. old no longer wanted to watch and I agreed wholeheartedly saying that I dind't think it was a good movie for anyone to watch. No one wanted to discuss it further and I can't say that I blame them for not wanting to think about it. At least when Disney shows murdere and criminal behavior it's masked in such a way that the little ones really don't know what's going on. The Brave Frog make a point to see that the kids know exactly what's happening!",1112400000,5,1149,4.203619909502263
625188,3,6303304176,"THE BRAVE FROG is a movie made in the US by compiling images taken from the Japanese TV-series ""Kerokko Demetan"", produced in 1973. It's a pity that there are no references to the original production within the ""technical information""...",1082160000,5,237,5.102564102564102
625189,2,6303304176,"I think the original movie was produced for TV. Thence, the video and audio quality can be comparable to VHS. Except for those who love old  animation movies, I suspect that anyone will acclaim this title as a good  DVD collection. However, the story can be enjoyable. I love the old theme  music.",941500800,,297,4.566037735849057
7843563,5,6303304176,"This was a childhood favorite of mine. Yes it's heavy for a kid's movie, but that stuff went over my head as a kid. Truth be told, I find it more disturbing as an adult, but for nostalgia's sake, I'd definitely buy this if it wasn't so expensive. You really have to have grown up with this to appreciate it.",1524960000,,307,4.133333333333334
7843564,4,6303304176,"I grew up with this movie when I was a child but the video was misplaced. Until I bought this from Amazon.com, I had trouble finding that movie at every movie store that I came across.",1434672000,,184,4.138888888888889
7843565,5,6303304176,Love this movie.  Had it on vhs as a kid.  The musi is so melancholic.,1420156800,,70,3.6
7843566,5,6303304176,"Yes it was sad and showed violence. BUT guess what ""parents"" kids see this on TV and in school all day everyday. The INTERNET reveals a lot more than you think. So if you want to shield your kids than do so from everything else in the world. I like the fact that it teaches that live is full of bad events and that we have to be courageous and keep fighting. This taught that, even if everything thinks its a bad anime. It was one of my favorite movies to watch as a kid. Our mother couldn't afford to get us movies at the blockbuster or buy any so she would take us to the library and this happened to be one of those movies. Myself my eldest sis and my three brothers still bring up this movie. I recommend it to everyone. I can honestly say that all these bad reviews are ridiculous and with no reason. Please people welcome to the real world of bullying and real life!",1395100800,,872,4.105263157894737
7843567,5,6303304176,"This movie is wonderful but not for the faint of heart. It has very deep and controversial topics such as: death, bulling, racism, family trust and complex emotions. if you have a mature 10 year old i say watch it. I watched it when I was ten I did cry because of issues that I could relate to. the music is beautiful and is a very touching story similar to a one sided  romeo and Juliet except it between a ruling family and a poor family. This movie will make you think if you let it. But again viewer discretion is strongly advised. I watched the movie many times as a child teen and adult today on VHS, its great.",1341273600,,617,4.141666666666667
7843568,1,6303304176,Growing up this was my favorite movie.  Now that I'm older I re-watch and am completly taken aback.  I made some of my college friends watch it with me and they agreed that it is a terrible movie (one of them even said that it made them want to kill themselves).  It's a great movie to include in a bad movie marathon.  I enjoy making people watch it just because I love having bad movie marathons.  I still cannot believe that it was me and my sister's favorite movie growing up...our poor mom had to watch it over and over again. :D,1327968000,2,534,4.196078431372549
7843569,1,6303304176,"At the surface, THE BRAVE FROG may seem like an innocuous animated time-waster for kids. It aspires to be a coming-of-age story of two tadpoles who struggle to maintain a friendship against the wishes of their stubborn parents. The cuddly appearance of the lead characters and the watercolor-style animation also provides promise. Unfortunately all of my hopes were completely dashed by the time I finished sitting through it. This is one of the most mean-spirited, badly written, poorly dubbed, and depressing films I have ever seen. The leads spend most of the 91 minutes crying and crying and crying, which gets old REALLY fast. It does not help that both are trapped in a story that wavers between frightening and weepy. The only joyful moment in the movie is a dance scene between the leads, but even then this scene is too short and does nothing to offset the confused nature of the plot. It bounces around from one scene to the next, with no coherent thread to accommodate it. The film is basically an edited compilation of a 39-episode series, which probably explains the constantly ""hopping"" (no pun intended) plot and the even worse ending, which is both disappointingly abrupt and out-of-left field (an evil character suddenly decides to reform with absolutely NO reason to do so?). The voice acting is both grating and painfully shrill--the only time I ever laughed at all was a scene where a bully sings a mocking song to the tune of ""Countdown Races"" in a deadpan, unenthusiastic tone... but that was only funny for the wrong reasons. A better title for this movie should have been THE STUPID FROG, because that is exactly what it comes across as. There are far better choices for family viewing than this obnoxious, dreary, unengaging fiasco.",1297555200,,1757,4.879598662207358
7843570,1,6303304176,About the only thing I remember about this movie is that when we rented it my brother (5) and I (8) both disliked it. My parents agreed that it was awful so we rented something else. Don't recommend it especially for $50! But if you were going to buy the VHS I suggest watching it on Youtube first.,1214524800,2,298,4.155172413793103
7843571,1,6303304176,"Okay, where to begin! The memories I cherish of this insult to cinema (not to mention Japanese Anime) are vague impressions of horror and disgust. I was not very frightened by the parts that were supposed to be dramatic, even though these should not be viewed by young children, but by the overall mental deadness and bleakness of the film. You go away feeling that the world is a cold and evil place, and I all but shivered in my bed afterwards.  After 90 minuites of violence and death in a bleak, cold amphibian world, I took one look at the repulsive cover and realised that it was created as a warning by some well intentioned graphic designer who wished to warn people away from this movie. do not waste your money! Warn the rest away before it is too late!",1174694400,4,763,4.411347517730497
