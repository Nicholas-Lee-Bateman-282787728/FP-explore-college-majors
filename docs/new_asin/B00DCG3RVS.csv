8591758,3,B00DCG3RVS,"A so so story, The only thing about it I liked was actor David Hedison and the sub story about his love for a south Korean girl, which was a big no no during that time, mixed marriage not being widely accepted.
He did a good job for his character, and was a dream to look at.",1523664000,,275,3.8421052631578947
8591759,3,B00DCG3RVS,"It's an Okay early movie starring David Hedison as college educated Marine. Main part of the story centers on a bunch of Marines on leave in Japan fooling around, drinking, carousing, womanizing, and just as the crap is about to hit the fan all leave gets cancelled and they get called back to the front line. Fairly entertaining. David Hedison fans will probably like this movie. One of his earlier works before starring  as Captain Lee Crane on Irwin Allen's Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea with Richard Basehart from 1964-1968.",1413072000,,530,4.760869565217392
8591760,1,B00DCG3RVS,"This is such a SAD DVD !!! This movie was shot in Cinemascope 235.1 aspect ratio. 20th Fox was the inventor of this beautiful widescreen process. THIS DVD IS HORRRIBLE PAN & SCAN,like a VHS from times gone by. I thought that 20th Century Fox DVD-R's would follow the super quailty of Warner Archive's DVD-R's which are always in the proper aspect ratio. Like another reviewer, I saw this when I was a kid and wanted to relive the movie as an adult. So sad, NOW I CAN'T TRUST 20th Century Cinema Archives to give me the WHOLE movie. I hope they don't crop ALL of their Cinema Archives. If I ever order again,I'll make sure I know if it's PAN & SCAN. Poor 20th Century: STILL doesn't
know what film collectors want to buy. If you are looking for RARE old movies,go to WARNER ARCHIVES,they get it. Otherwise ,movie was ok,wish I could have seen it as intended when 20th Fox released it in the theaters. Have fun,movie buffs!",1406937600,4,921,4.423529411764706
8591761,4,B00DCG3RVS,Story line was Ok.  Seemed to jump from one scene to another with a blank in the middle.  lNeeded more explaination in relationships..,1382227200,,134,4.782608695652174
8591762,3,B00DCG3RVS,"I saw this movie when it first came out as a teenager.  Humorous account of Marines and their antics on liberty.  Un-fortunately Marines in Okinawa and their acts have since placed a stigma on the Corps and US Military in general in recent years, these acts have not been humorous.",1377302400,,281,4.6
