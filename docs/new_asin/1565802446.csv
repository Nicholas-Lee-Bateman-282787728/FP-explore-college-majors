7796484,5,1565802446,"Critic/theorist Nol Burch has created a stunning set of documentary films that look at the rise of film-making and how it both influenced and was influenced by various Western societies (Britain, the U.S., France, etc.). A must-view for anyone interested in history, culture, films, etc. And I'll second Pietro Shakarian's review of 08/24/12...this absolutely needs to be available on DVD. It's simply too important not to be.",1374019200,,426,5.373134328358209
7796485,5,1565802446,"""What Do These Old Films Mean?"" is a terrific series of documentaries discussing world cinema in the silent era.  What I especially enjoy about these films is their focus on the less widely-known aspects of the great film-producing industries of the time.  For instance, the episodes on France, Weimar Germany, and the Soviet Union cover films about class divisions and everyday life as opposed to the usual fare that one might expect to find in an introductory film course (French Impressionism, German Expressionism, Soviet Constructivism, etc.).  Highly recommended.  Should be on DVD.",1345766400,2,588,5.358695652173913
