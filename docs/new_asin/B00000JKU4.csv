1233826,5,B00000JKU4,"I was in 5th grade when this show premiered on ABC on Wednesday nights in the fall of 1975. I remember it so vividly. It was a hilarious show that was way ahead of its time. The show featured Dick Van Patten (as Friar Tuck) and Bernie Kopell (as Alan A Dale) before each would find greater success in the other hits ""Eight is Enough"" and ""The Love Boat"". The  antics of Robin Hood (played by Dick Gautier), and his merry men were very short lived-the show was cancelled several weeks into its run and ended after only 13 episodes. If I remember correctly the very last showing was on a Saturday night (Christmas eve) and it was a repeat of the bell episode. With guest stars such as Sid Caesar and Dudley Moore, it's a mystery as to why this hilarious show did not last longer. Mel Brooks was and is a legend and this series is one of the most long awaited titles I have been waiting for to add to my collection.",1370995200,16,912,4.211428571428572
1233827,4,B00000JKU4,"This is one of the few GOOD canceled TV shows of only Half a season. I don;t want to  review the DVD-it isn't relwased yet. But i am wondering if someone sought out this rare series to release to DVD...can other rare one season or less series be coming to DVD? I hope so---let's go--release DELTA HOUSE, CAPTAIN NICE, MR TERRIFIC (they had to ban that show from American Syndication-the main character gained stregth by swallowing a large  white Pill). TV censors used to ban and edit episodes of any show in which a character would swallow pills. They used to edit pills out of the ABC BATMAN  series in syndication (BATMAN used to take BAT PILLS) and UNDERDOG..they used to edit out all the pill swallowing scenes lol). Anyway--so glad this rare show is coming to DVD. What's next--ON THE ROCKS_(1974-1976)-that was a COMEDY series of assorted ethnic characters locked up in a prison.",1367971200,7,886,4.703225806451613

1233830,5,B00000JKU4,"I watched this series on TV back in the 70's.  I loved it.  It was funny without the trash that modern untalented producers think they have to add on TV these days to be ""cool"".",1248393600,3,177,4.0285714285714285
1233831,5,B00000JKU4,"Like Normal Lear's Hot-l Baltimore and All in the Family, Mel Brooks was before his time with this send-up of Robin Hood.  When it was released, no one got it.  The humor was above the average TV viewer; similar to Dennis Miller today.

In 1975, no one cared about political correctness: funny was funny.  This series was funny, period.  The sight gags and contemporary references came fast and furious.  When Robin Hood: Men in Tights came out, I was disappointed that more of the WTWR cast didn't make cameo appearances.  The only one was Dick Van Patten (the original Friar Tuck) in the part of the Abbott.

For the fan of Mel Brooks, politically incorrect humor, or if you're just someone who likes to laugh at the absurdity of life, this series is for you.",1214438400,13,761,4.5851851851851855
1233832,4,B00000JKU4,"These episodes from Mel Brooks' short-lived 1975 television series are good, wacky fun. Brooks and his team present a gag-filled, often hilarious send-up of the Robin Hood legend, some two decades before the feature film, ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" (which suffers by comparison with this series). Talented Dick Gautier is well cast as the dashing hero, while Dick Van Patten displays admirable comedic skills as the portly and always hungry Friar Tuck. Among the cast (many of whom will be recognizable to fans of 1970's television) are Sid Caesar as a French nobleman and Misty Rowe as a ditzy, sexy, and scheming Maid Marian. Watch for Dudley Moore's guest role, which includes a turn at the piano, as a visiting sheik who plans to wed Marian!
Overall, this is fun television -- complete with sight gags, nutty dialogue, over-the-top anachronisms, a silly theme song, and skillful comedic acting. For fans of Brooks, historical parody, and 1970's television, this is highly recommended.",984614400,61,989,5.111111111111111

1233845,3,B00000JKU4,"It's easy to see why ABC yanked this after only 13 weeks. I'm surprised they let it last that long.  Mel Brooks' hilarious sight gags just don't work in a 30 minute TV show. There just isn't enough time to develop and play them out. Also a television budget just won't allow for elaborate film gags. They come across as rather slap-dash here. The choice of actors is a little weird, too. 'Friar Tuck' isn't first thing that comes to mind when conversations turn to Dick Van Patton. The choice of Bernie Kopell as Alan-A-Dale was just plain stupid. I half-expected to see his doctor's bag any minute or him morphing into Zigfried and opening 'KAOS Sherwood Forest' branch.",1467504000,,671,4.638655462184874

1233852,4,B00000JKU4,"A good program, spoofing the Robin Hood story. A lot of great talent in this show, even when you had to groan at how bad some of the jokes are. It's worth it just to listen to the theme song!",1454630400,,191,3.8

1233904,5,B00000JKU4,"I remember when this series came out, I don't recall there being much promotion because of Mel Brooks' involvement or much promotion period so I was very surprised that it was cancelled after less than half a season, for the time.  I doubt most were even aware that Mel Brooks was involved.  It was at the height of his popularity and figured they would give it at least a couple of years, it really was never given much of a chance and is still a little puzzling to me to this day why it was cancelled, When Things Were Rotten should have been a huge hit.

This was Mel Brooks' take on the Robin Hood story and so many of the jokes were a play on the time period with modern influences, typical Brooks.  I do remember thinking the title of the series was not very good, they definitely should have tried to come up with something that was representative of the Robin Hood time period, similar to what he did with his movie titles.

If you are a fan of those great Mel Brooks movies then this is also a must have.  So happy that they released this on DVD.",1429401600,,1055,4.223880597014926
1233905,4,B00000JKU4,"Forgotten Mel Brooks Show.  Not bad, if you enjoyed Mel's ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights"" you should enjoy this too.  Even has Dick Van Patten in both Show and Movie (Friar Tuck in show, the Abbott in Movie)  Unlike most ""sitcoms"" today, it doesn't have to do ""message"" shows.  I watch sitcoms to laugh and relax.....not to get preached at by people who make more in an episode than I make in a year.  This is good light, family friendly TV.",1428192000,,437,4.345679012345679

After all, age does have its privileges, and the first watching is mine!  All mine!  To place the cherry on the sundae, it's still as hilarious now as it was then, if not more so.  In this show the humor seems to improve with age, for it seems a bit funnier now than it did in 1975.  I'm glad I thought to look to see if it was available, because not to have it to view once more would be a major loss.  Great picture, great sound, great memories!  What more could you ask?",1403654400,,651,3.992248062015504

1234010,5,B00000JKU4,"Perhaps no modern critic would love it. Mel Brook's ""When Things Were Rotten""  is silly, stupid, full of sight gags, and nothing more than that.

But I found it enjoyable. This particular take-off of Robin Hood is just plain fun. Henry Polic II (who just passed away) gives a wonderful hammy, vaudeville like performance as the evil Sherriff of Nottingham and Misty Rowe is just wonderful and beautiful as Maid Marion. Dick Gautier, Bernie Kopell, and Dick Van Patten are all  great in their respective roles, and while the series was short-lived, it did have its strengths, especially for those who love their comedy broad.

Perfect for litte kids, who love cartoons (it is a cartoon), and has absolutely no questionable humor or any politically correct message. Or for that matter, any other kind.

Great present for the kid in all of us. Give it a try.

1234011,3,B00000JKU4,"When this show was on TV YEARS AGO I thought it was very funny.  It is basically an ""Airplane"" type of comedy with those type
of gags, but after watching a bit of this, I don't find it nearly as good.  It stlll has funny parts, including a BLACK KNIGHT  who was
really black, a very rare sight in Europe back then. And there are other funny spots, so I gave this three stars.  The video images are
very good quality but of course 4 x 3 format for old style TVs.  Still, I love satire on history and this show has its moments but  it
was not on the network very long.  Perhaps the title is bad, but if you like 60s and 70s comedy you may want to get this.  Not
very expensive and it is interesting with a pretty good cast.  Like all my DVDs I got it at Amazon.",1390694400,2,759,3.9084967320261437

But it had a great cast and not bad stories,  just needed to be punched up a bit in the joke dept.  Still I liked it back then and enjoyed watching it again now.  If you are a fan of Mel Brooks then buy it,  if you are not a big fan of Mel and have to ask who Dick Gautier is  then maybe stick to Men In TIghts.",1388448000,,409,3.539325842696629

Lovable veteran character actors enjoy a delightful, fanciful romp through Nottingham and Sherwood Forest, where the good guys always win, the bad guys are hopelessly inept, all problems miraculously resolve by the end of each episode, and no one ever, ever gets killed.

Let's see what was going on in 1975.  I was 10.  I was watching Saturday Night Live's first season, I had gotten into Monty Python when the local PBS station started showing Flying Circus around that time, I don't think I had seen Blazing Saddles or Young Frankenstein yet so I wouldn't have known who Mel Brooks was.  I guess I knew the Robin Hood legend so I could see the potential for parody.  So after viewing a few of these episodes again, I can say that this purchase is well worth it.  The gags are low-brow but still funny.  Comedy veterans Dick Gautier, Dick Van Patten, and Bernie Kopell are great.  I had forgotten how cute and funny Misty Rowe is.  And so far, there have been some great guest stars - Sid Caesar, Dudley Moore (I also had forgotten how much I liked him), and Steve Landesberg (pre-Barney Miller but thanks to the Blazing Saddles DVD I know he had been in the pilot for the Blazing Saddles TV show [as the Gene Wilder character]).

1234129,5,B00000JKU4,"I remember watching this show when I was a kid and wondering where it went so quickly. After years of seeing the fuzzy cut up bootleg versions this is a welcome DVD set. The episodes look great! Yea, it's stupid but it's good! It's Mel Brooks! Look closely for him in one episode. And I'll watch anything with Misty Rowe in it. Great stuff that was cancelled too soon.",1373328000,3,368,4.3478260869565215

writing this  review Offline !

first  of all,I had this  on vhs,was  very excited at the prospect to get it on dvd!
Plus  extra  episodes not available  on the vhs  release.

This  production  not  expected to dissapoint,as I watch  now !
The quality of  transfer is  good if not excellent--no,I will  say excellent!!!

sometimes  you read in reviews of dvd  products  that have been released for first time on dvd,
complaints like ""  it  seemed to be transferred from the videotape""
Not so here !!!
good  resolution,good color !!

such  guests as Cid Caesar,Dudley Moore,Paul  Williams ,more

as to dvd playability,you usually  read that  when it is dvd on demand,that it may not play  on
dvd  recorders,but I  have a LG  Brand dvd tuner/player/recorder,it plays  fine on mine,of course
your results may  vary !!!",1372118400,5,881,4.651006711409396
1234131,4,B00000JKU4,"I just got this and watched the first episode. The audio seems too skip when there's a break where a commercial would have been. Has anyone else noticed this? ****(UPDATE) I originally played this in my Blu-Ray Disc player, I have since played it in my regular DVD player and the audio was fine. This must be an issue due to the ""On Demand"" nature of the disc.",1372118400,,360,4.3088235294117645
1234132,5,B00000JKU4,"This was one of my favorite shows when I saw it as a kid. Some of the episodes are just OK, but a few are actually very well-written and funny.

(stuff wondering about the picture quality snipped out)

ETA: My sister bought a copy of this DVD and the picture is fine - looks like broadcast quality, not a fourth-generation VHS transfer which was my worry.

Interestingly, though, I did find at least one edit - in the episode ""Birthday Blues"", a character sings a bit from ""Do You Know the Way to San Jos?"" that was cut out, presumably because of copyright. It didn't affect the overall quality of the episode, though. Awesome DVD!",1371513600,,631,4.469565217391304

7912437,5,B00000JKU4,"Truly very stupid, I love it. I was an 11 year old kid when this show was on T.V. It's not as good as police squad but still good dumb humor. If you aren't a child of the 70's this probably won't appeal to you. Dick Van Patten does a great angry Friar Tuck. If you're looking for high brow humor this won't be for you. It might just be nostalgia, but I'm glad I stumbled across it. Amazon always seems to have the off the wall stuff like this. I couldn't be more satisfied.",1511481600,,473,3.9894736842105263
