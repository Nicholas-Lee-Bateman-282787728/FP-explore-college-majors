795383,3,6304155697,"The bad: the video transfer looks like it was taken from a very old VHS copy; the playback was extremely choppy (even with 30 Mbps downloads--I stopped the film to see if it was at my end); and the original film would have seriously benefited from editing on the order of 15-20 minutes throughout the film, as various scenes dragged on painfully.

The good: it's a fairly light romp, with decent acting and an interesting storyline. It's not deep or philosophical, but it was enjoyable overall.",1406851200,2,494,4.744186046511628
795384,1,6304155697,Really sappy chick-flick - couldn't watch the whole thing had to turn it off. If a man kept hitting women - no one would think it was funny - but it's OK for this dysfunctional woman to go around hitting men???,1405641600,,210,4.146341463414634
795385,4,6304155697,"This was a light, entertaining and delightful romantic comedy.  It was somewhat predictable but I still enjoyed it-especially looking at Mark Frankel.  If you're in the mood for a sweet story, watch this one.",1404691200,,208,5.088235294117647
795386,5,6304155697,"The seller was prompt in email reply.
Movie arrived quickly and in good packaging; therefore, good shape.
Enjoyed the movie.
Appreciated seller's efficiency.",1268006400,,157,5.869565217391305
795387,3,6304155697,"This movie is a romantic comedy, and also resembles a sci-fi story. Specifically, one of the main characters is telepathic. The movie is mostly clever and interesting, but is also occasionally a bit silly and predictable. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it. Though the movie is only available on VHS tape (as of 1/09) it is certainly better than a lot of other movies that are available on DVD.",1232323200,6,385,4.7611940298507465
795388,5,6304155697,"Mark Frankel does a superb turn as the charming Daniel Becker, a body language expert who is finds himself at a loss when Katie Burrill (Amanda Pays) knows his every thought (literally).  Katie is tired of men and their thoughts - ""Men's minds are sewers!"" she says, but a persistant Daniel doesn't let up and insists they can work things out.
It hard to believe Mark is gone, but thank goodness his memory lives on in his films and television work.
I thought Solitaire for 2 was hilarious and funny, with two wonderful actors and a fantastic story.
A romantic comedy, Solitaire for 2 is a funny, adorable film and worth a video rental!  END",899251200,24,641,4.565217391304348

This was one of my fave movies of the 90's.  I have it on VHS (fat lot of good it does me, now) so I am very very happy that it is available for streaming with my Prime membership!  Now, if only they would get it on BluRay.",1417478400,2,399,3.9625

795527,4,6304155697,I really enjoyed this meeting.  There were so many twists in the plot but still a predictable end.  The characters each had their own depth and came together to make a light comedy and yet touching romantic movie.,1412899200,,213,4.578947368421052
795528,5,6304155697,"Really cute, like the fact that reviled her gift in childhood, and brought it forward into the life of an adult, with same result as when a child. The conclusion was well done.",1407542400,,176,4.363636363636363

Swear words, no matter how mild, are silenced and some nudity has been removed.
