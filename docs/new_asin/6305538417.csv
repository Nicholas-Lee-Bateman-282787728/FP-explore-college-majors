1045104,3,6305538417,"Ok, our hero doesn't REALLY say that line in this movie, but if you haven't figured it out already, Stuart Goetz is mostly known to millions as Charley in that legendary Brady Bunch episode where Marcia gets hit in the nose with the football (he was the dorky one with the wallpaper samples).

Anyway THAT'S where you've seen our ""star"" before... now on to the movie.

This was a big drive-in hit in the summer of 1977 and is a pretty good time capsule for that era.  Guy hopes to impress chicks with tricked-out van, gets challenged to drag-race by rival.  Lotsa partying and late-teen hijinks ensue.  Feather-light script would probably take at least 24 hours to hit the floor if it were dropped from the ceiling, but it's still a fun (albeit hokey) remnant from the ""drive-in swill"" days of the '70s.  The Rhino DVD is probably the best version (it's not heavily edited like other versions out there); the only drawbacks are it's full-frame, there are a few imperfections in the print and some of the color didn't age very well, but that doesn't really detract from overall enjoyment of the movie (if anything it enhances the ""70s feeling"").  Fans of ""Joe Bob Briggs-type"" movies will enjoy!",1176681600,,1194,4.684210526315789
1045105,1,6305538417,"Amazon pairs this movie with The Snapper, the second installment of Irish author Roddy Doyle's ""Barrytown Trilogy"". The reality is it has the same name, The Van as the third installment. I was mislead and purchased this movie. It was my own fault to trust Amazon's recommendation without double checking the director and cast members. So, I received the movie and actually watched it for 5 minutes. It was so bad, I threw the movie away without even trying to return it to Amazon.

1045106,3,6305538417,"The 70s brought us so many wonderful things...lava lamps, groovy iron on shirt decals, bell bottom jeans, feathered hair, David Cassidy, platform shoes, disco, G.I. Joe with Kung Fu Grip, Evel Knievel, Astro Pops, Macram clothing, John Travolta, Easy Bake Ovens, Donnie and Marie Osmand, and custom vans...it may seem odd now, but the subculture of custom vans was a force unto itself, so much so there were even a couple of films made to appeal to `Vanners', or, those whom custom vans were (and maybe still are) a way of life.  The two movies I'm aware of both came out around the same time, one called Supervan (1977), and this one, titled simply The Van (1976) aka Chevy Van.  There may have been others, I don't know, but this film, co-written by Robert J. Rosenthal (The Pom Pom Girls, Malibu Beach, Zapped!), was directed by Sam Grossman and stars Stuart Goetz (Record City) and Deborah White (Fast-Walking, Alligator II: The Mutation).  Also appearing is Harry Moses (Sweater Girls, The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood), Marcie Barkin (Chesty Anderson, USN, Smokey and the Good Time Outlaws), Stephen Oliver (Werewolves on Wheels, Cycle Psycho), and a younger, slightly less balding, and not as paunchy, Danny DeVito (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Car Wash, ""Taxi"").

As the movie begins we meet Bobby (Goetz), a doofy-looking cross between Danny Bonaduce and Donny Most, who played Ralph Malph on the 70s sitcom ""Happy Days"".  Bobby and his friends are graduating from high school (participating in the 8 year program I suspect, as they all appear to be in their mid 20s), and Bobby's got big, post graduate plans...he's going to take all the money he's been saving up these last few years working part time at the carwash and buy himself his very own van...but it's not just any van, no, but a deluxe palace on wheels.  It's real a sweet ride, complete with Mag wheels, diamond tuck pleather (synthetic leather) upholstery, custom paint job, racing stripes, wall to wall shag carpeting, air-conditioning, captain's chairs, cup holder, overhead lighting, a refrigerator and pop up toaster, CB radio, side bubble window, television, 8-Track tape player, quadraphonic speakers, fog lights, mirrors on the ceiling, and a waterbed in back (What?  No disco ball?)...yes sir, it's a real shaggin' wagon, and Bobby's going to put it to good use in scoring with the femininas...seriously, what woman, plied with liberal doses of weed and booze, wouldn't want to be seduced in the back of a funky van by a 98 lb, red-headed nerd with horse teeth and wearing bell bottom jeans?  Tina (White), for one, who Bobby's got a little thing for, but won't give him the time of day (uptight attitude is nothing that can't be fixed by a surgical procedure removing the three foot rod from her behind).  All sorts of hi-jinks ensue as Bobby cruises about town in his new boss wheels (including attending a `van-in', or a gathering of van aficionados), and the movie eventually leads up to a big race showdown between Bobby and the local psycho Dugan (Oliver), who drives a black monster Chevy van complete with flame motif...

This is your basic teenage sex romp comedy, set against the subculture of custom vans.  The story is pretty lame, basically involving Bobby buying a tricked out boogie van specifically to score with chicks, but ultimately learning that, while impressive, his shaggin' wagon is only a material possession, and true happiness comes from within...or something like that...the character of Bobby, who was supposed to be the hero of sorts, was actually a pretty sleazy one with a tendency for erotic fantasizing (these fantasies would have been much more erotic had Bobby not been in them) and date raping.  His modus operandi includes luring woman into his van, doping them up with weed and booze, and then trying to forcefully jump their bones.  Since he was a pretty small guy, the women were able to fend him off easy enough, but still, it was kinda creepy, and borderline criminal.  Here's another great demonstration of Bobby's fine character...one scene in a local hangout has the muscle-laden bully Dugan threatening Bobby with physical violence, and one of Bobby's friend Jack (Moses) comes to the rescue.  Bobby ends up taking off after a girl, leaving Jack behind to fend for himself against the much larger Dugan.  The next scene we see Jack with a good-sized bandage on his face, indicating Jack took a real beating.  In yet another scene we see Bobby taking revenge on some co-workers by poisoning some beers with bowel stimulating drug, to which the co-workers ingest, and subsequently spend the rest of the film chasing him around for retribution.  Danny DeVito is in the film, playing Bobby's boss at the carwash and also a bookie, featured in a subplot involving Bobby loaning his van payment money to his desperate boss to pay off some losses.  This sets up Bobby's need to race near the end, otherwise his ride would get repossessed.  All of the main female characters get nekkid in this film, although Ms. White shows the least (there's always one in the bunch).  There's plenty of driving montages, accompanied by the soft rock croonings of Sammy Johns, whose biggest hit, being ""Chevy Van"", is featured here, which was odd considering the main vehicle portrayed in the movie was a Dodge.  Since the makers of this film paid for the rights to use Mr. John's music, use it they do, over, and over, and over again...if I ever hear `Chevy Van"" or ""Early Morning Love"" again I'm likely to stick two cocktail shrimp forks in my ears in search of blissful release.  All in all the movie is a mindless, silly affair, with some crude humor, and exactly what I expected.  Is it worth seeing?  Perhaps, if you, like myself, enjoy forgettable 70s films, or have an interest in fun truckin' vanners (I got the impression Bobby was no true `vanner', but only a party vanner, one who's only predisposed in using his vehicle to score).

The picture quality on this Rhino DVD release is fairly lacking, but it's pretty much what I expected given the price.  There is noticeable grain throughout, and even a frame or two missing, and the movie is presented in fullscreen format.  The audio track is decent enough, matching the picture quality.  Surprisingly, there are a couple of extras including some bios, and a photo still gallery that doesn't appear to be screen shots, but honest to goodness production photos.  This is a two star movie, but I added an extra for the nostalgia element.

If I learned anything from this film it's that if you have a boogie van with a waterbed in back, it'd probably be wise not to engage in intimacies with Rubenesque women due to the distinct possibility of springing a leak, and the time you'll have to spend removing the moisture from the shag carpeting with a hair dryer...",1129161600,12,6843,4.8371893744644385
1045107,5,6305538417,"The Van is a classic 70's flick. No, not classic as in standing the test of time, or anything like that, but classic as in typical 70's plot, and lifestyles that the movies projects. Its basically about a guy named Bobby, who saves his money, trades in his old car for a tricked out van, loaded with what else, a waterbed, a cb radio, an 8-track player, coffee maker, toaster, a fridge, and mirrors. He is on a quest to get laid, as his friends. Sammy John's hit song Chevy Van is the soundtrack for this flick, (so appropriate) as his other song Early Morning Love is also.

It's very cheaply made, the dialogue is incredibly inane and it has no socially redeeming value.  Still, maybe it's something to do with nostalgia, but I find it enjoyable to watch and laugh at.

Well, aside from a few funny moments, the movie made me laugh by just how HORRIBLE it really was.  I let my friend borrow it.  His comment:  ""<i>Plan 9 from Outerspace</i> was a better movie than this.""  If you are not already aware, <i>Plan 9<i> has often been touted as the ""worst movie ever [said in Simpsons Comic-book Store Guy voice],"" and rightly so!  But, then you find a simple movie like this little gem, and you really have to rethink the actual level that movie awfulness can sink to.  This movie truly lowers the bar.  Unfortunately, the DVD that I bought, and paid entirely too much for, is the worst DVD ever, also.  It really looks as if someone recorded it off of USA's ""Up All Night,"" (which is what I used to watch this flick on), and transferred it onto DVD format.  The cuss words are badly edited out!  Talk about craziness!  I also remember more sexiness than it had.  Anytime there was any moment that might be remotely sexual, the movie cut to oceans and sunsets!  There were a LOT of oceans and sunsets!  In fact, about half of the movie were OCEANS and SUNSETS!
Anyway, this does not mean that I do not think you should see this movie.  I believe that everyone <i>should</i> see this movie at some point or another in one's lifetime.  Therefore, if you see a bad movie in the theatre, and you are ticked off by the amount of money you just spent on a ticket (exorbitant, I am sure), then you can watch this movie and it will make the one you were disappointed in seem like Oscar-calibre!

1045394,5,6305538417,"Simply put, The Van is probably the greatest sexploitation film ever made. This movie taught me many life lessons: like it's ok to drink while driving, women love rapist vans with shag carpeting, if a girl cries rape on your sexual advances just keep trying till she says yes, and you can cheat on a girl as long as you beat a bully in a Van race and have a large member. Yes, The Van demonstrates all these important life lessons; all while playing soft country music.

Bobby, a semi-rapist ginger kid, decides to blow his college fund on a customized van called ""The Straight Arrow"" in order to attract trashy women. Bobby is on a quest to get laid, even if it's by force, to any woman that moves. His tactic is to lure women into his van by offering them a joint. From there, his freckled grabby hands take over. After many failed attempts, Bobby decides to pursue Tina, the most stuck-up prudish girl at school. At first, she doesn't want any part of his sexual depravity but she eventually succumbs to his ginger charm.

The one conflict Bobby has to face, other than his incessant sexual cravings, is the local bully Dugan, who for some reason hates other people who drive vans. Once Bobby makes the mistake of calling Dugan a ""turd"" he is marked for death. So instead of staying as far away as possible, Bobby sleeps with Dugan's girlfriend Sally - mostly because Tina (now Bobby's girlfriend) was busy that night.

In the end, Bobby and Dugan have a van race, Bobby flips his van, Sally says Bobby has a bigger unit than Dugan, and Tina forgives Bobby for his sexual infidelities. This is a movie.

Watch this film. I've never met a single person in my life that has not liked this movie once they'd seen it. This is sexploitation at its best.  Some memorable scenes include: a ""fat girl"" popping the shag waterbed in Bobby's van, Bobby and friends drinking a jug of wine while driving along a mountain road, Bobby's numerous rape attempts, Dugan saying ""nobody calls Dugan a Turd!"", The elusive van subculture on the beach, and any scene with Bill Adler or Danny Devito.

1045395,4,6305538417,"There are so many poor behavioral nuances in this film that you'd never be able to get away with them today when practicing social interactions at picking up girls.  This film give you the impression that if you grab at a girls tits enough, or if you try to kiss her whether she wants it or not, eventually she should give in or she's just not normal.  But, that was the seventies.  I remember seeing this film at the theatre when it came out, and I was feeling like this film was showing me how I could get a girl if I was less shy and a little more aggressive.  This film showed such lewd behavior as any guy should be able to pick up a girl and expect her to put out just because he's a guy and she's a girl.  The main guy of this film was actually attempting mild, but unsuccessful, rape intentions.

Like you've read over and over on the reviews here, the main guy is some red headed dweeb, with his much better looking buddy, that are trying to double date these two girls who are also best friends.  Of the two girls, one is your typical seventies high school slut, and the other girl is actually very resistant (at first) to want to put out for the guy.  So, as the four of them are together, and as the good girl continues to put up resistance to the red headed dweebs sexual conquests, the other guy and girl (her friend) try to make her feel like she's not cool.  That alone, makes this film seem so out-dated to today's social behavior amongst teens.

But, I'm glad to have this film on DVD, regardless of it's poor picture and sound quality.  It's definitely low budget.  The cool van itself was probably half the expense of making this film.  And what really gets me is that it is Rated R, which I have no doubt of, but wait a minute, I was only 16 when I went to the theatre to see it.  I guess in Michigan, at the low class filthy theatre that was in my town, they didn't bother to check my ID.  They just took my dollar and let me in.  That is all the more reason why we laugh at the seventies.  We lived a very confusing era in pop culture.  Moral decency took a back seat then.

There is no doubt that there will never be a High Definition Blu-Ray release of this film.  So, if you see this DVD, and you are like me, wanting to collect elements of seventies pop culture, buy it as the DVD that it is.  It is not worthy of re-issue, I am sure.  I might be one of the last few weirdos left in this world that would keep and watch such a politically incorrect, and socially indecent, film like this.",1266624000,,2515,4.121149897330596

Not so cool like ""Two Lane Blacktop"" or ""Vanishing Point""  for example (miles away from these) but who cares? Fu Manchu said: The Action is go!",1231632000,,270,4.625

Had to be written by a 12/14year old boy , its hilarious in the same way as watching an old chips episode. Wow was there a lot of drug use in hollywierd in the 70's",1518393600,,342,4.044117647058823
