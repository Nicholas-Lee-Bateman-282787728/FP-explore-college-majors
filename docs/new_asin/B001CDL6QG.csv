3509480,4,B001CDL6QG,My husband and I really enjoyed this DVD.  We are looking forward to seeing Frank Caliendo in person in February.,1232841600,,113,4.65
3509481,4,B001CDL6QG,I have really enjoyed this DVD.  It has made me laugh over and over.,1231804800,,68,3.857142857142857
3509482,3,B001CDL6QG,"I'm a huge fan of Frank Caliendo.  I bought the Giggles Shaky Cam DVD off of his website and the Make the Voices Stop CD and both Frank on the Radio CDs.  That's all hilarious, wonderful stuff.  Then he released this half-hearted hodgepodge of half-bits that is funny if you haven't seen him before, but a disappointment if you're looking for new material.  I feel like this was phoned in.  I'm sad.",1228867200,3,399,4.486111111111111
3509483,5,B001CDL6QG,"THis is very funny, and also very clean.  one or two slightly suggestive double entendres, but otherwise have no fear of the kids viewing it. HE has that Robin Williams quality of shifting from one personality to the next vey quickly.  I lent this to my sister, and she already lent it to someone else; I hope I get it back ! I think you'll really enjoy it...",1228780800,8,359,4.264705882352941
3509484,3,B001CDL6QG,"Frank is a funny guy with a lot of voices, but unfortunately this routine doesn't really do much with them. If you're a fan of Frank's CD release, you'll have heard about 80% of this act. It's kind of sad that he's had years between that CD and this release, but he hasn't come up with much new material. Brian Regan and Jeff Dunham have released 2 DVDs in the past two years and come up with completely new acts.

What little new material that is there is funny at times. Absolutely the standout moment in the show is a part of the bonus materials. It's an encore presentation in which Frank does a Jonathan Winters impression that is absolutely hilarious and spot-on. Then it's back to his standard ""Chris Farley is Batman"" closer.

The bonus materials on the DVD are the encore, a quick look at some of the makeup work on him, some spots with him doing John Madden out in different places, and a short blooper reel.

If you have Frank's CD, you can skip this. If this is your first introduction to his work, it's funny.",1223078400,25,1022,4.368421052631579

3509513,5,B001CDL6QG,"I've seen this show Frank's a couple of times before and because I love it so much, I ordered it.",1403568000,,97,3.9
3509514,5,B001CDL6QG,"I've seen him on mad tv years ago & he was hysterical. this is good stuff, but if you really want to see him at his very best, watch the old Mad TV series with him and you'll be on the floor in no time.",1391558400,,202,3.511111111111111
3509515,5,B001CDL6QG,Frank is so sharp and I love the things he comes up with. My 12 year old and I always reference his jokes. Best comedian ever in my book!,1390003200,,137,3.7586206896551726
3509516,5,B001CDL6QG,This video is hilarious. His impressions are flawless. Close your eyes and you'd swear George Bush and John Madden (among MANY others) walked into your home.,1377993600,,157,5.076923076923077
3509517,4,B001CDL6QG,"When they say ""All Over the Place"" that's exactly what they mean!  He's back and forth from one person to the next.  It's hard to follow at times, but hilarious!",1376265600,,161,4.333333333333333
3509518,3,B001CDL6QG,"10 minutes into this i got bored.  He is very funny and clever, but its the same thing over and over",1371945600,,100,3.761904761904762
3509519,5,B001CDL6QG,"Love impressions and Frank is the best.  Kept me laughing the whole time.  Bush, Barkley, Dinero, Madden, Pacino.  All great",1370649600,,124,5.1
3509520,5,B001CDL6QG,"We saw this on Netflex and liked it so much, we ordered it. We watch it with company that come over and never tire of seeing it.",1368403200,,128,3.7777777777777777
3509521,5,B001CDL6QG,An absolute must if you wanna see an excellent performance by a great impressionist. I watched it half a dozen times already!,1367107200,,125,4.7272727272727275
3509522,4,B001CDL6QG,"I think Frank Caliendo is the best impressionist of George Bush I've ever seen.  He is hilarious!  He also does a great Bill Clinton, John Madden and Charles Barkley.  The first 25 to 30 minutes of the video is great and then it kind of looses its ""hilarity"" the last 10 or 15minutes.",1364428800,,284,4.320754716981132
3509523,5,B001CDL6QG,"Product was in excellent condition, although his comedy material is a little dated.  I think baby boomer men would really enjoy this.",1361923200,,133,5.045454545454546
3509524,4,B001CDL6QG,A very funny funny man and has a great talent to make me laugh. A good DVD that plays well,1357171200,,90,3.55
3509525,5,B001CDL6QG,We laughed so hard and are still laughing! Frank Caliendo is hilarious with his impressions! Watch again we you need to laugh to relieve stress.,1341619200,,144,4.8
3509526,4,B001CDL6QG,"Frank is a real talented guy.  He can do so many voices and faces that it is amazing. See him change from Bush to Robin Williams and then ""Boom"", to John Madden.  His impressions are superb; his material could be a lot funnier with better writers.  Who am I to say...he is booked in Vegas on a 10 year contract.  Hmmmm....is that good thing??",1285632000,,342,4.296875
3509527,2,B001CDL6QG,"Purchased this video after seeing a couple of clips of Mr. Caliendo on YouTube.  He does some really funny impressions, but there is a lot of repetition due to the limited material.  After five or ten minutes it starts to get old.  You can only watch his head-bobbing imitation of President Bush so many times before you start wanting to see something different.  Cannot recommend this video.",1281312000,5,392,4.8059701492537314
3509528,3,B001CDL6QG,"Funny for what it is, a nonstop impression marathon. I appreciate and enjoy Frank Caliendo's brand of humor, and his ability to take on so many different roles is amazing. However, as one reviewer mentioned, one of the problems with this particular show is that if you've seen Caliendo on television, then most of this stuff won't surprise you. You'll still probably get some laugh out loud moments, but some of the bits and gags get a bit repetitive (he goes back to Bill Clinton and George W. Bush again and again), and, as the title alludes to, Caliendo doesn't have any real direction in this act, but seems to be ""all over the place."" Still, it is worth the viewing just to see the repertoire of characters he can impersonate: Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, John Madden,  Charles Barkley, Adam Sandler, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Dr. Phil, Jerry Seinfeld. I thought his best bits were the impressions of John Madden, and his football analysis. He even has some lesser known talents in there too.  Over all, better than average but there is probably some funnier Caliendo stand up out there.

3  stars",1266537600,3,1104,4.675257731958763
3509529,4,B001CDL6QG,"Frank Caliendo is a talented impressionist. If you like his impression of John Madden and George W., you will love this DVD. He is right on with his impression of Kramer and Jerry Seinfeld and others! Funny stuff.",1260230400,,213,4.631578947368421
3509530,4,B001CDL6QG,"The DVD that I ordered arrived in a most timely manner (less than 1 week) and although it was a used product, the quality was very good as well as the way it was shipped. It was packaged as though it was a new product. Thanks.",1254700800,,226,3.9347826086956523

3509532,5,B001CDL6QG,Frank caliendo is an excellent comedian and impressionist.  His take on his subjects is very insightful and funny.,1253404800,,114,5.333333333333333
3509533,5,B001CDL6QG,"Frank Caliendo is the best impressionist to come along in years.  Not only are his voices perfect, his facial expressions and gestures are fantastic.  I've watched this video 5 times now and it makes me laugh every time.  I'm buying it for several birthday gifts!",1234828800,3,263,4.8
3509534,5,B001CDL6QG,"When you want to hear impersonations from a comedian, look no further.  Frank's impressions are as realistic as they get.  I don't know many people who can do a dead on impression of George Bush and John Madden and have practically the same mannerisms.  This is not only a hilarious DVD, but this also proves that comedians can be funny without being obnoxiously raunchy.  I don't mind when comedians swear at all, but some just have a very limited vocabulary (i.e. Andrew Dice Clay).  Check this one out.",1233878400,2,505,4.693181818181818

8287061,5,B001CDL6QG,Awesome stand up special from Mr. Caliendo.  He really puts a lot of work into his comedy and impressions and it shows especially in this comedy special.  I wish his show was still going but he has a You Tube page and it is filled with great clips.  Especially his Donald Trump skits.,1470441600,,284,4.320754716981132
