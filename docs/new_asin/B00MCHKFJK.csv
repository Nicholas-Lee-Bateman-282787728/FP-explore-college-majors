6568070,3,B00MCHKFJK,"I love Air Supply, I really do, but their concerts are mostlly ""the greatest hits,"" and how  many times can one sit through an audience sing-along.  The boys are older.  Russell is still in great voice, Graham not so much.  If you have another sing-along DVD of theirs, there are about two different songs, all the rest are the hits.",1434067200,,333,4.5
