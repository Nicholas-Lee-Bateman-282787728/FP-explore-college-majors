8425667,4,B004DMIIVY,I enjoyed this series very much.  I re-watch the episodes over from time to time and catch a lot that I missed when I first sat down to watch.,1386460800,,142,3.896551724137931
8425668,5,B004DMIIVY,"I didn't know what to expect from this, but found it to be a very entertaining anime from start to finish.  I would buy it again, if I ever lost this series.",1371081600,,157,3.90625
8425669,3,B004DMIIVY,found this series entertianing and enjoyable but offered nothing really special. Typical humor and plot lines. Would have given 3 and half stars but the scale wouldn't allow half stars.,1364860800,,185,5.2
8425670,4,B004DMIIVY,"In the far distant future, people live in large, domed moving cities, because the outside air is poisonous and bug like monsters known as Contaminoids wander the earth. Zuelleni is an academic city where pretty much the entire population is made up of students and everything is run by the student council president. Layfon, a teenage boy with a mysterious past, comes to Zuelleni to escape said past. He wants to start his life anew, as a regular, average student. But too bad for him - upon arriving at school for the first day, he is immediately forced into the military arts program. He is assigned to the 17th Platoon, after leader Nina asks for him to fill a recently vacated spot on the team. The rest of the platoon consists of mechanical ace Harley, sharpshooter and ladies man Sharnid, and ne'in operator Felli. However, it is pretty soon evident that Layfon isn't in any need of military training.....

I actually quite enjoyed this series. I'm not really sure why, since there are many weak points and plot holes. But I think a big part of my enjoyment was the fact that Layfon starts out as an extremely strong fighter. It was kind of refreshing to have a character that didn't need to push his limits of endurance in order to master that next powerful technique so he can save... who or whatever. In addition, Layfon's technique is just really cool. He has as sword, which isn't very interesting, but he also wields a multi threaded whip like device. The threads are made of up his 'kei', so there are as many of them as he wants to generate, they are extremely sharp, and he has great control over them. It was just fun to watch any fight where he used that weapon.

I rated this half the series 4 stars, but really overall it is a 3 star show. I enjoyed the world the series was set in, I liked Felli and Layfon, I didn't really hate any of the characters, and the plot was interesting. However! There is no resolution in the end. All those questions raised during the course of the series? 2 are answered. Really. Layfon's reason for coming to Zuelleni and Leerin's relationship to the Queen are the only 2 explained. Out of, I dunno, 10 important questions? Yeah, basically 1/5 of the mystery behind the show is explained. The ending was really pathetic.

But despite the (enormous) setbacks, I still like the show and still think it is something worth watching for the random entertainment. I'll probably buy it once a cheap set comes out. But I will forever be disappointed with how the ending was handled.",1318204800,3,2526,4.571743929359823
8425671,4,B004DMIIVY,"Honestly, I liked this series. There's plenty of action, a decent amount of comedy & a splash of harem thrown in for kicks. I'm not going to go into detail about the series but I will say that I wish it was longer or had a season 2 because the ending will leave certain things unresolved & you wanting more. At least, that's how I felt about it.",1316304000,,345,4.088235294117647
8425672,3,B004DMIIVY,"This is a fun show.  The art is well-done and the English actors also do a good job.  The plot is a bit slow to start but relatively interesting.  The characters are all likeable enough and their interactions work well as long as provide some humor and drama.  The action scenes are well-done and visually interesting.

The thing I like most about the show is also its biggest weakness.  Namely the fact that the main character Layfon, is a total fighting beast.  It's nice to see a protagonist that starts out strong rather than someone who starts out a bumbling fool and becomes strong.  On the other hand Layfon is so strong, that it starts to get ridiculous.  The rest of Layfon's platoon really don't seem to matter because he is so monstrously strong.  If the show had a little more balance between Layfon's strength and everyone else's, I would have rated it higher.

Is this show worth getting?  I would say yes, but make sure to buy it on a sale.",1314835200,,955,4.488372093023256
8425673,3,B004DMIIVY,"Chrome Shelled Regios is ultimately a decent watch if a bit confusing. Much of what the Amazon review says is accurate and (spoiler alert) don't expect anything to be explained by the time you finish the series. That being said the art direction is pretty, the plot (while confusing and unexplained) is moderately interesting and the characters are likable. I would say if you're a fan of Sci-Fi anime you ought to give it a watch and the current sale price would probably be worth it, but you definately have to give it a little bit to warm up (and perhapse ignore the bizarre sub-plot that keeps popping up and is obviously supposed to lead somewhere that it doesn't) as much of it's watchability is in the characters, which means you need time to connect to them. It's entertaining, but the lack of explination/resolution will leave you a little wanting and ultimately keep it from being something more than what it is. I would give it 3.5 out of 5 stars. It's perhapse -slightly- above average for it's genre.",1299801600,4,1013,4.664804469273743
