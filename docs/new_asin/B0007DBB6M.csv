8047059,5,B0007DBB6M,"I've tried several Pilates videos, but they all seem impersonal and are either way too challenging for a novice like myself, or feel like simple movement with little focus on rationale or real results. I found this program to be challenging yet do-able, with a rationale for every movement and clear guidance throughout. Best of all, I achieve real results!! After all, that's what real Pilates should achieve. The instructor is personable and knows her craft. I'd like to attend a real session with her in person, but this video feels like I already am. I hope to see more videos from this fabulous instructor.",1118275200,15,611,4.828571428571428
8047060,5,B0007DBB6M,"I've been practicing Pilates at home with videos/DVDs for several years, and have grown tired of most of the offerings available.  It seems like they're all pretty much alike.  However, I found this one to be a refreshing, and fun, change.  There are 3 sections:  arm work, a magic circle section that includes both leg and arm exercises, and a short section with your back body completely up against a wall.  I especially liked the section using the Pilates magic circle (aka Pilates ring).  You can tell the instructor really knows her stuff (and you're sure to like her cute little doggie, too!).  Recommended for all Pilates enthusiasts who want something new to challenge them.",1114128000,14,682,4.878260869565217
8047061,5,B0007DBB6M,Easy to follow. One feels as if Ms. Isaacson is in the room personally showing you what to do. Her charming French accent guides you through each movement within this gentle method for obtaining flexibility and strong core muscles.,1108252800,10,231,4.948717948717949
8047062,5,B0007DBB6M,"It is a pleasure performing these authentic pilates movements with Catherine as my guide. It is very soothing to listen to her as she guides your breathing and movement every step of the way. Her directions are easy to follow,clear and concise. The DVD is set in a beautiful english garden, which adds to the serenity. Catherine is obviously at home in front of the camera, with a one on one intimacy that makes me feel that she is

talking to me alone. She is a master at her craft.

I love the interactive aspect of this DVD.Once I absorbed the insightful Key Principals of the Method,I could skip directly to any desired exercise segment, or play the entire program. The copy on the screen reinforces the training,and sophisticated segment transitions enhance the viewing experince.

I appreciate that this is a DVD that I can grow into, starting out with the basics and adding weights and other movements that Catherine talks about, once I've mastered the basics.",1107907200,13,967,4.778443113772455
