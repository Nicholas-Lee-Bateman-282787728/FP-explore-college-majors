8507204,1,B006ZRZLII,A very B movie; this was purchased by accident. Not worth watching,1417651200,,66,4.583333333333333
8507205,4,B006ZRZLII,"Dan Poole made an exciting love letter to the comics he grew up on with a non-Hollywood budget and crew. For what it was, it had some amazing effects work and some serious work was done in the production design. Has its slow moments, but the visuals and the action sequences make up for it. Inspirational for anyone looking to break into the independent film scene.",1406505600,,365,4.545454545454546
8507206,1,B006ZRZLII,"Its so bad it doesn't bear the importance of giving it a full review. I just want to say it was a waste of an hour and a half of my life and money.

First of all, I'll give most movies a bit of thought before I decide whether I like it, or don't like it. Now this movie is neither a drama, an action movie, nor a comedy, it's more like a BAD STAGE PLAY. The acting was just amateur, the camera work was noticeably bad. The effects were goofy and tacky, the dialogue was cringe-fully bad, the casting was all wrong, everything and I mean everything about this movie was both LAZY and BORING. There was nothing about this movie that I liked, in fact I'll go one step further and say, it was just plain AWFUL.

All in all, this movie was an incredibly bad, low budget, poorly acted steaming pile of horrible. Don't waste your time and money.

DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. You have been warned.

If you want to watch a GREAT Indie Superhero Movie, spend your money and watch ""SPARKS"" instead!",1399680000,,982,4.207446808510638
8507207,2,B006ZRZLII,"I watched it, suffered through it and at several points it was as though Jay focused his brown noise wave on my bowels.  It was bad enough that I almost crapped my pants.

Its so bad, I'm going to make my friends watch it.  Its like ""Dude, OMG, this smells like ****, You've gotta smell it!""",1337644800,3,291,4.160714285714286
8507208,4,B006ZRZLII,"Brian Razzino, as the evil industrialist making human mutants in order to get richer (and possibly achieve world domination) is a standout in this new sci-fi flick.",1327449600,2,164,5.111111111111111
