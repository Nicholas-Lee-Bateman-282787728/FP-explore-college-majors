It has plenty of interesting interviews and exciting fight clips.  As a bonus, about 80% of  the first Frazier-Ali bout is shown.  However, the price tag for this  series is a bit steep.  Maybe as a Christmas present.......",951609600,11,349,4.4603174603174605

876870,4,6304446640,I picked this up mainly to see the fights.  2 Discs and it's pretty generous with quite a bit of his fights.  The background is generally good but I thought he was idolized a bit too much especially when they go on about him and the draft.  He's a great fighter but as with all humans he had he's flaws.  Still if you want to see at least parts of a lot of his fights this would be something of interest.  I had hope you could just get all his fights to view but that doesn't appear to be possible.  So FWIW.  I would recommend it to someone interested in the fights.  This documentary doesn't really go into aspects of his personal life that exposes the not so commendable qualities of Ali: women and race.,1442361600,,707,4.185185185185185

876923,2,6304446640,"The DVD version of Muhammad Ali: The Whole Story is definitely NOT the ""whole story."" The original version of this documentary was aired on cable TV and featured interviews with the two teenage girls that Ali fathered children with while he was in this 30s - and still married to Belinda - and a father of four girls. One of the teens he married in a ""Muslim"" ceremony, which made him a bigamist. Decent men do not do this, nor do they humiliate their wives in public, the way Ali did to Wife No. 2 Belinda, before his third fight with Frazier in The Philippines.

Exalting Ali for his courage in standing up to the government for resisting the draft should be tempered when he failed to demonstrate courage and / or integrity in other episodes of his life.  Ali remained loyal to the gangster hate-cult known as the Nation of Islam for more than 10 years. Where was Ali's courage and integrity in standing up to the NOI after Malcolm X's murder? Probably in the same place it was when this ""man of the people"" accepted millions to fight in countries run by oppressive, murderous dictators.

When black people were fighting for the rights of full citizens, Ali, Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad were in Chicago ridiculing Martin Luther King and other ""so-called negroes."" There isn't a single episode that advanced civil rights for black people from the 1950s-1970s that Ali took part in -- or lent his vocal or financial support to. None!

Many Ali supporters in the media loathe Don King. But it was Ali who opened the door to boxing for King. And Ali fought for King several times after his dubious reputation was established. In fact, Ali was an invited guest of King's when the promoter was inducted into the Boxing Hall of Fame - in 1997. (That counts as an endorsement, no?).

Ali was an extraordinary boxer and his legacy in the ring is well deserved. It's disappointing as well as disturbing that the publishers of this project had the hubris to call it: ""The Whole Story"" when they deliberately sanitized the final product. Some less than flattering episodes are covered, but those that were have already been addressed in other books and documentaries. Outside the ring, his many transgressions and contradictions, supported by irrefutable facts, have to be ignored -- and virtues need to be manufactured -- to consider Ali a humanitarian, let alone a civil rights icon.",1382140800,4,2378,4.720481927710844

876975,5,6304446640,I love Muhammad Ali and this DVD captures his rise to the top as the greatest boxer of all time. He is so charismatic and humorous and I loved watching hours of his interviews and fights. I sure wish that they'd come out with a collection of his interviews because more than being a great boxer he was a great individual and expressed himself well even if no one wanted to hear him. He was one guy you couldn't keep quiet. I hate that Parkinsons has taken away his voice moreso than his ability to fight. Overall I think this is a great set to add to any Ali lovers' collection.,1362614400,3,578,4.216216216216216

876984,5,6304446640,"I grew up in the 80s when Mike Tyson was in his prime and as far as I knew, the greatest heavyweight that has ever lived. My pop did not agree. He then proceeded to tell me a story about how he won a hefty bet in 1964 on a 7 to 1 young underdog fighting a tough veteran Sonny Liston. My pop is not easily impressed so to hear him speak so highly of someone naturally sparked my interest.

After reading a few highly rated reviews and also showing an exceptional amount of fight footage, I purchased Muhammad Ali - The Whole Story. Originally wanting to see Ali knock people out, the documentary telling of, a then Cassius Clay growing up in a time and place where the color of his skin was against him, quickly made me come to respect him as a man.

Not before long, the footage brought a proper image to what my pop said about him. I was amazed of just how much fight footage was included! From his fights as a light heavyweight in the Olympics to Larry Holmes in the 1980s, you don't get a highlight reel, but an almost real time capturing of how his feet, ring generalship, blazing speed, jabs, combinations and eventually his wits, heart and his iron jaw helped him overcome countless opponents as well as life's obstacles.

What really made me respect Ali so much more is how he handled loss. A long time boxing fan, I've seen what happens to more than a few promising boxers when they finally lose. It's like they lose their nerve and they're just not themselves in the ring. Ali showed that he's both physically and mentally carved out of stone. The man came back after a 3 and a half year absence (which is also considered a heavyweight's prime years) losing his edge (his speed and reflexes, slightly) and even after two losses, decided with no fear, to face the man who beat both Joe Frazier and Ken Norton, the two men that beat Ali. He stood toe-to-toe or toe-to-rope with a younger stronger George Foreman and adapted himself not to out-dance but to outlast the formidable Foreman in what is among the most famous knockouts in boxing history.

After winning the heavyweight championship for a second time, Ali and Frazier met for two more battles. The third meeting has become legendary. Ali's repeated and demeaning comments to Frazier just turned Frazier into a machine that would not stop moving forward regardless of how much Ali threw at him. Ali never got flustered or discouraged at Frazier's constant pressure. After 14 rounds, these two warriors left it all in the ring in one of boxing most brutal wars.

The footage from there shows life after The Thrilla in Manila. Ali's love for boxing and life and just not being able to walk away and how to this day, he still overcomes adversity. And despite having Parkinson's is still as witty as ever. The last part of the DVD also has a shot that will make your eyes mist up.

The nearly 6 hours of this DVD really made me inspired by Muhammad Ali. Not just as a fighter, but as a man. A man who stood up for his beliefs even though it cost him his best years as a heavyweight. A man with not only the talent but the intelligence to harness that talent. Even when the talent isn't what it once was, he adapted, showed he can not only dish it out but take it as well, and he never lost his confidence and will to be a champion. Now don't get me wrong, Tyson in his prime was still great, but my pop was right, Muhammad Ali is truly the greatest of all time.",1312070400,6,3423,4.365777080062794

Unbelievable picture quality is the first thing.  You get to see the washed up bleached kinetiscope picture cleaned up with amazing clarity.  Even on VHS, the picture quality is quite apparent especially in volumes 1 & 2.

There are many Ali biographies and documentaries but this one has footage I've never seen and I've been an Ali collector and fan for over 50 years.

877034,5,6304446640,"This three-disc documentary about the career of Muhammad Ali is amazing, worth more than 100 miscast biopics put together. It tells the whole story, from his youth to his gold medal to his ascension to the championship to his exile from the sport and right through to the end of his fighting days and his later-life bout with Parkinson's. It works for fans of Ali, obviously, but it also works if you want a general primer on boxing history or even an overview of the social, cultural, and political tumult of the 60's. Love him or hate him, the man is an icon, and this has all the footage and all the interviews with all the people who know and were there. An absolute must-have.",1138752000,4,681,4.456
877035,5,6304446640,"When you pose with Muhammad Ali for photographs what he likes to do is have you make a fist and put it up against the side of the face while he assumes a boxing pose, so you look like you are landing a heavy blow against the only man ever to win the heavyweight boxing title three times.  However, when it was my turn to pose there was no way on earth I was going to pretend I was beating up on the Champ, so I just wanted to shake hands.  This gave Ali a chance to give me bunny ears.

""Muhammad Ali: The Whole Story"" is a six-part documentary that chronicles legendary career: (1) ""The Beginning: Olympic Gold"" covers his years as an amateur.  There is very little about Ali's career before he began boxing (one of the stories his mother tells is how as a baby he hit her in the mouth and loosened a tooth: ""his first knockout"" she says proudly).  (2) ""The Youngest Heavyweight"" looks at the start of Cassius Clay's professional career, leading up to his winning the heavyweight crown from Sonny Liston.  (3) ""Exile"" contrasts Muhammad Ali's title defenses with the rises problems tied to both his conversion to Islam and his refusal to be drafted, which ends with him being stripped of his title.

Disc B begins with (4) ""The Road Back,"" where it takes three years for Ali to get another fight, culminating in losing his first fight to Joe Frazier.  (5) ""The Rumble in the Jungle"" ends with Ali winning back the title from George Foreman, after breaking his jaw and losing to Ken Norton.  Finally, (6) ""The Thrilla in Manila"" makes the third and final fight with Joe Frazier the centerpiece for the end of Ali's career, with less attention being paid to Ali losing and winning back the title from Michael Spinks than to the final title fight with Larry Holmes, after which Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson's Syndrome.

Ali is not interviewed for this documentary, although he appears in some shots at the end.  Talking about the champ is left to the men who worked in his corner (e.g., Angelo Dundee), the men that he fought (e.g., Ken Norton), the reporters who covered the fights (e.g., Howard Cosell), and the women that he married (e.g., Lonnie Ali).  Their recollections and insights are offered in between, and sometimes during, film and video of Ali's fights, news footage, and television appearances (including Ali singing on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" with the cast from the Broadway musical he did while in exile).  For most of the key fights in Ali's career there are extended sequences and not just highlights.  By the time you get to the Foreman and final Frazier fights it seems odd that there are commentators talking throughout the fight because most of the early fights are without commentary, and while directors Joseph and Sandra Consentino sometimes like the likes of Ali's trainer Angelo Dundee provide some insight, more often than not they just add nothing to what we are watching.

The strength of this documentary is that we get to watch Ali fight and listen to him talk more than we do the others.  Even when we get to the talking heads we hear more from Dundee and journalist Jerry Izenberg than we do from Howard Cosell (which reminds me of an interesting omission: we do not get to the point following the first Liston fight when Clay yells, ""I'm a bad man!"").  Also, what they have to say is usually descriptive, telling what they remember, rather than trying to offer explanations for the subject.  That is until the end, when there is an obvious attempt to put Ali in perspective.  This is led primarily to Lonnie Ali, which is a smart move because there is nobody who is going to be more articulate on that score than Ali's wife.

The one thing I wanted more of from this 1996 television documentary was an explanation of Ali's fighting technique.  At one point Angelo Dundee is talking about how Ali had three main punches with the left jab setting up his right upper cut and his left hook.  So I really wanted to see some examples of this from some of these fights.  But there are only a couple of times when a specific knockout punch is looked at in any detail (e.g., the ""phantom"" punch from the second Liston fight and the four-punch combination that dropped George Foreman).  Overall the lesson is that when he was young Ali was too quick too hit, and later on when he slowed down he discovered he could take a punch.  Add that throughout his career Ali was usually in better condition and was always smarter, and that is the legacy with which we are left.  Clearly with Ali we are talking about the ""art"" of boxing, but a bit more of the ""science"" of the sport would be nice too.",1126224000,33,4618,4.5404101326899875

It felt like a treat to watch the fights I've only read about - I watched both Liston fights! - how many people can say that?
As the fights are concerned - you get to see them! - you get to watch Ali dance and dance - you get to watch him float like a butterfly and sting like a bee - you get to watch him apply his craft - I've never seen the amount of Ali fights as I did on the day I watched these videos. To be fair - some of the fights you only get a couple of important rounds - but as a whole this is the greatest of any Ali VHS/DVD I've ever seen.
You get to see some others interviewed about Muhammad Ali - from his brother - To Angelo Dundee - to Malcolm X - it' just incredable the amount of footage that this makes available to you.

This set has so much footage of his fights it is amazing.  They show nearly all of the Ali-Frazier I fight.  They even show some of the Thrilla in Manila!  They show the entire Rumble in the Jungle with Foreman.  They show footage from 2 of his fights with Kenny Norton!  They show clips of his fight with Holmes!  They show him as an amateur, his first pro fight!  They show him fight on his way to his first title.  They show both Liston fights...I could go on!
What an amazing collection of footage.  Then the commentary!  Wow!  His past handlers, his brother, Angelo Dundee, sports writers from the 60's and 70's...all these guys give commentary throughout the 6 episodes that carry you from fight to fight.

But it is a very thorough account of Ali's career, great for die-hard fans, but it can be boring for anyone who's not into boxing or Ali himself.
Tons of footage and fight highlights.",1009670400,7,449,4.487804878048781

7871207,5,6304446640,"I have had this DVD for a number of years now and with the recent sad passing of ""Muhammad Ali"" I had the urge to see it again and as others have mentioned you will NOT see a better documentary than Muhammad Ali ""The Whole Story"". There are 2 discs with 3 one hour episodes on each disc and it takes you through from where he was born and raised. To when he learnt the art of boxing after having his bicycle stolen at 12, he was so upset that he was heard to say ""he'd whip the person who stole his bicycle and as fate had it he was told you better know how to fight first from a police officer who also trained boxers and so began his journey into boxing. Footage of his amateur fights and Olympic games win in 1960 Rome and then after returning home sometime later he allegedly threw his medal into the river in disgust after not being served in a local caf. Followed by his turning pro and venture to win the Heavyweight world title. Also shown are his 2 bouts with Sonny Liston, Henry Cooper, Joe Frazier (2 bouts), Ken Norton (2 bouts) the rumble in the jungle with George Foreman and many more great bouts on this outstanding DVD. Also his life outside the ring and the interviews with his trainer Angelo Dundee, his doctor and many great boxers and sporting journalists giving an insight into the great man and each and every fight. You'll laugh and cry and maybe even cry laughing but most of all you'll be amazed by this brilliant documentary on the ""Greatest of All Time"".",1465171200,,1482,4.296428571428572
