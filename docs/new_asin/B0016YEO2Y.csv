8264231,5,B0016YEO2Y,"A WONDERFUL FILM...JAZZY MUSIC INTERSPERSED THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE.  There is a beautiful piano piece of Beyond The Sea at the end of the movie while the credits are runing.  I have looked in vain for a You Tube rendition or a CD where I could find this exact rendition.  Please make that special piano piece available on CD or MP3.  Patricia Kaas puts this movie in a First Class position.  I was lucky enough to get two used copies--otherwise, the movie is pricey.",1461801600,,464,4.542168674698795
