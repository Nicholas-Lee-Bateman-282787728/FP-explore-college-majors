1947673,2,B0000UX5YI,"Tomie one super hot love-love cutie. Tomie steal boyfriends from other girls. Other girls not like this. They write ""Demon Girl"" on Tomie's pictures. Boys see pictures, they go crazy and chop Tomie's head off. Bye bye, Tomie.
But Tomie CANNOT DIE. Tomie come back, kill everyone you know, and make you eat a bug. So THERE, girls who write nasty things on Tomie's pictures! And there is a twist ending! Very surprising! Also completely impossible to understand! Ah, so frightening!
More to the point, this odd, sadistic film drags on endlessly before finally reaching an inane and bloody conclusion that makes no sense whatsoever. I only recommend it to rabid fans of gore movies that make you feel icky and sleepy at the same time.",1086566400,25,731,4.809523809523809
1947674,2,B0000UX5YI,"I have been a fan of Junji Ito's work since Uzumaki. Chances are if it has his name on it, I've read it,seen it, or both. The man and his work are inspiring for manga/horror. Tomie(the movie) is slow paced at best, the acting is sub-par, and just...what was going on here? So many plot holes you could drive a convoy of semi's through. Also if you got the ending of this film consider yourself lucky. By the end I thought it was a David Lynch film. On the upside the subtitles were excellent, but understanding what they said only confused me more. Good luck.",1082505600,3,559,4.333333333333333
1947675,4,B0000UX5YI,"Despite most of the negative or mediocre reviews of this film I have come across, I must say I enjoyed this film. Based off of Junji Ito's long running Manga series of the same title, Tomie is my personal favorite out of his adapted to film catalogue (the other titles that I have seen consist of the Tomie sequels and the first theatrical Uzumaki film).
  Tomie has a feel that is not reminiscant of other Japanese horror titles such as the Ring or Ju-on. Yes, on the surface similarities exist, but the over-all feel is more creative and artistic, thus seeming more like a quirky art film and less like a typical Japanese horror film. This comes through particularly well in the music, written perfectly by Hiroshi Futami, using guitar and vocoder tracks, the cast choices, including Mami Nakumara of Tokyo Trash Baby and Tomorowo Tamaguchi of Tetsuo:the Iron Man, and the choice of director/screenwriter Ataru Oikawa (who has worked with Kiyoshi Kurosawa on select screenplays and previously directed the Boy Made in Japan).
  This film was shot on grainy digital video which creates a more realistic and off-beat feel, versus the over-stylized cinematography of the next two Tomie installments(It should be noted that Tomie-replay was released with Uzumaki on a double bill in Japan, and both are superior to Tomie in production values).
  If you like the recent wave of Japanese horror films to be imported to the U.S., but want a film with less detective work and more visual substance I highly reccomend Tomie(I would like to note that Tomie-Replay and Uzumaki are both great films worth adding to any Japanese/Horror collection).",1078704000,5,1637,4.956204379562044

1947677,3,B0000UX5YI,"I saw this movie a few months ago on an import dvd.  I do have to say, the movie was VERY VERY slow.  It had some creepy moments, and some good acting, but in the end, it was just to slow.  Also, there is some very out of place nudity, and some sequences (like the flash back of the death of a particular student) that just fall flat due to weak direction.  Maybe Replay will be better.  I shall see.",1073174400,4,400,3.95
8003245,5,B0000UX5YI,"A truly great jHorror picture!  Tomie is a killer, inspired character . . .  The Fx are pretty good too, amazingly.  I really liked the sequence where the fellow had a piece of Tomie in a box and she was regenerating over time:  well shot sequence!",1480636800,,248,4.326086956521739

8003247,1,B0000UX5YI,I am extremely unhappy with this purchase because they sent me the wrong film. What I received was not the same as the picture or the description of the film.,1418860800,,158,4.3
8003248,2,B0000UX5YI,"An odd movie, from the description provided I was expecting a nifty little horror movie.  What I watched was anything but a horror movie.  In fact, it barely registered as supernatural.  Yes, a head was involved, carried in a grocery bag, but that alone wasn't enough to provide any thrills or chills.  The head soon became a girl, the girl became a pest, and a few people died off-screen.  It was all pretty ho-hum.  Things were suggested, not shown.  I suppose you could say it was dark and moody, but that was due to poor lighting conditions rather than an active attempt to create a purposeful atmosphere.  As a menacing demon, all this weird girl did was giggle a lot and tease people.  She seemed pretty average as ancient teens go, so I'm not quite certain where the danger was supposed to come into play.  She yapped and waggled a bug in a girl's face, hardly the stuff of nightmares.  In fact, when her face was finally revealed, it proved to be unflatteringly normal.  I was not impressed, frightened, or moved to order any of the other movies in this series.
Instantly forgettable.",1340496000,,1092,4.601036269430052
8003249,4,B0000UX5YI,"Tomie is a schoolgirl who has the good fortune to be killed, over and over again. Why good fortune? Because she's really a demon in disguise, and with each death she multiplies and sends men to Hell. This first installment in the Tomie series tells of Tomie and Tsukiko, best friends at school until something happens that leaves Tomie missing and Tsukiko with strange dreams, but no memory. As Tomie regains her former powers, regrown from her severed head, she creeps closer and closer to Tsukiko and the truth of what happened. Tomie is a cult hero, a feminist nightmare--an evil demon who uses femininity to send men to Hell and spread the feminine mystique. The movies bring lots of men out, too, to see the beautiful Tomie--perhaps there is some truth to the tale?

The full Tomie story is not covered in any one installment; I suggest that you follow Tomie with Tomie: Another Face for more insight into Tomie's origins and purpose.",1288656000,4,939,4.725609756097561
8003250,5,B0000UX5YI,"Tomie is a slow, moody adaptation of a popular Japanese horror manga. Rather than directly ape the comics, the director took the themes he found most interesting (jealousy, obsession, competiveness between women) and went with them. He purposely leaves things vague, mysterious and unexplained.. letting our imagination go to work. He succeeds in creating an atmosphere of dread and hopelessness I found quite chilling.

The cast is excellent, especially Tsukiko, Tomie and the female doctor... this film has a gritty indie-film look and feel that works for it.

If you are looking for fast action, senseless violence and endless explanations... this isn't the film for you. But for the intelligent and open-minded film lover, there is much to admire here.",1183593600,,756,5.291666666666667
8003251,4,B0000UX5YI,"Tomie is a compelling story about this ""demon"" girl that makes men go mad with jealousy over her. I am one of the unfortunate people who have not read the Manga comics, but watching the movie made me an instant fan. I have become a huge fan. Though not scary, this horror movie is more of a suspense and mystery movie. Not much horror at all, but it's a different story with the sequels. Everyone talks about the theme song to the movie, and I have to agree, it's one of the best theme songs for any horror movie I have ever heard, it's very memorable. It's as memorable as the theme from Halloween.

This movie is awesome, but don't watch it if you want to see a movie that will scare your pants off, because not matter how good this movie is, it's not scary. The sequels, on the other hand, are more horror oriented and you know you're watching a horror movie. If you want a thought provoking, intelligent movie, this is for you. Unfortunately, because the people who made the movie assume you have read the comics, you will walk away from the movie confused at some parts. It's a 100% guarantee that if you haven't read the comics, you will have some confusion. The movie asks so many questions, but gives so few answers. Despite the confusion, the movie still comes off as a great movie. This is for anyone who loves Japanese movies. If you're like me, you will become an instant fan of the film series. I love it!",1117497600,13,1418,4.350943396226415
8003252,2,B0000UX5YI,"This movie must be great, since they made so many sequels, right?  All, I can make of that is that they saw it, and just had to save the bizarre and fascinating manga from the fate it suffers here, so they had to do it again.

There was so much potential here.  A story of a beautiful and terrifying girl who is repeatedly murdered by men who ""love"" her, and she always comes back.  A detective in the movie has been investigating her murder when he realizes that for many years, there have been murders reported with a victim named Tomie Kawakami, but none of the bodies have ever been found.  (It says on the back of the DVD that the murders date back to when Japan first became industrialized, and while I'm sure that's probably a pretty significant plot point, I don't remember them mentioning it anywhere in the actual movie.)  When the detective realizes what is happening, instead of finding the murderer, he instead becomes obsessed with finding Tomie Kawakami.  He knows she must really be a smokin' hot babe to drive all those men insane with passion to the point of killing her so many times.  This subplot is centered around the main character, who's boyfriend ditched her in high school for, you guessed it, a recent incarnation of Tomie.  Then he cut her head off.  Of course, she has this memory blacked out, like it's supposed to be some sort of a mystery we're trying to solve, but come on!  We already know that Tomie has been murdered a bunch of times.  So what else could it be?

I find the character of Tomie interesting, because she is like the hot babe in the slasher flick who gets iced in a way that many feminist theorists have interpreted as misogynist.  The girl serves a purpose of looking good (sometimes getting naked) and then dying a violent death for our entertainment.  We don't know anything more about her beyond our voyueristic viewing pleasure.  But Tomie is the beautiful slasher victim come back to life to terrorize her killer, not by actually DOING anything, but merely by living, and unnerving him with her unshakeable presence.

There is a lot here to explore.  There are so many unanswered questions about Tomie for us to ponder.  For example, we know that Tomie is immortal, but why does she end up killed so many times?  She seems to have an energy that causes men to fall in love with her, and go mad.  But why does she use it?  Does it amuse her to go back and stand in front of the person who saw her die by his hand?  What is also interesting is the brutal way in which she is killed.  You usually don't see her shot, poisoned, or hit on the head.  The one who decides to kill her usually chops her up into pieces.  So why do ordinary men all decide to do this?  Does she want them to?  We see her regenerate from a single chopped up body part.  Does she want to be dismembered so that she can replicate herself?  Or does she love to freak people out by appearing as a talking severed head?  Tomie stays young forever, but does she need to be killed in order to keep from aging?

The manga explored many of these themes, but in a way vague enough to not give us any true answers.  Unfortunately, the movie doesn't explore any of them, and plods along with some dull character development and minimal gore.  Now, if you're reading this, and saying to yourself, ""This chick doesn't understand Japanese horror subtlety, and just wants to see a bloody slasher flick,"" you're wrong.  I love the subtlety of Japanese horror, and between gore and plot, I will always opt for the latter.  But this doesn't have either one.

There is one interesting thing it does have, however.  The main character is very beautiful, and I don't mean that in a geeky, ""watch this cuz it's got hot chicks!"" kinda way.  But it gives more insight into what Tomie actually does.  The main character had a boyfriend in high school who fell in love with Tomie, and I found it quite interesting how much more striking she looked in contrast to Tomie.  In the behind the scenes footage, the actress playing Tomie was much prettier than she was in the film, which made it seem that making Tomie less attractive than her romantic rival was a conscious choice.  It seems that Tomie has the power to manipulate people, specifically males, into falling in love with her, and believing her to be the most beautiful woman in the world, when in fact, she's not.

Of all the Japanese horror out there, why did this one come out in the US before Uzumaki?  This is one film you'll never hear anyone begging Hollywood not to remake.",1100304000,17,4539,4.4629404617253945
8003253,1,B0000UX5YI,"I tried, I really, really tried to watch this one. I can get along with the choppy pacing that I often find plaguing Japanese films (I still managed to love the Katakuris), but this one just didn't work for me. I know I was helped by a drink beforehand, but this movie and it's glacial pace just put me to sleep.

Here's what I don't get. While the original manga doesn't start with a movie-length story, it does begin with quite a punch -- and yet the movie starts up with some silly segment where the big shock at the end looks like something that would have been silly ten years ago. The potential was there, Junji Ito's initial first story could have been nicely expanded to include those human, emotional moment that make the horrific much more so.

Instead we get lots of people talking about Tomie as she spends too long regenerating a body from her severed head and then... oh, I have no idea what happened in the end, I was asleep and haven't been able to motivate myself to put the disc back in the DVD player. Instead of seeing this movie, try to find yourself a copy of the original manga instead.",1097452800,4,1109,4.352657004830918

Photography student Tsukiko suffers from amnesia and insomnia, but when she does sleep, she dreams of herself covered in blood...

A detective is investigating the murder of a high school girl named Tomie, and its connection with similar murders in other locations, dating back over 100 years - all of a girl with the exact same name...

TOMIE is an effective Japanese thriller based on the manga by Junji Ito.  While there aren't really any big scares, it does build up some nice tension through skillful camerawork and deliberate pacing.  I don't think it'll keep me up at night like other Asian horror films of the past few years did, but it's an intriguing story that leaves room for mystery and imagination.

The DVD is presented in Japanese with optional white English subtitles, anamorphic widescreen, and Dolby digital 5.1 stereo, though I didn't notice any sound separation as I was watching.  The image quality is a bit washed-out looking, but it's good enough.  There are trailers for the five TOMIE films as well as a making-of featurette.

The film is unrated.  It is a bit bloody but not particularly graphic, and would be fine for teens and up.",1092960000,10,1298,4.72
