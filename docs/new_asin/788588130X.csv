7900607,5,788588130X,"I watched the movie several times. I even bought the video. Then I read the book. I suggest that you do it the other way around. Both have their strong points. The feel is the same. However, the book allowed other people to see and interact with Jennie. In the movie, only Eben (Joseph Cotton) sees Jennie (Jennifer Jones.) The portrait in the bar is different; it is probably some adjustment for the time of the movie. In addition, the ending is different. I am not sure which ending I like best. One interesting notation on the movie, it was shot with a filter that made the movie have a texture that looks like a portrait.

Any way I do not want to describe the plot. Therefore, I will tell you that it was nicer to get the Hardcover Buccaneer book, than some old yellowing thing from a secondhand store that costs just as much. I have it next to the video and still re-read it periodically.
