4597955,5,B00584A7MY,"First of all I have to say I love Beverly Lewis.  I have read all her books and was so excited when I heard about this movie based on her book ""The Shunning"".  I loved the book so anxiously anticipated the movie.

The movie was good, but I would probably have liked it better had I not read the book first.  I thought the story line was a little off from the book which was a little disappointing to me.  As for the movie alone, I enjoyed it.  We watched it as a family which is always a wonderful thing.  Unfortunately there aren't many good clean movies out there so we have a hard time finding movies to watch.  This one fit all our parameters.

Katie, an amish girl, engaged to be married to the town Bishop and in love with her childhood sweetheart who she thinks drowned years back.  He tugged at her interests in the outside world, music, guitars, the Englisher way of life.  The Bishop, however, is a widow with children who need a mama.  In the midst of all this, an English woman comes looking for Katie's mama, who becomes afraid of past secrets being revealed.

This movie is full of twists and turns, suspense, love, and trouble.  The only thing this movie is missing is a sequel which I will be looking for.

4597956,5,B00584A7MY,"Many of the movies based on Christian fiction have been VERY poor acting and too much changing of the book. I really liked this movie. It touches the heart. If you have adopted it perhaps is more likely to bring tears as it did when my husband and I watched it. We didn't particularly care how it ended so hoping for a sequel. The acting was great. LOVED the main character--she portrayed it well. Glad I bought this movie-we will definitely watch it again. I much prefer this one to ""Saving Sarah Cain."" No, I didn't like the wedding rings and things that are not really true, but they don't take away from a well written script that was acted out beautifully.",1316390400,3,661,4.426229508196721
4597957,4,B00584A7MY,"I don't read much Amish, I confess, but when I saw this movie coming out, I was intrigued. Directed by Micheal Landon Jr, The Shunning was adapted from Beverly Lewis' bestseller. While I did enjoy the movie, the ending left a lot to be desired. I know the book The Shunning is the first in a three-part series, so I can only conclude (and hope) that they plan to adapt the rest of the books to film.

Katie Lapp is the heroine of the movie. She's 20, loves playing the guitar (which is forbidden by The Order), loves to sing (also forbidden), and has her misgivings about her upcoming nuptials to widower John, the new bishop. Danielle Panabaker played a very vivacious and endearing Katie, in my opinion. All the actors in the movie did wonderfully well, though I thought it was kind of humorous to see all the makeup the Amish actors wore. :-P Something tells me the real Katie Lapp wouldn't have gloss on her lips or heavy liner and mascara on her eyes.

The history between Katie and Daniel seemed interesting, though in this adaptation it seemed like we got only the tip of the iceberg. The whole movie was very well put together and the peak into what a ""shunning"" really means for an Amish person was interesting. A very hard, still, and severe punishment, in my opinion. (I would not make a good Amish person! ;-)

So while I enjoyed the movie, the ending was really abrupt and left so many unanswered questions. When the credits started rolling, I felt like the actual storyplot was just getting started! Here Katie Lapp was, just found out she was adopted, leaving her family behind to go into the world and discover who she really is....and the movie ends. So, while The Shunning made for an enjoyable family movie, be prepared to want more when the movie ends.

4597958,3,B00584A7MY,"It is obvious Beverly Lewis did not participate in this movie after selling her rights. Because she would have told the director that an Amish woman does not wear make up (the main actress, very pretty, wears a ton of make up when on the farm and about); she would have told them that married Amish couples don't wear wedding rings....also the main actress gets flat-ironed hair after buying Englisher clothes and undoing her bun and removing her Kapp? Does not happen in real life.
I thought the daed and the mamm (in Pennsylvania Dutch :) were amazing actors! The main actress, too but she needs to love more like a ""natural"" Amish girl...ditch the make up (at least when you play the Amish part).
For those criticizing the end, don't be sad, this is a 3-part story :) So this is how the first book, The Shunning, ends :)
All in all a good movie but lacking something more Amish...can't define it really....but I am sure the next director can nail it down.",1316304000,16,958,4.511494252873563
4597959,5,B00584A7MY,"If you love books by Beverly Lewis you will love this movie made from her book The Shunning. This DVD is excellent and a must watch. The characters are very authentic and brilliant. You just feel like it is real, the characters and places feel very genuine.
  I was pulled into the story and was enthralled with it. The story is very heart-warming while being heart-breaking at the same time.
You will be drawn into two different worlds, Amish and English.
  Katie found out she was adopted as a baby. Her whole world seems to be falling apart. She loves singing and playing her guitar, but Amish frown upon musical instruments and will only allow singing from their hymn books. What will she choose, what will she do?
  The actors/actresses in The Shunning are wonderful. They played their parts exceptionally well.  You know how some Christian films really lack in the acting abilities!  Well that isn't the case with The Shunning. The casting is just superb.
  In this DVD you will find such love, goodness and tenderness that it is unbelievable. I love the way the Amish family wants to keep everyone close and keep them from going astray. I'm really glad to have this DVD and highly recommend it. Another DVD every person should have in their library.

4597960,5,B00584A7MY,"Katie Lapp (Danielle Panabaker) has always struggled with the rules that define her sheltered Amish community, but when a wealthy outsider (Sherry Stringfield, TV's ""ER"") begins asking questions about her family, Katie begins to wonder about her origins.

When Katie struggles with the decision of whether or not to marry Bishop John Beiler, a good Amish man after trying hard to keep with the Amish ways. Her love of music and playing the guitar is something she promised she gave up until her brother finds her playing it one day in the loft above the barn and reminds her, what her father will do if he finds out. Katie believes that there is something to this gift of music that God gave her.

What connection does this woman have to her life...and how will the unraveling secrets challenge Katie's faith? Beverly Lewis' The Shunning is a powerful, personal journey of discovery based on the famous novel by New York Times best-selling author. The film is based on the celebrated first novel of the best-selling ""The Heritage of Lancaster County"" book series.

Beverly Lewis, born in the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country, is the New York Times bestselling author of more than eighty books. Her stories have been published in eleven languages worldwide. A keen interest in her mother's Plain heritage has inspired Lewis to write many Amish-related novels, beginning with ""The Shunning,"" which has sold more than one million copies. In 2007, Lewis' ""The Brethren"" was honored with a Christy Award.

I received The Shunning by Beverly Lewis on DVD compliments of Propeller and the Hallmark Channel for my honest review and LOVED this one. Being a huge fan of Amish fiction and their simple way of life, I was captivated to see how this storyline would play out. I felt for Katie's desire to please her family but also the struggle of what she believes God would want her to use her gift of music for. This is a perfect story that shows the simplicity of the Amish lives and how their faith plays a huge role in what they do and believe. Hands down this is a perfect movie for the entire family and rates a 5 out of 5 stars. This one will be watched over and over again by our family!",1315785600,2,2187,4.672727272727273
4597961,5,B00584A7MY,"I went into this film having read ""The Shunning"" in the past, but it was so long ago that a lot of the details were a little bit fuzzy in my mind. Because of this, I believe I can conclusively state that both fans of the book and people who have never read the books will be able to enjoy this movie.

For book fans:

I believe that this follows the book pretty well. While some aspects are added to make it more film-worthy, the basic plot of Katie having been given to an Amish family by her mother remains the same. Nothing sensational is added to the film. It is definitely as family friendly for viewing as Beverly Lewis' books are for reading.

For all potential viewers:

This movie had a truly superb cast and crew. None of the Amish characters or home life depictions felt forced or phony. Danielle Panabaker was the most perfect Katie you could hope for. Her expressions and delicate beauty really made you feel her pain in the sad moments, her confusion when she was lost and her happiness when she flashes back to prior times.

There are no annoying pans and zooms with the camera, no artsy editing effects and no cheesy dialogue. When you watch a lot of family friendly films, you encounter all of these elements from time to time in the lower budget movies that aren't produced by conscientious film makers. You will encounter none of that here. ""The Shunning"" is every bit as good as any other Michael Landon Jr. project I have been fortunate enough to watch (or read!).

The scenery is lovely and the set dressing is realistic looking to my non-Amish eyes. I can honestly say there is nothing about this movie that I didn't like. It is top-shelf.

4598010,5,B00584A7MY,"Oh my!  This is a beautifully and well done story about a girl who has been reared in Amish country and unbeknownst to her is actually of ""the English"" as far as her background is concerned.  The Amish family who have raised her since she was a baby have reared her as their own and no one in the community is aware that she may be of ""English"" heritage.  Except that close to her wedding day, a lady appears in town asking questions and looking for the daughter that she gave up for adoption twenty years prior.  She is now facing a fatal illness and is seeking out her daughter even though she promised the Amish family that she would leave them alone forever.  The daughter, who has a penchant for the popular Christian music of ""the English"" struggles with some of the confines of her Amish community, while at the same time loving her family very much.  Lest I spoil the story, let me just say, that my Mother and I loved this movie.  And we cried nonstop all throughout it.  But, don't mistake our tears for tears of sadness, it is just that moving of a story.  And the setting is very well done.

4598047,5,B00584A7MY,"Based on the best-selling novel by Author Beverly Lewis, THE SHUNNING is a superb film! Period. It packs several messages to the viewing audience and is sure to evoke tears of both, sadness and joy. In a nutshell, it has something for everyone. Set within a modern times Amish Community, a beautiful young girl finds herself at odds, when asked to conform to an Amish lifestyle devoid of singing her own songs and playing the guitar. Her former beloved, encouraged her to do, both. Now gone, her engagement to the Amish Bishop who already has young sons of his own, is opposed to her singing, guitar playing or any 'prideful' display's of talent outside of Amish Church approval. And so, THE SHUNNING, begins...! But, her parents participate in this community wide 'shunning' because, they have a secret of their own. Which if made known, could get them 'shunned' by the entire Amish Community, as well. Religious divides. The modern lifestyle verses the traditional way of Amish life. Regimentality verses mercy. Forgiveness and understanding verses concealment and secrets. The truth and freedom to choose as opposed too, deception and conformity by coercion. This is an excellent movie which will evoke intense emotions, out of you. You can't help but be deeply moved by this movie. It cut's to the heart of the matter in story content, which will leave it's audience with plenty of food for thought. A heart-warming story with an endearing ending. An excellent, entertaining movie with a definite and poignant message or two. I highly recommend this film. For it is sure to be a treasured keepsake within your home DVD, great movie collection.

Hallmark Channel movies are generally way too gooey for me but the Amish angle held my interest. Danielle Panabaker gives a very nice performance in the lead role. Overall the cast and story are pretty good but there are more than a few VERY hokey moments that would make even John-Boy Walton wince.

4598086,4,B00584A7MY,"Despite a few vague spots--Katie's fantasy bedroom (or at least I assume that's what it is) and her sudden trip to the city to buy ""fancy,"" ""English"" clothing--THE SHUNNING entails a convincing and engaging story about crises of faith and other matters within the Old Amish Order. A made-for-TV movie with a Christian slant--though nothing that's just preachily in-yer-face--it is, of course, totally clean: No sex, serious violence, or even a single mild curse word. Still, this film is very much in the real world and gives an intriguing view of Amish life. Danielle Panabaker gives a memorable performance as Katie Lapp; ditto for those who play the various other Amish characters. Professionally done filming that provides some excellent scenery of the Pennsylvania Dutch countryside. The flashbacks to Katie with her childhood friend and would-be husband Daniel are quite arresting. THE SHUNNING is an interesting, moving, and poignant experience.

NOTE: I'm not religious in the formal, traditional sense, and I read and watch a lot of gritty, gross, nasty stuff. Yet, I still enjoyed THE SHUNNING, which hopefully says something about the quality of this film.",1399334400,,1167,5.274193548387097

4598111,5,B00584A7MY,"Although I am an outsider, I have read extensively over the past fifteen years about the Old Order Amish. ""The Shunning"" is an excellent and for the most part accurate portrayal of Amish life as it really is. All the major characters are believable. And the story itself is fast-moving, gripping, and heartwarming. (The one little quibble I have is that it is possible to take away from the story that marriages in the Amish community are arranged or practically arranged, as Katie's [Danielle Panabaker] proposed marriage seems to be. Based on the research I have done, I do not believe that this is typically the case.)

Unlike some reviewers, who have stated that the ending leaves us hanging, I found the scene at the bus stop, when Katie is on her way to search for her birth mother, to be a perfect way to bring the story to a close. This story is primarily about Katie and her relationship with the adoptive family that has raised her since infancy, and in particular the break (and resultant shunning) that takes place when she finds out the secret her family has hidden from her all these years. The story is not about whether or not she reconnects with her birth mom. The fact that we never find this out is not relevant. Whether or not the rift with her family (particularly her father) is healed is what is crucial. The touching last scene at the bus stop deals with this, and is a perfect ending to the movie.",1376438400,2,1422,4.533073929961089

The book has her having three brothers and the movie has one and he's married but we don't get to know him or his family---just see them at table.  I can't even believe that Beverly Lewis would have approved this.  Sorry --- just had to vent---the book so good and in my opinion the movie did not do it justice at all.

4598137,5,B00584A7MY,The Amish are a strong but strange society. Their rules stick and living under them is very trying for this yound woman. Enjoyed it very much.,1359849600,,142,4.5
4598138,3,B00584A7MY,"I've read all three books of the trilogy that this movie is associated with and enjoyed them.  They definitely read as cliffhangers and those going into this movie should realize that this movie only covers the first book, so it does have a cliffhanger.  I would suspect that they are also making movies for the other two books to remedy that.

Katie Lapp has always struggled with her faith.  After the death of her boyfriend three years ago, it's hard for her to relate to other people within the community.  Her love of music and the guitar especially hinder this which makes things worse because she is betrothed to the bishop, and such transgressions are not easily forgiven.  So when a strange English woman comes around asking questions, it disrupts things even further as Katie learns the secret about her past, and whether or not staying in the community is the proper thing for her to do.

Characters:
Danielle Panabaker: Katie Lapp
Bill Oberst Jr. - Katie's father
Sherry Stringfield - Laura Mayfield-Bennett
Sandra Van Netta - Katie's mother
David Topp - Daniel Fisher

Ok, so the first thing I had an issue with was the amount of makeup worn by the Amish characters in this movie.  Katie had eye liner, eye shadow, and lip gloss through the whole thing!  Which I can tell you right now isn't authentic.  Even her mom seemed to be sporting a little eye makeup.  If you're going to make a movie about the Amish, their looks should be portrayed correctly.  The actors did an ok job aside from that, but I think Katie could have been better cast.  Panabaker just didn't act like an Amish woman (and while I don't have huge experience with the Amish, I do sometimes drive them home and interact with them, so I do have a little experience to base my thoughts off of).  Even an Amish woman struggling with her faith wouldn't do some of the things that Katie did.  By contrast, I thought that Oberst did a wonderful job as Katie's father.  He was stern yet loving and most of the scenes involving him were the ones that I teared up at.  The other character were average in their performances and once again, didn't really ring authentic for me.  Although it was nice to see Stringfield, I haven't seen her in anything since her role on E.R.

There were quite a few inaccuracies in this movie, first and foremost the makeup.  I also thought the accents were a little bit overdone.  Now I'm accustomed to Ohio Amish accents, but they aren't near as heavy as those used in the movie.  But I'm willing to grant that perhaps the Pennsylvania Amish accent is heavier, although I suspect not as heavy as in this movie.  The plot itself more or less followed the book, and I didn't see anything that I would want to call out as being completely a detour from the book.  There wasn't as much religion in focus as there are in the books which was the only noticeable difference that I found.  There were a few scenes that made me tear up, it is an emotional story about a girl just trying to find out where she belongs.  And that's an easy character to relate to.

Not a bad movie adaptation of a book, but all the glaring issues made me rate it about average.  I think it does a disservice to the Amish to release this movie without checking the facts and lifestyles, but do recognize that it is a heartwarming tale.

4598139,5,B00584A7MY,It seems to be in new condition.  We have not watched the movie. The movie is the Shunning. It was a fabulous book.,1358035200,,115,4.0
4598140,5,B00584A7MY,This was a great Dirty Santa gift.  It arrived very fast. I am pleased. I was also pleased with the price.,1357948800,,106,4.0476190476190474
4598141,5,B00584A7MY,"I just finished watching this movie.  I put it on when I was ready to go to bed - sleepy and worn out from the day - and now here it is two hours later and I watched whole thing.  After it started, I couldn't turn if off.

The movie is gripping.  The dialogue is simple and sparse, but the drama is intense.  Danielle Panabaker is very convincing in the movie.  She portrays the emotions in a vivid but mysterious way.  She also does so in a very reserved fashion, like a volcano that is about to erupt -- but never does.  It doesn't have to -- the power is there.  The fact that she's gorgeous doesn't make it difficult to watch either.

The ending is unusual.  Simple, but unusual.  I found myself wanting more as the movie ends somewhat suspended, but resolved at the same time.  It's quite an interesting combination of tension and resolution that seems to co-exist rather comfortably.  I call it masterful.

Overall, I recommend the movie to anyone who wants a movie that leaves you pleased and inspired, but also wanting more.",1357430400,,1032,4.44385026737968
4598142,5,B00584A7MY,"We bought this movie, because we have read the book. We enjoyed it. If you are looking for a good, clean family movie then this is the movie for you.",1357084800,,149,4.0
4598143,3,B00584A7MY,I was really hoping this movie would be as good as the book but sadly it wasn't.  The acting was just OK.  The main character (Katie) did a pretty good job but the rest of the cast was just so-so.  I don't believe the Amish (at least the ones that I know of) wear wedding rings but the characters in this movie did.  I guess I was hoping the movie would be more realistic of the Amish way of life.  The book was so much better.  Save the money you'd spend on this movie and buy the book.,1356998400,,487,3.9183673469387754
4598144,5,B00584A7MY,A great movie that teaches a lot about the Amish people and their faith.  I highly recommend this movie for families with high values.,1356480000,,134,4.583333333333333

4598147,4,B00584A7MY,"Can't help but love this movie if you love Amish stories...it gives you a great insight to not only their world but to the reality of their heart aches too!  Not just the day to day life but helps you to see that they are people just like us, with struggles just like us...precious, precious, precious!  I would definitely recommend this movie!",1355529600,,344,4.532258064516129
4598148,3,B00584A7MY,"I have not read Beverly Lewis' book, though I am aware of it. So I watched this movie with no background or preparation for her portrayal of the Amish or with any idea of what was going to happen in this movie. As the movie began, it piqued my interest because of the strange was of the Amish and because of the obvious conflict Katie was having with that lifestyle. I felt that the producers did a good job of casting and filming, and I felt that all of the characters were portrayed in a sympathetic light, so that there was no real villain in the story. However, right towards the end of the movie, I sat up in my seat and thought, ""Alright, this is going in a very interesting direction, and I can't wait to see how things turn out for her."" Right then, the credits started rolling. WHAT?? Where's the rest of the movie?? In my opinion, I saw the preface, and the ""good"" parts happen off-screen, after the movie is over, and I missed it. Unless there's a Part II somewhere that I haven't found. Very frustrating.",1354320000,9,1016,4.324607329842932

4598154,5,B00584A7MY,"A touching story of redemption, practiced by many of the characters. Also a much-needed appeal to the proper use of traditional institutions in the navigating of human life.",1351555200,,173,5.214285714285714
4598155,2,B00584A7MY,"I must agree with MS. M. Angell. I was all into the movie until the end. Then it blindsides the viewer with an abrupt ending. The ending is so sudden it takes the viewer completely unaware. It leaves the viewer to guess what happened for the rest of the story. It was a classic end to a movie that plans on producing a sequel but, to my knowledge, there is none. I was also surprised that Michael Landon Jr. was associated with this film given the poor ending. He normally makes VERY good family movies. Don't get me wrong the movie had a very good plot, acting, etc., however, the ending is such a disappointment ,in my opinion, it is not worth the time to watch.",1348790400,,664,4.277777777777778
4598156,5,B00584A7MY,"The only fault I could find was the wild music used when she was ""in the worldy places""...the hymns played while with the Amish were beautiful.

I suppose it would work better as a mini-series or edit out a lot of dead space and make one movie out of the series.  I kept waiting to get beyond the introduction and it never happened.

4598172,5,B00584A7MY,"One thing you can see through this movie is the love of two women for the same daughter.  The Mother was able to give her daughter to an Amish woman to raise and thus gave that women a gift she would have never known otherwise.  Then when the natural Mother needed to just see her daughter after years, the Amish Mother gave her the gift of meeting her daughter.
It took two strong women to do what they did.
A Mother's heart is strongly portrayed in this movie.
Then when the father cannot stand to shun his daughter anymore, it brings tears to your eyes.  That is a true story of the love of family.",1327276800,,601,4.208695652173913

4598174,4,B00584A7MY,"I say surprisingly because this is not normally the kind of movie I watch. I stumbled on it because I needed to do some research about the Amish. If Hallmark movies are not your thing either, it might take a while for you to get into the feel of the movie--which, for a viewer used to more edgy Hollywood fare, can seem wooden and at times deadly earnest. There's a bit of cheesiness here, especially in the first half. But then, slowly and surely, the movie builds real dramatic power. The scenes of the actual shunning of the title are heartbreaking, as is Panabaker's performance in the lead role. Her parents are also strong, and show nuances that move beyond Amish stereotype. There's nothing fancy in the direction, but the camera leans heavily on the expressiveness of the human face, a refreshing contrast to the quick cuts and fancy camerawork of so many movies these days. This is a story about things that matter, and a thoughtful look at the different ways God and the divine work in the world. The restrained ending is handled well, leaving Katie's future very much a mystery.",1325894400,18,1089,4.647668393782383

4598177,5,B00584A7MY,"I absolutely loved The Shunning.  If you've read any of the Heritage of Lancaster County series by author Beverly Lewis, this movie is based off of the first novel in that series.

The movie is about a young girl in the Amish community who discovers a secret that leaves her with a lot of questions about her identity.  I don't want to give anything away, but it was a really great movie.  The acting was way above average for Hallmark movies, and starred some great actresses like Danielle Panabaker.  The storyline was uplifting, the message was encouraging, and the entire movie was family-friendly.  I also liked the songs on the soundtrack.

I've always held a special admiration in my heart for the Amish people.  There is a lot to be said for their way of simple living.  I could learn quite a bit from them.

I strongly encourage you tot watch this awesome movie!",1325462400,,871,4.597402597402597
4598178,5,B00584A7MY,"This book was a wonderful adaptation of the book and I am eagerly awaiting the other two movies.  The acting was perfect, I'm so glad I watched it!",1325376000,,147,4.25
4598179,5,B00584A7MY,"Katie Lapp was raised in an Amish family from Hickory Hollow in Lancaster County and has a love of English songs in her heart. She doesn't want to disappoint her family about her love of music but she also wants to be who God made her to be. She is engaged to marry Bishop John but is unsure if she can be the kind of wife he wants her to be. An unexpected English person comes into the Lapp's lives which causes turmoil in their family because they have to dig up a deep family secret that has been buried for many years.

This film has a lot of special themes and I believe that one can only get the full benefit by watching the whole film. With the title ""The Shunning"" a person can probably guess that one of the themes is ""being shunned"" and this film gives a person a better understanding about what an Amish person, or any person who doesn't belong to certain religion may feel when they are not included in their lives because they are not from the same religion as they are. The unpeacefulness one has in their soul because they are trying to be pulled away from who God wants them to be is something also deeply expressed through this film.

I recommend this film to anybody that likes Amish fiction, especially if they have been reading a lot of Amish fiction books for awhile and want to see what they have been imagining come to life a little bit more through the big screen. This is the first Amish film I can remember watching and it was helpful to me to watch it after I had gotten used to some of the Amish language I have learned from novels, otherwise I might have not connected as well to it. I also think it would be good for Christ-followers to watch this film to see if they have any of the ""shunning"" traits shown and to try to possibly think of more ways to promote unity in the body of Christ after watching it.",1325030400,,1837,4.215909090909091
4598180,3,B00584A7MY,"I want to preface this review by stating that I haven't read the book it is based on.  It's a sweet story, but I really hope the reason it ends so abruptly is because there will be a sequel?  The end was  anti-climactic and disappointing.

I agree with the other reviewer in that the Amish women wearing makeup was laughable, and also it was very unrealistic when Katie came out of the clothing store with her hair completely straight after it had been up in a bun under her prayer cap.

Most of all, I was disappointed that when Katie was calling out to God for help and guidance that her dead boyfriend showed up instead. I was really hoping there would be more of a truly biblical faith element to this movie.

4598185,5,B00584A7MY,"Poignant part-adaptation. The only way to get a complete book-to-film adaptation is via a series. 90 min of film requires only 50 novel pages. Thus the film is not identical but ""based on"" and I'll review the DVD--it's as gripping as the book. Beverly Lewis admits the stories are different, but both good, and Katie Lapp was based on Lewis' ancestor.

How can a young beautiful girl who lusts for songs and guitar music marry an Amish Bishop? Is music from the heart to please God? So many conflicts between the English & Amish ways to face. Katie discovers a family secret prior to her nuptials and sets out to sample the English city ""sin-style"". She makes a larger decision that shames family and she ultimately is shunned. Shunning is a ban on association with a fallen member of the Amish faith. A most severe discipline; as the church members see her turning from the faith.

Absolutely beautiful country scenic film; with rural NC playing the set of Hickory Hollow, Lancaster Co. Eye-catching Danielle Panabaker (Katie) & Sandra W. Van Natta (Mom) are excellent in playing these two emotional roles.
This beautiful setting host any human struggle of opposites. Politics, race, gender, rich/poor, generational, conflicts are not unlike that of the movie ""The Help"" (you must see it). In ""The Shunning"" it happens to be a chosen way of non-worldly lifestyle that creates conflict. ""The Shunning"" is associated with AFFIRMfilms who also connect with the Christian film hit ""Courageous."" Another must see!

DVD does have SDH subtitles. Bonus is 4 minutes of deleted.

I also enjoyed the role of Ella Mae Zook (Nancy Saunders) who has the line ""The miracle ain't the life you missed, but it's the life you've got.""",1318636800,13,1717,4.890034364261169

4598187,3,B00584A7MY,"This is the first time I have seen this author's work on film.  I would have been happier if I could have just rented the movie and not purchased it.  They didn't give you that option.  As usual it didn't live up to the book.  However, living so close to Lancaster County I can say the scenery and background looked pretty well researched, based on the fact I have been inside a real Amish home, met them and once had dinner at the home of an Amish woman.",1318636800,,455,4.136363636363637
4598188,3,B00584A7MY,"This is a hard movie for me to review. I know it's based after a book written by a wonderful author, but the movie was kind of dry and it left me wanting a bit more to it. But it was a made for TV movie too so that might have been a bit of the problem too.
I do want to say the acting was amazing and I loved that they tried their best to stay authentic to Amish culture. Where we live it's a lot of Mennonite culture, even at Walmart there is Horse parking. So having the movie stick closely to what I've experienced, with the exception that the Mennonite interact with the ""English"". They even went as far as to have an accent.
I did enjoy parts of the movie and learning more about what its like to be part of a Shunning, both on the outcast side and the other people's side. I know I wouldn't be able to survive not being talked to or not talking to the ones I loved.
If they came out with a sequel to the movie I would watch it. Mainly because I did fall in love with the characters and want to see more of what happens in Katie's life, what happens when she meets her birth mother, can she go back to her adoptive family?
So maybe if it wasn't a made for TV movie they could have built up the characters and plot line a bit more and made the movie a bit more exciting. But with what I saw, I really want to see more. maybe I will even go and read these books too.
It's a cute movie and I'm sure most will love it and want more. Beverly Lewis fans will love it too.

4598189,2,B00584A7MY,"Speaking from experience of having taught in two somewhat isolated religion affiliated communities similar to what was portrayed I take issue with several portrayals. First, the characterizations of everyday behavior were far too safely middle of the road stereotypic mythical creations. The reality, as I've seen, is that you have a greater range with both a more liberal acceptance of the outside world but also an even more restrictive control resulting in even less contact with the outside world e.g. playing touch football is OK but looking at a magazine in a grocery store is not. Second, the dialogue was too stereotypically artificial - what an outsider who has watched too many sect movies would be likely to write. Third, the casting just didn't fit especially Katie - didn't look the part, act the part and seemed coached for the dialogue. Fourth, if the plot was centered about the issue of shunning then this movie picked an unusual if not strange vehicle to portray the issue - just didn't seem likely. It usually takes a more serious transgression e.g. alcohol, sex, desire for the material. Also, individuals who have left the community sometimes are accepted back to assist or moderate outside technology that is helpful, for example, in business.",1316822400,9,1265,5.057416267942584
4598190,5,B00584A7MY,The movie is well made and the acting was great but I just hope that there are sequels so we can find out what happens to Katie.  Does she get to meet up with her biological mother?  Do they grow close before the bio mother dies of her terminal illness.  Will she ever be reunited with her first love or is he dead like everyone says?  I want to know the answers. I guess I can always read the books to find out the answers.,1316563200,,424,3.9529411764705884
