8481187,3,B005OCJLR2,"Barely gets to being interesting. Is too brief an overview of the Buddha and Buddhism. Does not really clarify in any depth how Buddhism arose, thus leaves a beginner a little confused.",1497052800,,185,4.8125
8481188,2,B005OCJLR2,"The description of this film says surprisingly little about it, so I thought I'd try to give a better sense of what it actually contains.

Basically, it is a tour of various sites around India: where the Buddha was born, where he obtained enlightenment, etc.  At each location, some non-native pilgrims/tourists are followed, and their experiences, thoughts, and observations are filmed and shown here.  Interspersed within each section are some brief scenes with an actor portraying the historical Buddha (as shown on the cover picture for the DVD).

As the other reviewer observed, the film doesn't have a whole lot to teach; some of the most important moments in Buddha's life are covered far too quickly to be of much use (his enlightenment for example).  Overall, it seemed more like a filmed travelogue than anything intended to be instructional about the Buddha or Buddhism.",1348790400,4,881,5.090277777777778
8481189,2,B005OCJLR2,"I did not feel like I learned anything about Buddhism from this film. Furthermore, when interviewing people with strong accents it is helpful to use subtitles.",1347580800,2,159,5.153846153846154
