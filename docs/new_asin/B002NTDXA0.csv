8375436,4,B002NTDXA0,"Recently saw this, on New Years ironically. Really dug it. Total indie but really well done, great performances. Kept you wanting you know what was going on with everyone and where they'd end up by the end of the NYE party. Won't give away the ending... (double whammy really), whether you agree with it or not it will make you think. Sparked a great conversation with my friends & I.",1262649600,2,384,4.5
