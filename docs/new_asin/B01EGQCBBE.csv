A newspaper tells of a prison breakout. [Note the age of the newspaper boys.] A freight train is searched for an escaped murderer. A man leaves the train then rides off on somebody's horse. He is pursued by two lawmen who shoot at him. Can he escape in a lake? [Don't they run out of bullets?] Another man watches this. ""I ain't the law."" ""Smith"" is offered a refuge as a cook. The gang members play cards until a fight erupts. There is a $1,000 reward for John Brant. Jones has a plan to test ""Smith"". They ask when the mail will arrive. ""My friend will pay."" [Eggs were put in a paper sack.] A message tells the store owner what to do at night. Smith and Jones arrive at night but leave. Jones gets a tip on a payroll. Smith writes a letter.

Seven men ride out to stick up the stagecoach. Smith gets there first and lightens their load. The robbers are disappointed. Smith talks to Sally about his past. She replaces his hatband! Jones tells about his past, he is a fugitive after killing his wife's lover in Maryland. The gang learns about a gold bullion shipment. Is it accurate or a ruse? Smith goes shopping for eggs. But they have a basket full! Will they suspect him? ""We know what to do."" The Sheriff suspects Brant is still alive. Smith sees who is in the grocery store and sends a note to Sally. The Sheriff decides to follow Sally as she leaves the store. [Who is minding the place?] Jones meets Smith in the tavern. Sally arrives to warn Smith, but the Sheriff arrives to arrest Brant and Conlon! They fight and escape. [Believable?]

A posse is formed to pursue these two. Sally tells the truth to Conlon, he will try to make amends. Smith rides alone back to the gang, a trap. Sally tells the Sheriff about the location of the gang and what they plan to do. Will Smith ride into a trap? He is warned, and a gunfight begins. Can they escape? [That white smoke suggests black powder.] The Sheriff's posse arrives at the gang' hideout. [A long shot suggests the use of a stunt double.] Smith eliminates the gang one by one. The stagecoach is upset on a curve! Brant finds Conlon, who confesses to the murder for which Brant was blamed. `I'm glad."" Sally and Brant walk together.

This is an interesting story about blaming the wrong man for a murder and his later exoneration. Like other morality plays, the good guys win at the end after going thru an ordeal. The bad guys are caught and the survivors punished. There is little padding in these budget films.",1511481600,,2500,4.4164859002169194
