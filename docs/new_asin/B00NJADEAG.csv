6665901,3,B00NJADEAG,All I need is the bonus disc please!!,1410739200,13,37,3.75
6665902,1,B00NJADEAG,"just saw news about the upcoming R40 set. As a long time Rush fan and supporter, I am extremely upset to see how you have put this set together.
I own every Rush cd, studio and live and have purchased all the videos.
I bought the Chronicles dvd Rush Replay (I had already owned a show of hands on vhs), I bought Rush in Rio dvd, R30 dvd/ cd package and Snakes and Arrows live dvd. I then rebought R30 and Snakes and Arrows on blu ray. I bought The Time Machine Tour blu ray and The Clockwork Angels blu ray, not to mention Beyond the Lighted Stage blu ray the cd/ dvd set with the other music videos and all of Neil's drumming dvds.
I have really wanted Rush in Rio on blu ray and the bonus disk and book in tis set sound great, but why do I have to pay for four disks I already own to get the Two I really want.
To me it is a slap in the face to all the fans who have been buying Rush Merchandise for years.
I always thought Rush was a band who appreciated their fans, but this feels like just a total money making scheme.
As I said before, I am angry, but more so disappointed.",1410739200,32,1079,3.9315068493150687

6665904,4,B00NJADEAG,"Been wanting to get this since it came out,but the price was a bit to much until I found a great deal. Glad I bought it. Like most people,I wanted it for the 1976 show. My other copy has counter numbers in the middle of the screen...........annoying. Anyway,it's nice to have a video history of Rush in one book-like package. The great thing about R40 is you can see how Rush as a band,musicians and people actually change......physically,musically,& equipment wise. Except for the last few tours,something always changed about them. For example,most guitarists'
play one kind of guitar there whole life (example:Trower/Malmsteen.....strat guys;Schenker.....Flying V guy;Young & Iommi.......sg guy's. Not Alex,he had many different guitars for different tours and even different songs on the same tour. I have respect for both kind of guitar players. But that's what makes Rush Rush.",1481932800,,883,5.314285714285714
6665905,5,B00NJADEAG,"Wonderful, I am still enjoying my newest Rush collection and must say that to myself it was worth every penny. Even if you already own the separate concerts on dvd it is still worth it for the interviews and the documentary, and the bonus concerts! Plus I love the way it is packaged, reminds myself of a coffee book. With artwork (as always) is tremendous:)",1479945600,2,358,4.523076923076923

6665910,4,B00NJADEAG,"I forget what this was missing but I had to still go out to get something that it was missing which bothered me.
It's even worse to sit and do a review without going to see what that was!
Rush and whoever taped/recorded their shows really wasn't good at it.  Some of them just sound just horrible, surprisingly horrible.
It's still Rush though and that's that. It's Rush.  You should have it.  Those 3 are unbelievable musicians.",1454457600,,429,4.545454545454546
6665911,5,B00NJADEAG,Love everything about this collection. So many amazing songs! I got to watch some of my favorites that I've never heard live before. This is a must have for any Rush fan. I'd give it a million stars if I could!,1453680000,,210,4.146341463414634

6665915,3,B00NJADEAG,"Hoodwinked!  I suppose it's my fault for not looking closer, but I thought a box set named R40 would have included the R40 tour.  While it is great to have the new and unreleased stuff, we just got sold a bunch of stuff most of us already have.  Very disappointed in the boys on this one.",1451174400,3,288,4.107142857142857
6665916,4,B00NJADEAG,"I got this as a Christmas present from my brother this year. I was expecting the actual R40 dvd of the whole concert. But, my brother ended up getting this for me, which has a lot of the major live dvd's that Rush has, including Rush In Rio, (which I already had), R30, Snakes & Arrows, Time Machine, Clockwork Angels Tour, and an R40 bonus dvd. Now don't get me wrong, I am keeping this present, because my brother spent almost $100 on it and I don't mind all the Rush dvd's. I'll eventually watch all of them. But, when the book says R40 on it, you think it would have the R40 dvd in it of the whole concert, not just a bonus dvd. None the less. I did tell my brother that and luckily he is getting me the actual R40 dvd as well. Overall, this is a really good collection of Rush dvd's. The book has pictures of all the tours featured on the dvd's as well. If you are a huge Rush fan, this is a must buy even though the R40 dvd isn't in it.",1450742400,3,942,3.963157894736842

6665918,4,B00NJADEAG,"I'm not certain why some of the folks are complaining.  I've been a die hard Rush fanatic for years and have never bought a greatest hits album...now maybe that lowers me in the eyes of other Rush fans, but I don't see why.  I buy what is new to me from Rush.  I don't see the point in buying the a product I already have that's wrapped in a different box.  It looks like the perfect box set for me because I have all the live videos on VHS and am looking to upgrade and this seems to be perfect for me.  Furthermore, I don't want to disrespect any fans, I'm there with you and think there is a whole lot more the organization could put out for the fans who are looking for something new to watch or listen to.  My last thought on this is that the description really does explain what is in the box set and doesn't specify anything new.  It's just a collection.",1448755200,,861,4.089285714285714

6665926,5,B00NJADEAG,"For those of you complaining about the price of this set, I've got a simple solution: purchase the set from the Merch stand at a Rush concert.  I picked it up last night for $50 and couldn't be happier!  Unlike many reviewers, I actually don't already have the discs, and look forward to reliving the shows and reacquainting myself with my longest-running favorite band.",1438300800,,370,4.765625
6665927,5,B00NJADEAG,"Alex, Geddy & Neil are true musicians who happened to choose rock as their main genre. But they are so skilled on their instruments that watching them is like watching two shows in one. First, you are rockin' and getting into the emotion of the music. Yet, at the same time, you marvel at how three guys can produce more different sounds and textures than any five-piece band you've ever heard. My favorite band of all time does not disappoint with this series of DVDs.

In this set, you get nearly every major concert tour they filmed, including some really old stuff that I didn't know I'd ever see anywhere. It comes in a sturdy binder that doubles as a book, complete with the DVDs, some story lines and also some nice pics of the band, some of which I have never seen anywhere else. The binding is solid and the pages are made from very thick paper that will last and feels good in your hand. It includes pages that tell you what is on each DVD. It even has the show when Alex, Geddy & Neil were inducted into the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame!

TIP: This set does NOT include their R40 World Tour of 2015. My only beef with this is that it is named the same as the 2015 tour (making the title a little confusing). As of the time I'm writing this, their 2015 tour is still going, and so obviously is not released on DVD yet. I just wanted to ensure you know what this is and what it isn't. (I can't wait for them to come out with the 2015 R40 tour on DVD, that was a super spectacular show. I'll have to get it too.)",1437955200,5,1516,4.170648464163823
6665928,5,B00NJADEAG,"I got this for my fianc. He's an absolute Rush fan and loves this. We haven't gotten through the whole thing, yet. But it's been pretty cool so far.",1437782400,,148,4.137931034482759
6665929,1,B00NJADEAG,"No added value. At all!
As most of you will own the R30, Rush in Rio, Time Machine, etc. on DVD or BluRay: this box has absolutely no added value. Published in an A4 book format which looks nice this package contains all concerts from the past DVD/BluRay collection. The only thing that has been added is a disc containing a live performance with John Rutsey, Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson on Band Stand, a sort of talent show on a highschool or something. The show looks like it has been taken from a long forgotten VHS video cassette that was lying somewhere in the garage or roof top and digitalized. The sound quality is acceptable although it is hard to hear what John is saying during the announcements. :-(
I was looking forward to this box but had to come to the conclusion that it added no value to my Rush collection. At all!
I am very, very disappointed that this has been brought to the market.
If you make me a good offer... It can become yours!",1435968000,2,955,4.340782122905028
6665930,5,B00NJADEAG,"Rush's box set will not satisfy some as many of these concerts (actually all but one) have been produced and sold singularly and most hard core RUSH fans have them already.  That said, I had all of them as well and I still bought this set for two reasons.  One, most of my copies were on regular DVD, the blu ray upgrade is nice. Two, it does have a concert not put out before.

It comes with a nice book to look at of performance pictures and such and the packaging is built well.

I guess if I had a negative is that for a 40 year in the making box set I would have liked to have had ALL the Rush concert videos with major releases.'While it does include ""Rush in Rio,' 'R30,' 'Snakes & Arrows Live,' 'Time Machine 2011: Live in Cleveland,' and 'Clockwork Angels Tour,' plus a a bonus of unreleased stuff, it doesn't cover certain periods of time successfully.  It has all of the songs you would want, but most of the tunes are them doing the old songs like 2112 and Xanadu in performances of the past 10 years.  I would have much rather seen concert performances of those songs in the time they were originally performing them.

There are several concert videos needed to round this out:  Most of which you can get on the rush box set ""Rush Replay"" but that isn't out in blu ray as far as I know.  It includes ""Exit Stage Left"" and ""A show if hands"" and also gives us a DVD from the ""grace under pressure"" tour.  It even has a CD of the Grace music, since the other two already did.

That would be another edition.  Lots of box sets are now including special things, and a great add in here would have been all of Rush's concert CD's made into mp3 files on a special USB drive - could you imagine a Star Man designed USB drive...how cool would that be.

Anyway, tried to give this thing 3-4 stars for the deficiencies it has but the discs are so well made and musi so well performed I just had to go with 5.",1435449600,8,1910,4.157608695652174

6665932,4,B00NJADEAG,"For all those posting negative reviews because you already own all the ""non bonus"" material, can I ask why the heck you are even considering buying this?

6665936,3,B00NJADEAG,"Yes I agree with that one review because I have select items by Rush that I researched before I bought them and do not like repeats, but I also remember that Neil Peart said that he once thought that his fans were really dumb and stupid at times and that was a bit unnerving but doesn't take away from the fact that I still love the music they make and the fans base proves that point. I will not pay $90.00 for repeats or rehash on 6 discs. I already have R30 and Clockwork Angels Tour dvds so why would I want a repeat of the same thing. I wanted to go to the concert but did not have money, I was at the Dallas Texas show for Hold Your Fire years ago when Neil did a 25 minute drum solo nonstop and it was incredible.",1434585600,,720,3.9383561643835616

A great way to get everything in one-shot.  What bugs me, like most others, is that for us loyal fans who are responsible for making RUSH 3rd only behind the Beatles and Stones in gold records, can only get the new disc of material by re-buying everything we already own.  It should have been made available as a stand alone disc.  I will wait until it is made so available.",1423267200,2,516,4.161616161616162

I've been a fan of Rush since their first album, seen them live 8 times from the ""Hemispheres"" tour on, and was really excited about the bonus footage and the fact that ""Rush In Rio"" was finally on BluRay.  But, alas, my excitement waned as I put in ""Rush In Rio"" to finally see it as crisp as I know BluRay can be, only to be sorely disappointed.  The picture quality actually seems worse on BluRay than on my DVD release.  The bonus material was good, but since I already had all of the other concerts on BluRay, I kind of feel like I've been ripped off by my favourite band.  I still like Rush, but guys, this was a major failure in my opinion.",1422662400,7,705,4.079710144927536

6665956,5,B00NJADEAG,"My wife got this for me for Christmas and I was ecstatic. Contrary to what some other reviews imply, not all diehard fans bought every one of these in individual release. Some of us just don't buy things for ourselves, some of us don't have the money to buy everything, and some of us just miss a release. Even if I had them, though, I'd still give this set 5 stars. Just because I may have had all of the individual discs (minus the R40 bonus disc) doesn't mean everyone does and the set should be judged on its quality and quantity and not on ""Oh, I've already got that, so this is a rip off and I'll only give it 1-star because of that"" whining.

Besides, I think the bonus disc alone is worth the price. There's some amazing and rare stuff on that disc that I feel is worth its weight in gold.

One minor complaint from me is the packaging, specifically the disc storage. For someone like me with fat, arthritic fingers, the discs are not very easy to remove. But that's a small enough complaint that it doesn't affect my rating.",1421798400,7,1033,4.292307692307692

I too own them, but it didn't deter me from purchasing R40. In fact, I'm pleased with my purchase. If you're a fan and are not wishing to purchase the material again then don't! But, if you're not a Rush fan don't allow the naysayers to change your mind. Purchase this set and you will not be disappointed. To the die hard Rush fans, prepare yourself for 2015 as Rush releases their albums from their Mercury catalog in high resolution digital audio and a few will be released on Blu-Ray pure audio. I guess you won't be buying those either? I have appreciated Rush and their music for thirty-eight years.

Also, this box set should have been more comprehensive and included the videos for Exit...Stage Left, Grace Under Pressure Tour, Through The Camera Eye, A Show of Hands, and the Chronicles videos.  Those are the videos I want the most on BluRay anyway and are harder to find.  A lot of Rush fans felt cheated by this one.

6665975,1,B00NJADEAG,"Is this really how you celebrate forty years together...by gouging loyal fans? This is a thoughtless release. There is nothing new here but a few old songs recorded at a different venue. Last grab at cash before an [amazing] career ends? Rush has always meant and stood for much better than this: ""Art as expression, not as market campaigns...""  What happened to the integrity that still pervades their music?",1416614400,46,409,4.927536231884058

6665977,5,B00NJADEAG,"Yes, yes, yes. Most of us own many, if not all, of these. To me the purchase was worth it! The new disc brings a lot of old material to light, and includes the Hall of Fame induction in high quality (would have liked the Crossroads performance as well). It includes the complete R30 concert in great quality, which replaces my incomplete DVD! (The limited edition Best Buy Blue Ray supposedly also includes the second R30 disc.) I wanted the Time Machine Blue Ray as well. I will say the Rush in Rio seems rather blurry- like it was a bad upscale. The 52 pages of photos is really nice. No need to get pissed off. It is a box set. It is going to include previously released material. That is the nature of the game.",1416268800,4,715,4.264705882352941
6665978,1,B00NJADEAG,"Dear Mr Daniels:  ""No !""
I've been a Rush fan since the 1970s.
I've bought every available album on Vinyl and CD, I've bought every VHS and DVD.  But enough is enough  I will most definitely not be buying this.  I'll save my money for an extra show on the next tour.",1416268800,10,266,4.0576923076923075
6665979,3,B00NJADEAG,I have almost every single one on video and audio... except the high school recording... not paying $100+ for just that... yest it is a collectors release... and I am a HUGE RUSH fan... thus the three stars... if I were a NEWBIE... then this would be 5 stars or MORE... if possible.  I would buy the High School concert by itself ... to have it... but will pass on this as a buddy let me see this and listen and on a serious rig... just good.... PLEASE tour once more... maybe play the big arenas to cut down on the shows... and make it a family adventure rather than a grind!!,1416182400,3,577,4.151785714285714
6665980,4,B00NJADEAG,"""A universe divided as the heart and mind collided"".  Indeed!  I can appreciate the bitterness of some loyal Rush fans (of which I have been and am still one for 30+ years) over the cost of this elaborate box set which has one resonant theme of ""Why the heck am I going to spend $100 for material I already have just to get one bonus disk and an upgrade of RIR to Blu-ray?""  Well, I am not going to address that, to each their own and while I struggled for a grand total of 5 minutes with dropping a c-note around the holidays, I eventually broke down and sat in traffic to go 25 minutes out of my way to a local BB to purchase this last week.

So, was it worth it?  To me yes, and here's the main (and obvious) reason why:  the bonus disc.  The 1974 show with John Rutsey was a revelation of how far this band would NOT have gone had he remained their drummer.  God bless him, he took the reigns of introducing the songs, band members, addressing the audience, etc...but musically it was painfully apparent that Geddy and Alex were already showing traces of leaving him in the dust as far as playing their respective instruments as he had a struggle at times keeping up during this show.  The plus side is that Geddy and Alex are already showing signs of blowing doors off and they interact with each other quite well.  The video is not exactly perfect given this is from 40 years ago, but the sound is actually quite good for the age, which for the price of this set it better be!  The bootleg from Passaic NJ during the 2112 tour was also a revelation.  Shot in black and white from basically three cameras arranged left, right, and center stage this is almost a surreal experience for the viewer as you are transported back in time for a very close and intimate show as if you were standing just off stage.  The film is grainy and when the lights go out you see total darkness, but it all added to the ""mystique"" of this experience if you will.  Sound wise to me Geddy's vocals were balls out over the instruments, and am sure that a better mix could have been provided but it's not a deal breaker.  As a matter of fact, this set may be the single finest footage I have ever seen of the band as it pertains to their playability.  My opinion is that the band reached a milestone with A Farewell to Kings, and seeing as how this tour was right before they would embark to England to record that album one can see how tight the band is at this stage of their career, and while the Moog had not made it's appearance as of yet, both Geddy and Alex utilize foot pedal synths at times during this show.  The highlight of it all is Neil's playing which is off the charts.  Even though you barely see him throughout the concert (the direct shots of him are very dark), oh is he ever heard!  The 1997 show is beautiful for me because they play my favorite song from TFE ""Virtuality"".  Enough said.

I could elaborate further on the goodies but wanted to limit my review really to the extra material that is provided, and I didn't come close to reviewing all but just the parts that stuck out to me.  All in all, my justification for this purchase was that since the band did not release an album, go on tour, or release a stand alone DVD in 2014 that $100 was what I would have spent in a ""normal"" Rush year.  Seeing as how the band is rumored to be going on tour in 2015 to celebrate 40 years, well I will see all the loyal fans there!  In closing, 4 stars for the bonus material on hand and the overall package which is fantastic, 1 star removed for the sound issues with the Passaic show and the cost.",1416182400,7,3598,4.218978102189781
6665981,3,B00NJADEAG,"Three stars only because it's Rush.  Otherwise, I share the frustration of others on here, and it would get one star.  As a long-time fan with all of their audio and video releases, I would not buy this compilation.  I agree it would be nice if they put the bonus disc out separately, but Rush is not the first to try to cash in on their work product being exposed to a second generation of fans.  They have worked hard all of their lives, they are entitled to market themselves as they please, and if there is an incidental benefit of exposing Rush to more and newer fans, then I am all for it.  But, I do agree entirely that new material should be made available to the long-time fans separately from the re-release of older material.  To not do so feels like a dose of cynical lack of appreciation of their fan base.",1416182400,3,819,4.285714285714286
6665982,2,B00NJADEAG,"I have been a huge rush fan for nearly 40 years. I am sad to say this is the second blu-ray release in a row which sadly falls short. Like many others, I purchased the individual releases represented in this box set as they were released. As a loyal fan and completist, I was compelled to buy this set for the two new discs, Rush In Rio and the bonus content disc. I have waited a long time for Rush In Rio on blu-ray and sadly have found it to be no better in quality than a straight DVD transfer, at best. To my eyes, it may be a little worse, but hey I'm 50 and my eyesight may not be that keen at this point. That said, DO NOT buy this set for the inclusion of Rush In Rio if you already own the DVD. The bonus disc is great and and if you don't own the other releases, this is a decent purchase. I am marking this down for the Rio disc quality and to a degree, the double dip cash grab element to the rest of the collection.",1416009600,10,929,3.869109947643979
6665983,1,B00NJADEAG,I am in complete horror! I just opened the box I purchased primarily for The Rio disc which was the only one I didn't have on Blu-Ray already. If any of you remember when it was originally released the Video format did not fit the screen which I had actually brought up to there management and all the releases since have fit the screen correctly.  So I just popped in Rio and I don't know what they did to make it correctly fit the screen but the disc is completely blurry and out of focus not watchable especially since the idea of Blu Ray is for the picture and audio quality which is also a poor audio mix as far as Blu ray surround is concerned. I am seriously thinking of returning it on the grounds this is a defective disc at this point. I own every Blu Ray release which quality wise got better and better with each release except audio wise I thought for sure Clockwork Orange would have had 7.1 for Blu Ray all though the video format on that disc is one of the best I have seen so far for Concerts! So I will have a look at the Bonus disc when I have a chance and it had better not be blurry although I understand some of the real old footage can't be modern quality. Complete waste of money if you own all the shows already not worth the price just to have the book and bonus disc being Rio is completely out of focus total let down!!,1416009600,11,1347,4.1022727272727275
6665984,5,B00NJADEAG,"Don't be taken in by all the negative reviews.  This is, simply put, a fantastic box set from every aspect.  First and foremost, the concert films taken from the 21st century are great and it's nice to finally see Rush in Rio on the Blu-Ray format.

The bonus disk is priceless in my opinion.  Plain and simple.

And let's not forget the amazing packaging, never-before-seen photos and usual high-quality artwork that typically adorns a Rush release.

Having all this - and more for $100?  No brainer.  Absolutely worth it and any Rush fan will appreciate and cherish it once they purchase it.",1416009600,6,593,4.745098039215686
6665985,3,B00NJADEAG,"I'm a hardcore Rush fan and have been for most of my life.  But I have to say...this box set is just not worth money for what you get, and here's the reason why.  Repetitive content that you can get or see elsewhere for free.",1415923200,4,225,3.977777777777778
6665986,2,B00NJADEAG,"Now, this set sure is interesting, in that it seems to separate the fans who already have everything to date from those who have yet to buy the first 5 titles in this lavish box set. My review is from the perspective of the former, that of fans who have already spent over the course of the last 10 years the $200+ to acquire discs 1 to 5 from this set in their separate releases. Those big fans, and I am one, are upset, and rightly so. This is a high-ticket item aimed primarily at big fans. The exclusive disc has some things on it that die-hard fans have awaited for many years. To not make that disc available on its own is a big mistake, and fans are pointing that out here. Just read the other low-star reviews. This is an online retail shopping site. One of the ways one reviews a product on a retail site IS by enumerating the reasons it IS or is NOT worth the price tag. The fans who are angry and gave this low stars are rightly allowed to use price as a primary criterion, just as those fans that are giving this 5 stars are rightly allowed because they either don't have these titles or don't care how much money they spend. Either way, I think it's hard to argue that this set presents a glaring oversight by not giving long-time fans the ability to buy the one exclusive disc on its own. Also of note: if you purchase this set via the official Rush site, you get an additional DVD when buying the Blu-ray set (nope, it's not a Blu-ray, it's a DVD), and an entirely different and exclusive DVD when you buy the DVD set. Rate your stars accordingly.",1415923200,3,1562,4.2274247491638794
6665987,3,B00NJADEAG,"It's too bad you have to put stars to say anything. I also have all the material here besides the bonus stuff. I was wondering, however, if this has the deluxe version of R30 included? Does it have the two guitar picks, and the two extra CD discs that were available only in that package at the time? Someone said earlier to just trade your old versions in and get this, but if I'm going to be losing exclusive goodies & audio material by doing so, I think I'll be waiting for a stand-alone release of the bonus material. I've gone down the ""feeling ripped off"" road already by buying the Working Men CD AND DVD for 1 song. It looks like the record company has this set up so that you have to buy this in addition to everything you already have, so that you don't lose anything exclusive to any deluxe set. Grrrrrr.......Love Rush, hate record execs.",1415750400,,850,4.352201257861635
6665988,5,B00NJADEAG,"Wow! Such hostility on here. Granted it was a no brainer for me only having a couple of DVD's: Chronicles and BTLS. That being said, I bought this as a collectors piece and not for saving a buck. Even if I had all the shows on disc I would still want this release for my collection just like the Rush re-discovered box set. Who doesn't own the very first Rush album and comes on here to complain about nothing new in R40?
I have knobs on my home theater gear and if something doesn't sound quite right to my ear I can always turn them.
If you do make this purchase you will be very happy with it IMHO.
Now for a wee measure of the Macallan...
Cheers.",1415664000,5,650,4.0859375
6665989,4,B00NJADEAG,"First, I love Rush!.

As many have stated, this material was sold to us before. We ""faithful""ly collected the concerts as they were released and as ""Best I Can"" surmise, this is a resale of the same footage.  I purchased this set because I did not have RIO on Blu-Ray and I wanted the 6th disc and the R40 completist dvd from BB.

Molson Amphitheatre, June 30, 1997, Toronto:
Animate
Resist
Natural Science

The Molson Amphitheatre songs seem to be new releases, however, this dvd appears to not include the easter eggs from r30. - Rush hits St. John's (1988) and Alex's Interview for Artist of the Decade (1980s).

So, I just played the bonus Blu-Ray and it was awesome.  I am bumping my rating to 4 stars (it would be 5 if I could buy the disc separately).  Rush has been a part of my life since high school and has seen me through great (and not so great) times of my life.  I know I will buy everything they put out - I drove 60 miles to pick this up at BB on the release date simply because I wanted the bonus dvd that came with the BB set. I am grateful for the music and the joy these guys have brought over the years.  Put me down for the 5.1 reissues and any Hemisphere videos lying around.  It is late so I am putting my message in the modem and sending it into the cyber sea.  Thanks for 40 great years guys.",1415664000,6,1991,4.372282608695652
6665990,3,B00NJADEAG,"Here we are, at the 40th anniversary of Rush's career. It's been a good 40 years, with tons of good music produced by the Fab Three, save Feedback. I'm just not a fan of a cover tune album when these guys do so much better than that offering. Nonetheless, because it is Rush, I bought it. It felt too off not to include it in their vast catalogue of releases.

On to the product at hand.

The ""box"" set comes in book form. It could easily fit on the shelf of one's personal library, given enough space between shelves. It is a tall book box, and contains a bunch of photographs on its large pages. Most of the photos are pictures from the band's live shows, some onstage and some off. There are but a few in the abstract, such as two pages of a gray wall with our old friend the dog, from Signals fame, on one of them. That dog has had quite a span of ""life,"" popping up on periodic compilations over the decades.

Now, the discs.

Let's face it - if someone already has these shows, there is little value to be added to a product that is supposed to be ""new"" for fans when most of the product has already been purchased in the past. I've lost count over how many times I have paid for Tom Sawyer and The Spirit of Radio, and do not care for paying for them again four or five times over with the purchase of this product. All last week I was thinking to myself ""I'm going to pay a hundred bucks for a box set for one disc of new live material, and it's not all even new."" Much of what is on the bonus disc is already previously released in live form. We were offered seven songs not previously-released live. Granted live footage is cool to see of one's favorite band, but if I were listening to these songs on an accompanying CD, I would feel cheated. Buying this is but a couple notches above say buying Working Men for the one previously-unreleased live version of One Little Victory from the R30 show.

Nevertheless, being the completist I am, I purchased the box set for the one disc, and was pleasantly surprised to find they included an eleventh DVD - R30 footage that was previously only available on Blu-ray - entitled ""Rush R40 Completist."" How fitting. Does this make up for having to buy live material a second time? Not really, but it was still an unexpected pleasantry.

So, five stars? Nope. This product is best for those who have none of the contained shows on DVD/Blu-ray. For those who have faithfully purchased their shows over the years, it's quite a let-down. If they were to release a recording of a full Hemispheres show, I'd take that as a good apology.",1415664000,4,2579,4.318181818181818
6665991,4,B00NJADEAG,"Considering this is supposed to be a 'completists' box of 40 years of live Rush, where are the Blu-ray versions of Exit...Stage Left, Grace Under Pressure & A Show of Hands? While I agree with the majority that this set is totally unnecessary since most of us Rush fanatics have all this already, it stands to reason that if they're going to release a 40 year retro box of live footage to fleece their already loyal fan base they should have at least made it COMPLETE! I give this 4 stars only because it includes performances from Test for Echo which was my first Rush show (yes I was deprived in my youth!). Now onto ebay!",1415577600,4,624,4.387931034482759

Best Buy offers an additional disc which features 3 more songs from that tour.

6665994,1,B00NJADEAG,"This is a good collection for new Rush enthusiasts who want to dive in to studying Rush. It's a comprehensive collection, but it's not a good deal for the ardent Rush listnener because we already have everything in the collection with the exception of the bonus disc. I wish they would sell the bonus material independently of the box set.  I am a bit disappointed in the powers that be that thought even for a moment that this would be a good seller for folks who have been listening to Rush since the 70s and have all of the music with the exception of the special ""bells and whistles"".  For those of you who do purchase this box set, enjoy.",1415577600,7,643,4.35

6665996,1,B00NJADEAG,i was a rush fan a decade ago but they just keep releasing a new cd and then a dvd of live concert.  I don't like much of the new material.

6665997,3,B00NJADEAG,"Everyone... Testing For Echo Here...I have been reading the reviews of this upcoming release from our favorite band Rush. I can bet that the guys had nothing to do with the conception to the release of this box set. I like many others am a thirty plus year veteran of the band with Neil being my favorite drummer of all of my heroes: yes I play drumset... I also love adding to my collection and even replacing dvd with blu-ray, but this is a bit much.
In a not too good economy where parents have been forced to watch every dollar, even I can not just spend money for the sake of another collectable. I would love that bonus disc but unless it is available for thirteen to twenty dollars I will have to sadly bypass this release... Heck the only thing I really want is the Test For Echo Live material and it is not even the whole show (which thoroughly kicked my ass waayyyy back in 1997!). If only I worked with their marketing and promotions department I think I would give the long time fans exactly what they would be willing to pay for... It will be a great box set for those who do not have any of these releases, but for those of us with tight budgets and kids; what would you like us to do? Not eat for two weeks?",1415404800,6,1222,4.182203389830509

6666010,2,B00NJADEAG,"I haven't seen ALL of the already released DVDs in this set, so I'll give it two stars because this is just a bundle of old material - five of the six discs are available individually. Rush fans aren't stupid. This isn't a ""40 years in the making"" anniversary set; with the exception of the bonus disc, it only has video content from the last 10 years (all of which was already released). How many repeats of the same songs are on the discs even within this set? They based an entire tour around the 30th anniversary and created the ""R30 Overture"" specifically for that reason.

The ""completists"" will buy it because they have to in order to have ALL the Rush releases, and that's exactly why this is here. It's another money-grab. Including ""Feedback"", they've released 3 albums of new material in the last 13 years. In that time they've release SEVEN compilations (eight if you include the Vapor Trails remix).",1413849600,8,912,4.62962962962963
6666011,1,B00NJADEAG,"I just read an article from 10/7/14 on Forbes.com titled ""How To Succeed In Business By Really Trying."" They went on to say how in the 20th century the ""consumer"" who would buy anything has turned into the ""customer"" with demands and high expectations. I really think Rush's management and record company need to have a meeting and read that article together because they are not ""trying"" very well lately. The bonus disc is nothing more than bait to punish loyal fans by having them repurchase all of the past decade's DVDs all over again. Unacceptable! They should know their Rush base is the most loyal in the world and would already have these titles. Even Rolling Stone magazine knows about Rush fans! Don't play stupid! Why insult us?

Just release the bonus disc for $12.99 and you will sell 250,000+ copies. Keep the package as it is and you're lucky to sell 1,000. If you're really smart, package the bonus disc with another anniversary CD of classic covers (Feedback 2) and sell it for $19.99. Rush fans love material they don't already have but get really angry when they are fed the duplicate copies. It's like mocking us for our loyalty. Yeah, we're loyal. But we're not idiots! Hello? Rush fans are actually the smarts ones, remember?

Stop trying to play us for fools.

P.S. I've been an obsessive-compulsive Rush fan for over 20 years now. This release will not change that, but I will ignore it like I have all of the pointless compilation discs we've seen since the late 90s and wait for the bonus materials to appear on YouTube. And yes, they will appear on YouTube and after 2 weeks of people reloading them up, Rush's record company will stop trying to take them down and by then they will realize what a horrible mistake they have made.",1412899200,285,1758,4.628205128205129

6666016,2,B00NJADEAG,"I'd like to take a shot of explaining why this is a two star value at best.
For the casual fan that does not have any of these releases on Blu-ray this is a good deal at  $124 . It is a lot of money if you ask me, but if you think you can get people to buy this, then go for it it.
For the hard-core rush fans, this thing contains a bunch of stuff that we have had for a while or bought last year. What is so new or different to make us buy it again ? Snakes and arrows and R30 , which were near perfect releases on Blu-ray,  have nothing new here. There is no way that you could possibly improve these two releases anyway.
It also contains the Time Machine and Clckwork Angels Blu-rays, and both  have some sound issues. Time Machine is boomy and is mixed poorly in some spots. Clockwork Angels is an audio disaster. The entire show is boomy and mixed very poorly. If anyone thinks that Clockwork sounds good on this release, then they should have their ears checked. Rush should be extremely embarrassed by the sound of this Blu-ray. It's like Vapor Trails all over again. If these issues are addressed within this box set , then this would be a three or four star release easily.
This release also contains Rush in Rio, which we would all love to have,  and it includes the 1997 Molson show,  which we would all like to have , but we would like to have the whole 1997 Molson show or most of it.
For hard-core fans,  this box set just does not offer enough to make it worth $124. For casual fans,  go for it. I wouldn't say that this release is a slap in the face to hard-core fans,  but I would say that is a bit of a rip off. If some of the sound issues on previous releases are addressed, then this a very good release. This is matter of principle for us. I don't mind buying stuff multiple times, but don't repackage stuff that has issues. Again, if these issues are addressed, I'm all in. I would be proud to pay for something that sounds good.
My suggestion for Rush would  be to release each blu-ray separately and as a box set, get the guy that fixed Vapor Trails to fix the  sound issues, and add more songs to the Molson set.",1412294400,135,2137,4.115384615384615
6666017,5,B00NJADEAG,"I understand the one star reviews and their aggravation, but RUSH is such a big part of me that I'll glady cough up the dough just for the bonus disk and book.

6666018,2,B00NJADEAG,"As much as I love Rush this one upsets me. This box set is a great purchase for the fans out there that have not already purchased the concerts in Blu-Ray or DVD format.  Sadly for avid fans like myself who have already purchased all of the available concerts in blu-ray and standard dvd format it makes no sense to spend $130 dollars to purchase them again just for the sake of obtaining the bonus disk 6.  What they should do is offer up a NEW UNRELEASED concert along with the bonus disk and a lower price.  I would love to have the bonus disk, but I'm not going to spend that much money just to obtain it.

Nobody said you have buy it.,1411084800,23,357,3.8904109589041096
6666023,5,B00NJADEAG,"Please, please don't listen to all these negative reviews! These reviewers are basically incapable of reviewing this item for what it will be, not their feelings on how they have to re-buy everything for the bonus material.

As a long-time Rush fan (they're easily my favorite band of all-time), I have almost all of these concerts on DVD. I, for one, am super excited that I can buy them all on blu-ray AND get bonus material as well.

If you're a fan and don't own any/many of these concerts, I would highly recommend this box set! If you're looking for a good place to get into Rush, their live sets are a great way to go. This is a band that truly shines when they play live, and they do a great job of varying the material they play in concert. Sure, there are some staples like ""Limelight,"" ""YYZ,"" ""Working Man,"" etc that they play live almost every time, but each show finds them (generally) delving into material from different eras of the band (70s, 80s, 90s, etc). And the price for this set makes it cheaper than buying each show separately! Plus you get bonus live footage and a nice book/nice packaging!

If you aren't familiar with the concerts in this set, I'd like to highlight two in particular:

1) Time Machine Tour: This tour celebrated the anniversary of the landmark album ""Moving Pictures."" They played the album start to finish every night, and it was incredible. Excellent show.

2) Clockwork Angels Tour: This most recent tour promoted their newest release ""Clockwork Angels."" For the first half of the show, the guys play (mostly) deep cuts from the 80s. Some of these songs haven't been played live in eons (and some of them never, if I recall!). For the second half of the show, they play the new album almost in its entirety. They actually set band history here, too: they had a string section join them on stage for the rest of the show, which was the first time anyone joined the three of them on stage live. It is incredible. I sat in the seventh row at a show on this tour and got to re-live it by watching the film. It was just as great as in person (well, as close as it can get while filmed!).

Just because many Rush fans own these concerts doesn't mean this a 1-star product! In fact, it's quite the opposite! That being said, I really do hope they release the bonus disc as a separate package. I understand the feeling of bonus material being the draw and forcing you to consider double-dipping; I really do.

I would encourage you to adjust your reviews to reflect the product and its merits instead of reflecting your own dismay that you, as an avid fan, own these already. Great, then don't buy it! Just don't make it look like it's a terrible product because you're bitter!

Long live Rush, and I hope someone reading this review will take my word for it and explore a GREAT band!",1411084800,29,2824,4.469902912621359

6666026,1,B00NJADEAG,"Yes, yes, yes. We are all fans of Rush. Knowing that they are heading for retirement, it certainly makes sense to pad the back account. However, the fact that ""the fans"" are fanatical and it creeps Neil Peart out, I can understand that aspect. However, the thing that I find most abhorring is the way it is acceptable to embrace and take advantage of the fanaticism by releasing a box set that contains virtually all the same material their ""fans"" already have and only add in one bonus disc of never-before-seen material and at an appalling price to boot. If this package was half the price I would certainly be tempted to pick it up ( come on, we have all bought blank DVD's and CD's, and they do not cost much at all).
As it stands, it is not a ""good value"" for the diehards that already have all the previously released stuff.
I will simply wait for its release and wait for someone to post the vintage material on youtube. Besides, if it were really that great, it would have been released along time ago. These marketing people know that the diehards will find even the most lousy sounding bootlegs (not to say it will be lousy)irresistible and wet themselves trying to get it.",1410998400,13,1183,4.481481481481482

Rush has been on musical hiatus for all of '14, but powers that be felt the need to release this live video big box set for the big 4-0 party and we are all invited. Besides a bonus disc there is nothing new that hasn't been seen, heard or purchased already, that's what many are saying. Let me tell you non-believers of R40, I've owned every format of 2112 since the 8-track. I have Clockwork Angels on Vinyl, CD, Mp3...you get the picture. A dedicated fan must do what one has to. For myself to own all concerts on blu-ray is super. Anything else is a bonus plus the price is fair. I currently own live CA show in Blu-ray, the rest of them in dvd format. So for this guy R40 is a nice re-collection upgrade of live stuff from the greatest rock band the world over. If you don't like it simply don't buy it, but give these fellas a break because they have performed waaaaaay past anyone's expectations and don't deserve negative reviews especially from their longtime fans. They didn't do it for us in the first place if you haven't been listening. We're just very lucky to have enjoyed the ride in our time.

My name says exactly what I am.... a Rush fan. And this set is a perfect addition to my ever growing collection. I am rather impressed with this set, though I keep hearing about little easter eggs, or hidden gems if you want to call them that instead, in one or two of the discs. I have yet to find them, but I know I'm in for a treat with them.
I can say that by far, Time Machine was one of my favorites of their live stuff, and that's in this set. Rush In Rio starts the set, and that one was what I saw on MTV Live, which at the time I saw it, it was called Palladia, which it was in this concert that I met ""That Darn Dragon."" While I know some aren't exactly impressed with the humor and little pieces that were made just for the tours, I actually like these for the reason that it shows a side that you don't always think about wanting to see.
Some fans blasted this set for being a repeat of what they already had... but for those who had to add the live sets to their collection of DVDs, this does it, and has the extra footage, which others were a bit miffed about them not releasing the bonus stuff on a solo basis as well as part of the set.
