8628736,4,B00GYJWHQ6,"Love this series!  i was originally able to watch it on Netflix and decided i wanted it as part of my video library. Would recommend it to any Ricky Gervais fan.
The good news is that the dvd arrived earlier than expected, but the bad news is that i was unable to view it because it is  ""region 2"" and my machine apparently only plays ""region 1"".  A friend is able to play it on his gear so have been able watch it.  Wonder if there's a way to know that information prior to ordering video material.",1456185600,,499,4.11340206185567

8628738,5,B00GYJWHQ6,"If you don't laugh and cry, sometimes simultaneously, while watching this show, you're a robot.  I am not a fan of ""feel good"" shows and movies, and I watched this on a lark on Netflix.  From the first episode, I was transfixed.  I was leery that this would be a comedy making fun of old people and learning disabled people, but I couldn't have been more wrong.  The whole complex human dynamic is on display, but instead of concentrating on the negative and cynical, this accepts the negative in all of us while celebrating the positive.  I don't know if much of the show is ad-libbed, but if it isn't, the screenwriters are brilliant.  The dialogue is so real, the setting is so normal, and the situations are so standard that the whole thing feels like a documentary rather than fiction.  If I could give this 10 stars, I would.  I can't wait for Season 2 to be released on Netflix on May 30, 2014.",1399420800,,901,4.418181818181818
8628739,2,B00GYJWHQ6,"Although the show is comedic, this purchase was a waste of time because the format did not fit anything I tried to watch it on, being from another country. I was warned, so this was entirely my fault.",1393545600,,200,4.2894736842105265
8628740,5,B00GYJWHQ6,"Kindness is magic, and apparently rather genius as well. It's almost sad to think that what makes this show so beautiful is what is missing from a majority of our culture, kindness. It's crude, hilarious, spontaneous and amazing. I think it's safe to say that our cities, countries, and planet would all be in much better shape if there were more people like Derek around. (and Hannah and Dougie as well, of course!)",1391126400,2,416,4.712328767123288
8628741,5,B00GYJWHQ6,"From the mind of Ricky Gervais, DEREK is a show about a mentally challenged man named Derek who works at elderly home center. Derek is a little quirky, but extremely lovable and goes out of his way to befriend the residents of the place he works and make them feel comfortable. The show is filmed in a mockumentary style.

When I watched the first episode of DEREK, I wasn't sure what to think. Gervais shows are known for making fun of his characters and placing them in the most awkward positions possible. In the first episode of DEREK, there are some moments that appear that way. However, as I continued watching the series it became clear that DEREK isn't about making fun of people who work in nursing homes or with the elderly. Instead, its simply showing the struggles that those people deal with in their lives. There are comical bits, but the comedy is based in a more real blue collar existence than some of Gervais other shows, e.g. THE OFFICE or EXTRAS. Theres a huge amount of heart and respect in DEREK and despite the humorous bits, the character Derek is never the punch line or butt of any jokes. Season 1 of the show has seven episodes. They are as follows.

Episode 1  Pilot  this episode introduces us to the workers at Broadhill Retirement Home. These include Derek, Hannah (she runs the facility), and Dereks friends Dougie (Broadhills maintenance worker) and Kev. The episode ends on a bittersweetly.

Episode 2  A council official visits Broadhill. Cuts have to be made to the staff an changes made otherwise the facility will lose its public funding.

Episode 3  A young girl named Vicky is sent to Broadhill to do community service. At first she hates working there, but over time begins to like her work and sees Broadhill as the family she never had. Also, Derek celebrates his 50th Birthday.

Episode 4  Dougie arranges for a rumble sale to be held to raise money for Broadhill. One of the long term residents daughter comes to visit and which causes issues.

Episode 5  the residents go to a daytrip at the beach while Hannah stays behind to greet a new resident, Gill. Gill is accompanied by her daughter Rebecca who attended school with Hannah.

Episode 6  a young rap artist is sent to work at Broadhill for community service. Broadhill holds a talent night where Kev debuts his play about Duran Duran.

Episode 7  another long term resident dies and it affect Derek greatly. Also, Dereks dad attempts to make contact with him. The last 10 minutes of this episode are some of the best tv I have ever watched (second, in my opinion only to the finale of EXTRAS).

Overall, I really enjoyed watching DEREK and cant wait to see Season 2 when it becomes available. Fans of Gervais previous shows might be surprised by Derek because its a bit different from what hes done before. Also, DEREK is a show that people who have never seen a Ricky Gervais show might actually enjoy and not be offended by.",1389744000,4,2929,4.601923076923077
8628742,5,B00GYJWHQ6,"Heartwarming, funny, crude... All words to describe this show. Derek is set in an old person's home with Derek being a ""Helper"". Does he belong there or does he work there? You decide. These shows are great in that one minute you will be staring at the screen with your mouth open because you can't believe what they say, and the next minute you will be wiping tears from your eyes. His portrayal is so spot in that you forget you are watching ""David Brent"" and you begin to empathize with his character. A+ I hope they make years and years of this and don't stop it after 2 seasons and a special like they usually do. GO DEREK!!!!",1389052800,6,631,4.310924369747899
