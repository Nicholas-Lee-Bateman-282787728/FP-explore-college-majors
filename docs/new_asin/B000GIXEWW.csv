The acting was not good. The story line straight and bland. The film had uneven sound as the background noise shifted as they went back and forth as people spoke.

8132833,4,B000GIXEWW,"I think this was a good movie. It has a good story, it is handled in a way that it is easy to follow the movie, and suspense is always there.
As many thriller movie, it has crime, drug, murder; in other words it is a very realistic movie.
