L lot of these products are outdated like Bobbi Curl, and Kodak movie film. Then there are the political ads praising Nixon and the rest. There's even the Ciquita banana singing her theme song, and Jimmy Durante selling cereal! Ah, the good old days!",1262822400,6,404,4.785714285714286
3794702,5,B001TX05FW,"I am always fascinated by TV commercials, especially old one from the 50s & 60s. You can tell a lot about a culture from its commercials. The Alpine cigarette commercial with the guy smoking 2 cigarettes at once is priceless. Then there are classics like the cartoon kid that wants his Maypo. There's a wide variety of ads, from cereal to floor polish. Amazing!",1235606400,21,361,4.65625

8342446,5,B001TX05FW,Another great collection of commercials with very good print quality. These are not the ones that you commonly find in other sets. These were most likely from an ad agency.,1383868800,,172,4.766666666666667
8342447,5,B001TX05FW,It has the classic No Matter What Shape your Stomach's In from Alka-Seltzer and the important Television Code Ad was removed starting in 1983.,1359244800,2,142,4.958333333333333
8342448,5,B001TX05FW,Good audio/video quality for recording of commercials that are 50 years old. I enjoyed it. Has MANY commercials on it. Arrived on time and in great condition. Buy from with confidence.,1359158400,,184,4.967741935483871
8342449,3,B001TX05FW,"As much as I hate TV commercials today, I decided to buy this to reminise about my old, ""Baby Boomer"" days, and watch a bunch of old commercials.  I want to be real honest - - the 1950's commercials, in general, were so utterly boring compared to the 1960's commercials, when they started adding humor to commercials.  Classic examples are:  Noxema's ""Take it off, take it all off"" and the Colt 45 beer commercials, where the guy is sitting at the table waiting for his beer, with every distraction in the world going on around him.  Simply, commercials evolved to a new level during the 60's, and got much better.  Overall, this DVD is pretty decent.",1332547200,4,651,4.577586206896552
8342450,5,B001TX05FW,"I love old commercials. If you read between the lines, it says a lot of what was happening at the time. The 1950s and 1960s were THE age of American consumerism, and these ads refect that. I particularly enjoyed the political ads from those days. They seem so bizarre now. Imagine anyone having to think twice to vote for John Kennedy? Fun stuff.",1267574400,2,346,4.507936507936508
