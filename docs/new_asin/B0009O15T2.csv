8063982,3,B0009O15T2,"Bulldog Drummond's Revenge, 1937 film

The film begins with a view of London Bridge and London streets. How to retrieve a small package from a drain hole? We see a view of Scotland Yard (repeated in other films). A visitor tells Colonel Neilson about a plan to steal a secret formula for a new explosive. Sir John Haxton will carry this extremely powerful explosive in his private airplane. Something happens in the airplane to Sir John. A suitcase with a parachute falls from the airplane, then a man. Hugh Drummond visits the crash scene and finds a arm! At home the lights go out, somebody steals that suitcase from the airplane! Will this upset the wedding plans? No, they leave on the Dover train. The villains are on the same train. Hugh and Algy find one of the villains, dead from a gunshot. Suicide?

They smell jasmine perfume. Was that from the lady in the next compartment? Can Algy find the woman who was in the next compartment? ""But you promised."" Colonel Neilson hurries to Dover. The Dover Ferry will take travelers across the Channel. They suspect Nogais is using a disguise! Neilson tests those crystals, its not the hexanite. They must search the ship for Nogais and the explosive. When they return to their compartment they get a surprise. The return of Algy turns the tables, but there is another surprise! They chase the fleeing Nogais and find him in hiding for the end of the chase. Will the wedding go on as planned?

This adventure series mixed comedy and drama. The on again / off again wedding for Hugh and Phyllis became a running joke. Set in England, filmed in Hollywood, it was produced for a wide audience. ""Hexanite"" was a more powerful version of TNT that was used for torpedoes and bombs in WW II. Having a man disguised as a woman was unusual for that time, so too the use of a body part.

Bulldog Drummond's Peril, 1938 film

The story begins with cars on a road in London England. There is a notice about a wedding in Switzerland. [Note how Blanche uses that camera.] The gift of a large man-made diamond is a threat to the diamond cartel. Can it be stolen? ""No home is complete without one."" They find the detective hired to watch the gifts under a table! Would a man of wealth and position stoop to stealing? [How did he gain his wealth?] The ability to manufacture diamonds would destroy the value of real diamonds and the value of their company stock. Will this investigation interfere with the wedding? We see how they hide a diamond in a book. Hugh sends a cablegram to Neilson, who treats it as a joke. Can Hugh, Algy, and Tenny quickly fly to England? But there is zero visibility! Can Hugh land safely?

Sir Raymond Blantyre visits the scientist who manufactured the artificial diamond; he repeats the process. Professor Goodman plans to reveal the process to the public. This will result in a great loss for the diamond industry! [You know where this is going.] They offer a large sum for the exclusive rights to this process, a monopoly patent. But he refuses. Will this put him in great danger? It can affect the British Empire! Blantyre offers first 5,000 then 50,000! Will there be a double-cross? Later Hugh shows up. Tenny sees what happened, and follows the truck. Botulian shows up shows up and is accused of being there earlier. Botulian visits Hugh and gets Goodman's notes. Later Hugh visits Botulian to see Professor Goodman, and is captured. Where are they kept? Hugh's friends search all over. They escape, then Hugh must return to rescue Phyllis. There is a struggle, Hugh wins. Colonel Neilson arrives with the police to sort things out. Sir Raymond is taken into custody to be sent back to Switzerland for questioning. Somehow, the great damage to the diamond cartel will be averted.

Industrial grade diamonds are very important in manufacturing, but few know the details. This story is set in England but filmed in Hollywood. Hugh and Tenny seem derived from Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson. Note how the right to keep and bear arms was respected in Britain until 1946.",1332028800,,4048,4.653146853146853
8063983,5,B0009O15T2,"I had first read about Bulldog Drummond in a biography of Ian Flemming and was aware that he was the major influence for James Bond. But seeing these movies brought to light something more. If you are familiar with the James Bond novels you will see clearly how James Bond grew out of Bulldog Drummond, but if you watch these movies you will see how BD is the missing link with the great detectives of the nineteenth century. The way Bulldog Drummond both lives in the shadow of Sherlock Holmes and casts the shadow that will someday yield James Bond (of the books) is amazing.",1252886400,,577,4.504761904761905

8063985,5,B0009O15T2,Bulldog Drummond is a very good detective.  There are times when he isn't quite right and doesn't like to think someone else might be.  The Bulldog Drummond detective series is very interesting and very enjoyable.  I would reccommend them to anyone and everyone that likes a little mystery detective.  He doesn't like to think maybe he might have to give up his detective work for romance.  He's really into his job.,1203206400,,416,4.802816901408451
