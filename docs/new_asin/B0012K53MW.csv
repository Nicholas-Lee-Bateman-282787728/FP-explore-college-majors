8246519,5,B0012K53MW,"I'll be honest the quality of these videos aren't up to par on some episodes however I noticed a few episodes I wasn't able to find online.

There is at least one episode on 3 of the disk I ordered I didn't see and the price to buy them was worth it at the end so I'm not complaining at all.

I suggest anyone new to One Step Beyond watch it free on hulu and then decide for yourself if you want to purchase these disks.

I suggest you buy this to watch the first episode called Encounter which I wasn't able to find online which was based on a real life encounter of a ufo.",1359072000,3,574,3.9310344827586206
8246520,5,B0012K53MW,"i heard about ""one step beyond"" hosted by john newland, which was made during the 1950s and/or 1960s, and watched his ""next step beyond"" sequel to it while it was on television during the 1970s or 1980s, which i hope will come out on dvd soon.  i ordered, and very much enjoyed watching, the 15 volume set of ""one step beyond"" which tells stories concerning unexplained appearances and disappearances, ghosts, esp, ufos, and premonitions, to name a few.  cloris leachman plays a photographer in one story doing an article about this town in france.  needing someone to pose for pictures in her story, she assumes this man who unexpectedly shows up to be the person she needs.  he later on becomes upset, calls her by another woman's name, and tries to kill her.  what she finds out about him is surprising.  norman lloyd plays a man in another story who has an unusual blood type which is needed to save the life of a woman, played by suzanne pleshette.  he stopped donating blood to people years before because he always knew what would happen to them after they received his blood.  he is forced by a policeman (played by david white from ""bewitched"") to donate blood to this woman and knows she will die.  how she dies and by whom is the shocking and ironic ending.  michael ansara, charles bronson, william shallert, and charles aidman also star in some of the other stories.",1358553600,,1379,4.637860082304527
8246521,3,B0012K53MW,"Unfortunately, most of these individual DVDs and VHS are being sold here without a list of the episodes included. And since most versions are selling  the SAME episodes in smaller or bigger numbers, you should double-check ALL THE TIME in order to avoid buying repeats.
Now, why aren't all episodes being listed?
Something easily done,right? One wonders...

Close to half of the episodes in this series are not available (yet).
For the last 5 years or so, they have been rehashing the SAME episodes.
WHY?
So be alert! and lets all (the fans) INSIST on making available the other half of the episodes!!!",1222128000,13,602,4.834951456310679
