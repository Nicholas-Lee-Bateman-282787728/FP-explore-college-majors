This product allowed me to do that, and the picture quality was better than the original I viewed on TV in the late 1940s. It was just as interesting now as it was then.

7853795,4,6303854427,"""Radio Patrol"" is a 12 chapter serial released by Universal in 1937, directed by Ford Beebe and Cliff Smith, with story and screenplay by Wyndham Gittens, Norman S. Hall and Ray Trampe, based on the syndicated newspaper feature created by Charles Schmidt and Eddie Sullivan.

A down-on-his-luck inventor, John P. Adams (Harry Davenport) has developed a flexible, bullet-proof steel, which he hopes to sell to provide for his son Pinky (Mickey Rentschler).  But he is mysteriously killed while left alone to write down the formula at a steel mill after a demonstration for the mill owner, Mr. Wellington (C. Montague Shaw) and a representative of the Iranian government, Tahata (Frank Lackteen).  The formula has vanished, but Radio Patrolman Pat O'Hara (Grant Withers) and his partner Sam (Adrian Morris) capture a man named Selkirk (Max Hoffman, Jr.), whose sister Molly (Catherine Hughes) later visits him in jail, and is followed by the police to the steel mill since it appears she has been told where the formula is hidden.  But Tahata and a rival steel mill owner, Harrison (Gordon Hart) have sent their agents on a similar mission, so the search becomes quite a party, and it remains quite a party for the remaining eleven chapters before the real murderer is identified.

Sometimes Universal's complicated plots get in the way of the action, but it works very well here.  Grant Withers makes a believable, intelligent policeman, Adrian Morris is there mostly for ""comic"" relief but isn't too annoying.  We know some dirty work is afoot with Tahata, since Frank Lackteen is cast in the role, and Harrison's chief metallurgist, Stevens, is played by shifty-eyed Wheeler Oakman.  Catherine Hughes as Molly is actively involved in the plot, and Mickey Rentschler as Pinky is believably helpful, as is his dog, Irish (Silver Wolf).  The dialogue is fine, and many of the locations, such as the ""Egyptian Quarter"" keep up the interest.  While the special effects have the usual problem found in Universal serials -- even in 1937 the wrecked vehicle is about a decade older than the one shown about to go over the cliff -- and the ""action"" theme in the background music is mighty repetitive, the defects do not detract much from the overall quality.

VCI's DVD edition, # 8563, is on one disc.  The print is from a reissue, headed by ""Sherman S. Krellberg and Joseph Harris Present"" and these redone opening titles are pretty awful, gray and washed-out, with even some dimensional instability.  The chapters are better, with fairly good contrast and sharpness, for a 16mm print, though some of the defects look like they happened when the reduction was made, such as an amazing piece of ""stuff"" stuck to the bottom of the frame in Chapter Three for about half a minute, also present on an old VHS edition I have (not VCI's) that seems to be from a different film copy.  But while VCI's image quality is an improvement over that VHS edition, the sound is no better, having quite a bit of distortion in some chapters, mostly affecting the music but occasionally making the dialogue somewhat indistinct.  Once past the opening title, the credits look better, with motion in the background -- I especially like the guy riding a horse in city traffic who has to get out of the way of the fire truck from which the footage was shot.  The titles all have the same MPPDA number, 3407, but there are a number of minor editing errors, not the same in all chapters, for those who really want to find them.  What matters is that the chapters seem to be as complete as the Krellberg edition ever was, including the ""next week"" titles from the original release.  The only ""extra"" feature of the DVD is the original theatrical trailer.

It would be nice if a really clean copy of this serial turned up; it is one of Universal's best.  But until that miracle happens, VCI's DVD is a reasonable way to view it, and as usual with serials, one chapter at a time is best.",1306022400,3,3952,4.775330396475771
7853796,4,6303854427,"Agree with above review regarding the serial; it's fun and has some great cliffhangers.  VCI did the best with materials they had to work with.  The negatives for most of these serials no longer exist, so we are left with only 16mm television prints.  This version has the Universal Presents plastered over by Krellberg et al.  VCI has done a lot with the image, but the sound is distorted and noisy throughout (but all of the dialogue is discernable--only the music suffers).  This is probably the best viewing experience you're going to have for this title unless Universal still holds the negatives and releases their own pristine versions (NOT!).

If you want to see what VCI can do with outstanding source material, look at the GREEN HORNET serials recently released.  They are almost perfection.  Interestingly, they note a ""thanks"" to Universal Pictures on the package--although I doubt that Universal provided negatives/prints--the ownership of those passed to the copyright holder years ago.

I greatly admire VCI for what they do and buy almost all of their releases.  They should be greatly commended for releasing many of these Public Domain titles in decent transfers.

A question for the experts:
Are those chapter openings from the original 1937 release?  The shot of the camera tracking in to the boy on the couch has a 50's setting look.",1253145600,12,1354,4.995535714285714
