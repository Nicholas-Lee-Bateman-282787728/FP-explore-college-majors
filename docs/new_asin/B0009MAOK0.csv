8063117,4,B0009MAOK0,"There are six episodes on this DVD that are a lot of fun.  Being a fan of KISS, and especially of Gene Simmons, I enjoyed the interview with him that is an extra on the DVD.  Fun for me and my daughter.  Well worth it.",1127088000,2,218,3.8
8063118,5,B0009MAOK0,"This is an awesome show!! All the rock lyrics and dittys to fit the themed storyline. Well thought out and great writing. This show was actually created 2 years ago. Nick started playing it the beginning of 2005. Nick picked a winner again. I had to find out all the details of who created this show, I knew it had to be a rocker...I was suprised it was actually Gene Simmons. I was never a Kiss fan or into heavy metal, but I'm a huge fan of this show. I used play the drums and am now a 40 year old mother of three boys..7,5,& 3. We love to do the Rock Zilla howl!! My favorite episode is when Rock Zilla thinks he's old and needs to retire. There's something for everyone here. Catch it on Nick 7:00am or 2:30pm weekdays and weekends 1:00pm.",1125964800,3,744,4.173611111111111
