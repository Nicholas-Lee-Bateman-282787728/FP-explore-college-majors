3892766,5,B002B2QN4C,"I can not wait for a bumper/window sticker to proclaim how awesome Nia Dance is for everyone! I love this DVD and recommend it highly. I HATE going out to classes and watching myself in huge mirrors so if you are like me, this is the dance/exercise for you! I have limited free time and the thought of using my day off to get up early-go to a class- come home, makes me shudder! BUT I will get up at 7am three times a week and pop in the Nia Sanjana (I also purchased ""Opal"" for some variety after Sanjana) because I want to do it. You have to love/enjoy a workout to keep at it long term and I can say that I will never stop dancing Nia! One day, here in Portland, OR I may have the honor of meeting and having Debbie Rosas autograph my DVD cover!",1284249600,14,748,3.993333333333333
3892767,5,B002B2QN4C,"I can't say enough about how cool Nia is... I'm really enjoying this DVD. The routines are interesting, engaging and fun!! I saw Nia for the first time on the Veria channel. I was so excited about it that I immediately searched my area for instructors. Unfortunately, the closest to me is about 50 miles so the DVD's are my only hope. I am not disappointed. I'm so happy that there are quite a few more DVD's that I can look forward to after I master this one too!",1272326400,8,464,4.224719101123595
3892768,5,B002B2QN4C,I really love this NIA dvd. It's the first one I've done and I found it pretty easy to follow and I actually look forward to doing it again and again. When I follow this dvd I know I'm getting great exercise but it doesn't feel like a typical boring exercise routine. The music in it is fun and sometimes it feels like I'm dancing instead of exercising. I also like that as you get more comfortable with the routines you can alter your movements to make the work out a little harder. Superb dvd!,1265241600,18,495,4.221052631578948

8360607,5,B002B2QN4C,"I've been looking for a workout that won't cause injuries or my death and I believe I've found it! Nia is sort of hard to explain because it's a combination of martial arts, dance and aerobics and I realize that just saying this could be off-putting to some people. You almost have to try it or at least, check out Nia online (YouTube has some good short videos) to understand what it is. I've only used this DVD twice but I felt so good and energized after, that I'm excited to do it again and am looking forward to it.  I'm currently seeing a physical therapist for an overstretched hamstring from a year ago. I cautiously did the first Nia workout and I'm happy to report it did NOT make the hamstring injury worse; in fact, I actually felt a lot better! However, I'm taking it slow to begin with because I have a habit of re-injuring myself and I'd be so mad at myself if I couldn't do the workout! I really don't like 'the usual' aerobics classes at gyms & health clubs and have stopped attending them b/c I've had two total knee replacements since 2008. With Nia, there is no jumping around, there is no one screaming, ""No pain, no gain!"" In fact, you are told to relax and do it at wherever your body is today. Listening to our bodies is such good advice but in the more typical aerobics class and even in a marital arts yoga class, I've been told to push myself, etc. This really isn't where I am anymore. I'm planning to buy the rest of the DVDs; the music is a great mix and fun to workout to and each DVD has its own focus. Debbie Rosas, the co-founder of Nia, is a very good instructor. I do the routine in my living room and at the end of the hour, I can't believe it's over and I'm not gasping for breath yet I know I've gotten my heart rate up, I've sweated and completed an aerobic workout.",1404950400,,1806,4.204610951008646
8360608,5,B002B2QN4C,i have been hosting a class during the winter in a remote part of alaska without any workout studios - we love NIA here!,1393977600,,120,4.041666666666667
8360609,4,B002B2QN4C,The reason I got this was to help me with stress.  I am a full time caregiver and can very seldom leave home - this allows me to do all or part of the routine at my pace in my own home,1374451200,,184,3.380952380952381
8360610,2,B002B2QN4C,"I was at a Race for the Cure and we had a Nia instructor that did a routine for the crowd to get everyone warmed up.  I loved it! This DVD is made by the founder of Nia, but includes alot of out loud grunting and the like. That's not my cup of tea even when I am alone.  I think I'll stick with yoga.",1350000000,5,300,3.6
8360611,3,B002B2QN4C,"Sound editing is not high quality and instructor needs to be a lot more reliant on telling the class (and viewers) what to do. Many times you are having to look at the screen in order to see what you are supposed to be doing. Nia is really meant to be done in a class and not at home. But since my schedule is crazy busy, I have to settle for this.",1330992000,,348,3.8472222222222223
8360612,5,B002B2QN4C,"I purchased Nia Sanjana and the Nia book at the same time, and I'm glad I had a chance to read about it before trying out the video.  Reading the book really helped me take advantage of the video much better than if I had just tried to do the video by itself, because there is a huge ""mindful"" component to this exercise that makes it really special.

At 50+, I'm  mindful about the importance of good posture for a vital life.  I study the works of Esther Gokhale, Mary Bond and Pete Egoscue, and enjoy doing their recommended positions and exercises.  Most often, I use an Egoscue video, and can always feel the difference in my alignment after doing them.

After doing my Nia workout (and I'm still in the ""learning curve"" stage) I feel just as balanced and well-aligned as I do after Egoscue...and even more flexible.  From the very first workout, it has helped me move through my life with increased grace and ease.

Another benefit that I like a lot - my cravings for inappropriate foods disappear after my workouts. I know that lots of diets and exercise systems have that effect on people, but this is the first thing that I, personally, have done that has had that effect on me.  I'm pretty happy about that!

The third thing I really like about Nia Sanjana (and I presume this would be true of all the Nia videos) is the way it encourages me to focus on really feeling pleasurable sensations as I move, and to avoid anything that hurts.  There is something really nurturing about doing exercise with that mindset.

If you are looking for a nurturing, holistic exercise system that will get your heart pumping and sweat going, this should do the trick.  And if you want a gentle introduction to healing movement, this is it, too.  I recommend it highly.",1320451200,11,1762,4.517350157728707
8360613,5,B002B2QN4C,"All I can say is FUN!!!! I have 30 to 40 exercise tapes and I hate them all. Why? Because they're exercise tapes! When I get up in the morning to do one of these (I have all 4) I never think ""I've got to get up and exercise."" Instead, my brain, for what ever reason says, ""Hey it's time to dance."" What a difference that makes. Oh and just for the record, I stink at dancing! But I have so much fun doing this. I really work up a sweat and burn a ton of calories based on my Polar watch info. Oh and it is low impact. My knees love that. Enjoy!",1315785600,7,544,3.780701754385965
8360614,4,B002B2QN4C,"The Nia technique is a fun way to get moving. Part dance, part martial arts, part aerobics, the video is easy to follow and engaging.",1305849600,6,133,4.36
8360615,5,B002B2QN4C,"After a physically hard day of being a massage therapist as well as an aerobic dance teacher, I find the NIA workout to be both invigorating as well as relaxing.  My muscles can become very tense and sore, the Sanjana workout actually releases the tension and gives me energy.  I would highly recommend it for any level participant.",1302825600,7,332,4.706896551724138
