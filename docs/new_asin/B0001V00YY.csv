8016512,4,B0001V00YY,"One couple on the rocks.  Another, seemingly solid.  (The third not worth mentioning.) Yet, the outcomes are not what one would expect and could not be more fidderent.  Fans of British tv and films will not be disappointed by the delivery of this stellar cast of actors.",1421798400,2,270,4.702127659574468
8016513,4,B0001V00YY,It's a good series that I enjoyed.  As always Brenda Blethyn was wonderful. Her transformation from frigett to hot was great to watch.,1374537600,2,134,4.826086956521739
8016514,3,B0001V00YY,"Sadly, the product was defective. The second disc would not play.  I have returned it and to this date have not received acknowledgement that the product has been returned.  I am hoping for a satisfactory settlement in this matter.",1346803200,,231,4.897435897435898
8016515,3,B0001V00YY,"The series looks at several couples at different points in their relationships. An older couple (married over 25 years), a couple together/not married for less than 10, and a couple still dating. They are connected via family ties or through a sex therapist (but she is one of the couples too). The topics are sexual in nature and deal with miscommunication in the bedroom and out of it, infidelity, and forgiveness. It was suprising to see British actors you generally see in period/costume dramas in their PJs or nothing at all. The series is over 7 years old, but I don't think it is too dated relative to the clothes, cars, and settings. I thought it gave some insight into sex therapy.",1269820800,7,690,4.663934426229508
