7309121,5,B010DRLTIG,"Wow! Just watched this awesome digitally restored Blu Ray collection of 4 movies. The colors and clarity are bright & vibrant. Don't forget these movies first came out 40 years ago so the special effects by todays standards might seem a little rough but to me it adds to the ""fun"" of these classics. You can't beat the value of this collection compared to buying each movie separately.",1456272000,6,385,4.676470588235294
7309122,5,B010DRLTIG,"this collection BLOWS AWAY the high price Harryhausen films from TWILIGHT TIME blu rays.

SINBAD films on this blu ray collection looks better then the twilight time versions .JASON and the ARGONAUTS blu ray looks better then COLUMBIA sony version. AND this collection plays on usa blu ray machines.",1455667200,12,299,5.1020408163265305

Good seller,  product came without issues and on time.",1452816000,3,190,4.757575757575758
7309124,5,B010DRLTIG,"Just being able to have The Golden Voyage of Sinbad and Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger on blu ray, makes this box set absolutely worth the price. Thank you, for your prompt service and exceptional savings.",1449273600,4,206,4.447368421052632
7309125,5,B010DRLTIG,"We have here some of the late Harryhausen's later works, alas, it is an import, so a multi region Blu-ray player is needed to play these discs back. None the less, the picture is first class, as is the sound. Once again we are transported back to the land of imagination as each story unfolds. I an a long term fan of the late Harryhausen, so this fills out my collection nicely. I can  say to one  these films are the perfect thing to share with your kids during these summer months.",1499904000,,484,4.25

7309129,5,B010DRLTIG,"Shame these aren't available on US Blu Rays, but that is what it is. I hesitate when buying imports, don't know if they have access to good prints to work from, of if the quality will disappoint. For this Australian edition, the quality was great. Nice to have these films in HD!",1497830400,,279,4.384615384615385

I admire for the intention to prepare such a fantastic collection product",1490745600,,96,5.466666666666667
7309134,5,B010DRLTIG,"I loved every movie in this compilation. If I had one complaint is that I wish that the producers had settled on one actor to play Sinbad rather than a different actor in each of the three movies. That said I still enjoyed all of the Sinbad movies and ""Jason and the Argonauts"" has been one of my favorite movies since I was very young. Get this set and you will not be disappointed. The acting is good and the special effects (no surprise) are excellent. As a bonus you can see a young Jane Seymour in 1977's ""Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger"". It just highlights how unchanged her beauty is 40 years later. Amazing!",1484179200,3,616,4.273504273504273
7309135,5,B010DRLTIG,"Amazingly, the two later movies The Golden Voyage of Sinbad (1973), and Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger (1977) maintain the magical look and feel of Ray Harryhausen's earlier classics The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958) and Jason and the Argonauts (1963).

Blu-Ray transfer looks and sounds good.",1481328000,2,292,4.959183673469388
7309136,5,B010DRLTIG,"This is a great import collection that plays on my U.S. blu-ray player. I previously owned two of the four movies, and the transfer seems exactly as the U.S. versions, and the same extras ported over as well. I have to say, the artwork on the discs of the U.S. versions are more appealing as are the movie menus. The U.S. discs feature movie artwork on the movie disc, and the menus are animated. In this collection, the discs are just black and say The Ray Harryhausen collection: disc 1,2,3, etc. The menus are just a static picture from the corresponding movie poster. Just mentioning this, in case that matters to the most picky of collectors. Where this collection exceeds is the overall value in which you get all the movies in an attractive blu-ray case that houses all the movies conveniently in one place. The movies come out to about $9 each, whereas each U.S. disc sells for about $15- $25 each. I can live with static menus for the big a difference in price. Buying the remaining two U.S. discs would have cost about the same or more to buy this whole collection.",1480118400,14,1075,4.517948717948718

7309141,5,B010DRLTIG,"JUST FINISHED WATCHING THE FOURTH DISK LAST NIGHT. BRINGS BACK MEMORIES. HOLD YOUR EARS WHEN JANE SEYMOUR IS IN THE PICTURE. WHAT A SCREAMER!! MUST HAVE BEEN HER FIRST ACTING JOB. SHE'S COME A LONG WAY ""BABY"". HARDLY RECOGNIZED MARGARET WHITING. REMEMBER HER FROM EARLY TV, I THINK.
ANYWAY, EVEN THOUGH THESE WERE CONSIDERED B MOVIES, THEY WERE FUN TO WATCH AGAIN AND KNOW WE CAN DO SO AGAIN.",1469750400,5,392,4.695652173913044
7309142,5,B010DRLTIG,"I saw this many years ago in VHS format and it was great then but in the Blu-ray remastering it is like I am watching it new all over again.  I love it.  The remastering is great and the colors are bright and vivid.
This is one of those must have movies for your coleciton.

Thank youj",1469059200,3,285,3.9649122807017543
7309143,5,B010DRLTIG,I remember two of the four movies from my own childhood and purchased the set to watch with the family. My six year old is in love with the claymation figures and we even managed to keep our 10yr old interested even though these movies came out many moons ago. Well worth the money and will add it to our family dvd collection.,1468800000,5,327,4.2063492063492065

7309146,5,B010DRLTIG,"Great deal to get these 4 Ray Harryhausen classics on Blu-ray. ""Jason and the Argonauts"" looks better on Blu-ray than it ever did anywhere else (even when new and in the theaters). ""The Golden Voyage of Sinbad"" looks great and every bit as good as it looked theatrically -- A really fun and colorful adventure with the battle with the six-armed idol a great cinema sequence. ""Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger"" looks good, but it is the weaker of Harryhausen's 3 Sinbad movies. The best of the 3 Sinbad movies is ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad,"" but this film needs a better transfer -- It is the oldest transfer of the bunch, and I have seen a 35mm theatrical film print of this film about 3 years ago that blows this Blu-ray out of the water.",1462406400,9,737,4.3478260869565215

7309149,5,B010DRLTIG,"great value, region free (It is NOT region locked to B) 4 great Ray Harryhausen films, two of which, The Golden Voyage of Sinbad and Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger, are only available in expensive, limited edition Twilight Time Blu-rays.  These seem to be the same transfers and the same extra features. Buy with confidence, this WILL play in your American Blu-ray player",1460073600,46,372,4.723076923076923
7309150,5,B010DRLTIG,I seriously doubt you could find a better package of Ray Harryhausen's Sinbad films anywhere in the history of home video.  This is so awesome it defies conventional scientific explanation.,1459641600,3,189,5.3

7309152,5,B010DRLTIG,"4 Classic films at a reasonable price! Region free, excellent product. Thank you to whatever foreign distributor released this set. American video distributors just don't get it, they hike prices up too high, and rarely release series in complete sets - in an effort to bleed you for every penny. It's kind of difficult to buy American, when you can get imports as these at a fraction of cost. I'd buy many more , if more titles were available in region free formats. Much appreciation, this completes my Ray Harryhausen collection! Very thankful to FINALLY own the complete Sindbad Trilogy on Blu-ray. Great stuff! Thanks again.",1457395200,24,629,4.943396226415095

7309154,5,B010DRLTIG,"This is a great deal, because these four movies are outstanding and this is a better value than buying them individually. They play on US Blu-Ray players, which is great. While you can get Jason and the Argonauts and The 7th Voyage of Sinbad separately, Golden Voyage and Eye of the Tiger are much harder to find, so I snapped this up! Worth the investment.",1456704000,29,357,4.507692307692308

8722160,5,B010DRLTIG,"Being a Ray Harryhausen fan, I had to purchase this movie.  It certainly wasn't my favorite because I've always felt that Patrick Wayne was miscast as Sinbad.  I found his portrayal of the Sinbad character a bit contrived, stiff and sluggish.  His thick American accent was also too distracting for me.  When he spoke, all I could picture was someone who was grilling steaks at a barbecue party.  I was actually yearning for John Phillip Law's portrayal.  But being a family movie, this criticism is admittedly a bit harsh.  This is, after all, a fun and campy family movie.  All in all, I still find the movie entertaining and the sight of Jane Seymour is captivating.

Of course, the stop-motion animation characters evoke  a nostalgic and magical appeal of their own.  The only outright flaws are the occasional abrupt shifts of position of the furs on the baboon and the saber-toothed tiger.

The fresh print of film seen through the Blu-ray format is stunning.  Deep shadows and deep, rich colors add to the appeal of the story.  I love those intense purple hues!  The restoration for the sound is also quite good.  While it won't set any records, at least it's now updated to discrete Dolby Digital 5.1 so that you can hear occasional cues in the proper position and the music takes on a whole new dimension with the added depth.",1504915200,2,1335,4.689655172413793
