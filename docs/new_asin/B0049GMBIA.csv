8419039,4,B0049GMBIA,"I have not yet found a means to access this video.
It doesnt seem to be a regular PAL format.
A pity, cause I liked this series in the UK.
I just bought a new Phillips DVD player,
Thats supposed to play both PAL and NTSC format,
so, my fingers are crossed!",1518307200,,256,3.9423076923076925
8419040,5,B0049GMBIA,"How refreshing to discover another series where interesting stories and quaint acting reign instead of gratuitous violence, sex and special effects.  A more sober side to Cold War spy stories than Bond, The Avengers, etc.  Well worth the cost.",1418688000,,243,5.205128205128205
8419041,5,B0049GMBIA,"The greatest series of Callan, even better that the US available series in color and on dvd.  Ok, you have to buy a dvd player for Region 2 (Toshiba has a great one that works without a hitch) and it is monochrome, but worth the money and trouble getting this video set.",1414195200,,270,4.1923076923076925
8419042,5,B0049GMBIA,Great.,1409097600,,6,6.0
8419043,5,B0049GMBIA,A wonderful trip down memory lane.  Just wish there were more episodes surviving.  Maybe someone will find them in the basement at the BBBCB!,1391299200,,141,4.833333333333333
8419044,4,B0049GMBIA,It must be said that times have changed and production has improved but good acting still wins. This was made before colour TV but monochrome only enhances the bleak atmosphere of the government agent's life.  This series went on to become bigger and more polished but those early years are the best with excellent actors and true Sixties style.,1338681600,2,345,4.8474576271186445
8419045,5,B0049GMBIA,"There are only two episodes in Series 1, besides the Pilot (1967) and 9 episodes in Series 2 (1969), so there may be lost episodes, which may be what the box means by all ""remaining"" episodes of Series 1 and 2.  Still, there is the same high-quality writing, acting and directing as Set 1 and Set 2 (the color episodes, which are Series 3 and 4.)  If there are missing episodes, these are still worth seeing to fill in the gaps in the Callan story, particularly the last episode of Series 2, which sheds more light on Set 1. The monochrome is not high quality Black & White, but good enough, for the age of the material.  I did not experience any extraneous noise on my Sony DVP NS508P universal DVD player.  This is a PAL Region 2 DVD set, so you'll need to watch on your computer or universal DVD player.  I would put Callan in the top 100 TV shows of all time.  It was way ahead of its time. This is high-quality TV!",1328313600,8,919,4.193181818181818
8419046,4,B0049GMBIA,"If you like Callan Series 3 and 4 (the colour years) and would like to see more, this is a good buy with all the remaining episodes from Series 1 and 2 (the black and white years).  The original Armchair Theatre is included, 'A Magnum for Schneider.'  Same story as the 1974 movie 'A Red File For Callan', but condensed into one hour.  (So no landrovers driving through glasshouses).  There is a high pitched whistling noise accompanying some scenes, but not often and not enough to ruin the viewing.  Series 1 episodes had annoying habit of hearing Callan's thoughts, but by Series 2 this writing style had mostly ceased.  Series 2 is more in the vein of Series 3.  All the previous Hunters appear including the episodes where they are 'removed' from the job.  The all important final Series 2 episode which Series 3 picks up from is also included.",1304985600,8,849,4.613333333333333
