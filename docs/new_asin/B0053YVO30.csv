8455967,5,B0053YVO30,This is a progressive learning belly dance tape with several performances of the steps thus far and then a final performance at the end in costume. Very enjoyable and includes a gypsy flair in several of the moves.,1444435200,,214,4.657894736842105

8455969,4,B0053YVO30,"Ansuya has a style all her own. If I were to see just her shadow, I'd know it's her dancing. And much of her dancing has been Turkish flavoured. Strong energetic joyful moves.
In Istanbul Nights, Ansuya teaches a full choreography - and every bit of it is her style. It's a lovely choreography, really. When she performs it with improvisations at the end of the video, you can just see how joyous and almost ecstatic it is. Here, of course, she uses her lovely hair beautifully to enhance that feeling.
On this instructional, we dive straight into the combinations that make up the choreography. The music to which it's set is the lively Istanbul Nights by Bodyshock. I wouldn't be particularly fond of it otherwise, but Ansuya's choreography gives it meaning. That's just me - not fond of pop-flavoured dance music. So anyway, she breaks down each move pretty well, including the hand moves and starting poses. The instruction is thorough, but rapid, and each combo is dealt with separately, and then after a while, a bunch is handled together with cues and without cues but with music.
And here's where I have a problem. We go through six combos before we do anything at all with music. The way better thing to do would have been to finish each combo and practice it with music. That's a standard, but it's a standard for a reason. It works. I think it would be specially helpful when the choreography is as fast as this one is. And then, when we get to the music part, it would also be nice to slightly cue the moves - not explain, but just call out each. Again, you cannot be watching while you're dancing - it's not only fast, but you have your back to the TV or whatever some of the time, and you do a lot of turns during which you again can't catch what's happening. This problem isn't unique to this video though, so let's not hold it against it.
I don't believe this is a beginners' choreography. You need to know your basics and have built up enough muscle strength to handle strong hip twists without spraining anything, turns and much more. It's much more appropriate for intermediate dancers who also will know what to do about executing moves safely.
For me, the fact that there's no stopping to practice after each combo comes very much in the way and I'd have to find some workarounds to this. But anyone who doesn't mind that and is able to keep pace  doing six combos at a time without music before a practice, should be okay. Since one of the reviewers here seems to find the teaching too slow, I presume there will be many others who find the pace okay.
On this video is also a short session on finger cymbals - something Ansuya specializes in - because she performs the choreography with those.
Overall, I think the DVD could have been made a lot better, but the strength of the dancer and the lovely choreography carry it through.",1346371200,7,2852,4.495183044315993
8455970,4,B0053YVO30,"This video is very nice for beggining to new intermediate dancers. There is a promotional video for this DVD on youtube. It does not show the whole dance, but you may find it helpful. I enjoyed watching this choregraphy and using elements in my own dance. Ansuya has a very distinct dance style and she gives you a wonderful taste of that style in this choreography.",1341360000,5,366,4.5606060606060606
8455971,5,B0053YVO30,"I have looked through this dvd and the instruction is very slow, she explains everything very clearly which is good, but I like to go a bit faster so I can keep moving, but once she starts moving it is good and her routines a really nice and balanced doing them on each side of the body.  The zill instruction section is very short, but I suppose that is a whole new dvd as it is an art playing the zills.  But I will definitely be doing this dvd in the future.",1338076800,,461,4.0
8455972,5,B0053YVO30,"I have many bellydance instruction DVD's and this one is great. If you love Ansuya's signature style (and who doesn't really?) and want to learn  how she does what she does(like layered shimmies, traveling patterns, spins, locks, pops) then this is for you. Video is taught facing a mirror, so it is extremely easy to follow along... classroom style. Ansuya delivers concise directions and technical breakdown of all combos. I have taken classes with Ansuya and she is just as upbeat and funny in this video as she is in the classroom. Ansuya's musicality and adaptation of the material results in a beautiful, exotic, timeless and empowering choreography that any dancer would enjoy learning, performing or watching.",1322956800,7,717,5.128205128205129
