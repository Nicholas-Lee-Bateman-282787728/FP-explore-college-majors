7920978,1,B00004RF72,"This DVD is a ripoff. Notice that no running time is given, which is less than an hour, and there is no comment about it from the reviewers, who never even watched this DVD anyway; this is an all too common problem on Amazon - bogus reviews. I bought this junk from Amazon. The most important criterion in making a movie of lovely boys is a good picture, even more important than the boys. What good are pretty boys if no one can see them in their glory. The picture sucks! Only a couple of the boys are 10s; the rest are just OK. The action is boring; yes, I know it's soft porn. This junk was foisted on the gay viewers by a phony description and bogus reviews just to make a dirty buck. It seems that the only reviews on Amazon to be trusted are the bad ones. Avoid this turkey.",1376006400,,781,4.111111111111111
7920979,4,B00004RF72,"Call these actors or models super boys, as the British do, if you like; they are very lovely lads who amply merit such adulation! ""Boys at Play"" (the second part of the series ""Boy""), released as Pride Video PRI-31025 in Canada and the U. S. of A.  In the U.K., alternatively, it is titled ""Super Boys"". The video is part of that multi-DVD series or (depending on one`s perception) set, ""Boy"", each disc separately packaged for sale. Only ""Boys at Play""/""Super Boys"" varies in title between the editions in the two differing video transatlantic standards for playback. The titles of the others are the same for North American and U.K./European markets. I was a bit perplexed to see Johan Paulik as the DVD box` ""cover boy"" for ""Boys at Play"", since my copy has a photo of Lukas Ridgeston on the front cover of the box; Paulik's image flickers past on the screen as barely more than a flash. However, this DVD, under either title, seems to be the same item, just repackaged for the container's outside visual aspect.

Incidentally, for those whom Lukas Ridgeston and Johan Paulik are especially of interest, ""Boy: 3, Boy Wonder"", for its part, has both of these male erotic celebrities, especially the former, in scenes from some footage in which they were filmed looking somewhat (at least to my eyes) more boyishly youthful and almost adolescently ardent than in other such excerpts featuring these two which appear in Pride Video's ""Boy"" series. Since, at least for now, I am not reviewing ""Boy: 3"" separately, I shall include some brief remarks about it here in this Amazon review for ""Boy 2"". Ridgeston, in ""Boy: 3"", has a scene copulating with a lad whom the video calls ""Claus"", a fine beauty who is more sleekly slender and more junior-looking than Ridgeston; on also sees ""Claus"" in ""Boy: 3"" self-pleasuring himself, with vigourous abandon, to highly agreeable effect. Elsewhere in ""Boy: 3"", the moments devoted to the two most juvenile-looking blond lads, named ""Danny"" and ""Marek"", feature them as the youngest-looking (especially the shorter of the two) and most adolescently playful of this video's boys, a real treat for viewers who particularly fancy ""twinks"". Not to forget Johan Paulik's scene, ""Boy: 3"" pairs him in that video with a superbly handsome lad (especially for his impish and delightfully characterful face) called ""Rikki"", making this yet another exceptionally appealing scene in Johan Paulik's large videography. The most beauteous of the young men in ""Boy: 3"", however, is Stefan Andersen, whose magnificently contoured and muscularly well developed (but, thankfully, not bulky) body and finely aristocratic face look like he could have sprung grippingly to one's attention in a Caravaggio male nude oil painting. Andersen's scene, opening the video, has him lolling languorously on a couch, masturbating; the young dude's sheer beauty makes it possible for his sexually low-voltage scene not to seem unduly disappointing.

Here is a list of the parts in sequence by series (or set) numbering, of those of which I am aware, of Pride Video`s ""Boy"":

Boy: [1], Bohemian Boys; Sex and Sensuality in Bohemia (Pride Video PRI-31019, as released in Canada and the U.S.). N.B.: The models/actors are unnamed on the container of this DVD, but they include Martin Valko, Daniel Valent, and Johan Paulik among them.

Boy: 2, Boys at Play (Pride Video PRI-31025, as released in Canada and the U.S.). In the U.K. it is titled ""Super Boys"". N.B.: Making only brief appearances on this video are, both of them devastatingly beautiful, Martin Valko and Ken Christy, but the principal actor/model featured, if one can say that there be such, is Lukas Ridgeston. All of the guys are exceptionally handsome, too, each in his own way.

Boy: 3, Boy Wonder (Pride Video PRI-31028, as released in Canada and the U.S.). N.B.: Among the actors/models who are identified adequately by both the usual first and last names by which they choose to identify themselves are Stefan Andersen, Johan Paulik, and Lukas Ridgeston.

Boy: 4, Boy, oh Boy (Pride Video PRI-31018, as released in Canada and the U.S.)

Atop that, there are other Pride Video (now Wolfe Video`s products to sell) titles with ""Boy"" otherwise as part of the wording which seem to be loosely related to the ""Boy"" tetralogy itself, but there is no need to list them also here. Some are distributed on the various national Amazon WWW sites, but all are available from Wolfe Video`s own Website. (When Pride Video folded, Wolfe Video took over its products.)

Some of the content, too, of ""Boy: 2, Boys at Play"" (or ""Super Boys""), to return to the subject of the DVD specifically under review here, relates, in particular, to other videos from both Pride Vision and the Bel Ami label (and Ayor, too, perhaps?) which so often feature may of the lads who appear on Pride Video`s DVDs. This viewer, for sure, has seen, on other videos, some of what appears on ""Boys at Play"". Two of these familiar video-morsels from other Pride and Bel Ami DVDs are among the choicest, most tenderly sensuous gay video footage which one ever could hope to view.

In the case of the all-too-brief segment, affording only tantalising glimpses seen here (right at the outset of this video) of it, which features Lukas Ridgeston variously caressing and strolling with, in both circumstances stark naked, the inimitable Ken Christy (whose exquisitely beauteous looks so hauntingly recall a young Robert Fitzgerald Kennedy). This derives from ""Tender Strangers"", Christy's only film and the very first that Ridgeston ever did for the Bel Ami Studio (a film which, in a segment of it not sampled on ""Boys at Play"", has the gorgeous Martin Valko in the cast, too). The gay video collector must acquire that marvellous item, which reappeared some years ago on a double-DVD release that paired ""Tender Strangers"" with another vintage Bel Ami success, ""Frisky Summer: 1, Best Friends"", the packaging more prominently displaying the latter title, the superb cast of which features Johan Paulik with a bevy of, indeed, very sweetly lovely lads. The two reissued videos are boxed together in a single container, in the series, ""Bel Ami Classic Collection"", on the Bel Ami label; there is no release number shown on the item itemself, but it is indicated a DSF-1-116 in a printed Bel Ami catalogue.

There is much more sampled on ""Boys at Play"" of the scene between lads who have sex in a derelict old edifice (already alluded to), which this viewer also had seen before viewing this video. It appears also on another Pride DVD, titled ""Alfresco"" (Pride Video WOL-3758-D as numbered on the container; VFC-01658/PRI-71014 on the DVD disc itself). This is one of the most memorable depictions of gay male sex that I ever have seen. The two youths are quite appealing, although Pride/Wolfe-Bel Ami-Ayor has many actors/models who are of even more stunning looks, individually, than these two lads, who are so well matched. It is the natural, yet sensuously intense, eager love-making of their two nicely developed bodies (which avoid being bulkily muscular in any disproportionate way) and of their fresh, unspoiled faces, joyously smiling and laughing, that so moves the viewer to excitement at this scene. I best can describe it by repeating what I had written in my review of ""Alfresco""`for Amazon. ""In the episode titled 'Come out to Play?', two sweetly handsome boys go [to an abandoned factory] to have sex. And what love-making they have! The last embrace, of one of them posed leaning backwards, buck-naked, against his equally bare mate, who holds him in his arms, the frontmost lad's chest raised up, his sleekly muscled torso forward and his [large], tumescent (but, by this point, not quite still fully erect) penis lolling from side to side, is simply one of the most breath-taking camera shots, whether still or moving image, of two naked gay young men together that these eyes ever have beheld, a sensuous pose worthy of Caravaggio's artistic attentions!""

Backing up from that concluding point in the video, the first two relatively long scenes, after the camera leaves off initially making cinema-love with Ridgeston and Christy's bodies together, takes place in familiar settings for gay erotica, in a bedroom, on bed and in upholstered chair, between two young men who make love (the lad with the dark brown hair looking for all the world like the actor Ethan Hawke, but undressed!). Then, shifting to another scene and another man, the setting is a pool and its shower room (where there are passing glimpses twice of Martin Valko), the featured guy is more robustly macho in look and manner than most of these boys; he caresses himself as the water streams down his naked body, then towels himself dry. In the scene after that one, after Lukas Ridgeston and a taller youth, who is of elegantly lanky build, flirt, kiss, and fellate in a public facility's bathroom, they move on to an adjacent room and, after embracing some more, take turns copulating in ""top"" and ""bottom"" positions, each penetrating the other at the loins, then being penetrated, in turn, with intermittent flashbacks to what they had been doing in the bathroom. The scene ensuing after that is of an attractive young dude (whose face, especially, is sweetly handsome), who is arousing himself by rubbing himself in various ways upon the bedding on which he lounges. Then follows that wonderful scene, already described, of the two boys making love in the old, disused factory, to end the film.

This is a DVD worth having, when affordably priced, even despite some possible duplication of scenes between it and other DVDs in one's collection.",1356998400,,9661,4.967223252937539
