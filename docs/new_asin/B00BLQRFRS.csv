5646801,5,B00BLQRFRS,"If you are new to Masamune Shirow's work (The manga artist who created the manga for Appleseed, Ghost in the Shell, and lesser known works which were also adapted into anime series such as Dominion Tank Police, the OVA Landlock, and the original Appleseed OVA anime.), in Appleseed XIII you will be getting a faithful rendering of Shirow's Appleseed universe and characters.  It is every bit political and action packed as any previous anime or movies.  It is also just as thought-provoking.

This TV series does stay true to Duenan and Briearios's characters, along with supporting cast like Hitomi and others in ESWAT.  You get the beer drinking Duenan, and who is also always ready for confronting terrorists alongside Briaerios in defense of the city of Olympus which they have made their home.  You also get plenty of Shirow style no-nonsense dialogue when it comes to crime fighting and the usual sort of police procedural found in the Ghost in the Shell TV series and movies.

The animation is top-notch for any anime TV series.  You can check trailers for this show elsewhere and judge for yourself.  This isn't a movie, it's a TV series, and it has the artistic direction of a TV series, but within Appleseed XIII you will see as beautiful art as anything you've seen in anime.  The CGI shows every character's emotion superbly, and the mechanical designs of the various robots, androids, ""flying piloted robots of various sizes,"" and everything else is beautiful and true to Shirow's original mechanical designs.

This show also has the time to explore the relationship between Duenan and Briarieos and certain conflicts that come up between them.  On lighter notes, the show has the space to explore single episode stories that paint a deeper picture of the city of Olympus and its inhabitants.  So you get an amazing view of the city itself that you don't get from the previous movies.  If you are a Masamune Shirow fan, you owe it to yourself to see this TV series.  It really paints an amazing picture of the Appleseed universe and will give you plenty of politics, philosophy, action, and even those heartfelt moments that occur between Deunan and Briearios.  This is Science-Fiction that is wholly unique.",1372204800,37,2221,4.8853333333333335
5646802,3,B00BLQRFRS,"After having see half the episodes, so far, I have to agree that, while enjoyable, it just doesn't hold up.
Previous to this series, NOIR held the record for the use of flashback scenes.  This one blew it out of the water.
The animation wasn't disgraceful; just distracting, especially the teeth.  Ovarall, it actually reminds me of the rotoscoping that was used for ""A Scanner Darkly"".
The characers just don't have the same vibe as before nor do they really reflect the characterization from the manga; except, maybe, Lance and Kotus.  I can forgive this because the original characters are pretty complex and it's difficult to portray this in a short form like a video or series.  Perhaps the best portrayal of Deunan that I remember is the old cell animated ova.
The writing isn't bad.  It should be noted that Appleseed came before GitS, so the material is a little dated to begin with, and the writers are putting their own spin on things.  While it's not classic Masamune Shirow, is ok.",1370649600,17,993,4.710982658959537
5646803,4,B00BLQRFRS,"It has a good concept and story. The only problem I have with this series is the animation . Don't get me wrong, it is not bad but it is not good either. Don't let the animation stop you from checking out the great series. If you like action,mecha, military police and science fiction  or if you are a fan of the movies I highly recommend this series",1370390400,,350,4.147058823529412
5646804,3,B00BLQRFRS,Not enough action and way too slow compared to the first two movies.  They made this a love story and when watching anime I am not interested in a love story between two animated characters.  They made the relationship between the two characters the center piece instead of the non-stop creative action and stimulating visuals of the first two movies in this series.  I enjoyed the first two movies of Appleseed hated this one and I was fan of this series.,1425081600,2,456,4.604938271604938

5646806,3,B00BLQRFRS,There are some good episodes but I found the whole series a little confusing and a little cheesie. The animation is weird.  The voice acting is good.  The action scenes are pretty good.  I just hoped for so much more from this show.  A little disappointed.,1422662400,,256,4.5

5646815,2,B00BLQRFRS,"I'm a huge fan of Appleseed, from the manga to the anime, and I simply can't recommend this series at all. If you can get past the mediocre animation quality, the story doesn't fit well together and the relationship between Deunan and Briareos is completely wrong. I really wanted to like this series, but I simply can't.",1409184000,4,321,4.649122807017544
5646816,2,B00BLQRFRS,"Being a long-time fan of Appleseed franchise I bought this series and was very disappointed.

First of all it is extremely repetitive. Almost every episode repeats ""the story so far"". It feels like almost a quarter of a time you re-watch the dialogs and scenes you already saw.

But the biggest problem of the series is with the main idea of the story, and huge holes in logic. The Bad Girl wants to kill all bioroids which were born from her late husbands DNA. Why??? And at least one of these bioriod is a very old man. How??? And why were these bioroids so important in the first place? To send him/her in space??? Why this particular bunch of bioroids???
Questions, questions, and no answers.

On a plus side: I liked this incarnation of Hitomy. She is wearing a sexy leotard and have a joyful personality.
... no more pluses.

Overall:
If you are not a collector of Appleseed franchise: skip this.
If you want to know what Appleseed is about: start with movies.",1407715200,3,966,4.5344827586206895
5646817,3,B00BLQRFRS,"I bought this series on a whim since I recently upgraded to join the Hi-Def world finally. I have been a huge Appleseed fan since the original manga was in stores in the 80's. This ...is not exactly what Appleseed is about. Deunan is shown as always needing Briareos' protection, not being able to do things on her own much. That is not the Deunan I know! Briareos is always jumping in to protect her ...""because he must"". Why Bri? Could it be because you love her and not because that is what her pops said you must do? They never get into the fact that the 2 of them have been lovers for a long time. But, that is consistant with the '04 movie, when they basically reintroduce the 2 of them after they had been separated, which was not in the manga. The graphics were solid, but nothing special and the story left much of the true politics and intrigue of the series out. I bought it because I'm a fan, but was not very impressed by what I saw. My opinion might change a little after a 2nd viewing, but I am not eager to watch it again.",1407628800,5,1038,4.169154228855722
5646818,4,B00BLQRFRS,decent series!! pretty good.,1405296000,,28,6.25
5646819,3,B00BLQRFRS,"I've been a fan of Appleseed since the B&W comics came out in the 80s.  I liked this series well enough, except that there seems to be a lot of padding.  There are a lot of flashback scenes, some of which are really longer than they need to be to remind you (or fill in new viewers) of the essential background info.  Also, there are lots of artsy little interludes, with images of ancient Greek-style sculptures and paintings.  It feels to me like they just didn't have enough material to fill up the half-hour time slots, so they used these tricks to stretch them out, or to save money by eliminating the need for original artwork.

Aside from that, the series is decent.  It's reasonably faithful to the original stories.  The animation quality is not as good as the movies, but that's to be expected with a series; they don't have the budget of a big-screen production.  And nowadays, with CGI, even low-budget animation can be pretty darn good!  The style here seems more like the original comics than the other movies, which I thought was a nice touch.",1401235200,3,1058,4.555555555555555
5646820,5,B00BLQRFRS,Good story line. Not as good effects...there were some parts of story that needed more explanations . But all in all good.,1395014400,,122,4.590909090909091
5646821,5,B00BLQRFRS,"dame good anime to watch. give A++++, might ti watch again and again. appleseed fans a must see anime!! the best",1392854400,,112,4.380952380952381
5646822,5,B00BLQRFRS,"I had already found and watched Appleseed, and then Appleseed, Ex Machina. I really loved that movie!! And I wanted more of Appleseed, more of the ""universe of Appleseed"" and I wanted it to be just like the movies were. So when I found this; Appleseed XIII: Complete Series Blue Ray, I really wanted to buy it.
But I read all of the reviews about how all of the graphics were ""washed out."" Plus there were other negative points made in most of the reviews, enough made that I kept putting off and putting off buying this series for a couple of months.

None of them, as it turned out, were true... I finally ""overcame"" my doubts, and decided to just ""plunge in"" and buy this Edition. Lol.
I loved it from the moment I started watching the episodes! Let me reassure you that the graphics, or effects, ( I am not familiar with all of the tech lingo here) are very good. Everything is pretty sharp and well done. Of course, the computer graphics are not like the highest super tech stuff that Ex Machina has. But they aren't all washed out as in other Anime editions I have bought. I do have a 47 inch high definition, relatively new, LG backlit LED TV, along with a sound system with 4K Upscaling capacity and a pricey Sony brand Blue Ray player. So when I watch good graphics I can really enjoy all of the efforts that went into any particular movie or series.

The downside to all of that is if what I buy has poor definition, or poor graphics, I can really see the difference on my TV, as half of those 1080X1780? Little ""pixie LEDs or Pixels, or whatever they are called"" simply don't all light up, i think, making for a very grainy viewing experience. This is not the case with this Edition.

Also let me clarify that as I write this review, I am not running around trying to find and get the movie titles themselves, so i can perfectly write them here, nor may I have listed all of the Appleseed Movies made... There may be a third one
Albeit somewhat related to the rest. But since what I am doing, now, is writing a review of the Appleseed XIII: Complete Series ( Limited Edition ) [ Blu-Ray ] I want to let you know that I may have paraphrased the movie titles somewhat, by accident.

As far as the story line is concerned, you will not be displeased with each episode. They are all quite good, well written, and they really expand on the relationship between the 2 main charactors... Each episode is a story of its own, however looked at as a whole, the writers and producers seem to have wanted to place the content within a larger, more universal theme of emotional personal growth, self-sacrifice, human empathy, Hegelian themes of the ever repeating cycles of Thesis + Anti-Thesis = Synthesis  ( and some of that comes to be amid some excellently thrown temper tantrums that really made me laugh in recognition of ...uhmmm..Life Experience )

The episodes keep repeating brief glimpses of Ancient Greek metaphors based on the 12 labors or tasks of Hercules..
That this is the central over-guiding principle that each episode strives to reflect and achieve makes these episodes ever more poignant in my opinion. However these brief glimpses are nothing to overly dwell upon, as some reviewers have indicated. They are simply a few quick background shots. And there is an obvious connection between the 12 labors of Hercules, as it relates quite aptly to the main story line, as well as to the obvious and not so obvious difficulties the two main charactors must face, within the context of their intwined and very deep relationship.
As well as the never ending perils that just ""doing their jobs"" place them into on a daily basis. Truly within these two main themes, their personal lives, their personal relationships, and their daily perilous battles that are the work they have all chosen to do, these all are ""Herculean Feats"" each unto the other....

Enough said, I highly recommend this Blu ray limited edition for everyone who loved the Appleseed and Ex Machina movies and wants to see and watch more of it, as well as see how relationships started and how they have deepened over time. This Series answers a lot of the questions which the movies first addressed. And fills in a lot of the gaps..
The graphics are very good, not washed out, and the soundtrack is excellent.

The episodes are all well written and the action is still there. I really was pleased that I finally just ignored all of the so called ""bad press"" and I bought this Series. I really liked the series. There is much more to it then some people seem to have thought...",1392854400,5,4557,4.535279805352798
5646823,3,B00BLQRFRS,"This television series is a direct continuation of the Appleseed and Applseed ExMachina movies which had been previously released on DVD and Blu ray. The director and producers do a great job of tying in this series with those movies to expand this universe and it's characters but it's not without its faults.

Though the animation (3D rendering) is great and you get some impressive action sequences, the story moves along at a really slow pace and at times was hard to watch.

If you want to watch a scaled down version that concentrates more on the action and plot rather than the character development, which was excruciating, then I would recommend their OVA over the full series anytime. Trust me, you won't miss much.",1389657600,2,725,4.792
5646824,3,B00BLQRFRS,"Then again, I like anime.  Not as good as the movies, but not bad at all.  If you like 'Appleseed', it's worth it.  Just wish that it'd been available in DVD-only packaging.",1388188800,,173,4.34375

5646827,4,B00BLQRFRS,"So, a bit confusing with the psychological and emotional paradigm that shifts thinking in a female brain. . .but now there are 2 to maneuver through.  Human emotions bring so much complexity to the table especially things that drive those emotions like revenge, love, and hatred.  This series shows those conflicts and also continues on the love relationship. . .Normal relationship where the guy is being a guy and the girl is stressing about too much the guy doesn't see.",1378944000,,473,4.9
5646828,4,B00BLQRFRS,The only complaint I have on this set is the fact that this would most likely had been cheaper if there was no dvd's in this set. My question is why even put the dvd disc's in here when the blu ray's have everything that is on the dvd disc's and the bonus features is even in HD so I don't even need the useless dvd's I just wish we could get a option to get them without the dvd's and save some money and space!,1378425600,,412,3.802325581395349

Protection is the main focus of Appleseed  all life is precious!  Romance is tuff to have but super support of each other as a unit is vital or 2 being protective of each other because they have worked together from the very first...  I am so glued to Applessed or hooked on it!  It is daring, adventurous, dangerous, attracting new enemies at every turn that want to kill even human or part Bioroid but it is awesome when Bioroids become even more human and are free to live and love and make their own families...  it is so cool...  at first they do not feel love now they can... it is super!  watch Ajppleseed and Appleseed Exmachina before this Appleseed XIII and see what i mean...  the action just intensifies with every show i watch them over and over so i can find things i miss from all that is happening so fast!",1373587200,,1097,4.262135922330097
5646832,5,B00BLQRFRS,"If you liked the previous releases of Appleseed, you'll _probably_ like this one... but it is a different beast.
The art style more reminiscent of Shirow's actual early comic Manga work, and not the more ""polished"" CG
work of Appleseed EX Machina.

The story is interesting, but they use some static ""art shots"" too often, which at times seems to disrupt the
flow of the animation experience itself.

I've been a fan of Appleseed since I read the first Manga back in the 1980s, so on that basis alone, I liked it.

However, the art/story direction is not as polished as in AEX, but overall it does stand on its own.

English voice acting was fine as well.

Worth picking up if you're a fan of the characters and setting.",1373500800,11,720,4.507692307692308
5646833,4,B00BLQRFRS,"Masamune Shirow, one of my favorite manga artists that I had the opportunity to enjoy his works back when I was a teenager.

Creator of manga hits such as ""Black Magic"", ""Dominion"", ""Ghost in the Shell"", ""Orion"" and also had the opportunity to read the manga and watch the original 1988 OVA series ""Appleseed"".

Although the first Shirow anime I watched was the OVA ""Black Magic M-66, I also had the opportunity to watch the first anime release of ""Appleseed"" and I can easily remember how cerebral the OAV was compared to ""Black Magic M-66 and the two ""Dominion Tank Police"" OVA's.  But if there is one thing that you can expect from Shirow's work is an intelligent story, being created with meticulous detail and a tremendous back story.  Shirow is able to create a world with characters that just amazes me.

Granted, his work that a lot of people outside of Japan are familiar with is ""Ghost in the Shell"", in 2004, all things changed with the release of ""Appleseed"" the movie, a film that brought the world of ""Appleseed"" using new technology and a creative, innovative way to use 3D in a film.  Directed by Shinji Aramaki, a sequel titled ""Appleseed Ex Machina"" was created in 2007.

The main premise of ""Appleseed"" is a problematic world in chaos after a non-nuclear Third World War has decimated Earth in the 22nd Century.  The United States, Great Britain and China are having problems maintaining order, while former LAPD SWAT members Deunan Kute and Briareos Hecantonchires work for the prestigious ES.W.A.T. (Extra Special Weapons and Tactics) in the city of Olympus.  A city in which half of the population are bioroids and shows how Deunan and Briareos are dedicated to protecting their home from their enemies.

But for those wanting storyline exploring how Deunan and Briareos became close as partners, the storyline was never fully explored in an animated version (only in the manga series) until 2011 when the CGI anime adaptation of Masamune Shirow's ""Appleseed XIII"" was aired on television in 2011-2012.  The first 6 episodes were then made into a film titled ""Appleseed XIII: Tartaros"" in June 2011 and a second film based on the final seven episodes  titled ""Appleseed XIII: Ouranos"" was released in October 2011.

The series was directed by Takayuki Hamana (""The Prince of Tennis"", ""Sisters of Wellber"", ""Library War"") and features a screenplay by Jun'ichi Fujisaku (""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex"", ""Real Drive"", ""XxxHOLic the Movie: A Midsummer Night's Dream"").  The music for the animated series was created by Conisch (""Mardock Scramble"" films, ""ToHeart2, ""Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal""), character designs by Takayuki Goto  (""Blue Seed"", ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex"") and art direction by Masanobu Nomura (""The Big O"", ""Blue Exorcist"", ""Gurren Lagann"", ""Ah! My Goddess: The Movie"").

The animated series focuses on a younger Deunan and her relationship with Briareos.  Deunan is a special agent who is in a relationship with Briareos, a veteran cyborg soldier.

She's has a temper and doesn't like how Briareos acts like her father (which she didn't get along with), but Briareos has promised her father and to her, that he would protect her no matter what.  And as the two want to protect Olympus as members of ES.W.A.T., they must deal with a lot of corruption, may it be corporate or political.

But trouble ensues when the city is implementing the Ark Project, a project to preserve the future of human kind but under bioroid supervision.  And as there are humans who have accepted bioroids as part of society, there is another group known as the Human Liberation Front that opposes the project, as they despise anything bioroid.

And because the HLF is tied to a terrorist group known as the Argonauts, trouble begins to take place in the city of Olympus and Deunan and Briareos must do what they can to protect Olympus.

VIDEO:

""Appleseed XIII: Complete Series"" is presented in 1080p High Definition.  While both ""Appleseed"" films raised the bar of what can be accomplished in CG animation during that time, ""Appleseed XIII"" also utilizes CG but in a different style.  Not to say that it's bad because it's a given that a TV series will not have the same animation budget as a film, but there is obviously less detail and the animation can look a bit jerky at times.  From character movements, hair movements, it just reminded me of how animation was back in the mid-to-late '90s at times, while background art was very good.  It takes a while to get used to, but the art backgrounds, mechanical design and are well-done!

Presentation on Blu-ray is clean with no artifacts, slight banding and colors look very good in HD.

AUDIO:

""Appleseed XIII: Complete Series"" is presented in Japanese and English Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  Action scenes showcase very good use of panning for the surround channels and also good use of LFE.  As for voice acting on the Japanese side, you have two veterans involved with the series.  Kouichi Yamadera who had previously done the voice of Briareos (as well as the voice of Spike on ""Cowboy Bebop"", Tenshin han on ""Dragon Ball Z"", Cheese on ""Soreike! Anpanman"".  And you have Maaya Sakamoto doing the voice of Deunan (she also did the voice of Lunamaria Hawke in ""Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny"", Ciel Phantomhive in ""Black Butler""and Aura in the "".Hack"" series).

As for the English dub, it's important to note that the English voice talent for the TV series is different from the films (as original voice talent were not available) but the voice talent featuring David Matranga as Briareos and Luci Christian as Deunan, both did a wonderful job.

Subtitles are in English.

EXTRAS:

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to Masamune Shirow works, one of the experiences that I like to come out of reading or watching his works is the feeling of intellectual storytelling.  Storytelling that captivates you for how cerebral and not worrying if the masses will understand his work or not.

""Appleseed"" is an interesting anime because the storyline of the characters of Deunan and Briareos as members of ES.W.A.T. has been established in the OAV and the two animated films.  We know these two characters are kick ass, no nonsense and literally get the job done, no matter what challenges come their way.

We have seen the corruption of the powerful and we have seen the troubles within society between humans and bioroids.  So, that is an established storyline for those who have followed ""Appleseed"" in the past.

With the success of the two films and so much content from Shirow's manga that have yet to be covered, ""Appleseed XIII"" takes the storyline before those major events and focuses on a young, explosive Deunan and her overprotective boyfriend/cyborg Briareos.

And I have to admit that I was surprised to see the sentimental side between these two characters.  For so long, they have been involved in storylines where your attention is focused on their partnership and taking on criminals but this time around, while the focuses on protecting the city and going after criminals, still continues, we also get to see an emotional side of the characters.

Deunan's lack of a relationship with her father, her stubbornness of being upset at Briareos who wants to protect her.  And to see the two bickering about their relationship, it was not what I was expecting to see. But the fact that this series covers their early relationship, I suppose I never really expected to see this emotional side of either characters.

But I suppose it is necessary to show how these two have evolved as partners but I suppose I never really thought about them in a romantic kind of way considering she is human and he is cyborg.

The storyline between human and bioroids actually made me think of an older anime series titled ""Bubblegum Crisis"" and the hatred between humans and robots trying to co-exist but ""Appleseed XIII"" also explores the positive bond between human and bioroids as well.  I know there have been several stories that explored that tale, but it's interesting to see how this storyline plays out and how it starts to affect Deunan.

As for the anime series, I felt the animation took getting used to.  After watching the beautiful animation of the films, it took a while to get used to the anime production.  Character designs were good but at times were clunky.  From hair movement to body movement, the jerkiness was almost like a trip back to the late '90s of CG animation.  But there are impressive visual moments throughout the film.  Backgrounds were beautiful to look at, fight scenes were impressive and mechanical designs were awesome.

While certain aspects of the film looked amazing on Blu-ray and good use of surround channels and LFE for lossless audio, I was also happy to see the 2 hour and 23 minute featurettes about the making of the series plus the addition of two audio commentaries.

Overall, ""Appleseed XIII"" was a fascinating series and for those who enjoyed the previous OVA or films, it was an interesting look into the background of the protagonists Deunan and Briareos and their earlier relationship as a couple and members of E.S.W.A.T taking on a variety of challenges.  An action-packed anime series with an emotional touch, ""Appleseed XIII"" is recommended!",1372896000,7,10018,4.950329144225015

8570565,1,B00BLQRFRS,"They tore the original premise of Appleseed apart in this series. The foundation and key to the Appleseed plot was Deunan relationship with her scientist mother. Not so here.  Deunan's  mother is of Africa descent, killed by extremists. She hates her father. The character of Deunan has been thoroughly besmirched and is unrecognizable.  I had to go back and watch the original movies to wipe the foul taste out of my mouth.  But wait, they did throw in an extensive amount of animation cheesecake.",1520553600,,498,4.892857142857143
