8271205,1,B0018V2R1A,"This product was marketed as a way to teach french to children.  However, there was no words spoken on the entire DVD. They just grunt and point.  To be completely accurate, there were 5 words spoken in total as a title to each section and then the puppets start to grunt.  No conversation at all!  This was very deceiving!  I tried to return the product and only received my shipping fee back.  I was not reimbursed for the cost of this product.  Save your money! Don't buy it.",1277078400,2,478,4.363636363636363
8271206,5,B0018V2R1A,"I received this DVD as a gift for my eleven month old daughter. She was immediately engaged with the puppets and the children. She mimicked the hedgehog yelling at the honking car, and she hummed to the cow humming and making an outfit. At the end, she stomped her feet to the can can song, trying to dance like the children. This is her favorite DVD compared to ""Your Baby Can Read!"" and ""Baby Einstein."" The other two simply do not hold her attention.

Because of her love of ""Discover France,"" I decided to get Tot Talk ""Globe-Toddlers Adventures in Mexico.""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Globe-Toddlers-Adventures-in-Mexico-DVD/dp/B0017IANI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Globe-Toddlers Adventures in Mexico! DVD</a>&nbsp;I ordered the DVD/CD set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Globe-Toddlers-Adventures-in-Mexico-CD/dp/B0017IANII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Globe-Toddlers Adventures in Mexico CD</a>so I could play the music in the car as well. At thirteen months old, my daughter tries to sing along with the children on the CD. She claps when she sees the baby clapping in the very beginning of the DVD, and she imitates sounds of the puppets throughout the DVD.

For each DVD, my daughter recognizes the Tot Talk theme song and dances to it, swaying her hips side to side and smiling. I highly recommend this for your own child and as a gift!",1269302400,,1430,5.970731707317073
8271207,5,B0018V2R1A,"My nine month old son loved watching this video!  The use of children to
present the different topics really interested him.  For example, kids show different clothing outfits during a ""French"" fashion show.  They are also shown eating croissants, petting and milking goats, and chasing seagulls on a beach.  He was entertained throughout by the kids and their actions.  My son loved the cute puppets and laughed each time he saw them.

The video moved along at a good pace introducing different topics.  There
was never a dull moment, rather it was exciting and engaged both of us.

I loved the music in the video!  It enhanced the visual experience, and I
liked that it introduced my son to classical music and other famous French
children's songs.

I also really liked the live footage.  I learned about how cheese is made
while watching the video.  The process was shown from beginning to the end
starting with the milking of a goat.  To enhance the video watching
experience, I would provide additional commentary for my son.  The
experience was fun as we watched and learned together.

This video can be viewed in English or French. My son and I will be watching and learning from this video for years to come.",1219536000,,1216,4.723809523809524
8271208,5,B0018V2R1A,"My 1 and 4 year old both LOVE this DVD.  I hear them repeat words during and after the DVD. They love the music and especially the Can Can at the end.  They find the puppets amusing but also enjoy the little kids.  It is fun and engaging and they watch it throughout and ask for it again and again, over all the other DVDs we have for kids.  I highly recommend this for anyone seeking a vocabulary builder in English or French or both and for a DVD that they can be sure their kids will want to watch again.",1212105600,,507,3.99009900990099
