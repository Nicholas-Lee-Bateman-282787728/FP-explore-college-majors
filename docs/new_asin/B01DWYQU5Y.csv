7725461,5,B01DWYQU5Y,Finally received Survivor: Caramoan and I'm so happy. It's actually playing on my outdated DVD player and is every bit as good as I remember from when it was on TV. This is one I will watch again and again.,1489881600,8,206,4.175
7725462,4,B01DWYQU5Y,"I am a big Survivor fan, pretty much from the beginning. So it was thus incumbent upon me to buy the seasons as they became available on DVD, even the marginal ones.. Which leads me to posit the question, if this season, (as well as seasons 27-31) are avialable for pre-order and are manufactured on demand on a DVD-R basis, when is Amazon going to get up off their dead ass and release these? The new season has just started, so now would be a perfect time. What the hell are you waiting for?

And by the way, this was a good, but not perfect season, hence the 4 stars.",1489449600,12,570,4.181818181818182
7725463,1,B01DWYQU5Y,"So yeah. As a fan the finale was crap, they did the post merdge players really dirty, didn't even put them on stage. And to add insult to injury, they didn't put any of them of the cover. I am buying this season only because it will add to my collection and one of the fans that played this season is a friend of mine and is from my home town. #fansmatter",1483056000,,355,3.9444444444444446

7725465,5,B01DWYQU5Y,"Bad pre-merge, epic post-merge.  Caramoan is a little lopsided, but it is a lot of fun!",1460160000,2,87,4.4375
7725466,5,B01DWYQU5Y,This season is really crazy. Gathers a bunch of the funny or goofy players that have played before and put them against fans. If you enjoyed Philip and Cochran on their first seasons then you'll love this. Personally I love this season but the humor is not for everyone I'm sure. Also corrine seems to be a completely different person in this game lol but overall great season and deserving winner that never in a million years thought I would see,1460160000,,447,4.530864197530864
7725467,1,B01DWYQU5Y,Ok season. ok cover. Amazon could make this cover better by switching phillip with eddie or reynold or sherri. the fans deserve at least 1 person on the cover,1460160000,3,158,4.482758620689655

7725471,5,B01DWYQU5Y,"excellent season! very happy with the dvd's...the 5 stars are for the show and dvd quality. my only complaint is how long it takes to release....i learned a couple of years ago not to pay and wait a year or more for release. this time just waited til it was in stock and not on pre-order (i mean seriously, pre-order should be a few weeks ahead, no more than a month).",1509926400,,368,4.197183098591549
7725472,1,B01DWYQU5Y,"In the past, I've been very happy with every season of Survivor I've bought.  Unfortunately, that's not the case this time.  5 of the 6 discs are perfect, but the company that put this together didn't bother putting anything on Disc #4!  The disc is completely blank while all the other discs are great.  I'm not sure if anyone else is having this same problem or I was just ""lucky"" enough to get a bad disc!?  I'm not sure what to do about this since I don't usually have problems with things bought online?  I am curious to know if this is a problem for anyone else who purchased Season 26 of Survivor?",1509667200,,604,4.300884955752212
7725473,5,B01DWYQU5Y,"Where is the Blu-ray? I just ordered Seasons 27 and 28 on Blu-ray and that is awesome but it says season 26 is yet to be released on Blu-ray but it was just released on DVD. Also, where are seasons 22 & 23 on Blu-ray? I have seasons 24 & 25 on Blu-ray and love them. Release the other Blu-rays please!",1509580800,,301,3.9508196721311477

7725476,5,B01DWYQU5Y,"5 stars for the three amigos blind side, one of the best tribals ever. Seeing the show again, reminded me about Brenda's kindness and Renynold's amazing run in challenges.  It took so long for this season to be released, not surprised so many people gave poor rating.

Actually a very good season!.",1499212800,,298,4.711538461538462

7725478,1,B01DWYQU5Y,"I would give it 4 or 5 stars if it was released.

My friends used to laugh at me for still having my VCR, and for recording each and every episode of Survivor on tape. I only tape over them after I get the DVDs. But since the past Survivor seasons' DVDs are never being released, I am thankful I have been able to rewatch all the recent Survivor series on video. Including having Survivor viewing parties with my friends - who are not laughing anymore. It is truly ridiculous how long these series DVDs have been in pre-release status!!

Edited to add: These DVDs are for Season 26, which aired on TV in Spring, 2013.  It is now Fall, 2017, 4 1/2 years since this series aired on TV.  Give us a break and issue these DVDs already. Please. Or tell us what is the problem?",1494633600,11,770,4.217687074829932
