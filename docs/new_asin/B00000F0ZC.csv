7906525,4,B00000F0ZC,"The footage and stills presented are very interesting, as are the interviews, but it leaves out important events that comprise the Battle of the Bulge.  It begins well, reporting the debacle of the 106th Infantry on the Schnee Eifel east of St. Vith (although they do not tell you that is where it happened).  In fact, there are few maps to put the events into perspective (except for one interviewee pointing out things on a country map - not very helpful).  It then focuses on Bastogne, Patton's relief, the weather, and the reduction of the Bulge.  Only one line of the narrative reports SS atrocities, identifying Belgium civilians killed at Stavelot but not American soldiers massacred at Malmedy (remember, this is the American experience).  Nothing is said of Kampfgruppe Pieper and the Northern thrust, nor the heroic stand made by American support personnel at the Elsenborn Ridge against Dietrich's Sixth Panzer Army.  I gave it four stars for the footage and interviews, but if you really want to learn about the Battle of the Bulge, buy MacDonald's ""A Time for Trumpets"" (available at Amazon.com).",1053561600,25,1109,5.0
7906526,4,B00000F0ZC,"One of the best documentaries made on the Battle of the Bulge.  Historic camera footage is matched with contemporary views of the same (or similar) sites.  Numerous interviews with the veterans who were actually there.  The video is also packed with information about the state of the US Army before, during, and after the battle.  This video is best viewed by students of this great battle and by those who know nothing at all about the last gasp Ardennes Offensive.  For everyone else, the documentary could be a bit confusing as the film drifts from straight chronological event descriptions and there are few maps offerred. Available in both VHS and CD, this is the movie to get if you want the true story of the Battle of the Bulge.",979516800,12,737,4.682170542635659
7906527,5,B00000F0ZC,"I highly recommend this DVD to you.  There is a lot of first person narative and excellent actual footage.
It begins to give you a very good sense of what those brave men went through to assure our liberty.
When you are done viewing it you will want to take a vet to dinner.",978566400,6,274,4.074074074074074
7906528,5,B00000F0ZC,"As an U.S. Army officer currently serving in Europe and an avid WWII history buff, this video brings to life the horrors of what really happened  here 56 years ago.  Having travelled extensively through the Ardennes  researching the battle, todays serenity of these picturesque little towns  and villages belies the utter savagery that took place there.  As the  previous reviewer stated, this is not the Henry Fonda movie.  However, this  is the best documentary on the Battle of the Bulge I have seen to date!  I  highly recommend it.",966729600,28,536,4.921348314606742
