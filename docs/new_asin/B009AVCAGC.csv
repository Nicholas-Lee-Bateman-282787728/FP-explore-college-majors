5310545,5,B009AVCAGC,Ms. Fonda is a very good teacher - wish she would tell me what to do all day about everything.  Sound quality and production of video is perfect.  I have never done yoga and this was simple to follow and I wanted to do the whole video.  I look forward to it every morning.,1354924800,176,272,4.0
5310586,5,B009AVCAGC,like this have tried to do yoga before lost interest this is keeping me interested seems good for seniors and beginners would recommend,1504742400,,135,4.913043478260869
5310587,5,B009AVCAGC,I am very happy with this DVD. I feel much better doing this. I enjoy doing each segment.,1504656000,,89,4.0
5310588,2,B009AVCAGC,"This might be a good yoga program for elderly or frail persons, but is way too beginner-ish for me (age 60, somewhat fit/with health and strength challenges).  I might have liked it better if I could have gotten the balance exercise section to work, but it won't play and Amazon tells me I missed my window of opportunity to return the video.  (It took me 3 weeks to get around to trying out the DVD. Oh well.)",1503792000,,410,4.311688311688312
5310589,5,B009AVCAGC,Have only been doing it a few weeks but I love it...She is awesome and I am sorry I didn't get this year's ago.,1502064000,,111,3.6666666666666665

5310592,5,B009AVCAGC,"As I am still a beginner at yoga, I have say this is a terrific way to learn the basics. Easy to follow and progress in the various work outs. I highly recommend this if you'd like to try yoga and not feel like a failure.",1493683200,,221,3.8260869565217392
5310593,5,B009AVCAGC,Great price & fast shipping.,1492905600,,28,4.8
5310594,5,B009AVCAGC,Love the short routines and Jane is very clear with her instructions.,1491609600,,69,4.833333333333333
5310595,5,B009AVCAGC,"This video is great. Has a variety of yoga-type programs. Really helped my back. Good for strengthening, too.",1490400000,,109,5.111111111111111
5310616,4,B009AVCAGC,"Bought as a gift.  Feedback is positive.  Easy movements for beginners and elders. Jane Fonda is an actress.  So this video is kind of motivation, not a pro-yoga series.  Enjoy these exercises.",1490140800,3,193,4.9375
5310617,5,B009AVCAGC,Well done video with amazingly fit Jane Fonda.  She does a fairly good job as a yoga instructor but lacks a bit on telling you to inhale and exhale and some other cues like right and left.  It's nice to see that she has normal sized people in back of her also doing her routine.  It's easy to pick which practice you want as you pick am or pm and then which practice you want to pursue.  Time is told to you by Fonda.  This could easily come to be one of my favorite workout DVDs when I have to miss class or am looking for an extra workout.,1489104000,4,541,3.926605504587156

5310623,5,B009AVCAGC,"Yoga is my least favorite type of exercise and I usually avoid it at all possible costs.  That being said, I alway found the various pose positions difficult to manage in the brief time allotted by the instructor before going on to the next pose. That was not the case with the Jane Fonda video.  I found her to be thorough  and patient with easy to follow instructions with more emphasis on proper form rather quantity.  Now I  find myself grabbing her video when I need a break from my normal exercise routine.",1486425600,9,512,4.462365591397849
5310624,5,B009AVCAGC,Love this program. It is challenging and I like it because it is. One can pace oneself. Best: Do it in its segments and not all in one time until one gets a feel of how to do the poses. I am 72 and this yoga  video integrates well with the other different programs that I do with Jane Fonda's Videos and others. I am very happy that I bought it.,1486166400,,345,3.859154929577465

5310626,5,B009AVCAGC,"Years ago, I did aerobics to a Jane Fonda audio cassette. Now, she's produced a wonderful yoga routine that's perfect not only for older ladies, but for anyone. The moves can be followed easily, yet are intensely healing. Her charming presence lights up your day. Jane is back and better than ever! (We also love her Netflix series with Lily Tomlin.) Thank you, Ms. Fonda.",1484870400,,372,4.7384615384615385

5310686,5,B009AVCAGC,"In the '80's I went for 'the burn' with Jane Fonda's ORIGINAL workout on VHS and self-inflicted damage on my body by pushing beyond my edge.

At the age of 59, I finally learned NOT to go over my edge and at 62 I am very happy to be practicing ""AM/PM YOGA for Beginners"" and hoping that Jane will next lead a Yoga Intermediate Level for Baby Boomers!

5310688,5,B009AVCAGC,"When I started doing this wonderful DVD, I was recovering from debilitating back trouble. Jane Fonda gave me a great place to start getting fit again. I am stronger and have better balance because I have done this DVD. I still do it from time to time as my easier workout, and I am so grateful that I was able to get my strength back doing this routine.",1465948800,,353,4.205882352941177
5310689,5,B009AVCAGC,Have always loved Jane Fonda workout videos and the yoga DVD is no exception. It is quickly becoming my favorite! The asanas are great for all levels and can fit into any schedule!,1465689600,,180,4.484848484848484
5310690,5,B009AVCAGC,"I was diagnosed with MS about 12 years ago and I've been using Jane's Yoga workout to help with my balance and strength.  I do the entire workout all at once instead of breaking it up.  I absolutely love this workout program that she has come up with.  I used to have one of her Pilates albums when I was younger so when I was looking for a good Yoga workout, I found it here.",1465257600,,376,3.986666666666667

5310695,5,B009AVCAGC,Love it,1462406400,,7,3.0
5310696,5,B009AVCAGC,"I grew up with Jane Fonda's original workout videos and am very happy with the way her exercise routines have evolved in this Prime Time series, which seems aimed specifically at the Boomer generation, but is still challenging.
I have used this Yoga video specifically to increase  flexibility, which has really helped with my neck stiffness and pain (and incidentally helped me look over my shoulder while backing a car). There are also sections aimed at improving balance and increasing strength.  The use of a class format for the video makes you feel like you are participating in a real class and gives you a sense that you are not the only one who sometimes struggles a little. I had tried a local Yoga studio before this and could never seem to get through to the instructor that I wasn't as flexible as her.

Other great videos in the series are Firm & Burn (aerobics) and the Trim, Tone and Flex (muscle strength).",1461974400,3,923,4.6503067484662575

5310701,3,B009AVCAGC,"I would have given this 5 stars because she's great but teh way it was filmed...they do so many different angles it's hard to follow her.  sometimes its on her, sometimes on top of her, something panning the class. It's ridiculous if you are trying to follow along.  whoever filmed it was trying to be creative and missed the fact that people are trying to follow along.

The price is right-very cheap!",1435017600,,356,4.173913043478261
5310764,5,B009AVCAGC,"Excellent dvd! I bought Jane's first aerobics video 20+ years ago when I was around 40. As I did the video with her, I almost felt like her personal friend, because she was so natural and friendly. I can still hear her voice in my head when I am doing certain stretches. Now that I am 61 I decided to try out some yoga. I don't like the ""religious"" aspect of yoga, so I was very happy when I watched this dvd to find that Jane doesn't go into all of that. Her poses and stretches and strength exercises are pretty easy, yet a little challenging after 20 minutes, which is good. I did all 3 ""A.M."" segments, each 10 minutes long. By the end, I felt stretched, relaxed, and ready to go. I do Zumba twice a week, some weights, and a lot of walking. This dvd adds a new dimension to my work outs. Easy to follow, real-looking women behind Jane (who is amazingly beautiful for her age!) nice production quality. Even the background music is lovely to listen to. Highly recommend.",1434672000,,974,4.298913043478261

I hate feeling out of breath when I work out, but I love to feel like I am working different muscles. This does just that. She combines traditional workout with yoga so that you focus on your breathing while shaping up your body. The PM yoga is very relaxing and provides me with a more restful, deeper nights sleep!",1434326400,,492,4.24468085106383

The stretches in this video helped a great deal. I liked that it has useful stretches, muscle toning, and balance building it has.  Jane also does a good job explaining the muscles and stretches and how the body works and since she has had hip/knee replacements, she has plenty of modifications for people that have physical limitations.",1427414400,,472,4.875

5310819,2,B009AVCAGC,"Ugh - I wish I'd read the negative reviews before ordering this. Be aware that these routines barely resemble yoga at all - it's like Jane was trying to capitalize on the whole yoga thing and slapped a big ""YOGA"" label on a DVD that's basically a bunch of stretches with the occasional yoga-esque pose thrown in to make it seem legit. Well, it's not. The routines are too short and every move feels rushed - the opposite of how yoga should be practiced. Little to no emphasis is placed on breathing - she mentions it occasionally, but it feels like an afterthought and, again, I suspect it was done only to add legitimacy to the 'yoga' claim. There are numerous better beginner yoga videos out there that are actually yoga. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money or time on this watered-down drill-sergeant mishmash.

Jane is a woman who I've admired for some time now for her commitment to live a healthy lifestyle.  Some of the techniques she uses in this video are things that I've never seen before.  She gives you a couple of options (which all instructors should) of modifying the poses if you are at a beginner or intermediate level.  Its also great because it is broken down into small segments, if you just don't have a whole hour to commit to a workout.  You can do a few poses and your on your way!",1412467200,,689,4.1893939393939394

5310885,5,B009AVCAGC,"This is the perfect beginner DVD for me! I'm in my 50's and I'm in the process of taking off weight and learning golf. I have aches around my ribs, arms, shoulders and neck from golf. The first 2 AM programs (ABS & BACK, ENERGY) are excellent for all of those areas. Jane is teaching us to use our abdominal muscles. As always, Jane knows exactly when to remind us to breathe, and to do other things. She makes sure we're in the right positions at all times. Her instructions are perfect. The one thing I've added to the Abs & Back program is to use yoga blocks to place my hands on, instead of using a towel or not using anything. This helps me a lot. The PM programs are also good. I prefer the second one, Relaxation, because my chair isn't wide enough for my comfort. This DVD feels very Zen-like. There isn't any rushing from one position to another. Jane takes her time, which is relaxing and helpful. It's a wonderful way to stretch out all of the kinks in the morning, plus learning to be mindful of the way we breathe and the way we use our abdominal muscles. I didn't use this for the last 2 weeks (while going to the driving range almost daily). Now I will use the two AM programs before I go to the driving range!

Definitely not for someone who exercises regularly and takes yoga classes, but it's good for seniors and the likes of me who are injured and need to be careful.

5310990,5,B009AVCAGC,This was my first exercise when I started gaining strength back from Cancer. It is fun and gives you a work out that  for a 65 year old who was active before cancer  can also be active after it. I have gone on to also do Jane Fonda's Firm and Burn...Love both these videos..I am feeling fit and healthy...,1397433600,,305,4.1525423728813555
5310991,5,B009AVCAGC,"For beginner or intermediate, with clear instructions at a comfortable pace.  I certainly feel better after using this yoga routine.",1397260800,,132,5.6

5310993,5,B009AVCAGC,Love it! I'm 51 and trying to get back into shape. I have chronic neck and back pain. Felt so rejuvenated after doing this DVD.,1396656000,,127,4.12
5310994,5,B009AVCAGC,Positions were easy to follow. Instructions were clear. The workout was not to long but not too short either. I would recommend for a beginner.,1396656000,,143,4.76
5310995,5,B009AVCAGC,Great for beginners with some updated moves that will enhance the workouts for intermediates as well.  Some routines incorporate weights for added benefit to tone and strength.,1396569600,,176,5.518518518518518
5310996,1,B009AVCAGC,"I didn't like it, the moves were too quick and sloppy and she didn't concentrate on breathing with the moves",1395878400,7,108,4.45
5310997,3,B009AVCAGC,"I is a good beginner video, but it is too slow moving.  Too much talk between exercises.  If she would explain it in one session and then do a complete, faster-moving session, it would be much better.",1395619200,,200,4.378378378378378
5310998,2,B009AVCAGC,"I was disappointed with the yoga CD.  I know it is for beginners, but it was too basic, very easy and not long enough for a good stretch.",1395273600,,137,3.892857142857143
5310999,5,B009AVCAGC,"I have a lot of health problems including fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis and other mobility issues.  I tried a couple of the other beginner yoga videos that prime offers and was very surprised how much I LOVED Jane Fonda's yoga for beginners.  She really does start you out slow, and explains every single move so that you understand it, but not so much that it moves too slowly.  She reminds  you about your breathing (my issue) throughout the different poses/movements which is fantastic.

I've found other videos where the instructors speak SO quietly and slowly that I found myself getting sleepy and bored.  NOT what I was looking for!!

I also love that there are several different varieties of Yoga on this video.  So far I've found the morning workout to be the most beneficial.  I worked up to the hand weights today, and that is just a little bit harder for those of us with a bad knee....but the great thing is you do this at home, and you do it at your own speed and you only do what you can do!

When using videos of this sort in the past I have found myself losing interest quickly.  That hasn't happened with this video and my body is starting to realize that yeah, yoga really can help my creaky, not so old, sore and painful body.  After only a few days I'm starting to really loosen up and find myself standing taller!

Thank you Ms Fonda for giving us such a great workout and realizing that just because we're beginners doesn't mean we're slow to catch on, but....we do still need you to go at the right speed.  You've done it perfectly!!  My body is thanking you!!",1395187200,2,1586,4.458333333333333
5311000,5,B009AVCAGC,This is a great yoga tape. I like waking up in the morning to the tape. Jane is always so encouraging. She makes you feel as if you are in the same room with her.,1394755200,,162,3.657142857142857
5311001,5,B009AVCAGC,Great morning and night stretches and movements. She gives very clear instructions. Great workout. It's a great way to do yoga on your own.,1394668800,,139,4.833333333333333
5311002,1,B009AVCAGC,I was just looking through items on amazon and suddenly I see that I have purchased this video in my e-mail and can not return iteven within minutes.  I'm disappointed that Amazon would do such a thingaccidentally browsing and not able to correct the mistakeI use Amazon a lot and will have to rethink it,1394668800,2,304,4.527272727272727
5311003,5,B009AVCAGC,Jane's tape is so easy to follow and it is not hard. I have enjoyed doing her tape. And am thinking of buying the tape so I have it to play on my tv.,1394582400,,149,3.411764705882353

5311005,5,B009AVCAGC,"This video is perfect for the beginning Yoga enthusiast, or someone like me, 58 years young and needed something effective, but slower and not too challenging.  I like that there are three separate segments, and if you are in a hurry, you can do just one, two, or all three.  The PM section is perfect for winding down at the end of the day, and the guided relaxation is an added bonus.  Jane is a class act.",1394150400,,408,4.2727272727272725
5311006,2,B009AVCAGC,"This was a disappointment. Way too many people all doing their own thing whileJane is trying her best to assure us she really knows yoga like she knew aerobics. Sorry but I am totally happy with Rodney Yee, who truly is an experienced yoga instructor. If one is looking for a wonderful yoga class on dvd, in my opinion this is not the dvd you want.",1394064000,,348,4.287878787878788
5311007,2,B009AVCAGC,"Not that good for someone even remotely into yogo. If you've even done stretches before you can swimmingly do these exercises. Wish it covered some better moves and had less of a ""yogo for old folks"" feel.",1393891200,,205,4.5675675675675675
5311018,4,B009AVCAGC,This is a great workout for older women.  It allows you to acquire flexibility and strength without stressing your body.,1393804800,,120,5.0
5311019,5,B009AVCAGC,"Jane Fonda has done an excellent job on this yoga dvd.  She never ceases to amaze me, in her physical skills, teaching abilities, and quality production. Yoga has been part of my life for many years.  I wanted to try this dvd, since I'm not so young anymore and I want to move into the positions more carefully. I found these routines very enjoyable.",1393632000,,350,4.453125

5311021,5,B009AVCAGC,"I love this beyond belief.  Not for babies... Beginner, yes, but a 'healthy and somewhat 'fit' beginner.'  Been doing Jane since the 80's no way to beat any of her workouts.  They are the real deal.  And, so gentle to the body, mind and spirit.  Her voice is so soothing I wish she would do a relaxation, meditation CD.  Love her!",1393200000,,330,4.327868852459017
5311022,3,B009AVCAGC,"I have her  yoga video from 1995, which BTW I really, really love, and was hoping that this would be an extension of the first.  I forgot that she is nearly 20 years older and aiming for the beginners club.  She is a thoughtful, kind trainer, and I love JF, just not this workout.  I put it in our donation bag after viewing it once.  For those of you who have never tried Yoga or the poses, this would be very good for you.  She has a way of inviting you to want more.  It just wasn't right for me.",1393200000,,499,3.93
5311023,5,B009AVCAGC,JANE RELATES TO OUR AGE GROUP. SIMPLY MOVES THAT WORK. WOULD RECOMMEND THIS VIDEO.  I HAVE ALL THE OTHER VIDEOS FROM JANE's Collection and rate those 4star also.,1392940800,,161,4.75

5311033,5,B009AVCAGC,"Love to have a Yoga program for the mature woman, and this is it!!! I must admit I am a huge fan of Jane Fonda and have been for over 40 years, and I am very happy that she is doing something for us older girls. But I'm elated that she is encouraging us that older can for sure be better!",1391904000,,288,3.737704918032787
5311034,4,B009AVCAGC,"Fonda does a good job and accomplishes providing a good demonstration of beginning yoga.  The four star rating is applicable to my interest only.  I am not a yoga buff, prefering workouts at a health spa, i.e. treadmills, bicycle, weight machines, etc.  I'm just saying that my giving yoga a try by viewing this DVD, I discovered that yoga is not for me.  To those who are interested in getting into yoga, this is probably as good as any DVD to satisfy you.",1391644800,,457,4.469879518072289
5311035,5,B009AVCAGC,Love it. Great for beginners or when you want a traditional (less aerobic) type of practice. My go-to practice on a low energy day. Jane's approach reminds me very much of my first yoga instructor.,1391385600,,197,4.6571428571428575
5311036,5,B009AVCAGC,was very pleased. great starter instructions . Again Jane Fonda nails it. Perfect for getting started and those finding it hard to move.,1391299200,,136,4.956521739130435

5311046,5,B009AVCAGC,"I'm at that stage in life where flexibility and balance are very important. I've never worked out using a Yoga routine, knew it was time, but was a little intimidated by the thought. This workout with Jane Fonda was just what I was looking for. It's simple enough, yet works to strengthen core muscles, improve balance, improve breathing techniques. It's a workout, but at the end of the routine you're not exhausted but refreshed.",1391212800,2,431,4.837837837837838

5311050,4,B009AVCAGC,"I had been neglecting the stretch part of my workouts until I discovered I was suffering from back,leg and neck stiffness.  This routine is great for gently giving me relief.  I suspect it won't satisfy me for long and I will be looking for something more challenging but I will have it for those days I want to go easy on myself.",1390867200,,330,4.306451612903226
5311051,5,B009AVCAGC,"I really do enjoy this DVD.  I use this in conjunction with aerobic DVD and find the whole combination works well for me to start out each day.  I also enjoy the evening part and it really does relax you, and sets the body for going to sleep",1390435200,,241,4.0
5311052,5,B009AVCAGC,"Let me preface this by saying that I'm nearly 43, 5 foot 6 inches, and about 35 pounds over where I should be. I'm strong, but not really fit and flexible, and I prefer working out at home. After a lot of experimenting, this is my weekly routine:

M,W,F: I do the Jane Fonda Walk Out--the WHOLE thing. It takes about 50 minutes, I recommend snug workout pants. You need to wear running/walking/tennis shoes and have a sturdy chair with no arms available. By the time I'm done I feel sweaty, but great. Not sore, but like I've really done my body a favor.

T, TH, Sat: I do the Trim, Tone & Flex video. You need some basic hand weights (I'm on only 2 lbs right now,) and a sturdy chair. Wear shoes.

Sunday morning: I do the AM part (the first 3 sections) of the Jane Fonda AM/PM Yoga. It is a great way to begin the day on a Sunday. You'll need a mat and hand weights.

EVERY evening, before bed: I do the PM part (the last 2 sections, and often the balance section, which is only 5 minutes.)

I haven't seen a lot of progress on the scale, but I feel amazing. I can tell the difference in my energy level, my posture, and the quality of my sleep. I love the fact that I don't leave the morning workouts feeling sore and unmotivated to do them again. On the contrary, I wake up looking forward to doing them!

The Jillian Michaels workouts are too much for me at this point and I don't like her attitude. Denise Austin is way too perky for me and I get too sore. TRY THIS COMBO. I've been doing it diligently for 9 straight days now and I feel SO much better!",1390176000,10,1559,4.1118421052631575

5311054,5,B009AVCAGC,Excellent alternative poses for those with less flexibility.  Easy to keep pace with the instructor.  Video streams well.  Strongly recommend,1389657600,,141,5.95
5311055,5,B009AVCAGC,She made this very easy and personal. Yoga is hard for me but she talked me through it. I loved it.,1389398400,,99,3.761904761904762

5311061,2,B009AVCAGC,"I've been doing yoga for many years (on and off) and I was really looking forward to trying out this DVD by Jane Fonda. I LOVE her Prime Time series, walking and strength training DVDs and use them on a regular basis. But I did not like this yoga dvd.

I guess for someone who has never done yoga before, is just starting out with yoga or who is in poor physical condition, it might be ok. I wouldn't even classify most of these routines AS yoga, more like just stretching exercises, not actual yoga poses.

I would recommend the ""Larry Payne Prime of Life"" yoga series, that includes DVDs for beginners and more advanced yoga participants and is geared for people over 40 in particular. That is a DVD series that I use on a regular basis and it's excellent.

I do have an old VHS copy of Jane's first yoga DVD and I still like that one. It is much better than this newer version.",1387238400,3,880,4.25748502994012

I did the entire am/pm routine in one session.  I had no problem with any of the moves but gosh, at the end of it, I felt worked out from head to toe.
I always have to modify sitting on my heels to sitting more comfortably...and I did on this one also, but that is the only change I had to make.
I am 61 and have lots of herniated disks, carpal tunnel, and poly osteo arthritis.  Jane Fonda has an artificial hip and knee...so she knows what I need!",1386979200,,619,4.133333333333334

5311065,4,B009AVCAGC,"I have several of Jane's new work-out DVD's and enjoy them all.  I like that she has others doing the work-out with her with one doing either an easier version or more difficult.  Jane explains the exercises well and if I can't do one exercise I do something else until she goes onto the next one.  I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and neck and lower back problems but working out to her DVD's really help.  I would definitely recommend especially to older, more sedentary people looking to do some sort of exercise.",1385942400,,511,4.582417582417582
5311076,3,B009AVCAGC,"Jane Fonda exercise videos are always well produced and thought out but for me it is just not yoga.  It is using a few yoga poses but there is not nearly enough yoga breathing, meditation, or sequencing and no savasana at the end. It is not really a yoga dvd but it was well done for what it was.",1385164800,,296,4.016949152542373

years of dance experience so the lessons are pretty basic for me and I was expecting something a little more challenging.
I would definitely order another from her if she had something for the more experienced exerciser.  I was quite skeptical at
the beginning since I had never tried Yoga before and it does relax you and get rid of stress and makes you realize all the
stress one holds in their shoulders and stomach.  I really liked the ham-string stretches and the deep breathing.  It sure beats
drinking or eating too much.",1379980800,,651,4.52991452991453

There are 3  AM videos and 2 PM videos, along with a bonus balance session. Jane is in her 70's now and she emphasizes that learning to balance is extremely important for anyone over 50 to practice.
The videos are broken down into 15 minutes or less. First session is abs and back, second is energy and overall strength. The third one is vitality and includes weights (but Jane says you can use water bottles if you don't have weights). I personally use 5 and 8 pounders depending on the intensity of the workout.
These are all yoga moves and do seem to energize the viewer. I felt the stretches were just right, and Jane gives the option of listening to her explain the moves (which I found helpful) or listen to music. I have not done the PM yoga yet but look forward to trying it soon and am sure it will deliver as promised.",1378857600,3,954,4.3
5311101,3,B009AVCAGC,"This video is fine, just didn't fall in love with it.  I enjoy doing yoga but for me the instructor means a lot and JF can't beat Rodney Yee.

5311102,3,B009AVCAGC,"Fonda had a nice demeanor on the instructional DVD, a very calming voice.  However it is way too basic for anyone who has taken some yoga studio instruction before.  I read some favorable reviews, and had just stared Iyengar yoga at a studio and thought it would be nice for some home instruction to follow too.  Sadly I was already past its level, even though I am 60+, not in great shape (that is why I took up yoga) and overweight.  It's okay if you just want mellow breathing and simple small moves.",1378425600,4,503,4.376344086021505
5311103,4,B009AVCAGC,"I like this workout with Jane because it isn't too ""bendy"" and doesn't require great physical flexibility like many others I have previewed. I have disability and can't do it so well so this is perfect for me. Jane guides you through the movements and placement while reminding to breathe, which is important for yoga. I do all three workouts every other day and I can feel it in my energy and strength after every workout!

I recommend this CD for anyone who has limited ability but wants to keep what they have.",1377993600,2,513,4.516129032258065

5311116,1,B009AVCAGC,"I can't recommend this video more to those people who enjoy working out and spitting in the faces of veterans of the Vietnam war. Miss Fonda gives step by step instructions on how to look POWs eye to eye and call them hypocrites and liars. She then steps up the workout and shows how to sit in an anti-aircraft gun and pretend to shoot down American planes.

But she isn't done yet, she shows you how to pretend to be an American and never apologize to our soldiers.

So if want to buy a product that both disgraces American soldiers who were drafted into a war they had no choice in fighting in as well as support a treasonous bitch, please buy this!",1377648000,4,651,4.284552845528455

5311120,3,B009AVCAGC,"Jane just can't seem to get across that she believes all the new agey jargon that she's offering. Her presence is stiff and awkward.  That in itself wouldn't be so bad if she were a better instructor, but she just doesn't have it in her.

Beginners need clear and precise instruction on body placement and breathing before they can confidently take on a particular movement or exercise. She assumes too much, and offers too little. I was very disappointed.

For great beginners instruction try Mari Winsor 20 Minute Pilates or try Mariel Hemingway and Rodney Yee Am/Pm Yoga. Both are far superior and enjoyable.

Jane's DVD will be going out as an offering to the local library fundraiser.",1377302400,2,689,4.813559322033898

I like the simplicity of the movements, her calming voice, and the entire feel of the production. Very settling and gentle. She is accompanied by a few other 60-70ish women.
There are varying routines, for different times of the day. She has done a great job on this! Well worth the purchase.",1376956800,5,470,4.413793103448276

I was disappointed in that the names of positions, and slow practice of these positions were not included.  Ms. Fonda just went right into it as though we already knew the terms..  I had no idea what the mountain pose was etc and would have liked to have practiced these poses before jumping into the stretches.",1374796800,2,445,4.525

5311127,5,B009AVCAGC,The routine moves slow so you have time to do the exercise correctly.  If you are out of shape or older this is a great way to get back into exercising again.  There are several small routines that you can do all at once or do one each day.  I have several Jane Fonda exercise dvd's and she always does a good job explaining the exercise and moving at the approiate speed.  If you work out regularly and are in hard body shape this is not the dvd for you.,1374105600,,455,4.022222222222222

There are several people performing the exercises and I can do the more challenging positions when I am limber. At other times I choose the more basic form of the pose. The sections are fairly short and you can opt to work with verbal instruction, so just follow along. This is a great home fitness tool.",1373068800,,395,4.2105263157894735

5311135,4,B009AVCAGC,"I enjoy this when I'm sore from other workouts or simply too tired for much else. And, I enjoy it in the evening at times. But, as another reviewer says, I find it far too slow for me. I do Ashtanga Yoga, which is fast and flowing. So this seems far too slow. But, it's marketed to beginners and that's ok.

Fonda does a decent job of instructions. She's calming and relaxing as one would expect from a 75-year-old. Some of the exercises are really very good like the plank on a chair. I can hold a plank on the floor 90 seconds and find the plank on the chair every bit as challenging. And none of the exercises will likely hurt anyone and that's important, especially for older people and beginners. Yoga exercise can hurt people and it happens every day. So safety is just as important in yoga as any other workout. Moreover, studies show that yoga is an absolutely great workout. It tones muscles and older people need that badly.

If you're older and/or a beginner and want to get some short but effective exercise into your day, I recommend this DVD. If, on the other hand, you're used to power yoga and want something faster and more challenging, you probably won't like this.

5311143,4,B009AVCAGC,"This is broken up into 10 minute segments & you can pick & choose your own workout. I really appreciate that this is geared toward the older adult. I also appreciated that Ms. Fonda was willing to put herself out there & show some of her own weaknesses with the audience - for example, she has a difficulty balancing in some of the poses without holding on to a chair. It was an encouragement to me to see that it's ok not to be perfect at yoga & there is still benefit from doing the best I can do. There are people demonstrating who have all skill levels. The poses are basic yoga poses. Overall, this is a great yoga workout but not overly strenuous.

5311193,5,B009AVCAGC,Enjoy this yoga DVD.  It proceeds at a slow pace which is just right for me.  The directions are clear and concise.,1364256000,,115,4.181818181818182

5311195,3,B009AVCAGC,"I really liked this video but just expected more. I expected her to at least be betraying her yoga mates
while doing jumping jacks and calling them baby killers. Not a single person got killed in this video which
made me feel with Mrs. Fonda in it, it was not genuine. No references to good liposuction or plastic surgeons
in it either to at least keep it kind of real.",1364083200,,369,4.285714285714286

5311197,4,B009AVCAGC,"I decided to buy this dvd after purchasing another dvd that says beginners. The other dvd was to advance, after looking at the sample video I purchase the AM/PM Yoga by Jane Fonda. I did the 2 of the am routines this morning and really enjoyed how slower it is. I am a true beginner and I think this is for me, I like that it has 3 different routines and if you are short on time you can do 1 or 2 or all 3. I will update my review after I have done it a little longer. But if you've never done yoga before you might like this one because it is much slower and not to advance like some of the other dvd's that states beginners and when you purchase it, it really is not.

This is a update from my original review. Love this dvd, the only thing I think needs work is the breathing exercise, it's kinda all over the place sometimes. Other than that this is a excellent cd for new beginners and older generation, I'm 46 and this cd is just what I was looking for. I really like the 15 minutes AM increments, when you don't have time to do all 3 you can just do 1 or 2 are all 3. The PM relaxtion is good to do at the end of the day. This is a good variety to keep me interested in exercising.",1363737600,4,1189,3.872950819672131

Like the option of being able to utilize Jane's instructions or do on own.  Find this just right for beginners or a quick yoga workout.  The relaxation evening incorporates my favorite end of day yoga stretching.  Hardest part is making myself get up off the mat since I am so relaxed.
Another home run for Jane Fonda workout series.",1363478400,5,470,4.4186046511627906
5311200,5,B009AVCAGC,"This DVD was exactly like I expected: easy, mellow, encouraging, and I always feel better after doing even one of the workouts. I've always liked Jane Fonda and I especially enjoy her workouts now that she has gotten over the ""feel the burn."" She does explain as she goes but you move along. You're not just sitting there, waiting while she explains. These workouts are great for baby boomers such as myself and even older folks. I like that you can turn off the talk if you desire and the work outs are short and split up. I have no time for 30-40 minute workouts. I haven't done all the work outs yet (lazy!) but enjoyed the RELAXATION (and it was!) and the ABS AND BACK (need to do it more often for sure!). All in all, I WILL be using this DVD again and it won't gather dust like so many do.

UPDATE 3-23-13 Woke up feeling stiff so I did the ENERGY workout segment. It was a standing series of poses including mountain and warrior. It was around 15 minutes and nicely worked the kinks out.",1363392000,11,994,4.287234042553192

5311209,5,B009AVCAGC,Fonda's DVD provides a great way for  mature women  to limber up and to learn yoga basics without excessive strain and stress.  I use it a lot and am much more conscious of my breathing and my posture.  It would be great if she had something that takes  us to the next step.  I highly recommend it,1362355200,,297,4.12280701754386

I want to progress so I can also exercise on land. Jane is a great teacher & the poses are easy for me to do. I like that the yoga is in short segments & you can pick & choose what to work on. There's a option to do the workout without instruction. The music does not bother me at all since there's music in my other class. In Yoga, one must be mindful. These means being able to concentrate on how your body feels & not the sounds in the room. I'm inspired that she can move so easily & looks so healthy & fit at 75!",1361664000,,688,3.8865248226950353

I started doing the exercises to alleviate a muscle pull in my thigh. It took over a month to improve, but improve it did! Who knew?? I continue doing these exercises (often coupling an a.m. and a p.m. at the end of the day) and have noticed improved strength and mobility in the affected area and an overall general sense of well being. I have grown tired of those high-impact, high-powered fast workouts that just leave me feeling tense, and you will never get me into those advanced pretzel-like yoga poses.

This is a good place to start for anyone just wanting to try yoga, for anyone over a certain age who can no longer bend themselves silly and for anyone wanting to gently improve their range of motion and keep their bodies flexible.

 for beginning yoga. Jane Fonda does a wonderful job of explaining

She was interested in yoga but didn't want to make a huge investment until she knew what it was all about.  Apparently she is very happy with the program and the instructions. She says that you don't feel a lot of pressure and the pace is perfect for a person who hasn't exercised a lot in their life and wants to gradually get into it.

5311312,5,B009AVCAGC,"I planned on using one session in the mornings, well after doing the first one I decided to try another and then ended up doing the last am one too. That is saying alot for me, yoga has always left me feeling confused. This one didn't , Jane Fonda explains in detail I can understand. I have always felt clumsy trying to follow instructions in videos, always too busy trying to get things right to be able to get the most out of them. And I have always had tension in my shoulders but there is one move that has my shoulders feeling better than they have in years, after ONE time doing it!

I can follow it and physically do this one, I have been doing some strength training so I had enough strength to do all the moves so far. I am looking forward to the pm ones tonight and also the balance. But even if I never did them the am ones are worth it.

And the price was definitely right. Thank you Jane for making a video a 57 year old woman can enjoy and feel accomplished doing.",1357862400,58,979,4.09375

After you've done the workouts a few times you'll probably want to go with the music only versions.  My problem with this video is that instead of re-recording the sessions with Jane doing the yoga with music in the background, they just replay the same recording, and you see Jane saying the instructions, but you can't hear her, you just hear music.  To me, this is very distracting - to just watch her talking (you don't hear it),  and you have to wait for her to go through the instructions.  It seems like a cheap way to do it.  Why not just record the routines again, to music?",1357776000,43,677,4.455284552845528

5311323,4,B009AVCAGC,"This is a well thought out exercise dvd, but if you're expecting a more traditional yoga workout, you might be disappointed. It is a hybrid of yoga and pilates. Jane says as much in a recent Los Angeles Times brief interview about her latest exercise dvd. The abs section in the AM portion is pure pilates.

I like the 15 minute or so sections because the conditioning and pace is excellent. Sometimes Jane seems a bit stilted reading from the script. She appears more comfortable in dvds that cover aerobic exercises. Jane is accompanied by three other fit and younger women, with one doing a modified version of the regular workout sequences.

My favorite sections are the first AM and first PM, the former offers an excellent flowing sequence for shoulders designed to improve posture. Overall, the posture seems to be the theme of this DVD, which is an important and often neglected part of an exercise program. And don't miss the 10-minute bonus section on balance -- excellent, fun and quick to do.

Even though this dvd leans more toward pilates, the exercises will improve your flexibility, boost well-being, improve your balance and posture. Not bad for an dvd under $10.",1357430400,69,1180,4.8316831683168315

I picked up Lilias' Senior Yoga DVD at the Library which helped me reduce anxiety and gently initiate myself into regular Yoga practice before shoulder surgery.  Lilias' Senior DVD is geared toward seniors or those less flexible; she uses more chair-seated positions, has very good breathing techniques and good positions to increase balance.  I feel Jane's Yoga DVD is a step up from total beginner.  In Jane's DVD she has 4 friends/students with one person doing easier/modified versions of poses/positions which is helpful for someone just starting Yoga.  Jane also gives very good instructions.  The PM relaxation session is awesome/very soothing; I didn't even want to get up afterward! I specifically bought Jane's DVD because I am admire how fantastic she looks and how she has kept herself in such amazing physical condition.  I am 68 years old and have always been very active and into sports and fortunate to have flexibility, but also have developed some stiffness and aches and lower back weakness.  I am feeling much healthier after 8 months of practicing Yoga gradually increasing frequency from a couple days a week to 5-6 days a week.  It is also helping me to lower my blood pressure, lose weight and sleep better.",1520294400,,1781,4.8316831683168315
