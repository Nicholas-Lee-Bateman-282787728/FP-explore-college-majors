2921712,5,B000058322,Seen this well part of it on TCM and loved what I seen so much that I wanted to see the whole movie. This was a top rate film I enjoyed it,1407024000,,138,3.34375
2921713,4,B000058322,"Very good preview of what was to become Victor,Victoria years later. Jessie Matthews is a remarkable entertainer that most of we Yanks know absolutely nothing about.........you will enjoy her performance.",1388448000,,204,5.833333333333333
2921714,5,B000058322,"Jessie is wonderful, the film a laugh from beginning to the end. Not many remakes are as good as the original. Three screen-versions of this story are extremly entertaining. FIRST A GIRL is the second.
The third, a German remake from the fifties was a failure. And then came Julie Andrews doing it again ...",1386720000,3,307,4.6

2921716,4,B000058322,It was enjoyable although it was not as entertaining or as funny as Victor/Victoria. I'll be adding it to my collection of older films.,1355270400,3,135,4.666666666666667
2921717,5,B000058322,"This movie is an adorable premake of ""Victor/Victoria"". The delightful British actress, Jessie Matthews, plays the part of Julie Andrews. If you liked V/V, you'll love this movie. Jessie Matthews' singing and dancing numbers are fabulous, especially when she's covered in feathers!",1353024000,,281,5.714285714285714
2921718,5,B000058322,"This is a rare treat for JESSE MATTHEWS fans.  Sound and picture are very good on this entertaining musical film. Her films are very rare and usually poor transfers.
Buy with confidence.",1345161600,3,186,4.8125
2921719,5,B000058322,"During the 1930s, the charming dancer Jessie Matthews was known as the ""Queen of the British musical"".  She was to the British cinema what Eleanor Powell was to American movie audiences.

Unfortunately, for a various reasons, this talented performer never worked in Hollywood films, and her delightful musicals have not been made available on DVD to audiences in the USA...until now.

As part of their Rank Collection, VCI Entertainment has released Ms. Matthews' FIRST A GIRL (1935), which, years later, served as the basis for Blake Edward's VICTOR/VICTORIA starring Julie Andrews.

FIRST A GIRL is a fun, extremely entertaining movie with some enjoyable songs (e.g. ""Everything's In Rhythm With My Heart"").  The dance numbers are also quite spectacular, sort of Busby Berkeley light.

Matthews is marvelous as the young woman, who pretends to be a man in order to play a woman on stage, where she is a major nightclub star, and her real-life husband, Sonnie Hale, doing the Robert Preston role straight, is also excellent.  Griffith Jones and Anna Lee are cast in the parts done by James Garner and Lesley Ann Warren in the remake, but in this early version, they are simply very rich people, rather than an American gangster and his moll.  Victor Saville directed.

VCI has done an excellent job of restoring this movie, and it looks great.

2921720,5,B000058322,"First off, when reading the reviews for this film here on Amazon please NOTE THE DATE of the review. Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL releases of ALL prints of a film together. I noted that there are reviews from 2008 talking about inferior prints. Not so any longer. Read on...

I was not familiar with the film or Jessie Matthews for that matter until this DVD arrived from VCI. As their title page on all their DVDs (when you start one) ""Good movies never go out of style"". And that is certainly the case with this one. It was the film that inspired Blake Edwards hit musical film ""Victor/Victoria"" and the Broadway musical of that name. But this was made in 1935.

It is a true delight and anyone who loves the 1930s musicals directed by Busby Berkeley will want this. No, Berkeley didn't direct it but there are plenty of production numbers and the number ""I can Do Anything With You"" uses the kind of special effects that Berkeley was famous for and has LOTS of gorgeous female dancers. There is lots of music here with some great numbers by the lead character played by Jessie Matthews as an aspiring entertainer who can't get a job as woman entertainer so she pretends she's a man dressing up as a woman. (Don't worry, you'll understand when you see it.).

Her co-star Sonnie Hale (a male in case you weren't aware) is Matthews' match for performance. The finale with Hale in Matthews' role (again, it will make sense when you see it) is superb.

As I said at beginning, there were comments about previous prints. Well this print was restored to wonderful sharp black and white and there was not a scratch or glitch to be found when I watched it. This is now one of my Top DVDs from VCI.

The 88 minute film has only one bonus feature added. A photo gallery which plays for 1.5 minutes with one of Matthews songs as the soundtrack.

This film is part of the British film company, The Rank Organisation. That VCI is remastering and releasing.

I was smiling for hours after watching this DVD yesterday. You will be too!

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

2921727,5,B000058322,"""First A Girl"", the second version of the Victor/Victoria story with Jessie Matthews who seems to be just marvelous in any role.  The musical numbers are also just marvelous.  This DVD from VCI is one of their best.  They have acquired an excellent print that is just perfect.  I'm quite pleased to see an increase in the early British films from VCI and particularly from Network in the U.K.",1427932800,2,392,4.63768115942029
2921728,2,B000058322,loved the concept but just not my kind of movie -,1426204800,,49,3.5454545454545454
2921729,5,B000058322,"PLOT: 2 down and outs come up with the perfect act~

1935~ messenger girl Elizabeth meets fellow actor...Victor.. both have horrible auditions ... the duo end up in the same eatery, and are both down and so 'very out.' Victor a Shakespearian actor~~keeps the rent paid by being a female impersonator~ but a cold has him unable to SING. Victor (SONNIE HALE) decides he can ""disguise"" Elizabeth as a boy and then have her 'pretend' to be a girl~Elizabeth (JESSIE MATTHEWS) PULLS off the clever disguise and is a big hit.... the duo are booked in all the big cities of Europe. The over the top SONG AND DANCE numbers are pretty / dresses and costumes are gorgeous. Victoria (Jessie Mathews) has a fine voice but is known for her slight 'warble' which ads to the mystique. In the audience are a Princess and her soon to be fianc Robert~ Robert makes a fool of himself admiring ""Victoria"" while she sings... but is not amused to find SHE is a HE...This is very funny....but...the jig is up when the princess discovers Victoria IS a girl after all~.... Robert is out to get even.....done for fun and laughs.....SONNIE HALE steals the show with his first rate comedic timing.... later remade as Victor/Victoria. Jessie Mathews and Sonnie Hale were married after this movie debuted. Clever script and Jessie pulls of the male /female parts extremely well. I give it 5 out of 5 and this print is excellent in Glorious Black and White and supurb audio. I had my doubts how good this movie was, but it is far better than I expected.",1424217600,4,1521,4.612546125461255
2921730,5,B000058322,"One of the best Jessie Mathews features, though the dancing is not done by Buddy Bradley so it's more glitzy but not as cool as others like ""It's Love Again"" and ""Sailing Along"".",1418256000,,178,4.424242424242424
2921731,5,B000058322,"I love ""old"" movies and this is the ""original"" Victor/Victoria ... well done, funny and the thirties weren't all that bad",1407283200,2,121,4.809523809523809

8213250,5,B000058322,"I'm a sucker for 1930's musicals: Fred and Ginger, Busby Berkley, even the Marx Brothers, and First a Girl has a little bit of all of them rolled into one gem of the genre. I loved Victor/Victoria with Julie Andrews and Robert Preston, and this English/Irish film is the original on which the newer version is based. Sonny Hale as Victor is marvelous - a singing, dancing Eric Blore. ""Victoria"" is adorable and has a lovely voice. This is a class act, light-hearted and never over the top. Get ready for a glorious and memorable ride.",1464134400,,534,4.572916666666667

8213252,5,B000058322,"This film, like Victor/Victoria, were both remakes of the 1933 German film Viktor und Viktoria.  The premise has a woman (Jessie Matthews as Elizabeth) helping out her new friend (Sonnie Hale as Victor), who has lost his voice due to a cold.  Hes a female impersonator.  He cant afford to lose his job, however lousy the venue.  Against her better judgment, she performs his number then removes her wig.  She is instantly hired by a producer to perform all over Europe as Victor playing Victoria, his alter ego.  A snooty princess (Anna Lee) attends one of the performances with her boyfriend who is instantly smitten with Victoria until she pulls off her wig and presents herself as Victor.  The suspicious princess is determined to prove hes a shes.
Theres music, plenty of dancing, and loads of comedy.  I was surprised at how good it was and how well it was filmed.  And this Rank Collection transfer is exceptional.",1456444800,,920,4.772151898734177
8213253,5,B000058322,Saw this movie on one of the old movie channels awhile back and really liked it.  Was surprised it is available on DVD.  Very efficient sellers and quick transaction.  Very happy with purchase.,1449360000,,193,4.787878787878788
8213254,4,B000058322,"This delightful old film is the English original that was later done so wonderfully with Julie Andrews and Robert Preston as Victor/Victoria. Jesse Matthews is no Julie but she was a major star in her day and acquits herself well. The story is different enough with delightful plot twists and complications to stand on its own merits. I haven't seen the earlier German Viktor und Viktoria to comment on how they compare, although Victor/Victoria gave credit to the German film as its basis.
The musical numbers in First a Girl reminded me of Busby Berkely but less complex, with dancing girls rising above and dropping below the floor, intricate leg movements and the elegant birdcage number. I really think it's worth seeing.",1448064000,,726,4.959016393442623
