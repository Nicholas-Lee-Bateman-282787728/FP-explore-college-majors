8192317,5,B000PLZIDI,"6 years ago I painted my house after watching this DVD.  I had never painted before and was able to paint the whole interior of my new house within a couple of weeks (I was painting when not working).  It came out looking better than the local pros.
We are in the process of closing on a new home and I was hoping to watch this again as a refresher.  I can't find my old copy of this DVD and I'm sad to see this DVD is no longer available.",1495929600,,439,3.8555555555555556
8192318,1,B000PLZIDI,"I purchased this DVD in hopes of learning a few tricks to help speed up my job. I found that there wasn't very much applicable knowledge passed on. He tells you how to practice brushing and rolling and dye your spackle so you don't forget where that hole is you just fixed. There was also nothing on exterior painting like it said there was. Seems like a nice guy and a good painter, but not a teacher of his trade.",1286150400,,415,4.2
8192319,5,B000PLZIDI,"My daughter, back from college for the summer, wanted to paint her bedroom. I didn't want to spend $$$ again for just one room.  So we checked out this DVD and absorbed all the tips and information in it.  And voila, it worked because the room now has a beautiful fresh coat of paint that my daughter loves and we all know how picky teenagers can be.  We've actually used Greg in the past decade to paint our house as well as our rental property. So it was nice to have our personal painter giving us all the inside information. I just hope this DVD doesn't take away from his business too much!",1277337600,,595,4.247787610619469
8192320,5,B000PLZIDI,"This video has plenty of practical painting tips, but it really shines in its laser-like focus on brush and roller technique, along with a brief but effective spackling demo.  You'll never learn this stuff from books; it is best learned by seeing it done, in real time, by a pro.  But you won't find many professionals with the time or patience to explain exactly what they are doing every step of the way.  That is just what you get from this DVD.  To help you develop your skills, the narrator shows a series of exercises you can do right at your own ""job site"".

Another reviewer complained that not enough time is spent on topics such as types of paint.  For the most part, such topics are more suitable for books and online text.  In fact, there is no shortage of written material on these topics, and I don't think they would benefit from a video treatment.  On the other hand, the DVD's producer has selected those painting practices that are better demonstrated rather than described.  I can't tell you how many times I have read about loading a brush properly, painting up to a line, backrolling, and so on.  But it never really clicked for me until I saw these things done on the DVD.

Throughout the DVD, you'll hear the narrator use the term ""nailing it"", in reference to a task perfectly completed.  For me, the DVD itself nails the job of teaching the most important painting techniques.  Unless you've already mastered these techniques, or you have access to a kindly expert, you will learn things here that you just can't find anywhere else.",1249171200,3,1557,4.5978260869565215
8192321,5,B000PLZIDI,"I would like to thank Greg for making this video.  Finally I have something to help teach my staff how to paint.  Being in commercial building maintenance it is tough to find training videos that are worth the time and money, this one hit the spot with me.  Greg may seem a little nervous and make some corny jokes, but I would rather have a person with experience tell you how to do something than an actor.

This video shows you the steps, from start to finish, and does it in a no nonsense way.

Thanks again",1238112000,,511,4.22680412371134
8192322,1,B000PLZIDI,Redundant strokes!  No discusion of paint types; very low on wall preperation; no help on how to paint a ceiling.  Two hours of how to move your brush and roller and not much else.,1219622400,,180,4.264705882352941
8192323,5,B000PLZIDI,"I watched this DVD twice in a row, and suffice to say, it is a great (not just good) piece of informative ""insider tips"".  I learnt alot of little things that only years of experience (and mistakes) would impart. This DVD has earned it's place on my bookshelf reference section.

Excellent work Greg.",1195689600,2,300,4.6415094339622645
8192324,5,B000PLZIDI,"I always watch those do it yourself shows on TV, never learned much....until I got this DVD, there is sooo much information, clearly and thoroughly explained and demonstrated, it really made me feel confident I could do a good job of painting my bedroom and hallway, which I did, and I'm happy to report ,to rave reviews!!!!

Just one (actually two) word: GET IT!!!!!, you'll be glad you did",1178668800,7,391,4.666666666666667
8192325,5,B000PLZIDI,"Well, painting is the last thing that I wanted to do and the only reason I purchased this DVD was to have my wife watch it so she could paint the kitchen herself.  I hate painting!!  After watching the DVD with her, we both were able to work together and completely finish the job from start to finish, in a single afternoon.

If you are not a professional painter, I would highly recommend this DVD.",1178150400,7,400,4.306666666666667
