5509880,5,B00ATR7ED0,"This story is told in the words of the residents of Skid Row in Los Angeles, and in the voices of those who work with them. ""Lost Angeles"" truly depicts people who are refugees in their own country. An important film to see, because it examines the the problem of poverty in the city so honestly that at certain moments it is difficult to watch.

5509881,5,B00ATR7ED0,"This self-affirming, award winning and moodily informative documentary, narrated by Catherine Keener, shines a different light on what is referred to as a ""low-income housing community"" and basically, it is. Skid Row does not exist on any map, and populates over 11,000 people, of whom are: caretakers of others there, the occupants themselves, cleanup people, welldoers, the numerous mentally ill, sanitation groups, line cooks, Advocates for the community, and others having exceptional creativity with their jobs that they do (daily and/or nightly).  Over 2/3 of the population of Skid Row is mentally ill and just trying to their lives together.

Along with the aforementioned groups, the documentary takes a look at several individuals living here who have high hopes for the future: A younger Danny Harris is a 'Silver Medalist' from the Olympics.  Multiple times diagnosed, and suffering from mental illness, Bam Bam is the subject of controversies and will permanently be moving on with a 'Section 8' in time.  ""Detroit"" has been mentally-ill since the age of 16 and now is a displaced  mother who chose to travel and live here. While O.G. works during the day, along with his volunteer ""Brigade"", keeping the streets clean,  Mary Anne spends her days taking care of the cat population (and some of the other animals also) within the area along with her much younger partner Kevin (K.K.) Kohen.  He came from an affluent upbringing, is more than halfway through Medical School, and is also midway into his psychology degree.  This focus group is, in part, the vocal Advocate for changing the condition and bettering their home.

The community inhabits a small share of outreach programs, including L A M P, that aids the mentally ill people with food, medical care, pharmaceuticals, and housing.  No questions are asked of the newcomers and those who dwell there, most reside in the offered housing while others are transient.  The ""Midnight Mission"" cooks and serves food 3(+) times daily and employs 244 people of their own population to work. Several others, along with many of the police officers, Advocates, and other community groups, are 'Volunteers with a huge Heart' trying to keep things safe.

This could be atmospherically depressing at first, although it changed quite quickly into a positive for taking care of the city's own large group.  These people, residents and volunteers, are inspiring and bring a happiness to the people who view this documentary.

5509892,5,B00ATR7ED0,"I saw this on Cable. I had been to Los Angeles's Skid Row many times. Hidden away from tourists and show how the poor have to survive there. And the attempt to clean it up. I don't know how long that happened. Ironically, some of them are happy living that life from day to day.",1421798400,,278,4.072727272727272
5509893,5,B00ATR7ED0,"Few people know what it is like to be homeless.  I am a success story.  I had a nervous breakdown when I suffered extreme symptoms from PTSD.  No one really knew what it was back then.  My employer fired me while inpatient and the hospital booted me because I had no insurance once I was unemployed.  I ended up learning that my ""friends"" were thieves, stealing even my underwear and linens, electronics, my car, etc.  I lived in a shelter then left because of the craziness that was going on there and was blessed to be offered the floor of stranger's home (Dawn, I owe you so much).  I am now secure but the safety net of a college degree in Business and a great job at a Fortune 50 company wasn't enough to spare me the trauma of homelessness!  I am a success story.  I share this to say, you really don't know what the future holds!

This was a fantastic look at the reasons behind homelessness and why everyone should care about it.  I had just recently seen ""Tent City"", which I thought was excellent as well.  Both introduce various people and give a brief synopsis of the reason for their homelessness and the solutions attempted.

Lost Angels was filmed over a longer period of time in my perception, which gave a summary of what happened to some of the people who were trying to get off the street.  The overriding issue presented in this documentary was the fact that most of the people had some type of mental illness.  Our society still derides this condition as if it were a personal deficit and not a medical issue.  Thank God that they are people out there as were featured in this DVD that choose to lend people a hand in finding resources and a roof until things improve.

As a person with PTSD, I didn't choose to experience the horrific situations that brought about my condition.  If a person is homeless they must want to be right?  Those with that belief system, I ask you if it is so wonderful and freeing, then why don't you try it?  Quit your job, chuck your clothes except those that fit in a 50 pound paper bag and say goodbye to everyone you know because, when you are in trouble, the people you call your friends are going to disappear on you, I guarantee it.  If you can hold on to hope, as so many in this documentary have shown to do; then, you have accomplished a great deal and will probably escape the streets eventually.

I want to thank those who made this documentary for showing the truth of life on the streets.  I want to thank those featured, who shared their stories and their dreams.  I was deeply moved by the courage I witnessed.  I intend to buy this movie so that I can remind myself that as long as there is breathe, there is hope!",1413244800,,2681,4.346076458752515
5509894,4,B00ATR7ED0,"My husband and I watch documentaries all the time.  This is a great one.  It takes a look at the people of Skid Row, how they wound up there, and how they are treated.  Very interesting topic and subjects.",1388707200,,205,4.205128205128205
5509895,1,B00ATR7ED0,"I saw this on Netflix.

This so called ""documentary"" and the sympathetic response many people give to it is the symbol of why this country has the problems it has. It is about claiming that whatever misfortune the people in the movie have is not their fault and they deserve sympathy. Never mind that all evidence suggests that it is their fault. It is about claiming that we should feel guilty and the government should act more for their benefit at our expense.
 So, does that improve things? Not according to what I have observed. Social ""programs"" and other benefits are THE reason why these people do not fear the consequences of their life style choice: Welfare the maker of these film call out for is THE prime enabler of their life style. Wednesday when SSI checks come out is the peak of drug dealing activities, according to cops who worked Skid Row.
 The makers repeatedly blame mental illness for the conditions of the homelessness of people in skid row. So, is it? May be it does play a role. But, the problem is that the makers are only telling half the truth. Did mental illness suddenly and spontaneously develop with no fault of their own? I deal with a lot of homeless people as a course of my work, and I have been doing this for years in Los Angeles. Why is it that nearly all of the people who I interviewed claim their so called ""mental illness"" came to them around the time when they started frying their brains with drugs? Coincidence? Why is it that a lot of those people are in a position where they can benefit with SSI disability claims when they are in a position to claim mental illness, and be rewarded with money they did not earn? Coincidence?
 Toward the end of the film, makers mourned for death of Mr. Kevin Cohen (a.k.a. K.K.). But, they conveniently left out the circumstances of his death: Shot dead in a motel when he was not a guest in the room, in a known drug problem spot. So what was he doing there? It seems like LAPD has a pretty good idea of what happened ([...]).
 To picture LA C.A.N. as some civil rights watch dog is a joke. They have alliance with Occupy LA movement. One day police officers are struggling with a battery suspect in down town Los Angeles. All of a sudden people with cameras came out of nowhere shouting things like ""You have no right. You are violating his rights"" to the officers, only to walk away when the victim of the battery yelled at them for their nonsense. How do I know this? Because I have witnessed it. I was advised by officers that those are the typical things those organizations do in that area.
 The makers call illegal narcotics use of the people in the movie as ""self-medicating."" Since when did Meth, Cocaine, or Heroin cured mental illness or improve conditions? Since it is clear it is not done for that reason, it just means they're doing for the very same reason why other junkies do it, isn't it? That's what this film is all about: It's about blame shifting. Denial of responsibility.",1386288000,8,2981,4.480662983425415
5509896,5,B00ATR7ED0,"Sympathy is great ..... but motivation to help and understand is found in 'empathy'.  Empathy is healing.  It motivates.  It helps put you in the space of another, be it animal, human, even a plant that needs water.  There is great nobility to be found here on Skid Row.  Yes, there is crime, violence and apathy too.  Let us not forget though, that those aspects exist in the wealthy, the more comfortable, the 'nicer society' (tongue-in-cheek).  Pedophiles, drug lords, human trafficking, it's all a dirty secret in some of our 'respected' members of society.  So much easier to beat up and devalue the homeless, the defenseless, the mentally ill.  What is society thinking?

We all can be lost and spiral downwards.  However, the most 'enlightened' truly do walk among us.  It is those who struggle to raise themselves up, despite their circumstances, and strive for a better tomorrow.  Sometimes, it's by taking a broom and sweeping the streets, or extending love to abandoned cats.

We can all learn to live this way - thinking of others, no matter how small, and respecting the light within.

Thank you for this wonderful piece of film.",1384041600,,1142,4.844559585492228

Anyway, as my pastor said, every type of human dysfunction comes from not being loved well, and not experiencing life as 'the beloved'.

8557672,5,B00ATR7ED0,"Brilliant depiction of America's War on the Poor as evidenced by conservatives and pseudo(not true liberals)liberal hate speech such as ""poor uneducated rednecks""-  these liberals are just repeating what they hear the President call poor people:""Gun totin, Bible thumpin rednecks.""  The propaganda is repeated viciously by the media puppets who are the American people completely brainwashed by their government and media outlets. There is hatred and division in the country because  corporations create it by instilling fear in the middle class that they could end up homeless and reviled; this incites deep hatred in neo pseudo ""liberals""(who are anything but liberal and tolerant)-whereas conservatives have always held this bias.
The police are brutal to the residents in this particular poor pocket of L.A., aptly named Skid Row, regardless of the fact that The United States of America has always been  a symbol of refuge with the Statue of Liberty as its emblem.  the Statue stands in New York Harbor welcoming ""your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free.""  This used to be the motto of a great nation; however, this sentiment no longer prevails. Blind greed, ignorance and apathy are now the symbols of the dilapidated nation.

 Everyone is taught by the media with the backing of the U.S. government and corporations that to be poor is a crime and something of which to be ashamed.  In fact Pending review
pseudo left which is truly moderate middle class narcissist laugh at ""the uneducated poor"" calling them rednecks- after this grand hypocrisy by so called progressive socially conscious ""liberals"", I became a Green Party member.  I could no longer support such hypocrisy which defies and defiles the name liberal which by definition means one who cares for the poor and ostracized.
There is a real problem in our nation.  It needs to be addressed not hidden or criminalized by the likes of Giuliani and the LAPD and corporations who turn a filthy profit from the misery and imprisonment of people so poor they have no money for proper defense in our unjust criminal court system.  Prisons are now privatized and there is profit incentive from people's misery to keep those poor who committed non-violent crimes imprisoned for as long as possible-destroying their lives without thought.
Skid Row is a light in the endless darkness of the utter disgrace which is the disregard and abuse of the poor and homeless in America.  God help those who persecute the poor-they will answer for it, in this life or the next.",1480118400,,2545,5.030952380952381
