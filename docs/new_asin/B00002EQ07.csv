8305758,5,B00002EQ07,Been looking for this Hard-to-Find Vr5 Escape/Facing the Fire (Vol 4 VHS) a long time and these are hard to get.,1386028800,,112,4.380952380952381
8305759,3,B00002EQ07,"This was a great show - all thirteen wonderful episodes - and if you are looking for old appearances of Anthony Stewart Head or Michael Easton then this is well worth the money.
But if you're a fan of the show, like I am, you'll be more than a little aggrieved to learn that this tape, Vol. 4, contains the episode 'Escape.' As does Vol. 3. For some reason known only to themselves the company producing these videos, Rhino, have decided not to release episode '5D' on a tape and instead have issued 'Escape' twice, on two different tapes. With the price I have to pay to ship this over to the UK you can guess I'm not a happy bunny. This on top of the fact that Rhino have mysteriously edited out the original soundtrack and replaced it with tinny muzack of their own choosing. All in all, not great value for money.",1021420800,5,817,4.311688311688312

I was a fan when it aired on FOX television and was blessed when I saw the soundtrack in a price slasher bin in a suburban Philadelphia  store. Years later it began to air on the SCI-FI channel and I could not  get videocassettes from Rhino or the scifi.com web store. (Bast...)  Fortunately for all of us Amazon.com is getting them and making them  available. I've been spreading the word. (No, I don't work for them.)...  (Could I?)... Anyway, This whole series preceded the movie ""The Net"" which  had almost plagiaristic similarities. Since then several television series  have come and quickly gone trying to capture the magic woven by the shows  writers and producers. Obviously the on screen talent is exceptional, but I  think they get enough press on their own. (This is starting to sound like a  plug.) I highly recommend each and every episode, including this one, in  the series. It does what few producers are willing to do: Go off on a high  note. Leave us wanting more, rather than flashback and dream sequence  episodes when the idea well is running dry. Then our last memories of our  favorite shows become tainted and we long for the early season's re-runs.  But enough about ""The X-Files"", find the soundtrack wherever you can (maybe  Amazon.com will even find it for you (hint to web survey editor) and  immerse yourself in cyberpunk.",956188800,3,1439,4.737903225806452
