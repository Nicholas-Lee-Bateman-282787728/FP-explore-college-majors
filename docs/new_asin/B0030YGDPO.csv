4047811,5,B0030YGDPO,"this anime has it all.  Cool mecha combat, political intrigue, a dash of fan service, excellent art/story, and very well developed characters.

I guess there is suppose to be an R3... wonder how that will play out",1304294400,,213,4.72972972972973

4047813,5,B0030YGDPO,This is the final chapter in this epic saga. I have to say I was impressed by how well everything was put together in this show this is  a must buy for anyone who want to enjoy one of the best story ever told by a mile in my opinion. Also in my opinion these last episode alone is a must see even if you hated the show before for zero always save the day,1274486400,5,354,3.72
4047814,4,B0030YGDPO,"Rather than review the show itself, as I'm assuming that you're already aware of the total awesomeness of this series, I'll instead be reviewing the contents of this item.

Like the previous limited edition versions of code geass R2, this comes with a thin cardboard slip cover which contains a dvd case and vol. 7 of the manga adaptation.  This slip cover is wider than previous slip covers because the manga is thicker.  It's just a little too big to properly fit 2 dvd cases into.  Inside of the dvd case are two DVDs, vol. 7 and 8.  each dvd contains the usual:  several episodes, a few babaflash vids, etc.  Nothing substantially new here.  Everything that you get in the regular edition pretty much.

Only buy this version if you can get it cheaper than the standard edition or if you collect the manga.  Overall Bandai has let us all down...  Compared to season 1's amazing content that came with the special editions, R2's is severely lacking.  There are no inserts, no OSTs, no Picture dramas, no CD dramas, and no collector's box.  While all of these items do indeed exist in japan, Bandai never got any of them translated for the U.S. release.  Then again, perhaps it is the community's fault.  Code Geass is one of the most pirated animes today.  Because of this, bandai is losing a lot of money.  The community has hurt this anime greatly.  But that's still no excuse for not supplying the hardcore fans with at least the collector's box that they deserve.

Basically... it comes with the usual.  *sad face*",1274054400,26,1520,4.621722846441948
4047815,5,B0030YGDPO,"The entire Code Geass series has been a wonderful addition to my anime collection.  This final part does not let up, and only increases as the series reaches its final climax.  This is a must for anyone who has started the series, and if you have not I recommend this series immensely.",1271376000,,285,4.461538461538462
4047816,4,B0030YGDPO,"This epic saga comes to a complete end. This Limited Edition comes with a Manga and while it says Japanese language it is in English also. There is not a ton of extras and unfortunately thanks to Bandai you will pay about 5 bucks an episode as there are only 6 total on 2 disc's. Each disc has its own holder so they do not overlap each other.
 I started with disc 1 and watched the complete series in 3 days and I would have to put this at about 4 1/2 stars. By starting with disc one the story is very rich with underlying plots and it made me appreciate the series more as everything was fresh in my mind. If you've seen everything prior then all I can tell you is that Lelouch finally squares off against and brings to an end the problems with his father and brother & sister...as you watch first hand how absolute power corrupts. It ends slightly different than I had anticipated and you will understand once you fully grasp the complexity of the Zero Requiem....an outstanding twist but the title itself tells you something. You will fly through these 6 six episodes as they tie up the loose ends.

  I am not going to break down the story for you each must see it on their own. What is good about this series is that almost everyone you meet plays a part in the story. Characters have been well developed and are somewhat deep. Animation is solid (bright & rich colors) from Code Geass disc 1 to the end of R-2 part IV.
 As for myself this complete story comes in at about #5 on my top ten. I highly recommend!!!",1271116800,,1519,4.242214532871972
4047817,5,B0030YGDPO,i adore this anime and finally getting my hands on the rest of the dvds was wonderful to complete my code geass collection great anime great dvd it also came with a manga issue so it was a wonderful deal,1373846400,,203,4.1
4047818,4,B0030YGDPO,"The Code Geass series is a terrific series, although the quality became lower in this second season. Nevertheless, these limited editions were very disappointing compared to the first season's as these only include volumes of the manga and not any soundtracks or audioplays. The manga (vol. 7) itself is not as good as the anime as it follows its own way.

I would recommend this limited edition only to hardcore collectors, unless you can get it at a cheap price.",1365984000,,464,4.8

4047820,5,B0030YGDPO,"The end to the Code Geass anime goes out with a bang!
