6934280,5,B00RQJU760,"Finally, the mystery about how the body actually metabolizes processed sugar has been solved in plain language: Processed sugar is Sucrose and Fructose from plants and fruits with a very small amount of Glucose.  Sucrose and Fructose from processed sugar goes straight into the bloodstream through the small intestine; insulin cannot metabolize Sucrose and Fructose from processed sugar.  Insulin can only metabolize Glucose.  Whole fruits and veggies have fiber which protect our bloodstream from Sucrose and Fructose so it can reach the large intestine.  Beneficial bacteria in the large intestine eat Sucrose and Fructose.

When Sucrose and Fructose is in our blood, insulin floods the bloodstream and our cells eventually become insensitive to the presence of insulin, causing Insulin Insensitivity (type 2 diabetes)--our cells no longer react to insulin.  Insulin makes us hungry and blocks the feeling of satiety.  The liver has to metabolize Sucrose and Fructose into a dense morbid visceral fat stored in our vital organs, causing metabolic disease.  When insulin is able to metabolize Glucose, it stores the excess energy in the form of healthy subcutaneous fat under our skin to keep us young and healthy.  Glucose is so important that if we don't eat the small amount of glucose in fruit and veggies, our body will make its own Glucose from Protein.

I stopped eating processed carbs and processed sugar after reading his book and watching the video in December of 2015; I've lost 30 pounds in eight months.  I have not weighed under 225 lbs in over two decades.  Purchased multiple copies as gifts for my family.",1472428800,18,1624,5.156488549618321

I saw it on tv and bought DVDs for family members and for my review later.",1469923200,11,482,4.127659574468085
6934283,5,B00RQJU760,"This is a PBS special hosted by Dr. Lustig. He makes an hour long case for cutting out the sugar in the diet, and walks the audience through the effects of sugar and why it's important to reduce it for health benefits. The question and answer section was just as good as the presentation. The audience asked excellent questions and Dr. Lustig answered them with the information he had at the time. If you liked ""Fed Up"" with Katie Couric, you would probably like this presentation. I plan to watch it several times. I have a terrible sugar habit, and I'm hoping this is a good weapon to remind me to stay the course and cut the sugar out.",1469577600,6,638,4.369747899159663

6934297,5,B00RQJU760,"It was outstanding information. I'm struck by the fact that we have a food industry propped up by the government. The unhealthy food makes us sick causing ever increasing health care need and cost also subsidized by the government. If we just make better food choices so many of our issues would simply disappear. No doubt we would collapse the American economy as it is built on so many things we don't really need.
In the end, I guess we really are just a number to corporate America. Great information.",1442361600,13,505,4.622222222222222

THIS IS FOR YOU. If you believe we are fat as a nation, that children are fat today because they don't exercise, like we did as kids; you need to watch this video. If you are on the merry go round of a weight loss diet, you need to watch this video. Dr Lustig explains why we as a nation are getting sicker and sicker. Why heart disease is at an all time high, despite all the drugs that are suppose to lower cholesterol. It is a very eye opening video, that will expose many of the lies of the medical world.

However!!  This WATERED DOWN documentary for NPR was so dismaying that it has seriously shaken any confidence I had in NPR.
It is as if he was asked to tone down his message - because he most certainly did.
What he says in his many talks on You tube is powerful and minces no words. Amazing things.  But not here.  That message was just too much for NPR, where this talk was presented.  How disappointing.",1503100800,2,460,4.252873563218391
