4819908,4,B005LAIISU,"I saw this one with a tween-age girl, so the ""my parents don't understand"" message worked pretty well - for her, at least. Cue the familial alienation plot, with predictable rapprochement in the end. There's a big, healthy ""stand by your friends"" message, too.

OK, so the story was commodity material, or maybe one notch above. The animation was great, though. The CGI folks really have complex figures, motions, and textures down, and did a fantastic job with fur and hair. This one's popcorn-worthy, but it really helps to be with a kid in the target demographic.

4819909,1,B005LAIISU,"This movie was fantastic but i give it one star because it didn't come out a lot sooner.  Go to a place where 3D is free...  Sick-Flix.  google it.

anyway this was a much better movie than the third one.  i loved it.  and the disc is going to include a few 3D bonus features including the latest and greatest looney tunes in 3D.  so i hear....or saw...whichever...",1345161600,7,365,4.279411764705882
4819910,5,B005LAIISU,"In this new installment, we find our favorite main characters from the
previous films (Ray Romano,"" Everybody Loves Raymond""; Denis Leary,
""Rescue Me""; John Leguizamo, ""Carlito's Way"") on board for another
exciting, fun-filled adventure. What I really liked about Ice Age 4:
Continental Drift is the repeated theme of family and loving one
another no matter what, which is a great message for all ages and the
movie delivers it without being preachy. And even though it's not as funny as
the previous three movies (due to there being more dramatic elements,
which made me feel for the characters more), there are still plenty
laughs to be had.

Now for the (very minor) flaws:

1.> The teenage mammoth characters (voiced by rap/R&B singers Drake and
Nicki Minaj and ""Glee's"" Heather Morris) are completely annoying and
useless, and they drag the movie down a bit.

2.> The relationship/romance between Diego (Leary) and Shira
(singer/actress/""American Idol"" judge Jennifer Lopez) didn't get much
screen time or development.

3.> The scenes with Scrat weren't as funny this time around, probably
because he's been overused, but he does get less screen time compared
to the first two movies.

4.> Overall the movie tried to cram too much into too little time.

Overall Ice Age 4: Continental Drift is a really good movie, you won't
regret seeing it.

Now please bring on Ice Age 5!!!!!!",1344816000,3,1384,5.0174672489082965
4819911,5,B005LAIISU,"We just went to see this in theaters today, and it was ADORABLE, sweet, and the kids couldn't stop laughing. (And Wanda Sykes & John Leguizamo ALWAYS make ME laugh, anyway...)",1343433600,5,175,4.67741935483871
4819912,2,B005LAIISU,"I will not repeat what others said. The only one thing I really did NOT like was that there was way too much violence. Sure, I get the idea of pirates, but it was too much. Knifes? Fire weapon? And this is a movie for kids? I see some trend of violent movies - compare Cars and Cars2. Similar thing was done here.

Except that - it was funny; however, I have a feeling the first two parts of Ice Age were the best.

Go see it, but I would not spend 20 USD on DVD...",1343260800,2,465,3.8333333333333335
4819913,5,B005LAIISU,"I don't know what some people have against this movie. i thought that it was better than 2 and 3. don't get me wrong i loved 2 and 3 but this one out beats them. the characters get more loveable each movie. sid was my favorite character. granny bumped him to number two. wanda sykes did a good job brining that chracter to life. and i like the fact that they put a real villian in the film, it made it more exciting even though his goal of stoping our loveable trio was out right dumb, but the actor who voiced him did so well you had no choice to love to dislike him. all in all this was a awesome movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do",1343001600,2,661,3.9402985074626864
4819914,1,B005LAIISU,"This is in no way like the other three Ice Age movies. It is just plain irritating from beginning to end. The voices of Wanda Sykes, Queen Latifah, Jennifer Lopez, and Nicki Minaj are like fingernails on a chalkboard from beginning to end, and every crowd scene is made to sound like a ghetto basketball game.

Throw in a stupid take-off of Pirates of Penzance, a bored performance by the main characters (although they made Peter Dinklage into a manic monkey), and you get a stew of pain. I guess they decided it's time for minority voices to drown out the white males, and this is the stupidity they come up with. Blecch.

The only good thing about the movie is Scrat, but even that comes out being relatively stupid. The animal goes to the core of the earth, runs back and forth and makes the earth crack up. Riggghhhtttt.",1342224000,16,825,4.493333333333333

4819916,5,B005LAIISU,"It was great! Laughed from start to end. Sure it makes you think of the previous ones, but we had a good time. All critics aside,... that's good enough for 5 stars for me.

***************

A little bit more elaborate:
We like the Ice Age movies.
All of them! Sequel after sequel (or squirrel after squirrel).

I always wonder if I'm going to like the next one as much as the previous one.
I feel I can't really compare the one with the other, ...
why would I anyway,... they are too far apart for me to remember the previous one in detail.
I,... we,... enjoy each one as they come out.

Afterwards, I try remember the previous one,... actually feel like watching them over again,...
Start remembering some of it,... realize it's the same concept,... over and over.

(a bit spoiling (?) in next 4 sentences..)
Some mayor nature event happens,
main characters get seperated from their habitat,
which sends then on a mega mayor adventure,
as they go on their way, and/or try to find their way back.

But we don't care,.. ""I"" don't care,...
I laughed,.... ""we"", whole family (with 7 year old), luaghed, throughout the movie!
That's good enough for me for 5 stars.

I hope over 50 years or so, ....
I'll be walking out the theater with my great grand kids,
... still laughing after watching Ice Age XXIX ...

4820967,1,B005LAIISU,"If you can get this movie for free, then it's almost worth it, as long as you have extra space on your DVD shelf.  But if you also have to actually watch it, well ... it falls well below ""worth it"" level.  Actually, if you're also only about 6 or 7 years old then it probably is worth it.  The script seems like it might have been written by a 12 year old and as far as the animation goes, how is that a woolly mammoth has shrunk down to about the size of a bear and can get knocked out by a snowball?  I won't waste everyone's time with a detailed dissection of the movie.  Suffice it to say it seems like a movie which the studio demanded to be written in about a week's time by someone with no talent.  They added high quality computer generated characters.  The animation was good.  That's why it rates one star, as opposed to zero stars.",1452729600,,842,4.091463414634147

4821349,2,B005LAIISU,"When I watch Ice Age, I couldn't care less about the mammoth(s?), tiger, sloth, or any other idiotic extinct creatures; I do however care for and passionately love the squirrel.

Unless the squirrel is on screen, Ice Age: Continental Drift has its audience drifting in and out of boredom. Really, the squirrel is the only redeeming character of this film. To be totally honest, judging by the highly misleading cover image of the film, we all thought this entire movie was focused on the squirrel. But this is far from the case. Instead, the movie focuses on a slew of incessant squawking from, but not limited to, a stereotypical pack of jock-mammoths (was Niki Minajs character even necessary?) and a grandma sloth with a voice grating enough to grenade your eardrum. Not including the squirrel in every second of the movie was the creators first and greatest mistake. The squirrel has an affirmative position in movie history, alongside Orson Welles and Denzel Washington, not only because of his unparalleled talent, but because of the depth of his character.

The squirrel is the epitomization of mankinds passions and uninhibited desires. Nuts are both his conquest and his vice; his nourishment and ruination. With otherworldly persistence, he will go to the ends of the earth for an acorn, figuratively and literally, falling from the earths crust to the core to reach it. His passion culminates in the final scene of the film (SPOILER ALERT) when after his heroes journey he finally reaches Scratlantis. Aristcratle, the wise, Grecian-esque philosopher, challenges the squirrel to be more than a rodent, but his request sees no end. The squirrel tornadoes through the abundance of nuts on the island, destroying the seemingly civilized society based on wisdom and thought. The squirrels deep struggle mirrors the problems some humans face.

While the squirrel seemed at first content with what his brethren had wrought; we discover that his happiness is caused not by meeting other members of his species (the first squirrels other than our legendary squirrel to appear in these movies), or for the incredible art and sciences they have mastered. Instead it is entirely caused by his now easy access to what drives him entirely: nuts. Within one breath, he turns from amazement to greed, willingly choosing to doom the other squirrels and the entire island (and perhaps the known world), only in order to get a single, additional nut. When one thinks about it, nuts run the entire squirrel society, the same way that money is threaded into our human world. Fascinatingly, even when the squirrel is able to get a nut, or in the case of Scratlantis, many nutshe doesnt enjoy them. He in fact does nothing at all except to hide it away. Perhaps this references his desire to have food in the long run, i.e. over winter, however given that this is the ice age, and that its always winter for this squirrel, and that he never seems to eat, the idea that he desires to get a nut to sustain himself is unlikely. This supports our argument about the squirrel possessing more depth than appears. We believe that his ambition to capture nuts and to stomp on them must necessarily speak to the vices of certain humans, who are never satiated and whose greed knows no bounds. God I love the squirrel.

In the main plotline, the questions of evil and vice could not even compare to that of the squirrel. The villain captain monkey was the worst villain of all time. He caused a certain amount of fear to a two year old only because he said he could shove peoples guts out of their mouths by pushing downwards from stomach to mouth. That doesn't even make any sense.

4821727,3,B005LAIISU,"Ice Age: Continental Drift
 For three year olds Ice Age: Continental Drift (aka Ice Age 4) will seem new and fresh.  After all, they haven't been to many movies.  The tale, as most of us know by now, is about an unlikely band of mammoths, saber tooth tigers, sloths and assorted smaller animals that are caught up in the sudden onslaught of the last ice age.  This is a cartoon for very young children so I won't even wonder why the alpha predators are nice and cuddly and never hungry.  In a disastrous disruption of the planetary crust, the friends must escape from where they are to somewhere else.  Scary.
 The mammoth family, mom, dad and teen age daughter, provide the core of the band of pals.  There is a nicely scripted sub-plot about teen girls and their dads having differing agendas.  The film does show that whatever the disagreements about curfews and boys, there is an unbreakable bond of love between parent and child. Peaches, the daughter mammoth is played by 19 year old singer/actress Keke Palmer, once the highest paid child star working.  Less successful is the dangerous interlude part of the band is captured by pirates led by a big monkey (size and perspective shifts hallucinatory like from time to time with the monkey seeming to be bigger and more frightening than the multi-ton mammoth).  The pirates include a blood thirsty bunny and a mentally deficient elephant seal.  Their ship is an ice berg pushed by sea mammals.  And so it goes.  The film is rated PG for some reason.  There is a lot more violence in the random Road Runner cartoon.
 The voice actors are what make the film interesting to adults.  Ray Ramano plays the protective mammoth dad and Queen Latifah his calm and stable wife.  Denis Leary plays Diego, the saber tooth tiger who never eats and Jenifer Lopez his feline love interest.  Sid, the goofy, hyper optimistic sloth, is voiced by John Leguizamo in an uncharacteristic role as a decent person after many roles as a low life criminal.  Other voices are provided by Peter Dinklage (lately seen in Game of Thrones as the dwarf prince) Seann William Scott, Simon Pegg and Patrick Stewart.
 Scrat, the acorn seeking rodent, pops up frequently to provide comic relief after the scary earthquake or pirate scenes.  His fixation and greed lead him to predicaments which include a trip to the center of the earth and the destruction of Atlantis.  But he is cute and funny, so its all right.
 This two saw blade cartoon movie holds nothing of interest to those past the middle grades in elementary school.  It runs a short one hour and 34 minutes to accommodate the attention span of the target audience.
  Granny Sloth, played by Wanda Sykes, makes the movie for me.  She is cranky and crazy and cant understand what is said to her.  At the climax of the film, the characters break out in song to the old Sly and the Family Stone hit, We are Fam-a-ly.  Granny thinks they are singing We are ham and cheese.  The little kids loved it.  Any film that finishes with loads of five year olds leaving the theater singing We are ham and cheese at the top of their little lungs is ok by me.
 World wide, the $100 million budget film has already brought in $255 million.  Fox was crazy like a fox to make the fourth installment in the Ice Age franchise.  Who knew?",1415836800,,3300,4.592465753424658

4821790,5,B005LAIISU,"These Ice Age movies are a must have.  Was your day rough?  Put one of these movies in your DVD/Blu-ray, and you'll feel better almost instantly.  Does Wegener confuse your teenage or college-age kids, with plate tectonics?  Have them watch the first three minutes of Ice Age 4.  Did you ever wonder whether Atlantis was real and if so, what happened?  Watch the last five minutes of this movie, just before the hilarious credits.

Cars, the owls of Gahoole, and these movies are must haves for adults with rough workdays.  Oh, and yeah you can let the kids watch them, too.

FAR better than the animation films when I was a kid;  yes, even beating classics like Snow White, Fantasia and Bambi, which of course are the shoulders on which these delightful movies, stand.",1414886400,,769,4.6716417910447765

The third was way too dark to him and I'm glad that I watched it first after reading other reviews.  This one is good, but does have more mature content and I feel that it's a bit to old for him, better for maybe 6 years or older.  The movie is good and discusses parent/teen conflicts, but when the pirates show up, it turns dark.  The ape captain is pretty evil looking at points and shows claws, insinuating that he guts creatures with them.  And later on he takes the mammoth's family hostage!

Manny and Eli now have a teenage daughter Peaches. Sid is still hanging around and you get to meet his family in this film. There is also a love interest for the grumpy old Diego the Saber. The world is shifting, obviously from the title. There are pirates in this movie and sword fighting. The pirates are ice age version of animals that look very familiar to the critters of today.
Manny, Sid, Diego and Grandma are trying to get home to Eli and Peaches after being set adrift at sea on an ice berg. Eli and Peaches are leading the herds to a land bridge to get away from a moving rock wall that is threating to make pancakes out of any animal that gets caught by the moving wall.

Awesome family movie. I would recommending this movie for all ages. Now I wait and see if there will be a 6th movie in the series  These movies are all standalone so you don t have to have seen the last 4 to watch this one and know what is going on.",1397606400,,1152,4.066079295154185

The Ice Age movies have stayed consistently funny, witty, exciting, and intelligent.  If anything, with each movie the series gets better.  The cast is always stellar.  The voice-acting perfect.  Every story in this series is an intelligent plot pushed into motion by unique and interesting characters.  The settings and effects are beautiful.  The music is endearing and well-scored.

I cannot say enough good about these movies.  Some adult humor and references are cleverly woven into scenes.  The writing creatively integrates Scrat the Squirrel's personal quest for his beloved acorn.

Every single movie in this series truly appeals to and satisfies both children and adults.  Ice Age movies are high budget, big production displays of creativity and strong writing.

I promise that Continental Drift is as good as Ice Age, Meltdown, and Dawn of the Dinosaurs.

4822509,1,B005LAIISU,"I've been a fan of the series for several years because the jokes make kids laugh for one reason, and adults laugh for another. Like Shreck, it had funny loud characters for the kids, and a lot of jokes for the parents that went right over their kids heads. The voice talent is second to none with Romano, Latifah, Leary, and Lequizamo working perfectly together.

The problem with this movie is they threw all of that out of the window and wrote it for tweens. It has tween wave music throughout, one of the central themes is trying to fit in with popular kids and abandoning your close friends to do it, etc.

I found myself reaching for the mute button several times to block out the god awful music.

Remember when MC Hammer did the Adams family theme song? Imagine that amount of suck and annoyance multiplied by 1000 and that's the music in this movie.

Add to that the simplified and formulaic plot and it's a movie you will never watch again.

There were only a few highlights in this mess.

Wanda Sykes as granny but even here it felt like business as usual, nothing spectacular.

Skratt was probably the best thing about the movie. On his never ending voyage in search of the perfect nut he finally finds his version of heaven, and in schatenfreud glory screws it all up.

Dinklage as a pirate monkey was a nice surprise as well.",1388880000,,1339,4.459016393442623

Highly recommended",1387929600,,128,5.4
4822529,3,B005LAIISU,"It's not a bad movie, but it's not a good movie either. The first remains the best and the curse of quality decline when making sequels absolutely holds true here.

While I loved the movie visually - particularly the pirate crew - and certainly got plenty of laughs (a certain squirrel remains as awesome as ever), I found that it was far less thoughtful than its predecessors. It also lacked their life.

In particular, it lost a lot of its charm due to so little attention being paid to detail - which was much of what it had to ride on, since there was no particularly compelling character interactions or stories to tell. Just plenty of giggles, a couple snorts, and just enough repetitive action to get you through the rest of it. Some scenes were so random and stupid that they weren't even funny, leaving my friends and I glancing at one another after, slightly curious as to what the writers were consuming before script work.

There is also a spontaneous musical that was both terrible and felt incredibly out of place. It was like they were trying to do too much without balancing any of it properly.

Finally, the contrast of a father trying to return home and the brainless high school lesson was jarring.

Overall made for something very kid friendly, but droll and no longer engaging for the whole family.",1387670400,4,1319,4.619658119658119

At times, perhaps a little too much 3D poking at the face with swords and such; But great use of 3D otherwise.  As with all sequels to a good original, it was different from the first in some ways.

4822685,4,B005LAIISU,"Ice Age: Continental Drift is a playful movie. The movie focuses again on our furry friends including Manny, Diego, and Sid. The premise of the movie focuses on Manny's teenage daughter, Peaches. Scat's antics, the squirrel on the cover, cause an interesting turn of events leading the viewer to encounter a number of interesting new characters and ideas for the ice age series. Without spoiling the story, I can say that the film features a solid cast, strong family themes, and a simple and straightforward plot that while predictable and shallow, is both playful and fun. It is very enjoyable and engaging for those interested in a light hearted family film (that is good if you watch it alone as well).

The video itself is wonderful from a technical standpoint. The colors are saturated, the detail in the fur and environment is sharp and interesting. While few and far between, the blacks showcase detail and texture that will prove to be interesting and engaging.

The audio features a DTS-HD Master Audio and takes advantage of a wide dynamic range that while not blowing you out of your chair loud, will do nice to differentiate standard dialogue. The music found throughout the film is integral, yet never gets in the way of the dialogue which remains clear and understandable no matter what happens. For those with a powerful subwoofer, the movie will provide ample opportunities to exercise it.

In total, this movie was fun, playful, and a great for the family. It never goes very deep, the characters aren't the most dynamic, but it is the perfect movie to watch when looking for a quiet and enjoyable experience.",1379462400,10,1627,4.866425992779783

4823080,4,B005LAIISU,"***This review may contain spoilers***

""Ice Age 4 - Continental Drift"" (hereafter IA4) is an ideal example of what I like to call ""Cinematic Dissonance"".  I define Cinematic Dissonance as the sensation when, watching a movie, your brain is telling you ""This is really silly and/or stupid!"" but your emotions are telling you ""I'm having a great time!"".  Therefore, I can understand and even somewhat agree with the 1- and 2-star reviewers of this movie who complain that IA4 is basically more of the hackneyed, predictable, improbable, and homogenized capers of Manny the Mammoth (Ray Romano) and company.  And yet, I side with the 3- and 4-star reviewers who enjoyed IA4 as an energetic, dynamic, funny seagoing adventure with allusions to Homer's ""The Odyssey"" that somehow still reinforces the themes of family, adolescent angst, loyalty, self-sacrifice, and home.

  With each succeeding ""Ice Age"" movie, logic and natural reality have been left further and further behind.  For example, by now, to appreciate the franchise, you have to accept that Scrat the obsessed saber-toothed squirrel's acorn pursuit will lead to more and more global catastrophic changes.  In IA4, he has caused the surprisingly fragile Pangea's fragmentation into the continents we know today.  We also have to accept that Manny is obstinately determined to keep his now-teenaged daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) safe, when actually male elephants hardly take part in raising offspring, and that Peaches' best friend is a mole/hedgehog (""molehog"") hybrid named Louis.  Of course, Peaches has also inherited her prehensile tail and tree-living abilities from her mother, Ellie (Queen Latifah).  The only other complication in our gang's essentially stable lives is the sudden abandonment of feisty Granny Sloth (Wanda Sykes) to Sid's (John Leguizamo's) care by his fly-by-night family.  Granny has a friend called ""Precious"", but it's certainly not a ring.  Hey, these are familiar domestic dramas, but IA4 still makes them interesting.

  But the continental shiftings and movements interrupt the drama and gradually separate Manny, Sid, Granny, and Diego the sensible sabertooth cat (Denis Leary) from the others.  Set adrift on an iceberg, Manny and friends encounter another iceberg - a ""pirate ship"" commanded by a Gigantopithecus (according to Wikipedia) named Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage) and his zoo crew - including a blubbery elephant seal, a rabbit, a kangaroo, and an able-bodied first-mate female Smilodon named Shira.  So now the plot is established with several resolutions to be made: 1) Can Manny and his crew escape Captain Gutt's grasp? 2) Will Shira mutiny and change alliances? 3) Can Manny and his crew weather turbulent seas, fierce narwhals, and even (!) sirens to get back home, AND save a kidnapped Peaches and Ellie?, 4) Can Manny defeat Captain Gutt in battle? 5) Can klutzy Sid get along with his grandma and be a hero, 6) Can insecure Louis help save his friends, and finally 6) Is Precious real, or just Granny's hallucination? Oohwee!

  I think you know how all the above resolutions will play out.  Even so, I enjoyed them because I felt that all of IA4's characters were cheerfully giving their utmost to entertain us and having a grand time doing so.  Besides the vivacious characterizations, IA4 continues the breathtakingly solid and weighty photorealism of its backgrounds and animation.  Most importantly, IA4 continues to resist the self-consciousness of acting in a madcap, surreal story.  The characters believed in the story and told it well, and made me believe it, too.

P.S.:  One other resolution - Scrat finds a treasure map that leads him to a legendary acorn paradise called ""Scratlantis"".  Does Scrat find the acorn of his dreams?  Wellll,.....

P.P.S.:  By the way, Gigantopithecuses really did exist about 1 million years ago.  They were huge apes over 10 feet tall.  Therefore, it is quite plausible that Captain Gutt could fight and even toss around Manny.",1367366400,,3989,5.22992125984252

4823083,4,B005LAIISU,"Ice Age: Continental Drift is basically like the other Ice Ages movies with one exception: this time the focus on adventure and excitement is much MUCH faster, uncontrollable and flat out zannier this time around.  I mean significantly crazier, haha.  I'd honestly need to watch Continental Drift about 3 more times to really be able to keep up with the many assortment of animal flips, dives, jumps, rolls, leaps, etc.  Don't get me wrong- there's a storyline present, but it's not always obvious.  Quite often you have to wait for storyline progressing segments to occur.

When an iceberg separates the mammoth played by Ray Romano and leaves his wife (played by Queen Latifah) and their daughter on their own, the mammoth and saber-toothed cat accidentally go on a little iceberg adventure involving tons of oceanic creatures coming into the picture and causing hilarious chaos (especially the one with the crab and the sloth- I love this one in particular).

Soon after, they make landfall and find themselves trapped against an ape who claims to be the king of the ocean so fighting against him is entirely hopeless.  Also, a female saber-toothed gray cat comes into the equation and reluctantly fights against (and eventually with) the mammoth, cat and sloth.  However in order to join in with the gang of familiar animals we all know and love, she has to separate herself from the ape whose quest is solely on destroying our loveable talkative animals... which proves to be quite a difficult decision for the cat.

I'd say Continental Drift offers a ton of excitement, however the one problem is that many of the jokes fall flat.  I'm not a Nicki Minaj fan so her presence is pretty pointless and uninteresting.  I *am* however, a fan of Wanda Sykes who provides a few really hilarious lines.  Unfortunately Continental Drift focuses on humor that people like Nicki Minaj, Snooki and others would prefer, and the same can be said for the rather uninspiring soundtrack we hear throughout the movie.  These issues crop up more than a few times.

The squirrel's tireless search for the nut and unintentionally finding himself in several tricky situations returns yet again, and it never stops being funny (or weird) how the storyline involving the other animals suddenly stops so we can watch the mischievous squirrel go on a little adventure concerning his nut.  Always entertaining watching these segments.

Overall, well it's a totally zanny adventure.  This time it's crazier than usual.  Enjoy.",1367020800,3,2503,4.990361445783132

4823167,1,B005LAIISU,"For me, this was a case of one installment too many.  They completely wiped the smile off my face the minute Scrat's intro had finished divvying up the world and the other character's showed up to complain, snipe, and mistreat the plot with a few too many life lessons.  My reaction was visceral; I really really hate this movie.  I'm sorry I wasted my money on it, I'm sorry I wasted my time watching it.  If they manage to cough up another recycled mess to serve as Ice Age 5, I'm not buying it.

As for this Ice Age, it's fraught with an excess of problems not the least of which is poor characterization and a paper-thin plot swiped from a better writer.  The few themes presented are lazy and didactic.  We have the usual clichs: peer pressure, intolerance, how to destroy a friendship in one easy lesson, and what it takes to be a family, which includes an overbearing father and a permissive mother.  Children are invited to challenge and ignore parental rules....et cetera et al.  Also, the attempt to cram humanity into a fistful of furry caricatures has never been so blatant and clumsily mishandled.  The worst of it for me was learning from their bonus feature that they compare this to Homer's Odyssey.  Such a claim, considering what they produced, is pathetic at best, delusional at worst.  And!  It is not an homage to steal someone else's ideas, counterfeit them as your own, then screw them up in the process!  If you can't come up with anything original or new then you're in the wrong line of work.

If I was a skeet shooter I know what I'd do with this DVD.",1365984000,3,1578,4.487719298245614

From time and again each of these films talk on the importance of family and team work. From watching all three movies, it's hard to tell the first one from the last one.

4823284,2,B005LAIISU,"I have such a soft spot for animation that I'm overly generous with applause if there's even the slightest sign of a work being created with genuine loving care, joy, excitement and inspiration.  This Ice Age has none of those things.

We all knew they couldn't keep it fresh and creative forever; this episode signals they're out of ideas, out of story, out of dialogue, out of characters, out of steam and just don't care anymore.  The formula for this one seems to be ""Let's jam it with a wagonload of uninteresting new animals to make up for being unable to create a single new fresh, fun and funny character.""  They also kept the pace at a frenetic speed so viewers have no time to think about how predictable and cliche every action and phrase really is.  They could have not bothered stamping out this assembly-line entry at all, and would have ended up with the same result; a totally unmemorable speed-race through a blur of storyless scenes.

Denis Leary's tough-talking tiger character finally gets a girlfriend, but even here, very little effort was put into her graphic design and dialogue to make her the slightest bit special.  Remember the adorable baby in episode #1?  And the fantabulously sparkling British/Aussie jungle guide from another episode?  Of course you do.  This sequel has none of that memorable creativity, being utterly void of charm and delight.  It's only merciful act was being over and done in a flash, relieving the audience quickly of its boring misery.

The movie arrived yesterday and was taken out of its packaging for the first time today.  The movie had not been playing for long when it froze and the blu-ray player became unresponsive.  The only way to get the blu-ray player to do anything was to unplug it to reset.  The second time this happened I took the blu-ray out and put the dvd in.

Also, Crash and Eddie were mostly ignored, which made this Dad sad!

Not a bad movie by any stretch and I realize that it's trying to evolve, but I missed the simpler storylines and smaller casts from the earlier Ice Age movies.

After renting the movie and watching it myself, I find this to be a perfectly good sequel. - Is it as good as the 1st or even 2nd film? No. I don't think so; however, it is still very entertaining and fun to watch. If you have kids, I am certain they will enjoy it. There are a few cheesy moments and some not so surprising plot turns, the whole pirate theme thing and a few small annoyances with the dialogue, yet I still felt 4 stars, to say ""I like it"" is a more fair rating than 3 stars, for just ""okay"" for this 4th installment to the franchise.

My family has sat down and watched them (the other 3) multiple times together and shared many laughs.

This installment was great.  Perhaps as good as the original.  Characters are retained Ice Age era themes are maintained and it is a high soaring, vibrant adventure laced with layered humor (aka stuff that your kids will laugh at and stuff that mostly the parents will get).

In relation to other animated anthologies of the last decade (or 2), Ice Age stands out as the most fresh, most original, and perhaps the best overall.",1361750400,,792,4.794117647058823

4823940,4,B005LAIISU,"My daughter loves the first two movies so we picked up this one to complete her collection. While it is a good movie the story has changed with more focus on fighting amongst the two different herds. While the fighting isn't overly violent, our daughter just doesn't seem to enjoy this movie as much as the other two. I do think that it is a great value for the price, while it is the same movie, you do get four different versions of it.

Shipped fast and packaged well.",1359936000,,471,4.292134831460674
4823941,4,B005LAIISU,"Practically the same story line as all the others, but the comedy is pretty good, and the squirrel (I just can't get enough of him - funny!).",1359936000,,141,4.2592592592592595
4823942,5,B005LAIISU,I love the movie and the tape came fast and undamage.  Nice clear sound and picture. My whole family enjoyed sitting down and watching this.,1359936000,,140,4.6

4823946,5,B005LAIISU,I have enjoyed the whole Ice Age series.  We think this one might be our favorite.  It shows loyalty to family no matter what.  It also makes light of older age problems in a light hearted way.  I do not see it as demeaning old age but  just taking what comes in the best of light.,1359936000,,281,3.9464285714285716
4823947,2,B005LAIISU,"The fundamental premises of this series I find to be wrong, however, from an entertainment perspective, it seems that the quality of the first movie has continued to be missed in each successive movie produced afterwards.  I don't think this is as good as the previous, which wasn't as good as it's previous movie.  I'd look elsewhere as the value is very wanting in this series.",1359849600,,379,4.7272727272727275
4823948,5,B005LAIISU,The Ice Age series gets better and better. I was surprised how good the 3rd version (Dawn of Dinosaurs) but was pleasantly surprised how good the 4th one turned out. Great characters as always and Diego found a girlfriend! Definitely a great addition to our collection.,1359849600,,269,4.869565217391305
4823949,5,B005LAIISU,"Wonderful movie. I've been waiting excitedly for this movie to come out on blue ray. Now i have a 3D tv, i can re-live the movie theater experience in my home.",1359849600,,159,4.161290322580645

4823951,3,B005LAIISU,"I felt like they tried to do too much with this one in a short amount of time.  The seal, however, is laugh out loud hilarious!  Of course, it's Ice Age so it's hard to go wrong, but I expected a bit more.",1359849600,,205,3.744186046511628
4823952,5,B005LAIISU,Fun storyline! Love the personalities of the gang. Not so much into the music but it's tolerable. A great addition to your Ice Age collection.,1359849600,,142,4.72

4823954,3,B005LAIISU,"This series is slowly devolving into a beggar asking for money at the intersection you always pass on the way to work.  The kids loved it, but not much there for the 30+ crowd.",1359849600,,176,4.176470588235294
4823955,4,B005LAIISU,"Well, I think I mixed up and gave my review for this one to the other.  Anyway, definitely watch the three of these in order so you can follow the development of the characters.",1359763200,,177,4.205882352941177
4823956,5,B005LAIISU,Ice Age is always good! Very entertaining. The characters are so cool! I will look forward to another sequel! Great,1359763200,,115,4.8
4823957,3,B005LAIISU,My wife & older son liked tremendously; however to me it held no interest. Triology has a tendency to wear one out. Too many of same situations.,1359763200,,144,4.37037037037037

4824000,1,B005LAIISU,It was time to put this franchise away after the 3rd movie.  This one is stupid and senseless. Even my 9-yr-old was bored with it.,1359763200,2,130,4.2
4824001,5,B005LAIISU,"I have purchased the entire set of Ice Age movies, and this one made an excellent final (at least for now) addition. It begins with a very entertaining (and essential to understanding the rest of the movie) sequence about how Scrat the Squirrel nearly destroys the planet by chasing an acorn to the center of the earth. It gets better as the plot develops, and indeed it does.",1359676800,,376,4.544117647058823

4824007,3,B005LAIISU,"They tried too hard in too many directions on this one. A big decline from the last series installment in almost every way. It seems that the voice talent staged a palace coup, took control of the story and botched it big time. They need to put those who did the job right three times before back at the helm.",1359590400,,309,4.166666666666667

4824113,3,B005LAIISU,Would not rent again for $5 maybe rent for a dollar $1. It is your choice. The others were better,1359331200,,97,3.9

4824116,3,B005LAIISU,"The fourth installment of the Ice Age series is a throw back to the first film by separating Manny, Sid, and Diego from Manny's wife & daughter.  A new character, Granny (Sid's grandma), pops in and out of their adventure purely for humor purposes. While on an iceberg trying to get back to Manny's family, they bump into a group of insane pirates who want to take Manny captive.
Overall, it's a cute film kids will love (with a heartwarming lesson for all), but as a fan of the original, the jokes fall flat at times and the production design isn't as creative. Worth a rental but I wouldn't buy it.",1359158400,4,600,4.405405405405405

4824131,4,B005LAIISU,Only downside was even with high speed internet and not choosing HD the movie kept stopping and rechecking internet speed which was very annoying so deducted one star. Movie was very good especially Skrit characters troubles.,1359072000,,225,5.277777777777778

4824180,4,B005LAIISU,"I watched this movie with my kids yesterday and I was somewhat surprised that we laughed all the way through it. Unlike the last few Ice Age movies, it seems the writers actually remembered what made these movies so great in the first place. I thought the introduction of teenaged-drama with Peaches was a nice way to go with the storyline as it broke up the monotony. How anyone can watch this movie and not fall head over heels in love with Granny would be beyond me. She was our favorite part of the movie for sure.

As always, the animation was great and I was pleased to see that Scrat had some pretty good screen time. Overall We found this movie to be a worthwhile addition to our collection. Great family entertainment.",1358726400,,727,4.466165413533835

Most sequels, even cartoons, lose some of their ""oomph"", but Continental Drift maintained the humor (though sometime subtle) that we came to know and love from the first movie.  This movie is great for young and old alike!",1358726400,,334,4.6440677966101696

4824206,2,B005LAIISU,"I suppose the target audience for Ice Age: Continental Drift is children who have never seen a movie before. With no frame of reference, they are likely to enjoy this film. As for everyone else, I am not so sure.

The writing itself feels as if it has suffered from too many writers and too little direction. There is the overarching natural disaster of continental drift, the inter-family conflict, the pirates, and the love interest. Not one of these is given more than a few minutes for motivation, nor the proper screen-time afterwards to justify their existence in the final script  Each conflict is left undeveloped until it is miraculously resolved in the final scene.

In all, I would say it is wise to avoid this film if possible.",1358553600,,739,4.713178294573644

As with the other movies, it touches on family values, whether they are blood related or not. Not a throw it in your face lesson but subtle enough for even the youngest viewer can relate.

HOPEFULLY THEY WILL MAKE A SEQUEL.",1358208000,,103,4.15
4824390,3,B005LAIISU,Not as good as last three.  Confusing and not up to the level the last three.  It could have been but it got lost.,1358208000,,114,3.7083333333333335
4824391,4,B005LAIISU,You just can't go wrong with any of the Ice Age movies. Very funny and heartwarming stories always. I always just love Scrat and his trials in getting his nut.,1358208000,,159,4.333333333333333
4824392,3,B005LAIISU,this is not as good as earlier films in the series but not nearly as bad as some reviews would lead you to believe.  yes there is some mild cartoon violence from slightly mean and scary creatures but don't most animated shows have some bad guys.  nice saturday night movie when you don't want a deep philosophical drama,1358208000,,319,4.482758620689655
4824393,1,B005LAIISU,I have always loved the ice age movies and bought all of them.  This one should have been left on the cutting room floor (realize they probably don't do films that way any more); it was a total waste of time and an insult to those of us who have been Ice Age fans since the beginning.  The only possible purpose of this film would have been to make money from the reputation of the first three; I sincerely hope that there won't be an Ice Age 5 if this is the direction in which they are going with them for the future.  It was truly poor.,1358208000,2,539,4.018691588785047
4824394,5,B005LAIISU,"This movie is great for the whole family.  We all laughed so hard our stomachs hurt.  The humor is not only geared towards children, but also adults as well.",1358208000,,157,4.379310344827586

4824396,5,B005LAIISU,"I've loved every Ice Age movie they've ever come out with. And this one just adds to the fun. I loved the the famous little skit tha Scrat does in the beginning, he never dissappoints! They should make a movie with Scrat as the lead character, it'd be hilarious! Ice age Continental Drift continues the family fun with all the origianl characters and more.",1358208000,,356,4.578125
4824397,1,B005LAIISU,"I'm really sorry. We loved the first one but each subsequent one keeps getting cheesier and cheesier. And, sad to say, less entertaining. Maybe we are just getting older and older.",1358208000,3,180,4.838709677419355
4824398,3,B005LAIISU,"The plot was too predictable. (Oh, except for the climax),  but the antics of the characters holds to the Ice Age tradition.",1358121600,,124,4.636363636363637
4824429,5,B005LAIISU,"My kids love all Ice Age movies and this one was just as wonderful. They can't take their eyes away, even for a few seconds.",1358121600,,124,4.0
4824430,1,B005LAIISU,"All I can say is please let this series die before it loses every last ounce of its dignity.  The first one was great, the others sequels less so and now with the arrival of the four hundred and forty fourth one, this series has hit an all time low.  This is just a weak movie all around.  When you pretty much know what the entire plot of the film is going to be in the first five minutes of the movie, you know you're in for a long boring, cliche ridden, been there done that, nothing remotely original sequel.  Spoiler alert, Manny and his daughter are reunited in the end and they're both sorry for what they said before they became separated.  Gee didn't see that one coming from like 200 miles away.  The only think I liked about this movie was ""Precious"" and even that character was not enough to save this awful cash grab.  Just like Shrek-this series seriously needs to end before they can milk it to death entirely .  Blue Sky Studios has done some incredibly original films over the years (Horton Hears a Who & Rio for instance), why they keep wasting time churning out more awful Ice Age sequels when they're capable of so much better is beyond me.  Oh yeah, the whole cash grab thing....  Regardless, it's time to move on please-Manny, Sid, Scrat and Diego need to be permanently retired.  They've even made Sid a boring character and I thought that was impossible.  I own the other three ice age movies, but I'm going to pass on this one.  Even before I had seen it, I had seen it all before if you catch my ""drift"".",1358121600,,1530,4.326315789473684

4824433,3,B005LAIISU,there were some funny parts but overall it was boring and predicable. i don't think i would buy it.... sad i rented it for 4 when i could have gone to redbox and gotten it for 1.  ohwell.... at least i didn't have to drive out in the snow.,1358121600,,239,3.877551020408163

4824436,3,B005LAIISU,"As the title says, I think the first one is by far the best.  This one carries the tradition of having Scrat steal the show but that's ok.  I thought it was worth watching but I don't plan to watch it again.",1358121600,,207,3.9047619047619047

4824462,5,B005LAIISU,"I chose this movie because I have watched the others and have enjoyed them as well.  Besides you just have to love the Teradactile (sp) type squirrel and the nut.

The dialog is super and entertaining.

I would caution anyone that has a data limitation, I have a Kindle Fire HD, and when i downloaded the HD version of the movie, it took a little over 3 gig, the clarity was supurb but be aware.

I liked most of new characters too and I am looking forward to meet at least few of them again, in the 5th movie set. The music however in the titles was bad. Probably some would like that kind of music, but I'd choose something else instead.

We pre-ordered through Amazon for his Christmas present.  We love the BluRay combo pack as we get the Blu Ray and the DVD version as well as the digital copy.  This way we can play it on our Sony PS3 or if we travel he can use his portable DVD player and enjoy it.

The movie is full of humor as well as adventure.  All ages will find this movie funny and enjoyable.  As with the previous Ice Age movies it portrays the importance of strong bonds with family and friends.",1357862400,3,608,4.016666666666667

4824559,4,B005LAIISU,"This one is not as good as the Dawn of the Dinosaurs.  My wife didn't care for it as she said it reminds her too much of Pirates of the Caribbean.  I think the film is a 6 out of 10; but, I think children under 12 would probably really like it.",1357776000,,244,3.673076923076923

All of the movies are as good as the rest, and this, the fourth movie of the series, is no exception. It is well worth getting to add to your movie collection.",1357776000,,322,3.893939393939394
4824567,3,B005LAIISU,"The story was more childish than than the other stories, but of course the characters did play their parts well and it was entertaining. I want my stories to have some premise in fact so that children can be taught things, not just be a bunch of jumbled events.  This was cute, but just jumbled events, thus the 3 star rating.",1357776000,,326,4.344262295081967

4824645,3,B005LAIISU,"Enjoyable, fun but not the best Ice Age film and we are fans of this series.
Story line aimed much more at childrean and their relationships with parents.
There were several send ups of other films and stories which keeps you on your toes, trying to spot the references.
Altogether a good family movie but not the full blown belly laugh, that we've experienced with earlier Ice Age movies.",1357603200,,389,4.6521739130434785

4824757,2,B005LAIISU,Did not enjoy this animation film because of the characters. No warmth in any of them which is disappointing for a children's film. Hard to get by the associations of the adult voices with previous characters they have played as well as the dialog. So many better choices out there.,1357516800,,282,4.66

It was PRECIOUS........",1357516800,,408,4.44

Lots of fighting, more than Ice Age 1 & 2 - so not a good movie for small children.  Parents will enjoy the comedy moments too.",1357516800,,262,3.943396226415094

4824786,4,B005LAIISU,As entertaining as usual.  Good family film.  Granny was the most entertaining.  Wanda Sykes always kills me with her portrayals.,1357430400,,129,5.35

4824843,5,B005LAIISU,Bought this for my grand daughter (5 y.o.) she loves watching Ice Age when she comes over (she comes over a lot). We sat down and watched the movie with her and it was a real fun movie to watch. We don't have a 3D TV (yet) so I can't really comment on that. We own all the Ice Age movies and we enjoy all of them.,1357430400,,313,3.6865671641791047

4824929,5,B005LAIISU,"Having kids means sometimes having to watch things suitable for them. The Ice Age movies have actually (suprisingly) been movies that I actually enjoy as an adult viewer. I have never been disappointed with any of the Ice Age movies. This edition still has the wonderful interplay of the characters, Manny, Syd, and Diego, in their unusual ""family"". A couple of new characters are added for this episode: Syd's granny, a pirate baboon, and a love interest for Diego. The humor is still wonderful and the message is still clear: Families come in all shapes and sizes (and individual members have their own strengths and weaknesses) and there is nothing more important than the family unit.",1357344000,,688,4.939655172413793

4824932,3,B005LAIISU,"Wish they had not moved away from the central characters so much.  Adding characters can be good, if they have depth and add to the mix, but this did not happen in this film.

Regardless, the kids and adults love it ... it's become a great franchise.",1357344000,,250,4.297872340425532
4824933,5,B005LAIISU,It was a great movie! Good storyline for kids and big kids! Only problem I had was it stopped in the middle of loading the movie and in the middle of watching it and so I ended up having to buy it again...,1357344000,,205,3.7906976744186047
4824934,4,B005LAIISU,This movie is a good addition to the Ice Age family of films.  It brings back the creativity and fun and that had started to go missing in the last movie.,1357344000,,154,3.967741935483871

4824989,3,B005LAIISU,"It wasn't as funny as the first, sequels usually aren't, but I would not recomend this version for one simple reason, the advertised audio of the Blue-Ray product is misleading as shown on the Amazon website. If you have 5.1 audio capability, and use it, you get a female voice describing the events as they happen. This is irritating to say the least. If you have 7.1 audio capability, you're OK, it is played without the description. If you select Spanish 5.1 or French 5.1, you're also OK, providing you understand Spanish or French. It's the English 5.1 that will drive you nuts. I assume that the Blue-Ray manufacturers want to ""encourage"" you to buy a new Blue-Ray player with 7.1 capability, buy a new amplifier with 7.1 capability and buy two new speakers so you don't have to listen to distracting inane chatter.
Oh, Scrat was great.",1357257600,,842,4.695945945945946

Bring on a group of pirates led by an evil ape captain.

4825026,4,B005LAIISU,"The sort of great humor, outstanding animation and entertaining storyline we know to expect from this series.  These movies have the fast action and slapstick humor that the kids love, and yet the sly, subtle humor us adults can enjoy, and some valuable life lessons for all of us.  And it was just the right length.

A good part of the fun for me was how the illustrators manage to make the characters look soooo much like the actors who portray them!",1357171200,,452,4.487804878048781

My daughter liked it, for some reason, and her taste in movies is not usually questionable but in this case, I'm not sure what she was thinking. Maybe she was sleepy and wasn't really watching.  If she was, she probably would have hated it like I did.",1357171200,,400,4.591549295774648

This is worth watching with your kids and enjoying a funny and well-designed film that you will all like. I thought that it was as good as the previous Ice Age films and I loved the antics of Scrat.

4825272,2,B005LAIISU,"I like the Ice Age films.  NOT love them, like them.  Between the first and third films I can not say a favorite out of them, I like them equally.

But, I have no problem as saying this 4th film was my least favorite of them.

Why was this film necessary?  Reused story lines.

Disappointing.

OK, we see the Peaches character introduced in the 3rd film as a teenager here.  Gee, my parents embarrass  me, they do not understand me.  Can we count how many times in TV shows & movies this storyline has been used?

A boring villain.  Making 2 groups to follow did NOT help, Manny, Diego & Sid together with Elle, Crash, Eddie & Peaches.

What was the storyline about from out of no where we have Sid's family?  Where did they come from, a storyline please film makers.

There is no need for any more Ice Age films, pretty soon they will be in 1969 with the cast of Men in Black",1356825600,,876,4.192771084337349

4825274,4,B005LAIISU,We have all of the Ice Age movies and had to add this one to our collection.  The grand kids have seen it along with other friends kids and they all love it.  I will gt a chance to see it when we get it back from being borrowed,1356825600,,227,3.6122448979591835
4825275,3,B005LAIISU,"This third movie in the series changes from the dynamics of the first two that targets the child and adult audiences mutually and shifts toward targeting the 10-15 year old sector. Many of the actors are hip hop stars and the dialogue is very ""teeny bopper"" in nature. Queen Latifah, Ray, and Dennis Leary manage to keep it at a tolerable level and it does have some very clever and cute parts.",1356825600,,394,4.486111111111111

4825312,3,B005LAIISU,"I wanted to watch it because I had seen all the rest of the Ice Age movies. Like all sequels, each additional one just doesn't seem to be as good as the original unless it is based on a really good book.

4825349,2,B005LAIISU,No even close to the first 2. There is no real story. Disjointed. Even scrat was not funny. The director lost track of the comedy from the first one,1356739200,,148,4.137931034482759

4825390,3,B005LAIISU,"Christmas present from family as I had enjoyed the first 3 so much, but was more than a little disappointed in this effort.  CGI is excellent, but the antagonist ape and crew are awful, can you say Jar Jar Binks???  Should have sent that whole idea to the trash can and found a different storyline.",1356652800,,298,4.4

4825394,4,B005LAIISU,"I liked Continental Drift.  It was funny and Manny has problems with his daughter growing up.  Poor Scrat always in search of his acorn and never gets the nut.  Although he does get bounced around a lot when trying to get his acorn.

They did leave it open when another Sabre Toothed Tiger came along.",1356652800,,301,4.418181818181818

4825421,3,B005LAIISU,While this movie is very kid friendly and there are some good one-liners it doesn't have the magic of the original. Of course this was not to say that it wasn't any good. The interaction of scrat and his nut is always a crowd pleaser.,1356652800,,234,4.222222222222222

They (our 3 kids...all under the age of 7) have watched this movie 4 times in a row(paid for itself already)! This is not the norm with our purchases.

4825424,3,B005LAIISU,"As an adult I've always liked the Ice Age movies, but I didn't like this one so much. This one seems to be geared mostly to the pre-teens/teens. Peaches is attracted to a boy Mammoth, does a bad thing to her best friend, etc.. The bullying thing comes into play as well as to like others that are not of your kind,........why do they keep shoving that down peoples throats? There is still some comedy in the movie, but ........well I don't know. See for yourself if you want, but like I said mostly for the kids if you want to let them watch it. These guys can make better movies than this, and I was really hoping for a movie length Christmas Movie, the one last year of a whole 25 minutes just didn't get it!",1356566400,,710,4.189781021897811

4825467,3,B005LAIISU,What I didn't like was having to wait until the price came down to rent it. It was going for $15 (I guess to buy it) when I only wanted to watch it. I didn't like feeling made to buy it.,1356480000,,186,3.5609756097560976

4825473,2,B005LAIISU,"Why is it that often sequels of witty, original animated films get more juvenile as they age into number III and IV?

when we watched it at the theater, i couldn't remember all the new one's name!

4825606,3,B005LAIISU,"This Ice Age 4 was more zany, crazy, and over-the-top than any of the earlier Ice Age movies.  Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs was my most favorite and the only version I wanted to own a copy of, on DVD.

The movie company did not make Ice Age 4: Continental Drift available to rent on the day the DVD was released so, out of impatience, I purchased a DVD copy for the sole purpose of seeing this movie for the first time.

Even though it had outlandish geological events and crazy situations and outcomes, I still like it as my second favorite Ice Age movie because I like Manny's mammoth family, who's daughter is now a teenager, and I'm glad that the Saber Cat, Diego, finally got a female partner though, the film could have spent more time developing their relationship.

I like the continuing concept in the series of ""We are a herd.""  ""Herds look out for each other.""  This aspect of the stories gives me a warm feeling inside.

The movie may grow on me enough to compel me to keep the DVD, I purchased or, I may sell it used on Amazon Marketplace.",1355529600,,1056,4.303030303030303
4825607,5,B005LAIISU,"Ice Age-Continental Drift(released June/12)has the usual voice talents of Ray Romano as Manny,John Leguizamo as Sid,Denis Leary as Diego,Queen Latifah as Ellie,along with some newcomers like Keke Palmer as Peaches,Jennifer Lopez as Shira,Wanda Sykes as Granny,and even the dynamic duo of Nick Frost and Simon Pegg. This is,for my money,THE best of the series so far. It has adventure,it has excitement,it has laughs and it is all non stop family fun!
The story finds Scrat starting out the proceedings,as usual. This time his well placed nut begins the Continental Drift that forms the land masses we have today. This sudden change in earth tectonics has Manny,Ellie and the gang on the run for safety to the land bridge. Manny's precious Peaches has now grown up and is quite the young teenaged lady. Thrown into the mix comes Sid's family,slip sliding away in a hollowed out log. They crash into the group and only stay long enough to dump Sid's granny onto them,and then leave.
Before the group can reach the land bridge,Manny,Sid,Granny,and Diego are separated from the rest by a sudden upheaval of ice. As they drift away from Ellie and Peaches,Manny tells them to head for the land bridge and that they will return to find them.
Not long after their separation Manny and the gang`s ice flow is captured by pirates,led by an ape called Gutt. He commands a rag tag group of animals indeed,from an elephant seal to a rabbit. When they make granny walk the plank,the group spring into action and rescue her. The group escapes from Gutt but in the process sink his large ice ship. A little ways away they rescue one of Gutts crew,a female saber toothed tiger named Shira,and keep her locked up. When they reach land Shira escapes and runs to rejoin Gutt and his crew,who are in a nearby cove planning to take the current back to land in a newly acquired ice ship. With the help of some new found friends,in the forms of over sized hamsters,they trick Gutt and his gang and steal his ship from him. As Manny and the rest sail away Gutt is already creating another ship to pursue them.
Manny and the group reach the land bridge but at first do not find Ellie or Peaches. Suddenly a voice rings out and it`s Peaches;being held captive by Gutt,who has unfortunately beaten them home. Granny has an ace up her sleeve. On their way home she had been throwing fruit into the water to,what the group thought,was her imaginary friend. It turns out it was a ginormous whale,who she now calls upon to help. Manny and Gutt have a final showdown and Manny and his family are finally reunited. As a giant propeller,there is nothing that will get an ice boat across an ocean faster than a whale. They finally find new land,with the hamsters also joining them. The newest members of the herd are now Granny and Shira,Diego`s new girlfriend.
The film ends as Scrat finds his version of the lost city of Atlantis;called Scrat-lantis. Nuts abound,which he ferociously gathers up. However the centre piece is a giant nut and he is told by the elder there(Patrick Stewart) not to touch it. Scrat of course cannot fight his instincts,and lifts it up. Underneath dangles a plug. The island sinks,dries and becomes part of the south western U.S. desert. Scrat screams as the blistering heat starts to scorch him.
There are just so many funny and imaginative moments throughout this film as it moves from one thing to another in such fine fashion. I just loved the scene where the gang are drifting on an ice pack and Sid complains that there is so much water,and so little to drink. He takes a big gulp of sea water and swallows it. His face puckers right up as he realizes how salty it is. It is visually hilarious to see. They have added so much more voice talent to this movie along with,what looks like,some new and welcome additions to the herd. I like that.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a featurette on its making,a look at the series so far,and a couple of musical segments.
All in all,what can I say,I loved this film. It has a pace like no other in the franchise and it just never stopped moving throughout. The film is chock full of imaginative storytelling,adventure and its requisite sight gags. It is also a film the whole family can watch together and understand. Recommended highly.",1355529600,,4342,4.66232073011734

4825612,2,B005LAIISU,"The content has shfted from being more centered in the real world of the Ice Age, and has drawn far too much from recent culture: hip hop, teen angst current pop references and a gooey amount of emotional sugar poured over it. Gone are the arguments and vinager that made the first three more involving and funnier. The awareness that kids are going to be watching has made this entry more preachy, and ,and  three fingers in the throat for the adults watching. Only Scrat remains untouched.

4825663,2,B005LAIISU,"This is one of those movies where the producer is trying so hard to be politically correct it spoils the film. The cast of black actors ( in voice only of course), bleeds through the animated characters. Instead of enjoying the film all you hear are that stereo typical ""black speak"" not quite ebonics but that sassy uppity type speach. It is irritating.

I think we need some more white characters especially ones with the distinctive voices of the classic films such as Disney. Very black type voices such as eddie murphy work well as a seasoning. When we see the donkey on shrek we smile in anticipation of knowing that we will hear that mamie type voice.",1354147200,9,658,4.576271186440678

4825677,5,B005LAIISU,"The 411 by Maria and Goddess:

We don't care what they say, we thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

This being the 4th installment of Ice Age, we thought it was as funny and it kept us watching and my 7 year old laughing which is no better advertisement for me.

The movie as much as it is fun, witty, violent at times (cruelty to animals among the other animals) is about family, friends, working together and supporting each other.

When Manny, the character voiced by Ray Romano, Diego (Denis Leary), Sid (John Leguizamo) and Granny (by far my favorite character) voiced by Wanda Sykes suddenly find themselves on a drifting iceberg they do whatever they can to take care of each other and get back to their family and friends.

Their journey is dangerous and made even more complicated by Captain Gutt an ape voiced by Peter Dinklage (I was wondering who was voicing that ape!).

All in all, we found it entertaining and loved to see Scrat trying to get that darn acorn!

Today when Goddess finishes her homework, I am going to set her up with some online Ice Age games. She is going to love them.",1353283200,,1096,4.505050505050505

If you are looking for a movie that will keep you laughing from beginning to end with a great cast of characters (both new and old) this is definitely the movie that you should be turning to!

I feel like they tried very hard to usurp him into the screen time much more, however I think the magic is gone from the herd of various animals sticking together.  The only character which doesnt currently drive me nuts to hear their voice is John Leguiziamo.

We saw it twice in the theater, we enjoyed it that much! When it came out on Blu-ray/DVD (which I got for Christmas), we enjoyed it even more!

The plot: Sid, Manny and Diego are definitely in for the ride of their lives when they met a set of pirates, and Diego gets a girlfriend (voiced by J-Lo!).

If you liked Pirates of the Carribean and if you love the Ice Age movies, you'll love Ice Age 4: Continental Drift!",1350000000,32,589,4.20353982300885
4825681,5,B005LAIISU,"Went to see this latest version of Ice Age on July 13, 2012 along with a 5 and 11 year old girls and their Grandpa. Grandpa fell asleep with 10 min's of the movie beginning (due to the HOT TX. weather outside!) and the 5 year old was interested...on/off! But myself and the 11 year old loved it!! She can hardly wait until the DVD (or Blu-Ray) comes out so I can buy it for her! I also liked the Ice Age Christmas DVD but as the kids said..""it was too short""!!
I HOPE there will be more future versions coming out!! It's refreshing to see a movie that doesn't have all the violence, bang-bang, shoot them or blown them up or High-Speed chases in it!! No wonder kids now-a-days are 'messed up' (to put it mildly) and bullies!!! Violence in the Movies, TV and Video Games! Oh, We saw this movie at our local theatre and NOT on Blu-Ray.",1349568000,4,833,4.2125
4825682,1,B005LAIISU,"This is one of the moives that I can put in the I will never see it again group. That is the way how the acting was done. Both side are mean each other. The girl is mean to her father who is trying to her out and she is mean to her best friend and say,"" That he is never her friend"" when she meets and talk to the boy. At the end it is her best friend the one that she say ""That he is never her friend"" that save her. The ones that get a ship, are mean to each other. All I can say is ""That is other movie that I should have never use my money on and to see it. It was not funnying it was very mean and very hurtful that they acted. I wanted to get up and get my money back but I do not. If I could I give this moive NO STAR AT ALL. I WILL NEVER SEE THIS AGAIN!!!",1347321600,3,763,3.4678362573099415
