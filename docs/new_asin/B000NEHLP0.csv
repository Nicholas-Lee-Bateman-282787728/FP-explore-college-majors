2768344,5,B000NEHLP0,great movie...Janet Leigh is just so beautiful in this film,1478822400,,59,5.0
2768345,4,B000NEHLP0,"Norman Mailer disowned this film. Understanding Norman, I understand why. An American Dream is often listed among the worst cinema efforts.
In truth this film is a snap shot of Los Angeles in the 1960's. The look of mid century LA is disappearing daily. The actors are ""TV"" actors of the era.
Looked at that way, An American Dream is the mid 1960's at its best and deserving of re-evaluation.",1415059200,,392,4.614285714285714
2768346,5,B000NEHLP0,"Eleanor Parker deserved an oscar for this performance.
However I do question some of the costume choices that were made for Janet Leigh's character.",1391817600,,148,5.208333333333333
2768347,5,B000NEHLP0,i had no idea that everyone in houston either wears an xxl white tee shirt or an xxl black tee shirt everywhere they go. must make getting dressed in the morning a no brainer.,1368057600,,175,4.176470588235294
2768348,1,B000NEHLP0,"Not only is this movie poorly made (even for its time), but it doesn't follow the book by Norman Mailer at all -- completely different ending. I definitely regret wasting 103 minutes on this movie.",1362700800,,197,4.6571428571428575
2768349,5,B000NEHLP0,i loved the casting and storyline. i was impressed with director tony abulu and the entire cast. story was about a nigerian boy that wants to leave the country by all means to enter Us,1356393600,,184,4.285714285714286
2768350,5,B000NEHLP0,"An American Dream is so bad it's good ! Eleanor  Parker has to be seen and heard to believed in a scene of pure bitchery. Other Hollywood stars are in this also but she makes the show ! Janet Leigh looks gorgeous, and plays a very tough girl role, a nightclub singer who is a real piece of work. Lovers of trashy,campy films will like this the most.",1354665600,3,349,4.132352941176471
2768351,2,B000NEHLP0,"This is the long awaited (by some at least) movie about Mike Jones and how he got his start in the rap game. We knew going in that it wouldn't be Oscar worthy, but we were hoping for at least some unintentional comedy. It was disappointing to say the least, hard to get through and really almost unwatchable.",1319932800,,308,4.327586206896552
2768352,4,B000NEHLP0,"[AN AMERICAN DREAM - (1966) - Widescreen presentation - Directed by Robert Gist]  First comes the engagement ring, next the wedding ring, then the suffering, followed by the slandering, finally the murdering. These are the five rings of matrimony, as delivered to us by Norman Mailer's novel via this schlocky, campy, sleazy celluloid sewage. It's absolutely marvelous in a John Waters meets Jacqueline Suzanne by way of Otto Preminger kitschy kind of way. Those of you enjoying such delightful dumpster diving know who you are, the rest of you need not apply.

Stuart Whitman is near-awful as a star here; he's no kind of leading man, more of a second-rate second banana and comes off as the guy you just can't wait to witness being destroyed. It almost happens immediately, but then we'd have little to snicker over, so Eleanor Parker bites it instead. She's magnificent as the vindictive rich bitch of a wife who just has to go down - literally, from the penthouse terrace. She's missed as soon as she's written off, unfortunately, as I had hoped there would be flashbacks with much more of her hormonal hysterics and malicious mouth-offs. Too bad. Barry Sullivan is subtly efficient as the police detective who wants to lock him up but isn't 100% certain he killed his carnivorous wife; however, his assistant is completely convinced and tears after him like Nancy Grace after Casey Anthony. Just when I had doubts about this purchase, in strolls Janet Leigh, looking absolutely scrumptious as the jilted lover from Whitman's past, pretty much insuring he has no future. She's a nightclub singer who dates a mobster, so the moment Whitman cries on her sexy, exposed shoulder we know events will ultimately become as cheery as Father's day at an orphanage. It's wonderful to watch people passionately screw their lives up royally from the security of our sofas, isn't it? For me, it was Janet Leigh's presence that kept my finger off the fast-forward remote; besides, by this point I couldn't wait to see Whitman self-destruct, in spite of the fact that there was literally a two-bit hit taken out on him after he ticked-off a table of racketeers at a poker game earlier on. Not so much a murder mystery as it is a probable-outcome parable in the path of a pathetic prime-time talking head who never knew when to shut up until someone did it for him, and we're grateful someone did while we could watch. It's 'An American Dream', baby...",1311206400,13,2440,4.8349282296650715

8177491,1,B000NEHLP0,This was not the Janet Leigh film or any of the other films with 'American Dream' in the title that some of the other reviews are referencing. This was a poorly acted film with amateur camera work & a lackluster soundtrack (voice & music) that may or may not have had a point. Stopped it at 27 minutes.,1522454400,,302,4.224137931034483
8177492,5,B000NEHLP0,we root for the under dog. the acting was good because it feels true to life. we want  them to reach for the stars and follow their dreams . much of the music is gospel and inspiring about god and faith .if they can jump over hurtles they inspire others in the same predicament to follow suit .the little girl in the movie is so sweet loved how she read a classic children's  book about kittens that lost their mittens  THEIR future is being tested  but they must follow the right path regardless of their circumstances see it and you too will feel the soul of the movie or message,1519171200,,581,4.254545454545455

8177498,2,B000NEHLP0,"Trash, but trash with a certain pedigree. Ordinarily Stuart Whitman should not be compared with the can't take your eyes off them greats and there's nothing here to make you think otherwise, but in spite of it all it does possess a certain something...Janet Leigh? Maybe.",1491264000,,271,4.913043478260869
