6775721,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"If the story of the alliance between London LGBT activists and striking Welsh miners were fiction, it would be unbelievable.  To know that the events of the movie actually happened makes it joyful and a source of pride in the human capacity for compassion and change.  Of course, the timing of events at the beginning of the AIDS epidemic is cause for sober reflection.  The music and singing only add to the enjoyment.",1417392000,16,419,4.712328767123288
6775722,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"Fantastic movie, one which the distributors here in the US should have paid more to market.  It's a shame about the short run it had here in US theaters, even in big cities like my Chicago.  I was inspired to read up on the true story afterwards.",1417392000,8,246,4.212765957446808
6775723,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"I rarely comment on videos I watch on Amazon but I thought this fantastic bit of historical comedy/drama deserves a special shout out. The historical context and background is spot on. The film captures the essence of the time, the movement and political atmosphere that was driving both the UK and great parts of the world perfectly. From character development to excellent casting, acting, soundtrack and story this film is an all around winner. I could find little to complain about. I have - and will continue to - recommend this great piece of movie making to friends and family.",1417305600,7,584,4.85
6775724,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"It would be indeed unfortunate if only members of the LGBT community see this incredible movie PRIDE since its message is for everyone. Although much of what we see is not new to us, it is always good to be reminded of what life was once like for many of us before we could get married--at least on this side of the Atlantic--in 30 or 35 states and the number grows daily. For instance, when Mark Ashton (played by Ben Schnetzer) asks members of his rag-tag group of nine gay men and three vegetarian kick-a-- lesbians who in the group has not been called a ""pervert"" by homophobes, I suspect that every gay and lesbian in the art theatre where I recently saw this wonderful film would have answered in the affirmative had they been asked the same question.

Directed by Matthew Warchus with a screenplay by Steven Beresford, PRIDE is based on actual events in 1984 and 1985 when twenty-seven gays and lesbians (twelve in the movie) from London supported the striking miners of South Wales and raised eleven thousand pounds for their cause. After seeing this film that only conjures up superlatives, I wanted to know what was real and what wasn't. I was gratified to find from a long well-written and informative article in the GUARDIAN that the director and writer changed little. Several of the people from that time, both from the gay and lesbian community and striking miners, who had seen the film testified as to its basic authenticity.  (One fictional addition is the character Joe, played by George MacKay, who is the young man hiding his sexuality from his parents as he becomes radicalized for both the cause of gay rights and miners' rights as well. While he may be a work of fiction, his character rings completely true as many of us have walked in his shoes.)

The actors to a person give stellar performances:  Ben Schetzer as Mark Ashton, Dominic West as Jonathan Blake, George MacKay  as Joe,  Joe Gilgun as Mike Jackson, Paddy Considine  as Dai Donovan  and Jessica Gunning as Sian James. The minor characters, however, are just as good  The soundtrack is memorable, and I defy anyone to remain dry-eyed when a character starts singing ""Bread and Roses,"" the song that Judy Collins  recorded in 1976. This moving song is from a poem for workers' and women's rights that James Oppenheim wrote in 1911 and that Mimi Farina set to music later.

The messages in this not-to-be missed film are clear: we are all in this together. One oppressed minority should support another, in this instance, the gay and lesbian community in London, LMSM, and the striking miners-- or in the words of the then Prime Minister, ""the enemy within."" Furthermore, the film reinforces what many of us have figured out early on, that we in the LGBT community make our own families that have nothing to do with blood type, skin color, sex or the shape of our eyes.

I would put this movie in my best of films with gay and lesbian characters that include MILK, THE SUM OF US and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. As the credits rolled, I was surprised to see that the movie got an R rating. I'm not sure why.",1416528000,43,3083,4.626373626373627
6775725,4,B00OY7YOZ2,"Heartwarming and heartbreaking in equal measure, Pride is one of those films that the British makes so well. Take a moment in recent history where people are suffering and add a pinch of humour and you have a film that ranks easily alongside the likes of Full Monty, East is East, Brassed Off, Billy Elliott, etc.

Pride focuses on a period of time during the 1984 Miners Strike. A group of gays and lesbians decide to work together to raise funds for a small mining community. The reason? Like them, the miners have become outcasts and social misfits and they see they share a common bond. Of course, the small mining community in Wales that they decide to donate to initially have other ideas about the group of 'perverts' that descend upon them. Eventually, and as history dictates, the two do come together to raise even more funds although there are those in the Welsh village who will do anything to stop the degredation and embarrassment they feel the gay group are creating.

There are some great performances in the film, none more so from the two leads - Ben Schnetzer as the out and proud leader of the group Mark who forms the LGSM group (Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners) and George MacKay as Joe (or Bromley as he's affectionately known by his group) who still lives at home and in his closet with his parents. Both of these characters take dramatic and shocking twists and turns by the end of the film. There's lots of humour to be found in the characters played by Bill Nighy, Dominic West and Imelda Staunton, and they deliver some great one liners.

The music soundtrack is fantastic with the likes of Dead or Alive, King, The Smiths and Bronski Beat, and the setting and outfits look suitable for the period. The final song played is For a Friend by the Communards which is one of the greatest songs to lost loved ones ever written, and will give you an idea as to the very end of the movie. Amongst the humour is of course not just the final nails in the coffins of the mining community, but homphobia as well as the threat of Aids that was brought into public attention around that time too.

Despite all this praise there are a couple of little niggles that include the fact that when the LGSM group first visit the Wales community they are immediately shunned by many, but only a few minutes later in the film (only a day or two later) they're all dancing and singing together. There doesn't seem to be much credibilty about this as there seems very little struggle for them to be accepted into this hostile community. Also there are just too many characters, pretty much all of them you can care about one way or another, but i'd have happily seen some of the other characters vanish and have more time in the company of Bill Nighy or Freddie Fox, as it is, some of them are just slightly more than extended cameos

Whether this will become as succesful as some the other now classic films I listed above remains to be seen, but is deserving of a couple of hours of your time. I actual left the cinema in tears at the end but that's a sign of a good film that can move you in that way",1416268800,59,3112,4.424083769633508
6775726,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"I've seen this film a number of times and really love it. It's really a feel good film, showing what can happen when people put their biases aside. I especially like that it's based on a true story. The actors are wonderful. The story's true. What more can one ask for?!",1528329600,,270,4.313725490196078
6775727,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"This is in my TOP 5 of all-time favorite movies.  Yes, it is about English gays and lesbians supporting, literally raising funds, for striking Welsh miners; however, it really has little to do with defining gays, lesbians and Welsh miners.  Based on mid-1980's events in England, the true theme is people reaching out with helping hands and caring hearts to ease the suffering of others.  The compassion of Mark Ashton, as well as his friends and associates, for the oppressed miners sparked a movement that undeniably changed, for the better, our world.",1528329600,,554,5.0
6775728,5,B00OY7YOZ2,Awesome movie.  No down or dull points.  Great actors.,1527552000,,54,4.888888888888889

6775735,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"A genuinely inspiring story that never allows itself to sink into maudlin wallowing.  It's all about the spirit of coming together to support someone you don't necessarily think you'd have something in common with, and the impact that welcoming 'the other' can have - something we are very desperately in need of only 30 years on.",1520553600,,330,4.892857142857143

6775737,1,B00OY7YOZ2,"We go back to England in the 1980s when the bogey thatcher was destroying anything that made life enjoyable in britain.

 Remember: ""there's no such thing as Society...../ Yes I am an iron-maiden""

That's where this 'historical' movie begins. Apparently there were a group of welsh miners that went on strike due to thatcher's scraping of unionisation or anything giving control of any sort to the worker (commies), so a group of London lesbians and gays banded together to help them with donations. this group was the LGSM - Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners. if your looking for stereotypes of both groups YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.
the smiths/bronski beat/communards/yazoo/etcetera (in fact any band remotely affiliated to the lgbtabcdefg community gets an airing.

All  human experience is valid. As for the movie itself it doesn't amount to anything other than hand wringing and an excuse to show what a group of 'misfits' were up to back in the eighties. At least one of the miners' wives got something out of it all - if not the miner's themselves.",1515888000,,1061,4.905027932960894

6775740,4,B00OY7YOZ2,"Recommended: this is a heart-warming true-life story about the struggle of coal miners against the Margaret Thatcher government in 1984. Thatcher's agenda was to starve the unions.

A young group of lesbian & gay activists in London adopt these Welsh miners in the west. I won't tell you the outcome, but there's great pathos in the gays & miners' struggles.

The R-rated film really deserves your attention.",1511136000,,408,5.074626865671642

6775750,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"Outstanding film. The only question is - why is it rated R? Is it because of lesbians and gays, the miner unions, or their synergy?",1500768000,,131,4.28

6775753,5,B00OY7YOZ2,What did London gays and Welsh coal miners have in common in 1980s Britain? This heart-warming story will explore that theme in very human terms. Much more to say but don't want to spoil it for you. True story too!,1498262400,,214,4.375

6775766,3,B00OY7YOZ2,"Bill Nighy was the attraction to purchase this, wished he had a bigger role.  The theme nice but a bit too 'trite'.  Very much like the 'mutual support' as the connecting thread and hope for greater understanding for all people.  Maybe the characters needed more development.  Big fan of Bill Nighy..he brings the characters alive but this film didn't seem to allow that.",1493683200,,371,4.841269841269841

6775769,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"Wow! Totally worth the watch. Love me some Imelda Staunton and she did not disappoint. I am stingy with my 5 stars but sometimes you just have to hit the button as soon as the movie is over and this is one of those times. If you loved movies like ""The Full Monty"" & ""Kinky Boots"" this movie is for you. I am also a big fan of Bill Nighy but his role sort of limited what I know he can bring. That being said, he played this part just right. I found myself imagining life in a a town where he was my friend. (I am straight but would have still stood out). I found myself reading about the events as I am American and did not know the full history. The entire cast was wonderful, and even with ""artistic license"" the story drew me in.

6775776,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"I am a 60 year old heterosexual woman who has been married for almost 30 years.  I bring up that I am hetero not to distance myself from gays (why would I want to do that?) but to make the point that you do not have to be gay to love this movie, only human.  I remember this turbulent time well.  My best friend from high school came out of the closet in 1974 and I only loved him more (in a sisterly way) for his bravery.  He went on to finish his doctorate after losing his mate and while succumbing to HIV himself in his late 20's.  I still grieve for him and other friends but have always been inspired by his tenacity for life.  When I watch a movie like this I remember the bright lives that were lost.

In further critique of the film, I thought ALL the cast was superior.  Although the film sounds dark, it actually was filled with humor.  I was glad to see Dominic West in a role besides a philandering husband having only seeing him in ""The Hour"" (great show!) and ""The Affair"" (watched 1 season, lost interest).  I felt this role allowed him to show his range and capabilities.  Bill Nighy has always impressed me as well as Paddy Considine and Imelda Staunton.  I also thought that newcomers (to me at least) Ben Schnetzer and George Mackay were excellent.  Really, all the actors were great!  Kudos!",1484438400,5,1312,4.302040816326531
6775777,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"OK, full disclosure - I'm a Brit and the only reason i bought this on Amazon.com (as opposed to Amazon.co.uk) is that it was a gift for an American friend.

This is the sort of film we Brits do rather well. Based on a true story - and not that far away from the truth either although Joe (""Bromley"") is entirely fictitious. It captures the mood of the times and the battles we fought back then. Most of all it captures the friendships that were built on the picket lines and the way the miner's strike changed all those who lived through it.

But maybe that overblows it. It's a fun, feelgood movie that makes you go ""ahh"" at the end and what's wrong with that.",1484352000,,661,4.238095238095238

6775808,4,B00OY7YOZ2,"PRIDE is one of those films which makes you realize that the cinema as an art form can still be highly political without sacrificing other qualities such as story, plot, and characterization.

In terms of subject-matter it resembles Mark Harmon's BRASSED OFF (1996), as it tells of the effect of the miners' strike of 1985-6 on a local community threatened with pit closures. In the earlier film the subject centered on a brass band; in PRIDE director Matthew Warchus looks at the ways in which a South Welsh community reacts to the help offered them by a London-based group Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners.

The initial reaction might be to recall Matt Lucas's classic running gag in the television comedy LITTLE BRITAIN, where he played Dafydd Thomas, ""the only gay in the village."" Perhaps, predictably the Welsh villagers resent the group's presence among them - especially the aggressively masculine miners who feel that gays somehow threaten their status as opinion-formers. Yet such opinions soon change, due in no small part to the efforts of the wives, led by Hefina (Imelda Staunton) and supported by closet gay Cliff (Bill Nighy). In the end everyone comes together in a show of support for the miners, even though their cause is ultimately hopeless.

While the feelgood factor is obviously high, as director Matthew Warchus shows how people of different socio-economic backgrounds learn to accommodate one another in a show of solidarity, we cannot help but feel angry at what happened to the mining communities as a result of Prime Minister Thatcher's policies. Coal-mining as an industry might have been expensive to maintain, but there was really no excuse to impose such a swingeing program of pit-closures that destroyed individuals' lives. The motivation was entirely political: the Conservative government wanted to extinguish the power of the trade unions, especially the National Union of Mineworkers led by Arthur Scargill, and were prepared to go to any lengths to achieve their aims. By doing so they helped to create the social and regional inequalities that persist in contemporary British society.

In hindsight films such as PRIDE show how pointless such policies actually were. The only real result was to deprive working people of their livelihoods and destroy long-established communities. And that is not really much of a legacy for any government.",1472256000,,2385,5.170984455958549

It was a little slow at first getting going but picked up like a rolling stone down a hill (and that is meant in a great way).  By the end of the movie I was just SHOCKED at what these people had accomplished and truly admired the lead character Mark Ashton (real life name).  I equate him to the likes of Martin Luther King.  Yes, that's right!  MLK preached that progress came from love not hate.  MLK knew his people had to take the high road even when his enemy was on the low one.  Mark Ashton recognized the same same.  Even though it took a team of gay people to ultimate accomplish what came to be in the end, it was one man's vision who set that rolling stone in motion.",1464566400,7,952,4.097297297297297

PRIDE is inspired by an extraordinary true story.  Its the summer of 1984, Margaret Thatcher is in power and the National Union of Mineworkers is on strike, prompting a London-based group of gay and lesbian activists to raise money to support the strikers families.  Initially rebuffed by the Union, the group identifies a tiny mining village in Wales and sets off to make their donation in person.  As the strike drags on, the two groups discover that standing together makes for the strongest union of all.",1460937600,,720,4.515384615384615

The power of unity is the overriding theme among the groups involved in this fight, the gays, the miners and the union, up against the homophobes, the mine owners and the media.  But that's what works so well:  good people joining forces, fighting for their rights vs. prejudice, greed and sensationalism - it's so satisfying to see the good lance a few of the boils on the ass of society.  The characters are diverse and not overly stereotyped, the soundtrack fits, and it is well-acted across the board.  (Then again, where Nighy is, a good movie usually follows. I don't know what it is but I've rarely seen any actors give a bad performance when he's in the cast.)  The power of this movie is in the story, the real story of this struggle, and fortunately all those involved in the film's creation give life to that power.

Pride isn't groundbreaking, but it shows an important part of history -- not just LGBTQIA history, but British and labor-rights history as well. And if you pay attention, there are important lessons for people today.  You can look up the story easily, but watch the film first.  It will make you wonder how much was accomplished because of someone noticing common ground.

The performances are engaging, with the usual, outstanding performances by Bill Nighy, Imelda Staunton, and Andrew Scott.  The standout performances are George MacKay as the earnest Joe, and the luminous Ben Schnetzer as Mark.

Of the movies I am aware of that deal with the British Miners' strike under Prime Minister Thatcher, this may be my favorite (the others being Billy Elliot and Brassed Off). It is in-your-face gay, so if this bothers or offends you then avoid this movie. However, the character development, acting, and superb cast have completely won me. One scene in particular, with the haunting song ""Bread and Roses,"" is one I play over and over, even if I don't watch the whole movie.

Once again Bill Nighy turns in an unusual performance and Imelda Staunton was a hoot as well as a warm and no-nonsense kind of woman. Each member of the cast is exceptional.

6775933,3,B00OY7YOZ2,"Fact-based 'Pride' was released in 2014, but the events it depicts took place 30 years earlier, in England.

On the day of the London Pride Parade we meet (entirely fictitious) Joe (George MacKay). He's snuck away from his home in Bromley to watch the Parade & maybe even (gasp!) meet other gay men. Almost immediately he's seized upon by a participant (Tony, played by Matthew Finn) to assist in carrying a banner. Meanwhile, charismatic Mark (Ben Schnetzer) has seen a news item about the striking coal workers being beaten up by the police. Instantly he decides to spearhead a fundraising group for the miners. After all, aren't they being subjected to the same types of pressure that gays & lesbians have long experienced?

Steph (Faye Marsay) is initially the only lesbian who joins. Exiled Welshman Gethin (Andrew Scott) owns a bookstore where the group meets. His partner, flamboyant Jonathan (Dominic West) initially rejects joining them, until the day when it's time to go meet the miners in Wales.

And who ARE the miners that accept their support? It's the village of Onllwyn, in the Dulais Valley of Wales. An older, open-minded lady named Hefina (Imelda Staunton) happens to answer the phone when the group calls, & welcomes them to the fold. She has Dai (Paddy Considine) go to London to meet them. Initially shy, he soon warms up to being shown around the town.

Bill Nighy ably portrays hesitant Cliff, a deeply-closeted (or so he thinks) gay man residing in Onllwyn. Sian (Jessica Gunning) has just recently joined the committee, & can't understand what all the fuss is about....But trouble rears its' ugly head in the deeply homophobic character of Maureen (Lisa Palfrey).

The events 'Pride' portrays are a vital part of recent LGBT history. The storyline involving fictitious Joe is absolutely unnecessary & a distraction to the real events depicted onscreen. Written by Stephen Beresford, the film stands up to repeated viewings. I've only ranked it a '3' since Amazon doesn't allow fractions, but if you have any interest in the Gay Pride movement you'll want to see this film.",1442620800,,2099,4.968660968660969

And what subplots there are - work within the overall theme. Good movie! The acting is superb and Bill Nighy is an absolute delight to watch. I'm so used to him being so ""out there"" and larger than life sometimes - but in this movie - he reels it in. At first, I didn't even realize it was HIM!!!! And Imelda is fabulous while Ben Schnetzer is strong and confidant in one of the lead roles.

I need to some research to learn if all of this is really true; it's really hard to imagine it is.

6776018,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"Only the most ardent Thatcher conservative could dislike this superb film set around the tumultuous 1984 British coal miners strike.
Although played as a comedy drama, the filmmakers have not shied away from presenting the importance of the factual  events of the time.
The story unites two disparate groups: the working class coal miners of a small Welsh village and a  band of London gay rights activists who decide to collect funds for the strikers.  Strange bedfellows you may surmise, but in reality these two groups had very much in common.  The miners were suffering immense economic repression and their gay counterparts, still experiencing social and legal repression.  Both parties were also victims of the intolerance from the arch Thatcher government and the rants of the British gutter press.
A wonderfully inspiring film which is totally absorbing throughout its two hour running time.  The cast is flawless with stand out performances from Imelda Staunton (who can't love this beautiful actress?), Bill Nighy, Paddy Considine and Ben Schnetzer (love that groovy haircut!) but even the smallest role in this large cast has been thoughtfully chosen and superbly played.
A darker side of life glimpses through with this film as life in the coal mining towns of Wales (and all of the U.K.) face a devastating future and the scourge of AIDS starts to make inroads into the gay community.
The featurette accompanying the film is well worth a look as we encounter many of the real people of the story, sometimes with the actors who portrayed them with some very interesting reflections.  We also learn what happened to them after the strike and there are some very inspirational stories  and one very sad one.
For people interested in the British labor movement and/or gay history, this movie is a must.  For others, it is an excellent film and great entertainment.",1434499200,6,1873,5.035598705501618

6776032,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"Potential spoilers.  During Margaret Thatcher's political reign over the U.K. in the 1980's, one of labors' big events was the strike of the mineworkers.  In London, another group was trying to find equality.  Surprisingly, a small movement by a section of the gay and lesbian community, led to a broad national coalition of unity and solidarity.

Mark (Ben Schnetzer) is the defacto leader and decides their little group should begin soliciting donations to help the miners weather the lengthy strike.  Even with some defections, Mark and his group known as ""Lesbians and Gays Supporting the Miners"" (L.G.S.M.) collect enough money to make a donation.  Rather than send it to the national organization, Mark decides they should pick just one local group from one small town.  A town in Wales is picked at random and by accident get a meeting with the union leader Dai Donovan (Paddy Considine).  While Dai is a bit surprised by the notion that his supporters are gay, he is fine with it and invites the group to come to his village and speak to the striking miners.  With trepidation they agree and make the trip.

The idea of miners and gays getting together for a common agenda, sounds very strange and even dangerous.  But after a few meetings and with the help of some of the town's leaders, Sian (Jessica Gunning), Hefina (Imelda Staunton), Cliff (Bill Nighy) and others, most of the town accepts the groups' money and friendship.  Of course, there's always a few bad apples that want to ruin the party, but the film avoids violent confrontations for the most part.  The film, directed by Matthew Warchus, deftly focuses more on the fairness for all issue and solidarity for those oppressed rather than ""gay pride.""  Frankly that fact, disturbs some of the gay community once the effort gets national attention.

While the film has a serious tone, Warchus delivers it with a light touch most of the time.  There are some funny scenes involving the lesbians and an older white-haired woman.  And still others when a group of matrons goes with the group to a series of gay bars and clubs.  Dominick West (""300"") has a key role as the restrained but usually flamboyant Jonathan who teaches some of the miners how to dance.  In real life Jonathan was also the first or second person in the world identified with the HIV virus.  Joe (George MacKay) is another character who plays a big role in the film.  He's 20 and gay, but hasn't told his parents who think he is straight and going to college.  In order to move the story along, the filmmakers provide small vignettes about these and other characters in the film.

The film is hopeful, entertaining and poignant.  Highly recommended.

The Blu ray comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  The film generally looks very good.  Occasionally black levels waiver but the beautiful Welsh countryside appears lush with greens and partly cloudy grey skies.  Detail is good as are flesh tones.  Interior and exterior shots are well detailed.  The audio comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track which is excellent.  Music comes into play in numerous shots and it is uniformly perfect.  For an interesting example of good mixing, check out the scene where the elderly woman slowly walks across the empty miners' hall to answer a ringing telephone.  There a plenty of ambient sounds to occupy the surrounds although the LFE channel was mostly silent.  Subtitles are available in English and English SDH.  Extras include some deleted and extended scenes, a piece about the true story and some Sony trailers.",1432771200,2,3573,4.83993399339934
6776033,5,B00OY7YOZ2,We saw this film at the Angelika Theater in Plano at a benefit for Equality Texas.  We thoroughly enjoyed the film.  It is a great story that needed to be told in a film and the story was well written in the translation to cinema.  The film is incredibly well acted by all involved and it's beautifully directed and edited.  The sound was great in the theater and the music was perfect.  The audience reaction to the film was all very positive.  People laughed.  They cried.  And they cheered.  This is a film I recommend as well for it's message.,1432771200,2,547,4.39
6776034,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"Very 'British' and very quirky for that reason.  The humour in it is great, subtle at times, not in others, and the appeal is that it is a real story.  To see such diverse communities come together to fight injustice makes you smile in itself.  Not that it's all fun and games.  A couple of pieces even brought a shimmer to this hardened old lady's eye!  If you films that are not the normal Hollywood cookie cutter output, definitely get this, you won't regret it.",1432598400,,465,4.423529411764706
6776035,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"A very fine film. And not just for LGBT people. Some distinguished British actors take what amount to cameo roles to help along this story on the power of joining forces and working for a common goal.

6776037,4,B00OY7YOZ2,"In Pride (2014) a London-based group of lesbian and gay activists led by Mark Ashton (Ben Schnetzer) raises fund for the families of a small coalmining village in Wales during the UK miners' strike (198485). The inspirational story of this unlikely alliance may sound far-fetched, but the truth is this really happened.

Now, at first sight Matthew Warchus film about LGSM, or Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners, is thematically similar to such films as Brassed Off and Billy Elliot, but the way Pride treats the campaign against pit closure is significantly different, with a focus on solidarity rather than conflict.

And when conflict is described, it is mainly between the community members of Onllwyn, a Welsh coalmining village. Pride is a bit like an ensemble drama with many credible and intriguing characters, some of whom are based on real people, played by the talented cast including Paddy Considine, Bill Nighy and Imelda Staunton. Some characters lack depth (like George MacKays fictional ""Bromley""), but the veteran players make up for that.

Pride is a well-made comedy drama with no preachy message or sentimental moment.",1432252800,2,1140,5.184782608695652

6776054,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"This is the telling of a forgotten part of the story that took place during the Miners Strike of 1984 - 85. Thatcher was out to crush the miners and the National Union of Mineworkers; she encouraged the `me' generation and painted caring and unions as somehow dirty and evil. I did as much as I could to support the miners and went on more demos than I can remember as well as giving half my wages to the cause - every week, plus what ever else I could raise.

This is about the Lesbian and Gay Support the Miners group and is told in an often comedic fashion. There is a plethora of talent on show here from Imelda Staunton to the great Bill Nighy. It is extremely well made and has a fairly good eye to the period detail. The plot centres around the reticence of some in the South Wales mining community to accept money from what some labelled as `perverts'. The locations are great and I recognised most parts of London including my fave cafe `The Regency' and the Town and Country Club doubling up as The Electric Ballroom.

Most of the issues are dealt with here but often without any real analysis but it is done essentially as a comedy and for that you really do not want the mood to get too dour. I really enjoyed it and even the soundtrack was great - except for Phil Collins who was a supporter of Thatcher - so weird including him. He famously said he would leave the country if Labour won the election. After they lost and the Tories got back in, the New Musical Express had a headline that said `Bugger off Phil Collins Anyway'.  But the film does end with Billy Bragg in fine form singing `There is power in a Union', so they do pull it back - no pun intended.

This is one of those films that manages to be all things to most people and as such I think it is a fitting testament to those of us who did stand together and proved that winning or losing being united is in itself a victory, and as such this film should be applauded.",1430611200,,1945,4.206434316353888

6776142,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"A very heart warming and true story of how a group of London gay men and lesbian women formed an organization to support the striking miners in Brittain in the mid 1980s. These men and women could relate to how the striking miners were downtrodden and ridiculed by both the government and the general public alike so they decided to give the striking miners their financial support. They randomly selected a small mining village in Wales to support. At first there's tension between them but as they get to know one another their prejudices vanish.

Wonderful performances by Bill Nighy and Imelda Staunton, formerly of the ""Harry Potter"" cast.",1425081600,3,644,4.908256880733945

6776153,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"Here is a ""based on a true story"" flick worth viewing, worth owning to share with your friends. Gay and lesbian people from London seek publicity and public acceptance by coming to the aid of Welsh coal miners involved in a face-off for their survival with the hard-nosed government of Margaret Thatcher, the iron lady. The gay and lesbian folks do not get into this for the most altruistic of reasons and the small town coal miners are suspicious and wary of the gay and lesbian folk and many really do not want their help. Still groups of two very different kinds of people find a commonality of interest and grow to respect and love one another. It's heart-warming, sad in spots, and funny in the way that life is funny. Listen to the dialogue carefully, though. I found the Londoners hard to understand and the Welsh, well you can imagine. Sorry but no captions available. But you get enough of it to follow the story and come to care about the people in it.",1424908800,,962,4.502857142857143

6776167,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"I never thought that, in my lifetime, the gay experience would be not only tolerated but accepted and (dear God!) supported. Movies like PRIDE! have helped the world see that gay folks are just folks with the same flaws, desires and courage. I enjoyed PRIDE! from the first scene to the last. The fact that it is based on a true story serves to bring both the humor and heartbreak closer to palpable. The one liners are memorable, (""Now where are my lesbians?"") and the inspiration true. I liked it so much I bought the DVD and will watch it when I need know there is hope for the world.",1424563200,,587,4.345454545454546

6776169,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"PRIDE is inspired by an extraordinary true story that I was never aware of until I saw the film. It's set in the he summer of 1984, Margaret Thatcher is in power and the National Union of Mineworkers is on strike, prompting a London-based group of gay and lesbian activists to raise money to support the strikers' families.

The movie is amazing, wonderful and poignant on so many levels and it is a part of LGBT history that should be celebrated. I had no knowledge of the incident at the time or in the years afterwards which is surprising.  As someone who was of the same age and generation as the younger characters in the film, I think I can safely say that the film really captures the look and feel of the 1984-1985 years very well.

The case is great and they all do a phenomenal job.  Not to be missed in the extras is the 16 minute short about the `real' events and the `real' people who were involved in the situation.

The film is a comedy/drama and does not claim nor does it try to be a historical documentary of the events that transpired but a film based on the true events.  That said, so many of the important elements are presented and preserved in the film so kudos to the writers, producers and director of the film.

A definite 5 star film that is fit for almost anyone to watch.",1424476800,,1301,4.307377049180328

6776203,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"It's the summer of 1984 in the UK, where under Thatcher not only is the gay and lesbian community feeling oppressed and abused, but so are miners after Thatcher's closing of the pits.  The miners are striking, their families starving, and when gay activist Mark Ashton (Ben Schnetzer) decides the LGBT community should show solidarity with the miners - themselves knowing discrimination first-hand - he forms a group, Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners, that actually finds very little support within the blue collar mining communities.  That is, until a small village in Wales (much to the distress of a number of its small-minded citizens) accepts their help, the LGSM group heading north to support a community that has never even seen their kind ... much less support them.  Pride is a marvel; a funny, touching, beautiful, must-see film about people - just PEOPLE - and how, in the end, we are at our best when not only accepting of each other, but ourselves.

It is truly a testament to those who care about others who are in need, without regard for personal benefit or glory.

6776227,4,B00OY7YOZ2,"You know what oft-used phrase sends me screaming for the hills, determined to hide until the horrors are over?  ""Heartwarming true story.""

Usually it means a sappy, sentimental tale with inspiring music and lots of emotional manipulation. But in the case of ""Pride,"" you get a hilarious, oddball story about two very different groups of people coming together and forming an unshakeable bond -- specifically, striking coal miners and 1980s gay activists. It's a warm, pleasant look at a difficult time, dealing with heavy topics like work strikes, AIDS and government oppression without becoming preachy.

In 1984, British miners were on strike, much to the displeasure of the Thatcher administration. So gay activist Mark Ashton (Ben Schnetzer) had a brainstorm: since both miners and gays were being oppressed by the government, why not support each other in their fights? So with a band of friends, he formed Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners (yeah, bisexuals and transexuals might as well not exist in this movie... kind of like the real-life movement), and began taking donations for the miners' fight during their parades.

Then they contact the miners of the small Welsh town of Onllwyn, who are taken aback by the seemingly random support from a gay/lesbian alliance. After some initial awkwardness, the two groups start getting along -- the gay people help the stolid mining folk loosen up and open their minds, and the mining folk give the gay people the acceptance and familial bonds that they may have been missing. But a few miners aren't willing to accept the gays and lesbians, even if it means wrecking their own political movement's chances at success.

A lot of people talk about how it is easy to accept people who are very different from you, but ""Pride"" demonstrates that sometimes it takes a little unselfish goodwill to actually get the ball rolling. And while GLSM seemed like a little thing at the time, the movie's end reveals that that acceptance and goodwill (""Where are my lesbians?"" an old lady cries out as the miners arrive at a gay pride parade) can indeed do important, sometimes world-changing things. They're just not always the things you expect.

Make no mistakes -- ""Pride"" still deals with serious issues, including LGBT youth rejected by their families, AIDS, political strikes, the pressures of a small community, and a violent attack on one of the GLSM members by some random thug in the street. It gives a bittersweet note to the story, especially when we learn that the flirtatious, carefree Jonathan was the second man ever diagnosed with AIDS, and even when his lover Gethin is in the hospital, all Gethin cares about is making sure that Jonathan is taking care of himself.

But ultimately, these problems are not what the movie is about. What it's about is love, and people forming unbreakable bonds regardless of how different they may be. No message here except ""love other people, and show them the kindness they deserve as fellow human beings."" Do unto others and all that. And what makes it truly heartwarming is that these people were (for the most part) real individuals, and their lives were all changed by what happened. Sometimes it was a whole change in worldview, and sometimes it was just providing a shoulder to cry on or some sage life advice.

And there are some truly lovely moments, such as when the Welsh women stand up and sing ""Bread and Roses,"" and everything falls silent until they have finished. However, it's also raucously, delightfully funny -- lots of dancing, amiable parties, humorous conversations (""Which one of you does the housework?"") and the sight of wacky Welsh ladies rooting around in a gay guy's bedroom (turning up sex toys and porn).

All the actors here are doing good jobs, with characters ranging from the awkward, semi-closeted college student by George MacKay (who serves as a sort of audience surrogate) to Imelda Staunton's peppery, clever Hefina and Bill Nighy's stammering, secretive Cliff. Of special note is Schnetzer as Mark Ashton -- he gives this real, sadly-departed activist a charming, passionate, jaunty charisma that sucks in every person to schemes and ideas that seem kind of weird at first. And Andrew Scott gives a smaller, subtler performance as a young man who struggles to reconnect with his religious mother.

Despite being about two major political situations -- which are still very relevant today -- ""Pride"" is really all about the heart and the connection between people. A savvy, snarky little movie with a heart of gold.",1422057600,2,4548,4.972368421052631

There was so much going on here, from the discrimination faced by gays and lesbians for the sexuality at the hands of their families, the London community, and some of the miners (initially). Some do not let go of their prejudice (sadly) and this is a reflection of our reality. Nowadays, many will not let go of their prejudice, they will not tolerate, they will not respect. Fear motivates their hateful actions such as that one matron in the film, and many others, who couldn't see past others' differences.
As the film progresses however, they come to be embraced by most of the Miners' community, and at the end of the film you see tear-jerking scene of coming together, miners and the LGBT movement for the Pride March in London on June 1985.

6776231,4,B00OY7YOZ2,"Some films know exactly what they are, what they want to say, how they want to say it and how they want you to feel about it, and with all the right intentions in place and all the proper artillery in hand, they do just that; they swoop in with an undeniable identity, speaking their words elegantly and directly, with the right touches of power and inflection and you feel it like a whisper to your heart, because that is exactly where they want you to feel it.

And yet, when all is said and done, you smile and shrug and walk away.

I don't know what happened here, but despite everything in all the right places and all the right words and all the right moments, Pride, as a whole, felt nothing more than nice to me, and while nice is good, I think I wanted more.

Right?

I think my major problem with Pride is that, when the whole thing is said and done, there is nothing truly memorable about it.  It is all very well constructed, with a great ensemble who all work effortlessly with one another and all play off one another well, and the screenplay is cheeky and tender and politically astute and gives these actors and actresses dimensions to play, and the message is one that feels poignant to todays social setting, and yet it all just kind of lays there.  Dont get me wrong, its a delightful romp in many parts, and the thing is that I cant find anything technically amiss here, nothing is wrong or out of place or offensive and Im not sure that I can really think of anything that I would have done differently, and yet there is still this overwhelming forgettable feeling about the whole exercise.  Its doesnt linger, it doesnt stay with you.

My kids, the love suckers.  You know, those little dum-dum things they give you at the bank.  Anyways, they're always begging me to give them one whenever we leave the house to go anywhere.  We have a small bowl of them by the front door.  And so, whenever we leave, they grab one.  They sit in the backseat and they suck on them for a few minutes, savor the flavor, then bite into it, chew it, swallow it and within a few minutes its as if they never had one.  Theyre already begging for another one.  And Ill tell them you just had one and nine times out of ten I hear no we didnt; and they mean it.

Thats how I feel about Pride.  This is a sweet, fun little film that was totally entertaining while I was watching it, and then it was over and in a few minutes I had forgotten that I had even watched it.

That doesnt make it a bad movie at all, just not a great one; and this year has produced a sea of great ones.",1421884800,3,2576,4.211812627291242

US distributors of Pride accused of removing gay references on DVD cover

The Stateside version of the films home release appears to omit mention of the sexuality of the activists at the core of its story

Pride is the award-winning true-life tale of a group of London-based gay and lesbian activists who stood up for striking Welsh coal miners in 1984 and helped to spark a sea-change in attitudes to gay rights on the British political left. But film-lovers in north America who pick up the DVD this week might be in for a surprise after the movies US distributors unceremoniously excised references to homosexuality from the packaging.

The original synopsis for Pride references the London-based group of gay and lesbian activists that supported the miners, but the US packaging mentions only London-based activists in its version, according to Pink News. Meanwhile, a promotional image that originally featured a sign reading Lesbians & gays support the miners appears to have digitally removed the banner on the back cover of the DVD. Critics have referred to the actions  Pride was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment and CBS Films in the US  as straightwashing.

6776246,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"Having watched the ""Je Suis Charlie"" rally in Paris, France earlier today, this film was perfect for the occasion.

I was the age of Gethin and Johnathan in 1985 so I remember well the atmosphere of Pride's time.

This film captures the energy, fear, petty bickering, and the power of the gay rights movement and the jockeying for power and leadership among gay men and lesbians. Bisexuals and transgendered people weren't even on the radar screen and. AIDS was just beginning to rear its ugly head.

In 1985, political candidates would sit behind screens in the United States when they appeared before gay and lesbian political groups to ask for support -- to protect the teachers, firemen, police, and other public workers who feared for their jobs if an elected official knew that they were gay.

I've read some of the critical reviews complaining about this film having shallow and stereotypical characters, but they' re pretty much like the people I knew at the time.

Don't forget that this film is rather tongue in cheek. It was nominated in the Golden Globe's best comedy or musical category, not the best drama category.

The film conveys an important message which is captured in the well worn and time tested protest slogan, ""The People United Will Never Be Defeated"" In 1985, as the film mentions at the end, The UK Labor Party passed a resolution in support of gay and lesbian civil rights which would not have passed had it not been for the National Union of Mineworkers. (The Democratic Party in the United States added gay rights to its platform in 1972.)

In the United States, labor unions have played a major role in Democratic Party support for LGBT rights, so while not mentioned in the film, I wonder if the people in this film were aware of the LGBT - Labor alliance in the United States or if they were simply smart enough to understand that extending friendship and support is the way forward for everyone.

I remember how hateful, anti-equal rights, and anti-union Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were, but I remember nothing of gay people supporting coal miners in the UK, so for me, this was an important piece of history that was new to me done up in a compelling and entertaining film.

Normally, I wouldn't hesitate to put a film on pause to get a snack from the kitchen, but with this film, I waited until it was over to get a snack because I was eager to see what was going to happen next.

Wonderful performances from every member of the cast, esp Bill Nighy, Imelda Staunton, Andrew Scott and Dominic West--his disco routine was terrific, and him teaching the Welsh miners how to dance was hilarious. Almost as much fun watching much have been them all together making this movie with each other.
Having lived through those dark days and supported the miners' strike in a range of ways, this movie really brought me back to my teen years and passion for politics. Those days showed us the power of working together. It was amazing to see the struggle, sacrifice, and good that came out of it, along with the hard lessons. This movie was very uplifting even though it is about a serious period of time in history. Excellent movie, and I look forward to seeing more from this director.",1420243200,,992,4.636363636363637

The cover art and text were ""de-gayed"" completely for its USA release, however after watching the Blu-ray today, and feeling the same full emotional force as in the cinema, I'm now inclined to think that it is much more important that this film gets into the most homes. The acting, direction, script and editing are all award winning in quality, and the scenery in Wales is breathtaking. Again I was brought to tears in several scenes, and not as a result of any schmaltzy button pushing, but rather at the humanity expressed. The extras include the true story on which this is based, and interview comments from the real characters. All of the extras give us an informed appreciation of the film, and the history it celebrates. The Blu-ray is crystal clear in detail, and with a very dynamic DTS HD Master 5.1 soundtrack which is stunning, engaging and faultless. One the best films I've ever seen, and certainly one of the most heart-warming and rewarding.

6776316,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"I was thrilled to see this DVD would be released so early since the movie never made it to New Orleans, which is like a small town in the middle of Montana since Katrina....  My copy arrived on Tuesday and I've watched it several times, laughing, crying, and feeling there is hope for the human race (don't worry, that silly notion will soon fade, probably after Congress convenes in January).

Pride is based on actual people and events in 1984/85 and although not totally factual the basic story is true, moving, and inspiring.  A small group of gay men and lesbians, led by one young man's inspired recognition his oppression as a homosexual was like oppression of coal miners striking as Margaret Thatcher destroyed the last vestiges of organized Labour, start Lesbians and Gays Supporting the Miners (LGSM).  They have a hard time getting any official union lodges to respond to them so just pick one town in Wales on the map and contact the lodge office where, due to a slight miscommunication, the nature of their group is unknown until a representative comes to London to get what they've collected.  The union rep is obviously surprised and puzzled when they meet but appreciates their efforts.

LGSM (all 7 or 8 of them) is invited by the union committee, with some qualms, to be thanked for their support (as were all who supported them).  They travel to the village to give them more collected money and form bonds with a core group who have to work to make others acknowledge and appreciate what these queers have done.  Eventually LGSM is more generally accepted and the fact they collect more than other supporting groups and consistently do so demonstrates their sincerity and humanity.  Shortly before the strike ends one of the few villagers who doesn't like homos being accepted so warmly leaks the story to the tabloids and they have a field day with the scandalous desperation of a group willing to allow perverts to help them.  The local miners call for a vote on the issue and the outcome seems certain.

Mark, the young man whose idea started LGSM, has an epiphany once they're back in London and decides to use the negative but widespread publicity to their advantage.  Pits and Perverts is a massively successful fundraiser.  A group from the village comes to help but they need to get back to make the meeting the next day.  They get there to find the meeting was rescheduled 3 hours earlier than planned and the vote's outcome is to thank LGSM but decline further donations and support.  After a few sharp words are exchanged Sian, one of villagers who supports LGSM, dumps a bag full of thousands of pounds Pits and Perverts raised.  Mark is crushed by the vote and storms off in disgust to get on with his life, screaming at Mike (another LGSM member) to ""piss off and leave me alone.""

Shoot to the day of 1985's London Gay Pride parade.  Mark shows up with a bullhorn outside the former LGSM headquarters (a bookstore owned by one of the members), apologizes to Mike, and joins the motley group to prepare for the parade.  Soon after they get to the forming area for the festivities they're told political and other ""negative"" banners aren't welcome and will be placed at the end.  The organizers want the day to be ""celebratory.""  Of course Mark and the others are furious and as they argue about what to do a van filled with their friends from the miners group shows up, momentarily stopping the discussion for a happy reunion.  A few minutes later one of the organizers shows up again and curtly announces they will have to ""lead"" because there are ""too many"" -- ""What's he mean 'too many?' "" Dai, one of the miners, points to the numerous large buses parking and hundreds of Welsh miners getting out of them, with their lodge banners, there to show support for the people who came to their aid.  I'd already shed a few tears before but as Billy Bragg's ""There Is Power in the Union"" plays while the camera shows the (re-enactment of) parade led by the Welsh miners I was bawling.

I could write a lot more but feel like watching the movie again.

(My review title is in reference to the DVD cover released in the USA, which doesn't even mention LGSM or gays but ""London based activists"" and it appears it may have even photoshopped out a picture which contained LGSM's banner. hypocrites...)",1419552000,8,4327,4.654402102496715

I wrote that although it's obviously a fantasy (teenage boy lovers have the full and loving support of everybody in their small Arkansas town, including their church) it feels completely true. It feels real and genuine. My head said, ""this is a fantasy"", but my heart said, ""this is true - every shot, every word, every gesture is true and real.""

This movie is the opposite. Although it claims to be a true story, it feels as phony as an afternoon TV soap opera. My head said, ""this is a true story""; my heart said, ""no way.""

It's extremely predictable, extremely melodramatic and extremely manipulative. It pulls every possible emotional string, too often and too hard. The good guys are totally good, the bad guys are totally bad, and there's nothing real, nothing three-dimensional or the least bit subtle anywhere.

Nobody despises Margaret Thatcher and her soul-mate Ronald Reagan any more than I do. Their brutal destruction of labor unions - and their smug, arrogant contempt for anybody who wasn't rich and straight and white like themselves - can never be forgiven. If this movie WAS based on a true story, the real people involved have my unqualified respect. This movie does them a disservice by making their heroism seem like cheap melodrama.

The Welsh landscape, language and people are marvelous, and Imelda Staunton gets better with every movie she makes. They make this movie well worth two stars, but that's all.",1419552000,4,1657,5.386100386100386

6776320,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"Stephen Beresford has scripted a version of a true story that is both entertaining and compassionate and inspiring. The story is well known but seeing it played out by such a fine group of actors is touching that such a tribute has been made to a cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre. In the summer of 1984 Margaret Thatcher is in power and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) is on strike. At the Gay Pride March in London, a group of gay and lesbian activists decides to raise money to support the families of the striking miners. But there is a problem. The Union seems embarrassed to receive their support. But the activists are not deterred. They decide to ignore the Union and go direct to the miners. They identify a mining village in deepest Wales and set off in a mini bus to make their donation in person. And so begins the extraordinary story of two seemingly alien communities who form a surprising and ultimately triumphant partnership.

The story works because of the emphasis on the prejudice and harassment of two dissimilar minority groups who discover the similarities between them. It is made more personal by giving us glimpse at the th individuals involved: 20 year old closet gay Joe (George MacKay) hesitantly arrives in London from Bromley for his first Gay Pride march and is taken under the collective wing of a group of gay men and Lesbian Steph (Faye Marsay), who meet at flamboyant Jonathan (Dominic West) and his Welsh partner Gethin's (Andrew Scott) Soho bookshop. Not only are gays being threatened by Thatcher but the miners are on strike in response to her pit closures and Northern Irish activist Mark Ashton (Ben Schnetzer) believes gays and miners should show solidarity. Almost by accident a mini-bus full of gays find themselves in the Welsh village of Onllwyn in the Dulais valley and through their sincere fund raising and Jonathan's nifty disco moves persuade most of the community that they are on the same side. When a bigot tries to sabotage the partnership with a tabloid smear Mark turns it back on her with a hugely successful benefit concert to which most of the villagers, now thoroughly in tune with their gay friends, turn up. The miners are defeated and return to work but at the Pride march the following year a vast contingent of miners show up to repay their comrades with their show of support.

Among the cast members are Paddy Considine, Jessica Gunning, Imelda Staunton, Bill Nighy and a very fine cast of lesser known actors. It works, and if it is predictable so be it - it is deeply touching and would benefit from a large audience attendance. Grady Harp, December 14",1419465600,2,2625,4.767032967032967

When they began to get attacked there was only one group who stood up for them and tried to help. The group was known as LGSM - Lesbians and Gays Support Miners. This group put everything they had into defending the miners but the miners were not all that excited about these being the activists that helped. On the other side other gay rights groups were upset at the group because the AIDS crises was just beginning and they felt the LGSM should focus on that rather than the miners. Refusing to give in the LGSM put everything they could into defending the rights of the Minors and everyone slowly began to find out more about themselves. This is a very good movie that is all the more powerful since this is a true story. You really become involved in everyone's lives and you experience the highs and lows with them. The highs being very high and the lows being very low. The movie is very emotional and you can't help but feeling angry for the way this group is treated for just trying to help someone.

6776326,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"Pride is the true story of an unlikely alliance between a group of gay activists and striking mine workers in 1980s England and Wales. The  stranger-than-fiction story focuses on a group of young gay men and lesbians in London who are moved by the plight of a small mining town in Wales enduring the hardships of a long strike under the unsympathetic government of Margaret Thatcher. Mark (Ben Schnetzer) convinces the group that it doesnt make sense to fight for gay rights without standing up for the rights of others. They start raising money to help the miners and their families get through the strike.

The film puts the struggle for gay rights and the struggle of miners for fair working conditions on equal footing, illustrating that they're both about civil rights. At first the miners are suspicious of their benefactors motives, but slowly come to see them as fellow human beings rather than outsiders with questionable lifestyles. Its a movie about seeing beyond labels, recognizing kinship in similar fights against a repressive establishment, and summoning the courage to organize.

Director Matthew Warchus has made what is commonly called a feel-good film, since it is a wonderful reaffirmation of the human spirit. But the message in the movie is important. When seemingly dissimilar groups with markedly diverse agendas join together, their differences blur in pursuit of a common cause.

8685269,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"What a beautiful story about our shared humanity! This film has been sitting in my queue for quite some time (honestly awaiting ""Prime"" status on Amazon) and I finally watched it tonight. This is a GREAT choice if you are looking for a feel-good pick-me-up!
Based on the theme that when one of us suffers, we all suffer....while another group of our human family suffers injustice NONE of us are free.
Based on a true story, and set in 1984-1985 United Kingdom (during the Miner's Strike against the Thatcher Government) this film unites a group of London Lesbian & Gay Activists and a small village Miners' Union in South Wales. What starts as collecting coins in buckets at London PRIDE grows into something larger (both financially and socially) over the course of the ensuing year.
A great U.K. cast brings it's unique form of drama, comedy, social message, and plenty of tears (of joy and sadness) as only it can!",1529539200,,918,4.74375
8685270,5,B00OY7YOZ2,"An absolutely amazing film that you will want to watch more than once. Terrific, moving performances by everyone evoking genuine heart-lifting emotions of joy and - well, pride! Watch it - you will be so glad you did! Ben Schnetzer as Mark Ashton deserved an Academy Award as did the writers - just all around wonderful.",1529193600,,320,4.732142857142857
