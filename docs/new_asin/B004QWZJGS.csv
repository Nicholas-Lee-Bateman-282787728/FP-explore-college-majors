There a lots of creatures in this Excellent Production! I loved the Soundtrack - it commenced with some lighthearted uplifting music, followed by an exquisite blend of silence and nature sounds that makes you feel like you are there. I compare the cinematography to a ballet dance beautifully choreographed. Overall, the contents of Mount Rainier Mountain EXCEEDED my EXPECTATIONS - Buy It and SEE!

PS: This is a good price! I bought mine on the Australian eBay for $29.95AUD",1487808000,,620,4.6880733944954125
8438577,2,B004QWZJGS,"The cinematography and nature sounds are great, but one can tolerate only so many minutes of melting icicles and bees on flowers. I was hoping to see a documentary with some history and geological background as well as how to get to the mountain (climbing, hiking, and camping, etc.).",1477440000,,284,4.816326530612245
8438578,5,B004QWZJGS,Classic movie for Spencer Tracy and Robert Wagner fans.  Awesome cinematography. Highly recommended!,1436400000,,100,6.6923076923076925
8438579,5,B004QWZJGS,"A very nice 45 minute video without narration that will make your life a bit more peaceful.  The video is circa 1990 and has a ""view from the hike"" type of presentation but the 5 stars are for the nature sounds - captured by Jonathan Storm in a very ""natural way"" - no synthetic drama, just nature's sounds.  The 5 stars are also for Van Manakas and Scott Cossu's music that integrates perfectly with the presentation.  While meditative, this is not New Age ""cheese"" - it is a set thoughtful acoustic themes that reflect the video.",1388793600,,531,4.510416666666667
