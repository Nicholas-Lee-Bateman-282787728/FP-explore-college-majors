8185956,5,B0007LYM3S,"What the title of this DVD should make clear is that ALL of the  footage comes from New York State. That doesn't bother me since I was born and raised in New York, but if you are not interested in New York, this DVD may not be for you. The best clips are of Niagra Falls and of the early growth of Coney Island - which was a much different place 50 years ago. The New York Docks scenes reminded me of The Wire, but obviously from a much more realistic perspective. All in all a good set of clips about New York.",1152835200,,511,3.9611650485436893
