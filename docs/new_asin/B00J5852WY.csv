6333428,5,B00J5852WY,"You MUST watch this movie!!  You cannot go wrong...It will draw you in from the very beginning and not let you go until the very end.  You will laugh, cry, and undoubtedly cheer at the end!  This is a movie you will want to re-watch many times!

If I had a teenager I would watch it with them.  This movie will make you reflect on what is important in life but you won't realize it until the movie is almost over.

This movie deserves to get recognized!",1402099200,2,453,4.149425287356322
6333429,5,B00J5852WY,"I love this movie! I gasped, laughed and cried. The story of Maya and Duncan is more than a road trip movie, it explores themes such as confronting our past and perspectives on life. Duncan is a young man living with autism and through a series of unexpected events he ends up on a road trip with Maya a survivor of domestic violence. Together they help each other to see the world in a new light. The film is beautifully shot and the scenery is spectacular. You almost feel as though you are on this journey with the two main characters.

Autism is close to my heart and I think this is one of the best movies I've seen depicting ASD. It is a rare look at autism that doesn't cater to the stereotypes of spectrum, as many do. Duncan has a story arch and his own character development which is refreshing. Do yourself a favor and purchase this film!",1401926400,8,849,4.30625
6333430,5,B00J5852WY,"I was blown away by Chris Marquette's performance in this stunningly beautiful film. The cinematography and actor performances were phenomenal. Autism is such a touchy and hard subject and, while one of the main character has a form of autism, it's not the main theme. It's more about self-discovery, closure, and understanding. The film really encapsulates what it means to be a well-rounded and powerful indie movie. GREAT FILM!",1401840000,4,430,5.246376811594203
6333431,4,B00J5852WY,"If a movie can be lyrical, that's what this film is. From the gorgeous shots of the new Mexico landscape to Chris Marquette's fantastically engaging and vulnerable performance. One of my favorite scenes is when it ""snows"" in New Mexico. Look for it!

When I saw it at the Austin Film Festival the director of the festival told this story: He was previewing it in his living room when his wife came in half way through. After a few minutes he looked over and she was crying. She made him restart it from the beginning and that's how it made it into the festival.

THAT's the kind of moving film this is!",1401408000,4,602,4.366071428571429
6333432,5,B00J5852WY,Duncan will break your heart. It was actually a really good movie. I loved it.  I had not seen Rumor in a movie before.  I do not know her.  She looks just like her mother.  She is actually a good actress.  The movie is neat.  I like it.,1475193600,,237,3.8333333333333335

6333434,1,B00J5852WY,"Horrendous Hollywoodese casual cashing-in on a misrepresentation of autism.
For those of you who have never been autistic:
This is autism in the way that old Liberace films accurately represent the LGBTQ community.
This is autism in the way that Step'n Fetchit shorts accurately represent the African-American community.
This is autism in the way that Donna Read vacuuming in heels and pearls accurately represented the lives of stay-at-home moms.
(This is also, just as clearly, an exceedingly bad 'update' on the Rainman characters.)",1445212800,,535,5.457831325301205

6333436,5,B00J5852WY,The life of an Autistic is different for each one. The odd way home shows how much one person can touch the life of someone else. How seeing someone else's deficits overshadows your temporary setbacks in daily life. How sometimes feelings are more than we can bear and how not having them at the forefront of your mind might be better than having them right on your sleeve. How someone can so profoundly change the way you think without even trying.,1436745600,2,449,4.555555555555555

6333444,5,B00J5852WY,"This movie reminds me alot of ""Loveship Hateship"" as its based on the truth that caring for another human, when you think no one in the world cares, can change your life for the better. When we take the focus off our own life and focus on another person in need , there is a shift that improves both ! Great story that is sad, tragic, hopeful and ultimately a feel good movie as it evolves.",1410998400,2,390,4.144736842105263

6333446,3,B00J5852WY,Movie was OK but not as good as other movies about Autism that I've seen.  Soundtrack was horrible.,1409616000,,99,4.5
6333447,5,B00J5852WY,"Good movies are so few.  This is one of  those few.  The movie is a journey in more ways than one.  The acting is believable.  I did not know these actors and was impressed by their skill.  Chris is incredible and his acting was perfect and not overdone, which is often the case when actors play a part like this.  It is a story that grabs you from the beginning.  These are lost souls that find each other at that time of life where life has left you with few choices.  Together they help each other to face the worst in life and realize there is a future after all.  This is a journey of friendship, compassion, loyalty and love.  Keep the tissues close by.",1408060800,2,659,4.192
6333448,4,B00J5852WY,"I loved the movie. Chris Marquette was wonderful...I just wanted to hug him! Rumer Willis also played her part very well. I'd love to watch it again, but unfortunately, I only rented it. I gave it a 4 instead of 5 because I was a little disappointed with the ending. There wasn't any closure for me, and I wanted to see what else happened...what was their next adventure? I would definitely watch a sequel...",1405296000,2,408,4.527027027027027
6333449,5,B00J5852WY,"When I saw the trailer for The Odd Way Home, I immediately thought it was going to be a tear jerker. I was not disappointed. The movie tells a powerful and emotional story of two people who are trying to survive on their own and end up developing a beautiful friendship. Rumer Willis as Maya had me completely entranced in the movie. Her performance was stunning. Chris Marquette was entirely convincing as Duncan. In fact, if I hadnt seen him in other movie before this one, I would probably think he was actually autistic. His performance was great and he really got into the role of an autistic person without making a mockery of it. The entire movie was beautiful from start to finish. I definitely want to watch it again and share it with all of my friends.",1402963200,3,762,4.489208633093525
6333450,5,B00J5852WY,"The Odd Way Home is a touching and heartfelt film, though at times troubling. It follows the story of a young musician and her search for what seems to be an inner peace while coping with a turbulent past, and a young autistic man who will touch you with the purity of his emotions.

The depth of the characters and the skill with which the actors portrayed them is what made this film so deeply touching. Rumor Willis and Chris Marquette seemed to have really connected with their characters, as well as with each other, which not only showed but made the film that much easier to become emotionally involved with. These characters made me cry and they made me laugh as they developed an unlikely bond in their travels and experienced the hardships of their lives together.

Last of all, this film was breathtaking not only in the skill portrayed by the actors, but the cinematography blew me away as well, only adding to the beauty of the film as a whole.",1402963200,2,957,4.526011560693641
6333451,5,B00J5852WY,"Congratulations Peter Touche on producing ""The Odd Way Home"" film we previewed Saturday night at the KiMo Theatre. This film is BRILLIANT! Brilliantly written and produced. A MUST SEE! The acting is superb and the story is real...we laughed, we cried. We were engaged from beginning to end! Our two fifteen year olds loved the movie! The cinematography is fantastic! FIVE STARS!  Rumer Willis, Chris Marquette & Veronica Cartwright give powerful performances. Directed by Rajeev Nirmalakhandan.",1402272000,,494,5.5
8648202,4,B00J5852WY,"Alone I can do nothing.
Relationship is about what we can do together. This film is touching, after the brutal first opening, thankfully its not that violent later: just fast forward through the violence which was could have been not so overdone.  The acting of Rumer and Chris is touching, sincere, and very poignant--the human condition is here--two people looking for purpose, meaning, and direction, despite a difficult past perhaps.  The scenery is really good, the music is really good, the violence is not, but the film is one of the characters walking her way out of darkness and both work to find resolution.  I found the lack of sex and romance refreshing and realistic to real life demands and needs, at a deeper level of people, where physical, sexual attraction and sexuality is not even close to being as important as destiny, and what we are here to do together: in relationship with each other, in relationship with the planet and the Human Family at this time in history and great waves of change.

8648208,5,B00J5852WY,"I agree the piece could of had more of an ending, but then where would the fun be in the imagination? I like the ending, she has resolved her demons and he has a new life to live, with a vibrant girl that has a kind heart. The adventure is just beginning. For most even if they have no Autism, change is scary. For the Autistic some constants are imperative. With Rumer's character being the constant, and her accepting the need, He has, she sees that he needs to be there for him. That that story line keeps the future open, and with his difference of composure, she does not have to worry about a guy that will take advantage of her. To fill the need to finish other story lines, I did not mind the dangling, they were historys that was only needed for the two main characters to have to bring closure to the present story.",1489795200,,825,4.227848101265823
8648209,4,B00J5852WY,"Not for everyone. Warning: the first scenes depict violence between Maya and her druggie boyfriend  - unnecessarily harsh. I very much enjoyed this movie. Atmospheric, lovely scenery and well acted. Rumer Willis is great. Good production values - unlike some of these Prime movies that look like they were shot with a handheld camera! My issues were with plot and character development: many relationships are unexplained, or partially explained, so there is much unresolved. The viewer is really left to figure out a lot of gap, or not! The ending is similar, beautiful, but vague. Still, I'd recommend it!",1488499200,,607,5.1313131313131315
