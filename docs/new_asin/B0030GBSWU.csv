8385846,4,B0030GBSWU,"Fascinating glimpse into the characters who play dress up as Hollywood (and other) characters outside Grauman's Chinese Theatre in LA - saw this one awhile back when it was on Amazon, but it appears to have been removed. If you enjoyed the well-reviewed documentary Confessions of a Superhero, this one is just as good, if a bit more tragic (esp the decline of ""Batman"", and the now pot-smoking Superman).",1417046400,,405,4.884057971014493
8385847,4,B0030GBSWU,"Ah, Hollywood. Lights, cameras, fame. Hollywood is a dream-land, right? Uh, sometimes. But Hollywood is also the under-belly. Watching this documentary, while enormously entertaining, constantly reminds you that these celebrity impersonators live very sad and delusional lives. Some would rather sleep on subways, campers, or an alley instead of having the common sense to admit they are pretty much pan handlers. Many of these people are over 40, yet seem to think they will be ""discovered"" and become a star. Most are missing a few teeth, wear dirty or ripped costumes, and look very un-clean. And one person claims a certain dead actor's soul now resides in his soul. Yup, weird!  I've been down there to Hollywood and Highland, and trust me, that corner is not a pretty site or a place I would want to hang around. Director David Markey wisely provides little narrative, letting these odd balls tell their own story. Fascinating, sad, and sometimes very humorous moments ensue. Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.",1286841600,3,1023,5.125748502994012
