8652602,3,B001RHQIHE,"Ordered this DVD & got a email shortly after informing me that it does not have the necklace like the title says. I could care less about the necklace, but since it's included in the title it feels like I was being shorted. I liked the videos, but there were a few times when I felt like I could get better quality watching Youtube. I just want a disk with ALL of his videos. Preferably on Blu-ray. I would've made it 4 stars if it was all on one disk.",1350345600,3,452,4.033333333333333
