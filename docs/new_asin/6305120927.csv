8180517,5,6305120927,"Body Electric is a classic low impact, high quality workout.  I've been working out with Margaret for 20 years.  The moves never get old.  From classic push-ups to weight lifting, you get a good workout that works various muscle groups in a short 30 minutes.  Oh and by the way, I just love the vintage 80's music and gear!",1356480000,3,323,4.423728813559322
