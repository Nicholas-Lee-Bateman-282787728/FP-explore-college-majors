2390450,4,B000ARTMSO,"In 1992, a Amityville came our way to haunt us all...again. This sixth outing is entitled, AMITYVILLE: IT'S ABOUT TIME. Although, definitely not as scary as the first two Amityville films, AMITYVILLE: IT'S ABOUT TIME is another worthy sequel.

  Coming back from a business trip, JACOB STERLING (played by Stephen Mact) has brought a pretty exciting piece of furniture for his home. He is greeted by his beautiful girlfriend, ANDREWA (played by Megan Ward), and his two children, RUSTY (played by Damon Martin) and LISA (played by Shawn Weatherly). The piece of furniture he had bought is an old 18th century mantle clock. He had bought the clock from a house in Amityville, New York...112 Ocean Ave. to be exact. Once he places the clock on the manle, things begin happening. As Rusty gets read to head upstairs to get to bed, he turns the light out in the living room, where as he does so, the room changes into another, looking the living room to the Amityville house. He thinks nothing of it and goes off to bed.

  The next morning, Jacob goes out for a run. He passes by his friendly neighbor, MRS. TETMANN (played by Terrie Snell), while she is walking her dog. He runs his endpoint up to a constructionsite and is ready to jog back home, until he finds Mrs. Tetmann behind him. Her dog begins growling at Jacob very viciously. The dog attacks Jacob, where he bits Jacob on the leg very badly, forcing Jacob to scratch the dog on the nose with piece of broken glass. After having found out the Jacob will be fine, where he has to stay in the hospital overnight for observation, Andrea agrees to stay with the Sterling's a little longer, taking care of everything. She runs into Mrs. Tetmann, and asks what happened. Andrea is strangely confused, for wasn't Mrs. Tetmann there when her dog viciously attacked Jacob?

  Over the course of the next week in 1/2, Jacob begins violently changing his personality, and he isn't the only one: Lisa's personality is also changing, and it isn't PMS. Both Andrea and Rusty see this. They both come to the conclusion that this the clock doing all of the evil hauntings and chaos. The really conclude this after another one of their neighbors, IRIS WHEELER (played by Nita Talbot) is killed by a delivery truck, while the delivery guy is delivering a package. The clock suddenly moves forward and very fast, aging Lisa. Suddenly, we flash back to the very beginning of the film, where Jacob walks in to his house with the clock, where Andrea smashes the clock, walks out the door, where Jacob runs out to her and says, ""What the hell was that about""? Andrea replies, ""It's about time"".

  Another great sequel. This one, as I had already said, was not scary, especially not like the first two films. But this is definitely a worthy sequel.",1155859200,,2783,4.6456211812627295
2390451,3,B000ARTMSO,"I wonder if Fremantle Media is going for most consistently bad set of DVD  Releases.
The basic  Story of this film is very loosely associated with the Amityville mythos; it actually dates back to the time of some sadistic ""necromancer""( the screenplay got it wrong, what they meant is ""Necrophage"")... but if you watch the film, you will see. And a Clock that was owned by the Necromancer/Necrophage, moves house from Amityville  to a place on the West Coast. The Evil of the Clock then tries to take over.
The first half, or so, of the film is just abysmal, production wise, with the second half getting better, almost as if someone thought half way through shooting, ""Oh, maybe we should check the dailies..?"".
There are more Boom Sticks  visible than EVIL DEAD 3, and More Mikes than Waynes World. The Audio is sort of Stereo/2.1 but not quite. It only uses two channels. Seems like it would have been better to package it on a VCD. Do NOT pay more  more than 5 dollars for this DVD. And AVOID  Fremantle Media  DVD's.
It amazes me that the VHS version is better cropped, and has more visual  quality than then the DVD. What on earth was Stephen Macht thinking !!!???!!!",1147305600,4,1173,4.552380952380952
2390452,3,B000ARTMSO,I owned the frist 2nd 3rd this one and whatever number the new generation is this one was a bit more comady then horror when the plastic bird rocks off and impales onto the old women really made me and my girlfreind laugh.,1134518400,,222,4.186046511627907
2390453,2,B000ARTMSO,"I know this wasn't a classic movie by any means but I do think it deserved a better dvd treatment than this. During the last fifteen minutes or so this quality of this dvd release gets worse and worse. Let's see we have;frame freezes,skipping,I couldn't even read the ending credits,why???? Because the last scene skipped to the end of the credits and froze. The picture also breaks up into pixels and the frames freeze between scenes. All for the low price of..... This movie deserved better than this. I can't believe Lions Gate would do a ""shoddy"" job like this. Do yourself a favor keep your crappy vhs copy and save your money for something else. Its too bad cause Lions Gate usually do a nice job on their dvds....",1129248000,3,720,4.546153846153846
2390454,4,B000ARTMSO,"Amityville Horror has enjoyed much success as both a true story and a franchise of follow up films that sometimes hit the target and other times missed entirely. Thankfully, Amityville:It's about time hits every target it sets out to. There is a very good storyline to propel the viewer along a-la demonically posessed clock that manages to cause its' owner's family members to turn against each other as well as provide the usual haunted house jitters the original first and second films did so well.

The film also hits on a nerve previously not heavily seen in the Amityville series, and that's out and out gore. The dad's festering dog bite is particularly difficult to watch, so if you are squeamish when it comes to gore, close your eyes each time the disgusting wound is revealed.

All in all, ""Amityville:It's about time"" is a first rate yet largely unknown thriller that definitely lives on with the best of the Amityville franchise. Tick.....tock.....tick......tock.......",1128729600,6,982,5.055555555555555

8079096,5,B000ARTMSO,"While the plot of this film may be ridiculous it manages to be an awesome entry in the Amityville series. It's well made, the acting is pretty spot on and it's not as dated as one would think. I first saw this when it was running on late night cable and even then I thought it was a ridiculous concept. An evil clock? But I couldn't deny that it was a solid horror film and despite the premise, I loved it! Over the years it has become one of my favorites as I consistently watch it.
The characters make the film. Shawn Weatherly does a great job of keeping things down to earth as someone who is undeservedly caught up in this mess. Damon Martin, as the heavy metal teen, plays it pretty cool and has great chemistry with Nita Talbot. Megan Ward is stunning as the good girl gone bad and she really adds a lot to the film as you see her change while things unfold. Stephen Macht holds his own in the beginning but really shines as he becomes more and more immersed in the possession. There's a great transition with Jonathan Penner's character where at first you can't stand the guy but eventually you feel sorry for him.
It has a few subtle nods to the previous Amityville films and that serves well in keeping it in the family. Most of the history is explained through Talbot's character and those scenes kind of make sense out of the whole thing. It features fairly gross physical effects that are well done but overall it isn't super bloody. It may not have been the best script but director Tony Randel (Hellraiser II) and his superb cast make this one of the best Amityville films.",1480291200,,1588,4.368243243243243
8079097,5,B000ARTMSO,"Part 6 in the Amityville series Finally!! a decent movie with real good horror and somewhat entertaining actors. Film looks old but not horrible. "" The only one i need is dollhouse then i'll have them all on DVD! """,1468108800,2,214,4.375

8079099,3,B000ARTMSO,"Jacob Sterling arrives home with a clock as a gift. Strange things begin to happen straight away. People becoming possessed and others die. The clock is linked to the haunted house - Amityville!

Amityville: It's About Time is the sixth movie in the series. It's not fantastic but it's not crap either. Sure the movie was made on a low budget. Various scenes proof it. It's decent to be named within the Amityville series. The actor (Damon Martin) who plays Rusty is cute. Some scenes show wooden acting. Goofs are shown quite a lot during the movie. But nothing to complain about especially for the budget.

You will enjoy it and be pleased to have it as part of the series!",1439596800,,675,4.570247933884297
8079100,5,B000ARTMSO,"This is by far my favorite movie in the Amityville series. This is the 6th film, done in 1992. This DVD version has enhanced sound and visuals over the VHS copy. The story is, a family buys a clock from the old Amityville house from the original, and like the 4th one (It escapes), the evil travels into a clock instead of a lamp.

The issue with the overall series is, a lot of movies don't continue where the last one left off, or there are plot holes. In the 3-D film, the house explodes, but in the 4th movie (the lamp one) the house is still standing and the evil moves out into a lamp. Well this is the 6th one, and the house is now demolished, but the evil is now in a clock, but how did the evil get out of the lamp in the 4th one back into the house, and into a clock, many plot holes.

I Loved this film out of all 9+ films in the series, the clock is very cool I would love to own the clock from the movie sans the ghosts and hauntings :)",1434585600,,949,3.88659793814433
8079101,5,B000ARTMSO,"Well very much a lively mild horror so you won't need a pillow to bury your head, Very entertaining keeps things going around and on the move, plenty of suspense to keep you involved with the movie and a great classic, I enjoyed all of the Amityville series and added them all to my collection of movies. There are parts that you relax and other parts not so sure, keeping you on your toes. Now this one I'm not saying much about as to spoil it for you, If you like the other movies you will enjoy this just as much. I still class this an A grade classic with plenty of full on pleasure, so what are you waiting for go get the popcorn, relax put your feet up for a wonderful night of entertainment with, what's happening next. Enjoy!",1371340800,,733,4.205673758865248

8079104,1,B000ARTMSO,"Money is the only reason that movies like this, with tenuous links to the sub-par horror series anyway, they slap the ""Amityville"" name to any ""Haunted House"" story and we,yes even me, buy or rent them and keep this whole string awful films running. Very poor story!",1186444800,,266,4.680851063829787
