3078351,4,B00127RAH6,"Agree with all the previous reviews. This is an excellent and riveting miniseries from HBO/BBC. It centres around the mysterious disappearance of a young mother who stops to buy flowers at a roadside stand. Gripping performances all round from an ensemble cast.

The search for the missing woman takes almost 3 months. The five days of the title refers to five separate days when crucial events occur in the investigation. It's very good on the police procedural aspect. Something you seldom find on TV is the show's spotlight on ancillary units like the police's public relations and liaison departments.

Aside from the central mystery, what I found fascinating about it was how it manages to touch on other tangential topics - multi-racial marriages, problems in stepfamilies, multi-generational families and the sorry state of British institutions today. It's nice to see a show poke fun at the many sore points ailing modern Britain - the need for absolute political correctness, the over-abundance of CCTV cameras monitoring every aspect of people's daily lives, the sorry state of policing, the much derided ""Community Support Officers"", (""plastic police"" whose main job is to issue ASBOs - warning letters for criminals caught committing crimes), the presence of increasing numbers of foreigners, the outsourcing of government jobs (a key suspect escapes while in the custody of a private security contractor) and the dreaded NHS (National Health Service) where patients are left out in the corridors of overflowing hospitals like casualties in some Third World country.

Spread over 5 hours and 5 episodes, it remains riveting until near the end. The final episode does tend to drag at points. I'm not all that keen on the ending - the resolution seems to be have been plucked out of thin air, without much preparatory basis. It lacked dramatic flair - there was no ""A-ha!"" moment. It seemed to be simply tacked on to give the investigation a conclusion. That's borne out by the writer Gwyneth Hughes, who admits that she wrote the script as the filming was going on and that she didn't know until the last, how the story would end and who she would choose to be the eventual baddie. Taken as a whole however, it was a fascinating miniseries which had me glued to the screen almost to the end.

The DVD is in 1.78:1 widescreen (anamorphic) - not 1.66:1 as advertised by Amazon. Beautifully clear, sharp and accurate picture. Comes with optional English and Spanish subtitles in case the accents present a challenge. The only extra is a 13-minute interview with writer Gwyneth Hughes. May not be quite perfect but certainly well worth watching.",1206403200,105,2652,5.0204545454545455

3078353,5,B00127RAH6,"FIVE DAYS is a slow moving but ultimately rewarding British miniseries that tells the story of a drawn-out policy inquiry through a different sort of dramatic lens.  Each hourlong episode focuses on a different day of the case, the first two close together, the third a disconcertingly long time later, the fourth on a day when public interest in the case has nearly lapsed, and the fifth a year after the original police report.  Screenwriter Gwyneth Hughes sets her tale in a British suburb, apparently normal on the outside, but inwardly torn by seething disputes, broken families, and long-simmering racial tensions.  Beautiful Leanne Wellings seems to have it all, happiness with a handsome second husband, three beautiful children (two under eight years of age, and a teenaged girl), and a family heavily invested in community and heritage.  When she stops her car on sn impulse to buy some flowers for her ailing grandfather, and leaves her two youngest in the car while she hops across the road, the tension begins right there.  Somehow, you imagine, somebody is going to nab the kids right out of the car while Leanne is picking out flowers from the strange makeshift gypsy trailer parked in the ""Lay-by"" not fifty yards from a bustling expressway.  But what happens, while shocking, is not what you would suppose!

Everything you thought about any of the characters in part one gets turned on its head by episodes two and three.  The seeming closeness of Leanne's family is just an illusion, and the fact that Leanne's second husband Matt  is black serves as a bombshell for revealing much about the prejudice lurking behind the white picket fences of modern day suburbia.  David Oyelowo, whom we last saw in Kenneth Branagh's AS YOU LIKE IT and in THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND, has a field day playing embittered, passionate Matt, despised by his slutty stepdaughter Tanya and desired both by a socialminded neighbor and a policewoman drawn to him against her common sense and warnings by her superiors.

Leanne's mother and father are in their own private hell, too, as their gradual distrust of Matt builds up into a tremendous holocaust of hate and fear for the kids.  Patrick Malahide and Penelope Wilton build up thoroughly detailed portraits of these two, written by Hughes as if by Edward Albee on a really scathing day, and when you see Wilton break down at a televised press conference, able to utter only syllables and gasps, you will be thinking of Artaud or Nijinsky, while Malahide does his own transformation scene later on in the series.  But you know who steals the show, the unbelievably ribald and honest Janet McTeer as Detective Sergeant Amy Foster, a veteran cop who's been on the job far too long to have stayed 100 percent human.  She's counting down the days to the retirement and her farewell speech is among the most remarkable pieces of acting you will ever witness.

FIVE DAYS is flawed--the directors seem to have forgotten really to keep the suspense going throughout the entire length of the show--and some characters wind up spinning their wheels in familiar kitchen sink postures of deep kitsch.  In addition, you might suppose that the race issue finally becomes too complex for them to deal with, and they scurry away from it into an absurd solution lifted from an old Jean Claude Van Damme direct to video ""movie,"" but don't let these minor flaws deter you from watching this sleeper all the way to the end.",1201392000,83,3451,4.843537414965986

Because there are changes that happen to many characters that you have no clue why or how these changes happened. I thought maybe I missed something so I restarted these episodes to watch more attentive but still felt out of the loop.

The plot was plodding and veered off in really unbelievable directions. Points were brought up that were never followed through on, and I felt like I actually missed an episode there somewhere. Also, hardly any of the characters were likeable. I hated the dad, the teenage daughter, the grandparents, the police. They were all just awful and annoying. And there were some damn fine actors on this show. But I don't know if it was the writing or the direction they were given, but over-the-top emoting abounds.

With the number of times the characters debated whether it was better to know or not know some things, it seems kind of the theme for it not to have a super clear resolution.  My issue with the show was more with the subplots that were ultimately pointless.  Not that a subplot needs to advance the central story, but it does need to say something besides sometimes people sleep with their roommates' boyfriends.  Also I do agree that some of the characters seemed overly simplistic and underdeveloped.  Overall, some things were great, some things were just okay.",1457136000,,626,4.7592592592592595

Ooh the grandpa in the nursing home :( he made me cry every time I just want to go hug him. He was so believable and I loved him.
Great job with this one.

I don't want to ruin it for others who may watch it so I'm not giving any details about the ending at all.

I thought the movie was right on point about a lot of things that are happening in our lives today.  Although, at certain points in the beginning of the movie I kept asking myself what a certain scene even had to do with the plot and why I was watching what I was watching.  But by the end of the movie I came away with the realization that every move that is made by everyone around us actually plays a part in our lives and futures, and what may seem to have nothing to do with us at that point in time may actually be a turning point in our lives and can even affect our future.  It was a very eye opening movie for me.",1449014400,,981,3.9292929292929295

""My God, this is really happening, isn't it?"" - Mrs. Poole

Five SUSPENSEFUL Stars! The 5-part mini-series ""Five Days"" is a deliberately-paced, very interesting British drama about the disappearance of not only one 'person' in the UK, but there are 'persons' who are missing for a considerable amount of time. Indeed, it takes a full 30-minutes of TV watch-time before the police discover the BIG clue and the enormity of the apparent crime. This drama really takes its sweet time developing both the plot and the characters, which only adds to its attractiveness. The ""Five Days"" are not consequtive days as the time line jumps days or weeks along the way. It is interesting how many scenes in the very beginning are of great importance later on as the plot develops and the search is on for the missing. ""Five Days"" is an excellent general crime procedural with great character studies of the complex family, the police, the media, and other people along the way. The media gets into the story big time.

3078438,2,B00127RAH6,Yuck. Sure it's 5 days. They just neglect to tell you it's 5 days out of 80 seemingly picked at random and they try to catch up the story by inserting fast-paced dialogue at the start of the episodes. Needed to be about 16 episodes.,1448582400,,232,4.177777777777778

3078440,4,B00127RAH6,Very different point of view of when a person goes missing. There's really great acting in this show. I just wish that the story would have spent more time focused on Leann's character and her story and less time for example on the (retiring Detective's party).

What?!?  A 7-year-old boy leaves his mum's phone and money in the car and takes off walking down the road? They found a cell phone but nothing ever came of it?  Why was the press liaison lady even on the show?  What was the motive for the dog guy saying he did it?  Why was the Maldovian guy dead? So so so many loose ends.

3078926,3,B00127RAH6,Disappointed at the ending. I liked the characters and the story flow until the last episode. It was like they ran  out of time and had to just end it. A typical 1980's style Agatha Christie type novel where the killer is introduced in the last two pages of the story and then it ends.,1445644800,,285,4.181818181818182

3078930,1,B00127RAH6,Interesting concept but rediculous story lines.  A women who was a stranger which found one of the children moves in with the family and becomes romantically connected.  Difficult to believe.  Even more difficult was the ending.  The killer was just pulled out of the air like they had to end it so about this guy?  Very poor writting.,1445558400,,335,4.706896551724138

The acting was hit and miss--really good with the older actors---super good with the grieving husband, but not so good with the children (one kept looking at the camera and the other acted like a zombie most of the time).  Didn't care for the retirement party for the lady detective and sometimes the series moved too slowly, but overall an interesting story.

3079128,3,B00127RAH6,"This has the name HBO so you know there is a minimum amount of quality coming with that. One would expect it to be well conceived and well executed and it is. It shows five days in the lives of a few people, namely a mother and her two kids who go missing suddenly, her husband, her parents, the one daughter who is not missing and also the police who investigate the disappearance. Like I mentioned, this is well made and if you have the patience to sit through 5 hours of an old tv show, do it.
Pros: well made, well acted, good dialogues. Does not make a mess of the various issues that arise (you will understand what I am talking about once you see the show). All the characters seem normal and humane. Even the police seem like regular day Johns and Janes not the super human or super cerebral types
Cons: a bit too dramatic at times, yes this is something that starts to bug. Especially towards the later episodes. And here comes my major gripe, the last and final twist. It is, for want of better terms, totally ridiculous, idiotic and unnecessary. And that is where I would end this review. If you don't want to sit through 5 hours of drama and be sucker punched by a plot twist that feels like something straight out a third rate detective fiction story, please avoid watching this.

3079232,4,B00127RAH6,"HBO was wise to partner with the BBC on a series. It's believable because the actors are so flawed. They are real - not the perfect looking self righteous characters coming out of Hollywood. You won't find unnecessary car chases and edge of your seat tension in this, what you will find is an heart wrenching plot that unfolds over a long period of time. This series explores the raw emotions and strains that a tragedy takes on a family. I particularly liked the self discovery that several of the actors went through -  Penelope Wilton, Hugh Bonneville, and Janet McTeer were excellent in this. I agree with some of the reviewers that not all of the characters were likable... but I think that adds to the story.",1445126400,,714,4.578125
3079263,2,B00127RAH6,"I get the concept that the story is dropping the viewer into five random days of a much longer police investigation. However, at the start of each episode I always felt like I had missed something. I always wondered if I had forgotten to watch the entire previous episode - I inevitably was lost until I figured out I was supposed to learn the ""missing"" information through dialogue. In the end, I was thoroughly confused as the eventual suspect turned out to be someone I had completely forgotten about, and I didn't catch how he was even involved.

3079480,2,B00127RAH6,"OK, so it's great at the start and all down hill from there. I was annoyed that by the time I realized the ship was going down, it was too late for me to turn it around (as in, I'd invested a lot of time in this thing and wanted to see how it ended). About halfway through, turns into a soap opera. Desperately wanted to be like Collision, and failed. The character Sarah totally ill conceived--irksome, and not believable in the least. Plus the failure of any of the other characters to see her involvement with the hero as anything but radically suspicious was astonishing. Anyone with any writing ability whatsoever could do a better job with the last episode than these poor sods did.",1444867200,,688,4.468253968253968

3079512,3,B00127RAH6,"This drama about a missing mother and her children was mildly entertaining.  The cast did a good job overall, but the pace was way to slow for the storyline.  It could have easily been wrapped up in a couple of episodes.  It was mind numbing how the drama was drawn out by filling the timeline with the reactions and overdone drama of all the participants from the husband to the police to the parents and all the sub plots around the kidnapping.  If you have many hours to kill, go for it.  Otherwise do not waste your time.",1444867200,,525,4.316326530612245

3079579,3,B00127RAH6,"I thought it would get better, but it remained ridiculousfrom the start. Usually British TV shows are well-written and clever. This one was dull and the acting was absurd, which is surprising given that two of the actors are together in Downton Abbey.
 The little boy couldn't act. The old man stood up out of his wheelchair and knocked potted flowers off his window sill in a ridiculous  fit of pudgy rage and dialogue was purposely not present as if to make one feel some depth in a silly situation. For example, people not speaking up for themselves when the average person would defend himself. Or drawing out an amotion using a facial expression which wasn't needed. The singing of a lone woman during some scenes was merely annoying instead of providing some feeling of hopelessness, confusion, and loss. It was just noise. I'm sad I gave my time to this, expecting so much more. The premise seemed really prmomising, but this promise was broken. I'm not going to waste a second episode again when the first one gives such an obvious message about the future of the remaining ones.",1444694400,,1087,4.71578947368421

As I went through the 2nd to 5th episode, hence the 5 days since the actual events take place over about a month, the show began to loose its appeal and become rather mundane. The final episode was somewhat of a let down. It would be good for a binge watch on a rainy day when there is not much else to do as it is interesting enough to keep you watching till the end.

3080219,5,B00127RAH6,This story is told in five episodes. A mother goes missing and then her two children seem to be abducted. It is nicely filmed and the characters are developed. The tension is there and it does continue throughout the story. I enjoyed it and it is worth watching. I've seen criticism but not sure why. Of course there are elements that seem a bit of a reach but you watch for the story and the characters. You also watch for the outcome so it keeps your interest. It is not constant action or focused on one hero solving the mystery. It is more of a flow of characters and events and the camera follows along educating you.,1443484800,,622,4.3247863247863245

3080274,2,B00127RAH6,"I don't know if  they ran  out of money or time or both, but the series fell flat. As another reviewer mentioned, they skip over so much of the story line that you wonder if somehow you missed a scene or two. At one point, I closed the series and looked through the episode descriptions, to see if somehow I'd jumped from episode 3 to 5. But no.

The characters are drawn without depth, so it's impossible to relate to them and what they're going through. Hugh Bonneville looks like he is on his first rehearsal off script. And maybe he was. Simple human connections -- between police and the victims, for instance -- are ignored, while familial disputes are too frequent and overdone.

Then when we finally get to the **solution** to the crime, I found myself more confused than ever. I guess I could watch the last episode again but I don't really want to. The characters were too thinly drawn to care what happened to them in the end, although I hate seeing anyone beat up, kicked and abused. Still, my reason cried out for a clear answer to what exactly happened to Leanne.

Flashbacks to when Leanne was interacting with her family would have helped greatly. That and/or starting the movie before Leanne disappears. We need to see the little family having fun together, see how much Leanne loves her husband and children and they her.

3080379,2,B00127RAH6,"Meh. It could have been done in 2 or 3 days and I would have been satisfied. There were un-redeeming plot elements where redemption was needed: the dad's 'creepy-gal' love interest; the retiring D.S. who left without seeing the case through; not enough clues pointing to different possible suspects; the specific use of, but unaddressed 18-wheeler blocking the flower stand, neither mentioned nor showing up on CCTV checks; and most importantly, a completely out-of-left-field surprise killer that did not suggest a hint of suspicion, or figure significantly in any of the episodes, making the whole five-day process seem a complete waste of time. The actors are quality, but the story's plot developed so slowly, I lost interest in their characters and their subplots quickly - and there were a LOT of extraneous, non-plot supportive characters. The kids were the most interesting theatrically of the bunch. Disappointing. Skippable.",1443139200,,934,5.360544217687075

Yes I think so as it was a fascinating plot with a mystery that I couldn't figure out until it was revealed at the end. The only thing that was sad though well played were the dysfunctional family reactions to the missing Leanne, the beautiful wife of Matt. The family blames each other at times, and splits apart at the end. However, the reactions except for those of Leanne's mother, who was bereft and sometimes cruel toward her husband, were mostly understandable which gave strength to the series. Hope to see Season Two come out on Amazon Prime.",1443052800,,689,4.52

3080600,2,B00127RAH6,"Lost me in the first installment as it asks me to extend belief beyond the impossible. Even in 2007 there was no way a child who appeared to be 10 years old and knew enough to say they are not to talk to strange men would not have first taken his mother's cell phone from her purse to call at the very least his father, if not the police rather than just to get get out and start walking with his little sister when his mother disappeared.

So I have continued watching and the kids are meant to be 5 and 7, but I still maintain that a 7 year old should know how to call emergency services and when it is appropriate and I say that as a mother.

I'm not almost done with part 4 and I agree with others who say that between some of the parts it feels like you've missed something, like you've skipped an episode even. It's not so that you can't figure out what is going on but it does take you out of the moment and is more than a little irritating.

I am now left wondering why I bothered to see this through to the end which was nonsensical and very unsatisfying.",1442966400,,1064,4.033175355450237

4 stars due to the expedited and strange ending. It had a bit of an unexpected twist that was not necessary.

Maybe it was just me, but a few of the women looked so much alike I couldn't tell them apart at times.  I had to repeat a couple episodes in order to catch on.  Not complaining, merely revealing g my lack of attentiveness.

3080702,4,B00127RAH6,"I thought the series was very riveting. Yes, it was slow paced but I felt unable to stop watching it. Many Brit productions are like that for me as I find Brits think differently in their film making and it is very fresh to me. I thought the first two episodes were especially entertaining.  As others have mentioned, it occasionally seemed to skip past important areas of the story leaving you to wonder if you missed something. Or to ""ASSUME"" the outcome and fill in the blanks. And there is a spot in the last 5 minutes or so of the last episode that if you blink you will miss a very important subtle visual clue that is made even more important because of the accent the accompanying  words are said in and not being able to understand the dialogue the first time. I had to rewind and watch it again because the next scene made no sense without it. The last episode was the weakest of the 5 with the first two being the best. At times it felt as if most of episode 5 was filler and they sort of didn't know what to fill it with until the end.

SPOILER WARNING!

 I do pat myself on the back for guessing correctly at the end but not because of any real clues given but because the movie fell into a common trap I see a lot in many ""who done it"" type movies.",1442361600,,1262,4.134693877551021

3080946,2,B00127RAH6,"Some great acting, I think Janet McTeer's leaving speech was a classic - however as many have said, this lacked something somewhere.  In any murder one hangs on to the thought that at the end you are going to find out how it all happened and tie up the loose ends.  I even found myself rewinding back to see the part where Gary comes in, although it was obvious all along he was in it somehow, and yet I still didn't really see why on earth he would have got involved.  So many parts didn't make sense, the children would have probably taken the phone with them or tried to call, and would not have just walked off.  I think to conclude, it was a bunch of great actors but they were let down by the plot, which is a shame. A lot of viewing for a very short reward.",1441756800,,764,4.073333333333333

3080948,2,B00127RAH6,"This is basically BBC's Me Too attempt to cash in on the edgy dramatic types of series being produced by American TV companies. HBO released it in the US but wasn't involved in the production itself so its a bit misleading to see HBO under the title.

As a drama it didn't work for me because of the constant over the top emotionalism combined with a de-emphasis on solving the actual mystery which made it hard to for me care what was happening to the characters. There are no heroes and no villains; just anxiety producing situations with no real resolution. Yes, they do find the guilty party but by that point I was too worn out to care.

Then there's the sound track sung by a plaintive waif voiced  girl that grates on the nerves. Generally I love plaintive waif voiced singing, like Sarah Polley in the Sweet Hereafter, but the tone of this singer's voice is more keening than singing. Every time the music came up all I could think was: ""No! Not again!"" and had to dive for the remote control.

The actors are all perfectly fine and do a good job with what they have to work with. If it had been done as a straight mystery it could have been great.",1441756800,,1156,4.337962962962963

They focused the final episode on a retiring police officer but failed to make her a big character on the show. In the last 5 minutes they wrapped the whole mystery up and it felt very rushed and worse than that it didn't even make sense. Episodes 1 - 4 were great!,1441670400,,352,4.268656716417911

3081303,4,B00127RAH6,"The HBO/BBC gripping mini-series, ""Five Days"" is well worth watching if you're in a binge viewing mood.  With the attention to detail that the BBC brings to each of its mysteries, the drama starts building from the first frame and you're hooked.  While it has hints of the BBC series ""Broadchurch"", it has none of that series' story side tracks.  HBO saw the underlying story line and knew it was up to their standards.

Though a British ""police procedural"" in the best sense, it keeps the action going between the victims and the authorities, with always the pending doom that you know is about to knock on their door with more and more bad news.  Great performances by Sarah Smart, Hugh Bonneville and a gritty David Oyelowo and a story line that pulls you in all adds up to the quality that HBO has built their reputation on.",1441152000,,828,4.5675675675675675

We did find out what happened, although it was a little difficult to accept as a plausible explanation.  To say I enjoyed it seems disrespectful of the emotional pain I shared with the family.  It was wrenching, but I appreciated the craft with which all the actors portrayed their roles. Parts of it reminded me of ""Crash"" as the members of the family, the policemen and women and even the perpetrator(s) interacted with each other in seemingly ordinary, everyday fashion until the final reveal.

I guess if the right decisions were made it would have been a 1/2 hour show.

***Spoiler***

1-In this day and age, you often hear of children five and under saving someone by calling the police. Why didn't the children go to the driver's seat, the mother left her bag and take the phone that was in plain sight and call the police or their father or their sister. Some children would have attempted to drive the car themselves.

2-ok they were so scared they didn't think about that. Why didn't they walk a few steps forward to where traffic was and waved for help? The police car was there and if not (for the sake of argument) someone would've seen them and helped.

Instead they decide to walk down a lonely road with no traffic where Rosie was taken.

Just didn't make sense to me.

3081476,4,B00127RAH6,"While certainly not perfect, Five Days is an absorbing, interesting look at the aftermath of the disapearrance of a young mother. Relatives, friends, cops, and journalists, as well as intruders and neighbors, are all affected in often unexpected and disturbing ways. There is of course the mystery; where is she? Did she simply leave? Or was she abducted? Murdered? That is ultimately not the central theme, nor the only reason to watch. Written with respect for the intelligence of the audience, which gives an assemblage of skilled actors often intriguing and challenging words and scenarios. Two or three things do not quite add up for me, but they do not detract from the overall impact of the drama. I would not hesitate to recommend this to a friend.",1440892800,,756,4.9140625

It is a realistic portrait of all people and families break apart with the loss of one member of the family. Very sad. Most of the acting is quite good. It's a BBC/HBO mini-series. But you have to be willing to stick with it. It drags at points. It's set in Britain. Hugh Bonneville is the senior police investigator -- I had no idea he was so young after seeing him so often on Downton Abbey. And, David Oyelowo as the husband does an excellent job of acting. He's very interesting. I couldn't figure out why it was called Five Days. The reason is that covers 5 days in the investigation -- first, Day 1, then Day 3, then Day 28, etc.",1440806400,,787,4.253333333333333

Enduring the depiction of the detectives inept, molasses-like progress of the investigation is nothing short of infuriating - to the point of being uncomfortable to watch.  As if this weren't enough to make the viewer completely frustrated, the supporting storyline for the final payoff was so weak that the only loss I mourned when it was over was for the 5 lost hours I'd put into it.

Practically the entire cast composed of quarrelsome individuals whose only skill is throwing tantrums.
Overdose of gratuitous sex escapades, mostly in very poor taste.

Instead,  it's about human emotions of the people secondary to the crime. In other words, it's not about the suspects or the victims. It's about the crying, screaming and whining of family and friends of the victim, and their reactions and life changes after being on the periphery of a crime. Last, it dragged.

There are some great actors and characters in the series and the potential is there for it to be really good. I can't quite put my finger on the problem, perhaps it was the editing, perhaps direction, but the story flow just isn't there. Some important elements flash by with little or no explanation and some characters lines are totally superfluous. Having committed to the series the final episode seemed to be a total mess. Janet McTeer, Patrick Malahide and Hugh Bonneville put in a good performances, which unfortunately magnifies the less strong acting.

3082103,3,B00127RAH6,"Somewhat typical Hollywood plot but had interesting twists.  Was able to pick out the ""friend"" as the culprit only because he was the least likely suspect - typical Hollywood.  Some scenes & dialogue were poorly written - my opinion but one in particular proved rather factual - when the lead detective commented on the number of CCTVs per capita yet the crime went ""unspied"" (my word).  Also, my opinion again, how many 7-year olds would have left the cell phone behind?  How many 7-year olds are cell phone savvy today and would have used it?  Of course, I could be dead wrong about this - won't be first time!",1439769600,,612,4.577981651376147

 It took them a very long time to tell this story and resolve the plot and after a while I really did not care that much . it was all very dramatic and involved lots of tears and I mean lots of tears except for the children who seemed quite stoic or maybe they were hoping if they could get it right they could now go out and play !!

All these random things like grandparents, and parents not getting along with their children, lost cell phones, affairs, lying, cheating, cops babysitting, dogs, moving in with a new girl out of the blue.  So many people connected to this case that just all happen to be at the same gym, retirement home, park, etc all at the same time on many occasions was totally ridiculous.  The main person working the case retires just before it is solved!  And the totally stupid reason behind the disappearance was a total disappointment!!!  Nothing exciting or sad at all.

3082825,3,B00127RAH6,A good British fill in for the Summer blahs on TV.  Not a lot of character development which is usually the case with British TV.  As always the British have good actors and I'm sure they did the best they could with what they had to work with.  All in all it was good to see Downton Abbey actors in different roles and get to see their acting skills.,1437696000,,351,4.057971014492754

While this was in conjunction with HBO my guess is American audiences may find it a bit boring.  It doesn't have the pizazz of an American TV series.  That being said, who cares.  It's a good story and after a bit it is easy to get caught up in the series.

3082845,1,B00127RAH6,"One of the few British murder mysteries I truly disliked. We watched to the end out of curiosity to see how the murder was solved. The only likable character was the police official played by Hugh Bonneville. Most of the other characters stumbled from one stupidity to another. We watch many, many British Police procedurals and thoroughly enjoy them all. This one had us grinding our teeth in frustration. We came close to stopping before the end but it became a case of lets see how they solve the disappearance. The whiny children were the most annoying of all.",1437609600,,564,4.707070707070707

I've read reviews on this, but in all the glowing reports, I have yet to read about its finest quality:  the gut-wrenching realism of the effects of a homicide on the family and friends of the victim.

I guessed the villain half-way through just because the character had no other reason to be in the program, but still couldn't tell you much about the why, since the ending is rushed, chaotically written and almost nonsensical, especially coming after four hours of snail's pace plot and character development.  I enjoyed the glimpse into British life, but not sure how accurate it is - I know British tax rates are high, but do they really have enough money to assign an officer almost full-time to the families of missing persons, to do their dishes and act as nanny?

After 4.75 hours of reasonably well written, reasonably well acted drama, we get the answer we've been watching for all this time: Of course! It's Gary, the person who is never shown interacting with any of the other two culpable characters, who has no motivation whatsoever to be involved (other than his concern about his retirement money being insufficient), who has nothing to do with Branko (who we also barely see at all). What garbage!  It's as though the writer just threw a dart at the wall and said, ""Ok, it's Gary."" Especially in light of the wealth of alternate possibilities that would have made sense, eg. Sarah.

I suspected early on who the real ""bad guy"" was, but that didn't change the fact that this was a terrifying, gritty,sad story that kept me on the edge of my seat through the whole thing.  Watched all five episodes in two sittings....but had to stop myself from jumping to the last episode to find out for sure.  Read one review that said this was so not like real life, but I disagree.  The dysfunctional relationships displayed, the animosities amongst family members, are all too realistic.  And the crimes committed, even the motives involved, are not so far fetched...one only has to watch the news or talk to friends and family to see how real this could be.  As for this movie being slow (as several reviewers have stated)....it was never meant to be an action movie, but something of a psychological thriller.  I had no problem staying totally with it from start to finish and watching every moment for fear I might miss some small thing that would keep me from understanding the whole story.",1436918400,,1032,4.668508287292818

Some of the detective aspects are weak.  Without giving too much away, they never seem to interrogate anyone very well, especially the kids who were involved in a lot of the story and a couple other key characters.  If you watch a lot of Law and Order you'll be wondering why they cops keep guessing at things and not really interrogating everyone more successfully.

3083293,4,B00127RAH6,Very intense. I am familiar with many of the actors. It is interesting to see them in more modern roles. You will want to watch the series in its entirety.,1436400000,,155,4.2

Fans of Broadchurch will appreciate the show's focus on the effects of crime on witnesses, innocent bystanders and the people who investigate the crime(s). It's not as fast-paced a series as its five episodes might indicate, and things tend to get a little convoluted and convenient toward the end, but it's highly satisfactory.

3083370,4,B00127RAH6,I really liked the series and want to see more. It is an intelligent mystery story that keeps you and the police guessing.  Maybe you are one step ahead of the investigators. A woman disappears in plain sight from the side of a highway while her children wait in the car. It doesn't get more mysterious than that!,1436140800,,313,4.396551724137931

3083517,3,B00127RAH6,Not exactly the storyline that I expected. The characters were under developed and uninteresting. The pace of the story was frantic and disjointed. It seemed to try to include the story of too many characters without the time to develop the stories enough to make them interesting and still conclude the plot of the original mystery. Maybe if the storyline could have been extended  along with the number of episodes this show would be more easily followed. Unfortunately it was not as good as I felt it could have been.

Many reviews have mentioned the slow pace but I don't mind that ... in fact I prefer the way most British shows seem to have a slower pace than American ones, who try to pack in too much 'action' in a short time frame just for the sake of it.  This show touches on a lot of different issues without hitting you over the head with any of them. A good mix of suspenseful and subtle.",1435449600,,487,4.0625

If you're thinking of watching this show, STOP, find another show. Both BBC or HBO make great programs that are available here on Amazon prime video. Watch something else.",1435104000,,443,5.253521126760563
3083729,5,B00127RAH6,"The Brits excel at the genre that combines drama with mystery and suspense. FIVE DAYS is another winner. Let's start with the fantastic class. Penelope Wilton is one of England's grand ""mature"" actresses and here she is with a more youthful Hugh Bonneville--both later reunited in DOWNTON ABBEY. And also starring is David Oyelowo the recent star of the acclaimed SELMA. Here is a cast of British actors, you may recognize and will certainly enjoy.
FIVE DAYS is a modest 5 episodes that follows the mysterious disappearance of a lovely young mother literally in front of her two young children. The children start searching for her mother and soon are missing. There are the countless twists and turns as the police race to find the mother and her children. Was she murdered or did she just run off with her lover? Would a loving mother just abandon her children by the side of the road? A distraught father and husband becomes the center of the investigation.
The show delves into the complex relationship of the family and of the police investigators. There is no shortage of romance and sex and suspected improprieties. It's fascinating to follow interpersonal relationships and innuendos and misperceptions.
You'll be hooked immediately on the mystery of the missing mother and on all the wonderful and brilliant actors. A special nod to Sarah Smart who unintentionally gets directly involved in the investigation and with the distraught husband. She has her own secret and the mysteries and exposes keep coming. You'll wish the series had a few more episodes.",1435104000,,1564,4.996168582375479

3083870,4,B00127RAH6,Overly dramatic from the cinematography to the acting to the music.  I suspect a cultural disconnect given this BBC five part series creates such a huge story over a missing woman.  The number of investigators once the case opens up is amazing and shows the difference between American culture with thousands of annual murders and British culture with this big case resonating in the lives of the main characters over 5 nights.  The interracial marriage and second marriage angle adds an interesting twist.,1434412800,,506,5.072289156626506
3083871,3,B00127RAH6,"This is a fast action packed program with lots of sub plots that keep your interest. The acting is very good and the writing is not bad.

3083896,3,B00127RAH6,"It was 2 mysteries wrapped in one.  I think the reason I'm giving it a low reviw is that, given the choice again, perhaps I would have skipped over it.  It was kind of hammy in the acting department, except for David Oyelowo, the father. I thought he did a great job.  But I can't bear the blonde woman detective, who retires, she's an awful actress, in my opinion. Sorry I can't remember their names, but the other one I do, Hugh Bonneville, did a good job, also. So,  all in all if you like mysteries, it's good....just good. Again just in my opinion. I was going to give it 2 stars, but re-thought it and will give it 3 stars, as it is a good mystery that keeps you guessing.",1434412800,,678,4.152671755725191

The last episode was a total waste and I wondered why I started watching it at all. Acting was fine but the plot just didn't develop well. Too many characters and too little happened...I started to feel like it was meant to be some sort of come on for a possible TV show...THe ending was totally ridiculous and very anticlimatic.

Additionally, there are waaaaay too many characters to keep track of, many disappearing for episodes at a time. More than that, the final villain isn't even hinted at until a dying confession of a suspect in the final 5 minutes. Altogether, after the middle of Episode 2, the ""mystery"" exists only because of bad writing (gosh, how many characters act against their own earlier-established characters) and withheld information. Watched it to the end to see who dunnit, but felt cheated. Some good acting (the top detective, the victim's daughter), a lot of bad acting (the 2nd detective, the victim's mother) and a LOT of unessential side characters taking up time just to fill out each episode.",1433808000,4,929,5.038961038961039

The story says the CCTV cameras couldn't identify the vehicle that snatched the mother while buying roadside flowers because of a blind spot but the time of the crime was know which would have allowed CCTV cameras see the vehicle shortly after the vehicle left the blind spot and it would have shown the flower truck too.  Also, near the end of the story evidence showed that the mother was hurt accidently which says that the blind spot in the CCTV camera at the scene of the crime had nothing to do with premeditated abduction.  The mother shouldn't have died.  The kidnapper of the daughter and the flower seller witness had no real reason to hide what the knew about the mother's disappearance either.",1433808000,,861,4.558441558441558

3084345,2,B00127RAH6,"A young mother takes two of her children to visit her grandad in a nursing home. Along the way, they stop to adopt a shelter dog and Mum stops to buy flowers from a roadside lorry. Mum is never seen again and the children, abandoned, leave the car and disappear. What has happened to all of them? Are they dead or alive? Thus begins what could have been an exciting 2-hour police murder/kidnap mystery. The problem is the extended format - five long episodes when maybe two would have been adequate. To sustain the story, the writers must include a great deal of extraneous material, red herrings, detours, false arrests, suspects coming out of the woodwork, details about everybody's personal life and on and on ad nauseam, with a bit of racism thrown in for good measure. And most of these characters are unlikable and behave badly, with the possible exception of the shelter dog. When the case is - finally - solved, the solution comes out of left field and is deeply unsatisfying. The cast, including the great Janet Mcteer, perform valiantly, but are wasted in this production. This format - a crime investigated over an entire season - has become very popular. Think ""The Killing"" and ""The Bridge,"" both of which are better and more focused.

I was mad that I felt like I wasted FIVE HOURS. There was no reason Matt's Army buddy would throw his wife's ""thought to be dead"" body in the lake or even help the flower man and Kyle do that after a 'flower purchase gone bad' accident to Matt's wife. I give this movie a 1 for stupid ending - it was cruel and ditto to another reviewer the ""resolution seems to be have been plucked out of thin air, without much preparatory basis. It lacked dramatic flair - there was no ""A-ha!"" moment. It seemed to be simply tacked on to give the investigation a conclusion. That's borne out by the writer Gwyneth Hughes, who admits that she wrote the script as the filming was going on and that she didn't know until the last, how the story would end and who she would choose to be the eventual baddie.""",1432339200,4,935,4.2
3084405,1,B00127RAH6,"Five Days involves the disappearance of a young mother, and covers a 79-day period of time in 5 episodes, each dedicated to one day in that 79-day stretch of time.  While a welcome departure from the usual TV/movie formula, days (in some cases, weeks) of story time pass between episodes and events that take place ""off the air"" make watching episodes 3, 4, and 5 feel like you were gone from the room to get a snack longer than you thought and missed significant chunks of the plot.

With a better script, this issue could have been overcome, but Five Days' characters can't carry the load; they are so poorly-developed, their actions and motivations, when not cliche, contradicting, or raggedly shifting from scene to scene like an old TR6, are often simply inexplicable.

Yet even with these glaring flaws, I opted to hang on to the end, so I can only blame myself.  Halfway through the final installment the wheels came so completely off the bus I began to resent the time I'd invested in the first four episodes.  A 5-plus hour show needs a worthy plot -- not necessarily James Pattersonesque twist-after-twist-after-twist into the implausible, but a neat, satisfying conclusion.  Five Days (semi-spoiler-alert) merely throws a handful of main characters into a cliche fray with unrealistic dialogue all too common in TV shows where the bad guys spell out exactly what they did.  Even more groan-worthy in this case is that shortly before the evil-doers conveniently have an argument to let us know what happened, the lead detective (with conjecture not seen since circa 1990 episodes of Murder She Wrote) suggests a theory of the case based upon the skimpiest of evidence that turns out to be dead on.  Unfortunately, that the detective ends up being right doesn't make him look like a shrewd investigator, but a character in a show where the real mystery is: how did this thing ever get made?",1432339200,98,1899,4.839506172839506

Consequently, the viewer is moved along at a very rapid pace and left to draw their own conclusions to a number of events and fill in gaps between episodes.

This approach quickly loses focus and sustaining mood and ultimately leaves us feeling uninvolved and without sympathy or empathy for any of the victims.  They all come across as self-involved whiners - clearly not the intention and clearly not a reaction the viewer wants to have.

3084460,5,B00127RAH6,"""Five Days""
This joint production of the BBC and HBO is a taut, yet elegant murder mystery that will keep you guessing right up until the end. When a young mother of three vanishes by the side of a British highway, leaving her children stranded in their car, a family is thrown in upheaval, as is the local police department, which finds the high-profile disappearance to be a difficult case to crack.  Fans of BBC shows such as ""Prime Suspect"" will find themselves in familiar territory here, in a miniseries packed with strong performances by unfamiliar, immensely talented actors, aided by a strong, intelligent script and handsome cinematography.  This show's particular strength is in its fine-grained, thoughtful exploration of the forceful, torturous emotional reverberations that murders can have on loved ones.  The real psychological costs of homicide, which mainstream media often ignores or presents in trivialized or stick-figure form, are here presented at length, and revisited in episode after episode, much as they might revisit the victims of crime in real life.  There's a lot more emotional substance here than you might be used to seeing, and plenty of fine character work as well. You'll be drawn in and well rewarded for your time. It's a bit depressing, but definitely worth watching. (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1225065600,3,1344,5.179723502304148

3312848,4,B00127RAH6,"Agree with all the previous reviews. This is an excellent and riveting miniseries from HBO/BBC. It centres around the mysterious disappearance of a young mother who stops to buy flowers at a roadside stand. Gripping performances all round from an ensemble cast.

The search for the missing woman takes almost 3 months. The five days of the title refers to five separate days when crucial events occur in the investigation. It's very good on the police procedural aspect. Something you seldom find on TV is the show's spotlight on ancillary units like the police's public relations and liaison departments.

Aside from the central mystery, what I found fascinating about it was how it manages to touch on other tangential topics - multi-racial marriages, problems in stepfamilies, multi-generational families and the sorry state of British institutions today. It's nice to see a show poke fun at the many sore points ailing modern Britain - the need for absolute political correctness, the over-abundance of CCTV cameras monitoring every aspect of people's daily lives, the sorry state of policing, the much derided ""Community Support Officers"", (""plastic police"" whose main job is to issue ASBOs - warning letters for criminals caught committing crimes), the presence of increasing numbers of foreigners, the outsourcing of government jobs (a key suspect escapes while in the custody of a private security contractor) and the dreaded NHS (National Health Service) where patients are left out in the corridors of overflowing hospitals like casualties in some Third World country.

Spread over 5 hours and 5 episodes, it remains riveting until near the end. The final episode does tend to drag at points. I'm not all that keen on the ending - the resolution seems to be have been plucked out of thin air, without much preparatory basis. It lacked dramatic flair - there was no ""A-ha!"" moment. It seemed to be simply tacked on to give the investigation a conclusion. That's borne out by the writer Gwyneth Hughes, who admits that she wrote the script as the filming was going on and that she didn't know until the last, how the story would end and who she would choose to be the eventual baddie. Taken as a whole however, it was a fascinating miniseries which had me glued to the screen almost to the end.

The DVD is in 1.78:1 widescreen (anamorphic) - not 1.66:1 as advertised by Amazon. Beautifully clear, sharp and accurate picture. Comes with optional English and Spanish subtitles in case the accents present a challenge. The only extra is a 13-minute interview with writer Gwyneth Hughes. May not be quite perfect but certainly well worth watching.",1206403200,105,2652,5.0204545454545455

3312850,5,B00127RAH6,"FIVE DAYS is a slow moving but ultimately rewarding British miniseries that tells the story of a drawn-out policy inquiry through a different sort of dramatic lens.  Each hourlong episode focuses on a different day of the case, the first two close together, the third a disconcertingly long time later, the fourth on a day when public interest in the case has nearly lapsed, and the fifth a year after the original police report.  Screenwriter Gwyneth Hughes sets her tale in a British suburb, apparently normal on the outside, but inwardly torn by seething disputes, broken families, and long-simmering racial tensions.  Beautiful Leanne Wellings seems to have it all, happiness with a handsome second husband, three beautiful children (two under eight years of age, and a teenaged girl), and a family heavily invested in community and heritage.  When she stops her car on sn impulse to buy some flowers for her ailing grandfather, and leaves her two youngest in the car while she hops across the road, the tension begins right there.  Somehow, you imagine, somebody is going to nab the kids right out of the car while Leanne is picking out flowers from the strange makeshift gypsy trailer parked in the ""Lay-by"" not fifty yards from a bustling expressway.  But what happens, while shocking, is not what you would suppose!

Everything you thought about any of the characters in part one gets turned on its head by episodes two and three.  The seeming closeness of Leanne's family is just an illusion, and the fact that Leanne's second husband Matt  is black serves as a bombshell for revealing much about the prejudice lurking behind the white picket fences of modern day suburbia.  David Oyelowo, whom we last saw in Kenneth Branagh's AS YOU LIKE IT and in THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND, has a field day playing embittered, passionate Matt, despised by his slutty stepdaughter Tanya and desired both by a socialminded neighbor and a policewoman drawn to him against her common sense and warnings by her superiors.

Leanne's mother and father are in their own private hell, too, as their gradual distrust of Matt builds up into a tremendous holocaust of hate and fear for the kids.  Patrick Malahide and Penelope Wilton build up thoroughly detailed portraits of these two, written by Hughes as if by Edward Albee on a really scathing day, and when you see Wilton break down at a televised press conference, able to utter only syllables and gasps, you will be thinking of Artaud or Nijinsky, while Malahide does his own transformation scene later on in the series.  But you know who steals the show, the unbelievably ribald and honest Janet McTeer as Detective Sergeant Amy Foster, a veteran cop who's been on the job far too long to have stayed 100 percent human.  She's counting down the days to the retirement and her farewell speech is among the most remarkable pieces of acting you will ever witness.

FIVE DAYS is flawed--the directors seem to have forgotten really to keep the suspense going throughout the entire length of the show--and some characters wind up spinning their wheels in familiar kitchen sink postures of deep kitsch.  In addition, you might suppose that the race issue finally becomes too complex for them to deal with, and they scurry away from it into an absurd solution lifted from an old Jean Claude Van Damme direct to video ""movie,"" but don't let these minor flaws deter you from watching this sleeper all the way to the end.",1201392000,83,3451,4.843537414965986

But by the end of the movie I came away with the realization that every move that is made by everyone around us actually plays a part in our lives and futures, and what may seem to have nothing to do with us at that point in time may actually be a turning point in our lives and can even affect our future.

""My God, this is really happening, isn't it?"" - Mrs. Poole

Five SUSPENSEFUL Stars! The 5-part mini-series ""Five Days"" is a deliberately-paced, very interesting British drama about the disappearance of not only one 'person' in the UK, but there are 'persons' who are missing for a considerable amount of time. Indeed, it takes a full 30-minutes of TV watch-time before the police discover the BIG clue and the enormity of the apparent crime. This drama really takes its sweet time developing both the plot and the characters, which only adds to its attractiveness. The ""Five Days"" are not consequtive days as the time line jumps days or weeks along the way. It is interesting how many scenes in the very beginning are of great importance later on as the plot develops and the search is on for the missing. ""Five Days"" is an excellent general crime procedural with great character studies of the complex family, the police, the media, and other people along the way. The media gets into the story big time. Starring David Oyelowo, Sarah Smart, Michelle Bonnard, Hugh Bonneville, Janet McTeer, Penelope Wilton, Patrick Malahide, Lee Massey, Tyler Anthony, Christine Tremarco, and the late, great Edward Woodward (The Equalizer, American TV series.)

3312935,2,B00127RAH6,Yuck. Sure it's 5 days. They just neglect to tell you it's 5 days out of 80 seemingly picked at random and they try to catch up the story by inserting fast-paced dialogue at the start of the episodes. Needed to be about 16 episodes.,1448582400,,232,4.177777777777778

3312937,4,B00127RAH6,Very different point of view of when a person goes missing. There's really great acting in this show. I just wish that the story would have spent more time focused on Leann's character and her story and less time for example on the (retiring Detective's party). Good show needed more closure and dragged out a lot of necessary information.,1447459200,,339,4.762711864406779

The plot sounds so simplistic but the twists and turns avoid being melodramatic and the acting in superb, thus holding your attention.

3313003,3,B00127RAH6,"A solid 5 part series with some great twists and turns.  Only issues though is that it felt like they spent larger periods of time on pieces of the story that didn't add any true value to the plot -- as well as the need to immediately go straight to Google once over to nail down the ending.

Skipping days in between is an interesting idea, but it was poorly executed as I felt I had no idea what was going on.  (Spoilers ahead)  So the woman who finds the boy start sleeping with the dad.  What?!?  A 7-year-old boy leaves his mum's phone and money in the car and takes off walking down the road? They found a cell phone but nothing ever came of it?  Why was the press liaison lady even on the show?  What was the motive for the dog guy saying he did it?  Why was the Maldovian guy dead? So so so many loose ends.  The final ""reveal"" made absolutely no sense and I still have no idea if Lee Ann was purposefully abducted or accidentally murdered or what.  What a mess!",1446163200,4,763,4.302816901408451

3313423,3,B00127RAH6,Disappointed at the ending. I liked the characters and the story flow until the last episode. It was like they ran  out of time and had to just end it. A typical 1980's style Agatha Christie type novel where the killer is introduced in the last two pages of the story and then it ends.,1445644800,,285,4.181818181818182

3313427,1,B00127RAH6,Interesting concept but rediculous story lines.  A women who was a stranger which found one of the children moves in with the family and becomes romantically connected.  Difficult to believe.  Even more difficult was the ending.  The killer was just pulled out of the air like they had to end it so about this guy?  Very poor writting.,1445558400,,335,4.706896551724138

3313463,4,B00127RAH6,"The connections here seemed to be trying to mirror the film ""Crash"" but with more of a dark twist.  The acting was hit and miss--really good with the older actors---super good with the grieving husband, but not so good with the children (one kept looking at the camera and the other acted like a zombie most of the time).  Didn't care for the retirement party for the lady detective and sometimes the series moved too slowly, but overall an interesting story.

3313625,3,B00127RAH6,"This has the name HBO so you know there is a minimum amount of quality coming with that. One would expect it to be well conceived and well executed and it is. It shows five days in the lives of a few people, namely a mother and her two kids who go missing suddenly, her husband, her parents, the one daughter who is not missing and also the police who investigate the disappearance. Like I mentioned, this is well made and if you have the patience to sit through 5 hours of an old tv show, do it.
Pros: well made, well acted, good dialogues. Does not make a mess of the various issues that arise (you will understand what I am talking about once you see the show). All the characters seem normal and humane. Even the police seem like regular day Johns and Janes not the super human or super cerebral types
Cons: a bit too dramatic at times, yes this is something that starts to bug. Especially towards the later episodes. And here comes my major gripe, the last and final twist. It is, for want of better terms, totally ridiculous, idiotic and unnecessary. And that is where I would end this review. If you don't want to sit through 5 hours of drama and be sucker punched by a plot twist that feels like something straight out a third rate detective fiction story, please avoid watching this.

3313729,4,B00127RAH6,"HBO was wise to partner with the BBC on a series. It's believable because the actors are so flawed. They are real - not the perfect looking self righteous characters coming out of Hollywood. You won't find unnecessary car chases and edge of your seat tension in this, what you will find is an heart wrenching plot that unfolds over a long period of time. This series explores the raw emotions and strains that a tragedy takes on a family. I particularly liked the self discovery that several of the actors went through -  Penelope Wilton, Hugh Bonneville, and Janet McTeer were excellent in this. I agree with some of the reviewers that not all of the characters were likable... but I think that adds to the story.",1445126400,,714,4.578125
3313760,2,B00127RAH6,"I get the concept that the story is dropping the viewer into five random days of a much longer police investigation. However, at the start of each episode I always felt like I had missed something. I always wondered if I had forgotten to watch the entire previous episode - I inevitably was lost until I figured out I was supposed to learn the ""missing"" information through dialogue. In the end, I was thoroughly confused as the eventual suspect turned out to be someone I had completely forgotten about, and I didn't catch how he was even involved.

I was annoyed that by the time I realized the ship was going down, it was too late for me to turn it around (as in, I'd invested a lot of time in this thing and wanted to see how it ended). About halfway through, turns into a soap opera. Desperately wanted to be like Collision, and failed. The character Sarah totally ill conceived--irksome, and not believable in the least. Plus the failure of any of the other characters to see her involvement with the hero as anything but radically suspicious was astonishing.

It could have easily been wrapped up in a couple of episodes.  It was mind numbing how the drama was drawn out by filling the timeline with the reactions and overdone drama of all the participants from the husband to the police to the parents and all the sub plots around the kidnapping.

 The little boy couldn't act. The old man stood up out of his wheelchair and knocked potted flowers off his window sill in a ridiculous  fit of pudgy rage and dialogue was purposely not present as if to make one feel some depth in a silly situation. For example, people not speaking up for themselves when the average person would defend himself. Or drawing out an amotion using a facial expression which wasn't needed. The singing of a lone woman during some scenes was merely annoying instead of providing some feeling of hopelessness, confusion, and loss. It was just noise. I'm sad I gave my time to this, expecting so much more. The premise seemed really prmomising, but this promise was broken. I'm not going to waste a second episode again when the first one gives such an obvious message about the future of the remaining ones.",1444694400,,1087,4.71578947368421

As I went through the 2nd to 5th episode, hence the 5 days since the actual events take place over about a month, the show began to loose its appeal and become rather mundane. The final episode was somewhat of a let down. It would be good for a binge watch on a rainy day when there is not much else to do as it is interesting enough to keep you watching till the end.

3314716,5,B00127RAH6,This story is told in five episodes. A mother goes missing and then her two children seem to be abducted. It is nicely filmed and the characters are developed. The tension is there and it does continue throughout the story. I enjoyed it and it is worth watching. I've seen criticism but not sure why. Of course there are elements that seem a bit of a reach but you watch for the story and the characters. You also watch for the outcome so it keeps your interest. It is not constant action or focused on one hero solving the mystery. It is more of a flow of characters and events and the camera follows along educating you.,1443484800,,622,4.3247863247863245

3314771,2,B00127RAH6,"I don't know if  they ran  out of money or time or both, but the series fell flat. As another reviewer mentioned, they skip over so much of the story line that you wonder if somehow you missed a scene or two. At one point, I closed the series and looked through the episode descriptions, to see if somehow I'd jumped from episode 3 to 5. But no.

The characters are drawn without depth, so it's impossible to relate to them and what they're going through. Hugh Bonneville looks like he is on his first rehearsal off script. And maybe he was. Simple human connections -- between police and the victims, for instance -- are ignored, while familial disputes are too frequent and overdone.

Then when we finally get to the **solution** to the crime, I found myself more confused than ever. I guess I could watch the last episode again but I don't really want to. The characters were too thinly drawn to care what happened to them in the end, although I hate seeing anyone beat up, kicked and abused. Still, my reason cried out for a clear answer to what exactly happened to Leanne.

Flashbacks to when Leanne was interacting with her family would have helped greatly. That and/or starting the movie before Leanne disappears. We need to see the little family having fun together, see how much Leanne loves her husband and children and they her.

There were un-redeeming plot elements where redemption was needed: the dad's 'creepy-gal' love interest; the retiring D.S. who left without seeing the case through; not enough clues pointing to different possible suspects; the specific use of, but unaddressed 18-wheeler blocking the flower stand, neither mentioned nor showing up on CCTV checks; and most importantly, a completely out-of-left-field surprise killer that did not suggest a hint of suspicion, or figure significantly in any of the episodes, making the whole five-day process seem a complete waste of time. The actors are quality, but the story's plot developed so slowly, I lost interest in their characters and their subplots quickly - and there were a LOT of extraneous, non-plot supportive characters. The kids were the most interesting theatrically of the bunch. Disappointing. Skippable.",1443139200,,934,5.360544217687075

Yes I think so as it was a fascinating plot with a mystery that I couldn't figure out until it was revealed at the end. The only thing that was sad though well played were the dysfunctional family reactions to the missing Leanne, the beautiful wife of Matt. The family blames each other at times, and splits apart at the end. However, the reactions except for those of Leanne's mother, who was bereft and sometimes cruel toward her husband, were mostly understandable which gave strength to the series. Hope to see Season Two come out on Amazon Prime.",1443052800,,689,4.52

3315097,2,B00127RAH6,"Lost me in the first installment as it asks me to extend belief beyond the impossible. Even in 2007 there was no way a child who appeared to be 10 years old and knew enough to say they are not to talk to strange men would not have first taken his mother's cell phone from her purse to call at the very least his father, if not the police rather than just to get get out and start walking with his little sister when his mother disappeared.

So I have continued watching and the kids are meant to be 5 and 7, but I still maintain that a 7 year old should know how to call emergency services and when it is appropriate and I say that as a mother.

I'm not almost done with part 4 and I agree with others who say that between some of the parts it feels like you've missed something, like you've skipped an episode even. It's not so that you can't figure out what is going on but it does take you out of the moment and is more than a little irritating.

I am now left wondering why I bothered to see this through to the end which was nonsensical and very unsatisfying.",1442966400,,1064,4.033175355450237

4 stars due to the expedited and strange ending. It had a bit of an unexpected twist that was not necessary.

3315199,4,B00127RAH6,"I thought the series was very riveting. Yes, it was slow paced but I felt unable to stop watching it. Many Brit productions are like that for me as I find Brits think differently in their film making and it is very fresh to me. I thought the first two episodes were especially entertaining.  As others have mentioned, it occasionally seemed to skip past important areas of the story leaving you to wonder if you missed something. Or to ""ASSUME"" the outcome and fill in the blanks. And there is a spot in the last 5 minutes or so of the last episode that if you blink you will miss a very important subtle visual clue that is made even more important because of the accent the accompanying  words are said in and not being able to understand the dialogue the first time. I had to rewind and watch it again because the next scene made no sense without it. The last episode was the weakest of the 5 with the first two being the best. At times it felt as if most of episode 5 was filler and they sort of didn't know what to fill it with until the end.

SPOILER WARNING!

 I do pat myself on the back for guessing correctly at the end but not because of any real clues given but because the movie fell into a common trap I see a lot in many ""who done it"" type movies.",1442361600,,1262,4.134693877551021

In any murder one hangs on to the thought that at the end you are going to find out how it all happened and tie up the loose ends.  I even found myself rewinding back to see the part where Gary comes in, although it was obvious all along he was in it somehow, and yet I still didn't really see why on earth he would have got involved.  So many parts didn't make sense, the children would have probably taken the phone with them or tried to call, and would not have just walked off.  I think to conclude, it was a bunch of great actors but they were let down by the plot, which is a shame. A lot of viewing for a very short reward.",1441756800,,764,4.073333333333333

3315445,2,B00127RAH6,"This is basically BBC's Me Too attempt to cash in on the edgy dramatic types of series being produced by American TV companies. HBO released it in the US but wasn't involved in the production itself so its a bit misleading to see HBO under the title.

As a drama it didn't work for me because of the constant over the top emotionalism combined with a de-emphasis on solving the actual mystery which made it hard to for me care what was happening to the characters. There are no heroes and no villains; just anxiety producing situations with no real resolution. Yes, they do find the guilty party but by that point I was too worn out to care.

Then there's the sound track sung by a plaintive waif voiced  girl that grates on the nerves. Generally I love plaintive waif voiced singing, like Sarah Polley in the Sweet Hereafter, but the tone of this singer's voice is more keening than singing. Every time the music came up all I could think was: ""No! Not again!"" and had to dive for the remote control.

The actors are all perfectly fine and do a good job with what they have to work with. If it had been done as a straight mystery it could have been great.",1441756800,,1156,4.337962962962963

3315800,4,B00127RAH6,"The HBO/BBC gripping mini-series, ""Five Days"" is well worth watching if you're in a binge viewing mood.  With the attention to detail that the BBC brings to each of its mysteries, the drama starts building from the first frame and you're hooked.  While it has hints of the BBC series ""Broadchurch"", it has none of that series' story side tracks.  HBO saw the underlying story line and knew it was up to their standards.

Though a British ""police procedural"" in the best sense, it keeps the action going between the victims and the authorities, with always the pending doom that you know is about to knock on their door with more and more bad news.  Great performances by Sarah Smart, Hugh Bonneville and a gritty David Oyelowo and a story line that pulls you in all adds up to the quality that HBO has built their reputation on.",1441152000,,828,4.5675675675675675

We did find out what happened, although it was a little difficult to accept as a plausible explanation.  To say I enjoyed it seems disrespectful of the emotional pain I shared with the family.  It was wrenching, but I appreciated the craft with which all the actors portrayed their roles. Parts of it reminded me of ""Crash"" as the members of the family, the policemen and women and even the perpetrator(s) interacted with each other in seemingly ordinary, everyday fashion until the final reveal.

I guess if the right decisions were made it would have been a 1/2 hour show.

***Spoiler***

1-In this day and age, you often hear of children five and under saving someone by calling the police. Why didn't the children go to the driver's seat, the mother left her bag and take the phone that was in plain sight and call the police or their father or their sister. Some children would have attempted to drive the car themselves.

2-ok they were so scared they didn't think about that. Why didn't they walk a few steps forward to where traffic was and waved for help? The police car was there and if not (for the sake of argument) someone would've seen them and helped.

Instead they decide to walk down a lonely road with no traffic where Rosie was taken.

Just didn't make sense to me.

3315973,4,B00127RAH6,"While certainly not perfect, Five Days is an absorbing, interesting look at the aftermath of the disapearrance of a young mother. Relatives, friends, cops, and journalists, as well as intruders and neighbors, are all affected in often unexpected and disturbing ways. There is of course the mystery; where is she? Did she simply leave? Or was she abducted? Murdered? That is ultimately not the central theme, nor the only reason to watch. Written with respect for the intelligence of the audience, which gives an assemblage of skilled actors often intriguing and challenging words and scenarios. Two or three things do not quite add up for me, but they do not detract from the overall impact of the drama. I would not hesitate to recommend this to a friend.",1440892800,,756,4.9140625

It is a realistic portrait of all people and families break apart with the loss of one member of the family. Very sad. Most of the acting is quite good. It's a BBC/HBO mini-series. But you have to be willing to stick with it. It drags at points. It's set in Britain. Hugh Bonneville is the senior police investigator -- I had no idea he was so young after seeing him so often on Downton Abbey. And, David Oyelowo as the husband does an excellent job of acting. He's very interesting. I couldn't figure out why it was called Five Days. The reason is that covers 5 days in the investigation -- first, Day 1, then Day 3, then Day 28, etc.",1440806400,,787,4.253333333333333

As if this weren't enough to make the viewer completely frustrated, the supporting storyline for the final payoff was so weak that the only loss I mourned when it was over was for the 5 lost hours I'd put into it.

Practically the entire cast composed of quarrelsome individuals whose only skill is throwing tantrums.
Overdose of gratuitous sex escapades, mostly in very poor taste.

Instead,  it's about human emotions of the people secondary to the crime. In other words, it's not about the suspects or the victims. It's about the crying, screaming and whining of family and friends of the victim, and their reactions and life changes after being on the periphery of a crime. Last, it dragged.

There are some great actors and characters in the series and the potential is there for it to be really good. I can't quite put my finger on the problem, perhaps it was the editing, perhaps direction, but the story flow just isn't there. Some important elements flash by with little or no explanation and some characters lines are totally superfluous. Having committed to the series the final episode seemed to be a total mess. Janet McTeer, Patrick Malahide and Hugh Bonneville put in a good performances, which unfortunately magnifies the less strong acting.

3316600,3,B00127RAH6,"Somewhat typical Hollywood plot but had interesting twists.  Was able to pick out the ""friend"" as the culprit only because he was the least likely suspect - typical Hollywood.  Some scenes & dialogue were poorly written - my opinion but one in particular proved rather factual - when the lead detective commented on the number of CCTVs per capita yet the crime went ""unspied"" (my word).  Also, my opinion again, how many 7-year olds would have left the cell phone behind?  How many 7-year olds are cell phone savvy today and would have used it?

 It took them a very long time to tell this story and resolve the plot and after a while I really did not care that much . it was all very dramatic and involved lots of tears and I mean lots of tears except for the children who seemed quite stoic or maybe they were hoping if they could get it right they could now go out and play !!

All these random things like grandparents, and parents not getting along with their children, lost cell phones, affairs, lying, cheating, cops babysitting, dogs, moving in with a new girl out of the blue.  So many people connected to this case that just all happen to be at the same gym, retirement home, park, etc all at the same time on many occasions was totally ridiculous.

I enjoyed the glimpse into British life, but not sure how accurate it is - I know British tax rates are high, but do they really have enough money to assign an officer almost full-time to the families of missing persons, to do their dishes and act as nanny?

After 4.75 hours of reasonably well written, reasonably well acted drama, we get the answer we've been watching for all this time: Of course! It's Gary, the person who is never shown interacting with any of the other two culpable characters, who has no motivation whatsoever to be involved (other than his concern about his retirement money being insufficient), who has nothing to do with Branko (who we also barely see at all). What garbage!  It's as though the writer just threw a dart at the wall and said, ""Ok, it's Gary."" Especially in light of the wealth of alternate possibilities that would have made sense, eg. Sarah.

I suspected early on who the real ""bad guy"" was, but that didn't change the fact that this was a terrifying, gritty,sad story that kept me on the edge of my seat through the whole thing.  Watched all five episodes in two sittings....but had to stop myself from jumping to the last episode to find out for sure.  Read one review that said this was so not like real life, but I disagree.  The dysfunctional relationships displayed, the animosities amongst family members, are all too realistic.  And the crimes committed, even the motives involved, are not so far fetched...one only has to watch the news or talk to friends and family to see how real this could be.  As for this movie being slow (as several reviewers have stated)....it was never meant to be an action movie, but something of a psychological thriller.  I had no problem staying totally with it from start to finish and watching every moment for fear I might miss some small thing that would keep me from understanding the whole story.",1436918400,,1032,4.668508287292818

Some of the detective aspects are weak.  Without giving too much away, they never seem to interrogate anyone very well, especially the kids who were involved in a lot of the story and a couple other key characters.  If you watch a lot of Law and Order you'll be wondering why they cops keep guessing at things and not really interrogating everyone more successfully.

3317788,5,B00127RAH6,this was an excellent mini series - as only the Brits can do it.  Suspensful exciting with a nice twist at the end - I highly recommend it - once I started watching I could not stop.,1436400000,,182,3.918918918918919

3317790,4,B00127RAH6,Very intense. I am familiar with many of the actors. It is interesting to see them in more modern roles. You will want to watch the series in its entirety.,1436400000,,155,4.2

3317795,4,B00127RAH6,"It's a good series to binge watch on a rainy weekend because you can watch the whole series in 5 hours. It's about a woman and her children who mysteriously go missing.  I would say that it is good, but not great. Cant compare it to Game of Thrones of course....but it's entertaining none the less.

Fans of Broadchurch will appreciate the show's focus on the effects of crime on witnesses, innocent bystanders and the people who investigate the crime(s). It's not as fast-paced a series as its five episodes might indicate, and things tend to get a little convoluted and convenient toward the end, but it's highly satisfactory.

3317867,4,B00127RAH6,I really liked the series and want to see more. It is an intelligent mystery story that keeps you and the police guessing.  Maybe you are one step ahead of the investigators. A woman disappears in plain sight from the side of a highway while her children wait in the car. It doesn't get more mysterious than that!,1436140800,,313,4.396551724137931

3318014,3,B00127RAH6,Not exactly the storyline that I expected. The characters were under developed and uninteresting. The pace of the story was frantic and disjointed. It seemed to try to include the story of too many characters without the time to develop the stories enough to make them interesting and still conclude the plot of the original mystery. Maybe if the storyline could have been extended  along with the number of episodes this show would be more easily followed. Unfortunately it was not as good as I felt it could have been.

Many reviews have mentioned the slow pace but I don't mind that ... in fact I prefer the way most British shows seem to have a slower pace than American ones, who try to pack in too much 'action' in a short time frame just for the sake of it.  This show touches on a lot of different issues without hitting you over the head with any of them. A good mix of suspenseful and subtle.",1435449600,,487,4.0625

If you're thinking of watching this show, STOP, find another show. Both BBC or HBO make great programs that are available here on Amazon prime video. Watch something else.",1435104000,,443,5.253521126760563
3318226,5,B00127RAH6,"The Brits excel at the genre that combines drama with mystery and suspense. FIVE DAYS is another winner. Let's start with the fantastic class. Penelope Wilton is one of England's grand ""mature"" actresses and here she is with a more youthful Hugh Bonneville--both later reunited in DOWNTON ABBEY. And also starring is David Oyelowo the recent star of the acclaimed SELMA. Here is a cast of British actors, you may recognize and will certainly enjoy.
FIVE DAYS is a modest 5 episodes that follows the mysterious disappearance of a lovely young mother literally in front of her two young children. The children start searching for her mother and soon are missing. There are the countless twists and turns as the police race to find the mother and her children. Was she murdered or did she just run off with her lover? Would a loving mother just abandon her children by the side of the road? A distraught father and husband becomes the center of the investigation.
The show delves into the complex relationship of the family and of the police investigators. There is no shortage of romance and sex and suspected improprieties. It's fascinating to follow interpersonal relationships and innuendos and misperceptions.
You'll be hooked immediately on the mystery of the missing mother and on all the wonderful and brilliant actors. A special nod to Sarah Smart who unintentionally gets directly involved in the investigation and with the distraught husband. She has her own secret and the mysteries and exposes keep coming. You'll wish the series had a few more episodes.",1435104000,,1564,4.996168582375479

3318366,5,B00127RAH6,Great show,1434499200,,10,4.5
3318367,4,B00127RAH6,Overly dramatic from the cinematography to the acting to the music.  I suspect a cultural disconnect given this BBC five part series creates such a huge story over a missing woman.  The number of investigators once the case opens up is amazing and shows the difference between American culture with thousands of annual murders and British culture with this big case resonating in the lives of the main characters over 5 nights.  The interracial marriage and second marriage angle adds an interesting twist.,1434412800,,506,5.072289156626506
3318368,3,B00127RAH6,"This is a fast action packed program with lots of sub plots that keep your interest. The acting is very good and the writing is not bad.

3318393,3,B00127RAH6,"It was 2 mysteries wrapped in one.  I think the reason I'm giving it a low reviw is that, given the choice again, perhaps I would have skipped over it.  It was kind of hammy in the acting department, except for David Oyelowo, the father. I thought he did a great job.  But I can't bear the blonde woman detective, who retires, she's an awful actress, in my opinion. Sorry I can't remember their names, but the other one I do, Hugh Bonneville, did a good job, also. So,  all in all if you like mysteries, it's good....just good. Again just in my opinion. I was going to give it 2 stars, but re-thought it and will give it 3 stars, as it is a good mystery that keeps you guessing.",1434412800,,678,4.152671755725191

The last episode was a total waste and I wondered why I started watching it at all. Acting was fine but the plot just didn't develop well.

Additionally, there are waaaaay too many characters to keep track of, many disappearing for episodes at a time. More than that, the final villain isn't even hinted at until a dying confession of a suspect in the final 5 minutes. Altogether, after the middle of Episode 2, the ""mystery"" exists only because of bad writing (gosh, how many characters act against their own earlier-established characters) and withheld information. Watched it to the end to see who dunnit, but felt cheated. Some good acting (the top detective, the victim's daughter), a lot of bad acting (the 2nd detective, the victim's mother) and a LOT of unessential side characters taking up time just to fill out each episode.",1433808000,4,929,5.038961038961039

3318606,4,B00127RAH6,"I liked it but the investigative work was shoddy.  The kids were found by mere accident.  The wife died because she was a snob to a friend of her husband.  The story says the CCTV cameras couldn't identify the vehicle that snatched the mother while buying roadside flowers because of a blind spot but the time of the crime was know which would have allowed CCTV cameras see the vehicle shortly after the vehicle left the blind spot and it would have shown the flower truck too.  Also, near the end of the story evidence showed that the mother was hurt accidently which says that the blind spot in the CCTV camera at the scene of the crime had nothing to do with premeditated abduction.  The mother shouldn't have died.  The kidnapper of the daughter and the flower seller witness had no real reason to hide what the knew about the mother's disappearance either.",1433808000,,861,4.558441558441558

3318842,2,B00127RAH6,"A young mother takes two of her children to visit her grandad in a nursing home. Along the way, they stop to adopt a shelter dog and Mum stops to buy flowers from a roadside lorry. Mum is never seen again and the children, abandoned, leave the car and disappear. What has happened to all of them? Are they dead or alive? Thus begins what could have been an exciting 2-hour police murder/kidnap mystery. The problem is the extended format - five long episodes when maybe two would have been adequate. To sustain the story, the writers must include a great deal of extraneous material, red herrings, detours, false arrests, suspects coming out of the woodwork, details about everybody's personal life and on and on ad nauseam, with a bit of racism thrown in for good measure. And most of these characters are unlikable and behave badly, with the possible exception of the shelter dog. When the case is - finally - solved, the solution comes out of left field and is deeply unsatisfying. The cast, including the great Janet Mcteer, perform valiantly, but are wasted in this production. This format - a crime investigated over an entire season - has become very popular. Think ""The Killing"" and ""The Bridge,"" both of which are better and more focused.

I was mad that I felt like I wasted FIVE HOURS. There was no reason Matt's Army buddy would throw his wife's ""thought to be dead"" body in the lake or even help the flower man and Kyle do that after a 'flower purchase gone bad' accident to Matt's wife. I give this movie a 1 for stupid ending - it was cruel and ditto to another reviewer the ""resolution seems to be have been plucked out of thin air, without much preparatory basis. It lacked dramatic flair - there was no ""A-ha!"" moment. It seemed to be simply tacked on to give the investigation a conclusion. That's borne out by the writer Gwyneth Hughes, who admits that she wrote the script as the filming was going on and that she didn't know until the last, how the story would end and who she would choose to be the eventual baddie.""",1432339200,4,935,4.2
3318902,1,B00127RAH6,"Five Days involves the disappearance of a young mother, and covers a 79-day period of time in 5 episodes, each dedicated to one day in that 79-day stretch of time.  While a welcome departure from the usual TV/movie formula, days (in some cases, weeks) of story time pass between episodes and events that take place ""off the air"" make watching episodes 3, 4, and 5 feel like you were gone from the room to get a snack longer than you thought and missed significant chunks of the plot.

With a better script, this issue could have been overcome, but Five Days' characters can't carry the load; they are so poorly-developed, their actions and motivations, when not cliche, contradicting, or raggedly shifting from scene to scene like an old TR6, are often simply inexplicable.

Yet even with these glaring flaws, I opted to hang on to the end, so I can only blame myself.  Halfway through the final installment the wheels came so completely off the bus I began to resent the time I'd invested in the first four episodes.  A 5-plus hour show needs a worthy plot -- not necessarily James Pattersonesque twist-after-twist-after-twist into the implausible, but a neat, satisfying conclusion.  Five Days (semi-spoiler-alert) merely throws a handful of main characters into a cliche fray with unrealistic dialogue all too common in TV shows where the bad guys spell out exactly what they did.  Even more groan-worthy in this case is that shortly before the evil-doers conveniently have an argument to let us know what happened, the lead detective (with conjecture not seen since circa 1990 episodes of Murder She Wrote) suggests a theory of the case based upon the skimpiest of evidence that turns out to be dead on.  Unfortunately, that the detective ends up being right doesn't make him look like a shrewd investigator, but a character in a show where the real mystery is: how did this thing ever get made?",1432339200,98,1899,4.839506172839506

Consequently, the viewer is moved along at a very rapid pace and left to draw their own conclusions to a number of events and fill in gaps between episodes.

This approach quickly loses focus and sustaining mood and ultimately leaves us feeling uninvolved and without sympathy or empathy for any of the victims.  They all come across as self-involved whiners - clearly not the intention and clearly not a reaction the viewer wants to have.

3318957,5,B00127RAH6,"""Five Days""
This joint production of the BBC and HBO is a taut, yet elegant murder mystery that will keep you guessing right up until the end. When a young mother of three vanishes by the side of a British highway, leaving her children stranded in their car, a family is thrown in upheaval, as is the local police department, which finds the high-profile disappearance to be a difficult case to crack.  Fans of BBC shows such as ""Prime Suspect"" will find themselves in familiar territory here, in a miniseries packed with strong performances by unfamiliar, immensely talented actors, aided by a strong, intelligent script and handsome cinematography.  This show's particular strength is in its fine-grained, thoughtful exploration of the forceful, torturous emotional reverberations that murders can have on loved ones.  The real psychological costs of homicide, which mainstream media often ignores or presents in trivialized or stick-figure form, are here presented at length, and revisited in episode after episode, much as they might revisit the victims of crime in real life.  There's a lot more emotional substance here than you might be used to seeing, and plenty of fine character work as well. You'll be drawn in and well rewarded for your time. It's a bit depressing, but definitely worth watching. (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1225065600,3,1344,5.179723502304148
