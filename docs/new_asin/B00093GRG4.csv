though I do not speak a lick of French, I was able to understand what was going on throughout the entire film. The ending will totally surprise you. If you haven't seen this movie, buy it, rent it, do whatever you need to do to see it. It will be well worth the effort.",1304899200,,480,4.322222222222222
