1883374,4,B00009KNX6,"I bought this movie when I saw it was from the Producers of Anne of Green Gables.  I love those movies.  While this won couldn't hold a candle to the Anne movies, it was still enjoyable none the less.  After seeing Henry Czerny in Revenge, it was quite weird to see him in a role like this, but I thought he did an outstanding job and I just loved his character.  Shawn Ashmore did an amazing job with his character.  To see him in X-Men or The Following and then see him play a deaf kid (which he really had me convinced that he was deaf in real life...if it wasn't for the fact that I had see him in other shows and movies).  It's a good clean family movie and I'm so glad I purchased it.",1392854400,5,690,4.0
1883375,5,B00009KNX6,"This was a very nice family movie. There were a few tense scenes for younger children, but all and all had a very nice ending.",1392681600,,126,4.08
1883376,5,B00009KNX6,"Czerny plays the role of a reluctant hero who must face the realities of sexual exploitation of women and the inhuman treatment of the handicapped in the late 19th century new world.  Excellent settings, costuming, and presentation of daily life as well as the development of plot.",1378857600,3,281,4.9787234042553195

1883379,4,B00009KNX6,My only complaint with this otherwise good movie is the ending left me hanging.  It could have been run another ten minutes to wrap things up more neatly.,1355443200,4,154,4.5
1883380,5,B00009KNX6,A very wonderful movie. I'd highly recommend it to anyone that would like watching a western type movie that is set in the 1920's era.,1350000000,,134,4.4
1883381,5,B00009KNX6,"I thought this was an excellent family movie. It was a pleasure not to worry about  holding the remote in preparedness to hit fast forward because of profanity an illicit scenes. I also enjoyed the female character, who showed much insight in business matters yet not overbearing.",1264982400,9,280,4.957446808510638
1883382,2,B00009KNX6,"Even though this movie was produced by the same people that produced Anne of Green Gables, the two cannot even be compared. There was nothing inappropriate, it was just a boring story line. It is very hard to connect with the characters. A little disappointing. . . and boring.",1203984000,4,277,4.673469387755102

7990913,5,B00009KNX6,"A great movie to watch. It has all the love given to a deaf and dumb boy and his friend who was there to help him accomplish all that no one else could do. There can be wonderful movies without all sex,bad language and lying etc. AS a matter of fact i ordered two of this movie to give to a friend of mine.",1431043200,3,306,3.796875
