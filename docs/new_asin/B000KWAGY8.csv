2697851,5,B000KWAGY8,"Season 2 was every bit as amazing as season 1 was! As someone who loves the Halo universe (even though I am a complete failure at PLAYING the games) I am loving this interesting and hilarious parody/satirical view of gaming, Science fiction movies, and military life. Season two sets the stage for some priceless death humor you'll see in season three, and like the first season, delivers all types of humor--in your face zingers, political/military/game satire, the occasional play on words, and subtle running jokes both visual and verbal.

I wish that the writers of this series would put it in book form--as a series, it reminds me in ways of Harry Harrison's Bill The Galactic Hero or Stainless Steel Rat. I can't really quantify why I say that--but it does have that special ""flavor"" for me. As with the first one, I was ROFLMAO almost all the way through, and it's really tough to limit myself to one season every few days.",1437436800,,930,4.705521472392638

2697893,5,B000KWAGY8,"Red vs. Blue is a Machinima comedy series based on the XBox game Halo.

The series takes place on an alien planet, where two armies, (Red Team and Blue Team), are at war with each other in the middle of a box canyon, (Blood Gulch). Although there isn't a lot of fighting, there is a lot of humorous bickering.

I had the pleasure of viewing all 100+ episodes and spoof Public Service Announcements created by Rooster Teeth Productions. The writing and humor is BRILLIANT. The characters are well-developed and have their own distinct personalities.

If you're looking for a good laugh and a lot of memorable quotes, I highly recommended watching this series on DVD. This is easily the most hilarious thing that has come from the internet.",1411516800,,738,4.75

2697947,5,B000KWAGY8,"Sure, they've suffered some fatalities and mechanical issues... and sure, Caboose is apparently possessed by someone called O'Malley.

But for the most part, things are looking up for our space marine friends... until they look back down again. ""Red Vs. Blue: Season Two"" is a bit more polished as a story, with a solid plot alongside the wacky hijinks of the assorted space marines -- it's still got plenty of random funny (""if anybody makes my girlfriend cranky and psychotic, it's gonna be me!"") but it's a bit more meshed together.

Blue Command finally sends a field medic, DuFresne, about three months after the second person DIED. While he's giving a physical to the Blues, the Reds decide to attack the Blue base... only to run out of ammunition. In the mayhem, Church's robot legs stop working, and he accidentally hijacks the Warthog at a distance and turns it against Sarge. The only way to stop this? A little switch between his legs.

But when Tex's ghost reappears, she reveals a not-very-shocking fact: the AI known as O'Malley has now entered Caboose's body -- which forces her and Church to go into Caboose's cavernous skull to find him. Unfortunately, they encounter projections of how Caboose sees everyone around him (""I love Caboose and yet I'm still afraid of him!""). Meanwhile, Sarge decides to turn one of the Reds into a cyborg, and Lopez falls in love, which may unleash the robopocalypse on Blood Gulch.

While the first season was mostly people running around dying and failing, ""Red Vs. Blue Season 2"" manages to introduce a bunch of funny subplots. The Red and Blue teams still make ineffectual attacks on each other while sniping (""there's a very fine line between not listening, and not caring. I like to think that I walk that line every day of my life""), but there's a bit more going on than aimless fighting (such as when the Warthog attacks Sarge).

It also refines the characters a little more. Despite being dead, Church is still the most competent member of the team, and he barely tolerates his still-living teammates and their idiocies (especially when he discovers just how dim Caboose is). Sarge is even more insane, possibly because of a childhood trauma involving a garden hose, and the new guy Dufresne (aka ""Doc"") quickly gets sucked into the madness.

Also, this season sees the return of Mexican robot marine Lopez, who was previously subverted by Church's possession. He seems to have decided to rebel against his fleshy captors, fix everything, and fall in love (""Okay Lopez, get inside Sheila and do your business."" ""Estoy consiguiendo muy sudoroso"").

The animation is still pretty rough machinima-style, which works best with the space marines -- when you see the dude at Blue Command (whose hobby is TMI) his pixelated eyes stare right into your soul. But the writing is what keeps this story afloat, especially since the writing is now a bit less dependent on swearing, and a bit more dependent on wit, inference and the occasional batch of absurdity (""Do you have any food? I like to eat ALL the food!"").

""Red Vs. Blue: Season Two"" smooths out some of the wrinkles left from the first season -- more plot, slightly more sophisticated comedy, and lots of crazy people doing stuff that isn't in their best interest. And there's more to come, people. Lots more.",1402185600,,3316,4.835978835978836
2697948,5,B000KWAGY8,"I've never played Halo and don't need to to enjoy this video.

Yes there is foul language and innuendo but certainly not as bad as some stuff on Cartoon Network Adult Swim or even some of the acid-induced crap on Nicktoons that are actually aimed at kids.  This is comedic fan fiction and it plays on the idea of the multiplayer Halo where everyone wants to be a Spartan and everyone thinks there awesome.  The elements of the games are incorporated well and the story has been growing over the years.  I recommend for any fans of Halo to check out this whole series,1376870400,,579,4.333333333333333

2698054,5,B000KWAGY8,i love how funny it is with church dealing with caboose and his stupidity is just so hilarious i recommend it to anyone who loves comedy,1367366400,,136,4.269230769230769
2698055,5,B000KWAGY8,I have always loved Red Vs. Blue. Its a great show that is hilarious. I am now happy that I can check this out in simple hi-rez format so I don't have to keep clicking between episodes. I am already almost done with season 3 which is awesome.,1366329600,,242,4.0625
2698056,5,B000KWAGY8,Highly entertaining! The plots are not high intellect but that is the norm in the entertainment world anyway. The humor is good and more than outdoes anything on tv.,1364774400,,165,4.724137931034483
2698057,3,B000KWAGY8,"These are fun for Halo fans it is really interesting to see how they manipulate the ""engine"". Seeing the masterchiefs  in these more ordinary circumstances.",1363305600,,156,5.24
2698058,2,B000KWAGY8,"I am sure it took a long time to create and hats off to the people who made it, but not my thing.",1363219200,,97,3.260869565217391
2698089,5,B000KWAGY8,Definitely one of the best uses for a video game that I have ever seen. Must see for all halo fans.  Will laugh the entire time,1363046400,,127,3.8846153846153846
2698090,4,B000KWAGY8,"For those who love Red vs Blue, this is definitely a great video. Has all the season 2 episodes together seamlessly with better visuals, but my main problem with it is that the episodes are edited together so that the last part of each episode is cut off. This wouldnt be that bad, but this is where most of the best jokes are and its a shame that they're cut off. For example, from Season 1, ep2. ""Whats the name of that Mexican Lizard? Eats all the goats?"" ""Chupathingy, how bout that?"" which was one of my favorite lines was completely removed. The same goes for Sarge's list of drinks from this seasons episodes. While its a small thing, it still bothers me but not enough to not recommend it. This is still great and I'l always love RvB.",1362528000,,742,4.345323741007194
2698091,4,B000KWAGY8,Fun Series. I just with the language was toned down a bit. If the language wasn't so rough I'd give it 5 stars.,1362009600,,111,3.869565217391304
2698092,5,B000KWAGY8,"great dialogue!  you kinda need to pay attention to get the full effect, but I really enjoyed it!!  worth trying out",1360627200,,116,4.476190476190476
2698093,5,B000KWAGY8,"As long as you can get passed the halo characters, this is simply one of the greatest sitcoms i have seen. the characters make sense, the humor will keep you watching, and the action will grasp the little attention span that is left over. this is a great season, and should get a lot more credit than it is",1358553600,,306,4.203389830508475
2698094,1,B000KWAGY8,This product was bought on a whim. I was amazed at how bad it was. Poorly concieved and executed. No story no plot no action.,1358467200,,125,4.04
2698095,5,B000KWAGY8,If you want a good laugh and can follow a video game based movie this one is the one for you.,1351900800,2,93,3.4761904761904763
2698096,5,B000KWAGY8,if you like action/comedy you will love this series i mean its awsome but addicting (i have watched the series 3 times),1345593600,,119,4.454545454545454
2698097,5,B000KWAGY8,"This little thing is funny, even if you aren't a fan of video games.  In fact, personally, I hate Halo, and find this stuff hilarious.",1337385600,,134,4.36
2698098,5,B000KWAGY8,"I am a huge fan of Rooster Teeth and Red Vs Blue. Season 2 might be my favorite season. Church dealing with Lopez's body with the ""help"" of Tucker and Caboose makes for some really funny scenes, and sets up some solid jokes in season 3. I wouldn't suggest watching any season without seeing the seasons before it...Not everyone will like this series, but those that do will love it.",1335398400,8,382,4.4714285714285715
2698137,1,B000KWAGY8,Not funny and not interesting do not pay for bad content like this this is a hige dissappointment overall and I cannot recommend it for anyone,1331164800,3,142,4.5
2698138,1,B000KWAGY8,This was a useless waste of time. Why is this even on Amazon? I don't know. This is not worth anything at all. utter garbage. That is my honest review.,1330819200,3,151,4.066666666666666

2698140,5,B000KWAGY8,"Season 2 of RvB is, surprisingly, even funnier than season one. Even if you don't play Halo you'll appreciate the witty banter and rapport between the various characters. If you don't find this funny then your funny bone is broken.",1325894400,8,231,4.8
2698141,5,B000KWAGY8,"While season 1 of the Blood Gulch chronicles is a definite classic, I believe seasons 2 and 3 might be my favorite of the 5 season arc.  Burnie Burns and crew really hit their stride with balancing the story exposition and comedy.

If you are a comedy fan who enjoys video games, you owe it to yourself to watch at least the first two seasons of Red vs. Blue.  I promise you won't be disappointed.",1323648000,3,397,4.266666666666667
2698142,4,B000KWAGY8,"I don't have the first season but I definitely think this is a very funny and delightfully goofy season. And because there's no time travel, it's not as confusing as the third season. :-p",1235433600,,187,4.529411764705882
2698143,4,B000KWAGY8,"Not as funny as the first, but the creators were smart enough to add new characters, twist the plot here and there, and make fun at their own creation.  The extras include commentary, outtakes, deleted scenes, and some of the jokes are so funny as to cause me pain.  I just love the Sarge.  He could kill everybody and just stand there and talk about anything.  He is such a cool character.
There is one change, from season one.  There seems to be less cussing, overall.  But still not for kids.",1221436800,2,495,4.384615384615385

2698145,4,B000KWAGY8,"Teenage angst meets video games. I thought it was repetitive, but my teens love it. Cartoon violence, absurdity, and Sartre on a DVD.  I'm an old dork, so it doesn't appeal to me.",1202860800,,179,4.424242424242424
2698146,5,B000KWAGY8,The hilarity continues in season two.  Great stuff.  You'd think they would run out of ideas when using such limited material.  I think that's what makes this series so great.  It only gets better and I can't wait to get the third!,1200528000,,231,4.428571428571429
8159301,5,B000KWAGY8,Good video.  If you are a fan of Halo then this is really entertaining.  Not for the youngest of viewers due to some of the older streams of thought more common to teenagers.,1474848000,,174,4.242424242424242
8159302,1,B000KWAGY8,"This should have stayed on YouTube. Don't bother even checking it out. It seems to be written and produced by 15 year old boys.
