4236520,5,B003ZWT8JO,"When i was in elementary school, i was in a program for advanced students.  we watched this at the end of every year, and we looked forward to it every year.  it was one of my fondest memories of that program.  six years later, i finally found it and ordered it, and watching it brings back all of those great memories.  sure, the story is totally out of whack, but the message that the story conveys is great.  it doesnt matter who you are or who your parents are, but if you have someone that loves you and takes care of you, it is the greatest thing in the world.  i'd reccomend it to anyone, and only hope it becomes more available in the future because i know of a few friends who want their own copies...",1041292800,9,710,4.145985401459854

4236523,4,B003ZWT8JO,"A great children's story with so many off-color references it's mindblowing.  The factory's obsession with ""Perfection"" being an obvious Nazi reference and I couldn't stop laughing when I noticed that every last one of the factory kids was ginger.  Great movie, fun to watch but seriously messed up if you look too closely.  I do say I loved polly's cooking skills.",1431475200,,365,4.950819672131147

4236534,4,B003ZWT8JO,"'Konrad' premiered 10/13/1985 on the PBS network (Public Broadcast Service) ""WonderWorks"" series, notwithstanding that Imdb.com considers WonderWorks to be a production company and a distributer but not a TV series. Although 'Konrad' was released 10/19/2010 on DVD by Timeless Media Group, the disc was mastered from videotape rather than from film so its apparent resolution remains that of videotape rather than the finer resolution a DVD is capable of displaying when it is mastered from film. This DVD's images also exhibit some artifacts (anomalies) characteristic of videotape, including irregular black edges on the sides and top of the frame and flashes of white across the top of the frame. Note that, since 'Konrad' was produced for television, it may have been shot on videotape rather than film, in which case this DVD could be as good as this movie can get. When played on a computer, the pointer may not activate the single option of the DVD menu (Play), so some keyboard combination, such as Enter, may be needed to start the movie.",1329177600,7,1047,5.057803468208093

I gave a 4 Stars for movie but when come to Picture quality then I will give 2 Stars.",1328832000,,114,3.6
4236536,4,B003ZWT8JO,"I love this movie! It brings back good memories of watching it with my brother when we were kids. I have been trying to find it for years!! A yr or two ago, I found a VHS copy, but wanted DVD. And when I discovered the DVD I was so thrilled! The copy I received is mostly good, except the movie doesn't start when you press play on the movie's start menu. I had to open it up from another program to get it to play (though the play button still didn't work).",1320105600,,458,3.935483870967742
4236537,4,B003ZWT8JO,"Although this movie might be just a little silly at times, it does carry some weighty topics such as families that are perhaps not as typical as others and the message that perfection is not always such a great goal.",1297382400,,216,4.425
4236538,4,B003ZWT8JO,"Huckleberry Fox was in a film entitled ""Mis-understood"" starring Gene Hackman and Henry Thomas, with June Brown as the nanny.

Konrad is an odd little film in the fact that the child did not suffocate whilst in transit.

Huckleberry Fox looked cute in the extreme and the woman who got him by accident reminded me of an eccentric next door neighbour when I was a little younger than I now am.
The young Fox has a Beatle mop and seems to have the most un-describable expression ever.  He arrives naked but we never see anything we shouldn't, (phew, that's a relief!).  He is given some clothes that would never be found in a house where an older person lived, so she must have spent a small fortune on clothes for him.

Over all he has a rocky ride throughout the film, but he manages to stay put by some means or other.  A good one for kids of a similar age to Huck at that time (about eight years old).",1290643200,,903,4.2823529411764705

4236540,5,B003ZWT8JO,"I was five years old when this movie came out. I'm not sure how old I was when I watched it for the first time, but I was way too young. For the longest time I was filled with horrific images that my imagination ran away with from this movie. This movie has never left my memory banks and I so desperately want to see it again! Now that I'm older, I'm hoping it won't give me nightmares!",1198195200,,387,3.9743589743589745

8411179,4,B003ZWT8JO,I have been looking for this movie for years. It is such an adorable story and I'm glad I get to add it to my collection!!,1508716800,,122,3.730769230769231
8411180,4,B003ZWT8JO,"This film I think was shot very poorly. Just about all the shots I think are extremely amateurish and not well captured; like it was done by a home video camera by an inexperienced teenager or something. It could of been done far better I think. Other than that though, Huckleberry Fox I believe does a fine job of holding the story together and Polly Holliday; wow! For the first time I've seen this woman do a real performance. Ned Beatty as always holds his own in a fine way. In spite of the rather amateurish shots, I think this a film you'll enjoy a whole lot. Has great promise.",1494288000,,585,4.327272727272727
8411181,5,B003ZWT8JO,I have been looking for this movie forever. I remember watching it when I was a kid. It's still just as good as I remembered.,1491696000,,125,4.04
8411182,5,B003ZWT8JO,"I used to love this movie as a child. Watched it so many times that my mother threw it out cause she got tired of watching it. Don't know what made me think of Konrad, but I was glad to find it here on amazon and now that I'm grown...I get to watch it as much as I want to, lol. Great movie. Brought back a lot of memories and it brought me to tears within the first 10 minutes.",1486166400,,378,3.7375
8411183,4,B003ZWT8JO,"Oh man, this is the best worst B to C movie I've seen and yet it's so wedged into my memory. It's TERRIBLE, but in being terrible, it's enthralling. I imagine it would be something I'd watch at 3am with nothing better to do.",1478304000,,224,4.113636363636363
