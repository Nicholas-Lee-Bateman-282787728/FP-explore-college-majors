8100973,5,B000CR7X4C,The advanced yoga CD is my favorite yoga workout (and I'm a certified yoga instructor)!  It hits every part of your body.,1472083200,,121,4.5
8100974,5,B000CR7X4C,"i am not into the spiritual aspect of yoga, but it like the exersice routine in these yoga videos.  have not tried the pilates dvds yet.",1400284800,,136,4.230769230769231
8100975,5,B000CR7X4C,"I HAD BOUGHT THIS SERIES YEARS AGO & LOVED IT! THEN THE KIDS TURNED THEM INTO COASTERS!

I LOVE HOW BASIC THE SERIES IS....NO BEACH PILATES, NO DISCO PILATES, JUST GREAT INSTRUCTION & TECHNIQUES!",1381190400,,195,4.735294117647059
8100976,4,B000CR7X4C,"The videos provide nicely arranged workouts. They have just enough instruction to help beginners learn correct methods while reminding intermediate practitioners to maintain correct form.  The music is very pleasant and nicely done but remains in the background where it should be.  I took off a star only because in a couple of places the audio editing was a little faulty and a few of the instructions were slightly unclear and some instructions were repeated twice in places they didn't quite fit.  Otherwise, after going through the workouts several times, the audio can be followed easily, almost without seeing the video.  It allows you to focus on performing the correct position and posture in a very calm, meditative way.  Really nice.",1369353600,,744,5.115702479338843
8100977,5,B000CR7X4C,"I like the instructors in this. It's clear and consistent. I also like that all the videos show people at different levels, which makes it easier to follow. I have been using the vinyasa yoga DVD for years, and it is still one of my favorite workouts.",1360972800,2,251,4.361702127659575
8100978,5,B000CR7X4C,"I'm a trail runner, and have scoliosis, and my hips (one more than the other), get very tight, as do my low back, my calves, and my feet. The Yoga workout in this collection makes a HUGE difference in my running. This DVD (and I'm specifically referring to the yoga disc in the collection) has some relaxation elements, but is more about building strength and flexibility. I always feel looser and more relaxed, and if I do it a few times a week, I have a lot less discomfort in my lower body when I run. There is a bit of core and upper body work as well, (I think of the shoulders, specifically), but I'd say the biggest benefit is to the hips.",1352160000,5,646,4.217741935483871
8100979,5,B000CR7X4C,I am very pleased with this purchase. This is the best yoga video i own. The pilates is awesome too. I really feel great after I do these DVDs. The instruction is great.,1342137600,3,169,4.151515151515151
8100980,5,B000CR7X4C,"After I hurt my back, I began doing the Basic Yoga CD in this collection and little by little, it has helped me increase flexibility and muscle strength.  I highly recommend it if your muscles are stiff and need to retrain you body in basic movements.  I began doing the basic exercises about three times a week, and now I can't see my days without a daily work out.  I tried doing the advance one, but it is still too much for my back, so I am staying with the basic, at least for a while.

A great way to begin my days!",1289433600,,521,4.029126213592233
8100981,4,B000CR7X4C,"Very easy to follow.  With a combination of beginning instruction to
a full body workout that's hard to beat.",1183766400,4,109,4.7368421052631575
