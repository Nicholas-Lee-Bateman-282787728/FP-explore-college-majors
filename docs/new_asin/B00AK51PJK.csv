Amazing how nature can help humans in so many ways if only humans understood that they are only a small part of the whole equation. Don't tell that to those Californians who continuously act as the champions of immigration, environment and equality where their achievements is nothing but disgrace in comparison to those in Zanzibar Archipelago. Only if one could get it through the heads of those careless Californians. Amazing.",1411344000,2,1856,5.608540925266904
