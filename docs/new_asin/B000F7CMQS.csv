2553820,5,B000F7CMQS,"Finally....ER Season 5 is here.  I have been checking here like every week waiting on this season to come out.  I have never watched ER until my recent deployment to Iraq.  I went through the first 4 seasons in like 2.5 months.  And I know if those were really good, then season 5 is going to even better.",1144713600,10,305,4.206896551724138
2553821,5,B000F7CMQS,"It's finally here! The complete fifth season of ER is coming to dvd! Season five is one of the most intense seasons of ER period! Kellie Martin joins the cast as Carter's med student, Lucy Knight. Also, Doug Ross (Georege Clooney) leaves the show in a riveting two parter. Jeanie's condition worsens, Benton realizes his son is deaf, and at the end of the season, Hathaway finds out she is carrying twins. That is just the tip of the iceberg of what happens in ER: SEASON 5
This is a must for any fan. Also, I would like to correct a careless mistake made by amazon.com

The cast members they have listed at the top of the page are not in this season, most of them didn't even come in until the ninth or tenth season. The entire fifth season cast is:

Anthony Edwards
George Clooney
Noah Wyle
Julianna Margulies
Gloria Rueben
Laura Innes
Alex Kingston
Kellie Martin
and
Eriq La Salle

As for the cast members listed at the top of the page, here are the seasons they came in:

Goran Visnjic: season 6
Maura Tierney: season 6
Mekhi Phifer: season 9, recurring previously in season 8
Parminder Nagra: season 10
Linda Cardellini: season 10

There have been many other cast members on the show since season five, but these are the ones mistakenly listed by amazon as being on the fifth season. This season won at least one emmy, if not more, and earned even more nominations including one for Noah Wyle. Patient story lines include an a man who has strapped a bomb to himself, a girl who needs a transfusion of a rare blood type, a man dressed as an elf who has a heart arrythmia, a school bus accident, a shot stripper and a DUI victim. This set also includes the emmy winning two parter The Storm, which is the departure of George Clooney's charachter.
It was watched by over 40 million people when it first aired.
This is one of ER's best seasons, although I have to say they are all great, except for the eleventh season. Oh well, at least it got back to being good again for the twelth season.
Keep em coming Warner Brothers!",1143676800,36,2025,4.418230563002681

2553928,5,B000F7CMQS,I am really enjoying re-watching all the ER seasons. Season 5 is one of my favorites. On to Season 6,1389398400,,100,4.05
2553929,5,B000F7CMQS,"ER was one of my faivert  tv programs growing up , so it is cool that I am able to witch it on the kindle and not have to worie about the cumershalles !",1388275200,,152,3.4705882352941178
2553930,5,B000F7CMQS,"We get a taste, in this season, of how durable the ER show premise is, and how it can survive the loss of major roles. George Clooney bows out of the show in the middle of this season. This is a highly realistic eventuality, since his character, Dr. Ross, has been on thin ice since season one.

 Meanwhile, Paul McCrane as Dr. Robert Romano takes a bigger role, and the more plots circle around the relations between Romano, Benton, and Elizabeth Cordray (Alex Kingston).

John Carter (and all other interns, residents, and attendings)  continues to advance, as the timeline of the show (unlike the long running M*A*S*H, which outlasted the Korean war four times over.) matches real time. It's hard to cite what is good about this season, compared to others, without giving away some plot points. But it seems fair to say that Carter, after going through a rocky two years as Benton's intern / slave, he does not seem to have learned anything on how to give good guidance to an intern himself.

I miss Mariska Hargitay's playing the love interest for Dr. Greene. I also miss William H. Macy (although his leaving creates room for Dr. Romano's antics.) I miss CCH Pounder as an experienced surgeon. This is only partly made up by softening the role of John Aylward as Dr. Donald Anspaugh. The role of the abrasive character is quite adequately taken over by Dr. Romano (TV Guide has him on the list of most loathed characters on a TV show.) But, Jorja Fox is here, playing about the same character she be on ""The West Wing"" and which she would take up on CSI.

This is the fifth season of ER I have reviewed, and I have not once mentioned the phenomenal job done by the director and camera crews on a minute by minute basis in the Emergency ward itself. After watching ER for a few seasons, many other TV shows and movies seem to crawl along like a snail. This must be why Shakespearean actors speak so fast. There is so little business and visual effects that a good pace needs to be maintained by speaking lines. The choreography of motions by background extras must be a major job in itself.

In the same vein, the set they use must be huge. It seems to at least rival ""The West Wing"" for size. There is a virtually seamless connection between the indoor set and the outdoor Ambulance bay, which for all the world like a piece of Chicago, but its an outdoor set on the Warner Brothers lot.

I see practically no ""wilting"" or repetition of old story lines (although there is some reworking of stories from other shows, such as M*A*S*H.) I signed up for another season after seeing this one.",1385337600,,2592,4.511727078891258

2553976,5,B000F7CMQS,"ER is still the best medical show that was ever on television. The entire 16 seasons are just hands down brilliant. The character development, plot development, etc. are written in a way that is movie worthy. The acting is very strong, in fact it's remarkable how many well known and admired performers from today were at one time or another on ER! (and I'm not just talking about George Clooney, Julianna Margulies, William Macy, etc etc.) Your favorite actors of all time pop up as guest performers each episode. As you watch ER, you come to care deeply about these people, all of whom are written as fully dimensional people -- not like most television which is full of predictable stereotypes.  And the medical scenarios are fully credible. But don't start with this season, start with season one.  There truly isn't one single episode that isn't well written, and well executed. It's as if the writers and producers didn't know how to create a bad or mediocre episode.",1286064000,,973,4.785714285714286

2554011,5,B000F7CMQS,"Season five was a season of comings and goings in the venerable Thursday night NBC drama. Despite the second major cast member checking out in two years, the show continued to be strong and the foundations of one relationship that would continue on for a number of years was set in place at the end of season five.

Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards) and Doug Ross (George Clooney) haven't always agreed on the way they practice medicine or how to deal with authorities, but they are both great doctors and despite their differences, are also pretty good friends. Season five sees Greene trying to walk the fine line of friend and manager as he copes to deal with Ross' basic disregard for authority. The pediatrician finally goes over the line with one terminally sick boy, breaking every protocal, which eventually leads to his departure from the Cook County General emergency department.

Clooney was quickly becoming a big star on the big screen and a burgeoning movie career was pulling him away from his weekly television series, so when the time came to go, he left. This was a pretty big blow to the cast, the second original member to leave in two years (Sherry Stringfield's Dr. Susan Lewis left in season three), but as has been the case, the show continued on with great additions to the cast to take the place of Clooney.

Before he left though, Clooney fought for and got a pediatric ER approved, with himself as the attending. His relationship with nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies) continued to grow stronger, as the two planned their future together. As the season drew to a close, Hathaway discovered she was pregnant with his twins, but when she told him the news, he couldn't return, leaving her to face the pregnancy alone.

Greene got a good dose of being a manager, as he and Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes) managed to work the ER through a number of problems. Greene also dealt with his wife being remarried and his daughter having to live far away. He does get to spend some time with her early in the season. He also treats a hospital janitor (guest star Djimon Hounsou)with a horrible history of abuse and helps him to overcome his fears and confront everything going on in his life. Greene also strikes up a friendship with British surgeon Elizabeth Corday (Alex Kingston) and as the season ends they begin a relationship that would eventually lead to their marriage.

Corday begins her second year in Chicago starting over as an intern. When she turns down Dr. Romano's (guest star and future regular Paul McCrane) advances, he cancels her fellowship and she is forced to start over again. Her relationship with Dr. Peter Benton (Eriq LaSalle) eventually ends and as the year comes to a close, in addition to her relationship with Greene, she is going back to Romano looking for another fellowship to extend her stay in Chicago.

Dr. Weaver begins a search for her birth mother, a search that leads her to someone who isn't her mother thanks to a private investigator. She applies for the job as head of the ER, but is passed over in favor of Dr. Amanda Lee (guest star Mare Winningham), who turns out to actually not be a doctor at all. After the Dr. Lee fiasco, Weaver doesn't put her name back in an the temporary reins are turned over to Dr. Romano, much to the disdain of the entire ER staff.

PA Jeannie Boulet, already positive for HIV, comes down with Hepatitis C and is also involved in a car accident with Ross, which puts her in the hospital for a while. She also is a key part of the pediatric ER with Ross.

Hathaway, as mentioned, continues to grow in her relationship with Ross. She also opens a clinic in the ER, catering to the poor of the area. Her clinic is a great success until she is forced to step down after Ross uses her and the clinic to get the machine that ultimately kills his final patient. The season ends as she begins what will be one of her finest arcs on the show, her pregnancy with twins. The storyline is also one that will eventually introduce viewers to Abby Lockhart (Maura Tierney) who is now a regular on the show.

Benton continues to deal with his son's deafness, going to great lengths to learn all he can. He is hurt when he learns that his son's mother is moving to Germany with her new husband and basically kidnaps his son in the season's final episode. Benton also had a ""highlight"" episode in the season, as he journeyed to Mississippi to fill in at a doctor's office there and had to deal with the racial tensions and also had to find his bedside manner, as he stepped away from being a surgeon for two weeks.

Dr. John Carter (Noah Wyle) had an interesting year. He began the year as an RA in the medical students' dorm, but lost his job when the students threw a party that resulted in an overdose. He eventually moved into Weaver's basement. He also has a relationship with insurance saleswoman Roxanne (guest star Julie Bowen), but breaks that off in the final few episodes of the season. His tryst with his medical student Lucy Knight (the oh-so-adorable Kellie Martin) is a highlight of the season, although it only happened in one episode.

Knight is the new kid on the block in this season, the eager medical student with a good brain, but a lack of actual skills. She and Carter seem to have a love-hate relationship that comes to full tilt when she accidently kicks him in the chest and helps nurse him back to health.

The highlight of this season was the two-part episode ""The Storm,"" possibly the best two-part episode the show has ever done. In the episode, Jeannie and Doug get in a car accident on the way to help at a horrific accident involving a school bus, where Dr. Greene is a hero for saving the kids. Additionally, Carter and Knight have their tryst in one of the hospital's rooms and eventually Ross calls it quits. The two hours were filled with great drama and it is truly a highlight in ER's run.

The only thing lacking on this set is extras. There are a lot of deleted scenes and a great gag reel, but no commentaries or other extras. That is a little disappointing. I enjoy getting whatever access I can to my absolute favorite television show and this set doesn't provide anything substantial to that regard.

Despite that, this was a great season, truly one of the best they did. The cast was able to move past Clooney's departure and pull together in the final few episodes. All in all, a fine effort for one of television's best dramas.",1154649600,40,6451,4.5595854922279795
2554012,4,B000F7CMQS,"It's a good season worth owning.  I assume you already know this if you are reading this.  The DVD set is presented with good sound, picture quality etc.....however....

I was really disappointed to see that Warner Bros. cheaped out on the English subtitles this time around.  Seasons 2-4 were awesome to watch with the subtitles for the hard of hearing, as it really helped with the comprehension of all the medical jargon that was being spewed out at 100 miles an hour.  As a medical professional myself, I got a lot out of this ""special"" feature.  My fiancee, who is NOT a medical professional, found that she was able to get a lot more out of the show by watching the subtitles as well.  It definitely helps a viewer appreciate the complexity of the show's writing.

The show is still great.  However, it is inexplicable why we had to wait 7 months for this DVD set to come out when they obviously didn't put as much work into it as the previous sets (ie. they didn't want to pay someone to transcribe the scripts and sync subtitles).  This is especially irksome considering that season 5 has been available on DVD in the UK for quite a long while now.  I had just assumed Warner Bros. was spending the extra time and cash to do the job right for North America.  I was wrong.",1153612800,22,1279,4.44206008583691
2554013,3,B000F7CMQS,"Season 5 is, in my opinion, one of the worst in the show's history.  Interesting character relationships and exciting medical drama took a distant backseat to slapstick comedy. (Lost bodies, horses crapping on people, doctors getting locked in CT rooms, and more.)  Carter, always a sympathetic character, was suddenly being written as a heartless, brainless jerk, Lucy was a poorly developed and written character, and I,  for one, couldn't care less about Doug's departure. (Mostly because Carol's refusal to go with him, while necessary for practical show-production reasons, was dramatically inexplicible. (""I love you and I want to marry you and have your child ... but I won't move to Seattle with you even though you have no career and no future left in Chicago because I have a job here!"" Like there are no hospitals in Seattle?))

I'm sure most fans will buy it anyway, and as  a completist, I probably will too, but I suspect I won't watch it much.",1152144000,9,958,4.888888888888889

You all say you are so excited that the season is about to be released where those fans in the UK are feeling sorry for you because they are ahead yet again.
