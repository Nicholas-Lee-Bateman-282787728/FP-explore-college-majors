2456450,3,B000CCBCH6,"Comedy Central Presents: Southern Gents of Comedy

Starring Ron White, Otis Lee Crenshaw, Vic Henley, and Steve McGrew.

Vic Henley, well he just sucked. Ron White, who is awesome the first time you see him, retreads old material like the ""Tater Salad"" bar bit and the Sluggo/rich in-laws bit. The only bit he left out is the ""beat the ambulance by a half hour"" plane story, which I'm sure is awaiting a second Comedy Central Presents Ron White.

The only reason I purchased this DVD is for the other two stand-ups, which I had seen before multiple times on CC and Laughed at multiple times on THC. Otis Lee Crenshaw, or Rich Hall of early eighties Saturday Night Live fame, is a singing, piano playing comedian who goes back and forth between interacting with the audience and playing his brand of whiskey-drinking country music, including songs with such topics as being robbed on a date, entitled ""Do Anything You Want to the Girl (Just Don't Hurt Me), an ode to prison rape called ""He Almost Looks Like You"", and a sexy, sexy song about mental illness, ""Bag Lady"".

Steve McGrew has this bit about how the world is divided into two groups, people who drink tequila, and people who can never hear that word again, it's great. His views on bad toilet paper and having pig sex is genius. You'll be glad they put him after Vic Henley to wash the bad taste out of your mouth.",1141603200,3,1374,4.550607287449393

8097140,5,B000CCBCH6,"Purchased this DVD just for Steve McGrew's comedy routine I had heard about.  Never laughed so hard in my entire life!!!  My son thought I was going to choke to death - I was laughing so hard I could barely breath.  I've now watched Steve McGrew's routine over and over again and am still laughing just thinking about it. The rest of the comedy routines are okay but it was well worth the cost of the DVD just for Steve McGrew. Shipping was really fast, too.",1290297600,3,458,4.3023255813953485
