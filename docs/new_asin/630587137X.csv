7898840,4,630587137X,"Most animation fans wouldn't know Gene Deitch, who directed some strange, but interesting animated shorts in the 50's 60's. I remember his bizarre take on Tom and Jerry in the 60's (yes... the famous cat and mouse duo). He did 13 of them and I think if anyone were to remember any it would have to be Dickey Moe which was his take on Moby Dick. Deitch's cartoons are really bizarre and quite trippy to say the least, but they left a very big impression in my brain considering they weren't shown too often on TV and are next to impossible to find on home video.

This is the first collection of his works that I've heard of and decided to take a chance to see what was included on this set. The set includes 12 shorts of which 3 of them are Nudnik shorts(they are extremely short only around 1 minute each). The other nine shorts are ones I hadn't seen since the 60's. The entire disc runs 59 minutes and the menu is a little irritating with only a shorts selection screen that returns to the menu after each short or you can let the entire program run.

Munro is probably the most memorable here and you will notice Howard Morris(Earnest T. Bass from The Andy Griffith Show) lending his voice to some of these rare pieces. It's a fine collection of rare items for the animation collector, but the inclusion of the Tom and Jerry shorts would have made this one a MUST BUY!. The shorts don't look re-mastered, but don't look bad either, they are more than acceptable for my eye.

The price is too steep for my taste, but I did find this through a seller here on Ammie which was more to my liking $7.00 including shipping, which is well worth it for such odd and rare cartoons.",1366675200,,1675,4.328025477707007
