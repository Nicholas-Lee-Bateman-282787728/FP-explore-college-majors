8670605,4,B00M7E78FC,"Had the pleasure of seeing this movie at a presentation with the director and became a big fan. The movie has a dark tone and feel to it which I'm sure is due, in no small part, to it being based on real events. Would definitely recommend to fans of film noir', grind house or crime/drama.",1407456000,5,289,4.178571428571429
