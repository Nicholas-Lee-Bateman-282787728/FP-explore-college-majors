7925748,1,B00004WZ06,I ordered in January and now it's March and all Amazon does is blame their supplyer.  The postponed the delivery date for two weeks but that time has passed and it still hasn't shipped.  Customer service said that it's against their policy to do anyting about it.  I don't know why they keep this product on their site if they can't deliver.  Very poor service.,1142467200,,361,4.507692307692308

7925751,4,B00004WZ06,"I can't believe I'm giving this only 4 stars because the first one is absolutely hilarious and hip. If you don't already know, ""Austin Powers: International man of mystery"" is about a swingin' secret agent/photographer from the 60's who's enemy is an actually childish villain named Dr. Evil. When Dr. Evil freezes himself so he can be revived sometime in the future, Powers does too so he can be ready for him. They are both unfrozen 30 years later in 1997. Austin is soon teamed up with his old sidekick's daugher, Vanessa Kensington who is not at all pleased when he repeatively askes if they can ""shag"". Mike Myers, who plays Austin, does is brilliantly; nobody could do it better. And wouldn't you know it? Myers plays Dr. Evil too! Dr. Evil personally is my favorite. Although he is trying to take over the world, he still loves his hairless (there were errors in the unfreezing process)cat, Mr. Bigglesworth. This movie is hilarious. If you watch Austin sometimes when he's talking, he makes these most outrageous faces that are just part of his character. Oh, and who can forget Dr. Evil's rebellion teenage son that was artificially created in a lab while he was frozen, Scott. (played by Seth Green) Dr. Evil tries to bond with his son... he even takes him to a group talk with other sons and fathers, until he has them liquidated. I'm not going to give away the end to the movie, but it must be pretty obvious that both Powers and Evil don't die because there's a sequel. And that reminds me why I only gave them 4 stars altogther. The sequel, although everyone returns except Elizabeth Hurley (who played Vanessa), it just simply isn't as funny. They took alot of the good jokes from the original and just used them again just in different ways. There is also some bathroom humor, if you can call it humor. That's just plain stupid. For instance, Austin thinks he's drinking some coffee, but he's actually drinking somebody's poop that the lab was testing. That's just sick. I mean, where's the clever jokes from before? An 8 year old could think that up. The sequel is good enough to see though, even good enough to buy (I did). No matter how dumb SOME of the jokes are, you can't help but wait to see Dr. Evil or Scott again. I'll probably see the 3rd, which is coming out soon. I just hope it's more like the first.",1025913600,2,2330,4.55
7925752,4,B00004WZ06,"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery
Austin Powers was England's #1 spy back in the 60's, but he was frozen in '67 because the world's greatest terrorsist froze himself to come back later.  It's now 1997, and they're both back, one to take over the world, and the other to save it.  This movie is a spoof of the James Bond series, and it's a darn good one.  Dr. Evil steals a warhead and a subterranean drill and plans to detonate it at the center of the Earth, and only Austin and his partner Vanessa can save him.
This is a hilarious movie, and Mike Myers in invaluble as an actor who plays both Austin and Dr. Evil.  It's a little dirty, but it's definitly worth a look at, despite all your worries.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me
Austin is back baby!  Dr. Evil has built a ""time machine"" and is taking it back to 1969 to steal Austin's mojo.  Austin follows him back and meets a hot CIA agent named Felicity Shagwell, and they team up to defeat Dr. Evil.
This movie may even be funnier than the first one.  It's got one of the funniest scenes that I've ever seen in my life!  Dr. Evil has a spaceship that resembles male genitals, and when people are describing it, well, you must see it for yourself to fully appreciate it.",1019001600,,1242,4.3004291845493565
7925753,2,B00004WZ06,"The reason why I'm saying this is because Austin Powers III will be on arriving at cinemas in just a few months. Now, ofcourse, APIII will also be released on DVD, and you don't wanna spend your money on this boxed-set when you can get the whole trilogy, do you? Universal did the same thing! They released a boxed-set with Jurassic Park/The Lost World, and eveybody just went ""WOW!"" And then, just a few months later, they released the trilogy!
Don't fall into New Lines trap! Wait for the trilogy!",1011657600,14,499,4.555555555555555
7925754,5,B00004WZ06,"Awesome. That's what best describes what I think of these 2 movies. Not only do you get 2 great movies, but there are many behind the scenes features, deleted scenes, alternate endings, and music videos to keep you laughing for weeks. This has to be the funniest DVD package out there to date. If you loved the movies, then your gonna love this collection. Yeah Baby!",1003795200,2,367,4.575757575757576
