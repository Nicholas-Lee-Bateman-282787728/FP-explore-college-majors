3731445,3,B001OOGCHQ,"I was happy to receive the DVD so quickly and immediately viewed with my husband.  Although this is an old documentary from the 70's, the quality of the film was not what I expected.  I believe there was quite a bit of  editing done. As I recall, there was a scene immediately following the Cuban-African Santeros that segueys into Richie Ray and Bobby Cruz singing ""Ahora Vengo Yo"" at the club (Cheetah, I think).  Also, there is another scene where a ""wino"" is on the streets and he's telling one of the Fania All-Stars recording artist that he's trying to protect his pal from being robbed. Lastly, there is a scene with Hector Lavoe (or Ismael Miranda)entering a Botanica that sells ""cosas de Espiritismo"".  Both Hector and the owner talk about a woman in Puerto Rico who helped the owner with his women problems.  As a Latina who is truly proud of her heritage, culture and country (Puerto Rico) I know this sounds bizarre but I do remember what events occurred in this documentary. Despite my dissapointment, I will cherish this copy of the documentary but will research to see if I can get my hands on the ""original, original"".

What a shame that it was not digitally re-mastered and have all the segments left in tact.",1308096000,9,1226,4.622119815668203
3731446,5,B001OOGCHQ,"For years I had looked for this documentary, and I was amazed to receive a brand new, unopened DVD in the mail after I purchased it on Amazon.",1268697600,,142,4.107142857142857
3731447,5,B001OOGCHQ,"Seen in the 70's in Puerto Rico.  Great documentary about the latinos (especially puertorricans). It brings a lot of memories of costumbres & salsa greats. I have been looking for more than 20 years & I can not find it. Hope they decide to put the movie on the market again. I am completely sure that is going to sell like ""pan caliente"". Ah the 70's ,wished I could stayed living there. There was a lot more of respect & morals. A whole different atmosphere.",1241654400,5,459,4.4
3731448,4,B001OOGCHQ,"I like watching about my roots, this actually looked like a home video,more than a documentry. I still enjoyed it as it is my thing.",1345507200,,132,4.32
3731449,5,B001OOGCHQ,"I have been waiting for Nuestra Cosa Latina (Our Latin Thing) to be released for about ten years, now. I first saw a clip of the late, great salsero Hector Lavoe, singing some soaring and fiery vocals, over the tropical rhythms of Fania All Stars (an incomparable salsa collective), with flautist Johnny Pacheco, back in my Ethnomusicology class, at the University of Washington. Even then, it was obvious that this film was a treasure. It makes you feel like you are in the front of the night club, jiving to some son montuno and dancing some ""break on two"" salsa free style moves. This world, of over forty years ago, no longer exists - even in New York. Yes, salsa is still a fully fledged part of the culture there, and they tried to replicate it on the West Coast (to mixed results), but, this film captures such a beautiful time for music. From the opening scene, showing a small boy making his way down his barrio to be with a group of outdoors musicians, jamming on the steps, to our look inside the night club and of the band recording coros, to the cock fight, to the scene from a local bodega (corner store), we feel the sights, sounds and rich culture of the Nuyoriquen, Caribbean and Latin American experience in New York. When I saw one of the young women, depicted in a street scene, asking for tamarindo syrup on ice, my mouth began to water. Speaking as a first generation Venezuelan-American, just showing scenes of sofrito served over rice, little details like tamarindo syrup and great dialogue (all in Spanish without sub-titles), this is truly an authentic experience you just cannot replicate. The authenticity of this film is felt from the first clip, to the closing dance sequence. One of the subjects interviewed is quoted as saying that Fania All Stars wanted to spread their salsa worldwide. I think that they definitely succeeded, believing behind this limited edition footage for new generations, forty years later. Brilliant.",1339200000,2,1956,4.772861356932153
3731450,4,B001OOGCHQ,"THis video is awesome! It take you back to the old times were music, salsa, was everything. Nice to see la fania stars when they were young.",1332288000,,140,4.222222222222222
3731451,5,B001OOGCHQ,If you grew up in or around NYC in the 70's-80's this was permeating culture and this dvd is a time machine to NYC before Disney.  Hot music and incredible artists make this a must have for any fan of Salsa and Afro-Cuban music.  The magnitude of talent that combined forces is unrivaled.  Pick this one up.,1329523200,,307,4.350877192982456
3731452,5,B001OOGCHQ,This is a great dvd about Fania's history and salsa music. I used to listen to all those songs when I was younger.  I recommend this video to anyone that loves old salsa like I do.,1326758400,,180,4.0
3731453,3,B001OOGCHQ,"Well let's see, where do I start; the movie is poorly transfered on to DVD, the colors seem like you need 3D glasses to get any type of focus going on.  Also, the sound seems as if it's comming out of a tin can.  Having said that there is some classic Salsa stuff on here, like Larry Harlow wearing a Kosher shirt in the Bronx, just kidding a few of the pioneers belt it out and that makes this thing worth whatever it is I paid for it.  If this is remastered than I'd hate to see the none remastered version.",1326240000,2,509,4.01980198019802
