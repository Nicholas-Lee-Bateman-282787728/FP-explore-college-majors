2646702,5,B000HWZ4I4,"Yes, I know it is a hackneyed old cliche but in this case, entirely correct. I first saw this movie in the Cinema in London's Kilburn during it's first run in the late Sixties. About halfway through it some people got up and left, feeling that it was abusive to the memory of those who gave their lives in that War to end all Wars. How wrong they were. The Movie is a masterpiece in every respect. The sheer stupidity, the waste of that generation are both self evident on screen. Note the beautiful Maggie Smith when viewed from a distance in the Theatre, note again how thick the make up when we are on stage with her ""Taking the shilling"". The other face of war. The final scene on the glorious South Downs as the camera pulls back to reveal the hillside is breathtaking and at once heartbreaking. In all the times I have seen this movie, I have yet to watch the whole of this scene without a flood of tears filling my eyes. Do I remember which lovely young girl I took to see it in 1969? Sadly no. Have I ever forgotten the movie? No.",1159315200,40,1038,4.221105527638191
2646703,5,B000HWZ4I4,"At the Battle of Loos, in 1915, thousands of Britain's finest fell to German machine guns.  German losses were zero.

This film gives us an insight on why, when, and how, it all happened. There are other films in the same category, but only a few.  All Quiet on the Western Front; Black and White in Color (French/African, 1969), Joyeux Noel. The songs resonate, even today-- ""There's a silver lining, 'neath this dark cloud shining ... turn the darkness inside out, 'til the boys come home.""

No blood or gore in this war film, but it leaves you with a lifetime of unforgettable impressions about the carnage of war. In one scene, British soldiers dig a trench.  In the next scene, battle.  Next, British soldiers fill in the trench.  There are red poppies displayed.  A mass grave.

Walking in fields of red poppies. Singing ""We're here-- because we're here-- because we're here because ... "" John Mills as the British Field Marshall war criminal General Haig, walking thoughtfully in those graveyards.  What was he thinking?

Edit, National Memorial Day 2013:  ""When this lousy war is over ... ""  I need to set up a home theater here in my new house, and invite friends over, and play this film, and King of Hearts, every Memorial Day from now on.",1159228800,4,1250,4.65296803652968
2646704,5,B000HWZ4I4,"I had heard of this film a few times before (most notably, in my movie encyclopedia) but when I saw the cover art to this film and hearing that it will be released on DVD in November (not to mention the public for the first time since it wasn't released on VHS) on the website The Digital Bits, my jaw almost dropped. Then I heard that the movie was on TV last weekend on HBO Comedy, so I check it out for a few minutes. How bizarre! The first movie that came to mind of this was ""How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying"" another musical that focused on social issues. What is amazing is that the movie has Lawrence Olivier, Vanessa Redgrave (along with her father and brother!), John Gigleud, and Maggie Smith. Amazing because they have been considered as the four greatest performers to ever come out of Great Britain. I must admit we may be inside the best year for DVD releases (up until mid-2007). Haven't you noticed some of the new movies on disc are from the 60's and early-70's? I mean, you got PETULIA on DVD, PRETTY POSION just came out, DEADFALL and THE MAGUS (the two movies with Michael Caine from 1968) coming out soon, as well as HARPER (maybe Paul Newman's most important role), REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE, WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? being re-released, OPERATION CROSSBOW, THE ILLUSTRATED MAN, THE ARRANGEMENT and THERE WAS A CROOKED MAN (another two pack with Kirk Douglas). Let's not forget this movie. I think this could be a sign that pop culture in the 60's is finally starting to come full circle and that people today can now appreciate what the movies accomplished from Kennedy's murder in Dallas to Nixon stepping down (or as I like to call it: 'The REAL Greatest Generation' and who would of believed in their election face-off in 1960 they would become the bookends for that era). In conclusion, I would like to say bravo to Paramount for putting ""Oh! What a Lovely War"" for DVD release. Now let's see if they can release their other late-60's films like ""If..."" and ""Downhill Racer"" and re-release say, ""The President's Analyst"" in Special Editions.",1157760000,5,2093,4.613941018766756
2646705,5,B000HWZ4I4,"OH WHAT A LOVELY WAR is the ultimate anti-war film.  Is it a coincidence that this DVD release of a 70s classic comes when we are mired in another lengthy and senseless conflict?  Through pastiche and music this film portrays the appalling losses and futility of World War I - the war that started in the hot summer of 1914 and was supposed to be ""all over by Christmas"" but dragged on for almost five long years - and just about every major British actor of the day appears in it - Olivier is mentioned in the credits, but look for Maggie Smith, Ralph Richardson, John Mills, Jack Hawkins and many others, plus Jean Pierre Cassel.  Through popular songs of the day and vignettes of historical events in France, Russia and Britain the story of the approach and arrival of war and its effects are portrayed with a ""musical hall"" (vaudeville) ambiance, to devastating AND grippingly entertaining effect.  The dialogue includes numerous historically accurate quotations from the personalities involved, politicians and members of the doomed royal houses of Europe, and ordinary people caught up in the ""War to end all wars"".  The film which was based on a successful long running theatre production that played in London in the late sixties had a very brief release in the USA and then vanished.  I treasure the (inferior quality) bootleg video copy I managed to get, but am very anxious to see the DVD and relive the experience.  Highly recommended.",1157500800,15,1447,4.810483870967742
2646706,5,B000HWZ4I4,"I first saw this film on the big screen in London when it was first released.  I have been waiting for this film to appear on any video format for years.  I can only hope that this is not the edited version.  Shown on television only rarely and severely edited the film loses its sarcastic wit and anti-war feelings.

The very idea of setting a musical retelling of the WWI, from the English point of view, on Brighton Pier's Fun Fair is audacious to say the least.  ""England Put the Kibasch on the Kaiser"" truly begins the fun and shock.  Maggie Smith's appearance as a Music Hall star is wonderful as she exhorts the troops to sign up.  All of the songs, excepting the title one are from the era and provide enough feeling to swamp your feelings.  Hooray!  I shall use it in class Winter Quarter.  It will be a revelation to those who have not seen it!",1157500800,35,854,4.314465408805032

2646738,5,B000HWZ4I4,"This film was held up for release on DVD for many years, most probably due to problems with Ms. Littlewood's desires. Once she had died, her estate quickly approved the release, and this DVD was the result.
I first saw this film at Fort Polk LA, about a week before departing for the war in RVN in 1969. Originally, I decided to view it as a way to pass the time during my last weekend of leisure. However, I was blown away by the improvements that the film made over the musical review (for which I had played clarinet, bass clarinet and saxophone in the pit orchestra when the review made its way through the United States).
The music was as good, but the settings in the movie were a 100% improvement over the review, which used the device of a pierot show in place of ""reality"".
Gorgeous cinematography, excellent screenplay, and properly stiff renditions by the ""historical players"" (government folks, Haig, prime ministers, emperors and foreign ministers, upper crust Britons) and loose ones by the people actually involved in the fighting (the Smith family and the soldiers who actually did the fighting and dying).
The narrator is excellent in his multiple roles, the poppy metaphor does a great job of symbolizing the death that was all around. The use of ""Over There"" to depict the Americans pushing their way into the war was wonderful. The soaring tenor solo over the choir in ""What A Friend We Have In Jesus/When This Lousy War Is Over"" is not to be missed, particularly the way the scene is filmed as the camera's shot slowly works it way to the stolid Irishman at the very end. And, the music hall sequence near the beginning was a great interface between the perceived war (on the home front) and the real war.
(Jane Seymor is in the film, but uncredited - this was her first screen appearance, as a chorus girl during the music hall sequence.)
I owned a copy of a television transmission of the movie for many years. Poor quality, it still allowed me to enjoy the film over and over. The release of the new rendition was greeted with joy around these parts. I bought a total of six copies, distributing four of them to friends who appreciated them just as much as I did. The commentary sections are also enlightening. It's hard to believe that the beauty of the amusement pier was as short lived as it was.
Since the new release, I've had the opportunity to view the review again. While I enjoyed playing in the pit for the review back in the day (particularly the long, exposed baritone sax solo in the musical review sequence), the movie does a far better job of getting the point across.
It is decidedly anti-war. However, if you have ever served in a shooting war, you will get the point of view of the film. Those who view it from ""outside"" of the sphere of a war may see it as disrespectful. It is anything but - it respects the dead, and mocks those who sent them off to die.
Oh, and watch for the extremely brief appearance of Lenin in the film, portrayed by an uncredited actor as the part is not a speaking one. If you blink (literally), you will miss it.",1419638400,,3082,4.49554367201426

2646745,2,B000HWZ4I4,"This movie attempts to portray the foolish pointlessness of war. However, it only seems to portray the pointless foolishness of this film. To be sure, the production values of this movie are excellent but the surrealistic portrayal of the Great War as an amusement park (one called ""World War One"" no less) and its incessant use of music hall songs of the period makes it impossible to feel sympathy for ANY character in this film.

2646760,5,B000HWZ4I4,"I loved this film when it first came out - I was a teenager then, but had a keen interest in history, and my fascination with the Great War has never left me.  I thought it was a brilliant concept, and while some moments were funny, there were others that were heart-breaking.
Watching it again after many years, I realized that someone who did not know much about that war would miss a lot of the points made.  For example, one of the family members at the beginning is a young lad in a sailor suit - we meet him four years later in uniform going to his death - conscription was not brought in for some time, but at the beginning of 1918 boys of 17 were called up - so your 13-year-old child in 1914 would probably die in battle in 1918.  Because there was no conscription at the beginning, men were shamed or seduced into signing up by music-hall acts - Maggie Smith's song represented what was going on all over the country - boys being turned into men, but not in the way that was promised.  You don't have to know a lot about the Great War, but it helps to make this film a richer experience.
The film points to the stupidity of war, the pointless slaughter, the absurdity and heartbreak of it all.  But it is entertaining, from the poignancy of Corin Redgrave's ""Goodbyee"" song, to the soldiers' Sunday service in the church ruins, to John Mills' Haig praying for a victory before the Americans arrive.

2646764,1,B000HWZ4I4,"Having just seen OH, WHAT A LOVELY WAR, I realize now that the director who so arrogantly decided to mangle A CHORUS LINE had already had experience in turning a unique theatrical success into a turgid overblown film. Richard Attenborough can be added to a select list of talented film directors (including John Huston and Francis Ford Coppola) who should never have been entrusted with the filming of successful musicals. [Who could have guessed that Josh Logan would prove equally inept?] On the other hand, if you enjoyed the film versions of FINIAN'S RAINBOW, PAINT YOUR WAGON or CAMELOT, you might like this one.

2646765,5,B000HWZ4I4,"I, too, saw this fantastic film back in 1969 and have been waiting decades to get it on video or DVD. It was the first film I saw after getting back from Vietnam - and I saw it at the base theater at Fort Lewis, Washington. Much of the audience didn't know what to make of it, but I thought that surely it would be a hit. What a sleeper it turned out to be. I hope new audiences can appreciate it, finally.

Most of my favorite British actors were in the film. The familiar classic songs with satirical lyrics were very clever, as were the settings and dialog. It was such a perfectly crafted and directed anti-war, and anti-upperclass, movie.

After viewing the DVD a few times since I purchased it, I re-watched it again, listening to Richard Attenborough's commentary. It made me appreciate the film all the more. The aging director's slow-paced comments were nonetheless very revealing, informative, and possibly the best commentary track I have yet heard on a DVD. So often director comments are about everything except what is actually on the screen. Attenborough stuck to the film, its actors, the original play's adaptation to film, and other fascinating trivia. There is also a bonus documentary with interviews of others involved with the production as well as Attenborough. I hope it eventually gets to Blu-ray, but for now, this DVD looks great!

By the way, there was a stereo LP record of the soundtrack which I still have and have transferred to CD, but the audio on the DVD is mono only. The IMDB states the original audio was mono, which I find hard to believe since all major CinemaScope/Panavision films of the day, especially big-budget ones, were produced in stereo. Anyhow it still sounds great, even in mono.",1326585600,6,1731,4.706270627062707

The idea is simple: take the Great War, contrast the grim reality of trench warfare with the merry songs it produced, then use the irony to comment on the current Vietnam War (1969). Simple piece that can be done in a theater workshop.  Well, somehow the word got around, the stars started signing, the pounds started flowing and the project started veering much to the disgrace of the effect intended. In the end one feels as exhausted as the combatants themselves, tired of the gore, the silly tunes and the interminable boredom in-between.

Regarding the cast, most of the Big Names appear in the first scene, playing the European monarchs about to unleash Armaggedon, so watch closely for Ian Holm as President Poincar, Kenneth More as Kaiser Wilhelm, and Jack Hawkings as Emperor Franz Josef. Edward Fox, the late & lovely Susannah York, Dirk Bogarde, John Gielgud Michael Redgrave,, Vanessa Redgrave, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Jane Seymour, Ralph Richardson, Juliet Mills, John Mills (Haig) and Laurence Olivier (French) pop in to say Hi; yes, it's me!. My favorite? Maggie Smith, doing a rowdy vaudeville number in order to recruit young dupes.

Richard Attenborough, then a young actor, directs. It was his first, and he took a liking for epics, for he subsequently made YOUNG WINSTON, A BRIDGE TOO FAR, GANDHI, IN LOVE AND WAR and a few other mammoth productions!

2646796,4,B000HWZ4I4,"Oh! What a Lovely War
Review and Song List
I'm usually not a fan of musicals, or of the surrealistic pop-culture of the late 1960s as it was applied to the portrayal of historic events.  I am an avid World War I buff/historian, as well as a fan of Richard Attenborough, and I had waited, somewhat skeptically, to see his directorial debut, Oh! What a Lovely War.  When the DVD was released I ordered it from Amazon, prepared to dislike it intensely, but I was relieved and surprised to find that I found it quite good.  It is definitely a product of its time.  Some of the imagery, such as the convention of presenting the War as a Brighton Beach holiday pavilion, might be a little hard for some viewers to swallow.  The then-current view of all British senior officers as craven, insensitive morons living in luxury far from danger has been energetically and rather effectively challenged in the last few years by such authors as John Terraine, The Smoke and the Fire, and Frank Davies and Graham Maddocks, Bloody Red Tabs, but Oh! What a Lovely War provides a graphic presentation of what remains the majority viewpoint on a still-controversial aspect of the War.

Historically the movie is sound.  As long as a viewer keeps the movie's ideological perspective in mind, it's actually a very serviceable thumbnail lesson on World War I from the British viewpoint.  The first 20 minutes or so lay out the background, causes, and descent to global war in a bizarre but engaging manner, but also as succinctly and as well as I've seen it done.  The military uniforms and equipment have the right look, for the most part; some World War II gear sneaks in from time to time, but not enough to detract seriously from the realism of the battle scenes.

Mostly, for me, this is a tremendous collection of the wonderful music of World War I.  The songs are used in an extremely effective way to portray the growing horror of the War and the resignation and anguish of the British people as it progressed.  The transitions between the fanciful World War I Pavilion and the actual portrayal of the developing trench combat are sometimes jarring and disturbing but almost always effective.  The symbolism, notably the appearance of red poppies as precursors to characters' deaths, is not remotely subtle, but it is heart-felt and sincere.  There are a few genuine lump-in-the-throat moments - for me, ""We Don't Want to Lose You"", ""Hanging on the Old Barbed Wire"", ""Keep the Home Fires Burning"", and the ghostly reunion of the Smith brothers at the end qualify.  I made out a song list tied to the DVD's chapter titles that might be helpful in finding favorites:

2646817,5,B000HWZ4I4,"OH! WHAT A LOVELY WAR was a unique stage musical and Richard Attenborough's film version is also unique and one of the finest examples of a stage-to-screen interpretation.  Joan Littlewood's stage show had a mimimal cast, basic set and used projections.  The film has a huge all-star cast (along the lines of Mike Todd's AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS), with many of the them singing and dancing.  This satirical approach to the bloodiest of all wars uses the Brighton fun pier intercut with real locations to bring home the devastation that sacrificed a generation of young men - the impact of this is brought home with an amazing final sequence that must rank as one of the most extraordinary visual shots ever captured on film.  This DVD transfer is also excellent and complete (some TV versions and theatrical prints had cuts).  The transfer is crisp and clean and the original stereo track is fine.  An hour or so of recent interviews with Attenborough and some of the cast provides insight into the enormous exercise behind the scenes.  Attenborough also contributes a wonderful audio-commentary despite his age.  To sum up, a must-have for musical (film & theatre) buffs - can also provide an excellent introduction to history students to this 'war to end all wars'.  Without a single drop of blood on view, this film brings home the harsh reality that nobody wins a war!",1221350400,3,1375,4.817021276595745

More recently it has been playing out in London.
It is an anti-war film and it could be superimposed over Irag and the Bush Administration.
It shows how the instigators are well away from the action and destruction
And how it is fought out by die for your country concepts.
The music is sincerely constructed from the minds of the trench soldier with a great deal of resigned vunerability and you must follow the leaders in command or you will be an outcaste.
The striking thing about the songs and lyrics are that they are light and bubbly when trenches are so very bad and cruel to these brave men.

We jump from theatrical sets to naturalistic locations, often with clever transitions or editing. Each individual scene is wonderfully mounted. Highlights include the highly stylized opening sequence depicting the origins of WW1, and the beautifully subtle Christmas Truce scene. The key dialoge is taken from historical accounts, and all the musical numbers are actual WW1 songs (""Belgium Put the Kybosh on the Kaiser"", and ""Goodbye, Goodbye"" being standouts). However beautifull this patchwork quilt of a piece may be, it doesn't hang together well. Pacing is sometimes a problem (minutes devoted to buying cotton candy on a boardwalk adds nothing to it's scene).

Mostly, in my opinion, the movie was an introduction to songs sung by the sad and sarcastic enlisted troops in Europe. Only the british though. Not sure what the germans sang. It was compelling in that it showed clearly, the insanity and carelessness of the generals who stayed in Britain, and continued with dances and balls even during wartime. I wonder if that is true. Tragic if so.

The morality of the enlisted in Europe was clear, when during the singing of Silent Night, troops from both sides came out and the germans outright said they will not shoot anymore. But when the info of the meeting of the men, the british officers threatened to charge treason for fraternizing with the enemy. again, tragic if it happened.

I wasn't happy at the end, because, well, there was no closure.

2646848,5,B000HWZ4I4,"I was given this DVD as a Christmas gift, and am forever grateful. It has been the Holy Grail of movies for me since I remember it as a work of genius from the time it was first released. The other reviews below well attest to the critical elements of the film, and you should read them, but I had a much more personal reason to seek out this film.  This film was released in September, 1969 in New York City; I was drafted (inducted) the following day for the Viet-Nam War.  I went to New York that night, and watched this film as many times as I could, trying to commit it to memory.  I have not had a chance to see it since other than a fleeting glimpse on PBS in the early 1980's.  It is just as good now as the day I first saw it in 1969.

This film is an extraordinarily good adaptation of a cabaret show put together by Joan Littlefield in the early 1960's.  It gained underground popularity as an anti-war vehicle during the Viet-Nam War, finally emerging in the Attenborough movie.  While it has overtones of that era, perhaps, Attenborough has been exceedingly careful to maintain the character of the period of World War I, and that care translates to a film that transcends its period.

The strength of the cabaret show and the film is that, in paying homage to the carnage of WWI in the songs of the soldiers and the words of the real people of the period, they have captured the folly and destructiveness of all wars.  By following the historical sequence of the songs and the words, they show the inexorable destruction of of the civilised life of the 19th century, and the pain of that destruction for the people involved.

I suggest that everybody forget about the expressions of political opinion in some of the earlier posts.  This is a beautiful and moving film, which explores the events that lead to the deaths of a generation of young British men between 1914 and 1918 and the means by which those at home dealt with the human tragedy.  That should be enough, it seems to me.  It's not to be missed, even by those who believe that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were necessary evils.",1168041600,8,660,4.377049180327869

I eventually captured it on my DVR on one of it's rare cable appearances ... and burned myself a copy of it. So of course, NOW it's actually released. Figures. I love this movie. It presents the horrors of war in general and the horrors of WWI in particular ... the incredible carnage, the ineptitude of the leadership ... the devastation ... AND you can sing along. I always wanted to run a double header of this and ""King of Hearts"" ... another film about the absurdity of war. DO see this movie. It will stick in your mind.

2646853,4,B000HWZ4I4,"The only reason this DVD version doesn't get 5 stars is because Paramount was pretty sloppy with its sequencing (e.g., putting ""1917"" before ""1916""). But the message is the same - and as haunting - regardless. Buy a few copies and spread them around.  Send them to draft-aged kids and those thinking of joining up.

Although a musical, the dates, statistics and conversations are factual.  Only recently, for example, have there been serious books discussing the Xmas Truce of 1914, a highlight of this 1969 film.  The contrasts between the light-hearted musical format and the horrors of WW I only heightens the viewer's awareness.

My adult children were set to roll their eyes as their anti-war father had them watch it.  I grew weary of picking their jaws up, however.  At first they were tempted to accuse the film of plopping lines from the Iraq/Afghanistan Wars into the script.  Examples:

""They didn't really attack, we're just going to say so and erase it later...""[diplomats]

""We are just defending ourselves!"" [politicians, when they were doing just the opposite].

""She's lost three.  No, four!  No, three.  They're bringing them home at night now, you know..."" [women on the pier discussing the casualty lists].

Antiwar suffragette is run off by an itiotic crowd spouting non-sequetors and mindless un-related insults.  ""The papers are lying to you,"" she pleads, unsuccessfully. Was that woman talking about 1916 or 2002 articles by the NYT's Judith Miller?

""Thank you for sending me a copy of the [London] Times; I see that all this suffering was a great 'victory.'"" --Nurse attending wounded after the Somme.

Add to this the scenes of the Army Ball, politics, and the media all the while in contrast with the filth of the trenches.  Can't you just see Franklin Graham, Jerry Falwell or James Dobson giving the priest's blessing?

My kids figured out soon enough that the poppy (rarely seen these days on Nov 11) was the symbol of death.  The ending, though, left them speechless, as it does me, after all these years.

Cementing the shock were the haunting songs that expressed the fatalistic and antiwar views of the average soldier.  The resemblance among the politicians of WW I, the Bush Administration, its general staff and its media is beyond such simple words as ""frightening"" or ""terrifying.""

Kudos to Paramount for the release!  I can't think of a better time for the US to start singing ""When this lousy war is over.""",1164067200,17,2449,4.929095354523227
2646854,5,B000HWZ4I4,"""Oh! What a Lovely War"" takes on nothing less than the immense task of encapsulating the entirety of World War One into two and a half hours. This is a story of courage and sacrifice beyond comprehension, and of stupidity and heartlessness on a truly monumental scale.  But the courage and sacrifice are not, as in the usual telling of tales, that of a handful of heroes, but of an entire generation.  And the stupidity and heartlessness belong to the military and world leaders of the day.  As monarchs, generals, and politicians wallow in luxury and privilege, the ordinary soldier wallows in mud - and brutal death.  This is a story that will make you gasp and cry `never again.'  And you know your cry is in vain.

A notice after the opening screen credits states something that must be kept in mind throughout the film: ""The principal statements made by the historical characters in this film are based on documentary evidence, and the words of the songs are those sung by the troops during the First World War.""  Therefore, to underscore the absurdity of an international effort that did its utmost to murder an entire generation, much of the dialogue of the historical characters, comfortably ensconced away from the fighting, sounds absurd.  Is it really possible, for example, that General Haig, after considering the huge loss of life on both sides, could have said something like ""in the end, the Germans will have five thousand men and we will have ten thousand, so we will have won""?.  Apparently so.

The men in the trenches, on the other hand, had the unenviable choice of facing probable death or mutilation on the battlefield, or facing the firing squad for cowardice if they deserted.  They express themselves in the memorable songs of the day, many of which are rich in gallows humor (""hanging on the old barbed wire"" is one cheerful refrain).  But despite its gruesome themes, there is not one drop of blood in the film: when death comes, it arrives in the form of a bright red poppy.

Those who cannot relate to epochal events except through the eyes of a circumscribed set of characters may have trouble with this film.  And some may find frivolous a film that depicts human tragedy through upbeat song and dance numbers (all of which are wonderfully staged and performed).  But recall that the words sung are those of the actual participants in the unfolding tragedy.  ""We're here because we're here because we're here"" underscores the troops' view of the meaningless sacrifice.  If their impious words set to beloved hymns seem offensive, perhaps it is because when life is at its bleakest, humor can help save one's sanity.

This film, directed by the great Richard Attenborough, is a work of genius; it delivers a message that is all-too-relevant for our times.",1163894400,48,2787,4.8071278825995805

8141987,2,B000HWZ4I4,"This film (that started as a radio play) takes a bought as long as the war and mangles the history and substitutes words (one respirator for the four of us) for standard songs. For a little while one can put up with metaphors and Monty Python skits. However after a while it gets quite boring. You have to know history to keep up with the skits; if you know history then this is a waste of time emulating it.

Very ingenious settings in a pavilion (Brighton) by the sea set up the prolog to describe the positions before the war. The scattered reference to red poppies are quite fascination but not worth plugging through the film. There is a brief but good emulation of the Christmas meeting in no-man's land.

In the tradition of ""The Longest Day"" we get to see cameos of many famous actors of the day. It is quite fun to guess where we saw them before. Some of the song and dance is reminiscent of the quality that went into ""Springtime for Hitler.""

There is no way into this collection of vignettes, no thread that binds the whole together. In some early scene a Master of Ceremonies appears, but then that character is dropped and the viewer is left at sea.  Perhaps people in England understood this film better, but I am well-versed in the Great War's history, and I found myself drifting off as what was clearly a theatre piece chugged by.  The idea of irony here is at the top, interposed songs of era with scenes of death and slaughter that don't go nearly as far as they should.  But nothing develops. The last scene is particularly off-putting, coming, at least to me, out of nowhere.  I haven't seen this film in years, and when I rented it to watch, I remembered why.

The story of WW I, through British eyes, told mainly as a kind of dance hall vaudeville, intercut with far more realistic scenes of war, and laden with musical numbers that pre-figure Dennis Potter's astounding use of music of a period to comment on the action and themes in bitterly ironic ways.

At times, this works amazingly well (a powerful scene of Maggie Smiths music hall chanteuse calling boys up on stage to head off to their death) but at other times the ironies are too leaden, or go on too long.  Indeed, for me the film as a whole is overlong --  at 2 and a half hours, it feels like it could have lost 30 minutes and been a lot sharper and more powerful.
