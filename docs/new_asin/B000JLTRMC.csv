2676350,5,B000JLTRMC,"This show kicks butt, After watching Walker for so many years I tend to wonder if Walker can ever be stopped. My favorite episode is when Walker get's bitten by a deadly Scorpion and is left for dead but he closes his eyes and summons the great spirit and wakes up like nothing happend",1195257600,,285,4.296296296296297
2676351,5,B000JLTRMC,"Walker is amazing!  The 2nd Season is full of action, great plot- and of course, ""Eyes of a Ranger"" is introduced!  If you like action or drama, you should love Walker!",1179100800,,168,4.387096774193548
2676352,5,B000JLTRMC,With new theme song in place Walker roared back for what was really his Third season. This is still one of the better shows about Rangers ever made. The values that are packed into every show make this a must see in my house. keep them coming!!!!!!!!!!!,1177113600,,253,4.404255319148936
2676353,4,B000JLTRMC,"This season was good. Chuck Norris has as usual that serious stoneface. I think that is good and a little funny.

You can as usually expect 3-4 martial arts fights in each episode. Too bad Chuck is doubled for kicks in nearly all the fights. I saw he did some stunts himself also in some episodes, that is good in my opinion.

Of course there is some humor in this season also that is funny.
A good season, a good purchase!",1173830400,2,423,4.209876543209877
2676354,5,B000JLTRMC,"These shows are compelling viewing, you cant turn away from them in case you miss something. They are a great tribute to a great man.....and promote public awareness about a lot of issues and alternate lifestyles than those of our own. Wonderful, just wish they would release the other series quicker, we have been waiting a long time for them.",1173312000,3,344,4.75
2676355,5,B000JLTRMC,"There's only one way a person can watch Walker: inebriated.  That's right.  I said it.  Watching the series, I've noticed how hoakie and cheesy most of EVERYTHING (acting, directing, etc) is.  And to truely appreciate this work of art, one has to be blitzed out of the mind.  But that's why I like it so.  Walker is not intentionally funny, which makes it hilarious; more so than some comedies out today!  So come on.  Buy a friend, drink a Walker and watch a beer!",1170720000,7,465,4.4523809523809526

2676399,4,B000JLTRMC,Husband loves these older tv shows. They are okay. I don't care for my young kids to watch it bc they use cuss words such as damn and hell. My 9 yr old started using those words for a while when she got mad. I had to explain to her what they meant. Good values added in though.,1500768000,,277,3.793103448275862

2676508,5,B000JLTRMC,"The kicks keep coming. What's different about Season Two is that Walker is now working cooperatively with other law enforcement agencies. He's not the Lone Ranger like he used to be so much during  the First Season.

Walker doesn't seem as invincible as before. He actually gets hurt more both physically and emotionally. You see him vulnerable despite the super tough exterior he holds tighly to.

Something else I truly enjoy are all the tributes given to Native Americans. From episodes about scavengers desecrating ancient burial sites for profit. To how unscrupulous businessmen use lies & trickery to try to take advantage of the Natives living on reservations. Headstrong young men and revered elder tribesmen are all portrayed in a positive light.

I'm three quarters of the way through this season and look forward to Season Three.",1420848000,2,840,5.109489051094891

2676608,3,B000JLTRMC,"In this 1993-94 Season of this police drama that ran on CBS from 1993-01 was a somewhat reigned-in Walker (Chuck Norris) is less ""Dirty Harry"" and more by-the-book, providing, of course, that the book has plenty of pictures of criminals being subdued with roundhouse kicks to the head.

In one episode, Walker's partner, Jimmy Trivette (Clarence Gilyard, Jr.), suggests serving a warrant his way, ""nice and easy., but unfortunately Walker never, ever, does anything nice and easy. So Walker does it nice and rough instead, and when you're dealing with the likes of heavy-duty criminals like drug dealers, bank robbers, assassins, cattle rustlers, the Japanese mob, and vengeful escaped convicts, that's the only way to do it.

""If you come back here,"" a dirty sheriff warns Walker in the episode ""Badge of Honor,"" ""you'd better bring an army because you alone just ain't gonna cut it."" Actually, that'll cut it just fine. What makes Walker so satisfying is that justice may be delayed, but it is never denied.

In the episode, ""Mean Streets,"" Walker goes undercover to protect the homeless from a band of rich kids who are preying on them and videotaping the attacks. If this were, say, Law & Order, the kids' parents would hire an elite defense team and the kids might get off scot-free. That's not the way they roll on Walker: Texas Ranger. With the kids in custody, viewers are promised an ""easy"" conviction.

What really kicks this 1993-1994 Season into high gear is the show's new theme song, ""Eyes of a Ranger,"" performed by Norris himself. Jeff Foxworthy has joked, ""If an episode of Walker: Texas Ranger has changed your life, you might be a redneck."" Granted, Walker may not be life-changing TV  la Oprah, but there is considerable spiritual uplift in watching an incorruptible hero tossing Texas' scum of the earth into the back of his pickup truck and taking them to jail.

We join Asst. D.A. Alex Cahill (Sheree J. Wilson) in raising a glass to Walker. ""Here's to the Texas Rangers,"" she toasts in one episode, ""the best there are.

It's also cool to be able to see all these episodes of WALKER, TEXAS RANGER complete & uncut without all those deleted scenes we got on TV Land, WGN, Hallmark Channel, and USA.",1401840000,,2221,4.798429319371728

I couldn't find the second season anywhere so I found it on Amazon.com and the price is the same as if I bought it at our local Movie rental store where we can buy them also. I love the whole series and can watch them anytime of the day or night.  Walker Texas Ranger is built around the morals of our Society before it's corruption in which such TV programs would be considered as square in today's new and changing times. May a thread of people who value truth, honor and principles emerge in the future to help recapture the America of old that is slowly dissolving into a generation of me, me, me.

I bought season 2 because the price at Amazon was right and why would you only want half a set and not the whole collection. What good is an incomplete set. I have seen the show many times but owning it is not like watching it on T.V. with all of the commercials. I have found over the years that T.V. really needs some help. The shows aren't that good, so why not buy what you want to watch. It is a whole site cheaper in the long run than, a one or two year contract with you local Cable Company. After all the cable companies usually show the same movies  you can get on a DVD. So it makes more sense to get it and own it, rather than from some company who shows the feature and it cost more money. Buy the program and save in the Long Run. You can get it for less at Amazon.",1385164800,,880,3.943820224719101

Silk Dreams, Til Death Do Us Part, The Road To Black Bayou, and Cowboy are my favorite episodes on this season. However, I enjoyed them all I really do not have any least favorites in the show. I like them all about the same. I have no complaints with the set. I have heard people complain and say that this show is not what they would like to watch. I however, would like to see more shows like this on tv. I really hated to see this show go off the air. That is why I like having this series on dvd because I can watch this show whenever I would like to. It is a must get for any fan that enjoyed watching Walker Texas Ranger!",1315267200,,729,4.0

2676764,5,B000JLTRMC,"There is not much I can say about this second season release of Walker Texas Ranger. That is because really nothing has changed from the first season. The plots are different of course, but there's still just as much action, excitement, and suspense. Expect more roundhouse kicks, nefarious villains, and truly hilarious moments the way it was all meant to be. You can also expect that same sense of justice when evil criminals are tossed into the bed of Walker's pickup truck, and the awesome new theme song - ""The Eyes of a Ranger"". It's bigger, better, and just plain awesome! Below is a list of episodes included in this seven disc DVD set.
