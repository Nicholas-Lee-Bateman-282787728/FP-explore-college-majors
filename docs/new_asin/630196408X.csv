407462,4,630196408X,"It is time for senior graduation and Andy Hardy (Mickey Rooney) is more excited than anyone, and has taken on more work than anyone too. He is the senior class president but he is also overseeing the senior play which he is in charge of writing, directing, and acting in, he is on the yearbook committee, and he is in charge of the male uniform for graduation. It is no wonder he finds the help of a secretary (Kathryn Grayson) so helpful. Kathryn Land and her family are somewhat poor, so they haven't been active with student affairs before, but Andy's enthusiasm is infectious. With the help of Judge Hardy (Lewis Stone), Mr. Land finds a swell job, but Andy just might manage to mess it up.

As always, Rooney's boundless energy is the pivotal part of the show. Without him, this story would be nowhere near as entertaining. It is nice to see Grayson in an early performance, and she shows of her talent for operatic singing. Unfortunately, her worst two songs are the two at the finale. ""The Mad Scene"" aria is dismal because she looks so bored singing it, and she isn't very good at syncing with the recording. ""I've Got My Eyes on You"" is a more upbeat swing song, but her vocal style is not suited for this type of music and sounds awkward. She gives a good acting performance though, and blends in nicely with the stock cast.",1213574400,,1334,4.467213114754099
407463,5,630196408X,This was one of the better of the Andy Hardy films. Kathryn Grayson is utterly lovely in it. This Hardy film more than others is loaded with New Deal era political correctness which in many ways enhances the films appeal. All the Andy Hardy movies were personal projects of Louis B. Mayer and his hand is all over these movies. The Andy Hardy series was the role of Mickey Rooney's career. When are we going to see on video or DVD The last Andy Hardy movie?. The 1958 Andy Hardy Comes Home.!,1150588800,2,491,4.3478260869565215
407464,5,630196408X,This movie is one of the best of the Andy Hardy films.  Kathyrin Grayson in her first role is terrific.  Mickey Rooney is outstanding as ALWAYS.  Mickey in my opinion is the best.  The movie had a great and funny story.  In this movie Andy Hardy gets into a lot of funny scrapes including trouble with his girlfriend Polly Benedict.  I would Highly recommend purchasing this film.  It's great!,1101081600,3,393,4.608695652173913
407465,3,630196408X,"""Love Finds Andy Hardy"" is usually considered the best film in the Hardy Family series, but ""Andy Hardy's Private Secretary"" might come in a close second primarily because of Kathryn Grayson's strong performance in this, her first film outing at age 19. Grayson was touted as MGM's answer to Deanna Durbin at Universal, and this especially shows in her florid coloratura soprano voice that one finds lighter and freer than Durbin's with an astonishing ease of movement up and down scales.  Grayson's acting is unusually good as well.
The film is typical Hardy fare with Andy getting into more than he bargained for trying to prepare a Greek tragedy piece for his graduation, not to mention flunking his required English exam thus threatening his own graduation.  But as always everything turns out well in the end for Andy et al.  This was the tenth entry in the Andy Hardy series and well worth viewing.",979689600,11,904,4.857142857142857

7819472,5,630196408X,"The Andy Hardy series are one of favorites. These classic films with Mickey Rooney,  and,sometimes, Judy Garland are a delight.
These films where MGM's money making series. Mickey Rooney was casted and well informed, he must act as an innocent young high school lad. The ON DAMAND ordering which is burned on  a DVD-R is a perfect.
