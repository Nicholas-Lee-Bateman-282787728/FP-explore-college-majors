7936425,2,B00005B34I,"Even though I read all the previous reviews, and had considered NOT buying this DVD, in a weak moment I bought it. And I am SORRY I did. Ben E. KIng just doesnt have it anymore as a singer. That once tremendous, wonderful voice is NOT there anymore!! Save your money!! Dont buy it!!!",1100649600,4,283,4.2592592592592595
7936426,1,B00005B34I,"Very nicely recorded in 5.1 surround sound.  Excellent musicianship.  Very poor arragements.  Absolutely soul-less.  Those looking for hot versions of earlier hits, please look elsewhere. There is nothing here that justifies purchasing this disk.  Nothing.",1056326400,4,256,6.2
7936427,1,B00005B34I,"A great collection of songs, to bad he can't sing anymore.  His voice cracks anytime he is expected to carry a note.  Check out the B.B. King instead, it's GREAT!",1004227200,2,162,4.366666666666666
7936428,4,B00005B34I,"Being a long time fan of Ben E. King's, I am very happy that a performance of his has been released on DVD. I would like to respond to Jeff Shannon's review, because it is full of errors. First, fan or not, Doowop is far from dead. PBS's Doo-Wop 50 special was their most succsessful special in years. Two more specials were ordered. It also brought in alot of pledges. Rhino Records Doo-Wop Box is their best selling box set, and Rhino has more box sets then any other company. Volume 2 & 3 were also big sellers. current groups like N'Sync, The Backstreet Boys, Boyz To Men, etc. are based on Doo-Wop groups.  That being said, Ben E. King is/was not a Doo-Wop singer. He was a ""Soul"" or R&B singer. He started out as lead singer of The Drifters, on songs like ""Save The Last Dance For Me"", This Magic Moment"", ""I Count The Tears"",""There Goes My Baby"" etc, but found most of his fame as a solo artist with hits like ""I Who Have Nothing"", Spanish Harlem"", ""Don't Play That Song"", ""Supernatural Thing"", ""Amore"", and of course ""Stand By Me"". Also his first hit was in 1960, not the mid-50's. Just wanted to get the facts right.",991440000,11,1125,4.357142857142857
