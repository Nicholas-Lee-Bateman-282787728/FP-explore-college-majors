5714716,1,B00CCC3QB4,"What a horrid film.  Dialog is terrible, not funny at all.  One of the most painful videos I watched with my kids EVER!  If I could give negative stars it would be a negative 5.",1374451200,2,177,4.0
5714717,1,B00CCC3QB4,"Rented this at our local RedBox. It was AWEFUL! Not at all enjoyable for adults as the movie description stated. The kids tolerated it, but it was painful and moronic. Wish I had seen previous reviews on my iPhone when searching the RedBox app for available movies at our local RedBox location.",1373241600,3,294,4.673076923076923

5714721,1,B00CCC3QB4,"Poor quality animation combined with moronic dialog and a jumpy, incoherent plot. What could make it even worse? Vaguely suggestive content innappropriate for preschoolers. Possibly the worst cartoon I've ever seen.",1422230400,,215,5.967741935483871
5714722,2,B00CCC3QB4,My kids only made it halfway through and got bored.,1414540800,,51,4.2
5714723,1,B00CCC3QB4,"Cute movie and animation, but had no message for kids to take away. All that happened was the characters fought but nothing was ever resolved. There were some suggestive parts and some inappropriate things for young kiddos. Don't be fooled by the cute picture for the movie because it is actually kind of violent. I would not recommend this to a friend with toddlers or anyone in general.",1409011200,3,388,4.720588235294118
5714724,4,B00CCC3QB4,"This is a dark story, very odd, different - which I like.  The animation is fun and the characters are silly, though a bit dark. I would rate it PG, might want to watch it before you let your little one watch it to see if it's ok for your standards.",1394150400,8,249,3.8823529411764706
5714725,5,B00CCC3QB4,We rented this movie at the local grocery store and afterwards just had to buy it. Now my grandson is Happy.,1382140800,3,108,4.190476190476191
5714726,1,B00CCC3QB4,"I have to agree with the other reviews. We got this from redbox. I didn't really have high hopes to begin with, but it seemed to be the best option out of the few choices I had. My kids enjoyed it enough, but they also enjoy obnoxious cereal commercials. The movie was abrupt, made little sense, and fell short of being funny over and over again. Rent something else.",1378598400,,367,4.333333333333333
5714727,1,B00CCC3QB4,"Pretty much the worst movie ever made. I find no redeeming value in it whatsoever. I am glad I got it free with a redbox coupon, because I wouldn't know how to get my money back from redbox.",1378166400,,190,4.026315789473684
