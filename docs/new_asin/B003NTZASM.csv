8401325,5,B003NTZASM,"The GrowFit with The Ball exercise DVD is a good way to add some new twist to your workout toolbox. I started using this DVD to add a piece of equipment (the Ball) and some hand weights to my other regular exercise (yoga and various aerobic activities). If you are familiar with pilates, you will recognize many of the movements and breathing patterns. But even if you have never participated in a pilates class, you will be able to follow along easily. Deborah performs each routine with her voice commands overdubbed (accompanied by a very peaceful soundtrack in the background). Her movements are smooth, precise, and controlled. Her transitions are easy to follow. Her voice cues for breathing and for performing each exercise help you to focus on doing the exercise rather than always looking up to see what she is doing on the DVD (but it is always there as a visual cue to check on!)

I like that there are two different routines on the DVD. This actually gives you three options: Basic, Advanced, or a combination of both (which is what I am currently doing). It is a very peaceful and ""relaxing"" exercise, but you will definitely feel good results if you keep with it. As with any exercise, the more you do it, the more you will begin to pay attention to your own body and the muscle cues. Something that might look or seem simple at first, takes on new challenges as you seek to perfect your form, breathing, and control.

I particularly like adding the Ball into my routine because so many of the exercises help to develop good balance. Both routines have a good variety of exercises. The time moves along very quickly with all the different positions.

I have to say that I appreciate that Deborah looks like a real person (fit and well-toned, but real!). Her exercise clothing is something anyone might wear to a studio, gym, or in your home. This helps to focus on the exercises, not the instructor's body.

In the DVD, the instructor mentions that this routine is only part of a healthy lifestyle (good eating habits, aerobic activity, sleep, etc. are also needed). Her website [...] has healthy tips and encouragement for exercising (and you can also sign up for a free subscription to Fitness Shorts). I look forward to future DVDs that Deborah produces which I hope will add to the variety that helps to keep me exercising. This DVD routine is easy to fit into my schedule.",1275609600,,2391,4.6453900709219855
