8174597,3,B000N3SU6U,My uncle is in this movie and the reason I bought it.  It's a Kooky 70's shagalishous romp around London.,1458259200,,105,4.25
8174598,3,B000N3SU6U,"As far as the movie itself is concerned, it's quite funny and very enjoyable. However it is posted as being remastered and with closed captions. It DOES NOT have closed captions which is a shame because the dialogue is quite funny but it is so muddy that quite a bit is very hard to understand. As far as being remastered, I'd hate to see the original! It's really only about the same quality as a used VHS. It's too bad because this is a great example of British humour - jumping to wrong conclusions, misunderstandings, double entendres,etc spoiled by poor quality.",1370563200,4,567,4.623762376237623
