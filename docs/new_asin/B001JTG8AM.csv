8313711,2,B001JTG8AM,"This DVD has very little to recommend it. It has some good basic techniques. But there is quite a bit of fluff. One of the practitioners has since been discredited, which is not surprising considering some of the fancifulness of the techniques he discusses. I didn't pay much for it, and I indeed got what I paid for.",1436227200,,317,4.482758620689655
8313712,2,B001JTG8AM,"This video looks as if it was shot backstage somewhere, however, the setting is irrelevant.  The sound is okay.  But the real question is about the real meat of the DVD, the techniques.  Well, many of the techniques are ones you'd learn in a regular jujitsu or krav maga class as far as the empty hand techniques go.  Don't get me wrong, they're good techniques but nothing ground breaking or exceptional.  Same with the weapons techniques like knife fighting - pretty basic stuff.  I'm still wondering where the ""extreme"" part comes in.  If you're looking for some good, effective basic techniques then you'll probably enjoy this video.  If you're looking for something more advanced in the realm of close quareters fighting then you'd probably be bored...especially with the one guy who details, for a good 5 minutes everything he's done since WWII only to finally give us a lecture on gait and postural sway.",1314921600,2,911,4.87012987012987
