3872344,2,B0028EQMR6,"ECHO BRIDGE's SCI-FI COLLECTOR'S 4-FILM SET gathers together some less-than-inspiring fantasies on two DVDs. Note that EB (aka ""Platinum Disc"") movies superimpose a faint logo every so often. Their transfers are decent but not perfect. Despite low viewer ratings, this 4-fer still may be worthwhile to diehard sci-fiers, but only if you can catch a good deal on it.

SYNOPSES--

BLACK HOLE - Calcutta tourist destination this ain't! When a space critter passes through a man-made astral phenomenon, it threatens the destruction of St. Louis by first devouring the electric grid. The Pentagon gets in on the fun with a slated nuclear launch against the abandoned city.

LAST SENTINEL - A tired premise: technology attacks its creator, only-fair special FX and a weak cast make for slow going. Throw in a cybercized cop and beauty queen out to save the world and this bad film gets pretty dismal.

FINAL DAYS - Archaeologists discover underground bug-aliens that plan to conquer Earth by eating us all. (Pass the mayo and Flit, please...)

SUPERNOVA - Lightbulbs and heat lamps don't last forever, and 'Sol' is no exception. Here, an astrophysicist believes he can stop the sun from popping like a corn kernel and destroying our solar system in the process. (Pass the hot buttered, please...)

8356076,4,B0028EQMR6,"I know I'm being fairly generous by giving this 4 stars, but I think all in all 4 out of five seems most fitting, and giving it 3 would be a bit less than it deserves.

Okay, you all know the deal by now four made for tv sciffy movies ranging from awful to meh quality.

The Hole: Terrible. couldn't hold my interest 20 minutes in. This is the worst of the four, and you should just pretend it's not in the dvd set. Toddlers are the only demographic appropriate for it.

Supernova: Semi-Okay. if you could withstand the first 40 minutes of bad dialogue and bullshit, then it's not too bad. But it's certainly not anything special.

These first two are more disaster movies than they are Science Fiction movies, if that's what you prefer than I suggest buying instead the The ECHO BRIDGE DISASTER 4 FILM COLLECTOR'S SET here on amazon if that's more to your liking.

The Last Sentinel: Disappointing. This was the one that I really wanted to like, because it had Katee Sackhoff in it. The premise was something we've seen a million times before, but I was genuinely expecting a bit more from this because it had fairly big name actors. But unfortunately it was just lackluster. The action was decent, and you get to see Katee's sideboob for a second, but this one just isn't redeemable and only marginally better than the other two.

Final Days of Planet Earth: Not too bad. This one surprised me a little it still wasn't good, but it's the most watchable of the 4. It is very long though, and pretty slow so you might get bored of it but it doesnt require you to pay too much attention with the plot bugs attack people and wanna take over the world that's it. It's not a bad choice if you have three hours to kill and just want to casually watch something.

All in all this set is definitely worth the money, you get some minimal special features like ""the making of"" featurettes and some commentaries, which is good for dvds like these. Amazon sells this used for a cent and 2.99 shipping, which is a pretty good deal,you just have to know what to expect with sets like these that's all. I find it annoying when people buy dvds like these and complain for not getting a bunch of masterpieces. I mean these are 4 movies for less than five bucks, what do you expect? My advice if you wanna buy this set: check your brain at the door and enjoy these d-grade cheeseflicks.",1351468800,3,2369,4.394977168949771
8356077,3,B0028EQMR6,"If you like made for TV science fiction, heavy on the fiction, type movies, then here is your 4 pack. I found the movies rather boring and I knew I would find them boring too, but the temptation of a discount 4 pack was too much for me. So I said, ""What the heck?"" It was only $5.00, so what could I lose other than $5.00 and 6 hours of my life?

The movies aren't complete busts, and are only mildly entertaining. They are a step above Asylum movies, but not a large step.

Now if I was about 10 years old and couldn't get enough sci-fi, such a gift, especially on blue-ray and for less than a dollar (plus shipping) might be worth while. I don't recall much in the way of adult action and words.

If you liked the horrendous ""Ice Age 2012"" because you thought it was a good flick,you will love this 4 pack.",1325289600,2,808,4.10126582278481
