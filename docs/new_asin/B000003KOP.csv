7902950,4,B000003KOP,"When faced with a swarm of space-dwelling life forms which appear to show ""reproductive interest"" in Voyager, the crew is faced with a few difficult realities...among them, the reality that if Voyager takes 70 years to get back to the Alpha Quadrant, replacement crew will be necessary.  In this episode, there is an interesting and thought-provoking exchange between Janeway and Chakotay in this regard, and I think that this exchange serves to bolster the overall storyline of the series and makes it more realistic.
At the same time this is going on, Kes and Nelix face their own reproductive dilemma...but this exchange is not nearly so enlightening, in my opinion....instead, it came off very much like the humdrum arguments that couples have on any 'ole TV drama.  The writers could have done more with this bit, and that is why I give this episode only 4 stars.
As an added highlight, this episode contains one of the best quotes of season two.  At the very end, Janeway comments to Chakotay that if she has any further questions regarding reproduction, she knows who to ask (him).  As a woman fan of the series, I know exactly what she means!  He'd be the guy I'd ask as well!",995328000,3,1184,4.728155339805825
