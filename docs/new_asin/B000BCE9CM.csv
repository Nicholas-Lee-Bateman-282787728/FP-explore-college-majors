2413511,5,B000BCE9CM,This product is exactly what I was hoping for.  This is definitely a beginners level and since I have no previous experience with yoga exercises this is just what I needed.  Very pleased.,1179619200,18,187,4.636363636363637
2413512,5,B000BCE9CM,"I just purchased this set so I have not gotten to the pilates workouts yet, but I was interested in it mostly for the yoga practices. The yoga instructor is quite good and the practice leaves me limber and relaxed. I found it was simple to follow, but a great stretch.",1153094400,15,268,4.2745098039215685

8085126,2,B000BCE9CM,Not as good and they do a little too much explaining on moves. Prefer yoga workout for dummies fat burning series.,1438646400,,114,4.476190476190476
8085127,4,B000BCE9CM,Great DVD.  I have taken both yoga and pilates in-person classes so I am familiar with the terms and basic instructions.  This DVD helped me continue the regime on my own at my own schedule.  Great instructors and tips.  Good format.,1419120000,,233,4.609756097560975

8085129,5,B000BCE9CM,"Ever since I rented 'Yoga for Dummies' from the library a few years ago I'd been looking to purchase a copy for myself, but they were always super expensive. Then I found this version for a decent price and thought might as well try some pilates too! It's the only Yoga video I can follow.",1391472000,2,289,4.2727272727272725
8085130,5,B000BCE9CM,I'm a guy! I was a little skeptical that the Pilates workout was going to do anything for me - how wrong I was!! I started to see a difference in my abs & legs within two weeks!!,1366675200,4,178,3.710526315789474
8085131,3,B000BCE9CM,"Te Pilates DVD is excellent in every way, and the instructor is fantastic.  The yoga video's exercises are fine, but the instructor for the yoga version (who is different than the Pilates DVD) is extremely annoying and that kind of ruined it for me.  If you are interested in buying this DVD, save your money by getting the Pilates-only version.",1291593600,,345,4.733333333333333
8085132,5,B000BCE9CM,The results that you achieve from this product is great. I recommend it highly for the beginner and the novice.,1207785600,7,111,4.6
