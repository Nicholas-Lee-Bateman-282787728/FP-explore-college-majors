5299721,3,B009AMALBM,"I went because I loved Pitt and Dominick's Assassination of Jesse James.  Their take on that bit of tradition I felt stripped bare the heroic images to reveal immature young men walking the edges of sanity.  Killing Them Softly did reveal some immature not-so-young men walking the edges of insanity. It also seemed to be comparing Brad Pitt's hit man, who prefers to kill them softly (not close up and personal), with government CEOs and banker ""hit men"" who wipe out the poor (including the poor ignorant bastards trying to make money off their heist in this film) from a distance.  But the metaphor doesn't quite come off and the violence is overdone for my sensibilities.  On the up side, Brad Pitt is impressively cool and the acting all top-notch.",1355443200,8,753,4.769230769230769
5299722,3,B009AMALBM,"On paper, Killing Them Softly sounds like a winning proposition.  It's from director Andrew Dominick, who helmed The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, one of the finest films of the past decade. It features some excellent actors; Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Scott McNairy, Ray Liotta, Richard Jenkins, and Vincent Curatola are all fine actors.  In execution however, the film is a mixed bag. It alternates between a slow talky existential gangster movie and a very blunt political satire.  The finished product has some nice standout scenes and dialogue, but it's too slow and too muddled to be considered a success.

The plot centers around a heist of a poker game that sends the local mafia in New Orleans in to an economic tailspin.  This all happens during the run up to the 2008 presidential election of Barack Obama.  Parallels are drawn between the gangsters in the movie and the people on Wall Street and in Washington who perpetrated the housing bubble that lead to the economic crash.  Criminal activity freezes up and money quits moving, similar to the credit shortage attributed to the banking crash.  Just about every scene has talk radio or CSPAN on in the background.

A few individual scenes stand out.  The heist sequence is near perfect.  Gandolfini's scenes, though somewhat superfluous to the overall narrative, are acted with authority.  Gandolfini really is a fine actor, and he pulls of his scenes with gusto.  The drive out for the final hit is quite well done and suspenseful.

The problem is the individual scenes don't really make for a satisfying whole.  I found the narrative rather slow and too deliberately paced, and this is coming from a guy who normally enjoys when a film takes it's time.  The political subtext is not really subtext at all, considering it almost continuously runs in the background of every scene.  It's about as subtle as a kick in the teeth.  Too much of the film can be summed up as aging and depressed gangsters discussing things in bars, cars, and hotel rooms while political talk radio or CSPAN run in the background.

If you're in to gangster movies then this is worth a look.  It's artistically accomplished and frequently quite arresting visually.  It lacks the painterly compositions Richard Deakins accomplished for Jesse James, but it's grit and grime really come through.  Dominick is obviously a talented director, but he give in to some of his own excesses here a bit too much.",1355356800,64,2468,4.896385542168675
5299723,1,B009AMALBM,"This movie was boring! The editing was terrible. Great storyline, but the action pace was too slow. Great actors in a losing script.

5299724,2,B009AMALBM,"For me, no two ways about it: this was bad.

I wanted to like it.  I thought the cast was sharp (Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Ray Liotta, Richard Jenkins, Sam Shepard, Vincent Curatola, and a young actor I like named Scoot McNairy), the adaptation of novelist George V. Higgins' book sounded interesting, and the promising good reviews had come in from Cannes and elsewhere.  I was hoping to discount the low grumbling I'd heard from some of the few members of the general public who did make it to the theaters to see it.

Yes, I hoped I was going to like it, and sure enough I felt the beginning of the movie was extremely promising.  I got the feeling it was trying to be all those gritty movies and cable shows one reveres--a latter-day ""Sopranos,"" or a grittier ""Goodfellas"" or even...dare I say it? A Tarantino-esque venture.

I though maybe, just maybe there might be something here within the hard-to-like characters and the strange cadence of their conversations: not only between the dumb crooks who felt they could rip off other crooks, but also the ones between two other, sharper crooks who were called in to deal with the first guys.  Oh, good, I thought: a wise ""talkie"" crime film full of clever, realistic street dialogue and occasional shocking cruelty.

And as it began I thought...how clever to set it in an unusual era (2008, during which a politically charged Senator Obama and sitting president George W. Bush trade their versions of the American dream).  How cleverly the words of politicians will serve as a counterpoint to the brutality in the words and deeds of the criminal element of these ""business"" men.

Yeah...it's just that it didn't accomplish any of this.  At least not that I felt.  It was a dreary (constantly raining) and dismal film absent of anything that could remotely be thought of as snappy, clever dialogue.  There were a couple of really laughably vulgar comments (especially delivered by Gandolfini), but I didn't think those made it under anything close to wittiness.

I didn't read Higgins' original work, but it had to be better laid out than this.  I didn't mind the rootless ugliness of having to do ""business"" this way, or the disappointing unfairness of having to do repulsive things, or even the poorly thought out pointlessness of the violent trade--I could take those things.  It was that there was nothing sharp or new about this film.

Okay, I get it: this is a visceral world where bad things happen.  College types need not apply.  And I get the whole counterpoint of the election, too: that America is a business.  And I suppose it could be said that the empty ""charm"" of the politicians was in its own way hideous to the criminal element, too, right?

No...that may be among the things this was trying to say, but it was dull as dishwater and had the subtlety of a hemorrhoid.  By the tired end of this tired movie I was tired of making excuses on its behalf.  Its dialogue was not witty; it just used a lot of crudity and brashness. I'm not a prude...I just believe there's a difference between good dialogue and bad, and vulgarity has its place among many great works.

But this just wandered around, aimless.  It was like watching a bunch of guys argue for about an hour and a half.  There was action, and it came across as shocking (which it should), but it's a poor movie that simply depends on shock value in place of cleverness.  And sometimes it was stupid: why would a seasoned hit man shoot over the roof of his car at a mark who on the other side of his car?  I couldn't think of a worse ""advantage.""

And the whole thing about America being a con game...there was such a sledge hammer approach to it as a symbol here that it may as well have had bells go off whenever the TV was blaring its message.  ""Here I am!"" it shouts...""I'm talking here!""  TV's ""Family Guy"" uses more nuance.

Sorry, guys, I really wanted to like this.  I'm giving it three stars because, gosh, it DOES have this great cast.  I would love to love this film, but no.  I really didn't.  And, to top it all off, there was suddenly this point when it was abruptly...OVER.

However, I probably shouldn't complain: like the grunts used to say about their military chow: ""It was awful and there was too little of it.""

Maybe that's the one thing for which I should have thanked THEM.",1354752000,11,4326,4.57012987012987
5299725,1,B009AMALBM,"THis movie was a waste of time.  If you are looking for a Pulp Fiction type movie this is not it.  There were creepy films of Obama and Bush running through the beginning middle and end of this movie that I found irritating.  A little too close to an indoctrination or propaganda film.  I guess the point was hit men are affected by the economy too but I didn't like it.
It was just a big nothing.",1354406400,9,397,4.116883116883117
5299726,2,B009AMALBM,"""Killing them softly"" is how hit man Brad Pitt likes to go about his business, but the real killing that goes on here is killing the hour and a half of our lives spent watching this film.

The film is essentially a series of one on one dialogues between various cast members - Pitt and James Gandolfino reminisce, Pitt and Richard Jenkins make deals, Ben Mendelsohn and Trevor Long get stoned together, etc. In between there are a few plot points, but these are few and secondary to the dialogue. While this type of word rich cinematography works at times (""My Breakfast with Andre""), it seems badly out of place in an action film about hit men. Used sparingly (the DeNiro Pacino meeting in ""Heat"") these scenes can add to a film, but used as the main method of communication, they are risky.

The film is not without some redeeming qualities. The acting is superb. Pitt, Gandolfino, Jenkins, Mendelsohn and Long all put in sterling performances. And the photography by Greig Fraser (""Snow White and the Huntsman"", ""Bright Star"") is excellent as are the special effects. And one can get some sense of ironic pleasure watching Ray Liotta take a beating, since we're used to him being on the opposite side of this interaction.

In the end, the fault must be assigned to writer and director Andrew Dominik who fails to disengage from the one on one vignettes. This is only the third film for Dominick, and his last effort was also with Pitt (""The Assassination of Jesse James..."") and also suffered from an over abundance of words and an absence of action.

In addition, Dominik's heavy-handed use of clips from the 2008 Presidential campaign do not serve to underscore his message (crime is business) but rather distract from what is otherwise an excellent display of acting.

Bottom line - great acting and photography in search of a good film. If you're interested in acting per se, this film is a great opportunity to see some excellent acting enhanced by gifted photography. But if you're looking for an engaging film, look elsewhere.",1354320000,4,2036,4.7727272727272725
5299727,3,B009AMALBM,"Brad Pitt's performance as mob hit man Jackie is getting a lot of attention but he doesn't come into the picture until well into the second act.  He is hired to ""resolve"" an issue of mob sanctioned poker games being held up.  One game in particular is run by a small time crook named Markie (Ray Liotta).  In reality, he hired a couple of low-lifes to rob his own game.  Then, years later began to brag about it.  Not smart.  Another set of dimwit crooks (Scoot McNairy and Ben Medelsohn) are persuaded by another (Vincent Curatola) to knock off the game again.  They figure poor old Markie would be fingered, assuming he would be dumb enough to pull the same stunt twice.

Director/writer Andrew Dominik is no stranger to long-winded scenes (check out the superior ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" also starring Pitt) but here, it just didn't seem natural.  Certainly Dominik has Scorsese and Tarantino as influences for staging long dialog-heavy scenes between gangsters, not to mention a heavy dose of stylized violence.  The initial hold up scene is pretty tense and very well done.

Later in the film, James Gandolfini shows up as a secondary hit man to help Jackie.  He's ugly, heavy, profane and drunk throughout his scenes.  Gandolfini does a fine job with the role, but it is clearly not essential to the story.  I didn't get it.  Richard Jenkins is the middle manager contact for Jackie and some of the conversations between him and Pitt's character are certainly worthwhile.

Violence?  You bet.  But that is to be expected going in and there are only a couple that might get some people uncomfortable.  The movie isn't terrible but it isn't great either.  The whole bit with Gandolfini's character got me off track somehow.",1354320000,2,1763,4.774834437086093
5299728,4,B009AMALBM,"""Killing Them Softly"" (2012 release; 100 min.) reunites writer/director Andrew Dominik with Brad Pitt (following 2007's ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford""). The movie brings the story of how some small-time thieves hold up a poker game organized for the mob by Markie (played by Ray Liotta). The mob brings in Jackie (played by Brad Pitt) to find out who did the hold-up and to ""clean things up, and so Jackie goes about his business. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: when all is said and done, the substantive plot is surprisingly meager, and in that sense there is no suspense whatsoever in how things will turn out. Instead the movie focuses on conversations between the various characters in the movie, which works great. If you've seen the trailer for this movie, you are aware already that there are several violent scenes in the movie, but for the most part they are brought in a very stylish manner (at one point one of the main characters is gunned down and the whole scene, shown in slow motion and set to the 1960s Ketty Lester hit ""Love Letters"", feels like an orchestrated ballet scene. That said, there is another scene in which Markie is beaten up that is over-the-top violent, so viewer beware. Despite the 1980s feeling to many scenes in the movies (check out many of the cars used by the main characters), the movie is set very specifically in the Fall of 2008, as we see a number of clips featuring Bush and Obama, commenting on the then just exploding financial crisis, which is in marked contrast (or perhaps not?) to the violence occurring in the movie.

But most of all this movie is about incredible acting performances. Let's start off with Brad Pitt, who is masterful as Jackie, with a physical presence in his role that belies his age (Pitt is nearing 50, if you can believe it). Several other side roles are brought quite nicely as well, certainly Ray Liotta as Markie, but also Ben Mendelsohn as one of the poker game robbers who turns out to be a complete junkie living fix to fix. But the real scene-stealer for me was James Gandolfini as Mickey, a one-time associate of Jackie who gets called in by Jackie to provide some assistance but instead it turns out has become a drunk unable to do the job. While Gandolfini has brought this type of ""bad"" character before, he nevertheless once again does it with a fervor that remains compelling to watch. Bottom line, I enjoyed this movie from start to finish and couldn't believe when the light came on in the theatre tonight how quickly the movie had come and gone. Highly recommended!",1354233600,65,2698,4.642259414225942
5299729,5,B009AMALBM,"I am happy that Killing Them Softly is a vehicle that finally...finally...sees Brad Pitt in a starring role, which is so rare because he has only been in Happy Feet 2, Moneyball, The Tree of Life, Megamind, Inglorious Basterds and The Curious Life of Ben Buttons in just the last couple of years. I'm happy that he will finally have some more cash in his pocket to help feed his wifey, Angelina Jolley. With Xmas coming up, I know how hard it can be for high-earning, Hollywood actors to still feed their wifeys...so I'm happy for his career boost!

Killing Them Softly is, first of all, a totally original work, as demonstrated by the fact that the director like totally s/to/l/e the story from the 1974 George 5 Higgins novella. In this highly original movie, Pitt performs the role of a professional enforcer (read: hitman, but not like Bret the Hitman Hart) by the name of Jackie Coogan. I was originally confused at the naming of the character because Jackie is obviously a name reserved exclusively for the skirts, and Pitt may be a little bit foppish, but he is definitely no dame. Anyhoo, the Pittster as Jackie (girl name) Coogan investigates a heist--which I think is a highfalutin way of saying ""robbery""--that happens to happen while a mob-guarded poker game of high stakes is underway! Whew! Just writing that brief summary gave me the runs because it was so action-packed.

Even though this movie is a great example of a modern-day thriller with a bit of a crime caper thrown in, there were parts that just left me cold and ungratified. For instance, during the mob-enforced poker game, because the mob is Italian, all the poker players are seen gorging themselves on Olive Garden takeout food! I never felt so offended in my life at a blatant case of ethnic stereotyping in the movies! Porca miseria, I say, porca miseria! Mama mia...

Another portion of the movie that still sits funny in the pit of my stomach is--again, keep in mind that the plot revolves around the Italian mob--a scene when Pitt and James Gandolfini (played by Will Sa/s/s/o) pose as construction workers to further their investigation. Even though they are supposed to be undercover, they start catcalling and whistling as pretty girls whenever they walk by them!! That is heinous stereotyping of swarthy, Italian-American construction workers and what their behavior may or may not be when pretty girls sashay past them with arched backs! Porca miseria, I say, porca miseria!",1354233600,4,2464,4.834123222748815
5299730,4,B009AMALBM,"""Killing Them Softly"" is kind of like if Larry (Michael Pitt) and Tommy (Michael Stuhlbarg) had an entire movie to have entertaining conversations and screw up the entire time instead of being killed off in the opening scene of ""Seven Psychopaths."" Russell's little dog operation is very similar to the one Billy (Sam Rockwell) and Hans (Christopher Walken) are also a part of in ""Seven Psychopaths."" The opening credits of ""Killing Them Softly"" are unique yet extremely irritating. They cut back and forth between Frankie walking down a tunnel as Obama speaks and a black background with white text for the credits. The transition starts off slow at first, but becomes more and more frequent. It puts you on edge and maybe that's the point.

The entire film revolves around really bizarre conversations. Think really off the wall type conversations not unlike those found in ""Seven Psychopaths"" or the more sex driven conversations between Mads Mikkelsen and Kim Bodnia in Nicholas Winding Refn's ""Pusher."" Every time two people are in a car, you should pay close attention because it's almost always entertaining. The humor is very dark and covers everything from sex to dish gloves to the economy and everything in between.

One of the best examples of the humor in the film lies within the meaning of the title of the film. Jackie is having this conversation with the driver (Richard Jenkins) and Jackie asks him if he's ever killed anyone before saying some people get very ""touchy feely"" whenever they're about to die. Jackie then turns to the driver and says, ""They cry, they plead, they beg, they piss themselves, they cry for their mothers. It gets embarrassing. I like to kill 'em softly. From a distance.""

There are some really fantastic camera techniques utilized in the film. When Jackie is first introduced, he gets out of his car and walks onto a construction site. The camera starts at his feet and slowly pans up to the back of his head as he walks. The camera is propped on the car door as Jackie gets in and out of the car in a scene near the end of the film. One of the most uniquely edited scenes is when Russell is talking to Frankie. After shooting up and being awake for a week straight, Russell begins going in and out of consciousness while he's talking and smoking a cigarette. What you see on screen is almost like the light at the end of a dark tunnel or when you squint your eyes in the bright sun.

There is this really incredible beat down in the rain. The combination of the harsh sound effects, the puddles of blood, the angry assailants, and the helpless victim dancing clumsily in the pouring down rain makes you cringe a bit. The scene is the first real taste of violence in the film and it's so sudden that it almost takes your breath away. Slow motion also deserves a mention. Jackie's first kill is done in slow motion and it is just full of downright mayhem and destruction.

You do wish there was a bit more to ""Killing Them Softly"" though. The ending is just magnificent as is the last speech given by one of the characters. It's some of the best written material to be put to film this year, but it would've been nice to have seen a bit more action and a little less talking. Everyone in the film listens to politics and it doesn't really all come together until that final scene. The biggest setback is that Mickey (James Gandolfini) is kind of pointless in the long run. Jackie and the driver make him useful, but it's done off-screen. In the meantime, Mickey is useless and does nothing but drink himself stupid and screw every hooker in town.

Next to ""Lawless,"" ""Killing Them Softly"" is the other must-see mob related film you should go out of your way to see this year. You don't expect it to be as funny as it is, but it's also extremely intense. The film is like a lion stalking its prey. It slowly creeps up on you the entire film until it chooses to pounce and show its true colors. ""Killing Them Softly"" is a volatile piece of crime cinema that is ferocious and violent as hell.",1354147200,4,4034,4.564917127071824

5299820,1,B009AMALBM,"Degenerative, confusing crime drama follows hitman Jackie Cogan (played fairly straight here by Brad Pitt) as he attempts to straighten out the situation surrounding an upper end card game heist that went down in a style similar to a hijacking that occurred years before. But as he gets closer to completing the job, Cogan becomes more of a revisionist philosopher than he does a true, no-nonsense hitman.
Sad to report, KILLING THEM SOFTLY is really too stylish for its own good, with the camera playing tricks upon the audience, and with the actors trying to mess around with different vocal accents and styles of performance that for me didn't land. Post-GOODFELLAS Ray Liotta gets in over his head in this film, and is savagely beaten to a pulp in an unusually disgusting scene that is a bit shocking for a mainstream film. And yet the majority of the movie runs at a snail's pace, trying to offset the lack of action occurring onscreen by presenting low-life characters who attempt to chew the cud and discuss the current economic crisis of 2008 rather than trying to live meaningful lives. At a mere 97 minutes in length, the word around the Hollywood campfire is that director Andrew Dominick initially prepared a longer cut of the movie that ran in excess of two and a half hours, and might have made more sense than this cramped, unusually empty-headed version that we have here. Although one would be stretching it a bit to refer to Brad Pitt as a technical actor, this role gives him a chance to act tough but really doesn't give him as much to do as you might at first think. In any case, the wonderful (and now unfortunately deceased) James Gandolfini gives what is perhaps the picture's best performance, playing an unconscionably sleazy parolee who is supposed to help Pitt's character get things done (but who only wants to booze it up and visit with the ladies instead). Overall, the picture is too post-modern and too ""cool"" for its own good--I'd rather be entertained rather than get 'clevered' to death, but clever and subdued is what this movie is really all about.
A project handled by the Weinstein brothers, this movie deserves its R rating 100%, containing some brutal violence, several cold-blooded killings, and some rather ear drubbing (and filthy) dialogue that no other pre-requisite gangster movie can quite prepare you for. And to add insult to injury, there is the typical preachiness involved in the movie's last scene, a race-baiting effort to shame Thomas Jefferson through revisionist lies and to attack our nation for being more ""business"" than actual country. Some in the audience will undoubtedly cheer on this moment, but I personally found it offensive and (narratively speaking) unnecessary. This one was made by a filmmaker who thinks he understands what it means to make gangster cinema but really only has an academic climatician's sense of what is out there in the atmosphere. It takes more than rain and bloodshed to make a good neo-noir folks. The picture and sound on my DVD were fine, actually quite good overall, but this is not the kind of movie that I can recommend at all. And it does make me a bit mournful in a way, as I was hoping for a better treatment of the source novel by George V. Higgins. In any case, this failed effort won't stop me from watching THE FRIENDS OF EDDIE COYLE again, a much stronger picture made in a more sensible era. F+",1488844800,,3403,4.759729272419627

All this takes place during the nicely timed ""financial crisis"" between the Bush/Obama political transitiona transition some might call a regime change.

A star studded cast includes the late Gandolfini. In a scene with Pitt, Gandolfini's character is on a drinking binge. According to reports, Gandolfini consumed large amounts of alcohol (along with food)  that may have contributed to Gandolfini's heart failure and subsequent death. Great performance tragic foreshadowing.

Put your cognitive biases aside while you ingest the unique point of view in this extraordinarily well-told story. Not convinced? Watch it a second time.

Is that Markey (Ray Liotta) standing in as a societal scapegoat? You be the judge.

5299950,3,B009AMALBM,"I love the look of this film and I love the performances.  If you love James Gandolfini, he gets about 10 solid minutes and he's fascinating to watch.  The problem is that this is a crime/gangster genre film but it tries to be a message film.  It tries to say something important about the United States or the economy or whatever.  The problem is that it doesn't do a very good job of it.  It intersperses the movie with real-life audio/video clips from the 2008 financial crisis.  And it does this in a very ham-fisted obvious way - by lingering too long on presidential speeches.  It slows the pacing down and it never lets the viewer forget that this is supposed to be an important film.  The worst thing is that the presidential speeches almost seem to have been added as an afterthought, during the editing process.  As a crime genre film, it's okay.  You see men discussing who should die next for political/business reasons.  The Sopranos also did this well.  Brad Pitt is pretty good as the cynical hitman with a clear-eyed view of what America is today.  But the movie has pacing issues.  If you want to see a cynical in-depth treatment of the financial crisis (which is also riveting and entertaining) then I suggest checking out ""The Big Short"".",1462924800,,1257,4.603603603603603

5300055,2,B009AMALBM,"If you are looking for an action packed movie, best move on.  This one won't fill that bill.  This is a slow mover that just keeps plowing on.

Brad Pitt plays a hitman (as well as the producer of this movie) out to figure out who hit Markie Trattman's (Ray Liotta) card game.  This is the second time one of Trattman's games has been hit.  The first time he was responsible for his own theft thus all eyes are on him for the second robbery.

There's really not a whole lot worth watching about this movie.  In fact, it took me about 15 minutes to figure out that I had seen this before but never finished it.  Even after watching it all the way through I figured I didn't watch it ask the way the first time for a reason.  The news snippets seen and heard throughout the movie are indicative of the times.  The financial markets are dying.  The robbery is a ironic or even sarcastic remark of the times.

I had hoped for much, much more.  Even the second time I had hoped for more.  It never came to pass.",1456617600,,1006,4.171875
5300056,4,B009AMALBM,"I like it -- but I'm not sure I like liking it.  It's a dark, dark comedy, and it's very well made and splendidly performed.  The basics of the plot follow closely its source -- a novel by George V. Higgins -- but the director, Andrew Dominick, contextualizes the action against the financial meltdown of 2008 and the Presidential election of that same year.  The result is that there's a constant discourse going on about money among the little grifters who rob a mob-backed poker game and the enforcers who seek to make them pay a price, while in the background we constantly hear news reports about the extreme measures that the Federal Reserve is having to take to prop up the financial system and speeches by McCain and Obama that reference a larger hope of a ""united"" America.  The movie isn't an allegory, though -- rather, it deploys ironic counterpointing of the small-time criminal endeavors in the foreground and the evidence of larger-scale malfeasance in the background, and the two come together in the final scene when Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt), who has kept up his end of the deal as an ""enforcer,"" has a conversation about what he's owed even as Obama's victory speech is on television in the bar where he is being paid off.  Cogan's final speech -- a comment on Obama's speech and on his own situation -- is wonderfully put over by Brad Pitt.

None of the characters in the movie is remotely likeable, but the two saps who do the robbery that initiates the action (played by Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn) are so pathetic that you almost feel sorry for them.  Pitt's Jackie is a business-like enforcer, who likes things done with minimum unpleasantness, and from a distance, if possible.  Richard Jenkins is Driver, the liaison between Jackie and the bosses who want the robbers dealt with.  The writing throughout is of very high quality, though those queasy with profanity, sexism, and homophobia should probably steer clear.  James Gandolfini almost steals the show as an alcoholic over-the-hill hit-man hired by Cogan so that he (Cogan) can keep a decent distance from some of the mess.  The scene in which Pitt realizes that Gandolfini's character isn't going to be up to the job is a highlight of the movie.

Dominick also paces the violence in the movie very shrewdly -- the worst of it comes early and is non-lethal.  That means that later in the movie we're mostly savoring interactions between characters, some of whom are trying to avoid the worst consequences of what they have done and others who are trying to bring these consequences about.  The distinctiveness of the characters, the smartness of the writing, and the ironic counterpointing with the financial meltdown keep us hooked.  The pacing is perfect, the plotting is tight (under 100 minutes!), and there isn't a weak link in the cast. Ray Liotta has a cameo and Sam Shepard a mini-cameo.  Brad Pitt, who has become a very versatile actor, gives a sterling performance here, and Gandolfini and Jenkins are splendid too.  Just be aware -- the only uplift here, Obama's rhetoric notwithstanding, is aesthetic.",1456358400,,3101,4.831758034026465

Alas, this movie is less about the parables and parallels, and more about wasted opportunities and second class acting, writing, and directing.

Whereas the core of the story is a simple mob story where 1 steals from 2 and 3 orders 1 hit, the studio adaptation of the George Higgins novel falls flat.  Several scenes in the movie go on far too long, evidenced by the brutal beating of Ray Liotta's character as well as the interminable hotel conversations between a bored looking Pitt and Gandolfini.  Incessant amateurish dialog displaces dramatic tension leaving the movie without a dramatic anchor.  A slow motion sequence where a main character is killed is hideously choreographed and edited, and unnecessarily drawn out.

To those smarter than I the continuous television and radio political speeches about the financial collapse are meaningful to this mob revenge tale.  For me this background noise added nothing- no parables, no context, no enrichment, no exposition.  After awhile it feels like a coincidence that everywhere these characters go they're avoiding ESPN like the plague.

Brad Pitt delivers a reasonably restrained and nuanced performance, although when he sits opposite Gandolfini one gets the impression he's thinking ""Can I PLEASE get my paycheck and leave?""

5300473,4,B009AMALBM,"Killing Them Softly is a neo-noir crime film based on the 1974 novel Cogan's Trade by George V. Higgins.

In the past, Markie Trattman, the proprietor of a criminal poker ring operating in an unspecified New Orleans neighborhood, decides to orchestrate an inside job by paying two men to rob his poker room. He holds up under questioning by the hit-man Dillon, although he later openly admits his involvement to various criminal figures; he suffers no retaliation. Amidst the American financial crisis, a man named Johnny ""Squirrel"" Amato plans to rob Markie's next poker game, anticipating the mafia will blame Markie for the heist. He enlists Frankie, a nave, former business associate with a boy's voice, and Russell, an unstable heroin addict who is stealing purebred dogs for money, to perform the robbery. Upon completing the crime, Russell travels to Florida to sell the purebred dogs. Driver, an emissary for the mafia, converses with a hit-man named Jackie Cogan. Although Jackie understands Markie was uninvolved in the aforementioned heist, he believes Markie should be murdered in order to restore the mobsters' confidence in the local gambling scene.

The dialogue is sharp and so are the performances. Andrew Dominik directed this neo-noir in a low-key comic style that's alternately gritty and fancy as he mixes conventional mobster mayhem with an unconventional take on gangsters caught up in the Great Recession. And with Brad Pitt as his ideologically enraged male muse hit-man, as if wandering in from Occupy Wall Street.

First you have the Laurel and Hardy heroin addicts, who blunder into a big score.  Then, you have the organizers of a gambling den, from the bottom feeders to the middle managers.  Finally, to clean up the mess, they bring in bullies and a seriously efficient killer.  They are all wonderfully acted characters, even Brad Pitt whom I normally bypass as over-rated.  Gandolfini has a wonderful cameo as a drunken hood trying to retire and more interested in partying, who Pitt tries to salvage from his bender.

Perhaps this wasn't a hit because it is so horrifically violent.  I found it entertaining, smart, and vivid.  Recommended.",1415232000,,755,4.8359375

5300479,1,B009AMALBM,"Here is movie so pointless, ridiculous, disgusting and stupid that I actually came away from the experience angry. The movie accomplishes the rare feat of being both simplistic and confusing.  The story's utter familiarity is only mitigated by a plot development so unrealistic that it might take your breath away.  All you get here is a few minutes of gangster dialogue, Brad Pitt in some nice clothes, hyperviolence, blood, and puke.  See. Ray Liotta hosts a poker game that is attended by a lot of mob types.  He decides to rob the poker game, gets away with it, and then later on in the film, while sitting at the very same poker table and laughing, he admits to it.  A couple other criminals decide to rob the card game again assuming Liotta's character will get blamed for it.  Eventually the movie just ends.  The flick is ridiculous and stupid because NO gangster would ever admit to robbing his own card game to a bunch of other gangsters playing cards.  It is offensive because it assumes the viewer is simple enough to be entertained by watching a bunch of people we have no emotional investment in get brutally and explicitly beaten and killed (even slasher movies need some context).  It is disgusting because it assumes that anyone wants to see anyone else vomit.  It is hilarious because of the pedestrian and frankly bizarre manner in which it tries to make some nebulous point about the American economy. And the ending is a masterclass in meaninglessness.

5300577,3,B009AMALBM,"I really liked the trailer and story associated with the film Killing Them Softly, as it appeared to be an original idea in the genre of organized crime. Usually these films are all somewhat similar to The Godfather or Goodfellas, and while that's not a bad thing, I was really interested in seeing something a little different. Killing Them Softly starts out on the right foot, with a daring heist and a bunch of wiseguys left reeling. I was excited and thought this would be a terrific film, but as it continues it really slows down and the story dies right along with it. After a big mafia card game is robbed, the wiseguys want answers and turn to a man named Jackie (Brad Pitt), a problem solver who works under the radar to get the right answers to the right people. Almost as soon as the heist and fallout from it are over, the film goes from an Action Thriller to a painfully slow Drama. Killing Them Softly had all the makings of a great mob movie, the story, an intriguing leading character, and three guys who were in the Sopranos. The beginning was amazing and the ending was pretty good too, but for the hour and a half in the middle, nothing happens, and It was infuriating! We all know what a great actor Brad Pitt can be, especially in this type of role, but his talent is just completely wasted by a Writer who had a beginning, an ending, and no idea in between. Aside from Pitt, the rest of the cast only has brief appearance here and there, except for Scoot McNairy, who you may remember from the awful Science Fiction film, Monster. Since then he's turning up everywhere and I couldn't imagine why, until I saw him here. McNairy plays a good kid, who is caught in the middle, and just wants to survive. He goes through a range of emotions and from side to side as if he were a veteran well beyond his years. What a thrill it must have been for a young actor starting out to show up on the set and be surrounded by the likes of Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, and Ray Liotta! As for the film, the bottom line is this, it has a big cast we all know and love, with a few scenes that will really blow you away, but overall the story is severely lacking in content and just wastes the talent of it's performers.",1412553600,,2223,4.295238095238095
5300578,4,B009AMALBM,"I was surprised at all the negative and mediocre reviews for this film. The book from which it was derived is well thought of and the director had a critical success with his previous outing with Brad Pitt in ""The Assassination of Jesse James."" So I figured I'd better check it out for myself. I'm glad I doubted those reviews.

Here's the scoop. A not so criminal mastermind engineers the take-down of a large-ish local poker game. He hires a couple of guys for the job who are, themselves, not the brightest in the bunch. The heist goes off as planned so the mob hires Brad Pitt to see who pulled it off and give them their due.

I liked this film a lot. From what I remembered of the book this stuck to the plot very closely. What I liked better here was the fact that the voices in the book made it difficult for me to separate one voice from another. Here they were distinct. I also liked the way the story was tied to the very bad time in this country when we teetered over the abyss of economic collapse. This adds a great subtext to the proceedings.

The characters are all written and acted well. Pitt's character was exceptional. He reads a situation well and is as pragmatic and efficient in his dealings. Scoot McNairy and his partner in crime Ben Mendelsohn also make a great pair. Jame Gandolfini is only in a few scenes but steps up to the plate as an over the hill hit man who has issues with booze and women. Ray Liotta is his usual good self. The soundtrack is a bit cock-eyed but lends an odd spin to things. All the other production values are top shelf.

This si a great flick. I was afraid to buy it, but, now that I've seen it, I might just add it to my library.",1412467200,,1685,4.22360248447205

5300623,2,B009AMALBM,"Killing Them Softly
  This is a movie with something for nobody.  We are given some excellent acting by famous people to no good purpose.  Brad Pitt stars in and produced this gritty crime drama.  Pitt plays a mob connected hit man, as does James Gandolfini (The Sopranos) and Ray Liotta another mobster.  All three turn in their best games as we should expect from such fine actors.  But the script by director Andrew Dominik leaves us with no body to cheer for.
 Writer/director Andrew Dominik teamed up with Brad Pitt in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.  We might expect a film with such a long name to fail to catch fire with the viewers and so it was.  The Assassination was a critical success with kudos to many of the actors but lost loads loot for the backers.  Killing Them Softly may squeeze out a profit.  Producer Brad Pitt allowed a budget of only $15 million and it has already brought in $25.5 million.  Huzzah for Hollywood as a money machine.
 But it is just too bad for those of us who went to see this dark, nihilistic, unsatisfying peek into the under belly of the lowest sort of criminal life.  The hero of the piece is Brad Pitt, a killer for hire with no redeeming virtues.  He kills people for money and we have no look at the rest of his life to make us have any sympathy for him whatever.  We don't see him helping old ladies across the street or any such acts to humanize him.  He does have the virtue of being relatively efficient, unlike the character played by James Gandolfini.  His character is also a murderer but an inept one at the end of his career.  Ray Liotta plays a gangster so vile and unpleasant that he robs his own illegal card game.  These are men who are hard to emphasize with.  If they are successful, their success is at the expense of other people, if they fail we care so little about them that we are unmoved by their plight.
 There is a clever side light on the entire outlook of the film.  It is set just four years ago during the last months of the Bush administration.  Frequent TV clips show news footage of the time with then President Bush and now President Obama outlining the desperate economic.  This economic situation also impacts the economy of the underworld.  Even the price of a hit has gone down.  Crooks have their own financial problems.  This hook isn't enough to make a successful movie.  All of these jerks can go broke and die, we just don't care.
 This one and a half saw blade film is rated R.  The R is not for violence (which is gross but within current  norms) or naked people but for relentless, consistent language of the worst kind.  We would expect this kind of talk from junkies, crooks and killers but it seems that every other word is something not repeatable in common conversation.
  I think the idea of the film was to emulate such films as the entertaining and clever Snatch, another Brad Pitt vehicle.  If so they missed the mark by a country mile.",1411776000,,2967,4.417744916820703

5300894,2,B009AMALBM,"It's a shame that this movie just simply could not have been better, but therein lies the problem with people like Brad Pitt -- simplicity and/or subtlety isn't their milieu.

Yes, Pitt has yet again (see the laughably-bad ""World War Z"") fearlessly cast himself in the lead of a film he also produced. Golly, the wonder of it all. Anyway, let's begin with the positives...
Ray Liotta, Vincent Curatola and James Gandolfini still respectively represent presences on the screen to be reckoned with and the script melded very seamlessly with their talents. Being good quality actors, they played their roles extremely well, played to the intricacies of their characters and came-off as more than impressive. On that note, I have no doubt that the original script was quite promising, as you can sense that (at times) not only did the plot itself and character interaction work the way a film is supposed to, but you can also see clearly the grittiness of what was at least intended.

However, no matter how promising a film looks on paper, if the execution of said film is meant to be nothing more than a vanity project for an actor whose range can't go further than a lake pier, you'll get the same results as this film. I'll start with deconstructing Brad ""Hair Flip"" Pitt... who cast himself as a hard-as-a-coffin-nail hitman? Yeah, wow. Growing some peach fuzz on your face, scowling, sauntering into buildings and slicking your hair back with Crisco is not going to convince an audience that you can actually handle yourself in fight, okay Mr. Jolie? Literally, he looked like he had grown a weekend's worth of stubble whilst yachting.

But enough about Mr. Hollywooden Power-lunch. The film at times got caught-up in it's hollow wannabe-artistic aspects. Slowing down the film and making everything blurry to show the point of view of a heroin addict REPEATEDLY during a 5 minute scene makes me wonder if the director just wanted to insure that he had a 95+ minute film. And despite how well Gandolfini played his role, the scripting of his character as a washed-up alcoholic is fine and dandy, but focusing on how many beers/scotches/paint-thinners he can slam during ONE lunch date gets old after a while. And let us not forget the long sequences in which someone is (wait for it)... walking to a destination? Were the makers trying to build suspense? Didn't work. Were the makers trying to show the intricacies of the characters by doing this? Didn't work.

If you can watch this film without paying (like I did), I say go for it. It comes-off like a cheap, generic suit and isn't worth your money. However, paying more than $3 for a rental of it won't be the most shrewd investment you've ever made, either.

There is a deep political message or layer to this movie, there is also a decent character study of different kinds of Americans. Each character represents different type of America.  All these characters, in some way or another resemble the American politics.
This movie perfectly captures different Americas or should I say Americans living their type-of-American-dream.

It is worth mentioning, that some of the scenes, for example like: 1) Brad Pitt assassinating Ray Liotta shot in slow-motion and with an outstanding song ""Love Letters"" playing in the background at night while it is raining is pure genius; 2) And finally, at the end when Brad Pitt gives a terrific speech on American founding fathers, combined with American dream while sitting at a dead bar with Richard Jenkins as the in-between-guy...are both very memorable.

James Gandolfini's character really has nothing to do with the rest of the movie except to give him a chance to drink, curse, and hire hookers.  Ray Liotta comes off the best as the poor slob whose card game is knocked over and who has to be sacrificed to appease the unseen guys who run the show.

5301181,3,B009AMALBM,"A Lot Of People Were Disappointed With This Film
Because It Was  Represented As Something It Wasn't.
They expected a rollicking gangster action-crime thriller
that would rival some of the many others that have gone down
in movie history as great films.
The deceitful movie company marketing teams knew this all the long,
But felt they had to create some sort of hype to get viewers in the theater seats.
People don't like being toyed with...and they bitterly stayed away from it
after the initial opening week revealed the hoax for what it was!

They most definitely had the cast to make this film happen....
But, the producers, writers, & directors opted to take us
in a little different direction; stylistically & flow-wise...
and I think it really threw some people for a loop when
they saw it...and not in a good way!

When I saw this at the theaters, I saw people
actually walking out 30 and 45 minutes into the film;
cursing the screen & wanting their money back!
I stayed until the credits rolled, but felt that it was missing certain elements
that could've made it a great film.

Since then, I've rented it on  Red Box, just to make sure that I wasn't
making a snap judgment about it, just because
it didn't fit the criteria for what I thought it should've been.
In that viewing, plus in further analysis, since it has been
coming on Showtime quite regularly in the last month or so,
has lead me to reassess my initial opinion.

Now hear me out, before you bind me, and burn me alive in the public square at midnight!

Here's what I say about ""Killing Them Softly"" now....
It had potential, but fell short of the mark for a truly great piece of work....
HOWEVER, I contend that this film will have more of an influential impact
in this genre, as well as, on how future gangster-action-thriller films are done.
If you take certain scenes for what they brought cinematically, stylistically & content-wise;
like the brutal beat down of Ray Liotta's crooked con man, Markie, by the two thugs
for running the fixed card game gone awry...Man, that is an amazing scene!
It is so real and evocative of what you may hear thuggish-types in big cities like
NYC, Boston, & Philly, etc., call ""throwing (someone) a beatin' "".
They beat Liotta's character almost until he's begging for death!
(It's gripping to watch!)

Then, there are the ""dirty deeds"" scenes where
Brad Pitt's sleek-shrewd-ice-cold mob hit man, Jackie Coogan, does his thing!

That slo-mo bloody death scene that he and Liotta created is part poetry,
part perverse ballet, and part gore-fest!
I find it to be absolutely one of the most original, riveting & compelling death scenes
that I've seen in a film in a long time!
This is what I mean by its impact will be more influential
to filmmakers who take on this genre in the future.
Then, there was the double bloody shotgun / handgun
double-cross killing scenes that Coogan carries out with the
mater-of-fact aloofness, and clinical sensibilities of a surgeon transplanting a vital organ!

There are a few other great scenes in the film that escape me
right now at this late hour, but like I said earlier, their impact and influence
with reverberate in the future.
I predict that ""Killing Me Softly"" will get its props, 5 to 10 years from now,
when some as-yet-unknown actor and director will create a future masterpiece
in this genre, and reference ""Killing Them Softly"" as a main influence.
Then people will go back a re-discover it, and say ""Ohhh, Okay!""
That my opinion anywayz!
This is an okay film though....not great as it could've been....
but not complete trash either.",1384560000,2,3592,4.6963434022257555

5301189,4,B009AMALBM,"A mob card game is robbed, a wise guy is framed, and a hit man is called to deal with it. I admit, on the surface this doesn't seem too appealing. More of the same, right? Maybe not.

Ray Liotta plays ""Markie,"" a mob-connected wise guy who admitted once to robbing his own high stakes poker game. Everybody likes Markie, so no one turned on him, but tensions are a little high. When someone gets the bright idea to rob another of Markie's card games and frame him for it, it seems like the perfect plan. Nobody really trusts Markie anymore, and they'd obviously think he did it again. Unfortunately, loose lips lead to the truth, and hits are ordered.

Enter Brad Pitt as a ""seen it all"" hit man who likes to ""kill `em softly."" He doesn't like all the blubbering and pleading that contract victims usually throw out. It's too emotional, too messy. He prefers to hit from an emotional distance and let the mark have at least a moment of peace before he takes a life. Will he really kill Markie just to send a message? Will he turn on the young men who were tricked into robbing the card game? Or will he look into his own dark heart and find a shred of humanity and mercy for his intended victims?

The answers are not all obvious, and they are not all correct, no matter how you guess from the very beginning. This is a classic noir film wrapped in a mob movie. Our lead is an anti-hero, but not in the vein becoming popular with shows like ""Breaking Bad"" or ""Boardwalk Empire,"" not that those shows are lacking for good acting and writing. This is an old style anti-hero. One who you can tell is not weighed and worried or fighting his inner darkness, but is truly just ""doing his job"" and has seen so much that his heart may be more stone than human.

Pitt gives a better performance here than we have seen from him since Ocean's 11, but don't mistake that for him playing to that same type. This character is entirely on his own, and no comparison should be drawn to his other roles, as you won't be able to find one. Liotta is vulnerable and sweet, but still slimy enough that you can see why folks would simultaneously forgive and condemn his ""Markie."" Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn as the two rookie thieves are so natural that I could not even tell that they were acting during any scene they were in. Here are two guys that should be given a chance to play a different type in an upcoming feature and see what they can do. The late James Gandolfini's character in this movie is literally a throw-away character in that he has no impact on the story, but honestly I cannot fault the inclusion. His character added a richness and depth to the world the movie takes place in, and he is at the same time so repulsive and so pitiable that you just want to smack him and then immediately give him a hug and say you didn't mean it. He's like a giant child who is lashing out from his pain, but just wants you to hold him and tell him it is all going to be OK.

""Killing Them Softly"" is not for everyone. It is stylized and odd instead of spelling things out for you. It is slow and calculated and has long stretches of dialogue that seemingly go nowhere. It is full of violence, but no ""action."" There are really no characters to like, as they are all dirty, selfish people. It plays out against the 2008 American Presidential elections but makes no social commentary on either political party, instead rather waiting until literally the last minute to say anything about the cynical and harsh views its characters have on the country's condition. All these things, however, work in the movie's favor. If you can just go for the ride and give the movie a chance as a ""story"" rather than a ""moral,"" you will find a return to noir for the modern audience.",1381708800,2,3757,4.353780313837375

5301298,3,B009AMALBM,"Andrew Dominik seems to have taken a page out of David Mamet's playbook with his 2012 crime noir Killing Them Softly. Instead of the action gangster film that everyone was expecting we get a talky film that explores both the psyche of the modern gangster and the crumbling of the American economy and moral values.

When three inept crooks rob a mob controlled card game things begin to go terribly wrong for them. Frankie(Scoot McNairy), Russell(Ben Mendelsohn) and Squirrel(Vincent Curatola)are small time crooks hoping to hit it big by robbing a mob card game run by Markie Trattman(Ray Liotta). This robbery forces retaliation by the mob in the form of an assassin named Jackie Cogan(Brad Pitt). Cogan perfers killing his victims softly (from a distance) without emotion. The film adds as a counterpoint to this story the fall of the American economy and the bheginning of the Obama administration, Dominik attributes this economic downfall to a collapse in a system based on gambling.

The film does some things quite well: the dialogue is crisp and interesting throughout and the characters are well played and quirky enough to keep the viewer's interest. The biggest problem is that this is not an easy movie to follow and the plot moves along very slowly. If viewed as simply a crime thriller it is not thrilling. Dominik relies on his dialogue to explore the inner workings of the modern gangster and the viewer will learn much by carefully listening. In this way the film follows the style of David Mamet pretty closely. Dominik sees everything based on money. America is not a community as Obama states at the end. It has become a business nothing more or less.

The Blu Ray edition presents the film with very few extras. There are four deleted scenes and a very short making of documentary. This film had great promise but it just doesn't live up to its own hype. Definately worth a rental for the dialogue and character development but on the whole nothing very special.",1380499200,,1984,4.846607669616519
5301299,1,B009AMALBM,"So this movie wouldn't be so bad except one of the main characters is so annoying I actually fast forwarded through the parts he was in.
Can't recall his name in the movie, Tommy or something, but he was the robber without the Australian accent.
Now to be fair, he is supposed to be an annoying coward, but this guy took it too far.  At one point he is talking to Brad Pitt's character in the bar, and keeps making these noises like he has cotton mouth. It was at this point I had to start skipping his parts.
Actually, James Gandolfini's character is barely watchable as well.  He plays a whiner that just doesn't shut up.
***Spoiler Alert***
The only reason I think this movie is worth one star is because the ultra annoying character gets shot a lot by Brad Pitt.  This part I rewound...twice.
After that I stooped the movie and returned it.
Normally I do not flame on movies whatsoever.  In fact, I think this is the first time I have ever given a poor movie review.

Update: After reading some other reviews, and learning that the film was supposed to be about the financial crisis, with each character representing different aspects of what happened, it in no way changed my opinion,  This too was done poorly. Subtle to the point of being worthless. Want to see a good movie that makes you think, amd get excited about discovering connections? Watch Cloud Atlas. Much better use of your entertainment time.

5301305,4,B009AMALBM,"Well, I see allot of negative reviews left about Killing them Softly"" by others. It seems to me that many just couldn't get into this film. You have to really ""pay attention"". This isn't your typical mindlessly violent action film or mafia movie. It has dialog, and if you wonder for just a moment, you will miss the bigger picture. This is a film/crime drama that just isn't about an order for a hit going out, it also parallels the 2008 economic crash and how the economy not only greatly affected your average blue and white collar workers, but the criminal world a well.
Enter ""Jackie"" (Brad Pitt), called in to do a favor for a card game that was robbed, and for a second time. The first time they let it slide, but this time the guy running the games ""Markie"" (played by Ray Liotta) is taking the fall along with the two small time guys who did it and ""the Squirrel"" who set things in motion. Jackie is faced with some setbacks. After bringing in Mickey (played by the late/great James Gandolfini), who is all but ""washed up in alcohol, hookers and a pending jail sentence e), a price is negotiated and the hits are done.
As I was saying, this isn't just a film about the mob, more so it is a film of characters interweaved with the criminal underworld and how the economic crisis affected them and getting things done. The long interludes between Jackie and Mickey are amusing, even if they seem out of place, they drive the plot just as assuredly as did the poker game heist and the 2008 presidential campaign and economic crash that was ever prevalent in the background. Brief, unglorified moments of violence are all that is to be seen here. The true focus is the story and dialog between the characters itself. If you can't handle that and all you want is non-stop, brainless one-liners and grade school dialog, you'd be better off watching a Michael Bay movie",1379462400,,1871,4.522123893805309

The film shares a similar mood to Jackie Brown with it's insightful dialogue and it's quasi- retro appeal. Also it sports a great ensemble cast which the screenplay does not let go to waste. Although Brad Pitt is the marquee name associated with the movie he is merely given a complimentary role. The unsung actors are actually the central focus of this film and they turn in terrific performances. The film builds slowly, lunges at you, then regains it's composure. This awkward pacing is offset by exceptional character development and attention to detail. THE VIOLENCE IN THIS MOVIE IS THE MOST GRAPHICALLY DEPICTED OF ANY MAIN STREAM RELEASE THAT I CAN REMEMBER. While it appears  only briefly, it's impact is like a sledge hammer and is accentuated by a splendid combination of music, startling sound fx, slow motion and extreme close-ups which makes it nearly impossible for the viewer to dismiss. If you like this subject matter then i can wholeheartedly recommend this movie. If you are just a fan of Pitt  or Gandolfini then do not buy this movie as they both have lesser roles, albeit, important ones.",1377388800,,1196,4.857843137254902

I noticed other reviews defending the movie by claiming it is a metaphor about America's economic condition. Whether that's true or not, this is a slog of a film, excruciatingly slow in pace and sparse in originality.

The hard-boiled, noir-type title sends you exactly the wrong signals about the viewing experience that follows, if it makes you think of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe.

5301817,5,B009AMALBM,"I'm not sure if it's the Brad Pitt connection that's drawing in so many negative reviews - ie a very popular actor bringing an audience to a very non-mainstream movie...but anyway, this is hands down a great movie.

First, director Andrew Dominick was responsible for ""Chopper"" with Eric Bana and ""The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford"" - both of which are truly excellent films.  These aren't action movies.  They're not light viewing.  They go at their own pace.

Killing them softly is a very simple story about the repurcussions of a card game heist by a couple of low level street criminals.  There's not a lot of hand-holding or exposition, things are discussed and not clearly explained at times, it's really just a quick snapshot of come cause and effect in the criminal underworld.  It's not about a complex plot or happy endings.

Not a lot of action, but some great performances and overall excellent mood setting and atmosphere.  The guys who pull the heist have nothing and come from nothing, they have nothing to lose and are put up to it by someone who's obviously overreaching, thinking he's out of harm's way.

Anyway - this is more of a mood piece, more cerebral, more of a slow burn.  Brad Pitt is excellent as usual, as is everyone else.  I think the best performance is by Scoot McNairy - who I also enjoyed in Monsters.  He's a really promising young actor, and his character is absolutely heartbreaking.

I don't understand all the hate for this film.  I think it's absolutely great.  If my description appeals to you at all, or if you enjoyed Dominicks previous films I think you'll like this.",1375833600,,1638,4.6947368421052635

Pretty cool how a three day story seems to span three decades from Reagan to Bush to Obama, always with the televised political backdrop to accentuate the dreary street plot moment to moment  They did the same thing with the set cars. You could even smell the characters they look so bad. I thought it hilarious every time you turn a corner and a new people problem pops up, this went on start to finish making you wonder how anything gets done on this planet. Everyone always turns out to be a day or two past their prime and in the middle of it all is Brad Pitt, the consummate professional coolly making it all work even if it got real ugly. Classic.

The film is an adaption of a great crime novel that is mostly dialogue and conversation.  I thought that Dominik did a GREAT job in being faithful to book, and many of the classic lines from the novel are uttered to perfection.

Think Boondock Saints without personality, The Way of the Gun without a plot, Sopranos acted out by mimes... now you're gettin' it.

I saw this in the dollar theatre, locally, and wanted my money back plus compensation for my time. The ticket seller tried to warn me, but OH NO, I'm too smart for him!  In the theatre, a bandana'd gangsta-wannabee snored through the last hour. Feet up on the chair in front of him, head back, chainsaw-workin'. He's the only one who got his money's worth out of this waste of heavy-handed, ideological, plotless paean to Pitt.

1) Brad Pitt is awful. When he plays a girl's role, he does fine (sit there, look pretty, don't talk or think). But in this he's terrible. He tries to be part-Riggs, part-Parker, and all tough guy. But he's an underwear model and comes off like an underwear model posing tough. It makes you wince.

2) Gandolfini seems to be playing his part from the Mexican only ten years later. Who's surprised he died after seeing him in this? We watch him die on screen. Pathetic. Like an old, fat, slovenly flamingly gay Brando. Yeah: he's acting... sure. It's like a train wreck full of orphans. You can't help watch him but you also can't fight the urge to call Sally Struthers and give a dime-a-day to the poor fly-eyed glutton. I wondered whether the director was doing this to blackmail Gandolfini or embarrass him. It's sad. But... that's also the movie's theme (yay?)

3) The movie's only 45 minutes long. The other hour and 15 min is replays of Obama's election speeches. Our hero sits in a bar and listens to Obama. Our hero sits in a hotel... listening to Obama. In his car, listening to Obama. You can't escape it.  Even if you love(d) Obama, you're far behind this director's admiration, idol worship and sheer adoration of his Obama-love(tm).

I know: it's a parable about the economy. Maybe. But it a) ain't art and b) ain't good.

Don't tell me it's subtle and expect me not to think you're the guy who can discern a ""hint of cashew"" in a cow patty.

Why should you watch this?

Well... I suppose if you're one of the Pitt/Jolie brood and ""Dad"" offers to double your allowance...

Higgins is set in Boston. I know Pitt is a NOLA booster, but really, let's get real. Those houses are sooo NOLA. And, hey, David Lynch beat you in using Ketty Lester's 'Love Letters' by some 26 years in another crucial, gruesome scene in 'Blue Velvet.' This movie is strangely compelling somehow, despite its pretentious moments (and there are more than a few).

More an examination of the American Dream than a shoot-em-up. Brad Pitt's character is taut and unflinching (haven't seen ""World War Z"" but I have a zombie-related hunch he's betting in ""Killing Them""). The performances by Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn (the latter the most fascinatingly repulsive character I've seen lately) make you forget you're watching a movie. James Gandolfini's pushes the limit of his cameo; in light of recent events, it's a bit haunting too.

5302815,4,B009AMALBM,"Killing Them Softly (2012)

Killing Them Softly is a slow-burn crime drama and political metaphor; it is not an action movie. I don't recall any of the filmmakers promising an ""action-filled extravaganza"" or an ""orgy of violence"", or any of the other marketing terms one sees on movies these days. Whenever violence happens in a movie like this, it MEANS something, which is the way it should be. Also, I do prefer movies that tell me only what I as a viewer need to know, not films that spoon-feed me every little detail. Whatever's not on the page can be conveyed through the performances of the actors, if they're good enough, and guys like Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini (who is flat out terrific here, R.I.P.), Ray Liotta and Richard Jenkins are DEFINITELY good enough. As for all the political rhetoric, I feel like it was a bit clunky and a little off-putting. I wish Dominik had dialed it down a little bit, because it got repetitive at one point (and not to stereotype, but are a bunch of street-level mob guys and hustlers going to be keeping such close tabs on financial news anyway, to the point where they have their radios tuned to news radio and their TVs tuned to C-SPAN?). Still, I like a film that has some ambition and errs on the side of trying too hard to make the audience think, rather than not at all.

And for the people down below here who complained about having to listen to Obama's speeches, get a life. The point they're making is that the whole system was flawed. They're not lifting Obama up to be a hero; if anything, they're underlining the fact that, after all the flowery speeches and the glowing campaign, it's going to more of the same-old-same-old whoever takes the election. The movies denies whatever pandering ""we're-in-this-together"" swill Bush and Obama are slinging and sides with Brad Pitt's pragmatic character, who knows that these days, America is every man for himself. It would be a shame to deny yourself a good movie just because of some imagined political affiliation you have that, with each year, has less and less of a distinction anyway.

Of course, if you don't like to actually think, I understand there's a new Transformers movie coming soon, so... enjoy that.

The few action scenes were done in slow motion and I actually laughed a couple of times at the extended slow motion sequences. Very contrived. Reminded me of a two hour sopranos episode.

This is not the typical Hollywood movie with tons of action and sex which is made, or rather influenced heavily by businessmen whose goals usually are to get the most out of our hard-earned money. But rather it is made by artists and story-tellers who care deeply about the material and work hard to tell a deep, gritty, realistic story. This is a movie that really makes you think about it's unique themes which are rarely explored by filmmakers nowadays. And the few action sequences at times make you cringe.

I take a film for what it intends to be, not what I want it to be or thought it should be. ""Killing Them Softly"" is a brilliant film, easily one of the best films I've seen in years. Like many have already pointed out it's a parable, and is almost an anti-gangster picture. The dialogue, acting and direction is executed perfectly. The politics might be a little heavy handed at times, and the film might be a tad over-stylized in parts, but it's far better than 99.9% of the pictures released each year that purposefully cater to the average movie goer. There is nothing wrong with being an average movie goer, but I believe many people were a bit misled into thinking this film was an action gangster pic ala ""Gangster Squad."" But instead of brainless action sequences and a forced romance they received something much deeper, and to their dismay it seems. There is a lot dialogue and little action, but what's there is effective and meticulously crafted. The ending doesn't tie every thing together perfectly with a little ribbon on top, but rather asks questions and makes valid points on our government and capitalist culture.

Get outta here!) with the promise of fast action sequences only to be bogged down by lots and lots of talking.  And Obama speeches in the background.  What?  What is this movie trying to be?  And yes, there are action sequences, but they are heavy and bogged down by slow motion camera work.  And frankly, by the time the killing started, I was bored.

I was wrong, as Pitt doesn't show up until half way through the movie, and the build up is boring and predictable. This is just a bad drama, not an action movie, just a mobster drama, without the fun parts. In this way it is a realistic look (I guess?), and tries to give make a political analogy to the way the government is run. It does have good actors but they are under utilized.

This is NOT a shoot 'em up, however, but rather a character-driven slice of life in the slow lane of an underworld where even the middle managers live in some pretty seedy digs. (Oh, and it's also a parable for the financial crisis of 2008!)

Very well acted and beautifully shot, the only discordant vibe is the fact that the original story was set in Boston - so there are references to New England towns - but the movie was filmed in New Orleans. An odd choice, but not one that will distract most.

Though I have to say.. the reference is very clearly there.  Besides being spelled out for you in the special features, in every background tv that was on and radio broadcast in the movie the subject matter is from circa the 2008 crisis.

Perhaps the trailer was misleading.  It's definitely not a full on action movie.

It's boring. It's full of excellent actors. And they have mostly unlikable characters. Other than Pitt, who I have like for no reason in nearly every role, the great actors don't make this film.

And it's filled with irritating artsy over compensations from the first second. The opening trailers keep cutting between a song and some crappy political speak from Bush or Obama. A shooting sequence goes to slow motion to show raindrops on the slide of a semi-auto, the shell casings ejecting into the rain, the glass breaking and the victim jerking with blood splatters, and so on. As this happened, I groaned out loud with how BORING it was. The dialogue is crap. Maybe someone wrote it having never been around killers or thieves. Or maybe it was just written during a heroin binge. But it wasn't the kind of conversation that adults would have.

There is no way to explain how boring this is. I couldn't get through it to the end, and I have watched some crappy movies all the way through. I came in looking for the movie that the trailer advertised, and this wasn't it. Shame on Weinstein for cutting it to show that. But, if you just want to hear lots of pieces of Obama and Bush circa 2008 heavy-handedly shoved down your throat while the most miserable creatures scratch out their crappy existence on the crust of the planet, watch this film.

5303375,3,B009AMALBM,"Brad Pitt plays Jackie Cogan, a contract killer hired to set things right when not-so-smart robbers took money from a mobster-run poker game. Based on a book ""Cogan's Trade"" by George V. Higgins, original writer of Peter Yates-directed ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle,"" ""Killing Them Softly"" has great 1970-ish visual style, and features solid performances from the impressive cast including Vincent Curatola, James Gandolfini, Richard Jenkins, Ray Liotta, Scoot McNairy, Ben Mendelsohn and Sam Shepard.

For all its technical excellence, however, the film seems caught up in details too much, forgetting that not all audiences would share the same interest as the director. Andrew Dominik, known for ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,"" often lets the dialogue go on and on. Some would love the film for its long conversations - especially those between Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini's characters, while others would hate it for the philosophizing.

The bad economy affects even mobsters. One of the most interesting aspects of ""Killing Them Softly"" is something economic and political, best represented by a few lines of the embittered killer Jackie Cogan in the final bar scene. Again, while some would find this aspect of the film fascinating, others think it muddled and unfocused, or worse, pretentious.

5303378,5,B009AMALBM,"The amount of negative reviews for Killing Them Softly is truly puzzling. I thought the film was brilliant, and as an admirer of director Andrew Dominik, I was very pleased with it. A crime picture that is wholly unique, expertly edited, and serenely imagined. I can understand why so many people may have had problems with the film, it is slow moving and decidedly difficult and different. I have never seen anything quite like it, and maybe that's why so many people had a hard time with it, because its not like anything they have ever seen before.

Since no one seems to be saying the obvious, I guess that I have to be the one who's brave enough to finally put it out there... Killing Them Softly is easily one of the best films of 2012 and one of the best crime films to come along in the last decade! Andrew Dominik proved his worth, and in my eyes, his worth as a filmmaker is limitless because of this film.

A simply genius piece. Not necessarily misunderstood, the negative reviewers seemed to 'get it', but they all seem to be a very stubborn and spoiled lot. Killing Them Softly is one of the best things to come out in years, and I feel like I'm the only one who realizes it.

I thought everything was absolutely perfect about it! The acting was incredible! Brad Pitt, Ray Liotta, and James Gandolfini are outstanding in it! I loved the characters! I loved the story! I loved the cinematography! I loved the way it made me feel and think! I loved Killing Them Softly! Juxtaposing the modern economical enterprise with that of the criminal element's adoption of monopoly is something I found fascinating to explore in the context of the piece.

5303448,2,B009AMALBM,"Even if it were content to be a gritty tough-guy crime thriller, ""Killing Them Softly"" would still be a bit much. There's one too many slow motion close-up of a pistol's firing pin and corny drug-trip lens flashes to signify that characters are getting high. A couple scenes with James Gandolfini as an alcoholic hit man that should have crackled drag on like improv exercises. Characters take heroin while the Velvet Underground's ""Heroin"" plays on the soundtrack. Still, for the most part the movie delivers the goods. There are tough guys mixing violence with comically obscene chit-chat. There is a crime that couldn't possibly go wrong that of course goes horribly wrong. There is one brilliant heist set-piece that makes the audience sweat on behalf of stick-up men who are in way over their heads. The cinematography revels in the sleaze of a sickly looking, trash-strewn urban cesspool, and you get to say to yourself, ""Hey, there's Ray Liotta."" There's nothing wrong with being a B movie, and ""Killing Them Softly"" is maybe a B-.

The problem is that it wants to be more. And the more it specifically wants to be is an unblinking look at the dark side of the American dream. ""Killing them Softly"" does this by setting the action in 2008 and filling the background with news clips of Bush and Obama campaigning and holding forth on the Wall Street bailouts. There are no similarities between the national events and the ones on screen besides the fact that both involve money and public perception, like much of human life. (If this movie had actually gone down like the 2008 bailouts, the mob would have showered the guys who knocked off their poker game with cash.) Had ""Killing them Softly"" retained the 1970s setting of the novel it's based on, we would have heard Carter and Ford in the background, prattling on about stagflation, and it would have seemed equally arbitrary. The deeper message ends up a limp, generic: Republicans, Democrats--they're all crooks. As political commentary, this is slightly less incisive than Mark Russell. Then, not content to let its lousy parts exist solely in the background, ""Killing Them Softly"" closes with a monologue from Brad Pitt's hitman character in which he says in pretty much so many words, America, it's just as corrupt as the events you've witnessed here, dear viewer. And right there, inches away from the finish line, you watch the movie die.",1368921600,,2406,4.882640586797066
5303529,5,B009AMALBM,"When I watched the trailer for this movie, I took it for a good old-fashioned syndicate crime movie; i.e.: A couple up-and-comers make a mistake, and Pitt comes in and cleans house. That's what the trailer makes us think. But, that's not entirely what the movie is about, and anyone who is expecting an action-packed crime drama will be gravely disappointed. That's the con of the movie - that it doesn't deliver what we see in the trailer. But, if a viewer can keep an open mind, this film is awesome, and it's truly a cinematic triumph.

Simply-put, this film represents recession-era American crime syndicates; how the recession affected the syndicates. Although it's Hollywood, it's still fairly accurate. Is it slow at times? Yes. But, that just makes it more realistic; the criminal underworld isn't as fast-paced as outsiders imagine. It's also brutal, extremely graphic and occasionally hilarious. When Gandolfini's character was introduced, I laughed hysterically for a good three minutes, and that was enough for me to love this movie. It's pure genius.

Was there a political statement? Kinda. But, it adds to the story line. In 2008, America's economy tanked. When the public has less money, the syndicates have less money, and this was very well portrayed in this film. Add to that life crises, stress, burnout, alcoholism, marital problems, drug abuse and other every-day phenomena, and we're given an accurate expression of what it's like to be a wiseguy in what is literally a dead-end job during The Great Recession.

But, like I said, if all you want is a crime-action-shooter, you'll be disappointed, and I'm guessing that's why many people apparently dislike this film.

This is my new #1 movie of all time. Very plainly, it was beautiful, and I applaud Dominik and Pitt for their tremendous contributions ... and Gandolfini was an ""Absolut"" riot. Bravo!",1368835200,4,1874,5.035483870967742
5303530,2,B009AMALBM,Pretty boring. Found myself fast forwarding most of the picture. too drawn out and Brad Pitt was basically a bit player in the whole movie.,1368748800,,139,4.6
5303531,3,B009AMALBM,"""Killing Them Softly"" was adapted by director Andrew Dominik from the 1974 novel ""Cogan's Trade"" by George V. Higgins. In an unnamed American city, struggling businessman Johnny ""Squirrel"" Amato (Vincent Curatola) hires two ex-cons, Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn), to knock over an underground poker game. He assumes that Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta), who runs the game, will be blamed, as he has a history of robbing games. After the clumsy robbery comes off, mob boss Dillon brings in Jackie (Brad Pitt), an enforcer from out of town, to kill the culprits and restore order. But Jackie is savvy enough to understand that Markie, though publicly culpable, had nothing to do with the robbery and to figure out who did.

George V. Higgins began writing noir crime novels in the 1970s under a cloud of malaise occasioned by stagflation, Watergate, high crime rates, and a feeling of social decay peculiar to that decade. Andrew Dominik moved the action to 2008, in the midst of a global financial crisis and US presidential election campaigns, to capitalize on the basic economic nature of the story. Frankie and Russell's robbery has upset the underworld economy. One party stole money from another in order to fulfill its plans, leaving the other in crisis, and Jackie just wants to get paid. Though I can understand why Dominik would choose to adapt this novel at this time, it is not as successful as ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle"" (1973), which was adapted from Higgins' 1970 novel of the same name.

Though the film is visually arresting, it maintains a distance from the characters that prevents the audience from identifying with their emotions. They are simply spectacle. The story is told primarily though a series of conversations -conversations between Frankie and Russell, which are hilarious, between Frankie and Squirrel, between Jackie and his liaison (Richard Jenkins) with Dillon, between Jackie and a washed-up out-of-town hitman Mickey (James Gandolfini). The conversations are mundane and naturalistic, as if Quentin Tarantino had taken a shot of realism. But they are not affecting. There is no way to connect with the characters, a problem that plagued Dominik's earlier film ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" (2007) as well.

Without the ability to see anything from the characters' point of view, they have no impact. The socio-political threads that run through the film are heavy-handed, which tends to undermine any attempt at a theme. In Peter Yates' adaptation of ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle"", the malaise came through without anyone mentioning stagflation or politics. In contrast, Dominik has television and radio commentary on the financial crisis and election campaign running in the background of ""Killing Them Softly"". If you have to state your ideas repeatedly in order for them to be understood, your film is not working. There is a lot to like in ""Killing Them Softly"". The cast is great, as is the dark humor, and cinematography by Grieg Fraser is memorable. But its distance results in superficiality.

The DVD (Anchor Bay 2013): Bonus features are 4 deleted scenes and a featurette entitled ""The Making of Killing Them Softly"" (5 min), which includes interviews with Andrew Dominik, in which he explains the ideas behind the film and talks about the actors, and interviews with the cast.

5303729,3,B009AMALBM,"I'm very glad I read a giant lot of bad reviews because I was expecting it to be bad, but surprisingly it wasn't bad at all. Certainly it was slow moving, and the political messages popping up here and there seemed pointless, as if they were trying to come up with something to say to make the less than interesting script more interesting. All it did was annoy me though. I wondered what the point was. However the good news is that there is a lot to like about this film. It's made in a more traditional manner, like the slow moving crime stories of the 70's were made.

The dialogue is interesting sometimes, especially the segments that included James Gandolfini's character. His acting is as always- superb, and though he's talking about every day subjects like the endless hookers he's slept with, the interesting thing is how well he ponders the subject and reflects upon it. In reality his performance is the most memorable thing about this film. Let's be clear though, this is not an action picture, it's more about mood and atmosphere. It's about taking time to get the audience sitting tight with their seatbelts firmly fastened wondering what is going to happen next. It comes off feeling more like reality. Like the way life really is. Bad men who commit murder discussing their every day lives.

Brad Pitt's character is probably the least interesting thing about this movie. He's playing this guy like the kind of emotionless bad guys we've seen a hundred times in movies. The issue is though that he's simply doing it by the numbers, he's playing it rather bluntly and not with any particular conviction. He's just doing a simple acting job. It's a simple roll, played well enough but it's simply not that interesting of a character or that noteworthy of a performance.

Anyway when there is violence it's not dissapointing. it's rude, brash and unforgiving, just as life can often be. My only gripe is that it takes so much time for the plot to thicken that by the time you start to feel like the movie is paying off it simply ends. It felt too short and abrupt. I didn't like the ending or the manner in which Pitt's character get's political on American immorality in politics, then follows that with a simple ""Ef you, Pay Me!!""

The movie has some shining moments but the pay off is not all you hope it will be. It left me wanting more. Wanting more to happen, more character development, more insights into the the crimes and the people who committed them. More a The good news is that there are some brilliant moments in this film, but on the other hand I felt like I had just seen a generally average picture by the time it was over. Not anywhere near as bad as so many reviews led me to believe. Just not a fantastic experience, but I did like it.",1368057600,,2771,4.536

Brad Pitt gives a highly disciplined performance as a hit man brought in to restore order in the Boston criminal underworld after the power balance has been upset by a couple of kids robbing a protected poker game.

The movie honours Higgins' style of driving the plot forward through electric dialogue. In essence this movie is about a series of business meetings, except the business under discussion is the organisation and execution of crime and murder. The parallels between the unvarnished capitalism of crime and the hollowness of the American dream is skillfully, though perhaps a trifle heavy-handedly, drawn.

It is a brutal portrayal of violence, but with little gratuitous gore, and no sympathetic characters. It has no epic pretensions but is an almost perfect miniaturist masterpiece.",1367539200,,893,5.2377622377622375

It is a return to the ""good old days"" where the ONLY roles a brown or dark-skinned pretty black female was relegated to that of being a shameless tramp. It seems Hollywood is back to its old racist tricks of demonizing and degrading black females.

5303928,4,B009AMALBM,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

Wow. This has to be the third or fourth movie in a row that was completely different than what I anticipated. Then again I'm not sure what I was expecting since I knew very little information going in. Which is making it hard for me to come up with a solid introduction to this review so I'll just jump right into it.

Now if I would try to summarize the plot it would be a spoiler fest because this movie moves at a very fast pace and gives the viewer little to no breathing room (I'll get into that later). A few years ago a man by the name of Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta) decided to pay a couple of guys to rob his own poker game in an attempt to get a little extra money. When questioned (or should I say beaten in his own house) if he was involved, he denied it. Then when the games started back up he admitted it to a different group of guys that weren't there that night. That's where our first three characters come in.

Johnny ""Squirrel"" Amatto (Vince Curatola) decides to hire two men, Frankie (Scoot McNairy) & Russell (Ben Mendelsohn), to rob Markie's next poker game. The way he sees it all fingers will point directly to Markie since he did it before and everyone involved would get off scot-free. Well he was partially right as Driver (Richard Jenkins) hires a hitman by the name of Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) to help take care of the problem. The only difference is Jackie knows Markie wasn't involved because, let's face it, no one is that stupid. However, he still feels that he needs to be taken out to prove a point. So his job is to find out who is responsible and to make them pay.

I'll leave it at that so as not to give the entire thing away, but this is essentially a pure crime film from start to finish. I'm not one to watch mob films, but I found this one to be enjoyable. There was a solid list of interesting characters, there was a strong script, and there was a great cast. That doesn't mean that the movie is without its flaws though. As I mentioned before the film doesn't give you a lot of breathing room so, for me, Killing Them Softly's biggest downfall is its pacing. There's a pretty extensive list of characters (some of which only appear once or twice) so it could be difficult to follow along at first as you jump from scene to scene.

Which brings me to my next point, the character development in this film is atrocious. We know absolutely nothing about these characters other than their names. With Mickey (James Gandolfini) being the only exception, but that's because he never shuts up. I understand that this is normal for movies like this to focus on the here and now and less on the past unless it relates to the overall story, but it makes all the characters feel like empty shells. The only character I felt for was Frankie, but even then it wasn't anything more than pity.

With that said I think the cast more than makes up for the rough patches that can be found here. The way I see it the directors wanted the general audience to believe that Jackie is the main character, but I had a hard time believing that when 1) He doesn't come in until about 25 minutes into the movie and 2) In comparison with the rest of the cast he doesn't seem all that important. His role is essential to the story, but his character isn't (if that makes any sense). Everyone feels kind of balanced which maybe adds to the feeling that something just feels off. With that said, no matter who the main character is supposed to be it's no exaggeration when I say that everyone involved did a phenomenal job. Usually you have that one person who underperforms, but, in my opinion, they all delivered.

Overall Score: 7.5/10 - Killing Them Softly is one of those rare instances where I felt conflicted with how I felt about the overall experience  It's not a bad film, but at the same time I don't feel like it truly went anywhere. As I said before what really kept me watching was how well-rounded the cast was and how well everyone performed. If you were to ask me this won't go down as one of the most beloved films ever created, but I can see it creating a strong cult following. If you're a fan of crime films or you just have an hour and a half to kill I would say give it a shot. It's probably not for your average Joe who likes a crazy amount of CGI and special effects, but I think film lovers will be able to find something worthwhile in the experience.",1367193600,,4443,4.312574850299401

5304011,5,B009AMALBM,"Like many who have reviewed this film, I am a fan of gangster movies, and I am truly a fan of film makers who understand the genre, yet are unafraid to stretch the limits of viewers' expectations.  I think Andrew Dominik does this with Killing Them Softly.  Most of the negative reviews might have been positive if the viewers had been familiar with Higgins' novel Cogan's Trade.  Higgins' command of dialogue is the highlight of his writing, maybe more important than the story itself.  It translates really well into this script, and if you're a fan of well-written conversation, Killing Them Softly works.  Dominik overlays Higgins' plot with the political scene from 2008, and this really fit.  Like it or not, Dominik and Higgins say, money is at the core of just about everything, whether it be politics or a mob hit.  As good as the book is, and I think it's great, the movie stands on its own as a great gangster story.  All actors are doing wonderful work here, and each scene is a gem.  If you want a movie-going experience that is scene after scene of superb acting from each player with dialogue that snaps, this is it.  Don't bring the kids.  Mom might not like it, either, even if it does have Brad Pitt.  In contrast to the title, Killing Them Softly is a mean story about hard men doing bad things.  Adjust your expectations--you been warned.",1367020800,,1358,4.5850622406639
5304012,5,B009AMALBM,"This is the third major movie from Andrew Dominik. If you were upset that 'the assassination of jessie james by the coward robert ford' wasent another Butch Cassidy. Then you will certainly not like Killing them softly it is nothing like Goodfellas. If you go in with that then I think you will be surprised. That's what makes this move great.
It's a spin on the gangster movie genre. The story dosent seem very original, but that does not distract. Some stories you can hear over and over again.
It is basically a short story stretched into a movie. This is not a bad thing.
Guy's rob mob, mob finds guy's, mob takes care of them. The story takes place right before Obamas election so there is a lot of talk about the economy, trust in our system and some other analogies going on.
Keep in mind Andrew Dominik is the director. A director can do wonders. I think he does just that. So strange the ratings are not higher, then again this is not your typical wise guy movie.",1367020800,,972,4.405555555555556

It has style (thanks to some sharp shots and slick cinematography) and it carries a poignant theme (that has a tendency to oversell itself at times), but this is a complete actors piece, and as an ensemble this is one of the best of the year.

The film opens with a small time hood getting propositioned to rip off a Mob protected card game.  With a failsafe plan (or so he thinks) he steals the money with a loose tongued addict and winds up being hunted by Jackie Cogan, an enforcer hired to take out the problem and restore order to the games.  Cogan is sharp and takes note of the details, setting up all the right moves with his buddy Mickey (Gandolfini in top notch perfection).  As the walls come crashing in, the small time crooks find themselves in a state of panic, and once Cogan sets his sights on them it's all over.

`Killing Them Softly' had the chance to be perfect.  From a purely thematic standpoint, it's pretty impressive.  The point made about the economy and the state of America as a whole (greedy and selfish) is a very important one, but Dominik really needed to pull in the reigns a tad.  The constant vocal overlay that thrusts political viewpoints in our ears like some sort of subconscious manipulation was just too much.  All of that stripped out and the mere conversations (so rich) to fall back on and this film would have been EVERYTHING.  The closing statement, Pitt's words, have so much meaning and carry so much weight and yet they are dampened because of the fact that the film has already lead us to believe those words so many times before.  Take out all the unnecessary news clips and you would have had one of the best films of 2012.

Still, this is a great film and one that should be seen.  Like I said, one of the best ensembles of the year.  Pitt, Gandolfini, Jenkins and McNairy are spot on perfection here, adding so much depth to their characters and taking this film so far.",1365984000,,2175,4.541025641025641

How many different misogynistic rants do we have to put up with here?  At least 5 times we hear characters degrading women as they discuss  their latest sexcapades in disgusting detail.

It has a very interesting concept in that it consists of two stories going on at once.  One story is about the bread and butter lives of small-time crooks who have had to adjust their way of life to coincide with the big-time crooks in our banking system and in our government.  The entire movie has a running commentary on the economic crisis going on simultaneously as a backdrop to the story plot.  Actually, I think it's an ingenious idea and I just love the speech the Brad Pit gives at the end of this movie, which pretty much encapsulates the reality of our situation in America.  I don't think one viewing is enough to catch all the undercurrents of this movie.  It's not slow; it's complex and multifaceted.",1365638400,2,865,4.584415584415584
5304714,3,B009AMALBM,It makes you think it's going to be a lot of action killing and wondering what the title means. This is a movie you need to be reading between the lines. There is a lot going on in the background that is there for a reason it has a much larger scale meaning then what you would think if you only pay attention to what the actors are doing. Although the actors are playing a part about an individual situation and to what lengths these people will go the reality is each actor is playing a group in our society. You really need to pay attention to the political undertones and how that is connected to what the actors are doing. I'm only giving it 3 stars because I didn't think that point was made early enough in the movie. I felt I was wrapped up in the individuals lives before I realized that there was a larger picture or meaning behind it. I enjoy movies where I need to think about what is going on this one just didn't grab me soon enough.

I did not find any of these characters attractive, not in to be around, just grim and deadly. Brad Pitt plays a hitman, come to town to take care of three characters who mussed up the works. A poker game was hit and the minions who pulled the job need to be taken care of. Marie Trattman played by Ray Liotta is a man with a big problem. Richard Jenkins plays the driver, some sort of middle man who makes the deals. He hires Pitt and James Gandolfini as the hitman to make the mark. Gandolfini is havering relationship problems and is so depressed,he is drinking himself into a mess. Action needs to occur and Pitt is there to make sure it does.

The message of this film appears to be two fold. One: America is a business, just like the Mob. Two: the Mob and Politics are sometimes one and the same. When there is a financial Depression, the Mob suffers as much as the country. Make if this what you will. Superb acting by all. Plenty of blood and violence for all looking for this sort of thing.

5304899,4,B009AMALBM,"I almost didn't watch this movie because of the generally poor reviews. Thankfully I ignored them and was able to enjoy a refreshingly new take on the gangster drama. Before I get into the review I should also add that I rarely write reviews for Amazon, but felt obligated because so many people misjudged this movie and gave it a completely erroneous review and rating. Now let's get to it!

First off, I found this movie to be exhilarating. I watched this at home on a small screen, and I was still constantly on edge, tense, with elevated heart rate. The reason for this is because the movie is in my opinion so real. It gives the gritty, down and dirty real world representation of the criminal lifestyle without all the bells and whistles/faux glamor that most Hollywood movies in this genre have. We don't admire these characters, and honestly we shouldn't. They are losers, degenerates, addicts, gamblers, alcoholics, and murderers. We know it, and what's more the characters themselves know it. They aren't ""cool"" or ""likeable"". They are real. And that's one thing that makes this movie so good.

Second, the exchange of words between characters is astoundingly great and often filled with hilarious vulgarity. If you got offended, you HAVE to know going into this movie that people talk this way, especially characters of this caliber. To be bothered by things that were said in this film is to not go into it with an open mind. And in no way was the dialogue boring as many reviewers have said. I felt that it was constantly enriching the story, creating fuller characters, and backing the major themes of this film along the way, all while doing so in a real way and with accurate representation of how people talk in the real world.

This brings me to my last major point of this review. Anyone who saw this movie as having a political agenda clearly missed the entire point of all the sound bites and video clips dispersed throughout. If you pay attention you will notice that all of those clips are united under one major theme: money. This film boils down to that one thing. It's what everyone wants and strives for in Killing Them Softly. From the opening shot to the cut to black, everyone just wants to get paid. Some do, some don't, and some pay for it with their lives. If you don't see that this movie is really about American greed and the idea of trying to make a quick buck, whether it be from selling drugs, playing cards, robbing people or even murdering them, than you completely missed it. This movie is about everyone feeling the financial pinch of our floundering economy, even those in the criminal world. Please watch this movie, and do it with an open mind. I assure you that you won't be disappointed. I sure wasn't.",1365292800,,2750,4.631147540983607

Everything worked for me in this movie: great casting, great art direction, music, script and direction.

5304905,3,B009AMALBM,"'Next he is going to say that we are one people', says Brad Pitt's character Jack Cogan while Obama's first acceptance speech is on TV. 'Don't make me laugh. We are a business, not a country'.
This happens at the end of the film. Cogan meets the representative of his customers in a bar to collect his fee for 3 killings. That's Cogan's business, he is a hitman with style and intellect. The customer tries to haggle over the price...

This is more like a stage play than a gangster movie. It is highly political. From the beginning to the end we always have Bush or Paulson or McCain or Obama talk on TV or car radio or just in the background. It is the time of the 2008 financial crisis.
The location is New Orleans, but you wouldn't know from the settings. We are mostly in ugly public places, like under road bridges or in rundown bars or apartments or cars.
Cogan is hired to set an example after two young robbers have taken out an illegal gambling den. The film is in parts extremely brutal, but mostly it is very very slow. Most of it is talk.

5304972,4,B009AMALBM,"Firmly rooted in the recession of 2008, KILLING THEM SOFTLY is far from the action film it was unfortunately promoted as.  In fact, it's main attraction, Brad Pitt, doesn't even enter the picture until about 30 minutes, and isn't a key player until nearer the end.  It's not even a gangster film in the traditional style--the epic rise and fall of some ne'er-do-well.  It's an intensely intimate tale of two criminal idiots who get in over their heads, causing other people to take the fall for their crimes.  And it's about the people who come in and clean up the mess, all because these days, you gotta do what you gotta do to get a buck.

Writer/director Andrew Dominik brings to SOFTLY the same slow-burning intensity he gave to THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD; but, being half that film's length, SOFTLY comes off as far more intense.  One scene in particular, where Ray Liotta's unfortunate Markie takes a beating, is especially difficult to watch; Dominik pulls no punches here in framing the brutality of the situation.  And yet, there's a surprising undertone of humor, centered largely around Richard Jenkins's unnamed character: he's a criminal of the new order, a bureaucratic middleman, and paired up against the more pragmatic Brad Pitt (""Now f***in' pay me""), he's a fish out of water.

This is an actor's film; great turns are had by Sam Shepard, Scoot McNairy, Ben Mendelsohn, James Gandolfini, and especially the afore-mentioned Jenkins and Liotta (cast gloriously against type).  Pitt is the major attraction here, but his performance is so subtle and understated that no doubt many fans will be disappointed.  And yet, Pitt digs under your skin, and in the final scene, when he really cuts loose about the one thing that really matters--money--you sense how everything has been building to this moment.  Because, believe it or not, this is a gangster film about economics.  It's a gangster film about America; but instead of CASINO or SCARFACE or GOODFELLAS, it's about the side of America that we're used to, because to an extent, most of us have been there.  When they talk about films that encapsulate the early 21st century, and the shift in economy and politics, they will reference this film.  Which, perhaps, makes this an important little movie.  Give KILLING THEM SOFTLY a shot; if you have the patience to sit through it, the experience is rewarding, if a little off-putting at times.",1365033600,,2441,4.905109489051095

It is often interrupted by political messages sewn into the fabric of the setting.  The characters are not well-developed.  Given, the actors are all pretty accomplished and talented.  But, again, we come back to story.  This is like a mid-grade short story in an anthology.  It tries too hard to stand out and be artsy fartsy while insisting it is akin to Goodfellas or the Sopranos.  If the movie had taken a hard, gritty, mafia-mentality approach to the story and woven a true thriller or drama, it would have succeeded.  No question.  The acting talent alone is worth the cost of renting it.  It just falls flat.  And the characters we spend most of our time with are dumb goofballs or pallid uninteresting fillers.

After all, both Brad Pitt and Ray Lyotta have had better performances in past movies (goodfellas was legendary as far as Lyotta goes, and Brad Pitt had an amazing performance in fightclub). Therefore I cant honestly state that this movie is their best at least acting wise; however when considering the movie past what is portrayed on the surface it is a fantastic film. Each of the characters represents a piece of the puzzle and are representative of the actions that occurred during the recent recession.

A laundry man John Amato ( Vincent Curatola) has a plan to rob a mob game with the help of two idiots Scoot McNairy as Frankie along with Ben Mendelsohn  as Russell, a heroin addict.  , run by Markie Trattman ( Ray Liotta). The idiots are against it but Amato insists that no one will suspect them because the game has been robbed before by Markie himself. So naturally the suspicion will fall on him. The game is hit and Richard Jenkins hires Jackie ( Pitt) to clean up the mess created by the idiots. Jackie sublets this job to a out of town hitman Mickey ( James Gandolfini) who has a taste for hard drinking and women.

The sub text and backdrop of this film is the economic downturn, the 2008 election and the grittier side of New Orleans post Katrina, Andrew Dominik's film is an engaging look at the criminal world with a lot of blood and beatdowns.

Brad Pitt is amazing as the actor who is often unnoticed. Scooty McNairy and James Gandolfini are amazing as well.

Its impossible to miss the not so subtle background of economic ruin of 2008 and its effect of the fallout on everything including the mob. The final scene is in a bar and Pitts finds out that he has been paid less for a job. Its Obama speaking about  reclaiming the American dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth, that, out of many, we are one...

5305143,2,B009AMALBM,"I wanted to like this film. I tried to appreciate this film for what it is rather than what I wanted it to be, but ultimately I was left with disappointment. Before I go any farther, I will issue a general warning that spoilers may lie ahead. If that presents a problem then you probably shouldn't be reading these reviews in the first place.

On the positive side, the cinematography is striking and most scenes are composed beautifully. The film is a visual treat. The dialogue can be clever, if largely pointless and time wasting. The pace is inconsistent but when it works, it works very well. The actors bring a genuine quality to their characters. ""Nuanced"" is a description that is overused, in my opinion, but it is an apt description for many of the performances on display here.

On the other hand,the single most damning criticism of this film is that it is boring. Really, really boring. As previously mentioned, the inconsistent pacing is part of the problem, along with self indulgent dialogue and pointless plot elements. One case in point is Gandolfini's character, Mickey.

If there is a prime example of what is wrong with this film, it is Mickey. His dialogue seems to last forever as it dwells on pointless detail, going nowhere to advance the plot and, ultimately, his introduction into the story yields nothing more than the mob accountant complaining about misspent money. Huh?

I will keep the DVD for archival and research purposes, as I doubt I will ever watch this film again for any other reason than research or background information. Damnation by faint praise, perhaps, but I simply cannot recommend anyone purchase this DVD unless it is under similar circumstances.",1364688000,2,1697,4.86159169550173

At first this may seem like another hitman movie, and I like Brad Pitt's acting in almost every movie - but I feel it makes a statement about the state of our nation and the way people value their lives, others' lives and money.  I really don't want to say more than this as I don't want to spoil it for anyone. It's not a nail-biter, it doesn't have great action or gory kills. It's not a gangster movie. I like it a lot, but I seem to watch movies too many times and people don't often agree with me, or think that I over-think everything!",1364688000,2,714,5.31858407079646

Throw in some drug use and voila! A hit! Then, they assumed that we are all stupid enough, and all ignorant enough, that we would stare wide-eyed at the screen, our jaws agape, thinking, ""Oh my gosh! What profound realism! How impressive!

There is no story line, scenes totally unconnected with any degree of coherence, sewer language used as every other word, bad guys sitting around, cigarettes dangling out of their mouths, talking tough, kill a few guys (why?) ... Hey! An OSCAR!

But as an entry in the 'Gangster"" genre, it is rock-bottom BORING. I actually enjoyed seeing many of the actors in this film, such as Pitt, Gandolfini, Liotta. It was also nice to see Vincent Curatola, who is known to fans of this genre as Johnny 'Sack"", a regular on the SOPRANOS. (It would have been nice to see he and Gandolfini in a scene together, just for nostalgia's sake.) However, watching these actors do their thing was not enough to make up for how slow and draggy this sleeper is. It is a political statement disguised as a gangster film. I'm not opposed to the ideas the writer/director wanted to explore; I just think he could have done the same story while ramping up the action/violence just a few degrees.

Brad Pitt does a nice job as a credible hit man (Jackie), but we get zero development of his character -- we're left with no real idea who he is, where he came from, or where he's going. James Gandolfini's self-destructive and pitiful Mickey has a great back story, and he's the only really multi-dimensional character in the movie (you could argue Scoot McNairy's Frankie has some heft). But we never see what happens to scene- and show-stealing Mickey, we just get a mumbled summary of closure in passing. In the same ""chatty mobster"" vein popularized by The Sopranos, there is a heck of lot of talk, but you never really learn much of anything about the characters. I'm bewildered as to why Sam Shepard's Dillon character is in the movie for about 15 seconds and then mentioned about 1,500 times.

5305313,5,B009AMALBM,"Andrew Dominik is, after only three films, a truly unique talent and perhaps one of the best directors working today. He possesses a clearly defined vision for his films and Killing them Softly is no different. This was far and away the best film of 2012, it was also the most underrated and perhaps unfairly criticized. I can see how some people would be turned off by this film, it's an odd and heady mix of politics, mob movie, grit, dirt, and the characters are a mash up of broken down drunks, ex-cons, and druggies who are barely hanging on to an America that's given up on them (or just never knew about them in the first place.) But for all it's weight Killing them Softly never cracks. It's frequently funny (albeit darkly funny) and hits you square in the chest. It's brutal but beautifully so. Brad Pitt, is a performer whose truly come into his own in the last 10 to 15 years and Killing them Softly is the culmination of all of that talent. James Gandolfini is as always wonderful but I think the true standout is Scoot McNairy playing the ex-con drug addict who embodies every American dream gone (way) wrong. Not only does he frequently steal the show from everyone he shares the screen with and not only does he gain sympathy from the audience he completely breaks your heart with his stunning performance. Killing them Softly is a true masterwork from a director who will one day be a legend. This is one you cannot miss.",1364515200,3,1438,4.513409961685824

As the 'professional' who must come in to take care of a wise-guy mess, his character is all professional and it's only through small glimpses of dialog (and a killer ending dialog) that we see and understand his character.  And that's what makes this crime noir a must see.  If you're tired of the Hollywood hyped ""independent"" films, then this will meet your expectations.  A movie star who is willing to delve into  a character who isn't loveable --but is ultimately one you can relate to-- is unusual indeed.

This movie has the right elements with great actors which includes James Gandolfini, Richard Jenkins, Ray Liotta, and-- briefly Sam Shepard. But the script and storyline is what falls flat with the heist gone wrong and its ripple effect on an underworld ecosystem plot.

Andrew Dominik's screenplay is a clever and brilliant analogy for where America is as a country right now.  Americans would like to be able to reconcile their conflicting attitudes and thereby reduce their dissonance and regain consistency between their beliefs and behaviors - reduce discomfort and restore some balance. But instead, as is evidenced in this movie, when this struggle can't find resolution it ""can give rise to irrational and sometimes maladaptive behavior"". Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini are excellent, as is the entire cast.  The direction (also by Mr. Dominik)is perfect.

5305334,1,B009AMALBM,"I can't think of a movie that I've ever watched that was more boring than this one. Basically after one of the worst opening film credits sequences I've ever endured, you sit through scene after scene of just talking. Nothing else really happens throughout the rest of the film, (spoilers follow) you've got a ridiculous hold up a mob card game scene, where you wonder why no one in the room bothered to shoot the robbers when they are no longer at gunpoint fleeing down a long corridor around back to their getaway car parked in the front. This is pretty much the only action of this film except a predictable who is going to get killed couple of murders during the final few minutes. Before that there's also a ridiculous beating up a guy scene where the victim is totally expecting to get murdered but gets in the car anyway.

The total nothing else but talking parts of the film probably total five minutes at the most. The rest of the film is talking in a bar, talking on a vacant lot, talking in a car, talking in the street, talking in a backroom office, talking in a cheap hotel room, talking to someone so out of it on drugs you've got to repeat the lines over and over again, and we're not talking about stimulating conversations either.

5305376,4,B009AMALBM,"Andrew Dominik's screenplay and direction of George V. Higgins' novel `Cogan's Trade' may have to search for the right audience because it is a complexly designed and performed piece of cinema.  But for those who are willing to step into a different stratosphere of combining gangland antics and brutality with a strong subtext of commentary on the current status of American political system - a film packed with some top notch performances by a varied set of actors - then spend some time with KILLING THEM SOFTLY. The title comes from the main character professional hitman Jackie Cogan who confides that he likes to carry out his missions without getting to close to the victims so that he doesn't have to hear their whining and pleas and crying etc as he kills them - distance allows him to kill them softly.

We learn that Markie (Ray Liotta) some years back made a lot of money by raiding a gambling game.  Since it worked before, odds are that it will work again now that Markie is out and in the mob controlled gambling scene. Some amateurs (Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn, both losers on heroin) are hired by Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola) to stickup a mob protected card game, causing the local criminal economy to collapse. Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) is an enforcer for the Mob and is called in by an unnamed driver (Richard Jenkins) who is brokering the deal to track them down and restore order to the local criminal economy. Cogan demands that an assistant Mickey (James Gandolfini) be brought in, but when Mickey arrives in town he is far more interested in prostitutes and staying drunk than doing his job. How the final plan to correct the problem is carried out is the rapid-fire sequence of the last part of the film and to spoil it would be a shame.

In many ways the movie is a recreation of the 2008 financial crisis - each character represents a different contemporary type (e.g., Richard Jenkins is the American government, etc). Under much of the dialogue for the film is the presence of political television shows with Bush and Obama talking, underlining the 2008 financial crisis, and that adds to the veracity of the story.  The actors are excellent, the action is a bit on the gory side, but the seemingly endless and roaming dialogue holds a lot of viewpoints that are salient and make these underbelly jerks credible.

Brad Pitt was ok, but the story was faulted from the beginning, its hard for me to stay interested when I know how the movie will end within the first ten minutes.",1364256000,2,467,4.379310344827586
5305382,3,B009AMALBM,"That America is about big business and the ruthlessness of big business is highlighted by running parallelsbetween the American election campaign in the background with the voices of George Bush and Obama on TV screens where the economy has been hit by a crash,and the criminal community's economy collapse,because a mob-protected card game hosted by Markie Trattman(Liotta)has been robbed by two dumb hoods hired by small-time crookJohhny Amato, to make some easy money. In this film the criminals talk the talk,we are led by the dialogue into espying what the contrasting action set-pieces will be,figuring out the plot,where they walk the walk. The weaselly ex-con Frankie(Scot McNairy) and his addled side-kick Russell(Mendelsohn) have knocked over the poker game,one to get a better car and more sex,the other to get drugged,you know they are both doomed. Also Markie having previously robbed his own game,suspicion will immediately fall on him again.

A mob fixer hires Jackie Cogan(Pitt) to eliminate the perpetrators of the robbery and restore confidence. Writer-director Dominik has adapted/updated Higgins 70s novel,Cogan's Trade,to show the fissure opened up in the idea of community, whereby organised crime is a microcosm of the whole. Ideals are a faade that masks a system run on individual self-interest and greed. The hold-up with sawn-off shot guns is edgy,unpredictable,the violence of Markie's beating up is hard to watch,these are grimy,scummy people who treat women like dirt and hold life in contempt. Pitt's amiable assassin prefers to ""kill them softly"",pick his targets off long range,flitting from personal bonhomie to dead-eyed murderous efficiency. Cogan thinks bringing in fellow assassin Mickey(Gandolfini) to share the hits,only for the latter to prove a drunken,sex-addicted liability. The film has some beautifully weighted scenes of dialogue between Cogan and Jenkins,a middle management operative,Cogan and Mickey,with more flamboyant set-pieces, a slow-mo symphony of breaking glass and spurting blood,accompanied by ballads like `Love Letters.'The film is full of a kind of dirty realism,dark shadows,vintage autos prowling through the night,and the slangy zing of foul-mouthed punks who are prey to corporate manoeuvres,which dictate you have to kill someone who wasn't responsible for the heist to restore public trust. Richard Jenkins,Ray Liotta ,Gandolfini all bring class to their roles. Pitt is supreme. His best acting role for years.",1364169600,,2479,5.663978494623656

5305422,5,B009AMALBM,"KILLING THEM SOFTLY, the riveting crime drama from writer/director Andrew Dominik, evokes memories of Quentin Tarantino's RESERVOIR DOGS, in that it spends a lot of time, particularly before anything significant happens, exploring the personalities of pair of secondary characters; not-too-bright amateur criminals who are about to enter the ""big time"" with disastrous results.

These two schmucks (Scoot McNairy, Ben Mendelsohn), with the plan of fellow ex-con Vincent Curatola, make the mistake of holding up a Mob card game, run by Ray Liotta.  Curatola figures that, since Liotta had engineered a heist of his game once before, he will be blamed for this robbery also.

Mendelsohn, however,  is not only a drug addict, but he also has a big mouth, and it not long before the Mob (represented by Richard Jenkins) knows the identities of the guys who pulled off the job.  Enforcer Brad Pitt is called in to take care of the three culprits, as well as Liotta, whose ""hit"" is necessary in the interest of ""public relations"".

What makes KILLING THEM SOFTLY a unique crime drama, as well as a dark comedy, is that the action is played against the 2008 financial meltdown and Presidential campaign.  Like with the national meltdown, the robbing of the Mob card game has hurt the local crime economy.  For example, when Pitt tells Jenkins that he needs to bring in another hit man (James Gandolfini) to help him with pull off the 3-4 contact killings, the Mob boss' agrees to the price, but then insists, ""Have him fly coach"".

Gritty dialogue, multi-dimensional characters, and fine performances all around results in this release from Anchor Bay Entertainment being one of the finest, and most realistic crime dramas of the past decade.

A word of caution: The scenes of violence are extremely violent; not for the squeamish.

DVD extras include a ""Making of"" featurette and four deleted scenes.

5305460,5,B009AMALBM,"This movie has gotten a raw deal.  It is a 5-star movie.  The problem is it's an exceedingly subtle movie.  Read through the mixed to negative reviews and you see one of two things (or both things):  either the person thinks the movie is superficial politica, or they had expectations (because of the gangster genre) and were let down.

Here's the thing.  This movie is a recreation of the 2008 financial crisis.  Every character in the movie represents a different group (like Richard Jenkins is obviously the American government).  When you view the movie with this frame, as a parable, I think it takes on new dimensions.  You're suddenly comparing characters and groups of characters (like the poker players) to their real-life equivalents (the poker players represent the American 1%).  But you're also looking at the interaction between characters and then what that's saying about the interaction between the real-life equivalents.  What do I mean by that?  The final speech.  I won't give it away, but a lot of reviewers and people who have seen the movie say the final speech is cheesy.  Sure.  Except when you view it through the frame of ""Brad Pitt's character has a real-life equivalent"", the final speech takes on a different dynamic.  It isn't just some speech in a fictional narrative of some movie.  It has a real-world influence, it represents something that's not fiction.  Who does Brad Pitt's character represent?  It's not a ""who"" rather than a ""what"".  (Hint:  it's the American Spirit).  The question isn't ""is the speech cheesy or not, is it bad or not, is it cool or not?""  The question is:  do you agree that the speech is representative of the 21st Century American Spirit?  If not, why?  If so, why?  If you agree, does the speech make you feel a rush of pride or discomfort?  Then you also have to analyze what it means that it's the avatar for the American Spirit that ends the movie with a surge of emotion.  Is Andrew Dominick saying that despite all the **** from the 2008 crisis, the American Spirit will overcome it and win out?  I think so.

In other words:  imagine taking the 2008 financial crisis and condensing it into a fairy tale wearing gangster clothes.  That's what ""Killing Them Softly"" is.

Don't expect a fast-moving gangster movie.  Don't expect ""The Departed"" or ""Goodfellas"".

Don't short-change the movie and think it's dumber than what it thinks it is.  If it's not smarter than you, it's at least as smart as you.

It's fine if you understand what the movie is doing and still don't like it.  Maybe it really is too slow for you.  Maybe you just don't like these kinds of movies.  It's not a bad movie, though.

Pitt portrays Jackie Cogan, a cold-blooded, pragmatic, and socially disconnected murderer for hire. His livelihood, an ironic misnomer if there ever was one, is dealing in death. As a professional he wants, even expects, executions to be done with a degree of efficiency. With a distorted sense of pride, complains about the emotional baggage that he sees as undignified and pathetic in those who are about to die at his hands.

Jackie has been brought in to deal with a bunch of thieves who stole from the wrong people.

Your average knucklehead, the kind you see in programs like 'Jail' or 'Behind Bars', does not realize that for the professional criminal, after a certain point, the money or product is no longer the issue. You can't return what you've taken and apologize. No amount of reparations will suffice. For them, blood is the only thing that will clear the books.

There's a reason why no half-wit moron hits a gambling den protected by the mob; be they Italian, Chinese, Gangsta, etc. It's the third rail of the underworld.

While I loved the subdued cinematic palette, honed thespian performances, and the dark energy the script - I felt the film wasn't as strong as it could be. As a monster fan of David Mamet, the master of the twisted crime drama, thought 'Killing' could've used sharper dialogue, a crisper interplay between characters, and a deeper more complex plot. The simplicity, while admirable, wasn't challenging enough. Made worse by the inclusion of James Gandolfini's character as Mickey, a rambling and emotionally broken mechanic. Wasted talent as a side character that was completely unnecessary to the film.

While a fascinating project for Pitt, who co-produced the movie and had full control of the direction and content, I have to give greater weight to the fact that the film's interplay wasn't as subtly explosive or creatively warped enough. I expected more.

Really torn between grades. The craft excellence shown and the slick production values make for an easy four. But the all-important story was simply disappointing. Call it a very high three.

5305497,2,B009AMALBM,"In Killing Them Softly, Brad Pitt stars as Jackie Cogan, a mafia hitman hired to take out the individuals responsible for robbing a poker game.  Mickey (Ray Liotta) runs the game, but already knocked over (robbed) his own game once before, leading to an implication that he did it once again.  Scott McNairy, Ben Mendelsohn, Richard Jenkins, James Gandolfini, and Vincent Curatola also star in supporting roles.

At some point, a typical gangster film or television show will feature a gangster-run card game.  However, it typically ends with some kind of shootout - yet in this particular film, the robbers easily get away with the cash, but are simply too stupid to leave town after the deed.  What does all of this mean for this film?  It means it's a slow moving, realistic plot that has very little entertainment value until the end.  And, even in the end, the audience will easily see how the film is going by the end.

The cast is one of the bright spots of the film.  Brad Pitt does a marvelous job (as usual), while Ray Liotta plays his typical gangster role dating back several years to Goodfellas.  We also see a bit of a Sopranos reunion with James Gandolfini - in a very unusual role - along with Vincent Curatola, and Max Casella, even though none of them have any scenes together.  In the end, it's Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn who really steal the show in this one.  Their scatterbrained/humorous exchanges are about the only thing stopping you from falling asleep.

Overall, this makes for a tough date night film to sit through - unless you're a gangster enthusiast.  Running at just over 90 minutes, it will feel like 3 hours, but don't mistake this for a bad film because it's not date night worthy.  This film is worthy of achievement, but unfortunately - it's the kiss of death for a date night film.

In Killing Them Softly, the acting and screenplay is STOIC. And Brad Pitt is so good in this film that I feel he deserves atleast a nomination for best actor.

The film is very dialogue driven and the screenplay looks very authentic and tightly wound up. All scenes are very dramatic and powerful despite being very finitely tuned conversations.

I found the slow burner direction quite apt and effective. This film is a bit like Road to Perdition but hey there's no family, there's no Thomas Newman, there's just a motive to kill. Outstanding end. I liked this more than Assassination of Jesse James which is another film by the same director (only an hour longer)

5305499,3,B009AMALBM,"Writer/director Andrew Dominik proved himself a visual poet when he made The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford in 2007. That film, also starring Brad Pitt, was a masterpiece and I had high hopes for Killing Them Softly. After all, it's based on the novel Cogan's Trade by George V. Higgins who also wrote The Friends of Eddie Coyle, which was adapted into a terrific 1973 film. What could go wrong? Well, critics have mostly been warm to the film but it's been met with scorn by audiences. Is it the masterpiece I expected from Dominik? No. Is it subtle? Most definitely not. But is there much to admire about it? Certainly.

The film opens with Frankie (Scoot McNairy), obviously distressed, walking through a New Orleans-area wasteland while clips of a speech by then-Senator Barack Obama play on the soundtrack. The setting is election year 2008 as the country is experiencing an economic downturn. Frankie and his perpetually sweaty, Australian business associate Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) are low-level thugs recruited by Johnny ""Squirrel"" Amato (Vincent Curatola) to knock over a card game. Frankie is skittish about the job, pointing out that they'll all be murdered if they do it, until Squirrel reveals the game is run by Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta). Years ago, Markie had orchestrated the robbery of one of his games and gotten away with it. Now it's common knowledge that he was responsible and if another one of his games is knocked over, he'll be suspect and take the fall. Things initially go well for the robbers, but when hitman Jackie Cogan (Pitt) arrives he doesn't believe everything went down exactly as it appears. Political speeches by both George W. Bush and Obama are featured prominently throughout the film, particularly speeches regarding money and the economy.

Killing Them Softly appears to be a straight-forward crime thriller, but has nearly wall-to-wall dialogue and grander ideas than that genre suggests. In inserting these speeches into the film with absolutely zero subtlety, we have Dominik paralleling the collapse of the U.S. economy with the collapse of the economy within the crime world. Killing Them Softly is certainly stylish, but with such a heavy-handed allegory, it seems to be grasping for substance. It doesn't lack substance per se; there's some strong dialogue with great depth, but the film lacks some vague essential element.

Cinematographer Greig Fraser employs a muted color palette that makes New Orleans look like a post-apocalyptic wasteland. It's not as visually intriguing as The Assassination of Jesse James, but the visual prowess adds to the film's effect. During breaks from dialogue, the film does become ultra-violent and it does so in a visually interesting way. There's a scene where a character is brutally beaten and the way Dominik illustrates the brutality makes it hard to stomach. A subsequent murder scene is shown in ultra-slow motion and it's a work of visual panache and artistry. The look and tone established by the photography moves the film along better than the characters and dialogue do.

Every performance here is strong, but none are Oscar-worthy. Pitt's cool, mature performance continues his streak of quality performances in mostly quality films. There is an element of typecasting that works in the film's favor, particularly in regards to Liotta and James Gandolfini as Jackie's troubled hitman friend Mickey, allowing the film to establish the persona of the characters without giving too much back story. Mendelsohn meanwhile nearly steals the show from his more well-known peers as the unreliable junkie Russell.

Like much of the film the dialogue is heavy-handed, but it's very strong, specifically in the closing scene. The final lines spoken by Pitt make Dominik's point loud and clear and the lines themselves are startling and powerful, yet the ending doesn't quite work either. In many ways, Killing Them Softly feels incomplete; like small pieces of a larger masterpiece. The original cut was two and a half hours, while the final cut runs just over 90 minutes. I didn't know this beforehand and I still sensed the film may have been missing crucial scenes. There's a distinct lack of development in terms of plot and character that some of the missing scenes may have restored and the lack of proper build-up makes some scenes that should have had an impact simply hit the wall. Take the Mickey character for example. He arrives and shows more of an interest in prostitutes and booze than the job he came to do, but then his character's gone with a simple explanation. Perhaps his character had some contribution or meaning within the longer cut, but here he seems like filler. His character serves no purpose, except maybe to show that Jackie has empathy for people. However, that was established in his ""I like to kill them softly"" monologue, so (great as Gandolfini is) Mickey is a frivolous character.

There are things to appreciate about Killing Them Softly but the stylish scenes of mayhem would be much more powerful with a stronger film surrounding them. It is imperfect, but I can't escape the feeling that a better film exists in there somewhere. Because it aspires to be more than a simple crime thriller there will be those who hail it as a masterpiece, but I'm unable to ignore its shortcomings. I know there's a fine film within Killing Them Softly, this just isn't it.",1357171200,2,5412,5.021158129175946
5305500,3,B009AMALBM,"Just when I thought Brad Pitt's career was ruined by a way overacted and ridiculed on Saturday Night Live Chanel No. 5 commercial, along comes ""Killing Them Softly"". In the movie, he reminds us that he's more than just a pretty face with a sultry voice. He plays Jackie Cogan, a man who has made a career of not being well known, the complete opposite of his real persona. Career saved!

""Killing Them Softly"" may have big time actors like James Gandolfini, Ray Liotta and Brad Pitt, but the movie is as small as any other independent low budget film you may venture to see. Its premise centers around a culture of despair and desperation that has gripped our country. There is no musical soundtrack in the film. The tone of the film is captured with sound bites and clips of President's Barack Obama and George Bush, talking about hope and unity, all the while our country is falling farther and farther into economic ruin. With that ruin comes a new era of gangster, mob, crime mentality. With that ruin comes characters like Frankie and Russell, who are desperate enough to pull off a robbery just for a paycheck.

Jackie Cogan is called in by a secret group of men who want to know who robbed their card game of $100,000 and want somebody to pay. Pitt pulls off Cogan's menacing charm with ease. He has to be somebody who is capable of awful things, but could easily friend you at the drop of a hat. Gandolfini is a fellow hit man who comes in because one of the jobs Cogan is asked to do is of a personal nature. While his character is interesting, his relevance becomes questionable and the two long talky scenes that he is in become even more troublesome.

""Killing Them Softly"" is 100% independent film. It has a gangster movie type feel to it, but character exploration is at its heart. The scenes are real and effective. Although there are too many long scenes, most notably the scenes with Gandolfini that serve little to no purpose and weigh the film down. Yet, as I stated earlier, the Presidential sound bites that loom over the film are effective and add validity to a movie that probably wouldn't have been as good without them. When desperation becomes more prevalent and the people in charge are full of hot air, things and people happen. Despair is a very real thing and we have all become reliant upon paychecks and money. The events of the film unfold, but the true message of the film last long afterward.",1357171200,,2427,4.536529680365297
5305501,3,B009AMALBM,"Watching Killing Them Softly was like my first attempt to read George Higgins Cogan's Trade. I picked up the book because of Andrew Dominick's involvement with a film adaptation and was a huge plus after Chopper and The Assassination of Jesse James. Cogan's Trade to say the least was an eye opening experience something that took me two tries to get the hang of Higgins use of dialogue using conversations to push plot over prose. In fact of the two books I've read his dialogue is more immersive than his descriptions of action. Higgins wasn't overburdening his novels with too much twists or overly complicated plot. Reading that much dialogue crammed into pages was dizzying to say the least something that translates to the film. There's not much action instead focusing on conversations of the characters instead. Higgins wasn't so much writing novels as plays in a way.
In fact Cogan's Trade and Killing Them Softly both have a rather simple plot, something that fits with the original title that was unfortunately changed months before release. After a mob backed card game is held up by two punks working for an intermediate, the mob contacts hitman Jackie Cogan to put things right and get the card games back up and running. What procedes are a lot of conversations between Jackie, thiefs Frankie and Russel, and Mickey a killer flown in to kill a man who knows Cogan's reputation as a killer. Adapted from the book its all basically following the business of Cogan's Trade adorned with with a rather overbearing need to tie Cogan's killings with that of the current economic issues of 2008 when the film takes place.
Other than the overkill with the films point one of the main problems of the film is it doesn't do much with the material which makes the characters suffer outside of Cogan who for those who enter the film cold comes across as ruthless but economical in how he handles his job. Frankie is too much of a simpering twit who Scoot Mcnairy does what He can with the character. Ben Mendhelson does a better job with the comic relief of strung out Russel and Ray Liotta adds some sympathy as Markie the gangster who has to be killed simply for his past transgressions.
Dominik hasn't really changed much from the book. Every scene of the movie is mainly unchanged every conversation verbatim only adding a bit of cynicism with a conversation between Jenkins and Pitt at the finale. The financial crisis takes center stage too much so with every radio and television blaring news and talk radio in an effort that makes the political billboard at the start of the movie seem tame by comparison. Its overdone which makes another decision seem strange in changing the setting from Higgins Boston to New Orleans. Unlike the news which gives you a feel of time setting the film in New Orleans doesn't really work out for much as if you're not from the city you might really not notice much and the film doesn't do much with it making the change seem strange over pointed.
What Dominik doesn't do with writing at least his direction is top notch in creating a grim and beautiful scneario. Theres humor that wasn't really in the book but scenes like a beating in a rain storm or a slowmotion execution are highlights for the films visual flair. The main holdup is exemplary in its suspense and the meetings between Jenkins and Pitt follow the main point of Higgins novel in making the act of killing come across as a business.
The movie is a film that doesn't work well. Higgins novel that reads like a play works better in the intimate way reading a book can as Dominik doesn't really do much with the material outside of simple straight adaptation. Killing Them Softly is a soft misfire for a good director.",1357171200,,3724,4.687022900763359
5305502,2,B009AMALBM,"I expected much more, given the cast. It was boring and stupid. Some characters had absolutely nothing to do with the story and seemed to be there as filler. Skip this unless you have trouble sleeping.",1356739200,2,201,4.611111111111111
5305503,4,B009AMALBM,"Once again Pitt shows up in a movie you don't really expect, which is kinda his trademark. This film is slow moving, character driven, and very dark. If you appreciate movies that aren't generic and formulaic then this is a good one. I'll definitely get it on DVD. One complaint here, and I hate to be the gun nazi, but at one point a weapon comes into play that's very old and chambered in a very unusual caliber, which would be cool if it wasn't ejecting what are clearly blank spent shells in slo-mo. Come on guys, attention to detail. Other than that, awesome movie.",1356220800,2,570,4.438095238095238
5305504,1,B009AMALBM,"I couldn't wait to see this movie. Unfortunately, there were a couple of really great scenes and a bunch of rambling on about all kinds of things that didn't add to the story in any way. I thought between Brad Pitt, Ray Liotta and James Gandolfini, there was sure to be some entertainment value. Boy, was I wrong. The reviews were good, so even as it continued to drag on, I decided to be patient. I lasted a lot longer than the 5 or 6 people who walked out, but by the end all I felt was regret for not following suit.",1355788800,7,519,4.098039215686274
5305505,5,B009AMALBM,"Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola) runs a dry cleaning business and is a low level crime entrepreneur. He hires two guys to rob a poker game filled with organized criminals. Frankie (Scoot McNairy) is the lead robber, a man who is a Steve Buscemi type. He has help from an unkempt Australian junkie friend named Russell (Ben Mendelsohn), who walks pets for a living. He hopes to be a drug dealer to change his life.

The reason why they believe they can get away with the job is because Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta) had done this job once before. He will surely be blamed. After the job is pulled, hitman Jackie (Brad Pitt) is brought in to sort things out and make things right. Jackie is thoughtful, soft spoken, and cynical. Since he knows Johnny, he hires Mickey (James Gandolfini) to do the job, a man who has multiple issues.

There are a number of things which set this film apart from other crime movies. First is the dialouge. It is clear the people are uneducated, except for Jackie who speaks as if he lives in two worlds. The ignorance of the robbers is brought to light when they wear bright yellow cleaning gloves to perform their task.

The second aspect is the background sound on both the radio, TV, and jukeboxes. It is the macrocosm of what is happening on the screen, and sometimes in an ironic fashion. The time period is the 2008 election season during the financial collapse. We hear ""restore confidence in the financial system"" and ""it's all too familiar"" on the radio when Markie is about to take the fall. Every time ""B"" actor Ray Liotta got punched or kicked, I would think, This is for ""Entitled"" or This is for ""Ticket Out."" Here is one for ""The Son of No One.""

The symbolism of the background announcements is brought to light at the end, in case you failed to catch it in the opening scene. A smart film for people who enjoy crime dramas.
