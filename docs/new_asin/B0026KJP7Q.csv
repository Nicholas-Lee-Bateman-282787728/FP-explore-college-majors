8352925,5,B0026KJP7Q,"As with every other Davy Wotton DVD I've purchased, Davy once again does not disappoint. As he ties each of flies, he gives excellent tips and hints to improve my overall tying abilities that I probably wouldn't learned if I had not bought the DVD. I 100% recommend every one of Davy's DVDs to anyone who is serious about improving their own fishing and tying skills.",1420761600,,367,4.575757575757576
