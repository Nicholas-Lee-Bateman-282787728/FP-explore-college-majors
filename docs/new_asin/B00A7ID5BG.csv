8547897,1,B00A7ID5BG,"Another customer has commented that this DVD does not play on a DVD player.  I hoped that was a one-time issue - but it wasn't.  I ordered the DVD and it would not play on a DVD player so I returned it.  I got a 2nd DVD and it does not play on a DVD player.  The first customer had mentioned that although it didn't play on a DVD player, it did play on the computer.  So it tried it - and my copy also plays on a Computer. HOWEVER, that is not how I want to use it.  Since it is NOT a DVD which was what I ordered, I will return this.",1461974400,,534,3.6403508771929824
8547898,3,B00A7ID5BG,"This is my second copy as Amazon replaced the first copy due to the DVD not being formatted for a DVD player. My replacement copy also only plays on a computer too.  I will keep it as its hard to find.  Just be aware that if you plan on showing it to a group, you will have to huddle around the PC screen.  I know Amazon has the DVD's manufactured as they are ordered so, there is obviously something wrong in the formatting of the copy.",1392854400,2,437,4.058139534883721
8547899,5,B00A7ID5BG,"Ernst Juengers film Bipolar is a wonderfully engaging depiction of all facets of the bipolar disease (=manic depression). On the one hand, the film features a host of highly informative interviews with some of the most well-known bipolar-researchers in the field. On the other hand, Bipolar takes a truly personal stance towards this mysterious disease. The film tells the life story of a bunch of people and how they managed to cope with their illness; it takes you thru the funny as well as the saddening and horrifying aspects of a life with bipolar. Ernst Juengers personal approach to the subject is authentic, because  as he tells us in the film  his father himself was bipolar.
I too know a bipolar person (thats why I bought the film). So I have some first-hand experience with this disease. And judging based on my own experience I will say that Ernst Juengers film is extremely authentic, emotional and revealing.",1385683200,2,923,4.872611464968153
8547900,1,B00A7ID5BG,"I couldn't follow this for long...  bored.  But then again, I like exciting material to read.  Maybe bipolar disorder isn't exciting....",1375056000,,136,5.380952380952381
8547901,4,B00A7ID5BG,"Overall, I like the video and will probably watch it from time to time. Teachers may be interested in this video to show in a classroom setting. It shows a short example of mania which may be useful for a teacher discussing Bipolar I disorder.",1369008000,,243,4.4222222222222225
