8111046,5,B000ELJA7O,"Watching this movie was captivating.  I loved the story line of how it played out to the end.  The actors were very good compared to other Indie films I've seen.  Khatee, who plays Robin, is a great actor for this part.  She shows passion as a social worker as well as Brooklyn's g/f.  Such a beautiful woman.  I could actually feel what she felt in this role.  Clody, who plays Brooklyn, is quite expressive in her role.  And so cute as a red-headed butch.  She tried so hard to be a smooth talker and tough but still showed her passion for Robin.  Their lives may be different but together they are such a beautiful couple.  I was especially captivated by the soundtrack.  Wonderful music, such soulful and meaningful songs for this movie.  I wish I had the soundtrack!!!

I would recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys diversity among lesbian lovers, women's music, lesbian romance and fun.  I have my popcorn and soda ready to watch again with my friends.",1288051200,2,960,4.564705882352941
8111047,1,B000ELJA7O,"This movie tries too hard to be hip and relevant (it fails), and is as subtle as a pipe struck across your head.  No artistry at all.  The ending credits say it all when it dedicates the film ""to the Ancestors...""  What pretentious new-age tripe.",1282262400,,246,4.4222222222222225
8111048,5,B000ELJA7O,"Beautiful Khahtee V. Turner, stars in this film as a social worker, named Robin. The story takes place in Oakland's tough inner-city, which is overwhelmed with poverty and misery, for most of its residents. Robin has a heart-of-gold, and is committed to doing whatever it takes, to improve her client's lives. But Robin's supervisor, is opposed to Robin's compassionate way of dealing with her client's, so she suspends Robin.

Meanwhile, Robin finds herself drawn to a cute butch lesbian, who she meets in a Cafe one day. The lesbian's name is Brooklyn, and she finds Robin attractive. Robin winds-up getting romantically involved with Brooklyn, even after Brooklyn tells Robin that she robs banks for a living. Brooklyn soon asks Robin to become her partner in crime. Jobless, and bitter about how the system oppresses the poor, Robin agrees.

Robin and Brooklyn, along with Brooklyn's henchman Monroe, pull one successful bank robbery after another. Newly affluent from her criminal activity, Robin feels obligated to give back to her community. So, she donates large sums of her money anonymously, to local charities. This drives a wedge between Robin and Brooklyn, and they briefly separate. They quickly reconcile though, after realizing how much they love one another.

Meanwhile, Brooklyn visits her father, who's in jail. Her dad wants Brooklyn to stay away from a life of crime, and work towards her dream of owning her own motorcycle shop. His advice gives Brooklyn second thoughts, about continuing her bank robbing career. But then Robin discovers that she's pregnant, and she's nearly broke, after giving away her money. So she and Brooklyn agree to pull one final big robbery, to finance their dreams. During the robbery, things go horribly awry, which results in nearly tragic consequences.

This film is briskly contemporary, in its portrayal of life in the gritty Oakland ghetto. It's good to see lesbians as the main characters in this movie, who are complex and interesting, rather than one-dimensional stereotypes. Khahtee V. Turner, gives a superb performance as the kind-hearted, idealistic, righteously angry Robin. Clody Cates infuses the character of Brooklyn, with a tough, yet vulnerable persona.

The film serves up lots of suspense, adventure, tender romance, and heart-ache. You really feel for these characters, as they cope against all odds. Through it all, the film highlights the virtues of true love, loyalty, and steely determination. It's definitely worth a look, especially for those that like an avant guard film, with unique characters.",1261958400,,2577,5.275609756097561
8111049,3,B000ELJA7O,This is a movie that has potential in the plot but suffers from a low budget. Its a good movie as we don't get to see our images on screen often.,1202947200,,145,3.7096774193548385
8111050,5,B000ELJA7O,This is actually a good quality independent film.  I personally screened the film and talked with the writer/director/producer/editor.  Sara Millman basically made this entire film on her own and on an extremely small budget.  People should feel lucky that they are able to watch this film.  The previous reviewer obviously has no appreciation for the medium of film and should not be watching movies.,1152662400,11,401,5.21875
8111051,2,B000ELJA7O,"The storyline had potential but the filming and acting were crappy. This was highly disappointing and I wouldn't recommend purchasing it unless you get it real, real cheap!  Watching this movie was painful...",1149465600,4,208,5.303030303030303
