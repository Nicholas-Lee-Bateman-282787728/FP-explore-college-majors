8688397,5,B00PKLTG7C,"A beautiful program with as much ballet as opera, showcasing the new performing arts building in 2013. What I found interesting was the solo voices chosen are mostly bass and baritone. There are at least 4 bass solos with great basses like Rene Pape, Ildar Abrazdakov, etc. The song of the Volga boatmen is sung by a Russian bass with a men's chorus behind him. Also featured is the deep mezzo voice of Olga Borodina singing ""Mon coeur s'ouvre a ta voix"" from Samson et Dalila. It shows the Russian taste for low voices. Placido Domingo sings ""Wintersturm"" from Walkure. The soprano Anna Netrebko is saved for the finale singing an aria from Macbeth and a duet from Don Giovanni ""la ci darem la mano"" with three basses and a baritone partnering her, one-upping each other with bigger and bigger bouquets of red roses for the great diva. There are really incredibly beautiful ballet scenes with the complete corps de ballet and various groups including young adolescent dancers. Overseeing the whole with supreme confidence and pride is maestro Valery Gergiev who was largely responsible for raising the money for this state of the art theatre.",1518307200,,1143,4.866666666666666
