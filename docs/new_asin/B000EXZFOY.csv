2546008,5,B000EXZFOY,"Anyone who has ever lived through a life altering event that left a scar of mental disorder will see the beauty in this film.  Film critique's are correct in their assessment of directer/writer Rebecca Cook's talent and promise, however they fail to read between the lines of character John Livien and feel the depth of what this movie offers to all of us as human beings.  Dark, gloomy, and exhaustingly dismal...this movie touches upon the John Livien in all of us, and the inner demons that we can either choose to live under...or learn from and move on.

Shooting Livien gets two thumbs up from me...and I give the yahoo's who don't appreciate this film two thumbs down.",1150243200,12,674,4.694915254237288
2546009,5,B000EXZFOY,"I just got ""Shooting Livian"" in the mail, & it was every bit as good, if not better than, I expected.  While everyone did a truly professional job, I have to credit Dominic Monaghan for the most colorful, believable performance.  He seemed easy and natural.  The actors playing the three band members suited their roles perfectly.  Loved the Lennon accents. It was little touches like that, the glasses,and  the ""Peace Bed"", that helped make the show for me.  The father was sympathetic, I liked the girlfriend, etc. Lovely soundtrack.

 The only fly in the ointment was Ally Sheedy, which surprised me as she is such an experienced actress. I just felt she was ""phoning in"" her performance.  I think she could have made more of an effort.

  Regardless, good ending.  Hopeful, realistic, satisfying, without being saccharine.

  Over all, I greatly enjoyed it, give it a thumbs up, & am glad to own it on DVD : )

2546010,4,B000EXZFOY,"I bought this film for Dominic Monaghan but I am also a great Beatles fan and was not disappointed.  If you like dark, angsty films featuring tortured tragic heroes and his friends and lovers who try to keep up with him as he falls apart, this is for you.  The original music is excellent and so are the performances.  The film has many dream sequences and interesting camera effects that are very effective in conveying the feel of the story.  I liked the chemistry between the bandmates.  Their reaction over the intrusion of Livien's girlfriend was very real.  Excellent film.  Surprised it didn't get more recognition when it was out there but well worth the purchase.",1147996800,5,672,4.741379310344827
2546019,1,B000EXZFOY,Enough said.  Couldn't get through it fast enough  Completely pointless film with uninspired script and cast.  Avoid it like the plague.,1282608000,,136,5.380952380952381
2546020,5,B000EXZFOY,"I wasn't expecting much as I had never heard of this 2004 movie until 2010, but I was really blown away by it.  Absolutely loved it.  A true independent film gem.  Great!  Yes, it's a dark and haunting story of a present day Lennon-inspired musician, but it's so-o-o-o much more than that.  Really loved the dialogue.  Loved the humor, albeit sparse.  Loved the hallucination scenes in bright primary colors while real life was in muted grays and browns.  Loved Dominic Monaghan's character ragging on Jason Behr's character about his Lennon impersonations, which were actually pretty good.  Jason Behr totally nailed his part, great performance.  Great nude scene at the wedding, very funny - ""It looks like the fantasy backfired.""  I'm still laughing.  Loved Fionn O'Lochlainn's music.  This is a movie I'll definitely watch a few times, which is the exception for me.  The dialogue grabbed me right from the start.  ""Before life, there must have been time.  And before time, there must have been God.  So in music, I always believed I would find God, because music is timeless.""",1275782400,,1081,4.949720670391062
2546021,1,B000EXZFOY,"I really hated the title character in this.  Maybe I'm just not the target audience, but I thought it was awful and pretentious.

Dominic Monaghan was fine as a hedonistic musician, and Ally Sheedy played nicely against her image as the manager.  I can't remember the rest, I disliked it so much.",1260403200,,296,4.653846153846154
2546022,5,B000EXZFOY,"I found this movie highly enjoyable. Fairly well filmed for an idependent movie. Jason Behr played the role of rising rock-star with a troubled past and slowly falling into insanity quite well. Though what made this movie for me was Dominic Monaghan's performance. His role as Owen made this movie extremely entertaining and I fell like I wouldn't have enjoyed this movie as much without him in it. He is a very talented actor.

Although if you are wishing to view this movie for the Beatles aspect, than this would be a let down. Although the Beatles were mentioned throughout the movie quite often and the relationship of Yoko and Lennon was slightly mimiced; it had almost nothing to do with the Beatles. But, the music in this movie was amazing and I found myself wishing I could put it on my Ipod.",1243555200,3,802,4.608391608391608
2546023,4,B000EXZFOY,"Watching this low budget production made me remember how the special people in my life had no limits, upwards or downwards. Thank you.

As for the review, I found Jason Behr's portrayal of the torn young artist outstanding. He made the introspective, emotionally disturbed John Livien quite believable. I think if I saw him on stage I could be crying. On the other hand, Dominic Monaghan, who plays Livien's second guitar and (a bit more than just) friend Owen, is once again just his usual self, known in abundance from Lost or LOTR, sorry to say. I liked the music (performed by Fionn O'Lochlainn) and wouldn't have minded to hear more of it. The movie is a bit dark, maybe too dark, as music is supposed to be the one light and love of the main character and we don't much get to feel any of the joy it brings him. Nevertheless, the movie touched me, I recommend it.",1224979200,,869,4.465408805031447
2546024,2,B000EXZFOY,I got this movie because Jason Behr was in it. I guess everyone needs to make a living but I wasted my money. There really isn't a storyline. Just a jumble. I was very disappointed,1190505600,2,180,4.171428571428572
2546025,2,B000EXZFOY,I Loved Jason in the Roswell series but this movie sucks sorry Jason you can do better,1173312000,,86,4.117647058823529
2546026,5,B000EXZFOY,"I stumbled across this film on Showtime, having never heard of it before.  I've always been a big fan of films about struggling rock musicians, despite the fact that most in this genre strike a lot of false notes - no pun intended.  SHOOTING LIVIEN, however, is the real deal.  This little film, filled with gritty, grotty New York locales and subtle, nuanced performances, is completely authentic.  It follows the burgeoning career of The Virgins Undone, a fictional NYC power trio fronted by the charismatic but deeply troubled John Livien.  Through brief, drug induced flashbacks, the viewer is given hazy glimpses into the childhood trauma at the root of his problems - conflicted memories of his mentally unstable mother, who fostered his early love of music and art, as well as his lifelong idolization of John Lennon.  Frequently addled by booze and drugs, Livien is vaguely disassociative, subject to frightening hallucinations and exhibiting strange, sexually inappropriate behaviour.  In situations where he needs to assert himself (e.g, when he is on stage), he hides behind affectations that mimic his idol, a pseudo-Liverpudlian accent and (non-prescription) round glasses.  Deeply mistrusting of women, he attempts to seduce every one he meets with an odd mixture of aggression and submissiveness.  The relationship between him and his mother and her tragic fate (a mystery revealed somewhat late in the film) has left him such obviously damaged goods, that the band's A&R rep, one of his many conquests, (an impressively lowkey Ally Sheedy) observes, ""Whatever she did to you, she almost spoiled you for the rest of us.""

The stunning Jason Behr is utterly riveting, completely believable and heartbreaking in the title role.  If there's any justice in Hollywood, he'll soon be competing with Billy Crudup for quality parts in intelligent films.  Dominic Monaghan and Joshua Leonard, as his bandmates, also turn in ingratiating, naturalistic performances. The dialogue and easy camraderie between the three men is one of the film's most authentic elements.  Last but certainly not least, the original music is head and shoulders above what usually passes for great rock and roll in films of this ilk (see the lame-o Sparklehorse  tunes in LAUREL CANYON as an example of the downside of this musical genre) and the songs sound quite credibly like the music of Livien's supposed main influence, post-Beatles John Lennon.

I can't say enough good things about this one.  If you catch it, be sure to watch until after the last credit rolls so you are left with no doubts about an otherwise ambiguous ending.  Wonderful.",1159142400,7,2630,5.165094339622642
2546027,2,B000EXZFOY,"I like the Beatles I have all thier records, thanks to my parents, and most of the cd's due to the fact that one day i'm afraid I won't be able to find needles for my record player. But, I fell asleep on this movie. I was tired after work so I thought I would try watching it again the next day. This time I stayed awake, thanks to my husband pinching me,  but not even the fine acting and incredible body of Jason Behr could make me think this was a great movie.

John Livien's a dark, morose miserable, confused man, haunted by the images of his mom who commits suicide.  His quest it seems is to find the tune to a beatles song his mom loved and to learn the words. Simple John play the  darn albums and find the song.  Maybe if he had stop doing drugs long enough and being miserable he could figure out his pain lies in his moms suicide and his fathers going on with his life. His propensity towards older women is understandable due to the lost of his mom at such a young age. But the scene where he kisses Ally Sheedy what was that.... not to mention that the women playing his girlfriend looks at least 10 to 15 years older than him. Although, the acting was good  why not find an actor that can sing, the story bleak, but a 5 star it ain't. And the reviewer who gives this 5 stars why? Slapping John Lennons image in  a movie doesn't a 5 star make. I feel as if i'm missing something in this movie but what is it.",1158192000,6,1422,4.057142857142857
2546028,4,B000EXZFOY,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I can't help wondering why we have't seen more of Jason Behr.  He gives a very believable performance as a young muscian trying to balance the possible success of his struggling band and his personal demons. The music was wonderful and so was the rest of the cast.  It was great to see Ally Sheedy again.  What I really love about this movie was the story.  Very different, not your cookie cutter bockbuster, seen it a thousand times plot.  Also not the type of movie where any actor with a pretty face could fill the main role.  Clearly Jason was made to play John, you could really feel how tortured this young man was.  If you enjoy seeing very original work with

a very talented cast and great music you will like this movie.

My prediction is that Jason Behr will be a huge star someday.",1154649600,4,823,4.3907284768211925

Even tho the actor himself is wonderful to see, I like the way he becomes invisible, and his character comes forward. This story had great meaning to me personally, and I felt it was told really well.  Liked the music, and the musician.  Nice camera work!  Director's commentary was highly informative!  All in all, wonderful film!",1519171200,,392,4.791044776119403
