733284,2,6303934528,"Director James Cruze's film is set in a fishing waterfront area of California during the Depression, where Ben Lyon, a reporter for The Standard newspaper, is trying to get evidence against the Chinese immigrant smuggler father of Claudette Colbert.
The screenplay is based on the bestseller by Max Miller and describes the Chinese as ""chinks"", with a brothel being named a ""boarding house"". Colbert gets a funny line when Lyon shackles her to a torture device in a ship's museum, and kisses her, and she replies ""That WAS torture"". There is the implausibility of a bandaid being applied to someone after back surgery!, but also a spit putting out someone's lit cigarette, and a shark attack at sea.
As well as proving a joke about a large worker at the ""boarding house"", Lyon's drunken friend Hobart Cavanaugh is also responsible for 2 subtextual moments which are far more shocking than Colbert's initial apearance supposedly naked. In one, Cavanaugh and Lyon share a bed, and in the second, thinking Cavanaugh has cleaned his house, Lyon says ""If you could only cook"" and Cavanaugh strikes a fey pose.
The soundtrack has long periods of silence against the dialogue, then intermittent jazz music to play over scenes between Lyon and Colbert, with the love scenes getting serious romantic music.
Cruze also uses a diagonal screen wipe often.
To compensate for Lyon's lack of screen charisma, Colbert is the best thing going here, funny and sassy when she slaps another woman. In one scene she uses a wheazy emotional voice for anger, and her favoured left side to the camera is not so noticable as in her later films.",1003795200,12,1619,4.890909090909091
733285,4,6303934528,"This is an unjustly neglected film which offers a terrific vintage Claudette Colbert performance; some say this is one of her finest. As Julie Kirk, Colbert is able to demonstrate her talent for sophisticated comedy while conveying the deeper emotions of a daughter's love for a father who does not deserve it. Ernest Torrence plays Eli Kirk, Julie's father and he's really believable as a greedy cruel character who somehow doesn't seem completely evil.",958521600,,454,5.148648648648648

733394,4,6303934528,"1st and foremost I hate it when people give away the ending in thier reviews!!! That ends up being a synopsis or a sumary, and not a review.
  If you want surprises when watching this movie don't read the other ""4star"" review on this movie! I will never give away an ending, and only reveal content when important to the review on the quality! I don't care if the movie is 75 years old, some of you haven't seen it and don't want the ending given away!!! For other reviewers... stop spoiling movies for people by giving away key parts of movies or books!!! In fact this practice of giving away key information in movies is now so prevalent on DVD and VHS covers and even in TV Guides, I've stopped reading them before I watch a movie. You have my word, I will never give away key information to spoil a movie or a book for you.

 Ok now the review: The story, though predictable, was well put together, and there was one touching twist at the end.

  Oddly the villian, despite his despicable activities, was likeable, probably because of his obvious affection for the daughter and his curious way of speaking.

  The real drawbacks to this was the callous way the boss and the reporter talk at each other with such disrespect, almost like someone turning up the radio full blast for a few seconds just to annoy you. Is that supposed to be funny? Also the supposedly ""comic relief"" lush who was so poor at acting drunk further pulled this story down. There was also a loose end... (A missing coast guard worker unaccounted for)

  Despite these thankfully little dips in the movie, the movie was quite a pleasant way to pass the time.

  The original quality of the sound was good and the photography was clear...but nothing exceptional; good tone and contrast.",1224806400,5,1761,4.525316455696203

733396,5,6303934528,"""I'll be seein' you."" -- Ben Lyon

""You've seen enough of me already."" -- Claudette Colbert

Everything about this pre-code film from 1933 is stylish, including a lovely Claudette Colbert and Ben Lyon in one of his best roles. Director James Cruz and photographer Ray June used a lens wipe technique to transition from scene to scene and the harbor is beautifully shot. Based on Max Miller's book, Wells Root's screenplay is frank and mature rather than risque, separating this pre-code film from others. It is steeped in reality rather than sensationalism and for that reason remains today one of the best from those first few years of sound films.

A young Claudette Colbert gives a subtle performance as Julie Kirk, the daughter of a salty smuggler along the harbor. There is nothing subtle about her magnetism, however, which lights up the screen. Ben Lyon also shines as newsman Joseph Miller. Bored and after a big story that will take him away from the waterfront, he decides to romance Julie in order to get to her father, Eli Kirk (Ernest Torrence), who has been smuggling Chinese into the harbor with deadly results. Colbert and Lyon are terrific as the flirting begins to feel like something more at the same time the Coast Guard closes in on her dad, and Joseph his big story.

Cruz films everything that happens between Julie and Joseph, both the serious and the playful, in a natural way. It is both a frank and romantic view of two people feeling each other out and slowly beginning to love one another. Even the scene on the beach when a naked Julie waits behind a rock for the brash Joseph, whom she's just met, to give her back her clothes brings a smile rather than a raised eyebrow. A scene where Julie keeps her pop from getting rolled at Mother Morgan's ""Boarding House"" but feels sorry for the girl and leaves her some money is not there for shock, but to show the heart and character of Julie.

Hobart Cavanaugh gives good support as Miller's often drunk news pal McCoy. Once Eli is shot and on the lam, Julie will have to choose between the man she once trusted and saving her father. The famous scene onboard the Santa Madre prison ship where a shakled Julie doesn't put up much of a fuss when Joseph finally gets the kisses he's been begging for is handled with sexy charm. A fine score which includes the famous title song adds to the special mood of this great pre-code classic. A must see film for Colbert fans and fans of pre-code films.",1187740800,17,2468,4.587301587301587
733397,4,6303934528,"This film, that is no real thriller but has to do with crime, shows how the smuggling of goods or people (in this case Chinese people) into American society is not done for any political or moral reason, but only to make a profit, even if it is paid by the smuggled people with hard cash or who may even die in the adventure. This film shows the responsibility of a journalist to expose such facts but he will encounter the resistance of many people. His boss first who will only question the quest from the viewpoint of the profit he can make out of it. His colleagues who only see him as running after glory and fame, if not money. Many other people in society who will see the journalist as a meddler in other people's business, even if this business is criminal. Finally this film shows how a dying father may decide to save the life of his worst enemy for the sake of his daughter's love. Love could be stronger than hatred and death.

7855964,4,6303934528,"""I Cover the Waterfront"" is a surprisingly good film noir find.

Claudette Colbert (playing Julie Kirk) is a knockout. She has great presence and warmth.
Ernest Torrence plays her dad (Eli Kirk) with a harsh earthy acting style, that is striking.
While Eli is a smuggler in human traffic, and a murderer for profit, he becomes a sympathetic character.

The dialogue is snappy and smart, most of it delivered by Ben Lyon as the reporter (Joe Miller) who ""covers the waterfront.""
Unfortunately, Ben does not have the gravitas to deliver Joe's pithy lines, which signify Joe's ungrateful, whining, and self-centered nature.
He is, however, able to fake a romance with Julie in order to entrap her father.

The story is engrossing, and, I'm told, risqu&eacute; for the movies of the 30s.
While the censors were squeamish, I suspect the general public of the day would not consider it so outlandish.

Director James Cruze made about 74 movies all together. He was also an actor with about 119 screen credits.

From IMDb:
""Many of the films Cruze directed in the 1920s and 1930s have been lost. He directed a large variety of films, from Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle slapstick two-reelers to suspense thrillers to big-budget epics. In 1929 he appeared before a grand jury in Los Angeles that was investigating an accident on one of his films in which one man was killed and others were injured, one of many run-ins Cruze had with the law. He used the name Cruze on screen, but in real life remained James Bosen.""

I watched the ""Digitally Remastered"" version, which is mediocre in image quality, tending toward the dark, with little detail in the shadow areas.

The music is by Alfred Newman, who is uncredited.

More from IMDb:
""The composition ""I Cover the Waterfront"" became a popular jazz standard, in both vocal and instrumental versions, and was performed and recorded by many bands and vocalists from the 1930s through the 1990s. Originally, the book the movie was based on inspired the tune; it was not written for the movie. However, the movie was re-scored just before its release to include the tune as an instrumental. Among those who have recorded the tune are Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and Ella Fitzgerald.""
""The failure of the original copyright holder to renew the film's copyright resulted in it falling into public domain, meaning that virtually anyone could duplicate and sell a VHS/DVD copy of the film. Therefore, many of the versions of this film available on the market are either severely (and usually badly) edited and/or of extremely poor quality, having been duped from second- or third-generation (or more) copies of the film.""

""What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?"" What happened to Eli's money? Rolled? Eli makes it home with help. Julie has a new gown from her father. Next morning she gets flowers. Miller calls in a story. They visit a prison ship ""Santa Madre"" and see the torture chamber. At sea a huge shark is lifted out of the water.

Julie arrives ""Is he the man?"" Will Julie leave Miller behind? No. Miller writes his story from a hospital bed. When he returns home he finds changes. They are acceptable.

The topics in this movie would be banned by the Hollywood Production Code of 1934. That makes this drama still censored today; you won't ever see it on PBS stations. Smuggling people into America goes on today. It's a business that brings low cost goods into an area where they bring higher prices. Sometimes its by ship in the San Diego area. Other times its by airplanes when radar is shut down for maintenance. The book ""Compromised"" tells about this in the mid-1980s. Read it and you'll know how it was done. A US Attorney-General had to resign when unlaundered money from drug smuggling was found in his personal checking account.",1443484800,,3105,4.579136690647482
