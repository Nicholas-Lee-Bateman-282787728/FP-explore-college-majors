Buy the old VHS, don't rent online.",1509753600,,123,4.636363636363637
8550831,2,B0000488V0,"As on of TGRs earliest films, it is also one of the greatest. Having owned the VHS I must have watched this movie 100 times.  I just bought the stream vision and the soundtrack is different that the original VHS version.  This is why I gave it 2 stars.  One of the best opening scenes of any ski film is the opening of this movie with Bob Marley's ""Trenchtown Rock""playing.  However this song has apparently been removed and changed.  Other songs have apparently been changed to other unknown grunge songs.  It ruins the whole vibe of the movie. Disappointing.",1482105600,,560,4.606060606060606
8550832,5,B0000488V0,"What a film!  There are many more famous Skiing videos than Teton Gravity  Research's Continuum, but non better.  Why ever is this not higher up the  mountain (sorry, sales chart)
The photography is stunning, the mountains  and skiing / boarding magnificant and the sound track - a little old now -  absolutely, positively kicking.
How did Todd Jones do that flying (AKA  Falling with style). You'll have to get the video to see what I mean - Buzz  Lightyear has nothing on this fellow!
If you like skiing or snowboarding,  both of which are treated even handedly - non of that silly partisan  moutainside snobbery here - this is the video for you.  Warren Miller - eat  your shorts - TGR forever!
Other TGR productions are worthy followers too  - with more (I would say too much, personally but then I know I'm weird)  attention given to tricks, X Games etc. but check out Harvest, The Realm,  Uprising - all worth the price and more.
If you're mental age is about  your shoe size get this video!",965260800,9,997,4.548022598870056
