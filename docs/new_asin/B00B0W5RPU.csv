5540546,5,B00B0W5RPU,"It's great to see a film the depicts the bear community in such a positive light. The chemistry between the cast is amazing and has only improved with time. I very much hope there is a third installment in this series, with all the original cast returning! You guys ROCK!",1370131200,,271,4.44
5540547,3,B00B0W5RPU,"Musclebear Roger and his twinkish boyfriend Tyler (who became a couple in the original 2010 ""Bear City"" film) decide to take advantage of NY's new gay marriage bill, despite some initial misgivings on Tyler's part.  Since they and most of their friends had already planned to be in Provincetown for ""Bear Week,"" they decided to hold the nuptuals there, staying in a guesthouse owned by Rose (Kathy Majimy), mother of their friend Brent (Stevem Guarino, who is one of the few bright spots in this misguided sequel). Lots going on amid the craziness in P-Town, including Brent and his partner interviewing attendees for a ""bear documentary"", and another couple making plans to open a new ""bear bar"" in NYC.

The middle part of the film seems like a P-Town tourist promotion, with local attractions and huge crowds also (over)filled with marginal gay celebrities, from Kevin Smith to Frank DeCaro, Jason Stuart to Mike Ruiz, Mark Caruso and even Lt. Dan Choi, making this seem more like a vanity project than any attempt at a cohesive story.  We do learn that, even within the bear community, there is an element of discrimination between ""muscle bears"" and their more portly brethren, except that both groups are equally unable to be monogamous in a relationship.  Tyler meets a chubby bear he seems to develop a connection with, and Roger spends time with an ex he previously swore he never wanted to see again.  The ending was not what I was expecting, and somewhat disappointing, although I suppose it illustrated a valuable lesson ... that two men should not decide to get married simply because their state decides they now CAN do so.

Besides the casting issues, the film seems disjointed in terms of pacing, more a series of skits than telling a story.  Some scenes clearly go on way too long, and add nothing to the film other than additional minutes. Some funny bits are milked too long (such as people calling Tyler's father, who is there for the ceremony, ""Daddy"", and how a threesome of bears next door needs a really large bed).  Most of all, the assorted disagreements and uncomfortable confrontations often overshadow the camaraderie of the bear community, which was an important selling point in the original film.

DVD has a ""making of"" featurette, deleted scenes, director commentary and music videos; it is also subtitled in 15 languages!  Not rated, would be a heavy R for sexual content (No nudity).  I'm somewhat generous in giving it three stars out of five.",1369094400,8,2479,4.864608076009501
5540548,5,B00B0W5RPU,"I really enjoyed watching BearCity, so when I found out there was a sequel I had to have it too! And was lucky to find this copy when I did. All the fun and drama and more returns. In Short if you loved the first then you'll love it. A must for any Bear!",1369094400,,254,3.7222222222222223
5540549,4,B00B0W5RPU,Fun and busy and more furry eye candy than the first run.  The best part is Kathy Najimy.  She is most excellent.  I laughed and teared up but typical gay guys don't know what they want.  Its worth a watch fur sure.,1368748800,,215,4.0476190476190474
5540550,4,B00B0W5RPU,Movie was okay ending kind of sucked if you ask me. Provincetown looked great that is why I got the movie. It was a promotional ad for P town,1440633600,,141,3.896551724137931

5540554,5,B00B0W5RPU,Great Movie!!!,1430870400,,14,6.5
5540555,4,B00B0W5RPU,"This sequel is fun and has a better, slick production value than the original which was much more like a really good indie flick.  The ending was not much of a surprise but happy none the less.  The ""Bear City"" franchise is a wonderful idea and in my opinion would make a GREAT cable network series in the same vein as Queer as Folk.  Showtime, Starz or HBO should be knocking on Doug Langway's door. It is refreshing to see gay men portrayed as something other than twinks, drag queens or gym addicts.  The writing is rather clich in spots with many instances of forced, ridiculous dialogue and too many shots of muscle bears who play major to insignificant roles but lots of scenes featuring real ""bears"" as props with no dialogue at all.  I give Doug Langway a lot of credit for the effort he put into these movies and all of the people who funded this venture.  I hope there will be a Bear City 3.  How about Bear City 3: Road Trip! or Bear City 3: Honeymooners!",1422835200,,966,4.333333333333333

5540571,5,B00B0W5RPU,"Thought this was a very fitting sequel to BearCity, with a surprise ending.  I guess it can stand alone but it does help the back story if you have seen BearCity first.",1384387200,,168,4.25
5540572,3,B00B0W5RPU,"If you are GAY and into the BEAR COMMUNITY then you almost have to buy this DVD as part of your continuning support of the Community. Well, it was OK. But the Original Film BEARCITY (CLICK on this to see the original ->&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BearCity/dp/B0050XFZJ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BearCity</a>&nbsp;) was so much better (5 stars) that I had to buy this sequel just to see what happened to these fictional persons I have come to love from the original film. I could go on and explain how the various actors disappointed me in the lack of development of these very interesting persons created in BEARCITY I; but I suspect that is not their fault as much as it is the fault of the writers. If there is a BEARCITY III, I would take a chance on it; but IT MUST BE BETTER WRITTEN! Maybe I could help! I write screenplays!",1379808000,2,879,4.98639455782313
5540573,5,B00B0W5RPU,"SPOILER  ALERT: You must watch Bear City  before you watch Bear City 2!!!!! (Note: a kiss from Bear City is now on YouTube)
I love the movie Bear City, and recognized that a sequel would be created.  It was so good to see my favorite Bears again and how they had grown and changed with the trials life sent to them.  2 years have passed since our Bears have settled into their new lives. Unsurprisingly, Roger pops the question to Tyler, who somewhat reluctantly answers yes.  A new adventure begins as Roger, Tyler, Fred, Brent, Michael, Carlos and Simon set off for Bear Week at Provincetown, Massachusetts. We meet Brents mother and Tylers mom and dad (who learns a new meaning for Daddy) the plan is to tie the knot during Bear Week.  Old friendships are renewed, new friends are made and love is in the air. Life once again serves surprises all around for my favorite Bears!",1378252800,,879,4.531645569620253

5540575,1,B00B0W5RPU,They should have stopped at the first. It was one huge clich after another.  If this is what's become of the bear community count me out.,1377734400,2,137,4.269230769230769
