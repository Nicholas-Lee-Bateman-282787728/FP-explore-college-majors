8053150,4,B0007X9U60,"Told with re-enactors this is the story of a millionaire with no tech experience who wants to connect North America to the rest of the world via a Transatlantic cable in the 1850's as contact with Europe takes two weeks via ship. He gathers investors and materials then goes about stretching cable across the Atlantic Ocean. Initial success is met with the realities of technology and the public wonders if the whole thing was a hoax.

He aspires to redo the process and again faces difficulties. Insight into the challenges of advancing tech and the public's perception.",1493251200,,571,4.88659793814433

8053153,5,B0007X9U60,The video provides a good history of the laying of the first transatlantic telegraph cable. It covers the technical and financial problems of the project and how they were solved.,1196467200,3,179,5.0
8053154,4,B0007X9U60,"This was a wonderful story of human perseverence and innovation, well told, with more than its share of twists and turns, but...

I wanted more.  I wanted a feel for the science. I filled it in myself, but what a wonderful, and lost, opportunity to explain why the signal was so weak when the cable was submerged, under great pressure, and chilled to sea-bottom temperatures.  When the story reached the inquiry, the invention of new science was touched... and left unexplored.

The challenges described in this story were matched, maybe even exceeded, by the challenges glossed over.  The heroes on the the Great Eastern who diagnosed the problem, retrieved miles of cable, evaluated the options, looked for the information they needed, and decided what to do.  Oh, how I wanted more...

Even so, watch this. Think for yourself what the people that worked for Cyrus Field on this great adventure had to accomplish, and enjoy the sense of real work, with many unknowns, well accomplished.

It was Cyrus' story, and the story of unsung others...",1192147200,6,1044,4.925714285714286
8053155,5,B0007X9U60,"This was such an amazing story. I have watched it twice now, and it is so facinating.",1170115200,2,85,4.0588235294117645
8053156,5,B0007X9U60,"This documentary is an eye-opening story of laying a cable across the Atlantic in the 1850s...a process that was successfully completed 13 years later. Little did I know that a penny was soldered to the cable in the middle of the Atlantic for good luck! This story is from a time when the lightbulb had yet to arrive in homes and a paper (yes, paper!) merchant was crazy enough, motivated enough, and hopeful enough that he could do it. He went broke in the process, lost all his friends, but finally got the cable to work 13 years later. When it did work, he and his disillusioned backers made more money in the venture that anyone could have guessed. This was also the first steps of the company we today know as AT&T. Sadly enough, this guy (Mr. Fields) lost most of his personal fortune on Wall Street a few years later. In my books, this is a classic story of what makes us a nation of risk takers, adventurers, and disbelievers in impossibilities. While there might be little reason to own this exceptionally-well made documentary, it is surely worth borrowing from your neighborhood store and watching.",1163203200,7,1109,4.634517766497462
