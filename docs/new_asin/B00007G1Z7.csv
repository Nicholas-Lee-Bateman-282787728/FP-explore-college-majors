7976053,3,B00007G1Z7,"This a pretty good movie but not for everyone as it has sex, drugs and violence. It is not overtly distasteful in presentation but a caution should be given to those sensitive to some nudity, drug scenes  and blood. The story evolves around Andy and Tomas, a couple of young, hip guys in advertising who make commercials for a firm called Trippy  . After winning an award the two men who are from another country celebrate their Argentina victory with a party. Prior to the party the married men(they call their wives) arrange for a couple of young call girls to visit them for the party before the party. The tatooed, young and equally hip looking women are Marisol and Zuky who like drugs and apparently each other. The young men arrange for a woman dealer to come over to get everyone ""in the mood."" The dealer is known as La Toucan, and for my viewing pleasure steals every scene she is in with her superb performance, as a strung out drugie. She is impishly cute and is supposed to be high on some type of psychedelic throughout he movie. As the foursome party begins in the mansion, a couple of burglars enter the home who are father and son. La Toucan observes this from her hidden view  and tries to save the day. She inadvertently slits the thoat of one of the call girls who was in the bathroom and in her high state proceeds to carry on a one way conversation with a semi-conscious Zuky. Anyway mapcap adventures begin in the mansion as the father and son team try to keep their captives at bay. Through a series of flashbacks we find out why the sympathetic burglars are doing the bad deed. The burglars make for a tragic story. Eventually the tables are turned and the real party begins with lots of people only to be broken up by a couple of policemen who we see sitting in their parked car in front of the house throughout the movie. The policemans conversations throughout the movie  are hilarious. In the end there are no winners as this story of decadence comes to brutal conclusion and we are left with the image of La Toucan laughing and still high. There is some very interesting photography to portray the hallucinatory visions of La Toucan, and a moral tale is buried amidst the garbage. Overall  it is a pretty good movie if you are in the mood for sex, drugs and violence. This movie will appeal more to a younger audience but should not neccessarily be limited to the under thirty set.",1050364800,5,2411,4.470454545454546
