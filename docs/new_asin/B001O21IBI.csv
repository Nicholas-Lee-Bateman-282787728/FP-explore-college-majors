3725764,5,B001O21IBI,"This video series is incredibly thorough and interesting.  Although the author is simply videotaped delivering this information to an audience, he is engaging and knowledgable. He adds interesting pieces of trivia. There is no doubt that he is an historic scholar on this information.  It's presented in a straightforward manner.  He is not preaching our trying to convert the viewer to the Catholic religion; he just states what happened through history. I recommend the study set to go along with the CDs, having a reference map to look at is very helpful.",1263081600,25,558,5.043478260869565

Other than that, it was a good course of study. I just had to improvise the last session so as not to offend anybody.",1495324800,,256,4.14
8328834,5,B001O21IBI,"This is a study we are doing in our local parish.  We began with the 10 disc set by Mr. Weidenkopf on the Early Church, then we took up where we left off with that in this study, Session 6.  It was a perfect break from the one where the other resumed.  It tells you something of the thoughtfulness that Mr. Weidenkopf demonstrates throughout the sessions we have covered so far.

People have loved this study, finding it very fascinating.  I commend Mr. Weidenkopf for his judgement and discernment in the choices he makes in what he covers and how he covers it and his subtle handling of difficult subjects.  I am impressed with the idiosyncratic approach at times, and of his bold and definitive delivery.  As a Catholic he is not an absolute apologist, but obviously loves his subject and its traditions and impresses one with his even handedness.  So far thanks to this work, the vastness of the Catholic Church history has become at once manageable, accurately portrayed--as well as relevant for us Catholic's of today to know and live with as present in our lives.",1414540800,3,1070,4.654255319148936
8328835,3,B001O21IBI,"At $300, I expected this series to be more than someone talking at a podium. Maybe even a few photographs thrown in, showing the places the speaker talks about would have been helpful. A CD set would have been just as good and cheaper, and I could have listened to it in my car! To be fair, I think the information and perspective presented were good for someone who doesn't know much about church history (like myself), but I am getting more from reading church history books (Didache and the Laux books).  If using this for children (suggest no younger than 7th grade) you need to supplement this with a more engaging curriculum - lots of maps, pictures, videos with re-enactments (many free on public library websites) and LOTS of discussion.",1405468800,6,745,4.687022900763359

8328837,1,B001O21IBI,"I entirely agree with W. LaRue.  I bought Epic for my husband, who is a history major, for Christmas.  After watching half of the study, we have decided not to continue.  We had expected to hear an honest interpretation and evaluation of the progress of the Church to date.  The series makes it sound like the hierarchical part of the Church has nearly always been off center.  The atrocities committed by the Church were glossed over.  It truly seems amazing that the Church has endured through its leadership.  In the end we felt embarrassed about the Church and don't feel we have gained any useful apologetics.  I think Ascension Press should take it off the market.  It doesn't further the cause of the New Evangelism.",1368316800,,723,4.72
8328838,5,B001O21IBI,"This was recommended to my wife as a vital overview of Catholic church history. It seems expensive, but has a huge volume to cover and is a wealth of information. We have given several of these to friend.",1356912000,2,204,4.394736842105263
8328839,5,B001O21IBI,"A thorough an accurate presentation of the church's history. Each session begins with prayer.  The presenter quotes from a variety of authoritative sources (Church fathers, secular historians, saints, teaching magesterium), and provides material for everyone to gain more knowledge and understanding of the Catholic faith.",1340582400,6,322,6.155555555555556

I'm grateful that I had both approaches to draw knowledge from as the differences highlighted what another reviewer described as poor coverage and excessive defensiveness in the Epic presentation.

Although I certainly do appreciate the need to know history as a means to defend our faith, if we base our defense in a needlessly distorted version of history - we put ourselves in danger of becoming bigoted and turning sincere inquirers away from the faith due to our own errors.

Here are some samples of what I would consider problematic approaches in Steve Weidenkopf's presentation.

* In session 6, the description of Islam concentrated only the negative aspects of Islam. I think any proper discourse on Islam at this point in history should at least mention the tolerance the Koran exhorts to be given to Jews and Christians living among Muslims.

* In session 7, it was stated that the heresy of Monothelitism, the idea that Jesus has two natures but only one will, was obviously false. I think the distinction between that and what we believe is hardly obvious and requires careful scholastic study. Those who were brought into this error are not to be quickly discarded as stupid as his statement, and non-verbal cues, imply.

* In session 11, Steve presented a highly questionable argument that the great plague killed all the good clergy and spared the bad clergy and, furthermore, this this was a leading cause to the corruption that preceded the protestant reformation. I think this is highly speculative at best, and a cop out at worst.

* In session 12, I was very unimpressed with the glee Steve used in deriding Jan Hus, a man who bravely died at Catholic hands for not renouncing what he believed. Although there is no doubt Jan Hus was in error, I think this manner of dehumanizing those whose blood we have on our hands is the wrong mentality to impart on faithful Catholics.

* In session 14 Martin Luther's character was attacked to the point of mocking and absurdity. I quote, ""He also suffered from such physical ailments as constipation, indigestion, hemorrhoids, severe kidney stones, and a buzzing in his ears"". I think Martin Luther's comments and actions speak loudly enough against his point of view. There is no need to debase ourselves by bringing up his constipation. Who doesn't get constipation now and then?

Smoke and mirrors are used to downplay anything that threatens Catholicisim and to justify anything that supports it. For example, although he rightfully devalues the inquisition by observing it in its historical context, he neglects to do the same when accusing Muhammad of being a child molester for marrying a young girl: a practice that wouldn't have raised an eyebrow in that culture and time period.

Overall, although this DVD series fills an obvious void in Catholic catechesis, I think the presentation betrays the fact that Catholics believe that God is Truth. There is never a need to distort it or cower from it. In fact, the truth serves the Catholic point of view very well. So lets stick to it!

While we wait for a more scholarly and unprejudiced DVD series, I highly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-History-of-the-Church-The-Didache-Series/dp/1890177466/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The History of the Church (The Didache Series)</a>&nbsp;as an alternative for learning about the Catholic Church's history.",1302998400,42,3964,5.635906040268456
8328841,5,B001O21IBI,I have to say I believe EVERY Catholic should do this study after Great Adventure bible timeline by Jeff Cavins and if the bible timeline and the church history timeline were given in every church I think we would have alot less confused Catholics out there.  It gives perspective of how far we've come as the body of Christ,1287100800,14,324,4.491525423728813
8328842,1,B001O21IBI,"I have attended courses based on other materials from Ascension Press and have found them to be of high quality and very informative. When our parish announced that this course was to be given I signed up right away and eagerly anticipated more of the same quality scholarship. Boy was I wrong!!!

The first presentation explained that the course would be history as seen by the Roman Catholic Church. That should have been a dead giveaway, but I didn't pick up on the import of that statement. Almost from the beginning things didn't sound ""right"", and checking with other trusted sources indicated that important parts of the story being told were left out or minimized (invariably those parts that reflected negatively on the Church). Other areas, notably the early heretical events were expanded upon ad nauseum, once again with important information left out. As the course progressed, it seemed that anything that was negative was minimized or simply not mentioned. Anything that supported the idea of centralized power was hammered home again and again. There was mention of some ""weak"" popes and some ""bad"" popes, but for the most part the course was invariably sympathetic to the papacy. There was no real treatment of the rise of temporal power after the fall of Rome, and the split between the Eastern and Roman sectors of the Church was poorly covered as well. The Gnostic movement was repeatedly mentioned, but the influence of that heresy on development of attitudes within the Church was not developed well.

The authors of the course seemed to have decided that the offical Vatican explanation of the character of the Crusades, the Inquisitions, and the sad state of the Church in Luther's time is all they need to teach in this series of DVD's. The revisionist aspects of this segment of the course, and the absolute trashing of Martin Luther were appalling in their lack of true scholarship. Each segment of the course seemed to become more and more an exercise in propaganda, rather than providing information that a rational Catholic could use to develop a balanced view of the Church and its history.

I had hoped that the treatment of more modern events would be somewhat better, but once again the developers of the course failed. From their astonishingly bad portrayal of the conquest of the new world to their treatment of the rise of the secular state in modern Europe, the omission of anything that would cast the slightest negative light on the Church or anyone associated with the Church showed that this was nothing less than an exercise in half truth being better than the whole story. I realized that although the course was presenting facts, it was leaving out more than it presented. When several members of the class complained about these problems our coordinator stated that because of the broad scope of the timeline some things naturally were glossed over.

The final straw was the treatment of events in the 20th century. By this point in the course the authors dropped all pretense of objectivity and came out with guns blazing on every issue: the Church was just misunderstood, the Church's enemies were trying to make trouble for the Church, Satan was responsible for sowing error in the midst of clerics, and Vatican II caused problems. A prime example of this type of partial truth telling was the depiction of Pope Paul VI's Humani Generis encyclical; the presenter stated that the Pope set up a commission to study the problem and then wrote his missive on birth control - conveniently leaving out the fact that the commission recommended by an overwhelming majority to allow birth control, and the minority based their objections on the fact that to allow birth control would fly in the face of papal infallibility, not on the contraception issue itself.

The bottom line is that if you wish to learn or teach Church History you can do a lot better, and equip students with knowledge that will serve them well in trying to understand the Church in the modern world by avoiding this poorly developed product which doesn't rise to the level of the other Ascension Press products available.",1272412800,27,4135,4.893009985734665
