In the past sixty years, this tiny country has been through a fifteen year long brutal civil war, Israeli and Syrian occupations, American interventions and still to be explained multiple political assassinations. ""Beirut Diaries & 33 Days"" fills an important gap in the documentation of events that have a political importance disproportional to the geographic size of the Lebanese nation. This DVD basically consists of two movies. The first addresses the national mobilization that followed the assassination of the former Prime-Minister Rafik Hariri. The second is a first hand account of the war of 2006 between Israel and Lebanon. This is not movie for those who want a ""balanced"" analysis of either historical period. There are multiple books that attempt an analytical approach. Instead, Ms. Masri provides the viewer with first hand, real-time, and personal accounts of the events. I bought this DVD to expose myself to the Arabic language and ended up with a visceral experience about the sadness of war and the human resilience in the face of massive destruction. I was reminded of the insanity of the human proclivity to war when just after finishing watching this documentary showing desolation made with American weaponry, I read the news that the just elected Miss USA was a Lebanese born woman originally from the south of Lebanon. Ms. Masri's documentary about the conflict was done under bombardment and bears witness to the experience of an essentially defenseless civilian population facing total catastrophe. Just for her valiant  effort, the movie deserves five stars. Regardless of what side you are, movies like this remind us that the real enemy is war itself. A last word: if you suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder related to events like 9/11 or being in a war, this movie definitely is not for you.",1274572800,3,1898,5.142394822006472
