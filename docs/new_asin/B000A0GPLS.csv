8071357,5,B000A0GPLS,"Joaqun Pardav, who directs this movie, was one of the most idolized actors of my youth.  Rumor has it that he was buried alive by mistake and the fatal error discovered when his tomb was reopened. Marga Lpez is the ""arrabalera"" of the title, which doesn't mean ""street woman"" but simply, girl from the arrabal, a poor neighborhood.  Fernando Fernandez was not exactly known for his looks or acting skills, but oh, boy, could he ever sing!  And sing he does, the bolero that gives its title to the film.  Much in the vein of Pedro Infante's immortal trilogy, ""Arrabalera"" chronicles the confrontation between the evil, cold-hearted rich and the honest and loving poor.  Guess who wins!  This kind of movie is the direct predecessor of Latin American soaps.",1219881600,5,755,4.813953488372093
