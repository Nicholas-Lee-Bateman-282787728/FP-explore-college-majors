I wish I could give this tape more than just Two Stars, because the first of the two episodes of 'Explorer Woman Ray'  contained on it is truly top-notch. It is *exactly* what a 'Tomb Raider'  cartoon should be like if such an item is ever made.
The story in the  first episode is tight, the animation is top-notch, even bit-players in the  supporting cast are interesting characters, and the action keeps coming  fast and furious.
Unfortunately, the second episode on the tape is as bad  as the first one is good. The story is dull and plodding, the animation is  about the level of 'Thunder Cats,' the characters are uninteresting (even  the ones that were charming in the first episode), and the action scenes  feel forced and are universally poorly conceived.
This is one video that  started with a bang and went out with a whimper. And, sadly, the good does  not manage to outweigh the bad.",951696000,,999,4.651428571428571
