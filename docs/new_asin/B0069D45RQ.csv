8495273,3,B0069D45RQ,"This Underwater movie was not what I expected for such an attractive front cover display. I have viewed this movie and have seen many common sea creatures,  but it is fast,moving quickly from creature to creature with narration partly educational from scene to scene with very poor visual definition. The First section of this three parts program was taken from ( Nature's Treasures) Series. Old Video tape transferred to DVD is very likely. I bought this from a Amazon marketplace seller listed as (New) and received a burnt DVD copy and paid a steep price, $27.37 including Shipping. I suggest you look elsewhere and I recommend Reef Life Of The Andaman with Nick Hope ,Or Undersea Edens by Smithsonians Channel,Two of my favorites in my collection.",1384128000,,751,4.9603174603174605
