3520345,2,B001CW8020,"Avid Patriots fans will snap this one up i'm sure. I enjoyed it, but was left feeling a little short-changed. I'm a lifelong fan of the team and it was fantastic to see the first half hour of this DVD. The old footage of Gino and Babe Parilli etc, playing before all those empty seats at Fenway in the days of the Boston Patriots. Priceless. It's great to see this rare old footage, and its the reason i wanted to buy this DVD as soon as it came out. Unfortunately this was the only real highlight of the whole DVD. Where this DVD falls short for me is the brief run-through the 70's and 80's. These were very poor years for the team, with the exception of '76, '78 and '85. I will grant NFL films allowance for that. However, remember that this is what the team was. Poor! A bunch of no-hope failures. It was still our team, and we loved them regardless. The 85 season is not covered in too much detail, which is a shame as for most fans in their 30's and '40's like me, this was a legendary season to remember. The only time the pats looked halfway decent in their history. This wild card on the road victory procession to the Super Bowl was only given a short look. Why? And where is the profile of great Pats legends and Pro Bowlers from this era, like John Hannah, Steve Nelson, Steve Grogan, Andre Tippet etc. ? Because they didn't win a Super Bowl does that make them ineligible to be on this DVD?

Then we get on to another fairly brief look at the Parcells era, 96 and our second Super Bowl failure, then it's all Belichick era for the remainder of the DVD. Of course its great to see the Super Bowl wins again, but if you own any other Pats DVDs, it's nearly all stuff you've seen a hundred times before, and nothing new that you don't have at home already. The DVD running time is over two hours, but around an hour and 25 minutes is just Belichick era pats. To be honest it left me a little bit disappointed as i wanted to see the full history, not just the most recent history of the franchise from 2002 to now. It's like the Patriots didn't really exist before we knocked off the Rams in XXXVI.

That said, there are some good extras on disc two that i guarantee a few of which you won't have seen. Again though, if you have any other Pats DVDs, you'll already have over half of them. It all adds up to a bit of a cash-in on old material that's already been available on the market for years.

The Patriots deserved a little bit better. If you're a new pats fan or don't already own any other Pats DVDs from NFL Films, then this is really a great DVD. For the rest of us, you'll have seen most of it before.",1228521600,61,2621,4.165680473372781
3520346,4,B001CW8020,"Honestly, I have yet to see it! But hey, it is already a great idea to have a historical DVD for the team (and for all other teams too!) so I will give four stars just for the effort!

Maybe people now only know the Pats as a great team; or ""the team to hate""; but guys like me have seen the bad old days, haha! So here, you will see the good, the bad and the ugly!

I would really want it to show Doug Flutie in the old uniform AND the new uniform! I bet he is the only guy that played for the Pats then and ""now""!",1226534400,,515,3.672727272727273
3520347,4,B001CW8020,"I have the complete collection of this historic dvds, and I'm really want to know about the history of the pats. This is the elite of pro-football, thanks God that last year they lost the Super Bowl, if not they will be the best dinasty ever... and with the highest level of all time... I'm a Dolphin fan for so many years and to be honest, I hate the pats, but now I reconignize the incredible good team that the Patriots are and now I like it and also, I expect them to win another super bowl.

So I'm waiting for this new DVD... So for now the only undefeated team is the Miami Dolphins from 1971...

Please NFL, we want the Miami Dolphins complete history soon !!!",1216857600,,668,4.2109375

3520368,4,B001CW8020,Excellent history of the Patriots. I really enjoyed seeing the films of the old days which reminded me how bad they were when I was growing up. I'm taking a star away because for some unfathomable reason the screen is cropped with black bars on both sides and its not in full screen format. So it looks cheap.,1423785600,3,309,4.344827586206897

3520382,5,B001CW8020,"I'm a 23 year old Pats fan and have really only been around during the Brady and Bledsoe eras.  I found this DVD to be very interesting and I learned a lot that I didn't know before.  It spends a good amount of time in each era in the Pats history, going through each decade and the biggest moments.  Some of the reviews complained that it focuses too much on the 2000's, but considering that the Pats won 3 Super Bowls, and made the playoffs 8 times in the decade, more than all other decades combined, it is only fair.  Most of the special features are good, but some of them are repeats from the Super Bowl Champion DVD's, such as the bios on Gino and Steve Grogan.",1298332800,12,668,4.1953125
3520383,5,B001CW8020,"Got this for my brother and he loves it!  I actually got these for my family for Christmas last year, purchased the Broncos, Patriots and the Cowboys.  All of them were awesome.  If you have a football fan at home this is the PERFECT gift!!!",1291507200,,241,4.311111111111111

3520387,5,B001CW8020,"I havn't been around on this earth long enough to witness most of the years of the New England Patriots, but fortunately during my lifetime I'm able to enjoy the greatest era of the team's legacy! It's amazing to think that for many years the Patriots were a team that nobody thought much of but of course now that has all changed but it's GREAT to look back with this DVD set on how the Pats were born & how they've evolved over the years. And by no means does this seem like a quick summary, there is quite a lot of info not only describing the many seasons, but also a lot of detail to key games & moments, players, coaches, not only explained narratively but also from the lips of the players & personnel themselves! And as a bonus, the second DVD contains several segments regarding Bill Belichick, Teddy Bruschi, Rodney Harrison, history of Foxboro Stadium & The Snow Bowl. For die hard pats fans this is 100% worth every penny!",1229990400,8,934,4.404624277456647
