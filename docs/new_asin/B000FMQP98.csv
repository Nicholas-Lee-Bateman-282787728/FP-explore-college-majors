8124739,5,B000FMQP98,"As Lynn Anderson herself says at the beginning this was/is her first DVD. Since I was about 14 or so I have been a serious fan. I saw her once in the late 1970's or very early 1980/1981 at the Capri Ballroom in Atlanta. My table was no more than four to eight feet from her at any given time. I own every vinyl album she has and many, many of her CDs. This is not the Lynn with the voice that made her the Country Lady singer of the 1970-1980 decade.
However, Lynn Anderson still sings extremely well in this performance. Her voice falters a bit here and there but she is vibrant and enthusiastic the whole way through. There are some of her hits that I would love to have seen her sing. Columbia hits included are: Listen To A Country Song, How Can I Unlove You, What A Man, My Man Is, Top Of The World and of course her signature smash Rose Garden. She included several of her Chart label hits as well as some Western (cowboy/cowgirl) songs. If you like or love Lynn Anderson this a must have. There is also a 20 song CD included which includes a few more of her greatest hits from her Columbia recording years such as Keep Me In Mind, I've Never Loved Anyone More and Fool Me. There are also some covers like: Close To You (The Carpenters), Midnight Train To Georgia, Silver Threads and Golden Needles. Her Chart label years are also represented with: If I Kiss You (Will You Go Away), I've Been Everywhere Man and Ride, Ride, Ride.

This a terrific addition to any country collection and with a 17 song DVD and a 20 song CD a must have for any Lynn Anderson fan!",1434758400,,1566,4.22
