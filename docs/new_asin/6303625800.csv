But, alas, the wholesome has given way to the likes of Attack of the Barnyard animals. This film is arguably  Laurel and Hardy at their comic best.",911952000,,255,4.666666666666667

715121,5,6303625800,"The 3D version of this film does not have any dramatic pop out moments.  However, you do get the feeling that you are looking out of a window into a dimensional, fairy tale world where space and depth exists.  The colorization is subtle.  No one would mistake it for true color but it adds a nice magical touch to this 1934 film.  The picture and sound quality is surprisingly good.  There are some very brief soft focus moments, especially in crowd scenes, but this is obviously inherent from the original film negative.  I have never seen this film looking as good before.  Even the musical numbers, which I found boring as a child, are now enjoyable to me.  The color and 3D helps.  Even though there are no extras, I strongly recommend this version of this beloved classic.",1519516800,,777,4.572463768115942

715262,4,6303625800,"Altough it's not the actual ""Babes in Toyland"" plot, many of the characters are the same and the story is appealing.
The film adapted much of the original Herbert's score and songs such as ""Toyland"" and ""Go To Sleep, Slumber Deep"" find their way flawlessly into the new plot.

715374,5,6303625800,Would rather have had it in CD format. Now I have to find someone who can transfer from VHS to CD so I can watch it. And I think colorizing it cheapened it. Try doing it to a copy of Citizen Kane or Casablanca.,1509235200,,210,3.7954545454545454

My best friend didn't have hardly any Christmas movies, so March of the Wooden Soldiers was one of the holiday films I bought her for a 2016 Christmas present.",1501200000,2,381,4.291666666666667
715463,5,6303625800,"Some like it colored and some don't. Ether way this based on a 1903 Victor Herbert operetta, film released in 1934 as ""Babes in Toyland,"" and is still fun to watch.

Now the basic plot is to keep Mother Peep's (Florence Roberts) shoe from being foreclosed on by the evil landlord Silas Barnaby (Henry Brandon) when this fails Bo Peep has to marry Barnaby to keep the shoe. Now to keep Little Bo Peep from having to marry Barnaby, it involves Barnaby being tricked into marrying Stanley Dum dressed up as Bo in Bo Peep's place. Naturally Barnaby can not be fooled long and must have his revenge by letting lose the bogeymen from their caverns to destroy Toyland.

Does he succeed in his evil ways?
Who can stop him and how?

The video files of the two versions found the Blu-ray disc, that is the black and white and the colorized versions, look very awful. By awful I mean, the files were originally compressed a lot (say by 60 or 70%) so they have a lot of compression artifacts making them look very blurred and not crisp at all, as if they are out of focus. But, what I'm guessing here is that It looks more as if the same files of the DVD were blown up to fit the Blu-ray, a very cheap solution.

716913,5,6303625800,"Having read the book from our local library I was curious as to what the movie would be like. Most times the movie is not as good as the book but not this time. The movie is the BEST! We watched this as a family and everyone enjoyed it. I am sure we are going to have a lot of imaginative play around here and endless talk over the next few days based on March of the Wooden Soldiers.

If you like the character of Scrooge you will also like the character of Barnaby in this motion picture. Barnaby holds the mortgage on Mother Peep's shoe. Poor Mother Peep has no money to pay. Ollie and Stannie (Laurel and Hardy) try to help! Meanwhile Barnaby asks Little Bo Peep for her hand in marriage but she is not interested one bit. Instead she agrees to marry Tom-Tom Piper. However with no money to pay the mortgage and Ollie and Stannie in trouble with King Cole, Little Bo Peep feels pressured into accepting Barnaby's proposition in exchange for the release of Ollie and Stannie plus the full payment of the mortgage.

Is there any way out? Ollie and Stannie are not giving up. Barnaby is tricked! However he comes back with a dirty trick of his own which lands Tom-Tom in Bogeyland! The chase is on! Our 8 year old daughter was scared of the bogeymen in this part but the boys (12 and 5) thought they were great!

Where do the wooden soldiers come into this? Well, the order for Santa was wrongly interpreted. Instead of 600 one foot soldiers as ordered, 100 six foot soldiers were made by the toymakers! These ""guys"" are BIG and will march through everything. See them 'fight' the bogeymen at the end.

A truly delightful, family classic. Please note that this review is for the 1934 color version of March of the Wooden Soldiers, the original Babes in Toyland. See if you can spot all your favorite nursery rhyme characters!

As you watch this please keep in mind that this is OLD footage. None of the film looks like a movie that is filmed today. Sometimes the faces of the characters are blurred when seen in the distance. (Up close footage is clear.) BUT we need to be grateful that this has been saved and converted to color for us to continue to watch with our families for years to come. There are many comic moments with Laurel and Hardy that will at least have you smiling if not laughing!",1429315200,,2299,4.387323943661972

This pack had both black and white and color which was nice for the B&W purists.( I also have Its A Wonderful Life in color and black & white. Having a choice between colorized or not is nice.)
Laural and Hardy are at their comedic best in this vintage movie. The music is great. The story is simple but pleasing. It's really not much of a Christmas movie, which is nice for those who don't celebrate, though Santa and Elves do make an appearance and are somewhat in the plot. Loved the costuming of the storybook characters. The special effects are primitive but good for the time. The set design is also imaginative.

I know that many people have the argument that a black and white movie was only meant to be that way, however my contention is that the movie producers of that time did not have a colorized option available to them, or could not afford the new technology.

Well, the last few years that hasn't been the case.  After ordering the dvd from Amazon, we were pleasantly surprised to find out that Amazon included a FREE instant video access to this movie via  our Amazon T.V. or any of our other devices at home.  We got to watch the movie before it even arrived at our home.  This movie is awesome. It's a true classic and now we get to pass it on to our kids.  Our kids loved this movie and have been watching it over and over again.  It's nice to see another generation enjoy these type of movies without all the nonsense seen in most modern programming.  I am not a huge fan of colorization but this colorization is excellent.  The entire movie looks great and sounds great.

I can't comment on the quality of the newer Legends version vs the Goodtimes version but color made a big difference. If any movie is meant to be seen in color then March of the Wooden Soldiers is it.  Toyland has plenty of eye-candy that is enhanced with the colorization. Few films used color around that time.. I have seen still photos (in color) of the movie set and it is obvious that the film lost some visual impact with the B&W filming.
I understand that some people do not like colorization but I disagree with this particular film.  And I do love films with good B&W cinematography.",1418860800,,844,4.496732026143791

If you are not familiar with the movie - it is comedians Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy living in Toyland, a Mother Goose fairytale land (with Bo Peep, Old Lady in the Shoe, Tom-Tom, 3 Little Pigs, Jack and Jill, etc) trying to help raise mortgage money for the Woman in the Shoe (their landlord); Toyland being attacked by the bogeymen; and the wooden soldiers go on the march to rescue Toyland.

718168,3,6303625800,"This review is for the Legend Films ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" Blu-ray.

Despite the cover boldly proclaiming that the film has been ""Spectacularly restored in color and black-&-white!"" and a blurb on the back saying that it was ""Remastered in high definition from rare 35mm film"", the quality of this release is poor.  The image lacks detail, lines are fuzzy, and obvious compression artifacts make it appear that a standard definition recording was simply upscaled to HD to make this ""spectacularly restored"" version.  If they really did remaster this from original 35mm prints like they claim then they did a terrible job.

The colorization isn't bad, about par for the course for this sort of thing.  Films that were originally intended to be watched in black and white will never look right with color digitally slapped across them since the (often gaudy) colors draw your eye to details that the director never intended for you to focus on.  Thankfully this disc also includes a black and white version of the film which, in my opinion, is vastly superior to the colorized version even if it, too, suffers from the same lack of detail and fuzziness as the colorized version.

The film itself, however, is as charming and fun as ever.  So 5-stars for the timeless genius of Laurel and Hardy, but 3-stars for the people who produced this less than spectacular ""restoration"".",1417737600,,1382,4.901287553648069

Laurel and Hardy reminded me of Ralph Kramden and Norton, so you know that Jackie Gleason an Art Carnie probably were inspired by them.  There were a lot of scenes that reminded me of the Wizard of Oz, and since it came out 5 years before The Wizard of Oz, I now realize that it was an inspiration for that, too.

718579,5,6303625800,This is a great re-mastering of a classic.  I can remember watching this on TV in the 50's at Christmas and was very happy to see it available now.  The set comes with a black and white and a colorized version.,1414540800,,210,4.097560975609756
718580,5,6303625800,"If you want nostalgia overload, or just an Xmas gift for an older person, this is a great option for you. You've probably heard of the story before, so just a quick overview of it: its based on the opperetta Babes in Toyland. Silas Barnaby tries to evict Mother Peep due to non payment. A common problem a lot of people can relate to in this economy, on both ends. Although the movie tries to make Barnaby evil by this alone, it doesn't really make any more sense to me now than it did when I was a kid. Here's this (presumably) jobless old woman with wayyy to many kids living in a beat down giant shoe. Her only source of income seems to be from the comedic dual of Stannie Dum and Ollie Dee (Laurel and Hardy), who to be perfectly honest aren't that reliable. So these squatters just live here and aren't paying while Barnaby is stuck loosing money because this is a nice town so you know the taxes are through the roof.

But I digress. The boys try to borrow the money from their employer, the toymaker, which of course doesn't work. Not only do they not get the money, Santa Clause gets them fired because they messed up his order, making 100 soldiers 6 feet tall instead of 600 soldiers 1 foot tall. Comedy ensues. Left with no other options (apparently severance pay or savings accounts don't exist) the boys do the only thing they can: burglary. When their attempt to steal the mortgage fails, and they're caught red handed, they're sentenced to dunking and exiled. Barnaby drops the charges when Bo Peep says she'll marry him. And this is what makes him kinda evil in my opinion.

I won't ruin the rest with spoilers, but if you're a fan of kids, classic, musicals, or fairy tale movies, this is for you. The bad guy truly falls short of being a bad guy, and is just kind of a jerk, so there's no great joy in his defeat. But the music is great, the fantasy toyland feel will make you feel like a kid again, and the comedy of laurel and hardy is top notch.",1414281600,,1965,4.308108108108108

Now the basic plot is to keep Mother Peep's (Florence Roberts) shoe from being foreclosed on by the evil landlord Silas Barnaby (Henry Brandon) when this fails Bo Peep has to marry Barnaby to keep the shoe. Now to keep Little Bo Peep from having to marry Barnaby, it involves Barnaby being tricked into marrying Stanley Dum dressed up as Bo in Bo Peep's place. Naturally Barnaby can not be fooled long and must have his revenge by letting lose the bogeymen from their caverns to destroy Toyland.

Does he succeed in his evil ways?
Who can stop him and how?

All in all it is a must to complete the holiday collection.",1411171200,2,783,4.423611111111111

719280,5,6303625800,"Having been fired from their job at the toy factory for messing up Santa's order of 600 wooden soldiers at 1ft high (they instead build 100 soldiers at 6ft high!), a pair of well meaning bunglers played by the legendary comedy team of Laurel and Hardy run afoul of a local miser named Barnaby and foil his devious plot to blackmail Little Bo Peep into marriage. For his revenge, Barnaby unleashes a horde of monstrous ""Bogey Men"" upon the unsuspecting citizens of Toyland. In the climactic battle scene, our heroes employ the wooden soldiers as a mechanical army to repel the attack and save the day.

Sure, Laurel and Hardy steal the show with their inspired slapstick lunacy but there is plenty more here to recommend for the whole family. Kids will have fun picking out all of the Mother Goose characters that make cameo appearances. The musical numbers are pretty good if you're into that (just try to get the lost sheep song out of your head) and the special effects, costumes and sets are impressive for their day.

I am so glad my kids love this film as much as I do and I hope they will pass it down to theirs someday.

This particular DVD edition allows you to watch in the original black and white or colorized (bleh) versions. The extras are so-so, but don't miss the hilarious vintage toy commercials.",1391040000,2,1313,4.578723404255319

719951,5,6303625800,"When Hal Roach (the famed movie maker) first approached Stan Laurel about starring in a film version of ""Babes in Toyland"" he, Stan Laurel, said no to the project.  He didn't like the script.  But perhaps he saw some potential in it because he offered to rewrite it, and it was that rewritten script ... once accepted by Hal Roach ... that brought the famous comedy duo of Laurel & Hardy on board.  And so the final version of ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" (originally known as ""Babes in Toyland"") is largely a Stan Laurel screenplay.

""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" is basically comedy and singing entertainment.  Good stuff.  And there is hardly a dull moment in the entire film.  It is the story of a place called ""Toyland"" where many of the old Mother Goose nursery rhyme characters are brought to life.  Fun.  Little Bo Peep is romanced by Tom Tom (the piper's son), but mean old Silas Barnaby schemes to steal her for himself ... and he nearly succeeds.  One thing leads to another and all the residents of Toyland face off in a battle against Silas Barnaby and his army of bogeymen.  The ending is, of course, a happy one.

Charlotte Henry plays Bo Peep and she is just wonderful ... the best performer in the film (and a great screamer when things get scary).  Felix Knight plays Tom Tom and he is OK, but he has an excellent singing voice.  Florence Roberts plays Mother Peep and she is excellent.  The man who plays mean old Silas Barnaby is actually a 21 year old actor named Henry Brandon, and his work here (as the bad guy) is superb ... superb and fun.  William Burress is very good as the toy maker boss ... good in an intimidating sort of way.  And Billy Bletcher is fun in the small part of the chief of police.  But it is Laurel & Hardy who carry the movie.  They work very well together, and as bumbling, but well-meaning, toy makers they find a perfect stage to showcase their comedic talents.  Stan Laurel is really funny when he gets upset.

An interesting side note is ... the mouse.  A little mouse appears throughout the movie, and if you've seen it, you have invariably asked yourself, ""How did they do that?""  It is way too small for an actor to be in the costume.  I thought it was a puppet operated by strings.  But the answer is that it was ... a monkey.  Yep.  A little capuchin monkey (in a mouse costume) that was trained to do the tricks needed for the movie.

But ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" is still fun entertainment for the whole family to watch together, and considering that it was made a full 80 years ago, that is a pretty good movie.

PS:  The colorization job they did on ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" is truly amazing in its high quality.",1386460800,3,2688,4.393509127789047

One of our grandsons wants to watch it in black & white to see what it looked like ""long time ago.""

720254,5,6303625800,"Based on the photo, I thought the only bonus was Rudolph, but there's a lot more. You also get a Laurel & Hardy short about wood as well as several Christmas themed bonuses including: Howdy Doody's Christmas Special, The Little Rascals Happy New Year Greeting, Jingle Bells, The Night Before Christmas, and a message from Santa.

As for the movie itself, you get both the original monochrome* version and color version. The monochrome version looks pretty good, except for a few areas when the camera is zoomed out and then you see some over-exposure (film too bright). You do see the occasional artifact in the film (such as a scratch or tear), but these are to be expected in a film this old. Overall the picture quality is great.

Now on to the color version. Because its been colorized, you do see some more grain in certain spots than you would in monochrome, but as I'm sure most people who buy this will skip the color version, it's not a problem. The skin tones are pretty good compared to other colorized films I've seen. Still, the skin does look slightly unnatural. Though the other colors all look fine. The sunflowers and straw look like the correct shade of yellow. The dresses and other outfits look good as well. There seems to bee less noticeable scratches in the colorized version, perhaps they were blended in with color to hide them. Overall the picture quality is great.

Whether you prefer the monochrome or colorized version, you'll find that the picture quality and sound quality are nearly perfect for a film of this age.

*Black and White film stock is actually monochrome. True black and white wouldn't allow for shading and would look like horrible. ""Black and White"" doesn't actually exist, it's just a silly term people use. ""Black and Grey"" would be a more appropriate term than ""Black and White"" in the case of film (and also tattoos).",1375747200,4,1867,4.717791411042945

720395,2,6303625800,I am reviewing the Legend Films Blu-Ray disc version of the film.  My only comments are on the technical aspects of the release.  It appears to me that the original transfer was done at standard definition tv scan rates otherwise known as 480I or NTSC tv which we had basically since the beginning of broadcast television.  That said I believe this Blue Ray disc is merely an up conversion of what may have been released previously as a DVD.  The front cover of the Blu-Ray box says there has been a spectacular restoration in color and Black & White which is misleading because the film was never made in color and there was no color to restore.  As far as a restoration I see no signs whatsoever of any restoration.  I see tons of white speckles which denote dirt on a negative possibly.  The real point here is the expensive process of frame by frame restoration was absolutely not done which is a shame because from what I can see the elements they transferred from could have greatly benefited from frame restoration and definitely a high definition transfer.  This process is time consuming and costly and the Legends folks apparently did not think it cost effective to do this.  I have older classic films that have included in their extras the before and after restoration examples which are truly spectacular and you get the feeling from some of these films that you are seeing the film better and cleaner that even the original audiences did which includes sound restoration done by digital sound readers that can read an original optical sound track negative and give cleaner sound than the original audiences ever experienced from a theatrical release print which is many generations away from the original sound recording.  In closing I hope a truly excellent transfer of this film is made before good original film elements are no longer in existence and when that happens I will buy this film yet again as a very happy childhood with precious Thanksgiving day memories is directly linked to this film.,1366329600,,2016,4.767241379310345

720767,5,6303625800,"March of the Wooden Soldiers (or Babes in Toyland, whatever one wants to call it) is a magnificent 77 minute masterpiece of a film that can be viewed in either the original black and white release or the color version. This DVD offers both versions, and each is restored very well. Now, for the film itself: Anyone who loves a classic nostalgic film that features every facet of the entertainment spectrum will truly enjoy this film, especially at Christmastime. When I think of Babes in Toyland, I think of a BALANCED film that is not over-indulgent in any aspect. A lot of films from the 1930s have a tendency to overdo it with singing, for example. This film had its share of singing that adds to the artistic element, but it never gets to the point of being annoying. This film moves along and keeps the viewer's interest. Of course, there's the humor too, a Laurel and Hardy staple. Laurel's 'Christmas gift' to Mr. Barnaby is a classic moment, as is Barnaby's surprise bride. Then there's the last 15-20 minutes of the film, which is downright chaotic and hilarious. I surprisingly preferred the color version of this film, as I've been known to be a purist in the past. I just think that the film has more life to it when seeing it in color. Oh, and the extras are cool to watch too. This DVD is a must-have for those who appreciate the timeless classics in American cinema. I highly recommend it. 10/10",1356480000,,1410,4.55511811023622

The 3D on this version is excellent and works extremely well.  Incidentally, I saw Henry Brandon (who plays ""Barnaby"" to perfection in this film) in person around 1988 at a Sons of the Desert (the official L&H fan club) convention here in Minneapolis.  When they announced his name before coming on, I expected some guy of 123 years of age, but instead he turned out to be a very spry and witty gentlemen in his early 70s (Brandon was ONLY 23 years old when he made this film!)

As I watch the movie now I laugh at the awful costumes and predictable dialog and find myself just as enchanted as I was as a babe!  I'm  happy to say that my young relatives after turning up their noses have completely fallen in love with this  version after watching it with ME!  So maybe raising the terror factor was cheating, but by the end they were shouting to warn Laural and Hardy to watch out too!!!  One of my neices asked if she could take the disc to school to show the other kids !!! I found out later that she warned her class that it might get scary but not to worry her Aunt had shown her how to protect everyone !!!

Roach's Toyland is close in musical tone to the 1903 show, complete with a tenor (Felix Knight) and other trappings of the musical form of theater before Rodgers and Hammerstein. It also bears a musical resemblance to Disney's Snow White, released only three years later. What is amazing is how The Wizard of Oz, which came only five years later, avoids the operetta sound and still sounds amazingly mainstream. But then, Snow White was less than ten years after Steamboat Willie -- how fast the advancements came!

Laurel & Hardy starred in several similar operetta-style films -- Swiss Miss, Fra Diavolo and The Bohemian Girl -- that had the elements of a young singing couple, evil villains and comic set pieces with Stan and Ollie. Several of the Marx Brothers films did this as well.

Walt Disney and Hal Roach apparently had a friendly relationship; according to Leonard Maltin's The Disney Films, Disney warmly agreed to Roach's use of the Three Little Pigs (with different names) and a monkey appears to be playing Mickey Mouse (riding in a blimp that gets a visual nod in the 1961 film's toy battle scene).

Another Laurel & Hardy historian, John McCabe, wrote that Stan Laurel was very fond of Toyland, but regretted it not being filmed in color. The film is very accessible on home video in both colorized and black-and-white editions (Warner released a very nice print on DVD in recent years).

Colorization is a pariah to many film buffs, but since Laurel himself wished Babes in Toyland was made that way, it's kind of fun to watch the colorized version (keeping a black and white copy on hand as well). Toyland is so unreal, the lack of true tones and tints in colorization actually works, even clarifying some of the darker, less defined scenes in the last reel. It's a question of taste, but in this case, it's worth seeing in color at least once.",1356048000,2,2199,4.761154855643045

The 3D is restrained in the sense that nothing is exaggerated and you won't find the peewee hitting you between the eyes. The debate about 3D films is always about natural composition vs effects which allow objects to protrude out of the screen. In the 1950's the first major 3D feature (Bwana Devil) was panned by critics saying ""Do you want a lion in your lap or do you want a good movie?"" In ""Babes in Toyland"" one could ask ""do you want a bogey man in your lap or do you want Laurel and Hardy at their best (which you do get)."" No bogey men in your laps, but you do get is a nice 3D rendering of people and objects which you might be tempted to wonder ""was ""Babes"" filmed in 3D and in color?""

The 3D has good depth throughout but if you are someone that wants climaxes from their 3D this is not for you. In Effect if you want things flying directly at you this film does not give you that. When this film was made you would see something done say Stan striking a projectile with a stick you would see that but not the path of the item in flight just the end results.

In the summer of 1933 Hal Roach bought toe rights and began fashioning the somewhat story-less musical into a showcase for his two top stars, Laurel and Hardy.  Roach's story had Laurel as Simple Simon and Oliver Hardy as the Pieman (going to the fair.)  Stan Laurel was unimpressed with the scenario and working with staff writers created a new plot for the film: Laurel and Hardy would play apprentice toy makers, living in Toyland and boarding with Widow Peep (the old lady who lives in a shoe who had so many children she didn't know what to do. She is also mother of Little Bo Peep.) The meanest man in Toyland is the evil Silas Barnaby, who holds the mortgage on the Shoe. He wants Bo Peep to become his wife and will forgive the mortgage as a wedding present. The boys promise Widow Peep that they will ask their employer, the Toymaker for a loan to cover the mortgage, but thanks to Stan's incompetence a major order from Santa Clause is mixed up and instead of delivering 600 one-foot high wooden soldiers, Stan and Ollie build 100 six-foot high soldiers.  The soldiers save the day when Barnaby unleashes hundreds of demon bogeyman on Toyland in his attempt to destroy the town.

The film, released  by M-G-M on November 30, 1934 was a big hit for everyone - even though Hal Roach later disparaged it, unhappy to have lost creative control of his pet project.

That was the last time the film was exhibited in its complete form for many years.  Unlike most of the Laurel and Hardy features, Roach did not hang onto BABES IN TOYLAND. It along with THE DEVIL'S BROTHER and BONNIE SCOTLAND were sold back to M-G-M in the early 1940s. M-G-M had no real interest in the film since it wasn't an in-house  production, but they allowed another distributor to reissue it as long as the title was changed.  Starting in the late 1940's BABES IN TOYLAND became REVENGE IS SWEET and later MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS. To accommodate theaters showing it as part of a double feature, the running time was trimmed from 79 minutes to 73 minutes. This was done by cutting the opening storybook sequence where Mother Goose sings ""Toyland"", a later scene where Tom-Tom sings ""Go to Sleep, Slumber Deep"" to Bo Peep when the two are lost in Bogeyland, and a few other trims were done her and there.  When M-G-M failed to renew the film's copyright, BABES IN TOYLAND became a Public Domain title and battered prints of the abridged WOODEN SOLDIERS were widely copied and sold.

Fortunately M-G-M did preserve the original negative, and in 1990 the Samuel Goldwyn company used this to generate a new transfer, which was colorized and syndicated to television stations across the U.S. The colorization was very well done, and the new version was quickly released to the home video market. This version restored the film to it's full length and used the original title cards for TV showings: Toy blocks spelling out the names of Laurel and Hardy tumbling over to reveal a single block showing the name BABES IN TOYLAND. For the home video release this card was electronically altered to read MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS. All that was missing was the M-G-M lion.

Finally M-G-M reclaimed the property and issued a beautiful DVD edition - in the original Black and White as seen in movie theatres in 1934 - and fully intact. Even the M-G-M lion appears at the very start.

The movie doesn't keep a lot of Victor Herbert's melodious score.  A bit of ""Toyland"" at the beginning, ""Never Mind Bo Peep, We Will Find Your Sheep"", ""Castle in Spain"" and ""Go to Sleep, Slumber Deep"" are the only vocal selections retained. ""I Can't Do The Sum"" is used to underscore many of Laurel and Hardy' sequences, and ""The March of the Toys"" is given a full performance under the climatic sequence.  ""It the Toymaker's Workshop"" is heard in the background of the scenes where Stan and Ollie are shown working for the Toymaker"" and dramatic music from the  show's prologue underscores the horror scenes near the end of the film. ""Floretta"", ""Barney O'Flynn"", ""Hail to Christmas"", ""The Military Ball"" and the delightful ""Song of the Poet"" are all gone. Even so the movie offers a fascinating distillation of one of Herbert's most charming scores.

Walk Disney made another BABES IN TOYLAND movie in 1961. It is  a debacle.  Some hack at Disney rewrote many of the lyrics, distorting the original melodies to make the new words fit. The movie has little humor, and no charm. It also doesn't have Laurel and Hardy who make this 1934 movie so endearing.

Now, finally, you can see the film as it was shown over the Christmas season of 1934 but only on this M-g-M Holiday Classics edition.  Accept no substitutes!",1354233600,3,4991,4.712643678160919

When I received the disc, I checked the case, and the back does show it has the black and white, as well as the colorized 3D versions; however, when I played the disc, it only contains the 3D colorized version.  I believe that perhaps the manufacturer is using the same packaging on both versions of this release, and only the higher price point version contains the original black and white.

This title has truly been brought to life. Warning: Amazon really needs updating as to the way it presents various versions (such as 3D) of a single title. They add unnecessary confusion but despite the complaints they seem to ignore the problem.

I can say that this is the first version of March of the Wooden Soldiers (Babes in Toyland) that I can watch all the way through. The 3D conversion and the virtually perfect colorization add dimensions which allow this very old movie to break through the cobwebs. Just amazing. Now I can hope that someday ""Casablanca"" will get the same treatment - the same enhancement. Perfect 3D and colorization allows you to see detail that was hidden in the old 2D black and white. Those who insist on the original black and white 2D of any title can always watch that way - if that's their choice. But they should have an open mind and take a look at the new 3D TV's that use the lightweight, cordless, batteryless, polarized glasses. And if it doesn't amaze you then it's probably because the retailer has a very poor environment for showing this breakthrough in TV. My brother and I both bought into the new 3D at the same time and are thrilled with the added dimension it brings.

And if you, like me still have ancient ""colorized"" VHS tapes, it's recycle time. They were never as good as we had hoped and we now have something that lives up to our highest expectations. Enjoy.",1352764800,9,1546,4.574007220216607

721117,4,6303625800,"I very much prefer this film in color than in black and white, and I have watched both the Goodtimes colourized version and the Legend version. For me it comes down to this:

The Goodtimes has the best saturation, better overall colour, and better contrast without exposing the print too much to bleach out details. It is also a cleaner print. Apparently MGM handed over a nice, clean print of this right out of their vault and gave it to a company called ""American Film technologies, Inc."" for colorizing: at the end of the movie is a note that reads ""Color version, Samuel Goldwyn Co., 1991"".  This print is absolutely pristine, with NO scratches, tramlines, spots or speckles.  However, something did happen in the colorizing process, perhaps in generating the colored-print, because the long-shots are only softly in focus.  But close ups are sharp and detailed. I found that I did get used to the odd focus, but it took a while. The beginning credits say the ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" instead of the original ""Babes in Toyland"", but this is only a few seconds different from the true original and I can't get to panicky over it. I give this Goodtimes version 4 stars, my ONLY real criticism being that the focus is often too soft and makes my eyeballs cross. The color is GORGEOUS!  I wish this company (if it still exists) would use modern technology to re-do this and give us a blu-ray version.  (I also wish the Georges Melies films would get colourization like this!!!)

The Legend version has better focus, has most of the original titles with their snippet of animation leading into ""Babes in Toyland"" (*). But, it is a washed-out print with highlights burned out, and overall has a greenish-cast, which is unpleasant. (Maybe you can adjust for this on your DVD monitor.) The menus have loud, stupid, disturbing music--a characteristic that I always hate and despise (pure silence is best).

(* The first original title is an approval certificate. Legend replaces this with a title-card that has their own name. No loss folks, really.)

The Legend black-and-white version does appear to be simply the colourized print with the colour turned off. It, too, is washed out, and has a LOT of nicks and scratches that are not on other prints. Also, the sound is too bright for my ears.  The recent release of this movie by MGM proves that this film is STILL in pristine condition; it has superb, glowing sound as well. The MGM B&W version also has all the original main titles COMPLETELY intact and restored. This Legend release cannot possibly be from the original negative, and it is NOT ""spectacularly restored"". Once again, we have been lied to.

So, for the completely original and pristine version in black-and-white, get the latest release by MGM.  For the colour version, I recommend Goodtimes.  Legend sucks.",1348876800,,2827,4.804123711340206

721229,5,6303625800,"The second best Christmas Movie ever made is the original ""Babes in Toyland,"" also known as ""The March of the Wooden Soldiers.""  This delightful story has everything...you get Laurel and Hardy, light opera, Santa Claus, self-sacrifice, cross-dressing, same-sex marriage, boogeymen, heroism, greed, lust, scary monkeys, zombie-like Wooden Soldiers, waterboarding, true love AND alligators.  Even Fellini wouldn't have dared!

The film features all of our favorite storybook characters...the three little pigs, the big bad wolf, Old Mother Hubbard, Little Bo Peep, Tom Tom the Piper's Son, and many, many more.  Little Bo Peep and Tom Tom fall in love, but the situation is complicated by the presence of the evil Barnaby, a miserly old wretch who lusts after the sweet Ms. Peep.  And it turns out that old Barnaby holds the mortgage to her mother's Shoe House (yes, Ms. Peep is apparently the product of an earlier liaison on the part of Mrs. Hubbard...I'm telling you, this is a very complex, many-layered saga).  Unless Ms. Peep agrees to give up the handsome young TomTom and marry evil Barnaby, Old Mother Hubbard will be turned out of her Shoe.

Bo Peep agrees to Barnaby's hideous demands and they are to be wed in the morning.  Fortunately for Ms. Peep, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy hatch a plot to save her. Stannie disguises himself as the bride and weds Barbaby in her place!  Everybody would live happily ever after (well, maybe not Stannie), but the evil Barnaby exacts revenge by kidnapping one of the three little pigs and planting false evidnce (in the form of link sausage) on the guileless TomTom...who is then sent to Boogeyland! Little Bo Peep flees Barnaby's clutches and braves the wilds of Boogieland to find her true love.

Once again, our heroic Stannie and Ollie come to the rescue. Through their efforts, our hapless hero is cleared of the crime, he and Bo Peep are located and returned to safety, the purloined Little Pig is found, the town is saved from an invasion of Boogeymen, and the evil Barnaby is convicted of pig-napping.  A perfect storybook ending!

This is such a fun movie, it never grows old. It's Laurel and Hardy at their best...and that's better than almost anything else.  The film was made in 1934, and filmed in black and white, but the creativity and imagination that went into this production transcend the grays and blacks of the actual cinematography... somehow I always remember it being in color.

Make this part of your holiday viewing...this film has more entertainment, more thrills and chills, more charm, whimsy and sheer mayhem packed into it than all of those badly animated Christmas cartoons and silly remakes of A Christmas Carol starring retreads from bad sitcoms put together.

And by the way, the best holiday movie is the original 1966 version of ""A Christmas Memory"" starring Geraldine Page.  If you have not seen it, you've missed something very special indeed.",1324512000,2,2929,4.959100204498977

721231,5,6303625800,"I'm not the first person to say this, but this version of Babes in Toyland has often been compared to the Disney version, and for the most part the verdict is favorable to the Laurel & Hardy film.  And for the most part, I have to agree, now having seen the uncut, unedited version presented here.  This is some of Laurel & Hardy's best work.  Disney studios obviously studied this film because so many bits of this and that were lifted from it.  The march of the toy soldiers is an amazing peice of stop-action work considering that it was done in the 1930's, and almost seems to have been lifted frame by frame by Disney.  Of course, in all fairness, MGM's ""mouse"" is an obvious parody of Mickey, and the three little pigs, plus their theme song, are most certainly Disney's.  But Stan and Ollie are in fine form, and very, very funny, and that's what most of us are there for.",1324425600,,879,4.361963190184049

I never realized how much I enjoyed the films whether in color or black and white. I am just happy to have it restored to perfection. I have always enjoyed the comedy partnership of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. This is their best collaboration and timeless as well. This production of ""Babes in Toyland"" is also known as ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" too.

Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are Stan Dum and Ollie Dee and live in Widow Peep's house. Her beautiful daughter, Bo Peep, is in love with Tom Boy but dastardly Silas Barnaby, the meanest man in Toyland, wants to marry her. Silas will use everything in his power to do so. This film is a delight to children and adult fans alike.

The DVD comes with extra features such as theatrical trailer, bonus animated movie of ""Rudolph The Red Nose Reindeer; Laurel & Hardy short film; Christmas Toyshop; ""Twas the Night Before Christmas;"" ""Merry Christmas"" cartoon; classic toy commercials; and vintage holiday film rarities. You will enjoy all the extra special features too.",1324425600,,1153,4.674876847290641

The big news is that the B&W picture quality has more detail on the MGM standard DVD than the Legend Films Blu-ray disc!  The problem is that the Legend Films master film is overall lighter, with blacks looking gray and the lighter grays looking washed out, losing detail.  Little Bo Peep has a birthmark on her cheek that is easy to see in the MGM DVD, but the Legend Blu-ray washes it out so that you can barely see it.  Earlier in the opening Mother Goose song after she opens up the book, there is a hair on the right side of the picture that happened during the original lab matting process. This hair is hard to see in the washed out Legend Films version.  The MGM DVD has so much detail that you can see the split screen matt line in this same scene, but not on the Legend Blu-ray.

The official MGM DVD also includes the original MPAA Approval notice at the beginning of the film, Legend Films replaces this with their logo as the movie's music plays.

The hearing impaired, and those who don't speak English will want to get MGM's DVD as it has subtitles in English, Spanish, and French. Legend Films DVD & Blu-ray does not have any.

If you have to see the film in color, then you will want the legend Films DVD & Blu-ray releases as they include a colorized version (the discs de-fault to Colorized for play-out).

The legend Films DVD & Blu-ray release also includes some mediocre bonus Christmas films.  The first and best is the Dave Fleischer color cartoon RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER, but beware THE MUSIC HAS BEEN CHANGED! Gone is the classic Rudolph theme song, as it is copyrighted, and new holiday music is in its place.
On the menu there is a generically titled Laurel & Hardy Short, this is an incomplete presentation of Laurel & Hardy's educational film A TREE IN A TEST TUBE which is available in complete form on other L&H DVDs and not necessary to have again.
Most of the other bonus Christmas films are Castle Films Home Movie live action Christmas Films that I challenge you to sit through.
A JINGLE BELLS SING-A-LONG is actually an excerpt from a Paramount Bouncing Ball cartoon, but the cartoon itself is not included.

Since I would be buying this for the BABES IN TOYLAND movie itself, I would go for the better picture quality on the MGM DVD.  Why only 4 stars out of 5? The picture still looks grainy in both releases & the nicer MGM version doesn't have any bonus material, not even the original theatrical trailer (which does exist).

I remember, starting when I was about 6 or 7, I would watch this video ALL the time, especially around the holidays. I remembered snippets of it into adulthood, (the mangers in the trees) (the monkey throwing bombs) but more than anything I remembered the sheer joy that this movie brought me.

I sort of enjoyed them for how strange and bad they were (with the exception of the classic toy ads which I found hilariously terrifying and informative).

721333,4,6303625800,"""Babes in Toyland"" or known to many as ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" has been an annual Christmas film that has been shown on television for decades.  Many people have grown up with this Laurel & Hardy classic and now, the 1934 film gets its re-released on Blu-ray via two restored versions in its original black and white and utilizing Legend Films colorization process.

As for the two different titles, back in 1934 when ""Babes in Toyland"" was released, in 1948 for its re-released by Lippert Pictures, the film was edited down to 73-minutes and for years, many people have watched this version of the film.  For this re-released version, the version included on Blu-ray is a 77-minute version but instead of using ""Babes in Toyland"", Legend Films has opted to use ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"".

""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" is based on the libretto by Glen MacDonough and for the film adaptation directed by Gus Meins and Charley Rogers and a screenplay adaptation by Frank Butler and Nick Grinde, the film takes place in Toyland where many fairy tale characters live.

VIDEO:

""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" is presented in 1080p (1:33:1) and is the first Blu-ray release from Legend Films.  Bare in mind that this film is available in public domain but this is probably the best version of the film to own at this time.  I have seen others who have said the MGM Holiday boxset with the film on DVD is much better but seriously, with the Blu-ray release having a much higher bitrate, the Blu-ray version is the better looking of the two.

I've heard people complain that there are no blacks and only grays.  I saw blacks but is the contrast perfect... No.  Is it fantastic as other bigger companies or the Criterion Collection have invested in their classic films?  No, but the fact that Legend Films is getting involved in the Blu-ray scene, with their first release, this is where they get to learn what people want to see on Blu-ray, especially since they have done several classics as I would love to see them bring out ""My Man Godfrey"" on Blu-ray.

As for the colorization of the film, if there is one thing that Legend Films excels at and that is their colorization process.  I tend to dislike black and white films being colorized especially the way Turner did their colorization back in the early '90s but Legend Films uses better technology and so far, watching ""My Man Godfrey"" on DVD and now watching ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" on Blu-ray, I'm quite content with their colorization.  They do a fantastic job!  Now whether or not the clothing and hair is accurate, I don't know.  But I know for ""My Man Godfrey"", they did the research of what colors the costumes were and I would assume they would have done the same type of research on this release.

With that being said, I still prefer the black and white version of the film.

AUDIO:

""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" is presented in Dolby Digital Mono but seeing they put 2.0 mono, I'm assuming that they meant stereo or putting two mono tracks to the left and right speaker.  Nevertheless, dialogue and music is clear and heard no major pops or hissing during the film.

You will hear some degradation with some of the classic shorts in the special features.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" features the following special features:

  * Origintal Theatrical Trailer - Featuring the B&W and color trailers for ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" plus trailers for ""A Christmas Wish"", ""Beyond Christmas"" and ""The Shirley Temple Storybook Collection"".
  * Christmas Trailer Gallery

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to Laurel & Hardy, fans have felt that Americans have gotten the shaft when other countries especially the UK have received wonderful Laurel & Hardy DVD releases (especially the wonderful Universal Laurel & Hardy DVD box set).  Sure we have had the lost Laurel & Hardy DVD set (which came out and then made out of print) and there are a few movies released on DVD.

But when it comes to Blu-ray releases, it's one thing to get Chaplin or Keaton on Blu-ray but for Laurel & Hardy, no one ever knows if any of Hal Roach-related releases such as Laurel and Hardy,  Harold Lloyd, Charley Chase or Little Rascals releases will ever be released on Blu-ray, so I have to admit that I was a bit surprised and also a bit giddy that there was a Laurel and Hardy film set for release on Blu-ray courtesy of Legend Films.  One, we are getting a popular Christmas classic in black and white and color but also, Legend Films are now taking their first step in High Definition.

And I was very surprised to find out that this Blu-ray release was going for less than $10.  It's important to note that Legend Films are nowhere near Criterion Collection or KINO status but they do have the potential to become fan favorites for classic movie and TV show fans because of the titles they have released on DVD thus far.  In fact, ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" is a pretty solid release for its price.  Not only do you get a pretty good B&W release, you also get a colorized version and when it comes to colorization, Legend Films excels at it.

Sure, the company has taken on many titles that were released on public domain but compared to other companies that also take on PD titles, Legend Films has a solid track record for releasing solid black and white and solid colorization of restored films.  And the fact that they are releasing on Blu-ray does make me happy.

I know that a few people have said that they did not see and blacks and their blacks were grays.  In my experience, that was not the case, so I'm guessing depending on your setup, it's all subjective.  But compare to the MGM release years ago (from the MGM Holiday Classics DVD box set), I still feel this Blu-ray release tops it in picture quality.

Also, I was surprised to see so many classic Christmas special features added to this release as well and although many have nothing to do with Laurel & Hardy, they do take place around the same time period that the duo were still performing onscreen.  Personally, I thought it was cool to see the Little Rascals singing a Christmas message, especially singing the classic Holiday shorts.

Overall, ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" was a pleasant surprise as I was not expecting Legend Films to release on Blu-ray but I'm glad they have.  Laurel & Hardy's ""Babes in Toyland"" (March of the Wooden Soldiers) is ingrained in the heads of many generations of viewers as a Christmas classic that it was perfect timing for this Blu-ray release and also to add, a pleasant surprise as I purchased this Blu-ray for under $10.

If you enjoyed this classic, it's definitely recommended on Blu-ray especially at the very low price you can find it for.  And I hope that this is a signal that more Legend Films releases will be on Blu-ray in the near future.  Laurel & Hardy fans, this release is recommended!",1292976000,18,8123,4.6803105151729

Some are subtle and in the background and others are quite obvious. I spent most of the movie picking out areas that they didn't bother to colorize.  Apparently they were too lazy or felt the audience was too ""dull"" to notice.  It really irritated me to see this careless treatment of such a classic.

This is the colorized version. The characters were inspired the traditional nursery rhymes of yesteryear. Barnaby the banker lusts after nubile Little Bo Peep, who lives with her mother in a shoe. They have two boarders, Stan and Ollie, who work in the toy factory. Mrs. Peep's mortgage payment is coming due, she needs money. Stan spent his savings on peewees, a wooden toy. [Product placement?] A struck toy knocks the hat off Barnaby, who shows his anger. Stan and Ollie go on with their work in the toy factory. Has Little Bo Peep lost her sheep? Red Riding Hood hasn't seen them. There is a song for entertainment. The citizens of Toyland return the lost sheep. Tom-Tom the Piper's son announces their engagement. The people are so happy. There is full employment, good jobs with good wages and a sound dollar.

Was there a mistake in the order for Toy Soldiers? Another fine mess? Have they created a monster? Can Mrs. Peep prevent a foreclosure on her house? Alas, her boarders did not get the money. Stan and Ollie have a plan. A Christmas gift in July? ""Goodnight Ollie."" They will get a ducking and then be banished. Something goes wrong. Does King Cole obey the requests of Banker Barnaby? [Who has the gold, rules.] The veiled bride goes to Barnaby, the mortgage is turned over after the marriage. [No laws against fraud?] Is there a joke here? Will Barnaby take revenge by framing Tom-Tom for pig-napping? Yes. Wrongfully convicted due to planted evidence, he will be banished to Bogeyland. ""Tastes like pork."" Its beef! Can they find little Elmer? Too late they learn the truth! Bo Peep goes to join Tom-Tom in Bogeyland.

After his exposure Barnaby flees to the underground, and tries to take Bo Peep from Tom-Tom. The noise raises the inhabitants, fierce devils covered in fur. Tom-Tom and Bo Peep find their way home, along with Ollie and Stan. Barnaby leads the Bogeymen (no Bogeywomen?) into an invasion of Toyland. The disarmed citizens have no way to repel the invasion, except for comic efforts. Can the Wooden Soldiers help? Yes, they drive away the Bogeymen. It takes a good man with a gun to defeat a bad man with a gun. ""And they lived happily ever after.""

Years later the Toy Factory was shut down after it could not meet foreign competition from the Elves of Borealis. The lack of income led to many home foreclosures due to a ""housing bubble"". Bad weather caused a shortfall in the harvest. Hunger was followed by sickness and death. King Richard was overthrown after he devalued the dollar and a Republic was proclaimed. The wrongful conviction of Tom-Tom led to an abolition of the banishment penalty. The Barnaby Bank was nationalized so its investments would provide the greatest good for the greatest number. The continuing threat from Bogeyland led to a rearmament program with higher taxes on citizens. People survived, but some looked back to the Good Old Days of yesteryear when they had a sound dollar and happier times.[I'm not making this up.]

This is one movie that has different messages for adults and children, like the fairy tales of yore. Can the wealthiest man in town have connections to the underworld? Can any King rule by the free consent of his subjects? Why are furry, fanged, and clawed beings a threat? This represents mankind's earliest enemies.",1290729600,,3345,4.790294627383016

First off, let me say that this is a GREAT movie, especially around the holidays (it is a Thanksgiving tradition in my family). It is fun for all ages and this restored version is a HUGE step up from my previous copy which was a very poor quality VHS. I can see what some of the other reviewers are complaining about regarding the lighting and I'm not sure why it wasn't fixed, but overall I still think that this Blu-ray version is a huge step up from previous versions.

So imagine how upset I am when I stick the Blu-ray disc in my player and it doesn't work. The menu loads (slowly), the music plays, but there is no selection animation on the menu and whenever I try to press any of the buttons it freezes and I have to restart the player - rendering the movie completely unplayable. I was ready to send it back (and was quite upset, too, as I was hoping to watch it tomorrow on Thanksgiving) BUT I decided to do a quick firmware update for my Blu-ray player (an LG BD550 in case you are interested) and was surprised to see that it worked! Now, I'm not enough of an electronics expert to tell you WHY it worked, but I will tell you that from what I understand there have been others who have had the same or similar problems playing their disc that were resolved after a quick firmware update. So my advice is this... before you play the movie take a few minutes and update your player. It's usually very simple to do and can save you a lot of trouble!",1290556800,5,1614,4.2200647249190935
721339,2,6303625800,"The Legend Films DVD release was improperly mastered with both the B/W and color versions overly bright, and that error has been maintained with the mastering the Blu-ray. There are no blacks, just light grays, and the tonal balance is all off and wan. One must significantly lower the brightness on one's display to get an acceptable image. The colorizing looks much better as well when darkened. I'm of the feeling that the image was brightened for colorizing, but then it wasn't darkened again (as it should've been) before final mastering.

As far as the HD upgrade, it is minor. It appears that a great deal of digital noise reduction was used, leaving patterns and edges of objects rather waxy. It also shows up how some of the colors bleed over on different objects. I only paid about $9 fo this Blu-ray, but come on... At LEAST get the brightness issue corrected!

I bought the MGM version because another Amazon reviewer called it a far ""superior presentation"".  That reviewer was right.  I was really astounded at the quality of the print.  It appears to come from great source material.  It is far better than any other Laurel and Hardy dvd release I have ever seen.  I was surprised MGM would invest money to upgrade a title that, because of it's age alone, must have a very limited market.  However, if you are a child of the 50's, and grew up watching Laurel and Hardy on TV and if you are, like me,fond of this comedy team, buy the MGM version.

It looks like everything on the DVD version has been transferred to blu-ray (no additional features have been added). As far as quality goes, the movie does look sharper in some areas (set pieces, costumes) but still blurry in others (the straw on the Little Pigs hut, cave). So if you're looking for a substantial upgrade, you won't find one. But it is an improvement over the DVD version. If you like Laurel & Hardy and or have fond memories of this film, and have a large screen TV, it's worth the $9.49 upgrade.

""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" is a re-issue of the 1934 film ""Babes in Toyland."" You'll need to search on the later title to find it on IMDB.

721440,5,6303625800,"What a delight to find the original, B&W, uncut, BABES IN TOYLAND back in circulation.

This film has had rocky history since its first (and highly successful) theatrical release for the Christmas season of 1934 - 75 years ago as I write this.

At one point in the 1940s, M-g-M bought the rights to 4 features from Hal Roach. The seem to have wanted the operetta/musical titles: FRA DIAVALO, BABES IN TOYLAND, the all star revue PICK A STAR and... BONNIE SCOTLAND?  This last title doesn't really belong. I suspect someone goofed and the title they wanted was THE BOHEMIAN GIRL.  Anyhow, this is why these titles were not included when the L&H features were packaged for TV. M-g-M probably wanted the musical titles as properties they could possibly remake, but had no intention of doing anything with the films.

Other distributors struck deals with M-g-M to reissue these titles. The deal allowed M-g-M to keep the copyrights and negatives and that the reissues could not use the original titles. So FRA DIAVALO became BOGUS BANDITS, BONNIE SCOTLAND became HEROES OF THE REGIMENT, PICK A STAR became MOVIE STRUCK, and BABES IN TOYLAND was first reissued as REVENGE IS SWEET and then later as MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS. (At this point 6 minutes were cut for the film including the opening sequence with Mother Goose singing ""Toyland"" and the song ""Go to Sleep Slumber Deep."")

Since M-g-M no longer distributed the title they did not bother renewing the copyright and by the 1970s it was  in the public domain.  Several companies began putting out poor quality copies of the film, usually taken from the abridged WOODEN SOLDIERS prints.

Finally in 1991 the Samuel Goldwyn company prepared a new complete and colorized version for Television.  When it was show on TV it had the original BABES IN TOYLAND title cards, but for home video release the main title card ws digitally altered to read MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS. Of course, the M-g-M logo had to be cut but otherwise he print was complete.

Now, M-g-M/20th Century Fox home video has gone it one better with a DVD release of the original version drawn from a new print taken from the original negatives. The result is a much sharper, clearer image with sound that is likely as good as we will ever get from  a film made 75 years ago. Best of all it is the complete print as originally exhibited. The only curiosity is that the DVD box still calls it MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS, but when you play the DVD the original title BABES IN TOYLAND is displayed.

The film holds up quite well. The techniques are a bit primitive, and the special effects are low-budget but that is all part of the film's charm.

It is not the BABES IN TOYLAND that was seen on stage in 1903. That extravaganza had a loosely constructed plot to allow for a number of specialty acts, more in the style of the British pantomimes. For the film Stan Laurel and the writers created an original story keeping just five of the original songs, although some of the other music from Victor Herbert's score was retained as underscoring.

Kids may at first be put off by the old-style techniques, the black and white photography and the operetta-styled music, but a the story takes over they generally become thoroughly engrossed.  Did I say kids? Most adults will enjoy it as well even if it is a relic from a very different age.",1260316800,7,3358,4.656514382402707

Alas, the colorization from Legend Films is a big disappointment.  Already in possession of the excellent 2001 Goodtimes Home Video release, in which the colorization truly does approximate the technicolor look, I feel as though I have wasted my money.  As for the black and white print, also included on the DVD, is a much poorer rendering than the pristine black and white version available through MGM Home Video.

The extras on the Legends release are nothing new.  They have been included on other L&H releases by other companies, so there is nothing gained there.

Over all, I would suggest that if your heart is set on having a colorized version of this particular feature, stick with the 2001 Goodtimes version.  The effect is much more pleasing to those of us wanting a ""technicolor"" appearence.  As for the black and white version, stick with MGM's release.  It truly is the best print available.

721478,5,6303625800,"On the far end of the musical movie spectrum is the colorized Laurel and Hardy ""MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS.""  As adapted from Victor Herbert's operetta ""Babes in Toyland,"" there's more of the Holiday Spirit in this 1934 classic than in most of the insipidly lame attempts of movies that exploit the holiday season.

Dum (Stan) and Dee (Ollie) are Santa's toymakers preparing for the big delivery on Christmas eve. Mother Goose and nursery rhyme characters are all over the place and Stan and Ollie are in constant trouble (""Is that 100 six-foot toy soldiers or 600 one-footers?"") Silas Barnaby, (remember ""the meanest man in town""?), Bo Peep (she's being forced into marriage by Silas or he will evict Bo's mom, who is in fact The Old Woman In The Shoe). And there's Tom Tom the Piper's Son (Ms Peep's true love) and the big finale with the creepy attack of the Bogeymen.

This classic has been cleaned up, digitally remastered and colorized and looks about as perfect as the best of old style children's book illustrations and I bet Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy themselves would want this one in color. It's certainly no sacrilege. This is one beautiful, Fauvistic fever dream of a movie. A weirdly mesmerizing treat.

Laurel and Hardy forever! Let's all love each other, OK?

That said, there is something else to be considered.

For those who dare to read between the lines (or movie frames), this film can be seen as a sly and subversive horror fest that plumbs deeply disturbing psychological and political issues not touched on in contemporary films. I am amazed that someone hasn't examined this in detail and I have often wondered how much of it may have been intentional -- perhaps from the brilliantly demented mind of Stan Laurel. Only on the surface is this a children's movie.",1237161600,,1791,4.7799352750809065
721479,5,6303625800,"It is sad that Laurel and Hardy fans in North America have been given the short end of the stick for so many years. The rights to all of their shorts(both silent and sound)and their movies(specifically the Hal Roach catalogue)have changed hands more times than I would care to count. It is a sorry legacy of greed,neglect and indifference. Well,I'm happy to report that we finally have something good to celebrate for a change!
MGM studios has taken the proverbial bull by the horns and have elected to release their own print of ""Babes in Toyland"".Yes you heard me,NOT ""March of the Wooden Soldiers""(the slip case cover title) but ""Babes in Toyland"".This release has the original opening and closing titles;and it is marvellous to look at.
It is a beautiful print and the best looking release of the movie I have seen. There have been alot of pretenders to the throne over the last while,some pretty pathetic ones at that,but finally we get to see the film as close to its' original release state as we can get. The original was 90 minutes long and while seen only occasionally in the early TV years it was eventually pared down to the length we have here,about 78 minutes. And that is the version we have had unfortunately for decades.
MGM caught me totally off guard with this one,but I won't complain in the least because I'm just so happy to finally see it out there. I AM worried a little though that by putting ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" on the cover that many fans may give it a pass by thinking it is just another version among many of that film.
It begs the question though,how many more Laurel and Hardy features do MGM hold?They were the distributor for Hal Roach and if they have this movie in their archives it makes some sense that they would possibly have the original full length version and many others,if not all their movies AND shorts. Unfortunately,not holding the rights to their films,there is little MGM can do but sit tight.
Whatever the answers,we must thank MGM studios for taking the initiative and releasing this charming film,for all the Laurel and Hardy fans here in North America and in the best condition I've seen. Let us give MGM the ""Laurels"" they deserve and our ""Hardy"" endorsement by buying the most definitive version to date

 To me, this movie never gets old, even though it was made way before most of us were even thought of. In this movie,all of your favorite fairytale characters come to life in the ""ORIGINAL"" Babes in Toyland. But when you add Laurel & Hardy, you know it's gonna be funny to watch.

721482,1,6303625800,"AMAZON IS PUTTNG ALL COMMENTS ABOUT **ALL** VERSIONS OF THIS MOVIE IN ONE PLACE!!  MY REVIEW IS ONLY ABOUT THE TWO COLORIZED VERSIONS, NOT THE NEW MGM RELEASE OF THE B&W-ONLY, WHICH IS A PERFECT, PRISTINE PRESENTATION!!!  DO NOT CONFUSE THIS 1-STAR RATING OF THE LEGEND RELEASE, WITH MY 6-STAR OPINION OF THE MGM RELEASE!

I very much prefer this film in color than in black and white, and I have watched both the Goodtimes colourized version and the Legend version. For me it comes down to this:

The Goodtimes has the best saturation, better overall colour, and better contrast without exposing the print too much to bleach out details. It is also a cleaner print. However, the long-shots are only softly in focus; close ups are sharp and detailed.  I found that I did get used to the odd focus, but it took a while. The beginning is the ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" credits instead of the original ""Babes in Toyland"" (I don't care much about this).  I give this Goodtimes version 4 stars, my ONLY real criticism being that the focus is soft in the far-shots.  The color is GORGEOUS!

The Legend version is very sharp and clear, has most of the original titles with their snippet of animation leading into ""Babes in Toyland"" (*).  But, it is a washed-out print with highlights burned out, and overall has a greenish-cast, which is unpleasant. (Maybe you can adjust for this on your DVD monitor.)  The menus have loud, stupid, disturbing music--a characteristic that I always hate and despise (pure silence is best).

(* The first original title is an approval certificate.  Legend replaces this with a title-card that has their own name.  No loss folks, really.)

The Legend black-and-white version does appear to be simply the colourized print with the colour turned off.  It, too, is a bit washed out, and has a LOT of nicks and scratches that are not on other prints. The recent release of this movie by MGM proves that this film is still in pristine condition; it has superb, glowing sound as well.  It also has all the original main titles COMPLETELY intact and restored.  This Legend release cannot possibly be from the original negative, and it is NOT ""spectacularly restored"".  Once again, we have been lied to.",1233273600,32,2223,4.72987012987013
721483,5,6303625800,"Purists who begrudgingly pick up this DVD may not even sully themselves with the colourized version, but personally I loved it. It is garish in places but I felt it fit the fantasy element of the film. Toyland here looks like Munchkinland. The film itself is great fun, with Laurel & Hardy's usual pratfalls and the like and some (occasionally overlong and operatic) singing. The bogeymen could be a bit scary for the very young, otherwise it's excellent all-round Xmas entertainment. There's plenty of extras on the DVD that are worth checking out too. Even if you don't like colourized films, buy this for the restored B&W version and the added bonuses. I'd be surprised if you regret it.",1233273600,,690,4.80672268907563

721584,5,6303625800,"Why has so little of Laurel and Hardy's work been released on DVD? The Marx Brothers, The Stooges, W.C. Fields, Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin -- all are well represented; Stan and Ollie are easily in their rank, but most of the DVD releases available seem to be shoddy public domain prints of their later, and least satisfying, films.
This release is a wonderful exception. Legend has done a smashing job restoring the original BABES IN TOYLAND; it's one of Stan and Ollie's best movies, and I have never seen it looking so good. While I normally loathe colorized movies, this is different for three reasons: first, Legend has included the complete, fully restored Black and White version for purists like me. Second, unlike other colorized classics like KING KONG, BABES IN TOYLAND does actually lend itself to color. And third, although it galls me to say it, Legend's coloring process is really quite amazing. It doesn't have a wish-washy, painted-over look about it. It actually looks appropriate. Kudos to them all around.
The extra features on the disk are another matter: some are fun, but there's quite a lot of public-domain junk that's been shoveled indiscriminately onto the disk. That's OK, though -- you're not buying this for the extra features; you'll look at them once and then treasure the main feature for years to come.
Of the several versions of BABES IN TOYLAND/MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS available on DVD, this is clearly the one to buy.
Now if only someone would release Laurel and Hardy's other early features and short subjects on DVD. . .",1228521600,5,1567,4.872659176029963
721585,5,6303625800,"The Laurel and Hardy classic, March of the Wooden Soldiers (originally released as Babes in Toyland), was the fantastic result of combining two tremendous talents with a childlike, fantasy world and adult situations (Laurel and Hardy, Toyland and an evil landlord's mortgage conspiracy, respectively).  Such rich source material makes for a film of unsurpassed quality: featuring rich and imaginative environments, costumes, sights and sounds.  Every fairytale has its day, from Little Bo Peep to the Three Little Pigs to Mother Goose, and even Santa.  We all know that the winter months are a time to remember to greatest holiday classics from years past, and March of the Wooden Soldiers is unsurpassed in its genre.

The holidays are associated with bright and festive colors--bright reds, greens, blues and golds--that set a warm and cheery mood, and the movies that we choose to enjoy during this season are no different.  Fortunately, this edition of March of the Wooden Soldiers has been colorized, bringing newfound vibrancy to the events on screen and helping to integrate this classic tale with the traditional warmth of the holiday season.  Rather than a visually dull grayscale that reminds one of the dour winter weather, toy soldiers shimmer in brilliant red onscreen, and our two comedian leads are further humanized by their newfound flesh tones and colorful Christmas garb.

As colorization efforts go, March of the Wooden Soldiers is a superlative effort, looking as though it was originally produced in the first generation of Technicolor, rather than decades earlier.  The producers in charge of this re-mastering effort clearly thought that we would find an ""aged color"" appearance more acceptable than attempting to make it look completely modern, and this approach works very well.  I'm sure you'll agree if you see a preview.

It's worth noting that this disc also includes the black and white version of the movie, perhaps as a peace offering to those of you who might object to the alteration of a classic film.  I would go so far, then, as to call this the definitive purchase of March of the Wooden Soldiers, not just because you'll have a choice between color and black and white, but because the first step in colorizing any movie is to ""clean up"" the pre-existing black and white material as much as possible, and it certainly shows in comparison with other versions available.

In addition to both versions of the movie, this disc's special features really push it over the top.  As a media buff, the included classic trailers are a wonderful prelude to the main feature--I like to imagine that I'm getting the same experience as the audiences who first viewed Laurel and Hardy some seventy years ago.  And, in keeping with this package's holiday theme, the animated Rudolph the Reindeer movie is thoughtfully included, ensuring that you and your family get the most value out of a single disc.

For any family or fan of holiday cinema, this package is definitely a must-buy.",1228262400,100,3007,5.034274193548387
721586,5,6303625800,"While I wouldn't rate this as Laurel & Hardy's best feature, it certainly rates in the top-5 and is quite enjoyable for the whole family (though as my 5-year old daughter can attest, smaller children may find the bogeymen in the last part of the story just a little too scary without Mom and Dad nearby!).  L&H have several enjoyable routines, Henry Brandon does a wonderful overacting job as the evil Silas Barnaby, and -- for the men reading this -- Charlotte Henry plays a very fetching Bo-Peep!

As other reviews have pointed out, this DVD release contains both the original black-and-white version and a colorized version.  While I am one who is glad the practice in the 80s and early 90s of bastardizing B&W classics by colorization is largely ended, I have to admit that colorization improves this film given it's fantasy nature (imagine what ""The Wizard of Oz"" would have been like if it had been in B&W...Dorothy skipping down the light-gray road just isn't the same!).  The purist in me, though, is glad to see both available on this edition.  That same purist is also delighted to see that, despite the name on the box, Legend's source material still has the original ""Babes in Toyland"" title in the opening credits (the title was changed to ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" for a 1940s re-release, and it's had that title on every TV broadcast and DVD up until now).

Finally, and this is probably something only die-hard L&H fans like myself will appreciate, this DVD also contains the rarely seen ""The Tree in a Test Tube"".  This short was produced by the federal government during WWII to show the public the variety of products containing wood.  Supposedly L&H filmed this on their lunch hour, and it shows.  It's only mildly amusing, but of course the main goal of the film was information, not entertainment.

In conclusion, if you are looking to buy a copy of this movie, this is the version to purchase.  If you already own a copy, I would say there's no reason to buy this one unless you are a huge L&H fan and want a copy of this movie with the original opening credits or a copy of ""The Tree in a Test Tube"".",1217635200,,2129,4.576315789473684

721590,4,6303625800,"There are many reasons movies are filmed in Black & White. Sometimes for budgetary reasons, other times the stars didn't want to show their ""perfect"" skin had flaws. The effects people were afraid their work would not look real. And yes, sometimes for artistic expression, but not for this movie. This movie was meant to be filmed in color, but budget was stretched and color technology wasn't perfected till four years later, ala The Adventures of Robin Hood 1938. There are two colorized versions of this movie and I suggest you see both. First came the Goodtimes version colorized by American Film Technologies. Then came Genius Entertainment's version colorized by Legend Films. The reason I say you should see them both is to see all the different color choices used by both ""labs"". A few examples are. In the G T version Stannie Dumm wears a green top and light blue tights. The L F version colored his top blue and his tights yellow. One shows orange spilt paint the other shows white spilt paint. Mother Goose's hat is Black in this, but reddish brown in the other. The comparisons are nearly endless. Now to focus on this edition only. The picture is nicely restored but it's too bright and does require some turning down of the brightness setting. Also there are no subtitles or commentary track. I would have gladly given up some of the bonus features in favor of a mini documentary on the making of this movie. In closing I would like to say I've ""seen"" this movie many times but never really watched it as closely as I have with this dvd. And all I can say is, Wow! This really is a great movie. The original title may have been ""Babes In Toyland"" which is actually shown in the opening credits of the DVD, but to me and countless others, this will always be in our hearts MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS.",1203292800,,1815,4.553516819571866

721636,3,6303625800,"I have now watched both the Goodtimes colourized version and this Legend version.  For me it comes down to this:

The Goodtimes has the best saturation, better overall colour, and better contrast without exposing the print too much to bleach out details.  It is also a cleaner print.  However, it is not exactly in focus (or seems to be a little in ""double-focus""), and the beginning is the ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" credits instead of the original ""Babes in Toyland"".  I found that I did get used to the odd focus, and I do prefer the movie in colour over B&W.

The Legend version is very sharp and clear, has the original titles with its snippet of animation.  But, it is a washed-out print with highlights burned out, and overall has a greenish-cast, which is unpleasant.  (Maybe you can adjust for this on your DVD monitor.)

The Legend black-and-white version does appear to be simply the colourized print with the colour turned off.  It, too, is a bit washed out, and has a few nicks here and there that are not on other prints.  I saw this movie at Stanford Theatre in the 1990s, and the print was pristine, so it seems the movie is still in good condition.  Maybe some of these DVD companies should start working with Stanford Theatre.

One last comment is on the sound:  The Goodtimes print is louder and full, without distortion.  The Legend sound is very intelligible, but at the cost of being hissy and shrill.  This is most noticeable in the beginning, and does improve a little after a few minutes.",1199491200,7,1517,4.58364312267658

721683,5,6303625800,"The ""review"" from Robert Badgley of March Of The Wooden Soldiers is certainly not the truth and clearly appears to be written by someone with a strange agenda. I suggest he get his facts straight before writing such a misleading, false and defamatory review. Amazon reviews are intended to inform, not mislead and misinform.

I was personally responsible for producing the prior color release from Goldwyn and I am also responsible for producing the current color and black and white release from Legend Films.

This was truly a lost Laurel and Hardy film. Film prints of this movie have gone from distributor to distributor and are well worn. However, both Goldwyn and a renowned distributor and collector provided 35mm material to produce a complete print that is widely recognized to be the highest quality. In my previous colorization company, American Film Technologies, I transferred that 35mm print to analog one-inch video tape. While extremely inferior by today's standards, one-inch video tape was the industry standard in video resolution at the time.

Now, for the FIRST TIME the Goldwyn film of March Of The Wooden Soldiers has been transferred Digitally in High Definition. The black and white High Definition tape, was completely restored using the Legend Films proprietary restoration technology. Then with the latest colorization process the film was colorized in High Definition resolution. This is the same Legend Films process used by Martin Scorsese to produce color special effects for The Aviator. The resulting color frames were then used to create a new High Definition colorized version. So you have on the Legend Films DVD, both the fully restored black and white version and a separate, fully restored color version.

By every measure, I believe the Legend Films DVD release is the highest quality black and white and color version of March Of The Wooden Soldiers that exists anywhere today.

721684,2,6303625800,"I read the all the glowing reviews of this DVD recently and thought for the modest price this might be something worth trying. Who knows,I thought,maybe someone has got it right finally. Well dear readers they have NOT got it right. It is not as bad as it might be but the over-glowing hype and deception of the previous reviews leads me to think that 1)they are not as informed as they should be about the product they are reviewing and 2)one or more might be getting paid by the company who produced this DVD.
Whatever the case is,here is the TRUTH about this release.
The prints used in this DVD is the COLOURIZED /91 Goldwyn print that we all remember. It says so,clearly at the end of the B&W version!! ""Genius"",the outfit who brings us this ""marvel"" in restoration has just remastered that colourized Goldwyn print and simply turned ""off"" the colours for its' B&W offering here!! The colourized version in turn has again been remastered and the washed out look that was extant on the original version print has just been cleaned up. The colours look clearer...that's all. It is still colourized and LOOKS it.
As far as completeness goes it isn't technically complete nor in its' original form. The original film opened with the music and a motion picture producers production code logo at the beginning. This is NOT here. Instead we are seeing the DVD companies' logo instead. On both versions.
There is a now famous frame jump in the sequence in the cave where the Boys and Bopeep and Tom-Tom are hiding from the Bogeymen. When the bogeymen pass the frame jumps quickly to them leaving their hiding spot. It is extant in BOTH versions so you know it's the exact same print they are using. At the end of the B&W version they at least leave in the Goldwyn credits but because this company did their own little ""bit"" in fiddling with the colour they left them out in the colourized version,making it seem like it's a new print.
What the company DID do is 1).Restore the original ""Babes in Toyland"" logo at the beginning. I hadn't seen this for years and it is a welcome sight.
and 2) Did some minor clean up on the Goldwyn print so in B&W it does look alot crisper.
But that's it folks,that's all. Nothing really new and improved here. You really do get what you pay for and at this price(and what they were including with it)the old alarm bells were going off big time in my head. But as I said I was at least willing to try,considering the glowing reviews I had read.
There are alot of little extras that come with this DVD.An animated Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer story(cheap),some vintage TV commercials and newsreel shorts(interesting),a not bad print of ""Tree in the Test Tube""(their /43 colour war short),and some more slight tidbits.
Just to recap.
The prints on this DVD are the original Goldwyn colourized prints...just prettied up some. The colourized version has been worked on and isn't as bad as its' parent print(remember that awful washed out colour?) but it is still NOTHING to write home about. Someone will have to do ALOT better than this to convince me about the colourization process. Until then leave these movies as they were meant to be seen...please! The B&W version here is the colour version,with the colour off!!
Remember what a ""restored,original version"" is. It should start with the company credits in the pre-movie stage,not superimposed over or replacing the original opening credits of the movie itself. The movie should run in toto. After the end credits are finished(with NO superimposed or replaced company credits) THEN but only then should any thing else be seen. The movie itself from start to finish is on its' own...period. But that's not how this and so many other cheap companies such as this one present their product.
Also the jacket on this DVD like so many,many other jackets use those neat sounding words like ""remastered"",""high definition"",""original"",""rare"",etc,etc. It's becoming a favourite trick of alot of these cheap outfits who will try anything short of outright lying to get your hard earned money. Don't be fooled and read between the lines. And while I rarely comment on previous reviews,I'd just like to say shame on them for also being a part of this deception,willingly or otherwise.
This company ""Genius"", should try and get some. Couldn't hurt.
As for the review of My review that follows this,let me say the following.
You will notice the author has conveniently danced around,with much bravado(and little else) each and everyone of my points of contention concerning his ""product"",citing his past involvement with the print,and the amazing hi-def procedure he used etc,etc......countering NONE of them. Truth is he can't and I stand behind this review totally. So,buyer beware. If you have the money to blow,go ahead and take your chances. I am telling you we have yet to see a proper and complete restoration of ""Babes in Toyland"" yet on DVD along the lines of the currently available Laurel and Hardy product by Turner/MGM of ""Bonnie Scotland"" and ""Fra Diavalo"" for example. THAT is how movies properly restored should be presented. This DVD is just a poor wanna be.",1189987200,16,5141,4.803611738148984
721685,5,6303625800,"Legend Films presents ""MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS"" (Released 14 December 1934) (77 mins) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- now in COLOR and Glorious Black and White --- Babes in Toyland (re-released in 1948 as March of the Wooden Soldiers, alternative titles Laurel and Hardy in Toyland, Revenge Is Sweet, Wooden Soldiers) is a 1934 musical comedy film starring Laurel and Hardy. Based on Victor Herbert's popular 1903 operetta Babes in Toyland, the film was produced by Hal Roach, directed by Charley Rogers and Gus Meins, and released to theatres on November 12, 1934 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

Under Gus Meins  (Director), Charles Rogers  (Director), Hal Roach  (Producer), Frank R. Butler  (Screenwriter), Nick Grinde  (Screenwriter), Francis Corby  (Cinematographer), Art Lloyd  (Cinematographer), Victor Herbert  (From Musical by), Harry Jackson  (Musical Direction/Supervision), Howard Jackson  (Musical Direction/Supervision), Glen MacDonough  (Songwriter), Bert Jordan  (Editor), William Terhune  (Editor) - - - - The 1934 version likewise features most of the characters in the stage version, but, again, an entirely new plot --- The film featured only five musical numbers from the enormous stage score, though that was plenty for a musical with only a 78-minute running time. Included in the film, in the order in which they were performed, were ""Toyland"", ""Never Mind Bo-Peep"", ""Castle in Spain"", ""Go To Sleep (Slumber Deep)"", and ""March of the Toys"", an instrumental piece and perhaps the most famous number in the score --- Almost all of the songs were performed by Bo Peep and Tom-Tom and none of them were performed by Laurel and/or Hardy (though they briefly danced/marched to ""March of the Toys"") --- the performances still hold up well in this day and age.

the cast includes:
Stan Laurel ...  Stannie Dum
 Oliver Hardy ...  Ollie Dee
 Charlotte Henry ...  Little Bo-Peep
 Felix Knight ...  Tom-Tom Piper
 Henry Brandon ...  Silas Barnaby (as Harry Kleinbach)
 Florence Roberts ...  Mother Widow Peep
 Virginia Karns ...  Mother Goose
 Marie Wilson ...  Mary Quite Contrary
 Johnny Downs ...  Little Boy Blue
 Richard Alexander ...  King's Guard

1. Stan Laurel  (aka: Arthur Stanley Jefferson)
Date of Birth:  16 June 1890 - Ulverston, Cumbria, England, UK
Date of Death:  23 February 1965 - Santa Monica, California

2.  Oliver Hardy  (aka: Oliver Norvell Hardy)
 Date of Birth:  18 January 1892 - Harlem, Georgia
Date of Death:  7 August 1957 - North Hollywood, California

In 2006, the complete print was restored and colorized by Legend Films, using the latest technology --- Although the Legend Films release was advertised under its reissue title, both the color and black and white prints featured the original title and opening credits --- Both colorized versions correctly depict Stan's hair as being auburn, not medium brown as it appears in other colorized Laurel and Hardy movies.

Laurel and Hardy were an American-based comedy duo who became famous during the early half of the 20th century for their work in motion pictures --- The members of the duo were the thin British-born-and-reared Stan Laurel and his heavier American partner from the state of Georgia, Oliver Hardy --- The pair are considered among the most famous and finest double acts in cinema history --- Each brought talents from his solo career to the team.

The two comedians worked together briefly in 1919 on The Lucky Dog released in 1921 --- After a period appearing separately in several short films for the Hal Roach studio during the 1920s, they began appearing in movie shorts together in 1926, and Laurel and Hardy officially became a team in 1927 --- They became Hal Roach's most famous and lucrative stars --- Among their most popular and successful films were the features Sons of the Desert (1933), Way Out West (1937), and Block-Heads (1938); and the shorts Big Business (1929), Helpmates (1932), and their Academy Award-winning short, The Music Box (1932).

The pair left the Roach studio in 1940, then appeared in eight low-budget comedies for 20th Century Fox and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer --- From 1945 to 1950, they did not appear on film and concentrated on their stage show --- They made their last film, Atoll K, in France in 1950 and 1951 before retiring from the screen --- In total, they appeared together in 106 films --- They starred in 40 short sound films, 32 short silent films and 23 feature films, and in the remaining 11 films, had a guest or cameo appearance. (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

It is very well done the colors do not look fake and bring out the details of the film which one could not always see in B and W. This movie color or  Black and White is a true wonder to see. It is a gift from the not so distant past. The back drops and props bring in memories of the grand old amusement parks like Coney Island,  or roadside America and The late Great Danbury Fair in CT.

721746,5,6303625800,"March of the Wooden Soldiers/Babes in Toyland was one of those movies that brought pleasant memories to each and every Holiday season since my childhood.  I purchased the ""colorized"" version so that I could share some of that Holiday magic with my grandchildren.  My granddaughter watched it four times in one day, including the black and white version just so she could see what PaPa saw when he was a kid.  I believe she will share this movie with her children and grandchildren in years to come.

Although there were a few fuzzy moments early on in the movie, the colorization was fantastic.  Hard to believe it was originally a black and white movie.  Having both the old Black & White and the new colorized version on the same disk was like getting two movies for the price of one.  Also, the old b&w toy commercials were great.  Amazing what we played with back then compared to XBOX or Playstation 3!

The movie itself was a bit corny, the characters were child like and the Bogey monsters looked like mom's old shag carpeting come to life.  My granddaughter couldn't take her eyes off the TV.  At first she laughed at the singing (after all I told her, it is a musical!)  By the third viewing, she knew the words to the songs.

I loved every minute of the movie.  The three little pigs were my granddaughter's favorite and we all enjoyed the mouse and the cat and the fiddle.",1169078400,8,1383,4.502008032128514

721749,5,6303625800,"Before purchasing this DVD, I owned only one other colorized movie: the Goodtimes DVD of ""March of the Wooden Soldiers."" That wasn't a bad colorization (and the disc has an Oliver Hardy interview and some home movie footage, so if you've got it, keep it), but this new version from Legend Films is better.

I've owned copies of this title on everything from super 8 film to DVD, and this is the best print I've ever seen, from opening titles (complete with the ""Babes in Toyland"" title card) to the end. Previous colorizations had telltale remnants of the black & white source material; for instance, the water in the ducking pond usually remained gray. And previous renditions of Bo-Peep made poor Charlotte Henry look like a misbegotten Easter egg. Legend's coloring leaves all this behind, but it doesn't make you run for your sunglasses. In fact, the black and white print is on the same disc. I can take it either way. This movie has always seemed like one that should have been made in color.

There are some interesting extras, including Max Fleischer's sugary ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, a clip of the Our Gang kids singing a New Year's greeting, yet another print of ""The Tree in a Test Tube,"" and some toy commercials. A nice package, overall, but Stan and Ollie are the main event.",1168041600,7,1297,4.709251101321586

Barnaby is outraged when he discovers the truth about the wedding and he summons the Bogeymen from their caverns to destroy Toyland once and for all.

Without a doubt Legend Films / Genius Entertainment has given us the best version of ""March of The Wooden Soldiers"" I've ever seen. The newly restored black and white version is truly amazing and the picture quality is spectacular. The restored black and white version is why I bought this DVD from Legend Films. I've never been in favor of colorizing a classic movie like ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" but after watching it in color all I can say is wow!  The colors are vibrant and they add a new dimension to the overall viewing experience. Legends black & white version beats Passport's version hands down and blows Goodtimes version out of the water.

The restoration is great, one of the best I have seen.  I watched the Black and White version first because I didn't want to be turned off by a lame colorization attempt.  When I did watch the colorized version I was pleasantly surprised with the exceptional quality.  The extra money for the November 2006 release is well spent.

721776,5,6303625800,"Beware the colorized versions of this film, they were created during the early days of the colorization craze begun by Ted Turner's folks, and they are a disgrace. This pristine edition preserves the original black & white photography, which is an art unto itself. If you have family or friends who refuse to watch a film because it is black & white, shame on them - they are truly missing out. Especially this film, which features not only the fabulous comedy team of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, but innovative (for the time) sets, costumes and makeup. There is even a small monkey in a Mickey Mouse costume that would probably make PETA cringe today, but remains a very effective image in the film. This has to be one of the cleanest DVDs of this movie I have seen and features a silent short with a solo Stan Laurel (""The Lucky Dog""). While not as glossy as ""Babes in Toyland"", ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" is essentially the same story but with more humor, slapstick, and an overall look and feel that makes this - in my humble opinion - a superior treatment.",1152662400,9,1067,4.533678756476684

As it became harder to find, we made a VHS copy of a broadcast, and would watch that each year at Christmas. Needless to say, this DVD is a great improvement.

The movie has a special charm which is sustained through repeated viewings. I'm not sure how much the memory of our family watching it at Christmas time each year impacts my objectivity, but to me it projects a warmth and a reminder of simpler times that brings back many tender memories.

It's Laurel and Hardy at their best.",1152576000,4,757,4.323943661971831

The bogey-men are scary and you should preview this before showing it to young children.

Stan expressed regrets that the movie was filmed in black and white, but if it had been done in color, the unstable medium of the time might have deteriorated (or vanished, as did their ""The Rogue Song""). So here it is, the way he'd wished for. And for what it's worth, Stan's hair was auburn, but not a blazing red. Whoever supervised the colorizing got this small, but important, detail right.

721830,4,6303625800,"The creepiest movie of the 1900's starts out with Stan and Ollie (played by Laurel and Hardy) sleeping in a bed together, laughing and giggling because of a feather falling on their faces. They wake up to an eerie ""Toyland Toon"" that gives me Goosebumps every time (oh God, I still have nightmares about it), and the town is in a perpetual state of chaos. From here on out, the film enters a deep downward-spiral of horror, blatant homosexuality, creepy soldiers and boogie-men, and Silas Barnady (the proclaimed ""meanest person in town"") who has an outrageously unhealthy, sexual obsession with Little Bo Peep who is about sixteen-years-old to his fifty-five (those are rough, superficial estimates, mind you).

The homosexuality between Stan and Ollie isn't horrifying by any means, but to a four or five-year-old, it could present deep, psychological scars and it could skew their own sexuality forever. This movie is NOT a children's film despite what you may have heard from friends or other reviewers. It is an adult horror film that is incredibly scary. Now, it is true that my VHS copy has horrid sound that only adds to the scariness, but this film is still creepy no matter what way you look at it (the B&W version isn't quite as scary for some reason). I highly recommend this film for parties where you want to stay up late and watch creepy flicks.

Another freaky scene is where Stan and Ollie are placed in these complex bucket contraptions, tied to them, and then dunked underwater simply for the King's sick amusement. Laurel gives out an ear-piercing, androgynous scream right before he submerges into the murky waters, and that alone gives me the willies.

The film ends on a horrifying note: Boogie men raid the town and barge into people's homes uninvited. I'm not sure how it ends (I haven't seen it in four or five years), but somehow the good-guys (Stan and Ollie) win, and some Peter-Pan-esque character marries Little Bo Peep, and the ""Toyland Toon"" plays again, and the town still appears to be in a never-ending disorder.

Extraordinary as it may seem, this film is the scariest movie I've ever scene (Halloween, Psycho, or Child's Play don't even hold a candle to this horror-masterpiece). Buy it immediately. I am a film-purist, but even I have to admit that the colorized version is superior. You can still turn some knobs on your television and make it B&W anyway, so this is the better buy.

A role not unlike the one he would go on to play in the Our Gang short""Our Gang Follies of 1938""four years later. Stan and Ollie's eventual interaction with the other three characters mentioned,becomes another highlight that seems to make the duo heros in the end. The studio set of Toyland is fascinating too. I've seen the colorized version. Though I'm not much of a fan of computer colorization,I must say it did add colour to Toyland.",1138579200,,775,4.969230769230769
721833,4,6303625800,"When I was a youth, I often watched MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS on our local independent TV station on Thanksgiving afternoon.  Would it still seem witty and fun a generation later when I was old and crochety, I wondered?  I ordered the DVD and found myself surprised and delighted.

Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy deliver a bold yet campy performance as two inept assistants to the Toymaker of Toyland, a surreal fairy tale monarchy where summary justice, cruel landlords and maudlin Victor Herbert songs intertwine the viol, the violet, and the vine.

The unlikely and supremely witty duo must overcome their generic ineptitude and save Toyland when the evil Barnaby unleashes bogeymen on paradise in a fit of unrequited love.

721834,5,6303625800,"Our local FOX affiliate always shows this movie on a Saturday afternoon in the middle of December and I always watch it.  It's nowhere near laurel & Hardy's best film but it's enjoyable in a quirky sort of way.  The boys play Stanley Dee and Ollie Dum living in Toyland, sort of a real life Mother Goose land with the Three Little Pigs, the Old Woman in the Shoe, Little Bo Peep, and all the rest.  The boys live with the Old Woman in the shoe and are trying to help her come up with the money for her mortgage that she owes to the evil Barnaby.

The boys get a job with the toymaker and end up messing up an order for toy soldiers and making 100 six foot tall soldiers instead of 600 foot tall soldiers.  The toymaker fires them and now Bo Peep, the Woman in the Shoe's daughter is forced to marry the snide Mr. Barnaby so her mother can keep her home. Stan & Ollie fool Barnaby into Marrying STan instead.  Barnaby then gets Tom Tom, Bo Peeps real fiancee, banished into Bogeyland for supposedly killing one of the three little pigs.

Stan & Ollie go into Gogeyland to rescue Tom Tom from the bogeymen who are guys dressed up in some rather cheesy looking, furry outfits with bestial masks.  Barnaby sends the Bogeyman to attack Toyland and the residents are helpless until Stan and Ollie remember those 100 toy soldiers who are ready to march.  The sight of the toy soldiers marching out to the trumpets still gives me goosebumps!

The set pieces of Toyland are really gorgeous and Stan & Ollie are funny as always.  The only real bad point would be some of the horrendous musical numbers.  Still a holiday classic!",1132617600,3,1618,4.374581939799331

I consider myself a film purist, and usually stay away from ""colorized"" versions of black and white films. However, since reading that Stan Laurel regretted that this film was not shot in color, I took a chance and purchased the original VHS copy. It looked very good, and the colorization was natural. When it came out on laserdisc, I purchased it again, and it looked even better. Now I have purchased the DVD version, and it looks even better! The color only enhances the fantasy of Toyland.

This restored print includes much that was cut out during televised showings of the past, and is as complete a version as you are likely to see. Picture quality is amazingly sharp. Contrast is perfect. This film looks like it was shot recently, and in original color.

721871,5,6303625800,"It's odd, isn't it, that the best-known, best-loved feature film made by Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy was a story of childhood, based on an operetta about ""Babes in Toyland"" and full of wonderful, natural-acting children. It's an odd coincidence because throughout their career, Stan and Babe (Ollie's real-life nickname) were often referred to by characters in their films, and even fellow Hal Roach employees, as ""The Boys.""

There was indeed something childlike about the big, self-important Ollie, who always tried to boss Stan, and became peevish whenever things went wrong; and the vacant-eyed, amiable Stan, who couldn't understand why Ollie got so upset with him all the time. This movie fits them like a glove. The Victor Herbert songs, while simple, have a heart-breaking beauty about them (think of the songs from ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and you may suspect you've found where Walt Disney got the idea for those tunes and lyrics). The comedy sequences are uniformly well done and funny (especially those with Stan and Ollie, but the others, too). And it's amazing to think that Henry Kalmbach Brandon (Barnaby) was just 21; Charlotte Henry (Bo-Peep) just 20, and Felix Knight (Tom Tom) only 18 when the film was made. It was a child's movie in more ways than one!

Like some of your other reviewers, I well remember the first time I saw ""The March of the Wooden Soldiers,"" on TV in the early 1950s as a child. It struck such a chord with me that I almost cried with happiness (sounds corny, but it's true). And the one thing I always regretted about the movie was, it was made in black and white.

Now I have a VHS of the colorized version, and it looks just as I had imagined it would look, lo those many years ago when I first saw it at Christmastime.

Thank you, Boys. You left all of us a marvelous legacy.",1120953600,2,1831,4.659442724458204

We have the mean old Mr. Baranaby who is threatening to evict Widow Peep from her shoe.  Talk about a mean villian; he is the original.

721873,3,6303625800,"This review is for the Passport Video version of ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"".
This is a marvellous print in glorious black and white of this perennial favourite still seen on TV to this day. However for some time on TV we have been getting a terribly pastey colourized version which has nothing on this relatively clean black and white version;this is the way it was meant to be seen!
Both contrast and sound in this version are very good and the movie is as complete as  one would hope.
And Passport Video would almost have had a touchdown with this movie....if it hadn't been stopped dead in its' tracks inexplicably at the one yard line!
The movie as I have said is quite complete with the original opening sequence,the musical numbers and others various scenes intact but Passport for some unfathomable reason changed the ending. The movie progresses along very well until the moment where the Boys attempt to give the Bogeymen a ""parting shot"" and the cannon reverses and gets Ollie in the behind instead. While Stan plucks away at the darts the scene suddenly ""rolls up"" from the bottom right corner to the top left. Music plays out to a dark screen. The end!??
The original ending has Stan plucking away until the scene fades onto a title card with Mother Goose and a ""They lived happily ever after"" on it. Music finishes.
What ""creative"" soul at Passport thought that they should fiddle with the original ending after going through almost the entire picture leaving things as they were?
Well here's another nice mess Passport's gotten themselves into.
What a shame because the film deserves a higher rating than I have given it but due to Passports' ""liberties"" I'm forced to downgrade it to no more than three at best.
If this ending is of no consequence to you then this version will suit you to a tee. But if you want this movie in its' original version,in good quality black and white and complete then I suggest you give this a pass.

""March of the Wooden Soldiers"", based on Victor Herbert's famed 1903 operetta, ""Babes In Toyland"", is one such timeless masterpiece. The greatest comedy team in films, Stan Laurel & Oliver Hardy, star in this elaboarate musical fairytale of innocence and optimism.
  The boys are Stannie Dum and Ollie Dee, hapless employees of Toyland's toy factory, who room in Old Mother Peep's shoe. Faced with eviction by they evil Silas Barnaby (Henry Brandon. Credited as Harry Kleinbach), Mother Peep (Florence Roberts) needs to raise her mortgage. But the boys' plan to get the money from the Toymaker (William Burress) goes awry. It seems Santa Claus (Ferdinand Munier) ordered 600 wooden soldiers one foot tall. But, unfortunately (as fate would have it), Stannie took the order. And the result is 100 soldiers six feet tall. The boys are fired.
  An attempt to steal the mortgage from Barnaby's house ends in the boys being found guilty of burglary. Sentenced to be dunked and exiled to Bogeyland forever, the charges are dropped by Barnaby when Bo-Peep (Charlotte Henry) consents to marry him, although she is in love with Tom-Tom the Piper's son (Felix Knight). Tricked into giving up the mortgage with a bogus wedding, Barnaby gains revenge by pignapping one of the Three Little Pigs, and planting the evidence in Tom-Tom's house. Stannie and Ollie discover the ruse.
  Chasing Barnaby into Bogeyland, they rescue Tom-Tom and Bo-Peep. But Barnaby leads the Bogeymen to destroy all of Toyland. In the thrilling finale, Stannie and Ollie activate the wooden soldiers. And to the strains of the majestic ""March of the Toys"", rout the Bogeymen and save Toyland.

I want you all to meet, the future Mrs. Piper!"" and then all the characters burst into a frenzied happy little dance to a whimsical piece of music--one of my favorite scenes in this classic adaptation of the famous Victor Herbert operetta, ""Babes in Toyland"".
You know, this is the kind of movie that could all too easily have been really awful: an operetta about nursery rhyme characters with, frankly, limited special effects? But instead, ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" is without a doubt one of the best children's movies ever produced in Hollywood. And of course, the major reason for that is that it features the supertalented duo of Laurel and Hardy as the comic relief team who wind up the stars of the movie. They and everyone else in the movie play their roles in the sincerest possible way. That's why this movie is so good to show any child, no matter how young: there's nothing cynical in the movie, no one with a hidden nasty agenda peeking through. Sure, it can be a scary movie, alright, but meaness is punished and goodness rewarded.
Think about the wacky costumes of the bogeymen who are lead by evil Silas Barnaby to attack Toyland via raft. Rubber masks and hula skirts worn over longjohns, or so they seem. How on earth could 21st century children find that anything but laughable, with the best computer-generated villains in films today? But it just goes to show you that glitz isn't everything, because those little kids ARE freaked out still, to see the bogeymen jump down when Barnaby summons them in the cave. One of the other reviewers is right when he says that somehow this movie reaches right into childhood itself, what I would think is the German, Brothers Grimm part of childhood, of ""things"" under the bed. Today's creepy villains are made to frighten sophisticated adults, who've seen it all before. But that's over the head of children, really--rubber-faced bogeymen are all it takes! I think another appealing aspect is that most of the characters, even if they are all really adults, somehow seem like children pretending to be adults-that's even true of a relatively minor character like King Cole as well as for Tom-Tom and Bo-Peep, our leading man and lady. The un-bogeymen parts therefore have a sweetness to them that hearkens from very early chidhood, the kind you see in a Jessie Wilcox Smith painting. And the timing of Laurel and Hardy is perfect: they are just tops!
This movie played faithfully in the NYC area every year on Thanksgiving Day, duly followed (for some reason) by ""King Kong"", and I and my brothers and sisters watched it every time, from babyhood even through sullen teenage years, without ever poking fun at it; oh no, this was (and is) still held as reverentially as though it were right up there after the Bible. Not many childhood rituals can make it unscathed through adolescence, but ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" did, and is now enjoyed by new generation Toddler Nephew.

721944,5,6303625800,"On the far end of the musical movie spectrum is the colorized Laurel and Hardy ""MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS"" from Goodtimes Home Video at a great price. As adapted from Victor Herbert's operetta ""Babes in Toyland,"" there's more of the Holiday Spirit in this 1934 classic than in most of the insipidly lame attempts of movies that exploit the holiday season.

Dum (Stan) and Dee (Ollie) are Santa's toymakers preparing for the big delivery on Christmas eve.  Mother Goose and nursery rhyme characters are all over the place and Stan and Ollie are in constant trouble (""Is that 100 six-foot toy soldiers or 600 one-footers?"")  Silas Barnaby, (remember ""the meanest man in town""?),  Bo Peep (she's being forced into marriage by Silas or he will evict Bo's mom, who is in fact The Old Woman In The Shoe).  And there's Tom Tom the Piper's Son (Ms Peep's true love) and the big finale with the creepy attack of the Bogeymen.

This classic has been cleaned up, digitally remastered and colorized and looks about as perfect as the best of old style children's book illustrations and I bet Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy themselves would want this one in color. It's certainly no sacrilege.  This is one beautiful, Fauvistic fever dream of a movie.  A weirdly mesmerizing treat.

Laurel and Hardy forever!  Let's all love each other, OK?

That said, there is something else to be considered.

For those who dare to read between the lines (or movie frames), this film can be seen as a sly and subversive horror fest that plumbs deeply disturbing psychological and political issues not touched on in contemporary films.  I am amazed that someone hasn't examined this in detail and I have often wondered how much of it may have been intentional -- perhaps from the brilliantly demented mind of Stan Laurel.  Only on the surface is this a children's movie.",1007856000,30,1842,4.769716088328075

721947,5,6303625800,"Adapted from Victor Herbert's Opera ""Babes in Toyland"" this 1934 Laurel and Hardy Operetta presents us with a timeless Holiday Classic for the entire family to watch during the holidays.  The DVD presentation has been meticulously Remastered and Colorized (for the next generation's enjoyment and for the Black & White traditionalists just turn off the color).
Laurel & Hardy have never been better. The characters (Based on Mother Goose and popular Nursey Rhymes),the story line of Toyland(Santa's Toy making Headquarters preparing for the upcoming holiday's) & the Villian with his henchmen (Powerful Landlord and his Bogeyman Army) can't lose. The basis is an Operetta (loosely conducted) musical showcasing the infamous song, ""Babes in Toyland"".
Laurel & Hardy play Stannie Dum and Ollie Dee respectively Santa's toymaker workers who are in constant trouble.  Stannie accepts a Xmas toy order but mixes it up and he and Ollie are fired. (Mistakens the order of 600 soldiers at 1 foot tall for 100 soldiers at 6 foot tall, can you imagine?). Along with the Villian Landlord, Silas Barnaby trying to evict the ""Old Woman in the Shoe"" for non payment sets the story for this Family Christmas Classic, ""MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLIERS""!!!!!
You & the family will love and laugh continuously!!  A great value. A must for the Holiday library!!!!",1004054400,50,1339,5.13302752293578
721948,2,6303625800,"This film is perhaps an all time classic, i have watched this film endlessly over the years. My only complaint with this version is that it is in colour. This film despite it's fantasical elements is actually in black and white. What a dissapointment.",1004054400,,251,4.7272727272727275
721949,4,6303625800,"March of the Wooden Soldiers (Babes in Toyland) is one of a few Laurel and Hardy features in which Hal Roach lost ownership.  Over the years it has been reissued and mostly cut in the process on the grounds of the Bogeymen sequences being too grim or to remove some or all of the songs in a misguided attempt to concentrate Stan and Ollie`s scenes.  It is only fairly recently that a complete pristine master has been produced and superbly computer colourised now looking better than it has for decades.
In its original form it is the best of the Laurel and Hardy operettas and, with its detailed studio created fantasy sets, is the most elaborate of all of their features.
The colour version is so carefully effected that it gives the appearance of an early Technicolour film providing  an extra dimension and depth reinforcing a more credible Mickey Mouse and the Three Pigs which was not quite achieved in black and white.
 Stan Laurel once said that his only regret about this film was that it had not been made in colour.  This is probably the only Laurel and Hardy film to really benefit and be enhanced by an accurate  colorisation.
The film is a successful attempt to appeal to all ages. It is interesting to note that Disney granted permission to use Mickey Mouse and the Three Pigs together with their theme song.  Perhaps `Toyland` may just have given Walt some inspiration for his first Disneyland. In fact Disney studied this film quite closely and remade it under the original title `Babes in Toyland` with obvious mimics of Stan and Ollie, but it was a poor, jazzed-up,  shadow of the original.
This version produced by Goodtimes Video, NY is very good.  The picture quality and definition are excellent with superb colour rendering for a colourised movie.  The sound is unfortunately the original mono track and somewhat flat.  Nevertheless, it is good to see a high quality complete version  including the original opening MGM titles which, oddly, is missing from the UK version of the film released by Eureka Video.
There are some interesting and unusual extras such as the original theatrical trailer a short (1.5 mins)  probably 16mm silent home movie of Stan and a 3.5 min sound interview of Ollie. The extras are of varying quality due to the source material.
Overall this DVD presents a good quality, excellent value, version of a delightful, enduring minor classic.

721950,5,6303625800,"Originally released in 1934 as ""Babes in Toyland,"" this film is far and away the best of the Laurel & Hardy operettas.  The evil Barnaby (Henry Brandon), wants to force the lovely Bo-Beep (Charlotte Henry) to marry him.  Towards this end Barnaby banishes Bo-Beep's beloved Tom-Tom (Felix Knight) and attempts to take over Toyland with his demon army.  Fortunately, Stannie Dum and Ollie Dee, the assistants of the Toymaker (William Burgess), save the day with the help of the marvelous giant-sized Wooden Soldiers.  Based on the operetta by Victor Herbert (several songs are omitted), this film was directed by Gus Meins and Charles Rogers, and is much superior to the Disney version that ended up replacing it on television.  You will find less slapstick than usual in a Laurel & Hardy film, but the boys are better integrated into this musical than any of there others and Brandon's Barnaby is deliciously wicked.  Fortunately ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" has been restored and is now available so it can become the classic it deserves to be.",991180800,9,1046,4.948571428571428
721951,5,6303625800,This dvd shows what can be done with sensitive and controlled colorization. It is a shame many of the other computer coloured L & H films are not up to this standard. A real pleasure to watch with the colour giving the feel of a modern movie - and it was made over 60 years ago! It would make a great introduction to Laurel and Hardy for today's young children.,984614400,5,361,4.171428571428572
721952,5,6303625800,"...But it may be something more genuinely childlike.  Comparing the films is interesting, as they were both children's musicals of the same era.  While ""Oz"" gives its source a high-budget mounting that stresses reassurance and a suburban outlook, ""March..."" seems to plunge wildly into the very soul of childhood.  True, the 1903 operetta borrowed from Norse mythology and Victorian melodrama, but this filming is astute and timeless--full of the true glee, horror, pain, chaos, and eeriness of childhood.  I loved ""Oz"" as a child, but this movie was unforgettable: the wistful, melancholic score, cruel humor, stark terror, bursts of frenzied joy, and aura of creepiness struck deep in me.  No matter what benign illusions we eventually form about childhood, this is how the world truly looks at a certain age.  I watched it with a jolt of recognition, and, finally, liberation.
""March...""'s modest budget is more than made up for by its emotional genuineness.  Listen for the latent sadness in the melodies, watch for the decidedly sinister cast to the sets and even the most whimsical Mother Goose characters, marvel at the berserk energy of the finale.  If ""Oz"" were a Disney feature cartoon, this film would be a Hieronymous Bosch painting adapted for children by the Fleischer Brothers.  It has a similar sense of turmoil, unease, primal beauty, and hilarity.  Children growing up on the perky, bland kids' movies of today will be exhilarated.  And Lewis Carroll, Roald Dahl, and other true geographers of the childhood soul would have approved.",977356800,4,1551,5.139442231075697

722001,1,6303625800,"What was once shown on television around the Thanksgiving-Xmas seasons over 30 years ago is not what is on this video.  There is at least a good five (5) minutes missing from it.  The scene is where Tom-Tom has been  banished to Bogey-Land and Bo-Peep is with him.  He sings to her to go to  sleep as they are both very tired.  It is evident that this was copied from  television and edited to take out the commercials.  I believe the person  copying this from TV was in the kitchen getting something to eat while this  was being edited.
I wanted my children (ages five to eleven) to witness  classic humor and a wonderful story.  However, even though they did not  know what was missing, it was evident that something was not right.
I  feel it is a sad event that what we remember from our childhoods cannot be  the same of which we wish to share with our children.
The movie is a  classic if it isn't colorized. To see it in its original B&W version is  wonderful.
