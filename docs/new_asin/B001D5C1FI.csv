3525695,5,B001D5C1FI,"don't ask how an item  not  for  sale can  be reviewed...this aired on HBO and I've watched it a half dozen times.
Like George's last DVD  (HBO Special) Life is Worth Losing, It's Bad For Ya will scare and  offend  many.  For those  wanting  the hippy dippy weatherman or  A Place for my Stuff  or Baseball/football type of humour light, this will feel like  a sledgehammer.  For  those of us who have grown  over the years with George and appreciated his loud wake up calls ...from  his dissing  George Bush 1 and  the gulf war on....this is more vintage Lion in  Winter George.  Lambasting  the child  worship culture,the fraudulant SELF ESTEEM movement,  pointing out that unlike  his father ,  Governor bush, hasn't truly been elected president in the traditional way,  and our dead relatives aren't hoovering above us guiding  us through our daily duties.  There is much more to the set..and while  I slightly prefer the previous Life is Worth Losing due to its in your face wake  up approach..there is much to enjoy here and take  note of ....George claims  that we are soft and easily placated with cellphones that make  us pancake and rub our balls!  ...and  he's right. Oh...and he suggestes if you really believe you have RIGHTS? Google Japanese Americans 1942 and  find  out about your precious RIGHTS!

RIP George Carlin...he never took the easy way...he  never flinched from the truth and he always kept growing...14 of these specials over the years ....what a treasure!!!

UPDATE:  I just got an early copy of the DVD...the bonus 7 minute performance (in color) from the Jackie Gleason show in 1969 is a riot!!! very cool to see George in a suit/tie short hair...doing a normal non-confrontational stand up...

and..the 32 minute bonus ""Too  Hip For The Room""...which I believe was pulled from a 3 hour tribute  to George...is a WONDERFUL bonus feature...I wish they would have all  3 hours but this 32 minutes is sensational...the value of this package just went up up up...

enjoy",1217289600,80,1996,4.786350148367952

He fearlessly and logically challenges all our sacred beliefs to expose the superstitions that drive our emotions and decisions.  Actually this one is probably more philosophy and critical thinking than comedy.  It hits home.

When he made this, he still had some humor in him, but the second he decided to go Angry Atheist, I clicked him off. It's okay for comedians to poke good natured fun at people, but his Angry Atheist shtick was arrogant and mean spirited.

When I saw he was going to be in my area, I jumped at the chance to see him (check one off my bucket list).  He was amazing, my face hurt from laughing.  Unfortunately that was the last time he performed in NJ, he died later that year.  This routine is a bit different from other ones, but still funny and makes you think.  I would love to see what he would say about the world today.
He had an amazing career and I still miss his humor.",1480464000,2,530,3.81651376146789
3525723,1,B001D5C1FI,"George must not have been feeling well when he taped this and it shows! Perhaps he was already dying and needed to make more money. I hate to say this because I'm a big Carlin fan. I must tell the truth. This show was embarrassingly unfunny.

I saw him a few years ago doing the same bit. He would walk over to a table with papers on it, apparently his show notes, several times during the show. When I rented this on Amazon at first I didn't recognize it before it was too late. After 5 minutes I stopped watching. You know it's a bad comedy show when he tells a dirty joke that you've heard from someone else decades before.

Save your money. View some of his earlier stuff on YouTube.

May George rest in peace. I pray God has a sense of humor and doesn't mind raunchy language for George's sake.",1479945600,2,799,4.209150326797386

At times, it almost comes across as though George knew this and would not settle for anyone but him delivering his epitaph. I'm going to take a stab in the dark and assume that you have seen at least one George Carlin performance before. His first HBO special has a very good natured feel to it and like any great artist he evolved over time. This particular special is outstanding like always, but if for some reason you have not seen it, be ready as it is George more cynical then ever. Maybe it's just knowing that this was in fact his last performance, but this is George at his darkest. I bought this individually as it is not in the comprehensive ""All of my Stuff"" collection and I would buy it again. Should you?

did not just sit on this gift. He worked and worked and made it better. Watch this and you will see.",1399766400,,456,4.010989010989011
3525827,5,B001D5C1FI,"This was George Carlin's final performance; taped before a live audience on March 1st 2008, in Santa Rosa, CA (he would pass-away later that year). In ""It's Bad For Ya"", George for one last time, treated us to his acerbic wit and one-of-a-kind comedy! Here, he examined and dissected the American cultural-landscape once again: obsession with and control of children (he called it; a sophisticated form of child-abuse), people's incessant and meaningless chatter (a form of ADD, if you ask me), stupid religious and superstitious sentiments, false patriotism, corporate and government BS, etc. If you're a George Carlin fanatic like I am, you will love and be pleased with this talented man's 'last hurrah'. Thankfully, we can always look back at his long and brilliant career, through the many DVD and album collections amassed over the years. Not to be missed! The DVD picture and sound quality by MPI is excellent. NTSC, English (English subtitles), extras, NR 69 mins.

3525859,4,B001D5C1FI,"I completely get all the ""I'm a Carlin fan but this show sucks"" reviews. Like many great humorists, George gravitated toward the dark side in the final stage of his life. Mark Twain did too (if you've forgotten, find a copy of ""Letters from the Earth""), as did Russell Baker, George S. Kaufman, Dorothy Parker, James Thurber, Robert Benchley, Frank Sullivan, Groucho, and many others. Doesn't matter.  It's still brilliant stuff; and while this is not George's best work (hence 4 stars instead of 5), it is still worth the price of admission.

Sure, it's over the top -- what Carlin material, from ""AM and FM"" on, wasn't?  And it's disturbing -- but George always enjoyed disturbing his audiences, prodding them into a bit of independent contemplation. And like most Carlin material, it is not for small children, or for self-righteous Fox News Channel devotees.  Granted, it is not your typical comedy show; but George was far from your typical comedian.",1355184000,2,955,4.913043478260869

I suppose maybe he was beginning to feel his own mortality, or maybe that razor-sharp mind was beginning to slip a bit.  In any case, just felt like there was a lot of plain old meanness and contempt in this performance that overwhelmed the humor.

As for this DVD, I am thrilled that this, his last special before his death, was as profane and unapologetic as it was intelligent and insightful. This is nuclear grade stuff. Carlin was clearly the comedic anomaly in that he got sharper, more erudite, meaner (and funnier!) as he got older. Like many of the good things in life, this show is ""Bad For Ya,"" but you'll love it too much to leave it alone.

He is one guy who can take sensitive subjects (death, religion, etc.), and make great humor out of it even if he does make fun of them (which i don't mind at all considering my personal feelings towards religion and death), and I just can't stop laughing the whole way through.  He also is very original by thinking of things people never do, such as the cliche topics and conversation and phrases at funerals and weddings.  He also makes you think with the analogies.  It's incredible what this genius George Carlin comes up with.  I also agree with almost everything he talks about and says.  I recommend this DVD to anyone who is NOT easily offended by anything, and who takes everything pretty lightly and is wiling to hear a lot of off color jokes.  It is by far my favorite comedy DVD I have EVER seen!!",1303171200,3,960,4.573099415204679

3525872,4,B001D5C1FI,"`It's Bad For Ya' is George Carlin's last recorded comedy concert before his death and from the word go you get his usual uncompromising, irreverent brand of humour. Walking around his living room set he shares with us his thoughts on a variety of topics and although he comes across as angry and cynical, he was also very intelligent and pertinent. Carlin's style is very reminiscent of Bill Hicks, and he even uses some of the same phrases at times, and if you like one it is a good bet you will enjoy the other. This concert covers topics like old age, death, religion, child worship/Overprotected children, stupid boring people, docile public, patriotism, civic customs and rights. Pretty much what we have come to expect from Carlin over the years. There is strong language throughout and you need to not be easily offended to enjoy his style of comedy, but to be honest most comedians are more offensive and abusive these days than Carlin ever was; it's just the more conservative elements in society don't like him opening peoples eyes to the hypocrisy and lies of those in authority. That is the message this DVD leaves you with, to always question everything, and that is a great bit of advice whatever your thoughts on life. A funny show and well worth watching.

Everytime I watched the DVD I noticed there were many similarites between George Carlin and my father that I had to give this to my dad so he could laugh too.  It's classic stuff and George Carlin puts his usual spin on the subject.  Unfortunately it's his last recorded stand up DVD so it's a prize as well.

My husband and I plug in the DVD whenever there's not much on tv and/or need a good laugh.  We've watched it so often that we can recite lines to each other, especially when we're in situations that George talks about, i.e., Was it 8 years or 5?  Being around people for about a minute, minute and a half, and being an old f--k, not an old man or old fart.  Then there's the subject about placing your hand on the bible or wearing hats in church.",1286150400,,875,4.197604790419161

After it ended I searched the web for more of this style of comedy and one of the names I found more often(but even more importantly was always followed by ""awesome"", ""legend"" and ""god"") was ""George Carlin"". Few hours later I was watching ""Life's Worth Losing"" and I don't exagerate at all when I say it changed my life.

Now, I'm a fan of his work, his ideas and what he stood for and it's a real shame we lost him but it's in the hands of us, his fans, to make his words of wisdom live forever.

I admit I don't follow a religion and I myself am an atheist like George Carlin but after seeing many of my family members pass on personally I do believe there is a point in everyone's life where they just know their going to pass on. This show was not meant to amuse everyone like some people seem to think it wasn't Georges usual ""Hippie dippy weatherman."" bit because he didn't want it that way. This was his final rant his last chance to tell the world what he thought and yes some of it is a repeat performance from some of his later bits but how many times has your grandfather told you the same old story? Anyways the point of this review is to let new viewers know that this DVD is not going to be wacky George Carlin its going to be George as himself getting his last few words in for everyone to hear.

In fact, I think the last couple-few HBO specials he did showed that his performances were becoming much less the brilliantly astute observational comedy used as a tool to break down absurd social constructs and instead seemed to just feature him becoming plain mean and self-righteous.  The expression ""crotchety old man"" comes to mind.

From the get go, George had me going until he left the stage when he was done, it was pure comedic genius.
HIS TAKE ON RELIGION
HIS TAKE ON LIFE
HIS TAKE ON CHILDREN
He goes on and on and on and you cannot help but sit there and think about what this man is telling you, YES, he's a comedian and YES, he's supposed to make you laugh but he also makes you think about this stuff and realize that maybe...just maybe we are all in a world of S**T!

The Special features were great too, the first one was an Interview with George taken from the Archives of American TV found at EMMYTVLEGENDS.ORG and the other was his performance 40 years ago on the Jackie Gleason Show, it was pretty funny for TV that is anyway.

I loved the DVD, it was his last performance and as far as I'm concerned, he went out on top and he'll stay there for eternity!

Rent it if you must, but don't waste money buying it.  It gets a little better in the last 15 minutes, then it's over.  Bah.",1241049600,7,442,4.341463414634147
3525923,5,B001D5C1FI,"Carlin is hilarious and his humor is fresh and timeless for the self proclaimed old fart.  It's a great video to have, but be advised that it's probably not for children or the non-controversial crowd... or maybe...it is especially for them.",1239753600,,241,4.878048780487805

3525926,5,B001D5C1FI,"This is one of his best. If you want ""true"" Carlin humor...this is perfect for you. I had tears in my eyes it was so continually funny.",1234483200,,135,4.037037037037037
3525927,4,B001D5C1FI,"I saw this on T.V. and decided to buy it both for my own entertainment and to share with others. Carlin probably is in large measure the stereotypical cynical, cranky old man. But he must be self-aware enough of that fact to wrap it all in humor. It is often a very biting humor, but he is so outrageous with some of it that it is hysterical

My favorite part is his dissection of religion. His mockery of it is rooted in a commonsensical analysis. He pokes fun at it, while genuinely believing that those who embrace the supernatural, er, bunk, are nuts.

I'm less tickled by much of his political material which strikes me as virulently anti-American and, in particular, left-wing on the loony side. But some of it is funny.

I'm not a fan of bits where he goes on too long in a sort of a Milton Berle goofiness. Just not my bag. But if you are already a Carlin fan, you'll love it. If you're not, I think it's well worth watching. You'll either be convinced that he's not for you, or you'll want to see more and more!

If you're considering this DVD, you're looking for humor, and you should buy it.",1233187200,,1102,4.309178743961352

3525930,5,B001D5C1FI,"It's funny and critical just as much as his last 3 specials before this one. It also a little bit sad to have a lot of the material on this be about death being that he died a few months after filming.

Oh well Carling, yoou are deeply missed and just like you said: ""There is no... UP THERE!""",1231459200,2,293,3.9661016949152543
3525931,5,B001D5C1FI,"George was so good for us- his intelligent, irreverant, insightful humor is especially missed these days when everyone's so conscientious abt. being ""politically correct"" that we don't even laugh at ourselves anymore and people are funny and his riffs on parenting, manners, religion, etc. are so true to life that it had me and my husband ""rolling in the aisle"" at home, his candidness, courage, insightfulnes, outrage and caring is so straight to the heart and soul.  I'm ordering more, in fact! I originally bought it as a xmas present for my husband, but I knew it would also be a present to myself as well!",1231200000,,611,4.764150943396227
3525932,1,B001D5C1FI,"George Carlin has done it again. A concert intended for laughs but ends up going much deeper. He easily attacks our beliefs and values, destroying them. Same wonderful Carlin, funny but thought provoking. Obviously much more than a comedian. He knows all the stuff we have had jammed down our throats by parents and religion and appropriately educates us all with simple logic. Who else could make one not believe in God or government? Makes a lot of sense to those willing to think and question why we are in this state. George Carlin, before his death, implored people to ask why they should believe in something with no proof. He will make you re-evaluate all that you believe in. A must see for eveyone out there. There is something that relates to us all.",1230508800,2,760,4.637037037037037
3525933,5,B001D5C1FI,George carlin has been one of mr favorite comics for many years because of his insightful way of looking at our society I'm going to miss him very much!!!,1230076800,,154,4.344827586206897
3525934,5,B001D5C1FI,"A refreshing change from his ""angry man"" shows from 1999 and 2001, this and ""Life is Worth Losing"" are a great coda to Carlin's long career. This is also probably Carlin's smartest show, while also being his least hostile. While he's aggressive and critical as always (""They never hear those all important words: ""You lost, Bobby! You're a loser!""), they're insightful - everyone can't expect to be a winner. Losing is an important part of life.

It's also George's softest, where he gives hints that he does believe (somewhat) in a higher power. While he says, ""There IS no 'up there'"", he goes on later to talk about how God would never pick favorites, and quotes Proverbs as well (""Pride cometh before the fall."") He also reveals that despite his 14 shows he actually LIKES people (in short doses) - which sets up some of the funniest lines in his long career (""You remember my neighbor with the burns on 90 percent of her body? Well, she burned the other 10 percent now. She was lighting a fart and her bush caught fire!"")

He's also visibly waning in health - his posture is somewhat hunched, his voice weaker - though crustier. One gets the impression he knows his time is short, and his musings on death and how people act at funerals seems to be his way of instructing people on how he wants to be remembered (""There goes old Georgie"".)

70 was far too young. Goodbye, Georgie.",1228262400,2,1385,4.576612903225806
3525935,5,B001D5C1FI,"Like George's last DVD (HBO Special) Life is Worth Losing, It's Bad For Ya will scare and offend many. For those wanting the hippy dippy weatherman or A Place for my Stuff or Baseball/football type of humour light, this will feel like a sledgehammer. For those of us who have grown over the years with George and appreciated his loud wake up calls ...from his dissing George Bush 1 and the gulf war on....this is more vintage Lion in Winter George. Lambasting the child worship culture,the fraudulant SELF ESTEEM movement, pointing out that unlike his father , Governor bush, hasn't truly been elected president in the traditional way, and our dead relatives aren't hoovering above us guiding us through our daily duties. There is much more to the set..and while I slightly prefer the previous Life is Worth Losing due to its in your face wake up approach..there is much to enjoy here and take note of ....George claims that we are soft and easily placated with cellphones that make us pancakes and rub our balls! ...and he's right. Oh...and he suggestes if you really believe you have RIGHTS? Google Japanese Americans 1942 and find out about your precious RIGHTS!

RIP George Carlin...he never took the easy way...he never flinched from the truth and he always kept growing...14 of these specials over the years ....what a treasure!!!
BONUS FEATURES:  ..the bonus 7 minute performance (in color) from the Jackie Gleason show in 1969 is a riot!!! very cool to see George in a suit/tie short hair...doing a normal non-confrontational stand up...

and..the 32 minute bonus ""Too Hip For The Room""...which I believe was pulled from a 3 hour tribute to George...is a WONDERFUL bonus feature...I wish they would have all 3 hours but this 32 minutes is sensational...the value of this package just went up up up...

I have say I thought Carlin was kinda losing it with his last couple of HBO specials, I didn't find ""You are all Diseased"" or ""Life is worth losing"" quite as good as previous specials, but with this latest HBO special, Carlin showed he's still master of his game.  Carlin will be missed and I'm grateful for one last masterful performance that we've been left with.",1226620800,4,591,4.221238938053097

Yes, it maybe somewhat offensive to some but not as offensive as say ""you're all deseased"". It just seems ironic the George talked so much about death and the ""so-called after life"" and it was aired on HBO only 3 and a half months before his death.

George was never afraid to tackle any subjects. He went where most people would not dare to go. Hopefully George is up there ""smiling down on us"", and getting a kick out of this current presidential election.

8291682,5,B001D5C1FI,"This is George Carlin's 14th and last HBO comedy special. The performance occurred several months before his death at age 71. He looked old and even joked about the benefits of being old, such as not having to carry packages, being able to leave parties whenever you wanted, not needing to remember things and people, and much more. He did not have his pigtails that he wore in some earlier shows. He was very alert, never stumbled. I was amazed that he could remember all of his lines, just over an hour of them. It was a perfect performance, not only didn't he ever stumble, he never added anything that he did not plan to say. He did use some profanity, but very little and only to emphasize his points. He belittled religion and the belief in God and the hereafter. He questioned many things such as what is the sense of putting a left hand on the Bible to swear? Would it work if you put your right hand on the Bible or if the Bible was in Chinese? Why is there a need to raise the right hand? Would it be ok if you raised the left hand? He mocked the idea of dead parents looking after their live children, as if they had nothing better to do. Did they need to look after grandchildren also? He also mocked the various common statements that people make when they meet a person whose relative just died. And there are many other thought-provoking ideas that he raised.",1510012800,3,1374,4.3501945525291825
