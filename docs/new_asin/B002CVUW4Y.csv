The story starts on a steam locomotive traveling the night train to Deerwood. A man and his daughter are going to meet her mother after a long absence. We hear about local elections and crime at a hotel. Chief Anderson meets his daughter on the train. The police question Lester Furman and arrest him as he is wanted by the Philadelphia police. But this picture was retouched from an earlier photo. We hear his story. [No Miranda warning.] Furman will be kept in jail until the Philadelphia police arrive. The next morning we hear what happened! D.A. Carroll complains about the death of the prisoner. The Philadelphia police say there was no warrant for Furman, it was an elaborate frame-up! Policeman Wally will question Furman's young daughter.

The Medical Doctor says the death was a murder made to look like a suicide! A couple in a hotel room talk about psychology and their criminal scheme. Furman's daughter is questioned at the police station. Mrs. Furman arrives and talks to the police about her actions. Did she miss the train on purpose? She talks about her friend Bill. Bill arrives at the hotel room to talk to the couple. Mrs. Furman tells the police chief about the plot. Wally makes a telephone call to that hotel room! Chief Anderson and Wally go to that hotel room for a dramatic meeting. The other policemen arrive to round up the gang. Anderson figured it all out before.

This unusual story would never be shown in later times on television. It is interesting, but also seems too complicated to work in real life.",1342828800,,1566,4.708029197080292

8364556,4,B002CVUW4Y,"""Two Sharp Knives"" is obviously a low budget TV movie  without names you would recognize, bit a pretty good drama in spite of the  low production values (as is said these days). It was, if I recall correctly , a CBS Studio One presentation from the live tv drama days. The quality of the drama is no doubt because it was adapted from a story by Dashiell Hammet.  The actor who plays police chief is a familiar face, but few of the other players , though they generally do a good job.
A good entertainment , especially if you have grown weary of the substitution of sex, violence and computer-generated special effects in lieu of a good story. Also the fun of being aware it was filmed live, so watch out for the not-quite-out-of the scene stage hand and the power cables behind the ""wall"" of the hotel room.",1465948800,2,807,4.402684563758389

8364559,4,B002CVUW4Y,"This is an episode of Westinghouse Studio One, an anthology series broadcast on CBS from 1948 through 1958 using different variations of the name.  The series received Emmy award nominations for most of those years.  The stories and scripts were of uniformly high quality.  Two Sharp Knives is based on a story by Dashiell Hammett originally published in Collier's in 1934.  It is one of Hammett's good mystery stories, not one of his great stories.

There are no really famous actors in this one, but the acting is very good for the most part.  The actor playing Lester Furman indulges in a little too much histrionics during the scene in which he learns that he is wanted for murder.

This program was not well preserved and the picture quality is low but acceptable.  The sound is better than the picture.  I streamed this movie via Amazon Prime so can not comment on any dvd's.",1458086400,8,881,4.6688311688311686
