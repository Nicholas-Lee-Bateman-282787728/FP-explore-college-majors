Rather, this is unbelievably cheap, very low-brow entertainment (and I use that word very loosely) that just so happens to feature eight heroes with supernatural powers who are, at best, very bad caricatures of the Eight Immortals. There is no other connection to the Eight Immortals.

Unless you have memorized all of the lines to all of the bad movies ever shown on the SciFi Channel, I cannot think of a single reason to buy or watch this movie. Actually, I should apologise to the SciFi Channel because they would never show anything this bad. Mystery Science Theater 3000 would not even consider this movie. It's that bad.

Lest there be any misunderstanding, I enjoy ""B"" movies, but the alphabet doesn't have enough letters beyond ""Z"" to properly categorize this... whatever it is.

My copy will be up on eBay in the near future and it will be priced to move.
