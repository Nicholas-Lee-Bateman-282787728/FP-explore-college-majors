1885158,5,B00009MGF8,"okay, this is not a very original begining for a review, because lots and lots of people have used it before, but.. YAMI NO MATSUEI [ Decendents of Darkness ] IS TEH GREATEST ANIME EVER! there, i said it. but its completely true! i first started reading the manga, which was by far breath taking an great. the art, the story line, it was so great! then, as i'm sure other have done, i decided i needed to watch the anime. i was, however, only a little disapointed, because it was so short, the complete series being a simple 13 episodes long. The awsome graphics and story line are great though, an all out great buy!!! i cant say much more, really, just.. you have to see it!! i recomend sticking with the japanese dubed version though ^^;; the english is kind of brutal....",1074470400,9,775,4.388888888888889
1885159,5,B00009MGF8,"I have quite a few anime series and movies. I bought a lot of them based on reviews since I have only been watching anime with a couple of years. A lot of the reviews for the anime's I bought often start out with 'this is the best anime I have ever seen' and indeed I have found in a lot of cases the anime's like Akira, Cowboy Bebop, Amon Saga and so on were really good. However for me 'Descendants of Darkness' are on a level all of their own. Nothing I have seen in other anime's quite compare with the brilliant artwork, the dark and moody atmosphere creepily gothic in places. The characters are well fleshed out so you actually get to care for them. I found 'X' and 'Vampire D a little disappointing in this respect. I am an adult and wanted adult themes i.e. real life concerns not pornography. While some sexual scenes are dealt with they are not too explicit or invasive of the overall plots. 'Descendants of Darkness' is a DVD set to treasure whether you are into yaoi or not. The story satisfies on many levels and has a broad appeal not just as yaoi. The character Tsuzuki reminds me of Fox Mulder of the X Files in many ways, a delight to watch. There are also comic moments which are a hoot affording some relief from the darker moments in the plots. It is no wonder Yami No Matsuei [Descendants of Darkness] have an ever-growing cult following.  I can't reccomend it enough.",1060732800,22,1390,4.346153846153846
1885160,3,B00009MGF8,"Yami no Matsuei is possibly one of the top five anime I've seen, perhaps even up there with Evangelion.  However, after viewing a few of the NA version episodes purchased by a friend, I would have to suggest importing the pure, unadulterated, un-Americanized version straight from Japan.  There is just so much... editing, and cutting...  :: shudders ::  The ignorance of our culture... upsetting really.",1060300800,8,404,5.1692307692307695
1885190,5,B00009MGF8,"I have been told repeatedly about this particular anime and was finally introduced to it by a friend of mine. Unfortunately I was unable to watch it all so I decided to purchase it. The quality of the anime was outstanding and the characters were wonderful. I have been a fan of yaoi for a while now and this was just enough to tantilize the taste buds and make me want to purchase the manga. The only disappointment I had with it was there was a cliffhanger... I had been hoping for a completion. Oh well, I'm not going to complain about it. This was an amazing anime and I would recommend it to anyone.",1210550400,2,604,4.260869565217392
1885191,5,B00009MGF8,"DOD is an interesting 13- part series about shinigami.  Three of the four storylines have 3 parts each.  The fourth storyline has four parts. It is set in the modern world. With the Guardians of Death( this series' translation of Shinigami.) investigating vampires, mysterious deaths, and why dead people die but don't cross over into the next life.
  This is the only anime I have ever bought without seeing it on TV first.  It is one of three anime that I know about which deal with shinigami , Bleach and Death Note are the other two.  Each show presents a completely different  view of what shinigami look like and live like from the other two.  For example:

 Death note simply calls the shinigami  shinigami has done with it.
  Bleach in the subtitles translates shinigami as Death God, in voice over they are called Soul Reapers.
  Descendants of Darkness calls them Guardians of Darkness.
  All three are enjoyable to watch, even if nothing more than seeing the differences between how each set of writers and artists handle the same basic concept.

  One point:  If you have a problem with homosexual or yaoli elements in a story concept.  Skip this one.",1202601600,2,1163,4.738693467336684
1885192,5,B00009MGF8,Wish the series was longer. It is just long enough to get real attached to the characters in my opinion. It is a great Anime.,1176249600,3,125,4.04
1885193,5,B00009MGF8,"Descendants of Darkness (Yami no Matsuei) is one of those rare Animes you can't help but fall in love with after the first episode. I watched four of the episodes in Japanese on the internet, and then decided to buy it from amazon.

The plot is divided into four parts: Vampire's Lure, Devil's Song, Tarot Curse and Demons Reckon. The different plots for each part are clever, and there's always some sort of twist. To accompany the plot is the character development with Tsuzuki Asato and Hisoka Kurosaki, making Descendants of Darkness well-balanced.

The animation is consistently brilliant, and the Japanese voice actors suit the character very well. Tsuzuki's voice actor, Dan Green, does a great job, and I find Hisoka's voice actor more amusing then anything else, what with his constant monotoned voice. I do like Muraki's voice as well, and I believe the dubbers did an all-around good job, unlike most dubs.

I feel that this show is a mixture of slash and minor shounen-ai. I do not believe the main love relationship is between Tsuzuki and Muraki. That relationship is more one-sided, and Muraki's form of love for Tsuzuki is a bit twisted. Personally, I prefer the love between Tsuzuki and Hisoka, but  that relationship can also be taken as a strong bond of friendship. All I really know is that I get extremely happy over the Tsuzuki and Hisoka scenes in the last two episodes, muahaha.

The ending to the show was one of the kinds that could be continued, but it leaves the viewers satisfied nevertheless. This is definitely one of my favourite Animes of all time, and I strongly recommend others to watch it, because I don't really see flaws in it.

Well, I suppose the only disappointment I suffered from was the fact it ended so soon. But, I still love it.",1169769600,8,1775,4.728155339805825
1885194,5,B00009MGF8,"I LOVE this collection!

The imagery, music, characters, artwork and story development are all magnificent!

It's silly at times and more serious at others. You'll find drama, comedy, sci-fi, horror, mystery, romance and many of the most popular anime traits in the series.

The entire story has a very supernatural feel to it, bringing up some deep psycological questions and mysteries at times, yet allowing the viewer to draw a few of their own conclusions.

It's one of my all-time favorite anime series.

Very imaginative!",1153267200,5,527,5.152941176470589
1885195,4,B00009MGF8,"...this is NOT shonen ai anime, despite the deluge of reviews that hail it as such. For anyone new to the genre who has comes across this title, ""shonen ai"" literally translates to ""boy love,"" and the plotlines in those stories generally follows the basic formula of a romance novel, with the developing romance between the two male characters being the most important aspect of the story. In Japan, about 90% of these stories, or higher, are sold to women and they are written for women.

 What this story DOES have is an intense homoerotic pull between the protagonist, Tsuzuki, and the antagonist, Muraki. Love between these two characters is no-where to be found, however, which is why I don't classify it as ""shonen ai."" If it's a shonen ai anime that you're looking for, I suggest you start with titles such as ""Gravitation,"" or ""Fake."" Both are well known in the genre and are good places to start.

 Other reviews pretty much cover the story, so I'll recap as shortly as possible. Tsuzuki is a ""Guardian of Death,"" his job is to guide the lost and wandering souls who haven't paseed on into the world of the dead, so they don't muck up the world of the living. In other words, he's a detective on a sort of supernatural police task force, and the four story arcs reflect this. After seventy years of pounding the pavement and going through work partners like Kleenex, he is teamed at the beginning of the anime with a sixteen year old boy who has just died, called Hisoka. Both Tsuzuki and Hisoka have their own tragic pasts, and as they solve their investigations they bond with each other forming a deep and abiding friendship along the lines of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, for those who know their Star Trek.

 ""Wait!"" I hear the shonen ai fans cry! ""We'll give you that there's really no love lost between Tsuzuki and Muraki, but what about Hisoka and Tsuzuki?"" If you choose to see homosexual context in every relationship between male characters in any and every story, (Star Trek and Harry Potter being two fandoms that come to mind...), then you may convince yourself that you see a homosexual relationship between Hisoka and Tsuzuki. I don't see it, myself. I see two men who are the most important thing in the world to each other, I see a friendship that is as close as the bond between brothers, but I don't see any ""evidence"" that they're in love. However, I suggest you watch it yourself and use your own judgement.

 The DVDs themselves were just fine. I ordered mine used, simply because I refuse to pay almost $90 for a four episode anime. The first two discs' menus are slightly confusing as they're laid out in a pentagram formation, but it's nothing that's too difficult to figure out. If you're on this site, you're already looking at the version licensed in America, and from someone who DID see the fansubs, the translations are pretty much as I remember them, if a little clearer. I recommend watching both the dub AND the original Japanese with subtitles. The dub, for the most part is excellent. My only complaint with it is the voice of Muraki, who sounds like Bert from Sesame Street has gone to the Dark Side. Fans who are used to the fansubs may find Hisoka's voice a little disconcerting to listen to at first (the American editors realize that by the age of sixteen a boy's voice has broken), as it is voiced by a  young man rather than the rich contralto of the woman who originally voiced the character. Tsuzuki's voice is just as good in English as in the original Japanese and is a pleasure to listen to, as are most of the characters. In fact, some of the charcters are actually better in English, such as Princess Tsubaki.

 In other words, if you're a fan of anime, I would recommend this title, although I wouldn't recommend it for someone completely new to anime. The arwork is beautiful, and you can see the artists beginning to experiment with computer animation is some of the shots. The dub and sub are very good and the content has survived the censorship filter, (I didn't think the relationship between Muraki and Tsuzuki would survive intact). Shonen ai fans will enjoy it and insist that various characters are in love with each other, while those who are not shonen ai fans will enjoy the casefiles and the action (which there is plenty of), as well as the character development.",1147564800,19,4334,4.601036269430052
1885196,5,B00009MGF8,"descendants  of darkness is one of my favorites i really liked it (WATCH IT IN JAPANESE WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES) the colours are waaaaaaaaaaaaw its not an action movie nether a love story its kind of using powers and spells to call monsters or Gods (i loved it its unique) its a story of a guardians of death guiding the lost souls that wander the mortal world ( dead detective tsuzuki, his partner (or lover? not sure)hisoka and other detectives against Dr.muraki and his plans . tsuzuki and hisoka are dead not alive and the reason of their death is mysteriuos to make long story short, i will sammuries the anime volumes

1885197,4,B00009MGF8,"I love Descendants of Darkness, its my obsession. I even have the 9 manga released by Viz so far. I originally had 10 of of the 13 episodes on my comp, Japanese + sub. It was amazing, I loved it. But the quality of the video was not very good at all so I had to run out and buy the DVD boxset so I would be able to watch them in full quality, dubbed and have the special features. Naturally I would give this 5 out of 5 stars but there was something that really bugged me....

I was expecting at least a HALF decent dubbing job judging from the reviews I read... that was a mistake. The dub is HORRENDOUS!!!! ITS HORRIBLE!!!! I was absolutely shocked, and couldn't help but laugh at it in hysterical horror and dread. I was disappointed beyond all comprehension. I even tried sitting through a couple episodes just to see if it'd grow onto me. It didnt, it just got more and more horrifying.

Tsuzuki's voice... his was okay but I still think they could have done a better job. Hisoka...didn't sound like a 16 old in the least... sounded more like a perverted and creepy 40 yr old interent child molester. Muraki... instead of having the deep melodic voice like I was expecting (and had in subbed) he had the voice of a really creepy mad scientist from one of those old black and white movies... the kind thats bald, short, has thick glasses, is like 3 ft tall and has a shakey hand and veigns all over its cranium. Gushoshin didn't have the high pitched, annoyingly cute voice....he was like... a low-pitched black guy... the kinds that with no hair, wear suits and black shades and let people in and out of exclusive clubs..... yes, that kind of voice. And the most horrible of them all was Watari.... the wierd British accent thing was NOT working for him... 10% of them time he sounded really gay... and the other 90% he sounded like Stewie from Family Guy!!!!!!!!! DID ANYONE ELSE NOTICE THAT?!?! WHYYYYYY!?!!?! And not the mention the part in the 1st episdoe when Tsuzuki and Hisoka were in the little bar, Hisoka yells ""I am like soo out of here!"". I wanted to cry at that part, it was awful..

So, in conclusion, Stick with the subbed version, you will be much much happier, the voices for it are exactly how they were meant to be. Oh yeah, and go out and buy the manga too, they're friggin amazing.",1137888000,5,2307,4.372960372960373
1885198,4,B00009MGF8,"This anime is very compelling. The characters just suck you right into the story. Also, the premise is just fun. I mean, who can resist the paperwork and bureaucracy of the afterlife? Tsuzuki and Hisoka are more or less in the investigative/enforcement division of the bureaucracy, so they get to see all the best and worst in people. Vampires, demons, and magic combine to keep everyone on their toes. There are some dark moments, and it can be a bit bloody, but the strong bond between the characters makes it all worthwhile. It's quite slashable too.",1132531200,9,553,4.770833333333333
1885199,5,B00009MGF8,"Yami No Matsuei is a really good anime, but... the English voices just killed me! Halfway through the first episode I decided to watch in its original Japanese, which is much better. But I'm a fan of subs in the first place, so perhaps my opinion is less valid?
People tend to argue about if this should be considered shounen-ai or not. You could certainly argue it either way. But I think most people would agree that YnM is at least slightly shounen-ai. That being said, I think that both shounen-ai fans and those who aren't fans should be able to like this anime! ^_^

1885200,5,B00009MGF8,"Descendants of Darkness is an anime series with shounen-ai (boys' love) elements that is very enjoyable to watch.  It is absorbing and beautifully animated.  Japanese animation is known for its meticulous, artistic details and this one is no exception, from the fiery Suzaku to the mists of Kyoto. The characters are strong and believable: Tatsumi, Watari, Tsuzuki, Hisoka, Muraki, each distinctly different, all beautifully drawn.  Even the villain Muraki is so elegant that it's not possible to completely hate him.

This anime is for mature adult, with plenty of blood and an underlying sexual theme.  Yet the sexual content is what charges the show; without which it would be just a regular detective story with a rather mediocre fare (vampire, possessed violin, tarot cards, serial murders, nothing new here).  The supernatural angle is impressive, but this, also, is not unique.  What makes us glued to the show is what happens between Tsuzuki and Muraki: the tension between the hero and the villain is not one of antagonism but sexual attraction. Muraki's obsession with Tsuzuki is overpowering, and one wonders if Tsuzuki is truly repulsed by it.  When Muraki won a night with Tsuzuki in a poker game, Tsuzuki could have left, he didn't have to keep his promise to a villain.  But Tsuzuki was submissive.  Is he a man who always keeps his end of the bargain, or did he in fact want it?  He seems to always make himself close enough for Muraki to grab and embrace him.

Even so, there is no sexually explicit scene involving Muraki and Tsuzuki. Near kisses, the suggestive caressing of a wine glass, light necking, none which can be considered offensive. Muraki's advances are not vulgar, in spite of his sinister nature, he is a romantic.  It's a credit to the animators that the shounen-ai is presented in scenes that do not turn people off, yet brimming with passion and sensuality.  It's hard not to be moved by the scene where Muraki held Hisoka in his arms while a romantic song played in the background (end of episode 2). Or the kiss in episode 12.

The relationship between Tsuzuki and Hisoka is less complex, but just as intense.  Personally, I don't think the affection they share is more than love between older and younger brothers.  But it is true love, the kind that thinks of the other before oneself.  In the first story, Tsuzuki jumped in the line of a dragon blast in order to protect Hisoka, and in the last, which realistically depicts how one falls into depression, Tsuzuki was saved only because Hisoka was willing to risk everything to save him.

Perhaps the reason the show is so appealing is because it focuses on human emotions; a reflection of our own fears and desires (including fear of the after life).  It draws us in, causing us to ignore the oddities (like the count and the gushoshins) and the plot holes.  Still, the stories move well, and the morbid premise is balanced with a lot of humor -- although I fail to see the need to turn Tsuzuki into a dog for comic relief.  Going back and forth between such a silly childish caricature to an exquisite man with the power to summon the shikigami is simply ridiculous.

The dubbing is for the most part quite good, Dan Green did a wonderful job as Tsuzuki.  The same can't be said of Eric Stuart, his dreadful (British?) accent gives Watari a stereotypically gay voice, a far cry from the delightful Kansai dialect by Seki Toshihiko.  I also like Muraki's voice better in the original Japanese.  There's a certain elegance and detachment in it that is missing in the English version.  But gushoshin is infinitely more tolerable in English with a male voice.  Music is okay, some great BGM like the devil's trill but in some places it's too loud and cacophonous. And the closing song is truly awful.

The only real disappointment, however, is that the series only consists of 13 episodes.  Many questions remain unanswered --  I would love to know more of Muraki's past (like the story with his right eye and how he acquired his power) and of Tsuzuki's.  I'd also like to see more of Tatsumi, the serious sweet secretary of the ministry who likes to wipe out those he doesn't like.  Even Muraki seems afraid of him.  But Muraki is still alive and the manga continues, I'm sure more anime episodes will be made in the future.",1109808000,49,4313,4.714285714285714
1885201,5,B00009MGF8,"This series is definately a keeper. Shoujo anime is populated with pretty boys and ditzy females, but in this shoujo anime, the males take centre stage (if not the whole stage) as a group of young men who have died and been employed as the new gods of death.

The main character is Tsusuki, who is a polite nice-guy with a sweet tooth. He's also tall dark and handsome, attracting the implied interests of his moody partner-in-all-things-supernatural, Hisoka. They work alongside the frusrtated Ministry treasurer Tatsumi, enthusiastic scientist Watari and his equally enthusiastic pet owl 003. And considering their *difficult* circumstances, these guys handle the whole ""dead"" thing surprisingly well as they battle the VERY sadistic Dr Muraki, possesed musical instruments, doberman demons from Hell and a rather unpleasant ghost ship.

Most fangirls are attracted to Yami no Matsuei because its a very sexually charged anime. Yet despite that, there are no certain romantic relationships, just a few near kisses and some sexual situations that are nomrally played for comedy, along with implied rape of a minor (which was a disturbing, but not explicit scene). What may turn a few people off is that this is ALL between the guys. But if you're buying the box-set you'd know that!

While the abundance of beautiful men, angels, devils and buckets of blood indicates this anime is clearly directed at a female audience, open-minded guys who are into horror and the occult will find this series is a worthy addition to their anime collection.

But a warning to parents, despite being animated this series is certainly not for kids, people die is grisly ways with sometimes exaggerated amounts of blood, this coupled with the heavily implied rape scene, slightly homosexual themes and a few occurances of male fanservice make this anime strictly for older teens and up. But those who do watch it will certainly not regret it.

Advantages - Beautiful animation

  - Absorbing plot and likeable characters

Disadvantages - Some people will find the homosexual themes a

  turn off

  - The dubbed english track is grossly overacted",1104883200,14,2129,5.11271676300578
1885202,3,B00009MGF8,"I had read up quite a bit on Yami no Matsuei (Descendants of Darkness) before I saw this series. I was pretty psyched about it when I started watching it and I instantly fell in love with Tsuzuki. However, this series ultimately proved too dark and violent for my liking so I stopped watching it mid-series. If you're into constant bloodshed and really odd plot twists (as in ""Wow, I didn't see that coming"" and also, ""?!... That was weird..."") then I would suggest giving this a try. Certainly not for the faint of heart.",1104537600,5,522,4.505263157894737
1885203,5,B00009MGF8,"I started liking Anime when I was about 7 years old and I watched unedited versions. I watched numerous other anime and read some manga. Then it kind of faded for a while, so I always felt like something was missing.

I started watching Inu Yasha, a series that I fell in love with right away, and one day I was on the Internet looking stuff up about it. I got on this site that talked about main characters in stories with a dark side. I read the site and there, I encountered Muraki's profile. I read it and I stopped and read it again, finding myself entranced. I thought to myself *this is not a typical villan*.
Anyway, after that I looked up more stuff about Yami no Matsuei, and the more I looked, the more I became obsessed with it and I decided that I had to buy it NOW.

It was about $ 100, so when I walked out of the store, I had some doubts whether I spent my money in vain or not. I decided to watch the first part (vampire's lure).
I listened to the begining song and was so mesmerized that I had to re-play it again. Pretty soon I learned the words to it, cause it was stuck in my mind, and it was all that I could think about.

The anime is BEAUTIFUL! The colors and shapes and the backgrounds and lights are simply breathtaking. Tsuzuki, the happy-go-lucky shinigami gets a new moody partner, HIsoka, who is so adorable that it makes you just want to gobble him up. They all have a dark past of course, and their personalities couldn't be more different, but they are perfect for eachother.

There is some homosexual overtones, but it's not explicit or overbearing in any way. As for Muraki, he is just the sick villian, and to him it does not matter that Hisoka is a boy or a girl, he rapes Hisoka just cause he finds him beautiful - like a doll, and also to punish him for what he saw. He pursues Tsuzuki cause he needs him for a greater purpose, which I will not reveal for those who don't know it yet. Muraki enjoys making Tsuzuki uncomforatble, so he makes as many comments to him as it takes to make him feel that way. But he is not TOO insistant. I think that if he really wanted, he could have had his way with Tsuzuki like he had with Hisoka, but he only seems interested in groping Tsuzuki.  ( maybe he is afraid of Tsuzuki's power if he did)

There is a strong relationship between HIsoka and Tsuzuki, but you could easily argue that it's more brotherly than anything else. Or fatherly. They get close as time passes, but they don't even kiss or anything, so I think that it could be overlooked.  If I made the story (yeah, I wish!), I would have made Tsuzuki and HIsoka lovers and out in the open. They make the cutest pairing ever. You could still pretend.

Actually, In Devil's Trill, the realtionship between Tsuzuki and Hijiri ( who is identical to HIsoka) seems more romantic. Hijiri is a lot more open and loving and he hughs Tsuzuki and tells him that he loves him. (that is in the manga; in the anime he just says ""I like you"")
Also, in the manga HIsoka seems really jealous if you ask me. You don't really see that in the anime.

In the thrid part, I HATED Tsubaki. I detest her, cause it seems like she is getting in the way of Hisoka and Tsuzuki's relationship ( even though that love realtionship probably does not exist). I know it sounds terrible, but I was glad what happened to her happened. I cannot stand her.

The fourth part is the most dramatic cause we are nearing the conclusion. Muraki sets out to find Tsuzuki, ""the one he loves"", Muraki calls him. Well, when Muraki loves somehting he takes his time in destroying it, as the case of HIsoka. There is a lot of action in this one and you finally get to find out more about Tsuzuki's past, though it's a bit confusing at first. I'm still waiting for the manga on that.

Yami no Matsuei is an amazing series, my favorite of all time, and I think that the [$$] I spent on it was cheap considering the entertainemnt I got out of it. The only regret that I have is that they edited so much, cause I know that they did.  I didn't see the original one, but I will see it eventually when I will be able to get the Japanese version. I don't know where though. Sadly, it seems that I will wait a long time for it, but I am sure that the wait will be worth it.",1099958400,8,4253,4.192166462668299
1885204,5,B00009MGF8,"Wow, another great bishonen/shonen-ai series that ended too soon! The Angst, Love, & Darkness all starts in episode 1, and it doesn't let up. The darkness and melodrama is well-balanced by some nice everyday comic tropes and lighter characters. You can watch many of these episodes as crime-drama stories on their own, without worrying about the overarching story line... But soon you will definitely be sucked in & addicted by the interpersonal relationships and tangled vendettas, which is the mark of a truly good shojo anime.
You've already got the gist of the story, which runs like a gothic buddy-cop tale: The afterlife has its own version of the FBI (which in turn has its own version of Internal Affairs), and some particular soul-collectors are Agents of Death. Agent Tsuzuki is a somewhat ditzy long-dead beauty with a reputation of being difficult to work with. His new partner, Hisoka, is a tormented dewy-eyed teenaged babydoll, who was murdered at 16 and has had a hard time connecting with people ever since. Work-related hijinks ensue as the relationship develops.
Oh, now, don't get too squicked by the rumors of ""gay kissing!"" and ""boy love!""... It's fairly tame, but for the occasional kiss and the VERY suggestive fondling of one wine-glass. I think it could've been a lot more intense, but mainstream audiences are squeamish. The whole sexual-subtext dance is carried off delicately, but retains a whiff of kinkiness. A flashback to the rape of a young boy is done out in romance colors, lingering body-silhouettes, and falling flower-petals; Muraki wins a night with Tsuzuki in a poker game, and Tsuzuki is on the verge of surrendering himself when his teenaged sidekick shows up to rescue him. We surely never got anything that good on ""The X-Files"". But it's nothing that could offend.
I liked watching both the English dub and the subtitles. Both have managed to avoid stilted English and too many glaring errors. The voice-acting is mostly fantastic in both languages, too,  with the right mix of tears and giggles. American TV fans will recognize half the voices behind Yu-Gi-Oh! and Pokemon-- so you know that the actors are well-practiced with summoning monsters and giving long, grave speeches about the bonds of friendship.
Having the whole series in one box is definitely the way to go, unless you have your own reason for collecting everything epearately. There were some confusing new elements/characters introduced too near the end without satisfying resolution, and of course you want another series because Muraki is obviously still alive (in that way that very very evil villains have of repeatedly surviving certain death). But it's not so unsatisfying that you feel like you sat through 13 episodes for nothing. The art is lovely, and the explosions are particularly good. You get great monsters, excellent scenery & concept, fearsome powers, the mysteries of Death, a frisson of homoerotic innuendo, beautiful young heroes, excellent villains, and a pair of owl twins who work in the library archives. Can't go wrong for your money.",1082937600,162,3074,5.087128712871287
1885205,5,B00009MGF8,"Oh, I absolutely love this anime more than I ever could love any other! ^_^  This series was on such a level of it's own that I was amazed.  There's a kind of Yaoi overhaze, but I'll get to that in a minute.
 It starts out with Tsuzuki, an employee of a company called the Ministry of Hades, that is supposed to go and solve mysteries that cannot be explained by the Chinese government.  Mysteries such as those concerning ghosts and vampires and such.  He is a really ditzy character that has a huge sweet tooth, and frequently turns into a dog (you know, how girls like turn into cats in animes with the ears and tail? Well, he does it with a golden retriever's ears and tail, and it's soooo cute!! ^_^)  Anyway, he is assigned a partner because all employees of the Ministry of Hades must work in pairs for protection.  His partner is Hisoka, a very serious blonde with a very difficult and shadowed past.  Hisoka is an empath, and he is sensitive to his surroundings, such as sensing your energy and being able to see where you are in his mind's eye.
 They are in charge of looking after Nagasaki, and at first, are not getting off to a good start because Hiskoa has a very hard time trusting Tsuzuki.  Then, we enter the villian; the insane Dr. Muraki.  He is a creepy guy who dresses in all white and has pale skin and platinum blonde hair.  And Hisoka hates him because besides the fact that he's a serial killer, he is the one who killed Hisoka under a mysterious circumstance (which is why he didn't cross over), but also, because he raped Hisoka before he killed him (which you see a breif scene of, but it's only a few seconds long, and there's nothing shown; you just get the idea of what's going on).  Muraki is obsessed with Tsuzki, because of some elements from his past, that I won't give away for you, because it would suck if I did.
 Anyway, they (Tsuzuki and Hisoka) become fast partners after Muraki kidnaps Hisoka and holds him somewhere, bound by twisted strands of women's hair (o. O I told you he was insane...) and Tsuzuki has to save him.  There are alot of implied MalexMale pairings, so it's not the anime for a homophobe, but if you're open minded, it's really cute I think.  Especially Hisoka and Tsuzuki... ^_~  Anyway, it's like I said, an amazing series that I actually bought completely on a whim, and I'm so glad I did.  There are alot of confusing and different parts until you get to the ending, where it all makes sense, so you might have to watch it twice to really grasp everything, but haey; I've owned it for a few weeks, and I've watched it over ten times (I kid you not... ^^;; ).  It's a very gothy anime, and some parts are very dark and confusing and creepy, but mixed with the light hearted humor, it is essentially one of the best shounen-ai animes out there! ^_^!! I highly recommend adding this to any devoted collector's set!! ^_^!!",1081641600,20,2884,4.387218045112782
1885206,5,B00009MGF8,"When I bought this, I was expecting something amazing.
When I watched it, I was amazed. Yami no Matsuei is awesome, to say the very least. The characters are cool, sexy and quite three-dimensional, and the English dubbing isn't that bad. My only complaint about the anime was that the background music sometimes really sucked.
There is yaoi/shounen-ai in this anime, and a rather brief flash of a rape scene. (Like, 2 seconds, when Dr. Muraki raped Hisoka.)
I reccomend you stick to the Japanese dub if you want it authentic all the way, but, as I said, the English dub was very well done.",1078531200,6,589,4.619047619047619

7991642,5,B00009MGF8,"I watched Descendants of Darkness on Sci Fi channel and really liked it.  This series was a whole new kind of anime.  I liked it so much I went and bought all 11 volumes of the manga.  This anime is not for everyone as it is not action oriented as so much of today's anime is.  Dr. Muraki is one of the best villians I've ever come acoss and the voice characterizations are excellent especially for Tsuzuki, Hisoka, and Muraki.  I highly recommend it, however, due to morality standards the series can only hint at forbidden things.  Read the manga for the full effect.",1232323200,3,569,4.423076923076923
