2361772,5,B000A59POM,"Hard to get enough of the team from Midsomer. Excellent episodes, always entertaining, and just a bit randy!",1163030400,4,108,5.055555555555555
2361773,5,B000A59POM,"""What evil lurks beyond the well-trimmed hedges of Midsomer?"" asks the DVD jacket. That's the underlying tension, isn't it? All these well-dressed people, beautiful houses and countryside, drinking endless cups of tea--YET--evil still lurks there. And, there is such a competent duo to sort it out in Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and Seargant Troy.

Cozy enough, framed with the harmonious domestic life Barnaby shares with his wife Joyce. Yet, four out of five of these episodes feature multiple murders, not just one. The advantage of this, in mystery terms, as in chess, is that you can detect a pattern and it keeps the story going and more intricate. Each episode is 100 minutes, almost like a complete movie...such extraordinary generosity.

2361774,5,B000A59POM,"As with all the Midsummer Murders before, they still keep the audience guessing till the last minute. As I have been to the areas where the series was filmed, I know how believable the towns and people are. This makes the series a real pleasure to watch.",1130284800,24,254,4.425531914893617
2361775,5,B000A59POM,"What I find so amazing about this series, is the ability of the production crew and actors to maintain the high quality of the plots and acting. These mysteries are mysterious. They have grown more violent over the years, and several of these episodes are downright heart-breakingly sad, but entertaining nevertheless.

Shot all over England, the locales are to die for, and the actors introduced in each episode are familiar faces we've seen before. Isn't that woman playing the jaded wife the same actress who played Sebastian Flyte's youngest sister?  And, wasn't she the mother of a murdered child in 'Second Sight'? And, isn't that Harry Kumar's lost love? My husband and I play the guessing game with each new entry.

As has been the case with the earlier episodes, each mystery is tied to an historical conflict (a device Agatha Chrisie used successfully), or an uncomfortable truth, such as the birth of an illegitamate child whose identity has not previously been revealed. The plots are deconstructed so you cannot always determine who is/are the culprit(s) before the detectives do so. And,(shades of Ngaio Marsh) the stories almost always have an art angle featuring Jane Wymark (Mrs Barnaby) or daughter Cully who seems to have formed an attachment to Barnaby's sidekick (the chemistry is good).

I recommend this series for Anglophiles and Barnaby fans.",1129161600,75,1367,5.089285714285714

2361861,3,B000A59POM,"This is definitely an enjoyable series with great writing and good performances. However, I'd like to point out a few things on the down side; 1- the murders are extremely grizzly with lots of blood and mutilated corpses at every episode, which is in sharp contrast to the supposedly peaceful villages where they occurred. 2 - The motives that caused the villagers to murder are very trivial and petty most of the time. 3 - The murderers are the most unlikely people; people who have lived clean and decent lives in a nice peaceful village suddenly go berserk for some petty reason and start butchering their neighbors.
So obviously the writers achieve their goal - it's just about impossible to guess who done it, but it made me feel let down in the end of every episode.
Anyway, like I said - it is an enjoyable show never the less, just take off your thinking cap and enjoy the blood fest...",1324080000,,894,4.559006211180124

I absolutely love this series!  I can't get enough John Nettles as Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby!.  The way he puts together all of the events of the crimes and solves them sometimes just boggle my mind. And all of this without the use of guns and car chases which is all we see on our US tv shows.

2361945,5,B000A59POM,"Not long ago I became addicted to a weekly mystery show called Midsomer Murders. It was set in a quaint English village that anyone living in the city  would love to visit, of course once stations built a following they dropped the show.
So since then I have been buying the show's seasons a few at a time. The stories are intriguing with witty dialoge and interesting story lines. John Nettles leads us through clue after clue while trying to keep his private life sailing smoothly. Nettles as Inspector Barnaby and his brash young assistant Sargeant Dan Scott work tirelessly through the clues to discover who the culprit is, along the way there is comic happenings with the dry English dialogue that will have you smiling to laughing out loud.
So take a trip to the villages of Midsomer County and enjoy every twist and turn as the story unfolds. I promise you the residents will leave a lasting impression on you. Enjoy.",1230336000,,924,4.668711656441718

2361949,5,B000A59POM,"One needs to employ the ""willful suspension of disbelief"" before viewing these wonderful programs, but well worth your trouble. I can't imagine murder being so popular in these beautiful English hamlets, as to render them barren and lifeless in just a few years. John Nettles plays Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby, assigned to investigate each and every one of Midsomer County's seemingly endless murders. Barnaby is played as an ""everyman"" detective. Nothing flashy. Suit and tie, quiet and respectful in his demeanor, and has a very normal family life (wife and daughter) waiting for him at home each day. The fact that each episode is 100 minutes or more is crucial. It takes that long for each story to unfold properly. Each episode includes some of Great Britain's finest character actors and new ""up and comers"" who have since made it big. Honore Blackman and Orlando Bloom come to mind. Some even make it into more than one episode as different characters.  In addition, the location shooting in some of England's most gorgeous villages make the locations themselves an important reason to watch. The quaint village pubs and thatched roofs make one want to live there, if it weren't for those murderous townfolk.",1205280000,,1225,5.0344827586206895

2361951,5,B000A59POM,"If British Detective stories are to your liking, the Midsomer Murder Mysteries will completely captivate your attention and your pleasure.

Set in the most English of English countrysides, Detective Chief  Inspector Tom Barnaby (played, admirably, by John Nettles) solves the most devious of crimes with intuition, common sense, luck - and humour. Occasionally, a bright suggestion from his Sergeant leads to the solution and, if this happens, Barnaby is the first to admit it.

Barnaby's Sergeant, his 'side-kick', plays an integral part in every story. In the beginning Detective Sergeant Troy, played by Daniel Casey, was Tom Barnaby's 'bag carrier' but, later, Detective Sergeant Dan Scott (played by John Hopkins) took over the role.  Both these men were admirable in the part - although each had an individual slant to it.

Barnaby's devoted and supportive wife, and his intelligent daughter, both play a role in the series' - to advantage. Without intruding, they manage to instill a realism to the story which is pleasing.

If British Detection stories are your 'thing', this magnificent series' is for you. You will NOT be disappointed. You have my word for it!",1194480000,3,1170,5.196808510638298
2361952,5,B000A59POM,"I purchased this collection in its entirety after realizing how wonderful it was.  Now I wait impatiently for new seasons to appear in DVD format!  The characters are wonderful and original:  for one thing they aren't as dysfunctional as those of other murder mysteries seem to be.  Furthermore the cases are often delightful and ingenious.

Inspector Barnaby (John Nettles) and his wife and daughter are delightful individuals.  I enjoy spending time with them and catching up with what they're doing.  The characters are well balanced people with personal issues, but they deal with the ups and downs of their lives rationally and cooperatively.

When I saw the first film, I was afraid that Joyce would be a forgotten wife.  Barnaby was called away in the middle of a lunch date with her, and I thought, ""oh good grief; now we'll have marriage issues!""  Not so; she was upset but philosophical about his departure, in short obviously used to it as part of being married to a policeman who is as devoted to his work as Barnaby is.  Later in the series she tells another character that at their wedding instead of saying ""I do,"" the inspector said ""I've got it"" and dashed out of the church to solve a case.  Here too she repeats the tale wistfully, not angrily.

The young Collie, their daughter, has evolved from an attractive add-on character whose main purpose seemed to be to give this couple a ""history,"" into a wonderful personality of her own; she compliments her parents and has a life that is wonderfully integrated into the story and sometimes into the mystery.  She is a nice blend of the characteristics of her parents and looks so like Joyce that they could easily be mother and daughter.  In short, she fits perfectly, and the three characters make a believable family.

I enjoyed the young inspector (Daniel Casey) Gavin Troy very much.  He has a freshness, youthful enthusiasm, naivety that is a perfect foil for the more mature, proven, and more realistic Barnaby. By this set, however, it seemed as though he was less respectful of his mentor and a bit irritable.  I suspect this was intended to reflect his growing self confidence and need to progress ""up the ladder,""--as well as the need for the actor himself to work out of the series and into one of his own, so I was informed--but he was less fun as an ""up-and-coming"" rather than as a naive newbie.

The mysteries themselves are terrific.  I don't know much about the writers doing the work except that they have some of the most inventive minds doing TV stuff I've seen in ages.  While not all the plots are entirely believable--at least once you've given it some thought--they are entirely wonderful.  For one thing, the victims and suspects are frequently very eccentric.  Certainly their propensity and motives for murder are impressive.  One imagines a Merrie Olde England and villages filled with truly crazy people; and not icky crazy either, fun crazy.  By the time one of the stories is completed, the body count is amazing, and the viewer is left to wonder if there is anyone left alive in Midsommer!  What makes the thing especially wonderful is that the inspector notices this fact himself--both the eccentricities and the murders--and occasionally remarks upon it.  I suspect he wonders what his living and working in the area says about him.  (I remember thinking that some of the individuals I worked with in Saudi Arabia were pretty ""peculiar;"" then I realized since I was there too, the fact might say something about me also!)

All of these delightful personalities are portrayed by many of the same actors.  One might see the Midsommer series as actually more of a repertoire company performing at a theater like the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis.  These actors are some of the most skilled I've seen in ages.  They manage to create a separate, unique and believable personality for each of their characters.  While familiar faces are easily spotted in the series, one is never mistaken over the individuality of the character that the actor is portraying; he or she IS that person, no matter who they were in earlier episodes.  Truly impressive and very professional.  I've actually become a fan of some of them and enjoy watching the styles they cultivate in different episodes.

A very enjoyable series.",1175212800,19,4303,4.830601092896175
