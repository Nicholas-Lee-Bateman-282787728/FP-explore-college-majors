1908475,5,B0000AOV8O,"Noted Sherlock Holmes Scholar, Andrew Kemp, was not kidding when he said that these are the best reproductions of these films since their original theatrical release. Digitally restored in 35MM from the UCLA Film Archives prints, they are a joy to behold for those of us who have had to make do with ratty and incomplete public domain copies. MPI has again done Holmes fans a great service by making this fine and popular film series available once more. I say ""again,"" because they have also released the much respected Granada TV series featuring Jeremy Brett.
Previous reviewers have already commented on how Universal moved Holmes ahead into the WWII era, and had him chasing down Nazi's, spys, and assorted modern ""evil-doers."" Never-the-less, the series appeal lies not in the historical context, but in the charisma of Rathbone and Bruce as the series' Holmes and Watson.
These films are not great cinematic milestones, but they are great fun - pure entertainment, and as each new generation discovers Holmes, they always key in on this series as the all-time favorite. If you haven't seen these films before, or even if it's been awhile since you saw them on TV as a kid, do yourself a favor and pick this set up - you won't regret it.",1067731200,34,1243,4.786046511627907
1908476,5,B0000AOV8O,"I just finished watching the movies in this collection, and over all I am very pleased.  The restoration was very well done.  The picture is clear and sharp, and the sound is excellent, especially when you compare it to the other Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes DVDs that were previously available.  There is not much to say about the extras, as there is not much in the way of extras.  The first three movies are of the ultra patriotic Holmes V.S. the Nazi variety, and those have never been my favorites.  The last film in this collection is much better, and while it is set in ""modern times"" (That is to say 1942) the war is in the background and it's the mystery and detective work that is on display.  While all the movies are not my favorites I do like all of the series and I am very pleased that these sets are finally being released, as it brings back memories of the Saturday afternoon movie matinees on the local independent station from when I was a kid.  If you are a fan of the Basil Rathbone\Nigel Bruce films this is a must buy for you.",1067558400,5,1051,4.331632653061225
1908477,5,B0000AOV8O,"In 1942 Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce - the definitive Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson - stepped out of Victorian England to battle the Nazis in Universal's ""Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror.""  Three years prior the duo of Rathbone and Bruce had collaborated in what are generally regarded as the finest film adaptations of the legendary Sherlock Holmes adventures, Fox Studio's ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" and ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.""  The former, in particular, brilliantly captures the mood, mystery, and magic that has made the great detective such a compelling figure.  Rathbone was perfect.  Tall, with angular features and a unique singular intensity, Rathbone looked perfect carping through the fog draped Moor clutching a lantern in a deerskin cap and cloak.  Nigel Bruce, too, was at his best here, conjuring up the loyal, gentlemanly, though intellectually ordinary compatriot, Dr. Watson.  The chemistry between the stars was evident, and the two made 14 feature films as Holmes and Watson in addition to more than 240 radio episodes and stage productions.
 The 12 films that make up the Universal series never achieved the same critical acclaim as the Fox classics - though the Scarlet Claw is certainly a worthy entry - but the films have nevertheless achieved a certain cult status thanks to the impeccable performance of Rathbone as Holmes, the undeniable chemistry between Bruce and Rathbone, and the otherworldly gothic atmosphere Director Roy Hill creates.  The rather obvious use of low-budget rear screen projection in some scenes, stock footage, and relatively short running times of these films give them an unmistakable B flavor.  And yet the memorable turns by veteran characters acors - perennial heavies like George Zucco, Lionell Atwell, and Henry Daniel - stylish direction, and atmospheric settings still stir the imagination.  The film have, however, been long out of print, or available only in second rate DVD or VHS versions.  MPI has remedied that with this restoration series.
 Several years ago Key Video set the standard with the release of the entire Holmes series on VHS.  Now MPI exceeds that high standard by a notch.  The restoration, culled from the surviving 35mm prints and portions from second and third generation duplicates - is sharp, vivid, with great contrast and clear sound.  The original Universal titles have been restored, as has the war bond tag that accompanied the films during their original theatrical runs.  Though a few flaws remain this is probably the best anyone could have hoped for with these films given their age and the condition of the surviving film elements.
 The DVD extras included with this set are satisfying but not as generous as one might have hoped for.  The sixteen page booklet included with the set is the best of the Bonus Material featuring well-written commentary and production notes on each of the individual films.  The text includes interesting background on the films, its stars, snippets from reviews, and personal reminiscences.  Also included is an account of the restoration process.  The remaining Bonus material is included only on the ""Sherlock Holmes Faces Death"" disk.  Author Davis Stuart Davies' commentary is informed, edifying, though he sheds little light on the principles, Rathbone and Bruce.  A short video montage of Sherlock Holmes posters and stills rounds out the extras.  Considering that MPI's packaging boasts ""Loaded with DVD extras"" the actual amount of Bonus material is a bit of a letdown.  MPI has yet to release the next two volumes in their set, so perhaps there is still time to remedy this issue by including biographies, filmographies, trailers, and other DVD goodies.  As it stands this set deserves a solid Five Stars.  Video and sound quality is everything one could want, the DVD extras leave one hoping for more.",1067558400,14,3868,5.157051282051282
1908478,5,B0000AOV8O,"You must realize that these 14 films represent the most successful ""B"" film series ever made, and running as they did at the same time 240 radio shows ran every Monday night at 8:30, mostly for Petri wines from California, it's really long over due that someone of the stature of ULCA would restore them and bring them ""home"" to America
Being a Basil and Bruce purest, I was terribly upset when Jeremy Brett received all the acolades for his impersonal portrayal of the great detective....Brett had the one missing ingredient that Basil didn't have....the original mysteries as written by the Master......instead he was subjected to Hollywierd rewrites and screen plays that could never hold a candle to Doyle.....
That aside, now the world will once again understand why Basil and Bruce's images are still the quintessential images of the Dr. and his friend, and once again America will get to see the ultimate performace of the the Great detective in immacualte form: restored 35mmm on DVD......

1908482,5,B0000AOV8O,"I would sit up nights when Sherlock Holmes was on. For me, Basil Rathbone was Sherlock. While others used the settings Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was familiar with, this was updated to the 1940's and Holmes dealt with Nazis, and home grown terrorists and spy intrigue as well as the usual skullduggery he was known for. His enemies were familiar though. Col. Sebastian Moran and Professor Moriarty made frequent appearances among others who were equally nefarious, but not quite so clever, and there was always a certain tongue in cheek dark humor through it all, thanks to Nigel Bruce who played the bumbling but ever faithful Dr, Watson, who sometimes stumbled upon the very clue Holmes was looking for. For some this may be a bit dated now, but it's nice to pop in a DVD for these old classics, to sit back and enjoy the chase when ""The Game is afoot!""",1366675200,2,851,4.605263157894737

1908486,5,B0000AOV8O,"Four moody, entertaining, often funny, and- at about 65 minutes each- quite efficient little ""Sherlock Holmes"" thrillers.  This set includes the first four Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce ""Holmes"" thrillers produced at Universal, which follow two initial Rathbone/Bruce entries at Fox, ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" and ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"".  Though featuring the same leads, Universal shifted the time period of these thrillers from the Victorian age featured in the first two films to the World War II era, often using the war as a dramatic component, with varying degrees of success, of the stories at hand.  Here's a quick look at the four movies in this set:

Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror:  Perfectly watchable, but too much wartime business for my tastes, as well as way too much stock footage of bombs dropping, factories burning, and the like.  By no means a horrible story, but it just didn't have very much to do with Sherlock Holmes and the types of cases and challenges fans want to see Holmes confront.

Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon:  A little more enjoyable than the above film, though still too war-oriented.  It helps that there isn't as much wartime stock footage, and that we get to see Holmes square off against arch-nemesis Professor Moriarity.

Sherlock Holmes in Washington: A clever cat-and-mouse plot, a MacGuffin- a matchbook containing a concealed microfilm- right out of Hitchcock, and a high level of detail to challenge and entertain attentive viewers make this one the first real winner of the set.  Happily, like the matchbook, the wartime threat is basically a MacGuffin, too, namely just an excuse to move the action forward.

Sherlock Holmes Faces Death:  A dark manor house, a succession of violent deaths reminiscent of Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"", eccentric suspects, mysterious clues, and a living chess game orchestrated by Holmes- reminding me of a similar one at the end of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone""- easily make this one the best of this particular bunch.  Most appreciated: the film reminds viewers of the Axis threat (in the form of several convalescing officers under the care of Dr. Watson), but doesn't let the wartime era dilute the first story of the set that actually looks and feels like a genuine Sherlock Holmes story.  Great stuff.

All four movies are wonderfully restored by the film folks at UCLA, and one film- ""Sherlock Holmes Faces Death""- has a terrific commentary track by a Holmes enthusiast and film scholar (but only when you buy the film as part of this set).  ""The Sherlock Holmes Collection, Volume 1"" is wonderful fun for both thriller fans and for Sherlock Holmes fans in particular.  I've had these sets for a while, and am now working my way through them for the third or fourth time.",1248912000,3,2802,4.989247311827957

There have been many actors cast in the roles of Homes and Watson, but Rathbone and Bruce are by far the best.  These films are all updated to the 40's, when Britain was at war with Hitler, but they still are very intertaining.  ""The Voice of Terror,"" ""The Secret Weapon,"" and ""Holmes in Washington"" all are concerned with Nazi spies and the war, and were obviously made as a moral booster for the wartime audiences.

1908495,4,B0000AOV8O,"I have a real affection for these Sherlock Holmes films.  I'm a fan of Sherlock Holmes in general, but I think this pairing of Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce is my favorite screen combination.  Yes, I realize that such offerings may horrify the average Holmes scholar, but I can't help my tastes.  What they lose in deviation from the original source, they more than make up for in style.

The first thing to be mentioned is how clear the picture and sound are on these restorations.  Films of this age can be hit or miss when released on DVD, but these prints are in remarkably good shape.

I'll now quickly offer an opinion on each of the four movies.  Note that these are the first four films in the series.  When Universal bought the rights to Holmes, they decided to update the great detective.  They not only brought him to the then-current time, they also decided that he should face what was the greatest threat of the day.  So, for the first three movies, Holmes is aiding the Allies during WWII, a setting that he seems (at least to me) to fit into comfortably.

SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE VOICE OF TERROR is the first ""spy catcher"" that Holmes is involved in.  It works.  However, it attempts to be a triumph of style over substance and that's fine until one starts looking at the plot too closely.  Still, it's a fiendishly stylish production with the fine lighting and careful choreography that would be a hallmark of the series.

SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE SECRET WEAPON is based upon Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's ""The Adventure of the Dancing Men"" and the code-breaking aspect of the original fits very comfortably into the WWII setting.  This was one of my favorites as a child and I am happy to see that its just as much fun now.

SHERLOCK HOLMES IN WASHINGTON features Holmes and Watson being driven around back-projected images of Washington, DC stock footage.  Notable more for Watson's attempts at going native than for actual plot.  It's fun if nothing else.

SHERLOCK HOLMES FACES DEATH is the first one which places Holmes and Watson back into their familiar roles of detectives rather than spy-catchers.  I enjoyed the first three movies, but it's nice to get back to basics.  The story and its resolution are rather clever.

The front of the DVD case proclaims that it is ""Loaded with DVD extras"", which is stretching the definition of ""loaded"" quite a bit.  Photo galleries don't really confer ""must-own"" status, and the only additional DVD extra is a commentary track which is only available on one of the four movies.  ""Loaded""?  That's a bit strong.

That said, the commentary track for SHERLOCK HOLMES FACES DEATH is really excellent.  Given by David Stuart Davies (according to the cover, a renowned British author), this offers a lot of trivial insight and critical observation.  Realizing perhaps that listeners would not be viewing this commentary in isolation, Davies also makes comments particular to other films in this same box set.  He offers a lot of comparisons between the original stories/characters and how they ended up being presented on film.  He goes into a lot of detail concerning the history of this film series, as well as pointing out the actors who had appeared in others of this series.  I found this a hugely enjoyable and informative commentary.  (Beware that the commentary track does contain spoilers, so make sure you watch the films first.)

I'm very happy that these films have finally been cleaned up and released on DVD.  I'm also thrilled to see that I can enjoy them as an adult as much as I did as a child.  I'm definitely confident enough to order the next two box sets.",1099785600,45,3629,4.713831478537361
1908496,3,B0000AOV8O,"Voice of Terror is the only one I have seen so far. It was almost a joy to see this fine war-time piece. However, when the voice and lip movements are out of sync one must ask how this was allowed to happen. Not only is it a distraction in full shots, but the close ups are truly disconcerting. At fifteen dollars a disc, I certainly want more professional results. Also when my package arrived there was rattling in the box. It turned out that all of the discs were loose in their container. I ordered vols two and three at the same time and the discs in their boxes were also free to move about, making the possibility of scratches and bumps to happen. The packaging of these classics is appalling. If the sync problem exists in all the discs then the ""experts"" that put these together fall far short of their responsibilities. The fact that it should happen even once to these classic movies is bad enough. Enough! Amazon Books has always been top notch, but I fear the DVD department is far below what one expects. The clarity and sound is very good. Now if they could just get it together.",1083974400,11,1094,4.367647058823529

Highly recommend this set",1074211200,4,354,4.546875
1908500,4,B0000AOV8O,"The first three films in Universal's Sherlock Holmes series find the great detective battling Nazi spies and other contemporary (for 1942) villains, a reflection of the studio's belief that Conan Doyle's master sleuth, as conceived by his creator, was an anachronism in the horrific early days of World War II. Despite the success of the initial outings, the fourth film, ""Sherlock Holmes Faces Death,"" deemphasized the modern aspects of the films and returned the focus to more traditional mysteries, perhaps because the studio realized that audiences turned to Holmes for an escape from Hitler and his atrocities, rather than reminders.
Though Conan Doyle purists tend to sneer at them, the first three films are very entertaining. Despite the fact that the game was now afoot in an era quite unlike the Victorian age in which Holmes and Watson were most at home, a dark, foggy atmosphere was maintained in all but ""Sherlock Holmes In Washington.""  Basil Rathbone, despite a bizarre hairstyle that might have been leftover from his role in ""The Last Days of Pompeii,"" puts an indelible stamp on Holmes that no other actor has been able to erase. Nigel Bruce's Dr. Watson may be a tad too bumbling for such an educated man, but in later entries he would show himself to be more than a buffoon.
The fourth film is the best in this set, and ""Sherlock Holmes Faces Death"" sets the pattern for the eight to follow. Holmes continued to eschew his famous deerstalker (was amusingly admonished by Watson when reaching for it in ""Voice of Terror"") and smoked cigarettes more often than his traditional pipe, but the weird gladiator hairdo was, thankfully, gone. And though he continued to close many of the cases with an insiring patriotic message from Winston Churchill, these and other reminders of the world outside the darkened theater were downplayed rather than awkwardly stressed as they were in the initial trio of films. The second and third volumes are the best, but this collection is worth owning, too.",1073001600,5,2007,4.955489614243324

I thought I would never see anything to compare to the Key videos, but this is as good or better.  There have been some really bad DVD Sherlock Holmes copies out there recently.
The quality of the film print on these DVDs is outstanding and a joy to watch, and to me that is the whole important point to a DVD, not the extra features, etc., although fun I guess to have.

1908502,5,B0000AOV8O,"After 20th Century Fox produced ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" and ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"", they abandoned their Holmes film series. Picking up where Fox left off, Universal brought back Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Holmes and Watson, while at the same time placing them in wartime London. Although this may have seemed a bit weird, the then-modern setting for the characters is handled with enough intelligence to almost make it work.
The set could easily have been called ""The Wartime Collection,"" as the fist three films in the set touch on espionage and Nazi plots, while the fourth concerns a convalescent home for returning soldiers. Holmes was one of the few exports Britain had that could affect American sentiment on World War II. By shifting the story to the current crisis, Holmes (and by association, the war effort), became relevant for a whole new audience and in a whole new way.
""Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror"" is a stunning exercise in cinematography. The first entry in the Universal series has a noir-ish lighting scheme that adds to the crackling suspense of wartime intrigue.
The much maligned ""Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon"", long abused as public domain fodder, has never looked better.
""Sherlock Holmes in Washington"", another film long-condemned by followers of the canon, is a surprisingly good mystery with Hitchcockian overtones.
""Sherlock Holmes Faces Death"" lifts the plot of ""The Musgrave Ritual"" for incorporation into a new mystery, which is effectively gothic and atmospheric.
Excellent support is offered by a myriad of bad guys, each chilling in their own way (Lionel Atwill is excellent as the evil Moriarty in ""Secret Weapon""). The sets are a wonderful mixture of Victorian and WWII London, which is effective most of the time (one surprising anachronism is the ""VR"" in bullet holes in the Baker Street flat). All four films end with Holmes offering a coda on the war and/or mankind.
After screening the four films, it becomes apparent that the condemnation Rathbone and Bruce suffer at the hands of hard-core Sherlockians is not entirely deserved. While Jeremy Brett is perhaps the most accurate portrayal of the famous detective (and Hardwicke and Burke of Watson), Rathbone is definitive as Sherlock in an entirely different, and still entertaining way.
Nigel Bruce, long despised by Serlockians for his portrayal of Watson as a bumbling buffoon, nevertheless offers us a lovable and warm-spirited version of Holmes' friend and companion. Much of the criticism leveled at Bruce is, I think, rather unfair in the final analysis. Always seen as competent when medical duties are needed, and always on hand to save Sherlock's bacon when required, a little absent-mindedness and comic capers by the character are easily forgiven (if not outright enjoyed).
Although the back of the box proclaims the set to be chock full of extras, that isn't exactly true. The extras on the set are limited to a short booklet with very good, comprehensive production notes, some audio commentaries, and a two-minute montage of posters and stills.
UCLA has done right by these films with stellar restorations. A must-have for any fan of Rathbone's Holmes.",1069977600,20,3210,5.127862595419847

Overall, these are the clearest and sharpest versions I have seen in my lifetime.
In comparison to some of the non Key Video versions that were out on VHS these offerings from MPI are stunning.
My only letdown was, as others have mentioned, is that there could have easily been more additional material offered.
A short commentary was offered on the restoration of Orson Welles' ""The Third Man"" by Criterion and was fascinating.
Something similar to this would have been easy to produce and Holmes fans like myself who have put up with public domain trash copies for decades would have eaten up such a documentary.
I also have wondered for years if there are any out-takes from the films that still exist.
How fascinating that would have been, and would still be....hint....hint.
At the very least, Filmographies of Rathbone and Bruce, or trivia facts about the series or the actors, or the productions, or at least even the trailers should have been included.
Little things, such as pointing out the appearance of a young dark handsome Milburn Stone in ""Faces Death"" who later became ""Doc"" on Gunsmoke.
There are several instances where the Captioning is lazy. Such as in ""Faces Death"" when Holmes says ""anno Domini"" in a sentance and the caption writer just put ""Domino.""
Even with occassional lapses in the captioning, it was indeed nice to have them captioned.
Of all the films in this Volume, the one I found most curious was ""Faces Death.""
Even after reading the liner notes, I still wonder why some of the extreme deterioration marks on individual frames could not have been repaired by computer.
Much worse deterioration existed on the ""Third Man"" and it was restored flawlessley. And oddly, there are a few sections of the Key Video version of this Film that are clearer than this MPI restored version.....?....
Was this a real case of Wet vs. Dry printing or laziness on the part of those in the restoration process?
All that said, the other three films are near pristine, especially Holmes in ""Washington"". I think there will never be another version of these prints released that will surpass the quality of this offering.
Lastly, for the snobby Holmesian purest who nearly worship the Brett/Granada versions of the Holmes stories, I think this offering will go a long way in explaining to many why Rathbone is beyond doubt the nearset thing to Holmes incarnate that has or ever will exist.
The Granda versions are draining, dripping with overcharachterization and forced melodrama...did I mention contrived?
Brett often behaves like a nerotic narcasisstic snot who sees and loves his own image off a distance in a mirror somewhere.
These films with Rathbone and Bruce are timelessly engaging, underplayed, entertaining, perfectly moody and just downright fun in every aspect. Rathbone and Bruce had a chemistry that so completely complimented each other.
Rathbone especially....you never catch him playing Sherlock Holmes...he just ""is"" Sherlock Holmes.
Now, if we can just get the first two Rathbone and Bruce films restored and captioned and in our libraries....well what's next...Peace in the Mideast?",1069113600,3,3268,4.998165137614679
1908506,5,B0000AOV8O,"While I watched ""Faces Death"", I felt that it was a much lighter version than I what was used to. So, I paused a scene and went hunting for my Key Video of the movie. I put it on and went to the matching scene, then switched back and forth between the VCR and video images. The difference was very pronounced. The Key Video version was darker, moodier and had deeper shadows. I don't know which version should be considered the ""better"" one, but they are indeed quite different! I enjoyed the commentary and booklet, but, like others here, would have liked to see more (such as the trailers). Overall, though, I am thrilled to see the series on DVD and will buy the next two volumes.",1068595200,,683,4.3858267716535435

In the 1940's Hollywood produced fourteen movies that featured Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson. The first two, The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, were set in the late 19th century. The next twelve movies were set in modern times and supported the Allied war effort. The original film negatives on nitrate film deteriorated over time. There were copies on acetate film, but they also decayed over time. These current versions include the original full lengths and main and end titles. They were restored but some parts look and sound better than the others. For more details read the individual reviews for each movie. The best movies are based on the original stories.

Sherlock Holmes The Secret Weapon (1942) tells about the threat to a bombsight. Will enemy agents steal it? Holmes prevents this.
