7932772,5,B000056V6S,"For me the enduring interest of the Blair Witch franchise is its emphasis on the unreliability of narrators.  BWP itself contains several outright contradictions in the early interviews and in the characters' flawed recollections of them.  The Oni Press comic books feature tales based on legends that (as in real life) have too many variations to all be true.  Dark Testimony and Diary of Rustin Parr are accounts from men who may be suffering dementia, mixing fact with delusion.  But aside from ""The Offering"" perhaps, this short film best exemplifies the way people distort what they see and fool themselves into confidence, which of course is exactly what Josh, Heather, and Mike did.  And it's done with barely a word about the Witch legends and the foggy past.

All of Burkittsville 7 is about 20th century events, some filmed and most with living eyewitness testimony - and STILL confounded by the unconscious agendas of the speakers.  The writer, Ben Rock, has a lot of fun playing the cast off one another, especially in the argument over Transitis Fluvii, and Rock even gives Chris Carrazco's the smug certainty of a 9/11 Truther insisting that his interpretation of the chosen facts is the ONLY rational conclusion...while studiously avoiding any mention of how 1940s prosecutors might well prime their child witness with details of an abduction he couldn't have seen.

The more you poke at it, EVERYTHING in the Blair Witch mythos falls apart - not because the tales are shoddy but because they're supposed to collapse.  Blair Witch is truly the Anti X Files, showing exactly why the truth isn't out there without reliance on anything more conspiratorial than our natural tendency to bend memory to suit our temperament.  There's no unimpeachable evidence of anything supernatural, and yet no resounding condemnation of superstition as being worse than any other explanation.  I think this little video conveys that better than even the main film.  It's a pity so many of the knuckleheaded parodies are on DVD but this gem isn't.",1438387200,,2042,5.026706231454006
7932773,4,B000056V6S,"This tape is actually two seperate pieces that originally appeared on television: The Massacre of the Burkittsville Seven (Made for Showtime), and The Blair Witch Legacy (Made for The Sci-Fi Channel). Massacre explores the Rustin Parr killings, and is by far the better of the two features. It fits well with the documentary-like feel of the first Blair Witch movie, and provides some really chilling insights into the events of that movie. I think it would even be effective on it's own.  The Blair Witch Legacy doesn't stack up as well, playing more like what it really is: A long informercial for Book of Shadows. It, too, adds to the moviegoing experience, but since it originally aired before Book of Shadows was released, it tries too hard not to spoil the movie's surprises. Overall, it's a worthwhile viewing experience, especially Massacre. The conclusions drawn by that segment are truly unforgettable, and will change the way you look at The Blair Witch Project upon further viewing....",1036800000,5,997,5.042424242424242
7932774,4,B000056V6S,"Really excellently done. This two volume video contains material that fills in some of the plot holes in the other videos and books. Really a companion movie to go along with the books, this video was very well done in the same docu-drama style as the original movie companions and books.",1001376000,4,288,4.666666666666667
7932775,4,B000056V6S,"The Blair Witch Project (Haxan films, 1999), will go down in history as an independant film phenomenon, due to its incredible originality of style, an uncanny conservation of cinematic device and style, and an overwhelming hype that, in '99, was unmatched (for an independant), before or since. You'd have to be a true fan of Horror, and one of the quickly-growing coven of Blair Witch cultists, however, to have enjoyed the admittedly inferior sequel. Perhaps you're one of them; here are the present (most obvious) criteria: We begin at the same point, with Heather, Josh, and our little Mikey, hiking off into the woods; the end of Part I, as it were, should also be the end of our interest in witches from the Black Hills. Enter a now two-year-old ""mockumentary,"" Curse of the Blair Witch. No questions about the missing filmmakers of BWP are really answered, but very factual-looking notes, interviews, historical/mythical snippets, and more, make for a subject matter (albeit purely fictional) that makes this mythos all-too-real...much like the Amityville phenomenom of the 70's and 80's. The much-anticipated sequel, Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, pales in comparison to the original...unless the first TWO films (it would be a blatant misinterpretation for anyone who dismisses the validity of Curse of the Blair Witch) have drawn one this far; let me make it plain: if you even marginally enjoyed or found merit in the second theatrical film, it's undoubtedly because you've been HOOKED SINCE THE FIRST ""MOCKUMENTARY"". The Massacre of the Burkittsville 7 is not a must, by any means, but if you're a confirmed Blair Witch Hunter, this companion piece to BoS will further deepen and mystify your own Blair Witch experience, with new details concerning Jeff Patterson and the characters introduced in Blair Witch 2; and, just to start new question/debate, the introduction of Kyle Brody, the only child abducted by Rustin Parr in 1940/41 who lived to tell about it. As in Curse of the Blair Witch, this ""mockumentary"" will serve not to answer questions spurred by the film, but to bring to the table new dilemmas and incongruencies. Massacre of the Burkittsville 7 is just another piece in the growing puzzle that's making the Blair Witch Legacy, in the minds of devoted afficionados, the best premise for modern horror since Hitchcock's day. Pick it up, and continue the search yourself...if you dare.",988588800,8,2411,5.075566750629723
