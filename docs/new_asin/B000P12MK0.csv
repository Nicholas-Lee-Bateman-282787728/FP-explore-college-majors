The movie begins with marching soldiers and band music. General Walter Bedell Smith talks about soldiers, some perform beyond the call of duty. This is the story of Audie L. Murphy. At age 12 he was a good shot. His father deserted the family. Audie, the oldest son, worked to support the family and quit school. Then the war began. There is bad news: their mother went peacefully. The younger children must go to a church orphanage. Now Audie will join the military. The Marines, the Navy, and the Paratroopers reject him; the Army doesn't. Audie was acting sergeant on the ship coming over, he inspects the troops. There is rough humor among the troops. Murphy wants combat, he has spirit. He sent his pay back to his family. When the Germans surrender in Tunisia the Third Division is then sent to Sicily. They walk along a road until a German machine gun opens fire. It is neutralized. Sicily was taken in 38 days. Murphy was promoted to corporal.

Next they go to Italy. Corporal Murphy carries a Tommy gun. The bridges across the river were destroyed. Murphy's squad crosses the river at night for an attack. German 88s open up in the morning. The Army continues to advance. After two months they are sent back for a rest. Some soldiers start a fight in a bar. A joint operation? Murphy finds a home-cooked meal. They take part in Anzio, German 88s fire on the troops. They have to retake a tall farmhouse. The rain makes mud, this keeps German tanks away. They take the farmhouse. The artillery observer calls in the tank position so they are stopped and the road is blocked. The old soldiers don't make new friends. They must stop the repair of that damaged tank at night. Murphy is recommended for a decoration. They retreat from the tall farmhouse when enemy tanks advance. Armor and reinforcements allow them to advance. They reach Rome. Then they report for amphibious training. They will land is southern France next.

Murphy's friend Brandon was careless. Murphy knocks out three enemy machine gun nests! They are held back by an observation post. Sergeant Murphy is promoted to Second Lieutenant. They advance until they come under fire. They are near Colmar. It must be taken ""at all costs"" to open the road to Germany. German tanks advance against them so they retreat. Murphy stays to call in the enemy's position, the shells drive the tanks back but their infantry advances. Murphy climbs on to a burning tank to uses its machine gun against the advancing Germans. But he is wounded in the hip. This will disqualify him from West Point. [Murphy's wound did not receive prompt attention, gangrene set in so more damage resulted. Modern medical treatment would have prevented this.] In August 1945 Lt. Audie L. Murphy received the Congressional Medal of Honor and many other medals. He was the most decorated American soldier of WW II.

His book was more informative than this movie. After the war he acted in Hollywood movies, like some other veterans. This movie was the highest grossing movie until it was surpassed by ""Jaws"" in 1975. Movies are rated by the amount taken in, not the number of paid admissions. Given the rise of admission prices, this could be the most popular movie ever. There were other WW II movies made in the 1950s; their tone is different from the wartime movies of the 1940s. Note the commercial in the beginning, where a neighbor recommends joining the military and becoming a ""lifer"" because of the retirement benefits after twenty years.",1397088000,,3536,4.7353896103896105
