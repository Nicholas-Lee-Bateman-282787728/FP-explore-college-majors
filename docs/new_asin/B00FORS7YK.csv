6016524,5,B00FORS7YK,"Great dvd, all in french, repetitive, catchy songs, teaches about fruits, rooms in a house, how to like and not like things, counting..and not annoying to watch over and over again with my just turned 3year old.",1421107200,,211,4.72972972972973
6016525,5,B00FORS7YK,"One of the best methods I have used so far.  The narrator speaks at the appropriate pace for a beginner.
I also appreciate the pop-up words.  I have tried just listening to Children's cartoons, but they speak quickly as French is meant to be spoken to a trained ear.  BTW, it has been over 20 years since I studied French in High School. I watch this with my 6 year old son as he is just beginning to study the language in an after school program.",1418256000,6,447,4.174418604651163

We've bought  this on Amazon Instant Donwload, but liked it enough to later buy it from Whistlefritz for the car (CDs and DVDs in that set).  I just hope they make more French options, we would purchase them.",1415318400,,256,4.543478260869565

6016530,5,B00FORS7YK,"This is how french kids pick up french so if you don't speak it, this is so much better than sitting kids in front of dumb english language cartoons!",1401494400,4,149,4.172413793103448
6016531,5,B00FORS7YK,"We love the Whistlefritz audio CDs, but this is the first video we have purchased, and our first foray into French!  My kids (two girls, age 3 and 4) love this video, and so do I.  The production quality is excellent, the content is really smart and entertaining, and the actors and animation are truly engaging.  It is not easy to find well-done language media material for children, but this stuff is top-notch.  It has been playing in the minivan for weeks now, and we all still love it!",1400112000,8,490,4.47191011235955
6016532,5,B00FORS7YK,I love this DVD and so does my two year old daughter! She's learned so many French words from  watching it. She loves the songs and especially loves the little mouse Fritzy,1461456000,,172,4.375
6016533,5,B00FORS7YK,The children really enjoy dancing and singing to these songs and look forward to our French time together.,1456963200,,106,4.944444444444445
6016534,5,B00FORS7YK,The best French language serious we've found. I highly recommend the Cd's/MP3s kids are learning more from this than they did Little Pim and some her videos we've watched. I hope they produce more videos. I rented this beforeI bought it. Go ahead and buy it. You will not be sorry. I had 4 years of French in high school. Based on my understanding these are great. My five and 7 year old enjoy watching these. After watching for a few months they are starting to use French while they play and ask for their jus d'orange.,1450483200,,521,4.381443298969073

6016541,2,B00FORS7YK,"My kids just weren't interested in it. I have a 4 year old and a 1 1/2 year old.  My 4-year-old prefers to watch a series that is completely in French called ""SamSam"". My daughter likes the Little Pim series (which my son also watches). Not sure why but my kids just wouldn't watch this one for very long.",1428796800,2,305,4.169491525423729
8617487,5,B00FORS7YK,"unfortunately the second DVD, they sent, only plays on the computer and not on CDrom that usully plays everything: from Cds to Blue Rays.

8617489,4,B00FORS7YK,"I am writing a review comparing three language programs for very young children: Dino Lingo, Whistlefritz, and Little Pim.  I rented an episode from each of these programs from amazon to see which one was the best fit for me.

Dino Lingo was my least favorite (three stars), however, watching it regularly will still help toddlers and very young children pick up new words.  The production value of this one was the lowest; the dvds are  animation, but the animation is pretty low end and a bit corny.  Shots with people in them aren't very clear either, however, kids aren't going to care about that.  The program comes with six dvds that are about a half hour each.  The cartoons are very spazzy, fast paced, and odd.  I would recommend this set for little ones that watch more cartoons or television in general.  Not being judgmental here, but kids that are already exposed to other faster paced cartoons that are all over the place (like a ton of kids shows are) will pay attention to this better.  I personally feel this set is best for kids aged two to four, or maybe five.  Younger is probably best, because an older child is going to get sick of six half hour long dvds like this pretty dang quick.

Little Pim came in second place (four stars), but this is the intro to French that I am choosing for my just turned three year old daughter.  Little Pim is a mix of cartoons, and segments with real people.  It isn't as annoying as Dino Lingo, and the pace is slower.  The cartoon segments aren't as bizarre either.  Production quality is decent, and huge steps up from Dino Lingo, but don't expect gorgeous and elaborate animation as it is still fairly plain.  Little Pim comes with six dvds (same as Dino Lingo) that are about half an hour each. They are cute and engaging enough for the two to four (maybe five?) year old age bracket.  Again, I cant really picture six or seven year olds having any interest in watching these dvds, but I could be wrong.  Rent episodes off amazon before spending the one hundred dollars to find out.

Whistlefritz (only comes in Spanish and French, we are starting with French) is by far the best of the three.  It flows like a kids show with songs, and the episodes are centered on a woman with an animated mouse for a side kick teaching to a group of kids.  Looks nice, although I bet all parents will be sick of the songs before the first month is out, but this is the price we pay.

This collection comes with four dvds with about a half hour of program on each one.  It also comes with two cds that have all the songs on them, in case youd like to listen on an endless loop in the car for the rest of your life. Whistlefritz is ten dollars cheaper than Dino Lingo and Little Pim, but you end up with two less episodes to watch.  I personally would take two more episodes over the music cds.

I feel Whistlefritz would be suitable for slightly older children too, and not just toddlers, because the songs and style are slightly more engaging.

Also, don't expect your children to become fully fluent in French (or whatever language you choose) from watching these videos alone.  You will have to keep going with the language.  It is disappointing to me that none of these programs have additional levels geared towards elementary aged children.  I guess we have to jump right into Pimsleur (which is not connected to Little Pim in any way) or Rosetta Stone.

My three year old liked all three episodes I rented, so I have decided to start by purchasing Little Pim.  We don't do a lot of screen time in our house, so I imagine maybe three days a week I will have her watch a half hour episode.  I also plan on following up that half hour with an episode of Puffin Rock or Mouk with the language set to French (thank you, Netflix!).  There are many other cartoons on Netflix that can be played in other languages, so take advantage of screen time by using it as a language learning tool.

I intend to purchase the Whistlefritz program in the future, maybe six to twelve months down the road depending on whether or not my interest in having my daughter learn a second language early on wanes or not.  (My three year old also tinkers around with me peeping over my shoulder as I use Duolingo in French and also the 6,000 Words in French apps- I probably do these about half an hour a day.  She doesnt always pay attention, but Im sure its good hearing the language spoken anyway.)

Hope this helps!",1515456000,2,4442,4.41820418204182

8617496,5,B00FORS7YK,"This is a great DVD for ages 4-6 who are already being exposed to French.  Even though there is no English on the DVD, most kids will still pay attention to the action and follow along, as long a French-speaking adult coaches them a bit.  The DVD is best viewed in a group.  Single viewing by a kid by him/herself will probably not be very effective.  The DVD has about 12 ""episodes"" lasting a few minutes each so you can tailor the viewing to the kids' attention span.",1465084800,,469,4.295454545454546
