8317773,5,B001LAGDKY,"It is interesting how Ben Affleck portrays Jack Ryan against Harrison Ford's Jack Ryan in PATRIOT GAMES. Well, I guess one is the thinking man's armature and one is the seasoned man of action or a man who does not sit on the sidelines. I prefer Harrison Ford's Ryan because he is just more dynamic and that more interesting to watch. THE SUM OF ALL FEARS was somewhat a disappointment to me. I can forgo any complaints about the casting of the main character. The story is the culprit here or the truncation of the story near the finale. This is actually a very engrossing film until the final third. The film titillates the viewer tediously divulging events and characters constructing a complex framework of suspense, paranoia and intrigue that ultimately delivers a devastating situation to the world's two superpowers. It is amazing that the scriptwriter, the director or both did not know how to culminate all these events into a climax equal to the impressive filmmaking up to that point. Throughout this film the villains seemed to hold great power and influence and were in absolute control of events that they were manipulating. In the final third of the film the rug gets pulled out from under them and the rest of us. The escalation of the US/Soviet conflict almost seemed superficial and hurt the the film. However, Jerry Goldsmith's score seemed to pull out some thoughtful reflective reactions on the Soviet side during this phase of the film. In all, SUM OF ALL FEARS has a frightful scenario and the villains are not who you think. Interesting stuff. Also there were great performances from Liev Schreiber, Morgan Freeman, Michael Byrne and Philip Baker Hall. Goldsmith score for THE SUM OF ALL FEARS really is dynamic and advances the narrative. I like James Horner's score for PATRIOT GAMES. It is simply much more reflective and fits that story perfectly.",1380931200,,1874,4.859375

8317775,1,B001LAGDKY,"These are the worst picture quality of my 90 blu-ray movies. Some of the scenes are pretty good, but most of it is awful. 1 extra-a featurette on the movie. I'll bet they're coming out w/ a better version soon. Maybe a 4-pack jack ryan set like on regular dvd. They did this re-release thing w/ Terminator 2 already! All 4 of the Jack Ryan series looks like crap on blu. Is it better than dvd? Yes, so only buy it if it is a must-have for you.",1236902400,3,443,4.045454545454546
