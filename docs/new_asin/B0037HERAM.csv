4081362,4,B0037HERAM,"R-Truth and John Morrison vs the Miz and Big Show (Tag team Titles): R-Truth and Morrison never really got an offense going. When Morrison went for a move off the ropes, Big Show punched him and then pinned him.

  Cody Rhodes vs Ted D. vs Randy Orton: Rhodes and Ted double teamed Orton, until they started arguing about who would pin him. Orton destroyed both men in the end though, he kicked Cody in the head and gave Ted the RKO.

  10 Man Money in the Bank: This match didn't disappoint, there was a lot bumps and high flying. The best part was when Kofi Kingston used a broken ladder as stilts to try and get the briefcase. There were a few people in the match that I wanted to see win and Jack Swagger was one of them, so I was happy to see him win, even if it took him like 3 minutes to get the briefcase down lol.

  Sheamus vs Triple H: This was surprisingly one of the best matches of the night. Sheamus came to fight and to win and when he appeared to have the match won, HHH was playing possum and hit the Pedigree for the win.

  CM Punk vs Rey Mysterio: Punk went for the Go to Sleep a few times and Rey reversed it every time. The end came when Rey catapulted Punk's head into Luke Gallows' crotch and then gave Punk the 6:19.

  Mr. McMahon vs Bret Hart: Mr. McMahon made the match a Lumber Jack match with the Hart family as the Lumber Jacks and Bruce Hart as the ref. He actually thought they were in his pocket and before the match started, Bret assured Vince that they were on his side and not Vince's. All of the Hart's beat up Vince when ever he went out side the ring. While in the ring Bret just beat the hell out of Vince too and Vince had no offense. Bret even hit Vince with a chair a hundred times, which was more boring than it was brutal or entertaining. Bret then finally gave Vince the Sharpshooter for the win.

  After all the wait, it was a horrible match and sadly the worst of the night. But hey, at least Bret didn't lose because that just would have been stupid.

  Jericho vs Edge (World title): This was a good back and forth match, but Edge didn't win even though he won the Royal Rumble. Jericho won after hitting Edge with the title and then giving him the Code Breaker. Do I even have to tell you who won a World title at WM when he didn't even win the Royal Rumble ?

  10 Diva Tag: With help from Michelle McCool, Vicky Guerrero pinned Kelly Kelly with one of the weakest splashes off the top rope I've ever seen and after she hit it, Vicky could barely even figure out how to make a pin lol.

  Batista vs Cena (WWE World Title): Cena lost on Raw 2 weeks in a row before this match, so it was obvious he was gonna walk out of here as champ, since Cena barely ever loses. I don't know why the WWE chose to give Cena the belt this night over Edge. Edge put on a better match. All Cena does is let someone beat him up through most of a match, until he hits like 3 moves to win and this match was no different. Batista dominated the match until Cena hit his 3 main offensive moves including the 5 Knuckle Shuffle off the top, wow he introduced us to a new corny move. Cena won with the STF.

  HBK vs Undertaker: HBK hit Sweet Chin Music a few times in this match and each time looked as if it would take Undertaker's head off. It was the best Sweet Chin Music I ever seen. HBK almost won and even kicked out of the Tombstone but the end came when he slapped Undertaker and told him to Tombstone him again, Taker of course did to win the match.

  If anyone was gonna end the streak, it should have been Shawn. If I have to witness stupid Cena end Undertaker's streak, I think I probably wouldn't watch the WWE ever again.",1269820800,,3667,4.091036414565826
4081363,5,B0037HERAM,"They had a 26 man Battle Royal as a dark match featuring mostly every wrestler that was no featured on the card. I'm sure it'll be added as a dvd/blu-ray extra. Yoshi Tatsu wins the Battle Royal if anyone cares.

Show Miz VS R-Truth and John Morrison: A short opener that really never got off the ground. I would have rather seen a Miz-Bryan match but some matches were cut short due to time. Anyways, Show Miz retains.

Randy Orton VS Ted DiBiase VS Cody Rhodes: This was too make Orton a babyface. A decent match but nothing out of the ordinary with Orton winning in the end via anther awesome out of nowhere RKO.

Money in the Bank featuring Kofi Kingston, Shelton Benjamin, Drew McIntyre, Matt Hardy, Dolph Ziggler, Kane, Jack Swagger, Christian, Evan Bourne and MVP: A typical match with many good spots. Everybody assumed McIntyre or Christain would win but Swagger emerges as the victor. I'm glad as Swagger is a good talent that WWE has been wasting up until now.

Sheamus VS Triple H: I assumed he'd win just to solidify himself as a top heel in the company. However, Triple H wins in a uneventful bout and the burial of Sheamus probably starts now.

Rey Mysterio VS CM Punk: They were only given 6 minutes to wrestle but they gave it there all with Mysterio wins in the end. I hope they keep this feud going because i'm sure these two will put on better matches with more time.

Bret Hart VS Vince McMahon: Given everything Hart has gone thru in the past ten years, I didn't expect too much from this match. They got the Hart Family as heel lumberjacks and Bruce Hart was the guest ref. Watching Bret recently I knew this match would not be the best ever. I'm highly surprise Jim Neidhart didn't make an appearance but it was nice to see DH Smith and Tyson Kidd finally get some air time. Hopefully they'll be pushed better because they are two highly skilled wrestlers. Anyways, Bret does very little with Vince getting a wicked beating and then tapping out to the sharpshooter.

Chris Jericho VS Edge: Just like any other WWE fan you ask, I thought Edge would win the world title. However, Jericho retains in a very good match and probably the best match up to this point.

Maryse, Vickie Guerrero, Layla, Alicia Fox, Michelle McCool VS Beth Phoenix,Mickie James, Kelly Kelly, Gail Kim, Eve Torres: Stupid match.

John Cena VS Batista for the WWE title: Just like Hogan before him, Cena wins the title back on the biggest stage of them all. This was a very good match as well. Both wrestlers hit there finishers but they kick out of the moves. The ending was pretty good as Batista went for a Batista bomb but Cena escaped and locked him into an STF for the submission win.

Undertaker VS Shawn Michaels: Awesome match, maybe better then last years match. I loved the part when Michaels superkicked Taker on the table and then hit a moonsault thru the table. The ending saw Taker pin Michaels via tombstone piledriver and his streak stays alive. They hug after the match and they have a huge fireworks display to end the show. I don't know what Michaels future plans are but I hate seeing him go and I hope he doesnt end up in anther company.

Overall, a good WrestleMania. The Undercard didn't really deliver and the Hart-McMahon match was what I expected it too be. The two title matches were very well done but the diva's match sucked. Undertaker-HBK will probably be anther match of the year contender. A must see.",1269820800,3,3430,4.525040387722132
4081364,4,B0037HERAM,"My review of Wrestlemania 26:

ShowMiz vs R-Truth and John Morisson: 2.5 stars.

Nice and entertaining while it lasted, but needed to be at least 6-7 minutes long.

Legacy triple threat match: 3.0 Stars.

Best when Orton was on offence honestly. Orton is so good it's not even funny though. Loved the turnbuckle pose with RKO graphics :)

Money in the bank: 3.0 stars.

A tiny bit better than last years, Jack Swagger winning was a bit of a surprise but I hope they show him some respect now as Mr. Money in the bank. Some fun spots and entertaining match. But I expected more from Drew?

Sheamus vs HHH: 3.0 stars.

A little better than I thought, a physsical match two strong bulls. Sheamus could have bennefitted from a win but, the guy is being pushed to the heavens regardless.

CM Punk vs Rey Mysterio: 3.0 stars.

Had this match been 5 minutes longer, a potential 4 star match. Great moves and a lot of high impact.

Bret vs Vince: 1.5 stars.

Weird and awkward, very anticlimatic. Sadly.

Edge vs Y2J: 3.25 stars.

Very good but not quite great. Loved the first Codebreaker counter by Y2J. Jericho may have gotten hurt for real by the crazy spear after the match!

Divas match: 1.25 stars.

""Hog Splash!"" LOL that was epic. But it was decent for divas action. Everybody hit their moves which was nice to see.

Batista vs Cena: 3.5 stars.

Cena and Batista at their best, with a few mini botches, including a headache causing ddt to Cena by Dave. Ouch. But the match was very good and the crowd was very cool!

Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels: 4.5 stars.

This match is beyond terms like epic and classic. Taker's entrance was perfect and I loved the outfit so much. The match lived up to the hype and obviously had a great buildup. The match was just wonderfully executed, and it told a great story. I would have liked to see HBK selling 3 tombstones a little more after the match, but hey I understand that he was emotional, and he deserved a proud walk out from WM with his head high instead of limping and holding his neck.

This was a 7.5 show for me overall. It had only few bad things going on, and alot of the things on here were at least pretty good",1269820800,2,2162,4.381909547738694
4081365,5,B0037HERAM,"Great Wrestlemania.

Match #1:
Unified tag team titles:
ShoMiz (c) vs Morrison and R-Truth

Match Thoughts: Good opening match, was a little short and what I expected to happen. Very few tags (I think once per team) but still a good match. 3 out of 5

Match #2:
Legacy triple threat
Ted Dibiase vs Randy Orton vs Cody Rhodes

Match thoughts: Like the first match, was very predictable but a pretty good match. 3.5 out of 5

Match #3:
Money in the bank ladder match
MVP vs Kofi Kingston vs Drew McEntyre vs Jack Swagger vs Kane vs Evan Bourne vs Dolth Zoggler vs Matt Hardy vs Shelton Benjamin vs Christian

Match Thoughts: Another great MITB. It was bit confusing with 10 men in the match, sometimes a wreslter wouldnt be shown until they get hurt and/or doing attacks on the ladder. Alot of great spots like Bourne doing the 450 on the middle part of the ladder. Overall 4.5 of 5

Match #4:
Triple H vs Sheamus

Match thoughts: This was actually a very good match that should have been more in the later card then just missing the half way mark. Sheamus really looked good in the match because of HHH as the match went back and forth. 4 out of 5.

Match #5:
If Mysterio loses he must join the straight Edge society
CM Punk w. Luke Gallows and Saritta vs Rey Mysterio

Match thoughts: Another solid good match. It was predictable, The Straight Edge Society got involved a couple of times with Mysterio coming back and winning. 3.5 out of 5

Match #6:
No Holds Bared Lumberjack match featuring members of the Hart family.
Bret Hart vs Vince McMahon with Bruce Hart as special guest referee

Match thoughts: This wasn't a match between two men. This was a 1 sided match. Vince thought he could screw Bret by paying the Hart family (Bruce, Smith, Diane, Tyson, David Hart, Natayla, etc) to be lumberjacks and ref to screw Bret. But Bret made them work for him. All that happened was the Harts attacking Vince (mostly not done by Bret) and some shots with a crowbar and winning with the sharpshooter. 3 out of 5 (got a good rating because Bret returned to the ring and got revenge)

Match #7:
World title:
Chris Jericho (c) vs Edge

Match thoughts: Very good match between 2 of wwe's best wrestlers. It went back and forth. With Jericho countering the spear a few times and him trying to nail it. I had no idea who was going to win as both men did whatever it took to win. . 4.5 out of 5.

Match #8:
Vickie Guerrero, Michelle McCool, Layla, Marayse and Alicia Fox vs Kelly Kelly, Mickie James, Beth Pheonix, Eve and Gail Kim

Match Thoughts: Was the worst match of the night...almost as bad as last year's Miss Wrestlemania battle royal (which to me would have gotten a 0 out of 5). There were only 2 or 3 tags, a few hits here and there and then every diva hitting their finisher. 1 out of 5

Match #9:
WWE title:
Batista (c) vs John Cena

Match thoughts: I knew this was going to be a great match. This two were at their best last night as it went back and forth. I almost thought Swagger would cash his newly won MITB briefcase either before, during or after the match but he didnt. This two truely had an epic match. Not one of the best wwe title matches at WM but still epic. 4.5 out of 5

Main Event:
Streak vs career match
Undertaker (17-0) vs Shwn Michaels

Match Thoughts: This match can be summed up in 3 words that the fans chanted throughout the match ""This is Awesome"". This was actually better then last year's match. There were great spots like when Michaels did a moonsault off of the turnbuckle to Taker through the announce table. Every move was done and either countered or kicked out. 5 out of 5

PPV thoughts: Great ppv, with the exception of the divas match and maybe the Bret/Vince match. Every match was exciting to watch and very unpredictable (with 2 exceptions). Michaels/Taker 2 was a classic.

I know I gave 1 match a perfect score but the ppv was just that great, the combination of the matches made it great. If the divas match wasn't there, it might have gotten a perfect score.",1269820800,2,4006,4.377867746288799
4081366,4,B0037HERAM,"WrestleMania 26 came from Phoenix, AZ from the University of Phoenix stadium. This even features new stars coming to the front, long time stars defending their turf, a 12 year rivarly finally (we hope!) coming to ahead, the return of a star in his bid to reclaim championship gold, a man looking to exercise a ""demon"" that he has never beat and a legendary career Vs. an undefeated streak! This was WrestleMania 26. Let's get to it!

John Morrison & R-Truth Vs. Showmiz (The Big Show/The Miz)(WWE Unified World Tag Team Championship Match) - This opener was okay but nothing to write home about. Morrison and R-Truth did well with the Miz but once TBS got involved, it was all she wrote! This match was kept relatively short for an opener (barely over 5 minutes/the entrances were longer than the match) but it served its purpose and that was to put over Showmiz as a real team. They take this one and retain their titles!

Randy Orton Vs. Ted Dibiase Vs. Cody Rhodes (Triple Threat Match) - This is mostly a glorified handicap match as the two former members of Legacy (Dibiase/Rhodes) looked to destroy their former mentor and leader in ""The Viper"" Randy Orton. Match starts out slow but picks up when Cody and Ted begin fighting over who was going to beat Randy. This works to Randy's advantage as he slowly begins to take over the match! Surprise by the way, THERE IS BLOOD IN THIS AS DIBIASE GETS CUT OPEN AND IT ISN'T SEALED RIGHT AWAY! AWESOME!

Anyway, Orton takes the win after he lays out Cody with his punt kick and then nails DiBiase with his RKO finisher!

Kofi Kingston Vs. Jack Swagger Vs. MVP Vs. Evan Bourne Vs. Shelton Benjammin VS. Matt Hardy Vs. Dolph Ziggler Vs. Drew Mcentyre Vs. Kane Vs. Christian (Money In The Bank Ladder Match) - You know how this match goes, the first man to climb a ladder and get a briefcase will have a guaranteed contract for a world title match within one year. This was organized mayhem as bumps and brusies were taken all over the place. Surprisingly, the highlights didn't belong to Shelton this year but to Evan Bourne and Kofi Kingston as Bourne did his shooting star press off the ladder onto Christian and Kofi almost got to the briefcase using a broken ladder as stilts! LOL!

Anyway, it ends with a surprise winner in Jack Swagger as now he had the briefcase to use at anytime of his choosing! Good MITB match (though I still think 10 is too many, it should be no more than 6).

""The Game"" Triple H Vs. Sheamus - In a surprisingly good bout, ""The Cerebral Assassin"" took on the ""Celtic Warrior"" in a good contest that saw Sheamus actually dominate most of the match and almost win it. In the end, HHH used his experience to lull Sheamus into The Pedigree for a pinfall win.

C.M. Punk Vs. Rey Mysterio (If Rey loses, he must join The Straight-Edge Society) - If you've ever seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Armageddon-2008/dp/B001H5X6PS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE: Armageddon 2008</a>, these two had a sleeper match on that card (that was the night Jeff Hardy won his first world title), so you know these two can go with each other. The drama prior to the match only added to it. Ends when interference from Luke Gallows backfires and allows Rey to pick up the victory. Personally, I thought their Armageddon bout was better BUT this one was pretty good.

Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart Vs. Mr. McMahon (No Holds Barred Match) - Don't expect the Bret of old here. This was just a ""feel good"" filler. It begins with Vince McMahon seemingly have bought off The Hart Family to turn on Bret! He brings them down as lumberjacks. Bret, however, turns the tables and reveals that they took the money as part of HIS plan to lure McMahon into this match! So, basically, it was McMahon who was outnumbered!

The match itself won't go down as a classic but rather a bookend to a 12 year story (at least I hope). At least we got to see Bret one more time and his signature move ""the sharpshooter."" Enjoy it for what it is.

Chris Jericho Vs. Edge (World Heavyweight Title Match) - This one was a good one as both men showed they were ready for WrestleMania. In a surprise, Jericho RETAINED HIS TITLE! Shocking since it is rare for a Royal Rumble winner to lose his title match at WM. We do get a moment after the match where Edge goes over two tables and spears Jericho through the ringside barracade! You have to see it to believe it! Anyway, Jericho is still World Heavyweight Champion.

Vickie Guerrero, Michelle McCool, Layla, Maryse & Alica Fox Vs. Beth Phoenix, Mickie James, Gail Kim, Eve Torres & Kelly Kelly - This one was kept mercifully short! Highlights of it was a nice ax-kick by Alicia Fox on one of the ladies and we do see Vickie actually take a bit of a beating before being saved by Michelle with her version of the ""styles clash."" Ends when Vickie Guerrero does a horrible attempt at her late husband's Eddie Guerrero's ""frog splash."" Michael Cole, for once, says something accurate when called the ""Bullfrog Splash."" LOL! Got to give him credit, that line was priceless!

John Cena Vs. Batista (WWE World Title Match) - I have to admit, these two do manage to pull off good matches. Don't get me wrong, don't expect a Ring Of Honor or a TNA type of bout (pre-Hulk Hogan/Eric Bischoff) from these two but they put on a decent show. John Cena winning wasn't much of a surprise since Batista has had TWO victories over him so it was time for John to get one. John wins his 9th world title.

The Undertaker Vs. Shawn Michaels (If Shawn loses, he must retire) - For only the fourth time in the history of WrestleMania, a non-title bout main events this marquee event! And, to me, this is about the ONLY match I have no problem with going over the title matches! The only other time I felt that a non-title match should've main evented was The Rock Vs. Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania X-8 in 2002. Nothing against HHH & Jericho (which was the main event for the WWE title that year) but no one gave a crap about that match once Hogan/Rock was announced!

Back to this year's event, trust me when I say this match DESERVED to go last!

As for the match itself, I actually prefer the one from the previous year but this one doesn't suck by no means! These two left it all out there. Ends in The Undertaker saving his streak and Shawn losing his career. I won't give away the aftermath but it is touching and the crowd was nearly in tears. If this is indeed Shawn's final match, then what a way to go out! God's blessings Shawn Michaels and thanks!

Overall, a good effort for WM. While not its best, it was easily a better show than last years! I would recommend waiting for this DVD and even seeing if you can find it at a low price.",1269820800,3,6736,4.522596548890715

4081376,4,B0037HERAM,"Wrestlemania 26 is slighty above average as far as Wrestlemanias go.  For me, HBK vs. Undertaker makes this Wrestlemania.  While it is difficult to live up to the classic that was the Wrestlemania 25 matchup, the return match comes very close.  This installment is worth owning if your a wrestling fan or historian for the fact that this was the last match in Shawn Micheals career.  While that is often an overused statement in pro wrestling, it is saying something when he has kept his word on not wrestling since.

However, the rest of the card was pretty good.  HBK and Undertaker put on another great show, though in my opinion I believe their match in the prior WM was better, they still stole the show.

4081390,4,B0037HERAM,"The WrestleMania 3-Disc Collector's Edition Blu-ray set is a perfect thing to get for a wrestling fan; you get WrestleMania 26 and the pre-mania dark match on disc one, the WWE 2010 Hall of Fame Ceremony in it's entirety with bonus matches and segments on disc two, as well as both episodes of WWE Raw and SmackDown the Monday and Friday before Wrestlemania as blu-ray exclusives on a third disc. All the extras and blu-ray exclusives are wonderful, and make it worth it to get the blu-ray if you can.

WrestleMania 26 is great, with only a few duds, but a major problem throughout the show are time restraints that were placed on a few matches to make time for other matches, including some that didn't need to happen. My case and point being the Hart Vs. McMahon disaster, and that pointless 10 diva match that took away time from great matches like CM Punk Vs. Rey Mysterio as well as the triple threat and tag title matches that opened the PPV. With that out of the way, the event is solid, but for the aforementioned flaws. The tag title match, while short, was an exciting way to start the in-ring action, and was followed by an exciting triple threat match that plays out more as a handicap match for the short time it graces us. Things pick up after an awful segment with Vickie Guerrero, with the biggest Money in the Bank match in WrestleMania history, that is action packed all the way through. I won't spoil it for you, but if you haven't seen the finish of this match, it makes for a highlight for the young-man who wins. Great multi-man ladder match, with a ton of sick spots. And man, does it keep getting good from here, as we get an early highlight of Sheamus WWE career when he takes on Triple H in a great match. Starting off as a complete brawl, the pace changes several times during the match, and the ending is full of finishers and counters, with an awesome counter-victory to finish. Just a great match, where both men shine, with Sheamus not only keeping up with HHH, but also setting the pace several time. Just a really solid first 'Mania bout for Sheamus. Try not to blink after the CM Punk vs Rey Mysterio hype-video, because you just might miss the match. Seriously, for the ridiculously short amount of time given, these two had a great match with a break-neck pace, some sick looking moves and ridiculous counters that make this one of the best under ten-minute matches I've ever seen. Things go to crap from here, though, as it's Vince vs. Bret; and the best part, you can watch the pre-match video, and skip the match. This match was awful, as much fun as it is to watch Vince get beat, it was boring, and dragged on for way too long. Only Bret's biggest fans could watch this. Luckily, we are then treated to Chris Jericho Vs. Edge for the World championship. A classic heel vs. face, ex-best-friends story here, and a borderline classic to go with that story. These two work hard to make you forget about the last match, and remember them; counters among counters, and a finishing sequence resulting in an outcome I never expected. A wonderful clash for the gold, where both men gave everything thing they had to deliver on a great stage, and it showed. This match is followed by a weird ten-women match, but it was fun too watch them botch all those moves, DUD! It's alright, though, because it's only like 3 minutes, atleast the time restraints were good for something. From there, we move on to the WWE Championship, as John Cena challenges Batista for the gold in an epic encounter, that is only let down by a few botches on both men's parts. While I'm not a big fan of the finish, it was still a really good match, and worthy to lead-in to the real main-event, Shawn Michaels Vs. The Undertaker. It's HBK's fabled career up against The Undertaker's infamous streak, and what an emotional masterpiece as both men delivered after all the build-up and ended WrestleMania with an all-out war! A classic showdown that will be written in both men's careers as one of their best matches, along with their bout at 'Mania 25, in both of their careers.

As mentioned a few times, time restraints were a real bummer here, but the show remains fantastic with only a couple duds(10 diva match, Vince Vs. Bret), this Wrestlemania is loaded with quality matches, and the blu-ray adds bonus content that supplements Wrestlemania 26 really well. You get a week of TV build up, and the Entire Hall of Fame ceremony, all great to watch before watching mania.  If you are fan of wrestling, and missed 'Mania26, this version is great, and includes nine hours of WWE programming, a great set for fans.

  Great match,great ending,but could not top Wrestlemania 25 match. I mean i was happy these two icon's where gonna fight. But i think i would have been more happy,if this match didn't take place. And Shawn would of Quit at Wresltmania's 25th one. Now that does not mean the match was not good,i just mean they should have had left it alone.

#2 Bret vs. Vince
Don't even get me started on that wast of time,and money.

#3 Chris Jericho vs. Edge
  Great match,i would have wanted  edge to win. But he didn't.

#4. John Cena vs. Batista...........Alright,Well let just say Alright.

-Unified Tag Team Championship Match, The Big Show & The Miz (Champions) vs. R-Truth & John Morrison: A quick one here as it's simply just to warm up the crowd, R-Truth & Morrison do their best even have the big man down for only a two count. John takes it to Miz who makes a blind tag to Show, Morrison gets hit with Knockout Punch and Miz covers to retain the titles. 3/10 cause it was so short.

-Triple Threat Match, Ted DiBiase vs. Randy Orton vs. Cody Rhodes: After months of tension, the breakup of Legacy had finally occured and Orton was out to destroy his two apprentices while Ted & Cody wanted to prove themselves on the grand stage of Wrestlemania. Its not a bad match though kind of underwhelming, there was the expected double teaming from Rhodes and DiBiase as the beat down Randy for a few minutes much to the crowds disapproval. That doesn't last too long as they soon go at it hammering each other in and out of the ring, then Orton makes his comeback hitting trademark move after move including a double DDT off the second rope. He hits the punt on Cody then the RKO on Ted and covers him to win. 5/10.

-Money In The Bank Ladder Match, Kofi Kingston vs. MVP vs. Evan Bourne vs. Jack Swagger vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Matt Hardy vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Drew McIntyre vs. Kane vs. Christian: Talk about a packed match, a 10 man ladder match so its for sure to be filled with tons of high spots. The rest of the superstars target Drew & Kane to take the bigger men out, Dolph hits the Zig Zag on Christian off the ladder, Evan hits Air Bourne off a ladder onto Christian, Matt taking a massive spill onto a ladder. More great spots include a chokeslam to Ziggler on the ladder, a reverse DDT by Christian to Hardy off the ladder then at the end Swagger knocks Christian off the ladder and grabs the briefcase to win. 7/10.

-Howard Finkel introduces the class of 2010 Hall of Fame, Stu Hart (Represented by the hart Family), Wendi Ricther, Mad Dog Vachon, Antonio Anoki, Bob Uecker, Gorgeous George (Accepted by his ex wife Betty Wagner) and ""The Million Dollar Man"" Ted DiBiase.

-Sheamus vs. Triple H: Shockingly enough Trips is not near the top of the card here and this may have been a blessing as this was a good match that was perfect right where it was on the PPV. Its not really a fast paced match, Trips hits his usual offense including a figure four leg lock, Sheamus uses his power and works on Trips back and neck with a backbreaker and a chin lock. There's the comeback where both trade punches but the Trips hits the high knee, facebuster but only for two, Sheamus hits the big kick but only for two. Sheamus tries picking up Trips but he gets hit with the pedigree and Trips covers for the win. 6/10.

-CM Punk vs. Rey Mysterio, If Rey Loses He Must Join the Straight Edge Society: Good pre-match promo from Punk who was in full heel mode tonight, Rey comes out in an Avatar like outfit and the fight is on, just too bad its so short. Punk targets Rey's knee while Serena and Luke Gallows get a couple of cheap shots in, Punk then slams Rey facefirst off the steel steps and it seemed everytime Rey hit a move he couldn't keep the momentum. However Rey does hit a DDT off the top rope but only for two, Rey then goes for the frog splash but Punk moves out of the way but only gets a cover for two. Rey sends Punk into Gallows then hits the 619 and the splash off the top for three. 6/10.

-No Holds Barred Match, Vince McMahon vs. Bret Hart: Over 12 years of anger and rage stemming from the Montreal Screwjob incident we have this match and while its not expected to be great given Bret's health and Vince's lack of wrestling ability this is still one bad match. Vince brings out the Hart family as lumberjacks claiming to have bought them off, even had Bruce Hart as the ref, but Bret turned it around saying family is stronger than money and they proceed to take turns beating up Vince. Bret doesn't do too much, throws some punches, uses a crowbar, a steel chair then locks on the sharpshooter and Vince taps out. 1/10. Bret and his family celebrate afterwards.

-World Heavyweight Championship Match, Chris Jericho (Champion) vs. Edge: Not a bad one here but it seemed just a tad forced given the spear chant Edge had going and that I don't think people bought into him coming back as a face. That being said they do work well together, but they have had better matches in the past, but for this match Chris targets the injured leg of Edge and his back setting up for the Walls, while Edge went after Jericho and kept setting up for the spear. Jericho hits Edge with the title belt then a Codebreaker and covers Edge to retain his title. 7/10. The aftermath was decent as Edge went nuts and hit a spear off the announce table through the barricade.

-10 Diva Tag Team Match, Michelle McCool, Layla, Alicia Fox, Maryse & Vickie Guerrero vs. Eve, Kelly Kelly, Mickie James, Gail Kim & Beth Phoenix: This is the expected clustered divas match and its not that good Vickie gets beat up some, then each of the women start hitting their finishers in succession. Vickie ends up hitting a splash off the top rope in a tribute to her late husband Eddie Guerrero as she covers Kelly to win. 1/10. Side Note: The commentary here was priceless as they didn't seem to care at all.

Disc 2

-WWE Championship Match, Batista (Champion) vs. John Cena: After their clash at Summerslam '08 these two didn't face off in a one on one match again until Batista came out at the Elimination Chamber PPV and beat Cena for the title. This match made up for their Summerslam match as it was well done as Batista used his power while Cena kept battling back to beat down the Animal. They both trade momentum and high impact moves and Batista kicks out of the AA, goes for the Batista Bomb but its countered into the STF and the Animal finally taps out giving Cena his 9th title reign. 9/10.

-Career vs. Streak, Shawn Michaels vs. The Undertaker: Last year these two had a match that should've been the main event of Wrestlemania, this time they are in the spotlight as they close the show, where if Shawn doesn't win he will retire. Is it as good as their match last year? No, how could it be? However its nearly as good and trying to describe a Shawn/Taker match is pretty much impossible, Shawn uses plenty of submission moves, Taker uses his power and there are plenty of memorable moments. At the end Michaels keeps trying to rise up, Taker yells at him to ""Stay down"", Shawn slaps Taker which causes the Deadman to hit a devastating Tombstone that keeps Michaels down for three, thus ending the career of HBK. 10/10.

Extras on Disc 2

-Wrestlemania 26-Man Battle Royal: Its the usual warm-up match for the live crowd before the PPV, lots of mid card wrestlers in this one with Yoshi Tatsu winning. 6/10.

All of these speeches were good though DiBiase's is a personal favorite of mine and Uecker seemed very gracious that he was included in the Hall of Fame.

Its not the best Wrestlemania ever, the opening, Diva's and Bret/Vince match either were badly booked, boring or too long, but the main event matches help make it at least a decent one in the ranks of Wrestlemania history.",1323216000,,8287,4.5026631158455395
4081396,5,B0037HERAM,What can I say about Wrestlmania 26? Very good. I would say this is the best Wrestlmania since the first one. You need to see this DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1323043200,,153,4.703703703703703
4081397,4,B0037HERAM,"I personally really enjoyed this wrestlemania. here is the scoring system. there are 10 matches. so i will rank each match out of 10. total score at the end can be 100. very simple stuff.

1st match: unified tag team championships
champions big show & the miz (showmiz) vs. john morrison and R-truth
this match was a pretty good way to start an event such as wrestlemania. a lot of fast paced action and good showing from showmiz. in the end big show tagged himself in when miz was bouncing off the ropes and when morrison got on the second rope for the flash kick, big show put his lights out with a big right hand. showmiz retains. 6/10

2nd match: triple threat match
Randy orton vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Ted dibiase
You can obviously tell that this wasn't a triple threat match. more of a 2 on 1 handicap match. Rhodes and Dibiase practically beat the living crap out of Orton during the whole match. Whenever Randy got back up they would beat him down again. but eventually they started fighting for the pinfall. randy took advantage and got an RKO on them both and then punted Cody. winner: randy orton 5/10

3rd match: Money in the bank ladder match
Kane vs. Christian vs. Kofi Kingston vs. MVP vs. Matt Hardy vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Evan Bourne vs. Drew Mcintyre vs. Jack Swagger vs. Dolph Ziggler
to start off, mcintyre and ziggler did practically nothing the entire match. and i wasn't as impressed with this one as i was with the other MITB's. some highlights are, an airbourne off a ladder, a twist of fate off a ladder and kofi using to halves of a ladder as stilts! in the end, swagger climbed the ladder and took his breifcase. winner: jack swagger 6/10

4th match: Triple H vs. Sheamus
I LOVED this match. a lot of great action and a lot of storyline behind it as well. great performance by Sheamus who actually fought a better match than i thought. lots of signature moves and 2 big brogue kicks from sheamus, surprisingly, triple H was able to get up from them both. triple H was able to get a pedigree to put sheamus on the mat for the 3 count.  winner: triple H 8/10

5th match: Rey mysterio vs. CM punk
I would give a hand to both the competitors in this match. although punk had the upper hand because mysterio couldn't go near the ropes in fear that the straight edge society might hit him. Mysterio even attempted a Eddie guererro frog splash. Rey is a favorite of mine but there is no denying punks skill in this sport as well. Rey got a 619 to put punk back in his place winner: Rey Mysterio 7/10

6th match: No holds barred match
Bret ""hitman"" Hart vs. Mr. Mcmahon
Why does mr. mcmahon make these challenges? he always gets the crap kicked out of him. Bret beats on him the entire match while his family cheered him on at ringside. Bret also gets a bunch of chairshots on vince which is payback for the Montreal screwjob. extremely slow paced match though, mostly cuz mr. mcmahon doesn't fight back the entire time  winner: Bret Hart 4/10

7th match: World Heavyweight Championship
champion Chris Jericho vs. Edge
The match i couldn't wait for! completely even between both superstars. i had no idea how this was going to play out, i wasn't dissapointed though. i was sitting with my mouth wide open on the edge of my seat watching this one. lots of action everywhere, inside and outside the ring. Edge just couldn't get the spear no matter wat he did. but Jericho was clever, he hit Edge with the title belt when the ref was out, and was astonished when edge kicked out. so he hit a codebreaker and ended it to retain. But Edge got revenge after the match by spearing Chris off an announce table through a barricade!
winner: chris Jericho 10/10

8th match: 10 Diva tag team match
Mickie James, Kelly Kelly, Eve, Gail Kim & Beth Phoenix vs. Michelle Mccool, Maryse, Layla, Alicia Fox & Vickie Guerrero
that's right, i said Vickie Guerrero. i understand that womens wrestling needs credit too. but they just aren't fun to watch wrestle. i think this match was no good but still deserves credit where credit is due. Winner: team Guerrero 3/10

9th match: WWE championship
champion Batista vs. John cena
Best match of the night. stand up and applause this performance. cena and batista both fought untill their last breath here. batista kicked out of a attitude adjustment and powered his way out of an STF. Cena got out of 1 batista bomb. not as good as their i Quit match at over the limit but still a great classic! cena reversed the batista bomb into an STF to make Batista tap winner: John Cena 10/10

10th match: Streak vs. Career
Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels
two legends, one battle. one year before, these two put on the best match possibly ever at wrestlemania 25. Undertaker won with a tombstone piledriver. ever since then michaels has been looking for a rematch but the undertaker wouldn't give it to him. so michaels showed up inside the elimination chamber and cost undertaker the world championship. then undertaker excepeted. Another outstanding performance from both men. beating each other senseless and constantly trying to hit big moves. Michaels really stuck out in this match, he was fighting for his career here. but his fight was useless. after a long, brutal, epic and forever to be remembered battle. shawn was crawling up the undertakers leg with a lifless look in his eye. the undertaker looked like he had a hint of mercy in him for a second. but michaels delivered a large slap to the side of the face of the undertaker. the undertaker came back with probably the most devastating tombstone piledriver ive ever seen. the undertaker got the 3 count and helped michaels up at the end as a show of respect. and then michaels took the long walk up the stage and out the door. winner: Undertaker 10/10

overall score 69 pretty good score i say. definatly worth your time and money",1322352000,,5826,4.542421353670162
4081398,5,B0037HERAM,"This was a non-dissapointing WrestleMania without a doubt. When I saw this live on pay-per-view, I thought it sucked. That was because I watched 4/10 matches. It had the return of a big Hall of Famer seeking revenge after the Montreal Screwjob of 1997, one of the biggest Career Threatening rematches in history, and two great other Championship Main Events. I am going to start rating matches out of 10 and labeling the times for the matches since they are on wikipedia.

1. Unified Tag Team Championship Match
ShowMiz (The Big Show and The Miz)(c) vs. John Morrison and R-Truth (3:23)
I highly enjoyed this matched even though kept short. The Miz and Morrison fight well together and were a great tag team. I don't think this should have been a filler like it was since it took up 5 minutes. A pretty obvious ending. 7.5/10

2. Triple Threat Match
Randy Orton vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Ted DiBiase Jr. (9:02)
I liked this match overall, but Randy Orton should have had a more main-eventing position in the pay-per-view. I also didn't think it was a good idea for Legacy to completely disband. I think this would have better off being a 2-on-1 handicap match. Randy Orton made great double team moves on his own and took a beating at the same time. Rhodes and DiBiase pretty much touched each other and made a big deal about it. You don't need to know everything about WWE to guess that Randy Orton won. 7/10

3. 10 Man Money in the Bank Ladder Match:
Christian vs. Evan Bourne vs. MVP vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Jack Swagger vs. Kane vs. Drew McIntyre vs. Matt Hardy (13:44)
When I first saw this match, I loved it a lot. I thought that it was a long, great, must-watch match. After buying the DVD, I thought the opposite. I didn't enjoy it as much as I did at first. I is still a good Money in the Bank Ladder Match, and the only 10 man one. The best part was when Kingston used the split ladder and walked across the ring using it as legs. Also, Evan Bourne doing the shooting star press of the top of a ladder and on to Christian. I actually expected more of Christian and Benjamin because of their fantastic ladder match they had at TLC 2009. 7.5/10

4. Triple H vs. Sheamus (12:09)
I also would have liked Triple H being a big main-eventer as well. But since he wasn't he put on a great and memorable match with the the Celtic Warrior, Sheamus. A well thought out power vs. power match with OK story behind it. I don't think I've ever seen Shaemus working his ass of more. This was just a challenge kind of match with Sheamus trying to make a memorable WrestleMania moment. The promo gives good background on Triple H and his WrestleMania moments. 8.5/10

5. CM Punk vs. Rey Mysterio (6:59) (If Mysterio loses, he must join the Straight Edge Society)
This match was given short time, but turned out incredible, I had to watch it twice. All the promo is just explaing how Mysterio's daughter turned 9 on the day of a SmackDown! show. And, of course, the new heel CM Punk comes out and ruins the celebration. This great match turned into a great rivalry throughout the beginning of 2010. Punk and Mysterio brought a great match at Armageddon 2008 if you've never seen it. CM Punk did the most work in the match based of reversals. Rey Mysterio really pulled off a couple successful high-flying moves and jst did kicks. The best thing Mysterio did do was  backflipping of the ropes, and onto Punk's back while holding his wrist. 8.5/10

6. No Hods Barred Match
Bret Hart vs. Vince McMahon (11:09)
Everybody has waited for the return of Bret ""Hitman"" Hart for months now, then Mr. McMahon finally allowed it. I knew how it would turn out. (Them fighting at WrestleMania) AND GUESS WHAT!!! it sucked. I would have rather saw McMahon bring out Shane McMahon and Bret Hart would beat him with a kendo stick. The only thing that I actually liked about this match was the ass whooping that Hart gave McMahon. I know that if I was a WWE fan 15 years ago, I would have loved Bret Hart 4/10

7. World Heavyweight Championship Match
Chris Jericho(c) vs. Edge (15:47)
I loved the idea of this match happening and Edge returning. I didn't know how Chris Jericho would become 5 time World Champion, but I knew he would. The whole thing with the Elimination Chamber was a great idea. Anyway, great match. Decently paced. This seemed like a techical match which I thought was great. Edge had many attempts of hiitting the Spear and Jericho actually hit the Walls of Jericho a lot. I am probably getting this entire description wrong because I barely remember this match. 8.5/10

8. 10 Diva Tag Team Match:  Michelle McCool, Layla, Maryse, Alicia Fox and Vickie Guerrero vs. Kelly Kelly, Eve, Mickie James, Gail Kim and Beth Phoenix (3:24)
This match was just a filler which should have been an add-on to the tag team match and the Punk vs. Mysterio match. All it was was Vickie Guerrero getting her ass kicked then hitting a frog splash onto Kelly Kelly. Vickie's team wins, not important. No rating

9. WWE Championship Match
Batista(c) vs. John Cena (13:30)
I honestly enjoyed this match more than the Heavyweight Match. This rivalry started at the Elimination Chamber when John Cena won the WWE Championship then Batista came and won it due to a deal he made with Vince McMahon. Then it turned to an argument to see who better man was. This match featured the back and forth punches and the Boo! Yeah! chants with the crowd on Batistas side. Starting at the 9 minute mark, the match got great. Batista pulled off the same move that he did at SummerSlam 2008 on Cena to almost break his neck, AGAIN. I would definintely watch this match. 9/10

10. Career vs. Streak No Count Out, No Disqualification Match
The Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels (24:00)
This match was amazing, fast-paced and so exciting. I still think that their WrestleMania XXV encounter beat this match, but not by a lot. Their match at WM 25 was just a singles match. This was a No Disqualification Match with HBK's Career on the line. This included about 2x more Superkicks from Shawn Michaels and probably the most vicious tombstone I have ever seen from the Undertaker. This was a great way to main event WrestleMania. After the match, the two shook hands. 10/10

Overall PPV Rating
75/100",1312243200,,6277,4.54424778761062
4081399,5,B0037HERAM,"This was a great WrestleMania, I could sit and watch every match on the card without getting bored or fast forwarding, the only match i try and skip through is the 10 Diva Tag match but that didn't really effect the card in general.

WWE Unified Tag Team Championship Match
ShowMiz(Big Show & The Miz) (C) VS. John Morrison and R-Truth
This was a good opener, nice paced action, decent selling, some good moves, the fans were into it. The Big Show nails John Morrison with the Knockout punch at the end enableing The Miz to cover Morrison to Retain the Tag Titles for Showmiz
Winners= ShowMiz (Big Show & The Miz) 3.5/5

Randy Orton VS. Cody Rhodes VS. Ted Dibiase
This was a great match, could of been alittle longer but great nonetheless. It was much better then I anticipated, these men have great chemistry together. The match Ends after Orton Punts Rhodes in the Skull and RKOs Dibiase after countering Dream Street. I don't beleive this should been second but I'm not complaining, Great match one of my favorites of the night.
Winner= Randy Orton 4/5

MITB Ladder Match
Kane VS. Kofi Kingston VS. Matt Hardy VS. Christian VS. MVP VS. Shelton Benjamin VS. Jack Swagger VS. Evan Bourne VS. Drew Mcintyre VS. Dolph Ziggler
Money in the Bank Ladder matches have become synonomous with WrestleMania. Going back and watching this makes me wonder why they would give this a stipulated PPV rather then keeping it on the Mania card. Stupid move if you ask me it really added alot to the event. This match was no different then previous ones, great match, great spots. I wasn't expecting Jack Swagger to win but hes great in ring and defanitly a future main eventer and I was happy to see they took a gamble and gave him this one. I thought It would of gone to Kingston, Christian or Mcintyre but nonetheless Great match.
Winner= Jack Swagger 5/5

Triple H VS. Sheamus
Great Match, much better then I anticipated, These 2 have great chemistry and can work a great match together. I would of liked to have seen more basic wrestling matches with these 2, they work well with one another, I was expecting to see a brawl with a few reversals and a few finisher attempts and hits however I was proven utterly wrong. Great match
Winner= Triple H 3.5/5

Rey Mysterio VS. CM Punk
This one I was alittle Dissapointed with. It was a good match no question but it was built up very well and ended up being one of the shortest matches on the card, just under 7 minutes. You can expect to see a good match anytime these 2 men hook up and this was no exception. WWE just didn't take or give these 2 any time to put on a classic which it could of been. Again good match but if you want a good taste of what these 2 are capable of watch their matches at Extreme Rules 2010 or Over The Limit 2010 those matches are proof they can put on a show.
Winner= Rey Mysterio 3/5

Bret Hart VS. Vince McMahon (No Holds Barred Match)
I thought as one of the posters below me stated that this would be more like McMahon VS. HBK or McMahon VS. Hogan or Vince VS. Shane but it wasnt. It ended up being a time killer that involved bret beating vince the whole match and ending it with a sharpshooter. It could of been much worse but it was nothing special.
Winner= Bret Hart 2/5

WWE World Heavyweight Championship Match
Chris Jericho (C) VS. Edge
This Match was a Great Match, Defanitly the second best match of the night no question. Anytime these 2 are in a match together you know youll get a good show, they have great chemistry. The match ends after Jericho nails Edge with the title belt and nails a codebreaker. I wasn't expecting Jericho to win seeing as how Edge won the Royal Rumble but I didn't care who won because I love watching both these guys. Surprise spear off the announce table through the barricade after the match was over. Edge got the last laugh of the night.
Winner= Chris Jericho 5/5

10 Diva Tag Team Match
Mickie James, Kelly Kelly, Eve, Gail Kim and Beth Pheonix VS. Michelle McCool, Maryse, Layla, Alicia Fox and Vickie Guerrero.
Boring waste of time match, nothing special that they couldn't of done on raw. I would of much rather seen a decent singles match for the Women's Championship but they rarely do one on one women's championship matches at WM anymore.
Winners= Michelle McCool, Maryse, Layla, Alicia Fox and Vickie Guerrero. 1/5

WWE Championship Match
Batista (C) VS. John Cena
This Match had a good storyline and a solid buildup. Batista By the way should have been playing a heel character a long time ago, they actually show him with a personality instead of the strong and silent face character...boring. Good match, Although I like their SummerSlam 2008 match much better this match was good and smooth great offense, defense and selling by both men.
Winner= John Cena (New Champ) 4/5

Career VS. Streak Match
The Undertaker VS. Shawn Michaels
This was an amazing match, you very seldom  see a follow up or part 2 match that is this good or stands out to the extent that this did. The fans were into this as much as the announcers, great showing by both men. You knew the streak wouldn't end but you didn't want HBK's Career to end so either outcome seemed unbeleiveable so that added much emotion, attention and anticipation to the match as well. Again great match Shawn Michaels went out with a bang.
Winner= The Undertaker (18-0) 5/5

All In All it was a great card and defanitly worth the buy even if you decide to skip Bret VS. Vince and the 10 diva tag you won't be missing much.",1309910400,,5497,4.4750499001996005
4081400,5,B0037HERAM,THIS IS A GOOD ADDITION TO MY GRANDSONS COLLECTION. GOOD PRICE. FAST DELIVERY. I WOULD BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN. GREAT STOCKING STUFFER FOR ALL AGES. THANKS. A++++,1308960000,,165,4.928571428571429
4081401,5,B0037HERAM,"I actually thought that this WM was very good and provided some awesome moments to add to ever expanding WM vault.  This WM was held in Glendale AZ in front of 72,219 and it was stellar.  The event began with a WM opening promo to get u primed for the event and then we see a fairly descent rendition of America the Beautiful by former American Idol contestant and winner Fantasia.  On with the show:

The opening match is for the WWE Unified tag titles between the champs Big Show and Miz against John Morrison and R-Truth.  This was a fairly good match that could have been given some more airtime as it clocked in at a little over 3:00.  I was hoping to see Morrison explode in this match but due to the time he really could not do that.  Still, this was a good way to open the card.  I give this match a 5/10.

Next we get a segment called the sights and sounds of Wrestlemania which was an okay segment.  Then, we go into the battle of legacy as former partners Randy Orton battled Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase Jr in a Triple Threat match.  This was a good match.  I was hoping to see more from Ted but otherwise I thought this match was basically very good with Orton getting the win at just over 9:00.  5/10

Next we get an interview with Vickie Guerrero who is actually one of my favorite personalities in WWE so i was entertained with this interview.  Next we the get the Money in the Bank Ladder match which featured Kofi Kingston, MVP, Evan Bourne, Shelton Benjamin, Matt Hardy, Dolph Ziggler, Drew McIntrye, Kane, Christian and eventual winner Jack Swagger.  I was really expecting more from this match with show stealers and high flyers Kofi, Bourne and Shelton in the match but this match was actually just an average ladder match with no real show stealing moves.  Kofi did provide some moments but nothing breathtaking.  I give this match a 6/10.

Next we get the Hall of Fame class of 2010 which featured some interesting choices.  This year we see Mad Dog Vachon, Wendi Richter, Stu Hart, Antonio Inoki, Bob Uecker, Gorgeous George and Million Dollar Man Ted DiBiase go into the hall of fame.  Always nice to see the superstars of the past.  After this we see a video package of events that led up to the Triple H/Sheamus match.

The match with Triple H and Sheamus on paper looked like it could really stink up the card but suprisingly this match delivered.  I liked the hard hitting nature of this match and how it appeared that maybe just maybe the young up and comer Sheamus might just come out on top until Triple H hits the pedigree for the pin and the win at 12:17.  This was a good match.  I give this one 8/10.

Then we go right into a video package of the events that led up to the Rey Mysterio/CM Punk match.

This match was good but really could have been a lot better if they would have been given more time to perform.  The match, I felt could have went over 12:00 to maybe steal the show but it clocked in at just over 6:00, however I still feel that this match is a good match and worth the watch.  6/10.

Then we go right into a video package of the events that led up to the No Holds Barred match between rivals Bret Hart and Vince McMahon.

This was a good match that started with Vince apparently having bought off the entire Hart family who came out and surrounded the ring and Bruce Hart getting in the ring to be the referee.  Bret though had a plan and it was a double cross and at this point basically it is a total beat down of Vince by most if not all of the Hart family getting their licks in.  I was suprised at what Bret could do with the career ending brain damage he suffered as well as the stroke that he suffered, he was actually pretty good.  I saw Vince take a beating by the family and with multiple chair shots as well.  Vince decided to end it all when he applied the sharpshooter and Vince would submit at a little over 11:00.  I liked this match.  8/10.

Up next we get another video package of events that led up to the World Heavyweight title match between Edge and Chris Jericho.

I got to tell u this match was very very very close to being the match of the night.  You could tell that we were dealing with two hardened warriors who knew how to work a match with the time they were given.  This match was a great wrestling match with some good highspots added in just to get the fans into it.  I liked this match a lot.  10/10.

Up next we get a 10 Diva tag match between Michelle McCool, Maryese, Layla, Alicia Fox and Vickie Guerrero against Mickie James, Kelly Kelly, Eve, Gail Kim and Beth Pheonix.  This was an okay match but nothing special.  I can't believe in the course of a few years just how much the Diva divison of the WWE has fallen.  All in all you could just skip over this match.  2/10.

Next we get a video package of events that led up the WWE Championship match between Batista and John Cena.

This was a realy good match as well.  It's not often even at WM that we get two exceptional title matches but this WM delivered and this match between Batista and Cena was just fantastic.  I'm still a little on the fence as to whether this match was as good as the Summerslam they had and I can say that yes it is.  I love seeing two powerhouses go at it and that's just what we got.  This match was pure intensity from the opening bell.  I recommend this match to anyone.  10/10.

Now we come to a suprising main event.  Not since WM 11 had a WM ended with a non title match but come on we have maybe the two greatest stars that the WWE has ever had competing in a Streak vs. Career match (Takers WM undefeated streak was on the line against Shawn's career).  I got goosebumps when I saw Shawn Michaels and the Undertaker come out and I was on the edge of my seat for this one.  I remember sitting there and thinking God I love Taker but please don't Shawn lose.  The match was back and forth and many false finishes to add to the drama but when it was all over Taker pinned Shawn and one of the greatest careers of all time was over.  I watched as Shawn said bye to everyone in the stadium that night and I could not help but wonder:  Will this be another Ric Flair moment?  I can honestly say that as of this review, Shawn has not wrestled since this match and I hope he honors it.  This match was just so good it could rank amongest some of the greatest matches of all time and PWI magazine named it match of the year as voted on by the fans.  Just sit back, pop this match in and watch a classic between 2 of the best ever!!!  10/10.

All in all this Mania was one of the better ones that I have seen (and I have seen them all).  The only problems I had with this card was maybe add some more time to the Triple Threat match and to the Rey/Punk match.  Otherwise, this PPV was just great.  What I really liked was the matches kept coming and no silly backstage things or extra things during the show to take away from the show.  All in all this event is well worth seeing and the DVD has some pretty good extras including matches from most of the Hall of Famers.  I give this event as a whole a 9/10.  Highly recommended!!",1307923200,,7103,4.183628318584071
4081402,1,B0037HERAM,"Wrestlemania XXVI is, for better or worse, one for the time capsule. At first glance, it doesn't appear that much more special than other editions; but that's why I'm here, to tell you why it is, indeed, a WWE landmark.
  Now, since you can see my 'star rating', you may be guessing that my feelings toward this episode of 'Vince-a-mania' aren't entirely pleasant. Way to go, Sherlock. Now you can go try to solve that ""Nancy Drew"" mystery from your childhood. As for me, I'm on to the awkward business of reviewing a product aimed solely at children, from the perspective of a 40 year old man...and 35 year long wrestling fan.

1) Big Show/Les Miz vs John (Ugh) Morrison & R-(UGH!)-Truth.
  Really? I know it's no fair to play the 'compare game' with offerings from as much as a decade ago, but really-this is pro wrestling, and it could be EXACTLY like it was ten years ago if that's how the Powers That Be decreed it. With that inarguable fact on my side, I can't help but glance once again at this list of names, and reminisce about other Tag Title contests waged at the ""Most marketed stage of them all"": The Dudley Boys vs Edge/Christian vs The Hardy Boyz in their still-amazing TLC battle. Can this year's version actually be from the same company that produced this classic? I'll go all the way back to Mania XIII, and give you an example of good booking, combining great workers with marquee name value: Tag champs Owen Hart & Davey Boy Smith vs (Big Van) Vader & Mankind (Mick Foley) w/ Paul Bearer. I'm not sure what my point is, but this is a sad truth-the 4 or 5 minutes that Owen and Vader go head to head in this bout contain more drama, toughness, and psychology (Keep the fans tuned in, basically) than any one of the 4 yutzes in this latest title tilt will ever see, or generate, in their entire careers. (Show notwithstanding; though far from great, he's had several handfulls of memorable moments over his WCW and WWF/E career.)
2) Orton vs Ted, Jr vs Dusty, Jr.
  Not only meaningless, but since it was contested by 3 individuals who were taught how to perform by WWE officials, thus have no diversity in thier ability nor actual experiences to draw from, it's also pillowy soft-these guys work like they're auditioning for an underwear modeling gig the next day and can't afford a bruise. Awful.
3)MITB ladder match
  The constant 'bury, push, repeat' cycle that Jack Swagger has had to endure since his debut was apparently back on 'push' mode. I couldn't help but think that, as he struggled mightily to unlock the briefcase from it's hook for several agonizing minutes, that this humiliating public tour de force would cause his career mode to move to 'B' for a nice long while...
4)Triple H vs Sheamus
  Since Trips was about to take the rest of the year off, at least on-camera, this bout looked as predictable as the main event itself. Of COURSE you put the monster heel over clean, since that's the only way to turn unknown quantities into money-generating headliners. But then...a swerve-ball from 'The Game'! The WWE once again fools us all by having the NEXT 'Next Big Thing' do a clean job to the 40 year old executive. Well, DUH! This is WrestleMania! You don't expect a man with Triple H's pedigree (awful pun intended) to lie down now, do you? Even if it means putting a screeching halt to the momentum Sheamus had gathered due to performance and expensive marketing, right? After carefully cultivating an image of the 'wise veteran that can be looked up to by the boys in the back', it takes just a count of three to remind us all why he had become known as this generation's Hulk Hogan.
5)Rey Mysterio vs CM Punk
  The Wrestling Gods delivered Punk unto the WWE as a gift, sort of an exasperated offering that would help the creative department and Vince McMahon himself understand the importance of the 'heel character' in the business. Naturally, despite countless hours of beautiful heeling, both on the mic and in the ring, available on DVDs, the company decided to turn him into a babyface. ""He can't be a heel!"", I can imagine the sage voice of reason coming from the executive office bellowing. ""He's too small, plus his image is that he's 'straight edge', meaning he doesn't drink or smoke, and believes in taking care of his body...the fans LOVE that sort of role model! Nobody booed when the Hulkster told them to take their vitamins, right??"" So, after a year or 2 of floundering in a 'spinoff' show called, sacriligiously, ""ECW"", the baffled writing staff threw caution to the wind and flipped this beacon of purity, and to their utter shock...he got actual heat! Then, of couse, after single-handedly energizing the company and it's fans with his astounding microphone work and ring psychology during his feud with Jeff Hardy, came the bombshell-Punk had committed the unpardonable sin on his off-time. No, not assault on a woman (Steve Austin), illegally obtaining performance enhancing drugs and lying about it on national TV (Hulk Hogan), certainly not murder (Jimmy Snuka, allegedly, according to several insiders and respected journalists). No, far far worse-he said the Lord's name in vain. The Lord being, in the WWE, John Cena. But thanks to that noble whistleblower Mark Callaway, a long time performer for the company, his unpardonable sin did not go unpunished. And despite his consistently valuable work, and shocking ability to remain fresh and complex in a smothering and dictatorial regime, the public burial continues. Oh, and just what was it he had foolishly said about John-Boy in public, near people? After being questioned by Mr. Calla-Taker about his rather casual choice of clothing to be seen in when off the clock, Punk replied something along the lines of, ""Doesn't John dress in jeans, really casually, also?"". I think now you see why justice HAD to be served.
Bret Hart vs Mr McMahon
  There were really only 2 fears i ever had concerning the wrestling industry: The first began in the mid-1980's, as i watched promotion after promotion be devoured by the evil and merciless Titan Sports, Inc., and officially came to fruition in early 2001, when the Generalissimo finally found the only 2 survivors of the genocide, penniless and mortally wounded through a combination of greed, ineptitude(WCW), and inevitability (ECW, the real one) hiding like Sadaam, in plain sight. The execution was swift and unhindered by sentimentality or remembrances. However, I felt safe that Fear #2 would remain unfounded-sure, Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart might work with the company that had helped to create, then did far more to destroy, the man once known as ""the best there is, the best there was, and the best there ever will be"". (The rumor his demise came about due to the inability to place that long nickname on merchandise remains just that, a rumor). But surely the only cooperation betwixt the two would be far off-screen and off-radar, a strictly business collaboration on a DVD perhaps, or something of that ilk.
  There are always signs that the world is coming to an end, if you look hard enough. Heck, Sports Illustrated has a little piece each week called ""This week's sign of the Apocalypse"". But there are little handheld signs, and then there's this, which is a billboard viewable from outer space. Screw me over on the way out the door, check. Have your announcers bad mouth me on a consistent basis every chance they get (which is pretty much whenever they're on the air), check. And the biggie-be responsible, through vengeful booking and complicity, for my brother's ghastly death, plunging from the rafters of Kemper Arena in Kansas City, in front of 20,000 confused fans and another million or so watching at home on PPV...check, and mate.
If having your former boss wipe out your family members wasn't bad enough, Bret, now with the competitor making incredible amounts of money but being made to look like just another guy, thanks to the powers running WCW, gets kicked in the head by a guy who was placed on top thanks to a phony winning streak and blink-and-you'll-miss-'em matches designed to get him over, and get him out of the ring before people realize he's not quite as immaculate as advertised. All of the bumps, all of the blood, sweat, and tears he'd literally given to this insane business he loved, couldn't keep him down. The death of his 34 year old brother in a wrestling ring only kept him away a few months. What more proof do you need that when your time's up, it's up? Hundreds, thousands of matches, and his career ends thanks to a sloppy performer attempting to do things his body wasn't built to do. Career over. At least, thanks to the possibility of recurring concussions, he won't be tempted to return to the WWE.
Or won't he? Wrestling and every other contact sport is filled with guys competing with or coming back too soon from severe head trauma. Could it be...after everything...
That's when those pesky Wrestling Gods dealt The Hitman a low blow, to make darn sure he didn't think about it. Joyriding on his motorcycle, with no reason to fear a thing, Hart was suddenly and stunningly hit by a seizure, causing him to crash his bike and sustain numerous serious injuries. Now...finally...it's over. Time for those career retrospectives, folks, cuz Bret was more done than a Tom Turkey cooked by an alcoholic.
So how did it come to this? When the news broke that Hart would be returning to the WWE, or as he could call it, ""the scene of the crime(s)"", I felt like i'd been slugged  in the gut by Triple-H's sledge. How could he? I mean, ever since that 1997 Survivor Series PPV, proof was everywhere that nice guys finish last. McMahon took the reputation he gained from that event, altered it slightly into a character named ""Mr McMahon"", the owner of the WWF, and rode that through the biggest boom period of his career, saving the company from certain doom at the hands of it's then-flourishing competitor WCW. 4 years after, in 2001, the WWF had started publicly trading their stock, and a fascinating tidbit came out-Vince Mcmahon had become a legitimate billionaire. Through WRESTLING!! Through running a rasslin' company, and on the backs of hundreds of grunts, many of whom profited right along with the Boss, and many more who would love 5 minutes in a locked room with Vince more than anything in the world. Ups and downs followed Vince from there, but didn't that happen to all of us? Vince's ups were much further than most of us could even fathom, while his downs were of the 'Whaddya mean the upstairs jacuzzi's on the fritz again??!!' variety, so that stuff is relative.
Now, here were both men, about to meet face to face on Raw, to perform a choreographed, sanitized version of real life (no mention of horrific plummets or faulty pulley trip locks on Raw), and it occured to me for the 100th time since i'd heard the news of Bret's return, that there was absolutely NO WAY for Bret to not only win, but to come out of this program unscathed. Sure enough, it was booked in a way that made Bret seem angry, yes, and hurt also...It seemed most of his anger was directed at his former arch-foe Shawn Michaels, who despite being the most unpopular man in the locker room for years, had seen things go remarkably well after a back injury caused a 4 year hiatus from the sport.
Guess what? When something like this happens, 99% of us are going to feel one way about it-bitter. So, the 'creative team' got busy trying to do something untried in the wrestling business-create a character who's only motivation is his own bitterness and jealousy toward the evil Midas' who'd helped to ruin his once grand existence...and make that character a babyface. Plus, Vince knew things that Bret didnt. He knew that today's audience, which he had been hard at work changing the look of, wouldn't know about, remember, or care much about the dirty luck that had befallen some ex-rassler 13 years ago. What's the big deal, they'd  say. Aren't these guys dying left and right? Dude should  be glad he's alive. He probably just wants to get rich by suing my man Vince...That's not cool, I love Mr McMahon. Remember when he was making all those guys join his 'kiss my *** club'? Hilarious!

Chris Jericho vs Edge for a world title of some sort.
  I refuse to even try to remember which is the 'WWE championship' and which is the ""World  championship"". Both are apparently of equal value; seems odd that ONE company would need TWO WORLD titles...especially when, poring over their roster, they don't have enough quality guys to make even ONE world title hotly contested over a year's time. I always liked Jericho, except for his propensity for whining to the public. He's whining because some internet magazine said he had a poor night in the ring; now he's mad at TNA, for daring to assert it's creative superiority over the WWE.
But in the ring, Jericho had become a dependable heel. In fact, it could be argued, he had become the WWE's MVP. (Note to readers-Although there is already a wrestler named MVP competing in the company, it's highly doubtful anybody but a family member or the athlete himself would agree with that moniker). So, good to see him win. I believe this is the former Y2J's 37th WWE world title, while my best guess-timate has Edge well past Ric Flair's record, with nearly 150 World title reigns in less than a decade! Amazing! And they say the title's aren't respected anymore...

10-chick tag team match
  This is when it's time for reviewers to reach in their front pocket for their poison pen, the pocket that's not currently filled with the geek's busy right hand thanks to the scattered pitures of the subject matter littering their apartment, their chance to make a stand for women's wrestling, and how these bimbos aren't true athletes like The Fabulous Moolah, who held the World Woman's title for some 40 YEARS before dropping it at the age of 105. In those 40 years, these naive protesters know not, Moolah utilized precisely ONE hold-the hair toss. But still...how DARE the offensiveness, they're not ATHLETES, they're MODELS, and blah blah blah. To step out of that vein, I present all 10 competitors in this tag team event, in the order of which I'd most like to 'give a firm tongue-lashing to', if you get my drift. In other words, #1 is the Diva i'd be most likely to break an elderly relative's leg running over to get near to, and #10 is the one that would have to be the last girl in the bar while I start wondering how i'm gonna make it home with only one working eye.
1)Gail Kim (no, I don't have an Asian fetish, jerks.)
2)Michelle McCool (But i do have a freckles on a hot girl fetish)
3)Layla El (Since i'm 5'11"" and weigh 185 lbs, Layla's tiny body will allow me to pretend i'm Sheamus for a night. But without the failure.)
4)Maryse (I remember my best buddy telling me many years ago that French girls had the best uh, chestral region. Some  20 years after hearing that, I see what he means.) (I'm obviously ignoring the fact that like everyone from Trish Stratus to Ultimate Warrior, she's been medically enhanced. Kayfabe lives here, folks!)
5)Eve (I truthfully couldn't have picked her out of a lineup until I saw some net pics of her today-extremely hot young lady. Now I hope to know her features well enough to remember later with my eyes closed.)
6)Alicia Fox (From a distance, she was neck and neck with Gail for the top spot. Once i got a close-up look at her mug, however, i realized she was just really good looking with an awesome bod. That's approximately 5 degrees of seperation from the Goddess Gail.
7)Mickie James (To be truthful, she might have been a tad lower were i going only by her WWE visage. But thankfully, she got canned and became a TNA Knockout, which is something I desperately hope happens to the top 5 on this list. Which is better, you may ask? Well, dummy, take a look-the WWE, in an effort to change their audience from perceived fat guys in stained wife-beaters drinking Schlitz in their trailer while watching, to a more streamlined, single-digit age group who most likely have a mommy and daddy willing to spend big bucks on whatever little Hunter Jeremy wants, which will hopefully be a warehouse full of kids' toys with the WWE emblem on them, the WWE decided to heavily alter the appearance of it's programming. So, one week Ric Flair is blading into his carotid artery to give the entire front 3 rows a more realistic, redder look at WWE combat-the next week, Flair's been replaced by an Irish midget who seems to show up in EVERY...SINGLE...SEGMENT. And never blades.
TNA on the other hand, has never been shy about letting its girls 'show that thang'. And lately, there's a whole lotta thang to show, as TNA has finally beaten the WWE in one statistic-most hot babes. So Mickey went from being an 'aw, shucks' kinda gal, a little embarassed to have to wear tights but making them as unrevealing as allowable so daddy n momma won't get upset, to dressing, and moving, like a woman who if asked would  they rather have dinner with Canada's Prime Minister, or go finally get that wall size mirror so she can practice posing for what she dreams will someday be a ""Hustler"" cover, mutters something about having prime rib last week on her way to the Giant Mirror store.  And i LIKE that.
8)Kelly Kelly (Kelly's really gorgeous with a great body, and one of my friends has her rated first by far. But due to her not-just-backstage dalliance with actor/kvetch/intolerable Raw guest host Jeremy Piven, she's been severely and permanently downgraded. Although Vince must have been impressed for her shared affinity for C and D list actors. 9)Beth Phoenix 10)Vickie Guererro

John Cena vs Batista
  Of course I'm jealous of John Cena. Would I trade lives with Cena, even if i had to take the constant verbal abuse from schumcks like me? Uh, HELLO?? I just wanted to mention that to prove full disclosure here-like almost everyone over the age of 12, and like every single male over the age of 28 in this country, BAR NONE, I hate John Cena. Is he the worst wrestler in WWE history? No, Ultimate 'Roid Warrior has him beat there. Does he give the most annoying promos ever? Mmm, much closer there, but again, Warrior Nation has that one captured as well. Did the rap gimmick bug me? More the REACTION to the raps themselves, assuredly the most over-praised raps by people that usually know better in ANY entertainment field. ""I'm disgusted with Hip-Hop's caveman-like mentality towards the fairer sex, and i'm a believer in the theory that states the murderous rhymes are glorified to a dangerous extent. But I have to admit-Cena's pretty darn good! A riot, too...he rhymed 'break your crown' with 'on Smackdown' without EVEN STOPPING TO THINK!"" Just listen to the high pitched squeals emanating from whichever cavernous, soulless Mega-Arena Raw is playing at that night...then remember that was a reaction to, roughly, THIS-""You think you-ah good but i am bettuh, you bitin' my style cuz i'm the trendsettuh"". Remember-never address your elders in the form of rap.

Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels: The streak vs retirement
  Unlike the other reviewers here, i was completely underwhelmed when i realized  this was going to be the main event at WM 26. Why? Well, the stip doesnt help-the poster might as well show a picture of Taker standing above a fallen HBK with his hand raised. The other reason my tent didn't pitch-um, they just wrestled last year, folks. So, unless you're into the stipulation and could go either way, hmm, i'm 50/50 on it, and just can't figure out what's going to end-The lucrative, ever-marketable Streak, or the 46 year old's career that as we all know, doesnt have to end as maybe 2 out of the last 750 retirement matches lost were actually honored.
One of the folks on here called this, ""The greatest match of all time"", or something of that exact ilk with maybe different wording. The only way I see that being possible  is if one became a fan just after Mania 25, and also never saw a TNA pay per view. Nevertheless, it was pretty decent, so i'll echo that enthusiastic critique by saying it's the GREATEST MATCH OF ALL WRESTLEMANIA 26.
Last word: The aforementioned Mr Mark Calloway, the selfless whistleblower of justice, got the duke in this match competing under his nom de guerre 'The Undertaker'. So was all now right with the world? I'll withhold my opinion...but one CM Punk was said to have been 'immaculately' dressed backstage.",1299110400,3,20461,4.7002511861568514
4081403,3,B0037HERAM,"When this Wrestlemania took place last year, I had the fortune of being able to see it on the day it aired on pay-per-view at a friend's house. Going into this Wrestlemania, I was HEAVILY anticipating one match [Bret VS. Mcmahon, I'll go into this match later on this review]. And while this Wrestlemania definitely doesn't rank as one of the best Wrestlemania's, This show was alright. However, if you saw the original live broadcast of this Wrestlemania, You immediately noticed that the crowd was absolutely dead for much of the night [until Undertaker VS. Michaels] which is never a good thing for Wrestlemania.

Match-by-match review:

1. For the Unified WWE World Tag Team Championships
Champions The Big Show and The Miz VS. John Morrison and R-Truth
A short but decent match. Before the match began, Truth was noticably very excited to be at this show [His first Wrestlemania match ever] and i do think all 4 men did alright for the short amount of time they were given. Big Show and Miz Retain their titles in this decent opener. ***

2. Triple Threat Match
Randy Orton VS. Cody Rhodes VS. Ted Dibiase
An ok match that could've been better when you consider the talents of the 3 men involved. This match was the result of the bitter breakup of Legacy which was a stable comprised of these 3 men. Because of the fact that both Rhodes and Dibiase turned on Orton, This match mostly has a handicap match feel which would eventually lead to Orton winning this match when Rhodes and Dibiase wouldn't allow each other to pin Orton. ***

3. Money In The Bank Match
Christian VS. Kofi Kingston VS. MVP VS. Jack Swagger VS. Kane VS. Matt Hardy VS. Dolph Ziggler VS. Evan Bourne VS. Shelton Benjamin VS. Drew Mcintyre
Ever since Wrestlemania 21, There was a Money In The Bank match which is a multi-man Ladder match in which the winner wins a contract for a world title match that he can use at any time for one year. Let me say that this match was WAY too crowded!!!! With 10 guys in this match there was a whole lot of people to see and a lot of action to keep up with. After a while it seemed like only 3 people took turns being in the ring but there was some good spots to see [including Kofi Kingston using 2 ladders to walk himself to where the briefcase was hanging!]. Although this is the worst of the six MITB matches that occured at Wrestlemania, This wasn't too bad of a match and it was very nice to see Jack Swagger win this match and get the push he rightfully deserved. ***

4. Triple H VS. Sheamus
A pretty good match from 2 good wrestlers. Although this didn't turn out to be a great match that i was expecting to see from these two, This was a pretty entertaining encounter and Triple H still has a little fire left in him in the ring. ***1/2

5. CM Punk VS. Rey Mysterio
The stipulation for this match is that if Mysterio lost, he would have to join the Straight Edge Society. This was another average match that could've been great. It had some good action to deliver and both men did pretty good against each other. Mysterio won. ***

6. Bret Hart VS. Vince Mcmahon
As a very big Bret Hart fan who remembers the highly controversial and infamous Montreal Screwjob i was highly anticipating this match for well over a decade and let me just say that match was a TOTAL LETDOWN! Before the match even got under way, It appeared as if Mcmahon paid off all of Bret's family to turn against him and he let them all come down to the ring for this match to serve as lumberjacks for what Mcmahon suddenly turned into a No Holds Barred Lumberjack Match. Bret had little involvement as his family pretty much decimated Mcmahon all throughout the match. All Bret really did was attack an already beat up Mcmahon with a chair and of course put Mcmahon in the Sharpshooter. Well, it was nice to see Bret get his long-deserved revenge but this match bombed. *

7. For the World Heavyweight Championship
Champion Chris Jericho VS. Edge
This was a good match which saw the returning Edge take on his former tag partner Chris Jericho for the world title. Both Edge and Jericho put on good performances in this match which was the best match of this night up to this point. Surprisingly, Jericho managed to retain his world title here cleanly but boy did he get it after the match when he tryed to hurt Edge some more and was speared through the barricade! ****

8. Beth Phoenix, Mickie James, Kelly Kelly, Eve Torres, and Gail Kim VS. Michelle Mccool, Vickie Guerrero, Maryse, Alicia Fox, and Layla
THEY PUT THIS TERRIBLE MATCH ON AFTER EDGE AND JERICHO???????? WTF???? *

9. For the WWE World Heavyweight Championship
Champion Batista VS. John Cena
This wasn't really a good match which was surprising since these two had a good match two years earlier at Summerslam 2008. Cena was booed all throughout this match and Batista [despite being the bad guy here] was cheered throughout this match. Well, at least the crowd finally came alive during this match even if it was a forgettable match. Cena wins the WWE title here. **

10. Streak VS. Career
The Undertaker VS. Shawn Michaels
THIS is the match that this Wrestlemania will forever be remembered for. A lot was at stake here in this match as one of two things was gonna happen at the end of this match: Undertaker was finally gonna be defeated at Wrestlemania or Shawn Michaels was gonna retire. A year earlier at Wrestlemania 25 these two wrestled a great match and Shawn Michaels wanted to give beating Undertaker at Wrestlemania another shot which explains the reasons for this rematch. This match was truly epic and unlike any other match on this show, The crowd was fully alive and was truly into this match all the way through. Both of these men truly delivered exciting performances and there was much suspense in this match, especially the fact that Michaels hit the Sweet Chin Music twice on Undertaker and STILL failed to defeat The Undertaker! There was so much excitement in this match and you really do have to see this match in its entirety to really comprehend just how amazing this match really is! This is truly what wrestling is all about right here and if only the rest of this Wrestlemania was anywhere near as epic as this match was, this would've been a five star Wrestlemania. As said before, Somebody was gonna lose something at the end of this match and it turned out to be Shawn Michaels losing his career when he lost to The Undertaker. While it is sad to see Shawn end his career, he definitely went out with a bang!!!! DEFINITELY SEE THIS MATCH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! ***** [BY FAR the best match of the night!]

This Wrestlemania was average at best but it had one hell of a main event. I truly hope that the crowd at Wrestlemania 27 this year will be much more alive than the crowd was here. A watchable wrestlemania that will be truly remembered for the excellent match between Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker. For WWE fans and Wrestlemania collectors this one is reccomended.",1298764800,,6965,4.523431294678316

4081412,5,B0037HERAM,"This in my mind was one of the most epic Wrestlemania's ever because this finally had matches that you could sit through and watch without getting bored or falling asleep and a major improvement in main event matches especially the WWE and World title matches.

Unified Tag Title Match : Big Show and The Miz vs John Morrison and R-Truth - An average way to kick off Wrestlemania 26 but though this was just over 3 minutes it was extremely fast paced and exciting, some great moves but a knock out punch from the Big Show to John Morrison allows The Miz to pin him and retain the Tag Titles. Rating - 6/10

Randy Orton vs Cody Rhodes vs Ted Dibiase - This match featured all 3 former Legacy members going head to head in a surprisingly good match all 3 men put on a great and enjoyable match to watch but at the end Orton RKO's Dibiase and punt kicks Rhodes and pins him for the victory. Rating - 7.5/10

MiTB Ladder Match : Jack Swagger vs Evan Bourne vs Dolph Ziggler vs Shelton Benjamin vs MVP vs Matt Hardy vs Christian vs Drew Mcintyre vs Kane vs Kofi Kingston - Everybody said this was one of the worst MiTB ladder matches ever but i found it extremely good and entertaining and once again Shelton Benjamin and Kofi Kingston stole the show but Evan Bourne also put on an awesome performance. But it was an absolute shocker that Swagger came out on top because i thought that it would be Drew Mcintyre who would have won this match but then again MiTB matches are very unpredicatable. Rating - 8/10

Triple H vs Sheamus - This match saw Sheamus debut at Wrestlemania in one of the best matches of the night and Sheamus finally put on an awesome performance to watch but despite the effort Triple H nails a Pedigree and pins Sheamus for the win on the Grandest Stage of them all. Rating - 8.5/10

Rey Mysterio vs CM Punk (If Mysterio loses he joins the SES) - Wrestlemania always has been home to some of the greatest matches in WWE history and I thought that this match would be one of them but shockingly ended short just before the 7 minute mark which in my mind was extremely dissapointing. But anyway it wasn't what i expected but it still was a good match but if it had been longer it would have been far better but still good performance by both men. Mysterio gets the win after a 619 to Punk and a splash to stand tall at Wrestlemania 26. Rating - 6.5/10

Bret Hart vs Mr. McMahon : No Holds Barred - I actually thought this would be like McMahons previous 'Mania matches against Hulk Hogan and Shawn Michaels but it turned out to be possibly the most boring and dull match in Wrestlemania history. McMahon gets the hell beaten out of him by Bret Hart and The Hart Dynasty and finally Hart locks in the Sharpshooter and McMahon taps out finally allowing Hart to get his revenge. Rating - 2/10 (being generous)

Chris Jericho vs Edge : World Heavyweight Title Match - I remember both these men having an epic Steel Cage match on an edition of Smackdown in 2002 which was the last time these 2 fought one on one and they hoped to redo that awesome match without the cage surrounding them though and they did not dissapoint the WWE Universe at all. The 2 put on an excellent match going back and forth with several breathtaking manuvers. I actually thought that Edge would win this match but Jericho nails 2 codebreakers and finally covers Edge for the extremely hard fought win. But what might have stood out the most from all of that would be the after match spear that sent Jericho through the barricade at ringside. Rating - 9/10

Michelle McCool,Vickie Guerrero,Alicia Fox,Maryse and Layla vs Beth Phoenix,Mickie James,Gail Kim,Kelly Kelly and Eve Torres : 10 Diva Tag Match - Ok I said earlier that Bret Hart vs Mr. McMahon was one of the most boring matches in Wrestlemania history this is the worst. No comment winners Team McCool. Rating - 0.75/10

John Cena vs Batista : WWE Title Match - It was back in Summerslam 2008 which was the last and only time that these 2 met one on one in the ring and ever since then neither man could compete again because Batista lost his title to Chris Jericho in 2008 and couldn't step into Survivor Series to defend his gold against the man he faced in this match John Cena. When Batista turned heel and became one of the most hated superstars in the WWE and then had his sights set on the World title but was unable to gain the gold back but when he entered the Royal Rumble match in January he was eliminated by John Cena which made this rivalry worse because the next night Batista brutalised Cena with a Batista bomb on steel steps. Then at Elimination Chamber Cena survived a brutal chamber match but after the win Mr. McMahon placed Cena in another match against Batista which he won ending Cena's reign.(match reviewed below)

Ok so that explains the rivalry of those 2 and now onto the match. This contest is definetly one of the most memorable in Wrestlemania history not only because they are 2 of the bigeest stars in the WWE but because this was only the second time they had fought. This match was quite the same as their match back at the 2008 Summerslam especially all the signature moves delivered. It mwas an extremely intense contest but several moments stood out such as Batista catching Cena with a huge Batista bomb while Cena was leaping of the top turnbuckle or Cena's massive Five Knuckle Shuffle from the top rope onto Batista. Both men fought a grueling match hitting every move in their arsenal but at the end John Cena makes Batista tap out to the STF claiming his 9th World title. Rating - 8/10

Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels : Streak vs Career Match - Possibly the greatest match in the history of Wrestlemania and definetly the most emotional match ever seen. It was last year at the 25th Anniversary of Wrestlemania where Michaels came so close to finally ending he Streak but Undertaker proved how powerful he really is tombstoning his way to a victory and extending the streak to 17-0. At Wrestlemania 25 their match was just a basic Singles match, this year it was a No Disqualification and No Count-Out match so there were no restrictions to what they do to each other. This was definetly the match of the night and the match of the decade it was also the greatest match i had ever seen. It took 4 tombstone piledrivers to silence Michaels but even though Michaels lost he made a huge impact nailing a death defying moonsault onto the Undertaker who at the time was lying on the announce table causing the Undertaker to scream in pain and also nailing the loudest Sweet Chin Music ever heard in the WWE. But Undertaker was too much for Michaels as 'Taker nailed the 4th and final tombstone to pick up the win and extend the streak to 18-0 and ending HBK's career. Rating - 100/10

Overall i give this show out of 100 i give it an amazing 86/100 because of all the awesome matches delivered at this amazing Wrestlemania and i also praise the improvement in World title matches I haven't seen World title matches this good since Wrestlemania 23 (Undertaker vs Batista and John Cena vs Shawn Michaels). Anyway an epic show and thanks for reading this hope to hear on your feedback. Please send any comments to mishalwwechamp@hotmail.com thank you.",1276732800,13,7232,4.487082066869301
4081413,3,B0037HERAM,"The best match on the card was HBK-UnderTaker. The worst matches were the Bret Hart-McMahon which was awful & very disappointing as a Ed Wood film and the 10-Diva tag team match which was thoughtless,totally botch-ridden & just as bad as WWE's Raw Bowl back in 1996. The Unified WWE Tag Team Champioship match while a solid match it was also uninspiring. The 10 way Money In The Bank Ladder Match was very cluttered & almost as cluttered as the 40 man battle royal they had back in 1992. The rest were ok. I give this event a 7 and a half out of 10.",1276646400,,549,4.238095238095238

The first pay per view I didn't have to pay for in forever was a really fun one, especially since I didn't pay for it. In case you are wondering my brother paid for this one because his favorite of all time Bret Hart returned, so of course I let him pay.

DISC 1

1.[TAG TITLES] BIG SHOW & MIZ VS JOHN MORRISON & R TRUTH-the first match of the night is actually really quick, I thought the opening bout would be a bit longer but ok. Since it was short the action was good with a lot of high spots and high impact moves. I had a feeling going into this that the title was not going to change hands, and I was right. This was good opening match, I love looking out at the crowd in this match, for some reason it felt like old school WrestleMania but it was just to short. 3.5/5

2.[TRIPLE THREAT] RANDY ORTON VS CODY RHODES VS TED DIBIASE-this one right here is actually one of my favorites on the entire card. This mach is actually more technical than one might think, really go back and watch it. And I am not just talking about the actual wrestling but also the story telling. The action is excellent and I love in the beginning when then are tearing Orton up literally bit by bit. Also they call Orton the viper and it fits because he moves like a snake, check his mannerisms. This is an excellent match that I really enjoy. 4/5

3.[MONEY IN THE BANK LADDER MATCH] KOFI KINGSTON VS MVP VS EVAN BOURNE VSJACK SWAGGER VS SHELTON BENJAMIN VS MATT HARDY VS DOLPH ZIGGLER VS DREW MCINTYRE VS KANE VS CHRISTIAN-now I am a huge fan of this match and every year I look forward to it more so than any other most of the time. And each year it is an excellent match and continues to do so this time. But with that said I would have to say this one while good was not one of the best. Of course there was a lot of action and some high spots so of course it was very entertaining. But to my surprise Jack Swagger takes this one, another year my boy Shelton was screwed. 4/5

4. TRIPLE H VS SHEAMUS-I have to admit I am a fan of Sheamus and love that he won the title, I have always like the heels a lot more so than the baby faces. The lead into this match was an excellent one and I love the line ""this warrior bows to no king"". This match had that old school feel to it and that only added to the story of the match. The match its self was a great one with both pulling off all kinds of stuff. I actually thought it was over at certain times but they kept kicking out. That is until Triple H finished him off and walked out once again at Mania victorious. 3.8/5

5. REY MYSTERIO VS CM PUNK-another great match that pits two of the best in the company against each other. Punk dominates a lot of the match as Ray plays the small underdog really well. There are some great high spots and outside interference but Rey fights back like a classic smaller underdog. Rey takes the win in this one and saves him self from joining the Straight Edge Society. 3.8/5

6.[NO HOLDS BARRED] BRET HART VS MR. MCMAHON-this was one of the biggest moments I can remember and was the highlight of the night for my brother who was going nuts when Bret walked out. You see my brother like every one else knows that wrestling is fake [well you know what I mean the real danger is there as is the athletic ability and such, these guys never get enough real credit] but when Bret came back on Raw he said the same thing he said this night week after week ""quite, REALITY is happening right now"". I could not wait to see this match because I missed them old days with Bret, but I also knew because of his past injuries he was limited. Of course my bro hates Vince for what he did to Bret and was going crazy when Vince brought out Bret's family to screw him over again. Of course he was cheering loudly when the double cross happened, Vince's face was priceless. And from the first punch on my bro was the loudest, and to be honest I was close to that volume. To me this was the perfect match between these two. It was a beat down and Vince never once had any offense of his own, the way it should have been. The past between these two lead to this beat down on Vince and I think it was the right thing for Bret's return. After his strokes and such and now being limited it was the perfect match between him and Vince. Plus who does not love that Sharpshooter we all wanted to see, to me this is a CLASSIC and those chair shots were vicious. 5/5

7.[WORLD TITLE] CHRIS JERICHO VS EDGE-now this has nothing to do with me being a Jerichoholic but I can't stand when the champ comes out first. The challenger is supposed to enter first followed by the champ. This was for Jericho's title and he was looking to keep it while Edge wanted it more than anything. The big thing about this was that Edge had speared Chris every week prior to this. Naturally when you get two of the best in there you will get a great match. Back and forth with a lot of near falls including a code breaker off of the spear. Jericho keeps the belt but still eats a spear. 4/5

8.[10 DIVA TAG] MICKIE JAMES, KELLY KELLY, EVE, GAIL KIM, BETH PHOENIX VS MICHELLE MCCOOL, MARYSE, LAYLA, ALICIA FOX, VICKIE GUERRERO-of course this is the worst match on the card but that is ok because it is short and sweet and by sweet I mean the ladies. Each one gets their spot in with their finisher and such with only maybe two of these women actually being real wrestlers and not just eye candy. One of those two is Beth and I will let you guess on the other one, I wish the WWE took the women's division as serious as TNA does unlike the last tag match I' am thankful this is short. 2.5/5

DISC 2

1.[WWE TITLE] BATISTA VS JOHN CENA-once again the champ comes out first and I will never understand why that is, although Cena's entrance as normal is great. Now I will admit that I am a fan of Cena and always have been, I wish he would go heel again, and Batista is so much better as a heel in my opinion. I knew that on this stage these two would deliver a great match especially for these two. Of course I was right and the match was actually suspense full at points and you could see the crowd was really into this one. The action was good with near fall after near fall that eventually went to Cena winning the match. I thought this was a really good match and worthy of being on this card. 4/5

2.[STREAK VS CAREER] UNDERTAKER VS SHAWN MICHAELS-the match I was waiting for the most since Shawn is my all time favorite and I wanted him to beat Taker so bad. Of course every one was right there with me but they all thought there was no way Taker was going to lose his streak even if they wanted HBK to win. Much like my brother said earlier with Bret's match but to me reality was taking place in that ring. It was because I knew that if Shawn lost he really was retiring, it was not part of a storyline. While I did not know the out come yet I did know it would be match of the night and would live up to last years match. This has got to be one of the most dramatic matches ever as the fans just stood up and were in awe of these two legends. There were so many near falls and close calls it was incredible. The memorable moments happened throughout the match including a great moonsault from Shawn. The ending of this match is absolutely perfect with Shawn giving Taker the throat slash so that he could be finished off like a warrior. Taker giving him respect at the end and the crowd reaction afterwards was great. 5/5

BONUS

3.26 MAN BATTLE ROYAL-this like any other battle royal is of course fun and very entertaining. I have always liked battle royals as has my brother and can't help but sit and enjoy every time we see one. There are plenty of guys in this one and it does not take long for guys to be eliminated at all. The action is quick as always in these kinds of matches but easy enough to watch, Yoshi Tatsu ends up winning this one. 4/5

The following matches are bonus bouts that feature some of the HOF members from this year. It is because of that I have decided not to review the matches, these matches are tributes and I don't want to put a rating on that.

  2-randy orton vs ted dibiase 2 vs cody rhodes---this match was ok.it went as expected.but anything was better than match 1.[6 out of 10 stars]
  3-money in the bank ladder match.kofi kingston vs mvp vs evan bourne vs jack swagger vs shelton benjamen vs matt hardy vs dolph ziggler vs drew mcentire vs kane vs christian--------this was easily the best match on the dvd.it started out like a battle royal.this quickly spilled to the floor as well.there were an abundance of crazy moves,bumps, high spots etc.and YES there were in fact new innovations that have never been performed in a ladder match before.this match was totaly awesome![a perfect 10]
  4-triple h vs sheamus-----i may be the only one who likes sheamus but he is my favorite wrestler in the wwe.this was a classic match.it was  physicaly brutal.it went back and forth many times.it was great! whats more is they didn't simply go through the motions as is all too common these days.they really poured thier hearts into it.[8 out of 10].
  5-rey jr vs cm punk----i was disappointed by this one.it was quick and without the high spots we expect out of rey.i wanted to see him fly.i wanted him to yet again boggle my mind with his mastery of physics in the ring.this match was about as good as anything you'd see on raw.[6 out of 10].
  6-hitman vs vince------this one took a while to get started.i was expecting a brawl all over the building and massive blood shed and someone jumping off the titantron.then i remembered these guys are as old as cave men.for lack of a better word this was a spanking.in this match there were the most consecutive chair shots ive ever seen in a match in my life[just under 34 years].[6 out of 10 due to lack of an actual match but up to 6 because of the sheer brutality involved]
  7-chris jericho vs edge-----edge won the royal rumble to get this match.i thought he was a shoe in.these guys were battling over the world title.there are 4 super wrestling places on earth.they are canada,japan,mexico and america.i think pitting 2 canadian guys against eachother at wwe's biggest event is like saying that canadian wrestlers are as good as americas.thats just bad buisness,true or not.edge crawled around the whole time on his injured achilles tendon.if he wasn't ready he shouldve stayed home.[5 out of 10]
  8-mickie james/kelly/eve/gail kim/ and beth phoenix vs michelle mc cool/maryse/layla/alicia fox/and vickie guierro-----i was expecting an elongated ,erotic pile of ultimately sexy babes[except that cow vickie] rolling around and fueling my fantasies until next wrestlemania.well NO!basicly every diva ran in,nailed thier move and then it was over.it was really really sexy but only for a minute or 2.thats probably what would happen if i ever scored with one of them[LOL!][7 out of 10 stars]
  9-batista vs john cena-----i figured this would be a walk through but these 2 really gave it all they had.[7 out of 10]
  10-undertaker vs shawn michaels----the big rematch from last year.at first,shawn tried to hurt any part of undertaker he could.he definately hit him with everything.then the match started looking like last years match with each of them going for thier finishers over and over and over.the they hit them over and over.neither guy would quit.if you watch raw,you know the outcome anyhow.this match was great! it was way better than thier 1st encounter.the only thing that held this match back was the fact that it was win by pin or submission only.that meant that couldve spilled buckets of blood for us.[8 of 10 stars].
  so,averaged out that is a 6.8 but don't let the miz or edge's poor performances  stop you from buying this dvd.it was one of if not THE best wrestlemania ever.if you love wrestling,this ones for you!",1275523200,,4248,4.795610425240055

The Big Show and The Miz vs. John Morrision and R-Truth for the Unified Tag Team Titles- I have to say while I was happy to see that the WWE decided to put the tag team titles as a match on the card for Wrestlemania I was no so happy to see that it was given as a 5 minute through away match on PPV. One thing that TNA will have on WWE for awhile is they care about there tag teams and they build them up unlike WWE. While this match was not the worst thing I have ever seen it was not treated with a lot of respect as it was only given 5 minutes of match time. Overall nothing offensive but nothing to write home about one watch of this match is all it needs. Winners and still WWE Unified Tag Team Champions The Big Show and The Miz. Match Rating 3/10.
2. Randy Orton vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Ted DiBaise in a triple threat match- This match was essentially the match that showed the falling out of the group known as legacy. They had been feuding for awhile and while it was called a triple threat match it was essentially a handicap match against Orton. The crowd from the beginning was behind Orton and that would not change throughout the match. While this was a solid match wrestling wise it kind of buried Rhodes and DiBiaise as it showed they could both not beat Orton even with a one man advantage. One of the sickest parts of the match was when Randy Orton did the double DDT on both Rhodes and DiBaise as the crowd went crazy for that. Overall a solid match and one worth a watch. Winner Randy Orton. Match Rating 7/10.
3. Kofi Kingston vs. MVP vs. Evan Bourne vs. Jack Swagger vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Matt Hardy vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Drew McIntyre vs. Kane vs. Christian in a Money In The Bank Ladder Match- I would say out of all of the money in the bank matches I have seen at Wrestlemania this ranks up there as either me least favorite or second least favorite right near the one in 2006 that had Bobby Lashley and Ric Flair in it. This is not to say that this was a bad match at all in fact it was a really good match but you didn't see the high flying action spots as much as you have seen in the others. Or should I say the spots were not as good. I think the PG rating is hurting WWE as it limits them on what they can do in matches like these because they do not want them to become to violent for the kids. There were some cool spots in this match including a reverse DDT from the top of the ladder. Overall a good match and a surprising ending that you might not have seen coming. Winner and Mr. Money in the Bank Jack Swagger. Match Rating 8.5/10.
4. HHH vs. Sheamus- I will say this was the first match in a long time probably since HHH faced off against Jeff Hardy that he was able to put someone over. The word backstage for awhile is that Sheamus and HHH are close friends but regardless this was huge of HHH to give him this much recognition early into his career. While HHH still won the match in was Sheamus who ultimately came out on top looking better. He survived a lot of near falls by the game and was able to control most of the match. Also this is credit to HHH and Sheamus as the match was rather entertaining from the aspect of wrestling. A very mat based wrestling match with not a lot of outside action. Overall solid match between these two. Winner HHH. Match Rating 6.5/10.
5. Rey Mysterio vs. CM Punk- This right here had potential to be match of the night. Once again the problem here was they were not given enough time for this match to develop. For a storyline that was given a lot of attention and airtime this match should have been given more time. The match was given about 7 minutes total and if you are able to cut out the divas match you would be able to give this match an easy 14 minutes. The match was very fast pace as they had to cram everything into this match in 7 minutes that they could. Told a very good story between these two and it will be nice to see were these feuds will go from here. Winner Rey Mysterio. Match Rating 7/10.
6. Bret Hit Man Hart vs. Mr. McMahon in a No Holds Barred Match- Boy out of all the matches on this card this had to be the most disappointing out of all of them. Yes it was better than the divas match but at the same time for the amount of time they gave this on TV and the history behind this feud this match was done so poorly. I realize Bret Hart now can wrestle anymore at all but then why book this feud and mach in the first place as its only going to let down there fans in the process. I had a feeling that because they had put so much into this feud it would be another Bloody match similar to the one the Hogan and McMahon had at Wrestlemania 19. This was no were near it and the lumberjacks on the outside of the ring probably did half as much as Bret did in the wrestling match. It was nice to see Bret back in the ring and I am not condoning Bret to wrestle when he cant but the WWE should have not booked this match then. Winner Bret Hit Man Hart. Match Rating 2/10.
7. Chirs Jericho vs. Edge for the World Heavyweight Championship-Looking at this match on paper you might think right away that Edge was the bad guy in this match but that was not the case on this night. Since Edge returned from the rumble he had become a face and while I feel he has not been the best face he did a good job working this match with Chris Jericho. This was Smackdowns main event and it was on par with Raw's main event when it comes to entertainment. Jericho and Edge if you are talking from a wrestling standpoint might be 2 of he greatest in the WWE today. There were counter after counter including an attempted spear by Edge into a code breaker by Chris Jericho. Both these men put on an entertaining match and I was fine with the end of it. Also after the match Edge spears Jericho through the barricade which was pretty cool. Winner and still World Heavyweight Champion Chris Jericho. Mach Rating 8.5/10.
8. Mickie James, Kelly Kelly, Eve, Gail Kim, and Beth Phoenix vs. Michelle McCool, Maryse, Layla Alicia Fox, and Vickie Guerrero in a 10 Diva Tag Team Match- There is not a lot to say about this match except question why was this match on the card. There was no point for this match except to show the fans the divas live. The wresting was awful there was not storyline and it just wasted more time that a match like Rey vs. Punk could have had. The highlight of the match was when Vickie Guerrero paid tribute to her deceased husband Eddie Guerrero with a bad Frog Splash but that was a heartfelt moment. Winners Michelle McCool, Maryse, Layla Alicia Fox, and Vickie Guerrero. Match Rating Not Rated.
9. Batisita vs. John Cena for the WWE Championship- If you would have asked me a couple of months ago if I would have liked to see this match at Wrestlemania in the semi main event I would have easily said no. But since Batisita has turned heel there is something about him that makes him cooler and I have also enjoyed his wrestling style more. This match here was a great match and it told one of the best stories that WWE has had in a while. Both of these men came into the WWE at the same time in 2002 and both their careers took off at Wrestlemania 21. The match itself when it comes to wrestling was very hard hitting and full of near falls. The crowd was really into this match as well which helped it progress again. I feel that Batisita should not have lost this match with only one month into his title reign but if you are talking about match quality this match was there and it was close to my match of the night. Winner and new WWE Champion John Cena. Match Rating 9/10.
10. Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels Career vs. Streak Match- This match aculty took place last year at Wrestlemania 25 and was considered a match of the year candidate. While I felt this year's match was not as good as last year's this was still easily the best match of the night. Something about Shawn Michaels and Undertaker show they have good chemistry. One of the complaints that you will hear from this match was there were way to many near falls. While I do agree with that when you consider what is on the line here it adds to the story that both men will go to any length not to lose this match. The sickest part of the match without question would have to be near the end of the match when Shawn Michaels super kicked Undertaker on the table and then did a moonsault off the top rope through the table. Back and forth match but another funny yet telling moment of the match was when the Undertaker was telling Shawn to stay down he wouldn't and mocked the Undertaker. Who responded by Tomb stoning Shawn to end the match. Winner The Undertaker. Match Rating 10/10.

Overall I would sum up Wrestlemania 26 as being a mixed bag. I do feel it delivered more good stuff then bad stuff. I would give it a grade of 61.5/90 which is a 68% which means this was a good PPV. I would say this is about right while you had 3 really good matches that were worth your pay the undercard was not there. Even the Money in the Bank match was not as good as years past. Also the stuff like Vince vs. Bret and Rey vs. Punk were very poorly done for an event like Wrestlemania. Overall I cant complain to much and they $20 for this DVD were much worth the money.",1273622400,,9311,4.1837416481069045
4081419,5,B0037HERAM,"Well after a significant time off, I have returned to post a another review with this one being WrestleMania 26. This event was hosted at the University of Phoenix Stadium with an attendance record of 72,219 as not only was history made & titles were defended but also brought closure to two sets of feuds. Just to add a few notes, this was the first time since WM XII that I can remember that Jim Ross didn't do any commentary for this show & for me, was certainly missed in action but let us not get the facts get in the way of a good story.

Unified Tag Team Champions Big Show & The Miz vs John Morrison & R-Truth. For the first time since WM 22, the tag team titles are actually defended at the biggest stage of them all. I wouldn't classify this as a good opener because the match was too short for it to be anything memorable but there was some good moments with Big Show coming out looking stronger (literally & figuratively) than everyone else.

Randy Orton vs Ted Dibiase vs Cody Rhodes. The break-up of Legacy & this match played out exactly how everyone predicted it would with Dibiase & Rhodes actually turning this match into a handicap match by constantly double-teaming Orton with Orton getting a flurry here & there. However, the match would quickly turn once Dibiase & Rhodes just got too greedy for their own good allowing Orton to take advantage with his trademark ""punt"" much to the delight of the crowd, who was ""pro-Orton"" throughout the contest.

Now, I don't normally focus on backstage skits but there was a skit that occurred during Vickie Guerrero's interview involving Santino, Mean Gene, Mae Young & Melina that I just enjoyed & thought that it was well done.

""Money In The Bank"" Ladder Match: Jack Swagger vs Christian vs Dolph Ziggler vs Shelton Benjamin vs Drew McIntrye vs Matt Hardy vs M.V.P. vs Evan Bourne vs Kofi Kingston vs Kane. This is the biggest (literally) MIB match that has been done to date due to this one having the most people in it since the match debuted. As is the case with this match every year, this match had plenty of moments like Christian delivering a monkey-flip onto Kofi to a ladder with guys behind it, Kane destroying the ladder & Drew McIntrye, Evan's ""shooting star press"" along with taking the worst fall of the match later on, Kofi using a broken ladder in a way that you have to see believe, Christian's reverse DDT from the top of the ladder to Matt Hardy, Matt getting knocked off the ladder onto another one, and the sequence of Swagger getting crushed in between two ladders while Christian, Hardy & Evan climbed to the top. It wasn't the best one that they did but this was still an entertaining match that delivered when it came to spots.

Triple H vs Sheamus. Sheamus made his WM debut against the man that he choose to face in Triple H while this is the first time since WM 15 that Triple H is not in a high-profile main event at WrestleMania. I can honestly say that I am not a big fan of Sheamus but he certainly held his own here as he told a good story in making every move count against Triple H as if he was a veteran (when he is still a rookie) before it was one mistake that allowed Triple H to get back in the game (no pun intended). This was a solid match that actually made me enjoy seeing Sheamus as an in-ring competitor.

Rey Mysterio vs CM Punk. The stipulation to this match was that if Rey loses, he must join ""The Straight Edge Society"". I do want to point out that Mysterio's ""Avatar"" look heavily makes up for his ""Joker"" attempt that felt flat in my eyes the year before. These two didn't get so much time to tell a story like their previous Armageddon match but with the time that they had, they didn't disappoint here. With Luke Gallows & Serena getting involved at times, this was an exciting fast paced contest that made me wish these two got more time but it certainly didn't leave me disappointed with the quality.

No Holds Barred: Bret Hart vs Vince McMahon. Bret Hart returns to WrestleMania for the first time since his classic submission match with Steve Austin at WrestleMania 13. Before the match got started, Vince McMahon brought out the Hart Family stating that he had purchased their services for them to be Lumberjacks for this match only to be revealed that Bret was in on the whole scheme. This match was really all about the story of Bret getting his revenge as fans shouldn't have expected Bret to give a quality performance at this stage in his career. Basically, the Hart Dynasty was there to do the impact spots including doing an old finisher from the Hart Foundation days on the outside of the ring before Bret beat Vince down with a chair & doing one last Sharpshooter to bring this issue to conclusion.

World Champion Chris Jericho vs Edge. After years of these two battling & having ""on/off"" feuds over the years, this was their first high profile singles match & how appropriate that it was at WrestleMania for the World Championship. This was a pure ""old school"" wrestling match that was never fought at a fast pace as it allowed each man to look strong & building up the suspense towards the end with a good story being told with Jericho attacking Edge's injury & even using many counters to avoid the spear. The ending was a surprise since it not only ended clean but the winner was actually a surprise. However, pay attention to the aftermath as Edge got his revenge that he vowed to get in a way that you will not believe.

Michelle McCool, Layla, Maryse, Alicia Fox & Vickie Guerrero vs Mickie James, Kelly Kelly, Eve Torres, Gail Kim & Beth Phoenix. This is one of those matches that you are either going to like or hate depending on how you choose to look at it as this match was real short with everyone just doing their finishers but I will say that I actually found this to be funny as I couldn't stop laughing at Vickie Guerrero whether she was getting beat up or just hiding. On a personal note though, I did enjoy seeing Vickie pay homage to her late husband Eddie Guerrero before doing what was called a ""Bullfrog/Hog"" splash & doing a sloppy pinfall.

WWE Champion Batista vs John Cena. Just like how I was shocked that their SummerSlam '08 match turned out to be really good considering that I am not a huge fan of either man, this match delivered as these two men worked well together. They exchanged power moves along with some surprising grappling counters with Batista focusing on Cena's neck in the early stages of the match before Cena gained momentum before both men began dishing out their trademark moves along with counters that were similiar to their previous clash & others that we haven't seen before. This match delivered more than I expected & I would call this Cena's best WM match along with this being one of Batista's best performances as well. And just like the last title match, the aftermath where Cena addressed the fans with the ""WE HATE CENA"" shirts was a sight to see.

Streak vs Career: The Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels. Taker's streak against HBK's career & hats off to WWE as for the first time since WrestleMania XI, a non-title match is headlined as the main event but I am pretty sure that most fans were looking forward to this match more than anything else on the card. These two deserved to go last after putting up not only an instant classic last year but also the match of the year of 2009. Despite that, this match once again lived up to the hype as they put on another classic match that was actually more aggressive & physical than their previous classic a year ago. This match had many moments like HBK doing Taker's classic ""throat slash"" at the start, Taker delivering the tombstone on the floor, Shawn hitting three ""Sweet Chin Musics"", Taker's ""Last Ride"", Shawn doing an unbelievable moonsault through the announce table that just got the fans on their feet & kept them there till the end of the match with chants of ""THIS IS AWESOME"". But the biggest moment of the match was near the end where Taker showed more emotion than is expected from him before Shawn wouldn't let this end without a fight that lead to the most impactful tombstone that we have seen in years. Once again just like the previous matches, the aftermath was something as new & emotional WrestleMania moment was created that will never be forgotten.

Now from what I have heard/seen, there are three versions of this event (two on DVD & one on Blue-Ray). I got the ""Collector's Edition"" so with this event you get the pre-show WrestleMania Battle Royal along with the entire Hall Of Fame ceremony with new inductees Maurice ""Mad Dog"" Vachon, Wendi Richter, Stu Hart, Antonio Inoki, Bob Uecker, ""Gorgeous"" George & ""Million Dollar Man"" Ted Dibiase but also with that you get matches & moments involving these inductees including Dibiase's favorite WM match vs Jake Roberts (WrestleMania VI), Antonio Inoki's Japanese Heavyweight Championship match vs The Great Hossein, Wendi Richter's Women's Championship match vs The Fabulous Moolah, Stu Hart tribute & two matches involving ""Gorgeous"" George & ""Mad Dog"" Vachon. Unfortunately, Shawn Michaels's farewell address is not included on the DVD set.

Overall, this was one of the best WrestleManias that the WWE has put out in recent years. It wasn't perfect but this heavily made up & surpassed the disappointment of the previous years WrestleMania so I would give this WrestleMania a solid 4 star rating but with the Hall Of Fame ceremony, the battle royal & the extra matches makes this a 5 star showcase that I would recommend to any wrestling fan, not just a WWE Fan.",1273276800,17,9584,4.565116279069767
4081420,5,B0037HERAM,"If you are planning to buy WWE Wrestle Mania 26 dvd then the collector's edition dvd pack is the only one you should get largely because it is this collectors edition that has the FULL UNEDITED HALL OF FAME CEREMONY where as the other versions all have a shorter, edited version of that ceremony. Other than that the collectors edition also has the Raw and Smackdown shows in full after WM26 + some great matches of the Hall of Fame inductees and the Wm 26 battle royal which was not shown on ppv.

This dvd pack is priced the same as the normal edition so why spend money on something that doesnt offer any significant value when for nearly the same price, you can get a collectors edition pack with all the value able freebies.",1271635200,29,729,4.4
4081421,2,B0037HERAM,"Like a lot of people, I was psyched to know this years WrestleMania would see the return of Bret Hart to finish what started 12 years ago with Vince McMahon, and also, what could be the last match ever of Shawn Micheal's.

As the night kicked off, something just didn't seem right. Sure, there was fireworks and what-not, but for the biggest grand-daddy event in Wrestling, it just did not feel like it was party time, especially when the intro show finished, the first match went under way. I dunno, maybe some might like it that way by just kicking off straight into the first match, but Wrestlemania's intro's to me where what built up the matches, ya know, an intro of what matches are to be expected, who is in attendance, and a few other things for a minute or two?

Quite frankly I was bored until the 3rd match. That ""money in the bank"" event; There was some decent entertainment in it, some Holey F moves, but compared to what these superstars are capable of, it turned out to just be a 3 out of 5 stars match in the end with hardly anything memorable about it to walk away with.

Next up was Shamus Vs Triple-H. Shamus surprised me by having a decent match for his Wrestlemania debut, it was one of the better matches on the card of the night. I really didn't expect someone so new to the company to put on a show like this, but I now have a lot more respect for Fanta pubes.

CM Punk's current gimmick (to this show) is not worthy of Wrestlemania status. Being up against Rey Mysterio is never a boring match, but they really need to give CM Punk a gimmick people could give a rats about. His intro of ""I'm here to save you, I don't do drugs, I'm better then you"" is just completely stupid and really took away from what could have been a much better match on both participants account. However the end of the match was really nicely worked out.

Then the one so many of us where waiting for. Bret Hart returning to the ring for the last time to face the chairman, Vinnie Mac... and what a disappointment. I could not believe the boring promo the match got before it went underway. It needed one of those action promos that builds up the suspense of the match that was later reserved for Edge and Jericho. Instead, we see a boring song and a few flash-backs, with little dialog to accompany any build up. Since Bret first came back on the first Raw of 2010, the whole premise of the thing was looking promising, and had the promo built up the anticipation a bit better, it may have gotten off to a better start.
Vince's entrance was not done the way it could have been done to make it even better, the whole idea of ""buying off"" certain participants and then 2 seconds later, ""Nah, we're not bought off"" was timed completely wrong and seemed like a stupid decision or a complete, ""who come up with that stinking idea?"" moment.
If they needed an angle on how Vince was supposed to get to the ring with the whole Hart family surrounding the ring already. then what it NEEDED was an appearance from 'the heartbreak kid' not letting Vince walk away from the match and either forcing him to walk into the hands of the Hart Foundation or just delivering sweet chin music into their arms and then throwing Vince into the ring to get it underway. That would have really made the thing come full circle and HBK would be totally redeemed from the Montreal thing (story-wise anyway) But oh well, what can we do?
So when the match did get underway... it was a complete snore fest. You can see Bret still knows how to work a crowed and keep them waiting for him to lock in the sharpshooter, but quite frankly, the thing could have been worked out so much better then it was. You can even hear the crowed is just not booing from boredom out of respect for it being Bret's last match, but even they know it wasn't the match it could have been.

Next up Jericho and Edge... I couldn't even be bothered to watch this, I came back when I heard the bell ring then they announced the Divas where up next, and I went to trim my nose hairs while it was on... then Cena and Batista are announced, so I continued entertaining myself by burning down a wax candle and making little doodles out of it.

Finally the main event. The Undertaker Vs Shawn Micheals.
So I stopped de-fleaing my cat and decided to watch this match.
In all honesty, it didn't seem as good as the previous years match. But it was definitely one of the better matches of the card. With both legends of Taker and HBK, how can you go wrong? I think the only thing I did not appreciate about the match was the crowed reaction to HBK after the match to bid a final farewell... and I don't mean they saw it out-of-character, or didn't respect Micheals, I mean the crowed I think just did not believe that this really was the last match for the Heartbreak Kid. You do hear a few chants of ""thank you Shawn"" for those who knew it really was the end... but I don't think the majority of the fans realize it really is the end of the Show Stoppa... again, the promoting of the thing needed to really sell this point, not focus so much on if someone can finally defeat The Undertaker or not?

Hopefully when the DVD comes out, it will have some decent bonus material to aid the end of an era for Shawn and Bret. But overall, the PPV event itself just did not seem to be played out as well as it could have been. Wrestlemania means more then just wrestling, it's a week long event, it's supposed to be unforgettable. But correct me if I'm wrong, was there even a theme to this years Wrestlemania? At least last year AC/DC and Kid Rock echoed through the place, and what was this years? There was no live band, special guests in the audience, and Jim Ross' commentary was sincerely missed. It just seemed like a normal average PPV in a bigger stadium then normal for the WWE. You can rate me low for my reasons if you want, but i'm just being honest.",1271548800,,5894,4.308385933273219
4081422,5,B0037HERAM,"WM26 was better than last year's. The only reason to watch last year's was Taker/HBK. This year had that again & more. A lot of the younger talent got a chance to shine & I commend WWE for allowing them the opportunity to do just that.

The production was top notch. You can't ask for anything better really/ This is always the case for their top ppvs. especially Royal Rumble and even more so, WM and rightfully so. The production team does not get the credit they so truly deserve. Hopefully, at least of nothing else, they get the right salary.

The opening was awesome. I loved it. It was amazing and a real treat to see.

Morrison/Truth vs Show/Miz - A short match, but a good one. It's the opener & to me, it did what it was supposed to do: get the crowd pumped. An argument could be made I guess as to how such a short match could get the crowd pumped up. But I, for one, believe they did that. Show/Miz, though not my 2 favorite wrestlers, are becoming a solid team enough & I believe with time, the same will happen with Morrison/Truth should they remain a combination.

Orton vs Rhodes vs Dibiase - Unlike 2004, Orton was slowly built up as a face, which works BEST. What I really like about is, despite being cheered and a face, he isn't doing anything new. I guess people just got into his Viper/Apex Predator persona??? I love it a lot. Reminds me of Undertaker. Or maybe it's because he's feuding with Legacy. I figure it's the latter, but could be both too. I enjoyed this match, though I wish a rematch was made for Extreme Rules.

MITB - A 10 Man MITB Ladder Match. It was very cluttered. However, it was enjoyable though not as great as WM21, WM23, WM24, which in my opinion, were the best ones. A MITB ppv is coming up this year so if this is the last WM MITB, I guess they wanted it to go out with a bang. However, they could've given more time, given each guy a chance to really shine and showcase what they can do, rather than have 10 men in there. Swagger, McIntyre, it is their Wm debuts and first ladder match. They shouldn't have been in there in my opinion. I do like Kane's new attire, but attire means nothing of you aren't gonna be given a chance to shine. Many think Kane sucks because he lost the mask. It's not that. It's because they turned him into a jobber. If I were Kane, I would've left. They make him job, put him is some of the worst storylines/angles, never give him a decent title run. Surely, he deserves a lot better than this. But there were some awesome spots here. I won't name them as I don't wanna give them away.

HHH vs Sheamus - Better than I expected. I knew HHH would win because as long as he's active, he will have a win reserved for him at WM. For a change though, he wasn't in the main event & shouldn't have been there last year either. Sheamus should've won. He has more years left than HHH. Does he deserve the win? I don't know. But HHH didn't need the win either. Hopefully, at Extreme Rules, HHH will lose.

Rey Mysterio vs CM Punk (If Rey loses, he must join SES) - I love the heel Punk, especially his promos. He & Jericho are the best heels in WWE right now. Edge & Orton were too, but they're faces now. I must comment Rey's daughter. What an amazing acting talent this young female has. She made me feel sorry and compassionate. I felt sympathy to the point of almost shedding tears. People in the crowd became emotional. Punk singing Happy Birthday was creepy, eerie, and JUST PERFECT for his heel persona, as it attracted SO MUCH HEAT and HATE for him. As for the match, not as long as it should've been, which is why they didn't shine or gel as good as they could've. Hopefully at Extreme Rules, that will change.

Bret vs Vince - BRET HART RETURNS! Yes I know he returned on Jan. 4 & has been there since for the most part, but he returned at WM for the first time since 1997, WM13, 13 years ago. The match wasn't a five star classic. But can you expect it to be? Anyone with brains would say no, considering Bret's physical limitations. But they got what they waited 13 years for: THE SHARPSHOOTER ON VINCENT KENNEDY MCMAHON! And that, for me, is enough.

Edge vs Jericho for the WHC - These two did not have the last match and for good reason. However they should've been on before that considering the Rumble winner, Edge was in it, they're much better workers than Cena/Batista & had a longer buildup/hype then them. I enjoyed this more than Cena/Batista. The Spear through the table was awesome. But knowing Jericho, he will somehow, someway, get his revenge for that & this feud I believe, will continue until WWE feels it's time to move on. I don't think they feel that way just yet though.

Divas Match - Not rating. The time that was used here (and the Bret/Vince & HHH/Sheeamus matches which went a bit too long for me) could have been given to Rey/Punk, tag team title opener, maybe MITB too.

Cena vs Batista for the WWE Title - The WWE Title has become a joke since 2005's Spinner version, which is still used. I mean really. It should have been changed a long time ago. Why it's still a spinner, I will never understand that. Cena/Batista had a great encounter at SSlam 08. Is this better than that, less better, or the same? I'd say SSlam was slightly better, though I'm not sure why. However, this was still better than I expected so I will commend them for it. Batista turning heel was the best thing he's done since his 2007 year long feud with UT.

The Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels in a No Holds Barred ""Streak vs Career"" Match - Well here it is. The match everyone was waiting to see. Could they top WM25? I wasn't looking for them to top WM25. Wm25 will go down as a classic encounter in a class all by itself. I don't believe WWE were looking to top that match, which is why all these new stipulations were added. That's just one wrestling fan's opinion. It wasn't as long as last year's. But the length does not matter at all. It was as GREAT as last year's, despite being shorter than that (though not by much). Like WM25, my only complaint is the kick outs of finishers. It's called a FINISHer because it is supposed to FINISH a match. FINISHers have become pretty much a thing of the past because these days, everyone is kicking out of everyone's FINISHers. I understand this is WM. Had it not been done so often though, I would mid one bit of they kicked out of FINISHers at WM. WM, IF anytime at all, is THE ONLY TIME & PLACE for that. Shockingly to me, there have been more kickouts from the Tombstone than the Sweet Chin Music, RKO, Pedigree, Attitude Adjustment, Batista Bomb, Kane's Chokeslam. It's shocking because of the name, TOmbstone, the many bodies it laid to rest over Taker's 20 yrs in WWE. It was built up as THE FINISHER. JBL said Taker was THE BEST FINISHER in WWE history & he is. If not the best, the most certainly, one of the best. Anyways, I'm sorry for getting off topic here. The WM26 match will go down as the Match Of The Night and quite possibly, the Match Of The Year & probably the Most Extreme or Shocking Moment Of The Year because of it's aftermath. Taker is 18-0 and wins with a very rare JUMPING TOMBSTONE PILEDRIVER to seal HBK's fate & lay his amazing, illustrious, HOF, legendary career to eternal rest. If this is HBK's last match ever, he nor anyone else has anything to be ashamed of because he went out in a BLAZE OF GLORY. Sometimes, a winner is determined in other ways. You don't have to win to be a winner. HBK proved that at WM26 & Flair did at WM24. I, for one, feel that HBK's true last match will be against HHH somewhere down the line, though def not anytime soon. As for Taker, he will go out 20-0 at WM.",1271116800,,7656,4.290657439446367
4081423,5,B0037HERAM,"This was a very good pay-per-view from top to bottom and one the best Wrestlemanias of all time. Let me get right to it.

First of all the production all night was fantastic. The stage setup, and ring setup with the structure overhead looked amazing. The video packages all night were fantastic as is par for WWE's crew. The lighting was very well done, and entrances were great with many superstars getting costume overhauls. Only a few malfunctions on the night including failed pyro for Kofi's entrance and Mysterio's failed springboard entrance kept this from being the most perfect show WWE has ever done in terms of atmosphere.

Unified Tag Team Championship
Big Show & The Miz def. John Morrison & R-Truth (3 and a half minutes)
This was a very short match, but it was NOT a bad match because of it. This reminded me of WSX matches where the wrestlers barely had any time but packed as much action in that time as they could. Some great spots including Shows huge fallaway slam, Truths top rope legdrop, and Morrison's enziguri kick on Show while Show was on the top rope. The opener is really only meant to warm up the crowd and wet everybody's appetite and this did that perfectly. I can't rate it higher because of the length but is is a solid little match. **

Triple Threat Match
Randy Orton def. Ted Dibiase and Cody Rhodes (9 minutes)
Simple and predictable story but it was effective in establishing that these guys are all going their separate ways now. I thought the action was better than I expected, yet still a little disappointing because I know after Legacy's series with DX that they can have great matches. The crowd was molten for Orton which is a bonus because they were not into Ted or Cody AT ALL. Seemed bored by them actually. Perfectly acceptable triple threat and perfectly fine for the second match at Wrestlemania. Just don't expect to be blown away. **1/2

Money-In-The-Bank Ladder Match
Jack Swagger def. Christian, Kofi Kingston, Evan Bourne, MVP, Drew McIntyre, Matt Hardy, Kane, Dolph Ziggler, and Shelton Benjamin (13 and a half minutes)
I will say right off the bat that this was not the best MITB match. It was still a great match for what it is and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Something I have to applaud these guys for is that somehow someway they still find ways to incorporate new spots into the mix which is extremely hard to do in ladder matches these days. The scaffold spots were great including the SWAGGA ladder sandwich, Bournes SSP off the scaffold, and Hardy taking some sick bumps. The two best spots of the night for me though were Bourne getting hip tossed from the ladder! (he was the star this year as opposed to Benjamin)and Kofi stilt walking with ladders which was sweet. Swagger winning was a surprise but actually a pleasant one as I feel he has huge potential. I would give this four stars except for the fact that it did feel a little too cluttered with 10 men and there were some unfortunate botches that brought it down some. ***1/2

Triple H def Sheamus (12 minutes)
This was this biggest surprise of the night in that instead of a borefest this actually ended up being the fourth best match of the night for me and a very good match in general. The first half was old school mat wrestling meets power wrestling and the audience appreciated it but weren't actually enthralled. The last 4 minutes were great though with some nice teases by both men and a red hot finishing sequence. Sheamus looked like he belonged in the ring with Triple H and H had his best singles match in a LONG time. Great Stuff. And while Sheamus lost he looked good in defeat which is important. ***1/4

If Rey Loses he Joins SES
Rey Mysterio def. CM Punk (6 minutes)
Criminally short at only 6 minutes. The difference between this match and the tag match in me being less tolerable of the length is that expectations were exponentially higher for this match. The story for a awesome match was there and in order for the men to effectively convey it they needed 10+ minutes. Still everyone played their parts perfectly with Rey and Punk going pedal to the medal from the start. Some nice chain wrestling including some sweet counters from Rey kept this match in the very good category despite it's dissapointing duration. I felt Rey losing would have made for a far more interesting storyline going forward, but not necesarily one that would make more sense. Ultimately nitpicking is pointless as this is still a very solid encounter. ***

No Holds Barred Lumberjack Match Special Guest Referee: Bruce Hart
Bret Hart def. Vince McMahon (11 minutes)
This is a very hard match to rate and discuss so I will simply break it into pros and cons. Pros: This delivered exactly what it promised which was an ass kicking for Vince while bringing closure to Montreal. For fans who knew of the infighting in the Hart Family the booking here was brilliant. Seeing Vince get Hart Attacked on the floor and then tapping to the sharpshooter was glorious. Vince's character is finally killed off. Cons: Was too long and dragged, easily could have been four minutes shorter and got the same point across. For those who DON'T know of the infighting in the Hart family the booking was confusing. I wonder if poor Bruce even knew where he was as he was counting McMahon out in a No Holds Barred Match which was kinda dumb. It just wasn't all that good. So really I Think the big problem here was length. I think we were going to get what we got here regardless of circumstances outside the company. However I think it would have been better received had it gone only 7-8 minutes instead of 11. *1/2

World Heavyweight Championship
Chris Jericho def Edge (16 minutes)
This was an awesome match yet still didn't feel like it was as good as these guys could deliver. While the spear after the match looked awesome it felt odd coming after the match as I felt it just as easily could have been incorporated into the match. I'm glad Jericho won but he also needed to be the one standing when the smoke cleared to really put him over as the diabolical heel and create more sympathy for the Edge babyface character. It was still very very good and felt like one of those classic matches that came off more like a chess match than anything else. They had a tough fight getting the crowd involved after the near PPV momentum Killer that Was Hart McMahon but these guys pulled it off. The first 5 minutes felt like an extended feeling out process with both men looking for an opening. The second five felt like both men hitting big moves to set up for the finish. The last five felt like Edge going for the kill and Jericho trying desperately to avoid it digging deep into his bag of tricks to claw out the win.  ****

10 Diva Tag Team Match
Vickie Guerrero, Michelle McCool, Maryse, Layla, & Alicia Fox def. Beth Phoenix, Mickie James, Gail Kim, Kelly Kelly, & Eve (3 and a half minutes)
This was actually going along harmless enough as a finisher suite until Eve and Gail botched. BAD. Then Vickie delivered a horrible splash off the top followed by an equally awful pin attempt before finally getting it right and winning. This is a DUD match but the quarter star is for Vickie's Tribute to Eddie before her attempted suici... hog splash. 1/4*

WWE Championship
John Cena def. Batista (13 and a half minutes)
Having watched their Summerslam match I knew these two guys could deliver but this match went beyond even that first encounter. While it was rough around the edges with some sloppy sequences, both men were very intense and sold the hatred well. The slow first half concerned me but they picked it immensely down the stretch and had the crowd eating out of the palm of their hand. They also brilliantly played off of the SS match at the end with Cena going to the top and Batista catching him in a spinebuster but this time being unable to put him away. Cena winning was not unexpected but making Batista tap was. I wish Batista had won but I was not necessarily angered by him winning because of how great of a match these guys gave us. The action wasn't as crisp as Jericho/Edge obviously but the story telling was (dare I say it) slightly superior and the crowd was in it from the start making this match its equal. ****

Streak vs. Career Win By Pinfall or Submission only
Undertaker def. Shawn Micheals (24 minutes)
In my opinion this match is superior to last years. While their match at the 25th anniversary was longer I felt this match had more emotion, told a better story, was better paced and had a far superior ending. For 24 minutes these guys delivered one of the greatest Mania matches I have ever seen and it was more than worthy of being only the 4th non title match in history to main event a Wrestlemania. Loved how they referenced last years match with Shawn spearing Taker before his running plancha or Taker having that look on his face that said ""again?!"" after Shawn kicked out of the tombstone for the second year in a row. The ending was a fantastic play off of Shawn/Flair from WM 24 with Shawn wanting no sympathy and slapping Taker in defiance. Taker responded with a rare JUMPING TOMBSTONE PILEDRIVER which was epic! The post match with Taker basically saying screw character and hugging Shawn will stand up there as a true Mania moment. I hate to see Shawn go but if this match is truly his last it was one last true classic from Mr. Wrestlemania. *****

Overall this a near perfect Wrestlemania. It's amazing looking back how a few small changes could have made this the best of all time. Shaving four minutes off Bret/Vince and putting the Diva's match as a preshrink bonus would have cut the crap back and given us 10 minutes to share between the tag match and Punk Mysterio. A 7 minute pure adrenaline soaked opener and a 12 minute near classic between the SES savior and Mysterio would have immortalized this Wrestlemania and pushed it past even the loft WM 17. As it stands it's kinda like Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali. If Ali had never existed Frazier would probably be considered the best boxer of all time. However history told a different story and like Frazier Wrestlemania 26 is on the outside looking in.

Unified Tag-Team championship
ShoMiz vs. John Morrison and R-Truth
This was a terrible tag team match. Truth barely got in it, Show made the match a bummer at the end with the huge knockout punch on Morrison, so, really, a terrible way to start off the bigest stage of them all, Wrestlemania.
1/10

Triple Threat Match
Randy Orton vs. Ted DiBiase vs. Cody Rhodes
This wasn't a half-bad match. I agreed with orton winning this one, i also agreed with some of the hard action in this match. There are some good moments like Orton moving out of the way and DiBiase diving on Rhodes, a huge punt to the head on Rhodes, and to end the match, a huge RKO on DiBiase. After the match, a nice ovation for Orton, and the return of the pose.
6.5/10

Money In The Bank Ladder Match
Kofi Kingston vs. Evan Bourne vs. Matt Hardy vs. Christian vs. Jack Swagger vs. Kane vs. Drew McIntire vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. MVP vs. Dolph Ziggler
This was a very good, but short highflying matchup. This was very exciting throughout the entire match and was very breath taking at some moments. Some huge moments in this match like a shooting star press off a ladder, a armbar suplex off the very top of a twenty foot ladder, and, Jack Swagger winning the match.
8/10

Triple H vs. Sheamus
This match was another short one, but was surprisingly ok. I liked this match, but with Sheamus being on the cover of Extreme Rules, this match could build up a rivalry between them and end up at Extreme Rules, But back to Wrestlemania, this match had its moments, but the biggest one was the pedigree out of nowhere.
5.5/10

CM Punk vs. Rey Mysterio
Now the stipulation to this match was that if Rey looses, then he would have to join the straight edge society, but Rey beat punk in only 6 minuets. This match wasn't as good as i thought it was going to be, and was very short as i pointed out earlier. So, this match was mostly a filler.
5/10

No Holds Barred
Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart vs. Mr. McMahon
This match wasn't very good at all really. Slow, brutal, and a tad boring, but vince was dominated throughout before the match was even started, during the match, and after the match. The sharpshooter returned, and Vince tapped out in seconds. This was a little boring, but everyone loved to see vince get beat the living crap out of.
7/10(only for the McMahon beating)

World Heavyweight Championship
Edge vs. Chris Jericho
I was so dissapointed with the winner of this match, but i saw that this was known as a impressive match with some good action from both men, and a few dirty tactics from Jericho. Some nice moments like Jericho going for a failed spear, the shot with the title belt to edge, and two huge codebreakers. Nice moment after the match when jericho gets speared off the announce table through the barricade.

John Cena vs. Batista
This was an ok match, i knew because of batista's heel turn, that this match would be a little slow paced. So, i was right, and this match turned out to be ok, i liked that Cena won with the STF, making batista finally tap after about a minuet. But this match had some moments, but didn't live up to its expectations.

No disqualification/No Countout-Streak vs. Career
Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels
This was definatly the best match of the ppv again. This match was crazy with some very nice moments like a moonsault through the announce table, a tombstone on the outside, two tombstones, a huige slap to takers face after he yelled the words of the mania, ""stay down"". This match was just great all together, and has a very good ending with Michaels retireing with a nice ovation from the crowd, and undertaker becoming eighteen and o at wrestlmania.
10/10

Well, this wretlemania was better than last years, and has some pretty good matches.",1270166400,,4030,4.560165975103734
4081425,5,B0037HERAM,"A couple of notes here in that the commentary team for this event is Michael Cole & Matt Striker & Jerry Lawler making this the first Mania since XII/12 that Jim Ross didn't appear or do commentary on.  Singer Fantasia did the ""National Anthem"" while former ECW/current RAW star Yoshi Tatsu won the pre-show battle royal.  Also it should be noted that if my counting is right, this Mania featured the most debuts on the main show in a decade.

Unified Tag Team Champions Big Show & The Miz vs. John Morrison & R-Truth - Unfortunately this wasn't a good opening match as it was real short to get into as this just showcased Big Show being dominate more than anything else.

Normally I don't comment on backstage segments but check out this interview with Vickie Guerrero & her team in the Divas tag match that eventually resulting in Gene Okerland & Mae Young delivering a WrestleMania moment that ranks right up there with Howard Finkel with hair & Jim Ross in a toga.

Randy Orton vs. Ted Dibiase vs. Cody Rhodes - After being associated & together as members of ""Legacy"" for around a year & a half, the group finally broke apart resulting in this showdown.  Eventhough this was advertised as a triple threat match, it was a glorified handicap match in the beginning as Dibiase & Rhodes double teamed Orton & even showcased what they learned from Orton as they used some of his own in ring style & methods against him like his version of the ""Garvin Stomp.""  However when it came down to who would get the victory over Randy, that's when Dibiase & Rhodes finally turned on each other allowing Orton to divide & conquer over both men executing his trademark moves on both men...to the overwhelming cheers of the fans.

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Kane vs. MVP vs. Christian vs. Matt Hardy vs. Evan Bourne vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Drew McIntyre vs. Jack Swagger - Just looking at the amount participants, you know this is the BIGGEST Money In The Bank yet & as you expect, this was your ""car crash match"" full of spots: Dolph Ziggler doing his ""Zig Zag"" onto Christian off the ladder, Christian & Hardy wedging Swagger in between ladders in a way we've never seen before, Evan going ""Air Bourne"" off a ladder before later being hip tossed off a ladder straight to the floor, and Drew McIntyre falling off the ladder & landing in a way that had to make every man watching feel his pain.  Unlike how in previous years, Kofi & Shelton Benjamin's performances stood out, Kane was that person for me this year by showing his power by catching Kofi & powerbombing him on a ladder followed by later squashing Ziggler in between the ladder before ripping the ladder in half...only for Kofi to later to try to use those pieces as stilts (I'm not making this up) & even throwing an open ladder out the ring with such force that it came close to hitting a fan in the front row.  When it came to memorable spots & highlight reel moments, this wasn't the best Money In The Bank they've done but it delivered.  I'm not sure if they're going to edit this in the DVD or not but pay attention to the ending as we had a ""TNA/Homicide/Steel Asylum"" moment where it took longer to end the match than it should have.

Triple H vs. Sheamus - No, you aren't reading this wrong...Triple H is in the first half of the card & not in the World/WWE Championship match.  I'll give credit where it's due in that this is probably the best performance I've seen from Sheamus so far in that not only was he able to come up with various ways to block/counter the pedigree but also told a good story of heavily focusing on Triple H's back with various submission holds to the point where it had to be pointed out on the commentary how eventhough he was still in his rookie year, his methods were very ""veteran like.""  Triple H's offense here was uneventful but did a good job of selling for Sheamus before coming out with the eventual victory.

Rey Mysterio vs. CM Punk - If Mysterio was to lose this match then he would have to join the ""Straight Edge Society.""  Before I get started, it should be noted that there was a malfunction with Mysterio's ""catapult"" entrance so it took longer for him to come to the ring than usual but when he did eventually make out, his costume this year was inspired by the Avatar movie...complete with the hair attached.  For those you remember this previous PPV match (Armageddon '08) then you knew to expect a good match here & that's exactly what you got.  Fast paced non-stop back & forth action here with some moments like Punk missing the baseball slide that had him feeling Drew McInytre's pain from earlier before being able to counter one of Mysterio's dives into a face first slam into the steel steps.  Mysterio got his moments in such as executing a DDT onto Punk from a top rope jump & delivering various loud kicks that sounded stiff.  Luke Gallous & Serelda did get involved more than once but it did eventually backfire in the end with Punk going headfirst downstairs on Gallous before Mysterio picked up the win.

No Holds Barred Match: Bret Hart vs. Vince McMahon - Before the match gets started, Vince revealed that he purchased his own set of lumberjacks in the Hart Family (including the Hart Dynasty) with Bruce Hart appointed as the special referee before Bret revealed that they already cashed the checks & that they were there to support Bret, not Vince.  Now this was one of those ""put a story over"" encounters where you have to accept everything for what it is.  It's well known that with Bret retiring after the concussion & later having the stroke, he can't take a bump or possibly give an ""Excellence Of Execution"" performance like he did over a decade ago so the Hart Dynasty were there to do most of the beating on Vince while execute the big moves like delivering a Hart Attack from the top rope that had Vince's head bounce off the mat when he hit the floor...while Bruce was counting out Vince on the outside in a NO HOLDS BARRED MATCH which was so silly that you have to listen to Lawler try to cover that up on the commentary.  The only real thing Bret did that was noteworthy was constantly hitting Vince hard with the chair before executing one more sharpshooter for victory.  If your expecting the quality Vince McMahon beatdown that he's received in previous Mania matches then your going to be disappointed but again, this was more about the story of Bret getting his revenge than anything else.

World Champion Chris Jericho vs. Edge - For those trivia fans, eventhough Edge & Jericho did have some interaction over the years in TV matches along various tag & multiman matches, this was their first ever one on one PPV match.  As it was put over throughout the match, these two men knew each other so well here that they were able to reverse & counter each other's trademark moves at various times like Jericho being able to counter the spear various times into other moves like the Walls Of Jericho & even a Codebreaker while Jericho even attempted the spear only to run into a big boot.  As Jericho made clear going into this match, he focused heavily on Edge's ankle including viciously stomping on it & even stealing his a move from his old ""Thrillseakers"" tag team partner Lance Storm with the half crab where he put the pressure on Edge's ankle.  This wasn't a fast paced match but one that had a calculated pace that allowed them to tell a story that was constantly built over time but left you wanting more when it was over.  However, the biggest highlight & memorable moment came afterwards when Edge delivered the one word that he promised would happen to Jericho at WrestleMania...""SPEAR"" and boy did he ever.

Mickie James, Beth Phoenix, Gail Kim, Eve, Kelly Kelly vs. Michelle McCool, Layla, Maryse, Alicia Fox, Vickie Guerrero - All I'm gonna say here is that if your a fan of the Vickie Guerrero character (which I personally am) or seeing finishing moves executed back to back then you'll enjoy this one as I was just laughing at her from start to finish & you'll be entertained with the commentary as well then just go to the bathroom or get something to eat/drink & it will be over by the time your done.  I gotta say that it was cool seeing Vickie kiss up to her late husband Eddie before attempting the ""BULLfrog/HOG splash.""

WWE Champion Batista vs. John Cena - For their SummerSlam match being remembered as shocking for how good it was just knowing how limited both guys are, they proved here that the quality of that match wasn't a fluke.  Batista heavily focused on Cena's neck that he injured in that SummerSlam match including one moment delivering such a stiff DDT that Cena needed a few moments to recover.  Both men delivered their various trademark moves in more impactful & unique ways that we're used to seeing such as Cena's Attitude Adjustment where he released Batista & tossed him instead of just slamming him down.  This had plenty of counters, kickouts, moments revisted from their previous SummerSlam match, and was even able to do some grounded holds that kept people on their feet.  Cena & Batista just work well off each other & This was a match that definitely lived up to the hype & Cena's best WrestleMania match.  Just like the other Edge/Jericho match, keep watching afterwards as Cena addressed the crowd wearing the infamous ""We Hate Cena"" s***s the only way John Cena knows how.

Streak vs. Career: Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels - Seeing how this is only the fourth time in WrestleMania history & the first time in 15 years that a non-title match is the final match at WrestleMania, you could tell that the quality they delivered last year was enough to warrant the closing position.  Eventhough these two put on such a memorable classic last year, they were able to put on another classic but different match this year as the stipulations of only winning by pinfall/submission along with the story of Shawn being so obsessed with ending the streak that he risked his own career...this match was more intense than the last one right from the opening moment when Shawn did Taker's trademark signature ""throat slash"" at the start.  Taker hurt his leg early in the match giving Shawn the advantage by heavily working over that leg with various moves like the figure four & even the anklelock.  Things really picked up from here with such moments as Shawn getting the tombstone on the floor, HBK executing a moonsault that you have to see to believe, and being able to counter moves from Undertaker that nobody else was able to counter before him while Taker himself was able to keep getting up from everything Shawn delivered.  I don't want to reveal the ending but the match had such an effect on Taker to the point where he showed more emotion towards Shawn that we've seen from ""The Dead Man"" before Shawn refused to go out without a fight.  As what has been the case with most of the matches here, keep watching after the match as you got got a very emotional WrestleMania moment.

In the end, this WrestleMania was definitely one of the best ones from top to bottom in recent years.  It wasn't perfect as some matches were too short (both tag matches on here) & one wasn't good as far as match quality (Bret/Vince) but everything else on here makes up & surpasses the faults so this is definately a 4.5 PPV and with the DVD adding the extras like the battle royal & the Hall Of Fame ceremony (Ted Dibiase, Antonio Anoki, Georgous George, Mad Dog Vachon, Wendi Ritcher, Stu Hart, Bob Ueker) along with Shawn Michaels' retirement speech then that bumps the rating up to 5 so this is definitely one you would & should add to the collection.",1269907200,2,11671,4.56267942583732
4081426,4,B0037HERAM,"This year, WrestleMania 26 hosted from Phoenix, AZ with a total of 10 matches on the card! Even though I felt some of the matches and ""moments"" were a bit of a let down, I think WWE put in a good effort into the event and WrestleMania 26 turned out to be an enjoyable show. And was undoubtfully a better show from last year's WrestleMania!

Unified Tag Team Champions The Big Show & Miz Vs. John Morrison & R Truth - The fact it was a short contest (barely over 5 minutes), this match never really left the ground. The four guys put in a good effort but due to time limitation, this match was not given near to enough time for something to boil up and to spark into something good. In the end, it was Showmiz retaining the tag belts and proving they are still the best in the tag team division. 2.75/5

Randy Orton Vs. Cody Rhodes Vs. Ted DiBiase - It was only a matter of time the young guns, Rhodes & DiBiase, were going to turn on their leader, ""The Viper"" Randy Orton and nature out on their own. This match started out a little slow as a glorified handicap match but picked up once the Legacy members turned on each other over who was going to get the privilege to beat up their former leader. From there, the match turned into something good and at one point there was even blood after DiBiase gets cut opened! After the animonsity exploded from the Legacy members, this match turned out to be a solid bout among a faction that was once the strongest in the WWE. 3.5/5

Kofi Kingston Vs. Christian Vs. Intercontinental Champion Drew McIntyre Vs. Evan Bourne Vs. Jack Swagger Vs. Dolph Ziggler Vs. Matt Hardy Vs. Shelton Benjamin Vs. MVP Vs. Kane (Money In The Bank Ladder Match) - For the first time ever, Shelton Benjamin was not the star in this match! That spot belongs to the young Evan Bourne after hitting his Shooting Star Press from the top of the ladder and also taking probably the worst fall of the night. Kofi Kingston was another one who broke out and at one point using a broken ladder to nearly win the match. Unlike the overall event, I think this match was a step down to last year's Money In The Bank match but this match still prevealed having excitment through and through and on this night, it was the ""All American-American"" Jack Swagger earning the prestige name, ""Mr. Money In The Bank."" 3.5/5

Triple H Vs. Sheamus - For the first time since WrestleMania 17, the ""Cerebral Assassin"" is competeing in a non-championship match at WrestleMania. But inretrospect, it was the up and coming and most dominate star in the WWE turning the tables and dominating ""The Game"" throughout the better portion of the match. After the domination by the ""Celtic Warrior"", the match turned into a very good back and forth confrontation but in the end it was Triple H using age and experience to pick up his 8th victory at WrestleMania and proving to all ""The Game"" is still on! 4/5

CM Punk Vs. Rey Mysterio (If Rey Loses, He Joins The Straight Edge Society) - CM Punk was accompanied by SES members, Saritta and Luke Gallows, to the ring and cutted a very good and appropriate promo on Straight-Edge before the bout. Once the match started, the match turned into a very good back forth match with solid action that was composed of good aerial work by Mysterio and clever counters by Punk. With a distraction by Luke Gallows that back fired, Rey Mysterio was able to score with the 619 to get the win. Overall, a good match but I recommend their Armageddon '08 encounter for the Intercontinental Title over this match. 3.75/5

Bret ""Hit-Man"" Hart Vs. Mr. McMahon (No Holds Barred Match) - In this match, Bret Hart made his first WrestleMania appearence since his classic Submission Match with ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin back at WrestleMania 13. But unlike then, do don't expect the same Bret Hart we all once knew as this match morely represented closure from the 1997 Survivor Series Montreal Screwjob. This match saw Bret, along with the entire Hart Family, gaining revenge for the worst night of Bret's career. The only highlights I can pick out would be the Hart Dynasty (Tyson Kidd & David Hart-Smith) reliving the Hart Foundation's signature move onto Vince on the outside and Vince taking nearly 20 steel chair shots to the body before Bret showing he still has one more sharpshooter left in him which was the true moment of the match for me. 2.5/5

World Heavyweight Champion Chris Jericho Vs. ""The Rated R Superstar"" Edge - Ironically 20 years ago, Edge was at his first WrestleMania where he saw the Ultimate Warrior beating Hulk Hogan for the WWE Title at WrestleMania VI and now 20 years later at WrestleMania XXVI, Edge is competing in a main event for a World Championship. The whole match was centered around when was Edge going to deliver the spear to Jericho. This match has a very good offensive exchange of maneuvers between the two with both Edge and Jericho reversing nearly every move they apllied onto one another. In the end, it was Chris Jericho able to pick up a clean pinfall win to retain his World Title. Soon after, we saw Edge run across two announce tables to spear Jericho through the barricade wall! Good match with the post match brawl displaying this isn't the last we seen from these two. 4/5

Vickie Guerrero, WWE Women's Champion Michelle McCool, WWE Divas Champion Maryse, Alicia Fox, & Layla Vs. Beth Phoenix, Mickie James, Gail Kim, Eve Torres, & Kelly Kelly (10 Divas Tag Team Match) - The divas at WrestleMania continue to have a borefest but honestly, I found this match to be really entertaining that saw Vickie Guerrero actually taking some bumps in the match and also paying tribute to her late husband, Eddie Guerrero, by doing a frog splash which Matt Striker named it a ""Bullfrog splash"" and Michael Cole calling it a ""Hog splash."" But in the end, all the divas got to shine and this was a good match to set up the last two main events. 2/5

WWE Champion Batista Vs. John Cena - This match was certainly rough around the edges that saw Batista making Cena's head and neck the focal point of the match after hitting a stiff ddt where Cena used his power and strength to counter ""The Animal"" every way he could. Both men in the match displayed a great deal of strength and power which allowed both Cena and Batista to hit their finishers where both were able to kick out of them respectfully. Batista even taking a page from their SummerSlam match where he catches Cena in mid air to hit the Batista Bomb for a second time. But in the end, as Batista tried to hit a 3rd Batista Bomb, Cena countered into the STF-U to capture his 9th World Title. 3.5/5

The Undertaker Vs. Shawn Michaels (Streak Vs. Career Match) - For the only 4th time in history, a non-championship match is main eventing WrestleMania and Michael Cole nailed it right on the head, this is indeed the most anticipated WrestleMania match ever. In contrast, you will see almost an exact opposite match compared to last year's initial match with the special stimpulation this time was the only way to win was by pinfall or submission. Early in the match, Undertaker injures himself that Michaels took advantage of but that only led to a more vicious Undertaker througout the course of the match that saw the Deadman fight through the pain. From chokeslams, ankle locks, Hell's Gate, Last Rides, broken tables, Sweet Chin Musics, and tombstones, and like a year ago, this match is a classic. I will not give too much away but I will state, like last year, this match is worth the price alone where the Undertaker goes 18-0. 5/5

Overall, WrestleMania XXVI was a huge step up to the 25th Anniversary of WrestleMania. The Undertaker/Michaels is worth the price alone but add a few other good matches from this card to the mix, I recommend this WrestleMania at a fair price.",1269907200,,7795,4.5646890636168695
4081427,4,B0037HERAM,"When I watched the PPV's pre-show broadcast, I thought to myself, ""Almost every match on this card is going to be worth my 55 dollars.""  I sincerely believed that the 26th ""WrestleMania"" would be among the very best before it started.  Even though I kinda overhyped the event, WWE has delivered one of the better annual presentations in a long time.

I'm going to put my match scores at the end of the review, because a few of these matches are really hard to judge on a simply number score.  Also, I'm not reviewing the 3-disc set because I didn't watch the Hall of Fame ceremony this year.
________________________________________________

1) The show started with the Unified Tag Team Titles Match.  The Miz and Big Show have become a solid unit in the past couple months, while I still don't know how R-Truth and John Morrison got paired together.  After this curtain jerker, I still can't figure it out, because the challengers lost in about 5 minutes.  This is one of the most disappointing ways to open a ""WrestleMania"", because with the strong Show-Miz teamwork against the flamboyant Morrison/Truth combination, we could've at least gotten a few more minutes.  As it stands, it got us riled up the rest of the show, but nothing more.
________________________________________________

2) I was surprised that the Legacy triple threat match was up next, but then again, this whole faction has been poorly developed.  Ted DiBiase and Cody Rhodes needed to come off like future stars leading up to this confrontation; instead, they've come off like another tag team while Randy Orton is still a great character.  The match predictably began with a 2-on-1 beatdown, until Rhodes & DiBiase eventually got greedy over who got the pinfall victory.  I was never bored, but it's too bad a lot of ""smart marks"" outsmarted the WWE long before we got here.
________________________________________________

3) The Money-In-The-Bank Ladder Match was next, with 10 superstars this time.  To my surprise, the PG-WWE still allowed for some pretty painful high spots.  As with all of these MITB Ladder Matches, there are just too darn many to recap.  Jack Swagger getting sandwiched by two ladders!  Kofi Kingston using a broken ladder as stilts to reach for the briefcase!  Evan Bourne delivering the Air Bourne from a shaky ladder!  Dolph Ziggler taking some vicious bumps and crashes!  So, what didn't I like?  For one, Drew McIntyre and Shelton Benjamin barely did anything in this contest, even though Drew is our Intercontinental champion & Shelton is normally a Ladder Match showstealer.  Also, I wish there were more spots involving numerous wrestlers.  The 10-man match usually came down to 3 or 4 guys at the most doing anything.  Finally, Jack Swagger had trouble unhooking the MITB briefcase, but I'm guessing WWE will edit that out of the DVD version.  Overall, I consider this 6th MITB showcase to be one of the weaker ones, but you can still look forward to a very entertaining thrill ride when you get around to watching it.
________________________________________________

4) Sheamus made his ""WrestleMania"" debut against Triple H tonight.  I still think the Celtic Warrior is a solid ring performer with boring mic skills.  Thankfully, that's you need here.  HHH started to worry me when things started off, because he made Sheamus look kinda foolish.  Once Sheamus gained the upper hand, things began to get interesting.  The two men showed some neat counters to their signature moves, and the commentary team did a good job of explaining Sheamus' psychology and ring tactics.  I'm guessing most will find this contest to be an average one; I think these 12 minutes of action successfully kept Sheamus as someone to keep around for a while to grow on the skeptics like me.
________________________________________________

5) CM Punk and Rey Mysterio were up next, and they somehow turned a bad situation into a good one.  You see, their Straight-Edge Society storyline had tremendous hype, thanks largely to Punk's incredible promos.  But the problem was that this great storyline and exciting physical contest only got about 8 minutes from bell to bell.  The action was fast and furious.  Luke Gallows and Serena showed great interference, without becoming annoying.  We were enjoying Rey's underdog scenario.  But then Punk and Mysterio started going for their finishing maneuvers, and I became a little sad that it all ended so soon.  Rey and Punk (along with Gallows & Serena) all played their parts perfectly and gave us a very good show.  It's just too bad they didn't have more time to compete.
________________________________________________

6) I regret to inform you that the worst marquee match from ""WrestleMania 26"" was the No-Holds-Barred confrontation between Bret Hart and Vince McMahon.  Vince and Bret overcame their physical limitations by doing some verbal taunting on the microphones before actually fighting it out.  But it all became clear that the reason The Hart Dynasty and Bret's Family were brought to ringside was to let the lumberjacks do all the work.  Bruce Hart's guest officiating was sloppy (he DQ 5-counts and ringside 10-counts in a No-DQ Match!).  Now, I can forgive the circumstances that forced this glorified squash to go down the way it did.  But the sad thing is Bret Hart's beatdown on Vince McMahon was so repetitive and awkward that the 72,000 capacity crowd stopped caring.  This whole couldn't even be enjoyed as a guilty pleasure or nostalgic pleasure.  I guess my main problem is that I really wanted Bret Hart to have peace with the WWE, and didn't care if he got revenge on Vince McMahon.  I got my wish on January 4th.  Hope March 28th was everybody else's wish.
________________________________________________

7) I was initially disappointed that Edge and Chris Jericho weren't the main event for tonight.  But considering how this World Heavyweight Title bout played out (and how much I enjoyed Cena/Batista & Taker/HBK more), I'm very glad they performed at this point in the PPV.  Jericho and Edge delivered a very scientific and unique match.  I expected that faster-paced action we would've seen from these two men years ago, but I'm glad that's not what they did.  Edge & Y2J told a more patient story where they only went for the signature moves when necessary.  I wish the crowd got into this one more, but eventually they became torn over who to cheer.  Perhaps it was mutual respect for both men.  Perhaps it was because the psychology wasn't clear at first.  This title match is tough to review, so here's the best way I can sum it up: I liked it quite a bit when I first watched, but it gets better on repeat viewings.  It's an old-school competition that grows in my mind as I think about it.  WWE booked it right, and Edge & Jericho performed it right.
________________________________________________

8) The 10-Diva Tag Team Match was a last-minute addition that nobody really wanted to see.  Thankfully it was so short and so ridiculous that I'm not too bad mad about it.  Sometimes we need dumb diversions like this so that we're not burnt out from one main event to the next.  In short, Vickie Guerrero was getting pummeled, the Divas then all exchanged signature moves, and Vickie finished with a sloppy Bullfrog Splash and an even sloppier pinfall.
________________________________________________

9) John Cena and Batista were rightfully booked to go on after Edge & Chris Jericho, because regardless of what you think about these two, they had a better storyline going in, and have an all-star chemistry that few wrestlers have today.  Like their ""SummerSlam 2008"" encounter, this showdown was a delightful surprise.  Somehow, these two guys just click.  It was a back-and-forth battle with smart strategy from both Cena & Batista.  There were unique counters to the usual spots, and some false finishes that I still can't believe happened.  I was actually surprised at how effective their ground submission holds came off.  It's refreshing to see Cena and Batista use tactics besides power moves and slugfests.  I thoroughly enjoyed this WWE Championship Match, and what better way to close it by having Cena celebrate in front fans with ""I Hate Cena"" T-shirts?  Brilliant!
________________________________________________

10) We close ""WrestleMania 26"" with the match pretty much everybody wanted to see more than any other.  Shawn Michaels and Undertaker were given the rare honor of main eventing the WWE's annual extravaganza in a non-title bout.  I commend WWE for acknowleding that Taker's 17-0 Streak and HBK's 25-year Career meant more to us this year than any belt or grudge.  I actually didn't think Taker and HBK would be able to deliver another classic, because their ""WM 25"" showdown was 11 years in the making for a longtime fan like me.  However, I must compliment Taker and HBK for putting another strong showing.  This rematch had more intensity and more aggression as HBK immediately taunted Taker with his patented Tombstone gesture.  From there, Taker tried to slug and slam HBK to hell, while HBK immediately worked Taker's leg with determined focus.  I do have a minor criticism: there were a handful of sequences where Taker and HBK moved too fast for the other guy to give a proper reversal or counter.  In other words, their timing was occasionally off.  But who cares?  In the long run, it doesn't matter.  For about 25 to 30 minutes, these two legends somehow put on a rematch that lived up to the hype (not to mention last year's Match-of-the-Year).  I don't want to say much more, except that the finish and aftermath are among ""WrestleMania""'s finest moments.  If for nothing else, watch ""WM 26"" to witness this exceptional rematch.
________________________________________________

""WrestleMania 26"" is WWE's most consistent ""WM"" in a long time.
The past bunch of ""WrestleMania"" cards have had a great match or two, with the rest being somewhat forgettable.  They were unevenly paced and hard to finish in one sitting.  But ""WrestleMania 26"" is going to go down as one of the better ones.  The Money-In-The-Bank Ladder Match was successful yet again.  The two championship matches were different but equally compelling.  The undercard wasn't too shabby.  The Divas match is thankfully short.  I suppose the lackluster Hitman/Vince affair will at least bring proper closure, despite its boring execution.  And our closing chapter with Undertaker and Shawn Michaels is a wonderful conclusion.

Please buy this PPV!  You won't regret it!
