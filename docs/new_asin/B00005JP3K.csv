1601887,5,B00005JP3K,"I would also love to see this on dvd. Would purchase quickly.  One of my favorite shows. It had been off the air for over 20 years and the theme song shows up in my head every so often. Loved all the characters and costumes and obsessed over Jeff and Ginger. What a little spitfire, Ginger was and Kyle Chandler still sexy as they come.",1436313600,4,336,4.1692307692307695
1601888,5,B00005JP3K,"It's to the point that if the blue-ray/dvd price were insanely priced at $80 I would still buy it and forgo groceries for a week, the show is that good.

 I was only four when this aired in 1991 and sadly I've only watched this show on YouTube on my iPhone and am dying to see it in its original full screen glory. It is television at its greatest, I consider this show the peak of television. Even HBO doesn't compare to the quality of this show, it has the best writting, the best casting, best acting, hair&costumes, best research, best editing, etc, it was truly revolutionary and still ahead of its time.",1433289600,5,609,4.380530973451328

1601891,5,B00005JP3K,Love this show! Still hoping that someday it will be released on DVD. Rewatched it on YouTube and it holds up after 20+ years. It's aces.,1420329600,4,137,4.3076923076923075
1601892,5,B00005JP3K,... we'll probably never see this series on DVD. It is really not compatible with the neo-con narrative of the new world order.,1414195200,,127,4.565217391304348
1601893,5,B00005JP3K,"TRULY hoping this show is released either for purchase or renting on Amazon Instant or Netflix.  I've periodically checked for this over the last 20 years and have always been disappointed that it's not out Y E T !

Does anyone know how to make this become a possibility? For such an awesome show, it would seem a no brainer to have it released.

AWESOME show - one that I think about over the years.  LOVED it!",1413763200,4,411,4.298701298701299

1601930,5,B00005JP3K,I just loved this show and have been waiting for years for it to be released on dvd. You can buy pirated copies that are bad quality so why not release it legally and have it available for those of us who won't buy it illegally!!!!,1360713600,4,231,4.043478260869565
1601931,5,B00005JP3K,"I am begging whoever has the rights to this series if they would PLEASE, PLEASE, re-release this series on dvd or even better, blu-ray, but I'll be happy with either!  I absolutely loved this show & never missed one when it was on the air.  I had never looked forward each week to a new episode like I did this.  Even my husband, who usually doesn't go for this type of show, (he is the typical crime, action & crude humor type) enjoyed it thoroughly & was just as dissappointed as I was when it went off the air.  My now 17 year old daughter started watching some of the episodes when she was 16 on youtube & she fell in love with them & said she can't believe what a great show it is & why it was ever taken off the air much less never re-released on dvd.  She said she would buy her own copy she loves it so much so she wouldn't have to watch the youtube ones anymore because of the small increments & pretty poor quality (but she & I watch them repeatedly anyway just to get our fix. lol).  She actually likes it more then 'Grimm' & 'Once Upon a Time' & thats saying something because she never misses those.  So, please bring it back & if anyone sees this review & has never seen the show, please believe me, it is phenomenal!",1357257600,5,1231,4.104166666666667

1601933,5,B00005JP3K,"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE!!!!!!  Make this series available on DVD - before I am a senior citizen.  I remember watching this series with my daughter (with Chinese carry-out) every week. We both enjoyed it tremendously even though she was only 19 years old at the time and I 40, it appealed to both of us equally.  Please consider how happy you would make a lot of fans!!!!!!",1345334400,3,371,4.590909090909091

1601968,5,B00005JP3K,"I loved this show and was sad to see it have such a short run. It stands with ""I'll Fly Away,"" Joan of Arcadia, and American Dreams in my mind as series that were not given a fair chance.",1338595200,,187,3.8205128205128207

1601970,5,B00005JP3K,I loved this series and never missed an episode.  I cannot understand why it has not been released.  It seems to me that Warner Bros. is missing out on a saleable item. They need to get with the program and release this series. I would be first in line to buy it.,1330473600,4,263,4.038461538461538
1601971,5,B00005JP3K,"When Mad Men started not only was everyone cooing over Jon Hamm's Don Draper, but they were loving the antics of John Slattery's Roger Sterling. His Al Kahn -- a union organizer who ends up wooing a local widow -- could be a proto-Roger with better manners and more likely to cause a stir.  Kyle Chandler played the awkward younger son of Kahn's love interest.  Everyone in the cast is outstanding, and it was energetic, provocative, and endearing.  And unlike Mad Men, Home Front managed to include interesting storylines for people of color in the main ensemble cast.  It's a shame it's still not available on DVD -- almost as much of a shame that it got cancelled in the first place.",1328054400,4,686,4.598360655737705

1602015,5,B00005JP3K,"This was one of the all-time great TV shows and I'm so sad that it's not available on DVD or streaming anywhere.

One of the great campaigns was fought for this show and at least managed to get it renewed for one season. I'm still sad that it didn't last beyond that. Now they don't even want us to see it and remember. It's a conspiracy, I tell you! Not sure a conspiracy of what or why... but something nefarious is afoot. I'm just sure of it.",1322179200,,445,4.114942528735632
1602016,5,B00005JP3K,I agree - why isn't this show on DVD?  It was fantastic.  A friend and I used to get together to watch it every Sunday night in the college dorm.,1321660800,,145,3.8
1602017,5,B00005JP3K,"There are many of us out here still waiting for the release of the TV series on DVD.  I was hoping with the

1602019,5,B00005JP3K,"It's hard to believe it has been 20 years since this series aired on tv! What are they waiting for? Lets release this amazing all too short-lived series on DVD already!!!!!! This series remains at the very top of my ""tv on DVD  wishlist"" that I want to add to my collection. Extremely well written and acted series that I will forever cherish as one of my favorite tv shows of all time, written by some of the same writers of the best nighttime & daytime soaps ever - Knots Landing and Young & Restless.  Too bad it looks like I'll be 90 until seasons 3 through 14 of Knots is ever released, but with a short, self contained series like Homefront, it will most likely be released in one set and I'm anxious to hear what the hold up is if anyone knows any current information on its DVD release....",1302307200,2,797,4.271523178807947

1602021,5,B00005JP3K,Why in the world isn't this out on DVD yet? This was such a charming show when it was on and about 10 years later when it was in syndication my kids would stay up late on Monday nights to watch it. We have all been biting at the bit waiting for this to come out on DVD. I have no idea why Warner Brother's would wait so long to put such a charming show out on DVD.,1299801600,,364,3.6794871794871793

1602023,5,B00005JP3K,"When I see all the obscure and/or just plain second-rate TV shows being released on DVD, I can't believe that this show is STILL not available on DVD.  Homefront is arguably one of the BEST TV series EVER on television.  I didn't know about it when it was first on the air - which is probably the problem - not enough promotion at the time it was on???  My husband (then boyfriend) had taped the entire series and introduced me to it in the late 90's.  Luckily we have these on tape (save for the last few episodes, which somehow got lost) but would LOVE to finally own a good complete copy of this on DVD.  PLEASE, PLEASE, Warner Bros. - RELEASE THIS ALREADY!!!!!",1298073600,2,664,4.32258064516129

1602056,5,B00005JP3K,"This was my favorite show of the '90's bar none. Heartwarming, suspenseful, excellently written, directed and acted. It was very dissappointing when they cancelled it. Maybe it was too classy for tv?  Too high quality?  I don't know...but that was one of THE dumbest cancellations in television history. Homefront was engaging and dreamily enthralling. It was like stepping back into a totally enchanting period of time each week. I'm fascinated by the post WWII era - what an amazing time. And to see such a well done show capture it so well and with such wonderful acting, costumes, story lines...it was just wonderful. I can still remember how much I looked forward to seeing it each week. A pure pleasure. I hope it will be released onto dvd soon - with extras!

Well, if bringing it out on DVD is too difficult, it would be nice if it was made available as a download similar to MP3s, movies, television shows, etc. that are available for rent or purchase nowdays?

I remember so many pieces of Homefront - music, sets, hairstyles, clothing, props, storylines, etc. and would love to be able to watch the program again and see how those pieces fit into the whole. Every time I listen to forties music I remember Homefront and think about the dancing done on the show.

The actors did a fine job and the writing was very good.  The praise the show received from critics and fans was well-deserved.",1292025600,,789,4.489510489510489

Of all the goofy, senseless shows they do release, why can't they bring this one back?  It has been over 15 years since the show ended, and look at how many people remember it so well.  I taped quite a few episodes but the quality is not that good, especially after all these years, and, of course, there are commercials.

Anyone have any luck getting ABC's attention?

It is the only show ever that totally depicted the lives of everyday people that the viewer could relate to totally.  The actors were superb and totally believable. The sets were perfection and the subject matter was serious and realistic to the times.  I have told all my friends and relatives that this was the best show ever and not a one has ever heard of it.  It breaks my heart that they missed out on the best TV show ever.

Unfortunately, it was only broadcast 2 seasons, probably because ABC didn't give it ample time to gather what the network would consider to be a substantial enough following to justify a third season. ""Homefront"" was a really good show. My parents were of the World War II generation, so many elements of this show were familiar to me. ""Homefront"" really belongs on DVD. With so much garbage available on DVD, why hasn't this show been released? What's the problem?",1244160000,5,586,5.380434782608695

I think I caught it on the back end of the series, but once I watched my first episode - I was absolutely hooked!  I have looked many times on the internet to see if the series had been released on DVD yet.  I would also buy it in a heartbeat.  It was fabuloso in every way - the music, the costumes, it just pulled you in and touched your heart, and made you feel so happy and good - it was a spellbinder.  I would pitch all of cable for a night of HOMEFRONT!!!  Please release the DVDs!!!",1223078400,3,617,3.896

My mom, who was a teenager during WWII, said that this show's portrayal of small-town life on the ""homefront"" was both accurate & compassionate.  The show had heart.

And the episode with the labor union strike should be required viewing for all high school American history classes - it might as well have been filmed on Miller Road! Unions, racial struggles, war-brides - so much more than just Rosie the Riveter.

If you ever get the chance to see this amazing television series, by all means do so - you will come away with a new appreciation for the Greatest Generation & all they endured during those tough times.

And on a more industry-related note, does anyone know what the big hold-up is in getting this great show released to DVD???

Now, is Warner Bros. going to repeat ABC's mistake and not release the DVD? This touching slice of post WWII is an amazing drama that makes you laugh and cry.

The episodes haven't been digitally remastered, so the image isn't as sharp and crisp as, for example, the DVD issues of ""Dallas."" But it's all there - from episode one, through episode 42. Here's what the site says about the show:

Things are starting to return to normal in the town of River Run, Ohio. World War II is finally over & the boys are coming home. However, the world around them is changing & life will never be the same again. Mike & Ruth Sloan have lost their son Mike Jr. in the war, but gained an Italian daughter-in-law, Gina who's pregnant. Gina is hiding the fact that she is Jewish & a survivor of the Holocaust. Abe & Gloria Davis, who work for the Sloan's, are hopeful that life will be better for African Americans now that so many Black veterans have distinguished themselves in the service. But their son Robert, A military hero, is embittered by the treatment he received in the army, does not think things will ever be any better. Everything appears to be rosy for Hank Metcalf though, as he is coming home to marry his sweetheart Sarah. Unbeknownst to him however is that Sarah is in love with someone else: His younger brother Jeff. Hank's sister Linda is angered that while women were treated as equals at work during the war, are now expected to take a backseat to the returning G.I.s, giving up the jobs they took to keep the country running so that the boys will not have any trouble getting work.

The matriarch of the Metcalf family is the widowed Anne, who believes in old fashion values & tries to keep her children on the straight & narrow. Anne's own life beings to change when she meets Al Kanh, a Union organizer who is instantly attracted to her. G.I. Charlie Hailey promised to marry is girlfriend Ginger Szabo when he came home, but instead married Caroline while he was in England. He's convinced that Caroline wants the same things out of life he does, a large family full of kids & a middle class life. The conniving Caroline lies & tells Charlie that is her dream as well, but she never wants to have any children & loves money above all else. The second season brought war widow & baseball lover Judy Owen to town. Judy works as bartender & dispenses good advice about love to her customers, though she rarely follows it herself..

It was a bonus that the acting and production values were so wonderful; I felt as though I was watching a movie rather than a TV series.  I loved all of the characters, even the snobbish Sloanes.  I've tried to follow the actors to other projects; in many cases, I've started watching a show simply because an alumnus of Homefront was in it.  Earth 2, Becker, Dharma and Greg, and Scrubs, to name a few.  Friday Night Lights has become one of my favorites, but I never would have watched it if Kyle Chandler hadn't been in it.

Anyway, the point that I'm trying to make is that this show is way overdue for a DVD release.  I was thrilled a few years ago when TVLand reaired the series, but unfortunately, it was all too short-lived.  I would love extras, like some ""Where are they now?"" interviews, outtakes, commentaries, etc., but mostly, I just want the episodes.

I can't say much more about this show since I have not seen or heard of it pretty much since it aired, but I will add my name to the lists of those who want it to come out on DVD!",1165104000,7,630,4.032
1602280,5,B00005JP3K,I so clearly remember this show and would love to own it on DVD!!  It was well-written and brought the period to life.  Truly hoping it will be on DVD SOON!,1164326400,12,156,4.0
1602281,5,B00005JP3K,"Like many others, I am hoping this series becomes available on DVD. It was a wonderful series that dealt with social issues of the 1940s with characters that have contemporary appeal (as exemplified by Ginger's struggle between career and marriage). This show (along with ""I'll Fly Away"") was critically acclaimed and had a loyal fan base. TV Guide even ran an ""SOS"" (Save Our Shows) Campaign to try and keep both Homefront and I'll Fly Away on the air, but both were cancelled after 2 seasons. Luckily, a 2-hour movie-length episode that tied all the loose ends together aired, so unlike many short-lived series, Homefront provided a satisfying ending for fans. Together, the pilot, the two seasons, and the final movie are like an extended mini series, which would make the show ideal for DVD. I am currently watching both Homefront and I'll Fly Away on the American Family Channel. I look forward to watching Homefront each week-- it is a cut above the vast majority of TV Shows on the air today... from the storyline, to the acting, to the historical detail, this series is truly superb.",1163289600,19,1091,4.808510638297872
1602282,5,B00005JP3K,"""Homefront"" was one of my all time favorite shows!  PLEASE put all of the seasons on DVD!  I believe there were three seasons in all.  Kyle Chandler was great then and he is the main reason I've been watching ""Friday Night Lights"" this Fall season.",1163289600,6,248,4.466666666666667
1602283,5,B00005JP3K,"Homefront is one of my favorite shows. It made me fall in love with the 40's (and Kyle Chandler!) The acting was great. It had wonderfull characters (my favorite ""Jeff and Ginger""). I enjoyed how the show mixed history with the soapish story lines. The makeup, hairstyles, and clothing for this show was perfect. I couldn't wait to see what the women were wearing each week. I loved how the music of the era was worked into the show along with the dancing. Glamorous!... Of course there was the tragic side of this era. What the families of the soldiers of the war went through when they did/ and didn't return home is portrayed beautifully. This show needs to be on DVD now!!!!",1161475200,7,678,4.520325203252033

Thankfully, TV Land aired all of the episodes a few years ago and I had tag-team VCR's set to tape it during the marathon. I have since made a copy of the VHS tapes and have them stored in a fireproof safe. With fans like this, don't you think it would make sense to release the show on DVD???

1602364,5,B00005JP3K,"This well written, beautifully acted show deserves to be released on DVD. It made me feel nostalgic for a time that I never knew.

1602365,5,B00005JP3K,"This is my favorite show from Lynn Marie Latham and Bernard Lechowick.  I'm biased, of course, to like their shows.  But this one is just the best all over, plot, characters, pertinence to society, even today.  Just the best.  Put it out on DVD.  Please.  Such a good thing it would be.",1153353600,8,286,4.403846153846154
1602366,5,B00005JP3K,"I have vivid memories of this TV show about life in a small American town, post-World War II that aired on ABC from 1991-1993.
I found myself humming Homefront's theme song, ""Accentuate the Positive"" the other day & had to look it up to see if it had been released yet on DVD.  Unfortunately, it hasn't.  Woe to Warner Bros. who has not yet released Homefront's two seasons on DVD; I'm sure they are losing money to people who aren't waiting for the release of the official version.
I still recall the dance competition featured in the first season & the screwball romantic comedy of Jeff & Ginger's relationship.  The period-appropriate music, clothing, & dialogue were fun for a kid who didn't grow up in the 1940s to take in.  There was a strong ensemble of supporting characters in the Metcalf, Sloan, & Davis families & many admirers of Homefront still place its actors by their work on this show. Homefront has a strong fan base thirteen+ years after the show was cancelled, which says something about its appeal.  Voters overwhelmingly agree on the JumptheShark website that this was one series that never made the jump into creative decline or ridiculousness.
This was a star-making hit for Kyle Chandler who later starred in the TV series Early Edition & can be seen this fall as a coach in the football TV series ""Friday Night Lights"".
If you want to show Warner Bros. what kind of fan base Homefront still has, look for the petition on the HomefrontOnDVD website, where there are production stills, clips, & news articles about this series. After registering, fans can also vote on TVShowsonDVD for their favorite TV series to be released on DVD.
It's a shame that all the seasons of Friends, Charlie's Angels & Dallas are on DVD, but nostalgic 1980s & 1990s TV shows like Homefront, China Beach, & Scarecrow & Mrs. King are overlooked with no announcement of a DVD release date in sight.  When there's nothing of interest playing in the theaters, Homefront would be a perfect series to curl up at home & watch.",1152748800,197,2022,4.69774011299435
1602367,5,B00005JP3K,"Homefront is a truly extraordinary show with its outstanding script and unforgettable characters. It will take you back in time to the 1940s and into the lives of many wonderful characters. We can't wait to ""Accuentate The Positive""!",1152662400,6,233,5.157894736842105

Here it is 15 years later and I still remember this as one of the very best television shows ever produced.  I have been watching and hoping for this program to make it to DVD.  It's a touching, funny, innocent yet real account of the young lives of our ""greatest generation"" as they leave war time and assimilate back into a changed United States.  Great characters, sweet without being cloying, the show explores the dilema of great ideals butting up against a new reality.  You won't forget these people.

1602371,5,B00005JP3K,"I'm pleased to see that Amazon has created a space for a forthcoming Homefront DVD.  No info is available on any release, however, Amazon did the same for shows like ""Adventures of Superman"" and ""Leave It To Beaver"".  As customers continued to add their reviews to the page, it seemed like both DVD releases were soon announced.  The more reviews a page gets (so it appears) the greater the chance the DVD will be released.  But who really knows how decisions like this are made?

One fact is clear - Homefront was an incredible show, with fine acting, great story lines and amazing set designs.  You really felt like you were in the 1940's.  Quality television often takes a while before people ""discover it"".  For example, ""My So Called Life"" only lasted one season but became a hit in reruns on MTV.  Two years was obviously not long enough for ""Homefront"" to make its mark in the top ten, but it certainly gained a huge audience who is now pining for a quality DVD realease.

It may also be a legal dispute as to which ""party"" even owns the rights to release it to the public. Therefore in my opinion it's still tied up in the courts. The issue of royalties is also a factor. I suggest someone with investigative journalistic skills pursue the issue of ""Why Homefront has not been released for sale to the public"". May I suggest starting with Wikipedia and a general search on 3 big search engines. It'll take a lot of time and letter writing, perseverance and frustrating moments.
