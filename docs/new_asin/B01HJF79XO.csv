8765567,5,B01HJF79XO,"This movie is awesome and definitely worth the $90 I paid for it. I'm not going to ruin the story so if you want to find out about what it's about, there's other reviews that does a very good job on it.
What makes this limited edition set worth it to me besides the awesome movie and soundtrack are the extras that comes with it. This set comes with 4 storyboard booklets and another booklet that includes drawings and what looks like interviews, in Japanese of course, I didn't really have a chance to look at it yet. It also comes with a second disc with extras, which are in Japanese without English subtitles.
Great movie with great extras makes this a worthwhile purchase in my book.",1478908800,5,688,4.425196850393701
