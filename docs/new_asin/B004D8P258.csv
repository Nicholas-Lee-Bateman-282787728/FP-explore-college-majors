4331626,4,B004D8P258,"Not what the picture on Amazon led me to believe (perhaps I should note the ""fine"" print next time).  I thought it was only the ""Who's On First"" bit from the motion pictures.  Never-the-less, it is a compilation of six of their TV shows.  Most of the shows they did, including the episodes on this DVD, were vignettes of their movies.  Hence, they are forced to scale down the bits due to time constraints inherent in a thirty minute television show .  The movie version I remember was about as long as the radio version which fortunately I was able to get some years ago on cassette.  The main difference is that more players are included and it takes Lou longer to completely lose it.  I think you will enjoy laughing more with the longer version if you can get a copy of the 1945 film, ""The Naughty Nineties"".  This film version of the ""Who's On First"" sketch is shown at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.  If you have seen the sketch (who hasn't) enjoy it again.  If you have not seen or heard it (what planet have you been on?), it is a must see.  Perhaps the funniest routine done by any comedy duo ever.  The timing of Bud and Lou is incredible, not to mention remembering all the names, positions and other patter.",1454198400,3,1235,4.368421052631579

4331638,5,B004D8P258,"What can I say about A&C that has not already been said before. The guys were the best comedy team of all time. Their timing was second to none. The first season of the A&C TV show was the best. The production values were high and the cast was perfect. Joe Besser who played Stinky in the first season was a riot. Bingo the chimp was a hoot dressed as Costello. Unfortunately, these two cast members were not in the second season. So season 1 stands out as the best season to own.",1447718400,,480,4.172043010752688

I would have liked to have seen more of the South Pacific theater which always seems to get trumped by Europe  because everyone came from there. But the fighting with Japan was simply ruthless and people don't realize how close both the US and Australia  could have been attacked.  The battle of Guadalcanal saved Australia from certain invasion. So I think they could have made a few more episodes but great coverage of the Soviets and their part in and after the war. I Highly recommend  it, trust me there is footage in there you have never seen unless you owned it ! Like the  Soviet Siberian Infantry in a full on frontal assault on skis with their reindeer charging down a hill !  Amazing",1437955200,,859,4.4743589743589745

Mostly this series avoids controversy and tells the story without grinding any particular political ax.

4331705,5,B004D8P258,"Personally, I really like this series. It describes the war from a largely French point of view. A lot of the scenes were shot with color film and others had some color added. The old films were enhanced to compensate for damage. The color images helped me to realize that the people in this war were ordinary folks like me, and they had no choice but to be brave and try to survive in hell.  I appreciate the screen captions, since my hearing is getting bad.  This series raised my interest in WWII and I have gotten addicted to watching WWII documentaries. It is very informative and not at all like the propaganda films that the government put out during and after the war<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apocalypse-World-War-II/dp/B004H0M2SC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apocalypse: World War II</a>",1352419200,3,838,5.438461538461539

In fact, the sound mixing throughout this version is terrible--anytime there is a loud scene with planes, tanks, or shooting, you can't hear the narrator.  We plan to ask Amazon for a refund.",1348358400,4,359,4.95

The quality of the DVD is great. It brought us back to the 1950's experience of watching shows on little black and white TVs.  That's what TV viewing was like in the 1950's!  Great memories.",1341273600,12,355,4.5

From the beginning to the end of this video,if you are unmoved then you are truly without any humor. The ability to make people laugh without sex, profanity, or at the expense of some one else is a lost art. The section who's on first is a masterpiece in it self. Just trying to keep up in the beginning was funny, and to turn words of t into names, inter change them and not fumble was hilarious. great video.",1326672000,3,510,4.322916666666667

8424966,5,B004D8P258,"If you are primarily interested in getting the ""Who's on First?"" routine, then you are on the right page. This release has six episodes of ""The Abbott and Costello Show"", and ""Who's On First?"" is on the last episode, titled ""The Actor's Home"". The set-up is that the duo agrees to perform in a variety show for the local retired actor's home. They ask for requests, and someone says, ""Baseball!"", and so they do their most famous sketch. I bet they could do this routine in their sleep, because they started doing it on a vaudeville touring show as early as 1937.

Don't stop at just ""Who's on First?"", though. They also do ""The Lemon Bit"" where Bud takes bets on whether you can guess under which cup the lemon is, a shell game, indeed. They've done this routine many times before, also, but I still love it. Then there's a variation of the gag where Lou has a frog in his bowl of soup. In this case, it is an oyster in his oyster stew.

The only parts I didn't appreciate were whenever Sidney Fields showed up as Stinky Davis, the grown man dressed up as a little boy. Lots of hitting and whining  it didn't age well for me.

These episodes of ""The Abbott and Costello Show"" are from 1952. They total 156 minutes of viewing, and if you buy it on a disc, English subtitles are available. There are no Bonus Features on this release.

Happy Reader",1521244800,,1347,4.372

8424968,1,B004D8P258,This version must be an early release because Martin Sheen is not narrating at all on this version and the audio and music is of terrible quality and the sound levels are completely off. If I had known this I would not have purchased this version. I have seen the real version of this series and it fabulous. It's really hard to believe how terrible this is without Martin Sheen not to mention the audio/music quality issues. I can't even watch it because it's not the same experience and would love to get my money back.,1516665600,3,521,4.4375
