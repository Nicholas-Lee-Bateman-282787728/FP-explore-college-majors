I was familiar with many of the people, but still learned a lot.  I think the animated stories would do well for elementary aged children.",1472256000,,277,4.872340425531915

8699846,5,B00SYQHWVW,"The Torchlighters series is a wonderful addition to any home that wants to introduce their children/grandchildren to a Christian perspective on heroes. The series is well done and gives children Godly heroes that stayed faithful to their believe in the Bible and Jesus Christ in spite of great difficulties and persecution. There are valuable lessons on many character qualities: faith, perseverance, suffering, honesty, courage, etc. They are done without any graphic violence and scary scenes, even though in real life, these giants of the faith suffered greatly. You should still view them before your child to make sure that they are mature enough to handle the content. Highly recommend!",1521158400,,692,5.3577981651376145

We do ""missionary mondays"" for homeschooling and they get to watch one on monday and spend the rest of the week learning more about that missionary.
