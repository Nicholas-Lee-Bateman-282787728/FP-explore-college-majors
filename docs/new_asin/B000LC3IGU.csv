2701592,3,B000LC3IGU,"I could see this workout being effective, but it totally killed my knees and I did only about 25 minutes of it.

The repetition of squats, lunges, and plies is horrible, I wanted to fall over after fastforwarding to the cool down.

So why is it getting 3 stars? Well I can see it would be a good workout, but you need to have really strong knees.",1180310400,3,346,4.149253731343284
2701593,3,B000LC3IGU,There are some different moves and they look quite effective.  The reason for 3 stars was all of the lunges/plies.  They have a whole section for each one (lunges then plies) both about 10-15 minutes each.  That is a lot of bending; especially for anyone with any sort of knee difficulty.,1174608000,8,288,4.607843137254902

8160699,5,B000LC3IGU,OOOOWWWW! This will kill you and your legs. But you'll feel amazing and powerful (and probably pretty freaking sore!). I am so glad I found this workout!,1413763200,,153,4.703703703703703
8160700,5,B000LC3IGU,"This is a perfect workout for those who are middle of the roaders like me.  It's a complete body workout!  The amazing part is you think the workout is soooooo easy until you wake up in the middle of the night and feel like your buns and shoulders are on fire.  For those who want an extra challenge, use five pound weights instead of two.  You will feel it like you wouldn't believe!  Great video!",1336608000,,398,4.253333333333333
8160701,5,B000LC3IGU,"I never leave reviews for products, but this time I had to. I used this DVD to tone my body to what I call 'My Perfection'. It is Intense, I must say, but you're not buying a workout DVD just for the fun of it. If you've got skinny thighs, you may not like it owing to the amount of lunges in this DVD. I must say that it works! The cues are easy to follow, the music does not bother me. So what more can you ask for? This is my toning DVD, Power Yoga by Jeanette Jenkins for Yoga, and Windsor pilates for Abs = Perfect combo!",1318636800,,526,3.834862385321101

The bonus makeup segment didn't do much for me, as I found it quite boring.",1274918400,,302,4.298245614035087
8160703,2,B000LC3IGU,"I picked up this DVD at TJ Maxx which is always a risk since I don't get to read the reviews first here, but it was also just two bucks and I often find good workouts there to make it worth it. This one, however, made me realize why it may have hit the bargain bin.

First, I must say I loved the music...not the boring electronica elevator music, but really hip tunes that make you move. The instructor was also excellent, with great energy and wonderful cueing making all steps easy to follow. I began the DVD thinking it was going to be excellent.

Problem is, several minutes in I realized there was a huge issue with the number of reps doing the exact same move. For 15 miinutes straight you do lunges. Yes, you read that right...the same move for 15 minutes. That is too many reps, by any trainer's standards, of the same body part. I actually can do that but it is pretty darn boring when I did it and my knees weren't happy although I have no knee issues. Granted, she mixes it up...you do side lunges, lunges holding one foot up, back, lunges, front lunges, lunges holding handweights, lunges not holding handweights...you get the picture. Because the DVD offers different workouts I am not sure why all moves have to be in a row rather than mixing them up...such as do a few lunges, then work your sholders, then do some more...but it was all lunges...and considering the warm up was mostly squats I was both bored and felt not worked out in all but one area when that workout was done.

So, because I liked the music and instructor, I tried the next section. This one was plies. I was rather surprised after 10 minutes to find myself still doing the exact same thing...plies. Which aren't all that different in parts being worked than your lunges. Squat down in a plie and don't use your arms, now use your arms...now don't...10 minutes of more squatting means I didn't feel much like I needed a DVD to instruct me...I could just go up and down with no assistance really if I wanted to do this rather than a real all-over body routine.

But I am no quitter so the next day I tried the upper body section. After only working my shoulders about half way through and having them burn far too much because of it while other parts of my arm were left with no attention, I gotta say I gave up.

You aren't supposed to do this many reps without breaks of reps of other body areas...it is more detrimental than good for your bod. I am not sure why they didn't mix it up at all but, instead, had a few routines of doing the same move over and over while mixing it up slightly with arm movements or direction.

I should also note I wear a bodybugg to measure my daily caloric burn. This allows me not only to know the exact number of calories I burn per day, but also during a workout so I am able to compare the effectiveness both during the workout to other workouts, as well as any spike in metabolism afterwards such as with strength training. I mention this only so you know when I mention caloric burn it was via scientific measurement rather than percieved exertion. This rated a B- for calories burned. You will be perpetually moving but because you aren't working more areas of the body at a time your exertion isn't quite as high in spite of the burn.

Conclusion: As someone who works out almost exclusively to a collection of fitness DVDs for varitey and motivation, I rarely give any away but this one wasn't a keeper for me. If you only want to work out certain areas it may be something you might like if you have a strong attention span for repetitive moves but you might also wind up bulking up that area which is one reason why you typically don't do long-term repetions...so if, for example, you want lean muscle in the back of your legs, you might wind up building up muscles and creating larger legs. However, the DVD might still be workable if you fast forewarded back and forth through sections. Or only do 5 minute stints at a time. Also, careful of your knees due to the above.",1243296000,3,4003,4.365100671140939
8160704,3,B000LC3IGU,"If you don't like doing lunges, don't by this because there is a section where all you do is lunges for what seems like eternity!",1239667200,,129,4.2
8160705,4,B000LC3IGU,"This workout dvd is so intense, you will have to pause it in the first session of lunges.  If you want an ultimate workout- this is it.  Wear some extra clothes, or what not and you'll be dripping sweat before you know it.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is because if you have bad knees, this might not work.  Otherwise, this is a workout DVD to keep!~!",1233705600,,357,4.057142857142857
8160706,5,B000LC3IGU,"OK, this workout is no joke.  I've had this DVD for about 6 months now but I'm just now writing a review.  This is an amazing workout but I'll be honest when I say that when I first started doing it, I had to press pause and take a break b/c it was so intense.  This DVD is a full body workout.  The instructor is great b/c she keeps the moves interesting and isn't annoying with the motivating chatter.  There are a LOT of lunges.  You'll do lunges without weights and then lunges with hand weights combining upper and lower body moves.  You work the upper body and back a lot as well--bent over rows, wood choppers, dead lifts, etc.  The ab section isn't very long (like another reviewer wrote) but it's still good.  I would say after about a month of doing it 2-3 times a week I started seeing results.  It took me a bit to get through the entire workout without having to press pause though.  This was a great purchase and is one of my favorite workout DVDs.",1214697600,,962,4.230769230769231
8160707,4,B000LC3IGU,"This a pretty intense 45 minute full body workout.  It is chaptered into 6 segments.

Warmup-  The warmup is approximately 5 minutes and is basically stretches and squats.

Lunges-  The lunge section is only about 12 minutes but it felt like it was double that.  You start with front lunges with a knee raise and eventually add a leg extension after the knee raise. Throughout the sequence your foot only hits the floor for the front lunge.  So, there's a lot of balance work too.  Then there's a series of back lunges with knee raises and a back leg extension after the knee raise.  This is followed by a series of side lunges.  Each move builds on the other so the workout progressively gets more challenging as you go along.  After the lunge work, she adds weights.  You combine the front lunge combo with biceps curls, the back lunge combo with shoulder presses, and the side lunge with one arm lat rows.  The workout is pretty fast paced so you do a lot of reps in each segment.

Plies- The plie segment is also about 12 minutes and incorporates a lot more than plie squats.  The plies are combined with upright rows and then there is a series of pulsing plies combined with heel raises. The workout then moves on to deadlifts combined with lat rows and lat raises while you balance on one leg.  Curtsy dips combined with tricep extensions, biceps curls, and shoulder presses are next.

Upper Body-  This segment is about 7 minutes long.  I'm not sure why they felt the need to make this a separate segment.  After all, we've been doing upper body the whole time and this section has more lower body work in it in the form of wood chops.  Otherwise, this section is mainly shoulder work that incorporates front and side raises with calf raises.  Lots of reps and your shoulders will be burning.  I had to take short breaks several times.

Floor Work-  The floor work segment is 10 minutes long.  You work the chest by doing several sets of push ups and chest presses.  The chest presses are combined with bridges.  You also do french presses for the triceps and lat raises.  There is a short sequences of traditional floor work-glute and leg raises.  The abs workout is combined with the lat raises in the beginning and then it moves onto traditional ab work.

This workout ends with a 3 minute cooldown and stretch.  I gave the workout 4 stars instead of 5 because the instructor, while very likeable, did not cue well.  There is no mirror cueing in this workout and her constant references to your ""outside leg"" and ""other leg"" means that you have to keep track of which leg you're supposed to be working.  She almost never says left or right. I've got enough to worry about trying to keep up with the sequences.

I really like this workout.  Although it is fast paced, it's not so fast that you can't keep up and the moves flow well into each other.  I am not a fan of lower body exercises but the combination moves and the fast pace keeps it interesting.",1214524800,8,2963,4.4812734082397006
