8466984,4,B005DK7654,"I had told my oldest grandson about the movie, an interesting concept. We had watched ""Interstellar"" together, and he had asked if I liked science fiction when I was his age. (11) I told him we had some great films, but nothing like the special effects in what he is watching. He viewed ""Enemy Mine"" as well as ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" and a few others. He was fascinated by ""Fantastic Voyage"" asking a multitude of questions.

""Enemy Mine"" is dated, it is not sci fi action like the new films, but it is worth looking at. It is a nice story....",1522022400,,546,4.352941176470588
8466985,1,B005DK7654,So what is the difference of this DVD that it warrants a $29.00 cost vs $7.33 for the other DVD!????,1489968000,3,100,4.05
8466986,1,B005DK7654,"ENEMY MINE
a classic sci-fi thriller from 1985 Directored by Wolfgang peterson
Wolfgang Directed this film just after the Neverending story was released in Cinemas
the first dvd version of the film was back in 2003-2004
which has a new Digital remaster transfer in 2:35:1 ratio & 5.1 Dolby surround mix
there's no extras, just the films theatrical trailer
the new Digital transfer is very Good, but the sound quality isn't, the 5.1 Dolby digital mix is very weak
sounds more like 2.0 stereo mix to me than a boosted 5.1 mix, Big difference
now Twilight time got the rights to film to release on blu-ray few years ago now
and there's nothing exciting about this new blu-ray version
the film has been given a new 1080p transfer in 2:35:1 ratio & new 4.0 master audio mix
which may look and sound much better quality than the old dvd version
but that's all you get, there's no new extras again just the usual theatrical trailer
i thought Twilight time may have got a new interview with Wolfgang peterson or Dennis quaid about the film
or a new commentary with Wolfgang at least
but tragically no effort has been given for the extras at all, just the usual Trailer
and this blu-ray is out of print now and selling for over $50-$100 on ebay now which i think is big ripoff
considering there's no new extras, no nothing
so the blu-ray is waste of money in my opinion
well there is now another dvd reissue of the film by 20th century fox
and guess what no new extras again no nothing all century fox has done is change the artwork for the Disc & the case
however U.K. Distributor Eureka classics are releasing a special edition blu-ray in June
it's a special edition version so will have new extras, maybe a new interview with Wolfgang peterson or Dennis quaid
nethertheless there will be new extras so check amazon uk or check Eureka classics website for more info
4 stars for the film, 1 star for this new dvd reissue cause it's just a recycle of the old dvd",1459209600,6,1953,4.473389355742297
