If you drive or don't even own a vehicle, everyone should view this video.

All teenage drivers should be required to watch this prior to getting

a drivers license. This show will open your eyes to the danger that trains can be,,they must be respected.

The DVD content is exactly the same as the VHS and the quality is superb.

A must have!",1179878400,,403,4.25
