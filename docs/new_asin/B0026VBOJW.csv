3857441,5,B0026VBOJW,"A large blue, white, and red colored block lettered placard initially defines the referential elle of the film title as the Paris region as an off-screen narrator (Jean-Luc Godard) speaking in whispered, barely audible tone provides a contextual reference of the year 1966 through the annotation of Paul Delouvrier's appointment as prefect of the newly created Paris region juxtaposed against the images (and din) of heavy machinery, construction, and urban traffic. A subsequent vignette provides a secondary definition of elle, as the narrator provides an abstractly clinical description of the film's lead actress, Marina Vlady, a photogenic young woman of Russian ancestry who recites the Brechtian methodology to ""speak as though quoting the truth"" before truncating her pensive reflection in mid sentence and turning away from the camera to the right of the screen, revealing her strikingly luminous profile. A quick, unmatched cut of the actress in medium shot, still overlooking a high-rise building from the balcony of a comparably high-density residential complex, introduces a third elle into the variable equation: the attractive, but intriguingly inscrutable heroine, Juliette Jeanson (M. Vlady), the wife of a financially struggling, yet seemingly content and undermotivated mechanic (and passive intellectual) named Robert (Roger Montsoret) who, as the actress herself had similarly performed earlier, articulates a passing idea through a half finished sentence - this time, in reference to popular (and prolific) detective and mystery author Georges Simenon and his novel, Banana Tourists - before turning to the left of the screen ...an opposite, but equally reflexive gesture that, as the narrator once again comments, is of no importance. The three elles ultimately define the film's discursive plane as the camera follows Juliette in the course of a typical day in the life of the young wife and mother as she performs her domestic tasks, shops, meets friends, and prostitutes herself to make ends meet in the uncertain socioeconomic climate of postwar Paris as the newly created regional administrative goverment rushes headlong towards rapid urbanization.

Two or Three Things I Know About Her is a highly eccentric and audaciously complex, but sincere, passionate, and infinitely fascinating exposition on identity, modernization, international politics, and consumerism. Articulated though the repeated reflection, ""a landscape is like a face"", Jean-Luc Godard juxtaposes images of large-scale urban construction with character opacity and depersonalized sexuality in order to intrinsically correlate the incalculable human consequence of reckless government policy: an irresponsibility that is not only evident internationally, in the increasingly complex and aggressive U.S. foreign policy stemming from the Cold War (and particularly, its effect on the prolongation of the Vietnam conflict), but also domestically, as the Paris regional government constructs an alienating and culturally neutered modern industrial landscape in the wake of globalization (an economic reality that Godard, rather than characterize as an inevitable consequence of technological progress and innovation, unfairly identifies as another symptom of American aggression). Godard's compositions of impersonal structures and desolate cityscapes - an undoubted influence on the cinema of Chantal Akerman - serve as a visual abstraction of urbanization and cultural flux that inherently reflect Godard's deconstruction of images (or pre-defined filmic cues) in order to convey the syntactical difference between an object's meaning and its significance. It is the filmmaker's personal quest to find the unifying root of this implicit duality that is captured in the recurring image of the attenuating vortex of a cup of black coffee - an allusion to organic genesis in its coincidental resemblance to spiral galactical formation and nuclear mitosis - a desire to return to the origin of the fracture: to reconcile one's abstract, intellectual knowledge with real, tangible, true human understanding.",1278201600,,4098,5.796019900497512
3857442,1,B0026VBOJW,"I really do not understand what is so great about Godard?  He has got to be one of the most self-indulgent filmmakers ever.  There's no narrative, plot nor characters in ""2 or 3 Things I Know About Her.""  There's plenty of director's point-of-view--but that's about it.  All right--so he's against the establishment.  Ho hum.  What else is new?  At least he could've shown it in an interesting way instead of telling it to us in a boring manner.  I personally think Godard gives arthouse filmmaking a bad name.  All kinds of words come to mind if I had to describe Godard, such as pretentious, esoteric and overrated.",1275350400,6,617,4.691588785046729
3857443,4,B0026VBOJW,"Many critics consider this 1967 Godard film to be among his very best, with several stating flatly it's the hands-down winner.  (Amy Taubin makes an interesting case for this point of view in her essay for the current Criterion release.)  I don't share that opinion, nor would I recommend this film as an introduction to Godard's work for the novice viewer.  That said, there's still plenty to fascinate.  Most of his usual markers (gorgeous actress front and center, prostitution as a plot device -- in this instance, used to pay for the heroine's middle-class lifestyle -- contempt for America and the Vietnam war, use of alienation devices that make Brecht look like Walt Disney) are on display, with varying degrees of impact. Godard's whispered narration is wearying; even with subtitles, that constant hissing annoys.  But what a pleasure, after years of bad art-house prints, to see the cinematography, vibrant in its restoration, snap, crackle and pop with the comic-book vigor intended.  This movie's gorgeous, the visuals are frequently laugh-out-loud funny, and, despite its obscurities and eccentricities, leaves the viewer pondering its message for days.  Repays investigation for the dedicated viewer.",1249516800,8,1215,5.363157894736842

8353666,3,B0026VBOJW,"Interesting period piece of the late 60's...thought provoking film style, but despite all that, it just can't shake the aura of pretentious leftist drivel that frankly, given the disasters of leftist policies of the last 50 years, just doesn't age well.  I ""get"" that godard thinks capitalism is sterile and commercial materialism is soulless (yawn), but that is just leftist poppycock that rings hollow given the outright despair, death, and murder that life under communist regimes have given rise to over decades.  Interesting film style and use of film to capture a philosophical outlook, but in the end the ""message"" just rings false.",1461888000,,639,5.194174757281553
8353667,4,B0026VBOJW,"As the 1960s went on, Jean-Luc Godard was increasingly alarmed by the rise of consumerism in France. He first confronted this issue with his 1964 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Une-femme-marie/dp/B002WCWG7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Une femme marie</a>&nbsp;where the characters mindlessly repeated advertising slogans in their dialogue and the eponymous protagonist, keen on women's magazines and the latest fashion, was completely unaware of Auschwitz or other tragedies. A couple of years later, Godard read a magazine article about a housewife in one of the big new highrises outside Paris who, while her husband was at work, prostituted herself to afford all the nice things that he couldn't buy her. This led him to take up the housewife theme again, but the resulting film, 2 OU 3 CHOSES QUE JE SAIS D'ELLE (Two or Three Things I Know About Her) is a considerable departure from past work and marks Godard's adoption of a more overtly political cinema.

Marina Vlady, not even 28 years old then but already seen as a venerable old actress, plays Juliette Jeanson. Married to Robert (Roger Montsoret), an auto mechanic, she begins her day by seeing him off to work, her young son off to school, and then dropping her infant daughter off at a day care. The film tracks her visiting boutiques and the hairdresser, with her means of affording all this only alluded to at first. Godard gradually reveals the element of prostitution in all this, suggesting that many of the young women Juliette encounters over the course of a day are doing the same. The only encounters with johns are depicted in a banal fashion, everyone involved clearly bored. These scenes of housewife life are separated by shots of construction workers across Paris erecting a new and considerably more impersonal city.

In 2 OU 3 CHOSES, Godard heavily uses a technique that he had experimented with in his earlier two films: a headphone is worn by a female actress (whose voluminous hairdo hides it from the camera), and then Godard would ask her questions or have her repeat to the camera lines that he fed her without prior preparation. Thus much of the film consists of the protagonist or other characters delivering what seem to be disjointed monologues. The technique tends to dehumanize the characters, just as Godard feels that consumerism makes everyone a zombie. But it also makes them blatant mouthpieces for Godard's own thoughts, which can start to feel rather tiresome. (If you've wondered where the dividing line is between ""New Wave"" Godard and ""political"" Godard falls, it's here.)

Indeed, Godard goes heavily didactic here. Over much of the film he gives a voiceover in a barely-intelligible whisper, presenting his own fears and hopes. Over one of the film's most famous shots, the swirls in a hot cup of coffee, Godard even says something which doesn't even seem to be related to the film at all, but which involved his disappointment at being jilted by Vlady romantically at this time. But in his voiceovers and in the dialogue of his characters, Godard also takes on the war then raging in Vietnam to such a degree that the original housewife prostitution plot is pushed aside (or at least made only a tiny part of a vast geo-social-cultural-political point the director is making), and Godard's disappointment with the United States is presented in a bitter fashion.

Thus 2 OU 3 CHOSES is, in my opinion, a not completely successful experiment, where Godard wanted to include the whole world but was unable to make the elements cohere. Still, it is worth watching for cinephiles. While, as I said, Godard had dealt with the ""housewife and consumerism"" theme in an earlier film, this is much more effective due to its use of color. After all, commercial brands were deft users of color to attract the eye of shoppers, and a mere black-and-white shoot would miss out on this explosion of hues. (At one point Godard says in voiceover, ""If you can't afford LSD, buy a colour television."") The final voiceover and camera shot is particularly majestic in this regard. Elsewhere in the film, as we move through blocks of flats, shops, or city streets, Raoul Coutard's cinematography is mindblowing, with long takes of powerful impact.

Criterion's edition is so far only on DVD, which is a shame since the visual splendour of the film calls for the higher definition of Blu-Ray. There are a few interesting extras. Godard's films of this era abound in references to literature, philosophy and politics, and Criterion gives a 9-minute walkthrough for all these allusions. Archival material consists of television interviews from the time of the film's release, one of Vlady where she explains Godard's demands on set, and the other where Godard spars with a government economist. There is a 15-minute interview with Antoine Bourseiller, a man of the theatre and close friend of Godard in the 1960s, who contributed to several of Godard's works in this era (it is Bourseiller's children that act in this particular film). Though his admiration for Godard remains undimmed, Bourseillier poiginantly recounts how Godard cut off all contact with his former bourgeois acquaintances at this time as his political despair grew. Finally, the audio commentary is by scholar Adrian Martin, though I found this to be very disjointed, as if Martin hadn't prepared notes beforehand but just spoke off the top of his head.",1443916800,2,5450,5.098544232922732
8353668,3,B0026VBOJW,It was exactly what I expected from this movie.  It's not my favorite Goddard movie but it is piece of history; an art form in Cinema.,1427328000,,134,4.153846153846154
8353669,4,B0026VBOJW,"In 1967, Jean-Luc Godard released two very original pieces that explore similar themes with diverse results.  `Week End', my personal favorite of the two, is brash and aggressive and dominates from scene to scene, whereas `2 or 3 Things I Know About Her' (the more critically acclaimed of the two) is a subtler, softer look at the power of sex, politics, money and life in general.  Told in faux documentary fashion, `2 or 3 Things I Know About Her' is shot in a series of vignettes that follow a young actress portraying a young housewife who sells her body to make ends meet.  It is through this faade that Godard explores a bounty of themes that were poignant at the time of release and still hold true today, given the shift in culture and the overbearing presence of the media.  With lush backdrops (the cinematography is stunning) and some intriguing directorial flourishes (Godard has such a distinct voice), `2 or 3 Things I Know About Her' is a multi-faceted film that will tantalize and enlighten you.",1380844800,4,1011,4.7272727272727275
8353670,5,B0026VBOJW,"I like this Godard film the best, because it is a social commentary on wealth, poverty, materialism, and morals intermixed with panoramic views of Paris. A feast for the mind and the eyes.",1377043200,2,188,4.7272727272727275
8353671,4,B0026VBOJW,"This film may be Jean-Luc Godard at his least accessible. 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her is the lucid journey through the experiences of French women in the 1960s. There is virtually no plot, just a series of scenes with her children and at work as a prostitute; blended in with all of this are scenes of other women in this line of work.

This ""story"" is told in a very interesting manner though, flowing between all these scenes and strung together by the whispers of an omnipresent male narrator as well as the women occasionally breaking the fourth wall and speaking to us directly. In addition, prostitution serves as an interesting metaphor; these are all women who appear to be middle-class, yet they are apparently forced into this lifestyle of exploitation by men.

This creates the gender divide recurring throughout the film. The women do what they need to in order to make ends meet, including resorting to prostitution. Meanwhile, the men often have their heads in the clouds, focusing on international politics or theory, lacking the practical ""skill"" the women employ.

I could follow the film through this much, but on top of this there was clearly a critical commentary on consumer culture and capitalism; it was hard for me to understand its place in all the action though, and the reversion to this theme made the end product seem a bit bloated to me, as if Godard tried to bite off more than he could chew.

This movie certainly reflects Godard's effort to surge into more serious territory, particularly gender politics. 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her isn't for everybody, but it is good viewing for Godard aficionados. Most Americans (myself included) aren't very conscious of representations of feminism in other countries, so this film is particularly illuminating.",1375574400,,1789,4.855737704918033
8353672,4,B0026VBOJW,"Jean Luc Godard has been the most controversial, irreverent and rebel filmmaker of the New Wave French. This essay-picture mirrors with a style that actually could be seen as outdated, continues to amaze the viewer because its variegated frame of issues: Vietnam, sex, politics, philosophical opinions, art, styles of life, feminine attitudes that are widely related with the state of things by then.

Marina Vlady is a normal woman who is not afraid in prostitute herself to finance her small bougeoise pleasures. This is a very remarkable point because that same year Buuel was making another similar film Belle de jour.

Godard was never a filmmaker easy to digest or bear. Anyway, its visual references, and audacious style well deserves an important place in your collection.

Watch it keeping into account this premiss in mind.",1324166400,3,833,5.155555555555556
8353673,5,B0026VBOJW,"An accurate/tragic portrayal of an extremely real social situation on the outskirts of Paris during the 1950-60's where married women were encouraged by their husbands to engage in prostitution because, though the husband/wife were working they were not paid much.",1310515200,,264,5.625
8353674,5,B0026VBOJW,"""2 or 3 Things I Know About Her""(1967) is one of Godard's most complex films. With this film he leaves behind a lot of the playfulness and Film Noir like early films which he developed around his love of B American films, and instead enters a new terrain touched on earlier in ""Vivre sa Vie""(1962) and some of his other films, which were more concerned with political/social ideas than entertainment. The germ of this film was based on a true story of a prostitute living on the outskirts of Paris amongst the new apartment developments. The movie has a curious mix of diverse elements that all seem to collide into an intelligible discourse on consumerism, pop culture, people, and their urban environments. This might not be everyone's cup of tea but if one likes to think and watch movies then this might be one to check out. This isn't a character driven film as it is more of a film about ideas that has a didactic but poetic quality about it.

This movie looks great as it has been remastered and comes with a booklet with articles discussing the themes of the film.",1287100800,,1072,4.55440414507772
