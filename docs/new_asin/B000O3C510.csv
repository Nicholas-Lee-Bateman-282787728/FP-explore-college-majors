2789686,5,B000O3C510,"Unlike the previous review, this review is for the actual workout dvd listed. My baby is ~8 months old, and while I have all but the last 10 lbs off(my body hangs onto the last 10 lbs after all 3 of my kids, until I'm done nursing them), I am always on the look-out for quick, no-nonsense workouts that are easy to follow along with, to fit into my busy days. I am happy to say, this one definitely fits the bill.

The workout contains a warm-up, 3 cardio-toning segments, a cool-down & stretches and is ~30 minutes in length. Recommended weights for this workout are 3-5 lbs weights. I would suggest 3 lbs for those who haven't used weights before or haven't used them in awhile and 5 lbs for those who are used to lifting weights. The first cardio/toning segment combines kickboxing cardio w/short segments of toning(ie. lower body exercises such as plies, squats, and lunges w/upper body using weights at the same time to get your heartrate up). The second segment combines Latin style dance cardio(think mambos, v-steps & hip flares) also combined w/similar upper & lower body toning. The last cardio segment is classic/athletic cardio w/toning. Very easy to follow along to, cueing is off in a couple spots but the moves are basic and not hard to get back on track. My heartrate really got up, and I was sweating so much by the end.

Jennifer Nicole Lee is living proof that it is possible to get back in shape after having kids. Very friendly personality, not too much chattiness, but funny at times(it's important to have fun). She says a few times about that we're making the most of our time and in the kickboxing segment she mentions that Rocky needs to watch out! lol This Fabulously Fit: Total Body Workout has made it to my must-have list & will never leave my house (and that's saying something for the huge vidiot i am).

you can find a 1 minute preview clip at collagevideo.com (do a title search)

There is also a bonus segment on the dvd (~10-12 minutes) that's part of her soon-to-be-released workout(next month)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fabulously-Fit-Moms-Lower-Body-Burn-Featuring-Jennifer-Nicole-Lee/dp/B000V02COQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fabulously Fit Moms: Lower Body Burn - Featuring Jennifer Nicole Lee</a>. If the 10 minute clip(warm-up + standing work) is any indicator on how the rest of the workout is(my legs were jell-o), it'll be a must-have also.",1192233600,25,2434,5.04726368159204
2789687,1,B000O3C510,"This dvd is BORING; the woman has no dynamism whatsoever!  Since the tape is designed to be a workout with your baby, you might expect a baby on the recording, but NOOOO!  Instead, she has a little red medicine ball she calls her ""snuggly."" Gag!
I consider this purchase ""money wasted"", and would advise you against purchasing it, unless, of course, you need help getting to sleep.",1189900800,7,381,4.6716417910447765
2789688,5,B000O3C510,"Thank goodness there is no reference to postnatal anything. For the reviewer that gave it only 3 stars because of it, well, it doesn't say ""new"" mom, it says fit mom. I'm a mom of a 16 year old and I'm as fit as can be. This workout rocks. In just 30 minutes you get an intense cardio & weights circuit with fun cardio styles (like kickboxing and dance) with various intensity and options, plus compound exercises with weights to work your whole body. No time wasted to rest either. Additionally, there is a short (10 minute) lower body bonus segment. The only thing missing would be an abdominal section, but I'm still giving it 5 stars, because the workout is well cued, the instructor super-pleasant and you get a lot done in a short time. Definitely recommend this one if you are intermediate to advanced.",1274140800,,809,4.5479452054794525
2789689,4,B000O3C510,"This workout is fun. Jennifer combines kickboxing moves with some latin dance moves to get you moving. It was a good workout for any level. I was hoping that I would sweat more, that she would work me harder. I found that the lower body burn is my favorite dvd of hers. Once I did the workout, I had to buy the dvd so I could do it all the time. It's a killer. The Total body workout is good though and I would recommend it to any mom who just had a baby and looking to get into shape. This will work you, but it's not too intense.",1233360000,,531,3.8807339449541285
2789690,5,B000O3C510,"I started using this video six weeks after having my second baby.  I started this pregnancy a little overweight still and wanted to use my motivation to be a healthy mom to help me get back in shape.  This DVD is a great start for that.  I have been using it 4-6 times a week and can feel my muscles getting stronger.  It is perfect for house-bound moms (I can't go jogging with a toddler and newborn!).  Jennifer Nicole Lee is very encouraging and it is nice to have someone focusing our motivation on our status as a mom.  It is NOT meant to be a post-natal workout but because the target audience is moms, the encouragement is phrased appropriately (""mommy muscles,"" etc.).  No real equipment needed (if you don't have weights, canned goods honestly work well, or fill plastic soda or water bottles with sand).  The half-hour video (plus my shower afterwards) fits perfectly into my toddler's naptime, and the baby gets to watch mommy look silly.  It is also incredibly inspirational to see someone go from looking the way I look now to looking soooooo hot.  I want that kind of energy for my kids and my husband and this is an easy and fun way to get started.",1225584000,,1163,4.469194312796208
2789691,3,B000O3C510,"First, the good: I first tried this workout 4 weeks after giving birth. I'd describe myself as an intermediate exerciser before pregnancy, and this workout got me sweating, was challenging, and woke up my muscles.  There is also room to grow - as I get stronger, I can go lower into lunges and squats and add more bounce to the cardio sections to continue seeing results.

The not so good: there's nothing at all about this workout that seems to account for new mom status; it's just a regular workout.  There's not even baby-focused encouraging commentary (such as, ""get rid of that mommy tummy"" or ""be strong to lift your baby and not hurt your back.""  Some may like that, but at this point, I'd like some recognition that I'm working out a month after giving birth.  Also, I think the workout is fine if you are pretty familiar with basic workout moves (grapevines, salsa steps, mambo, and kickboxing form) but if you are not, you will not get the instruction you need in how to execute the move at all (much less how to do it safely and effectively).  There is very little guidance as to which muscles you should focus on or how they should feel.  For example, in the cool down, she says ""stretch those muscles"" without identifying which ones.  Most disappointing for me, I found the routine dull.  It is very basic fitness moves.  Nothing new to make it fun or make me want to do it again (other than the general, post-work out endorphins).  Finally, I found her patter mildly annoying.  She keep repeating the same phrases over and over (""you're building the body of your dreams,"" ""we're working smarter not harder,"" etc.).  While this technique is common, it is not well executed here.

Bottom line: if you want a basic cardio/sculpt DVD to work out with and are familiar with common fitness moves, this is fine, but (aside from the title) it is no more a postnatal workout than anything else on the market - not even in its muscle focus.",1221609600,8,1945,4.567723342939481
2789692,5,B000O3C510,"This is a great workout.  The cardio sections really get your heart going, while also providing moves that work specific muscles, and the toning sections really work.  I've seen results in the shape of my body/muscles after doing the workout just 3 times, which is pretty amazing.  (I'm still hoping to get all the way through it without swearing at the television, though.)  I would highly recommend it.",1218585600,,404,4.897058823529412
2789693,5,B000O3C510,i LOVE this video. It works every part of your body! Its easy to keep up with and she doesnt throw too much at you at once. I recommend this to anyone who needs a good body workout and burn some calories!! I sweat my butt off during this workout more than my hip hop abs dvds!!!,1217289600,,278,3.8947368421052633
2789694,4,B000O3C510,"I really like this tape.  I honestly thought I would be getting an easy 30 minute tape for lighter days.  But this tape is truly a workout.  The ONLY reason I didn't rate this a 5 star is because she does too many plies.  It just felt like overkill in one particular area.  But other than that, it was a great workout in 30 minutes.",1209686400,2,332,4.046153846153846
2789695,4,B000O3C510,I really enjoy this workout.  It gives me a good sweat in 30 minutes which is all the time I have being a busy mom.  She says some silly sayings to motivate you to keep going that I could have done without but otherwise a great workout.,1206748800,,236,4.0
2789696,4,B000O3C510,This workout is good. Love the energy of Jennifer Lee. Her story is definitely inspirational. Pretty intense though in parts for someone who is just starting a workout routine.,1206230400,,176,5.103448275862069
2789697,5,B000O3C510,"This was a really great workout fit into a reasonable period of time.  I wasn't sure I'd get a full cardio and toning combo in just 30 minutes, but I really felt I did.  Plus, it was fun.  A little cardio kick boxing, a little dance...but just repetitive enough that makes it easy to follow without being boring.
I'm not sure what the previous negative review is talking about.  I think they are reviewing the wrong product.  She has another DVD that is about exercising with the baby (not this one).  Maybe that's what they are thinking of?  I haven't tried that one.",1202947200,7,568,4.456310679611651
8182725,2,B000O3C510,This video was just not for me. I have to love a work out to stick with it and this just wasn't it.,1446768000,,99,3.347826086956522
8182726,5,B000O3C510,love it,1424563200,,7,3.0
8182727,4,B000O3C510,"This workout is in between easy and challenging. It's basic aerobics, including some latin dance based stuff, and kickboxing stuff. There are three segments (along with a warm up and cool down) and the segments are cardio, followed by strengthening. Jennifer Nicole Lee is likeable. I have a few of her DVDs and I use this one when I'm not feeling like working out. It's only about a half hour, and I get some good strengthening in. I amp it up on my own if I'm feeling ambitious.",1382486400,,480,4.465909090909091
8182728,4,B000O3C510,and am a little out of shape. This video suits my needs perfectly allowing me to get back in shape at a slower pace while still working to tone muscles. I still work up a sweat and maybe this will allow me to work up to some of the harder more strenuous work out videos.,1375056000,,270,3.9272727272727272
8182729,3,B000O3C510,"The exercises themselves are pretty effective. However, the production on this video isn't that great. The music overpowers the instructor's voice so it is sometimes hard to follow the routine. In addition, her cueing is just a few seconds too late so you often miss the first new exercise in a sequence. These two issues are likely not a problem if you are used to the DVD but it can be tough for newbies.",1339459200,,406,4.5
8182730,5,B000O3C510,This fitness DVD is not just for new moms but for anyone who needs motivation for weight loss. JNL Rocks!,1337385600,,105,4.3
8182731,3,B000O3C510,"I have been working out for three months steady(before I did it whenever I had a chance, not consistenly!) and bought this dvd for something new to do. I think you have to be in pretty good shape to start this one. If I had JUST had my baby, not a year ago, I don't think I could do it. And she does ALOT of turning so if you have bad knees, not a good one for you! I also found her to be pretty annoying! I can't stick with dvds when the trainers voice or sayings annoy me! Also she isn't real good with telling you what the next move is, before she is doing it. She goes real quick between moves and if you are a starter, it will be difficult to follow! Jillian Micheals 30Day Shred, level 2 seems easier to me then this, not as hard on the knees and more results in my opinion! All bodies are different though, so this one may work best for you. I have three kids, 4yrs, 2.5yrs, and 1yr so I like quick workouts the yield awesome results! Of course for any exercise program to help, you also need to be eating healthy too. All in all, I think if you stick with this workout, you will get results.",1328140800,2,1099,4.0
8182732,5,B000O3C510,"This dvd is a combo of Leslie Sansone, Prevention's Flat Belly Express, Ellen Barrett's Barefoot Cardio and a little of the Firms.  If you like the pace/type of exercises in the first 3 dvds, you'll like this.

I love the moves, but her cuing isn't the best.  I'd have taken off .5 a star if I could have for that.

I haven't been a new mom in 20 years, so anyone can benefit from this.

I could almost use Fabulously Fit Grandmas. Lol.",1290988800,,436,4.204819277108434
8182733,4,B000O3C510,"Apparently I'm extremely out of shape...I used to be able to do way more than this for a lot longer, so after I received the DVD I watched it so I could see what it was like...I do this with all workout videos. I thought...this shouldn't be a problem...I knew I was out of shape but it looked really easy. I have an 8 month old and I'm trying to get back into working out. This is the first time I did the video...I only made it 20 minutes into the video...it's still playing as I write this. I can tell that if you're really out of shape and haven't worked out in a while this will give you a nice workout to start getting back into things...I have no doubt that you'll get used to it quick, be able to do it no problem in a short time...you'll be ready to move onto something else more challenging. You'll probably drop a few lbs and tone up a bit but I really don't think it will give you maximum results if you have a lot of weight to lose, like me. Like I said...it will be good to get back into the groove of things but you'll quickly want to move onto something else that will give you more results. Like Slim in 6 from Beachbody...I bought that right after I had my son and about 2 months after he was born I started that program...I had a lot of trouble that first day but I was able to push through it...I only did the program for 4 days and didn't lose any weight but I had lost 2 inches in my waist and 1.5 inches in my hips...so I knew it was working but I got sick and skipped a couple days and got off track...I've gained weight since then that's why I wanted to start off with something more simple...then get back to Slim in 6. Overally, it's a good starter, but not for long.",1285545600,2,1693,4.026706231454006
8182734,5,B000O3C510,This is a really good workout for a beginner.  Jennifer Nicole Lee is great.  The steps are very easy to do and not at all complicated.  All around good beginners workout.,1280707200,,171,4.451612903225806
