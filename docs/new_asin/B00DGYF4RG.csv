5798440,5,B00DGYF4RG,In just a couple of hours you get a very close look to a timeline of the environmental movement of the last decades.,1383264000,8,116,4.086956521739131
5798441,4,B00DGYF4RG,"""A Fierce Green Fire,"" a documentary in five acts, chronicles the history of the environmental movement, beginning in the early years of the 20th Century and running through the present day.

Written and directed by Mark Kitchell, the movie, based on the book by Phillip Shabecoff, divides its subject into sections entitled ""Conservation,"" ""Pollution,"" ""Alternatives,"" ""Going Global"" and ""Climate Change,"" each hosted by a different narrator (Robert Redford, Ashley Judd, Van Jones, Isabelle Allende, Meryl Streep, respectively). The movie provides a fascinating and informative survey of the people and events that, for more than a hundred years, have helped to raise the world's consciousness regarding the harm humans are inflicting on nature and the planet. More importantly, the movie shows that people can achieve great things against nearly impossible odds when they work together in a common cause. It also illustrates how the environmental movement and the social justice movement dovetailed over time into a single entity.

By interviewing many of the movers and shakers over the decades who have dedicated their lives to preserving the environment, the movie functions as an indispensable time capsule for future generations to see how people were able to rise up and make a difference. However, the movie also makes it clear that there is still a great deal more that needs to be done, particularly in the areas of global warming and climate change. And here is where the film turns much more pessimistic, pointing out the many seemingly intractable obstacles to rational action that have been thrown up by industrial, governmental and right wing ideological forces, particularly in the United States, since the 1980s. Yet, despite this gloomy assessment, the fight continues, as people of good faith and intentions storm the barricades of entrenched money and power to do battle in a just cause.

""A Fierce Green Fire"" is a must-see both for those who lived through and participated in those tumultuous times - sometimes at the risk of their own lives - as well as for those more recent inhabitants of the planet who are reaping the rewards of their forebears' commitment and effort. But, as the movie also keeps telling us, there is still so much more to do.",1381017600,19,2273,5.154471544715447

A creek that ran through my backyard in the 1950 providing habitat for wildlife and paradise for boys like me as been absolutely destroyed. It is gone; diverted into a paved ditch half a mile away that only runs in the winter. That was, by today's standards, an eco-crime.

5798450,5,B00DGYF4RG,"Prior to this documentary, the debate centering on environmentalism has often been between warring factions which make the Wars of the Roses of the 15th century look tame by comparison. Each vilifies the other. The more conservative (ironically) who believe in complete free enterprise and capitalism without hindrance have labeled the environmentalists quacks and anti-capitalistic, and therefore ""Un-American"". Particularly figures like James Watt who was the Secretary of the Interior from 1981 to 1983 under the Reagan Administration felt that environmentalists were delusional in their perspectives, prompting Reagan to say of them ""They won't be happy to until the Whitehouse is a bird's nest"", which is of course wasn't true at all. Simultaneously, some ""Green"" activists have accused capitalists of being beholden to only moneyed and corporate interests. Corporations have argued that high regulation of business will stifle the free market and compromise jobs and incomes. The ""Greens"" have argued that if we destroy our planet's habitability, through Global Warming, we will have no planet upon which to exist and create, be it housing, cars, or corporations, etc. If the human species is extinct, there will be no capitalism in other words.

Strangely, prior to 2012, there hadn't been a documentary which tells the full tale of the environmentalist movement, why they came to believe what they believe, and why they have protested as vehemently as they have. Films like ""An Inconvenient Truth"" have successfully made the case why Global Warming threatens the existence of the Earth but there hadn't been a film explaining the history of the movement. ""A Fierce Green Fire"" has filled the gap. This film explains where the movement came from and why it continues today.

The film is divided into five parts: Act 1, The history of Conservation beginning with the origins of the Sierra Club, headed by John Muir in the 19th century and later David Bower in the mid-20th. Act 2, the pollution of the 1970's including demonstrations against toxic waste. Act 3, Green Peace and their exploits to save the whales. Act 4, the fights against the destruction of natural resources such as the Amazon Rain Forests. Act 5, Global Warming.

Despite popular belief, the Environmentalist Movement did not begin in the 1960's with hippie radicals on the Haight-Asbury in San Francisco. It began as early as the 19th century when birds with beautiful plumage were disappearing because they were being hunted and killed for the plumage adorning ladies' hats. A group formed to save these birds from extinction. Shortly thereafter, John Muir fought against the construction of dams which would destroy the habitats of many wildlife areas west of the Mississippi. Families of the mid-west who probably had never been involved in environmentalism before engaged themselves in the debate when their children were becoming and ill and even dying as a result of toxic waste. And the threat of Global Warming is recapped, extending what Al Gore had accomplished in his documentary 10 years earlier.

The view of the documentary is certainly from a particular bias, but at the same time, I think it does a reasonably good job of not vilifying the other side unless that side deserves it. Most political anti-environmentalists didn't believe there was a real problem, and the conventional wisdom prior to circa 1960 was that environments could and should be compromised in favor of ""progress"". Many people until President Reagan began to sign onto the Environmentalist cause, but this shifted under Reagan, particularly with the appointment of James Watt who wanted the country to drill more and more no matter where and how.

A very professionally-made documentary as good as any PBS documentary being produced today. The talents of several Hollywood heavy-hitters narrate the film, such as Robert Redford, Ashley Judd, and Meryl Streep. Even Isabelle Allende lends her voice to one of the segments. My only hope is that it doesn't just speak to the choir but encourages those on the fence, and maybe even the other side, to take a look at this very real issue. The truth is, if we don't have a world, nothing else really matters that much. I don't want cock roaches to be the only occupants of deserted cities in a few hundred years.",1420761600,6,4319,5.120567375886525
5798451,5,B00DGYF4RG,"As dire things are, this movie showed me that there might be some hope ! I don't know were our Mother Earth would be today without all this wonderful organizations that fight for us. I've been a supporter of numerous environmental organizations for decades, this movie showed me why, thanks Greenpeace, WWF and so on !!!!!!",1420156800,,323,4.785714285714286
5798452,5,B00DGYF4RG,"A Fierce Green Fire is one of the finest, and most effective, documentaries on the environmental movement I've ever seen.  Comprehensive, colorful, replete with excellent music, trenchant commentary, and stunning visuals, this film should be required viewing in every school and college in the US.  It covers the importance and contributions of environmental heroes like John Muir, David Brower, Rachel Carson, Lois Gibbs and Chico Mendes, as well as the activities and determination of organizations like the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, and 350.org.  The section on Greenpeace is amazing, and the coverage of the tragedy of Love Canal is leavened by the hilarious tactic of Lois Gibbs and her fellow housewives taking EPA officials hostage until the federal government agreed to pay to relocate the families who had taken up residence, unknowingly, on one of the most toxic dump sites in the country.  One of the best aspects of the film is its ability to convey the passion and determination of people who want not only to save nature from greedy human enterprises, but also to save humanity itself from its own worst impulses.

The last part of the film deals with the effects and harrowing challenge of Climate Change, and is so well done that Climate Change deniers everywhere should be forced to watch it.  Of course, most of them won't.  Nonetheless, A Fierce Green Fire is a first-rate documentary that provides not only the history of the conservation, preservation, and deep ecology movements in America, but also branches out in its later sections to give us a global perspective on the planet's current ecological dilemmas.  And it does not have a happy ending, as the fate of the earth, and humanity's very existence, is still very much in doubt.  But this is a splendid film that should be used to spur discussions about environmental matters everywhere.",1418428800,2,1865,5.04885993485342

5798462,4,B00DGYF4RG,"One can appreciate the early history of the environmental movement.  However, as the video points out, there is increasing difficulty of the challenges.  So, do the tactics of the 1960s still hold true today?  The video concludes with imagery of several hundred small community groups taking on challenges.  This is a ""feel good"" solution but I'm doubtful that industrial billionaires in China, Russia, and the other BRIC countries pay attention to protestors.  There are extreme and immoral people who are cutting down, bulldozing, and draining rainforests over in Indonesia, Brazil, and the Congo.  It will take UN Peacekeepers, armed, to stop them.  Endangered species and the climate system depend on protected those areas and developing substitutes for tropical wood.  We are very late in this effort and the rainforest losses are not reversing.  Grassroots efforts need to eventually change national government policy, the UN, and make ecology security a matter of national security, taken seriously.",1400630400,,1006,5.438709677419355

5798465,4,B00DGYF4RG,"Robert Redford and Meryl Streep have compiled a watchable documentary surrounding the formative relationship to the ecological movement.  I purchased in hopes to further the discovery surrounding my fathers participation within the formative social economic environmental circle.  My father had hired on to begin formulative developments of the EPA, 1967.

As a Federal Government employee, he progressed concern and science-governmental action for the agency, our Pacific NW Water Pollution Control.  He was an economist and administrator, in Oregon.  He worked as a Federal Governmental employee until 1967.  He got the call to economically and scientifically lead the formation of the EPA.  The EPA was a brain child of Nixon.  My father performed as hired but Nixon created his own noose with Water Gate.  My dad resigned prior to the Water Gate affair due opposing political and economic views.

My father believed in sustainable green economics, enough said.  His economics were not, what would become attributed to Milton Friedmans Neoliberal economicsdestroying labor wage value, liberating investment markets to destroy American manufacturing via Asian 1% investments.  Nor was MF generally concerned with environmental degradation (due mass contrivance toward social ignorance about our environment.)  Milton Friedman believed in liberating tax cuts for the wealthy to invest withan activity to outsource 1% investments which destroy American manufacturing jobs.  The derivative will become opportune as the associative relationship with real estate as the reason for the (planned) market collapse.  Liberalized Milton Friedman economics produce home sales today, losses from the labor class, and formations from the bubble market design.  The real estate collapse will be labeled as the catalyst, taking the blame to labor purchases contrived by the capitalist banking.

My father might have felt mandates toward environmental concern were as necessary as cigarette tax, gas tax, and alcohol tax, all means to curb our consumption of pollutants.  He saw the economic as an environmentalist.

Years later, my assessment in college is: my father observed Nixon killing thorium nuclear reactor funding, circa 1970-71.  A design that had been up and running for five years and for 80% of the time, via two test reactors.  (Thorium reactors are not pressurized reactors and thorium fuel is safe to hold in a naked hand, (today: Kurt Sorenson, filbe.))  Two test reactors had safely and effectively run for 80% of the time, for five years.  Nixon went to Hanford and Burbank CA to speak of a great new science, nuclear breeder reactors, fueled by plutonium and/or uranium, not thorium.  Nixons timing was in promotion of job creation for nuclear scientists (votes) and the formative attraction he was drawing to his upcoming Presidential campaign, the Republican Party.  He killed the funding for the thorium fueled reactors and fed that funding into the American war machine, via GE and the uranium and plutonium fuel based breeder reactors.

My dads past performance was not mentioned in the documentary, therefore a four star rating.

I would purchase this documentary again, in consideration of my interests and personal search for data.

What I was looking for is a way to show my current high school biology students the fusion of the environmental movement with social justice and sustainability.  I wish this movie had featured so many more people of color, and more nationalities than it did.  I also worry this movie will be too dry for them.  I think I'll try it anyway, unless you have better ideas.

What really grates on me that my students have absorbed an incredibly misanthropic view of people - that people are a cancer, that we are toxic, that we are parasites or a disease, and that the world is ruined and beyond saving.  I don't know where this comes from because I know their elementary school teachers and middle school teachers and that is NOT the message coming from the school - it's like a meme that exists as a virus that hijacks any positive view of our world, other people, or the ability to see solutions.  So I do really appreciate Paul Hawken's words at the end where he says there are 2 million grassroots environmental movements world wide, and that this is more than a movement, and perhaps could be seen as an immune response.  I read his book Blessed Unrest a number of years ago.
