7022521,5,B00TT963HC,Great documentary on black economic empowerment!!,1461456000,2,49,7.333333333333333
7022522,5,B00TT963HC,"Excellent documentary!!! It completely changed my way of thinking. We live in a capitalistic society, so due to this, everything starts with economics in order to participate in different aspects of life. Politics, media, health, etc. it all starts with economics. Angry about Brooklyn DA Ken Thompsons  allowing people to be killed and only receive community service as punishment and he himself advocating that the officer should serve no jail time? Understand that blacks did not fund his political campaign so he felt he had nothing to lose for his future political aspirations.  Knowing this what can be done? Well this excellent documentary provides compelling evidence that a lot of behavior that people don't like can be traced back to a money trail. You can't create your own money trail if you have no money. 7AM advocates group economics and business ownership to improve the living conditions of the people. Why? Because true wealth and therefore empowerment comes from ownership in a capitalistic society. Teach your kids and yourself about starting a business and investing, not just about going to school to get educated to work a job for someone else.",1461196800,13,1167,5.104712041884817

My only gripe was that I paid $35.99 but was sent a movie product list from the vendor with this title on it and it was $24.99. It's all good though as it was worth every penny! Also, the customer service was excellent as the product arrived VERY quickly, and the owner/employee of the shop sent a personalized hand written ""thank you"" note, which these days is non-existent and I found it to be a very nice touch. I will def order from them again if I find more products to purchase. Please check out this documentary as this is an eye opener and wake up call for us peeps to get our stuff together, myself included....

Please give this a shot and purchase while available. Also check out some reading material from some of the honorable mentions in the film.",1433980800,22,875,4.537974683544304
