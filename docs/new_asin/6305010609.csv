949293,3,6305010609,"The film is banal in all its components except one. Boris Karloff is so old that he cannot act at the level the film requires. The story is in no way imaginative and creative. But the film is also the debut of Jack Nicholson and anyone who is interested in this actor will rush on this film because Jack Nicholson is still pure, naive and malleable. We recognize his voice and some of his intonations that will become famous in later films. It is always interesting to see the birth of a great actor, even if the film is not exactly enhancing his value.

949294,3,6305010609,"For some reason, I like this film.  It had atmosphere, a deserted castle, lightening and thunder, and Boris Karloff.  The price of the ""Master Movie"" edition for this DVD is unbeatable, but then you're not getting wide screen, which is a let down.  But as far as I know, there are, at this time, no wide screen editions of ""The Terror"" on DVD or VHS.  However, the picture quality is great, and sound quality is acceptable.  I'm really disappointed, though, not to see more of the Poe classic Corman films on DVD, yet, in wide screen, of course.  A better buy, though a little more expensive, is ""Tales of Terror"".

949386,3,6305010609,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

I remember the first time I ever saw THE TERROR. It was an English class about mystery writers. Why the teacher ever chose this movie as a great example of that Ill never know, unless of course it was the only thing available in his budget. That being said the truth is that I is a fun movie and a great example of the Roger Corman school of film making. If you have access to a star, sets and some film stock left, make a complete feature fast!

With Boris Karloff still available having just shot THE RAVEN for Corman as well as sets still standing from his film THE HAUNTD PALACE, Corman paid Leo Gordon $1,600 to write a script and the main portions of the film that contained Karloff were shot in 3 days. Additional footage was shot by Corman and a young man he employed at the time named Francis Ford Coppola as well as footage shot by Monte Hellman, Jack Hill and Jack Nicholson who also starred in the film. The end result is considered by most to be one of Cormans worst efforts but the truth is its not all that bad.

Nicholson stars as Lt. Andre Duvalier, a soldier in the Napoleonic wars who has lost his way and stumbles upon a young woman named Helen (Shirley Knight) on the beach. She disappears and when he wakes he finds himself in a cabin in the woods where an old woman and her servant live. They help him and send him to the castle on the hill owned by Baron Von Leppe (Karloff). Duvalier arrives at the castle and forces his way in demanding shelter from the Baron. The Baron agrees and has his manservant Stefan (Dick Miller) help the Lt.

While talking to the Baron, Duvalier is shown a portrait of the Barons late wife Ilsa. She is a duplicate for young Helene who helped him the day before. The Baron informs him that she has been dead for many years now. As the story progresses Duvalier continues to see Helene/Ilsa roaming the castle and nearby tombs. He later finds out that Ilsa had a lover named Eric that the Stefan killed while the Baron killed Ilsa. Now she haunts and torments him from the grave and the only relief will be in his demise.

Ghosts, Barons, hauntings and lost love meld together to make a film that while not the best thing Corman ever made doesnt truly qualify as his worst. His use of already standing sets and actors to put together a film is something that few is any directors these days would attempt. Nicholson holds his own in one of his earliest performances, perhaps not displaying the prowess that would garner him an Oscar later in life but showing he was at least making the attempt to work at his craft. Karloff does an excellent job, even more so when you consider his age at the time.

As with several other titles Ive received from them recently, this is another public domain title that The Film Detective has determined deserved the blu-ray treatment. That being the case youll find that this is one of the best prints around of this film. Many offer it but few in this degree of quality, keeping in mind it was not the most well preserved film to begin with. Its nice to see a company want to keep films like these from disappearing even if they aren't the cream of the crop for some viewers. Kudos to The Film Detective for keeping this movie alive.

Heres a suggestion. Plan movie parties for Friday nights where you screen two features like this film, movies that were created with the sole purpose of playing the drive in circuit. Some popcorn, hot dogs and a soda or two while you sit and enjoy or laugh at whats on screen make for a fun night. Who knows, maybe drive-in parties will take hold. This movie is a good start to those sort of nights.",1471132800,,3677,4.3591240875912405

949453,5,6305010609,"I first saw The Terror when it played at the old Dominion theater here in Vancouver back in 1964.  I vividly remember what a terrible print of the film I saw; even then it was scratched and faded.  Over the years I've seen it on TV, on video tape, laser disc and DVD.  Every format was a huge disappointment.  Each kept promising better video quality, but they all lied.  They must have all been using the same crappy third generation VHS dupe, and it just got worse each time.  Finally about two months ago I purchased the HD Cinema Classics edition from Amazon.  I put it into my DVD player, sat back and waited for another disappointment.  The movie started with the beloved American International logo and then we got the opening scene with Boris Karloff walking the halls of his castle.  And from that scene to the end of the film I was glued to my TV.  This was the FIRST TIME that I had watched the film and discovered that he was following a blood trail!  Whoever did the restoration work on this film obviously loves the film.  I don't think that it has EVER looked this good!  Wonderful job!

Otherwise, there's just Boris the Baron and his sidekick/butler/all-purpose-killer Stefan (Dick Miller) occupying the big house on the hill.  There's a witch in the woods, naturally.  Some doomsday guy who wanders around giving bad advice (Jonathan Haze as Gustaf).  And last, but certainly least, there's Jack Nicholson unconvincingly playing a French soldier, Andre Duvalier.  Obviously, Corman forgot to tell Jack that this was a period piece, not just a costume party.  He was not doing okay even before he put on the stupid hat.  At least Jack got to play opposite his pregnant wife Sandra Knight (Helene/Ilsa).  Things did not end well for them in every regard!

I like this movie because it is a bit dopey.  I like that everyone, with the obvious exception of Jack, got into the spirit of the thing and made the most of a bad idea perpetrated by the ever consistent Roger Corman.

949491,3,6305010609,"It makes sense that THE TERROR is more Boris Karloff's vehicle than it is Jack Nicholson's, seeing as how it came out in 1963, a period in which Jack was still trying to make a name for himself. Jack Nicholson plays Andre Duvalier, a French lieutenant in Napoleon's army who, in 1806, was separated from his regiment. We first catch a glimpse of him as he slowly negotiates a beach on his horse, parched and low spirited. When he espies a mysterious girl (Sandra Knight), he eventually - after getting sidetracked in an old hag's hut - tracks her to the castle of the reclusive Baron Victor von Leppe. ""I'm a weary, disillusioned soldier, and you're the only pleasant sight that I've seen in seven months."" Pretty words coming out of his mouth, and the girl laughs at this, and you think there's a lucky fella. But once he reaches the castle and you identify Karloff as the Baron, you know in your bones that Nicholson, poor man, is in for a very bad time.

It's produced and directed by Roger Corman, and so you understand the schlock factor and the limitations that go with that. THE TERROR is a pretty unnerving tale... if you were watching it in 1963. Today, the scares come off as fairly tame, the shocking moments don't quite tingle that old spine. It won't make you cower like Nicholson's later and more disturbing film did, THE SHINING, which is Jack's opus in terror. Still, credit this B-movie for mustering and sustaining a foreboding atmosphere. When young Andre falls in love with that girl he'd followed, and when he learns that she may be possessed by dark forces, there's nothing but for him to brave the ominous castle. It's immediately evident that the old Baron is a deeply private man, yet age-old proprieties dictate that he welcomes Andre as a guest. Andre promptly begins nosing around and is soon exposed to spooky happenings. My rule of thumb in such situations: When there's spooky stuff in the house, get out of the house. I don't know, sometimes, love just ain't worth it, man.

I relished THE TERROR for the curio piece that it is. It certainly didn't make me jump. There isn't much of the Jack Nicholson we'll come to know and love. He was a young actor back then and probably minding his P's and Q's and still learning his craft. There's none of that sense of danger he normally exuded, the sense that, uh oh, this guy is gonna do something unpredictable any minute now. Jack in this movie plays the conventional male lead in a horror picture. He's square-jawed and brave and he perseveres. It's actually really interesting, given the contrast to the memorable anti-hero parts Jack'll pull in later in his career. Karloff plays it to the hilt as the weary, broken-hearted, old Baron who keenly pines away for his lost love. A lost love who's come back as a disquieting haunt. It's a strange love triangle. It could never end well. There is also a witch, possibly wicked, possibly nursing an agenda, hovering in the periphery. She may have cackled once or twice. There is also a fearsome attacking bird that Hitchcock, if he'd seen it, would've promptly sicced on Tippi Hedren.",1360800000,,3107,4.647272727272727

The Terror in my opinion it is not in the same caliber as his other 60's offerings such as The Masque of the Red Death or Tales of Terror, but with that being said it was still an enjoyable movie.  The film offers solid performances from Boris Karloff and Jack Nicholson although the story can be slow at times.

949541,1,6305010609,"Some people just can't mind their own business.

It's 1806 and Lt. Andre Duvalier (played by a 26-year-old Jack Nicholson), a soldier in the French army, has been separated from his regiment. He winds up on a beach somewhere where he meets a mysterious woman who says her name is Helene (Sandra Knight, Nicholson's then-wife). After the woman vanishes, Duvalier is attacked by a bird and passes out. When he wakes, he finds himself in the shack of Katrina, an old woman who insists there is no woman named Helene. Her son Gustav, however, indicates otherwise and prompts Duvalier to seek the truth in the castle of Baron von Leppe (Boris Karloff).

Duvalier makes his way to the castle, but finds the Baron no more forthcoming than the old woman. And the Baron's valet Stefan is a big roadblock as well.

Determined to get to the bottom of the mysterious woman--literally, as it seems the only thing Duvalier truly wants is some action--the lieutenant stops at nothing to uncover every secret of the Castle von Leppe, even if it means damnation for all involved.

You know, you think you've got a good thing going. Your checkered past is where it belongs, in the past, and you're doing a good job of putting it all behind you. You're not hurting anyone. And then one day some stranger bursts in and, without so much as a by-your-leave, proceeds to tear down every wall you've built to keep those secrets hidden. Just to satisfy his libido.

As it happens, Helene is really Ilsa, the Baronness von Leppe, whom the Baron himself killed twenty years earlier when he returned unannounced from the war and found her with her lover, Eric. However, as Duvalier later discovers, even that isn't the end of the story. Soon Katrina's motives, Helene's desire, and Stefan's secrets are all revealed as the crypt beneath the castle floods, leaving the Baron with his guilt and his tortured soul.

THE TERROR? Only if you intend to make me sit through it again, because I will hurt you. It's so hard to imagine this movie was made with any serious intent. Then again, it's a Roger Corman movie, made on the heels of his movie THE RAVEN, using the same sets and actors, filmed in only a few days because, well, he had the sets and the actors for a few days more, why not shoot another movie?

The result answers that question for itself. THE TERROR is all the proof you need that, just because you've got the resources at hand, doesn't mean you need to make a movie. What's worse, there are FIVE directors credited with this movie (only Corman appears in the credits, but apparently he had help from Monte Hellman--now that's a cool name, HELLMAN!--Jack Hill--one of the ""writers"" of this thing--as well as Jack Nicholson and friggin' Francis Ford Coppola). Five directors? That's gotta be some sort of typo, because I was hard pressed to find evidence of even one director. For large chunks of the movie, I got the feeling the cameraman hit record and sat back to have a sandwich and only happened to get a few shots of people running through a dry--and I mean DRY--read. This movie was obviously made before Nicholson had taken up acting, and apparently long after Karloff had given it up. Honestly, I half-expected the credits to be chock full of Alan Smithees. With FRANKENSTEIN and THE SHINING on their respective resumes, Karloff and Nicholson are horror legends. THE TERROR begs the question whether that's a genre-wide distinction or just a case of these actors having happened to make two very popular horror movies, because there is absolutely no spark of greatness from either in this movie.

Nicholson's Duvalier is not only wooden, but also a very unlikable character. He's intrusive, arrogant, nosey. He spends the majority of the movie skulking around Castle von Leppe, going through rooms, searching every corner and cranny, even refusing to leave when he's ordered to--TWICE!

And the dialogue these people spout. Sweet Christmas!

Here's an excerpt I took from IMDB between Duvalier and Helene:

Helene: The crypt! It must be destroyed, and with it the dead.
Andre: Don't speak of the dead anymore. You're with me now.
Helene: I am possessed of the dead.
Andre: You're a warm living woman. Who has told you these things?
Helene: The dead.

Now read it again, only this time remove any indication of emotion or wakefulness and you'll get a clue as to the delivery the actors gave. Try taking a valium before you read it, that ought to help.

I know better than to watch a Roger Corman movie with anything other than the least of expectations, but come on. At least CREATURE FROM THE HAUNTED SEA was funny, and it seemed intentional. THE TERROR's not even that. It's just 81 minutes of BOR-RING!!!

A horror classic? That depends on what kind of influence it may have had on what came after it. Considering it's been said that even the crap is educational because it teaches you what not to do, then, sure I can see THE TERROR having some kind of influence; what filmmaker in their right mind would ever want to make something resembling this? However, if you're talking honest horror genre influence, as in people saw it and, not only wanted more just like it, but wanted to be responsible for making it, then no, I can't see that.",1343952000,2,5234,4.699781659388647
949542,2,6305010609,"Code Red has once again opened the nuclear waste vaults of video rental outlets and pulled out two titles few, if any, have heard of: School Girls In Chains (aka Let's Play Dead) and Terror Circus.

Terror Circus (aka Barn of the Naked Dead)

  Andrew Prine heads this all star cast of nobodies as Andre, a man who is so pissed at being denied the position of Head Elephant Crap Shoveler for Ringling Brothers that he starts kidnapping women off the side of the road and from highway rest stops to star as attractions for his very own circus. Seriously, who needs clowns and trapeze artists when you got women being mauled by Andrew's pet mountain lion or being fed to his pet python? He even has his own security guard in the form of a hulking dude in bad pancake makeup to keep the girls in line.

  This movie is really pointless and both the acting and directing is abysmal at best. The ending doesn't even make a lot of sense either on why the girl does what she does to her fellow captives. The only extra feature here is the film's trailer minus any lines of dialogue and replaced by some cheesey song straight out of the 70s. A statement from Code Red states that the original audio track was lost to time yet the trailer can be seen (and HEARD) in its entirety on Code Red's The Unseen. Avoid unless you seriously are fighting your inner misogynist or if you really hate yourself.

School Girls In Chains (aka Let's Play Dead)

  This movie doesn't fair much better than Terror Circus but it does have the benefit of having two fairly (and perhaps unintentional) comical commentaries as well as a lot of so bad its good moments. It stars Gary Kent. He and his mentally challenged brother are on the prowl looking for a few new hotties to join their harrem of sex slaves. And once their services are no longer required, Kent just pops them off with his high power rifle. Eventually they take the wrong girl and her uncaring boyfriend (Stafford Morgan before Die Hard) goes to look for her which puts a huge damper on the brothers' games.

  As stated before, this movie's only saving grace comes in the form of the commentaries. One has Kent and some moderator while the other has said moderator, the director, and some failed rap artist (why?). The commentaries provide a lot of laughs such as Kent trying to put his rape scene of a young girl up there with the likes of STRAW DOGS or how the ""lead girl"" was such a b*tch to work with that, after the love scene when the director yelled Cut!, Stafford literally threw her off of him and dove off the bed.  In another scene, you see one of the playmates trying to make good her escape and you suddenly hear what sounds like a bad studio audience shouting out ""Run! Run! Run!"" just out of the blue; no explanation why. And, as usual in these exploitation flicks in an attempt to sympathize with Frank and his brother on why they do what they do, there's a flashback and we find that Kent's character's Frank's first and only sex partner up until the raped girl was dear old Mom. This one is only watchable if viewed with one of the commentaries.  Otherwise some movies are better left in some forgotten vaults and never seen again; these are just two of them.

Game Over!",1335571200,,3228,4.434856175972927
949543,4,6305010609,"Roger Corman's late night staple, THE TERROR (1963), has had a curious reputation. Despite its several assets - Boris Karloff in one of his last starring roles, Jack Nicholson in one of his first, a rather interesting story, and an atmospheric music score - the film is often dismissed as one of Corman's lesser works. This is mostly due to the lousy prints that have been circulating for years, which obscured the true merits of this low-budget gem.

HD Cinema Classics' Blu-ray/DVD combo pack restores THE TERROR's rich colors and clears up its soundtrack so that it virtually plays like a different film. One can now better appreciate the strange premise dealing with the utter desperation of a French soldier (Nicholson), separated from his regiment, who is determined to discover the secret of a reclusive baron (Karloff) and a mysterious young woman (Sandra Knight). The whole thing maintains an effective eerieness, appropriately punctuated by pealing thunder, crashing waves and an ominously looming castle.

Due to a tight production schedule, Corman had to delegate some of the direction to his assistants Francis Ford Coppola and Jack Hill, and even Jack Nicholson helmed a few scenes.

If you think you know THE TERROR, you need to see it looking like this. It'll change your mind and make you realize what a good little movie it really is.",1334534400,3,1352,5.0

Yes, there are a few scenes that seem soft and fuzzy (perhaps due to DNR, yes) but the rest of the movie looks stunning, a HUGE upgrade from all of the public domain DVD's that have floated around throughout the years.  So if you're on the fence about adding this cult classic to your blu-ray collection due to the other reviews, hopefully you'll be swayed by mine.",1328486400,3,524,4.326530612244898
949546,4,6305010609,"Roger Corman`s The Terror has been in public domain for half of forever.  The result, predictably, has been a plethora of DVD prints, ranging from wretched to execrable.  It is a legendary film that his its equal share of fans and detractors.  The Terror marks the only time Boris Karloff actually ""starred"" in a film directed by Corman (The Raven-1963, does not really count, as Karloff was secondary to Vincent Price). How much of the movie Corman directed is debatable.  Francis Ford Coppola, Monte Hellman, Jack Hill, Jack Nicholson, and Dick Miller are all reported to have directed parts of The Terror, although only Corman is credited.

The story behind the film is well known.  Corman had finished shooting The Raven ahead of schedule and still had Karloff on contract for four days.  Not one to waste money, Corman whipped up a second movie starring the actor.  Part of the myth regarding this film is that it was made in its entirety in 48 hrs.  Actually, Karloff's scenes were shot in three to four days.  Corman utilized the castle set from the first film, later scenes were added, and the entire movie was produced over a nine month period, which is something like an epic for Corman.  Corman, of course, masterfully sculpts his own mythology, but filming commenced without a finished script, and that is probably why it took so long to pull something halfway salable out of it.  It's not really an advisable filmmaking method.

The Terror has finally been released in a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack, and has rightfully received accolades for the remastering on the Blu-ray.  Unfortunately,the DVD part of the combo has had a high number of reported defects.  Regardless, the film looks beautiful in the Blu-ray transfer, rich with 1960s colors.  It finally looks nearly as good here as the excerpts we see of it in the Corman produced Targets (1968-dir. Peter Bogdanovich).  The transfer made me long to see The Terror on a drive-in cinema screen.

Seeing this film in a watchable print does reveal some merits. Besides the vibrant Gothic milieu, the film has an energetic score by Ronald Stein.  Jack Nicholson, while not the actor he would become, is better as an arrogant soldier than he was as the whiny son of the equally whiny Vincent Price in The Raven.  Another high point here is the very good performance by Boris Karloff.  It is unfortunate that Corman did not get to work with Karloff more than he did, because the actor might have been better suited to this director than was Price.  In the Poe-cycle Corman films, Price often projects a grating self-pity.  While Karloff was also a screen personality that audiences sympathized with, he was able to convey pathos in a less hand-wringing way.

As far as the script, it is surprisingly somewhat coherent for something that was slapped together.  Nicholson is Lt. Andre Duvalier, a soldier in Napoleon's army.  Inexplicably, he gets separated from his regiment.  He sees a mysterious, beautiful woman (Sandra Knight).  He is told her name is Helene, and he attempts to follows her  into the sea.  Duvalier believes that she has committed suicide.  He is attacked by a large bird and wakes up in the home of the old witch Katrina (Dorothy Neumann) and her mute henchman Gustaf ( Jonathan Haze).  Duvalier's search for Helene leads him to the castle of  Baron Victor Von Leppe (Karloff) who lives alone there with his servant Stefan (Dick Miller).  The Baron has a painting of Ilsa, his wife, dead now twenty years.  Shockingly (?), Ilsa looks exactly like Helene.  The nobleman has a black secret and a predictable revelation is in store, along with an unpredictable twist.

The opening sequence of Karloff descending down the castle stairs in the night is stylistically shot.  He opens a door and a skeleton pops out.  Animated birds of dread soar through the credits, enhancing the flavor.  Nicely done; except for those who prefer a coherent narrative, because there is no hidden skeleton in the film.  In this, The Terror is a bit like the pulp comic book covers which show a potentially exciting scene that never actually occurs in the story.  Not being religiously attached to linear yarn spinning, I liked the sequence.  Sandra Knight (Nicholson's wife at the time) as the ghost of Ilsa, is beautiful, obviously pregnant in several scenes, and a distractingly bad actress.  Neumann and Haze have contagious fun with their roles.

A so-called spoiler alert (although it's a bit nonsensical to have a spoiler alert for a fifty year old film, but in that in that I am keeping with the nonsensical spirit of The Terror): twenty years ago the Baron murdered Ilsa when he caught her bedding down the peasant Eric.  That's a big no surprise.  Stefan disposed of Eric.  The ghost of Ilsa is exacting revenge via Katrina, who is Eric's mother.  Stefan unloads the one genuine twist: actually, he killed the Baron and Eric has taken the nobleman's place for the last twenty years.  That narrative bit will doubtfully sit well with the unimaginative reality-check geeks who will be quick to point out that Karloff's Eric is at least thirty years older than his ""mother,"" portrayed by Neumann.

Karloff excels in the confrontation finale.  Ilsa is coercing Eric into suicide (so they can be joined together in the abode of the damned).  Eric resists, fearing eternal damnation, but finally consents with thinly veiled resignation masking glee.  Karloff does the scene justice.  Earlier, he is as good at menacingly evading Duvalier's inquiries.

The finale is everything you would expect in this kind of product: a flooded castle (with a really bad double for Karloff) and a corpse which melts after a kiss (Sandra Knight, after Jack plants one on his wife's lips).  The special effects add up to what looks like a gallon of butterscotch syrup poured onto her face.

Still, the legend behind this film is just plain fun, even if it's more myth than fact, even it's more product than art, even if it's more entrepreneur Corman than craftsman Corman. And, hell there is Karloff!  So, if anyone within close vicinity has one of those massive TV screens and a disc of drive-in snack bar commercials, then I have got The Terror and the pizza, and we'll imagine it's 1963 all over again.",1325808000,5,6244,4.841359773371105
949547,5,6305010609,"This is a low budget flick from the early sixties. I love these movies, nonfans might rate them a two or one star. But I say that cheape horror has it's own rating system that doesn't crossover to a list and other movies.  This is probably a three star on that low budget rating system of mine.  It's a movie of it's time and the effects were fine for the period. The movie is what it is, a ultra quickie from roger corman and it's fun enough. But the remastering is excellent. THose who complain about a soft image don't see that most of these older movies never had much clarity and this even has lots of stock footage in it. But unlike many a movies which look shredded on blu ray. ""little big man"" , 'the horse soldiers"" and 'rio lobo' , or 'kellys heroes' which has dust and dirt on it. The went frame by frame here and cleaned this movie up, It's been in such a bad state for so many yeats that I could barely watch it. NOw it's in great shape! This needs to be done with all trashed up movies on blu ray. ANd even later movies than this are on blu and look like crap with lines in them. ""Time bandits' is one of those.  The picture is not so soft nor so crisp because it never was that crisp to begin with. This is from the original master and it's as good as it was back when it first came out.
Of course you get the great Boris Karloff in this one and I would watch anything he was in including 'targets'. I love the guy. Jack nicolson is in here too and he's always good too imo. So hd cinema really did a good clean up. Now if only someone would clean up lots of other movies. Heck even the 70's and nieties has some bad prints on dvd and blu. 'dead alive' and many others. on dvd it's even worse. So for those of us who know this movie and blu rays this is a fine blu ray. Just don't expect a newer type of clarity. This never had that.

Circus Of Terror aka Barn Of The Naked Dead with genre star Andrew Prine under the stylish and witty direction of Allen (Trouble In Mind) Rudolph in this tale set in the nuclear bad-lands of Nevada. Mr Prine turns in a top performance in demented psychosis which is alternately creepy / humorous as he administrates and admonishes his prospective circus creatures. I've read many a critical review of this low-low budget marvel and was subsequently expecting something poor and pathetic, thankfully those reviewers were wrong or just plain inaccurate, possibly due to them reviewing edited prints of poor quality. Code Red has made this little movie look as good as it ever will and there are some truly inspired moments that this horror fan appreciated and enjoyed. The film has just the right amount of dark humour permeating throughout along with some effective special make-up. I kept thinking about Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes being possibly inspired by this, but see what you think dear reader.

Schoolgirls In Chains aka Abducted A pair of psycho brothers make it their calling to go out and capture damsels in distress along the American highways and byways in order to enact their twisted games of sadism. Gary Kent both stars and is the production manager of this rough little tale, but John Parker who plays his child-like brother seals the crown of demented believability as he goes about playing doctor with the girls in the basement. With very little blood to be seen this movie relies on a creepy atmosphere of isolation and containment.

Both films are presented on a single disc, with Circus Of Terror looking the best, sadly it has no extras at all, though Schoolgirls In Chains contains two commentary tracks one of which with Gary Kent. If these kinds of movie are your cup of trashy fun then this represents very good value for money. Both films were previously available as standalone editions from Code Red, though Schoolgirls is now OOP.

My search is finally over, for the print in this new DVD/Blu Ray set is almost perfect. The creative and colorful use of lighting, resembling that used by Mario Bava, can now be seen in all its glory and the colors (including the famous butterscotch finale) are sharp and vivid. Although not in the original widescreen ratio, it still looks astonishingly good. For those of you unfamiliar with its history, THE TERROR was cobbled together in a few weeks by 5 different directors including the 26 year old Jack Nicholson who has the starring role. Karloff's scenes were shot in 3 days.

Be advised that while this is not an official MGM release like the other AIP Poe pictures, it is certainly the best copy of the film out there. I cannot speak about the quality of the Blu-Ray disc as I don't have a Blu-Ray player but in order to get the DVD I had to buy the combo pack. I can say that the DVD looks great on my flat screen and sounds great too. In addition to the dialogue, Ronald Stein's memorable score also comes through loud and clear. The packaging also restores the original poster art which clearly states that THE TERROR is a Boris Karloff vehicle not a Jack Nicholson one although that's how it used to be marketed in previous incarnations.

Also for the first time, I was able to watch the movie all the way through.  Because other transfers' images were always so blurry and the sound so muffled, it was almost like watching snow on the screen.  I'd lose interest halfway through and fall asleep.

This time, though, the movie grabbed my attention.  How could it not?  The image and sound were both clear.  Happily, I changed my mind from judging the film mediocre to just as intriguing as Roger Corman's other masterpieces, like ""The Fall of the House of Usher (1960),"" ""The Pit and the Pendulum (1961),"" ""Tales of Terror (1962),"" ""Tower of London (1962),"" ""The Haunted Palace (1963),"" ""The Raven (1963),"" ""Masque of the Red Death (1964),"" and ""The Tomb of Ligeia (1965).""

As for the bluray, I agree with the other reviewers who claim the picture is too soft and at times even a little blurry.  I'm sure a lot of work went in to taking the 35mm elements to the high definition format but I'm honestly not sure the folks who remastered the print for this disk knew what they were doing.  There are moments of brilliance here but for the most part its a mixed bag visually. I suppose it beats the crappy dollar store versions we've been accustomed to for the last several decades.

Another complaint of the authoring of this disc is the lack of time coding!  To me that seems like such a basic thing, especially if you are trying to get to a certain moment in the disk, not to mention to see how much longer the movie has to go.  But not on this one.

Another problem is that many of his films until recently, have only been available in very poor releases with beat up washed out prints. I caught 'The Terror' on MGMHD this month, along with many other Corman classics(..and not so classic). I have never seen this film look this good, with rich deep colors and clarity that looks to good to be true. I usually don't review a release before I've had a chance to see it first hand, but I'm hoping this Blu Ray is going to look as good if not better than what I saw on MGMHD.

The film itself is a very restrained horror film with excellent acting by(then)newbie Jack Nicholson and veteran horror king Boris Karloff. I like this film very much, but it isn't one of my favorites from Corman. The sets and atmosphere are up to Corman's creative low budget skills, but the film just isn't spooky enough for my taste. Despite an appropriate and creepy music score, it doesn't deliver the goods like I wanted it to. A better example of Corman getting the most out of his sets and creating real tension is to watch 'House of Usher' where towards the end of the film it really builds. The Terror lacks this build up and in the end is a little less satisfying.

This is only a minor critique as I do like this film very much. I will add to this review as I find out more on the actual Blu Ray release.",1300579200,6,1441,4.217391304347826

Don't get me wrong, in many ways this movie is as terrible as anything Corman ever churned out, but at least it's jam-packed with atmosphere and scenery-chewing. Filmed just after Corman finished The Raven (he had five free days that had been budgeted for that one), Corman and his principal cast and crew knocked this out, in Hollywood terms, overnight.

The plot concerns one Andre Duvalier (Nicholson), separated from his regiment, who seeks shelter in a small house for the night after running into a lovely young woman who calls herself Helene (Knight) down by the sea. She drops hints that she can be found at the castle of Baron von Leppe (Karloff), and when Duvalier rides that way, he spies her in a window. Duvalier demands admittance, and the game is on: is Helene really a prisoner in the castle, or is she the ghost of Ilsa, von Leppe's wife, dead twenty years?

While Nicholson and Karloff do the jobs expected of them, the real lynchpin of this movie is Stefan (Dick Miller), von Leppe's servant, who's never quite sure which side he's on in this battle of wills. He doesn't get as much screen time as the stars of the film, but what we see of him makes me wonder how much fun this could have been had he ended up as the main character.

The films begins in 1806 with the story of a lost French soldier (Nicholson) who has been separated from his group, he stumbles upon a strange young girl who seems sort of possessed, the soldier tries to ask her for directions, she does not answer she simply disappears on him. The soldier tries to find his way through until he finds a castle, in it lives an old man and a butler who seem very mysterious. And there is something very mysterious because the old man is much very connected to the strange young girl. The story of the movie is quite interesting but it lacks excitement. What I mean by that is that the movie is very slow, to a point that is unbearable. I forced myself to stay awake through the whole thing. Also the conclusion is quite unsatisfying

949645,3,6305010609,"Roger Corman, the king of schlock, finished ""The Raven"" ahead of schedule and decided to make another film on the same set.  Corman and four other directors filmed ""The Terror"" in four days.  The result is mixed and horror movie fans are divided as to whether this film is a cult classic or another schlock horror film of the early 1960's.

The story is relatively simple.  Lt. Andre Duvalier (Jack Nicholson) has become separated from his unit.  He encounters a beautiful and mysterious woman on the beach.  He eventually learns her name is Hellene (Sandra Knight).  After wandering about, Duvalier encounters an old lady who is mysterious in the way of old ladies in horror movies.  The old lady insists there is no beautiful and mysterious woman wandering about in this area, but Nicholson was in love so he went off to the nearby castle.  The castle is a suitably creepy place inhabited by Baron Victor Frederick Von Leppe and his assistant Stefan (Dick Miller, who appeared in movies such as ""The Howling"" and ""Small Soldiers,"" and continues to act as of the date of this review).

Duvalier quickly realizes that the castle is a creepy place.  His mysterious woman appears and disappears.  There are secret rooms.  There is a dead body in the basement.  Baron Von Leppe and Stefan are always skulking about.  The unfortunate part of this portion of the movie is that it is all about atmosphere and very little about advancing the plot.

The movie picks up in the last 15 minutes or so, and a lot of questions get answered.  Unfortunately, there are some new questions asked and some questions never get answered fully.  On the other hand, the action picks up a lot near the end of the movie and the movie has a surprise or two for its audience.

On the plus side, Karloff is incredible in this film.  He is mysterious and moody and you sense there is something driving his character, Baron Victor Frederick Von Leppe.  The castle is also great, which is probably why Corman decided to film another movie in it after ""The Raven.""  Sandra Knight, then married to Jack Nicholson, was also great as Helene and the ghost of the Baroness.

On the negative side, Jack Nicholson still had some things to learn about acting.  Nicholson often rushes his lines and his overacted character is almost a distraction.  I wonder what would have happened had Nicholson's character been written out of the movie.  The other partially negative aspect of this movie is the almost total lack of plot.  I say partially because the lack of plot makes this movie a moody atmospheric film.  I got the feeling that Baron Von Leppe's story had been going on for some time and Lt. Andre Duvalier (Nicholson) had arrived late in the final chapters.

As I noted above, people see this movie one of two ways.  Some people see this movie as a dragging, plotless bore.  Other people see this movie as an artistic, moody period piece with masterful acting by Karloff.  You will have to watch this movie to decide how you interpret this movie.  I liked the moody aspects of the film, but I also thought the movie focused too much on atmosphere and too little on plot.  This movie may be a cult classic, but I am not a member of that cult.

949648,3,6305010609,"The Terror is a 1963 horror film (actually in color!) starring Boris Karloff and Jack Nicholson that hasn't really gained much recognition. And understandably so. Like Bela Lugosi, Karloff seemed to fall into numerous low budget B-movies after his initial fame of the Universal era reached its peak. This is one of those movies. For plot details, here's what the back of the DVD case reads:

""The Terror features two screen legends in a most unlikely pairing, alby directed by horrormeister Roger Corman (with an assist by Francis For Cappola). Jack Nicholson plays Andre Duvalier, a lieutenant in the French Army, who falls in love with Helene (Sandra Knight), a mysterious woman who keeps appearing to him. He eventually follows her to an old creepy castle, where he meets the sinister Baron Von Leppe (Boris Karloff), and is held captive. As it turns out, Helene is the ghost of the Baron's late wife, or so we are led to believe. This atmospheric film is appropraitely moody and drenched with a feeling of dread. Numerous plot twists and surprises will keep you guessing right up to the film's end.""

I think that synopsis exaggerates a bit. The story, while slightly clever and intriguing once completely revealed near the end, is a bit draggy and, not surprisingly, doesn't really hold the viewer's attention. Karloff's character isn't very interesting either. For such a star, it seems there should've been a little more substance and style that he could've fooled around with. Strangely enough, most scenes seemed to focus on the other star of the show, which is the only real reason I enjoyed The Terror. For Nicholson. I've long been a fan of Jack and his undeniable sense of charisma and screen presence. So, of course, I just had to see some of his older works. Here, he's in his mid-twenties, basically unknown in the film industry, and doesn't have too much to work with as far as his character goes. Regardless, he is given a lot of screen time, which makes up for what the script lacks. Sure, he's no RP McMurphy or Jack Torrance, but it's still fun to see. And about the whole ""French Army"" deal, don't worry, he doesn't use an accent. Despite a few changes of grammer and a corny suit, given the story is set in the seventeen/eighteen hundreds, he's still good 'ol Jack Nicholson.

Now to the particular DVD edition I own -- the one from DigiView Productions. In addition to the already tattered age of the film, the transfer is pretty lousy. The color isn't very good at all, especially in the dark scenes. The sound could also use a little polishing, but overall it's still watchable. As far as everything else, well, there is a menu, but really no special features. Still, the price is unbeatable.

All in all, The Terror is a decent film. Nothing beyond the ordinary for that era of horror flicks, but a young Nicholson makes it worth owning anyway. I'd just recommend, depending on your tolerance for transfer quality, that you consider what price you're willing to pay.",1141430400,2,2993,4.761078998073217

949691,4,6305010609,"There is a lot to talk about concerning 1963's The Terror, but the most fascinating thing of all is the fact that Roger Corman actually made a creepy, impressive film for once in his life.  Of course, I can't help but think he had a little bit of help by a young associate producer named Francis Coppola.  As for the film itself, it definitely deserves its cult horror film status.  It features Boris Karloff, it maintains a wonderfully gloomy atmosphere throughout, boasts some pretty decent special effects, and it actually features a good story with some surprising twists and turns at the end.  It also stars a young Jack Nicholson, which certainly helps its popularity - unfortunately, though, this is probably Nicholson's worst performance ever, as he sometimes rushes through his lines without immersing himself in the character.

Nicholson plays Andre Duvalier, a French soldier who has become separated from his unit.  You can tell he's French because he wears a fancy uniform but doesn't seem inclined to actually engage in any sort of battle, is rather rude to those he meets, and basically expects everyone to do whatever he commands of them.  Andre meets a young lady named Helene as he is wandering along some coastline and apparently falls in love with her - despite the fact she keeps disappearing and just possibly tries to lead him to his death.  He ends up being cared for by a strange old woman, who tells him there is no girl in that area.  Still, he persists in finding Helene, eventually tracking her to a spooky old castle.  There, he meets Baron von Leppe (Karloff) and learns that the girl he saw is the spitting image of the Baron's wife, who has been dead for twenty years.  He eventually learns the story of the Baroness' violent death, but he just doesn't believe that the woman he met is actually a ghost.  The Baroness' death all those years ago does stand at the heart of the story, but the truth is more complicated than you might think.  The film sort of plods along for awhile, but the final twenty minutes play out wonderfully.  You may think you know what is really going on, but odds are that you will meet with a surprise or two before all is said and done - I know I did.  There is one plot point that is a little hard to swallow for reasons that will be obvious to the viewer, but overall I would declare this film an unqualified success.

The story behind this movie has become something of a legend.  It seems that Corman wrapped up filming The Raven a few days early, and so he decided to make another film on the spot.  The rush job origins of the film explain some of the anachronisms that crop up, but it seems obvious to me that Corman did his best work when he didn't have time to really think about what he was doing.  Some critics have referred to The Terror as a movie without a plot.  Apparently, only a partial script was written on the spot - specifically, those scenes filmed on the set of The Raven.  The movie was actually finished a short time later (several individuals, including Francis Ford Coppola, were tasked with the job of putting the patchwork of filmed scenes together and actually finishing the whole thing).  Despite its unusual and rushed origins, though, I found The Terror to be an impressive, strongly plot-driven film.  The story, even more than the actors (in my opinion, only Karloff gave an impressive performance), makes The Terror a must-see horror film that, in my estimation, is in no way cheesy.",1113868800,12,3481,4.606158833063209

949696,3,6305010609,"How much you like this Roger Corman double feature will depend, of course, on how much you like Roger Corman in general--the ""King of the B's,"" a producer/director/writer with a knack for turning out inexpensive horror films on a tight schedule.  Most often Corman's film were dive-in dreck, lame-brainers like ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTERS, WASP WOMAN, and CREATURE FROM THE HAUNTED SEA.  But as his career progressed, Corman did indeed begin to strike gold, keeping to his inexpensive budgets but luring big name stars like Vincent Price and Ray Milland for such films as THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM and X: THE MAN WITH THE X-RAY EYES--movies that are classics of their kind and remain tremendous fun to watch to this day.
The films on this double feature disk fall somewhere between Corman dreck and Corman gold.  According to film lore, Corman created THE TERROR in 1963 for the simple reason that when THE RAVEN wrapped he still had star Boris Karloff under contract for three days more--and not being one to waste a dime he quickly came up with a script that could play out on the earlier film's sets and be shot in less than thirty-eight hours.
THE TERROR concerns a young French solider (Jack Nicholson, who made several films with Corman early in his career) who is separated from Napoleon's army and finds himself drawn to an isolated castle by the charms of a lovely young woman (Sandra Knight)--but instead of finding her in residence encounters the Baron Victor Frederick Von Leppe (Boris Karloff), an elderly and possibly demented man still mourning the death of his wife some twenty years ago.  The plot is loose, to say the least, and Nicholson is hardly any one's idea of a Napoleonic officer, but while THE TERROR isn't a great film by any stretch of the imagination it isn't a bad one either--for all its cliches and cheap manipulations, it manages to create an atmosphere that is surprisingly effective.
The second feature, however, is really the more interesting of the two.  Starring Dick Miller (who also appears in THE TERROR), the 1959 BUCKET OF BLOOD reads very much like an extended episode from the classic t.v. series THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  Walter Paisley (Miller) is a geeky wannabe who scrabbles a living as a waiter in a beatnik coffee shop--but when he accidentally kills his landlady's cat he covers it in clay to create an instant sculpture that makes a hit with the club's ever-so-artsy clientele.  Needless to say, one thing leads to another, and before too long Paisley is making a hit with life-size sculptures as well.
What makes BUCKET OF BLOOD particularly interesting are Corman's florishes of black comedy, grotesque humor, and his constant jabs at the pseudo-artistic crowd that admire Paisley's work.  In a year or so more, Corman would ravel much the same thread with the comic story of a mousy florist clerk who grows a sinister plant in the better known LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS.
The print of THE TERROR (which had Francis Ford Coppola as an assistant producer, no less) is in pretty bad condition: the film is presented in pan-and-scan, the colors are washed out and often fuzzy, and the film is riddled with blips, scratches, and various artifacts.  But it is watchable, and I have to say I've never seen a really good print of this film in any release.  BUCKET OF BLOOD fares better: while hardly pristine it is fairly crisp in its original black and white.  The disk comes with a few lightweight but entertaining extras, including basic information on each movie, trivia, etc.; scene access, however, is extremely limited.
Neither of these films should be classed along side the best of Corman's work, but then again neither are they anywhere near the worst of his worst.  If you're a Corman fan, they're must-have, and this two-for-one deal is a handy and fairly inexpensive way of picking up both.

949699,3,6305010609,"The history of the movie is far more interesting than the movie, itself.  Corman had three extra days after his prematurely wrapped The Raven shoot, and tossed this thing together off the top of his (and everybody else's) head to end up making two features for the price of one.  Considering the circumstances, the thing is a masterpiece.
Of course, the finished product neither knows nor cares about the circumstances, which is why this movie is doubly entertaining.  The mix of costuming and acting styles, the endless anachronisms throwing the audience out of suspension of disbelief that they are in Napoleonic era Germany (or is it supposed to be Spain? and if so, why so many German names? and if not, where does one get a seaside cliff in Germany?)  -  not to mention the genuinely really bad acting from pretty much everyone involved (including Karloff, who almost certainly didn't take it seriously), and the grossly mixed accents of the cast  -  make this one endlessly entertaining, in that drop-your-jaw, I-can't-believe-adult-human-beings-actually-got-together-and-made-this-thing kind of way.
It actually has a plot, which if you're really attentive and diligent you can pick out in the last five minutes of the movie, and if you do, it's terribly clever and grossly improbable, which just makes it all that much more fun.
But you won't care about that.  What you really want to see is Jack Nicholson performing flatter than a block of wood, his then-wife Sandra Knight with an accent and acting style flatter still (though she is quite beautiful), Dorothy Neumann as a cackling revenge-driven old witch, Bronx-accented Dick Miller as a supposedly very German manservant, and Karloff struggling to keep a straight face given all the preceding impediments.
Nicholson happily confesses in interviews that they all had a ball making this wonderfully absurd movie, and it actually shows.  Interestingly enough, if you're in the right mood, you can even see the horror movie this almost was, if they'd had more time to make it really work.  There are some good gore effects  -  a man's eyes gouged out by a killer hawk, and an incredibly goopy melting woman, topping the list  -  and it's pretty handsomely produced, even with a decently eerie musical soundtrack throughout.
Don't watch it because it's good  -  watch it because it's FUN.",1031356800,5,2347,5.057142857142857
7880741,4,6305010609,"RELEASED IN 1963 and directed by Roger Corman & Francis Ford Coppola (with the help of a few others), The Terror stars Jack Nicholson as a young officer in Napoleon's Army who is infatuated by an intriguing woman (Sandra Knight) he meets on the coast of the Confederation of the Rhine. After a run-in with a witch (Dorothy Neumann) he tracks the mysterious girl to the castle of an elderly Baron riddled with guilt (Boris Karloff).

INTERESTING BEHIND-THE-SCENES INFO: After the shooting for Cormans The Raven was completed, the castle sets were still available for a few days before demolition. Corman acted quickly to concoct a script via Leo Gordon and enlisted 75 year-old Karloff, who costarred in The Raven. Boris later said it was amusing the way Roger dashed around with him & the other principles filming scenes just two steps ahead of the wreckers.

After a few days of shooting, Corman couldn't film the rest of the movie himself due to union legalities, so he enlisted several young filmmakers to assist, including sending Coppola up to the Big Sur area for eleven days. Sets from other AIP movies were also used, notably The Haunted Palace with Vincent Price.

COMMENTARY: Ive heard people complain about the story supposedly not making sense, but I found the plot easy to follow and even had it figured out by the halfway point, not including the dubious curveball thrown-in at the end (youll know what I mean).

As my title blurb points out, The Terror is very Hammer-esque, albeit made in California and on a lower budget than the typical Hammer flick (which weren't expensive films by any means). So if you like haunting Gothic horror with mysterious castles, ghosts and witches in the mold of Hammer flicks youll probably like The Terror. Its particularly reminiscent of Dracula, Prince of Darkness (1966), which came out three years later. As far as 60s spooky MOOD goes, this movies superb, which includes the Gothic score (Ronald Stein). Unfortunately, Nicholsons voice is noticeably incongruous and his lines are sometimes delivered in a stilted manner, but thats a minor quibble.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hours & 21 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles (studio), Santa Monica, Point Lobos & Palos Verdes Peninsula, California. WRITERS: Gordon and Jack Hill. ADDITIONAL CAST: Dick Miller (Stefan) and Jonathan Haze (Gustaf).

7880742,3,6305010609,"My suggestion for anyone who is unfamiliar with this movie is to watch it for free on YT. This is one of Roger Corman's ""Hey kids! Let's make another movie since we wrapped the one we just made"" efforts. It has it's moments both for the good and the bad. Jack as a French army officer? Who knew they spoke English with a Jersey accent! I like the movie, it's weird and fun, and if you are a Corman fan or a fan of cult movies you will probably like it. My 3 star rating is due to the quality of the transfer: it's very soft focus most of the time. I do not know if it was shot that way or just a bad print or a second-rate transfer, but it is not a high quality image. So watch it on YT and decide for yourself.",1507507200,,711,3.8435374149659864
