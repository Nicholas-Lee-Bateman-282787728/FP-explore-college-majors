2438478,5,B000BR8BJ4,"My 21 month old only watched Baby Einstein movies. After trying Elmo, Thomas and countless animated movies, kids singing songs captivates him! Perfect for car rides or getting dinner on the table!",1356825600,2,196,5.15625

2438480,5,B000BR8BJ4,"We are huge Cedarmont fans. My kids LOVE these videos, despite how old and cheesy they are. I love hearing them sing all the little VBS songs. My kids are 1 and 2 - they especially love Toddler Tunes and Silly Songs. Really like having the 3 dics together.",1334102400,,256,4.244897959183674
2438481,2,B000BR8BJ4,My 20 month old daughter is okay with it... maybe she needs to be older.  I think it's boring.  Same kids through out singing children's songs... maybe it's just not for me.  I wish i never purchased it.,1323302400,,203,4.2894736842105265
2438482,5,B000BR8BJ4,"This platinum set comes with toddler tunes, preschool tunes, and silly songs. My kids, (6, 3, and 5 months) LOVE watching, singing, and dancing along with the kids on the video. It even calms my infant down when she's fussy. My kids literally watch these dvds over and over and over again. Thank you cedarmont kids for making these adorable interactive videos!",1300752000,19,360,4.82258064516129
2438483,5,B000BR8BJ4,This DVD is absolutely worth it and of exceptional value. My 2 year old loves it and can sing along to many of the songs.,1266105600,,121,3.88
2438484,5,B000BR8BJ4,I have 2 hanicapped daughters who love music.  I was looking for some of the good oldies like wheels on the bus.  I bought them the Platinum Toddler Collection and Christmas Fav.  They Love Love Love them thank you.,1265673600,,215,4.461538461538462
2438485,5,B000BR8BJ4,These DVD's are interactive and educational. Christian based with great songs and nursery rhyme themes. Highly reccommend for any family!!!,1238284800,,139,6.0
2438486,5,B000BR8BJ4,"The Cedarmont Kids are great! Our daughter has been in love with these DVDs since she was under the age of 1. Now at 3 she has most of the songs memorized. Her cousins enjoy watching/listening with her.
We also bought a set for a friend who is teaching English to Kindergarten students in Monterrey, NL, Mexico. Her students LOVE them.",1199404800,10,335,4.508196721311475
2438487,5,B000BR8BJ4,"I bought this for my grandsons for Christmas, and I have only received glowing feedback.  Thanks Cedarmont for making such wonderful Christian learning material for our children.  Blessings!",1171756800,12,190,5.75
2438518,5,B000BR8BJ4,My 15 month old granddaughter and her 21 month old cousin love Cedarmont Kids.  They are literally glued to the TV.  The 21 month old is learning to talk.  One of her words is Cedarmont.,1475712000,,186,4.257142857142857
2438519,4,B000BR8BJ4,My daughter really likes this so I'll give it 4 stars- but it seems like a homemade movie so it's a little underwhelming,1469318400,,120,4.260869565217392
2438520,5,B000BR8BJ4,"Just order these because I promise you won't be disappointed.  My nieces (who are 14 and 17 now), nephew (who's 10), and my girls (2 & 5) have all cycled through these videos and every single one of them couldn't watch them enough; especially from the ages 2-4.  Great Christian songs and learning songs for the little ones.  Even though the videos are dated, even now they don't seem dated and are still loved!  I will warn parents that you will get tired of hearing requests to play these videos. ;)",1468627200,4,501,4.472527472527473
2438521,5,B000BR8BJ4,My kids still love these.,1466467200,,25,4.2
2438522,5,B000BR8BJ4,I purchased this for my 3 yr old granddaughter as I already have it for another granddaughter who is 2.5 yrs old and she absolutely loves these videos.  The songs have the right message and she loves watching the live children playing while they sing the songs.  I babysit for her 5 days/wk and she asks for it to be played every day.  I know my other granddaughter will enjoy these also.  I have other videos in these Cedarmont collections and they are also excellent.,1462320000,,469,4.482352941176471
2438523,2,B000BR8BJ4,"I purchased this dvd set as a Christmas gift for two girls (2 and 4 y/o) living in Seoul, S Korea.  They are learning English in preschool and I thought this might be fun and valuable for them.  Having now watched all 3 discs, I'm having second thoughts due to the extreme lack of diversity among the cast.  The girls' parents spent 4 years here in the States while their father earned his PhD and are definitely equipped to handle any questions their children might ask, but I'm unhappy that I have to send a child's gift with a parental warning.  I find it particularly ironic that the dvd includes a Spanish option in spite of the fact that I couldn't find a hispanic child on any of the 3 discs.",1447200000,,699,4.312977099236641
2438524,5,B000BR8BJ4,Grandkids love it!  Great songs!,1447027200,,32,5.4
2438525,4,B000BR8BJ4,I think I enjoy Cedermont kids as much as my kids do.  Loved the price too,1434067200,,74,3.625
2438526,5,B000BR8BJ4,A nice selection of songs that little children seem to enjoy and be mesmerized by :),1431561600,,84,4.3125
2438527,1,B000BR8BJ4,"As other reviewers say, kids may like this well enough but I found it totally annoying. The songs were too long with many repetitious verses.  I understand that those folk songs did have many verses but it just grates on the nerves of an adult to hear the same tune over and over.  I bought it hoping to use it in my church's toddler area but I don't think I want to inflict it on my adult volunteers. :o) The Cedarmont kids are cute and their activities that go with the songs would be intriguing for toddlers but since the songs are folk songs from long ago, the Cedarmont Kids tried to put many of the songs in context and in period costume.  Most toddlers would not get at all a song like ""Polly Put The Kettle On"" and other period songs.  I also didn't see too much difference between the toddler DVD and the preschool DVD as far as level of content.  If I had to listen to any of these DVDs I would choose the ""Silly Songs"" DVD.  That seemed to be the least annoying.  Normally I think the Cedarmont Kids DVDs are very good but this one just wasn't listenable for adults.  Maybe if you played it for kids in a sound-proof room so you, the adult, couldn't hear it, that might work.  :o)",1421452800,,1191,4.211453744493392
2438528,5,B000BR8BJ4,My toddler loves the songs ang actions. Highly recommended for a healthy experience that can be enjoyed by parents and children.,1408579200,,128,5.142857142857143
2438529,5,B000BR8BJ4,"The kids love these videos and at 2 and 4 have been sining the songs in the car, with all the words! It's great fun for the kids!",1404691200,,129,3.642857142857143
2438530,5,B000BR8BJ4,My daughter loves these videos at her daycare and I had to get them because she enjoyed them so much!,1398470400,,101,4.1
2438531,5,B000BR8BJ4,THE GRANDSON WITH AUTISM REALLY LIKES THIS. I ENJOY IT TOO - CATCHY TUNES IN SWEET CHILDREN'S VOICES. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,1396310400,,121,4.809523809523809
2438532,1,B000BR8BJ4,This is not a sing along and it was difficult to try and understand the words that were being sung. I would not recommend.,1386633600,,122,4.125
2438533,5,B000BR8BJ4,"I haven't even received this yet but I KNOW my 2 year old grandson is going to LOVE it (for Christmas)!!  I have 2 old VHS copies given to me from Cedarmount with much fewer songs on them that he already requests over & over (Toddler Tunes - with only 25 songs & Action Bible Songs - 17 songs on it).  He loves them so well, in fact, that I also ordered the longer length DVD for Bible songs too!  He is so captivated by the other children, mimics their movements, loves to sing along, & these are even a favorite request at nap time to wind down.  If your child is AT ALL the musician/singer that my grandchild seems to be leaning towards, then I believe you can't go wrong with these.  All the classic child & motion songs AND NO JUNK that is way too available on live TV!!",1383868800,3,775,4.105960264900662
2438534,4,B000BR8BJ4,"They don't dance along with it, as I had hoped. But they do like it, and I enjoy having it in the background as they play. We sing some of the songs together throughout the day. I'm glad I bought it.",1383004800,2,199,3.8780487804878048
2438535,5,B000BR8BJ4,Can't wait for my grandson to learn and sing these with me. I had these at a former workplace and the kids loved them!! Would recommend any of these dvds for children who love music and singing.,1382400000,,194,4.27027027027027
2438536,5,B000BR8BJ4,"I purchased this DVD for my two-year old granddaughter who loves singing.  She seems more interested in programs that have real people than animated characters.  And that's okay. The world consists of living, breathing human beings and not those wild-eyed, sometimes mean spirited, animated characters.  My granddaughter loves the kids and their activities.  Not sure she listens to the singing so much as watching the kids.  The beautiful scenery of these DVDs only adds to their value.",1380844800,3,487,5.2727272727272725
2438537,5,B000BR8BJ4,I have purchased this for my grandchildren and friends grandchildren for years.  It is always a hit!  Babies and toddlers love watching other children and the songs are ones that many of us remember from our own youth!  This is a nice refresher for those who don't remember the words or have forgotten some of the songs.,1364169600,,320,4.578947368421052
