511325,5,6302798442,"West plays a flamboyant singer Ruby Carter who after breaking up with her boxer boyfriend, takes a job singing at a fashionable club in New Orleans. She quickly becomes the object of desire for the area's male population and an object of envy and scorn by one of the females.

Mae West is splendidly dressed thoughout with over the top plumes, hat's, jewels and form fitting gowns. Despite her age and size, she's quite an eye-catcher and her charming, sex-crazed personality intrigues and delights. She also sings much loved tunes such as MY OLD FLAME and ST LOUIS WOMAN backed by Duke Ellington and his orchestra.

Mae West's one-liners and innuendos were toned-down and they were no where near as sexual as in her first starring feature SHE DONE HIM WRONG. The Production Code that came in effect at around this time was pretty strict and as a result, this film was said to have been heavily edited. Some of Mae's best lines were left out and the original title IT AIN'T NO SIN was changed to the more inoffensive BELLE OF THE NINETIES. Despite all this, BELLE OF THE NINETIES still offers some of her best dialogue and witty one-liners.

When West is asked ""What type of men you prefer?"". She replies ""Only two. Domestic and foreign.""

When John Miljan goes to greet her as she exits her boat, Mae (as usual) is surrounded by men. ""Take care of these men"" says Miljan. Mae adds, ""Yes, give them all my address.""

When one of her male admirers states ""Ruby I must have you. Your golden hair, your fascinating smile,  your lovely arms, your form, devine"". She quickly quips ""What is this a proposal or are you taking inventory?.""

And even her maid get's some useful advice when West tells her ""Don't let a man ever put anything over on you outside of an umbrella.""

And one of her best lines ""Better to be looked over than over-looked"" is featured here.

The curvacious blonde is all style, all substance and originality and her lines are performed with a sexual ""purr"" that would have even Catwoman taking notes. BELLE OF THE NINETIES is one of Mae West's most entertaining flicks. It's blown-up, brazen and pleasurable. Just like the lady herself.",1123027200,4,2152,4.6569920844327175
511326,5,6302798442,"I don't think that there is another star like Mae West.  She saved the largest Hollywood movie producer,Paramont. Eventhough she was censored, she still had the best one liners out of all the stars!  She was Irish, and all the Irish I ever knew were firery (compliment).

  And more about this picture, She is most fashionable in her own unique way as only she could.",1121904000,,367,4.584615384615384
511327,5,6302798442,"One of Mae's five best films. Yes, the movie's original script was censored, but indications are that the original was much racier than even her early films (as one might expect given the production title IT AIN'T NO SIN) so it's not really any tamer than her first three films and Mae has several of her best lines, my favorite is ""I'm in town - but not for good.""  The song numbers are the best Mae ever did in the movies.  The movie also offers a rare look at ""tableaux"", the odd stage art popular in the 19th century of simply posing on the stage which climaxes with Mae posing as the Statue of Liberty, or as George Jean Nathan put it, The Statue of Libido.",1113350400,9,662,4.246031746031746
511328,4,6302798442,"Like her nearest competitors the Marx brothers and W.C. Fields, Mae West worked best in films where the logic of the plot made the least sense (as in I'M NO ANGEL where she's a lion tamer who conquers New York's society lions). In this film version of one of her stage plays, the plot is pretty sensible, which acts to its detriment. Mae doesn't get nearly as great lines as she usually does, and there's all this creaking plot machinery to establish her moral position and that of her no-good boyfriends. Still, it has great sets and costumes, and you get to hear her really cut loose with some of the best honky-tonk songs she ever got to sing in her wonderful adenoidal way, including ""My Old Flame"" and ""Memphis Blues."" Her accompaniment is by Duke Ellington and his orchestra (you even get to see them with her in one scene), which should let you know how special this score is. And Mae is, of course, always Mae.",1069459200,8,918,4.470238095238095
511329,4,6302798442,"The Production Code certainly did its duty (and damage) with Mae West's films. Her lines and remarks were dramatically ""toned down"". If you compare this movie with its immediate Pre-Code predecessors ""She Done Him Wrong"" and ""I'm No Angel"", you'll know what I mean.
Anyway, still worthwhile to watch, West has a field day as ""the flame"" of  both, St. Louis and New Orlans, with boxer Roger Pryor, upper-class Johnny Mack Brown and villainous casino owner John Miljan, at the top of the list of her admirers. Mae never looked so ravishing again as in this picture, in those awesome 1890s gowns designed especially for her by Paramount's top couturier Travis Banton. She also gets to sing a great deal here, mostly accompanied by a young Duke Ellington and his Orchestra.",1033516800,26,769,4.870229007633588
511330,4,6302798442,"She aint no stick figure, but she is ALL woman. Mae was the sort of woman who knew what she wanted and wasn't afraid to ask. She had a great voice for the blues and a good head for the double entendre's. It's a fun movie  and never tries to take itself seriously. Well worth a look.",949449600,6,282,3.9473684210526314
511331,4,6302798442,"More spectacular than Mae's first two vehicles, BELLE OF THE NINETIES cost more that her previous starrers combined, and still reaped a huge profit.  The story was written by Mae herself and it's pretty weak - although the Hays office snapped its scissors on some of her best lines.  West's unique presence, and command for innuendo - which could raise laughs from the most innocuous remarks, kept the movie simmering.  So did the superb Duke Ellington Orchestra which ably helped Mae through four numbers - most notably the standard to be MY OLD FLAME.  Looking like an upholstered egg-timer, the star was kept on the screen front and centre throughout by astute director Leo McCarey in this William Le Baron production from 1934.  For trivia buffs, the working title of this flick was IT AIN'T NO SIN - however the censors disagreed, and the title was laundered along with the risque script.  Mae struts her stuff as 1890's singer Ruby Carter who gets involved with a boxer.......... Such lines as ""It's better to be looked over than overlooked"" and such done in her inimitable style gets the point across, even if the prudish and rather foolish Hays office thought otherwise.  The rather chunky, 41 year-old star was photographed by Karl Struss and Mae never looked better on film.",947980800,10,1284,4.862385321100917
511332,4,6302798442,"BELLE OF THE NINETIES was originally entitled ""It Ain't no Sin"". However, the censors disagreed and the result was a changed title and a laundered script. Mae is a nightclub performer who sings ""My Old  Flame"" among other numbers with Duke Ellington's orchestra in the  background; Roger Pryor is her love interest, a boxer named Tiger Kid. In  one scene John Miljan goes into great detail in describing Mae's physical  attributes while proposing, Mae stops him cold: ""Wait a moment""!  ""Is this a proposal or are you takin' inventory! "" Directed by  Leo McCarey and photographed by Karl Struss (Mae never looked better) this  is still an amusing example of West-ern humor!",947289600,6,672,4.946428571428571
511473,5,6302798442,"I love Mae West films and this one is trip.  The costumes are stunning and the songs interesting.  It is a Mae West mesmerizer - written by her.  It begins with tableaus of her against a butterfly, bat, and spider background and as a statue of Liberty.  Some of her most famous lines are in this one - ""He is so low, he can walk under that door without taking off his hat.""  It is about the adventures of a singer who goes to New Orleans from St. Louis, Missouri - ""I'm from Missouri, and you know what means.""  Excellent film quality.",1386806400,,535,4.196078431372549
511474,5,6302798442,"Enjoyed this film begining to end.  Why?
One: Mae West, truly the ""Belle of the Ages"".  She has the talent, the charm, and the style to be risque without being vulgar and yet she was censured.  Modern Hollywood garbage mouths, can you say Conyea (sic) have no clue as to what being classy is all about and yet their suppose to be talented stars.
Two: I like almost all of Johnny Mack Brown's films and he's in this one as is one of his sidekicks Fuzzy Knight, another great comedian.
Three: She wrote the script for this one after the Production Code (censorship) was put into effect yet the film grossed enough money it saved Paramount Studios from bankrupsey and she made a serious bundle for herself, all before woman's lib.
Four: Great music in the film and Duke Ellington on the piano is a pleasure to listen to.
Five: Plot is not spellbinding unless your on edge to see or hear what Miss West does next but for a 70 minute film it will keep your attention.
Six: She's Irish Catholic on her father's side and German Protestant on her mother's side, just like me.
Everything else is Mae West, Mae West, May West (Kim Kardashian eat your heart out, you have NO talent) seriously, what does she do to be remotely famous.
Viva Mae West!  She should have been picked for the role of Scarlett O'Hara.  I can hear her now telling Clark Gable as she stands on the stairway, ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a hoot"".",1386028800,,1410,4.407692307692308

It's a common thread with her, but it never gets old.  Of all the movies she's done, it's easy to say that she sings the best in the Belle of the Nineties.  If you're going to get one Mae West movie, you better add this one to your collection.",1198195200,,384,4.08
511481,4,6302798442,"Belle of the Nineties is a film about a stage star known all over for her gorgeous figure (Mae West). She finds her way into many lucrative relationships, but she is no dummy. Throughout her entanglements with several men including a boxer (Roger Pryor), a cheat, and a wealthy man (Johnny Mack Brown), she never loses sight of her identity.

Mae West wrote some great witty dialogue for this film, is adorned in some beautiful costumes to show off her ample figure, and sashays nonchalantly throughout.

Roger Pryor plays his character with the correct blend of masculinity and sweetness to make him the most appealing male in the film.

The music in the film was performed by Duke Ellington and his orchestra. ""When a Saint Louis Woman Goes Down to New Orleans"" lacks no sex appeal with its bluesy melody. ""My Old Flame,"" a gorgeous standard, brings new depth to West's character. ""Memphis Blues"" features a great repore among the orchestra. ""Pray Chilluns"" is a stereotypically black song that segues into West singing ""Troubled Waters,"" a song that makes one flash to Rizzo in Grease lamenting over her bad reputation.

Although this film was made after the production code went into effect (it is even prologued with a note about it), there is still some racy content. There are costumes in which West's breasts are clearly outlined, suggestive dialogue, and men with multiple lovers.",1134259200,4,1389,4.923076923076923
511482,4,6302798442,"This is my first exposure (aside from seeing snippets of ""My Little Chickadee"" on TV) to a Mae West film, and it certainly won't be my last! I became an instant Mae West fan after viewing this one. Although ""Belle.."" was not Mae's strongest vehicle (especially after being ""watered down"" by the Production Code, her constant nemesis), there's no ignoring her knack for dialogue & racy one-liners only the Great Mae could pull off. It certainly says something when a star from generations past can have the same impact decades later. Hats off to ya, Mae!

The story written by Mae West is pretty weak and not very appealing. Looking like an upholstered egg-timer, the star of the movie was kept on screen front and center throughout by the astute director Leo McCarey in this William LeBaron production.  The movie was still a big hit because of the star appeal of Mae West. However it was subjected to severe censoring by the Hay's office since the morality code was in force in 1934. Some of West's best lines were snapped by the scissors of Hay's office. The highlight of the movie is the performance by Duke Ellington and his orchestra helping Mae West thorough four numbers including ""My old Flame.""",1425513600,,792,4.617021276595745
7831212,3,6302798442,"""Belle of the Nineties"" is the transition film from Mae West's pre-code delights of 1933 to her more antiseptic films post code (1934).  While it still contains a sufficient share of good one-liners as she sashays across the screen in her period costumes, the film is really a melodrama, not a raunchy satire. Leo McCarey directed and at first the film seems turgid but as the plot takes over, it starts to move. There is a good fight sequence. The musical numbers are the highlights here with Duke Ellington's band supporting the star in a variety of numbers including ""My Old Flame"" and best of all, ""Troubled Waters.""  The latter is filmed as part of a negro prayer meet and West puts over the lyrics in great style, photographed beautifully on a darkened balcony. It demonstrates that she could really sing the blues and her version compares well with that of Ivie Anderson, Ellington's singer at the time.

The film has been released as part of the TCM Universal Vault series. There are some trivial extras containing lobby cards, on set photos etc; the TCM essay, already available on the TCM website, is worthwhile. The bad news, however, is that the disk is faulty, skipping reels and jumping around. I managed to get through the film eventually but it took some attempts. Incidentally, there is no scene selection which is a nuisance.",1421452800,,1343,4.780172413793103
