7548722,5,B018IDVBH6,"Just amazing series with no commercial. Once you started watching one, you just can't stop watching. The series are addicting. So excited by Series Four coming out. Just simply priceless.",1341360000,19,187,5.266666666666667
7548723,5,B018IDVBH6,"I have been buying the series.  At first, only the first three seasons had been released, and we fans were extremely disappointed.  However, the fourth season was finally released and will come out on 24 July.  This series is worth it.  By today's standards it may seem quaint, and like any other television series it has its flaws.  Television is entertainment designed by a committee.  If you view it as 30s noir, however, it is great.  It's raw, it's gritty, and it got away with some things that just were not done on television in the day (1959-1963).  I cannot say enough about Robert Stack's portrayal of Eliot Ness.  He set the mold in which such characters as Steve McGarrett (Jack Lord's portrayal in the original ""Hawaii Five-0"") and Aaron Hotchner (""Criminal Minds"") were later cast.  I argue with those critics who said that Robert Stack played Ness as cold, unsmiling, unemotional.  Critics never see an entire series, so they miss a lot.  In the episodes, we see Ness smiling as he greets an old friend, sharing a joke with Nick Georgiade's Rico Rossi at the expense of a smug (and crooked) banker, weeping openly at the death of one of his team, and in red-hot anger.  It's a wonderful portrayal.  Robert Stack was not one of those emotive actors; he was much more subtle and conveyed a lot with looks, gestures, and mannerisms (which one fan says Mrs. Eliot Ness said were so like her husband's).  The supporting cast is fine, as well, and my particular favorites were and are Nick Georgiade as Rico Rossi and Paul Picerni as Lee Hobson.  If you pay attention watching the episodes, you will quickly see that there was a repertory-theatre atmosphere about the series, as some of the finest television and film actors of the day, as well as many well-known character actors, appeared multiple times.  There were a number of repeat characters, most notably Neville Brand as Al Capone and Bruce Gordon as his ""enforcer,"" Frank Nitti.  Some have complained about the price, but buyers must consider that when ""The Untouchables"" was filmed, television series episodes were several minutes longer than they are today, and there were more of them in a season.  This series is worth the price.",1338508800,130,2202,4.777777777777778

7548745,5,B018IDVBH6,What can be said that you don't know already.  It's violent and raw.  A good history lesson to show how some people stood up and were counted. It's not just about stopping folks having a drink.  It's a series about how the mob use and abused ordinary people to extract money to feed their need for power and correction and the violence it engendered.  It makes you think which is good. Subsequent movies with this same name doesn't come close to the vivid picture this series paints of life in those days.,1516492800,2,505,4.456521739130435

Again, I love the way Robert Stack just shoves men and women aside while crashing a speakeasy. He is such a straight law abiding man. Did everyone receive the cd with The Lucy Show? That way very funny. Hope everyone is happy as much as I am with the price and product.",1506643200,2,495,4.11340206185567

7548781,1,B018IDVBH6,I HATE TWO THUMBS UP & Amazon for selling me a defective 31 or 32 DVD disc box set. Missing a disc &  2 copies  (duplicates ) of another disc. In their great wisdom the want me to return all 31 or 32 discs instead of just one bad one. I'm the victim & will never ever buy from either again !!!!!!!,1501804800,2,297,3.774193548387097
7548782,5,B018IDVBH6,"Having watched this show a lot when younger via reruns, I was a bit reluctant to order this (having since become a devoted Film Noir fanatic, I was afraid The Untouchables wouldn't hold up after being spoiled by the standards set by that genre).

I'm glad to report that, for me at least, I had nothing to fear, and though there are no episodes to rival the best of Film Noir, there is much, much, much to enjoy here (and episodes were presented for an hour long time slot - minus commercials, so they last just under an hour - allowing enough breathing room for some plot complexity to play out).

Lots of familiar faces show up, as well as many previously unknown to me, always keeping the proceedings interesting and also note that this show employed a number of name (or soon to be name) directors, writers, etc. that added a nice quality of gritty style to most episodes.

Other reviewers have provided more details which I must thank them for, as I had read most before making my decision to buy this directly from Amazon (no one beats them for service, they are in my opinion the new Untouchables and delivered this huge brick of a box set to my door in record time and in perfect sealed condition containing all 31 Discs that played perfectly).

I did the math. This is over 100 hours (approximately the equivalent of 66 Film Noir features) of great, vintage pulp TV, all presented in pristine prints augmented in value by optional English subtitles. Sold to another satisfied customer.",1501027200,11,1494,4.584269662921348

7548815,4,B018IDVBH6,"Quality of reproduction excellent.  Enjoyed viewing each program then searching the backgrounds of the cast and finding out some very interesting facts.  Interesting that during this period of time in television how the same actors cycled through the shows, sometimes appearing more than once in a series as different characters then moved on to other series to become familiar faces.  One caveat:  I didn't get the complete series that I ordered, only seasons 1-3.  Didn't realize this until it was too late to return.  The cost of acquiring the missing shows is disproportionate to the cost of the series package and I have declined to do so.",1492041600,4,644,4.97196261682243

I remember when it was on the air and all the furor over the amount of violence in the series. Quaint by today's standards. It aged OK. Not bad by any measure but audiences of today may not like it as much as us older viewers who also have nostalgia in the mix.

7548947,5,B018IDVBH6,"Amazon has messed up the Reviews.
The Untouchables Complete Series Mega-Box (31 discs) was released on May 10, 2016.
This is the first and only time the complete series has been issued in a boxed set.
Yet on the day it was released, Amazon already had 75 reviews dating back three years.
Ignore any reviews posted before May 10, 2016
[they seem to be reviews of the fourth season.]

SUBTITLES:
Discs 1-23 give you a choice of audio in English or Spanish,
plus SDH Subtitles in English, Spanish or Portugese.
Discs 24-31 have audio in English only,
plus English SDH Subtitles.

Some reviewers complain that there are no subtitles.
I don't get it.
Perhaps they didn't look closely enough.
On the Menu page for DVDs 1-23, click the words ""Set Up"".
For DVDs 24-31, click the word ""Subtitles"".
""The Untouchables"" actually has both the old ""Closed Captioning"" technology and the new SDH subtitle technology.
This can be confusing -
if you turn on the SDH subtitles, make sure you turn off the closed captioning on your TV (by using the ""button marked ""cc"" or ""Captioning"" on your television's remote)
More about ""Closed Captioning"" vs. SDH Subtitles in the first Comment (click on ""Oldest first"").

PACKAGING:
Two plastic cases in a cardboard slipcase (see photo one)
Case One is two inches wide and holds the 23 discs of Seasons 1-3.
Incredibly awkward packaging.
Too many discs for one case.
Case Two is one inch wide, and holds the 8 discs of Season 4.
Conventional packaging - it's actually wider than it needs to be.
This is the same packaging used for the most recent version of the complete ""I Love Lucy"" show.
Reviewers hated the packaging, but CBS/Paramount is adamant.
Anyway, it looks nice on the shelf.

One thing nobody is complaining about is the price: 31 discs for $55
When originally issued on DVD, the four seasons were extravagantly spread over eight volumes.
Each season was marketed as ""Part One"" and ""Part Two"".
All eight volumes (still only 31 discs) cost over $200.
The DVDs in the new mega-box are identical in content and appearance.
Disc labels read something like ""Season 3, Part 2, Disc 3"".

REVIEW:
I was ten years old when ""The Untouchables"" debuted in 1959.
Us kids were big fans of Westerns - ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""Rin-Tin-Tin"",
and sitcoms like ""Sergeant Bilko"" and ""I Love Lucy"".
But we never had much interest in hour-long dramas.

""The Untouchables"" blew my ten-year old mind.
It was without doubt the coolest show on television. Ever.
All my ten year old friends agreed.
It didn't hurt that we lived in Chicago.
For once, it was cool to live in Chicago.

There had been nothing like ""The Untouchables"" on television before 1959.
- Violence:
The pilot episode had bullet-riddled bodies stacked up indiscriminately
Prior to this, TV violence consisted of the Lone Ranger shooting a gun out of the hand of the bad guy.
- S-E-X:
Stripper Brandy La France actually showed 3/4 of a breast - her nipple was covered with a pasty (see photo two)
Us ten year olds loved it.
- Ethnic Stereotyping:
When a gangster speaks Italian 21 minutes into the pilot, the closed captioning reads ""Monkey speaking Italian"".
Huh?
(""Monkey"" was the gangster's nickname)

After much uproar, the show toned down considerably for Seasons 2-4.
Still the Greatest Show Ever.
""The Untouchables"" was produced by Desilu - the production company owned by Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball.
Desi Arnaz appeared onscreen to introduce the pilot - he's there on Disc One.
My only complaint about the pilot episode is the music.
Instead of the familiar and wonderful Untouchables theme by Nelson Riddle,
the pilot has a jazzy original score by Wilbur Hatch - music director of the ""I Love Lucy "" show.

-- Al Capone, played by actor Neville Brand, is sent to Alcatraz in the pilot episode.
The principal recurring villain in the series is Frank Nitti,
played by the menacing Bruce Gordon (see photo 3)
who always reminded me of Bela Lugosi - more Transylvanian than Sicilian.
One of the all-time great TV Villains.

-- The wonderful ""Untouchables"" theme music by Nelson Riddle is only heard in full during the closing credits of each episode (except the pilot where it is missing altogether).
My high school band used to play it at football games.

-- Bonus: Disc 8 features an unexpected ""Untouchables"" reunion show from three years after the series ended.
A 1966 episode of ""The Lucy Show"" - ""Lucy the Gun Moll""
with guest stars Robert Stack (Eliott Ness) and Bruce Gordon (Frank Nitti), plus Walter Winchell's familiar voice-over and Nelson Riddle's music.
(and Lucille Ball in the Brandy La France role.)
An unexpected treat.

7548956,5,B018IDVBH6,"This series was how I found out who Al Capone really was. Before, I had become familiar with one of the cartoon character Quick Draw McGraw's alter egos, a Zorro-parody character named ""El Kabong"", so called because his most-used weapon was a guitar he'd hit his enemies with. So believe it or not, that's what I thought Al Capone was--a Zorro analog who wasn't necessarily comical. Then I tuned in to a new series called ""The Untouchables"" and found out different. This Al Capone was one of the inventors of the gang drive-by shooting, only the weapon of choice was the ""Tommy Gun""--the Thompson Submachine Gun which was the ancestor of the AK-47 and also a military assault weapon. Capone himself was the model for later fictional mobsters like cinema's Don Vito Corleone and cable TV's Tony Soprano.

I remember one episode in this series where Russell Shields (Joseph Wiseman, later to play Bond villain Dr. No), a chemist working for the Mob, has discovered a way to take artificially denatured alcohol and return it to ""booze-worthy"" condition. But we find out that power going to a man's head isn't limited to thugs, when Shields gets into a power struggle with Wally Baltzer (pre-Kojak Telly Savalas), the Mob distributor he deals with. When Baltzer's attempt on Shields' life fails, Shields gets even by pressuring him to murder his henchman Max Frimmel (Jeff Corey). When Ness shows up to arrest Shields for that murder--ironically it's the day after Election Day--he starts wheedling;

Shields; ""They'll go easy on me, won't they, Mr. Ness""
Ness; ""Three murders in two weeks? They'll go easy with you, all right. They'll put a cushion on the electric chair.""
Shields; (pleading) ""What else could I be? What else could I be?""
Ness (indicating a newspaper covering last night's election results) ""I'll tell you what you could have been. You could have been elected President of the United States today"".

How things have changed. Nowadays a cop saying anything like that to a suspect would result in the ACLU showing up.",1459036800,,2029,4.909620991253644

I've been watching  an hour or sometimes two per evening.  There are at least 80 programs.  If you're a fan of the TV series, as I am, this is a must have.  Quality of the video, and sound is very good.  At first I had a little trouble navigating through the videos because these don't have a tracker at the bottom (at least on my system) that lets you find and then go back and replay certain scenes.  It's all there, every scene and every machine gun. Hint:  this series wasn't a real hit with females, and it suffers the additional handicap of being in black and white.  Personally I don't consider it a problem, inasmuch as the original I watched in childhood was the same.  But people born in the color era, as my wife was, may be turned off.",1429142400,2,879,4.117647058823529
7548989,5,B018IDVBH6,"When this series was released in total I was overjoyed.  I remember as a kid watching virtually all episodes of the series including the pilot.  I
have always liked classic gangster stories and this may be the best series ever.  Robert Stack who was brilliant in his portrayal of Eliot Ness even
looks much like him.  Only the weak fourth season mars the series because of ""political correctness"" (Liberal fascism!) which diminished  the power
of the stories...Less Italians, more Anglos and much less violence.  But the gangs in the Big Town were for the most part Italians along with Jewish
and Irish gangs; that is factual history.  The Italians were largely very honest, hard working immigrants like the Irish, etc. yet often these people were the primary victims of these criminal enterprises as the blacks today on the South Side  are the primary victims of black hoodlums.  This show
portrayed the cops as the good guys fighting crooks and crooked political office holders.
  Most of these stories vary away from the original UNTOUCHABLES book which dealt with chasing down Big Al Capone.  Many of the thugs in
the stories are based on real hoodlums, but the stories surrounding them are often fictional though some truth is woven inbetween.  One episode
about Dutch Schulz was loosely based on his downfall, but Ness never had anything to do with that.  But still, the stories In the first three seasons
are superb anyway.  Lots of violence, machine guns all over the place and lots of very nasty characters.  Frank Nitti, a real gangster and head of
the Capone Mob was a nasty leader but rather a brilliant one.  But like all thugs, his day would come.  Nitti is brilliantly portrayed and is in many
later seasons after the first one.
  As a lover of the  City of Chicago, I watched carefully how it was portrayed in the show; mostly pretty good but the streets always seem to be wet.(!)
Ness frequently meets with informants at his favorite private office, an Elevated Train Station!  I have ridden those many a year, and  they are the
symbol of Chicago as the Subway is of New York (where I have lived for many years,).  I had worked for the Transit Authority (Staten Is) for a long
time before retiring.  But I do miss the Big Town and love watching the great show CHICAGO PD which I will review at the end of the season.
 Some of these stories are masterpieces, though we should remember Ness was a Treasury Agent, not a G man.  But having him play cop is much
more interesting; on CSI and NCIS series the investigators do a lot more ""policing"" than in reality, but it makes those shows much more interesting
if they chase down baddies and sometimes shoot them.  And there is a lot of ""shooting"" on the UNTOUCHABLES.
  Further, Paramount should be praised for the imaginative and seductive photography used in the series.  Low camera angles, heavy lighting, and
actually showing ceilings, making the sets more believable; this series is better in Black and White than it would be in color; it adds more atmosphere to the rather gloomy surrounding of the depression era Chicago.  The narration of the show is by Walter Winchell, a brilliant choice
by the producers.  And the musical theme is also outstanding.  Sadly, the producers caved to the bleeding hearts in the fourth season, but by then
the show had run its course.  A brilliant, action packed, well casted (with plenty of big names!), well acted series. Long live THE UNTOUCHABLES!!
Paramount would later release a movie of the same name with Kevin Kostner who played Ness well, but most of the story was pure fiction, especially with Nitti falling off a roof of an office building (played by S. Stallone)!.  Never happened; Nitti would take over the gang and run it for
some time.  FIVE STARS  for this prize; the picture quality of the DVDs is outstanding; better than when it was broadcast on network TV.
  One word for those interested; BONES is back, unfortunately with the cheap replacement for Sweets, a even more repulsive creepy fellow!
Fox producers want a  Sweets-like character on the show, but I don't know why!  Only the Shadow knows!!  I watch the show to see Bones and
Booth work together along with Hodgins and Angela, not that other looney!!  I got my UNTOUCHABLE SERIES (all four seasons) from Amazon.

7549046,5,B018IDVBH6,"Thursday nights at 8 PM found us gathered around our tiny black and white TV to watch another episode of ""The Untouchables"".  Robert Stack was absolutely great as Eliot Ness and the supporting cast exhibited a comraderie and professionalism that was overtly apparant in each show.  (It didn't hurt having Walter Winchell do the narration either!) We always anticipated seeing how Ness would be able to outsmart Al Capone, Legs Diamond, Frank Nitti and other crime bosses who ruled early Chicago's crime scene.  One of the best series on T.V. at the time.  Today's junk crime shows could learn a lesson or two from this wonderful, entertaining old show on how to present an entertaining show without loud special effects, T&A and foul language.",1416182400,,743,4.967741935483871

7549048,5,B018IDVBH6,Watched this show as a young boy and enjoy the black and white grimy feeling of this series. Growing up in Chicago and understanding much of this is made for TV it gives a portrait of an era that no longer exists. Robert Stack as Ness gave a no nonsense portrail of how we wanted our heroes to be back in the 60's. The supporting casts are filled with future stars of TV and movies.

7549072,5,B018IDVBH6,"Like many Baby Boomers,  I remember this four-year series from my childhood, which was resurrected in a comedic fashion by Dan Ackroyd's ""Saturday Night Live"" impersonation of Robert Stack's portrayal of  Eliot Ness (I discount Kevin Costner's role in Brian DePalma's 1987 big screen version, since that was not really an attempt to duplicate or even satirize the original t.v. series). So, it's been a pleasure, so far, reacquainting myself with it through adult eyes. The Wikipedia entry on the t.v. series claims it was criticized at the time as one of the medium's most violent shows and I can see why though, by modern standards of course, it seems tame. It was also, perhaps inevitably, faulted for its supposedly distorted portrayal of the criminal legacy of Italian-Americans (and this a decade before the ""Godfather"" movies). I especially appreciate the Noirish black and white photography and the narration by Walter Winchel that adds just the right documentary feel to the stories. And what a treat it is to see so many performers who later acheived their own big and small screen fame appear early in their careers here. Highly recommended, if you've got the money to spend on a collection like this. If you don't, why not try robbing a bank or peddling ilicit booze and see whether you can escape being apprehended by the Untouchables?",1400544000,26,1348,4.960176991150442

It beats ANYTHING on network TV or cable. Yes, there was lots of violence, but that was the reality of living back in that era. It wasn't a ""kinder, gentler"" time. The Untouchables brings that era back to life. And the black and white filming makes it even more realistic.",1383609600,33,620,4.353448275862069
7549105,5,B018IDVBH6,"My dad watched this every week. As a kid I wasn't allowed to stay up that late. It has not replayed on TV. I don't know why but I did like the combined episodes made into a couple of movies. Now I am getting to see the whole series and it is really interesting. I know that some of it is fictionalized but the premise is the same- showing the grip that the gangsters had on society. I never heard anyone talk about the start of the narcotics trade once Prohibition ended and how the Mob who initially shunned the distribution ended up running it.

The first season covers the sensational gang murders and alcohol rackets. All the machine gun action you expected. I know that some of it is fictionalized but the premise is the same- showing the grip that the gangsters had on society. You can't miss the greed, lack of morals, and love of power that the bosses displayed. Seems like a preview of the current financial/political news.

By the third season, the major Chicago gangster stories had been told. So stories from other cities like San Francisco were shown with the added fiction of Elliot Ness being in those locations. The stories are still entertaining but just don't capture the open warfare that went on in Chicago. Several stories deal with the weeks and months prior to the end of Prohibition with the gangsters knowing that they have to move into other illegal activities.

The Show falls into the same category as ""The Twilight Zone,"" with solid acting, guest stars who went on to bigger-and-better roles, and thoughtful production.  Compare ""The Untouchables"" to the meaningless, nonsensical programming today.  Of course, fans of contemporary Shows, like ""Two-and-a-Half-Men"" would think of ""The Untouchables"" as boring and not very entertaining.

8742387,5,B018IDVBH6,"The first 3 seasons are rivetting in a strange sort of way. The narration by Walter Winchell adds that moralistic touch - some of the closing comments are just so brilliant in a late 50s/early 60s way. These seasons are close to the original story line. It is not particularly melodramatic. It shows how Ness began the process of laboratory use for solving crimes and other things that we don't think of with respect to the Untouchables. It is extremely violent; we see the failures without any sugar-coating; the mistakes in judgement that Ness and his colleagues made. I could quibble about some of it, but on the whole you actually do get an idea of the hell that prohibition wrought. One episode has Ness telling a bunch of prostitutes that they should band together against their pimp and demand better treatment - a bit of a surprise (particularly since it was filmed in the moralistic 50s). It doesn't sugar-coat the reasons why people supported the breaking of prohibition - nor the poverty of that period. There were other little gems that make this a worthwhile watch. At times, it does seem rather formulaic - a problem that afflicts the 4th season because they had to make up stories from scratch.
But the first 3 seasons are a window into 2 different pasts - the ultra-violent Chicago of the 20s and early 30s and the beginning of the adulation of the FBI in the 50s - but to give them credit, there is no whitewashing/revision of the past - just a bit of 50s moralizing.
