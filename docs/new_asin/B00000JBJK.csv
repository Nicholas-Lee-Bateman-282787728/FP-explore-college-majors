1231814,5,B00000JBJK,"Emperor of the North is a lost masterpiece.  My parents took me to see it when I was eight years old - they thought it had something to do with Santa Claus - boy did they get a shock!  This movie is visceral and violent and thrilling - and it has one of the scariest, most menacing characters in film history:  Earnest Borgnine as Shack, the demonic train conductor.  When Shack confronts Kieth Carradine's character in the station house after he's caught riding the train, you can almost see the fires of Hell burning in Borgnine's eyes -- never before or since have I seen an actor so convincingly transform into a demon - without makeup.  Get this movie!",990057600,11,657,4.487394957983193
1231815,5,B00000JBJK,"A movie for any fan of Ernest Borgnine, Lee Marvin or Trains.  Set in the Great Depression of the late 20's - 30's. Borgnine portrays Shack, a conductor whose disregard for hobos is legendary.  Lee Marvin as A Number One, is the quintessential rider of the rails, who is forced to deal with Shack and a young upstart ""bo"" played by Keith Carradine.  A great story! Watch for the scene with the constable ""barking like a dog""!

1231816,5,B00000JBJK,"This film tops my list for neglected masterpieces. It is so packed with meat and metaphor that it would require 100 viewings to catch them all. This is the story of a train bound for the afterlife, basically, with all  of humanity packed in its compartments, represented by the existential  battle between Marvin and Borgnine (the ultimate hand to hand combat, with  the fate of mankind held in the balance). Definitely the apex of both their  careers, and Carradine's as well. This is such a superb piece of cinema  that it was destined, precisely because of its depth, to go sailing over  the heads of American audiences. Storytelling in its most elemental and  purest form. A myth worthy of Homer or Hesiod. Art, in other words, in the  truest sense. I can't think of a greater distillation of the eternal  struggle, a more perfect microcosm of existence, than this movie provides.  An absolute masterpiece, and my highest possible level of applause and  recommendation.",963532800,27,973,4.9079754601226995

No bo has ever ridden  shacks rails and lived to tell the tale.  But, A#1 is no ordinary Bo. He's  The Emperor of the Norht Pole.

I have been looking for it for years since tv stations stopped running it years ago. I havn't seen it  in over 10 years and am ordering my copy now. I would suggest that anyone  else who loves railroad movies do the same before it disappears from  production. Hands down the best rail movie ever. Excellent.
This movie  takes place in the Salem-Eugene area of Oregon during the great depression.  It involves the sadistic engineer of the #19 named Shack (played by Ernest  Borgnine) and the hobo who tries to ride his train (Lee Marvin).

1231822,5,B00000JBJK,"In the late 60's and early 70's. There was a constant flow of really great movies coming out of the ""new hollywood"". Directors were able to push the envelope and create works of realistic and character rich films with original themes. The movies weren't copycat.

This movie stands out because of the consistently excellent work from it's actors. Lee Marvin was at this point by all accounts a leading man and Ernest Borgnine was at the very top of his game. It had been almost 20 years since he had won his Oscar for ""Marty"" (1955). He had developed to become an incredibly nasty character actor that I really miss in todays market. In this movie his role is played with such conviction that when I saw this movie in the mid 70's in my small hometown theater. It haunted me for weeks and I never forgot it.

Today, I'm a musician and the musical backdrop for most of this film is horrible. It is peppy and anthemic when it should be like a slow moving frieight train that is filled with sadistic conductors and homeless, desperate men with nothing to lose.

Otherwise this story is terrific entertainment.",1132099200,,1106,4.575757575757576
1231823,4,B00000JBJK,"Emperor of the North is like a good quality comic book.  Don't let your expectations get too high and you'll enjoy it.  The acting is way over the top and many of the lines are truly atrocious.  Also, Keith Carradine, in one of his early roles, plays one of the most obnoxious characters I've ever seen in a movie.  However, Emperor of the North is hard to beat, being a movie set in the beautiful Northwest (scenery being finely contrasted with the grunge and dirt of the railroad yards) during the Great Depression with lots of trains, action aboard trains, and a truly evil bad guy in Ernest Borgnine, who has one of the greatest bad guy names in moviedom:  ""Shack.""  If the movie had taken itself more seriously, with better writing and more controlled acting, it could have rated 5 stars.

1231825,4,B00000JBJK,"1933 - The depths of the great depression.  Armies of homeless men roamed the land stealing rides on the the railroad!  They were nomads who lived by no laws but their own!  Dedicated to their destruction was the railroad man who stood between their destiny and survival.

Lee Marvin is 'A #1' a hobo among hobos; living by his wits going from one hobo camp to another, hopping rides on a passing train to where ever he pleases.  When, he learns about 'Shack's reputation for getting bo's off his train, ""A #1"", for lack of anything better to do, announces he'll ride Shack's train, the 19, to Portland, Ore.

Ernest Borgnine is the evil conductor 'Shack', a true sadist when dealing with ANY 'bo' he catches riding his freight train without a ticket!  He carefully chooses between a length of chains, a steel hammer and/or his steel locking pin tied to a cable and dragged under the moving train destrying anyone between the moving ground and bottom of the railroad car!

Keith Carridine is a punk kid called 'cigaret' who's long on mouth, short on ears and deficient in brains, invites himself along for the ride.

""Emperor of the North"" is an action adventure period piece that was over looked by audiences when it was released in 1973, but I don't know why! This is a testosterone fuelled story of a man who loves his freedom and another man who loves his job...a little too much! And the 'cigaret' smoke that gets in their eyes!

1231826,4,B00000JBJK,"Definitely not a film for the faint hearted, director Robert Aldrich places he-men actors Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine on opposing sides in this violent story about hobo's attempting to ride rail freight cars for free during the Great Depression. Fiery Ernest Borgnine once again demonstrates his perfection at playing malevolent screen villains with his sinister portrayal of ""Shack"", a railway guard with a murderous disposition towards the homeless men crossing the country looking for work. In fact, Borgnine's character is very like the bully that he depicted as ""Coley Trimble"" in ""Bad Day At Black Rock"", and even the sadistic ""Fatso Judson"" in ""From Here To Eterninty"".  Opposing the psychotic ""Shack"" is fellow screen tough guy Lee Marvin, who plays the crafty and cool headed hobo ""A Number One"", keen to take on the challenge to ride ""Shack's "" deadly train and to survive the journey with his life intact !

Fine support is given by a young Keith Carradine as the wise cracking, know it all hobo ""Cigaret"", as well as engaging performances from character actors, Charles Tyner, Simon Oakland and Elisha Cook Jr. Credit should also be given to props, make up and wardrobe departments, as the film has a genuine 1930's feel to it, and watching the production, it often reminds me of another first rate Depression Era movie.....""Hard Times"" with Charles Bronson & James Coburn.

""Emperor of the North"" has a gritty, earthy feel to the entire film, and you can sense that Aldrich was eager to depict a legendary show down between two fiercely opposed individuals, that were perhaps forgotten amongst the many tales of woe and hardship told during the Depression years. Robert Aldrich had a great knack for directing intense, testosterone laden films that were very popular with male audiences. Chances are you are already a fan of some of his past work including ""The Dirty Dozen"", ""The Flight Of The Phoenix"", ""The Longest Yard"" or ""Twilights Last Gleaming"".

If you have not seen ""Emperor Of The North"", then by all means, watch it !  For those of us who are already fans....we are still waiting for the film to be released on DVD !!",1118534400,32,2145,4.898071625344353

1231829,5,B00000JBJK,"Emperor Of The North is one of those films I can watch time and time again, and still pick up something that I have not noticed before. It is a brutal and relentless watching experience. It is also a tremendous essay on humanity, and depicts a no holds barred vision of real life during the 1930s Great Depression.
Alongside 'Twilight's Last Gleaming', I regard it as one of Robert Aldrich's best films.

Set during the Great Depression it tells the story of 'A Number One', a hobo/tramp who is a legend amongst his community as being able to go anywhere where he likes. The mode of travel for the hobo community is the steam trains of the era, and these are fantastically realised by Aldrich. In the film, they are noisy, monsters of iron that thunder down the tracks. With a formidable reputation among the rail workers too, Marvin's laconic 'A Number One' takes on the greatest challenge of his career when he decides to ride a train which is the preserve of a feared and terrifying guard called 'The Shack' superbly played by Ernest Borgnine, with an unpleasantly convincing degree of psychotic intensity. Indeed, the Shack is a psychopath who kills any hobos that set foot on his train, let alone attempt to ride it. To date no hobo has ever done just that and the stage is set for one hell of a show down.....
Accompanying Marvin, is 'Old Cigarette' a youthful hobo played by Keith Carradine who is still learning the trade. Carradine gives a convincing performance, a nervy mix of cockiness and naivete. However, the performances of both Borgnine and Marvin dominate proceedings and are amongst both actors' very best.

Aldrich as ever, lets the detail of the period enter the film and there are many wry and ironic scenes. The scene where the current US President is broadcasting on the radio, inviting any US citizen to tell the government how they could spend their budget better, while the listeners are all tramps in squalid conditions is typical. A similarly wry scene shows a Baptist congregation in the river preaching forgiveness until they realise that their clothes have been stolen, then as a mob they go looking for vengeance....
Neither does Aldrich pulls punches with his depiction of how the railway workers view the tramps which is at best with contempt. Even the Cops are depicted as desperate victims of the times who will arrest a tramp, lock him away indefinitely, and pocket the two dollars a day that the government pays for the person's upkeep, instead of following statutory sentences and guidelines
The film is unflinchingly violent and the squeamish should probably look elsewhere.

The film was not a success in its cinema release but has since deservedly acquired a reputation as a cult movie. People who see it for the first time tend to be amazed by it and ask why they have not seen it before? Says it all really.
And yes I am in total agreement with other reviewers on here - RELEASE THIS FILM ON DVD!",1110326400,8,2941,4.706796116504854

Aldrich's slection of Borgnine as the ""Bull"", Marvine as the ""Bo"" and Carridine as the ""apprentice"" couldn't have been better.  And I like train movies.

It is 1933, the depths of the Great Depression, and 1/4 of Americans are unemployed. A mobile army of homeless men roams the country looking for temporary work, stealing rides on the rails. They are nomads who live by no law but their own, and the Railroad Man is dedicated to their destruction. On the Portland route, that man is a ruthless conductor who the paying passengers only rule applies with deadly reverence.

""Emperor of the North (Pole)"" is a fine, elaborately staged action melodrama -- a king-of-the-hill movie -- set in the American Northwest during the Great Depression. In it, a rivalry becomes deadly when two hobos commit to riding the freight train of a ruthless conductor who would rather kill than let hobos steal a ride on his train.

Lee Marvin stars as the old veteran hobo, A-No. 1, a jaunty, aging hobo who takes up a challenge by his peers to ride the freight train captained, or conductored, by Ernest Borgnine as the psychotic trainman named Shack, going from somewhere to Eugene, Ore. Nobody has ever successfully freeloaded on Shack's train. Indeed, even before the title credits roll we are treated to the sight of one of the Shack's hapless hobo victims. The suspense of the film is unrelenting and the performances first-rate, including that of Keith Carradine as a loudmouth kid hobo to whom Marvin tries to teach the rules of the road.

Director Robert Aldrich and the author have created almost perfect action-movie characters, people who can't bore us with their earlier histories because they don't have any. They exist solely within the time and the action of the film itself. When it stops, they vanish, but we have had a sensational ride. The ending is so hugely violent that its PG rating is a mystery.

The film does a great job at showing how tough life was for the homeless and the jobless during the Great Depression, and showing the hard life that faced the hobos during the period. It clearly depicts how they were set aside from normal society as they wondered around the country hopping freight trains looking for work.

This is also the ultimate train lover's film. It was shot on the Oregon, Pacific and Eastern railway and Burlington Northerns mainline between Banks and Vernonia, Oregon. Taking place in and around 1930's freight yards with 90% on and around an old Oregon, Pacific and Eastern 2-8-2- Mikado type locomotive, #19, and its string of freight cars.

An unusual, uncompromising and much underrated film. I highly recommend it.

The title, BTW, is a reference to a joke among hobos during the Great Depression, poking fun at their own desperate plight. The world's greatest hobo was proclaimed, ""Emperor of the North Pole"", and ruling over a wasteland.

He meats out his law and order by basically sadistically killing the hobos he catches trying to ride his train. He does this most of the time by bashing in their head with a ballpine hammer.

Enter hobo A #1 Lee Marvin. It seems that everybody despises the conductor, played by Ernest Borgnine marvelously, so much that even the men that work under him fear him and want to get back at him. They hatch a scheme to make a challenge that the greatest hobo around A #1 says he can and will ride The Shack's (Borgnine) train.
