7959974,5,B0000640SU,"I am glad to see that the 4:3 or original version of DBZ is still sold.
Here the english voices are not re-dubbed ( they re-dubbed the voices of majin buu in the orange brick version which is cropped, etc), and the disc offers the original japanese cast.",1392940800,,254,4.3125
7959975,4,B0000640SU,"On this part of the Perfect Cell Saga, Tien, the 3-eyed dude, tries to stop Cell from becoming complete by using his Tri-beam attack, but it drained most of his life force. So Goku went down to the battlefield to rescue his friend until he sensed Piccolo's life force, but it was faint though. They narrowly escapes back to Kami's place when Vegeta and Trunks come out of the hyperbolic Time Chamber. Anxious to try out his new powers, Vegeta raced to the location Cell was at and Trunks wasn't to far behind. With Vegeta surpassing a super saiyan, it looks like Cell can forget about becoming complete. Can Vegeta finally accomplished what no one else was able to do? Watch more of the Saga and Find OUT!!",1055462400,,706,4.5234375
7959976,5,B0000640SU,"if you love dbz, then this video is just another part of this great series... i enjoyed the android saga as one of my personal favorites of all the sagas, and all the cell sagas are just a continuim of that... so if you're looking to complete your series for the cell sagas, then this is a must have...",1032566400,,302,4.135593220338983
7959977,4,B0000640SU,"This video is more of a filler then action. The first episode SACRIFICE is the best one because... well i don't want to spoil it but tien makes a stunning move that no one would have ever thought possible from him. The other two episodes, SAIYANS EMERGE, and SUPER VEGETA, are mostly just talking and aren't very action packed, but if you are a die hard fan like me i would buy these videos. Also don't buy the edited videos they stink the uncut ones are the way to go!! P.S. The cover for the video is wrong that sceen happens like in three videos away from this one. Thanks",984355200,2,575,4.236363636363636
7959978,5,B0000640SU,"Cell doesn't even absorb 18 in this video.  He's only still in his second form, and they consider him perfect?!  Good video though, very entertaining.",984355200,,150,4.96
