8564004,2,B00B86HFTE,"I'm a HUGE Ultraman fan and I think in general that Zero is a great new version of Ultraman.  But this movie is just not up to the current standards of the Ultra series.  Sure, part of the fun of the Ultra series is how cheesy the effects are, but the effects in this one are just lazy - I mean really, a broken glass sky to represent inter-dimensional portal.  c'mon!  And it's filled with old Ultra themes - a lost battlenizer, a Raionix who can't control himself (but doesn't really ever do any damage), a crazy evil woman with a shrill evil laugh....  Nuthin' new in this one.  Get yourself a copy of Ultraman Saga or Mega Monster Battle for a much better experience.",1411257600,,671,4.328
