I also watched her Edsa Woolworth movie 4x thru the pay-per-view Filipino channel. She's my favorite and I hope to meet her one day when I visit the Philippines. Sorry, I don't have a photo to submit but I'd like to let her know that I am her oldest fan (75 yrs. old).",1428019200,,405,4.012345679012346
8516464,3,B007GOP57Q,"I think this movie was pretty good at potraying the life struggles of many people choosing to work abroad. That American family in which the main character was working for didn't really seem that realistic to me. I believe the director should have thought of a better plot for this particular family line. Besides all of that,I think the movie was very acceptable in showing how people will make hard sacrifices inorder for the family to have a better life. Thank you",1336089600,,467,4.7073170731707314
8516465,5,B007GOP57Q,"now, this is a good story. The turn over in the end was really good. I am glad she decided to leave and go home. My mom as well left for United States. She had to work here to provide us a better future. It was really hard, and I can relate to the kids as well. Having their mom gone for a while will develop a sense of ""not so used"" to mom being there and there's an awkward atmosphere. But I am glad, in the end, it all worked out well. I am proud and thankful for the OFW's who work hard. More power to you guys!",1335657600,,515,3.7339449541284404
