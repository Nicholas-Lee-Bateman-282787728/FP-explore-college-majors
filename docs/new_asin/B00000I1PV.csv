1218867,1,B00000I1PV,"First if all, this tape is so dated. The picture quality is really bad. Secondly, Gilad goes non-stop through the aerobics segment. After a while my chest started hurting. A better bet would be Kathy Smith who works in intervals. And the incessant couning drove me nuts. And there is this one guy in he back who is so distracting. He keeps counting loudly and answering Gilad all the time. This tape is terrible. After a while, I just was hoping to end the bouncing around. It felt like the longest tape. The music is awful. I started muting it and playing my own cd's.",993168000,3,569,4.428571428571429
1218868,4,B00000I1PV,"Gilad's Fat Burning Workout is fun and easy to follow. The steps are basic, nothing dancy. I love Leslie Sansone and now I found someone else who realizes that you don't have to learn fancy dance steps to burn fat. You can pop this tape right into the VCR and just get to the fat burning. If you like the dance steps don't get this tape. But if you you're like me and just want to get the heart rate up and not waste time with the rewind button, give this a try. And check out Leslie, too! This tape does have a lot of jogging and jumping but it's mixed with lower impact so it's not too difficult. (Interval training)",985132800,10,618,4.115702479338843
1218869,5,B00000I1PV,"What a great addition to my collection! Gilad is a great instructor, helps you maintain form, gives suggestions for beginners, and does not have that ""cheerleader"" attitude that can get downright insulting 20 minutes into an aerobic video.  This is actually fun!  Don't get me wrong, you will sweat, you will breath heavy - this is work.  But, there is nothing terribly complicated.  This is not a dancy workout. Very staightforward, pulse-raising aerobic activity.  A couple of his assitants are aggravating, but not enough so to make me put this tape away.",980467200,5,558,5.021739130434782
1218870,5,B00000I1PV,"Gilad's workout is easy to follow.  I don't spend time trying to figure out the moves or foot work. Gilad keeps you informed what to do, how to do it and when a change in movements is about to happen.  If you've given up on exercise videos because of problems keeping up with the instructor, then I'd recommend Gilad.  Gilad's videos are based on ""good science"".  Gilad always starts out with warm-ups, he then picks up the pace, and then brings you back down with a cool down.  He also explains how to follow along if you are having difficulty during the higher intensity levels so that you won't have to quit altogether.  In addition to a good sense of humor, Gilad has a pleasant and encouraging tone of voice.  You won't find better videos for exercise than videos by Gilad.  I do wish that Gilad workouts were formatted in DVD - I've had my Gilad tapes for years; but, wonder how long they'll last.  Please let me know when Gilad on DVD becomes available.",974764800,8,960,4.44
1218871,5,B00000I1PV,"I like this workout because it is pretty simple.  Don't get me wrong--it's not a beginner's routine--it gets my heart rate up every time. (Although, it can be modified for beginners...Gilad suggests using little or no arm movements, and/or marching in place when tired, etc.). But it is not dancey, not complicated--just straightforward fat-burning.  Gilad starts you out with a 7 minute warmup, and then moves into 30 minutes of high and low impact aerobics. Finally, there is a 5 minute cool-down with some stretching.  The music is actually pretty good, and doesn't really seem dated. The moves are really easy to follow, there aren't a lot of fast-paced changes (although the workout is fairly fast-paced at times), and he doesn't add on and go ""from the top.""  If you like straightforward stuff, this video is for you. Gilad himself is motivating and he has this great accent. He likes to say things in a regimented voice, as in ""and-just-8-more-times"" but he says it in such a way that it is charming and makes me laugh out loud almost every time. I really like this video--it is one of my favorites.",970444800,83,1106,4.774869109947644
1218872,5,B00000I1PV,"I also like this workout.  However, I ordered this thinking it was a new  video.  It is the same 45 minute workout that is part of Gilad's Split  Routine Video Package.",964656000,5,168,4.32258064516129
1218873,5,B00000I1PV,"This is a great easy to use, easy to learn video. Gilad combines an upper and lower body workout that is pure old school aerobics. This is not a dance video, or a boxing video this is an aerobics video. The soundtrack is  decent and he stayed away from current songs so it does not feel dated. He  is motivating without being annoying the workout is fun. Although this is  not a workout for a beginner one can modify it and work up to its level.",964483200,4,445,4.151162790697675
1218874,4,B00000I1PV,"Before I had my son, I used to work out with Firm tapes, but after he was born it was hard to find the time and energy they required. I found an easier, quicker aerobic workout with this tape. It's easy to do, but still  enough to get my heart-rate up (and can be adjusted ""down"" some  for off days.) Amazon's customer support was also terrific: the first tape  I ordered arrived broken. When I told Amazon's customer service, they  immediately sent me a replacement tape with a mailer to send back the  broken one.",940118400,4,515,4.378947368421053
1218875,4,B00000I1PV,I liked this video very much.  He keeps you on the move without being too complicated.  He also explains every step completely.  I will keep this one a long while.,939254400,4,163,4.366666666666666
7909426,4,B00000I1PV,"it works and it helps u loss weight. (Thats all u need to know.)

but yea.....its kinda boring(but hey, i dun think there's one tape which is not boring on earth.)

i've been working on this tape for 5-6 weeks, 4 times a week, and have dropped around 6 lbs, and i look like i've lost 10 lbs. it helps me get into a better shape and now i can fit into my skinny jean. (size 0)",1107820800,,375,3.857142857142857
7909427,5,B00000I1PV,"Believe it or not, I must have the first release of this video and I keep coming back to it! The copyrighted dates are 1990 and 1992...Anyway, it's a great workout without the fancy moves that are normally in aeorobic/exercise tapes. Gilad gives good examples of correct positioning and emphasizes the importance of the warm-up, conditioning and cool-down portions of a workout. Even though his workouts are not done to 'music', I enjoy the Hawaiian drums and beats that are different from every other exercise video I have. I just wish he was still giving us more of what he does best...more workout options!",1063843200,2,609,4.865384615384615
7909428,4,B00000I1PV,"This is a great workout. It is easy to follow, but very high energy. DO NOT buy this video if you already have the Gilad Split Routine workout. The Fat Burning video in the Split Routine set is the same, although they have different covers and different copyright dates. Just want to save you the $ by giving you the headsup that they are the same videos!",1055894400,6,355,4.313432835820896
7909429,5,B00000I1PV,"As someone who's been working out w/videos for almost 6 years, and uses a heart monitor during every workout, it's seems like it's tough for me to find a floor aerobics video that actually gets my heart rate in the higher end of my target range. At first, it seemed like the marching and the limited space needed would not do my any good, but there are so many variations during the workout, I found my heart rate moving from high to low several times. Overall, the video is a keeper for several reasons: 1) On days where I don't feel like doing anything, I can do a simple workout that will challenge me; 2) It's a much-needed variation to my usual step aerobics - I would consider it an interval challenge since my heart rate range does fluctuate a bit; 3) Gilad is annoying yet funny at the same time, which is a nice change to see a bit more personality in an exercise video 4) There is a flub toward the end and they actually kept it in; at first, I was surprised they wouldn't edit it out, but it actually works in this video, meaning that it keeps things light; a lot of exercise videos out there have that ""fake"" feel to them 'cause they're trying so hard to make the workout look perfect.",1037836800,13,1197,4.277533039647577
7909430,2,B00000I1PV,"I bought this video because of the glowing recommendations that I read here.  BUT...after doing the workout three times (I always give things a second and third try before finalizing my opinion)...I would definitely have to say that I am disappointed.
The workout is extremely repetitive and I found myself getting bored on the first time through.  I am fairly new to exercising and was disappointed to find that this workout didn't keep my heartrate up unless I made the movements more high impact than the tape suggested.  I also found the workout to be difficult on my ankles (I have never had a problem like that with any other tape or fitness program I have tried).
The only reason that I gave this two stars instead of one is that it did get my heart rate up when I modified the routine.  It may also be good for serious beginners or people that do not want ANY interesting choreography at all.
If you are thinking about getting this tape, get Taebo Live instead.  It has a similar format, but it is much more entertaining and you get a much better workout!",1028851200,7,1063,4.515625
7909431,5,B00000I1PV,"The winning formula present in this and other Gilad videos is uncomplicated, no-nonsense moves that get your heart pumping and increase your fitness level over time. What I like about this video in particular is that you really can modify the moves to your level of fitness. For example, I often run in place instead of marching, resulting in more challenging routine with probably twice as much fat burning. I would recommend that for advanced exercisers or those who are bored with the same routine. Gilad is a great coach, constantly motivating you to keep up your energy. This video is not as strenuous as ""Best of Bodies in Motion"", but it's great for when you're short on time and ready to sweat!",1019952000,7,702,4.715447154471545
7909432,5,B00000I1PV,"After whatching Bodies in Motion with Gilad on the Health channel, I just  had to get it. I knew right of the back that I would get a good workout with Gilad and it was definatly money well spent. Some may say his moves are old and out dated, however, Gilad keeps it excitting and definatly gets the heart pumping. You always know what to expect from him as he counts out the moves and encourages you to do the same. Beware, he gets excited at times and slips in another 8 in addition to his last ""and 8 more"". Get it! You'll enjoy it and you'll feel and see results fast.",1019692800,,572,4.107142857142857
7909433,5,B00000I1PV,"This tape is really fun to do. I agree with 99% of the other reviews and I don't know what to say about this video that isn't already said in the other reviews. I would like to say Gilad deserves a real pat on the back for his counting and his ability to stay focused. I have so many videos from yoga to strength training, and EVERY one has mistakes (understandably) in them. For example the instructor will say ""10 more"" and only do 9. Or say ""5 more seconds"" and do the move for 3...you get what I mean. However this tape stays right on track. You will not feel left behind when the moves change. There is a lot of counting (as a reviewer pointed out), but I found it so helpful you know how many to do and where you are in the set. MOST IMPORTANT if you are counting out loud = you are breathing and we all know you have to keep breathing while working out...""don't hold your breath"" ect.... I think this tape can be used by beginners just modify the moves as Gilad says or march in place...just keep moving. This is an aerobic tape nothing more, nothing less. This tape is not dated as others have said. The music is upbeat. I gave this 5 stars, couldn't have asked for more from this tape.",1004486400,6,1194,4.150862068965517
7909434,4,B00000I1PV,"This is more of an intermediate/advance exercise tape.  Although the moves are basic and the choreography simple, it is nonstop, definitely fat burning, with lots of high impact moves.  The tape is not difficult to learn but I did not have the stamina.  I can exercise to Leslie's Sansone's 4 mile aerobic walk but unfortunately do not have the endurance for Gilad.  This is a tape for someone who is in great physical shape or young in age.",999734400,2,441,4.615384615384615
7909435,5,B00000I1PV,"I started doing this tape and the hips, arms, and thighs toning tape back in March and in 12 weeks I lost 21 lbs.  I have plateaued but am still alternating these two tapes 5 days a week and seeing dramatic results...my sleep has improved...I have more energy...my muscles are more toned and the inches are coming off...4 inches off bust, 3 inches off waist and 3 inches off hips.  Amazing!",995241600,4,390,4.47887323943662
