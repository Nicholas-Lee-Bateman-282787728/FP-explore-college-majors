3820502,4,B001VC99DU,"THE NEW DETECTIVES, as seen on The Discovery Channel, takes you into the real world of high-tech detection and crime solution, following the trail of clues along with renowned forensic experts and criminal investigators. These modern Sherlocks employ a variety of extraordinary techniques, using anthropology, physiology, chemistry, entomology, psychology and computer technology, to solve today's crimes.

This show is really great. If, like me, you enjoy watching shows like ""Forensic Files"", ""48 Hours Mysteries"", or ""Dateline NBC"", then you'll have a great time watching THE NEW DETECTIVES. The way each cases are presented, the narration, the acting, the people interviewed, everything is great about this show. I recommend this show to anybody having an interest from Criminology and Real life mysteries. :)

8345938,4,B001VC99DU,"This series is really interesting.  Some of the cases are well known and have been over done since they occurred,, but the programs are always fascinating.  Sometimes, since many of the cases are older, the forensics are not as precise as they are now which makes the show drag a bit.",1441584000,,284,4.549019607843137
