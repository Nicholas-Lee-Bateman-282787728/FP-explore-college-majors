3615520,5,B001GLX6US,"The classic and classy version . No offense to Adam Sandler - I like his Mr. Deeds movie too , but it's story lacks the total quality of this original . The lead character here is more real and is funny without trying to be , and honest , even heroic and simple without being clueless . Gary Cooper is one act I would not wish to follow . Jean Arthur is perfect . Starting all business as usual , then transformed into a truly caring person . Great entertainment can be done with your clothes on .",1483574400,,497,4.081632653061225
3615521,5,B001GLX6US,A classic and good restoration job for a movie released over 80 years ago. The booklet packaging is a nice bonus with behind-the-scenes information about the cast and film.,1483401600,,172,4.9655172413793105

3615523,5,B001GLX6US,"Frank Capra was one of the most popular filmmakers for audiences in the 1930's and 1940's and one of only two directors to have won three Oscars as Best Director in his long career(the other being William Wyler). Many of his films are now considered classics by film historians and critics with ""It's a Wonderful Life""(1946) frequently being shown on cable every Christmas. Capra worked for Columbia Pictures during the 1930's where he had his greatest success. Sony(which owns the Columbia film library) has been restoring on Blu-ray some of Capra's films from this period and their latest effort is ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town""(1936). Following an eight month restoration, Sony has done a frame by frame restoration in 4K from the original camera negative for it's 80th Anniversary and the results are once again outstanding. According to the liner notes by Jeremy Arnold that accompanies this new Blu-ray Digibook,  the original camera negative had undergone considerable damage due to overprinting that caused many scratches, torn, and even some missing frames over the years. Sony has now corrected all of that and their effort restoring ""Mr. Deeds"" on Blu-ray for the first time should please fans of the film. There are no vertical lines, dirt, scratches, etc. and the overall picture is nearly flawless from start to finish(Bitrate: 24.93). There is some minor softness during scene changes(Capra uses dissolves or wipes) but the B&W  cinematography by Joseph Walker is really highlighted now on Blu-ray. Both interiors and exteriors are very detailed with even the smallest props being clearly visible. Costumes are another delight with Gary Cooper's suits and Jean Arthur's outfits being especially detailed and prominent. As far as the acting, ""Mr. Deeds"" has been perfectly cast with Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur giving very believable and touching performances as the lead characters. The supporting cast includes a who's who of character actors including George Bancroft, Lionel Stander and Douglas Dumbrille giving standout performances. The Audio(English DTS-HD MA 2.0 & French, German, Spanish, Portuguese in Dolby Digital 2.0) is crystal clear and free of any noise artifacts(hiss, pops, crackle). ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"" is 116 minutes(Aspect ratio: 1.37:1) and contains the following subtitles: English SDH, French, German, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, Finnish, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Arabic, Hungarian, Korean, Hebrew, Japanese and Turkish. Special features include a commentary and feature by Frank Capra Jr. and the original theatrical trailer. This is another ""digibook"" from Sony similar to their previous digibook releases of ""You Can't Take It With You"" and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"". Like those two releases, there is an informative essay about the film printed on high gloss paper discussing the making of the film. ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"" is a highly entertaining film that has lost none of it's charm eighty years after it was first released in theaters. Sony has done another excellent Blu-ray presentation in it's continuing restoration project of bringing Frank Capra classic films to a new generation of viewers. Let's hope that ""Lost Horizon"" will get the same treatment for it's 80th Anniversary next year. Until then, ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"" should be a welcome addition to any home video library and comes highly recommended.",1482192000,,3381,5.329588014981273

3615525,5,B001GLX6US,"What a fun movie! Gary Cooper is awesome - his facial expressions and body language are amazing. And Jean Arthur is adorable as always.
Love the plot too. I wonder if the hero throwing occasional punches at the bad guys was to console the poor Americans of that period who wished they could get away with that.",1477526400,,310,4.456140350877193

3615527,5,B001GLX6US,"Released in 1936, but it is absolutely my favorite movie. I have three copies of it, just in case.

A greeting card writer (Gary Cooper) inherits a fortune, and wants to give it away to needy farmers. The financiers handling the inheritance want to prove him crazy and cheat him out of it. A newspaper reporter (Jean Arthur) is assigned to pose as a down and outer and get his attention, so she can discredit everything he says or does right on the front page and sell lots of papers. I'll stop there.

Rest assured if you like romantic comedies, no film has ever outdone this one. The 2002 remake with Adam Sandler, ""Mr. Deeds"", was very, VERY loosely based on this, and not nearly as good.",1471651200,,691,4.433070866141732

3615532,5,B001GLX6US,"Great depression era film about a small town content man who inherits twenty million dollars and is taken to the big city where he is harassed, viewed as a fool, and generally made fun of for being from a small town. Gary Cooper is absolutely brilliant in his acting mannerisms and gentle subtleties as he conveys how the character receives the news that the one girl he thinks he is in love with is secretly a reporter using him for a headline news story. Frank Capra is the director and does a fabulous job with the cast of talent that combine to make one of the great cinematic films of the 20th century.

3615560,5,B001GLX6US,"A masterpiece. I've never seen Capra so absolutely in charge of the visual imagery. The shots of Mr. Deeds on his almost involuntary ""silence-strike"" sitting in his hospital room looking out the window, looking just like a shadow or silhouette were so eloquent. This is billed as a comedy, but much of the material is very serious. A man who is so innocent and natural and a society that is so corrupt and unnatural. Thank God there's a loving, if very flawed, woman to save him. Both Cooper and Arthur are wonderfully weak and strong at the same time. I ended up buying this film.",1424822400,,581,4.542857142857143
3615561,5,B001GLX6US,A wonderful story I have seen a few times on TV.  It shows genuineness that some people can have and do have and who kept their integrity. Also there is no violence or bad language or  sex scenes.,1422835200,,196,4.131578947368421

3615572,5,B001GLX6US,"I should start with this review with a confession: I sometimes struggle to love and relate to many of the classic films that we're supposed to adore. I'll find myself objectively appreciating the acting and technique while secretly feeling like many of them are just too ""dated"" in their themes and overall tone for me to truly connect to.

Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, however, is a blissful exception---a classic that I find truly timeless and endlesslyrewatchable regardless of one's age or even general preferences in movies. Capra's trademark optimism and faith in humanity are prevalent here, but the movie avoids getting too sappy or overwrought. The witty dialogue and general humor still work as effectively today as they did when the film was made (that's certainly not a given, as tastes and senses of humor often change from one generation to the next!). Gary Cooper is absolutely sublime in the role that I consider among his very most memorable. Jean Arthur, who I'd never seen much of but now want to, is a refreshingly ""real"", flawed yet vibrant and lovable leading lady.

There's a timeless relevance to the movie's general themes (how people do and should view money, how the eccentric and different are often perceived as ""crazy"", the battle between idealism vs jaded cynicism, human connection ultimately trumping other considerations...etc.!) Mr. Deeds Goes to Town is funny, uplifting, heartwarming and just plain FUN---a sadly underrated quality in cinema and literature these days!----but, like the best of Capra, there are some wonderfully thought-provoking ideas and messages in addition to its sheer entertainment value.

I truly can't recommend this highly enough for movie lovers of all ages. I've seen a ridiculous number of movies, but if I could take just 5-10 DVDs to a desert island, this would be among them!",1410912000,,1838,5.099667774086379
3615573,5,B001GLX6US,This show was fun to Watch.  Gary Cooper fit the part perfectly.  As usual he has a special presence on the screen.  Insightfullness in the main character also added a special touch to the movie.  You were not really sure how the movie would turn out until the last few minutes.  I enjoyed watching the character Mr. Deets evolve though out the movie.,1408924800,,351,4.507936507936508

3615576,4,B001GLX6US,"There's a scene late in this movie where Cooper, as Deeds - a likeable but extremely nave country bumpkin come to the big city - has discovered that the woman he loves (Jean Arthur, in an appealing supporting role) has been lying to him. He doesn't say a word. Rather, he conveys the realization entirely with facial expressions. It's a shattering moment, and only an actor of Cooper's caliber could express such deep hurt so subtly. The scene solidified his career and established him as a movie star of the first rank, a distinction that would last for over 20 years. The movie also sealed the reputation of director Frank Capra as an unparalleled teller of uplifting tales of Americana. In retrospect, both men made much better movies, but this is the one that revealed the extent of their talents and presaged their many successes to come.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime/dp/B00L77YPJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime</a>",1404950400,,1066,5.796178343949045

3615602,5,B001GLX6US,"Mr Deeds Goes to Town (Frank Capra, 1936, 115')

An American screwball comedy - Longfellow Deeds, a simple-hearted Vermont tuba player, inherits a fortune and has to contend with opportunist city slickers - starring Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur, her in her first featured role. Based on the 1935 short story ""Opera Hat"" by Clarence Budington Kelland, serialized in the Saturday Evening Post, the script was written by Robert Riskin in his fifth collaboration with Frank Capra. Capra won his second Academy Award for Directing for Mr Deeds Goes to Town, while Cooper received the first of his five nominations for Best Actor. At the end of the year, the New York Film Critics and the National Board of Review named ""Mr Deeds"" the ""Best Picture of 1936.""

Capra's ""first, last and only choice"" for the pivotal role of the eccentric Longfellow Deeds was Gary Cooper. Due to Cooper's other commitments, production was delayed by six months, incurring costs of $100,000. Jean Arthur was not the first choice for the role, but Carole Lombard. Capra ""discovered"" his heroine in a rush screening. The opening sequences had to be reshot when Capra decided against the ""broad"" comedy approach that had originally been written. Compared to their unsatisfactory performance later in the year in the The Plainsman (cf my review 131us of 13/8/2012), Cooper and Arthur both do very well, though also here, Arthur remains the weaker partner.

Mr Deeds Goes to Town was the first Capra film to be released separately to exhibitors and not ""bundled"" with other Columbia features. On paper, it was his biggest hit, easily surpassing It Happened One Night. The film was generally treated as likable fare by critics and audiences alike. Noted British writer and reviewer Graham Greene was effusive that this was Capra's finest film to date, describing Capra's treatment as ""a kinship with his audience, a sense of common life, a morality..."" Variety noted ""a sometimes too thin structure [that] the players and director Frank Capra have contrived to convert (...) into fairly sturdy substance.""

Cast: Gary Cooper as Longfellow Deeds, Jean Arthur as Louise ""Babe"" Bennett/ Mary Dawson, George Bancroft as MacWade, Lionel Stander as Cornelius Cobb, Douglass Dumbrille as John Cedar, Raymond Walburn as Walter, H B Warner as Judge May, Ruth Donnelly as Mabel Dawson, Walter Catlett as Morrow, John Wray as Farmer.

3615603,5,B001GLX6US,"Mr Deed Goes to Town(Released April/36)which won an Academy award for best director,stars Gary Cooper and the(real life)ever-capricious Jean Arthur,in the roles that really put both of them on the fast track to stardom. Cooper was a perfect fit to play the hometown""hick"" of Longfellow Deeds,with that stoic,homespun innocence that he could project on a dime. Arthur plays her role wonderfully as the coloured and cynical NYC street reporter,who has earned her rep off the backs of those she has thrown under the bus numerous times.
The plot involves Cooper who is the hometown ""poet laureate"",so to speak. He devises and writes poems for greeting cards on a regular basis. In his off times he plays tuba in the local band and is a volunteer fire captain. Off in faraway Italy an uncle,whom he has had little to do with his entire life,dies in an auto accident and bequeaths his substantial fortune of $20 million to him alone. The uncle's attorney's switch into high gear in NYC and are determined to get his signature on paper so they may become his legal reps;so they may take him for all he is now worth. They personally bring him to NYC,trying to coerce him every step of the way to sign them up. Soon Deeds is slowly but surely being inundated with either claims to his fortune and/or people who just plain want what he has.
The newspapers are extremely curious as to what this guy is all about and they assign their toughest reporter to the case,Arthur. She gets in solid with Cooper who at first does not suspect a thing,as headline after headline appears in the paper each day,detailing his latest exploits. Over time Arthur falls for Cooper,and visa versa,but Arthur is having second thoughts about the whole thing. Before she can explain herself and finally come clean to Deeds,he finds out,and is naturally devastated. Also around this time Deeds comes close to becoming a walking piece of Swiss Cheese when a down and outer(remember,this is the Depression)who is desperate and hungry,waives a gun his way. He ends up feeding the man and decides then and there to give his money away by purchasing some land and giving around 2,000 people the chance to farm and eventually own it.
The attorneys who have been so eager to sign him up,now turn on him and he is arrested and put on trial as insane. At the hearing he is at first reluctant to say anything,much to the chagrin of his many new found friends who attend in droves,along with Arthur and her editor. Just as it looks the bleakest Deeds finally relents and testifies. His words dispel the myths and lies of others and he is eventually free of all charges. Deeds is carried out by his throng of friends as Arthur sits and cries. In a few moments Deeds rushes back into the courtroom,locking its doors behind him. He picks up Arthur and they kiss as the camera fades out.
As the films two mains stars are as believable as apple pie,so are its myriad of co stars. Douglass Dumbrille as the nasty attorney,Lionel Stander as Coopers ""guard"",HB Warner as the judge,Ruth Donnelly as Arthurs roommate,and so many others. Watch for ex Keystone comics Bobby Dunn and Billy Bevan in uncredited roles. It is a solid supporting cast from A-Z.This is one of those rare films where the most important elements,the cast and its chemistry and the plot on hand,just seem to meld together in perfect harmony.
Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp,but this is a film that,and it is hard to believe, had to be restored,not by the very company who owned it,but by the Library of Congress. As with many films of this period that were later loaned out to TV,the film's prints and negatives became over used and truncated and fell into a terrible state of disrepair. One cannot fathom letting films of this quality go into such disuse but they have and we have lost an untold number this way,and by such major studios who have grossly under estimated the value of what they have had and/or have been cash strapped and sold the negatives for their intrinsic value. Whatever the case here,we are very fortunate some agency stepped in to preserve this classic film from obscurity. So when you watch this you will see some inherent defects such as graininess,slight scratching and emulsion deterioration. It says it has been remastered but it needs a better treatment than what we have here. Extras include commentary,a short featurette with Frank Capra's son,trailers and theatre posters.
In conclusion you couldn't ask for a better film. This is Capra at his best and it showcases its stars to the hilt. With a wonderful supporting cast and plot it's a winner all the way. Recommended.",1343520000,,4637,4.74721189591078

3615605,5,B001GLX6US,"Remember Frank Capra? He's the director who made ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" which most people know as that heart-warming movie they see on TV every year at Christmas time. He made this one, too.

This is a thoroughly charming movie. Gary Cooper plays Mr. Deeds, a small-town young man who writes poetry for greeting cards. Interestingly, they refer to them as post cards in the movie, because in those days most greeting cards were post cards. Anyway, his rich uncle died and left him $20 million. A classic dream come true story, right? Except poor Mr. Deeds seems to get nothing but trouble out of it, including a savvy reporter (Jean Arthur) who pretends to faint near his front door and plays the starving working girl, a lady in distress for him to rescue. He's always had a romantic notion about the woman he would marry; his housekeeper mentioned it when the big city lawyer came to tell him about the estate.

So he goes off to New York, the reporter writes front-page articles about ""The Cinderella Man,"" but he doesn't know that the girl he is rapidly falling in love with is the reporter. He gets harassed by the board of the opera company, but has enough smarts that when they try to get him to cover their season's losses of $180,000, he says they must cut costs, cut ticket prices, show what people want to see, and put the opera on a paying basis.

He manages to see through several fraudulent claimants, but when a farmer who lost his farm and can't feed his family comes shouting at him and pulling out a gun, then drops the gun and cries, apologizing for his temporary insanity, Mr. Deeds treats him to the lunch he had arranged for his girl before his PR man told him she was the reporter who had been writing about him. And as the poor old farmer gobbles down the food, Mr. Deeds is thinking.

Next thing you know, he's got a plan: he's going to buy up a large tract of land, and give every dispossessed farmer who applies to him ten acres, a plow, a cow and some seed. If they work it for three years, they get title to the land. Of course, he gets thousands of applicants, but he also gets a sanity hearing from a cousin who figures he should have gotten the money instead of Deeds. (Or rather the cousin's greedy wife does.) So the final scene is the sanity hearing. And this being Frank Capra, he not only is declared sane, but he gets his girl.

This is a classic of feel-good humor with a grace and charm which made Frank Capra famous.",1337385600,,2459,4.395604395604396

3615607,5,B001GLX6US,"Like most other reviewers, I love this movie.  I won't rehash the plot because so many others have done so; I'm actually writing this in hopes of finding out if anyone else thinks there is a scene missing from this edition (Remastered, Sony, 2008).  I thought that in addition to seeing the snobbery at the reception hosted by Deeds, we got to see him throwing the bums out; instead we just hear about it after the fact.  I know that other classic films have been butchered, and I always look for a complete print ... I'm not sure that this one qualifies.",1322870400,,555,4.421568627450981
3615608,2,B001GLX6US,"If you prefer simplistic answers to complex problems, this movie is right in your wheelhouse.  Please note:  simplistic is not the same as simple.  If you don't know the difference, look it up.

The Great Depression, when this movie was made, certainly qualifies as complex.  Mr. Deeds' solution is a literal sock in the jaw for anyone who crosses him, and he never even gets arrested for assault.  In fact, the fisticuffs are treated humorously.  It's akin to Dirty Harry's solution to crime.  And Mr. Deeds tries to give away farms, purchased by the money he inherited from an uncle he scarcely knew existed.  For this, he is taken to court to test his sanity.  Naturally he tries to explain his way out of it, and I'm not giving away any great secret by saying that he is successful.  He gets the girl, socks the bad lawyer, and goes home happy as Ole Lonesome Rhodes.  It's all as simplistic as that.

The director received an Academy Award for this draught of pablum, and I can't imagine why--except that in the ethos of 1935 this went down as smoothly as a vanilla milkshake.  Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur are the hero and his turtle dove, walking through this mess hip deep.  They don't do much for it.

3615611,4,B001GLX6US,"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town is a bit of an off-beat humor film and does not have the spirit of other Frank Capra's film.  Jean Arthur plays a similar character she played in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, where she sees some pleasantness in the naivety of the main character and falls for him.

In Mr. Deeds however, she plays a tough news reporter who sets up this nave heir to a $20 million dollar fortune, pretends to be in love with him in order to get the scoop.  As she maligns him all over the newspapers and Deeds is getting  more and more depressed, he tells her that she is the only one who is trustworthy in this strange New York place.

Since she's causing it, she feels like crap.  She tells her editor that she wants out and eventually does so.  Lawyers who want his money trump up charges of insanity and then take Deeds before an sanity hearing to get his money.  This interrupts Deeds' plan to create farm jobs for hundreds of homeless, out of work farmers.  This film was made during the Depression, so this topic would resonate with audiences.

Unlike Mr. Smith, Mr. Deeds (played by Gary Cooper) has no clue as to his naivety. He does at times make some surprisingly intelligent decisions about his company that he is trying to run, but Gary does not have the verge of a Jimmy Stewart (Smith).

What I really disliked about the film was how Deeds totally gives up and does not allow any kind of help from counsel and lets the court hearing run without any feedback from himself.  He could not care less that he will be locked up in a mental hospital.

Several things wrong with that.  First, I understand how he feels being personally destroyed by a woman who he thought loved and trusted him and how the folks he's met were really after the bottom line and couldn't care less.  However second, without his help those farmers are going to be out of work for good.

The character Deeds, whom I felt some sympathy, really lost it in my book.  He completely quit and let his enemies steamroll him.  And this went on and on and on, 20 minutes of this.  Dang!

Finally when Arthur's character declares that she loves Deeds, then he snaps out of it.  Who cares if he throws hundreds of farmers out of a job and the bad guys get his money?

Well the ending ended as these all do, on an upbeat.  But even Frank Capra's worst is still better than a lot of today's Hollywood films, so one can't complain that one would not be entertained.

Mildly recommended!

3615615,5,B001GLX6US,"This movie is much better than the more celebrated Mr. Smith Goes To Washington.  The reason is the story line and Kapra's darker vision.  Unlike Jimmy Stewart in Mr. Smith, who remains the unredeemed country bumkin, Gary Cooper evolves into a skilled infighter in the famous final court room scene. In fact Gary Cooper simply does a better job of acting than Stewart does in Mr. Smith.
Then there are the villains. Who can fault the always excellent Claude Rains in Mr. Smith, but his character is one dimensional. Fortunately Edward Arnold redeems the evil quotient with his Big Jim Taylor role in Mr. Smith.  But in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, we have the wonderful Douglass Dumbrille who, along with Edward Arnold, defined the role of the big shot plutocrat in films of the 30's. This is Dumbrille's best movie. Even Jean Arthur, type cast in Kapra films as the cynical, hard boiled insider always warning the innocents of the evils of the big city ,comes across better in this film as Babe than in Mr. Smith.  Finally, I think the superiority of Mr. Deeds is that it more closely connects the audience to the horrors of the Depression than the Jimmy Stewart film does.",1261353600,,1169,4.660194174757281

3615618,5,B001GLX6US,"I love Frank Capra's 1930s films. They are on the one hand so clearly products of their time, which was the period of the New Deal and a sense of optimism and idealism about whether America could overcome its problems and bring about a better life for most Americans. And, it was the period of time immediately preceding WW II, which transformed America in general so profoundly, and no one less than Frank Capra. By his own admission, the war brought about a shift in Capra's social and political vision, from a Leftist position to a Rightist one. After the war, Capra was able to duplicate his pre-War success only once, with IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. Later in life, in his autobiography and after moving back to a leftist political position, Capra acknowledged that his shift to the Right marred his cinematic vision, and ruined him as a filmmaker.
On one level, MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN is easy to criticize. It does espouse simplistic, naive beliefs about society and politics. It is anti-capitalist, whereas Capra's post-WW II films (excepting IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE) were pro-business. The film does seem to suggest that there are simple answers to enormously complex problems. All this, however, enchants me. I wish that we today had not lost this capacity to have simple, goodhearted beliefs.

Once one moves away from the social and political elements in this film, which are nonetheless quite strong (and the sentiments expressed here helped give rise to what is frequently referred to as ""Capra-corn""), one is left with a delightful, funny, and inspiring romantic comedy. Could any actor in the history of film have been more perfect as Longfellow Deeds? Well, perhaps Jimmy Stewart or Henry Fonda (certainly not Adam Sandler). But even those two stellar actors would have fallen short of Cooper in communicating his abject indifference to his fate during his trial late in the film. Having him in that role was a perfect bit of casting. Jean Arthur, one of Capra's two favorite actresses, was perfect as Babe Bennett (though his other favorite actress, Barbara Stanwyck, might have been even more perfect). The two make a perfect team: the idealistic, naive, and good hearted Deeds (though completely intolerant of bunk) and the cynical, cold hearted, manipulative undercover reporter whose heart is melted and transformed by Deeds. In a supporting role, Lionel Stander is outstanding.

All in all, this is just a great film, and stands as one of Capra's finest efforts, definitely one of the five or six classic films he made upon which his reputation will always be preserved.

There is an absolutely excreble version of the film, with Adam Sandler playing Deeds. The film is beyond than embarrassing. There are two reasons to engage in a remake. First, an earlier film contains excellent premises, but executed its own concepts poorly. Thus, a remake provides an opportunity to get it right. The 1941 version of THE MALTESE FALCON was actually a remake of an earlier version of the novel. The second reason to undertake a remake is when the filmmakers have no interesting or inventive ideas of their own, and pilfer those of others to rake in some box office. Since the original MR. DEEDS would be extremely difficult to improve upon, one wonders if this film is an example of reason number two. I should add that there is a third reason to engage in a remake: love of a previous film and to try and pay homage by remaking it. I believe that this is the case with the unsuccessful remake by Mel Brooks of TO BE OR NOT TO BE (why try to remake a perfect film?), the more successful CAPE FEAR (which was nearly as good as the original), or the high tech remake of PLANET OF THE APES.

Bit of trivia: This was the only film that Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur made together. In 1942 Hitchcock wanted to reunite the two of them in SABOTEUR. He was unsuccessful; however, and instead cast Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane in the leads. The film today, despite some amazing scenes, is usually criticized for its very weak stars. One wonders how successful that film would have been if Hitchcock had managed to get the Gary and Jean.

Second bit of trivia: Jean Arthur, although she always looks very calm and self-possessed, suffered from almost debilitating screen fright, frequently becoming nauseous before or during shooting. In fact, her career eventually ended when she was doing a stage version of BORN YESTERDAY, playing the Judy Holliday role. During the middle of the play, the stress became too much for her. She was unable to return to finish the play, and except for a unsuccessful attempt at a TV sitcom, her career was over.",1244246400,,4642,4.804755944931164

In the 1930's and 40's, Frank Capra's oeuvre was the humanistic picture, inspirational to the common folk reeling from the Great Depression and later World War II. Written by his frequent (and later quite embittered) collaborator, Robert Riskin, this was his first film fully in this direction after his Oscar-winning success with the quintessential runaway heiress comedy, 1934's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-Happened-One-Night/dp/B000022TSL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It Happened One Night</a>.

Cooper portrays Longfellow Deeds, a young poet and volunteer fireman in a small Vermont town who suddenly inherits $20 million, a huge fortune at the time, from a distant uncle who died in an automobile crash in Italy. Having never been outside of his hometown, Deeds is thrust into the limelight and moves to Manhattan to take care of his uncle's estate and related business interests.

3615621,5,B001GLX6US,"Frank Capra had a knack of creating people that resonated with the audience. Here it was Mr. Deeds, a kind small town man whose main concern was his small business and his tuba playing.  When he inherits 20 million dollard from an uncle, his life is turned around with being forced to deal with rich lawyers, gold-digging women, and arrogant poets.  The only positive he sees out of the rich life is a woman whose name he thinkgs is Mary, but is actually a journalist whose aspiration is to get front page stories to make him look like a fool.

I was cheering Deeds the entire way.  I loved how he was not too timid to punch people who deserved it, rip on the arts crowd when they expect him to choke up money for a mismanaged Opera house, and employ common sense deduction to know when someone was being sincere and when they were trying to take him for a ride.

The climax, where Deeds gives his money to buy a large chunk of farmland, who he gives to the unemployed to till, was incredible in its message.  In the courtroom when the lawyers were arguing that Deeds' charity would only tilt the economic balance, what was really being said it was the government's job to help people, not other citizen's.  In the depression era whewn the film was made, where FDR's New Deal was continuing to fail, the movie could almost be seen as a call to arms to help your fellow man make a living for himself, as opposed to waiting for a handout.

Grat acting, Great message, Great movie.",1229731200,,1478,4.388278388278389
3615622,5,B001GLX6US,"It was in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town that Frank Capra perfected the blend of comedy and social commentary that would become his trademark. The screwball comedy was graceful rather than frantic and the social elements of Robert Riskin's fine screenplay are handled in an even-handed manner that earned Capra the second of his three Acadamy Awards for Best Director. Both Gary Cooper as the tuba playing no nonsense Longfellow Deeds and Jean Arthur as the reporter who exploits him until she falls for his goodness are wonderful in this true Capra classic.

Longfellow Deeds (Cooper) lives in the small town of Mandrake Falls where he makes a living writing greeting card poems and spends his free time playing the tuba. He is less than enthused when a bunch of big city attorneys show up at his door to tell him he has just inherited 20 million dollars from a relative he never met. The law firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington just want him to sign over his power of attorney and Deeds goes to the city with them mainly so he can get a look at Grant's Tomb.

Deeds is honest and good but no pushover and his initial reluctance about the situation proves wise as everyone wants to mooch off of Deeds and make a fool of him at the same time. Deeds gives as good as he gets and wins over the crusty Cornelius Cobb (Lionell Stander) to his way of doing things but can't get around the way a certain Louise Bennet is mocking his every escapade in the papers, making him look a fool and a country bumpkin.

But Deeds knows it doesn't matter when he meets the sweet Mary Dawson (Jean Arthur), a lady in distress who becomes his constant companion. Deeds no longer has to go off by himself like he did back home and talk to an imaginary girl because his dream girl has finally appeared for real. He tells Mary that she makes up for all the fakes he's met and writes a poem to her telling her how much he loves her. The problem, of course, is that Mary Dawson and this Louise Bennet who has christened him the Cinderella Man in all the papers are one and the same.

Arthur is wonderful as the cynical reporter who slowly realizes that Longfellow is good, straightforward and honest. She realizes it is the viewpoint of everyone else that is distorted. Before she can get to him to make her confession, however, Cobb breaks the bad news to Deeds and his faith in everything is lost. He is ready to pack it up and head back to Mandrake Falls until a starving farmer breaks into his home and gives Deeds an idea. It is the depression and Deeds' plan to give those down and out a chance to fend for themselves and get back on their feet will take evey penny he has, which is just what he wants.

But the same attorneys who courted him before, now try to prevent the noble Deeds from doing a noble deed and attempt to have him declared insane. It is the last straw for Longfellow, who shuts down completely, refusing to even defend his actions at his hearing. It is only when in an outburst from Arthur he learns she really does love him that he comes alive and gives them what for. As Cobb says earlier in the film, ""lamb bites wolf!""

This is another great Capra film that shows it is the ""average"" fellow who really represents our values and mores as a people and a country, while entertaining us like no other director could. In addition to the constant joke about the name Budington throughout the film, because Deeds can't find a rhyme for it, it is also an ""in"" joke; the original story adapted by Riskin was written by Clarance Budington Kelland!

Cooper and Arthur are memorable together and you will definitely get choked up when she reads Longfellow's poem about her on the steps of her apartment. Arthur does, because the words he has said earlier to a group of published poets making fun of him echo in her heart: ""I guess it's alright to hurt someone as long as you don't care how much you hurt them.""

Sony is putting out this newly remastered edition which has audio commentary, a featurette, the trailer, and vintage ads. The cover art looks the same but is in color this time, making an attractive display for film buffs. I still have an older TV and really saw nothing wrong with the previous editions of this wonderful classic, not being that picky, so will leave this area to those more qualified in regards to the technical aspects.

If all the great Capra classics were represented by a vase full of red roses, this would be the one white rose in the center. It is flawless and pure, and represents everything that was special about the films of the first director allowed to have his name above the title. After seeing this film, you'll know why.",1228694400,,4657,4.4374269005847955

And as usual, the original was head-and-shoulders above the remake, and made the remake seem pretty pointless.

The plot is the same--Longfellow Deeds (Gary Cooper) unexpectedly inherits a fortune from an uncle he'd never met, then goes to the city to take care of the legalities.

Babe Bennett (Jean Arthur) is a tough newspaper reporter who poses as sweet, innocent Mary Dawson to get the scoop on him.

But instead of a crooked board of directors, there's a greedy cousin, and there are no over-the-top silly jokes. It's still funny, but it doesn't resort to idiocy to accomplish that. Really made me wonder why lately Hollywood seems to think that only slapstick is funny.

It did take me a while to warm up to Gary Cooper in the role. I'd only ever seen him in macho roles, so this mild-mannered character seemed rather odd to me--I'd expected something more like Jimmy Stewart from It's a Wonderful Life. Not that he didn't play the role convincingly--it was just my expectations that were off.",1227571200,,1191,5.352941176470588
3615624,4,B001GLX6US,"There is a tendency amongst some to think that all the art produced by a great artist is great. This is false, but it gives cover for bad critics who just recycle old blurbs and tendencies about the artist. Think of the unthinking and fawning that goes on in discussions of Shakespeare. Yes, he was a great writer, but all but a dozen or so of his sonnets were mediocre tongue-twisters, and two thirds of his thirty-seven known plays were mediocre to terrible, so by being uncritical one actually diminishes the great art produced, for an uncritical stance makes it seem as if the touching of greatness is a product alien to all but the blessed. In short, it negates the hard work that all great endeavors require.
  This thought was ubiquitous as I watched the 1936 black and white Frank Capra classic film Mr. Deeds Goes To Washington. The film was adapted from a story, Opera Hat, by Clarence Budington Kelland, by longtime Capra collaborator, and dialogue expert, Robert Riskin. It's a good film, to be sure, as all Capra fare is, but it's not in a league with It's A Wonderful Life, nor even his earlier Oscar-winning classic, It Happened One Night. It lacks the overall depth of the former- and is far more preachy, and, in comparison to the latter, it lacks the quick pacing and tart-tongued dialogue, as it clocks in at 115 minutes in length.
  This film was, in many ways, a precursor to the later Capra-Cooper film, Meet John Doe, as both films feature rags to riches tales in which men are manipulated by the women they love. This film, however, is not as bleak as the later film. Yet, despite the use of many familiar tropes, what sets Capra apart from lesser directors are his believable lesser characters- all of whom get moments to shine, as well as the peerless dialogue. Add to that Capra's relentless glare at his leading actors' characterizations, and his films- which with lesser directors would have truly been the cornfests his worst critics claim, are ones always presented with a grittiness that could be from later films noir, in the midst of the feelgoodery.... All in all, Mr. Deeds Goes To Town is Capra in fine form, if not at the top of his game. Yet, if it's true that not all the art produced by a great artist is great, the opposite sentiment has merit: even the lesser art from great artists is better than that produced by lesser artists. This film is proof of that claim.",1221350400,,2407,4.590697674418605

In the 1930's and 40's, Frank Capra's oeuvre was the humanistic picture, inspirational to the common folk reeling from the Great Depression and later World War II.

Having never been outside of his hometown, Deeds is thrust into the limelight and moves to Manhattan to take care of his uncle's estate and related business interests. The first half has all the trappings of a ""fish out of water"" situation (which Capra pretty much perfected with this film), but it doesn't take Deeds long to figure out that the people around him are not as sincere as they want him to think.

But beneath the anecdote of this urban fable, there's more; at first place a tongue in the cheek before the hard times of the Great depression of 1929, on the other hand Capra allows himself certain liberties to carve in relief in terms of comedy what years later would come : ""The grapes of wrath"" ; and finally as you and me might expect he shakes hands with the world, when an inquisitive reporter, trying to understand the motives of his outrageous behaviour, eventually falls in love with him.

We should remark the impressive performance of Gary Cooper, starring this one-of- a-kind personage, his sublime clumsiness, lost glance and childish behaviour around an unique character by then. The sequence in the court room, after he decides to react against the multiple attacks remains as a classic and a formidable magisterial class of realistic acting.

It's great to see a firm of ethically-challenged lawyers and ridiculous psychiatrists get their commuppance.

Gary Cooper is sublime in this role.  I've read every reader's review here and no one has mentioned how gorgeous he is!  So I will:  He is GORGEOUS! He personifies the good guy from the small Vermont town, who's not as much of a bumpkin as folks would like to think.  True, he is a bit pixillated and that's definitely to his favor.  Pixies fled New York City a long time ago and look at the mess it's in!

The whole film is entertaining but there are a few scenes that stood out in my mind:  first, when Deeds plays his bass tuba part as the town band plays farewell to him as he boards the train.  Then, when he ""conducts"" the three stuffy servants in an impromptu echo trio in marble hallway of his mansion.  Then, another musical one, when he and ""Mary"" form a duet on a park bench in the city, with Mary playing ""Swanee River"" on ""drums"" and Deeds oom-pah-ing ""Humouresque."" Very sweet!

TODAY

Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur are incredibly effective and believable as quite an odd couple in this serio-comic treatment of idealism versus cynicism in the form of the small town iconoclast versus the big city. Together, the pair are the embodiment of the Capra depiction of the grand virtues of the simple country folk pitted against the unnatural and decadent evils of the modern city.

However, in this story, like most of Capra's there is a way out for all of us in this film, and a way for us individually to empathize with the characters and the plight of society as a whole as it staggered through the 'Great Depression'.

MR. DEEDS & THE GREAT DEPRESSION:

Just when one might be thinking okay, I have been watching this film for an hour and I know how it is going to turn out, Mr. Deeds takes a hard turn to the LEFT! In this seemingly extraneous subplot, lies the true meaning of this film, as we discover that Mr. Deeds is much more than just another 'boy meets girl' film with a few bumps thrown in on the way to the altar. That's because Deeds is a better man than that and can't be so easily defeated. Of course, this is a parody of 1936 society which had been in a real depression for 7 years already.

Yes, Mr. Deeds does draw a great deal of empathy from modern viewers as he plays the knight in shining armor from a by-gone era, looking for his damsel in distress in New York City. Rather than just brooding over it, Longfellow Deeds does something drastic about, drastic enough for his sanity to come into question. In this questioning of Deeds' sanity, Babe Bennett [Jean Arthur] is given the opportunity, which see puts to good use, to earn back Longfellow Deeds' trust and so illustrate that perhaps none of us is beyond redemption. Now isn't that a promising idea?

When he arrives in New York, he begins to reform though the people there expect him to follow their orders blindly. He falls in love with a reporter disguised as a damsel in distress (Jean Arthur) who uses him for a story. Deeds does many great things, but the people who want to use him deem him crazy in order to usurp his power.

Cooper is wonderful in these wide-eyed innocent types of roles. He is tall and wears his strength well, which makes his sweetness all the more appealing. It is hard not to fall in love with his character and to wish that there really were people like him in the world.

This film was re-made starring Adam Sandler and called Mr. Deeds. That version is actually very good and puts some modern comedy into an already great story. It also stays true to this film featuring much of the same plot and names.

When he decides to give all the money away to out-of-work farmers (it's Depression time, remember), he is declared insane by lawyers who want some of the pie for themselves, citing his tuba playing, walking in the rain, chasing fire engines, etc. as examples.

Jean Arthur is the newspaper woman who uses him at first to make a bigger sap out of him to sell papers, but soon she finds herself in love with him and decides to help him out. The movie ends with a famous courtroom scene where Cooper refuses to defend himself until it's almost too late - but of course Arthur comes to his rescue and Coop turns the tables.

Like most Capra pictures it goes on too long, and in this one we really feel it. The Capra ""corn"" is piled on thick, with such scenes as the one at Grant's Tomb almost obligatory in a Capra picture. Cooper and Arthur perform wonderfully, though, and the supporting cast is at its best, too.

Strange note (to me, anyway): Where here Deeds says nothing in his defense at the end, Jimmy Stewart in the similarly sounding MR.

3615638,4,B001GLX6US,"MY RATING- 7.8
This is quite a moving tale a la american by the master of socio drama, Frank Capra in which he uses one of his fave actors Gary Cooper as the country man who inherits a fortune from a rich uncle and is double crossed in the city. I never enjoyed the first roles of Cooper in MOROCCO, yet it looks like he's been improving his acting over the years and his eyes seem to be brighter and emotional with Capra efforts. Jean Arthur is very good too with her sexy voice and tender love. The cast also includes H. B. Warner as the judge and Lionel Stander as Deeds gardian angel with that frog voice.
Maybe a bit overlong, however it's moving (not as much as It's a Wonderful Life""), , love triumphs at the end, with the Capraesque final act at the court.",1038700800,,764,4.204081632653061
3615639,5,B001GLX6US,"This is a terrific movie about a man who is literally plucked from his quiet small town life and brought to New York to deal with newly inherited millions. The Gary Cooper character is brave, strong, insightful, and most of all kind EXCEPT when it comes to the legions of snobs, phonies, and crooks he encounters in New York. The first time I saw this movie I couldn't believe how often he just slugged people who insulted or patronized him. The 1930s audiences, though, must have loved seeing the rich stuffed shirts getting theirs in such a direct way. You can quibble about some aspects of the plot line (I too couldn't believe he wouldn't see through Jean Arthur's trickery), but it doesn't take anything away from a great movie watching experience. You just can't help but like these characters and the triumphant ending is perfect. See this movie!",1031270400,,853,4.731543624161074
3615640,5,B001GLX6US,"This movie is the story of a simple small town man who suddenly ends  up with $20 mil from a dead uncle.  It turns out however that reguardless of what everybody in NY thinks just because he isn't from the city doesn't mean he is stupid.
Gary Cooper pulls off this movie with his stoic charm.  His supporting cast is admirable with the best being Lionel Stander as the street savvy Cornelius Cobb who watchs over him.  Jean Arthur plays basically the same role as Mr. Smith goes to washington and is just as good.  The whole supporting cast is good and the old ladies at the end are a riot.
The plot line revolves about many different people trying to use him for a sap, and Deeds refusing to fall for it using simple common sense.  Time and again he says what most people know but are unwilling to admit in order to seem ""open minded"".  (I'm reminded of a quote who's author I can't recall saying some people are so open minded that they won't take their own side in an arguement""
This movie is very topical for today although I think he would be arrested or comitted or considered judgemental, but rather than getting into the cultural aspects, let me just say that Capra as he always did made movies about the human condition that will never be irrelevent.

3615641,4,B001GLX6US,"This original film opened in 1936, starring Gary Cooper a country bumpkin from an obscure new England town, who has just found out he is the beneficiary of a fortune, left to him by a long lost relative. He is about to let loose his wild and untapped spirit in New York where his very sanity will be an issue. Love is waiting for our hero in the jungles of the city, all his life he has been waiting to find a woman in need. Though the girl of his dreams has an agenda that is not quite benevolent, she is about to learn an important lesson in love and life. A fun flick for all of the family.
The movie ""Mr. Deeds"", starring Adam Sandler, is a remake of this original film. Set in the present day with several aspects changed to fit the times.  Kelsana 7/30/02",1027987200,,761,4.141891891891892
3615642,5,B001GLX6US,"When I heard that a remake was being made of this movie, I was totally outraged. Remakes are made for three reasons, in my opinion: a director sees a good concept that is carried out badly and wants to improve it, a director wants to honor a movie he likes, or HOLLYWOOD HAS NO NEW IDEAS SO DECIDES TO REMAKE A CLASSIC! Okay, this is somewhat off topic, but the point is that in the case of Mr. Deeds it has to be the third option because there is NO WAY the original can be improved upon.
This is how highly I rate this movie (also, if an improvement were to be made, it would not be made by casting Adam Sandler, of all people, as Mr. Deeds - the part is NOT AT ALL right for him).
Anyhow, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town is essentially the story of a small town boy (Gary Cooper) who inherits a fortune and then decides to give it away to the poor. He is charged with being insane as a result and is forced to prove his sanity in court (which he does in a priceless scene). Also, he meets a seemingly innocent girl (Jean Arthur) who is actually a reporter trying to get a story on him, which complicates matters to some extent.
This is one of Capra's masterpieces. It is a sweet and intelligent movie - one the whole family can watch and enjoy. So, instead of going to the theater to see the terrible remake, buy this classic today on DVD (or VHS)!",1026432000,,1342,4.106463878326996
3615643,5,B001GLX6US,"Even after retiring from showbiz, Frank Capra remained a very popular director until his death in 1991. His films allowed the audience to symphatize with the characters because they had a common theme of ordinary, likable (And often, small town) people being placed in extraordinary situations. Also, the main characters don't think much of what has happened to them, at least at the moment. For example, after being told he has inherited $20 million, Longfellow Deeds in Capra's 1936 comedy ""Mr. Deed's Goes to Town"" remarks ""What do I need that for"". And he goes back to playing his tuba. Another example is on the train ride to his new estate in New York: When asked what he's thinking about, it isn't the responsibility or wealth on his mind, but rather ""Who's going to be the new tuba player in the band back home"".
Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur are both superb as the two leads. In his career-making role as Longfellow Deeds, Cooper plays it well as a dimwitted yet charming small town man who inherits his uncle's wealth following his death (Or suicide? You decide. Hey, that rhymes!) Arthur plays newspaper writer Louise ""Babe"" Bennett, who goes undercover to write articles on Deeds. She is originally hired to basically uncover dirt on Longfellow, which she does. But she finds herself falling in love with him and soon feels ashamed with degrading him. Her shame comes too late, though, for due in large part to her writing, Deeds is charged with insanity and put on trial (That and he puts up his whole fortune to help out poor farmers). Now, he has to defend against an overwhelming amount of evidence. However, as learned during the trial, Deeds wasn't insane. He just did peculiar things like all humans.
There are several very funny scenes in the movie. One example is when Deeds, after chasing Walter the butler out of his room, yells at Walter to discover that the sound makes an echo. Soon, he and the other servants are making loud sounds and hearing them echo. Another funny scene is when Deeds, for the first time in his life, gets drunk and, according to Walter, fed donuts to a horse and took off his clothes yelling ""Back to nature"". But we never see the actual scene. That's something about this movie that current directors should pick up on: Some situations can be better, or in this case funnier, if left to our imagination. Its probably because of hindsight: When we look back at embarrassing situations we were in, we think differently of them then when they happened.
About the only compliant I had with ""Mr. Deeds"" was in the way this film portrays the rich class. It's said that a movie can be shown as the way a director views the world. Capra must have had some bad experiences with wealthier people. In here, basically all
the richest men in New York, lead by the only other living relative of Deeds, want part of Longfellow's money, though they are wealthy enough. This plot is similar to Capra's later ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"", where a naive senator has to fight crooked politicians who want the land he has set aside for a boyscout's camp. And it's similar in ways to ""It's a Wonderful Life"", where the manager of a Savings and Loans building has to prevent a wealthy businessman from taking it over. I can't speak for all the rich men of the world, but I assume there must be a few good ones who aren't greedy and, if they are unselfish, they don't come from a small town. I also think that it took Deeds a little long to find out who Babe Bennett really was; A news story about him appears every morning following a date with her, yet he can't put the two together.
But that doesn't mean I don't like the movie. Being the critic that I am, I need to be fair and balanced. I think the movie is even better for tackling such lighthearted, simple and universal beliefs liked kindness and acceptance. I haven't seen the remake with Adam Sandler. I have nothing wrong with Sandler: Though he regularly plays the same guy in his movies, some of them have been funny. But from what I see on T.V ads, this remake seems to agree with today's belief that money makes you a great and happy person. As we learn here, that isn't always so. Deeds was a great man before he got all that money because he had character, integrity, honesty and dignity (Until ""Donut Gate"", that is). But tell me, how happier was he with all those millions? Instead, his longing for his home and friends in Mandrake Falls grows. There, he really was wealthy.",1026345600,,4469,4.566625155666252
3615644,5,B001GLX6US,"I love Frank Capra's 1930s films.  They are on the one hand so clearly products of their time, which was the period of the New Deal and a sense of optimism and idealism about whether America could overcome its problems and bring about a better life for most Americans.  And, it was the period of time immediately preceding WW II, which transformed America in general so profoundly, and no one less than Frank Capra.  By his own admission, the war brought about a shift in Capra's social and political vision, from a Leftist position to a Rightist one.  After the war, Capra was able to duplicate his pre-War success only once, with IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  Later in life, in his autobiography and after moving back to a leftist political position, Capra acknowledged that his shift to the Right marred his cinematic vision, and ruined him as a filmmaker.
On one level, MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN is easy to criticize.  It does espouse simplistic, naive beliefs about society and politics.  It is anti-capitalist, whereas Capra's post-WW II films (excepting IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE) were pro-business.  The film does seem to suggest that there are simple answers to enormously complex problems.  All this, however, enchants me.  I wish that we today had not lost this capacity to have simple, goodhearted beliefs.
Once one moves away from the social and political elements in this film, which are nonetheless quite strong (and the sentiments expressed here helped give rise to what is frequently referred to as ""Capra-corn""), one is left with a delightful, funny, and inspiring romantic comedy.  Could any actor in the history of film have been more perfect as Longfellow Deeds?  Well, perhaps Jimmy Stewart or Henry Fonda (certainly not Adam Sandler).  But even those two stellar actors would have fallen short of Cooper in communicating his abject indifference to his fate during his trial late in the film.  Having him in that role was a perfect bit of casting.  Jean Arthur, one of Capra's two favorite actresses, was perfect as Babe Bennett (though his other favorite actress, Barbara Stanwyck, might have been even more perfect).  The two make a perfect team:  the idealistic, naive, and good hearted Deeds (though completely intolerant of bunk) and the cynical, cold hearted, manipulative undercover reporter whose heart is melted and transformed by Deeds.  In a supporting role, Lionel Stander is outstanding.
All in all, this is just a great film, and stands as one of Capra's finest efforts, definitely one of the five or six classic films he made upon which his reputation will always be preserved.
There is a forthcoming remake of this film, with Adam Sandler playing Deeds.  The previews that I have seen are more than embarrassing.  There are two reasons to engage in a remake.  First, an earlier film contains excellent premises, but executed its own concepts poorly.  Thus, a remake provides an opportunity to get it right.  The 1941 version of THE MALTESE FALCON was actually a remake of an earlier version of the novel.  The second reason to undertake a remake is when the filmmakers have no interesting or inventive ideas of their own, and pilfer those of others.  Since the original MR. DEEDS would be extremely difficult to improve upon, one wonders if this film is an example of reason number two.  I should add that there is a third reason to engage in a remake:  love of a previous film and to try and pay homage by remaking it.  I believe that this is the case with the unsuccessful remake by Mel Brooks of TO BE OR NOT TO BE (why try to remake a perfect film?), the more successful CAPE FEAR (which was nearly as good as the original), or the high tech remake of PLANET OF THE APES.
Bit of trivia:  This was the only film that Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur made together.  In 1942 Hitchcock wanted to reunite the two of them in SABOTEUR.  He was unsuccessful; however, and instead cast Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane in the leads.  The film today, despite some amazing scenes, is usually criticized for its very weak stars.  One wonders how successful that film would have been if Hitchcock had managed to get the Gary and Jean.
Second bit of trivia:  Jean Arthur, although she always looks very calm and self-possessed, suffered from almost debilitating screen fright, frequently becoming nauseous before or during shooting.  In fact, her career eventually ended when she was doing a stage version of BORN YESTERDAY, playing the Judy Holliday role.  During the middle of the play, the stress became too much for her.  She was unable to return to finish the play, and except for a unsuccessful attempt at a TV sitcom, her career was over.",1023753600,,4658,4.806532663316583

3615647,1,B001GLX6US,"It is quite amazing how this film manages to sneak its perverse political ideas under a coat of ""common sense"" idealism: ""why don't people just like each other every once in a while."" Frightening to witness the charming Longfellow Deeds explain how some people just can't make it, and how he, in a textbook impersonation of Jesus Christ, will save them. Forget that the film ignores problems and questions by either simplifying them to the level of a 10 year old, or mocking them. The simple people that it pretends to defend are silenced and reduced to a supporting mindless crowd (the manipulation of crowds and typage are worthy of Eisenstein) for a hero that borders on proto-fascism (the constant endorsement of physical violence is sickening). Doesn't it bother anyone that the female heroine goes from a strong and smart reporter to a brainless hysterical child whose only purpose in life is marriage?
Unfortunately, the ideas Capra (and Riskin) push are highly problematic. Take your ""common sense"" goggles off--the problem with common sense is that there is no such thing: some people think it common sense that women should stay at home, others that whites are better than blacks. Common sense is what people use to justify their view of the world.

Capra  focused on values rather than politics as a leif motiv and never  surrendered. His obsession for Americana and the way its ideals should move  us is a constant in his work.  Also very important was casting. The  stereotypes that everybody are playing here make believable, or lovable,  roles and that adds significantly to the movie.

8306003,5,B001GLX6US,"Ive long been a fan of director Frank Capra. I can still remember seeing MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON years ago and being moved by it on some VHS station in the 60s. In college I was fortunate enough to be present when Capra made a visit to Ball State to speak and was even lucky enough to pose a question to him. Afterward he sat with the audience to view what he said was his and his close friend Jimmy Stewarts favorite movie ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE. It was my first time viewing it and its been a favorite ever since.

Since then Ive been blessed with the chance to see the rest of his films. The invention of video tape and then DVD has given film fans the opportunity to enjoy the films they used to have to wait to see on late night fuzzy channels on TV. Not only that, most are being brought out with extras to enjoy as well as in the clearest presentations ever. Such is the case with this film.

For those who haven't seen the film it tells the story of Longfellow Deeds (Gary Cooper), part owner of a tallow works, greeting card poet and tuba player in a small town, who suddenly inherits $20 million from his late uncle. While this in itself doesnt change Deeds it has a great effect on all who worked for his uncle and want to retain as much of that wealth for themselves as possible.

Deeds is convinced to move to the big city and to take over things. But this is a Capra film and when they say take over it means be a figurehead while the conniving bankers and traders retain as much control of the wealth as possible. Not only that but every group looking for a handout appears at his doorstep, too many for him to see through it all and realize which is legitimate and which is just someone looking to dip into his pocket.

While the biggest of these financial crooks, a lawyer who worked for his uncle, tries to keep as many away from Deeds as possible, reporter Louise Babe Bennet (Jean Arthur) makes her way into the fold playing the damsel in distress in need of assistance from Deeds. Of course while he sees through a number of the phonies around him Deeds falls for Louise. During the course of the movie she falls for him as well.

Confronted by a poor man who views him simply as another rich taker, Deeds realizes he can do something of value with his wealth and tries to establish a system to help the poor. He will offer 10 acre lands to anyone free if they are willing to work the land for 3 years. This sets him in the crosshairs of the corrupt powers that be and soon he has a fight on his hands.

As with a number of Capra films we once again have the little guy going up against the corporate big wigs whose sole concern is making and taking money. Made during the Great Depression the film resonated with so many who lost everything at the time. It solidified the status of Cooper as a leading man and Arthur, who starred in several Capra classics, shows why he often chose her.

The movie is filled with humor both in the writing and in the performances. Not all the laughs come from the dialogue and many are situational. Its hard to find something this good these days but it happens now and then. Capra always seemed to know just which buttons to push in his films. It wasn't that he held all corporate big wigs and bankers to a higher standard but he recognized and highlighted those that were corrupt and self-serving. In the end by sticking up for the little guy he made a career for himself and a reputation that has remained as one of the most gifted directors of all time.

This new release is a treat for fans and non-fans alike. To begin with Sony has restored the film to the best condition ever found for the film. Scratched prints had been released in the past but this edition features the film in pristine fashion with a frame by frame restoration in 4K from the original camera negative making it the cleanest and clearest version of the film to date. Extras include a feature and commentary by Frank Capra Jr. (a successful producer in his own right) and the original theatrical trailer. This release is also offered in a Digi book format which offers and essay on the film along with plenty of black and white photos from the film.

If you're a Capra fan then this is the edition of the film youll want to add to your collection. If youve never seen the film then this is one to pick up to discover just how great Capra films were. Once you finish my guess is youll seek out the others he made and enjoy them just as much as this one.",1508716800,,4487,4.2632197414806114
