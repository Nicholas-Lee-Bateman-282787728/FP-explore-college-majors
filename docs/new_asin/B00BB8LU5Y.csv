I know I won't have a problem because the same thing happened with Stargate SG-1 and I had to return it because of damages on a few disks but you made it real easy which I appreciate, Thanks again.",1363564800,,381,4.026315789473684
5569204,5,B00BB8LU5Y,I loved watching Night Court when it was on tv. Was sad that this was the last season. I reccomend the series to anyone who likes a funny show.,1363564800,,143,3.9655172413793105
5569205,5,B00BB8LU5Y,Great show. These are the shows that are simply funny and respectful fun. TV at it's best. Compared to the crap that get put on dvd immediately.,1363305600,,144,4.37037037037037
5569206,5,B00BB8LU5Y,"I just have to say that Night Court Season 8 is Great,and cant wait for Season 9,I love them all no matter what the critics say And thats a wrap!",1362182400,2,145,3.8666666666666667
5569207,3,B00BB8LU5Y,"I'm a little torn on the ""manufacturing on demand"" model.  I'll say upfront, that I like it, and hope to see season 9 soon.  But it has its drawbacks.

With this season, you get each episode, unmodified in any way (good or bad).  That is all.  No deleted scenes, no gag reel, no previews, no bonus content of ANY kind... not even subtitles.  Nothing is remastered, polished, enhanced, or corrected in any way.

Keep the above in mind when it comes to the price.  Typically, when I buy the DVD for something its to experience MORE of the product.  I've seen Night Court on TV, I want the DVDs for all the extra goodies that tend to come with them.  In this regard, there are no extras.

On the other hand, Night Court does not air on any network I have access to and its been years since I have seen an episode.  So this model is providing the one thing that no one else is... Night Court.  Not more, but Night Court all the same.  After all these years, I still chuckle at the sitcom.  Some jokes are a little corny, but overall the series has aged very well.

The quality of the episodes are a little rough.  Visually These need some work, but are tolerable for just wanting to watch the show.  Again, just don't expect anything in terms of extra or quality that didn't air as the actual show.

For a no-frills version made on demand, the price seems very high.  I expected something one third to one fourth of the asking price.  If all you want is Night Court, this service can provide just that.  I highly recommend the show, but caution you to hold your expectations very low for this specific product.",1361836800,20,1606,4.3367003367003365

5569217,4,B00BB8LU5Y,"Night Court's Eight Season is getting closer and closer to the end.  You can see it in the writing if not the acting.  Several ""turning point"" episodes are aired in which the characters speak of their past and that ""magic moment"" when things became clear to them.  Christine has a baby.  Phil the Wino (William Utay) gets rich.  Harry loves and loses.

I didn't put those into chronological order for a reason.  Some people complain about spoilers in a review.  It is what it is.  Season 8 slows down and it's pretty obvious the end is in sight.",1467849600,,545,4.479591836734694

5569256,5,B00BB8LU5Y,"How can you not love Night Court.  Crazy characters, impossible situations, funny dialogue.  I enjoy watching these as much now as I did 20 years ago.  I think it stands up to the test of time!",1401321600,,193,4.305555555555555
5569257,5,B00BB8LU5Y,"When he auditioned for the part, he came in telling the producers that the character was ""him"". It was his personality, his idiosyncracies. He was right, and they were right to cast him in the lead. Nobody else could have fit that part so perfectly. The rest of the cast was also outstanding. It was unfortunate that they kept changing the defense counsel, but John Larroquet  was brilliant, and went on to many outstanding productions, including Boston Legal. Saw John on stage on Broadway a couple of years ago - he was breathtaking. Night Court was a wonderfully entertaining sitcom with a great premise and phenomenal casting. For sheer good pleasure that whole family can truly watch and enjoy, I recommend this series,",1400889600,3,724,4.8861788617886175

5569260,4,B00BB8LU5Y,"Originally conceived as the final season, Night Courts 8th hit year saw the shows creators moving some very long simmering subplots off the back burner and on the boil.

As the season begins, Judge Harry (Harry Anderson), DA Dan (John Larroquette), bailiff Bull (Richard Moll), clerk Mac (Charles Robinson) and bailiff Roz (Marsha Warfield) are welcoming Christine (Markie Post) back from maternity leave.

The happy reunion is short-lived, however, as long-buried passions, secret guilts and long-lost relatives plunge the court into chaos. This being Night Court we are also treated to visits from a trick-or-treating Death (Stephen Root) and time travels with an angel (Mel Torme), and we brave a session at the horrific Day Court.

By seasons end, 2 characters may be unable to deny their love any longer in this 3-Disc, 24 Episode Collection.

This 1990-91 Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when I was 18 years old in my Senior year in high school and when NBC's motto was ""NBC Is The Place To Be"".",1393200000,,1025,4.873563218390805
5569261,5,B00BB8LU5Y,"I just finishing watching the entire eighth season and it was great.  Harry gets his heart broken, Bull finds his matchmaker girlfriend and we get to meet Bull's mother.  Unfortunately with Phil the bum's passing, Dan gets inherit and distribute the millions Phil had stashed away with the Phil Foundation for the needy of New York City which makes Dan Fielding the Dan were not used to seeing.  The comedy is just terrific and is better than some of the shows we see on television today.  This DVD set has three discs that you can't stop watching.  If your a fan of Night Court, you need this DVD set for your collection.  The sound and video is good too.",1391472000,2,656,4.470588235294118
5569262,2,B00BB8LU5Y,"I'm a Night Court Die hard, but I was worried about which season this show jumped the shark, and this was it. Harry Anderson started writing the show, Reinhold Weege stopped producing the show, and the baby was introduced (Joleen Lutz, as Lisette...ugh).
I thought the gags of the show is what made it great. The timing of the jokes, the dregs of NYC coming before the bench with the wackiest crimes, wordplay jokes, Dan Fielding acting as the consumate clown. The shows of 200 cases in one night, was laugh after laugh. Seems by season 8 the show was trying to grow up, be more dramatic, and much less funny. I guess after 7 seasons they were tired of the easy humor. Once they made the show all about a Character names Monty that was supposed to be like Andrew Dice Clay, where Harry teaches him a lesson, ugh.
Ill keep this to fall asleep to at night, but this season lost the essence of the series IMO. So if you're into the old gags of the show, don't go here.",1388361600,,965,4.3076923076923075

The price was higher than previous seasons, and a burn on a consumer-grade off-the-shelf disc* was a turnoff.  For the price commanded, a low-grade disc is a ripoff.

Especially as season 4's release had a mastering error with the audio losing sync in one episode, which is not attributable to the master videotapes shot circa 1985 or whenever...

Night Court broke the usual comic mold. Most comedies are centered around a normal central character witnessing the madness around him or her. With Night Court, everyone is nuts, including Harry Anderson, who plays a judge, a figure society assumes is as solid as a rock.

What made this show so darn funny was clever, well-written scripts, the right combination of identifiable personalities (I mean, who does not know a person like Dan Fielding or Christine Sullivan?), and the choice of actors perfectly suited to match their characters, giving performances of the roles of their careers.

There was also an incredible range in its humor. While most comedy series usually find one level of banality and stay there, the comedy in Night Court covered a greater spectrum. Thus, the humor was sometimes poignant, sometimes philosophical, sometimes slapstick, farcical, or even downright dumb, many times in the same episode. The humor, though, was never boring. The humor was intelligent, smart, ... and just darn funny.

The show never really jumped the shark, even when it easily could. In the eighth season a new character, a ditzy Court Reporter, was introduced. So now there are two comic relief characters in the Courtroom, the Court Reporter and one of the Bailiffs, Bull Shannon (Richard Moll.) While introducing a new character to an established routine is usually fatal to the over-all chemistry of the cast, this new character, through deft comic script-writing, fits right in, adding, not hindering, the comic effect.

Recurring actors include John Astin, of Addams Family fame, Yakov Smirnoff, and Mel Torme, who shows incredible acting flair as Harrys idol.
