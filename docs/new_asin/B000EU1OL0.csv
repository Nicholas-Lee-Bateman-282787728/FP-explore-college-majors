8114236,5,B000EU1OL0,"I'm biased but it really looks good. A very cute script with an excellent cast: Joan Collins, Spencer Breslin, Ralt Moeller, Rachel Hunter and a really good production. The special effects on the koala were done by the same folks who did the special effects on the pig in ""Babe"". Also, well directed.",1372118400,,300,4.679245283018868

8114239,5,B000EU1OL0,"I watched this movie with two of my grandchildren (boy, 6 & girl, 7), and it was about as much fun watching them as the movie.  This is a cute family movie that everyone can enjoy.  I wouldn't say there are any big issues that need to be discussed.  There is nothing questionable (unless you object to Ozzie punching a bad guy you-know-where) that traditional values families would object to.  This is a safe movie to let the  younger children watch by themselves.",1232841600,5,464,4.542168674698795
