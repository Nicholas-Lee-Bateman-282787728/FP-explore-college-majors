3146773,3,B0015QT76Q,"I guess since King of the Hill is being canceled we can expect Fox to release a massive set of the entire series for an ungodly amount of money.  Now that pretty much all the fans have bought 1-6 I think Fox will limit us as far as choices are concerned. I have that feeling they will attempt to strong arm the fans into buying them all again, as a set, to obtain the remaining seasons.  This is purely speculation though.  I wouldn't bet against Fox pulling some BS like it.  Hell, worst case scenario they will not release them at all.  Anyone know what the real deal is with the King of the Hill seasons 7-13?",1225497600,9,612,4.196581196581197

3146775,5,B0015QT76Q,"I'm glad Fox is finally releasing KOTH season 7 on DVD. It has some of the best episodes. My favorite was ""Mega Dale"" when Dale is hired to take care of the Mega-Lo Mart's rat problem. He then thinks there is a baboon in the store, and then... Chuck Mangione!

I don't understand why others are giving this item a low rating based on what Fox did. Amazon had nothing to do with the DVD's slow release.

3146776,1,B0015QT76Q,"I do not understand what the problem is. They have brought back The A-Team, Dallas, GunSmoke, and a bunch of other shows on DVD, but King of the Hill takes 2 years? Does Fox have to much money already? How can you delay something that is so popular? Waiting and hoping!!!",1208736000,11,271,4.333333333333333
3146777,5,B0015QT76Q,"Season 7 has some of the classic episodes - ""Mega-Lo Dale"", ""The Miseducation of Bobby Hill"", and ""Night and Deity"", to name a few - fans have been waiting for on DVD for 2 years. The episodes are witty and focus on a variety of Arlen characters. With 22 solid episodes, this season is a must have for all King of the Hill fans.

Some of the highlights include Bobby's foray into tarot card reading and spell casting in ""Witches of East Arlen."" One of my favorites from the entire seasons, the best part is Bobby's 30-ish friend Warren - he lives in his mom's basement, which he will continue doing for a few weeks after his mom's death, according to Hank.

Another spectacular episode is ""Night and Deity"", which many remember as the one Nancy got her comeuppance in for cheating on Dale. When a new, very attractive exterminator comes in to help with the neighborhood's pigeon problem, she and Dale begin to work very closely together, much to Nancy's horror. One of the awesome things about this episode is you never know what will happen - will he cheat on Nancy?

The most popular episode of the season is probably ""Mega-Lo Dale"" - Dale gets hired to get rid of Mega-Lo Mart's rat problem, but Hank has to step in when Dale becomes convinced the store has a baboon problem.

One thing Fox may want to think about before it delays another season or another show - these episodes are readily available on the internet, and while many super-fans such as myself want the collection on DVD, many others are just as satisfied with the downloads as with the DVD, particularly when forced to wait 2 years later than its scheduled release.",1208131200,61,1635,4.551020408163265
3146778,5,B0015QT76Q,I have been waiting for this for years.  Hope it is true. KOTH is one of the best TV shows ever.,1207785600,4,96,3.5714285714285716
3146779,5,B0015QT76Q,"I have King of the Hill seasons 1-6 on DVD and I watch the new season 12 episodes on FOX every Sunday, as well as the re-runs on FOX and FX. I have heard constant word about a 7th season release on DVD but it never has seemed to happen, so this time it better be real. I love this show more than any other FOX show. The characters and scenarios are very realistic, although animated and there seems to be more emotion and charcter developement in it than other shows that I watch. I LOVE KING OF THE HILL!",1207699200,6,505,4.06
3146780,1,B0015QT76Q,"Why has the release for Season 7 been delayed so long??? In the Season 6 DVD Set, they said Season 7 was scheduled for release in Fall of 2006!!! PLEASE release Season 7 NOW!!!...(& now we're overdue on Season 8 too!)...",1207180800,17,220,4.390243902439025
3146781,5,B0015QT76Q,"I can't understand why ONLY SIX seasons of King of the Hill have been released. Does somebody NOT want to make a lot of money? Surely there is a TON of money to be made off of the remaining seasons. So how far did the show get anyway, 12, 13 seasons? Really, releasing the other seasons should be a NO BRAINER. For one reason or another I find that I AM a Mike Judge Fan. I have the three collections of ""Beavis and Butthead"". I also have the MOVIE of B and B. And it's a shame to know that there was SO MUCH more Beavis and Butthead to be SEEN but it didn't get released because somebody realized some of the stuff was slightly controversial even EDGY. Wow, gotta keep the animation tame. So that is what we got with KOTH, TAME subject matter. Hank is surely a CONSERVATIVE. He is FAITHFUL to his wife and to his Dallas Cowboys, to Lady Propane, etc. So while I might have preferred more Beavis and Butthead Mike Judge moved on to a safer and more profitable family of animation. Some would think that Judge had been promoting beatings and ""Fire, Fire"", as Beavis said in some episodes.

I have all six seasons of KOFTH and I am READY to buy more. I have B and B, what has been released. I am also a HUGE fan of the movie Idiocracy. I also LOVE ""Office Space"". Mike Judge has an insane imagination. It's a shame that I have to try to INFLUENCE corporate suits to release MORE Mike Judge inspired work.

Just so you know I have a HUGE animation collection consisting of ALL of Southpark, all but the last two seasons of Family Guy, about 8 or more seasons of the Simpsons, Dilbert, Flintstones, Scooby Doo, Johnny Quest, Ren and Stimpy, The Oblongs, Pinky and the Brain and many more cartoon collections. So WHY would I not want to own more animation inspired by Mike Judge?

3146788,5,B0015QT76Q,what a bunch of nonsense does it really take this long to release a season on DVD the simpsons do 2 a year for crap sake. All the loyal king of the hill fans are growing inpatient and by the time Fox decides they want to release season 7 there gonna realize that this long wait has cost them some loyal fans. So Fox if your reading these stop being a bunch of giblet heads and just give us what we want.,1291593600,5,403,3.926829268292683
3146789,5,B0015QT76Q,"If you love King of the Hill and would like to see ALL the seasons, I have a solution for you.  If you are a member of Netflix and use the ""Watch it Now"" streaming option online... you can watch ALL the seasons.  With the onslaught of digital media it is cheaper for them to release them like this (I know it sucks).",1291075200,2,316,4.0
3146790,5,B0015QT76Q,"This just leaves me scratching my head. Okay, so the sales of 1-6 probably didn't bring in ""Family Guy"" or ""Simpsons"" numbers. Understandable -- since KOTH is an intelligent show whose humor does not rely on cartoony gags and vulgarity, its appeal is not as widespread as those shows. Still, I cannot see how releasing seasons 7-13 would not be profitable. Even if they (Fox) would deem it too costly to produce themselves, why not license the remaining seasons to a third party? I'll bet a company like Shout would be more than happy to produce them.

At the very least, I wish someone from Fox would give loyal KOTH fans some kind of an explanation from their business perspective. To us it just makes no sense at all. You've got people from all over the world with their wallets out shouting ""please, PLEASE, sell me your product that I've been waiting four years for!"" and you (with arms crossed) saying ""um... NO!"". It's utterly incomprehensible.

While I realize that I can download these shows on the net (torrents, etc.), I like many, would like to be able to buy a nice, professionally produced set (hopefully, with extras).

Shame on you, Fox! You really, truly suck, I tell you what!

Guess, I'm going to have to go the bootleg route after all (*sigh*).",1286755200,24,1264,4.654708520179372
3146797,5,B0015QT76Q,Well it seems this will never now be released. Good job I invested the time and trouble to record seasons 7 - 13 from the UK TV transmissions and then to burn them to DVD for my own personal enjoyment.,1286496000,5,201,4.05
3146798,5,B0015QT76Q,"I like everyone else on here love King of the Hill, I own all of the seasons that were released and had to buy them again where my others were so scratched up from watching too much!!! I have written Fox about the release of the rest of the seasons last year and was told that they see no release of the rest of these seasons in the future. I have no idea why. I can't stand some of the shows that make it to DVD, I am surprised they finished releasing Tales From the Darkside as well. Even when I am having a bad day this show just makes me laugh period. We all need to protest to Fox! Look at all the stupid seasons TLC releases.....Jon & Kate plus 8, Kate plus 8, 56 kids and counting lol, bring out the good stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1284768000,4,732,4.055172413793104

3146800,5,B0015QT76Q,"I, like everyone else who has posted feedback here, have been waiting ANXIOUSLY for the release of Season 7. I truly don't know what the hold up would be?!?! Quit playing corporate politics and get the ball rolling!!!!  I was on a ""notify me"" list for Season6 and purchased it within days of its release....and yes...that was quite a long time ago. The fan-base for this series is wide-spread and abundant which would insinuate that there a plethora of people out there chompin at the bit to see more of their beloved King of the Hill cast!!!! Hell, I'm sure at this point, the DVD's are extremely behind schedule however I have no doubt that if multiple series were released at the same time, consumers wuld snatch them up like hot cakes. *HINT!!!*

3146802,5,B0015QT76Q,Why haven't they released season 7 yet? It's been 4 years since they released the last season of king of the hill. I mean other shows that were pathetic have been released quicker why not king of the hill? Come on FOX release more king of the hill!!,1266451200,34,249,4.208333333333333
3146803,3,B0015QT76Q,"I love ""King of the Hill"" but where is Season 7 for goodness sakes? Now the year is 2010 and its been about 4 years since the release of season 6 cuz I remember it came out in the spring of 2006. I thought since the show came to an end in 2009 that the DVD sets would finally continue to be released, but they haven't yet so what is the delay? I hope it ain't about music rights or something.

I miss having KOTH in the Sunday night animation domination comedy block. It is my favorite of all the newer animated half hour comedies. It would be great to own Season 7 if FOX ever releases it.

It is TOO BAD that Brittany Murphy passed at such a young age of 32. She of course did the voice of Luanne Platter for all 13 seasons. She will be missed but her voice will always live on every time we all watch ""King Of The Hill"" reruns or DVD's.
RIP Britt!",1266192000,6,850,3.9649122807017543
3146804,5,B0015QT76Q,"Fox has always treated ""King of the Hill"" with contempt even though it was one of its outstanding shows. From arbitrary time slot rearrangements to pre-emptions due to football games, from DVD sets with paltry extras to an outright series cancellation followed by a grudging resurrection after more than a year, the network never seemed to fully appreciate a show that was witty and character-driven as opposed to its other prime-time animated series that were fueled by constant blasphemy and mindless vulgarity. Fox has not treated KOTH's large fan base with much respect either, as evidenced by the interminable delays between DVD releases. Come on, Fox! Now that the show is officially canceled, will you please put the rest of the series on DVD already?",1255910400,96,758,5.072
3146805,5,B0015QT76Q,"King of the Hill is my favorite show and I am really disappointed that Fox or whomever owns the rights to this classic cartoon sitcom has not released any season past 6.  I cannot understand it.  This is a long running and popular show.  It seems like the dummest tv shows make it to DVD and not King of the Hill?

If anyone has any info on this please by all means get it out there.  I know many people that would love to have these on DVD.  Comment on my post.

3381285,5,B0015QT76Q,what a bunch of nonsense does it really take this long to release a season on DVD the simpsons do 2 a year for crap sake. All the loyal king of the hill fans are growing inpatient and by the time Fox decides they want to release season 7 there gonna realize that this long wait has cost them some loyal fans. So Fox if your reading these stop being a bunch of giblet heads and just give us what we want.,1291593600,5,403,3.926829268292683
3381286,5,B0015QT76Q,"If you love King of the Hill and would like to see ALL the seasons, I have a solution for you.  If you are a member of Netflix and use the ""Watch it Now"" streaming option online... you can watch ALL the seasons.  With the onslaught of digital media it is cheaper for them to release them like this (I know it sucks).",1291075200,2,316,4.0
3381287,5,B0015QT76Q,"This just leaves me scratching my head. Okay, so the sales of 1-6 probably didn't bring in ""Family Guy"" or ""Simpsons"" numbers. Understandable -- since KOTH is an intelligent show whose humor does not rely on cartoony gags and vulgarity, its appeal is not as widespread as those shows. Still, I cannot see how releasing seasons 7-13 would not be profitable. Even if they (Fox) would deem it too costly to produce themselves, why not license the remaining seasons to a third party? I'll bet a company like Shout would be more than happy to produce them.

At the very least, I wish someone from Fox would give loyal KOTH fans some kind of an explanation from their business perspective. To us it just makes no sense at all. You've got people from all over the world with their wallets out shouting ""please, PLEASE, sell me your product that I've been waiting four years for!"" and you (with arms crossed) saying ""um... NO!"". It's utterly incomprehensible.

While I realize that I can download these shows on the net (torrents, etc.), I like many, would like to be able to buy a nice, professionally produced set (hopefully, with extras).

Shame on you, Fox! You really, truly suck, I tell you what!

Guess, I'm going to have to go the bootleg route after all (*sigh*).",1286755200,24,1264,4.654708520179372
3381294,5,B0015QT76Q,Well it seems this will never now be released. Good job I invested the time and trouble to record seasons 7 - 13 from the UK TV transmissions and then to burn them to DVD for my own personal enjoyment.,1286496000,5,201,4.05
3381295,5,B0015QT76Q,"I like everyone else on here love King of the Hill, I own all of the seasons that were released and had to buy them again where my others were so scratched up from watching too much!!! I have written Fox about the release of the rest of the seasons last year and was told that they see no release of the rest of these seasons in the future. I have no idea why. I can't stand some of the shows that make it to DVD, I am surprised they finished releasing Tales From the Darkside as well. Even when I am having a bad day this show just makes me laugh period. We all need to protest to Fox! Look at all the stupid seasons TLC releases.....Jon & Kate plus 8, Kate plus 8, 56 kids and counting lol, bring out the good stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1284768000,4,732,4.055172413793104

3381297,5,B0015QT76Q,"I, like everyone else who has posted feedback here, have been waiting ANXIOUSLY for the release of Season 7. I truly don't know what the hold up would be?!?! Quit playing corporate politics and get the ball rolling!!!!  I was on a ""notify me"" list for Season6 and purchased it within days of its release....and yes...that was quite a long time ago. The fan-base for this series is wide-spread and abundant which would insinuate that there a plethora of people out there chompin at the bit to see more of their beloved King of the Hill cast!!!! Hell, I'm sure at this point, the DVD's are extremely behind schedule however I have no doubt that if multiple series were released at the same time, consumers wuld snatch them up like hot cakes. *HINT!!!*

There NEVER promoted it and would always pre-empt it or replace it with some other show Fox was trying to sell us. C'mon FOX, do the right thing and continue releasing KOTH on DVD!!!",1267660800,3,331,4.26984126984127
3381299,5,B0015QT76Q,Why haven't they released season 7 yet? It's been 4 years since they released the last season of king of the hill. I mean other shows that were pathetic have been released quicker why not king of the hill? Come on FOX release more king of the hill!!,1266451200,34,249,4.208333333333333
3381300,3,B0015QT76Q,"I love ""King of the Hill"" but where is Season 7 for goodness sakes? Now the year is 2010 and its been about 4 years since the release of season 6 cuz I remember it came out in the spring of 2006. I thought since the show came to an end in 2009 that the DVD sets would finally continue to be released, but they haven't yet so what is the delay? I hope it ain't about music rights or something.

I miss having KOTH in the Sunday night animation domination comedy block. It is my favorite of all the newer animated half hour comedies. It would be great to own Season 7 if FOX ever releases it.

It is TOO BAD that Brittany Murphy passed at such a young age of 32. She of course did the voice of Luanne Platter for all 13 seasons. She will be missed but her voice will always live on every time we all watch ""King Of The Hill"" reruns or DVD's.
RIP Britt!",1266192000,6,850,3.9649122807017543
3381301,5,B0015QT76Q,"Fox has always treated ""King of the Hill"" with contempt even though it was one of its outstanding shows. From arbitrary time slot rearrangements to pre-emptions due to football games, from DVD sets with paltry extras to an outright series cancellation followed by a grudging resurrection after more than a year, the network never seemed to fully appreciate a show that was witty and character-driven as opposed to its other prime-time animated series that were fueled by constant blasphemy and mindless vulgarity. Fox has not treated KOTH's large fan base with much respect either, as evidenced by the interminable delays between DVD releases. Come on, Fox! Now that the show is officially canceled, will you please put the rest of the series on DVD already?",1255910400,96,758,5.072
3381302,5,B0015QT76Q,"King of the Hill is my favorite show and I am really disappointed that Fox or whomever owns the rights to this classic cartoon sitcom has not released any season past 6.  I cannot understand it.  This is a long running and popular show.  It seems like the dummest tv shows make it to DVD and not King of the Hill?

If anyone has any info on this please by all means get it out there.  I know many people that would love to have these on DVD.  Comment on my post.

This show was good all the way until the end, other than a few episodes I can skip over each season, but at least the bulk was good.  The Simpsons has been total garbage since Season 10 yet, 15 years later it's still on the air, still being put on dvd and all the idiots eat it up.  Just makes me sick.

I did just find out the show is available to stream here, so guess I'm signing up for Prime at least for the 30 day trial.",1380585600,2,649,4.03125
