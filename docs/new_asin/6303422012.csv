It brutally contrasts a stereotypical marriage (high school romance & 2 kids) with prostitution so prostitution comes out  more honest and real.  This film is compelling and should to be viewed at  least 3 times before it is transfixing.  The interplays between Kathleen  Turner & Anthony Perkins are incredible and confronting.  The  filmmaking technique is a very creative and unique weaving of the plots;  utilizing duets between the major characters until the final crescendo is  played out.  Anthony Perkins has several monologues that serve as a  narrative for the audience.  Not for the wowserish, nor is it pornographic  (using clever imagery to allude to what is occuring), it is full of very  witty, memorable one-liners.  A film to own because continually renting it  from the video store can become expensive.  An absolute classic.",955497600,9,932,5.140939597315437
643941,5,6303422012,"living in england,its very hard when people ask me what my favourite film is. crimes of passion whats that, they all say,plus we don't have an uncut version over here either. so for the benefit of stuffy british people.  never before has a cast put so much effort into playing there roles,its  very funny,the dialouge is second to none the music by rick wakeman is  perfect, and best of all boring people hate it. i am a 28 year old lady who  runs a victorian teerooms in a little market town in yorkshire and I love  it. go on treat yourself.",954633600,9,543,4.336633663366337
644012,4,6303422012,"I saw this in '84 when it was initially released in theaters. I was familiar with the works of Ken Russell from Altered States, Tommy, The Music Lovers,The Devils (still eager to see the uncut director's cut), and Listzomania. He was a director whose style of excess was very striking and became a instant fan and subsequently have seen most of his films  with mixed reactions. Toward the end one could tell he was making films on the cheap and they often looked it. Crimes of Passion was a wonderful experience. It was totally antithetical to whatever was playing at the time. It was a period when I was looking for something different from the usual Hollywood junk. Along comes Crimes of Passion. It would be many years before I saw the ""unrated, uncensored"" version with Ken Russell's commentary which he abandons about mid way through in order to catch a plane. I am not going to go into a long review of the film itself because it should be seen with a totally fresh and open mind. I guess by today's standards it might appear tame and perhaps even silly at times. I don't know how serious one should watch a Ken Russell film and they are not particularly heavy (except for the previously mentioned The Devils) and they can be pretty daffy at times and Crimes of Passion is chock full of daffy which is amply provided by Anthony Hopkins. Sure, one can dismiss it as another crazy role from Perkins but this is selling it very short. He's not Norman Bates--tthe Reverand Peter Shaye is a different shade of crazy and the scene when China Blue explores his bag of ""toys"" is a highlight being both funny and menacing simulataneously. I could swear the tagline to the film was: One man wanted to possess her, one man wanted to save her---but I could be wrong even if it fits the relationship she has with these two men as her real and fantasy worlds begin to collide. Despite its minor flaws (the characters a bit one dimensional a times) it is still a film that needs to be rediscovered as well as the entire filmography of this mad Brit who made films unlike anyone else.",1433289600,,2074,4.50132625994695

644062,4,6303422012,Another incredible performance by the great Anthony Perkins.  He plays a street preacher trying to reform a prostitute played by Kathleen Turner who also gives an outstanding performance.  But all is not as it seems in this movie--the ending will shock you.  For adults only--not for the prim and proper.,1388016000,,304,5.04
644063,4,6303422012,"""Crimes of Passion"" (1984) is directed by Ken Russell. This is an eclectic film that sometimes has the appearance of a scrapbook with a variety of images and styles intercut. I'm reminded of films like Natural Born Killers with its variety of styles and sarcasm, and Suspiria with its garish, nightmarish colour schemes. This film has a roughness and vibrancy that swings back and forth between the the banal worlds of middle class existence, and the dark, dangerous night life of the city where people live out their fantasies. What makes this film are the delicious performances of Kathleen Turner who balances her corporate day life with her fantasy hooker role of ""China Blue' at night, and Anthony Perkins, who plays a psychotic preacher who battles to suppress his inner demons. The film has a witty and expressionistic treatment of its themes of people who are either trapped by their particular mindset, or have found ways to break beyond their mundane lives, and sexual frustrations, through fantasy and role playing.

This version of the movie has numerous deleted scenes and commentaries.",1384300800,,1099,5.071823204419889

644066,4,6303422012,"I love this movie, but it's not for everyone. There is graphic sex and a few scenes that are disturbing because they are meant to be. But I find it brilliant. On one level, it's an outrageous trip through a surrealistic sexual underworld, all pulsing blue light, flashing neon signs and off-kilter camera angles. However, it's really much deeper, an examination of the permutations of human sexuality and its connection to personal identity. Kathleen Turner is awesome in a truly brave performance as the professional woman who becomes a kinky prostitute by night. She commits 100 percent, and she's mesmerizing. This was at a time when her career was on the ascent and she took a huge chance by doing this. Anthony Perkins' supporting performance as a crazed priest who wants to reform--or kill--Turner's character is insanely over-the-top but works in context, especially since he may or may not be real. The one false note is the last scene, a little happily-ever-after coda in which the film's everyman character, a man struggling with a marriage gone sour, is speaking in a therapy group. I remember reading that Ken Russell was pressured to tack on a happy ending and it sure feels that way, but it doesn't wreck the movie. If this kind of thing is up your alley, by all means go for it.",1373760000,3,1293,4.776785714285714

644070,5,6303422012,"This probing and multi-layered investigation of love, sex, and commitment plays off China Blue's, Bobby's, and The Reverend's situations against each other.  Each's sexual frustrations are extrapolated to the larger and symbolic factors of American life.  China Blue is the woman in search of sexual fulfillment that includes love, but in her disappointment, she becomes a prostitute by night, career woman by day.  Bobby's marriage has mutated into sexual frustration that is also shown as lack of honesty while husband and wife struggle with commitment gone sour.  The Reverend is partly a symbolic representation of Christian confusion about sex and love and partly a representation of China Blue's confused and disappointed search for an authentic man/woman relationship.
The story is not that simple, however, as it contains searing inditements of Christian salvation methods, the mixture of frustrated sexual longings and Christian condemnation of sex, and society's confusion about sex, marriage, and authentic loving relationships.  As the prostitute, China Blue, that character is complex in her dual life, her unlikely opening of herself to a client (Bobby), and her brutal accessments of human sexual nature while leaving open the hope of ""true love."" The story will not resolve into these simplifying statements, however, because all the relationships are multi-dimensional.
For example, the hard bitten China Blue is tender and understanding in the strong scene where she is hired to give a dying man a last sexual thrill.  That scene rises way above this description because of honesty of the ill man's pain and of China Blue's sensitivity to that pain.  In another scene, China Blue is picked up in a limo by a ""Wall Street"" couple who dally with her while discussing a business deal, equating the couple's removal from real feelings and substituting money games.  Her encounters with several male clients explore sexual domination and submission, especially with one (censored*) scene which graphically shows the brutality of a policeman-customer with Blue, but it must be taken as a larger contextual condemnation of violent sex as rape.
Bobby appears a typical American male, frustrated in his marriage, longing for honesty, and trying hard to emerge from his teenage ideas into maturity.  The price of divorce paid by the children is also referenced in a brief scene;  thus, Bobby's divorce is with a large price, and he admits that and other dimensions.  The story does not allow any easy or pat answers.
The Reverend is the most difficult character because he appears to harbor genuine caring for China Blue, but has his own twisted sexuality and confused idea of applying his Christianity to contemporary sexual mores.  That he is made into a mad man, wanting to kill China Blue with a sharpened dildo, may push the story into horror elements that jar with the rest of the depictions.  The final scene where he is killed by China Blue has to be taken symbolically (what will happen when the real police arrive?) in its brutality and unreality, although it does allow China Blue to throw over her ""China Blue"" life symbolically and be able to bond with Bobby.
Overall, the story is a search for authentic feelings and relationships in a world significantly corrupted by lack of trust and confused Christianity and inauthentic sexuality.",1357689600,,3357,5.182994454713493
644121,5,6303422012,"The movie had a lot more questions than answers about relationships, but was much better to me than some of Ken Russell's other works. I got this to add to my Anthony Perkins collection. I must say that it's one of the better of his worst, too. That's a lot to choose from but I follow Tony anywhere.

I looked at local stores for the VHS, but could never find it, and for some time on DVD, hadn't found it either .... so when I recently came to Amazon, and found it .... I couldn't believe my luck.

Spoiler Alert:

It has Kathleen Turner, in her sexiest role, ever.  Revealing almost all of her body, her sexy deep voice, her comedic playfulness, as China Blue, one side of a dual personality.  Let me tell you, 20 years ago, I fell in love with Kathleen Turner seeing this film, and continued to be a fan of the actress.

Anthony Perkins, ever the convincing madman, with a few personalities of his own, out to save China Blue's soul.

Seeing it once 20 years ago, I remembered almost every detail of every event that took place, watching it again was like seeing an old friend.  Now seeing it again, I have fallen for Kathleen Turner all over again.",1335657600,2,988,4.297297297297297

This way, you don't have the constant frame dropping, which was evident on the R rated version. This way, the picture is intact, the way director Ken Russell envisioned it from the start, not the butchered R version that I don't recommend. They say sex sells and they are probably right, as all types can be found in this perverse movie. It's not the first time Kathleen Turner has shown off her ""Body Heat"" and Anthony Perkins proves that he's really typecast as a ""Psycho."" I also love Rick Wakeman's score, which is a take off on Dvorak's New World Symphony, as the movie was originally made for New World Pictures - the company never got the in-joke!",1288396800,6,797,4.541666666666667

But what I discovered years later when the director's version came out is that the imagination of the filmmaker was stifled by the studios and the reinsertion of missing scenes and still images of photographs throughout the film elevated this masterpiece to another level, that of an outstanding piece of oeuvre in the annals of cinema!",1275091200,,905,5.0
644129,4,6303422012,"This movie is a must see for any film lover. It is  such an amazing piece of work, granted it is dated with that look of the 80's that will make many  cringe or laugh out loud. Regardless that  is part of the allure of the  film as it draws you into the world of the three main characters. The  subject matter is  just as  topical  now as it was then, maybe even more so with the advent of the internet, reality television and our addiction to voyeurism and pornography.
There are many layers to this  film, Ken Russel's direction, the cinematography,the screen play, the score, which is  even more advant garde seeing it so many years after it was first made, and of coarse the actors. If you are fans of Kathleen Turner and Anthony Perkins, and who isn't?, then you will be  blown away.
This is easily Kathleen's best film work and really no  other American actress has ever shown such intimacy and duality in the sexuality of her character, it is compelling, enthralling and heart breaking. Plus you feel a connection to her because of her vulnerability that she develops as the movie unfolds. Finally her comedic timing is hilarious, yes there are plenty of laugh out scenes in this film too.

As for Mr. Perkins he is just off the charts and in many  ways this is  such an  honest and raw performance for him, I mean he confronts so many social taboos in his character, that he becomes the mirror for the hypocrisy of sexuality in modern American society. It is more worth considering that for Anthony, and the life he lived, this makes his portrayal even more personal and a  highlight of his career.
The commentary with Ken is awesome, it is too bad  he could not stay for the entire film.",1264982400,6,1696,4.451298701298701
644130,5,6303422012,"After having some big problems with his movie Valentino, which he considered a piece of trash, Ken Russell made two of his most fascinating films for the United States. The first was Altered States and the other Crimes of Passion. In Crimes of Passion, it definitely is, like a precedent reviewer said, a plea for honesty as we witness an art designer spending several night hours as a prostitute called China Blue. Then as she meets a dangerous minister and falls in love with one of her clients, her secret identity starts to shatter.

Though I do not want to reveal more of the story, I can say that the soundtrack, composed by Rick Wakeman the keyboardist of the british group YES, really does an amazing job adapting and remixing Dvorak's ""New World"" symphony. Not only does it reminds of Ken Russell's trademark of using famous classical music for his movies, it also, adds on to Ken Russell's movie which denounces the hypocrisy of the American Society and breaks its idyllic illusion.

A great job from all the cast and the crew. One dvd Ken Russell's fans must see for it is in its uncut and uncensored director's version.",1254182400,4,1131,4.678391959798995

It's clumsy, has no real storyline, and it's not even erotic.  The acting is mediocre, too, by today's standards.  About a half hour into the movie I got the idea that it was not going to get any better, and I had to force myself to watch it to the end.  At least the video was crisp, which brings me to another point.  Somebody goes to the trouble to clean up this piece of crap, yet there are good movies out there (All of Me, Roxanne, Cabaret, Another Woman, to name a few off the top of my head) that deserve remastering, yet are not.

Unfortunately ""Crimes of Passion"" didn't age well for me.  I found that the film felt dated and sexist in the way Turner's character is portrayed.  Some people who have reviewed the film here found the film's ""analysis"" of relationships fascinating.  I found it depressing and naive.  The idea that a prostitute is going to fall in love with a client because of he has passionate sex with her is sophmoric.

644166,5,6303422012,"Fashion designer by day, tantalizing night butterfly by night; the always alluring and mesmerizing beauty of Kathleen Turner, shines in this morbid and arresting story, that deserves to be judged under a wide perspective.

This picture is a gothic gaze around the low depths of the extreme ludicrousness, respect to the repressed fantasies of many people, masked behind conventional behavior patterns. First at all, the obsessive employment of the Adagio of the new World Symphony, the double moral of the preacher who pretends to save the soul of this unhappy and unsatisfied woman, when really he is deeply engaged about her, this hidden attraction must be faced, but the fetichistic arsenal of laughable devices constitutes a dark smile in the middle of the most frightful loneliness, finally the gothic atmosphere in which the film unfolds, invites us to think around the ancient concepts of the comics. This picture is far from pretending to make a meticulous study of the sociological path of certain miscarried souls. Simply it' s a sharp apology, a slap in the face to the exhibited double moral so in vogue at those ages and even now.

Perkins is simply brilliant in this role, it seems to be a far cousin of the disturbed mind of Norman Bates, but having grown up in major crimes of the soul and the good manners.

Once more, let' s remind the ineffable statement of Nicholas Machiaveli: ""The half of the sin is the scandal.""",1131753600,6,1435,4.872950819672131

This is one of the most powerful, disturbing, yet poignant films I've ever seen - right up there with ""Requiem For a Dream"", and ""Blue Velvet.""  First of all, how can you beat the performances of Kathleen Turner and Anthony Perkins?  Better yet - is Perkins' character real?  Or is he China Blue's conscience, used as a pawn to elicit the doubts and insecurities within her, as she  questions the motives and morals behind her supposedly safe choices.  The rest of the cast is - ok - including a pre-Designing Women Annie Potts - but its Turner and Perkins who steal this show.  Quite simply, anyone who has ever struggled with relationships, struggled with life in general - should be able to relate to this movie.  If you scrape off the outer layers, that wonderful, happy, perfect life of yours probably isn't quite so perfect.  It might be easy for some to dismiss this as way too over the top - but that would be like saying Chris Rock is too funny.  Bottom line - See This Movie.",1130198400,20,1159,4.4454976303317535

644171,4,6303422012,"One of Kathleen Turner's earlier films and one of Anthony Perkins's later films....and one of those films of its day.

A woman leads a double life as a designer by day and hooker by night. What's she escaping from? The former high school quarterback turned security ""expert"" and husband - what's he escaping from? And the reverend - what's he about. Watch the film to find out.

This is the film which demonstrated what a great actress Turner is and why she should still be a bigger star today than perhaps she is. She has such a wonderful voice and figure in this film - it's as if the part was written especially for her; perhaps it was! It also shows you how good Perkins was in a role where he could let himself go as over the top as Russell would like him to. He (Perkins) must have loved it.

OK, there are one or two sex scenes and there's some swearing, but the acting by the two leads is excellent. Annie Potts is also very good, as she always is - very different from her Ghostbusters role - but Laughlin is a bit of a disappointment. I wondered whether he was right for the role.

The musical score is supposedly written by Rick Wakeman, but is, of course, derived from Dvorak's New World Symphony. Wakeman does a great job and the music adds to the gloss of the film. The saxophone playing in the lovemaking scene is sensual in the extreme.

Ken Russell is not known for doing things in halves - and he hasn't here. If you can stand the commentary of him and the screenwriter over the film, you can get their thoughts as the movie plays - very insightful and a boon for budding Directors - and find out why he did scenes the way he did.

So, a great film and still very watchable today.",1114819200,8,1698,4.274143302180685
644214,5,6303422012,"This movie is outrageous!  I have loved it since the first time I saw it back in '84.  Turner is like a super nova in this movie just blazing across the screen.  The way she primps, struts, prisses, and drops her one-liner heavy dialogue is a delight.  Perkins is creepy as hell and the hole thing just keeps pushing the envelope further and further.  Definitely not for everybody, but if you have the taste for the bizarre, graphic, over-the-top filmaking, you'll love it.",1092614400,25,473,4.650602409638554

644216,1,6303422012,"It is easy to see that this movie was produced in the drug induced 80's, as someone was on the best stuff to even consider producing, let alone releasing this movie. I believe the intent was to mimic Brian DePalma's thrillers, ""Body Double"" and ""Dressed To Kill"", but this falls woefully short in almost every way. The uncomparably campy performances by all the principal actors makes this unbearable to watch, not to mention the complete lack of relevance in so many scenes. I could go through those scenes one by one, but I don't want this review to become a spoiler. Just believe me, there were many. I will admit Kathleen Turner's quips with her tricks are indeed good, they alone are no reason to watch this movie. There is no compelling story told here. This movie is a chaotic display of different images and scenes loosely bound by sexual activity and some perverse form of the struggle of 'good' against 'evil' or 'sin' and 'salvation', if you prefer.",1077840000,3,960,4.686390532544379
644217,1,6303422012,"Don't get me wrong: I'm not a prude.  I'd love a challenging, sexually-charged film that ignited and then scorched its characters with desire and passion and obsession.  Wind them up and see what happens to them.  LAST TANGO IN PARIS and BODY HEAT come to mind.  But CRIMES OF PASSION, even this Unrated! version, should not.
From the crude, obnoxious opening dialogue to its garish ""sex scenes"" (not to mention the truly embarrassing ""H.P."" scene), CRIMES OF PASSION plays like an attempt at high-minded art by an immature juvenile working with the staff of Hustler magazine.
The lead actor comes off as wooden and inexperienced.  His character never appears sympathetic or even interesting: he's just a shallow lout who dumps his family for a hooker.
Kathleen Turner and Annie Potts are above this horror show.
According to the commentary, Anthony Perkins really is snorting something--which would explain his usual madness this time.
At first, I thought the cheap music was intended as a parody of cheap porn film music, but director Ken Russell professes his admiration for it.  (He also says, ""This is one of the best scripts I've worked with""!).
The climax plays like a ridiculous rehash of PSYCHO--even if it didn't include the original Norman Bates stumbling around in drag.
If you're getting this for the Director's Commentary, be warned: Ken Russell abandons it about twenty minutes into the movie.  Writer/Producer Barry Sandler glosses over Russell's departure (""Ken had to catch a plane back to London"") and then soldiers on, not so much giving any insight into this mess as merely overstating what you're seeing.
No real depth here.  Sleazy, pretentious, offensive for the sake of being offensive.  Not even very funny.
I have no intention of keeping this DVD (a first, and I have a lot of BAD DVDs).  I'm just trying to figure out whether to trade it for credit at a used CD store.
Or just throw it away.",1072828800,2,1919,4.895061728395062
644218,5,6303422012,"That blue dress! That casitone score! Anthony Perkins! That music video! That I wrote the first part of my review in slogans should enlighten you as to the type of film on offer here. It is loud, brash, unsubtle and suffers from a severe lack of dramatic (?) consistency. Whereas these indications should point towards an awful film, this one just seems to work (dementedly). This is a far greater diatribe on exactly what went on in those nether years also known as the eighties. Far more effective than the patina of after the fact examinations (and far scarier than anything Brett Easton Ellis could think up). A must own!

644219,4,6303422012,"In 1984, Kathleen Turner was doing big Hollywood films such as ""Romancing the Stone"". However, on the side she did a more obscure Ken Russell film called ""Crimes of Passion"". This film truly showcases Kathleen Turner's talents as she portrays an advertising executive by day, and a Hollywood hooker by night. Anthony Perkins plays a 'preacher' trying to correct Ms Turner's wrong-doings, while John Laughlin plays a husband searching for intimacy. Any fan of Kathleen Turner will want this film in their collection. I borrowed my friend's copy, and am eager to get it my own.
DVD SUMMARY:
A great transfer to DVD by Anchor Bay, with some deleted scenes thrown in.  Full uncut version of film, but only a mono soundtrack.",1053907200,3,720,4.901639344262295

Although I've been watching it so many times on video, the uncut version on DVD including some newly restored footage is a real bonus, let alone its other bonus materials, like the commentaries and a whole bunch of deleted scenes. ""Crimes of Passion"" is the kind of film that ignites different thoughts on each viewer's mind, although the talents of its director and actors are undeniable to everybody. The sarcastic, witty dialogue is another achievement that can be fairly compared to ""All About Eve"". I for one have been deeply impressed by the innumerable outrageously funny lines exchanged among the characters. One line, however, sounded like a sad memorable quote, not just because it wrapped up the whole plot but it also reminded us of an exceptionally talented and ill-fated actor -- Anthony Perkins: ""Goodbye, China Blue"".",1019952000,33,959,5.037735849056604

Not only does she look down right sexy, but her sassy attitude
plus the film's erotic atmosphere make this film a real treat for cult film fans. Anthony Perkins' performance of the schizophrenic Rev. Shayne makes his character of Norman Bates from Psycho look like the poster child for sanity. There are two versions of this film, but the only one to watch is the unrated version. The real hero of this film however, is its brilliant but twisted director: Ken Russell who delivers a mix of artistic and soft core porn elements to the viewer. It would be a good idea to be/ or get familiar with Russell's work before viewing this film. Still, this is the perfect erotic drama for adults to watch after the kids go to bed.",1008547200,11,786,4.542253521126761

I have always been a fan of Ms. Turner, and the first time I saw it, I was sneaking the opportunity behind my family's back (I wouldn't suggest showing it to young  people.)  Ms. Turner's work is a lot different than Turner's work in  Romancing the Stone!
I continue to appreciate (as well as now better  understand) this film.
The dialogue is quite memorable at times.  And I  have caught myself quoting it on occasion. ""Curiosity killed the  cat"" ""Not until he got out of the bag"" (paraphrased) Ms.  Turner's work is very impressive.  And I still think she deserves an oscar  for SOMETHING.  Perhaps, Sofia Coppla's new film, the Virgin Suicides?  (I  haven't had the opportunity to see it yet.)
