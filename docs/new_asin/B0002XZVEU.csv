8034444,5,B0002XZVEU,"This is a wonderful apologetic for the Christian faith.  The interface used in its presentation throughout each episode is strange at first, but you quickly acclimate to it, even to the point of enjoying the series to a deeper degree.

Each episode is presented as video of a computer screen with a pointer pulling down menus of quotes, videos of interview segments and dramatic vignettes which help flesh out the main point of each episode.  It works.

These episodes concentrate on the philosophic arguments in defense of the Christian faith.  Dr. Green's points are cogent, compelling and persuasive.  He has an easy manner and a great voice.  Buy this series.  This could be used in Bible study and larger presentations.",1171756800,2,724,4.975
