Too much hassle for the few dollars I spent to try to return it so will re-order the dvd from someone else. Was it a human error? Was it product description error? Who knows, I only know I got the wrong movie...Not mad...just dissapointed...",1357948800,,317,4.283333333333333
3004651,5,B000XPU5RU,"This set contains 2 DVDs of the Colgate Comedy Hour (9 episodes total) featuring Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, the funniest comedy duo of all time. A DVD of At War With The Army is also included. The episodes include guests Helen O'Connell, Dorothy Dandridge, Rosemary Clooney, and more. Being a HUGE Jerry Lewis fan, I am biased, but I definitely thought it was worth the money for this collection of laughs.",1348790400,5,408,4.680555555555555
