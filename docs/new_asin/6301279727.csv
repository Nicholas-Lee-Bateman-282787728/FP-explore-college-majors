340165,4,6301279727,"Despite having some story logic problems (if Sky Rocker's that big of a rock star, why doesn't he have a full security detail, and why is the crowd at the airport so small given his apparent popularity? Stuff like that), 'Rockin with Judy Jetson' is a kick to watch. I remember watching it as a very young child, six-seven years old, and wanting very badly to be Judy Jetson. Nowadays, apart from being content being myself, I find there's plenty to admire in Judy---creativity, the gumption to try to get the attention of an influential person, a strong sense of ethics that allows her to confront someone doing something wrong. That said, she does have being boy-crazy and the typical self-centered over-sensitivity going against her, but given her represented age they're forgivable flaws.",1346371200,,792,4.962406015037594
340166,5,6301279727,"I am sooo excited about this finally coming out on dvd.  I loved watching this on vhs when I was younger.  Yes, the story is a lil goofy, but it's still way cute and the music is fun.",1322438400,6,183,3.789473684210526
340167,1,6301279727,The animation is choppy. The songs are forgettable. The cast is bland. The villains are very 1D. The story is ludicrous and jammed with plot-holes and filler moments. The romance between Judy & Sky Rocker is phoned in a mile away and also forgettable. I give this movie a 1 out of 10.,1316217600,5,284,4.377358490566038
340168,3,6301279727,"Well, you'll want to get this if you're like me, and think Judy is totally hot. I have no clue as to when this film was made, or why, yet I seem to find Hanna-Barbera feature animated films popping up all the time on Cartoon Network, and I wonder if they were ever really in theaters or simply made for TV. I could easily believe that this was a made for TV or video movie, but at least it's all about Judy, and it's her original voice, or sounds like it at least. Unlike in the big screen Jetsons Movie, where they used a teen pop singer to voice Judy for the sake of bringing in more kids.
  This is the story of how Judy meets her rock star idol, Sky Rocker, and tries to get him to sing a song she wrote at one of his concerts. Meanwhile, an evil Queen who hates music has a plot to put a stop to all things musical.  When a secret coded message she has been trying to have translated gets mixed up with Judy's song, Sky sings the message at his concert and it becomes an instant hit! Suddenly, Judy is more famous than Sky! Judy doesn't want to take credit for a song she didn`t write though, and so she struggles with that conflict while Sky is struggling with the idea of pretending to be someone he's not. Sky isn't even his real name. Together, the two have to deal with their own issues, their developing romance, and the evil Queen's plot all at the same time. Elroy and Astro do their best to catch up with Judy, and George is trying to locate his daughter too, but things move faster than light in this feature that pokes fun at the fast paced world of teen music and trends. It's clever in how it does this, though not on the level of the live-action Josie and the Pussycats movie. Strangely, Jane Jetson sleeps through most of the picture, so if you're a huge fan of her you won't get much out of it. Overall, it's a cute (especially for Judy fans), simple movie, but probably runs way too long. But that could also be attributed to all the commercials that were running through it when I taped it off Cartoon Network.",1027382400,10,2033,4.194373401534527

7813163,5,6301279727,I used to rent this on VHS as a kid often along with The Jetsons Meet The Flintstones. This is one of my favorite childhood cartoon movies. The plot is great so are the catchy songs. I wish they would release the songs on either CD or iTunes. I love Judy's friends they add to the plot. If you love the Jetsons and haven't seen it I highly suggest watching it. I've been after this movie for years. I didn't want to pay $17 for it so I added it to my DVD wish list. I bought it this month when Amazon had it on sale for less than $12. This is great for kids and adults.,1498953600,,569,3.871794871794872
