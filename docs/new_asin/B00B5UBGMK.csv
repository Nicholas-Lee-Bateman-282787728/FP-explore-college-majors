5559470,5,B00B5UBGMK,"First , and most important, Rene Jacobs and the Frieburger Orchestra play superbly and  all the singing is excellent or even better in the finest tradition.  Now for some details.
  Two hundred years  after his death Haydn's most popular opera during his lifetime is unearthed as a treasure . Musically it stands on its own, but why buy a cd  when this dvd has imaginative  acting that attracts the eye, engages the mind, and makes us laugh out loud?  For Orlando Paladino, a comic opera,  stage directors Nigel Lowery and Amir Hasseinpour  use Monty Pythonesque humor  that propel it into the 21st century..  Virtually the first Haydn opera to come out on dvd  (here with highest engineering quality), this live performance recording is one to watch many times and a terrific  start  to hours of enjoyable discussion. More reviews are sure to follow--see for yourself what is going to be talked about.",1265241600,23,902,4.842105263157895

8563043,4,B00B5UBGMK,"Orlando Paladino is one of the best-known operas by Haydn. Described as a heroic-comic drama, his libretto seeks inspiration in medieval poem Orlando Furioso, by Ludovico Ariosto. The plot of the opera revolves around the love of three men - Orlando, Paladin of France; Rodomonte, King of Barbaria and Medoro, described merely as ""in love with Angelica"" - by Angelica, Queen of Cathay. Here, the work is directed by Nigel Lowery and Amir Hosseinpour, in a version full of moments of lunatic humor. The more conservative viewers certainly will not like. However, the text is not the best; hence the need to get some action on stage. Well, under the musical aspect, we have the excellent Freiburger Barockorchester, conducted by Ren Jacobs. Among the singers stand out Marlis Petersen in the role of Angelica (his arias are rich in coloratura passages, bravely faced by Petersen), Alexandrina Pendatchanska (who recently changed his stage name to Alex Penda, and here plays the sorceress Alcina), and the pair formed by Sunhae Im (a favorite of Jacobs) and Victor Torres, interpreting respectively Eurilla and Pasquale: the comic scenes of the couple are priceless. In an analysis of all the work, we can say that if the libretto is not a masterpiece, there is plenty of high quality music - some ""opera seria"" arias (sung mostly by Angelica), comic scenes (especially by the couple Eurilla and Pasquale) and some madness arias (Orlando). An interesting detail: one of the high points of the recording is Alcina's aria ""Ragion nell'alma siede"", borrowed from another Haydn opera, ""Il mondo della luna"". Indispensable for those who like Haydn.",1376697600,,1640,5.100371747211896
8563044,4,B00B5UBGMK,"There appear to be two ways to look at this production of Haydn's Orlando Paladino recorded at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin in 2009.  You can either view the bizarre elements as a hodgepodge of ideas and a bit of a mess, or you can accept that it simply reflects the perspective of the state of madness of Count Orlando himself, with a little bit of the humour that Haydn injects into his 'dramma eroicomico' (heroic comedy) version of Ariosto's classic tale of the Crusades.  Since it's not entirely successful, there's a case to be made for either of those views but there's maybe a third way of looking at it that surpasses all such considerations.  As directed by Ren Jacobs, it's simply a superb account of the work with some outstanding singing performances that bring a real sense of character to the work.

Character is at least something that there is plentiful supply of in the set and production design of directors Nigel Lowery and Amir Hosseinpour.  Haydn's version of the Orlando legend can still be theatrically rather static, so the production here at least tries to bring it to life.  Partly that's done through Ren Jacobs' conducting of the Freiburger Barockorchester and the use of period instruments - which brings considerable character to the work - but as far as the stage direction goes, it's achieved by adopting the perspective of Orlando in his madness.  A wild beard and shock of hair are the most obvious indications of Orlando's state of mind, but there are other lookalike bearded figures whirling away in the background and sometimes forcing themselves centre-stage between the other figures.  Dressed as a bishop or a matador and even in a wedding dress or as a flight hostess uniform, evidently these are meant to represent various aspects of Orlando's fractured personality but quite how some of these personalities match isn't always entirely clear.

The production then at least has a sense of humour and it's perfectly in keeping with Haydn's relatively light-hearted version of the work.  Orlando Paladino is a very different work from Handel's dark and melancholic Orlando, so there's room for such playfulness, but Haydn can do melancholic wistfulness just as well as comedy, and the production and the musical performance supports and integrates the variety of tones.  If there's not any single reason why this integrates so well and actually works - an opera must come together on every level - the performances of the cast here nonetheless have a lot to do with it.  Marlis Petersen's light, lyrical yet strong and expressive soprano voice seems particularly well-suited to Haydn.  You really have to put personality into the characters like Angelica here, and Petersen has plenty of that.  Tom Randle is a superb Orlando, clear of diction with a deep rounded timbre.  There's nuance of expression here in the singing and the acting, even within such an exaggerated interpretation.  Im Sunhae is particularly sparkling and vibrant as Eurilla, and Alexandrina Pendatchanska an effective Alcina.

Released by EuroArts, the Blu-ray presents the performance well, with a good image transfer and clear, bright stereo and surround audio mixes.  The sound is a little bit echoing because of the stage set and the microphone placement (no wireless mics on the performers here), but it's clear and detailed.  There are no extra features on the disc, but there's a good essay in the enclosed booklet.  There's no synopsis either, but a full printed tracklist is useful.  The BD is region-free, full-HD, BD50, with subtitles in English, French, German and Italian.",1370908800,3,3610,5.023489932885906
8563045,3,B00B5UBGMK,"Excellent picture, very good sound, fine conducting, excellent singers.  Minimalist, cartoonish sets with goofy and needlessly kinetic stage action which undercuts any dramatic impact.  About 20 minutes into this I thought about what time is worth to a middle aged man and concluded that I come out ahead by writing off the purchase price of this DVD; so I went to listen to a Haydn symphony instead.  Now that you know I didn't watch most of this, you can fairly judge how useful or useless this review is to you.",1274918400,10,514,4.688888888888889
8563046,1,B00B5UBGMK,"This has to be one of the worst opera productions I've ever seen.  The staging and costumes were incoherent and silly.  Nothing about this production makes any sense.  Why are there ""wild men"" with long, shaggy hair wearing tutus dancing in the background?  I love to laugh and I'm easy to please, but this stuff is just NOT funny.  The story line is simple and the music is okay, perhaps divorced from this ridiculous production it might have been somewhat entertaining.  The only good thing I can say about it is that Marlis Peterson sang well.  Watching, I thought all the singers must be wishing they were not in this farce.  A couple minutes into Act 2, I turned it off.  I advise you to skip it unless you are a Haydn freak.  Actually, if you are a Haydn freak, you should skip this too, as it will make you sick.",1273795200,8,819,4.364238410596027
8563047,4,B00B5UBGMK,"I was excited to acquire this DVD, because I love Haydn's operas, but this DVD is a mixed bag.  The music and singing are wonderful, but I found the staging/production design to be weird and annoying.  There were several thing that just didn't make sense -- like the ""underworld"" scene in the 3rd act and the derelict-looking nymph-like characters always running around in the background.  Some day I hope to see a more traditional staging of this opera.  I completely agree with the 2-star review, but I give it four stars because the music is so good.",1272672000,5,553,4.670103092783505
8563048,2,B00B5UBGMK,"What a disappointment from the Staatsopern of Berlin! We have seen some ""controversial"" Ring-cycle there, but nothing ever this primitive stageing. This is the first Haydn opera available on DVD, with a good cast and a very respectable orchestra, and it came on the level of a kiddie-show.

The British director and his Iranian choreographer pushed the singers to make the opera ""heroic-comic""; unfortunately the whole thing became a Punch-and-Judy show, and was not a bit funny or ""comic"" no matter how hard they tried. You could not help feeling sorry for the brilliant soprano Marlis Petersen and some others of the cast for being degraded to this level of primitiveness. They visually felt uncomfortable, and we could not hear any laughs either from the Staatsopern audience during the whole ""funny"" forced-acting [it was a live performance recorded].

Together with a number of unexplainable, cartoonlike extras, the singers aimlessly kept running around the revolving stage,and the extensive and extreme rushing often hindered their singing. My wife and I finally just closed our eyes and thus listened to the beautiful music and singing. The story-line of this opera is essentially the same as Vivaldi's Orlando Furioso, but the music is Mozartian. With a somewhat normal production this would make a very enjoyable evening, unfortunately the directors strange ideas completely poisoned the performance.

Frankly, I could not understand how two seemingly professional Amazon reviewers before me considered this an excellent production and not as an other example of the recent Eurotrash efforts.",1272672000,24,1602,5.4
8563049,5,B00B5UBGMK,"""Orlando Paladino"" is said to have been the most 'popular' of the 20 operas composed by Joseph Haydn, but that success didn't survive the 19th C. Despite the evergreen popularity of the Big Five operas of Mozart, despite the thriving revival of operas by Rameau, Gluck, Paisello and other composers of Haydn's epoch, performances and even studio recordings of Haydn's operatic output have remained scarce and scarcely noticed. One has to wonder why. It's certainly not a shortcoming in the music, which has all the color and inventiveness of Haydn's symphonies and oratorios. Usually the blame is laid on the plots, the stage action. Haydn's operas are said to be far-fetched and lacking in drama. But even if that were so, wouldn't the successful revival of Handel's farther-fetched and dramatically stagnant operas suggest that another explanation is needed?

Possibly it's Haydn's ""image"" problem. Perhaps people imagine him as Papa, a servile old formalist in a wig and livery, bending his knee to his Esterhazy patron. Or perhaps it's just the shadow of Mozart, which falls upon Haydn more densely than on others. In any case, it's unjust and ignorant, and OUR loss.

""Orlando Paladino"", first performed in 1782, was designated as a ""dramma eroicomico"" - a mock-heroic drama. That's certainly how it's performed on this DVD from the Staatsoper Unter den Linden of Berlin, filmed in 2009. ""Heroism"" is the butt of burlesque humor and madcap dramaturgy. Anyone who comes to see this DVD 'cold', expecting baroque passions and aristocratic dignity, will be startled; the staging is zany, loopy, silly, a parody of chivalry staged in an insane asylum. Characters twitch like victims of Tourette's Syndrome and fall into catatonia between arias. The whole cast seems to have eaten the wrong toadstools or grain infested with ergot. It's a little unsettling at first, especially if you were expecting opera seria. After one adjusts, however, it's positively brilliant, this surreal world of wizardry and vocal virtuosity. If any future reviewer dares to natter about ""Eurotrash"" modernization, Haydn's own ghost will rise and haunt them. ""Papa"" would have loved the fun!

The libretto, by Nunziato Porta, is based on the mock-epic poem ""Oralando Furioso"" by Lodovico Ariosto (1474-1533), the most widely read tale of wizardy ever written before Harry Potter. But Ariosto's popularity lasted 300 years, a span Harry Potter is unlikely to match. Dozens of madrigals were composed on stanzas from Orlando Furioso, as well as some of the finest baroque operas, by composers including: Caccini, Luigi Rossi, Vivaldi (3), Handel (2), Lully, Rameau, Piccinni, Mehul, Ambroise Thomas, and, of course, Joseph Haydn. The audience at that premiere in 1782 would have known the plot of Ariosto's poem as well as readers today know Tom Sawyer. They would have been surprised - delighted, I assume - by the reversal of character in the role of Alcina that Haydn's opera presented. In every other 'Orlando' libretto, Alcina is a malevolent witch who turns men into beasts. In Haydn's ""Orlando Paladino"", Alcina is a benevolent sorceress who rescues the lovers Angelica and Medoro and who restores the raging Orlando to sanity. I couldn't help thinking of her in relation to the benevolent sorcerer Sarastro of Mozart's ""Magic Flute"". That linkage is worth pursuing. Opera fans, if you enjoy The Magic Flute, with all its coloratura silliness, you'll also love Orlando Paladino. Wait till you hear Alcina's final prismatic coloratura aria!

Alcina is sung by Alexandrina Pendatchanska in this production; her role seems somewhat peripheral, musically, until the final scenes, but then she dazzles. Angelica is sung by Marlis Petersen, who dazzles both vocally and visually throughout. The two blowhard heros, stuffed with braggadocio - Orlando and Rodomonte - are sung deftly and acted manically by Tom Randle and Pietro Spagnoli. There are no 'sopranos' of either gender in male roles here, by the way, and several quips are tossed off about the lovely voices of 'castrati.' Angelica is beautiful and pathetic. Medoro, sung by Magnus Staveland, is comically pathetic, a timid boy toy for Angelica. The broadest humor is saved for the 'plebeian' characters, the shepherdess Eurilla, sung by Sunhae Im, and Orlando's sly but cowardly servant, Pasquale, sung by Victor Torres. Im and Torres are dynamite as comics, almost stealing the show with their physical antics as well as their magnificent singing. Make no mistake, while guffawing at the bizarre stagecraft, that the singing is the heart of the art here, the whole justification for sitting through three hours of chivalric balderdash. This is a convincing exhibition of 'historically informed' vocal technique, all voices of the clearest timbre and the most passionate agility.

Naturally one would expect plenty of orchestral excitement from a work by Haydn, and one will not be disappointed. The orchestral score swirls and rumbles around the arias on equal terms with the singing, demonstrating what we should have known, that Haydn was the great innovator of symphonic opera. You WILL hear foreshadowings of Rossini and even Verdi in 'Orlando Paladino"". The Freiburger Barockorcheter, with Ren Jacobs conducting, wields its 'period' instruments - even the natural horns! - with flawless tuning and precise ensemble. This is a showpiece of musical magic, fans. Expect the unexpected!

Most of us today will sheepishly confess that we've never read, maybe never heard of, Ariosto. So, to be helpful, here's the wiki-brief synopsis of the original 46-canto poem:

""""The action of Orlando Furioso takes place against the background of the war between the Christian emperor Charlemagne and the Saracen King of Africa, Agramante, who has invaded Europe to avenge the death of his father Traiano. Agramante and his allies - who include Marsilio, the King of Spain, and the boastful warrior Rodomonte - besiege Charlemagne in Paris. Meanwhile Orlando, Charlemagne's most famous paladin, has been tempted to forget his duty to protect the emperor through his love for the pagan princess Angelica. At the beginning of the poem, Angelica escapes from the castle of the Bavarian Duke Namo, and Orlando sets off in pursuit. The two meet with various adventures until Angelica saves a wounded Saracen knight, Medoro, falls in love, and elopes with him to Cathay. When Orlando learns the truth, he goes mad with despair and rampages through Europe and Africa destroying everything in his path. The English knight Astolfo journeys to Ethiopia on the hippogriff to find a cure for Orlando's madness. He flies up to the moon (in Elijah's flaming chariot no less) where everything lost on earth is to be found, including Orlando's wits. He brings them back in a bottle and makes Orlando sniff them, thus restoring him to sanity. (At the same time Orlando falls out of love with Angelica, as the author explains that love is itself a form of insanity.) The siege of Paris is lifted and Orlando kills King Agramante. Another important plotline involves the love between the female Christian warrior Bradamante and the Saracen Ruggiero. They too have to endure many vicissitudes. Ruggiero is taken captive by the sorceress Alcina and has to be freed from her magic island. He also has to avoid the enchantments of his foster father, the wizard Atlante, who does not want him to fight. Finally, Ruggiero converts to Christianity and marries Bradamante. Rodomonte appears at the wedding feast and accuses him of being a traitor to the Saracen cause, and the poem ends with Ruggiero slaying Rodomonte in single combat. Ruggiero and Bradamante are the ancestors of the house of Este, Ariosto's patrons, whose genealogy he gives at length in Canto 3 of the poem.""

You'll find it equally helpful for comprehending Handel's operas Alcina & Ariodante.",1269648000,16,7865,5.182533438237608
