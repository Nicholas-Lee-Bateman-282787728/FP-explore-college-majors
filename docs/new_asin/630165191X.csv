347827,3,630165191X,"For anyone who's looking for a higher definition and wide screen version of this movie, this is what you're looking for at this time.  Until a company in the States upgrades this to Blu Ray, this German production is an adequate stand-in.  The picture quality is way better than the full screen DVD I've been watching for years.  The sound, however is not so great.  It's 2.0 (stereo) and kind of...low...I guess is how I would describe it.  There are two English tracks to choose from but they're both stereo and I can't tell a huge difference between them.

There are some extra features that are in German or kind of lame.",1498003200,,625,4.535714285714286
347828,3,630165191X,"Marc Price plays Eddie Weinbauer, a hopeless heavy metal dork who gets sucked into the world of the occult when his shock-rock idol, Sammy Curr (Tony Fields, playing an off-brand Alice Cooper) dies in a mysterious fire. A local rock-radio DJ (Gene Simmons) takes pity on Eddie's plight and bestows upon him the only copy of Curr's last recording. To say the production of this recording leaves much to be desired would be an understatement, which is to say nothing of its shoddy song-writing. Perhaps growing tired of its lack of melody or any discernible hooks, Eddie is inspired to start playing the record backwards, and soon discovers that there are Satanic messages/directives back-masked throughout. Soon, he's putting the archetypal school jocks (who feel imported from a ""Karate Kid"" film) in their place and somehow winning the affections of his cute schoolmate Leslie (Lisa Orgolini). There's also some business about a slobbering demon and ear-melting headphones, but pay no mind.

""Trick Or Treat"" is the sort of film that existed only in obscurity until sometime in the early 2000s when it started cropping up in $5 bargain bins everywhere. Its promise of heavy metal/horror movie debauchery with Gene Simmons and Ozzy Osbourne (who appears in but a cameo) front and center too much to resist, the film is ultimately the best kind of bait and switch. The film's main focus is on its dweebish but painfully relatable protagonist. Produced amidst the great slasher boom of the mid-'80s, ""Trick Or Treat"" is refreshing if not utterly silly. Its plot and tone feels like ""The Breakfast Club"" filtered through John Carpenter's ""Christine"" and even at its most cringe-inducing, doesn't fail to entertain. Punctuating the action is a rather rad heavy metal soundtrack, mostly provided by the obscure yet apt Fastlane.

The special effects by Kevin Yagher (""Child's Play"") are none too shabby for their time, and likewise, the acting from the kids is about on par with other films of its era. Its concept is admittedly thin and sometimes stretched too thin, but the film has more than enough charm and delivers enough laughs (unintentional or otherwise) that any flaws are ultimately forgiven. Fans of '80s schlock won't want to pass this one up, even if its DVD currently features a pretty hefty price tag. Who knew raiding the $5 bin at your local big box store 15 years ago could've been a worthy investment?",1494028800,,2416,4.992555831265508

347874,5,630165191X,"I never saw this film in theaters. I did get the soundtrack which I loved. Fastway was great, I good choice for the film. Now onto a review of the film. This film to me is the best of it's Genre, Unlike the Stupid horror Metal Film ""Black Roses"" Which was unrealistic and cheap looking. Trick or treat nailed the metal scenes of the 1980's. Marc Price did a superb job as a high School Metal fan. His look, Voice and Mannerism was dead on. Even the way he dressed and wore his hair. Then supporting cast was awesome in their own right. But the most credit in this film goes to the late Tony Fields as Sammi Curr. Originally Blackie Lawless was up for the role of the Demonic Sammi, Poor move if it came to be. For the simple reason it would be Blackie Lawless in the film not the character of Sammi Curr. Sammi was a Tommy Lee type from Motley Crue's ""Shout at the Devil"" era. And He played it in a threating way not scary, which I loved. Also Charles Martin Smith did a great job directing his first ever film!

The cameos of Gene Simmons and Ozzy Ozbourne were okay, But I honestly feel they should have gone with good unknown actors for these parts. This to me kills the realism of the story and film. The only production flaw in the film is the boom microphone in one shot. But I can deal with that. Trick or Treat is a fun Horror Movie. Which is good for introducing someone to the genre of Horror. It's too bad a sequel was not made, it would have been interesting to see what other options this story could've had.",1462492800,,1521,4.191126279863481

347916,4,630165191X,"Eddie Weinbauer is a lonely, bullied, high school outcast who's a big fan of hard rock and metal. His only real friends are the equally social outcast, Roger Mockus; and the popular, down to earth, cutie Leslie Graham. He commonly writes letters to and listens to music of his hero, heavy metal musician, Sammi Curr to help cope with his struggles at school. Sammi is a vulgar and infamous superstar of the town Eddie lives in and even went to the same high school as Eddie when he was his age. While watching the news one afternoon, Eddie discovers that Sammi is banned from returning to Lakeridge High to perform at the school's upcoming Halloween party after members of the school board as well as citizens of the town feel that his music is corrupting the youth

For Eddie, life gets even worse when it's announced on that same news broadcast that Sammi died in a mysterious hotel fire. He goes to his friend, Nuke, a radio DJ who knew Sammi personally, and gives him a gift to help him cope with Sammi's death. The gift is the only produced copy of Sammi's last record that was banned from being released to the public. That night while playing the album, Eddie plays the record backwards with hidden lyrics that accidentally resurrects Sammi from the dead. Now Sammi is back as an electrical spirit, alongside Eddie to not only to get revenge on his bullies, but also the critics that degraded his music. At first Eddie thought a little bit of revenge would be harmless and while it sort of starts off that way, things quickly become evil and deadly. What Eddie thought of as rock n' roll, has now become a sinister game of life and death. Death. Resurrection. Destruction. It's the ultimate comeback and now only Eddie Weinbauer can thwart Sammi Curr's demonic plans or die trying

Overall: Trick or Treat is a clever film as a whole and the clever ones who put it together deserve a pat on the back. During a decade in which rock n' roll and metal was probably the most popular, they took Halloween and the popular 80s music genres and mixed them together to deliver this shockingly (no pun intended) entertaining little film. The plot has the typical 80s bully vs outcast plot and puts a humorously evil twist on it by having the outcast look revenge in otherworldly spirits only to have that plan backfire. The first half of the movie is captivating to say the least. Seeing Eddie contact Sammi's spirit to guide him with his social problems was cool. The way Sammi manages to bring his physical form back to life was refreshing as well! I won't give away how it happens but I'll just say it involves a can of Pepsi. Eddie's struggle to try and send Sammi back to hell. It was all a lot of fun to watch unfold. The second half was still fun but not as good as the first half. The second half focuses mostly on Sammi's rampage. If you're looking for gruesome kills, you won't find them here. No blood is spilled in this film. Not a drop. All of the kill scenes in this film come in the form of electricity, most of which were pretty thin and feeble. There's a brief topless scene where a girl shows her tastykakes during an interesting sex scene that you'll have to see to believe. The performances overall were plausible. We also get some minor appearances from rock n' roll legends Ozzy Osbourne and Gene Simmons. Overall, Trick or Treat is an underrated Halloween treat of a comedy horror film. I had no idea it even existed until a couple of weeks ago when searching for Halloween themed horror films to enjoy this Halloween season. Turns out this film is OOP. I recommend giving Trick or Treat a buy and a watch this Halloween season for some enjoyment on these upcoming cool and breezy nights. Don't be fooled though. They place Gene Simmons and Ozzy Osbourne on the cover to try and trick people into automatically buying the movie, giving them the assumption they play big roles in the movie. They don't. They make an appearance here and there and that's it. It's not strict horror and not entirely meant to be taken seriously. It's main goal and purpose is entertainment and it succeeded on every--or at least most levels with that.",1444262400,,4150,4.5467914438502675

347989,4,630165191X,"I've heard about 1986' ""Trick or Treat"" for years, but didn't get around to seeing it until last night. It's a teen dramedy/horror flick mixing elements of ""Christine,"" ""Carrie"" and the Freddy Krueger movies, but it strangely never attained the popularity of those films, which explains why there was never a sequel. Like ""Christine"" and ""Carrie,"" the plot revolves around a semi-outcast in high school being persecuted by the popular crowd and the compulsion to get revenge. In this case, metalhead Eddie Weinbauer (Marc Price) enlists the aid of a dead satanic rock star, Sammi Curr, through the backmasking on one of his albums.

Gene Simmons of KISS appears as a DJ for a few minutes and Ozzy Osbourne appears in two scenes as a conservative preacher denouncing rock/metal for a total of a minute.

Lisa Orgolini and Elise Richards, both beautiful, stand out as the two main teen girls in the story.

The songs on the soundtrack are by Fastway and are reminiscent of mid-80's bands like AC/DC, KISS and Motley Crue.

BOTTOM LINE: While ""Trick or Treat"" isn't technically as good as ""Christine"" or ""Carrie,"" it's not far off and I prefer it to the Freddy Krueger movies I've seen. The villain -- the semi-resurrected Sammi Curr -- is great; he looks and behaves like a mixture of Gene Simmons, Dee Snyder, Blackie Lawless, Nikki Sixx and King Diamond. Too bad the movie didn't become a franchise because Sammi Curr has the ee-vil charisma to give Freddy Krueger a run for his money. While the set-up of the story is compelling, the second half fumbles a bit, but this is made up by the two girls and the rockin' mid-80's soundtrack.

The film runs 98 minutes and was shot in Wilmington, NC.

347996,3,630165191X,"The film, er, movie opened in theaters on 10/24/86; the album (cassette and vinyl Lp) came out maybe two weeks later.

DVD Packaging and menu:  very, very basic (2003).  Menu is simply ""play movie"" and ""chapters.""

I came by notice of the motion picture via fundie preacher Jeff Godwin's book, DANCING WITH DEMONS, THE MUSIC'S REAL MASTER, from 1988, which devotes pp. 140-148, Chapter 5, ""Tricks in the Dark,"" to his annoyed review, claiming having sat through this masterpiece.  Jeff's book included a whopper allegation that the album (Lp) has a ""demon blessing"" occult symbol on the label, a downward-pointing triangle inside a circle.  Uh, I had a head-slapping vinyl junkie moment realizing I knew that dreaded occult symbol placed there by a coven of witches (Jeff's prior book, THE DEVIL'S DISCIPLES, has an afterward testimonial by witch ""Eileen"" giving details about record company demon blessing invocations)...it's Sony Music corporate-speak on all 1985+ Columbia vinyl albums, CDs, and cassettes that means, ""manufactured in the USA using a digital master also available on Compact Disc.""  (Sony bought Columbia Records for the A&R back catalog to float the CD.)

Hurray for DVDs:  the TV/DVD remote worked wonders while making notes....

At about 6:50, a TV scene of Mrs. Cavell from the local PTA pontificating about ""addiction"" to rock music (shades of Bill Gothard's IBLP teachings).  Then a fictional scene with Sammy Curr during a legislative hearing referencing the 9/19/85 PMRC hearings with Frank Zappa mixing it up with Tipper's circus.  Segue to Sammy Curr, aged 38, dead in a hotel fire.  (Note:  Cur, er, Curr = dog.  Now a Hound of Hell?  I also caught that Sammy... is age 38 in the scene.  Sammy Hagar at the time was 38, born 10/13/47.  ???)
9:01 -- local radio DJ WZLP gives distraught kid an acetate of Sammy's final album.  A minor quibble:  acetates (aluminum core disc with a lacquer surface cut one at a time on a recording lathe, fed by the final mixdown tape master) are one-sided, so Ragman's treasure is a one-sided disc with maybe ten good spins with good audio quality (and only half the album)...which he essentially destroys on his turntable (and it skips, too).  And he back-spins his turntable while the motor is playing forwards, effectively wrecking that hardware (before he puts a baseball bat to it).  Who knows where and who owns/warehouses the record company A&R master tapes it was made from....
18:27-- enter ""backward masking,"" a mania created by a tire salesman/Amway distributor/brain researcher on PTL in early '82, blown up to ludicrous proportions in California by a Tehachapli legislator up for re-election in April, 1982, debunked by some Canadian psychology professors in Canada a year later, but still making the church urban legend spooky rounds into the early '90s.
18:30 or so--segue into Sammy inside a fire-lit circle (I looked for a/the pentagram, but didn't see it in that scene.)  And HIT PARADER prominently displayed--a reference to Jimmy Swaggart's successful campaign to get the mag pulled off retail shelves.
33:00--Mom looks at Lps by Impaler, Exciter, and Megadeath.  The album montage idea was later picked up and more fully extended/refined in Eric Holmberg's docu...movie, HELLS BELLS, two years later.  Ragman enters room, lights black candles (occult reference!!!  Where's the Ouiji Board???), and makes his tape from his decaying collectors' worn acetate.
39:00 -- young woman dons a pair of Radio Shack Nova 45 headphones and re-enacts Dan & Steve Peters' (book:  THE PETERS BROTHERS HIT ROCK'S BOTTOM) fact (""fact""?) that 984 out of every 1000 girls listening to rock music become pregnant.
42:00--Ozzy gets his one of his two movie cameos as Reverend Aaron Gilstrom decrying ""rock pornography.""  I swear I've seen a fundie TV interview that this cameo faking references/parodies--Scott Ross at Pat Robertson's CBN?  A PTL interview?  John Muncy spinning backmasking conspiracies?  ???
45:00--Ragman destroys the playing surface of his acetate, again.
51:44--Reverend Aaron Gilstrom appears on TV again botching and mumbling his lines, enduring a brain aneurysm that he still hasn't recovered from to this day.
60:00 (one hour in)--begin re-enactment of CARRIE'S finale dance scene with Sammy & the Kickers, plus a bathroom break.

This picture should be prominently featured on Svengoolie's show!  It's a great low budget flick, made-for-TV quality, that lit off preachers, spoofing their rock/horror allegations.  Three stars for the skimpy nature of the 2003 DVD, however.

Album:

Sony/Columbia released it a little after the movie as TRICK OR TREAT, Sony/Columbia SC 40549 at $9.98 list, jacking the album's price a buck more than the group's two prior U.S. $8.98 list albums.  It debuted on the Billboard charts about Thanksgiving, '86, hugged the bottom listings on the album charts, and ran out of steam in early February, 1987.  Columbia effectively dumped the project into the midline series (knock off $3-4 off on the cheapie THE NICE PRICE series as PC 40549), and recouped another five months in the budget bins.  If you have this on vinyl, look at the release number on the Lp spine and record label; original release was SC 40549.  The budget line reissue was PC 40549.

Sound:  the album (CD) volume level reads about halfway up the recording meter; it's mastered to the dynamics of vinyl, not digital compression.  The meat of the album is in the first four tracks; tracks 5-7 sound not quite finished, an afterthought.  Tracks 8-9 are not in the movie, and have a different, updated feel versus the balance of the album preceding them, like they were tacked on.  Strongest tracks are #4, ""Stand Up,"" easily the best on the album, and #2, ""After Midnight.""  Weakest is the inclusion of #5, ""Tear Down the Walls,"" which runs about l:50, but of that :40 is a long fade-in introduction, about :50 music by the band, and another :20 fade-out.  #6 runs about 3:30, but it also has a :40 long introduction.  Total running time on the CD is about 34 minutes.  The mix on the album plays down the drum/bass rhythm into the background, while the vocal is front and center, flanked by guitars.  The drums should have been more up in the mix.  The album sounds like it had four hastily finished tracks, three also-rans, and two extra tracks tacked on to extend the running time on the album.  Rock albums at the time were generally about 40-44 minutes duration, so it's short by 1986 vinyl/cassette standards.

End credits show the following tracks from the movie NOT on the soundtrack:
""Scream Until You Like It"" -- Only Child
""Grey, Grey, Grey"" -- See Jane Run
""Tot"" -- Only Child
""The Haunted House of Rock"" -- Whodini
""It's Up to You Now"" -- Diana Blair
""Heartbreakin' Lie"" -- Diana Blair

On the album, the final two songs, ""Heft,"" and ""If You Could See"" by Fastway, are not shown in the movie end credits.  CD version is CK 40549; I recall CDs at the time being $14.99 or so.  The album wasn't originally available on the CD format, as late as December 27, 1986, per Billboard's Top Lps chart information on the CBS releases.",1412294400,2,7124,4.97548605240913

348070,5,630165191X,"With the month of October in full swing we're inundated with horror movies to choose from. A few choice channels are giving us viewers plenty of options, but nothing like the 1986 classic Trick or Treat. Now this has been a film on our radar for quite some time now. In fact about ten years ago we saw it Wal-Mart for under $5 and made the poor choice of passing it up. Now that it's selling for $40+ we luckily came across this beauty on-line and were finally able to indulge. And what better time of the year to give this film it's just due? After viewing we were extremely satisfied with the effort and feel Skippy from Family Ties delivered the finest work of his career. In fact his top notch performance is what most likely landed him the Family Ties gig. Now as far as the cover goes, yes Ozzy and Gene are in the film but for no more than 5 minutes in total. Even they realized this movie would someday make a trip to the five dollar bin and gave their performances the appropriate time allotment. Despite their legendary rock careers, there may have been no finer achievement then there roles in Trick or Treat.

Trick or Treat follows heavy metal lover Eddie Weinbauer (Skippy) and his day to day life in Lakeridge High School. Eddie was your typical 80's metalhead that received the daily jock beat downs only to find solace from his favorite rocker Sammi Curr. Sammi Curr is a real wildman and winds up burning to death after some mysterious hotel fire. Eddie is devastated and turns to his disc jokey pal Nuke, played by Mr. Gene Simmons. To numb the pain, Nuke gives Eddie a demo record of Sammi Currs before he plays it at midnight on Halloween. Without delay Eddie brings that sucker home to rock out but realizes the record is a bit darker than expected. When played backwards he can communicate with Sammi Curr. Sammi promises he has a plan for Eddie and the revenge against his bullies begins. This obviously spirals out on control and Sammi eventually come bursting through the speakers to kill everyone he can despite Eddies pleas for no more vengeance. This falls on def ears as ghost Sammi puts on an impromptu show at the high school dance blasting all spectators with volts from his electric guitar. This scene is the finest in the entire movie. Eventually Eddie and a couple friends realize that the ghost rocker can only appear when electricity is present. They then devise a scheme to capture him in the back of a cop car and drive him into a lake for a final execution. It is every bit as absurd as it sounds, and boy is it awesome!

There is something very perfect about 80's horror movies with a dose of rock n roll undertones. We were first introduced to this golden combo last year with the hilarious viewing experience of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rock-n-Roll-Nightmare/dp/B000FI8MMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rock 'n' Roll Nightmare</a>. For some reason when rock riffs meet horror magic seems to happen. Sure these movies are deplorable to the conventional masses, but they are so very right for the right viewer. Ideally if you grew up or were a high school kid in the 80's then a movie like Trick or Treat has to resonate with you. It just captures a specific feeling of a time that can only be revived through movies and music. It brings you back to a time when you had to leave your house to go and rent a movie to enjoy. A time when you'd browse the video store horror section, stumble across something like Trick or Treat, and know you'd be in for a good night. Not only does the movie provide a nice dose of sentimentality but it will also give you and hour and a half worth of laughs. They just don't make movies like this anymore. Sure they still make tons of bad movies, but not with the fines of the 80's or 90's. If you haven't seen Trick or Treat as of yet then we strongly suggest firing this one up at your earliest convenience. You will not be disappointed.",1381708800,,3959,4.582510578279266

348196,4,630165191X,"Trick or Treat, a 1986 film directed by Charles Martin Smith, written by Rhett Topham, Joel Soisson and Michael S. Murphy and music by Fastway, is another one of the most underrated films of the 1980's that happens to be yet a very entertaining flick that not only scares but also teeters on the edge of spoof.

The whole film starts with a young man named Eddie(Family Ties' Mark Price)who is an outcast at his high school and is also into very loud heavy metal hard rock. His idol is a controversial rocker named Sammi Curr(Tony Fields, may he rest in peace)and he has a huge poster of him over his bed. Eddie is writing a fan letter to Sammi and after sealing the envelope with the letter in it, he hears the most distressing news that Sammi is killed in a hotel fire. He turns to a DJ friend of his named Nuke(Gene Simmons of KISS)and Nuke gives him Sammi's last album on an acetate disc as a souvenir and when Eddie plays it, he receives a message from beyond the grave by Sammi with ideas on how he can get even with his enemies in school. First, Eddie lets Sammi do what he wills, but later, Eddie tries to back out of the plan, but Sammi won't stop. But when it gets out of control on the night of the annual Halloween dance in the high school gymnasium, Eddie now knows that he has to stop Sammi Curr before it's too late because the whole human race is at stake. I won't give too much away as I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen this film as of yet.

Trick or Treat is a much underrated horror classic. It is a very entertaining horror film and is also the first horror film completely centered on Heavy Metal rock and roll music. It is also a wonderful and fun romp that can be watched over and over again anytime and it doesn't have to be October 31st. The point is that it can be watched anytime and on any day and it would still be fun.

The film also has a very amusing cameo by Ozzy Osbourne as a televangelist(which was the butt of jokes back in the day on all the late night talk shows). Price is good as Eddie and Lisa Orgolini is also good as Leslie, a girl that Eddie is very interested in and Tony Fields gives a classic over the top performance as evil rocker Sammi Curr. Trick or Treat is a wonderful film filled with rocking music, scares and a few laughs.

I saw this film back in the day at a local bargain cinema in my hometown and I enjoyed it immensely. I bought this film on DVD nearly six years ago on Amazon and when I received it, I watched it again and I still enjoyed it as immensely as I did back in the day. The film brought the feelings of wonderfulness that I felt when I watched this at the local bargain cinema back. I still watch this movie when I can and believe me, it is a wonderful and entertaining romp from beginning to end.

The DVD still leaves a lot to be desired. It is strictly a bare bones DVD with no special features. It doesn't even have the film's theatrical trailer, nor it's TV spots, not even a commentary by the filmmaker or the cast and no featurettes. It is strictly a bare bones DVD with only a starter menu and scene selections.

This film was different in it's approach to slashing it's victims. Instead of using knives and stabbing weapons, the villain uses electrodes that completely obliterate the victim leaving no trace of them left. The film also has a scorching and infectious rocking soundtrack by Fastway.

Blackie Lawless of W.A.S.P. was initially sought to play Sammi Curr, but was later dropped when he insisted on doing his own singing and his own moves rather than the moves that the choreographer wanted him to do.

In 2006, Anchor Bay Entertainment was all set to release a 20th Anniversary Edition of the film on DVD, but was cancelled due to legal problems concerning music copyrights. Maybe one of these days, we will get a much more definitive edition of this fun movie on DVD than this Platinum Disc edition, which is now out of print. We can only hope.

Trick or Treat should be a part of any horror film lovers DVD library and also, a part of any Heavy Metal music lovers library. It is a wonderful and fun romp that is still entertaining no matter what decade it is watched. It is also a much underrated horror classic and also, one of the most underrated movies of the 1980's. If you saw this movie back in the day, enjoyed it, and yearn to relive the experience again, by all means get it and add it to your DVD library. No true blue horror fan should be without this much underrated horror classic in their DVD library.",1333497600,8,4530,4.2827102803738315

Only a film made in this decade could have a demonic Rock icon return from Hell to kill off the local teenagers by shooting lightning bolts from his electric guitar! Marc Price is enjoyable as the outcast lead, while Tony Field's wild looks and outlandish performance make for an entertaining villain. TRICK OR TREAT also plays on many of the controversies surrounding the music scene of the time, touching on censorship, repressive religion, and the unfair media associations between Rock 'N Roll and sex, drugs, and violence. This supernatural revenge flick is sure to please unexpecting fans of 80s Horror!

If you know anything about this movie, you know it ""STARS"" neither Gene nor Ozzy.  And if you bbuy it under the assumption that it is about either of them, you are sorely mistaken.  Oh, they are both in there, and lets ignore that ozzy is pictured larger than gene simmions, as gene actualy has a role, and it is pretty important, whereas ozzy is an amuzing cameo.

No great shakes, and the menue coulda been made at my grandmas house.  Still it's there, at least we have that.

'Trick or Treat' is an obvious product of the suits in Hollywood twidling their thumbs in the board room until one brainiac leaned forward and blurted: ""hey, all the kids are into butt-metal right now... how about a sexually ambiguous butt-metal frontman who returns from the grave to kill... and play the high school PROM!!!!""

Genius.

Yeah, it stars the geek who played 'Skip' from 'Family Ties'... and yes we get eye-rolling cameos by Gene Simmons of KISS and Ozzy Osbourne, but man if this little horror turd isn't an unintentional laugh-a-minute flick set to some awesomely bad heavy metal music.

The film centers around high school outcast Eddie Weinbauer, who just can't seem to fit in with the popular crowd. His hatred for his awkwardness is only outweighed by his hardcore love for everything HEAVY METAL, and in particular, rockin' frontman (and apparent political mouthpiece for the 80's generation) Sammi Curr.

Sammi meets an untimely death in a hotel fire, and Eddie is crushed by the news... until he gets a present from Gene Simmons the day before Halloween.

The KISS bassist (but here playing a local radio DJ) hands over a record of Sammi's unreleased music. Eddie plays it, then the record plays itself (I know, bear with me here), and it turns out the newly barbecued Sammi Curr is using the record to communicate with Eddie to help him become cool.

Wackiness ensues... people die... and best of all, YOU get to laugh as it all unfolds.

I caught this ON DEMAND and my girlfriend and I oddly enough fell in love with its cheesy, 80's feel. The DVD is a piece of arse... one of the worst I've ever come across.

(Halloween, 1986) Hard rock idol Sammi Curr (Fields) burns to death in a hotel fire. His biggest fan, Lakeridge High School student and resident metal head Eddie Weinbauer (Price) is devastated by the news and turns to local radio DJ ""Nuke"" (Simmons) for emotional support. After a heated discussion about the deceased rock star, Nuke presents Eddie with a rare demo record, the last ever recorded by Sammi and the only copy in existence. Overwhelmed by Nuke's generosity, Eddie accepts the gift without hesitation, unaware of it's dark role in things to come. Later, after constant humiliation and a near drowning at the hands of school bully Tim Hainy (Savant) and his sports jock friends, Eddie becomes enraged and vows revenge on all those who have wronged him, much to the dismay of love interest, Leslie (Orgolini) and best friend, Roger (Morgan.) Alone in his room with feelings of rage and retribution racing through his mind, Eddie plays the new record on his stereo and is shocked to discover that he can communicate with the now dead Sammi when it is rotated backwards. Playing upon both Eddie's loyalty and emotional vulnerability, Sammi instructs the teenager on how to get back at those who have caused him so much pain, instructions that the easily manipulated Eddie carries out, prompting eye-opening results. At first it's all fun and games as Hainy and his cohorts get their just desserts, but when Hainy's girlfriend is nearly killed by supernatural forces, Eddie realises that he is nothing more than a pawn in a much more sinister plot and wants out. When Eddie tries to destroy the record an evil version of Sammi is created (complete with supernatural powers) and goes on a rampage at the high school halloween dance, turning Eddie's involvement with the devilish rock star into a spine tingling nightmare not only for the young head banger, but for his school and hometown as well. Can Eddie stop the demonic Sammi before he sends the entire town straight to hell? One thing's for sure, the teenagers of Lakeridge High are in for a Halloween they'll never forget.

348338,4,630165191X,"Go review the soundtrack already...this is for the MOVIE.

I thought this movie was great. I think of it as more of a thriller than a horror movie, because the ""horror"" is slow to get going, and never really picks up. There is no gore or any real scares, it's tame. But I still love this movie, I thought it was really well done.

Here is the basic storyline:

Eddie is a metalhead in high school, in the 80s. He gets tormented a bit. The girl of his dreams doesn't know he's alive.

He just gets on with it, being the stoic thrasher that he is.

But then his favorite rocker, Sammy Curr, dies in a fire. The local rock station DJ (Gene Simmons cameo) gives Eddie a never-released album by Sammy.

Eddie plays the record, and discovers Sammy communicating with him, telling him how to get even. It works at first, and Eddie is happy. But then things start getting out of hand, the people Eddie just wanted to even the score with are getting seriously hurt. Sammy ""comes to life"" and threatens to hurt people that Eddie never wanted to be hurt.

Eddie must find a way to stop Sammy!

If you are a metalhead you will appreciate all the little touches in this movie, like when Eddie's mom goes through his stuff and you see he has Possessed and Exciter records. How true.

There is no sex in the movie, but there is a great scene with a girl by herself if you know what I mean.

Good story and really great direction make this a pleasure to watch, even if it isn't true horror.

It also made me laugh my ass off at certain parts. Like on Halloween night, when Eddie opens the door to let his mom's boyfriend in the house. He is some little wimpy guy with glasses, dressed as Rambo. When Eddie opens the door, the guy is in a Rambo pose and says ""Die, commie pig"". Eddie just turns around and says ""Mom, Stan's here""....I couldn't stop laughing. The part with the girl in the car is hilarious too.

The DVD has no special features, but looks and sounds great.

This movie didn't get five stars only because there wasn't more gore. I don't demand gore or anything, but they never really show the kills in this movie. I don't know if they just didn't have the budget, or if they wanted commercial appeal. The acting is good, aside from Eddie's mother, and Leslie, Eddie's dream girl. Both of them suck at acting, but eveyone else comes out like a champ.

Just so you know, Ozzy is in the movie for about ten seconds. He plays a TV evangelist type, denouncing metal. It's funny to me that Ozzy and Gene Simmons are on the cover of this movie when they are barely in it. But oh well, its a good movie, and it is a must own if you are a metalhead.

Thrash til Death!",1118188800,2,2657,4.254473161033797
348381,4,630165191X,"The music in this movie does have a lasting appeal to anyone whom might have grown up knowing what a metal band was and how some mentally-unadept children reacted to songs by such bands. As for those of us though that appreciated the music for the artistry and show of the music itself, it is one HELL of a ride!

Like any great theme ride, you must have a feature, or in the case of this movie....Three! Ozzy ""The Self-Proclaimed Prince Of Darkness"" Osbourne as a Baptist Preacher protesting the very music which he helped to make famous throughout the world was a total hoot! I laughed until I cried in seeing him ""dolled up"" in such a ludicrous role. Gene Simmons, of KISS fame, as ""Nuke"", an overworked disk-jockey whom befriends the anti-hero in this film was an absolute pleasure (must have been his vacation). Then there was the performance of Tony Fields as the ""Devil Worshipping"" rocker who comes back from the dead to gain revenge on a small town that refuses him a gig at the local High School's Halloween Dance, total hillarity! While the primise of this film are totally ludacrous, the music spells out the time in which this film was made. Poinient and precise is all I can say about the soudtrack which was masterfully performed by the band Fastway!

If one listens to the soundtrack closely one can get the meaning of each and every song! The soundtrack follows in the footsteps of the band W.A.S.P. and thier movement against the ""Washington Wives"" and all of those ""Parental Advisory"" stickers we now see on music and movies today. Censorship in any format is wrong and this ""Horror Parody"" proves as such!",1097020800,,1625,4.638888888888889
348382,4,630165191X,"Ok, let me first say that if you have bought or are planning on buying this DVD because Gene Simmons and Ozzy Osbourne are given top billing on the cover, you will be sorely dissappointed.  Combined, the two get a total of about 5 minutes of screen time.  This movie is about a nerdy metalhead named Eddie (played by Skippy from Family Ties) who worships an over-the-top metal stereotype named Sammi Curr.  Sammi attended the same high school as Eddie does, only about 20 years prior and shortly after the school refuses to allow Sammi to stage a concert there, he dies in a hotel fire.  Eddie is crushed, so as a way to cheer Eddie up, a local DJ (played by Simmons) gives Eddie a test pressing of Sammi's unreleased final album, which the DJ was supposed to play at midnight on Halloween, per Sammi's request.  Eddie soon discovers, though, that Sammi's spirit is communicating through backwards messages on the record.  The spirit offers to help Eddie get revenge on his tormentors at school, including a popular jock (played by the gay guy from Melrose Place) who really has it out for Eddie, and a popular girl who has inexplicably taken a liking to Eddie but whom Eddie believes was trying to make a fool of him.  Eddie agrees to go along with the spirit until he realizes that Sammi doesn't want to just pull pranks on these characters but intends something deadlier for the whole school.

  Anyway, I could go on and on about this Shakespearian-like story, but I think you get the drift.  There is not one scare in this movie, but its pretty funny, although it starts to drag at the end.  Skippy does a good job as Eddie, playing him as a dorky outcast who loves metal rather than a brooding loner, which could have easily been done but would have been the wrong way to go.  As stated earlier, the guy who plays Sammi Curr is pretty over-the-top, but whatever, it hilarious.  I don't know about that Fastway soundtrack, though.  Pretty cheesy, if you ask me.  I can't believe that Fast Eddie left Motorhead to do that junk.  I should mention that Ozzy appears as a Preacher out to censor heavy metal.

This movie is mega-low budget.  (...)  As for my favorite moment, watch for a cameo by the boom microphone when Eddie's mom gets picked up by her boyfriend for their halloween date.  Who says you need to do a retake?",1090454400,,2326,4.516746411483253

I have no idea how seriously the filmmakers intended it to be (the casting implies their tongues were quite firmly lodged in their cheeks), but it hits on, and satirizes, so many themes of its time - the alienation of outsiders, the perceived danger of heavy metal lyrics & backward masking, the fear of satanism - that I have to believe there's some kind of genius at work here.
It's not a perfect flick, by any stretch. It isn't the least bit scary, for one, and it has some awkward dialogue and pacing. But darned if it doesn't hold up as a nifty little satire. Oh, and the scene where the dead metal star seduces the girl through her walkman - that's pretty hot, and pretty much caters directly to the frustrated adolescent male mind. Which only illustrates the point more.

I owned every one she pulled out!  Not to mention the character of Ragman made me feel less alone, and I'm sure many others felt the same. When Sammy Curr says, ""WE . . . WILL BRING YOU DOWN!!"" I still say, ""Hell, yeah!""  This film is glorious fun from beginning to end.  It's more entertaining than any film of its kind, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the movies' representation of the McCarty-esque tactics of the PMRC, and the moralistic intent of the religious right (a hilarious cameo by Ozzy Osbourne), which gets plenty of lip service in the flick.

I remember when it came out, but I only recently saw it. I grew up on the music of Fastway, Dokken, Dio, Ozzy,Maiden, kiss and Priest.

348414,5,630165191X,"Sure the movie is cheesy, but that is part of its charm.  My favourite line has to be when the one chick (I think her name was Genie Wooster) tells Eddie that he is creepy, and when he says he doesn't understand, she replies ""If you weren't so creepy, you would know what I mean"".  The reason why I love this line so much is as follows: It reminds me (and I am sure many others) of stuck up people in high school who had the same attitude.  I can think of one, in particular right now.
So despite the movie's lack of appeal to awards committees, it does have some great moments, and although it does not have mass appeal, I don't think that was its purpose.  It reaches out to the lost children of the world by showing them that they are not alone.
Besides, it is just a fun movie.  Where else will you get to see Ozzy Osbourne preach about the evils of heavy metal music?

I myself was a 16 year old headbanger when this movie came out, so, identifying as I did with our misunderstood heavy metal protagonist, I loved it. And I guess that what's gotten to me this time around, prompting me to get the notably inexpensive DVD. Haven't seen this movie since high school, many moons ago. The one thing I never understood was the soundtrack by Fastway. The movie's villain, Sammi Curr, was supposed to be the blasphemous lord and master of hard core black metal, but like, he was just singing Fastway songs. Fastway was hard rock at best, and an especially harmless hard rock band at that.
The hero, Skippy from Family Ties, is crushed when his hero Sammi Curr dies in a hotel fire. But his dj buddy, Gene Simmons (in his five minute cameo) gives him the one and only copy of Curr's final unreleased album. Skippy learns that if he plays the record backwards, he can conjur his dead hero in ghostly/electric form. (The movie started off reciting lines about Faust, so we can only assume that Curr, by association, made some pact with the devil.) Anyway, at first Curr helps Skippy settle some old scores with the sissy-mary schoolhouse bullies that never give him a moment's rest. But then things begin going a little too far, and Skippy tries to pull the plug---especially after Curr threatens Skippy's highschool dream girl. Curr later shows up at the school Halloween dance, and starts trimming down the student body, singing, stage-cavorting, and shooting blue lightning bolts out of his guitar. Skippy, to save his girl, is forced to fight with his hero. actually, for what it was, the movie was entertaining, and did have some clever parts, but I think mostly people around my age group would appreciate it.
For me, it was strange seeing it again. I remember, as a kid, having a slight crush on Skippy's girlfriend. I remembered her being kinda hot, but my memories from those days are a little addled from excessive doses of, uh...teenage fun. I was pleasantly surprised to see that she was the same beautiful girl I remembered. It's good to know that at least a few things stay the same. Ozzy is plastered on the cover, but, unfortunately, he was only in the movie for about two minutes, playing a televangelist speaking out against heavy metal.

This is shown in several scenes...my personal favorite is in the house when the mother is going out for Halloween (dressed as god only knows what...looked like a whore to me), she leans over to kiss her mentally deranged son on the cheek and, over head, we see in all it's glory, a big red boom mic (set against a white background) enter into the picture like a curious red-headed mouse that is searching for cheese.  Also, the lip-synching at the end by Curr is amazing...only Milli Vanilli could lay claim to such a wonderous accomplishment.  The key to lip synching is to actually have the lip movement match the recorded words...but this editor and director decided to push that old standard aside and felt that the japanese dubbed look would finish off the movie nicely.
I will say that I did laugh my buttocks off at this film...but, then again, it wasn't supposed to be funny.",1052265600,,1512,4.4963503649635035
348418,4,630165191X,"I remember when this film came out in 86, I wanted to see it, but didn't actually see it until it first came out on video. I always liked it better than most 80's horror films. Marc Price does a good job playing a metalhead who is picked on by the other kids. Gene Simmons and Ozzy have small roles. Simmons as a dj and Ozzy as a tv evangelist. Yes, the story is cheesy, but it moves along at a good pace and most of the acting is good. Fastway does the soundtrack and it is the best album they ever did. I saw some reviews criticizing the cover, dvd quality and lack of extras. Anyone who had seen the movie knew Simmons and Ozzy had bit parts and you can tell they are not the stars if you just read the description of the movie on the back of the case. As for the lack of extras and movie quality, well the quality is better than the vhs tape was and I saw a used copy of the vhs tape going for twenty dollars on ebay like a year and a half ago, so I am just glad it is out on dvd at all. You also cannot argue with the price.",1051488000,2,1029,3.8130841121495327
348450,2,630165191X,"There would seem to be a little potential to Trick or Treat. Forget Gene Simmons and Ozzy; no matter how prominently they may be featured on the box, they have very small roles to play in this heavy metal monstrosity of a movie. What we have is Sammi Curr, heavy metal warrior and idol to one Eddie Weinbauer, coming back from the dead to sow vengeance among just about everybody. Unfortunately, this movie goes downhill in a hurry and becomes, by its midpoint, nothing short of ludicrous. Family Ties' Skippy (Marc Price) seems to be taking the whole Nick and Malarie thing pretty hard, as this movie finds him playing a freak who depends on heavy metal music to keep him from ending his miserable life. He idolizes Sammi Curr in particular because Sammi went to his high school and somehow made it to the top of a heap from which he could spit on the likes of Tim and the other cool kids who make Eddie's life so miserable. When Curr dies in a fire, Eddie takes it pretty hard, but then Nuke the local DJ (Gene Simmons) gives him the only copy of Curr's newest record. When Eddie plays the album backwards, Curr begins talking to him personally and starts the poor loser on a course of satisfying revenge against people who do things like grab the towel from around his waist and push him naked into a gym filled with teenaged girls. Curr soon begins to take over, though, appearing whenever his special last album is played, and delights in killing people by shooting blue incineration flames out of his guitar. One of the later scenes is one of the silliest things I have ever seen in my life, and unfortunately the movie does not try to rise above this level of inanity at the very end. The only interesting thing about Trick or Treat is the brief appearance of a clean-cut, actually intelligible Ozzy Osbourne as a preacher decrying the evil of rock and roll music. Trick or Treat is certainly no treat.",1051315200,,1909,4.504322766570605
348451,1,630165191X,"... Im must say, my overall impression with this DVD, was poor. The picure quality was very bad-grainy! This movie is so poorly made! In one scene you actually see the microphone of the sound crew in the picture! Also Ozzy Osbourne isn't a star/main character of this move, he only makes a cameo apperence, on the TV in the movie, as a preacher/evangelist, but even so its only for a minute- thats it! Gene simmons, makes only a brief appearence, as a radio DJ. The DVD box art has Ozzy & Gene on the Cover, as well as there names as the stars/main characters of the movie,which is misleading. Marc Price is the main character, which some may remember as Skippy on the 80's TV show Family Ties. The story plot of the movie is pretty cheesy, and the Fastlane band sounds like Great White- minus the flames. The sounds wasn't to bad for being Dobly 2.0. There are no special features, or Trailer on the DVD. Also the is no booklet or insert with scene number etc. The movie is also only in Fullscreen. Overall Id steer clear of this DVD, unless your a Kiss or Ozzy Collector, then it may be an intresting addition for collection sake. By the way, I was an 80's metalhead, and still am a metalhead! I may actually pawn off this DVD, or sell it, any takers>?",1050019200,2,1254,4.340425531914893

348455,5,630165191X,"Eddie Weinbauer (Marc Price) is your typical teenage high-school ""burn-out"". His appearance, loner attitude, and his love for heavy metal music make him a target of Tim Haney (Doug Savant) and his gang of jocks who unmercifully torment him. Eddie's only real fuel to go on in life is his idol, Sammi Curr, a heavy metal superstar.
Sammi attended Eddie's high school, and was to come home to play a Halloween concert there, but instead, he was banned by the school board, thanks to his suggestive lyrics and stage antics. Unfortunately, Sammi ends up perishing in a hotel fire, which Eddie does not take very well.
Eddie's friend Nuke (Gene Simmons), a local metal station DJ, gives Eddie a special gift to ease his pain: The last recording Sammi Curr made before his death. Nuke made a copy of this to play on the air Halloween night, so he gives Eddie the original.
Eddie takes it home and plays it, and discovers hidden backward messages. Eerie things happen from this moment forth, as Eddie and Sammi get back at Eddies tormentors. Eddie just wanted to teach them a lesson, not seriously hurt anybody. When this happens, Eddie decides to pull the plug on Sammi. This is when Sammi takes matters into his own hands, proclaiming ""No wimps...no false metal"". Very cool.
A hilarious appearance from Ozzy Osbourne is worth watching. This movie is for anybody who loves heavy-metal, and wants a few good laughs, as well as a few scares. The only bummer is the the lack of extras. No production notes, trailers...etc. But the movie itself in digital picture and sound is the real ""treat"".",1043971200,3,1584,4.742753623188406
