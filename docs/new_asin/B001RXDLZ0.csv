3781655,4,B001RXDLZ0,"This has been one of my favorite films of all time.  Yes, it falls into slapstick silliness once in a while, but for a film that is a loving tribute to the beginnings of the movie industry - it doesn't go wrong very often.

I have waited FOREVER for this film to be released on DVD and I hope that they do it justice (widescreen, extras, commentary).

Great movie with an amazing cast.  It's about time it was released on DVD.",1237852800,2,426,4.222222222222222

Just a bunch of guys trying to make some bucks, Nickleodeon aptly portrays the casual way so many of our early films were made and how their makers became aware they were producing Art.  Funny, informative, charming, sometimes sharp, this is a lovely film reflecting Bogdanovich's film historian roots.

3781681,5,B001RXDLZ0,"I was in the film Nickolodeon as an extra ""Indian woman"" in the Chatacawan dance troupe.  They cut out my close up and a few of my 8 scenes from the original shown in the theaters.  I wonder what else they cut in order to cut the time down.

I had alot of fun working on this film.  I worked for three months while meeting many talented, wonderful, and interesting people and a few not so great.  Tatum O'Neal was a joy to work with for me.  We sat at the piano one day and had a nice chat.  Most people treated her like an adult but she was still just a child at heart.  Such a loving little girl.

Burt Reynolds was sick for most of his time here in Oakdale although, made a great impact on the Indian people who worked with him.  He became a man of great respect whether he knew it or not.  He was proud and professional.  The people learned from him.

3781684,4,B001RXDLZ0,"This ""Director's Choice"" from Sony Pictures and Columbia Pictures features two films by Peter Bogdonovich: the Director's Cut his now classic drama ""The Last Picture Show"" from 1971 (which always good to have and which Sal Mineo first brought to his attention as a film property) and also two versions of his 1976 ""Nickelodeon,"" something Bogdonovich was to capitalize on in his rocky career, valentines to other people's films, which even ""Last Picture Show"" shares in.  The two versions are the original theatrical version in color and the new director's cut in black and white, something in the commentary he says he originally hoped the film could be done in.  ""Nickelodeon"" strives to present the early days of silent film-making in the same slapstick that was usually presented in such films with clips from ""Birth of a Nation"" in its obligatory homage to Griffith.  It deserves its black and white transfer.  In ""Nickelodeon"""" Bogdonovich does not leave himself out of the loop of the many directors he presents anecdotes (like Leo McCarey because he was dead remained uncredited unlike then still living directors, Raoul Walsh and Allan Dwan) with taking parts of more successful Bogdonovich hits like ""What's Up, Doc?"" and ""Paper Moon"" and in the commentary laments not being able to use Cybil Shepherd in the main female role opposite the often used Ryan O'Neal and Burt Reynolds (who with Shepherd had starred in the director's previous big flop musical ""At Long Last Love"" which remains unavailable on home video) and also Tatum O'Neal, John Ritter, Stella Stevens and Brian Keith.  An inexperienced actress, Jane Hitchcock played the main female lead and she does it haltingly and only adds to the cardboard, manufactured performances in an endless array of anticipated slapstick that never tells a moral of any kind, either in what was re-added to film for the director's cut that makes more sense of the film as the film has no real life to it.  But it has a great professionalism that is always present in his films, and relegates his failures as a step above many other directors.  In the commentary, Bogdonovich says that his next two films after ""Nickelodeon"":  ""Saint Jack"" and the disastrous ""They All Laughed"" were two of his best, I wonder if he would now take credit for his first in 1968 then as Derek Thomas, ""Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women"" before his triumphant ""debut"" under his own name with his brilliant Hitchcock homage ""Targets"" (also in 1968).",1353110400,,2489,4.952038369304557

Nickelodeon (not to get confused with the television network) is a preety goofy ragtime film that takes you back to an era where silent films were big. I enjoyed it! Found it comical.

3781699,3,B001RXDLZ0,"I primarily purchased this video because I am a huge Stella Stevens fan.  She is such a gifted yet an underrated actress.  Besides being a terrific actress, she is THE SEXIEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD!

The movie is Peter Bogdanovich's tribute to the silent film era.  In his commentary he credits some the scenes in the movie to actual events that occurred to silent movie pioneers.  His commentary provides excellent insight into his scene selection and direction.

The movie centers around the characters starring Ryan O'Neal and Burt Reynolds.  O'Neal plays the director and Reynolds the leading man of the production company.  In the beginning of the film Stella Stevens plays the leading actress until she becomes replaced by a newcomer, Jane Hitchcock.  Before being replaced, Stella is thrown into a horse trough, falls off a moving truck, appears in white face, and black face.  Why Stella Stevens does not have a romantic encounter with either Burt or Ryan is beyond me, however a deleted romance scene involving Stella is explained by Bogdanovich.

The movie was originally shot in color, however the director's cut includes a black and white version that Bogdanovich prefers.  The color version enhances the visual appearance of the film, but I see merit in viewing the film in black and white also.

There are many comedic moments in the film, however my primary reason for viewing the film is because of my favorite actress, Stella Stevens.",1262131200,3,1448,4.983333333333333

It provides a humorous insight into the early days, fraught with rivalries, shady dealings and fly-by-night camera crews. Bogdanovich styles his film in the style of these early films, with black and white cinematography, and whimsical physical comedy bits reminiscent of silent films. The dialogue plays like old Hollywood; rapid-fire and witty.

The Last Picture Show- A classic, coming-of-age story set in Texas in the 50's. Starring a young (and beautiful) Cybill Shepard and Jeff Bridges.",1260835200,,591,5.423913043478261
3781701,1,B001RXDLZ0,"Note: This review only references ""Nickelodeon"".

Any film that casts '70s superstars Burt Reynolds and Ryan O'Neal with sharp character actors like Brian Keith, Stella Stevens and, to a lesser extent, Tatum O'Neal should have been a bonifide bonanza right?  Wrong.  ""Nickelodeon"" is one of the most inept, misguided debacles ever created by a renowned director (in this case, Peter Bogdonavich).  This labored ordeal ostensibly concerns a troup of filmmakers at the dawn of cinema in 1910.  In reality, it's a muddle of clumsy, drawn out slapstick set-pieces and cornball hijinx of the TV variety show type that is poorly directed and ineptly scripted.  Cardboard characters mug and shriek through their repetitive steps without evincing one moment of interest.  And the cast is uniformly dreadful.  Burt Reynolds does his tired ""wink-wink-I'm-laughing-at-myself"" shtick and Tatum O'Neal simply regurgitates her sandpaper-voiced brat from ""Paper Moon"" with diminishing results.  Ryan O'Neal, who's displayed a flair for comedy elsewhere, couldn't be more over-the-top if he were being electrocuted.  Brian Keith and Stella Stevens are utterly wasted in underwritten roles that still manage to irritate.  But then, nobody makes it out alive in this would be yukfest.

Don't be fooled: this is no long lost classic.  It deserved its boxoffice failure in 1976 and it remains a perfect example of a film being substantially less than the sum of its parts.  Walk on by.",1252195200,5,1465,5.3406113537117905
3781702,3,B001RXDLZ0,"Here's a strange pairing: director Peter Bogdanovich's masterpiece The Last Picture Show (1971) and one of his bigger flops, the silent film ode Nickelodeon (1976), starring Burt Reynolds. Even stranger, you get only the director's cut of Last Picture Show (which has only subtle differences, but I wish both were provided) and both the theatrical cut (which is in color) and a director's cut (three minutes longer and in black and white) of Nickelodeon. If you were going to do a boxed set of Bogdanovich, it would clearly contain his three great films in a row: The Last Picture Show, What's Up Doc and Paper Moon. Those are the films on which his reputation rests. (Later works, like Mask, are also worthy.) This double bill makes no sense but if you don't own The Last Picture Show -- and everyone should -- get it immediately. So a five star classic and a one or two star misfire average out to three stars.",1245369600,,912,4.635802469135802
3781703,4,B001RXDLZ0,"Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has double-billed two Peter Bogdanovich films, ""The Last Picture Show"" and ""Nickelodeon,"" both using the magic of movies in its plot.  ""The Last Picture Show"" is a study of life in the small Texas town of Anarene during the 1950's.  Based on a Larry McMurtry novel, it takes place on the eve of the Korean War.  Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) owns the diner, the pool hall, and the Royal Theater, the only forms of recreation in town.  Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges) are co-captains of the local football team.  Johnson and Cloris Leachman both won Supporting Actor Oscars, and the film features many actors who went on to major film careers, including Cybill Shepherd, Ellen Burstyn, and Randy Quaid. The soundtrack is filled with 50's pop music by Tony Bennett, Jo Stafford, Eddie Fisher, Johnny Ray, and Hank Snow.
 ""Nickelodeon"" is about the early days of filmmaking, a topic director/film historian Bogdanovich knows something about.  The plot is slight -- pioneer movie men trying to make a picture against assorted obstacles.  The director uses slapstick, a style common in early comedies, but the movie is too long and fizzles well before the final fade-out.  Burt Reynolds, Ryan O'Neal and Tatum O'Neal star. There are two editions of this film contained -- the original theatrical version in color and a black & white version that Bogdanovich wanted to release.  Extras include commentary by Bogdanovich and a look-back featurette on ""Picture Show.""",1241395200,,1523,5.080321285140562
3781704,5,B001RXDLZ0,"Peter Bogdanovich, one of America's well-known directors, known for major cinema hits such as ""What's up, Doc?"", ""Paper Moon"", ""Nickelodeon"", ""The Last Picture Show"", ""Mask"" and most recently ""Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers: Runnin' Down a Dream"".  Many directorial hits within the last 50 years.  In the 1970's, one film which would garner two Academy Awards and many other cinema awards for its unique story and the other which showcases a time during Hollywood during the silent film era and the end of the Nickelodeon but was not created the way the director intended until now.

""NICKELODEON"" is a 1976 film which would star popular actors Burt Reynolds and Ryan O'Neal together including O'Neal's daughter Tatum (who was the youngest actor to win an Academy Award in 1973) and emerging actor at the time, John Ritter.

The film took place during the 1910's when people were enlightened by silent films, especially plays and so forth.  But during the time when Patent Offices and Hollywood were quite literally against Independent films.  Most films were created by the major studios and those that weren't, had tough times as these Patent Offices literally hired gunmen to shoot down the cameras and destroy them.

So, Leo Harrigan (O'Neal) who is a lawyer and then a writer, gets picked by a film crew to be a director for a film. With the help of cameraman Franklin Frank (John Ritter), the crew tries to get an Independent silent film created.  But there are quite a few setbacks as the film has trouble being shot, having the right talent and most of all because Harrigan is a first time director, they depend on a young 10-year-old named Alice Forsyte (Tatum O'Neal) to assist in writing the screenplay.

Things start to change for the film, when Buck Greenway arrives (Burt Reynolds), he tries to shoot down the cameras but the crew, prepared for the Patents Office shoot back and a fight ensues between Harrigan and Greenway.  Greenway eventually gets hired to become the lead actor and starts to get close to the starlet of the film Kathleen Cooke (Jane Hitchock) but Harrigan also has feelings for the starlet as well.

The main premise of the film is how things were in Hollywood back in 1910 and the goal for Independent filmmakers who strived hard to bring their films to a Nickelodeon and attract viewers who appreciate the film.  Unfortunately, back then in silent films, producers would cut (steal) segments from various films to create another film and this goes the case for Harrigan's film who, along with his crew, are disgusted with what is shown at the Nickelodeon.  This was not the final film that they all have worked on.

So, the film is about the trials and tribulations of the Indie filmmaker and their crews of trying to create a quality silent film but instead of cramped rooms, to become a moneymaking machine and in the end, an Independent film manages to succeed and change the face of American cinema.

The film known as ""The Clansman"" had its titled changed to ""The Birth of a Nation"" directed by D.W. Griffith would become the most profitable film at that time and would reign the top box office winner for over 20 years.  The controversial film would be the synergy that sparked the life of feature full-length films (more than 60 minutes in length) and showing how these films could generate millions.

So, ""NICKELODEON"" is Director Peter Bogdanovich's ode to filmmaking of that time but also what would be the beginning of feature full length films.  The problem with the film is that what Bogdanovich had envisioned, the studio went against that vision.  Bogdanovich wanted to cast John Ritter and Jeff Bridges but the studio was against the hiring of unknowns, thus Burt Reynolds and Ryan O'Neal were hired.  The most important thing that Bogdanovich wanted was wanting the film in B&W since it was about that era of silent filmmaking.  But the studio was against that and thus shot in color.  So, the film wasn't as effective and unfortunately, the film did OK, not great in the box office.

Without spoiling the film, ""THE LAST PICTURE SHOW"" is a believable film about teenage life in a small Texas town.  Young teenagers drinking, having sex, people having affairs and characters that are not perfect.  These characters are teenagers and adults that have their flaws and during a time where people are trying to discover themselves but doing things that are exploitative in nature that hurts others.

But what works is that the talent portraying these characters seem real and genuine and its their wonderful performance, great direction and capturing that heart of the original novel which helps makes this film so special.

VIDEO & AUDIO:
""NICKELODEON"" looks much gorgeous in black and white.  The color version of the film really didn't do anything for me.  If it's going to be a period piece about the time of silent films, then this new Director's Choice gives us the true version of what Peter Bogdanovich truly wanted.

""THE LAST PICTURE SHOW"" is black and white and definitely got the treatment that Bogdanovich wanted (thanks to his communication with Orson Welles).

Both films look great but ""NICKELODEON"" utilizing the most recent transfer to B&W and ""THE LAST PICTURE SHOW"" utilizing the same transfer as the last DVD release adding new footage (done in the late 90's).

As for audio, both films are in mono.  Dialogue is quite clean and easily understood.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

NICKELODEON

On the first disc for ""NICKELODEON"", you can watch the film in its original color theatrical presentation or it's B&W Director's cut.  In the Director's commentary for the Director's Cut, the commentary by Director Peter Bogdanovich.  Bogdanovich is blunt and to the point.  Immediately talking about what he wanted for the film but the studio was against it.  How he wished Cybill Shepherd took the main actress role because it would have made a better film.  But most of all talking about the people who influenced this film for him and his impressions of the talent behind the film.  The film does showcase ""Birth of a Nation"" and Bogdanovich addresses why it was used and also discusses how things were for that era.  It was a different time and the director definitely goes into that in the commentary.

THE LAST PICTURE SHOW

This second disc features the ""THE LAST PICTURE SHOW"" and there are five special features included.

  * COMMENTARY - For this film, Director Peter Bogdanovich agrees that he was not easy to work with and how the crew disliked him.  His goal was to make sure the talent's performances were real and believable and wanted things to be run his way and not Hollywood's way.  Bogdanovich also discussed how Orson Welles was a big support for him in requesting for the film to be shot in black and white.  Very good technical commentary on how certain scenes were shot and overall direction.  Very informative commentary by Director Peter Bogdanovich.
  * A DISCUSSION WITH FILMMAKER PETER BOGDANOVICH - (12:52) Interviews with Director Peter Bogdanovich and how became a director, his thoughts about ""THE LAST PICTURE SHOW"" now.  Also, other comments on his feelings about positive and negative reviews towards his films and how the film doesn't seem dated but how it became an iconic film for him (not his favorite though).
  * THE LAST PICTURE SHOW: A LOOK BACK - (1:04:37) A newer featurette of ""THE LAST PICTURE SHOW"" featuring interviews with Director Peter Bogdanovich, writer Frank Marshall, Cybill Shepherd, Jeff Bridges, Ellyn Burstyn, Eileen Brennan and Cloris Leachman.  An awesome featurette as Bogdanovich and talent talked about their experiences on being part of the film.  Behind-the-scenes information from the talent about Bogdanovich casting them to his attitude during filming and more.  A lot of informative commentary how nerveracking the sex scene between Timothy Bottoms and Leachman, Cybill Shepherd having to strip down her clothes, how Timothy Bottoms younger brother Sam was cast for the film, how Ben Johnson took some major prodding to be part of the film and more.  Also, learning a little about the relationship at the time between Bogdanovich and Shepherd.  Also, learning how the town that the film is based on really despised the film (because hidden skeletons were now made public) but it was a true depiction of the small town.
  * THEATRICAL RE-RELEASE FEATURETTE - (6:04) The original featurette by Director Peter Bogdanovich talking about ""THE LAST PICTURE SHOW"".  Shot in the early 70's.  Bogdanovich talks about the many talent working on the film and how they were cast.
  * ORIGINAL THEATRICAL TRAILER - (3:06) the Original B/W trailer.

Director Peter Bogdanovich is just an fascinating director and each time I could hear his commentaries and about his filmmaking, it's something that I've always found enjoyable but also educational.

With the release of ""NICKELODEON"" and ""THE LAST PICTURE SHOW"" in a Director's Choice two DVD set, I feel that it's just great that Sony Pictures Home Entertainment is giving him the opportunity to fix a film that Bogdanovich felt was not the way he wanted but with today's technology, giving both films the final treatment.

With ""NICKELODEON"", the film was given a new life in it's Director's Cut incarnation because the director wanted to capture the feeling of the silent film era and by making the film B&W, because the way the film was shot and capturing that era, the B&W version works!

Unfortunately, the storyline is just all over the place and if anything, it relies a lot on the individual talent's performances.  John Ritter and Tatum O'Neal were just wonderful.  Burt Reynolds was just the emerging star of the 1970's and Ryan O'Neal already won hearts with his performances in ""Love Story"", ""What's Up, Doc?"" and ""Paper Moon"".

The film was at best average and humorous but nothing that help capture my attention.  I did like Bogdanovich focusing on that era of silent filmmaking because not many people would know about the challenges that independent filmmakers had to face.  The film also showcases a film that help jumpstart the feature film era but showcases a controversial film that captured the attention of viewers at that time period but now would just seem so politically incorrect to watch.

Director Bogdanovich does his best to let people know in the commentary that he was capturing America then.  And thus, I feel that with the director's cut, it made the film much more enjoyable.  After watching it in black and white, watching its original color theatrical cut is just too difficult.  It loses any realism of capturing that era and I'm glad that ""NICKELODEON"" has both version included on the DVD.

As for ""THE LAST PICTURE SHOW"", there is so much that can be said about this film.

I absolute adored this film when I first watched it's first DVD release and watching it today and hearing all the information that went in creating this film, especially from the talent is really special.

What I was amazed about the film was how well the talent portrayed their characters and the emotion that went into creating this real, normal atmosphere of living in a small town.

Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) is a teenager who has a tough time at home (his mother is hardly seen) but is a kind, nice guy who cares about his friends which include Billie (Sam Bottoms), a mute kid that the other teens take advantage of.  He is at the age where he wants sex but his girlfriend doesn't want to give it up until marriage that he ends up going for the coaches wife, who seems to have her own problems.

Jacy (Cybill Shepherd) is the popular teenager raised by her mother Lois (Ellen Burstyn) who likes to have fun but doesn't cross the line.  Jacy who has a good relationship with Duane (Jeff Bridges) gets tempted by peer pressure and becomes promiscuous and when she doesn't have sex with her boyfriend, she goes elsewhere and ends up having sex with Abilene (Clu Gulager) who has dated her mother.

Cloris Leachman was just incredible as a woman going through an emotional time, knowing her husband is interested in other things than her and that in order to get love, she has to be with a teenager (who is having fun with girls his age) and thus enhancing her personal issues onscreen.  Cloris Leachman's character Ruth Popper goes through emotional highs and lows that I'm so happy it earned her an Oscar.

This film just had so many things going for it.  Shot in B&W, no musical score, the film came down to the performances and each of the talent nailed it.

Bogdanovich really went to the extremes in capturing that authentic performance and really wanting the people to be that character they were portraying and he accomplished that, unfortunately to the dismay of his own crew by ignoring them but he stuck with his gut and in the end, the film earned two Academy Awards forBen Johnson and Cloris Leachman and many more awards for the film.

Just to note that ""THE LAST PICTURE SHOW"" is the newer version (edited in the late 90's) which includes additional scenes not from the original theatrical cut.

All in all, both ""NICKELODEON"" and ""THE LAST PICTURE SHOW"" get very good treatment with this ""DIRECTOR'S CHOICE"" release.  For both films, the Director's Cut definitely made things much better.  Especially for ""NICKELODEON"" which made a not so good film much more enjoyable and ""THE LAST PICTURE SHOW"" much better with the commentary and the addition of the special features capturing the behind-the-scenes and experiences from those involved in the filming process.

If anything, this release is a celebration for Bogdanovich's work and I can only hope they do the same with ""What's Up, Doc?"" and ""Paper Moon"".  If you are a big fan of either of these films or the work of Director Peter Bogdanovich, this release is definitely, highly recommended!",1240272000,21,13839,4.874732791791364

* It collects Bogdanovich's two best films.
* He delivers a smart, entertaining commentary for each film.
* Though LPS includes the same extras found on the previous DVD release, this edition adds a commentary.  I suspect this is the same one on the out-of-print laser disc.
* Nickelodeon is presented in two versions: the original colour one, and the slightly longer one in beautiful black-and-white.  Guess which is better?
* Both discs are dual-layered to preserve the quality of picture and sound.

I don't know how I missed the colorized version on this DVD. A reviewer mentioned it was in black and white and in color too. Suddenly I put it back on and the colorized version came on the screen. I take back all the bad remarks I made, with the exception that the colorized version made it well worth while watching it. There is more depth to the picture and too bad I missed any publicity on this one. Buy it. The Last Picture Show, restored, is also on it. BUY IT ON AMAZON.",1415664000,,760,4.277777777777778
