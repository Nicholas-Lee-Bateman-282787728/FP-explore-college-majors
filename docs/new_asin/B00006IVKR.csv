7969758,2,B00006IVKR,"Hi, I'm a yoga fan, and Dona Holleman is a lesser known teacher and garden variety mystic.  This is a very short film--maybe 25 minutes, and you get some images of Dona doing the postures and giving us some background and hiking with her girlfriends and going into a cowboy bar--I came away not really knowing why she teaches and practices yoga, except as a profession, but she does aim at some kind of mystic link with the ""universe"".  It was okay but I wouldn't buy it again--and Netflix doesn't carry it.  I should add that Dona is a hell of a yogini and studied with then  young Iyengar whom she describes as a kind of ""fierce Brahmin"" or something.  Holleman is a dedicated and thorough-going proponent of Iyengar yoga--I just thought this particular DVD was a little sketchy.",1217462400,,781,4.589928057553957
7969759,5,B00006IVKR,"After watching this film I was struck by the timeliness of Dona's message. She says we cannot look for saviors and that we must take self responsibility for the kind of life environment we create.  This reminds me of a quote by Mirabei, ""If we could reach the Lord through immersion in water, I would have asked to be born a fish in this life.""
Dona also points out that it is in time of stress that people begin to question old values.  When will the people of the world, to paraphrase the quote from ""Eleventh Hour"", begin to understand that our values are not possessions but we are like the fish who do not possess the water they swim in-it supports their life!",1049328000,5,665,4.354838709677419
