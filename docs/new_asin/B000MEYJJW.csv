2728834,5,B000MEYJJW,"These movies are GREAT!!! As a young girl I watched these same movies as tv specials, and then later on vhs. These stories are sweet, wholesome, and timeless. I am thrilled that now I can share these same movies with my little ones.",1176422400,11,232,4.4186046511627906
2728835,5,B000MEYJJW,The is the real authentic original Strawberry Shortcake (SS) cartoon that was made in the 1980's. The Strawberry Shortcake 2000 year cartoons where she is wearing a straw hat and jeans is a joke...they should not even be allowed to call it Strawberry Shortcake- what an insult. It is a whole nother cartoon and characters it should be called something else and not associtated with such a classic as the true 80's Strawberry Shortcake classic cartoon. Growing up on SS I am thrilled the real deal on finally on dvd for the new generation to enjoy and appriciate. I hate those fake foney SS re-make new adventure millinium garbage. Buy the classic ones! All you 80's babies and Parnets of 80's babies know what I'm talking about.,1175731200,14,728,4.74015748031496
2728836,5,B000MEYJJW,"I couldn't believe it when this dvd came out!!  I was a 1980's Strawberry Shortcake fan when I was a kid.  I bought the dvd for me, really to reminisce but to my surprise, as the animation is obviously dated, my 2 year old daughter loves it!!  It is just cute, very basic but I think little girls will enjoy it.  My daughter isn't one to sit through a show longer than 30 mins (if im lucky!!) but she will watch this from beginning to end!!",1175299200,27,440,4.0813953488372094
2728837,1,B000MEYJJW,I was very dissappointed with this movie.  The animation was stone-age and it had characters in it that have not been introduced to this new generation of Strawberry Shortcake lovers.  If I had know what I was purchasing I never would have spent the money.,1175299200,,256,4.666666666666667
2728838,4,B000MEYJJW,"Currently seen on TV and in a series of DVD releases, Strawberry and her friends actually got their start in a series of specials in the 80s. Now, with this DVD, two of these are available for everyone to view --- ""The World of Strawberry Shortcake"" and ""Strawberry Shortcake in Big Apple City."" In the first, Strawberry and her friends face the Peculiar Purple Pie Man, who is out to steal the berries from Strawberry Land with the help of his berry birds. In the second, Pie Man is at it again. He and Strawberry are finalists in a baking contest, and he's determined to win, no matter what sorts of dirty tactics he has to resort to.

This show feels very 80s, definitely, but suits its time. The characters are reasonably cute, the plot holds up well enough and there are some fairly decent songs included.

This DVD contains decent story content, but is generally a straight, no-frills port. There are no close-captions, subtitles and no special features other than previews for other releases from the company that put this out (Allumination) and a bonus cartoon that may or may not interest you or your kids --- ""Snow White and the Magic Mirror.""

If you have fond memories of this old 80s cartoon, then this is definitely worth a look. It's also probably worth a lot for those that are fans of the current version of the program and want to see the origins of the series. Just don't expect anything great when it comes to production values.",1173744000,12,1448,4.583011583011583
2728839,4,B000MEYJJW,I gave the rating that I did because of the smile on my kid's face and the speed in which it took to arrive.  Based on that I would recommend it to others.,1400630400,,155,3.696969696969697

2728843,5,B000MEYJJW,"This DVD is truly wonderful!  It features the first two Strawberry Shortcake specials from the 1980s (""The World of Strawberry Shortcake,"" and ""Strawberry Shortcake in Big Apple City""), both of them sweet and wise and delightful, and both written by the great Romeo Muller himself.  What makes him great?  Well, this hugely talented and kindly storyteller also wrote the classic Rankin/Bass (and other) animated specials ""Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" ""Frosty the Snowman,"" ""The Little Drummer Boy,"" ""Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town,"" ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year,"" ""Here Comes Peter Cottontail,"" the three ""Puff the Magic Dragon"" films, and many others. If you do a Google search on ""The Enchanted World of Rankin/Bass,"" you will find the link for the Rankin/Bass (rankinbass) website. Once there, go to the ""Spotlight"" section to find the story of Romeo Muller's life, and also my filmography of his magical, wise, loving, and superbly imaginative works.--George Zadorozny, zorrolawyer@yahoo.com.",1375660800,,997,5.546052631578948

2728849,1,B000MEYJJW,"I was so excited when this came out. It brought back many memories from my childhood. Strawberry Shortcake was my favorite!!! When I received it, it was completely ruined and damaged. It was scratched beyond repair. Sadly we did not get to enjoy it. I am going to take another chance and try to order it again.",1361232000,,310,4.456140350877193

2728851,5,B000MEYJJW,My kids and I love this DVD. I'm only sad that there aren't more episodes on it. There's only the first episode and then Big Apple City. I can't wait for the whole series to come out on  DVD.,1353110400,,191,3.8974358974358974
2728852,5,B000MEYJJW,"Now, if only I could find the Strawberry Shortcake's Housewarming Surprise on DVD, I'd be set.  I loved these two specials when I was a kid, but the Housewarming Surprise was my favorite.
Video quality is good, not great.  For the walk down memory lane, it's worth the price to me.",1343952000,,281,4.490196078431373
2728853,5,B000MEYJJW,"I just got done watching this for the first time since I was a little girl! It's just as great as I remember it being. I didn't remember much of the first episode (The World of Strawberry Shortcake) but the second one (Strawberry Shortcake in Big Apple City) came back very vividly in my memory.

Out of all of the wonderful 80's cartoons, Strawberry Shortcake tops the list, well...along with The Care Bears ;-)

If you loved the show as a child do not hesitate to buy this DVD! Even if you didn't love it back then, it's still worth watching today. The new Strawberry Shortcake can't compare to the original.",1342224000,,610,4.486486486486487
2728854,5,B000MEYJJW,I think I was more excited to have this movie for myself than I was for my 6 yr old daughter! Nothing is better than the classics.. I was thrilled to see it on DVD.. good quality and quick shipping :),1332374400,,200,3.902439024390244
2728855,5,B000MEYJJW,I grew up watching Strawberry Shortcake and had been looking for the original cartoons.  The new Strawberry Shortcake cartoons are disappointing... I missed the Peculiar Purple Pie Man of Porcupine Peak.  I'm thrilled that I could find him again on this DVD of my favorite childhood cartoon.,1330905600,,291,5.170212765957447
2728856,5,B000MEYJJW,"I absolutely love this video, great quality. I bought this because I love the vintage strawberry shortcake, I despise the new strawberry shortcake they should have never changed this. I listen to this video at least 2 times a week.",1302134400,2,231,4.8
2728857,4,B000MEYJJW,"I've always been a fan of Strawberry shortcake from 1980s classic to they modern 2010 one on The Hub. The biggest let down with this DVD is no Miss Sour Grapes who I guess was added to the on going TV series but not made by these two special done by the creators of the classic holiday specials like Rudolph and Frosty. I also found myself a little bit at a lost when seeing this classic after so long as the characters appearances and personalities have changed so much between 1980s, 2004 and 2010 versions. In fact I'm pretty sure this version has much more characters than either of the two more modern versions created.  This classic has The Purple Pie man at his berry best form. Lemon I was most taken with when it comes to character differences as being introduced in Big Apple City she's a would be actress rather than the brat she was in 2004 or the salon keeper in 2010.  It does also seem to be that the modern series on The Hub has made some attempt to honor this classic series with their Itsy Bitsy Adventures as Snail Mail and Butterfly planes in the 1980s classics are replaced by other bug friends in 2010 as well as the characters size and world they live in. The first story on this DVD deals with Strawberry thinking her friends don't like her any more when really their planning a surprise birthday. Only the Purple Pie Man's gift isn't the type you would want to give anyone. Then Strawberry compete against the Purple Pie Man in Big Apple City baking contest and make a whole lot of new friends as the Pie Man try to keep her away from the station.",1300924800,,1572,4.343537414965986
2728858,5,B000MEYJJW,I LOVE this dvd for myself and my two year old daughter! I remember watching this episode on tv when I was a child. It comes with two short episodes. It's awesome! A must buy!,1298160000,,175,4.0285714285714285
2728859,5,B000MEYJJW,"After introducing SSC to my 23 month old daughter, she prefers the original SSC cartoon over the new ones.  The video quality could be better, but I hope they make more of the old classic SSC dvd's.",1292716800,,198,4.351351351351352
2728860,5,B000MEYJJW,I loved this on tape as a kid and now my kids are loving it on DVD.  Even my 6 yr old son cracks up at the purple pie man!!!,1292198400,,124,3.1333333333333333
2728861,1,B000MEYJJW,"I was so excited to see this classic on DVD. I totally remember these episodes from my kindergarten days. Oddly enough I got The World of Strawberry Shortcake on audio cassette tape for Easter when it first came out, and my friend had the one in Big Apple City on audio cassette. It is funny they released the audios of the movies...kind of hard to follow if you can't see what is going on. In 3rd grade I was still hog-wild about SSC and I was elated when my school (which was a private school) showed the movie version of The World of SSC. It was neat to see what was going on due to sound effects and see that the Pieman not only had a funny chant but a funny dance and that that funny whizzing noise I heard on the cassette was a lady bug, and that crash bang boom was Shortcake's army of marching trees tearing down the Pieman's Pietin Palace, which was made of pots and pans, for example--it made so much more sense to see what was going on. It is funny that they released it on audio in the first place but I must say I played my cassette almost to death and drove my family almost nuts playing it over and over in the car on our long trips! Ah, the memories. What I don't think I will EVER understand is WHY, oh WHY, didn't Strawberry ever get her own syndicated TV show?!? She certainly was popular enough. She was just used as a TV special or to fill-in for extra time, etc. The Care Bears got their's, so did Glo Friends, My Little Ponies, Rainbow Brite...even Lady Lovelilocks and the Pixie Tails, and they NEVER caught on like the other characters!
  I originally would give this 5 stars but I have to give it 1, sorry to say, due to the fact that they did a hatchet job on the DVD version. I have listened to the World of SSC soundtrack enough times to realize they have cut out a lot of the dialogue as well as a very cute song (""Sunflower Market""). HOW COULD THEY DO THIS??? They should have left her totally alone and included 2 discs if they couldn't fit both movies on one disc, they should put each unadulterated movie onto one disc into one package--they could have done that!! I am berry berry upset!!",1290643200,16,2123,4.2137592137592135

2728866,2,B000MEYJJW,"I bought this for $13.00 and it only has 2 episodes on it.  It's not worth the price.  I was expecting more episodes than 2.  I would not recommend buying this.  On the small upside, they are from the original episodes.",1246665600,,219,4.2682926829268295
2728867,4,B000MEYJJW,i grew up on this show. And now at 27 I purchased it pretty much just to stroll down memory lane. Just as cute as i remember.

2728868,5,B000MEYJJW,"I am so excited to have this movie.  My 3 year old daughter loves this one better than the newer ones.  We purchased two of the newer movies when she was born and she loved them.  Then my husband found this when he was searching for a birthday gift for her.  And it is now her favorite as well as mine!  She will come up to me and say ""let watch the strawberry shortcake from when you were my age"".  How cute is that!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie.  The voices of the characters sound more playful and fun than the newer ones.  Don't get me wrong I still love the new series but nothing beets the original!  I hope they come out with more of the original episodes.",1221955200,2,663,4.030769230769231
2728869,5,B000MEYJJW,My two year old daughter loves this DVD! We also have the recent movie on DVD that is all computer graphics and she doesn't watch that one. In the original cartoon the characters are drawn old school and I love it! The songs are sweet and catchy. The voice of the old man sun is perfect too. My daughter was deeply concerned for the 'berry folk' when a watering can was jinxed but after several viewings she looked forward to anticipating the event. Now she imitates the little dance and song of The Peculiar Purple Pie-Man of Porcupine Peak!,1204761600,3,542,4.484848484848484
2728870,5,B000MEYJJW,I grew up with the original Strawberry Shortcake.  When she became popular again I was excited that my daughter would be able to grow up with her also.

Now my daughter and I can enjoy them together!,1204761600,6,356,4.430769230769231

2728875,5,B000MEYJJW,"I loved the 80's Strawberry Shortcake. I love their costumes so much more than the ones today, and I think Russi Taylor IS Strawberry Shortcake! What a cute voice.
When my daughter was born, I collected many vintage dolls and toys for her from that Kenner collection of the 80's (including dolls from Brazil; my favorite being Little Coffee) and she strongly prefers the vintage stuff to the new stuff. Her number one favorite is Plum Puddin' (as a girl). The new stuff is okay, but like My Little Pony, its very different in its modern incarnation. The original cartoons had two adversaries; the Peculair Purple Pieman of Porcupine Peak and Sour Grapes. The new stuff didn't feature these fabulous villians at first, but added them later in a sort of role reversal with Sour Grapes being timid and softer and PPPM being hard and evil. I still like the old versions of them better.

Personally, we are waiting for the Berrykins episode and the House Warming episodes of the the 80's series to be released on DVD. I wish they'd just package them as one collection. At any rate, I had a bad bootleg copy on VHS tape and it was so poor, some of it was just ""snow"" on the screen. I'm so glad they finally are putting these out. If you love SSC or have a young child, these episodes are worth adding to the collection. In the end, they're all about being good and helping others.",1189209600,30,1374,4.496
2728876,4,B000MEYJJW,"My almost 3-year old likes Strawberry Shortcake and when she wanted us to buy her some movies she asked for Strawberry Shortcake.  While looking through the choices my wife suggested to get this one.  I thought because it was the original she would not like it because of the graphics back then, not as crisp, the language is not as toned down as today - I find that most of the cartoons growing up had language more for an adult to understand.  So we bought 2 videos this one and another of the new version.

She absolutely adores this version and prefers to watch it over the newer ones.  She likes to sing along with the characters in their entertaining songs, and she likes to point out that Pie Man is a bad man.

I have to admit that even I find this version more enjoyable.  The graphics are old, the soundtrack is old, but the fun is fresh each and every time we watch it.",1185148800,6,880,4.265060240963855
