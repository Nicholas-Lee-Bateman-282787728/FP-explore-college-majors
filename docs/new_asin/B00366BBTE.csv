4073054,3,B00366BBTE,"I was really excited for the movie because I'd seen its commercials and love some of the actors in the movie; however, I feel that the plot and characterization were left undeveloped.  Also, the movie made me uncomfortable at times.

The service, however, was wonderful. I received the movie in mint condition before I had expected it.",1341792000,,335,4.859649122807017
4073055,5,B00366BBTE,"To Be Fat Like Me is based on a true story about a student who enrolls in a high school ""undercover"" with an agenda. She believes that overweight people use obesity as an excuse for failure. Her journalism project is to enter that school in a very convincing fat suit, and prove that her own personality and drive will bring her the popularity and success that she is accustomed to as her thin, sports-playing self.

Of course, reality takes her down a peg or two when she realizes that the other students not only deprive her of that chance for popularity and success, but are overtly hostile and insulting.

On the surface, this plot seems too obvious and simple. However, the tale is told with great skill and just enough subtelty to make the suffering hit home in a very real way.

To Be Fat Like Me is a DVD that belongs in every school and public library. This is a story that needs to be told.",1288137600,23,900,4.377245508982036
4073056,4,B00366BBTE,This movie is very enjoyable and handles the topic of adolescent obesity and eating disorders very tactfully. Could be shown in high school health classes.,1279756800,12,155,5.24
4073067,2,B00366BBTE,I only use the star system when rating movies and books.,1433203200,,56,4.181818181818182
4073068,3,B00366BBTE,I thought at first it would be a bit different but I've seen enough prank show since I was back in my country. This is not new. Its very common.,1430092800,,144,3.8333333333333335
4073069,5,B00366BBTE,Kaley is my favorite actress. Loved the movie.,1429142400,,46,4.875
4073070,1,B00366BBTE,typical lifetime concept but poorly performed,1428883200,,45,6.666666666666667
4073071,4,B00366BBTE,"A worthwhile watch. Sure, it's only TV-movie quality, and I'm not a big Cuoco fan, but she gives convincing performances as the two Alis. The woman who plays Ramona is absolutely lovely. And Caroline Rhea is great as the average (but not unattractive) mother. I was hoping for a different romantic outcome, but that's okay. :)

What I appreciate most about this movie is that it depicts Ali as someone who works hard to keep fit; she's not one of those women who eats everything in sight, doesn't exercise, and still maintains a size-2 figure. No matter what we want to believe, most of us have to work hard to stay extremely slim, especially when we have genes that could very easily have us expanding. Some of us aren't willing to work that hard, or honestly don't have time (This is often an excuse, but it's sometimes true), or have physical conditions that preclude intense workouts. And that's okay. Controlling food intake is very difficult for some people (me included). And that's okay.

It's really about what you want for yourself, not what others want. Personally, this movie inspired me to try a little harder with my nutrition and exercise habits, but NOT because I saw how horrible it is to be fat. Just because I realized that I'm really not trying at all. I don't want to be a 2 or even a 4. I just want to feel like I'm at the right weight for me--which is less than what I weigh now, but way more than what a career in Hollywood would require.",1418256000,,1462,4.492481203007519
4073072,5,B00366BBTE,"I purchased this moive because of Kaley Cuoco.  It arrived promptly and as promised, in excellent condition.  I'd highly recommend this DVD.",1417219200,,140,5.318181818181818
4073073,4,B00366BBTE,"Arrived within the estimated time frame.  The DVD disc was loose in box, but I can not see any scratches on it.  Have not watched it yet since it only arrived yesterday, but I hope there won't be any faults with the disc.",1408924800,,221,4.116279069767442
4073074,5,B00366BBTE,I loved this movie.  I think it makes you think about being so judgmental about people you do not know.,1401926400,,103,4.15
4073075,4,B00366BBTE,"Good show, kinda sad. I think if more people did the exspearment it would help cut down on bullying. I myself have never been overweight but many people in my family are. Ive never made fun of them because to me its not funny at all because I worry about their health n self esteem. And when I was in school I felt so bad for overweight kids. I didn't see them get picked on a lot but just wondering how they felt about themselves. All I can say is im sure if youve never been overweight we probably cant relate but we can help by supporting them in being the petson that they want to be. And to any bulleys out there...SHAME on u!!!",1394755200,4,633,4.072
4073076,5,B00366BBTE,"I could totally relate to this lifetime movie. I used to be really overweight. I used to be 280 pounds in the year 2009, but I got down to 150 pounds. However, I gained some of the weight I lost back, and I'm trying to lose it again.",1394582400,,233,3.875
4073087,3,B00366BBTE,"This is a movie about a thin, popular girl who is genuinely nice. She does a project to win a scholarship to college about how society treats overweight people. She goes in with one premise and comes out with another. The 'fat suit' that she wears is quite elaborate and authentic-looking, but there is one scene where she removes the fat suit and there are prostectic arms and feet that are just not believable. If they had just not shown that particular scene... it would have been better!

This is probably better for an audience of younger people -- perhaps pre-teens. It might help with the bullying that is now so rampant.",1391644800,,628,4.607142857142857
4073088,5,B00366BBTE,"If it's said that the movie makes fun of fat people, that is not true. It's trying to make others more understanding. If you are one it makes you want to set  time away to work on it, don't try to do it all in one day, you can't nobody can. So eat right and take your time",1383091200,,272,3.689655172413793
4073089,4,B00366BBTE,It is a cute movie which I viewed on Lifetime movie channel when it was on and liked the story and I bought it.. Like Kaley Cuoco.. She plays a good part..,1382918400,,155,3.875
4073090,5,B00366BBTE,"Aly Schmidt is the stereotypical pretty, popular, and snooty blonde athlete who is used to being treated, well, like royalty because of her good looks. Because she knows this, her nose is in the air to anybody who isn't in her box of what a person should be physically. If she thought being fat was miserable and unbearable, then she would kill herself if she was black and overweight. One thing, Aly's mom should've checked Alyson at the door with her disrespectful attitude. Yes, her mother is overweight and her hospital bills were insurmountable and her daughter had to work at something instead of having it given to her, but her mother provided her a safe home and nurturing love that she didn't have for herself. It's not easy to love yourself but so easy to love those who don't love you.....",1382659200,,800,4.640845070422535
4073091,5,B00366BBTE,this movie is great everybody should watch it I watched it with my family its good movie for family  also luv the actors n actresses,1364860800,,132,4.28
4073092,5,B00366BBTE,I watched this movie three times. It was very interesting and like a documentary. It was educational and entertaining. I learned a lot from watching this.,1361750400,,154,4.961538461538462
4073093,4,B00366BBTE,"Terrific movie about an experiment that works in more ways than one. A gorgeous girl who always has things going her way loses an athletic scholarship to college when she gets injures-and that was the only way she could pay. To earn the money, she enters a contest where she disguises herself as a fat girl and goes undercover at another school. She soon learns how cruel people can be to severely obese people-especially in high school. Fans of The Big Bang Theory will love seeing Kaley Cuoco (Penny) in this. Limited amount of DVD extras.",1359936000,5,541,4.645833333333333
4073094,4,B00366BBTE,"Although this film is a tough watch, it's pretty honest about how some people are treated very differently when presented in a less than perfect package. We all are unique and one of a kind, but sometimes our differences become stumbling blocks when we meet less than tolerant people. Some of the best people in the world are oftentimes overlooked, shunned, or mistreated because of how they look. Nobody makes the rules so to speak, but peers usually dictate what is accepted or popular at any given time. Many times I have wondered how different the world would be if we were viewed from the inside out. Our differences make us unique, not less than what we should be.
While this film is not too easy to watch at times, it should be viewed by students in this day and time of bullying and separation. Certainly a good study on what might be if we take the time to see that differences can influence our relationships in a great way if we let them.",1358294400,6,949,4.459770114942529
4073095,5,B00366BBTE,"This movie teaches you not to judge anybody by its cover, which alot of people and even myself i do. Its not always about how you look outside but how indredible a person can be in the inside.",1356393600,3,192,4.078947368421052
4073096,5,B00366BBTE,Wonderful for sociology class. Wonderful to helping me to think. Asks the hard questions in a way that makes the viewer want to learn more. I recommend it for personal and educational purposes.,1353974400,,193,4.878787878787879

8389528,5,B00366BBTE,"I loved this movie from the first time I watched it. After seeing it on TV, I knew I needed to add it to my collection. I was impressed with the way this movie examines social constructs and bullying of those who are different. Kaley Cuoco does an excellent job of portraying a student who wants to complete her project without being discovered. However, the lessons she learns along the way are lessons that society would do well to listen to.",1454025600,,444,4.493827160493828
