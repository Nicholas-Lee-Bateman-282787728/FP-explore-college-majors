8692066,3,B00QMWEINK,"watched both in one sitting. they have one thing in common. bad scripts. the acting was fine, but not exceptional. just a bad story? two unenthused directors? older one was dullish and newer one was dull with nudity. I lost a few hours and gained whatever weight there was in part of a chocolate crme pie. the pie was five stars.",1509494400,,329,4.409836065573771

8692071,5,B00QMWEINK,Fascinating to see two different treatments of Graham Greene's story. I love both of them!,1461369600,,90,5.066666666666666
8692072,5,B00QMWEINK,"I am a fan of both versions of this story on film so was very pleased to see them as a DVD combo.
What a great idea ! How lovely to see them neatly packaged together .The film quality is excellent too.
May I suggest that the same thing be done with other films that have more than one version, albeit some of the earlier  versions being a little dated.
A few examples of some films of which there are duplicate versions : An Affair to Remember, Waterloo Bridge, Enchanted April ( yes ! ), Mutiny on the Bounty, The Winslow Boy, The Browning Version, Rose Marie  ....and the list goes on !
Come on Amazon .....let's see some of these potential combos on sale . I'm sure they'd be favourites.",1439078400,,690,4.259541984732825
