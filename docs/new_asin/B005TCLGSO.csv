8486077,3,B005TCLGSO,"This film needs to be restored and given the proper re-release it so deserves. What Fox has done feels like a home VHS recording transferred to DVD-r. Alas, this is the only widely available version of the film, so it's all we've got until someone wises up.",1520726400,,257,4.48936170212766
8486078,4,B005TCLGSO,"I thoroughly enjoyed this little movie - I never really thought about the probability of psychotic personalities wandering the western world of Clint Eastwood or John Wayne but I guess they were there - I mean who were the recipients of their kind of horseback justice except that type of twisted abnormal psychos? Anyway the main psycho in this story holds his own with Hannibal Lector and his ilk quite well, leading antihero Hugh Obrien on a merry run for his own sanity as he struggles to thwart Robert Evans in his sociopathic plan of mayhem spun in his direction.",1421193600,2,569,4.7

8486080,1,B005TCLGSO,"Well, here's another release from 20th Century Fox--the film studio who introduced the cinemascope process to motion-pictures--choosing to release one of their cinemascope films in a pan-and-scan full frame version instead of going to the effort of tracking down a suitable print in the correct aspect ratio.  They'll keep getting one-star ratings from me until they wise up and stop doing this.",1401148800,6,395,5.370967741935484
8486081,5,B005TCLGSO,"Very cool, underrated western that has all the hallmarks of a monster movie.  Hugh O'Brien spends time in jail with Robert Evans, a genuine psycho who kills without feeling or reservation.  When Evans character goes after Hugh's family...it becomes personal.",1387238400,2,258,5.425
8486082,1,B005TCLGSO,"I'm reading that Fox Cinema Archive has chosen to release The Fiend Who Walked The West in a cropped 1.33:1 original aspect ratio, not the original 2.35:1 OAR. I've been looking for this film and was excited to see it being released, but not in this form. If I want this movie in 2.35:1, I'll have to buy the PAL import now.",1377388800,10,324,4.241935483870968
8486083,5,B005TCLGSO,"A sad remake of 1947s Kiss Of Death made into a(OH NO) Western. They should have left well enough alone. A real waste of great talent. Hugh OBrien,Robert Evans,Stephen McNally(This time bad boy Steve plays the ALAS Good Guy)Dolores Michaels,Linda Crystal,etc
Robert plays the Richard Widmark part.
Believe me,they made better Westerns.
If your looking for another,Red River,Rio Bravo,or The Cowboys,this is NOT for you.",1326844800,2,419,5.461538461538462
