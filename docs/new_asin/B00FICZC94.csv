8615912,4,B00FICZC94,I enjoy this.  I love the upbeat music and the instructions she gives.  I wish she had incorporated some type of stretching after the muscles have become warm.  The only stretching is at the end of the tape.,1432771200,,207,4.394736842105263

8615915,4,B00FICZC94,"This is my first spinning type workout, so I cannot compare to others. I bought a Sunny Fitness bike from Amazon and needed something to got with it, so naturally I chose Cathe. I have yet to get through the entire workout. For me this is pretty tough stuff. I have been working out with Cathe for years and can manage most of her routines. So this is the first I haven't completed. She does offer Premixes so that helps. I found the music motivating and irritating at the same time. Not a deal breaker for me. This leaves me dripping with sweat and feeling very accomplished. Major calorie burner and a nice change from the usual step or circuit workouts.",1415750400,4,656,4.429752066115703
8615916,5,B00FICZC94,Best spin videos! Highly engaging and make you sweat. Enjoy the motivating music. Having been disappointed by one of Cathe's videos yet :),1398470400,,138,5.043478260869565
