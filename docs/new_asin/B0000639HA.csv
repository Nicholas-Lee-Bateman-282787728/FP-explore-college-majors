1688066,5,B0000639HA,"If you like the classic anime then this IS the DVD to get.  Well...after you've bought the first 6 individual discs.  This box set starts off where those ended.  More great Gatchaman Madness.  And you do not just get Battle of the Planets version but also the Gatchaman & G-Force.  ALL THREE SERIES!!!!  I can't understand how anyone can complain.  Definitely one of the few classic series done right the first time.
Too bad all the reviewers don't wait til they actually have the item to review or even know what is in it.",1066348800,4,523,4.5
1688067,5,B0000639HA,"One of the reviewers above appears to have got the wrong impression of this DVD set. In fact, the review suggests he hasn't even had a look at what the contents actually are. YES, we know BOTP is a sanitised and altered version of Gatchaman, but the beauty of this box set is that you get both the BOTP episodes and the Gatchaman episodes from which they are derived.
Most of us watching in English will remember BOTP, not Gatchaman, and since this is a nostalgia product, that is surely what we would like to see again. Watching the Gatchaman episodes and the documentaries really brings home how drastic and tacky the US alterations to the show were, so it's not as if the superior plotting, writing and atmosphere of Gatchaman is in any way obscured or misrepresented by this package.
At least Battle of the Planets still has cooler music, though. And that's the point of this set: it aims to give you the best of both worlds. What's to complain about?",1065571200,10,955,4.526011560693641
1688068,4,B0000639HA,"When Rhino first released ""Battle of the Planets"" on DVD I, like most fans of the show, was ecstatic just that the show was finally available to own despite the condition and limited content--no real restoration, and only two episodes per volume which added up to a total of six volumes. This ultimate set picks up where Volume 6 left off, with the next 12 episodes in the series. Sure the picture quality looks pretty much like it did when the show aired in the 70s, and the sound is best left in standard stereo but hey, that's how I've always watched BOTP so it doesn't take away from my enjoyment. You can either critique the flaws in the presentation (and the episodes themselves) to death and not have a good time or you can be a kid again and watch BOTP for what it is--an imaginative piece of early anime with cool heroes, vehicles, weapons, heroics, and adventure. I recommend the latter. BOTP will appeal to the kid in you, while Gatchaman offers more adult substance to compare with. That's the REAL treat of this set. Here are the contents of the set:

Episodes (13-24):
Perilous Pleasure Cruise
The Thing With 1,000 Eyes
Microfilm Mystery
The Alien Beetles
A Whale Joins G-Force
Mad New Ruler Of Spectra
The Sea Dragon
Magnetic Attraction
The Musical Mummy
The Fiery Lava Giant
The Bat-Ray Bombers
Race Against Disaster

Special Features:
*12 original, uncut Gatchaman episodes with English subtitles
*Separate Commentary Track by Janet Waldo (Princess), Alan Young (7 Zark 7), & Ronnie Schell (Jason)
*Exclusive Interviews with Janet Waldo, Casey Kasem (Mark), Alan Young, Ronnie Schell & Jameson Brewer (Executive Producer)
*Memorabilia Gallery
*Cast and Crew Bios
*Promotional Trailers
*Collectible Booklet with Episode Synopses & Trivia

If Rhino continues to release further ""ultimate sets"" we'll have all the BOTP & Gatchaman episodes in due time.",1065225600,14,1866,4.955271565495208
1688069,5,B0000639HA,"It was a sheer delight to see Battle of the Planets again, twenty years since it was last aired on television. This box set takes up where the individual releases leave off (volumes 1 through 6 of the single DVD releases) and so starts at episode 13, about where the artwork and the characterization really begins to fall into shape. Since the episodes weren't intended to air in order, the viewer doesn't miss out on any continuity, but by starting in the middle you really benefit from voice actors who have a handle on their characters and stories worth watching.
The bonus features were a pleasure: subtitled episodes of Gatchaman, the anime from which Battle of the Planets was created, and also interviews with the original cast members. I LOVE Ronnie Schell! He made Jason come alive for me and I never forgot his voice, even after all this time. It was a thrill to hear their recollections of creating the series. It sounded as if they were really enjoying themselves, and that must have contributed to why this show has such longevity.
The original show itself has some problems--notably the robot narrator and the sanitized violence--which are more glaring to an adult than they were to us in our childhood. I think that by watching both versions, we get the full experience: we remember why we loved the show, and we see what it truly was. I highly recommend this box set. I especially recommend the limited edition Jason action figure with his civilian car. I've already had to convince my daughter it's Mommy's toy and not hers! I would definitely buy this all over again if I had to, and it's terrific to see this show once more.",1065052800,63,1643,4.6689655172413795
1688070,1,B0000639HA,"Why spend the money on the worst incarnation of the Ninja Science Team Gatchaman when you can find the original elsewhere.  Even Ted Turner's version, G-Force, was truer to the original anime.  The characters are unlikable with their ""Americanized names and voices (please, Casey Kasem?!? Ughh!  The stories are butchered from the original, an annoying robot was added to this version to make it ""kid friendly"" and the series was set on different planets as opposed to the earth-based adventures of the original.  Notice that in the episode of the Space Mummy, the story takes place on a ""distant planet"" and yet a JAL airliner is seen landing at the ""spaceport"".

The sound is so bad even their new 5.crap mix and the video looks like someone droped it on the floor and didn't clean it before transfering it onto this dvd box set,the shocking thing to me is that the jupanise episods,here as special features,are spotless and crystal clear,if only the american episodes were that great...if only.
i hated it and had to stop watching it,the only episode with the audio comentery is ok,too bad the actores don't remember anything from the show,for two out of the three it's the first time ever watching the sow?!?

I remember watching this amazing show when it premeired on my local TV station back in 1978 and loving it! It's one of my all time favorite shows back when we had actual cartoons on TV, not like now.
Rhino deserves applause for bringing Sandy Frank's Battle of the Planets to video. I love this series of DVD's! The video transfers and sound are great! I wish they would have included three more Sandy Frank episodes instead of the original subtitled Japanese Gatchman, I am not a die hard anime fan. And then there are the bloody awful Turner TBS/TNT Networks edited G-Force episodes.

1688100,5,B0000639HA,After ordering this item I had second thoughts after reading how others had rated this box set. Some had said the sound and picture quality wasn't that good. I also wasn't sure if I would have to watch all episodes with subtitles. Come to find out you get the cartoon in english and in Japanese which is good because I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much watching all in Japanese with english subtitles. As a kid I loved this cartoon and everything was just as I remember. Sound and picture were fine. If you to loved Battle of the Planets I would recommend this box set.,1104192000,12,568,4.367924528301887
1688101,4,B0000639HA,"I loved this series as a kid and now, as an adult, I love it still.  This set contains one of my favorite eps, the Fierce Flowers, which was a 2-parter.  Unlike the prior DVD's, however, there are no Gatchaman or G-Force versions.  Unfortunately, Rhino lost the rights to Gatchaman so any future DVD's are unlikely to contain them either.  But, all in all, a great collection!!  Not much in the way of special features but you get a lot of episodes in exchange.",1102032000,2,461,4.440476190476191
1688106,5,B0000639HA,I'd never purchased anime before when I spotted the Battle of the Planets 25th Anniversary set while out shopping. BATTLE OF THE PLANETS! I had many great times as a kid dreaming about these characters and pretending to be them. This DVD set was a must have and I hadn't seen this show in 25 years so it was quite a flashback. The voice talent on this show was really impressive and it's wonderful to see Zoltan (Keye Luke really is fantastic and his performance makes his role one of the all time great cartoon bad guys) and my childhood heroes the G-Force (all fine performers who are perfect) and 7Zark7 (Alan Young really shines). Watching these DVDs has brought back so many great memories. Thanks Rhino!,1096502400,7,709,4.590551181102362
1688107,5,B0000639HA,"Although I wish Rhino would release the entire season in a DVD boxed set as Universal did in the UK, its great to see more DVDs from ""Battle of the Planets"" being released.

1688108,5,B0000639HA,I loved Battle Of the Planets as a kid and can't wait for this DVD set. I've seen the original Japanese version of this show but it's the Battle of the Planets version that fueled my youthful imagination and for which I have a great deal more affection. Battle of the Planets is truly an old childhood friend. 14 episodes for seventeen bucks and some change? Wow! Can't wait!,1095638400,4,375,4.449275362318841
1688109,5,B0000639HA,"This is a great DVD set. I loved Battle of the Planets growing up and I find that now I love the original Japanese version EVEN MORE (no 7-Zark-7, continuing storylines, character development and way more action and SCIENCE). It is really great to be able to see how the story was originally intended. The subtitles for the Gatchaman episodes are great and MUCH BETTER than a Gatchaman DVD i was able to get off of EBay!! Defintely get these first so you have some of idea of what the characters names really are before you buy any Gatchaman DVD's.

For those who complained that there were eps missing, they were not BofP eps that were missing. The eps are numbered based on the corresponding Gatchaman eps. Unfortunately, of the 105 Gatchaman eps, only 85 were made into BotP, so the numbers skip when there is no corresponding BotP episode. But don't worry, you're not missing any BotP eps.",1094083200,19,893,4.616352201257862

1688111,5,B0000639HA,"greetings from britain! just thought i`d let you all know there is a complete 85 episode box set just been released here in the uk! it`s in pal so you will have to have a multi-region player.this set is awesome,get it on amazon uk!",1090886400,2,231,4.2727272727272725
1688112,3,B0000639HA,"Only read this if you want to know the truth about the release of these BOTP.  After researching for weeks, I have learned that BOTP eps 1-12 are contained (2 apiece) on DVD's volumes 1 through 6 (plus you get the Gatchaman counterparts and a bonus G-Force).  You do not get eps 1-12 (or maybe I am mistaken and it's 1-10) on this Ultimate Set.
This Ultimate Set as I am imformed, contains ONLY eps 13 through 20 OUT OF A TOTAL OF 85!  That means that there are about 75 to 77 episodes you DO NOT get.
I feel that the BOTP series is great, and I like Gatchaman too... but these people are trying to turn a dime by selling crap without telling you what episodes it contains.  THEY NEED TO SAY that it only contains about eight to ten of a TOTAL of 85 epidodes.  Therefore, Ultimate collection, my you-know-what.
There is a serious demand for BOTP media out there, we have the money, and we will wait to buy all 85 DVD's.  RESIST THE TEMPTATION to market crap to us or there will be backlash.  Although the quality is the same on these as the others, we want the episodes 21 through 85 also, and it is available on ebay in the UK, so everyone buy your international DVD players now at your favorite stores and skip this marketing crud.",1090022400,26,1233,4.243589743589744
1688113,5,B0000639HA,".
First of all, Battle of the Planets is great Anime. Its wonderfully drawn and the stories are well told.
If you're looking at this specific set as an introduction - I would however, suggest you begin with BOTP (Battle Of The Planets) Vol. 1 as this DVD boxed set starts at a point further into the Gatchaman storyline.
I honestly feel a little clarification is needed here with regards to this DVD set.
The set contains 4 discs. Episodes 14 through 27 are featured but episodes 19 and 20 are not included. I'm not sure why (perhpas there's a BOTP fan who can explain) but its worth mentioning.
In order to get a COMPLETE set (note the title of this boxed set is ""ultimate"" not ""complete""), you have to purchase the previously released VOLUMES (Volumes 1 through 6). This DVD set starts off with the storyline started in those volumes.
Is it a good set - Oh yea! Its very cool and very watchable, just know what you're getting.
I would suggest - start with the individual volumes and then puchase this DVD set to continue your collection.
Happy viewing.
Best Regards,
turtlex",1087603200,149,1076,4.551546391752577
1688114,5,B0000639HA,"That this DVD set would be vilified at all is an insult to those who had a hand in it's production.

As a kid (all of 10 during it's production) I seem to recall exclaiming how beautiful a cartoon it was not knowing at the time what made it so extraordinary.  The use of the multi-plane camera and what we now call japanimation was, at the time, unique in a North American-distributed show aimed at kids.

Today there is a more ready acceptance of the genre, as exemplified by releases as 'Sprited Away' and 'Princess Mononoke"" but in 1978 no one had seen it's like before.

The voiceover work demonstrated in this DVD set is an acid test for the quality that CAN be produced out of Hollywood but so frequently falls short.  These characterisations were created in Valentine Studios, as far from glamorous as one can get in terms of Hollywood product.  No exclusive First Class trailers here, only a dingy, stale cigarette infused room with microphones, acoustic dampening and a great deal of talent!!

Who would dare be so audacious to critique the performances of Waldo, Kasem, Schell, et. al.?!  Step forward now and receive comeuppance for your insolence!  Truly, these voice actors set the bar for their work.  Given especially that their job was not characterization as we know it today but rather, ADR (looping).  Their voices were recorded AFTER the film was already in the can.  This is typical of Anime but unheard of in American animation where the voices are recorded before the animation.  The advantage of the latter is voice actors have the blessing of interpreting the script as they and the director see fit and the animator produces drawing inspired by the performance.  With anime, actors are required to sync their performance to the timing dictated by the animation.  No small task, and one need only note the U.S. release of Sprited Away for a very stark example of the technique.

The DVD set itself sets no benchmarks in terms of features, but does contain teriffic interviews with the voice actors and does illicit the feeling of nostalgia for which it was intended (if such a thing is possible for a 'space cartoon').

I rate this box set as not to be missed!",1066435200,2,2185,4.707894736842105

One reviewer was pissed that the box set didn't include the first 6 discs.  Not sure what sense that would make since they are already out!  This is an old show so the sound was orginally Dolby Stereo (2 channel) and the video does show the age.  But this is no worse than the other TV shows I have from the time.  It's much better still than any VHS I have ever seen plus it's complete.  If you are used to the new style it might put you off.  Personally I love the classic series, especially Gatchaman, and the old style doesn't bother me.
