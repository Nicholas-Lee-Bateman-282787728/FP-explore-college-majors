1077486,2,6305797099,Now this is really a bad movie. Ok I Like Richard Hell...and he does appear in this movie...Carole Bouquet is beautiful but this is one unnecessary pretentious movie. It is worth it for the live segments but otherwise...,1139097600,,220,4.815789473684211
1077487,3,6305797099,"blank generation is a little quirky but quite good. There are a resonable amount of performance scenes which makes the film worthwhile. If you like punk music you should see this movie. There's some great footage and great sound quality. Andy Warhol's brief apperance is interesting and its just a good movie to see. Not outstanding, but good enough.",1055721600,4,350,4.9491525423728815
1077488,1,6305797099,"When Carole Bouquet was an aspiring young French actress she accepted the starring role in this film about an egotistical, abusive rock star creep (played by Richard Hell, who previously played an egotistical, abusive rock star creep in ""Smithereens"").
The only way this film should be viewed is with the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 gang seated front row center.  I'm sure Crow, Tom Servo, Joel and Gypsy would have some prime zingers to shoot at this depressing, pretentious piece of New York trash.",1033603200,3,501,5.036144578313253
1077489,3,6305797099,"I basically bought/watched this video for 2 main reasons.
1) the cameo of Andy Warhol
2) I am a guitar player
My reaction was ""eeh""---the movie is so-so.  I'm not a huge fan of Punk Rock anyway...interesting to see a group where the Bass player is out front as lead singer.  I guess I was expecting something with a little more edge...I didn't dislike the movie,
but it never really ""grabbed me"" either.  Warhol got his own proverbial 15 minutes (ironic!) and that was that.  The NY Jewish chick/filmmaker was cute--when she dropped the silly wig.
The French girlfriend, ah well...she was just as indecisive as the lead character.  Like the other reviewer here, I would have liked to have seen more footage of the band and more music.",1002844800,,734,4.658914728682171
1077490,2,6305797099,"It's nice to see some authentic, good quality footage from CBGBs, but the movie itself really sucks. And the Warhol appereance only lasts for a  couple of minutes.
Five stars for the music, one star for the movie.",966124800,4,213,4.605263157894737
1077491,4,6305797099,Worth buying for the live performances alone.  The only high quality video (or audio for that matter) footage of Richard Hell & the Voidoids available - outstanding!  I only wish there was more band footage.,963360000,12,207,4.885714285714286

1077642,3,6305797099,"I'm a fan of all things punk, but I wanted to throw every member of the cast off the Brooklyn bridge.  Some I would swing about by their heels and then fling them over the edge, others I would dangle by their ankles, torturing them with the anticipation of their demise.  Oh and I would film it with a hat cam and then do some s***ty art film with it later.  But not really.  Then again, yes actually.",1405987200,,401,4.102564102564102
1077643,5,6305797099,"Although the movie part of this disjointed flic is a bit B-rated artsy, there are an abundance of scenes with Mr. Hell just being Richard. The CBGB scenes inserted into the movie represent his weekly routine on stage. This is where the payoff for buying the movie begins... excellent footage of the real thing, Punk Rock as it was meant to be played and all the original Voidoids in awesome form. There is a rather lengthy interview with Richard as a bonus and is the gem of icing on the cake. If you are a true 1977 Punker then this will fill in some gaps that document this world wide movement we call Punk Rock 77 style.",1399766400,4,623,4.333333333333333
1077644,5,6305797099,"like other reviews here, this movie is goofy (richard hell says just that in the special feature) but it was refreshing to see some live (original) voidoids. I had the good fortune to see these guys numerous times back in 1976-78, those were great music days and cheap too, 5-7 bucks a show......goofy movie but......",1389571200,,317,4.781818181818182
1077645,1,6305797099,"The song ""Blank Generation"" was so so, ok. Not Misfits good. He sang the song like 3 times in the movie. The female lead was attractive - I think she was a Bond girl around that time. You can get a feel of the movie in the first 10 minutes. It was so bad...I just can't remember anything about it just now....and that was last week!",1379462400,,332,4.045454545454546
1077646,4,6305797099,"It is New York from the 1980s, but not that great. It is still great to see the city back then.",1361750400,4,95,3.5714285714285716
1077647,3,6305797099,"Great scenes from Richard Hell and The Voidoids Live at CBGB's in the late 70's, the movie is not that good, but having the chance of watching one of the greatest american punk bands of all times is worth the time.",1269993600,3,214,4.2439024390243905
1077648,2,6305797099,"There are really only 4 reasons to watch this film.

1. The scenes of Richard Hell & the Voidoids performing at CBGB.
2. The beautiful cinematography capturing the Lower East Side of New York in the wintertime in 1978.
3. Elliot Goldenthal's wonderfully atmospheric soundtrack.
4. Hell's bluntly honest interview about the film.

Otherwise it's pretty dire - badly acted (as Hell admits), directionless, nonsensical. Ulli Lommel (who would go on to a thriving career in straight-to-video horror flicks) clearly had no idea where he was going with this movie or even what ""blank generation"" meant. Worth your time only for any combination of the bullet points above.",1269648000,13,665,5.148148148148148
7895235,1,6305797099,"Pretty much a waste of time. After some uncomfortably bad pre/post sex scenes, I ended up skipping ahead to the New York street scenes and Voidoid performances- which get boring too unless you really love the song BLANK GENERATION. It's the only song they play live as far as I could tell. Robert Quine was a great guitar player and it was really nice seeing him play here, just wished there was more and not the same song over and over. Cool seeing Marky Ramone too. Richard Hell as an actor? Keep your day job.",1497657600,,512,4.4

7895237,4,6305797099,"I don't think that you people realize what you are seeing. The point of viewing this movie today is not for entertainment as much as it is viewing a snapshot of Richard Hell at his prime. Those of you going in expecting to see a masterpiece aren't going to have a very good time. But if you go in realizing that he MADE this movie (as well as directed and starred in it) back in the 70's with literally no resources or money, then it's really cool to see a work made by an amazing artist. Try viewing it as an artifact or old document instead of a film.",1488153600,,553,4.08256880733945

7895239,2,6305797099,"Other than the clips of Richard Hell and the Voidoids playing live, this is not worth the time or the money. Hell, Hell makes fun of the movie in the accompanying interview.",1458086400,,173,4.4375
7895240,2,6305797099,"I got this DVD because I love Richard Hell and the Voidoids. The cover sure looks cool. Well, this movie is not cool at all. It is so arty and boring, even though it stars Richard Hell. Yes, the footage of the Voidoids performing at CBGB and the streets of NY in 1978 are fantastic, but there is very little of it; not nearly enough to make this a worth while purchase. The other reviews here are being far too kind. Skip this and try ""Smithereens"", a movie Hell made a couple of years after this. He only acts in this movie but it's great, and has lots of footage of a dilapidated 1980 NYC.",1455321600,6,591,4.147826086956521
7895241,2,6305797099,Terrible commercial film. An utter failure and nothing punk rock about it. Richard was and will always be a wanna-be punk rocker. All the good punk rockers are dead.,1452297600,,165,4.724137931034483
7895242,3,6305797099,"I really only like this movie because it's Richard Hell and there is some live Voidoids footage.  I enjoy the sorta bad acting and terrible script, otherwise. If you are a fan or are on a new wave nostalgia trip, go for it.",1440374400,2,223,4.186046511627907

7895244,4,6305797099,"This quick cut wander through the punk scene -- starring iconic downtowner Richard Hell at his apex -- apes the art films of the '60s, an homage to Fellini and beyond. Unfortunately, it meanders, lacks focus and falls -- as films often made by folks outside rock & roll often do -- into cliches. Two-dimensional is generous, many of the performances are cardboard at best; the ending suggests no one had a notion of what the story arc was.
But as a series of snapshots from the NYC underground just after the punk explosion, ""Blank Generation"" captures the places and energy of the day. The city streets of New York as Max's Kansas City's hipster cool merged with CBGB's color outside the lines iconoclasts are as honest and real as they could be. The Andy Warhol cameo towards the end is as odd and obfuscating as you would hope.
Do not come for the plot or the performances -- though some of the Voidoids' live shots work -- but to see a moment long extinguished. As postcards from the undercard, ""Blank Generation"" is valuable. Also as a cliche magnet, it's all here: the manager, the agent, the label guy. To see why so many ""industry weasels"" have loathsome reputations, this is a good place to start.",1433462400,3,1206,4.587962962962963
