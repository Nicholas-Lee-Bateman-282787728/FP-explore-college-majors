8716142,4,B00XKD9F9Q,"Incredibly interesting and entertaining documentary about Brad Williams, one of several people in the United States who possesses the uncanny ability to remember (in great detail) every day of his life. What most of us struggle to remember from even a week ago, Williams can remember thoroughly for every day of his life.

The ability is called HYPERTHYMESIA, and it's what has earned Brad the nickname of ""The Human Google"" because he can correctly identify what was going on during specific seemingly insignificant days of the past faster than a person can type up the query to a search engine.

It's an offbeat, always entertaining film...one that leads you to marvel about the human mind. Directed by the subject's brother (Eric Williams), the film is never dry or dull. It incorporates great footage of Brad demonstrating his memory on such shows as ""Good Morning America"" and ""60 Minutes"", plus some remarkable footage of him meeting face-to-face with others who share the same ability.

I've seen it both at our local Wisconsin film festival and now on home video.",1432080000,,1071,5.00561797752809
