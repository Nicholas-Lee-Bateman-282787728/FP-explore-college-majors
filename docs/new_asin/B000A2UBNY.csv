2351758,3,B000A2UBNY,"After reading the reviews I was very eager to watch this DVD.  Granted that when compared to others on the market it is a cut above.  However there is nothing really new here, and believe me th e pro's are NOT worried by any information on this disc!  For me, Annie only starts to touch on the advanced concepts of layers - what cards do I have, what does my opponent have, what does he think I have etc.  The rest is the usual Caro tells, implied odds etc that you will have read in any good book.  Worth a look but its not as ground breaking as I had been lead to believe!",1138233600,,574,4.0
2351759,5,B000A2UBNY,"The other reviewers are exactly right.

Like most of you, I have just about all the other poker DVD's out there: Hellmuth's,(crappy) Lederer's (decent), Gordon's (my favorite until now),etc. However, Annie Duke so blows all the others out of the water it's not even funny. For the serious player this DVD is worth a lot more then $19.95(in fact, she could have charged $49.00 and it still would have been worth it).

And yes, the other pros are not going to be happy with her, as she really does share many of their best secrets. What's more, the fact that she pours so much strong content into her DVD, really highlights how fluff filled the other's are. Yes, if you are just starting out then Lederer's is a good place to start, but after you've been playing for a while, and are ready to go past ""starting hand selection,"" then this DVD is your huckleberry.

I was surprised how good and entertaining her book was, as it did a nice job of combining poker tips with her life story, but with this DVD, Annie has put herself at the top of the poker instructional DVD list. Since it has only been out for a little while, I don't think alot of players know about it just yet. But that won't last long. Once the magazines, blogs, and poker web sites start reviewing it, the cat will be out of the bag.

The funny thing to me is first she beats her brother at the table (winning the TOC), and now she puts out a better DVD than his. Pretty soon it's going to be, ""Hey, aren't you Howard lederer, ANNIE DUKE'S brother!?"" lol :)",1135123200,24,1522,4.348591549295775
2351760,5,B000A2UBNY,"I have watched a lot of poker DVD's and this is by far the best I've seen!  Annie goes into great depth in explaining advanced strategy that you just don't get in other DVD's.  If you are an absolute beginner, then I don't suggest this DVD.  You should get Annie's Begginner DVd which is coming out soon.  I guess they decided to lead with the Advanced DVD since so many people are sick of learning the rules of Texas Hold Em.  In How To Beat The Big Boys, Annie really spills the beans.  I'm not going to rehash the content for you on this review.  If you want it...you gotta pay for it.  All I can say, It's woth ten times the price of the DVD.",1134864000,11,646,4.071428571428571
2351761,5,B000A2UBNY,"With the huge number of new products hitting the market and a couple of marginal offerings from other name players I was not sure what to expect... Wow! This DVD is very good and has more advanced material than ""any"" other DVD currently on the market. I was blown away by the amount and specific kind of material here. Her section on reading and profiling players is phenomenal, beyond anything I have read or seen elsewhere. The amount of information and the detail of this section is by itself worth much more than the cost of the DVD. I would venture to say there will be a huge buzz in the poker world when word gets out of what is in this DVD. The pros are sure to be upset that she has given away trade secrets.

 If there are any minuses they are very small. Several times she jumps back and forth between limit and no limit holdem causing mild confusion but once you've watched it the second or third time you don't even notice. The only thing that really bothered me at all was her statement that poker is not gambling but investing. That may be true for professionals but the average player does not yet play or think at that level so a statement like that is a little misguided in my opinion. If a player can lose their money, it is still gambling.

  She reveals so much more advanced material than any of the other DVDs that I have bought that purely from a value standpoint it is worth much more than any of the other DVDs. Despite my pet peeves I still give it 5 stars; it is so far beyond my expectations of both material and price. This is by far the ""single"" best poker product(book or video) I've bought this year. I think the producers don't realize the value here and could easily have asked for twice as much money.  Get it as soon as possible. I promise you will love it.",1132444800,67,1794,4.277286135693215
2351762,3,B000A2UBNY,"I would recommend this DVD, so long as you aren't paying the full price for it.  It will help people take that next step to becoming a better player, but it won't get you there.  It has some good information, although i did find it funny on how she criticized Daniel Negreanu's play (although she didn't mention his name).  Overall, it was OK.  Some good advice to take in, but nothing crazy good.  I would recommend for beginners to people who are trying to get to the next level.",1350950400,,481,4.359550561797753

2351764,4,B000A2UBNY,This video is definatley informative in regards to what many involuntary body postures and ticks mean. It probably won't help your online game much. If you like to play in lives games then it's definatly worth the money.,1291593600,,220,4.815789473684211
2351765,3,B000A2UBNY,"Great DVD, definitely for more advanced players.  Poker basics required to follow video properly.  She has years of experience she shares about player strategies, betting strategies, reading other players, etc.  I learned great insider information from this DVD that helps with every hand I play.

2351766,4,B000A2UBNY,This was a decent instructional video for a fairly experienced poker player looking to further better their play.  I had a watch a couple of times to fully grasp the concepts she teaches.  She covers a lot of aspects of the game.  I admire her play so I will definately try to utilize her tips.  The video display and scenery are pretty generic but how exciting can you make an instructional video.,1263600000,,398,4.486111111111111
2351767,5,B000A2UBNY,"Phil Hellmuth has since ripped off all of Annies material here in his new book on FBI profiling.
Annie tells it here in this video....who knows, maybe she got it from Phil.
Annie Duke you may consider to be an ok Poker player like I do, nothing fancy, but this video shows shes one smart cookie.
Its a very long 90 min video and PACKED with Poker tells, tells that you may never have even thot about, but at the Live cash game (or a tourny) if you are paying attention to the other players, now and then you will get a ""tell"" that this video teaches and that alone is worth the price.
She gives also ""tells"" that only women do (or the marjority are women)one example is a quick ""lidding"" or hooding of the eyes, she does an example of it in the video, you can prob pick up on that when your girlfriend is telling you a lie next time.

If you have been playing for years you probably already know this stuff. If like me,you've been playing for a few months and are doing OK but need help to the next level this is a very good buy. After she talked about a subject I felt like I understood it better than I did. There could have ""been more to it"",but for the money I put in and the return I got I feel I made a good call.",1242604800,,534,3.908256880733945
2351769,3,B000A2UBNY,The concepts in this DVD about profiling are prety easy and have lots of commen sense. The last 1/3 of the DVD is a bit over my level of knowledge or maybe concern. I don't expect to be a world class player so the bankroll section didn't hold much for me. Overall the DVD was worth it.,1238889600,,285,4.017543859649122
2351770,5,B000A2UBNY,Good fun watched it with family and was easy to understand and Annie is a fun person. Good up to Med level players of Texas Holdem,1237420800,,130,4.038461538461538
2351771,5,B000A2UBNY,"Annie Duke is a great poker player, and while her 'performance' is a bit stilted at times, she does try to pack as much good information into this DVD as she can.  Her tips on reading people, and on learning from FBI journals, are, in my humble opinion, inspired. And of course, for us guys, it doesn't hurt that she's gorgeous. (grin) This was money well spent.",1235520000,,362,4.402985074626866
2351772,5,B000A2UBNY,This video was alot more than I expected. Please if your a guy or girl this is a must see!! The tells she gives you are awesome and really helped my game. This is more than just a girls video. If your a guy I promise you she will give you valuable stuff to improve your game. Awesome video. I watch it again and again.,1231632000,,318,3.9076923076923076
2351773,3,B000A2UBNY,"Good for the price at $9.95 and for long boring flights with Harry Potter in-flight movies.  Annie does have some interesting tips, but nothing most serious players haven't already figured out.  Just kinda validates what you already know.

The video is a little boring.  Honestly, I must confess I haven't made it all the way through the video yet.  Maybe the best tips are in the other parts I haven't watch?  The other problem is that the DVD was obviously done on the cheap.  At several points you can hear people walking down a hallway behind Annie Duke. You wouldn't think it would matter, but it makes it harder to watch than it should be.",1228694400,,645,4.556521739130435
2351774,4,B000A2UBNY,This video is produced in the best fashion however the information is beneficial and is worth the money.,1220140800,,104,4.833333333333333
2351775,4,B000A2UBNY,"Production is pretty poor; it's just Duke sitting at a poker table with a deck of cards. She's serious about poker and watching her explain poker is never fun.  That said, there were more than a few gold nuggets here that have improved my game: slow playing a dry board, physical tells to watch for, how to play against a very aggressive opponent, how to disguise your betting patterns, etc.  If you're fairly new to poker, this is a very good purchase. And if you know the game well, you'll still pick up some good info.  The portion on tells was very revealing; in fact, when I selected a jury recently for a trial I observed many tells of the potential jurors based on what Duke described on this DVD.  Duke is, no doubt, an incredible poker player.  I wish this DVD was longer and more in depth.",1209513600,,799,4.371621621621622
2351776,4,B000A2UBNY,"I think this DVD is really helpful to the intermediate/advanced Holdem player. If your a beginner this DVD can give you a broad sense for what your getting yourself into, so you might want to get some material that introduces you to the game and intermediate concepts. If you watch this DVD once you won't (well at least I didn't) really capture all that is taught since everything she says is so concentrated you have to watch it over and over and take notes (hopefully) if your really serious about playing holdem.

For the content, Annie Duke presents a lot of advanced concepts to think about that are really situational. None of it is vague and this material will help you, though in the DVD there isn't really much practical examples in which she demonstrates holdem ""scenarios"" with the deck she has in front of her throught the whole DVD. I wasn't too happy about that but still, all the information she presents is valuable and essential for the holdem player. You just need to watch this DVD over and over and you'll start to extract the concepts and add them to your repertoire. Watching this DVD alone will not make you ready to play holdem; it's one of many media/materials you add to your library of poker and you need to go out and find more material to study from. Annie Duke is a pretty awesome player and you need to make sure your not watching DVD's from those superstar pro's you see on TV all the time just becasue they win all the bracelets/tourneys. You can learn from any author/player to get insight from many people vs just one. I find it cute how Annie is like ""Just please don't use this information against me!"" LOL...umm yeah I don't think any poker player would really reveal thier WHOLE arsenal of skills to the public, maybe students but not the public. Anyway Annie Duke is pretty cool! Hope to meet her one day. :)",1209254400,,1849,4.519402985074627
2351777,4,B000A2UBNY,"It's a good dvd, fairly decent production value. Rather then teaching with rules it provokes more thought. I enjoyed it, even though i didn't get the one for beginers.",1209168000,,167,4.793103448275862
2351778,5,B000A2UBNY,"These videos are great and I recommend them.  However, be forewarned, this boxed set includes:

Annie Duke's Advanced Texas Hold 'Em Secrets - How to Beat the Big Boys (Masters of Poker)

Masters of Poker Presents: Annie Duke's Conquering Online Poker

All three are available individually, and as part of Amazon's ""Better Together"" deal they offer this boxed set with a copy of one of the videos already included in the box.  So unless you want multiple copies, take a pass on the ""Better Together"" deal.",1208736000,,572,4.845360824742268

2351780,5,B000A2UBNY,"I found most of the information useful and while nothing made me jump out of my seat, I felt like I got a boost in my game. I gave it 5 stars because I don't have much of a baseline for holdem instructional dvds abd I found it very informative. I bought it over a week ago and watched it twice.

Annie kind of hesitates sometimes or her timing is a tiny bit off, but I am glad she is a poker expert and not an actor(but then shouldnt a great poker player be a great actress!?), so thats not an issue for me. I skipped right past her beginners video and had no trouble keeping up with this one.

I have been playing holdem online about 40 hours a week for 4 months, just so whoever is reading this review knows where im coming from.

Also this is Richard not my wife Stephanie, we share the amazon account",1203206400,,804,4.044025157232705
2351781,2,B000A2UBNY,"Annie starts the video by explaining that this is geared towards the advanced player. By advanced she means you've read poker books, watched other DVDs, and understand poker terminology. At first I felt the the movie had some promise as it was produced a little better than other movies I've watched by The Masters of Poker.

One of the finer points of hold'em is to make sure you don't put your self in tough choices constantly, a very simple concept. She briefly touches on slow playing a hand on a dry board verses a draw heavy board where it would be wrong to slow play. This point to me is not so advanced and really should be common sense to her target audience here. Themes like this are stressed through out the video, but I still think even the top level advanced player can walk away with a few tips.

The DVD seems to focus heavily on tells and profiling as this is repeated in later chapters. These are very important concepts to understand if you're trying to move up from a level one thinking. I found one of the tells discussed to be new to me and that was blink rate. I also though it was a good reminder to stress the importance of talking to your opponents about everyday things that relate to their life so you can read body language about things that they are comfortable with and not so comfortable with, such as; dogs, kids, work, ect.

Bluffing, Semi-Bluffing, trapping, implied odds, and controlling pot odds are covered in the middle chapters of the DVD. A few examples of how to execute bluffs are given and for the most part this section is covered well. I like that in this section she mentions 9-2 off is slightly more than a 2-1 dog to AK.

Playing against maniacs, emotional control, and money management are covered at the tail end. While the maniac section is covered very well, the latter two seem to just be filler and should really be covered more in depth.

The bonus features are really not worth taking a look at. They start out with different levels of thinking but only get 3 levels deep. The levels are well discussed through out the DVD though they aren't addressed specifically as ""levels"". A lame endorsement for Commerce Casino is in the bonus features as well.

Overall I think it was a 2 and a half star DVD. The only reason it's slightly above 2 stars is the fact that it reminded me of a few things I had forgotten and was decently produced. I discussed things I liked in my review but here are a few things I did not like. She talks too much with her hands and says literally too much. Some of the concepts are geared towards the beginner and not the advanced player. Each section could have been discussed more in depth and different variations on hand examples should have been given. If we're calling DVD's like this ""for the advanced player"" then I really can't wait until a DVD comes out for the ""expert"" player.

Enjoy!",1197417600,6,2876,4.4562737642585555
2351782,4,B000A2UBNY,"Nice, direct approach to the genre of teaching video, Duke's vulnerability in from of the camera is a perfect foil for her strength of character at the poker table. Concise, witty and fun, the video is full of gems that I believe will help me relieve the donkeys of their hard-earned money..!",1179360000,,292,4.634615384615385
2351783,4,B000A2UBNY,"""Advanced"" can mean different things to different people. Let me start by telling you what it means here. It means you already know how to play the cards. This DVD will not tell you when to raise with pocket 7s or how to play when you flop a straight. This DVD is about what you need to know after you already know that. This is not about the ""advanced"" secrets of playing your hand. If you are looking for advice on how to play your two cards, this is not your DVD.

So what does it cover? The main claim to fame is the section on Tells. Annie covers techniques that the FBI uses to know when someone is lying for example. She emphasizes that you need to watch your opponents before you end up in a hand with them to get a baseline. For example, rapid blinking can be a sign of lying (bluffing), but if you haven't noticed the player before now, how do you know if he is blinking a lot? Some people just blink more than others. Also included are sections on playing against certain types of players (the maniac for one) as well as things like figuring pot odds and so on.

Yes the production values are minimal. Yes, Annie sits at the same table the entire DVD, but the advice is good and there is nothing to distract you from getting it.

If you already are confortable with playing your two cards then this DVD is a good way to help you move to the next level where what happens above your cards is just as important on what is on them.",1178668800,2,1439,4.169064748201439
2351784,2,B000A2UBNY,"I purchased both of Annie Duke's DVDs. The information is valuable but as a No Limit player,  I found the discussion of both Limit and No Limit distracting.

  My BIGGEST COMPLAINT is that the setting is identical to a funeral home, including the crimson velvet curtains framing an urn. Ms. Duke wears the same ugly shirt throughout both videos.

  I would really enjoy these DVD's if they were produced in a visually appealing setting, and if Ms. Duke changed her peasant blouse. It is unfortunate that so much good information is wasted by poor production.",1177372800,,558,4.810526315789474
2351785,3,B000A2UBNY,"great advice on tells, but it is way too short.  She spends a lot of time explaining why this dvd is only for advanced players but doesn'tgo through many topics that an advanced player thinks about.  What she is good at are seeking ""tells"", and pretty much thats all she delves into.",1174089600,,283,4.423076923076923
2351786,5,B000A2UBNY,"Let me first start by saying that I have been playing hold'em poker for 3 1/2 years, the last 1/2 year of which has been for a living. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who, like me, is a visual learner.  I personally get a lot more out of watching a lesson than by reading about one.  But, that's just me.  Anyhow, Annie (who happens to be one of my favorite players), does a fine job of covering all the major topics that an intermediate player needs to learn in order to move up the limits or simply to improve their profits at their current table limits.

No, this DVD won't make you the next World Champion, but it will teach you some very solid higher-level poker fundamentals if you are in the intermediate stage of your poker career, and it will be a great refresher course for experienced players who want to quickly brush up their skill set.

I especially like the way that this DVD is arranged into cogent chapters which you can easily jump to through the main menu.  If you want a quick lesson on how to play position, for example, you go right to that chapter on the DVD.  If you want tips on reading people's tells, based on FBI interrogator research, you can quickly get a nice lesson on that...and so on.  It is not a video that has its information strewn about randomly throughout. In short, this DVD is very well laid out, and that is one of the things I really enjoy about it.  I still go back and review sections every now and then to reinforce certain skills.

In closing, this is a good DVD and Annie Duke does a good job.  Though it's only shot with her sitting at the table in a studio, she is charismatic and fun to watch.  Will you learn the deepest, darkest secrets of world-class Texas Hold'em -- of course not.  Would KFC ever publish their secret blend of 11 herbs and spices for anyone to buy?  Same logic here, but I bet you will gain from this DVD.

That's my small blind (2 cents).  Thanks for reading my review.",1170374400,7,1949,4.284153005464481

2351790,4,B000A2UBNY,"After seeing the reviews for this DVD i quickly purchased it. While it is definitely better than any other instructional poker DVD (excluding the classic Caro's tells video) I've seen out there, that's not really saying a whole lot since most poker DVDs are junk. I found it to have useful insights on the multiple layers of the game and an interesting take on implied odds, and a discussion of a certain tell that I have not seen discussed elsewhere. It's a nice little DVD, which may bring to light some topics that rookies don't know about, and may be useful to more experienced players in that it may help them to think about certain topics in a different way. Not exactly blow my socks off great, but good value for your money and leaps and bounds above the other junk out there.",1151712000,6,784,4.489510489510489
2351791,4,B000A2UBNY,"This DVD is pretty good, but the reviews I had read led me to believe I was really going to get an amazing batch of pro secrets. The DVD is good and she does tell some things that you probably haven't heard anywhere else. I am speaking specifically about her ideas she got from her conversations with the FBI and her tips on how to deal with a maniac at the table. I really thought those two areas were exceptional. It always seems like common sense after you hear it, but she really does clear a lot of things up and does a good job of providing a lot of information.

A few downsides to mention: She discusses a lot about tells and sizing up an opponent. I only play online, so this stuff didn't help me. Also, when she discusses a tell, she performs it herself as she talks about it. When Lederer discussed tells in his DVD, he had actors play them out in a scenario, which I thought was both entertaining and more helpful to remember. The DVD never leaves a poker table with her just talking--which decreases the desire to watch it a lot of times. Had she ventured into the casino a few times to show a hand or something to change things up a little, I think it would have been better. Basically, the DVD gets a little boring after watching it a time or two.

Wrapping up this review, you have Annie Duke sharing her thoughts on how to take care of business at the poker table. It might not be the most entertaining DVD you ever buy, but there is some good information on the DVD. Definitely worth the price to have a pro player give up 90 minutes of their time. If you only play poker online, you can skip this one and wait for her online poker DVD. It should be a better choice. If you play some live poker, I think you'll definitely want to know the information on this DVD. It could really make you more dangerous at the tables.",1140393600,37,1836,4.213068181818182

8072632,5,B000A2UBNY,"This is a copy/paste review of several different poker books. I bought these so long ago. I don't recall what information is in each of the books. Overall, between the information in all of them, I've been a pretty consistent winner at smaller stake tournaments. I'm by no means a pro, but I'd make $3-4,000/year playing tournaments, usually the $5 or $10 buy in levels.
Twice I've turned $10 into over $1,000. In those cases I started with $1 tournaments until I had enough to enter bigger ones.

I was also reading books before I'd ever been online. Back in those days I ordered from Gamblers Book Club in Las Vegas. I did pretty well at live poker in the 90s at the lower stake games. 3/6 or 5/10 Hold em I usually did pretty well. At 10/20 and above, not only was the $$ a factor, but the players were generally better. I was playing full time back then, but could never really break the barrier between the good low limit player to the pro level player.

I haven't played regularly in quite a few years. The government shutting down/severely restricting the sites for US based players was the biggest reason. Also, my job involves a lot of travel, so it's tough to sit through much more than sit-n-gos. Playing at a casino after playing online to me was such a drop off. Online ya can play a lot of games at once. Live action was just to slow after playing online.

For about 3 years there, I was in the top 3% or so of all online players- at least based on the rankings of the time. Back then there were maybe 850,000 people ranked and I might be ranked 12,000 or so.

I did well at Poker Stars and Full Tilt. I thought my then girlfriend to play. The biggest thrill I've ever had in poker was in a 2000+ person tournament, she came in 1st and I came in 2nd. No, we didn't cheat. We weren't even at the same table until there were 17 people left. About a month before that, I came in 2nd in a different 2000+ person tournament.

I've taught a good friend to play. He's went way beyond anything I've accomplished. He now plays full time for a living. Another friend I've taught to play has also exceeded anything I've ever done. His son- who I taught to play along with his dad, went from $1 tournaments to $100 tournaments in a matter of months.

Except for the one, we've all stopped playing poker regularly for one reason or another. Job, business, marriage, kids, whatever the case may be. I'm not sure how up to date these books are. Poker progresses. I remember back in 1995, I could go to Toronto and the games (live cash games- $10/20 hold em) were nothing but fish.  Ya'd see max raises and be thinking it was a straight flush vs 4 of a kind. They'd turn over their cards and it was Ace high vs 1 pair. LOL!!!  So the games get better as people either smarten up or lose their $$.

So these books (again, I'm doing a copy/paste review for a few of them) are at the very least a solid lesson on how to play. I'm not sure how they'd go over in 2017, when I'm doing the actual review. For their time though, they were all dynamite. These books were not only the basis for my success, but also the successes of my friends.",1489622400,,3132,4.2592592592592595

8072636,3,B000A2UBNY,It was O.K.  It was mostly about tells.  The players I play with don't seem to have these particular tells.,1407024000,,107,4.3
8072637,1,B000A2UBNY,"Ms. Dukes seems to be very uncomfortable in front of the camera. The video is poorly made, and she uses veteran poker lingo right out of the box. As a beginner I could not understand most of what she was trying to convey. Secondly, she is not teaching the game as it is played in casinos. Dont waste your time and money on this one .",1402617600,,333,4.0606060606060606
8072638,5,B000A2UBNY,lots of very helpful info.  if u already play this is helpful in many ways. no frills just lots of good information.,1389052800,,116,4.2727272727272725
8072639,5,B000A2UBNY,not knowing a thing about poker I bought this video in hopes of learning the game.  I think Annie did a great job of teaching the game in a slow and understandable way.  She points out many of the winning ideas and concept and I would recommend this video to any one interested in learning how to play the game and taking it further.,1359331200,,333,4.1875
