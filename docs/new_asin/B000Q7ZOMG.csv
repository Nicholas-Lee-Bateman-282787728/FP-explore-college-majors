8195156,3,B000Q7ZOMG,"This DVD gave a broad overview of some of the major areas of Italy utilizing local tour guides and was even humorous in parts.  It was especially useful when it focused on travel tips such as how to use the train system, but I would have liked a little more depth regarding other tips like the best month/day/time to visit tourist areas, the pros & cons of using a tour group, a local guide or going it alone, etc.  I'd say it was probably worth the price.",1189468800,12,456,4.2298850574712645

8195160,4,B000Q7ZOMG,"The quality of the video was great, and the visuals are beautiful.. The great thing is that most videos only hit one city, while this one hits three of the major cities.  I really enjoyed the piece on Florence, there were a lot of interesting tid-bits and side stories in there. Good stuff to know before you go...When are you making part two?",1182124800,8,343,4.444444444444445
