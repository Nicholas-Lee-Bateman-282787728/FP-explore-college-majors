2398187,5,B000AYNG0W,"I highly recommend this DVD for your kids.  I have three kids ages 18 months to 7 years, a girl and 2 boys, and they all love it!  My youngest son loves the animals and puppets.  My middle son focuses on the reptile show and the songs, and my eldest daughter aspires to be the lead girl and sings her heart out.  The video starts right into the action so my kids are hooked from the start. The story then moves quickly incorporting catchy tunes, animals, colorful characters with kids - all at a perfect pace to keep kids attention.  I like the messages of helping and sharing the DVD sends - the content is safe, kind and appropriate for kids. Our family loved the first DVD of the series and we just got out hands on this new one from a friend, and I am ordering more copies right now!  A definite buy - especially for the younger ones.",1130976000,6,838,4.20625
2398218,5,B000AYNG0W,"My nearly-two-year-old grandson loves movies about Elmo and Yo Gabba Gabba, but will pick this movie over the others every time.  It's cute, fun, the songs are great, and it's got interesting animals and colorful visuals.  I don't know -- maybe he likes the really cute singing star named Cocoa or the little dancing girl mice?  Regardless, he loves this movie!",1268179200,,361,4.885245901639344
2398219,4,B000AYNG0W,"This DVD is quite entertaining, and the songs are catchy, although the ones in the original Wheels on the Bus are a little better, I think.  Nonetheless, both my 2 year old and my 4 year old enjoy this video.  It has a neat segment with a reptile farm, and my kids like snakes.",1208736000,,277,4.111111111111111
2398220,5,B000AYNG0W,My grand daughter loves this DVD.  She also has volume 1 and we are anxiously awaiting the third DVD that should be out in January.  These are so educational and they teach values at the same time. It's definitely a 5 star product.,1194912000,,231,4.348837209302325
2398221,5,B000AYNG0W,"When I first watched this dvd with my son I did not think it was as good as the first. But my 20 month old son has made his decision, he loves it!!! This one teaches values  like sharing & the songs are fun to listen too. They definitely grow on you, give yourself some time esp  if you really liked the first dvd. We alternate bet the 2 dvds for my son so it is easier on us!!!!",1184630400,,379,3.7848101265822787
2398222,5,B000AYNG0W,"This is really an EXCELLENT EDUCATIONAL, WHOLESOME and FUN DVD! All the kids in my family enjoy it a lot and get to learn about important values in a very vibrant format!

Initially, I got the First Volume for my now two-year-old nephew (when he was one) and he IMMEDIATELY LOVED it. He also COMPLETELY FELL IN LOVE with the CD in this series too and he still enjoys listening to it.

I've already gotten several copies of both Volumes 1 and 2 for all the kids in my family and they don't seem to get enough of them! Now we're waiting for the THIRD Volume to come out!

I don't think you'll regret buying this DVD at all. Kids REALLY do enjoy it! You'd be giving any kid a great gift by exposing them to something very wholesome and constructive.",1184025600,,746,4.276595744680851
2398223,5,B000AYNG0W,"We love the music on this DVD! My four-year-old daughter knows every lyric and we sing it everywhere we go. (My year-old daughter hums ""The Wheels on the Bus"" constantly because of the video and that is pretty cute!) Roger Daltrey has done a wonderful job as the voice of Argon and Victoria Jackson is sooo cute as Moon Mouse. We have the first ""Wheels on the Bus"" with Mango and Papaya but I think we like this second one better, mostly because the music is so wonderful.",1145232000,2,472,4.375
2398224,3,B000AYNG0W,My son loved the first Mango and Papaya Wheels on the Bus. It is still his favorite.  He did not even want to watch the Moon Mouse one at first.  It has since grown on him and even my husband and I.  We still sing the songs from the first one though... ALL of the time!,1142985600,2,269,3.767857142857143
2398225,5,B000AYNG0W,"If your child loved the first ""Wheels on the Bus"", they'll have the same enthusiasm for this one. Our two-year old loves the song, does all of the motions, and even calmly got his first boy haircut with Mom and Grandpa singing the ""Yellow School Bus"" song with him.",1141862400,2,265,4.428571428571429
2398226,5,B000AYNG0W,This is an amazing video.  My two year old loves it.  A must have for all!!,1140912000,2,75,3.625
2398227,5,B000AYNG0W,"My children and their friends enjoyed this Video tremendously.

Our PTA purchased both ""The Wheels on the Bus featuring Mango,""

as an additional learning tool to their Core Curriculum.",1134864000,,185,5.344827586206897

8080941,5,B000AYNG0W,Great for young child. This series has entertained my son through his months of not being able to use his hands due to multiple surgeries. He loves this!,1361318400,,153,4.5
8080942,4,B000AYNG0W,"My son is in LOVE with this show. He'll be 2 soon. He started watching this less than a month ago. He asks to watch it every. Single. Day. All 3 videos are on Netflix.

FYI - - I hate this show. The music is so obnoxious- I'm not even that picky. Every adult I know that's seen this thinks the same. If you don't let your kids watch or play with certain things for the sake of your sanity, you're going to want to skip these. The songs stick in your head so you will be singing them in your sleep and the characters are nauseating. I didn't review based on adult appeal though.

There seems to be a lot more bad lip syncing with this video than the others.

This video has a visit to the grocery store - Whole Foods - that redeems the second video's ""Fill It Up"" song that made some bad food choices.",1352419200,3,800,4.018867924528302
8080943,5,B000AYNG0W,"My 2.5 year old son and I rented this movie from the library. He watched in constantly, so I decided to buy it for him. Cute movie for kids with great songs! Very pleased.",1350432000,,171,4.0588235294117645
8080944,1,B000AYNG0W,"Wholeheartedly agree with M.J. Howell,  just unbearable.  The lip-synching is deal breaker as is the awful green screened backgrounds.  Ms. Jackson's voice sounds the same as a mouse as it does as a spokesperson for the Tea Party, grating and intolerable, in my opinion.  [...]",1327104000,3,277,5.088888888888889
8080945,5,B000AYNG0W,"My just turned three year old cannot get enough of this series.  We got the boxed set of three dvds when it was still available.  He loves them all.  I like them because they teach him things (about animals, healthy eating, and social skills) and they are not too fast paced.  And they do not annoy me; some stuff (like Barney) I cannot handle over and over and over and over again but this one does not bother me.  My 8 year old will even sit and watch it with him; she likes it too.",1295913600,,484,4.052631578947368
8080946,1,B000AYNG0W,"This has to be the most excruciatingly painful kids' DVD I've seen in my 3 years of parenting. I am flabbergasted and flummoxed at the positive reviews from other parents. First and foremost, the audio is lip-synced throughout THE ENTIRE PROGRAM. Musicals use this device to control the quality of the audio during SONGS, but even the DIALOGUE was pre-recorded in the studio. I thought the disc was defective when I first saw it, but after watching the bonus features, it's clearly not (well, not defective in its mass production, anyway). The creepiest part of these videos are the bus scenes. It's like some existential nightmare. The non-speaking characters sit in their seats and mouth along with the pre-recorded nonsense they've heard God knows how many times in earlier takes, stare at the main characters while mouth-breathing, or stare at the production people obscured by the sets. Secondly, the lead girl tries to outdo Shirley Temple by grinning maniacally and staring at the camera like a mental patient. Thirdly, with the exception of Roger Daltrey's inclusion, the whole production has a depressing cheap atmosphere that is on the level of a good cable access show.
The entire thing is surreal and disturbing.
It is Sartre's ""No Exit"" with puppets. Hell isn't other people, Jean-Paul, hell is a Mango ""Wheels on the Bus"" DVD.",1275696000,8,1340,5.013452914798206
8080947,5,B000AYNG0W,"I have such a wide variety of DVDs for my daughter from Elmo to the Wonder Pets to Dora and everything in between.  These ""Wheels on the Bus"" videos are, by far, her favorite.  Initially she loved the song ""Wheels on the Bus"" so I did an Amazon search to see what they had for DVDs, CDs, or whatever I could get my hands on.  These DVDs popped up and I thought I would give them a try.  She has been so engrossed in these movies.  Elmo, Blue's Clues, and other previous ""faves"" of hers have quickly taken a back seat to these Wheels on the Bus movies since they are so entertaining.

As with most toddlers, she loves the singing, which never really stops throughout the entire flick.  As an adult, the Wheels on the Bus song (that never ends) can get a little annoying, especially since my daughter says ""'gain"" meaning ""again"" when the video is over.  So, here we go 'gain with the same video and the never-ending ""Wheels on the Bus"" song including the cheesy people bouncing around on the bus the entire time.  However, she loves these videos and therefore they are highly recommended for ANY toddler who loves songs, singing, or ""Wheels on the Bus"" in general.

By the way, if you live in Southern California (especially L.A. County) then you will especially appreciate any of the videos in the ""Wheels on the Bus"" series because each video pertains to something in Los Angeles county including the L.A. Zoo, the Aquarium of the Pacific, and other recognizable locations.  It makes it more special for those of us who live in L.A.",1273708800,,1533,4.498194945848375
