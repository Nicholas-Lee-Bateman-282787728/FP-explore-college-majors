Wendy: I thought that Wendy was the person that most people would understand. I felt like she was trying to hard to be a mother and a business women, I wanted to tell her that she had a husband who was a stay at home dad for a reason, she didn't need to give up hours at a job that needed her for things that the house-father should have handled. I also felt like her marriage was falling apart, she loved him but she treated him like he worked for her.

Nico: Most people dislike Nico because she was cheating on her husband, in her defense her husband was cheating on her with a college girl, whom he knocked up, and he was going to sue her for money for cheating when he had been for years, if it was like 4 years of cheating he must have started when his lover was barley 18.

I really loved Nico myself. I understood her, she loved work and it was her passion and her life. I'm a woman like that, my work comes first and everything and everyone else comes second and they know it. I think her dating a younger man was just what she needed, her worshiped her, understood the importance of her work, and he was there for her for just what she needed in a relationship, distance but romance.

I think she was the best friend, what she did to defend Wendy over and over, how she tried to help Victory with her own business. I would love to be around someone like Nico, it would great to have a friend who was like me.

Victory: I felt like the story could have done better if she would have just toned it down. I mean she was all over the place, kind of a hypo-critic, a real drama queen, and she acted like a spoiled child. I'm sorry but if I was failing money wise and a millionaire wanted to help me I would let him, even if he was my boyfriend because business and pleasure are different and I've dated people I work for and with and it never becomes a problem, Victory is just throwing a typical Victory fit.",1372636800,,2129,4.083732057416268
