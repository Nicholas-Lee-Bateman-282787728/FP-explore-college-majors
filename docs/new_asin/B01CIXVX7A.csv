7683533,1,B01CIXVX7A,"Okay, I actually have followed this series since the first real movie, except ""Family Vacation"" which is apparently too much of a clip show to bother, and I have become accustomed to the low quality animation and questionable character design. What can I say; I have a soft spot for animated canines.

But really, this is too much. Not only has the animation and the rendering deteriorated into something worth of 2001 Saturday morning TV. Not only does the story make precious little sense. No, the short film (43 minutes without credits) also manages to commit the deadly sin of being boring. For the first 30 minutes I suppressed the urge to press fast forward. After that, some rather pointless action scenes take over, ending in some sort of a climax that makes even less sense than the rest.

The plot? Kate and Humphrey move the family away from the nasty wilderness where rogue wolves tried to abduct the kids (in another episode). They migrate to wolfurbia, where a wolf real estate agent offers them a plastic cave with automatic lights, and Humphrey takes up golfing. I wish I were kidding. I am not; the episode has dropped any pretense of being about real wolves. The golfing part is probably the most logical one since it's the hobby of the two avian comic reliefs since the first movie. The rest... uuuh.

Why are there plastic caves? Two human gentlemen are trying to build a resort in the middle of nowhere on their ancestors' land to become rich. (The first thing they finished is the well-kept golf course and a bird-hypnotizing fountain, which tells a lot about their priorities.) To finance the resort building, they plan to unearth dinosaur bones from a sacred Indian burial ground and sell them to a museum. They also built the plastic caves into a real cliffside overlooking the golf course in an attempt to relocate wolves. (There are no other wolves around except the real estate agent, but who cares about details.) Sadly, their dino-digging efforts conjure up the incarnated spirits of two dinosaurs, a glaring pink colored cutified velociraptor-lookalike and a drab grey T-rex. (I would put in a spoiler warning, but they are on the DVD cover, so who cares.) The cubs discover the pink dinosaur; chase antics follow, until all plot points have been gracelessly choked to death.

If someone pulls out arbitrary topics out of a hat and makes a movie out of it, it probably looks like this. The plot elements make no sense at all (weren't Kate and Humphrey part of a large pack in all previous episodes?). The story - what little there is - is devoid of any interesting parts. There is no character development to speak of. Real world physics does not exist. The designs are lazy and ugly at the same time. I'd ask what the creators were smoking but the result is not even funny.

This thing is not just the low point of the series, it steps a whole level down from anything the previous parts delivered. I don't know what you will do; I will run away screaming from any further Alpha & Omega offers.

(Please don't tell me ""it's for the kids"". Kids are smart; no need to make them dumber with bad TV.)

(P.S. If you couldn't avoid the movie, give the following question a thought: What does really happen to the dinosaurs at the end of the film, inferring from what we saw earlier? ... Oopsie.)",1464652800,3,3321,4.647359454855196

7683543,1,B01CIXVX7A,"If zero stars were possible, that would be my rating. How anyone put money into making this convoluted mess I will never understand.

So, they are wolves....but are moving into a golf course made of plastic caves?! What? A sacred burial ground that resurrects dinosaur spirits? Where does the dancing water feature with birds come in??!!! Go to the light........Am I on drugs???? I wish I was making this up but that is the actual nonsense of this story (and I use that term loosely) .

The wolves look like dachshunds, the computer animation is awful, the literal poop jokes are crass (birds pooping in a wolf's face!?!)  and I want that 40 plus minutes of my life back.

My daughter, who LOVES wolves and the Alpha and Omega story couldn't justify this trainwreck.",1469491200,,766,4.6940298507462686

8753147,3,B01CIXVX7A,"They say that change is inevitable and after developing and animating five Alpha and Omega films for Lionsgate, Crest Animation Studios handed over the reigns to the series to Splash Entertainment somewhere before 2015.  Dino Digs is the first of the Splash era releases and stacks up as the franchises 6th entry (even though it was originally going to be the 7th).

Thanks to some rearranging of the release schedule, the film, originally announced on April 8, 2015 - (along with The Big Fureeze and Journey to Bear Kingdom) was set to be the seventh. However, Lionsgate decided to release the film before The Big Fureeze.  Richard Rich, who directed the previous sequels, was replaced with animation director Tim Maltby, while Tom Kane returned to write the script.

The film was released directly to DVD May 10, 2016.

While its tough to point a finger at precisely who is at fault, the general consensus is that Dino Digs is one of the worst entries to the entire franchise to date.  Admittedly, the whole concept of this one with time traveling dinosaurs from 65-millions year ago interacting with modern-day wolves does tend to suggest the writers were really scraping the bottom of the barrel for ideas; I will go on record as saying the formulaic nature of the Crest films preceding this one were getting quite repetitive as well.

The story this time tells of Kate and Humphrey deciding to move their family to a new high rise of caves, only to discover their ideal cave isn't even real. It turns out to be made of recycled material and located above a nearby golf course.

Claudette, Stinky and Runt go exploring and discover a sacred burial ground.  Naturally the trappers who have been after the clan for countless tellings are on the scene attempting to dig up the site. Its here that the pups meet Amy, a velociraptor that comes back to life when her immortal essence, somehow still tied to her bones is hit by lightning near the site.

Now the pups have to find a way to help Amy get back to her era and return home to the artificial cave before something terrible happens.  That is something more terrible than resurrecting the ghost of a 65-million year old raptor of course.

If you're looking for depth of story, Pixar-style cleverness, DreamWorks inspired humor or even a story that makes the slightest bit of logical sense, this isn't the film for you.  Splash Entertainment has been getting a bad rap since the films release for a dip in quality over the studio they replaced (Crest) but in all fairness, the animation and direction are hardly the films biggest detractors.  Rather, a convoluted and muddled plot linked to a by-the-numbers delivery and conclusion really don't do the characters here any favors.

About the biggest positive I can report is that when compared to the five sequels that preceded this one, at least Dino Digs feels a little different; a bit fresher if you will.  Recommending the film for sheer entertainments sake alone is extremely difficult but if instead, and like me, youve come this far with what started out as a pretty solid franchise, its hard to turn your back on it now.

Since the time of this reviews initial writing, the seventh entry to the series, The Big Fureeze, has been released, it should soon become apparent just how much of the blame for Dino Digs lackluster delivery falls on Splash Entertainments shoulders and how much is simply the result of source material that is being spread far too thin.
