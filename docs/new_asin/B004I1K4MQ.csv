4381755,4,B004I1K4MQ,"Kelly Canter (portrayed by Gwyneth Paltrow) is one of the biggest country music stars on the planet, and she's also struggling with many demons.  A year after a tragic (and very public) accident in Dallas derailed her career, Kelly has emerged from rehab, and is quickly sent back on the road by her husband-manager James (Tim McGraw).  James, who is now more Kelly's manager than husband, recruits a singing beauty queen named Chiles Stanton (Leighton Meester)  to join Kelly's ""Encore"" tour.  Kelly, enamored during her rehab stint with a musically talented intern named Beau Hutton (Garrett Hedlund), insists that he supports Kelly on the tour, as well.  James agrees, but only on the condition that Beau's role is sponsor first, musician second.  The complex layers of relationships among the main characters is the essence of 'Country Strong'.

All of the actors turn in very convincing performances, Hedlund's not the least among them.  Hedlund's turn as a gifted musician more in love with music than with the idea of fame is second only to Paltrow's authentic depiction of the troubled superstar.  McGraw gets better with every role that he receives, although his character range might be limited.  Meester's interpretation of the ""Country Barbie"" has legs, and healthy ones at that.  Her character was the most well developed in the film, start to finish.

As the writing goes, I found it to be a little sloppy.  The emotional pendulum swings so quickly and frantically among the characters, that it becomes difficult to get invested in even one of them, let alone all of them.  The story is not difficult to follow, but some instances of interaction are questionable, if not unbelievable.  There are also elements surrounding the film that even make it feel a little dated.  That said, I did find the pacing of the film to be solid and steady.  I also found the victories and defeats that the characters experience I found to be a plus for the movie.

The true strength of 'Country Strong' is the music that is woven throughout the fabric of the story.  The variety of country music sub-genres (from classic country to the current, dominant pop-style of country) are all great, and I consider myself a casual country music fan, at best.  The real tragedy is that not all of the songs in the film are on the official soundtrack.  Paltrow has at least three top-quality songs in the film, all of which she performs herself.  She sounds like someone who has been performing country her entire life.  Meester's ""Words I Couldn't Say"", which she also performs on her own, is potentially a #1 single for her.  It's really that good.  Overall, this might actually be an instance where the soundtrack will outlast the popularity of the movie it originates from.

'Country Strong' amounted to something of a predictable ending, but knowing the destination didn't make the journey any less worth taking for me.  As I type this, Rotten Tomatoes critics have this film at 17%.  I find this rating to be very unfair, and very harsh.  This is an entertaining film that will satisfy the majority of those who spend their money to see it.",1294531200,81,3132,4.845574387947269
4381756,3,B004I1K4MQ,"I went into this movie, feeling like I'd already seen it from the previews and for the most part that was true. There were missing pieces and one shocking ending, but mostly true.

I found it hard to like the characters save one and that was Chiles who was just so innocent. You felt pity for Kelly who I felt like in some way knew she wasn't ready but despite the title, she wasn't strong enough to make anyone listen. Beau is too busy being completely in love with her and James is too focused on trying to save what is left of her career and forget the past. To be completely honest, I think Beau was the character that I disliked the most and I can't exactly pinpoint why. I love Garrett Hedlund and I think he plays the part well, but something about his character rubbed me the wrong way. He's a jerk half the time to Chiles, only really nice to her when he's drunk. Then there is this constant pull you feel between him and Chiles while he's supposed to be having his affair with Kelly. He'll look at Chiles with the same puppy dog look of affection in his eyes that he looks at Kelly with. Now it's possible he can love them both but for different reasons. Perhaps he was initially attracted to Kelly because of who she was and all that she had accomplished and later it grew into a kind of protective, brotherly love. But with Chiles, maybe she just makes him feel alive and he likes how it feels not to have to constantly worry about what she's doing. But that's me just trying to make it sound okay in my head. But from where I'm standing, he's just as lost as everyone else with just as many issues. Hm, maybe that's the point. But there's just something about him that just...I don't know. He's that guy who can have something really good going for him and he'll mess it up on purpose, content to live in his self-created misery.

The ending...oh the ending. A previous reviewer called Kelly weak and I'm not sure I can agree with that statement. Every thing she did that night was planned. From her advice to what song she chose to sing last. Does it make her weak to want that? (It's hard trying to not give anything away). I've never been in that place where that character had to be so when it came down to it, I may not be /strong/ enough to do what she did. And never having been in that place, I can't even begin to imagine what her mental state was like. It took a lot of guts, in my opinion. Everyone one else were the weak ones because despite how much they all loved Kelly, they weren't strong enough to give her the strength she needed to make a different choice.

Her husband's motives are somewhat clear and somewhat cloudy. Sometimes you get the impression that he wants to get things back to the way they were so that he may distance himself from being her husband and solely be her manager. Sometimes it seems that he wants to save her reputation--he knows that she's not going to really come back, but he doesn't want her fans to remember her for the tragedy that had happened the previous year. He's torn between caring for her and trying to make things right for her professionally. In the end, I think that their relationship is too broken and that there's no way they could ever get back to how they were when they first fell in love. And he knows that too, which is why he focuses too much on her career.

Did I enjoy this movie? I'm not really sure. Overall, I felt like relationships (like Beau and Chiles) are so underdeveloped that the fact that it even exists in the film is an afterthought. For it to have been two hours long, I feel like they missed the mark on some things like that and spent too much time on other things. Beau and Chiles didn't have to have a relationship at all and the movie would have carried just the same without it--things like that.

I will probably buy this one just for Garrett Hedlund and the beautiful music. To watch the cast be on the stage and the light sparkling in their eyes, that's something right there. It makes you want to stand up and sing along at the top of your lungs and go out and buy a guitar, even if you have no idea how to play it.",1294444800,3,4125,4.2563775510204085
4381757,5,B004I1K4MQ,"I seem to be in a minority, but I thought this was a superb movie, a great start to 2011 (countering what Rebecca Murray said about the movie). Was it the greatest movie of all time? Not by a long shot, no. But it accomplished what it set out to do: it told a great story, showcased great performances both dramatically and musically.

While Paltrow may take first-billing, and while her musical numbers are phenomenal, to me it is Beau and Chiles (Hedlund and Meester) who this movie is really about.",1294444800,85,501,4.5054945054945055
4381758,3,B004I1K4MQ,"""Country Strong"" is a fairly reliable celebrity drama, although it's not particularly original and it would have worked a lot better were it not for an unearned, shamelessly soapy ending. What surprised me was that I couldn't take the ending at face value. To be perfectly blunt, it made me angry. The events of the film don't build to this particular kind of conclusion, but more to the point, it made me rethink my feelings for the character involved, and not in a positive way. But I'm getting way ahead of the story; what builds up to the ending is standard relationship melodrama, a love triangle between an emotionally unstable country superstar, her conniving husband, and the honky-tonk hunk she has been having an affair with. There's also the up-and-coming singer who was once a beauty queen.

It tells the story of Kelly Canter (Gwyneth Paltrow), an alcoholic country singer whose drinking led to a tragic accident. At the start of the film, she's prematurely taken of rehab by her husband/manager, James (Tim McGraw), who pressures her into embarking on a tour across Texas. As one observes the situation over the course of the film's 112 minutes, one cannot help but feel that James' motives have more to do with punishing his wife than with resurrecting her career. This isn't to suggest he lumbers into every scene with a big, evil scowl on his face. He channels his resentment professionally, setting her up with press conferences and interviews. For the most part, he keeps his emotions to himself, although there is a telling moment at a Make a Wish appearance; after dancing with Kelly for a moment, he breaks away from her, exits the room, and then starts crying in the hallway. His anger is understandable. His methods, however, are cruel and manipulative.

Meanwhile, Kelly and James are accompanied by Kelly's lover, Beau Hutton (Garrett Hedlund), and Chiles Stanton (Leighton Meester), who wants to break into the county music scene. The former is a singer/songwriter who frequents dives, has a loyal following, and cares for the art of song more than the idea of fame. He met Kelly when he was working as an orderly while she was in rehab. He tags along under the preposterous notion that he's Kelly's sponsor. The latter is the young, idealistic beauty whose eyes sparkle with dreams of stardom. Beau describes her look as Country Barbie, and I kid you not, she takes that as a compliment. She's talented, but her reliance on her outward appearance is merely a coping mechanism for deep insecurities that stem from childhood. She knows of no other way to get attention other than looking beautiful.

Beau and Chiles initially walk that fine line between antagonism and attraction, but rest assured, their relationship goes to the next level. This strikes me as somewhat odd, since it's obvious that he cares deeply for Kelly. It is, after all, he who calls James out on the pills he gave to Kelly. And rescued Kelly from a bar during a particularly bad relapse. And broke down the door to Kelly's dressing room at a crucial moment. Is it possible that this movie is really about a man who loves two women for different reasons? I hesitate to think the screenplay probes that deep. The actors all give decent performances, and yet they play little more than caricatures, and the drama on which the story is founded is so heightened that the whole thing comes off as a two-hour soap opera.

The title refers to a state of mind; Kelly is told that she can do anything because she's country strong, which I guess is somehow different from general strength. It doesn't matter - the ending makes it abundantly clear that she possesses absolutely no strength, country or otherwise. This character seriously let me down; I felt like a boy whose parent reneged on a promise to be at his baseball game. I also felt cheated, since the events of the film gave no indication that its conclusion would be the only appropriate one. So far as I can tell, the ending was included merely as a way to create more drama.

To give writer/director Shana Feste some credit, her casting choices were spot on. This is evident in both the performances and in the actors' singing voices; Paltrow in particular owns every song she sings, pretty much to the point that it's a mystery why she hasn't pursued a career in singing or musical theater. Hedlund is also a convincing singer - perhaps this movie is his apology for ""Tron: Legacy."" Even so, the film is overwrought, predictable, sappy, and contrived, and it ends on a note sour enough to leave a bad taste in anyone's mouth. Was there no other way to bring this story to a close? How did Feste come to believe that ""Country Strong"" needed that particular turn of events? The more I try to figure out what she meant by including it, the more confused and annoyed I become.",1294272000,10,4825,4.725653206650831

4381769,5,B004I1K4MQ,"This film is a sleeper hit.  I really loved the music, storyline, and terrific acting. The four main characters all did a great job.  I'm so glad this film was made. The script was written and directed by a woman who graduated from UT Austin--my school!  The songs are terrific--the actors really can sing and entertain.  I'd love to see them do a real live show with these songs. I've been around musicians in TX for over 30 years. Somehow this film caught the truth and pain of what happens in their personal and professional lives perfectly.  For a low budget film--15 million, it grossed 20 million at the box office--this was a project everyone involved can be very proud of . It will live on for a long time since it has heart, humor, honesty, and great acting. You can't beat the songs.  I will buy the DVD and the soundtrack soon. It ends sadly, but with a note of hope and courage. This film will inspire anyone who wants to find love, be an artist, and have a life of meaning.  You won't leave this film without feeling moved.

Well, I have one word......AMAZING! The movie was great from beginning to end.  It does have a lot of sad and dark moments but it also has a lot of beautiful moments that takes your breath away.  The chemistry with the characters/actors and the absolutely amazing acting of Tim, Gwyneth, Garrett and Leighton made me believe every single minute of each storyline in the movie.

Also, on another review I read, a recovering alcoholic praised Gwyneth with her spot on acting.  That says a lot about the writers and their research for the storylines to stay as true to real life as possible if someone that has lived it said how they can relate to her character.

There are many lessons to learn from this movie and if you don't love it then there is something seriously wrong with you.

Just to make sure, I am not a fan of Gyneth Paltrow, but as seeing this movie I was deeply moved by her acting so deep that I almost felt in love with her.
I felt the spot all the way from the movie that I couldn't shut down the movie till the ending credit was all gone.
This was a one hell of a ride!

A country singer star a alcholic tries to regain her fame with her husband / manager. The manager already got this younger version singer who is so charming and got a voice of an angel so sexy that people are all crazy about her already.

Now she is all alone, she only got this other singer who is yearning her but just sees her from a distance.

She is alone in the dark.
What shall she do?
Go back to alchole and mess up her life?
No one helps her but herself.
But life ain't easy you know?
Only drugs- sleeping pills is her friend.

After trying to be on the stange a couple of times they all failed.
She tried to sing but all she did was cried in front of her audiences.
She just coudn't help it.

Now that it is her last chance.

Her atmost admirer and the new comer singer even asks her how come you be such a great singer back then.
She says something like good words to her.
Well come on you stole my seat already. Even my husband's heart by stealing my song which was supposed to be my song.

Then it is finally my chance to sing on stage. If this time I fail I won't be able to sing again in public.

She goes to the stage.
She sings.
It was magical.
She was a true diva!
The new comer girl was speecheless!
The husband was almost cry for joy.
The male singer the admirer was joy with tears.
She re gains her fame finally!!
Then this became her last seeing the light on stage.
She overdose the pills.

Life ain't easy out there you know.

Just keep on going don't stop.
If you stop? It will not be easy to re-begin.",1473638400,2,1908,3.9324675324675327
4381838,2,B004I1K4MQ,I knew absolutely nothing about this movie before renting it to watch. Let me just say that this movie is depressing!!! I wasn't sure if I would be able to finish it because it seemed like it started out dark and just kept getting darker by the minute. I generally love Gwyneth movies but this one was a 0/5 for me. I gave it two stars because I did like the singing/songs but that's about all I liked.,1473638400,,402,4.166666666666667

I had no idea she could sing like that! I don't think anyone did. And the other actors were terrific, again singing, acting and making you ""believe"" every single line in the film.

Tim McGraw was perfect as the heavy-handed yet emotional manager / husband and showed so much emotion just in his eyes or his face, without a word being said. It was incredible. And even though the story had some terrible endings, it had a happy ending too. I won't say anything more so as not to give away the storyline, but no wonder I like to see it again and again.",1467504000,2,704,4.333333333333333

4381908,2,B004I1K4MQ,"All the characters in this film are a mess! What a downer. At least one of them sort of has things figured out, and another finally chooses rightly in the end. But gosh this was tough to watch. I was expecting an uplifting movie, and got the opposite.

22% Rotten Tomatoes rating based on 130 reviews. From Wikipedia: ""The critical consensus is: 'The cast gives it their all, and Paltrow handles her songs with aplomb, but Country Strong's cliched, disjointed screenplay hits too many bum notes.' ""

According to Wikipedia,  ""American pop singer Britney Spears inspired Paltrow's character in the film."" Britney Spears.. not exactly a pillar of stability. This will give you some idea of what Paltrow's character is like.

The film was written and directed by a woman named Shana Feste, who was employed as the nanny of Tobey Maguire while working on the screenplay. Not to sound mean, but Feste should have stayed a nanny.

I'm giving the film two stars instead of one because Paltrow's acting was great as usual, and she sang decently. The whole cast is rather good. Tim McGraw.. I didn't even know that guy could act. I was impressed. Oh yeah, I saw in him ""The Blind Side."" Not a bad performance in that film either. Garrett Hedlund and Leighton Meester (never seen or heard of these people before, and I watch a lot of movies) both did well too.

The other reason I'm giving this film two stars is I thought the music was pretty good, even though I'm not a country fan. You might be wondering why, if I'm not a country fan, I watched this film. Good movies are good movies. I'm not into sports either, but I've liked sports movies when they've been good.

I was hoping this movie would be something I would like. It wasn't. Not because it was about country music though, I didn't like it because I felt worse while watching it and after I'd finished it than before I'd started it.

Watch it if you are having just too good a day and want to bring yourself down.",1454198400,,1966,4.51830985915493

4381954,5,B004I1K4MQ,"Definitely worth the watch.  Great music sung the actors themselves & it's very impressive.  Gwyneth does a fab job but the standout song is ""Give in to me"" sung by Leighton & Garrett.  Garrett Hedlund has you believing he is a good ol' country boy & I was totally impressed with him & thought he was a real country artist.  The story line & characters turn in ways you aren't expecting.  Certainly not one of those after the first few minutes you know exactly how it will play out.

4382144,5,B004I1K4MQ,"Gwyneth Paltrow is of course gorgeous and Tim McGraw is well cast in his ""non singing"" role (he does sing a duet with Paltrow in the trailer and extras footage). The plot is heart rending despite being relatively simplistic. The glue that holds this movie together and makes it worth watching, perhaps more than once, are the Songs and the supporting actors who sing them.  I'm surprised that these songs haven't received airtime on mainstream radio.  There's little doubt that the television series NASHVILLE got it's inspiration from this.  If you like movies heavily oriented towards the music, in this case Progressive Country, you'll love this.",1381708800,,649,5.10377358490566
4382145,5,B004I1K4MQ,Great movie and actors and actresses.  Entertaining and not boring at all.  Will recommend this movie to family and friends for sure!,1381708800,,133,5.0
4382146,5,B004I1K4MQ,"I remember that I ruled out having any interest in seeing this movie when I saw the trailer in the theaters, as I'm not a country music fan.  However, I just happened to run across it when it came on one of our premium movie channels, and I decided to give it a shot.  First off, I'll offer that the ""country"" music in the movie is done - in my opinion - in a style that is at least half-way toward pop music, allowing it to appeal to those who aren't country music fans.  From a marketing perspective, this is pure genius - I absolutely love the soundtrack of songs played in the movie (side note: the music in the movie is spread out over TWO sound track CDs, sold separately, and all the songs on those CDs that are NOT in the movie are truly, purely country music).  As for the movie, wow - it blew me away - it was entertaining with the music, but has a serious and dark element to it as well.

A few words about the cast.  I won't comment on the characters, so as to not give any of the plot away, but I will discuss the actors/actresses.  Tim McGraw - it's really hard to not like Tim - he just has a natural charisma about him, no matter what kind of person the character he plays is.  Gwyneth Paltrow - the movie's main character - she's tremendously talented, as her many accolades attest to, and SHE SINGS - no voice-overs or lip synching in this movie!!!  Leighton Meester - I would consider her the converse of Gwyneth in this movie, in that Gwyneth is a great actress who can sign well, Leighton is a very good singer who can act well.  I really like Leighton in this movie; she got to flex her acting skills more in the movie than any other in which I've seen her, especially the ability to show vulnerability in a very convincing way.  Garrett Hedlund - in my humble opinion, Garrett stole the show!  He can not only act well (also showing genuine vulnerability), he can sing country music as well as anybody out there.  (As I watched the movie the first time, I wondered whose voice Garrett was lip synching over, only to learn that he was actually doing the singing himself!)  Apart from the solo's in the movie, he and Leighton did a duet of the first half of Garth Brooks' Friends in Low Places, which I really, really like (no disrespect to Garth - he's a legend - but his version is a bit two twangy for me in how he sings it).  Unfortunately, this song does not appear on either of the two soundtracks; despite that, this movie is a treasure trove of great songs.

One bit of warning: this is not a glitz at the top of show business, rah rah, feel-good type of movie.  It has some really good acting and very good singing/music in it, and the plot moves very well.  However, at its core, it is a serious movie that reflects on some of life's greatest joys and most painful realities.

In sum, I loved this movie - one of my all-time favorites.  If you get it, I hope you will enjoy it as well!",1381363200,7,2916,4.210431654676259

While the supporting cast was pleasant enough, I thought Gwyneth Paltrow gave a superb performance, portraying the main character in all her brilliance, fragility and complexity incredibly well.

The cover is about as enjoyable as this movie gets: singing, smiling, dancing.  Right, Gwyneth barely cracks a smile and barely sings until near the end and then, the cheering crowd noise covers much of it up and the goofy choreography and outfits really distracts from it.  And why not let Tim McGraw loose to really sing(actually his acting is surprisely good but the script is not).

I'm sorry.  I'm sorry; I'm unloading here, and I'm going to get blasted for my downer review, but what a disappointment.  I really like the actors, and I don't necessarily expect a happy ending **Spoiler alert** Goodness, if you're going to kill off Gwyneth's character and really soap it up, at least give her a decent death scene.**End Alert**

4382200,2,B004I1K4MQ,"Recently released from a rehab facility, Kelly (Paltrow) is essentially the Nashville Lindsay Lohan.  A drunk, pill-popper.  Pretty much exactly like Lohan, except more pretentious and irritating.  Anyway, she limps through a comeback to Grammy-level music, despite the fact she's less talented than Dewey Cox and her singing voice is similar to Marlee Matlin's.  While managing to alienate her husband (Tim McGraw), cheat on with with her rehab sponsor, struggling singer Beau (Garrett Hedlund), and embarrass herself in front of one of the few disillusioned fans she has left - Chiles Stanton (Leighton Meester), another up-and-coming country artist - she also manages to make viewers, those of her country performances and most who watched the movie, dislike her immensely.

Hedlund and Meester provide the best performances, impersonating country singers quite well.  I've been to The Stage on Broadway in Nashville, and while it's certainly more crowded than portrayed in the movie, Hedlund sounds like someone who could play there regularly.  Tim McGraw once again turns in a nuanced performance, even though the source material is right in his wheelhouse.  A lot was made of Paltrow actually singing in the film, but the singing ends up being very unimpressive, which is consistent with the rest of her performance.  And frankly, most of her movies.  She was at most the third best singer on screen, and that's only because McGraw never dropped a note.  In a sort of schadenfreudian way, I enjoyed disliking Paltrow in this movie, but it's still not as good as her role in Se7en, but that's because her head ends up in a box and we don't have to listen to her condescending tone and self-righteous thoughst.

The title is very misleading, and anyone looking for strength in this film should look elsewhere.  Just like the stereotypical country song, this is a sob-in-your-beer, love-triangle tale missing only the hound dog, the decrepit pickup, a case of Natty Lite, and actual, believable emotion.",1351123200,,2006,5.154320987654321

4382205,1,B004I1K4MQ,"I think I was ovulating by the closing scenes -- one of the most estrogen-soaked movies I've ever seen.  The role of the two lead men in the movie is to fawn over the two women, neither of whom is close to being worthy (for different reasons), although Paltrow has righteous stems and makes good use of short dresses and high heels to show them off.  Tim McGraw, as Paltrow's suffering husband/business manager, proves that as an actor, he can furrow his brow with concern.  Garrett Hedlund, the younger lead male, does an impersonation of Hayes Carll that turns funny, bad-ass Hayes into a wimp.  I'm sure Hayes went out and got drunk after watching this awful flick.

The songs were great and who knew Gwenyth could sing!  She has a great voice as does the rest of the cast.  I appreciate a movie with ""extras"" such as alternate endings and interviews with the cast and crew.  I did not think it drug on as someone had said.  The cast was well picked and played to perfection.  No, it wasn't a blockbuster, yet some of the ones they deam ""Blockbusters"" today I would not pay to see even if it was free.  Some of the better movies are ones you just ""stumble on to"".  Goes to show that everyone has different tastes!  That is what makes the world such an eclectic place!

4382209,4,B004I1K4MQ,"I was surprised that I really liked this movie.  The story is a bit disjointed, and the complexity of the relationship between Paltrow's and McGraw's characters isn't clear.  There could have been more dialogue to help us understand what brought this country star to alcohol and drug abuse, which obviously predated the major emotional block in their marriage.  I also wasn't sure about the significance of the bird, but perhaps a second viewing would clear that up.  I was blown away by Paltrow's performance, which had raw emotion, nuance, and multiple emotional layers.  I thought she did a great job of playing a person successful in her career, but not living up to whom she wanted to be personally.  In the end, her career mattered more to her husband than to her, and that's what he failed to understand.

I also enjoyed the equally strong acting and singing performances of Meester and Hedlund.  The music in this film alone makes it worth a viewing, and the film asks an important question about the price of fame and the damage it seems to do to marriages and love.",1340323200,,1075,4.711229946524064

4382215,1,B004I1K4MQ,"Country Strong has earned its place amongst America's worst films.  Seriously, when this film had the opportunity to take viewers on a country music hayride; someone, presumably the director, elected to make it as depressing as possible.  The other problem is that for some reason that is lost to me as a movie viewer, Gwyneth Paltrow chooses to take on the most depressing characters there are.  After watching so many of these kinds of films starring Paltrow, I had, because of the title Country STRONG, thought, hey, maybe this one is different; unfortunately not.  Paltrow's character never conveys to the audience a sense of what is so bad that she cannot overcome it; and at the point when you think the script is going to move in the right direction, it turns out to be the biggest let down.  Here's hoping that Paltrow takes on some projects that allow her to be a brighter and happier character, because at this point I am beginning to think she takes these roles because they require no acting effort on her part; and that is worrisome.",1335484800,,1046,4.693989071038251

4382218,4,B004I1K4MQ,"I don't think you even have to like country music to enjoy this movie, you just have to like music!  I have to admit, this is not my favorite movie of all time, but I definitely enjoyed it enough to buy it.  Gwyneth Paltrow has a beautiful voice, and she's a superb actress, though she was awkward in some of her onstage performances.  Leighton Meester, who I have seen in Gossip Girl, also has a nice voice, and she was convincing in her portrayal of a naive, country ""barbie doll"" who falls in love with a fellow singer/songwriter played by Garrett Hedlund.  Garrett has already started to pave the way as the man to watch in young Hollywood, having acted films like Death Sentence, Friday Night Lights, Four Brothers, and Tron, which came out around the same time as Country Strong.  Garrett Hedlund was amazing in this film!  Tim McGraw lent his cabin to Garrett, who was not a professionally-trained singer, to learn to play the guitar.  He had six months of lessons, and what you see on the screen is simply, for lack of a better word, amazing.  He has a low, country strong voice, that has become my favorite on the CD.  In a movie, where the only thing lacking was a better script, these stars definitely shined.  Of course, last but not least, Tim McGraw, who played the husband to Gwyneth's character, was dynamic; he's just a natural on screen.  He and Garrett first met on the set of Friday Night Lights, where Tim played Garrett's controlling, mean-spirited father.  Knowing Tim's work though, I spent the whole movie wishing he would sing!  His voice was definitely missed, but on the CD, he and Gwyneth share a duet.  All in all, is was a tragic portrayal of a life spinning out of control in the harsh light of fame.  <The movie has 2 Soundtrack CDs.  Both are worth the money!>",1331596800,3,1794,4.524844720496894

I'm not suggesting it's a one star movie, I was torn between rating it 3 or 4 stars, actually, because of all the good things it has going for it.  I don't think many people will watch this and consider it to have been a complete waste of time - I certainly didn't, and in truth I enjoyed watching it.

4382240,5,B004I1K4MQ,"Song ""Give In To Me"" sang by Garrett Hedlund, actor in the Country Strong movie, is a 5 star performance!  I have watched and re-watched this movie, basically to be able to not only hear Garrett Hedlund sing all his songs, but OMG ... WATCH him sing. What an awesome performance and man he is so beautiful! (I know men don't like beautiful, but sorry .. he is!  I realize now he doesn't usually sing country music as a career choice, but I am an avid Country Music listener and I would GO BUY anything he sang on a record.  His voice his so moving!  In more ways than I'll explain on a public posting board.  I'll just say ... why hasn't anyone in Nashville gotten with this handsome young talented singer and give him a record deal?  Why not get him to develop Hedlund a country single with the awesome ""Give In To Me"" or anything else he sings?
I listened to Faith Hill's singing the song version of ""Give In To Me"" and man ... she sucked, big time.  She totally ruined the song and I'm amazed that she is advertising it as her ""BIG COMEBACK!""  Someone needs to let her know that she needs to get another song.  I typically enjoy Faith's songs, but she blew it singing that after thousands of people fell in love with Garrett Hedlund singing that ""Give In To Me!""  Geez, it was even partially played on the Today show!  Millions of hits on the internet, great going Garrett, you could NOT have done any better!  I can watch you sing that songs over and over and over.  I will just say, the CD that was re-done by the pro singers after the movie was a great disappointment!  I think the Country Industry made an error having the CD produced by people NOT in the movie singing the songs.  Gweneth, Garrett and Leighton did excellent performances and that SHOULD BE the soundtrack, not the revised version.  Believe me, people have purchased the Soundtrack CD, thinking it was done by the actual movie performers, only to be disappointed and aggravated by ""who the hell is singing this?""

4382243,5,B004I1K4MQ,"As a recovering alcoholic myself, I was skeptical of how Gwyneth Paltrow's character would be depicted.  That said, I don't think there could have been a more accurate portrayal of how alocholism/addiction works: the downward spiral; the insanity; the change in personality; the fact that even if life is going well and looking up (e.g., at the end of the film), this disease will sneak right up on you and bring you back down with it.  Many people believe that the main struggle in Paltrow and McGraw's marriage is his desire for her to only be a mega-star, but what I see is a man who fell deeply in love with his wife long ago and has deep wounds from her alcoholic misdeeds.  McGraw (and the writers) portrays this facet of anyone who has ever been in love with an alcoholic/addict so well-you can see the love he has for her in his eyes but he always pulls away, afraid to be confronted again with a wife he doesn't know (the alcoholic).  Her past misdeeds have changed him in mahy ways and I think the movie and the actors portray that EXCELLENTLY.

I had already heard Gwyneth's ""Country Strong"" single and knew that if the rest of the music lived up that level, it would be an awesome soundtrack and it didn't disappoint. Leighton Meester and Garrett Hedlund have great voices and more of the songs from the movie should have been left to be performed by them.

Meester and Hedlund also give strong performances-she is much deeper than at first glance, reminding us to never judge a book by its cover.  Hedlund is the kind of guy you always root for, who sticks to what he feels in his soul and doesn't back down from his beliefs.  He's a man true to his heart.

This isn't just a movie about country music and superstardom as it seems from the cover.  I highly reccommend it!!",1315872000,5,1785,4.464615384615384

4382248,5,B004I1K4MQ,"I have no idea why so many critics, paid to provide insight, fail to see the mix of beauty and tragedy in this movie.  If I based my decision to watch Country Strong on what they said I'd have missed out on a remarkable film, rich in many many ways.  I'm not a diehard country music, Tim McGraw or Gwyneth Paltrow fan; nor am I a big movie goer or DVD watcher.  I am, however, a recovering alcoholic/addict and, from that perspective, this movie is one of the best of its kind.  For those in recovery (even those in AFG & similar groups), this portrayal will hit you in the heart.  For those who know someone in recovery, this movie has the potential to add understanding to what it's like to be in the grips of a death-threatening disease (fame aside, there's plenty of everyday Kelly Canters in the world).  For those who have no direct or indirect link to alcoholism, you are bound to appreciate life all the more by the movie's end.

From a purely moviegoer perspective, in my opinion, Country Strong is genuine to the core.  There's no better example of some people being true to themselves and some not.  Paltrow should get an award for this performance, if not at least nominations to several.  The young actors Garrett Hedlund and Leighton Meester give it their all and it shows.  (pay close attention to Hedlund's lines - lots of wisdom there).

If I were to have any criticism of this film (and only bittersweet at worst), it would be casting Tim McGraw in it.  A number of actors could have played Canter's husband to much better effect (absolutely no offense to the trillions of McGraw fans out there). Then again, if he drew more to see the movie, all the better.  I still say stick to the music, Tim - you're a master at that!

With so many in the entertainment industry flocking into rehab, it would be hard to believe this movie doesn't (sadly) resonate with the actual reality of some of their stories.  If someone told me a Loretta Lynn or Patsy Cline caliber singer had the same struggles Kelly Canter does, I wouldn't be surprised in the least.

4382252,4,B004I1K4MQ,"How many more stories are there out there about famous music or movie stars who fall victim to substance abuse and destroy careers/  Well, here's another.  But this time the story remains low key, in part because of the quality of the actors involved, and the theme of 'what is more important, fame or love'? manages to hold on throughout this overly long film.  Shana Feste both wrote and directed this story of a life gone sour and the effects that has on those who care about her.

Kelly Canter (Gweneth Paltrow) is a country singer superstar who has a problem with alcohol and drugs and carries with her the devastating loss of her unborn child due to a fall during a concert in Dallas some years back.  She is married to her manager James (Tim McGraw) who struggles with Kelly's addiction, consents to rehab where she meets young Beau Hutton (Garrett Hedlund), an aspiring country singer and talented songwriter,  but James pulls her out early to that she can make a comeback after a series of embarrassing flubbed shows.  James seems more obsessed with Kelly's career than with her emotional stability.  Once out  Kelly and Beau continue seeing each other and because of his talent Beau is added to the Kelly's tour as an opening act.  Along for the ride is a naive ex-beauty queen Chiles Syanyon (Leighton Meester) who idolizes Kelly and strives to get an audition with the famous diva. James hears her, invites her along as an audience pleaser, but on the tour, Beau and Chiles become involved: Beau just want to sing his songs to little bar crowds who love music and plans to move  to California, asking Chiles to join him.  But Chiles is star struck and opts for following in Kelly's advice and tracks until a tragedy occurs and alter the lives of Beau, Chiles, James, and the country music fans.

The moral seems to be that love and work can't make good bedfellows and the story seems out to prove that.  The plot gets a bit sappy towards the end but the film itself is salvaged by the singing of Garrett Hedlund and Leighton Meester.  Paltrow offers some of her own songs, but oddly enough the true country star - Tim McGraw - never  sings!  There are some strong performances in this tearjerker - from each of the four leads.

4382255,3,B004I1K4MQ,"I'm all for this revitalization of Gwyneth Paltrow's career.  I adore her 90's work and find her recent stint on `Glee' as well as her comeback to film (and departure into music) to be wholly welcome and something I can't get enough of.  Paltrow is a true talent; a shining star and I'm so happy that she's made her way back to us.  While `Country Strong' as a film is very flawed, her performance within is noteworthy for its honesty and earnest quality.

I just wish she had been handed a better script.

`Country Strong' tells the story of wayward Kelly Canter; Grammy winning country star and public drunk.  The film opens with Kelly in rehab sparking fires with Beau, an orderly who loves to sing and play his guitar.  Kelly is ripped from rehab by her manager/husband who insists that she go back out on the road to rebuild her public figure after an `incident' in Dallas left her name tattered.  At his wife's request, her husband James allows Beau to join her tour (not after some begrudging) as well as a former beauty queen named Chiles.  On the road, relationships form and crumble under the pressure of fame and fortune and the true colors of those involved begin to come through.  It is Kelly, though, who suffers the brunt as her troubles with drinking, not fully under control, begin to interfere with her comeback tour.

While the first half makes a tad more sense than the second, the second half isn't bogged down by the ridiculous dialog, so I'm kind of torn as to which half works the best.  It's hard because if I were looking at this as a senseless summer blockbuster then I may react differently to the prose, but when you are this dark and manipulative in your themes then you kind of have to have a sliver of realism in order to back up your direction, and that is something that `Country Strong' just doesn't get.  At its heart, it is trying to make a point that is too extreme.

Life isn't always this melancholy.

As a whole, `Country Strong' survives because of some real talented actors/singers who make the most of their scarcely developed characters in order to bring us something we want to continue watching.  Paltrow is magnificent as Kelly, who is arguably the most fleshed out of the characters.  She understands the shading needed to make Kelly feel alive, although the repetitive dynamics of the script dampen her chances to shine as brightly as she could have had her character been given more to work with.  I've been impressed with Tim McGraw's performances in the past (I still stand behind my belief that he should have be Oscar nominated for `Friday Night Lights') and he does a commendable job here, although I don't think he layers James in a way that makes him come off as anything other than a creep.  Garrett Hedlund is a little clichd in his portrayal of Beau, but his vocal talent is undeniable, and he finds chemistry with both Paltrow and Meester that is delightful to watch.  Speaking of Meester, I was really impressed with her spunky yet guarded portrayal of Chiles.  She really made her feel three-dimensional.  She also breathes a life into the film, a sort of jovial atmosphere that counteracts the films more bleak themes.

The ending, while on the outset anti-clichd, is a tad predictable, but the actors sell it (for the most part).  Still, the main highlight here is the music, all of which is kind of wonderful.  The songs written for this film are beautiful, especially the big `Coming Home' number and the intimate `Timings Everything', which opens the closes the film perfectly.  I think that Shana Feste has talent as a director and writer, but like her previous work (`The Greatest') she hasn't mastered developing her themes in a way that feel truly authentic.  They feel like fabrications, like movies with a slight soap operatic twist that takes them out of the realm of `gritty, raw and real' and makes them feel somewhat fake.  But, a total plus is the way she works with her actors, and with time I have faith that she can produce something truly noteworthy.

But if you do anything, buy the soundtrack!",1311120000,6,4079,4.642061281337047

""Country Strong""
(Sony Pictures, 2011)
-------------------------------------
Though generally compelling, this movie is dramatically split between its strengths and its flaws.  It's a meditation on fame -- the intense, instantaneous, under-the-magnifying-glass, hothouse fame of the modern era -- set against the backdrop of the contemporary Nashville country music scene. Its strengths are in its presentation of how that fame feels to the performers under the spotlight - the overwhelming rush of applause, the blinding lights, the prying reporters, and how those intense emotions can both seduce and terrify those with talent.

Gwyneth Paltrow plays a Martina McBride/Sara Evans-level country superstar wrestling with alcoholism and self-doubt; Leighton Meester is an up-and-coming, radio-ready pretty girl who is her rival in more ways than one.  Meanwhile, Garrett Hedlund plays Paltrow's rough-hewn, Waylon-esque protegee, a simple country guy who lives for the music, man, and not the fame. This is where the film falters: although the characters have unexpected ambiguities and flaws and the script takes some interesting turns, the dialogue is just terrible, full of leaden, naked exposition, where the plot is constantly explained to us in the most over-obvious terms: ""Honey, you can't make that bad decision because then you will lose your dream and everything you ever worked for.""  That kind of thing.  Hedlund's character is the weakest link in the film - he's pure and uncompromised, a talented musician poised on the brink of fame, but with clear enough vision to see how celebrity and show biz politics chews people up and spits them out; he'd rather keep singing in bars rather than go for the brass ring, even when fame is given to him on a silver plate.  It might look good on paper, but rings a bit false when seen on screen.

Nonetheless, this movie is better than many other entries in the somewhat-thin genre of country music dramas -- not as gritty as ""Crazy Heart"" or ""Coal Miner's Daughter,"" but better produced than, say, ""Songwriter"" or ""Honeysuckle Rose."" Overall, I'd guess that this is a fairly accurate portrayal of what it's like behind-the-scenes on a modern country tour, with a few extra layers of melodrama on top.  Throughout, the made-for-the-movie music is top-notch, a completely convincing mix of revamped outlaw/honkytonk music and bombastic, hi-tech Nashville pop: any song in this film could easily be a radio hit. It's an okay movie, with some forced dialog and schmaltzy, on-the-nose plot points, but still with real country soul.  Worth checking out... I'd give it a 3.5 if I could.

4382261,4,B004I1K4MQ,"Kelly Canter ( Gwyneth Paltrow) is a country music superstar who has been pulled out of rehab early by her pushy husband manager ( Tim Mcgraw) to go on a comeback tour of sorts. Kelly is not eager because she is still recovering not just from alcohol addiction but also from a devastating tragedy. She does, however reluctantly agree only if she has Beau Hutton, a man with whom she is having a affair ( Garett Hedlund) as a supporting act on the tour. As her husband tries to put together the tour, we get a glimpse at the sad and lonely lives of these superstars and generally life of a band on the road.
There are a couple of scenes which are amazing, 1. The singing in classroom at the Make- a -Wish Foundation event.
2. Gywneth Paltrow, giving advice in the dressing room to Meester (Chiles Stanton) towards the end of the film.
3. The look on the face of Garett Hedlund as he reacts to the crowd cheering the rising star Chiles.
I heard a lot of criticisms of this movie; however I found the movie interesting and well acted. Each of the main characters gives some fine performances, Tim Mcgraw is excellent,trying to fulfill his dual roles as manager and husband, Garett Hedlund and Leighton Meeser  are good.  Gwyneth Paltrow still looks amazing and acts well. The songs were great for me because I love country music.

Lucky for me, my library had the DVD. I'm a country lover and that was my main attraction to COUNTRY STRONG. I also like Gwyneth Paltrow and Tim McGraw. Both great actors.

What little I knew of the movie was that it was about a country singer Kelly Canter, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, coming out of rehab for alcohol addiction. Her husband and manger, played by Tim McGraw, is driven to push Kelly to her limit to become a success in her music career.

I didn't known Gwyneth sang, and was surprised to discover that not only does she sing, but she's quite good. But Gwyneth wasn't the only one who could sing. A second set of characters had their own storyline.

The slow growing romance between Chilies Stanton, played by Leighton Meester, and Beau Hutton, played by Garrett Hedlund, will warm your heart as you are taken along on their compelling stories. I thought the main focus would be on Gwyneth's character, Kelly, which in part was why the added story of Chiles and Beau was such a pleasant surprise. Their back-story, their growing romance, and great voices had me wanting a story of their own. With Leighton's beautiful voice, and Garrett's unique gravely sound, purchasing the soundtrack is a must.

COUNTRY STRONG was a great movie but what really won me over was the ending. There's nothing like a final shocker, as well as a happily ever after.",1309132800,,1519,4.553113553113553

The story could have been much better. I don't think this was based on any single true life story, but easily could have been (Cobain, Presley etc). Even though Beau was 'helping', he had his own reason for making sure the marriage didn't work. It made him look like the hero, but really he was just as much the problem dividing the marriage. To me the movie wasn't predictable. I thought 'alright, she's finally coming to her senses' nope! Perhaps it was her only way out.
Depressing! I like to see people brought out of their messes, lives changed. You'll have to look elsewhere for that. In the end what took place (after the death) was going to happen even before she took her life, except her husband was no longer her manager. So, what was the point, considering it's fiction?

4382278,2,B004I1K4MQ,"'Country Strong' received massive amounts of hype, with a lengthy trailer for the film being played prior to what felt like 90% of the movies in theaters a few months prior to its opening. Gwenyth Paltrow did extensive promotion, as she had the lead role. This led to a surprisingly pleasant performance on the television show 'Glee', and then the movie arrived.

It must first be understood that this movie is nearly two hours long, and suffers deeply from the sometimes tiring scenes that could have been trimmed down. A drama like this needs to keep a high-octane level of self-deprecation, or else it begins to simply wallow in its own self-pity. This film resorted to the latter, and while there were some enjoyable moments of fine acting from Paltrow, the majority of the film was so overwrought that the ending felt almost like a blessing.

Another point that should be made is that, while the film seems to center around Paltrow, the real star is Leighton Meester's Chiles Stanton. While the previews project this character to be a conniving girl attempting to take Gwenyth's throne, she is actually a nervous rising star desperate for success but scared of how she is supposed to get there. Leighton acts the hell out of her character, drawing forth unsureness, drive, desire and fear all into single shots, giving her character a third dimension that may not have been intended in the script.

As the film goes along, it is at once relieving and disheartening that 'Country Strong' isn't the uplifting tale of a grand comeback that the previews have made it out to be. The film is often dark, and the characters have all have a realistic stubbornness to not change their behavior despite the negative results these actions result in. It's nice that the plot isn't optimistically contrived, but instead it is cynically contrived, and feels like it is pandering the audience far too often.

'Country Strong' amounts to some potentially interesting characters not given enough room to shine in a plot focused only on delivering the melodrama that it never included in its mission statement. This is quite a deceiving film; if you enjoy treacly, hopeless melodrama, this is sure to be your cup of tea. To all others: 'Blue Valentine' was recently released on DVD.

Well...you know how every DVD has all kinds of praise from people you don't know on the cover. That's all that is. If you're country it's a strong movie. If you're city it's the wrong movie.

This is a pretty good movie and it gets 5-stars if you live in Tennessee and it gets 1-star if you are from New York.

There is no denying the fact Gwyneth Paltrow is one of the greatest actors of all time just for the fact very few actors can turn in a legit redneck performance. It takes a redneck to know one and my straw hat is off to Gwyneth. She must have had a dialect coach that grew up watching Hee Haw and the Beverly Hillbillies. It's the greatest redneck performance by a non-redneck of all-time! She's a Skoal dipping surfer chick now. A mobile meth lab away from hanging out at the cement pond with Elly May and Jethro.

Here's the entire story. Gwyneth is a former country star that freaks out, gets drunk and old. Her husband don't want her no more. She wants a young singer to curl up in bed with after a hard night of drinking and her husband wants the same thing. Predictible relationship twists and turns. The end.

Tim McGraw plays the husband of a 40-something year old still hot former country music star. Something he does in real life everyday. McGraw is good in the role of ""Husband"" to 40-something chicks in movies. It's just his role. He's good at it.

The old skool country music is really great in this movie but if you don't like country don't bother. The entire movie looks like it was filmed in and around the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, a hotel room, a tour bus and a bar. By that I mean it could have all been done in the same 1/4 of a mile radius with some stock road sign footage added. Not a lot of scenery that's going to ""pop"" on the Blu Ray.

It's like you got some really top of the line cameras, your best female friend was a great actor, everyone else was just glad to be there, you wrote a decent script but didn't have enough money to travel so you stayed in one spot in one Tennessee town and made a movie.

Country Strong couldn't carry Coal Miner's Daughter's spitcup but it would look good with it in a DVD two-pack at Wal-Mart.",1305417600,6,2282,4.220183486238532

I don't feel that the story line was anything related to being ""strong"" so in my opinion the title (and the movie) are misleading. I recognize that the issues portrayed are reality in some cases, but overall the character played by Gweneth Paltrow is not capable of managing her own life and has allowed everyone around her (esp. her husband)to make choices for her and she is beyond being able to function. I am glad I didn't waste my money at the theater or on a rental since I was able to watch it at a relatives, who is also disappointed that she wasted her money on this DVD.

4382296,5,B004I1K4MQ,"So this is officially the VERY first time I am writing a Review on Amazon. Which is pretty surprising since I'm a huge Movie and Music buff. I literally just got done watching Country Strong and I jumped on here to find out if a I could buy a Soundtrack. I was never a huge country fan but I am a fan of Hayes Carll who is an amazing musician and someone who is very over looked. I was so surprised to hear Garrett Hedlund singing some of his songs in this movie and I hope more people get turned on to Hayes cause both his CD's are two of my favorites.

Moving on..I felt the need to write a review of this movie simply because I wanted so badly to give it props. I really really Loved it and I think the entire cast did an amazing job. This was the first time I have ever scene Garrett Hedlund but I must say I am beyond smitten. Ha! It might have something to do with the fact he reminds me of a young Viggo Mortensen and Viggo is def my all time favorite actor. Another brilliant man who is at times over looked.

SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! It really has heart, not to mention great music and I got teared up in the end which doesn't happen often. I hate that there are some people who said it was slow or just not good at all. I don't get it. This is a character driven movie that represents REAL people with REAL flaws and REAL Passions.

I can't say enough about it. It was def a movie I'm going to buy RIGHT AWAY..I'm also going to buy the soundtrack...and I'm def a new fan of Garrett Hedlund. I have a feeling we will def be seeing him around much more. And of course as always Leighton Meester was amazing. She is already a star. Oh and I don't mean to focus only on the young part of the cast...Gwyneth Paltrow and Tim McGraw where GREAT. But the romantic in me of course can't help but think Garrett and Leighton stole the show.

This movie had Walk the Line, and a Thing called love written all over it. And yet it is different and unique in it's own way.",1303603200,,1961,4.046391752577319

Last year brought the world ""Crazy Heart."" In 2005 ""Walk the Line"" was the best of this genre. In this year's version it's just not very believable probably because the heartbreak wasn't about an actual country or pop music heart breaker.

Gweneth Paltrow was believable as the broken Kelly Canter, and Garret Hedlund gives a stunning performance as Beau Hutton.  He seemed as if they really had plucked him out of a honkytonk in Nashville.

The writer's could have done a better job developing the story more fully.  I wanted more background into Kelly's fall from grace, and I wanted the character of Chiles Stanton to be fleshed out a bit more.  Overall, though, Country Strong is worth watching.

4382305,3,B004I1K4MQ,"""Country Strong"" is yet another example of how a film with a mediocre script can sometimes be elevated by a great performance. In this case, the performer is Gwyneth Paltrow, who portrays troubled country music superstar Kelly Canter. In the beginning of the film, Canter is in rehab following a tragic public meltdown, and is taken out early by her manager/husband, James, who is eager to put Kelly back on the road to reclaim her once stellar career. In rehab, Kelly had become romantically involved with Beau, a younger singer-songwriter, and Kelly insists that her husband allow Beau to open for her on her tour. Since James has already committed to making aspiring singer Chiles Kelly's opening act, the three musicians all end up going on the road together, and the four main characters become entangled in a plethora of romantic and non-romantic drama.

Paltrow is no stranger to playing self-destructive, troubled characters (she did play Sylvia Plath, after all), so I wasn't surprised at how well she pulls off her character's messy, volatile side. What did surprise me was how well Paltrow was able to portray a country music superstar. Paltrow, who is Hollywood royalty with a penchant for playing characters with British accents, is as far removed from a country girl as they come. And yet she is absolutely stunning at the climax of the film, when her character performs her triumphant comeback concert, and Paltrow is able to believably portray a superstar singer, wowing an audience of thousands of adoring fans, radiating charisma. It's long been known that Paltrow could sing, but her ability to actually perform as a singer is impressive.

Regarding the rest of the cast, the results vary. Garrett Hedlund shows mega-watt leading man charisma as Beau, and handled the musical scenes quite well. But he perhaps relies a little too much on his charm and fails to connect with the character's supposed inner conflicts. Similarly, Leighton Meester is cute and charming and has a good singing voice, but never effectively shows her character's ambition and desire to run away from her troubled past.

The whole film has the feel of a higher-end made for TV movie, full of pretty people with plenty of soapy melodrama. The film succeeds mostly as a showcase for Gwyneth Paltrow's acting and singing chops, and Garrett Hedlund's star quality.",1302912000,3,2354,5.015345268542199

The film, if it has flaws, is that I really could have used about two more script pages of ""explaining"" what the heck is going on!  As it goes, we get only bits and pieces.  Not all the characters motives are clearly outlined or defined.  And that is where it could have been so much better.  Yet the unraveling slices we see, are a range of such depth and complexity, it sometimes/always keeps you wondering.  And wanting more.

But for the characters in it, this has to be an all-round bravado set of performances.  Miss Paltrow, as sharp and crisp, as I've never seen her before; Tim McGraw an absolute presence of solid restraint, and final vulnerablity... with Garrett Hedlund stealing the show (with an ambiguous sort of character, you can't figure what drives him, or where he wants to go, or even why -- ), with a charm that is irresistable, and a voice (even McGraw has said) is wondrous. And let's not forget Leighton Meester, who can sing, and developes into a real darling... yet still doesn't hold the bottom of the basket together.

With what we have, weaknesses and all, I give it 4 1/2 stars.  The range and scope of complexities presented,and carried through -- had it gone further, we might have hit a ten on this one.  The music and performances were terrific.  But some of you... like to grumble about anything.  Too bad you missed the real qualities of the whole.",1302912000,9,1658,4.516778523489933

This was a movie that failed because it tried to fit too many animals on one boat, the loss of a child, a failing marriage, substance abuse, rehab, country music, and more romantic story lines than a day time soap. Tim's great acting potential was hemmed in by a script that required he play the most wooden character I've seen since I watched Mr. Rogers as a kid.

I kept comparing this film the classic film The Rose, which starred Bette Midler. By the end of the film, any comparison between the two movies completely died. While in The Rose, you have such a messed up person but you felt sorry for her. At the end of that film you sat there speechless because it was such a strong and emotional movie, not like Country Strong. In this movie you have another woman who is a mega country star. She is in rehab for drinking and pills. Her Manager Husband is a no good heartless person. Paltrows character though played well by her, lacks any emotion or sympathy due to the weak script and lack of character development. She falls for and up and coming country singer Beau and blows things with him. This movie could have been so much better is it had a better stronger script. The music was fine.

4382318,2,B004I1K4MQ,"One of my biggest pet peeves with my friends and others that I talk to about movies is when they love a movie based solely on a great ending. They'll rave about some major twist, some great final sequence, but totally forget a bunch of stupid stuff prior. That being said, I am attempting not to be the complete opposite type of person while applying my same overall principle - because my instinct wants to completely pan Country Strong for what is certainly one of the worst movie endings I've seen in quite some time...maybe ever. I need to judge the film as a whole, so let's get to it then...

Country Strong is the story of three country singers. One, Kelly Cantor (Gwenyth Paltrow), is a seasoned singer whose part Faith Hill and part Lindsay Lohan. The movie begins with her leaving rehab (for alcohol abuse), forced to leave early by her angry (or misunderstood?) husband/manager (Tim McGraw) who seemingly wants to see her back on the road making money. While in rehab, she met an up-and-coming star who worked in the facility, who coincidentally also knows another up-and-coming star who coincidentally Cantor's husband is looking into to be a new opening act, coincidentally. Coincidentally. Coincidentally. My word the beginning of this movie was almost as bad as the end. There is so much cooking here, and almost none of it is believable.

In the middle though, once we forgive all of the coincidences, the story hits it's stride and becomes, dare I say it, immensely entertaining. The music wasn't half bad for the amount of original material they made for the film. I actually began really liking the characters - the acting was very good, and I thought I might end up liking the overall experience. And then the last five minutes happen. My word. So terrible. I'm sorry, this review is not eloquent, but it's just that bad. The screenwriter/director, Shana Feste, should be utterly ashamed how she betrayed the overall message of the movie in the last few scenes. This was supposed to be a movie about redemption, not some bad soap opera.

Instead I got a movie with some exceptional acting, great music, and an amazing story.

I will first make a comparrison:
Love and Other Drugs was similiar in that it deals with a lot of human element and complexities. However, that movie was so OVERLY sexual that it watered down the emotion. And while I love Anne Hathaway and thought she did some great acting I didn't like her character. In the end I didn't think he character developed and still felt like her character was very selfish and that they both were. It was a very co-dependent relationship.

Country Strong was so much more. It was what I wanted Love and Other drugs to be. (Spoiler Alert) You wont' find a happy ending here but the complex story of Kelly Canter won't leave my mind. Paltrow was a perfect pic for this character as she almost has a sadness in her eyes, a certain quality.

Kelly Canter is a famous celebrity who's lost her way in life. After losing a baby when she fell of stage during a concert (she tripped over a mic cord, but she was intoxicated) she goes to rehab where she stays for about a year. James Canter, her husband checks her out early from rehab to help her get her career back. Kelly'd not ready to leave rehab and a friend who works at the rehab and sings at local bars and dance halls comes on tour with her- Beau.

Kelly Canter is now KELLY CANTER. Her entire being is her ""celebrity"" and she's no longer herself anymore. All she really wants is for James to love her. She longs to escape the life she's living but when she tries to talk to James about this he refuses to see the real Kelly anymore.

There's so much pain between them, and you watch Kelly's life jump off the tracks and spiral out of control. It's very painful at times. James and Kelly have a complex relationship that's become more about business and more about KELLY CANTER the headliner than Kelly Canter the woman. Kelly continues to make bad choices and it's clear she's had a mental breakdown. Only Beau can see this and while he's in love with her all of her demons push him away.

Meanwhile Chiles Stanton (Leighton Meester who does a great job) is the pageant queen girl trying to break in to stardom. She turns out to be more complex than she seems on the surface and in the end Beau falls for her. She wants the limelight though and wants to be the next Kelly Canter. Beau gets a taste of it and decides it's not for him. He can see what fame has done to Kelly. How it steals every piece of you. He just loves music and wants to go back to singing in dance halls.

James Canter will push Kelly at any cost. His love for Kelly has become so entagled in his desire for her to suceed and be KELLY CANTER that he can't see how broken she is. ""She use to be strong. I don't know when she became so fragile."" he says to Beau.

There is such a struggle in this movie between two people who love each other and hurt each other in so many ways. It shows how complex a marriage can be. How complex the ""celebrity"" personality can be and how even those close to you can blur the lines between real and pretend.

You'll find hope at the end of the movie when two characters decide to leave that life behind. Unfortunately you'll also find pain and sadness, when sometimes it's just too late.

There is not a character in this movie that is not deeply complex. You're heart will break and bleed for them even as you watch them hurt each other and make avoidable mistakes. These characters too do selfish things to one another but what will stay with you is the pain that love can cause when it won't let go.
You'll see the intensity that is so hard to show between two people as you peel back the layers on James and Kelly's marriage.",1295222400,16,3881,4.273841961852861
4382324,5,B004I1K4MQ,"There is nothing not to like, compelling story line, excellent acting and phenomenal music!  I was expecting to like this movie but I LOVE IT!  You get very into the characters and the songs are outstanding.  I will be purchasing this as soon as it comes out and I am pretty picky about movies.",1295049600,3,294,4.407407407407407
4382325,2,B004I1K4MQ,"""Country Strong"" was written and directed by Shana Feste (would I have called her ""Shan-like-Shannon-a-Fest-y? Who knows...). ] This movie had a lot of possibilities and I wanted to like it. We know from past experiences with ""Ray"", ""Walk the Line"", and ""Crazy Heart"", that stories of musicians dealing with fame and all the problems that come with it in relationships and their own health equal lots of notice come awards time! Obviously the stories based on actual artists fare a little better since all that came out of ""Crazy Heart"" was the recognition by the Academy that Jeff Bridges has been around for many years and The Dude can act. And not just when he's being a hippie. But it does help when he gets to be an alcoholic. My early prediction for this coming year is that the Best Actor award will go to James Franco playing the young man who lost a fight with a damn big rock in ""127 Hours.""

Anyway, I'm still talking about ""Country Strong"", right? Maybe this store brand Dayquil is kicking in a little hard. Here are things almost every musician movie, country, rock, or otherwise has in common: A) Alcohol and/or Drug Dependence, B) Infidelity, Sleeping around, C) Pull a stupid stunt onstage and embarrass yourself, fall from grace, D) Rehab.

The premise is that Gwyneth Paltrow plays a country star named Kelly Canter who has a bunch of Grammies and she's an alcoholic who has been in rehab (ding, ding, ding, that's two for two!). Her husband and manager, James is played by Tim McGraw who has become quite a good actor. He did really well in ""The Blind Side"" and this role is much tougher. We find out rather early on that what put her in rehab was being drunk and falling offstage at a show in Dallas (Whoa, that's three for four already). He decides to pull her from rehab a month early to set up a three date tour (does this count as a tour? 3 days??) that will end in a highly televised return to Dallas to prove everyone wrong. Unfortunately, Kelly is a fragile little flower that the tiniest thing can set off and have her running to makeup smearing boozing that never felt believable.

While in rehab, she was ""taken care of"" if you know what I mean by Beau Hutton played by Garrett Hedlund. Why is that face so familiar? You just saw him in ""Tron: Legacy."" This is what he looks like with facial hair and holding a guitar! Gotta say this is a face and voice to win the ladies over, no question about it. In fact, the majority of the movie the camera is panning over his face smiling longingly at some girl so this movie is really more Beau's movie than any other character. Due to Beau's past with James' wife in rehab and his own country music talent in the local bar, he gets the privilege of getting to open for Kelly on this tour along with Chiles Stanton played by Leighton Meester (of ""Gossip Girl"", XOXO). Chiles is a beautiful girl, her claim to fame she totes around is being a former Miss Dallas, but she is shy to sing onstage until interactions with the blue-eyed, Beau help her gain confidence and she holds tight to the reins of her career (oh great, a horseback riding joke, what'll she think up next?).

Ok, so Kelly is married to James. James can barely look at her as a husband. Kelly is having an affair with Beau obviously. Beau loves her but can't help but start to like the innocent and age appropriate Chiles. Kelly is jealous that Chiles is young and pretty and might get the attention of James. This goes beyond a love triangle, this is a well organized love square. (ding, ding, infidelity, four for four!)

I really liked the relationship between Kelly and James onscreen with all its complexity and there was occasional charm to the relationship between Kelly and Beau though it was definitely lacking. The relationship between Beau and Chiles was pretty cute and had potential. The problem is that there are TOO many relationships!! They all suffer for being stuffed together like this. The hilarious thing is, while all the characters appear to know what is going on, they very rarely talk about it. They just want to get to Dallas.

The biggest letdown of the movie if Gwyneth Paltrow's character, Kelly. You never have a reason to want her to get better or cheer for her. You get tiny glimpses of what might have made James fall in love with her in the first place, but it's hard to figure out how the fans ever embraced her. She's actually more of a supporting role even though the movie is supposed to be about her, but I guess she's the only reason the other three characters are there. She never even sings a full song until practically the end of the movie since she keeps screwing it up with booze (while Beau and Chiles have each sang a TON) and you start wondering if she ever will. And I have to give credit to my friend, Austin Lugar at TheFilmYap.com with making this comparision: Remember that scene in ""Get Him to the Greek"" where the rock star after the long journey finally does his opening song, ""I'm Coming Up"" and the lights go up? THAT, my friends, THAT had more emotional build up than Kelly finally singing at her Dallas concert with the movie title song, ""Country Strong."" Wow. By that point, you just don't care about her anymore and I was of the attitude that if she didn't start singing now at the end of the movie, I just wanted to kick her or get one of those giant canes to pull her offstage.

The other thing that bugs me is audience reactions during the songs. They only have two levels. On and off. When you are at a concert with an opening act you have never heard of and songs you have never heard before, you don't suddenly cheer like it's the Super Bowl and sing along. No gradual warming up to the artists, just full blown cheering or crickets chirping. No inbetween there. The extras could have used a little coaching.

Some of the songs were pretty good and this is coming from a girl who is not a huge fan of country music and I still have ""Give In To Me"" stuck in my head today. You might be better off skipping the movie and picking up the soundtrack, but I'd call this a rental. It is not going to get Awards buzz which is why it was pushed back to a January 7th release date instead of getting in before the end of 2010. The three ""supporting"" (i.e. main) characters are pretty decent in their own respects, but Gwyneth Paltrow spends far too much of this movie in a haze that doesn't give us enough to root for.

Oh, and you totally see the ending coming a mile away. That's all I'm sayin'.",1294704000,7,6492,4.421404682274248
