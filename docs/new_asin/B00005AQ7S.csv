7935530,5,B00005AQ7S,"A lot of people seem to dislike how short this video is, but it says ""DVD Single"" right on it. Just like a single from a CD, it only has a few songs. If you think about it, this is kind of like the single to the ""Barelaked Nadies"" DVD. Anyways, to the review. It may only have a running time of 16 minutes, but what is within those 16 minutes is what matters. First, it has my favorite BNL video ever ""Pinch Me"". It also has the long version, and the edit version of ""Too Little Too Late"". And to wrap it up, this DVD contains a video called ""Maroon Album"" which is an odd, yet funny video parody. Overall, great DVD. It's about quality, not quantity ;)",1262563200,,653,4.069767441860465
7935531,4,B00005AQ7S,"This DVD really gives fans a perspective on the roots and early work of the band, and some interesting haircuts.  The overriding feeling you get after watching it is how talented they are as a band and as song writers.  The videos really show their evolution as artists.  The early videos are like all early videos, they look pretty silly in hindsight, but accomplish what the band set out to do with them.",1094515200,,406,4.534246575342466
7935533,3,B00005AQ7S,"I LOVE BNL!  I even have a fansite, but I must admit that I was disappointed in this DVD.  I think the band put it out just to have something out.  I understand the GOOD one will be out later this year (2002 late) but here's my beefs with this one.  1)Too Short 2) Only 3 vids, 2 being the same one 2 versions 3) You can't skip track from one to the next, you have to fast forward.  There you go.  As I said, great to have it for the collection, but not the best they've ever done.",1032998400,4,481,3.808080808080808
7935534,5,B00005AQ7S,"This is a great DVD, no matter whether you're a huge fan like myself or a newie.  The infomercial is hysterical, and the music videos are awesome.  If I had to make a complaint, it would be that it's pretty short-- 2 music videos of the same song (one is the shortened version), another music video for Pinch Me, and the infomercial.  Totally worth the money and all, but it definitely leaves you wanting more.  Definitely recommended, though!  Go to town!  Enjoy yourself!  I like Easy Mac.",1029110400,9,491,4.574712643678161
7935535,5,B00005AQ7S,"This is a fabulous DVD!
The homemade commercials in the middle of the video are priceless!
I just wish they had included more of their videos on it!",1014249600,,148,4.321428571428571
7935536,5,B00005AQ7S,"BNL is one of the greatest bands working today and these are a couple of their best videos.  The ""informercial"" is great fun and showcases the bands self depricating sense of humor.
There's only one problem- It is too ... short!  For the money it's a great value, but I would like to see a more extensive collection of videos released some time soon.  That or a live performance would be welcomed.  You haven't lived until you've seen the ladies on stage.
Buy this to whet your appetite and get thee to a show.  You'll have a great time!",994982400,9,537,4.383838383838384
7935537,5,B00005AQ7S,"Anyone who loves the Barenaked Ladies should get this!  It has both versions of the Too Little Too Late video, the Pinch Me video, and the infomertial from the beginning of September 2000.  It's a great compilation of videos, and they all look good!  It even shows some of Steven Page's dancing, which usually can only be seen live. Over all, the best DVD I've bought, music related.",985564800,10,383,4.602941176470588
7935538,4,B00005AQ7S,"I love Barenaked Ladies, so I made sure I grabbed this DVD as soon as it came out.
The DVD is only 16 minutes long, with 4 chapters.  There are two variations of ""Too Little Too Late"", with only 13 seconds of additional footage as the only difference between the two.  The video of ""Pinch Me"" is also on the DVD.
However, fans will appreciate the mock infomercial for the ""Maroon"" CD featuring Harland Williams (""Rocketman"", ""The Geena Davis Show"").  Williams is the cousin of BNL pianist Kevin Hearn.
If you are a big fan of the guys, then buy this!  You will not be disappointed.  If you are a BNL newcomer, wait for the release of ""Barenaked in America"" first.",985478400,12,663,4.446280991735537
