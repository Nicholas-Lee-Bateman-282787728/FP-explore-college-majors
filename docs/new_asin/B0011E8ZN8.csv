8600413,5,B0011E8ZN8,"Didulya is an outstanding acoustic guitarist from Russia backed by some excellent musicians, especially on percussion. They put so much energy into their performance and yet it all seems so relaxed. This concert from Moscow has a more intimate feel to the larger scale one on DVD from St Petersburg in 2009 but that is its particular charm. Anyone who loves beautiful music played with elegance and dynamism will also love Didulya and his group.",1367971200,,445,4.946666666666666
