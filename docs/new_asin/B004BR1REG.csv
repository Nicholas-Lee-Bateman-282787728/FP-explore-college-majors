4319973,3,B004BR1REG,"Bought this disc for the Ginger Rogers short, but it isn't as clear as I expected. Yes I know it is eighty years old plus, but I have another two of her shorts and they are wonderfully remastered copies. It is still alright, but a little disappointing in quality.",1391126400,3,263,4.387755102040816
4319974,2,B004BR1REG,These shorts were painfully awful.  the acting was questionable at best.  If you know everyone who ever had a movie roll in the early 30s I guess this would be worth your time.  I'm not that much of an aficionado of early talkies.,1386201600,,230,4.3023255813953485
4319975,4,B004BR1REG,A great piece of nostalgia. A staged glimpse of the Hollywood stars in the early 1930's. Good quality sound and picture,1385510400,2,119,4.714285714285714
4319976,3,B004BR1REG,"Even for those interested in early Hollywood there is probably not much of interest here - some stars in candid shots (on the Lurline, at the racetrack), some stars in scripted scenes. The scripted material is generally weak and a number of the ""stars"" are now totally forgotten. One has to sit through a lot of junk just to see clips of Mary Pickford, Jean Harlow, Claudette Colbert, Loretta Young, or Constance and Joan Bennett in 1930s Hollywood. The clip of Tallulah Bankhead singing (???) is however a train wreck that needs to be seen.",1380931200,2,541,4.705263157894737
4319977,3,B004BR1REG,if you  want this one think it will be just historical material  For reseraches in american  movies history it is ok,1379376000,,116,4.428571428571429
4319978,3,B004BR1REG,"pretty much limited to people and events from a single year in the thirties. celebs featured were mostly ""b"" entertainers who seemed to be enjoying themselves.",1364860800,,159,5.153846153846154
4319979,2,B004BR1REG,"The technology was poor and the selections presented were unfortunate and
Badly presented.  Even a dyed-in-the-wool film buff  (I) was bored!  Unless you
Are really into Hollywood history, forget it.",1364860800,,199,5.566666666666666
4319980,3,B004BR1REG,This product was on time and in good condition. It was cool watching jean Harlow golfing and seeing what life was like back in the 30's at the studios.,1328140800,3,151,4.241379310344827
4319981,3,B004BR1REG,"In the early 1930's when a lucky moviegoer went to see a show they would see  more than just a feature film. In those days people were given a variety of films to enjoy. This was before television so Newsreels presented the events of the day in moving pictures. There was usually a cartoon and other short films. These shorts are now becoming available at last. One such series of shorts that was made in the era of Hollywood's Golden Age was Hollywood on Parade.
This disc gathers several episodes that showcase established stars and aspiring actors. Here they can be seen in cameos or performing. Some great material can be found here like Ginger Rogers scat singing and Tallulah Bankhead trying to sing. These films reflect their times so one of my favorites features a champion flagpole sitter.
The films used to make this compilation are not restored but as a rule good enough and better than might be expected. My only gripes are the facts that there is no way to access individual films! This disc was made without a menu! In that way it's no better than a VHS tape. There is really no excuse for such a slapdash production. Also, it contains one episode twice!
If you love old Hollywood and the rare ephemeral shorts that were made to brighten peoples lives in the heart of the great Depression, by all means buy this disc. It could have been produced more professionally but the films are at least now available and great fun to watch.",1318896000,17,1444,4.575289575289576
4319982,3,B004BR1REG,"This is a collection of nine of the ""Hollywood on Parade"" shorts, all complete, but not at all restored.  The numbers of the shorts contained are A-1, A-3, A-4, A-5, two numbered A-6, A-12, B-1 and B-5.  I'm not sure why there are two numbered A-6.  The first A-6 has Richard Arlen performing as a magician and has (among others) Frances Dee, Clark Gable and Buster Keaton.  The second A-6 has Shipwreck Kelly flagpole sitting with various young women who look through a telescope and sight stars such as Charlie Chaplin, Paulette Goddard, Harold Lloyd, Charles Farrell, Johnny Weissmuller, Mary Pickford and others.  Bing Crosby and Harry Langdon have actual parts in the short.  Although some of these shorts are easy to find elsewhere, a few are more rare and it is an entertaining little collection.",1299888000,29,803,4.867647058823529
4319983,3,B004BR1REG,"Hollywood on Parade (1932) shows how far movie entertainment has come since live vaudeville, which most of the performers were recruited.  Only Jeanette MacDonald, then under contract to Paramount, rises above the rather crude level of the then-famous actors in this series.",1444176000,2,274,5.523809523809524

4319990,2,B004BR1REG,"I'm torn in my rating. As a slice of Hollywood history it's really enlightening and has some charm. However many of the ""acts"" showcased in the film were unknown to me, and I think of myself as pretty well informed about Hollywood films... particularly the musicals of the 30's and 40's. Fredric March as emcee??? Great actor, but no Bob Hope.",1403308800,2,343,4.639344262295082

4319992,1,B004BR1REG,"but not all that interesting.  I'm a big fan of old Hollywood, but just could not get interested in this one.  Eventually turned it off.  Perhaps if I was much older (70s or 80s) it would have been more interesting.",1393718400,,215,4.325

8422196,4,B004BR1REG,"Poor image and sound quality, outmoded humor, presented in short segments book-ended repeatedly by virtually the same opening and closing sequences disappoint. Yet, appearances by the film industry glitterati of the day and glimpses of early Hollywood area landscapes, towns, and studios make it worthwhile viewing for fans of the1930s cinema scene.",1483056000,,349,5.730769230769231

8422199,3,B004BR1REG,Fun to see some old stars when they were young like Maurice Chevalier but generally this is a compilation of studio type newsreel bits to promote their stars.,1464566400,,158,4.678571428571429
