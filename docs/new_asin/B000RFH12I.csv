8200363,5,B000RFH12I,"I recently had to change how I eat.  Somebody told me about this H.O.P.E. being on PBS.  I got the DVD and the books.  It is very easy to understand.  I would certainly recommend these products to anybody who wants to do food and eating changes and needs simple explanations.  I went right out and got what Watson talked about.  See DVD first, then read books for further explanations.  If you are taking Prilosec and other such products daily, you really should investigate her DVD and books.  You hear to take probiotics, and fiber, and omega 3, but did you ever hear of dietary enzymes?  Do you know why these are important?",1278201600,6,627,4.526785714285714
