7813062,4,6301542096,"Johnny Unitas was surely (at least)

one of the top five QBs that ever

played. He was the 1st US QB to

pass for 40,000+ yards [In the old-

er Canadian Football League, only

Ron Lancaster hit 40,000+ quicker]

But Unitas DID win four Champion-

ships (including one Super Bowl).

It was a real shame to see him struggle

with the (then) bad San Diego Chargers

in 1973. He, Tom Matte and John Mackey,

the best TE in Pro Football history,

never should have been chased from

one of the great Football cities in

North America, Baltimore. I used to

go to Baltimore Stallions CFL games

in 1994-'95. They won the Grey Cup

and even the College Park-based Bal-

timore Stars of the USFL won that Pro

League's Championship back in 1985!

That, along with Unitas Baltimore Colts

and the new Baltimore Ravens, in '01,

were the four Baltimore Pro Football

Championship teams. No city has ever

ahd more Pro different Football teams

win League titles!",1150848000,,953,4.596385542168675

When the experts named football's all-time team Johnny Unitas was their quarterback. AND RIGHTFULLY SO  Sadly Johnny now plays on God's team.,1097712000,2,276,4.63265306122449
