8020264,3,B0002235L2,"I'm not sure what I expected from this movie, but whatever it was, it didn't deliver for me because I was left disappointed. I loved the acting of Jesse Bradford who played the leading role of ""Spencer"". He is also quite handsome and I got to see a couple shots of him without a shirt.

The whole production was a bit too quirky for my taste. Simply too much of a farce to be enjoyable. Spencer's recently deceased grandmother appears to him (in his imagination I suppose) to guide him to success in his love life. I found that a bit over the top as well as the two, I'm assuming, gay lovers who rent Spencer an apartment with pink draperies and linens, on the condition that they can use his place during the daytime to shoot scenes for a porn film they are making as an entry in a film making contest. I did like the one line in the ametuer porn film script where the prostitute said ""Quick pull out your hose"" because I was really hoping Bradford, dressed as a bare-chested fireman would do exactly that. Sadly not however. It would have earned this film an extra star on my rating!

Combine this with the tired plot of a young guy working in the mail room of an advertising agency, looking for his big break to taking over the company, and a ridiculous unattractive girlfriend whom he has had a crush on since the fourth grade, but who doesn't remember him at all, and is in love with someone else who treats her like crap.

This film was entertaining enough however to hold my interest all the way through. It wasn't by any means the most disgusting thing I've wasted time watching, but even though it was half entertaining in a hokey kind of way, I won't ever view it again, nor would I choose to share it with a friend or guest. I felt the writer went out of their way to incorporate foul language merely for the sake of including it and making the whole piece as trashy as possible.

If such language is there for a purpose and helps execute the plot then fine, but to throw it in just to show you're a low class unprofessional writer who doesn't have much of a vocabulary to write with, really lowers the quality of the film in my humble opinion. This film is ""OK"" if you don't have anything else to do anyway. It provides a few laughs and isn't totally undesirable, but I didn't find it worthy of a recommendation.",1371600000,,2324,4.323394495412844
8020265,3,B0002235L2,"This was a pretty ok movie. I watched it to kill the time so it proved it purpose, probably would not watch a second time.",1360454400,,122,3.92
8020266,3,B0002235L2,I suppose the movie was ok but frankly I don't remember it.  So I guess it didn't really stick in my memory!,1356480000,,108,3.909090909090909
8020267,1,B0002235L2,"This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time and I watch a lot of movies.  It's terrible, a waste of money and a waste of time to watch.  There is a reason why there's not many reviews and the price is so cheap because nobody buys this movie and for a good reason!",1308528000,2,270,3.719298245614035
8020268,1,B0002235L2,"Love Mia Kirshner, love Adam Goldberg, love Krumholtz and Bradshaw.  HATE this movie.  It was filled with plot holes and missing chemistry.  I have no idea what the producers were thinking.  Please, save yourself an hour and a half.  Rent Police Academy or anything else that makes even a lick of sense.",1177632000,3,303,4.75
8020269,5,B0002235L2,"First off, Mia, Mia, Mia...

She was never at the top of my list until now.  She plays coy and seductive and friendly and warm so very well.  I'm glad she was multi-dimensional in this film.

Honestly, I wasn't sure what to make of this film from the initial description.  It looked like just another one of those romantic-styled comedies that are more run-of-the-mill than interesting.  ACCORDING TO SPENCER was an extremely pleasant surprise.  I'm glad that my intuition took over and forced me to watch this film because it has quickly become one of my favorites.  It's become like ""comfort food"" because I think we've all been in Spencer's place at one point or another.

In other words...I highly recommend this film for its ingenuity, uniqueness (dude...seriously...the roommates!!!!), and warmth.  It won't change your life, but it will put a constant smile on your face for hours and hours.",1112400000,6,898,4.926666666666667
