802239,1,6304136218,I love Antonio Banderas and Melanie Griffith. I really looked forward to seeing this movie but I was EXTREMELY disappointed. I tried to watch it 3 times and fell asleep each time. I do NOT recommend this one. SAVE YOUR MONEY.,1251158400,,225,4.512195121951219
802240,5,6304136218,"This is one I am actually adding to my library.  It's one of my favorite movies - not because it's a classic, but just because it's good clean fun and a lot of laughs.  Antonio is a definite plus also.  So if you've got a couple hours and are in the mood for comedy, I would highly recommend this movie.  (Note-macho men may not like it that much - my kids call it a ""Chic Flic"".)",1219363200,,380,3.960526315789474
802241,4,6304136218,Gee I love that man!  Good fun movie. I love the shower/pool scene. 4 stars because I've watched it twice and fell asleep both times.  Had good dreams though.,1169251200,,158,4.413793103448276
802242,3,6304136218,"Listen, I'll make it my point to agree with one particular reviewer who made a good point. So, this movie isn't particularly intelligent or ""deep"".It's not oscar worthy, and its not gonna offer up any mind blowing performances. It IS however,solid entertainment that'll give you warm fuzzies for the hour and a half it takes up. Just curl up in front of the tv when you have nothing better to do, and watch this film. Sure its lighthearted, but its feel-good, and sometimes thats just what you need.",1071273600,8,499,4.681818181818182
802243,4,6304136218,"This movie doesn't require a college degree, isn't Oscar material, and won't make you wake up in the middle of the night pondering its 'true meaning', but it will distract you for a couple of hours and provide you with the opportunity to laugh.
Perhaps I find this predicament so humorous because I tried something of the same gambit when I was younger.  Not in such detail, not to such depths (altar), and certainly not with such success.  But remembering my antics provokes a good laugh and so did this film.
I loved seeing Antonio Banderas (OK, there could be a period right there, but...) in a comedic role.  I find him believable in any role and...so easy on the eyes.  He makes acting look so easy.  What Billy Bob Thornton accomplishes with only a few choice words, Antonio can do with his eyes.
As for what he and Melanie Griffith may have discovered about one another during the filming, I couldn't say.  I still don't know what they have in common, I just trust them to know their hearts.  But in 'Two Much' the chemistry isn't required between THOSE two on the celluloid, it is instead between Antonio and Daryl Hannah.  So if you don't see sparks between Melanie and Antonio, maybe it is due to good acting in their roles as 'lovers' who weren't in love (at least with each other).
Certainly the plot wasn't as deep as the well-utlizied pools and the laughs weren't the kind that get you in the gut (except perhaps for the morning race between bedrooms with an ever-present pool in between).  So, maybe I go for cheap laughs.  But I also go for entertainment.  This movie provided that.
So watch it with a friend and a bowl of popcorn and let yourself be entertained for a rainy afternoon.  It will temporarily erase the clouds and lift your spirits.",1026000000,21,1762,4.541139240506329
802244,2,6304136218,"Two Much.  Get it? There are two women involved and the screenwriter has used his God-given talents to assimilate this tidbit of information with the common phrase ""too much"" (as in an excess) to arrive at the pun ""Two Much."" I don't mean to mock, but having watched this movie I feel I can rightly surmise that there must be a village out there somewhere missing an idiot because he was responsible for this. The humor has its moments, but is generally predictable and stale. I really can't make any accurate guesses at the intelligence on the scriptwriters, but their density much be such that light can bend around them.  This film is cliche, poorly acted, and just plain bad.  There are innumerable things that one can do with two hours and I suggest you partake in one of those things.  Just please, do not watch this movie.",984182400,,829,4.581081081081081

7863934,1,6304136218,I thought this might be an enjoyable experience given the history of the stars; but the script is soooo bad that it makes you cringe and actually wonder how the 2 got together. Don't waste your money on this turkey!!,1402790400,,216,4.425
7863935,2,6304136218,"I liked Melanie Griffith in Working Girl and Milk Money.  Hoping to see more of her acting, I was disappointed in the story line, poor acting, etc.  It was like a ""B"" rate movie.  I would not recommend purchasing.",1382832000,,213,4.410256410256411

7863937,1,6304136218,"It's beyond me how some people call this movie descent. The movie SUCKS!!! The acting is awful, not to mention Melanie Griffith's annoying voice.  To each their own but I think this movie is quite possibly one of the worst I've seen in many years.",1347062400,,247,4.488888888888889
7863938,5,6304136218,"I watched this movie years ago and enjoyed it. I wanted to watch it again and keep it in my dvd collection.  everything was perfect about my order. just an advice for the other customers: be careful about the region type of the dvd you buy. if it is a ""region 1"" type, your dvd player may not play it in Europe. If you are living in Europe you need to buy ""region 2"" type. However, you can find some programs that revert the region type on the internet.",1328918400,2,453,4.089887640449438
7863939,3,6304136218,This film is a little better than what some critics have said about it. The cast s likeable and the acting is good. I haven't read the novel that it was based on so I can't make a comparison between the book and the movie.,1261699200,,222,3.9555555555555557
