Yes it is a live recording from a concert but little effort was made to produce a quality video. Way too much audiance sing along Pitbull you let me ddown on this one hire a new producer!

5352134,2,B009MO5DCU,"I love Pitbull and this DVD is very poor quality, both audio and visual.  I was very disappointed all the way around.",1371945600,4,117,4.318181818181818
5352135,4,B009MO5DCU,"A great collection of songs, and a humbling experience (in the sense that you see just how hard the man and everyone else on stage works during the concert!)

I knocked my review down a half star each, for two issues. One issue is that the camera angles and stage lighting sometimes were at war with each other - fair bit of ""flare"" as cameras over-exposed. Second issue is that the music's bottom end (bass) is a bit lacking - had to manually raise bass level to get it closer to studio album sound.

Now note that live sound recording is MUCH harder to control than studio recordings.. So I'm willing to live with occasional loss of clarity as he talked away from the microphone. But for me (having a sound system that can shake the walls), the overall deficiency in bottom end (while easy to fix) was a bit off-putting.

Finally, packaging states clearly that this is mixed as Dolby 2.0 - meaning no surround or separate bass channel.. Your receiver [like mine] may have to have it's settings changed to avoid weird-sounding music effects...",1371600000,4,1044,4.602150537634409
5352136,1,B009MO5DCU,The quality of this CD was awful. Too much noise in the background and I wasn't able to hear the music or the words.  I would not recommend this CD to my friend.,1368403200,,161,3.878787878787879
5352137,5,B009MO5DCU,Ordered this for a party bus that is taking 22 zumba women to the Houston Rodeo to see Pitbull in concert.  This will play in the background on the big screen!  Can't wait!,1362614400,,172,4.181818181818182
8543030,2,B009MO5DCU,The quality of the dvd is awesome. But pitbull is just a terrible performer. He says something every couple minutes and the rest is just recordings of someone elses voice. Im just glad I wasted my money on the dvd and not concert tickets,1519862400,,237,4.409090909090909
8543031,1,B009MO5DCU,"I am a huge fan of Mr. 305 but this DVD does an enormous disservice to his music you cannot begin to imagine how terrible the sound quality is.  I can appreciate the difficulties of recording a live event, so I try to be tolerant of sub-standard sound quality.  This DVD is so poor you should really save your money, it is hard to describe just how pathetic it sounds.  Pitbull,  please give us another live concert and release it on Blu-ray with the help of a real sound technician!!",1512691200,,484,4.344444444444444
