895893,"This movie got a shudder out of me before it even started. I saw thelogo for The Asylum come up and I knew immediately that I was in for 90minutes of cheap, irritating horror film-making. I've come to associatethat logo with some of the worst genre movies ever. Worse than RogerCorman's Concorde label, worse than Avi Lerner's NuImage, worse thanCharlie Band's Full Moon... yes, even worst than Lloyd Kaufman's Tromalabel. The Asylum is, hands down, the worst cheap movie horror outfitin the history of cinema in my opinion. So, as I said, the logo came upand I shuddered involuntarily. But that was the only scare of the wholemovie.The Asylum is true to form with ALIEN ABDUCTION. The early scenes of acrew of campers out in the woods are poorly lit, poorly acted andpoorly edited. About ten minutes in, our hiking quartet is attacked bya bunch of lizard-alien-monster things. It looks like the suit camefrom a B-movie clearance house. It might have been a leftover Godzillasuit for all I know. The filmmakers apparently knew that the suit wasridiculous because they coated it with bad CG prismatic colors. Haven'tseen that done since ""Darkhunters"".So after the alligator aliens capture our hikers by throwing stuffedpantyhose at them (I'm not kidding - watch the movie), the screen goesblack for a second and then we meet our four hikers again inside thealien spaceship. Our female protagonist keeps filming everything withher Handicam to give the movie that ""real"" quality. Because so often,when I'm abducted by alligator aliens, I feel the need to capture thewhole experience for posterity. They try to escape, the alligatoraliens catch them and eviscerate them, throwing intestines all over theplace with bloody glee.Cut to some sort of Government Secret Hospital. Our heroine is the onlyone to have survived the experience and she has no memory of whathappened to her. Her doctor tries to jog her memory with pictures ofaliens and flying saucers, but to no avail. Meantime, Ilsa the She-Wolfwatches from behind the mirror and makes all kinds of arch statementslike, ""I don't like her. Terminate her."" The doctor begs for just alittle more time. Our heroine manages to escape from her captors andher clothes several times over the course of the movie. After an hour,I had seen the heroine's breasts so often that I was starting tomemorize her freckles.So our heroine runs around, taking off her shirt, trying to avoidaliens and help her friends (who are in fact alive!) escape from theinstitution. But when she finally faces off with Ilsa, guess what....she's not really a human at all! In a startling reveal that you willnot see coming if you sleep through the first hour, we find out thatour heroine is actually an alien sleeper agent! At this point, themovie tries to become a poor man's version of Impostor - but if PhillipK. Dick heard me say that, he'd probably roll in his grave. Obviouslysomebody at the Asylum watched the Gary Sinise/Dimension version ofImpostor and thought, ""Let's do that, but with alligator men! We'llcall it Alien Impostor! No, wait, that will give away the twist.... howabout ALIEN ABDUCTION!""",Alien Abduction

1212062,"Gomorra (2008) is based on a book from Robert Saviano that touchesupon the  Ndrangheta or Camorra in Naples, Italy. The book receivedmassive acclaim from the Wall St Journal, the Washington Post, theGuardian, riding on the tail of the Brazilian succes of Cidade deDeus (2002) and the favela microcosm.The film's important moment is when the central character, playedby Toni Servillo, suggests that Italy's economy is failing from acompetitiveness point of view in a world global market, from costsattributable to a higher priced currency  (Euro) resulting  in amuch higher cost of living, while the earnings  of the workingclass has either stayed the same,  gotten worse or been made moredifficult, requring more effort and  more work for the same pay, toafford the same staples of health care, food, gas.More to the point, views are asked  on what are the consequences ofunmonitored, laissez faire economics in regards to society,especially in the total absence of morality and fair-play betweenbusinesses.It succeeds in showing a microcosm where people severely lackmental, emotional and  character depth. Viewers are not toldwhether the people are to blame, the lack of local opportunities ina unified Europe and free trade world, or simply the deterioratedquality of life for the working class in Italy overall.It succeeds in showing the human dependency between variousindividuals, a social hierarchy such that extortion payments areenforced from some to others. The author zooms into aspects ofmisery, drug trafficking, unemployment, lookouts and pushers onstreet corners, and rooftops, the childen looking up to gangstersas their role models, unrealistically, a complete lack of anyreligious, or educative instruction in the citizens, admiration forAl Pacino's Tony Montana character, consumption of narcotics, largecash sums exchanged, drug burns, punks and delinquents disturbingthe peace, industrial espionage, alien labor factories bidding onclothes contracts with legitimate fronts, certified garbagedisposal companies hauling toxic and radioactive waste to gardens,small farms, quarries, etc.At least from an artistic point of view, the film is 5%entertainment, 95% esoteric intellectual reflections, meditations,distillation of past events through a biographical filter.First of all, this picture will be worth naught for anyone nothaving resided in Europe, or in a Roman culture in particular(Italy, Sicily, Spain, Portugal, France, etc.)  It shows aglamorless, ghetto, poverty stricken community, for which cityslickers will have a complete lack of rapport, affection orcomprehension.Secondly, the work is too long, lasting well in excess of 2 hours.Some parts are a non sequitur, such as the opening 15 minutes whichpeppered with milquetoast visuals (naked men in a tanning salongetting shot, a scene with one pulling up his pants, anotherrequesting a manicure, or the 2 teens shown in a rice patty fieldspraying bullets from Ak-47 or Uzi's in their plain underwear.)Next, the soundtrack lacks conviction, sophistication andcharacter, existing at most simply to substitute total silence. Thefilming is widescreen, which is a plus, and although crystal clear,fails to show enough of Naples or the countryside to do areality-check, of the beauty of Europe for those loving its citiesand architecture.Instead, it insists in placing horse blinds on viewers, with aone-trick pony zoom of Naple's inner city, its housing projects andpoor in the outskirts of the city, where there is rampantunemployment, poverty, criminality, petty thievery, low-end housingconditions (plumbing, finishing materials) and lack of publicsafety. Nary a single outsider is seen visiting the place (e.g. acop).Fourth, as a form of entertainment, the film struggles in showing asocially redeeming value or humor, not offering a single laughthroughout, as if written straight from a jail cell. This hurts itsreplay potential.Some elements suggest a lack of editing rigor, such as the need toshow a tenant resisting eviction being shot, or 12 year old kidsforced to drive a truck, more alien laborors without basic skillsto function.",Gomorrah

813636,"They will not see a single dime on this.  People that are into Blu Ray typically are more invested in their entertainment than those that only buy DVD's. It is not a knock on DVD buyers but rather just that if you dropped the cash for the Blu Ray player and the extra money on the disks then chances are you also have a TV and sound system to get the max value from your investment. Now I know a lot of people that also invest like that but still only use a DVD player. The difference is that a much higher percentage of those into Blu Ray go all out to those only into DVD's.With that said, the Blu Ray community expects more for their investment. After spending a small fortune for their entertainment center, they want the best products with all the bells and whistles. For Lord of The Rings to come out just plain jane with nothing extra and knowing full well that the ""GOOD"" version will be released at a laster date, we have a right to be upset.And to those that say these reviews are not valid, I disagree.

1507995,"Synopsis:  Bucky Larson (played by Nick Swardson) is a man-child living in rural Iowa who believes he is destined for better things after getting fired from his job at the local grocery store.  During a night of fooling around with his friends, he finds found that his reserved parents Jeremiah (Edward Hermann) and Debbie (Miriam Flynn) were popular and prolific porn stars during the 1970s.  Inspired, Bucky packs up his things and moves to Los Angeles, where he plans on continuing the family legacy.  Though he knows no one in Los Angeles, a waitress by the name of Kathy McGee (Christina Ricci) takes him under her wing and ensures that he sees to it that his dreams are fulfilled.  Under the pressure to get money for his new roommate Gary (Kevin Nealon), Bucky tries to get into the adult business, but is publicly humiliated by his lack of endowment by the over-endowed Dick Shadow (Stephen Dorff).  This doesn't dissuade down-and-out porn producer Miles Deep (Don Johnson) from attempting to make a buck off Bucky and his family's reputation, however, so he offers to make Bucky Larson ""a star.""  Will Miles regret taking a gamble on Bucky?  Will Bucky Larson be a star?  And if so, will Kathy accept who he is for who he is and take their relationship to the next level?  Pauly Shore and Jimmy Fallon make cameo appearances.The premise is convoluted and it seems odd that everyone in Bucky's life is so nonchalant about his newfound choice of vocation. BThe movie followed a lot of the humor that the other Happy Madison films followed and the acting as a whole seemed rather weak.  Kevin Nealon is singlehandedly the reason why I would even consider watching this film again.  Had he not played the role of Gary, I could see myself enjoying this as much as I would have enjoyed a root canal.  I was expecting more with that kinda star power.Members of the 18-35 crowd who like to party while watching movies may find something worthwhile in watching this.

505602,"""Baby Geniuses"" represents the second lowest point in the late Bob Clark's directorial career, right behind ""Superbabies"".  It's a terrible idea on paper, and its quality didn't change in its filming execution.  The film tells me that it's alright for toddlers (not babies as the title mislead) to perform implausible acts in situations made for them, dumbing down their apparent danger and fatality which should appalled many parents.  The film failed for its odd schizophrenic humor: it has many witty retorts too complicated for kids to understand, and physical gags too idiotic for reasonable adults to accept; the film alienates my inner child and my current adulthood. When the toddlers constantly laugh in this movie, I felt nothing but anguish.",N/A
618275,"We received this movie as a Christmas gift.  We attempted to watch it while the kids were watching another movie downstairs.  We forced ourselves to watch the first half hour before we decided it was so not worth our time and the title had nothing to do with the movie - except for the first scene, at the airport.The great line up of performers gave us false hope in thinking this was going to be an entertaining movie.  The lack of storyline listed on the back cover should have been our first red flag.Some of the storylines could have been made into something worth watching - like the stepfather/stepson relationship or maybe even the Prime Minister and his secretary. But because they jump around between so many storylines (mostly shallow and self-serving, oh, and don't forget the porn dropped in for what, shock affect?) it was way too difficult to make sense of any of it.  Porn is not our thing and has NOTHING to do with love, neither does a guy who thinks he's a sex-god but constantly complains he can't get a girl.Whoever thinks this movie portrays LOVE has never experienced true and lasting love.  This distorted view of love is a major part of the reason our world is in the state it is in.  True love is about self-sacrifice and putting someone else before your own desires.  IF you actually want LOVE, in the true sense of the word this is the wrong place to find it.Love, actually, has nothing to do with this movie.  Hard to believe but Wall-E is a better romantic comedy.  At least the two robots put each other first and take care of each other.  The kids had the better entertainment option for the night.  Lucky them.",Love Actually
481977,"Want proof that this isn't a true sequel: Even Iron Monkey himself never dresses like he did in the first film.  Before he always had half his face covered, but now he does most his fighting in leisure suits with everyone seeing his face. Even the original music is absent, instead we get a musical score from the movie ""True Lies"" (I know, I own the soundtrack) during the action scenes, repeating the same string in one of the music tracks over and over (almost in every fight--at least at 5 different times!). In fact, besides dubbing in the use of the name ""Iron Monkey"" every once and a while, this is basically an older Donnie Yen movie re-released with the ""Iron Monkey 2"" label. Somebody tried way to hard to market in on the ""Iron Monkey"" name, and it shows quite badly.The only thing that made me keep watching was the frequent appearance of astonishing hyper-kinetic fight scenes choreographed by Yuen Ho-Ping, not the endlessly inventive Yuen Woo-Ping (as Amazon.com states), who came to fame as the fight choreographer of ""The Matrix."" Many people think that Woo-Ping did the fight choreography in this one... but he didn't. Those that have seen many of his other movies will notice the fight scenes lack a certain charisma that only Woo-Ping can deliver. Still, the curious thing is that, after a while, this choppy movie starts to lurch into a good-old kung fu spectacle. Iron Monkey 2 grows strangely compelling. It's as if, through directorial incompetence, the movie has been distilled to the basic elements of cinematic storytelling.This is not Yuen Woo-Ping's work, but I believe you may find it worth it because of Donnie Yen, who many believe is up there in on screen-fighting-fireworks with the likes of Jet Li and Jackie Chan. The other highlight in this movie was the actor who portrayed the son looking for his father --he had incredible martial arts skills in his own right. His fight with Donnie Yen was arguably one of the better ones in the film. The one bad thing was that we get more fighting from this looking-for-father guy than Donnie Yen himself. He's not a bad fighter, but I bought the movie looking for most of the fights with the Iron Monkey himself involved.By itself, you have some good fighting with some really bad dubbing and a reused music track from the movie ""True Lies."" But when you slap the name of the sequel to one of Yuen Woo-Ping's best work to it, too many comparisons will be made.",Iron Monkey 2

This movie revolted, facsinated, and flat out scared the hell out of them, and most of them loved it! The rest either fled the theatre in sheer terror, or became sick, and went home to turn on all the lights, and head straight for church the next AM. Wow. What a movie, and a stroke of brilliant filmmaking, to get an audience to behave as such. There are many subtle scenes that may escape those who only want to see head spinning and green pea soup. Such as the young priest's disturbing dreams about his mother. Young Regan fooling around with an Ouija Board, or the nasty demonic visage that keeps popping it's face throughout the possessed house. Regan eventually transforms into one of the most terrifying monsters in cinematic history. Her possessed 12 yr. old girl character is demonic, vile and pure evil. One can almost feel the chill in her room, or smell her repulsiveness. Dr. Billy Graham himself admitted that the film had a sense of real evil to it. The reason it scares us is fear of the unknown. If one is strictly an atheist, then it is sheer nonsense. But if one has faith in God, or any gods, then possession is a VERY real reality. The fact that the film's screenplay was based on a real story that happened in the Midwest in the fifties, only adds to the sense of dread and terror that one feels alone at night after viewing this movie. Throughout history, and in the Bible there are many mentions of demonic possession. If these instances werent mere seizures, or mental illness, then perhaps the horror that Linda Blair portrays is chillingly real.",N/A

The horse is haunting her? Some demon looking thing that looks like a moth is haunting her? She went crazy? See, these were all good plotlines, I dont see why the director couldnt choose one to go with.Second, there was a very decent couple of scenes in this movie.

1295616,"Many of the reviews have stated exactly what went wrong with this film, so I will not repeat them here, but I will say that everything that I adored in the cartoon series is completely gone from the film, and I mean everything. Yes, I realize that many things had to be left out in order to squeeze an entire season into one movie, however, a few SIMPLE things such as character name pronunciation and accurate character representation would have made the film less painful to watch. As a person who occasionally gets teary-eyed during the more emotional sequences of the cartoon series, I felt absolutely no emotion (other than anger) while watching this movie. The actors playing the characters were about as fun to watch as seeing paint dry. I am appalled that a 400-plus minute season of a show could possibly be crammed into a movie that was barely 1 and 1/2 hours. My husband and I were both bored to death while watching this, but we really love the cartoon series, and we are glad that we rented this at Redbox for $1.00, which, as another reviewer stated, is too high a price. The only things that were worth seeing in live action were the costumes (however inaccurate they were), and the sets. Bending was sufficient, but we would have liked to have seen more of it.

She danced so well with Fred Astaire I still think she was a better partner for him than Ginger Rogers. This movie was a disappointment. There was one good scene with the detective and her agent, where they each had one funny line. Whoever wrote the songs confused lots of notes and arpeggios with music. The lyrics were so silly they might have worked in a Marx Brothers movie, but were pretentious in this production. The dance numbers were so poorly choreographed that they actually looked better when we fast forwarded through them. We fast forwarded through the songs, too, in order to save our ears and digestion.

If, however, you'd like a modicum of plot, character, story and competent acting to go with it, you might like to take your business elsewhere.Various transients pitch up at a farm where the owners imprison and enslave their workers, and, in a limping hour or so, with no discernible story-line, are - you guessed it - tortured and killed.  The film-makers seem to think their lame, predictable punch-line (I can't dignify it with the word 'twist') makes up for the rotten film preceding it.What in God's name is the woman playing Lois doing?  She seems to think she's playing Widow Twanky at Bognor Playhouse.  Is she supposed to be a funny character?  Why does the Michael Madsen character show no surprise and ask no questions when he is told the skeleton in the mother's closet is kidnap and murder?  What are respectable actors like Dennis Hopper and Madsen doing in this mess anyway - was someone holding their loved ones hostage on a real torture-farm or something?It's tempting to over-bash a bad film just to be clever, so I will  say Madsen, Hopper and Connery are as skilful as the script allows, as for the most part were all the 'victims'.  It's mainly the villains who turn in those pantomime performances.The voiceover says that sometimes people stay in terrible situations because they have nowhere else to go.

Without spoiling it for anyone who wants to watch it, here's my review:This time out, AMC gives us the answers. We find out how the scenes in The Village and New York are related. No need for us to come up with our own theories as to ""what's it all about?"" I found myself more interested in Number Two than Number Six. This Number Six doesn't seem very passionate about his desire to escape and I found myself not really caring if he did or not. The ending, although a possibility brought up in the final episode of the original series, completely ruined the mini-series for me.How The Village came to exist and how the inhabitants ended up there was quite a stretch for me. It definitely made this series more sci-fi than drama. I did enjoy the many nods to the original series, the updated Village wardrobe, Ian McKellen's performance, and the improved Rover.I can't see this series having the timeless appeal of the original, but perhaps a younger viewer would disagree with me.If you're a fan of the original, you'll probably watch this and be disappointed like I was. Since this was made to target fans of the original series, I'd say it was a wasted effort.",The Prisoner
175022,"The other reviews for this seem to have been lifted from the regular version of the Polar Express DVD.  This review is solely for the 3D version.  If you haven't purchased it yet, avoid it like a petrified fruitcake.  I saw this film in 3D Imax and was so enchanted with the 3D effects that I couldn't wait for a 3D release of the DVD.  I was disappointed to see on the packaging that the 3D used the red/blue method which generally eliminates the color scheme of the movie right off the bat.  (I noticed that the 3D version of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" which was released the same day came with the more modern polarized glasses with the neutral color.  I haven't seen that yet and can't comment on the success of that process with that particular DVD)What makes this presentation of the Polar Express in 3D such a failure is that THE GLASSES DON'T JOIN THE RED AND BLUE CHANNELS INTO ONE IMAGE.  Everything in the mid to foreground is seen in double vision which is extremely annoying.  We switched to the 2D version less than 5 minutes into the film because it was too disconcerting to see 2 chins...4 arms...etc.  Whoever made the decision to present the film in this manner should be fired for incompetence.The bottom line is that THE 3D EFFECT IS SO INCREDIBLY SLIGHT that it can't outweigh the major problems with the faulty technique.  If you enjoy this film, as I do, avoid the disappointment and skip this disaster.  Maybe they'll try again in the future with a more successful presentation...until then...do yourself a favor STICK TO THE 2D VERSION!",N/A

760317,"In A Man Apart, agents Sean Vetter and Demetrius Hicks are part of Los Angeles' best drug enforcement agency, which is currently making an effort to strike a massive blow at the narcotics pipeline between the borders of United States and Mexico.  Shortly after a successful joint mission in putting one of the most elusive drug cartel leaders, Meno Lucero, in jail, Vetter's home becomes the target of a ruthless attack that results in his wife's death.  With the name Diablo as his only lead, Sean must find a way to discover the identity of this mysterious person who is claiming Lucero's operation as his own, and to avenge the murder of the love of his life.While I appreciate the attempt at infusing some semblance of a plot into an otherwise straight up action movie, however, the effort is inconsistent and ultimately hurts the picture as a whole.  Rather than focusing on either giving the audiences an action packed adventure or a heart felt drama, what we end up with is a film that is average in both areas.  The gunfights in A Man Apart were poorly shot and chaotic, at times it was hard to tell the differences between the good guys and the bad ones.  The twists in the story made very little sense, and even though the romance displayed between Diesel and co-star Jacqueline Obradors is sweet, it really did not work for me or convince me of Sean's desire for revenge.  I also find it silly when movies have the tendency to suggest that criminals become more powerful when they are behind bars, if that is the case, what is the point of arresting them?With the exception of Pitch Black, I have never been a big fan of Vin Diesel's performances.  His monotone delivery of lines is often devoid of any feelings, and when he does exhibit emotions, frequently they seem to be forced and unnatural.  The same is true in his portrayal of the protagonist Sean Vetter.  This is largely the reason why the movie failed, if you are unable to make a connection with the lead character, why would you care what happens to him?Larenz Tate plays Vetter's partner Demetrius Hicks.  The two of them were good friends while growing up.  Their aspiration to make a difference in their neighborhood instead of complaining about it motivated them to join the anti-narcotics law enforcement unit.  There really isn't much to say about Tate, he did not make much of an impression in his scenes opposite of Diesel.  Timothy Olyphant, on the other hand, went way overboard as Hollywood Jack.  One minute he is a blubbering fool, another minute he becomes a cold-blooded killer, the discrepancies in the way the role was depicted demonstrates how poorly the whole film was scripted.A Man Apart is a derivative and an awful movie.  The lack of good action sequences, in combination with a superficial plot and paper-thin characters, result in a mediocre fare that was neither fun nor exciting to watch.  As for Vin Diesel, he still lacks that one defining role that has made actors like Stallone (as Rambo) and Schwarzenegger (as the Terminator and Conan) such big names in the genre.",N/A

And one of my most favorite opera singers. I loved his role as Francis (which he won an award for) in &#34;A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries&#34; (also with Leelee Sobieski.) So I wanted to see him in this movie, &#34;Lying,&#34; as well. After watching this very very boring movie for some time anxiously waiting for him, I suddenly heard him singing out of nowhere at a random part. He sounded to be coming from outside the house, and with Sevingy's character not letting them go outside, all 4 girls end up running around the house trying to find out him and where this voice is coming from. Sometimes it sounds like he is in the house, in different places. So the whole scene just shows them frantically running around, while Sevingy's character ends up just standing at the fireplace with her glass of wine just watching and laughing at them. After a whole 5 minutes of this, she finally tells them that &#34;he's in the fireplace&#34; and they rush to see. He sings one last time. And that was that. He is never seen or heard again. His voice was beautiful and it was a fun scene at first but then it just became quite spooky and weird like he was a ghost. When asked if she knew who or what it was, she tells the girls &#34;no.&#34; Of course, she has a lot of secrets. They have a hard time believing this at first, but they all finally relax. One of the girls decides he should have a name, and picked out &#34;Timothy.&#34; So that's the story of the character &#34;Timothy.&#34; I was prepared that he just only might be a &#34;voice&#34; in the movie, and that if he was, that it would still be worth paying the money to see this. Was it? Ummmm......Other than that, it is just a really weird movie with actors who don't know what to do most of the time and so much randomness that doesn't make much sense. I don't know why this &#34;M&#34; decided to make this movie, and in only 15 days with NO actual script. Perhaps it was an experiment? Well, epic fail. Congratulations. I don't understand at all how or why this movie is still around but not a great one such as &#34;A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries.&#34; I had to buy it on ebay.",N/A

784903,"An utter waste of time. Save your money. I saw this on the big screen at a second run theatre. As I LOVE vampire movies, this sounded so promising...a sexy, high-style love story between a vampire girl and werewolve boy. Well, the PR people deserve a bonus for coming with THAT hogwash! Be forewarned: this isn't ""Buffy"" and there is no romance here at all. I don't think the characters hardly touched, let alone have a ""love affair"". One minor character appears to have had an interspecies romance in the far past, but it's not gone into. Set in England (or somewhere), it's very hard to tell, but most of the Eurotrash looking actors have British accents.Every cool movie of the last decade is mined here -- the bleak, colorless noir of ""The Crow"", the wire-work stunts and long leather coats of ""The Matrix"", the kick ass action of both ""Blade"" films, the vampire ""king"" from ""Interview with the Vampire"" and every Anne Rice novel ever written -- but to absolutely no effect. What plot there is, is nearly incomphrensible. The general principles of vampirism or werewolvism are disregarded...werewolves change at whim, and both silver bullets and daylight no longer work as in traditional tales.Kate Beckinsale, a fine young actress, is wasted in this garbage. What on earth could have convinced her to take this part? At least she looks great, wearing Michelle Pfieffer's catsuit from ""Batman"". Every one else in the film is so pitifully incompetent that it would add further injury to even name them. Trust me, this won't appear on anybody's resume.By midway, I was nodding off. If I'd been at home, I am sure I would have fallen asleep. One boring shoot out after another, often with very unclear results. The ending clears up nothing whatsoever about the ""plot"", which is nearly nonexistent.This is one of the worst movies I saw in 2003, and possibly the worst vampire/werewolf movie ever made. Abbot and Costello meet Dracula is Oscar material in comparison with this howling dog. AVOID AT ALL COSTS, even if it shows up on cable.",N/A

961744,"Being as this was a Sci-Fi original movie, and Sci-Fi Channel's reputation for churning out these kind of crappy movies all the time, I didn't expect much in the way of special effects quality or acting quality.  But the end result was too much of a joke to even dismiss as ""It's so bad it's good"".The plot is a convoluted mess failing to properly mix elements of Greek mythology, Hunnic history, and Christianity in an abortion of a myth involving a Celtic-looking Attila digging up a rusty sword and making an offering to Satan to make him a god and make his sword make him invincible.  For some reason, Satan has Cerberus guard the sword and Attila's corpse in hell.Then it extends into modern times, with a plot so poorly thought out using modern ideas like ""nukes"" and ransoming nations and drinking beer, you can't help but think someone here was fired from making spaghetti action films in the early 90s.  A rich Asian man hires some empty-headed Americans to steal Attila's breastplate (which amounts to a thin sheet of metal so flimsy it could shatter at any moment) from a museum in some foreign country (as noted by their 'foreign accents').  Because of one of the idiotic American's trigger-happiness, an important potential hostage is killed, and so they have to kidnap another woman and her brother and use them to get to Attila's sword.What little believable plot is left at this point simply fades away as it turns out this Asian guy mysteriously has a stockpile of nuclear weapons and yet plans on using the sword to threaten nations.  The American mercenary who gets the sword starts acting like a drunken idiot, spouting the worst cliche' lines in history and randomly attacking people in some Transylvanian village tavern.The actors are some of the worst pack you're likely to find outside of pornography, and the dialogue would make some porno movies look like Oscar-worthy performances.  Most of the character's lines, especially the Americans, consist of terrible cliche's like ""who let the dog out?"" and such exchanges about Greek myth like:American Woman: Orpheus tamed Cerberus using a lyre.American Doofus: Don't look at me!HAHAHA!

552538,"Organized in observance of the tenth anniversary of the death of Karajan, this concert of Mozart's Requiem in the cathedral of Salzburg is performed by the Berliner Philharmonik and Swedish Radio Choir conducted by Claudio Abbado. I found it a profound disappointment.Abaddo drives the ensemble far too fast, and the result is a deliriously-paced performance lacking in any sense of sanctity or gravitas. My favourite performance of the Requiem is that by Das Neue Orchester and Chorus Musicus Koeln under Christoph Spering, and while I understand that not all conductors are willing to keep the work as slowly paced as Spering, there's no excuse for the rushed handling of Abbado.The concert is rounded out with two arias, ""Betrachte dies mien Herz un Frage Mich"" and ""Laudate Dominum"" performed by Rachel Harnisch. While pretty, they add little to the DVD.The visuals of the DVD are mixed. The cathedral is a wonderful work of architecture, and the camera is often placed on its superb art. However, the shots of the orchestra and choir are not so pleasant. One of the choir members has ridiculous waxed moustaches that Salvador Dali could only envy, while some of the female performers are inappropriately dressed for a church. While the important thing is, of course, the music, the poor visuals of the DVD only spoil any enjoyment of the sound.All in all, I would not recommend this DVD. The Requiem is, of course, a wonderful piece of music, but there are better performances out there. Try the aforementioned disc conducted by Spering.",N/A

186732,"Filmed in 1973, the one that began it all. The book was actually split into two movies to fit all the plot! This is the first half of the book. An amazing, star-studded cast, great attention to detail and it's funny to boot!Let's see. Oliver Reed as Athos, Richard Chamberlain as Aramis, Frank Finlay as Porthos, Michael York as D'Artagnan. Christopher Lee, Raquel Welch, Geraldine Chaplin, Faye Dunaway. Just about every performance is amazing.This has the REAL plot - not the entirely made-up one Disney foisted on us. D'Artagnan is cheating on his landlord with his landlord's wife. The Queen of France is cheating on her husband, the King, with the Duke of Buckingham. The cardinal is trying to gain power of France. The Musketeers gladly steal food and cheat when necessary. It's a rough world out there!The attention to detail in the film is simply amazing. From the stunning costumes, to the silver-and-white ball at the end, to the interiors of the buildings, to the food they eat, wine they drink, games they play - it's all fully authentic. You could watch this in a history class and learn quite a bit.And the swordfighting!! None of this pretentious sword-waving and back-flipping. These guys were professional soldiers. They fought to win. This involved rough-and-tumble brawl tactics at times. I compare Athos' fighting style to Aragorn's in Lord of the Rings. His aim was to stay alive and to keep his comerades alive, not to look pretty when he fought.Now for the BIG WARNING.

Not in the same ballpark/planet as anything Lee, Chan, Li, or Crouching Tiger..., Hero, House of Flying Daggers.(2.) The low budget of this film was most obvious when initially we are shown a small number of bad guys but when the battles begin it seems as if that number has tripled or even become endless as they are mown down in order to prolong the attention-getting action scenes. Yet when the final scene shows the field of battle the body count adds up to less than what we were first shown. May I suggest some remedial math for the director.(3.) Daryl Hannah - no point to her role in the movie, in fact you could have erased her scenes and the movie would have moved forward with better fluidity. Her acting was so terrible I was actually feeling sorry for her. Carradine's was not much better.(4.)

Certainly didn't end as well as the book by far.  Scenes between characters barely exist.  If you like action, you'll love the film.  It's filled with it.I would much rather have seen more of the story line, and much less of the action.  There was practically no story line at all.

The episodes themselves are great 5-star affairs.I just wanted to give a heads-up to prospective buyers that this box set is a bit of a letdown. The salt and pepper shakers are miniatures that stand about three inches tall, the so-called ""original script"" is a cheap miniature photocopy of a script (and is hardly legible), and as for it being signed, well, think again. It is not literally signed. What you really get is a photocopy of Larry David's signature on a small and useless photocopy of a script, with photocopies of illegible scribings by David throughout the script. If you want a signed script, I'd suggest looking elsewhere for one that is literally signed in-person and has a Certificate of Authenticity.

1387124,"Independent Christian dramas have been the subject of some ridicule, primarily because they're often low budget affairs that wear their messages on their sleeves and feature sometimes questionable acting. Courageous manages at least to exhibit competent filmmaking, even if, as with previous films of its kind, it caters a little too heavily to a very specific demographic to be openly enjoyable for all. Set against the backdrop of the drug trade in Georgia, Courageous follows four deputies -- all fathers -- who are urged by their sheriff to spend more time with their families. When tragedy befalls one of the deputies, all four of them make a formal pact to change their lives and honor God in all that they do. My primary complaint had nothing to do with the message of the film itself; rather, I found Courageous to be a bit melodramatic and heavy-handed, choosing to gloss over complex issues with broad platitudes. If you're a believer, you may find yourself nodding in approval at the film, but don't expect Courageous to do much more than spoonfeed you what you already know it's going to say.",Courageous

I think ""Evita"" will always be her best and greatest role, and maybe she should have quit while she was ahead.I saw this film out of curiosity, because it didn't make it to theaters where I lived.  I enjoy films about being stranded on a deserted island, so I thought this might be worth a look.  As I watched it, I couldn't believe how incredibly bad it is, but I couldn't place my finger on what exactly was so bad about it.  I'm not sure if Guy Ritchie should be blamed for it or Madonna, but something with this movie is off.  With bad acting and a bad plot, this film is probably one of the worst I've ever seen.  On the DVD, the only saving grace is seeing a feature where Guy Ritchie and Madonna interview each other.  I wish that was offered on a separate DVD, because I'd buy that...and I don't want this film in my collection.  Its a film that should have stayed in the private collection of Ritchie/Madonna's home movies.  At the very least, I hope this film kills any chance that Madonna will be given another starring role in any future film project.  She's great in ""Die Another Day"", ""A League of Their Own"", and ""Dick Tracy"" but she can't carry a film (except ""Evita"") on her own.

What we have here is a movie written on the back of a cocktail napkin.  Just some of the problems...1. Never take your arch villain and replicate him hundreds of times (Agent Smith).  Not only is it silly and pointless, it takes away any menacing characteristics this villain may have had.2. Never endow your hero with superman-like powers.  If he can do anything, it takes away any suspense.3. Never intentionally obscure your plot with psycho-babble and cryptic references.4. Never make an excellent sci-fi movie and then follow it up with a peice of garbage like this.

I might be in the minority here, but as I watched it I could not help but feel that I had somehow tuned into a bad, boring Lifetime made for TV movie. I kept expecting Judith Light or Shanon Doherty to appear.  The performances were not compelling, and I can't for the life of me understand how Kidman received such priase for this yawner.  I guess if you stick a big piece of bubblegum in the tip of your nose, ugly yourself up a bit, that becomes award winning acting.

305540,"I know this review will earn me boos, hisses, and &quot;not helpful&quot; votes, but my wife and I (both lovers of old movies) watched this a few nights back and frankly, we were baffled.  Howard Hawks has made his share  of movies with &quot;men's men&quot;, but these characters are the most  opaque and wooden I've ever seen!  They are air-freight pilots delivering  to the treacherous Andes mountain area, led by the normally charming (or at  least interesting) Cary Grant.  When the first pilot takes to air in the  film (Noah Beery, I believe), you can hear in the inflection of his voice  over the intercom that he seems resigned to his fate--the fog's closing in,  and he's doomed to crash.  Indeed he does, as do a number of the other  pilots that follow in the film.  The job doesn't seem to have any merits  above its risks, and Jules Furthman's turgid script doesn't give us any  hint as to why these men would risk their lives doing this job.  It's  implicit that flying IS their life, and there's this hunger that is  satisfied only through this activity.  But it's a tenet of the movie and a  credo of the men that nothing needs to be explained, it's a man thing, and  one just needs to move on.  So what we get for &quot;entertainment&quot;  almost borders on parody, as mission after mission goes awry, and the  tight-lipped toughies muddle through.  For romantic interest, there's Jean  Arthur as an itinerant showgirl who almost immediately falls in love with  Grant, though he &quot;wouldn't force a girl to do anything she didn't want  to&quot; and no woman has been able to cope with the stress of living that  close to death (though, in the film, Grant never actually gets up in a  plane); there's also Rita Hayworth, one of his exes, who's now with  McPherson (Richard Barthelmess), a pilot who bailed and let his partner die  in a previous air accident.  He of course, gets to redeem himself, and at  the end gets to nurse a beer with the guys, cradling it in his burnt and  bandaged hands.  Hayworth also tries to seduce Grant, to no avail.  Eventually the girls fall into line (acting appropriately stoic), and  Arthur decides to hang around after Grant, in his typical off-handed way  lets her know he loves her (via a two-headed coin)--but he loves flying  more.  I couldn't fathom this movie or this closed society; the story is  slow and repetitive and the actors have been directed to suppress every bit  of charm or life they have within them (you can see it trying to escape  from Jean Arthur)--it's all very morose, banal and a trial to sit through.

How else to explain the ego-driven mess that is ""Under the Cherry Moon,"" a hilariously campy feature directed by Prince?  His last movie, ""Purple Rain"" (1984), was no masterpiece by any standard, but it at least had energy and an often compelling storyline.  This 1986 followup, which has neither, was created to exploit, not nurture, Prince's celebrity as an actor.  His Royal Badness is Christopher Tracy, a playboy living in France with his buddy Tricky played by former member of the Time, Jerome Benton.  He crosses paths with a young lady (Academy Award nominee Kristen Scott-Thomas, in her debut role) whom he romances against the wishes of her uptight socialite parents.  The familiar plot probably wouldn't matter if this film weren't directed so shabbily. As a movie actor, Prince is the stuff Razzie nightmares are made of.  Like virtually all pop stars who appear in movies, he seems to think that posing compensates for a performance.  But what may work in a 4-minute music video can spell disaster when stretched over a 2-hour movie.  Kristen Scott-Thomas is one big exclamation point, overemoting and overacting with an exaggerated British accent (wait, I thought this movie is set in France).

The warning signals also go off when this movie's paltry running time of barely an hour and a half is compared to the original's 110 minute run. Already that makes it sound quick and slapped together without much love or interest. And also, if you don't have any of the original players involved, then why bother at all?. Trey Stone and Matt Parker from ""South Park"", were originally going to do it, but then they backed out. What we got were no name writers and a no name director with not one redeemable value. While there is the presence of comedy genius Eugene Levy, and the always game Cheri Oteri, the rest of the cast were nobody's.

He is the son of the school janitor and lives in the school. Derek Richardson takes over for Jeff Daniels in the role of Harry Dunn. He has an imaginary pirate friend and lives with his mom(Mimi Rogers). The movie takes place in 1986, and the film does give off that 80's type of look. The two boys run into each other one day, quite literally, and a bond is made. They become the quickest friends and Lloyd helps Harry at school because he has been home schooled up until this point. Levy plays the school principal, Principal Collins, and Oteri is the lunch lady. The two are having an affair, and set in motion what is to become what passes for a plot for this movie. Schools are being offered a large sum of money for having a ""special needs class"", and with this school not having one, the two plan to create a fake one in order to get the money and run. Naturally, Lloyd and Harry are the first two into the new class, and are then in charge of putting together the rest of the class. This means rounding up a number of goofballs and losers. The only familiar face in the bunch is Shia LeBouf from ""Even Stevens"". The boys get mixed up in the scheme, and with help from a lovely student, must crack the plan wide open. Yawn. This is the best they could come up with?. It took 9 years and this is what we get?. There aren't many laughs in here. Not many chuckles either. Olsen, as Lloyd, seems to be really game, and he is kind of impressive. There are times when it seems as if he is channeling Carrey, and it works. Most of the time. But while Carrey's Lloyd was a loveable goofball, Olsen's Lloyd is just a goofball. The same can be said for Richardson's Harry. Although the resemblances are pretty good. The jokes are not as frequent as you would have liked, and more importantly, are not really funny. The first film's humor and jokes and gags just seem to come naturally. The ones here seem forced and the scenes seem too photographed and planned. There are may gaps in the script as well. Why not delve into why Lloyd and his father shouldn't be father and son?. They could of explained that. There are too many flaws and stuff that just went downhill with no show of effort of even trying to succeed. They tried to live up to the ""toilet"" scene from the original, and while it failed, it was the one moment in the film that *might* give you a laugh, even though it goes against your better judgement. Bob Saget appears in an uncredit cameo, and his two scenes are the only two that made me laugh a little. It's nothing special, but under the circumstances, and with the cursing involved, and it being squeaky clean ""Full House"" Bob Saget, it made me laugh for some reason. If Jim Carrey, Jeff Daniels, and The Farrelly Brothers aren't involved, then there was no really no hope of this project becoming anything. It was tired, bloated with unfunny jokes and sight gags that were so uninspired, and was just a waste. It could of been something if certain people had been involved, but they weren't, and this film suffers because of it. Pass.",N/A

However, for some reason it is trendy for movie critics to love anything Kubrick releases.  That is why this movie is so &quot;highly rated&quot;.  Is it because critics actually like it?  No.  It is because if they show favor for a film NOBODY understands, it makes them look and feel &quot;above&quot; the average person.

1130132,"I honestly don't want to waste my time with this but I too have watched this film. I do enjoy George Romero zombie flicks and after watching this I thought this was a joke. More disappointed actually cause all I got was some rookie director coming up with a 'remake' of one of the master's well known title and jacking it all up. A rookie in the sense of trying to capture the dark, gritty, viciousness of the zombie epidemic as envisioned by Romero in his earlier films. Steve Miner has directed episodes of Dawson's Creek, (which explains some of this film's truly boring dialog and Ken and Barbie type characters) and Smallville (which has effectively turned Superman into a soap opera).What Miner has done here is show us that he can capture all of the plot lines, and zombie behavior previously shown in a dozen zombie flicks, put Mena Suvari (of American Beauty) in the lead and make a horrible horror movie.While this film might appeal to young folks who don't understand the art as developed by Romero, those who do will undoubtedly turn away from this one after the first half hour. It only takes that long to get an idea of the poor characters. Suvari plays an army Corporal (who carries a gun with no bullets. Why even pull it out?) Ving Rhames has a small part, perhaps wise enough to not stick around. Suvari's character is remarkably calm in the face of danger despite her seemingly bad decision making. The rest of the cast are like refugees from a Dawson's Creek episode. Nick Cannon (Mariah Cary's husband) plays the part of the bad a.., machismo Army Private, and while not giving a particularly good performance, due in part to the horrible script, Cannon does manage to bring some charisma and toughness to the character.The zombies seem to do extraordinary things one moment (like crawl on ceilings and run real fast-like the Dawn of the Dead remake), but when it comes to attacking the lead actors they seem inept. This picture doesn't do any justice to the zombie film genre. It ranks down there with the very low budget. The title was used to possibly draw attention to it's existence, nothing more.",N/A

Almost everything would have appeared alien to her, and imaginative guess work can only offer a very modest speculation about what she would have thought of fancy cars and rock music.But one thing is for sure, she would have certainly known the difference between mediocrity and creativity! And alas this newest and loosest of interpretations of her classic masterpiece of love, passion and betrayal would have made her wish she never wrote it in the first place.Modern interpretations of classics are by no means a bad venture, as the examples of Baz Luhrmann's Romeo+Juliet and Alfonso Cuaron's Great Expectations clearly demonstrate,but the problem with the MTV's version of Bronte's classic is its mediocrity..just a plain, lifeless and average direction and acting. Had the film had a different title, and had MTV did not market it in an 'in your face hip, cool, trendy and young' way, then maybe it would have been much more bearable.MTV's venture into the world of movie making has not been a glorious success so far, and simply because they are following the same approach and mental frame that they take in their musical and reality TV productions, and this is a big mistake.Anyway, the overbearing and passionate  Victorian world of Bronte and her dramatic but sadly short life were very much part of her work, yet her stories with their universal themes do indeed belong to all the ages, and make good movie material, if only the script, direction and acting are good enough to retain the spirit of the book, while infusing it with a modern outlook.

Why does Hollywood repeatedly gear Science Fiction films to the mentality of teenage boys? Memo to Hollywood: THERE'S A MARKET FOR GROWN-UPS, even for Sci-Fi!!! Will someone please fill this nitch! PLEASE! I'm not asking for perfection, or genius. Just an ending without any ridiculous predictability, which, in turn, is devoid of any meaning, or real satisfaction. A film where more than half the time is NOT focused on killing and body counts. No more Wonder Women, (or men) who barely get scratched in mortal combat, or don't even bother to break into a sweat! In other words, out with the old LOWEST CAMP DENOMINATOR, and in with some new GROWN-UP STORY TELLING!The world of Aeon Flux is where men are either fools; conservative mass murderers; or fall like cardboard, and die like butter. Women, on the other hand, are tough as steal; have muscles; sleep with men and then knock them out, (ouch!); kill with such perfection, and ease, I thought they must be cyborgs; and single-handedly change the course of history!Here's a future where no one bothers to take a look on the other side of a big wall in 400-years! Human cloning and the quest for immortality are the root of all evil! Where killing pregnent women is done in order to keep the status quo, that is, mostly men in charge!Oh, yes the special-effect-eye-candy is magnificent! Too bad the storyline is two dimentional.

3672,"I can't express with what anticipation I look forward to this dramatization of C. S. Forester's superb Hornblower novels or the equally crushing disappointment with which I viewed the result.  Once again, a  masterpiece of literature has been destroyed by a screen dramatists attempt  to &quot;improve&quot; it.  Again and again, plots, incidents and  characters have been altered from those set forth in Forester's novel  &quot;Mr. Midshipman Hornblower&quot; and in every instance the  screenwriter's decision has cheapened or weakened the end product.  Worst  of all have been the attempts at &quot;political correctness.&quot;  I can  never remember Hornblower being portrayed as being so buddy-buddy with the  common seaman, Forester (accurately) depicted the distant if respectful  relationship between the two seafaring classes.  And Hornblower never never  NEVER expressed any sympathy for the French Revolution!  The scene where  the French villagers sing the Marseillese while their compatriots are  executed never appeared in the novel and was of course blatantly stolen  from &quot;Casablanca.&quot;  (I might add that in my opinion that cretins  who burn works of art for firewood and use rare books to prop up table legs  deserve anything they get!)

Or could he somehow redeem the embarrassment that was ""Revenge of the Fallen"" and re-capture the excitement and solid sci-fi/action spirit of the first movie?  Well, the answer is no.  At the risk of repeating other disappointed reviewers, ""Dark of the Moon"" is an utterly lazy, mind-numbingly stupid re-hash of cliches, offensive potty humor, and implausible ""action"" scenes that insult the intelligence even of fans willing to go to great lengths to suspend disbelief for the sake of this movie (a dozen mostly-retired soldiers with 21st century firearms and 6-8 Autobots wipe out hundreds (or thousands...it's not really clear since they position themselves around the whole planet) of Decepticons armed with futuristic lasers??

More pointless blather from Sam's parents; more offensive sterotypes in the form of bit-part Autobots; lots of blurry action that is so close-up you can't even tell what's happening.  It's as if Michael Bay decided since he did a decent job the first time, there was no need wasting good animation on the point of the WHOLE FRANCHISE: robots that ""Transform"" into vehicles!  The first film actually put some effort into depicting these scenes in CG.  In Dark of the Moon, the machines just pop in-and-out of vehicle or robot mode so fast you hardly notice.

He makes a very strong statement about how a very successful company like Paramount can stoop so low to cashing in on tons and tons of money by putting together a quick and cheap collection of THE FRIDAY THE 13TH SERIES.  You know what?  Paramount can make tons of money off of this collection and you know why?  Because they can and they are smart because they know that there are tons and tons of stupid people out there who love these movies and would pay a lot to buy it.  I only wish it was the other way around..... SMART people who will only buy a collection of movies that live up to the films itself by including 2 versions of each film (theatrical version & the uncut, undeleted or added extra footage version), along with a director's commentary and special features that includes movie trailers, etc...  Not to forget Paramount should restore back to each of the film's original movie poster for each DVD,  in other words, use the original cover as it was released in theaters and not a new or cheap upgrade picture to replace the old pictures....  what's up with that... I totally hate the new movie pictures,  I rather have the old ones,  just gives it more color and a touch up thats all.Well back to the other subject of stupid people who will cash in on these cheap version from Paramount,  you people out there need to wake up and not buy these movies, save your money and just buy the movies individually or better yet go to EBAY there are tons of them there now.  Trust me I am a BIG Friday The 13TH and HALLOWEEN fan,  but Paramount won't do this collection of Friday The 13TH movies any justice they deserve,  Paramount is even ashamed to have it's name put on these films.

920390,"A mostly phenomenal multiethnic cast is squandered in Paul Haggis' hysterically overheated and laughably - and ultimately depressingly - one-dimensional take on race relations (and barely anything else) in modern-day Los Angeles. I absolutely agree with David Edelstein's 'Slate' review: ""Haggis wants to distill all the resentment and hypocrisy among races into a fierce parable. But the old-fashioned carpentry (evocative of '30s socially conscious melodrama) makes this portrait of How We Live Now seem preposterous at every turn. A universe in which we're all racist puppets is finally just as simpleminded and predictable as one in which we're all smiling multicolored zombies in a rainbow coalition.""Right after I watched `Crash', my first impression was: What if the Mayor of Los Angeles set up a meeting with some movie studio heads and said, ""You know something, this city is getting just too crazy & overpopulated, and we really need to do something about it.  How about making an `anti-infomercial' for our town that depicts this place as unsavory, freakishly hostile, and all-around reprehensible & uninhabitable as possible?""If you don't happen to think this movie is shallow, I'd just like to point out what a perfect match it would make in a flashy DVD 2-pak right alongside 'Falling Down,' with Michael Douglas taking his ludicrous Alienated-White-Man `agenda' out on the big, bad & oh so unjust metropolis!  Seriously - `Crash' is that ridiculous movie's unofficial sequel, only with a fractured, quasi-Altmanesque story structure that is teeth-gnashingly contrived in its hokey setups and payoffs.  This is melodrama of such spectacular grandiosity and pomposity that it must make executive producers of daytime soap operas scarlet-faced and shuddering with envy.Still, I will wager anyone who's interested that 'Crash' is going to be the big upset at this year's Oscars & win Best Picture instead of `Brokeback Mountain' - it's just melodramatic & `controversial' and `tough-minded' and `hard-hitting' enough to be considered `serious movie-making'...when very unfortunately it is only what PASSES for serious movie-making these days.And while we're on the subject - what in the world is up with Tony Danza's cameo as the mega-racist Second Coming Of Satan!?

I had some hope for this one, which has a pretty solid stable of B-movie and TV staples (Nana Visitor, Corbin Bernsen, Alison Eastwood, Bruce Boxleitner, Hunter Tylo-- yes, Hunter Tylo!), but let's face it-- this is godawful in every sense.The story: a small town in Anywhere, America is hiding a host of aliens. Some of the town's kids find out about it. Of course, the alien invasion must be stopped! Except that, well, you know, they're already here.The script had some great ideas; unfortunately, it does as little as possible with them. (Who thinks up a colony of aliens having a plastic surgeon on retainer? That's brilliant.) Worse, it seems to be trying to be as confusing as possible for the first hour; worse still, once the confusion is (somewhat) alleviated by Obrow tying the threads together, things get only marginally less confusing.

I was hoping I'd love this one.Unfortunately, the whole production just oozes a half-baked aura, undoubtably the work of a writer/director (Dennis Feldman) who was not ready for prime time.All of the situations feel episodic, the character motivations are murky, and the laughs are MIA.  Mediocre scene after mediocre scene -- Ritter using his finger as a gun, the rendezvous with the Russian agent, the scene with the dominatrix in Pittsburgh, Ritter beating up the burglars, the clowns -- just don't work and are largely humorless.Thus, relegate Real Men to the dubious list of 80's flicks that were lost opportunities (see: Volunteers, Hot Pursuit).",N/A

Lily Tomlin is a talented actress (vide her role in The West Wing) as well as a superb comedian.Paul Rudd is a cuddly and adorable love interest, as I fondly recall from Clueless and Friends.The book on which the movie is based is an utterly excellent tour de force of superb writing.So why was this movie a failure?There are several reasons.  For one, the plot bears little resemblance to the plot of the book.  The book was excellent, but its plot was not particularly adaptable into a movie, because plot is not really what the book is about in the first place.For another, the book, while not tragic, is not remotely funny or comedic, and could not have been intended to be.  The heroine's mother in the book is both charmless and damaging; her idiosyncrasies (to use too trivial a word) cause pain to those around her.  There is nothing funny about her.  Nor is there anything funny about the heroine's life, either the events that befall her in the novel or that happened before the book opened.  How anyone imagined that the book could be turned into a comedy--or even a movie with comedic moments--is beyond me.  The book is a comedy in the technical sense that a blossoming romance is involved, but not in any other way.No wonder so many of the reviews described this movie as schizophrenic.

1124719,"Catacombs (Tomm Coker and David Elliott, 2007)Catacombs, as far as I could ever tell, was made expressly to give mediocre pop singer Pink some sort of entree into the film world. And if you look at it as nothing more than this, it succeeds, on the level that, well, Pink is on film, though she's an even worse actress than she is a singer. In every other way, however, the film is as absolute a failure as is possible, and its only real saving grace is that it's not the worst movie I've seen today (that honor would go to Dark Fields, which, despite us only being four days into the year, I am 90% certain will be one of the five worst movies I see in 2009).The pop tart and Shannyn Sossamon (Wristcutters: A Love Story) star as sisters. Pink is Carolyn, the wild one, currently enrolled in graduate school at the Sorbonne. Sossamon is Victoria, the staid undergraduate student with mental problems. Carolyn invites Victoria to France for a vacation, and as the movie opens, Victoria is arriving in Paris. Carolyn has plans to take Victoria to a rave in the catacombs; things get weird when Victoria, already away from her usual meds and having taken a dose of absinthe (and really, why is it that absinthe supposedly has these incredible qualities?), gets separated from Carolyn and her friends, and becomes convinced that a serial killer who lives in the catacombs, whom the group had been telling her about, is chasing her.The main problem with the movie is its pace; one wonders (or should) how the movie is going to continue on when everything you read about on the back of the box has already happened within the first twenty minutes, and you've still got seventy to go. Excellent question, and the answer is, ""the movie will bore you to tears as, essentially, nothing happens for sixty of those seventy minutes."" Then come the final ten, and while I admit to cheering a bit when Victoria reaches the obvious conclusion during the climactic scene, but honestly, did no one see that coming?As well, Coker and Elliott are another directorial team who have mistaken the idea that ""overly dark"" and ""atmospheric"" are identical, and thus about half the movie is very difficult to see. Brilliant. The acting is, at its best, competent (Sossamon is normally half-decent, but her role here mostly involves standing and screaming, running and screaming, and falling down and screaming). The big plot twist is painfully obvious from, oh, a minute and a half into the movie (or, if you're really not paying attention, you may not figure it out till half an hour or so), and while I admit that it's a good plot twist (in the sense that I was mutely cheering for Sossamon's character for actually making a halfway intelligent choice during the climax), the predictability of it did rather dull the fun.

1635348,"Having seen several extremely well-done independent film adaptions of H.P. Lovecraft's work over the last few years (seeThe Color Out Of Space,Call of Cthulhu, TheandWhisperer in Darkness, I had high hopes for this full-length feature of one of Lovecraft's best short stories, ""Cool Air"" - but almost from the first moments, I could tell that the creators of this film had no idea how to tell a properly-paced story, or much know much about the importance of location, casting, or creating suspense.  Although I imagine that it's possible to transport Lovecraft's early 20th Century pulp writings to a modern-day setting, putting the action in Malibu, California is a mistake - everything's too sunny and bright; Lovecraft's stories cry out for shadows and Noir-like settings.  The director's wife adapted the story, and she relies FAR too much on pre-title exposition and voice-overs (which is not helped by the droning, emotionless voice of lead actor Morgan Weisser, best known for his role on the short-livedSpace Above and Beyond - The Complete Series), but she also adds loopy, unlikable new characters, as if she were trying to marry Lovecraft with a storyline ripped from Twin Peaks.  The director, not knowing how to build suspense, instead relies almost entirely on ""gotcha"" moments and lame video effects (including repeated images of a goat).  A waste of time and energy by all involved.  Lovecraft purists would do far better to stick withThe H.P. Lovecraft Collection, Vol. 1: Cool Airwhich has the story told to far better effect than this bloated, dull adaption.",Cool Air

1150838,"In a nutshell, this film was make to revolt the viewer.  There is no deep meaning or underlying message.  It is a pile of slime with licking popped-out rotten dead eyeballs.  There is also animal violence in this film.  The film maker takes a cute little rabbit and has it murdered so he can make buck.  The murder of the animal is not a special effect. He kills the animal in the most inhumane way possible, making sure the viewer can see the pain and suffering of this innocent living creature.  Then he skins the rabbit's body making sure to get in close for all to see.  Is this art? The director is so proud of killing the rabbit that he shows the skinned carcass over and over again throughout the film.Here is a movie that can be used to get rid of unwanted guests.  Just show it and people will think the host is a perverted creep who enjoys sickness.  This piece of crapola can be found on other Internet cites for about $20.00.  It it total garbage.

Harrison Ford is his same old self, literally, he is OLD and rather out of place. Lucas hasn't lost his touch - that is from Epsiode I and on, this seems to be one more ""sell more toys"" movie without any other regard, except of course use CGI at every chance. Spielberg?

The fact that neither year nor location of this massacre were mentioned - I can only assume he was referring to Wounded Knee - bode ill for the portrayal of Native Americans in this film.Next, I was treated to an unctuous description of how the area we call Colorado today was formed.

No comment was made that there were no horses on the American continent until the Spaniards ""imported"" them.Twenty minutes into the first tape I had to stop watching because I found the way Native Americans are portrayed unbearable: The Arapaho wondering if a white man might be a god? In 1785? After Whites had been in the country for nearly 200 years? (Not to mention that, to the best of my knowledge, Plains Indians' religions did not include the concept of gods.)

972711,"As a film it's professionally made. However, Israeli films like this one, Lemon Tree and others like James Journey to Jerusalem, Beaufort, and Waltzing With Bashir cause great damage to Israel with their negative depiction of Israelis. There are extremes on both sides, rich, poor, strong or weak, but the general tendancy of the leftist liberal Israeli filmmakers is to complain, point out what's bad about Israel, criticize rather than show us what's beautiful and positive, i.e., Israeli doctors saving the lives of hundreds of Palestinians in Israeli hospitals, Arab-Israeli students enjoying one of the highest standards of education, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, national medical insurance, benefits Jews in Arab countries never enjoyed. Rather they were persecuted, and 800,000 of them were expelled from their homes from 1948-1950. Mostly Israelis in Israeli films are seen as unsympathetic, brutal bullies abusing the ""poor victimized"" Palestinians, while the Palestinians are glorified as heroic, resisting Israeli racism, far from the truth. Whenever Israeli leftist filmmakers deal with the Palestinians they are apologetic, forgetting the thousands of Israeli civilians and soldiers (young sons & daughters of Israel) murdered and maimed by Arab wars and Palestinian terror spanning 60 years since the birth of the nation, and going back to the 1800's culminating with the slaughter of the entire unarmed Jewish population of Hebron in 1929. One must also remember that Palestinians murdered and maimed 100,000 Christians in Lebanon which provoked the Christian revenge at Sabra and Shatila that got extensive media coverage while atrocities committed by the Palestinians & Muslims were and still are covered up out of fear of offending them even following the 9/11, and Ft. Hood murders. Israelis should learn PR from the Arabs who will never, ever criticize their suicide bombers and terrorist gunmen, rather they celebrate them as great heroes and martyers, boasting about their crimes rather than expressing guilt or shame over their murder and maiming of civilians. Syrian Bride shows the Syrian-Druze as hating Israel. Why not make a film about the thousands of heroic Israeli-Druze who serve in elite Israeli combat units and love Israel and serve in the Isreali army with honor? Anyone seeing these negative Israeli films gets a distorted view of Israel and its valiant people, and I deplore not only these stupid films, but the Israel Film Center that support these ""Israel bashing"" movies. One yearns to see Israeli films return to days when Israel was represented by the lumnious and humane films i.e., I Love You Rosa, and The Policeman, or see Israeli filmmakers make films about Israelis like My Fat Greek Wedding which presented Greeks (in America) lovingly, and since Israeli-Arab Jews and Greeks have such similar cultures, one wonders why Jews cannot make such films about themselves that would endear them to the world. Israel has such a rich culture, whereas a majority of Jews in America immigrated from Eastern Europe and predominantly ""Yiddish"" culture, the majority of Jews in Israel have either been there for centuries following their return from Spain in the 14th century, or were among the Jewish refugees expelled from Arab countries and they have very colorful Sephardi/Hebrew/Arab influenced cultures that can be translated delightfully into film. It's time for Israel to start making positive films about themselves, their heroes, i.e., the great warriors who have fought to protect Israel and preserve the Jewish nation, i.e., Avi Kahalani, and other heroes like him who fought for their country with honor. The time has come to stop appeasing and kissing the asses of Arabs and uphold Israel as a heroic nation which it is for others to see, i.e, while no Arab help came to Haiti earthquake victims, a team of 222 Israeli doctors and other emergency personnel went to help rescue the Haitian people, providing them with medical and other humanitarian assistance. The UN calls Israeli war criminals for protecting themselves, but are silent when Israeli civilians are massacred. That's what we want to see Jews of Israel as heroes, not Israelis complaining, bitching and moaning about Israel. We want to see stories about the heroic saga of the Jewish Etheopians in Israel adusting to living in the 20th century, stories of heroic survivors of Palestinian terrorism rising triumphnat over losing their limbs, or losing loved ones, or the heroic rescue of Israeli students held hostage by Palestinians terrorists at Ma'alot High School. Stories to inspire rather than discourage.

I will say that even with all of the negative reviews the plot sounded liked something I would like and of course I figured it cant be that bad if ashley judd and harry connick were main characters. Well, it may not be the worst film ever as some have said, but it is close.....Frankly, it was not scary or even suspensful...I saw the caption which said if bugs scare you this is not the movie for you....Well, did we ever actually see any bugs, except for the brief 1/2 second cut in's? Nope. The entire film was very boring....the first 45 minutes are downright awful as nothing at all happens other then watching people talk in a dingy motel room...when the actual plot comes out after the first 45 minutes it simply was awful...a complete and utter waste of time....Not scary (even if you get creeped out by bugs there should be little reason for this to creep you out), not suspensful, not entertaining...the ending completely sucked....Do not waste your time on this flick...I have a movie collection with over 3000 movies.

I also recorded it to my DVR and had a copy on an external hard drive as well.....After watching it, I can assure you the SE disc will never be used again and I have already deleted it from my DVR and external hard drive...Yes, it was that bad.....It was simply awful.

Kung-Fu Master is no piece of art, as a movie or as a genre entry. Dou Xiao's direction is incredibly poor, and the martial arts are a curious mix of actual skill, badly done (and silly) wire-fu, and cut-aways evincing incredibly bad editing. While a plot can be thin in this genre, it should at least be serviceable. This movie has no discernible plot, and the end makes zero sense.What's good about it? Well, Kung-Fu Master has some excellent long shots of some of the fights that incorporate several combatants at once. Most of these sequences involve fights with javelins or sticks. There's also (I think?) good effort displayed by star Yuen Biao, but the wire-fu and endless cuts always make you question whether it's real or completely faked.It almost seems as though the movie is trying to be a modern day version of one of those cheesy chop-socky movies from the 70s, but I can't quite believe the people behind Kung-Fu Master had that much vision.

But there's NO evidence the Orcas ARE, nor, any other ""captured"" animal, mammal, reptile, etc.However, COMMON SENSE would also dictate, that these Trainers CHOSE A DANGEROUS PROFESSION, AND SOMETIMES, THAT DANGER BECOMES REALITY -- IT HAPPENS -- THEY KNOW THIS GOING IN & CHOOSE TO DO IT ANYWAY... JUST LIKE POLICE OFFICERS & FIRE FIGHTERS (only the former's is a million times more certain)!!Clearly, these people made their choice to work with these Dangerous Animals/Mammals... You don't blame the Animal/Mammal for the accident(s) because ""they're just animals and don't know any better"", or whatever... Well, you can't blame the ""entity"" either, because THEY DID NOT FORCE THE TRAINER TO BE A TRAINER, TO WORK THERE, etc.; and no matter how ""humanely"" a wild animal/mammal is captured, transported, and housed... it is, and will always be, (in this case, a LARGE), DANGEROUS, LETHAL THING... and no amount of ""training"" will remove that aspect of its nature!!-- I swear, it's like all notions of PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY are as foreign as Orcas are to land!And the quote, ""There's no record of any Orca being violent in the wild"", was by far the most ludicrous of the countless, insane ramblings, offered up.  -- THEY'RE CARNIVOROUS (""KILLER"") WHALES YOU IDIOT!!!Plus, as if you can honestly compare the millions of hours of CONSTANT observation done in captivity, to A FEW HOURS of GLIMPSED ""activity"" out in the open ocean, as an actual comparison-argument... LOL; but they try, along with every other conceivable way, to mislead, and lie, rather than have an OPEN AND HONEST DEBATE about whether we should/shouldn't have captive 'wilds' at all (in 'Public' or 'Private' entities).-- Personally, I would be 100% fine if every 'wild' was returned to the wild, set free, and all Zoos, etc., were closed entirely/permanently... but that will never happen... And these attacks, while extremely rare, will continue.Regardless, this is without question, the most insane, ideologically inept, maddening, and brain-numbing piece of crap, this year... possibly, of all time.",N/A

524055,"This may be the worst movie I have sat all the way through.I kept thinking (or hoping) not that it would get better but that it would get less bad.It didn't.  It just went from bad to worse.This is chiefly because of bad writing throughout, lame special effects, and bad--spectacularly bad--acting on the part of the two principal white males.Cole Hauser, who plays Vin Diesel's Probation Officer, learned acting in modeling school: to act, strike poses.  He overacts, or I should say overposes, shamelessly.Vin Diesel has the opposite technique.  He apparently filmed this while in a coma.  Either that or he phoned it in, and his body was produced by special effects.The women aren't bad, but nothing can redeem this hopeless clunker.Even the creatures aren't very frightening.  And the more you see them, the less frightening they get.  All of $1.75 was spent on their computer animation.And at least that much was spent on red-syrup for blood.  There is also a lot of blue-syrup for blood.  This is either the creatures' blood, or simply some arty filming.Also in the Arty Filming Dept. is the overall YELLOW of the first scenes.  Later this is dropped, with no explanation.  Also dropped is the notion that the survivors have to use breathing apparatus.  I guess they got tired of sucking on tubes.  These simply disappear.They aren't the only ones that suck.  Marvelously sucky are the stabs at Portentous Dialogue.  Seeing Vin Diesel debate (or somnabulate) theology with the Muslim guy is truly amusing.  (But don't eat your lunch first.)What redeems this whole mess is the fact that YOU DON'T CARE A DAMN ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. When they die, or when they escape, you don't care.A silly comedy.

1098598,"There's nothing I love more than a zombie (zombi) film. Whether it is the needed social-commentary of a work like Halperin'sWhite Zombie(1932), the thought-provoking existentialism of Soavi'sCemetery Man(1994), or the playful relateability of Pegg/Wright'sShaun of the Dead(2004), I enjoy it all. In fact, I (like Danny Boyle, mind you) insist that28 Days Later)(2002) IS a zombie film, JUST so I can show it in my horror-film classes! Equally as revealing, I (INDEED!) went to every ""Resident Evil"" film on OPENING-NIGHT just to show my support for the undead. Bottomline: I'm not a zombie-snob. So, take my words to heart ... this film is shockingly sub-par.This work had everything in its favor! Foremost, it has top-notch actors like Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix,Memento, andChocolat), Dylan Baker (Requiem for a Dream,Spider-Man 2, andKinsey), and Billy Connolly (""Boondock Saints,"" ""White Oleander,"" and countless television shows). Most horror-film directors are not that luckily. And, understand, these actors ""brought their 'A' game."" Their devotion to their roles is painfully clear ... and that only contributes to the uncomfortablenesses of the work (one begins to feel embarrassed for these committed actors). Secondly, Currie had a sizable budget: eight-million! (and has thus far only grossed about $300,000 since June). Pegg and Wright had EXACTLY half that budget for their zed-word ""comedy"" and quadrupled it as of November 2004. In essence, Currie had the gift of gorgeous sets, fantastic film-stock, luxurious props (like the cars!) ... amenities only this type of budget could permit. And for all its ""beauty"" ... for all its effort ... it fails ... epically.Undoubtedly, its fatal-flaw resides in its soundtrack. The ""light-instrumentals"" (practically lifted from 1950's sitcoms) undermines the film at every turn. It is not ironic ... it is not ""kitchy"" ... it is not creating an ""atmosphere"" ... it nearly, single-handedly destroys the film. Its literalness is exhausting. Moreover, watching the film is like trudging through molasses: it is excruciatingly slow and unrewarding (or, at least, I imagine this is what ""trudging through molasses"" might be like). Envision a rewrite of ""Lassie"" ... now replace Lassie with a ""pet-zombie."" The end. The first nod toward Beaudine Jr.'s work was amusing ... but the joke wears thin FAST! ""Is it Timmy? Is he in trouble? Show me boy!"" Et al. Uggggg.One point of frustration is Tim Blake Nelson's character of Mr. Theopolis. His contribution was the ONLY redeemable aspect of this entire film. It is a genuine shame that the director failed to focus on Nelson's demented-yet-likable character. To relegate such a respected actor (one beloved by the Coen Brothers) to a ""bit-part"" is a pity. The real film was with him and his zombie girlfriend (think of what could have been!) ... how did no one realize that?!Many viewers will be dazzled by the ""pretty colors,"" the wonderful sets, and the familiar actors ... most will find it completely transparent. Many will think they are ""supposed to like it"" ... most will realize it is reasonable NOT to like it. There is nothing innovative here ... nothing that hasn't been addressed elsewhere. I assure you, this is not the next zombie-classic ... in fact, I will be shocked if the film is in-print a year from now.Peter Travers of ""Rolling Stone"" magazine says it best: ""Director Andrew Currie is better at laughs than scares, but he can't sustain either as Fido runs out of steam in the final stretch."" And the other critics (who are remarkably amenable to horror in general) agree (like Richard Roeper).Need a final word?

877253,"Poorly done - mostly fiction with no fact!  Good for entertainment but not for science.  I was totally disappointed and believe now that the intent of the DVD was to do a hatchet job on the bible - and done poorly.  The DVD starts out like it is going to trace the biblical Exodus to Egypt's Pharaohs and tell what really happened to the Pharaoh's first-born son - was he killed by God's wrath or by man's wrath.  The DVD reminded me of a Laurel and Hardy movie - sending Egyptologist Weeks and journelist Sennet around Egypt in a comedy fashion. It starts out with finding a skull, believed to be Rameses' son and half-way through the DVD they find out that this skull is not the skull they were looking for and so they tossed it and took another skull from the tomb (four total in one mass grave - which is kind of strange for Pharaoh's sons) and reconstructed this skull to look like what they think Rameses's first born looked like without any evidence that it is THE one.  Rameses is alleged to have over 100 children. Overall, the producers of this DVD didn't know where the Red Sea geograhical crossing took place, where the mountain of God was located or where the burning bush was located or at what date this all took place, or under which Pharaoh, etc - all of which I believe now to be wrong in their hypothesis.  Since their hypothesis didn't agree with the bible, it didn't dawn on the people putting this expose together that they might be looking in the wrong places, time, Pharaohs, etc; so ... they changed the bible text! Is this what schools are teaching for science today?  I recently ordered and reviewed the DVD Exodus Revealed and the book Exodus Case by Dr. Moller, both which are outstanding and CREDIBLE and based on science.  In these two items - they do reveal where the crossing took place and where the Mountain of God (Mt. Sinai) is, as well as finding evidence of Pharaoh's chariots on the bottom of the Red Sea. I recommend these two as a must see if one is interested in the Exodus Red Sea crossing and would wait to see the Rameses DVD on Discovery, Nat'l Geographic and other PBS channel types.",Rameses - Wrath of God or Man?

That is quite an accomplishment.This mess starts off with the long, boring story detailing the origin of the villain of this film; the short guy with the dirty beard who runs around with a knife. He is supposed to be some evil, immortal pirate who kills anybody who:a. is in his field of vision, especially if you are wearing a skimpy bikini (I've never really found hoochies cut up and covered in their own blood attractive - obviously the director has this fetish)b. tries to steal his treasure (all pirates have treasures to guard - Arrrgh!)c. tries to prevent him from recovering his treasure (he lost it when he was imprisoned many years ago, before he became immortal. Arrrgh!)The victims are a group of idiots who are participating in a ""Survivor""-type show. They all decide to frolic on this short killer's island.What really shocked me about this poorly filmed, cheap D-grade movie was the incredibly racist portrayal of one of the pirate's victims - a rap star of course.

The audiences hated it. And they didnt care about being hip.If on the other hand, and here's the worst part, Jim Jarmusch actually completed this film thinking he made a hip, funny, ""alternative"" and kinda weird movie revolving around people just sipping coffee and puffing away on cigarettes, well he failed again. And gave a bad name to smoking and coffee drinking on top of it.Then again maybe he was experimenting (for all i know) by letting people do the coffee thingie without any script and simply allowing them to improvise and say whatever lines crossed their skulls.

280603,"Super star Gary Cooper was one year shy of the half-century mark when he lobbied, and to the horror of many, was awarded one of the most coveted male roles in movie history: Howard Roark. As described in Ayn Rand's still exhilirating masterpiece, The Fountainhead, Roark was a l9/20-year-old brilliant social rebel who battled society to live the way he wanted to and to build buildings the way he designed them. He was a dynamic, feisty, fearless rebel who moved and talked like the genius he was.The book starts off with Roark being kicked out of college because he refused to compromise his dreams of becoming not a good architect, but a great one.When Warner Brothers announced it had brought the movie rights to Ayn Rand's landmark novel, many in the film colony saw the Howard Roark part as a shoo-in for rebel-in-residence John Garfield. Charismatic, intense, gorgeous, a brillant artist, he had already created a niche in movies with his bad boy, smart, edgy roles,like the one in the Joan Crawford hit, ""Humoresque"" where he proved unforgettable as the troubled, snarling master violinist, Paul Boray.Cooper's image in private and on screen was that of a laconic, good-natured boy-next-door who might have parked his horse outside. Very rarely did he move or talk fast and his style was slow-moving and sleepy. In his role of Howard Roark he looks like the grandfather of the young rebel. Probably one of the most excruitiating scenes on film is Roark's big courtroom speech. Cooper resembles an old man, or an ageing cowpoke,whose wandered onto the wrong set, reading text off a teleprompter and at times his eyes bug out at some of the really high tone philosophy that author Ayn Rand wrote.Cooper was later to say that he understood nothing aboutt the script or his role.  Director King Vidor was later to write that he was appalled by the casting because equally badly cast was Patricia Neal in the juicy role of Roark's love interest--icy, brilliant, surreal Dominique Francon. Neal was a pretty, fresh-faced ingenue who photographed well.Again, many in the film colony thought Ida Lupino was the perfect actress for the role. She was considered the ""poor man's Bette Davis"" and had turned in extraordinary performances in ""They Drive By Night"" and ""The Hard Way."" Rand said she wrote the Dominique Francon character and later the Dagney Taggart personae in ""Atlas Shrugged"" with Greta Garbo in mind. But Garbo had already quit movies. Barbara Stanwyck was so obsessed with starring in The Fountainhead that she gave studio mogul, Jack Warner a copy of the book with a note saying she ""was born"" to play Dominique Francon.Cooper can't be entirely faulted for his fatal miscasting. Ayn Rand actually pushed for him to be cast. This was an era when the tiny circle of super stars truly believed their own immortality. Stars like Cooper were brainwashed to think ""their fans"" would love them in any role. Because the Howard Roark role was considered ""hot,"" every male star lobbied for it. Cooper probably was elated and thrilled to have snatched this prize from under the noses of his cohorts. Unfortunately, his hideous mistake and all of those who supported his casting will live forever on DVD and Turner Classic Movies.",The Fountainhead VHS

I have six young sons, and nothing gives me greater pleasure than to get cozy on my huge sofa with my popcorn and coca-cola, after everybody's is tucked in for the night, and enjoy some quiet time with a great dvd. Sadly, this movie was a bitter disappointment. I think Susan Sarandon is a wonderful actress, and Goldie Hawn has had her moments (Overboard). Without going into the details of the film, I will try to concentrate my review on the elements of the film. When I excitedly hit the play button, which I was sure would open the door to a whole new soon-to-be favorite film, I was smiling and kept smiling hoping that each line would bring something to smile about. I soon discovered my face hurt from trying to hold my once geniune smile turned phony. I finally had to tell myself that the movie wasn't funny or touching or even well-acted. Goldie's Suzette possessed not one solitary trait that was even remotely endearing. Watching Geoffrey Rush's character, Harry, become ""touched"" while Suzette allowed Vinnie's (Susan Sarandon) daughter to puke all over her while she soothed her through her bad acid trip, was just plain silly. I felt myself feeling embarrassed for the actors. If Goldie Hawn didn't go home from shooting this film every night with a pounding headache or throwing her back out, I would be very surprised. There is no way that anyone could keep their lips pursed like that without some repercussion. And voguing one's boobs sideways, backways, and every way to Sunday can't be good on one's back.  There was no ""feel good"" message, ""no moral"" to this waste of film. Those who have given ""The Banger Sisters"" a glowing review are clearly people who are ""low maintenance"" as far as movies go. They are not dazzled by gripping performances or an intelligent script. Two qualities I always look for. I guess if I am going to devote my valuable free time to watching a movie, it will have to be one worth watching and not this kind of slop. Hey, these people get paid millions of dollars to entertain. Shouldn't they have to earn it?  I could go on and on and on about all that is wrong with this movie, but I won't.

248340,"Without question the worst movie I've ever seen, and not even in a ""so bad it's good"" kind of way. It's ninety minutes of sheer torture, starring a hideous cast of makeup nightmares; indisputable evidence of the lengths a commercial property can stretch for the almighty dollar. Like most children of the eighties, I had a healthy collection of GPK stickers in my closet growing up. The gross-out humor and macabre illustrations were a big selling point, but beneath all that was a creative core and a wild amount of versatility. Every card was completely different. The one-note comedy of their film translation, though, is like opening a pack filled with duplicates. I counted six jokes with a visual punchline of ""and then he peed his pants."" That's not an exaggeration, and it's not the only example of the flick's careless comedic redundancy. Combine that with an appalling song and dance number (seriously), a horribly out-of-place romantic subplot (starring a pre-pubescent boy and a girl well into her twenties, no less) and a gang of foils cut clumsily from recycled cardboard. It's genuinely amazing this ever saw the light of day.",N/A

122454,"Some people may be led astray by the multitude of glowing reviews of this movie on amazon and nearly every other review medium ever. It enjoys classic status for some reason that I cannot fathom, because I am of the opinion that this movie might be the worst horror movie I have ever seen. The movie begins with a woman and her husband moving into a new apartment in the swanky (but purportedly cursed) part of town. They are immediately welcomed by their neighbors who happen to be the sweetest little geriatric satanists you ever did see, and begin having dinner with them every night. During one of their dinners, Rosemary is drugged by her husband and the satanists and raped by her husband while she dreams of having sex with JFK and the devil (who looks kind of like a sasquatch) intermittently. But don't get your hopes up, because the movie doesn't get any scarier or intellectually involving from there. It drags along for something around two hours while Rosemary debates over drinking daily concoctions provided for her by the satanists (hmmm... tough call), wearing the charm they've given her (which at this point, she's discovered to be evil, but it somehow remains a tough decision about what to do with it other than wear it and be afflicted by its curse), and just plain moping around while she carries the devil's sasquatch baby.The movie picks up for a brief 30 seconds when Rosemary finds out that her closet opens a secret passage into the Satanists' lair, where the whole crew of octogenarian devil-worshipers halfheartedly mumble ""hail satan"" and Rosemary gets to see her baby... a quick 2 second shot of the eyes of what is obviously an adult wearing red contacts and fur.Does this sound like the kind of movie for you? If so, you might want to get your head checked.",N/A

Tom Cruise is surprisingly funny and Matthew McConaughey is good.But the movie is just stupid.

For starters, the idea of exercising with a video is to give you the feeling of being in an exercise class.  But Maggie Rhoades video created the feeling of distance with her voice over technique as she is performing the exercise routine.  Also, her voice and the routine are a little out of sync in places.  It also drives me crazy how she keeps switching sides during the leg exercises instead of completing the series on one side.  She has zero useful form cues.  I guess thats the difference between someone who is an expert in a particular form of exercise and someone who has superficial knowledge, apparently enough to produce an exercise video.  As an example, she doesn't have any instructions for finding your balance or setting up for relatively challenging exercises such as rolling like a ball with the legs outstreched.  And this is supposed to be a beginning video. With many better pilates videos in the market, why invest in this one?",N/A

Noomi knows when to be expressionless and when to express a little.  And the bad guys in the original, you couldn't help but really despise them.

Stick your index finger on the edge of the disc of your choice. Realize nothing will happen if you try to remove it this way. Then stick your finger under the edge of the disc, be sure get a good smear on the data side.2. Now lift the disc away from the backing.

1184618,"Honestly, I don't understand all the 5-Star reviews for ""Swingtown,"" because I found it poorly made on almost every level.  And if you're looking for anything even remotely close to the quality of ""Madmen,"" sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this show is at Titanic level depths beneath the quality of ""Madmen.""  First problem, the writing of Swingtown was terrible.  Evidently none of the writers grew up in the 70s, because there was virtually zero attempt to make the characters speak like they're actually in the 70s.  The 70s were exploding with words, phrases and slang unique to the 70s but you'll find hardly any ""70s-speak"" on this show.  What's worse, the writers use words in ways they were not used back in the 70s, such as the dismissive form of ""whatever"" and the buddy/pal form of ""dude.""  Those uses of ""whatever"" and ""dude"" didn't start until the mid 80s.  So sloppy lazy writing that fails to immerse you in the time period.  Set design is also weak, with far too many sets and locales looking too ""stage-y"" and fake.  And if you look closely in some scenes in which characters are driving around in a car, you can see 2000-era sports cars and SUVs driving past in the background.  I mean that's so bad that it's like Ed Woods levels of incompetance.  Stories?  Forgettable.  Acting?  Forgettable.  Editing?  Forgettable.  Music/Soundtrack?  So-so.  I mean I love good TV shows set in by-gone eras, but if you're going to make a show set in the 70s you better make it FEEL like the 70s.

985720,"I saw this movie in the theatre and thought it was pretty bad, save for the toilet using cat (hey, that's as lowbrow as it gets, but try not to laugh).  The ""Hitch"" thing was funny initially and I also enjoyed the absurdity of the ""Kill Bill"" spoof and Paris Hilton's burger commercial.  Those three or four moments earn this flick its one star; everything else is either predictable and unfunny (or predictably unfunny) or far worse.  The theatre was mostly silent during the whole affair (I counted two couples who walked out).  I was often the only one who could be heard laughing and I'm saying I thought the movie sucked (I guess I got more of the movie references than the rest of the people there, that's not to say they were actually all that funny, but I had to find something to laugh at).  It seemed to get worse, less funny, run out of ideas and get more random and tedious as it went along.  The last 15 to 20 minutes is a dreadful hodgepodge of random, lame ideas; and, while the movie is rather short, I was squirming and checking my watch about halfway through.Maybe this would play better at home and with lowered expectations (not that mine were all that high; these movie-spoofs have been pretty week the last few years).  My theory is these are now being made for a less discriminating and younger audience.  As with the new ""Scary Movie,"" er, movie, all the ""this is the funniest movie I've ever seen"" reviews here at Amazon are coming from a bunch of kids.  Now, I'm not that old myself, but the generation gap between generations X and Y is truly bigger than I ever imagined.  If you're between 10 and 17 this might be for you.  Those of us around long enough to see and appreciate truly great spoof movies will think this film verges on sacrilege.  Leslie Nielson and the Zuckers would be rolling over in their graves, had they died 5 years ago.Normally I would never say I would consider watching such a lousy movie again, but as always happens I am intrigued when the ""Unrated Version"" is released.  Usually DVDs that slap ""Unrated"" across the box actually include very few actual ""unrated""-worthy scenes.  Unless a movie as already rather raunchy, that ""Unrated"" is just used as a marketing tool and you never can tell what is really different about the new version.  ""Date Movie"" has a fare amount of lite-raunch, so the potential is there that some heavier stuff was left on the cutting room floor.  Until I see a few reviews saying this is indeed the case I'm not gonna risk it.  You may at your own risk, then let me know.  C'mon guys, lets see some reviews that compare the two.Till then, rent this version at your own risk.",N/A

Thank god for the quick turn-around of Netflix or I would've been mad about paying to see this instead of just highly disappointed. I can't speak for the rest of the cast, but I know Amber Benson is capable of much better than this.

But surely even a fourth-rate cardboard character deserves more than this: being turned into a vehicle for Val Kilmer's apparently limitless self-indulgence. The film is actually a Kilmer anthology - donning about a dozen so-called disguises, he never gets around to acting the part of Templar, but he does run through all the trademark Val characters (smoldering lounge lizard, buck-toothed comic, stoic tough guy). We're supposed to care because he doesn't know how to be HIMSELF, but in fact we're grateful for small favors.

The battle ground is managed remotely through technology by game planners in order to direct the game in interesting ways for the adult audience.

The message that war is an innate trait in humans and in order to avoid wars in the natural world, the innate need can be fulfilled through entertainment is nonsense.  The twist of denying the audience of their need through mutually assured destruction (M.A.D.) is utterly looney. The fact, that an inexperienced kid comes up with this novel solution is beyond fantasy and that adults twist it again into M.A.D. for love is even more nutty.

When I heard there was a movie coming out based on the play, I was really excited. However, when I was watching it, I thought, ""What have they done?!"" The first thing to point out is that every one is a terrible singer. Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson are too weak and they're the romantic leads. Gerard Butler (he was great in 300 but...) has no business playing the Phantom. I understand that he was trying to add a new rock-style to the role and I appreciate that but for the Phantom it just doesn't work. He basically screams the notes instead of singing them and when he doesn't scream he just swallows the notes so it sounds artificial and not beautiful. Second, the lip-syncing was beyond saving. During ""Think of Me"" Christine sings kinda pretty but her lips are barely moving and just stands there like a lifeless mannequin. Gerard Butler just over enunciates everything so it looks pretty ridiculous. Third, the direction by Joel Schumacher (the guy behind the atrocious Batman & Robin) is lazy. He's so concerned with the fabulous art direction and cinematography that he forgets about the story and characters. The whole movie is just so dull that the sense of excitement and romance in the play are lost in the transition to the silver screen.

After watching two disappointing films, the third just makes me want to dig a hole in the back yard and curl up into a fetal position.

1466431,"I'm one of those rare people that's involved in ministry that will subject themselves to watching these kinds if movies, when you study the bible and get into the theology behind demonic possession you learn a lot that Hollywood gets wrong about demonic possession. To get possessed by a demon there are two ways for this to happen, first you have to open yourself up to the demon through witchcraft, satanism, sorcery, new age spiritualism ect, if your doing that your obviously not a Christian and you will become possessed but to engage in black magik the only way to move in the supernatural is to be in communion with it. Now one other way is through the bloodline there is bible scripture to back this up, don't have the verse off hand but if you reply back and want it, I can provide it later, do if your ancestors or parents or grandparents and do on, we're involved in the activities listed above and never because a christian afterwards and never broke the curse or bondage to the demons they had been in communion with, that demon has legal right to possess the desensdents through the bloodline, look at paranormal activity 3 (spoiler Alert for PA3 if you havent watched that movie please dont read)there was a lot of truth in that movie about a demon been passed down through the family because the mother was a witch that ""thought"" she had control of the demon when she was only a puppet. That's why the demon kept falling the family. The Last Exorcism had a lot of truth to it as well because it was a satanic cult involved and the ending was not the greatest but it was more believable the. This movie The Devil Inside, u actually liked the movie until the 3rd act and I hated the Idea of the demon passing from person to person as a contagious disease, that is a stupid idea and is not an accurate look at possession, if that were to be the case we would all be possessed, I don't like from any of these movies how the powers of darkness are stronger than God in these movies, rubbish I have encountered demons before and they have no authority over me and I'm not scared of them, I have also encountered possessed people before and the only way for them to be free from that possession is through salvation through Jesus Christ and months of counseling and prayer for delivering the demons from them, not ""exorcising"" them. In the book ""he came to set the captives free"" I think that's the right title a lady was a head of the largest witch coven in Europe and she became a Christian, it took several months of prayer and fasting with a minister that does counseling to be delivered of several hundred demons, this sometimes can take a long time.

896131,"I thought this movie was going to be good, but I don't see what was scary about it at all. It started out looking like it could be scary, but then it ended up being ridiculous. It didn't seem very believable to me that an adult man would still be afraid of the same things as when he was a child. The movie was very boring to me. There were too many scenes where nothing significant was happening. I only finished watching it because I thought it would be worth it to finally see the boogeyman later on in the movie, but I was even more diappointed when I saw it. The monster's CGI was too terrible for it to even be scary. The ending also wasn't very good and left too many unanswered questions.

1294210,"If this was the movie James Cameron has wanted to do since he was a teen, then maybe he should have taken better notes, or should have taken a very sharp editor's eye to his script.Because while this film is indeed pretty and a spellbinding achievement in the most stunningly realistic CG of any movie today, the plot is almost insulting in how stale, cliche'd, and just plain boring, ordinary, and generic it is.  There's no surprises to be had; you know exactly who's going to win and who's going to lose, you know exactly how different action (not just fight) sequences will turn out, you know exactly what characters will live and which will die, which ones will have an abrupt Heel-Face turn, and which ones will turn out to be good all along.I can't really tell just why such a film like this comes out so cheesey and cliche' in terms of its plot, whereas a film like Star Wars, in its trilogy, contains a great many classical and common elements of folk tale and mythology and literature, and yet manages to be a stellar and timeless story.This story in ""Avatar"" is anything but.  The only thing that will be memorable of this movie is its visual effects.Right from the start, the film does wonders with visual effects, showing us a highly realistic-looking sleeper ship, and a zero-g environment on board, that neither looks overly cartoony or overly CG'd.  It looks perfectly real all around.Every effect just screams ""real real real!"", from the computer monitors and holographic displays, to the plants and vegetation and variety of animals.  Cameron does not overindulge us by making us look at everything in detail, showing off, but neither does he rush through intricate details in an attempt to stay grounded to the script.  It's a perfect mix of showing us nifty new creatures and inventions without stalling long enough to make us think he's showing off.The Na'vi start off looking quite real, but very blatantly CG.  There's a very slight sense of artificiality in the Avatars when they are first on screen, and shown awakening and interacting with humans.  But as the movie progresses, the effects seem to get better and better, to a point where towards the end, when Na'vi and Humans interact closely, both of them look incredibly REAL, as though the Na'vi were a huge puppet creation, and yet it's entirely CG.Where they went all-out with the visuals, they completely lost it with the story.  It becomes less ""Avatar"" and more ""Dances With Wolves In Space"" or virtually any Generic Action/Adventure Film In Space.  The parallels with Dances With Wolves are the most powerful, likely due to the commonplace aspect of it.But the story doesn't treat this as some sort of surprise.  Nor does it even try to be distinct in some way.  You know exactly how characters are going to react to situations.  You know exactly what's going to happen next.  You know that the Generic Nerd Sidekick appears jealous and resentful of Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) now, but you know later on he's going to become the HERO who tries to save him.  You know that Sully is going to be initially hated by Action Girl Love Interest (Zoe Saldana), but eventually get her to love him, You know that Bad Ass Action Girl (Michelle Rodriguez) is going to betray the humans and side with Sully and the Na'vi.  You know that certain characters are going to die.  You know that Sully will earn the trust and respect of the tribe.  You know that Sully is going to admit he's been spying on the Na'vi, and cause Action Girl Love Interest to cry and scream and hate him and tell him to go away, You know this and that and everything.It's all so obvious that it becomes stupefyingly boring, and you wouldn't have ever noticed that fact if the movie weren't so much fun to look at.But while the effects and even much of the story was interesting enough to keep me drawn in, the most spectacular visual effect focus was on the Na'vi themselves...  and the Na'vi themselves, as a society, were a breakneck yank out of immersion, and into a silly and childish realization:""They are exact alien copies of Native Americans!""They are exact copies, from the mohawks, to the way the Elder Father and Mother characters look and dress and sound, to the high pitched yipping sound they give in battle, they are EXACT COPIES of Native Americans.It would seem to me that this element was lazily left in from the ripping off of the plot of ""Dances With Wolves"", and that would probably be a great discussion point, but like a great many modern ""PC"" portrayals of Native Americans, they sugarcoat them so much, they become just as racist as the Savage Red Man (Blue Man?) portrayed in older stories.These Na'vi Americans are so in touch with their environment, they can talk to animals by sticking tentacles in their hair into plugs coming out of the animals' heads.They can wrap these tentacles around long tendrils from the ""Tree of Souls"" to pray directly to their God.  They have to cry and chant a ritual chant every time they kill an animal.  They use bow and arrows, ride on animals, and make yipping sounds like the Natives in old ""cowboy and indian"" movies and storypieces.It wouldn't be so bad, and it never really ventures into a racist depiction (especially since most of all these are ALIENS and not Native Americans), but the parallels are too strong to ignore---this is not even a metaphor or parody or Horatian satire, these Na'vi are nearly word-for-word copies of stereotypical Native Americans, with a little bit from everywhere, such as the Caribbean-sounding Elder Mother, to the ""Great Chief Man Sitting Bull"" sounding Elder Father, to the Warrior Son with the mohawk and pithy attitude to Sully.But since these AREN'T Native Americans and they ARE aliens, James Cameron can get away with essentially portraying them as the stereotype of the ""in perfect harmony and touch with mother nature"" good guys, whereas the Humans, with the exception of only the obvious ones and the Nerdy Pacifist Scientists, are all evil, greedy, corporate-thinking scum who can't do anything with a planet except rape it and kill it slowly for resources, as though environmentalism efforts today would never ever work out or catch on.  THANKS FOR THE FAITH, CAMERON!While the story is essentially glossed over with a spiffy coat of paint to seem new-ish, there's no real need to worry about spoilers---there's nothing here we haven't seen before, and nothing here that wasn't told better and more realistically in other movies and stories.It's a stereotypical ""White Men vs Indians"" tale of the 90s, with the evil Humans being thwarted by the holy Na'vi.And yet we get the Unfortunate Implication that the Na'vi apparently could not have survived or banded together without the leadership of Jake Sully, White Man Sky Person.THANKS FOR THE SUBTLE RACISM, JAMES CAMERON!",N/A

This film may have been a hit upon release, but it is neither Crawford's nor Gable's finest hour by any stretch of the imagination.

In an odd number, pretty much the finale, it's Joan and Fred Astaire (FRED ASTAIRE!!!!!) in his film debut pounding the dust out of the carpet as some impossible stage brings them everywhere but earth, even whirling around the sky.  Odd.  It's the oddest musical moment in Crawford's career until the dastardaly ""Two Faced Woman"" number 20 years later.  The bitch can't dance.  Astaire can, and he high-tailed it over to RKO after this mess to team up with Ginger Rogers.And history is made.  Was made.  Will be made.Also in the cast is Franchot Tone, he of the big schwang (supposedly) and the love of Crawford's then life.  Before the kids and all.

449804,"Gone with the Wind (Victor Fleming, 1939)I have hated Gone with the Wind for decades based on little snatches of it that I've seen here and there over a long period of time. I thought that, perhaps, I might be giving it short shrift, so a few nights ago, I sat down to watch the entire four-hour extravaganza from beginning to end. It somehow doesn't surprise me that I now hate the film in an entirely new, more passionate, more comprehensive way than I did previously.My main bone of contention is not that the film is far, far too long for the skimpy subject matter it explores-- an hour and a half running time might have helped immensely-- but that Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, in the final ninety minutes of the film, break the cardinal rule-- they manage to screw everything up by simply not talking. These are incredibly stupid, shallow people. Why have generations wasted four hours on this twaddle? And why do some do it every year? I've heard many people refer to it as a great romance; maybe this is a good portion of what's wrong with America today. If this is your idea of a great romance, folks, then perhaps you need to go back to the well and think a little more about what constitutes a great romance. I'm pretty sure that philandering, jealousy, all the character depth of a piece of onionskin, and a decided lack of intelligence should not be contributing factors.While the visual spectacle of the thing is inarguable, everything else about it-- the pace, the characterization, the script, all of it-- are just plain awful.

It's not.While the prior Zorro movie was smart, charming, blessed with believable action, and above all, HUMAN, the universe of this Zorro movie seems to be in an alternate dimension where people rarely bleed, the laws of physics need not apply, and people make personal choices that no one can understand or relate to.  The only characterization I can conceive is a confused collage of Zorro, Batman, and the ""Wild Wild West"".I really do like action movies, and am in no way a ""movie snob"", but this is one of the very few movies that my wife and I very nearly walked out of - it was that bad.  Afterward my wife grudgingly admitted that had we followed my suggestion, and gone to see the banal ""DOOM"", that we'd have probably had a better movie going experience that day.",N/A
100211,"It's always a disappointment when a movie with fantastic stars turns out to be a waste of your time.  This is one such movie.  It's about three love-lost women (Cher, Pfeiffer and Sarandon) who, bored with small town life, shack up with The Devil (Nicholson) who offers them a world of sex, magic and enjoyment.  However, things soon begin to start spiralling out of control, and by that I mean the movie as well as the three girls' situation.It's not that the acting is bad.  Far from it, each member of the cast is perfect, especially Sarandon in an unusually sexy role.  The problem is that the movie can't balance its menacing elements with its funnier ones.  Much of this problem lies with Nicholson, who constantly is forced to move from scary to fun-loving.  Whilst the four leads are floating above a swimming pool or playing a magical game of tennis it skips along quite nicely.  However, this is all blown away with a ridiculously over-the-top finale which seems to waste all the movie's money on some very silly special effects.Still, Susan Sarandon in a funny role is a treat to behold.",N/A

544172,"There are many questions us mere mortals have. The first is ""Is there is God?"". The second is ""Why I am here?"". The third is ""Just what has gone wrong with John Carpenter?""Please tell me that the people who gave this film anything more than two stars are kidding right? Have you ever seen another John Carpenter movie? What is wrong with you people? This is NOT return to form. This is NOT even a good film. The acting is abysmal and if anything John Carpenter has got worse - No! Strike that - he is now the #1 nose-diving director in the history of cinema. In the 1970s, 1980 and even early 1990s Carpenter ruled. Even his mediocre films where better than average and worthy of repeat viewings and certainly DVD ownership. Then came - Village of the Damned (1995), Escape from L.A. (1996), Vampires (1998)... and now Ghosts of Mars (2001)... BOMB, BOMB, BOMB and now the ultimate John Carpenter TRAINWRECK has arrived. Not only is this film devoid of suspense or a coherent storyline but it is also Carpenter's most stupid work to date. The man is not only in quicksand but he IS quicksand, taking down everything he touches with him. Natasha Henstridge has her lamest role to date as she plays an intergalactic cop who is hooked on some LSD drug that actually plays a vital plot twist in saving her from becoming infected. WHAT??? Ice Cube plays a con turned good guy who is there to do what these ex-rappers are stereotypically doing in all these movies... playing to the audience that come to see their one-liners and machismos. Jason Statham, fresh from the movie ""Snatch"", takes on a career low point as a cop in the background running around looking paranoid and angry. The poor Pam Grier had to suffer through this one for only a few minutes but even when she is on the screen boy does it seem like Jackie Brown is something of an acting miracle for her. Worst of all is Clea DuVall. You will be shocked to see her scene in what has to be the worst bit of action acting in the history of cinema as she stands on a sand dune trying to shoot the monsters. I nearly fell clean out of my chair just seeing her arms going back and forth in the most pathetic attempt at a performance you will ever see - ""Help me Mr. Carpenter! Just what is it that I am supposed to be doing here again????"". Reply - ""Shut up and keep dancing up and down as if you are firing those guns at something."" She isn't even looking at what she is shooting. She isn't even paying attention to what her arms are doing. It is like she is having a fit on film. Maybe that scene alone is worth watching this movie for.The plot.. oh good heavens... is about a prison on Mars that has just become host to some sort of a ""ghost"" defence system that turns people into quasi-zombie-neanderthal maniacs that hunt down whoever they see. The leader of that group looks quite nasty but this is pitifully - No, Strike that... pathetically mishandled in the worst way that your mind can possibly conceive. Nothing will prepare you for how OUTRAGOUSLY BAD this movie actually is. Carpenter should be put on ""suicide watch"" after making this one.",N/A

1112540,"The Good: Not much.  The one small glimmer of light in this otherwise black hole of a movie is Michael Cera (Evan).  The guy's just likable in a sweet, dorky way.  While there are some chuckles in the film, they are far overshadowed by the absolute cringe-worthy language and the absolute annoyance of Jonah Hill.The Bad: Where to start?  A young boy obsessed with drawing male genitalia ... what does that have to do with ANYTHING?  I think it was supposed to be funny but it wasn't.  And it was kind of like one of those trademark Family Guy moments where they intentionally overdue something inane ... except I don't think it was intentional here.  The language in this movie is abominable.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a total prude but the f-bomb is used in this movie like I use the article ""the.""  It's beyond gratuitous.  About fifteen to twenty minutes into the movie we considered turning it off but we stuck through to the end, just waiting to see if it ever ""picked up.""  It didn't.The Summary:  So what exactly is the point of this movie?  Well in a nutshell, it's one of those coming of age movies disguised as a gross-out movie, stealthily hiding a warm and fuzzy friendship tale.  As with most movies of this type, the two main teenage characters, Seth and Evan, are desperately trying to get laid.  In pursuit of this, they must bring alcohol to a party they've managed to get invited to despite their obvious dorkiness.  Helping them in this endeavor is dorkiest buddy Fogell, who is the only one with a fake ID ... one that dubs him McLovin.  Okay, now that actually IS funny.  The rest ... not so much.  Hijinks ensue, but again, mostly a snoozer with excessively excessive foul language.  There are drug scenes, some nudity, yada yada ... stuff that seems to be written by a teenage boy for teenage boys.  How Judd Apatow has managed to become so successful is simply a mystery to me.  Having now seen three Apatow movies, I think I've finally learned my lesson.  The mere sight of Jonah Hill or Seth Rogen tells me BAD MOVIE.",N/A

The prison guards and the leering soldiers were also good. However the background music was poor and the acting was grotesque. Salome's dance was mostly grotesque body movements.By comparison the production by Gotz Friedrich was everything that this isn't.

I could forgive its lack of plot, its lifeless acting, its stilted dialogue, and the utter lack of chemistry between Pablo and Sally - but I simply could not forgive the awful dancing. Face it, Potter is a zombie on the dance floor. She has no energy, no spark, no fluidity. Veron had enough verve for the two of them (and it was obvious that the movie was a vehicle for Veron to show off), but that does not compensate for his completely unconvincing dance partner. Why would anyone doing performance tango (which, by the way, absolutely cannot be learned after a lesson in ""walking"" and a trip to Buenos Aires) choose a marionette for a partner? It made no sense. (Well, alright, nothing really made sense in this film.) The one good scene in this film was when Potter goes to Buenos Aires and gets on the floor with a portly older gentleman.

100236,"Utterly unwatchable nonsense.This is a film that looks like it was put together in the Bizzaro world, like a split-level home built from clapboard, milk cartons and used furniture crates. Nicholson reprises his role in ""The Shining"" by portraying himself as a basket case, a routine he uses in about 99% of his roles.""The Witches of Eastwick"" is based on the book by John Updike, but whatever Updike originally wanted to say about the differences between the sexes is upstaged by the hammy Nicholson, who should have been relegated to being the caterer for the shooting location.It's also difficult to believe that the talented Cher, the same person who made ""Moonstruck"" such a great film, would have had anything to do with this mess.""The Witches of Eastwick"" bombed at the box office after word of mouth killed it. It's not a film that will be dredged up from time to time because it was once popular; it wasn't. However, it is a film that will probably appeal to worshipers of Cher or Nicholson, or some obscure Hollywood mutual admiration society.At this point, a used VHS edition of ""The Witches of Eastwick"" is selling for about $1.00 on amazon, but even that's too much to pay for this dog.",N/A

612766,"I remember when this was released.  It was around the time that Nicholson was still considered an acting god and Sandler was still considered funny.  Things have changed and both of their careers are less than admirable at this point (Nicholson is still a god, but one that coasts on a clich&eacute;, but Sandler is a mess) and this particular film rests as the beginning of the end for both of them.  I mean, this came one year after Nicholson's last great role (`About Schmidt') and right before Sandler had a string of ridiculous lows.`Anger Management' could have been funny, and I'm sure that on paper it looked like it would be a giant success, but the film fails to ever live up to any potential.  Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler yelling at one another for two hours just isn't as funny as you'd think it would be, and the endless barrage of failed jokes make this a burden to watch.  It grows tiresome and winds up draining the spirit out of the audience.  The cameos fail to make any impact (save for Reilly and Graham, to a degree).  At the end of the day this is just another one of Sandler's ill-advised film choices.The worst thing about `Anger Management' is that it is trying to have a good time but in the process it just gets everything wrong.  That seems to be Sandler's issue.  He has too much fun ruining everyone else's good time.  His humor has faded and he no longer understands how to carry a film, and Nicholson is just content in his old age to play a caricature of his own perceived persona.  There is nothing new anymore, and this is quite frankly the worst portrayal of Jack Nicholson that Nicholson has given us to date.",Anger Management

But I suspect this doesn't really matter, because even when he does stop mumbling he never says much of any interest anyway.Then there's a bad guy, and he's a patricidal creep of the first water who, amongst other things, has the good guy's family killed - so you can't wait for him to get what's coming to him.

'Mansfield Park' may be the most difficult of Austen's novels to adapt, but Rozema did not adapt it so much as hijack it as a pro-feminist, anti-slavery rant in Regency costume. Rozema indeed deviates by making deviates of several characters: Sir Thomas is a sadistic bully who verbally abuses Fanny and rapes his slaves, Lady Bertram is an opium addict,  and Mary Crawford borders on being a sexual predator who has no moral compass. Rozema's 'Fanny Price' is exactly the opposite of Austen's 'Fanny', and not in any way that improves upon JA's. Rozema's 'Fanny' is arrogant, smug,condescending, judgmental and more than a little conniving. Many have said JA's 'Fanny' is her most difficult character to like; I found Rozema's impossible to like. Hardest to stomach after the politicization is Fanny's contempt for her birth family during her enforced 'visit' to Portmouth. She looks down her nose at their struggle and poverty, and exudes an air of ""I'm just soooo above all this.""Why watch it at all? The cinematography is lush and the costuming lovely. I watch this Henry Crawford and could believe he might just really love Fanny, not this Fanny but JA's Fanny.  Jonny Lee Miller's 'Edmund' is my favorite among 'Mansfield' adaptations, and in Frances Price (Fanny's mother) you see the beautiful woman who married for love and now regrets that childish decision. Unfortunately none of that helps 'Mansfield' rise above it's shortcomings as an adaptation.As a period piece 'Mansfield Park' has a certain attraction, and can stand on its own rather well. It simply has little merit as an Austen adaptation.",Mansfield Park VHS

Turn off your brain for this one, because you will lose active cells.While Miner's ""remake"" has none of the style or finesse of the Romero films, it's still an enjoyable enough zombie action shoot-'em-up and watch the heads fly movie. If you're looking for a Romero-like movie, pass this one by. If you've got an hour and a half to kill and enjoy a video that you can go MST3K on, then you might like this one.I wonder what George Romero thinks when movies like this come out, or does he try not to?",N/A

Mark Wahlberg, despite a previous prejudice because of his prurient beginnings, is the only redeeming part of this dubious ""prodigal son"" theme cast in a pornographic movie about the sad human condition that always has and always will be a force to be dealt with in our world.

This was one of the rare sci-fi movies that we watched, then tossed.  The effects were very good, but I found this movie to be all effects with little substance.  That can be okay with even a predictable, rudimentary story, as long as the story is clear and can be followed.  Unfortunately, the elements of good storytelling were largely missing from this movie, and the effects, good as they were, couldn't carry it.  I'm a lifelong sci-fi can, and if you want real sci-fi, get Alien or Terminator and skip this one.",N/A

Instead what I saw was nothing but pampered spoiled celebrities who did nothing but whine and complain as to how hard it was for them to slum it in other people's countries and homes.  It made me sick.Spoiler alert - This DVD wasted way too much time observing preparation of Mr. McGregor, Mr. Boorman, and crew.  It was pathetic when they threw a baby fit that they did not get the motorbikes that they wanted.  It was wrong that they got a free trip, filming, and promotional items, when they can easily pay for it themselves, just because they are actors.  Their egos were way out of line with the Russian consultants.  It was absurd that they paid off the boarder guards and were not arrested for bribing them in the first place!  Charlie accidentally splashed gas into Ewan's eyes.  The producer (I think that was his title.) said that this could be the end of the trip, if not then a serious delay, with no regards to Ewan's safety, wellbeing, or eyesight!  I got so tired of hearing Charlie complaining about the roads and the mud.  He said that if you planted explosives there you still couldn't destroy the road as much as it's destroyed.  He had no compassion for the people who have to live there and actually use the roads on a regular basis....and that was just disk one.

It has the ingredients to be very funny:  Will Farrell and John Riley are 40 year olds who still live with their single parents.  Once the parents hook up and get hitched, they're step brothers.  Just typing that has more comedic value than this feature film and what I wrote out wasn't very funny.You start with the script.  I believe I saw that Farrell actually had a hand in the screenplay and that is simply embarrassing.  This is the kind of garbage that could ruin a career in most cases, but when you look at the above names in the initial paragraph, these are the people who can really dig on people licking dried dog poop and a woman going #1 in a urinal in the mens bathroom.  Oh, you want more?  There's no toilet paper, so Will gets up, puts his rear end in the sink and uses a bath mat to wipe off?Unless you're a really lame 8 year old, I can't possibly understand what type of brain power someone must have to think anything is remotely entertaining about it.This is an actual scenario in this movie:  Farrell plays Riley's drums.  Riley gets mad and bashes Farrell in skull with cymbal.  Farrell acts like he's dead.  Riley drags Farrell outside and digs a grave.  Farrell gets up after Riley is in dug grave and hits Riley in head with shovel.  Farrell buries Riley alive.  Riley pops hand out of grave in backyard and crawls out of 7' of dirt.  Expletives proceed.  Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha.  This is genius!!It does have a rare quality in which you're astonished at just how horrendous it is that you have to keep watching to see how much dumber it gets....and BINGO!!!  it succeeds.  I made my wife and her sister stay in the room when they begged for me to turn it off because I promised there's no possible way it could have a running time over an hour and thirty five minutes.  I think I was right even though it does seem like you're watching a 'Lonesome Dove' length mini-series.Your brain will hurt badly.  These guys run around and just group bad words together in a juvenile way.  I guess because it's Will Farrell and he says it, it's funny.  It's not at all.

896425,"There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this video. It's the worse kind of Disney bottom budget Cash-In. They simply repackaged a few awful made-for-TV episodes that are too scary for younger viewers and too boring for older kids.This DVD contains a few Disney Princess stories that were obviously culled from the early 90's Disney Channel made-for-TV episodes. The animation is terrible - nothing like the movies, and even the colors of some of the characters are wrong. The quality of the artwork on the cover of the DVD is MUCH better than the animation on the DVD itself.The stories themselves are horrific. One has Ariel unable to laugh while evil blowfish cast spells on her companions. Then, there's a completely abridged version of Cinderella - using the movie's footage, it tells the whole story in about 5 minutes. The Jasmine / Aladdin story is atrocious. Besides the usual Disney Channel made-for-TV slipshod animation, you have Jasmine being turned into a scary snake and a bunch of bandits robbing them at knife point while Aladdin is drowning (!!!).The so-awful-it's-funny part of the DVD is the hacked together ""intros"" to each segment which are performed by Ariel, Cinderella, and Jasmine. The animators took what looks like 15 frames of the character's mouths moving (culled from some scene in the actual theatrical releases), and played them in a loop, and then just dubbed audio over it. No attempt is made to match their mouths to the audio that you hear. A real low rate hack job. I've seen better attempts on YouTube.",Disney Princess Stories: Beauty Shines From Within

He is also the luckiest, since he does not have to endure the rest of the film.Five years after murders rock a high school, film makers return to shoot a film based on that event. Slowly, members of the cast and crew begin disappearing, indicating the killer is still lurking in the halls of Crippen High.The killer did not do enough slashing, he should have had a stab at this cliched script. All the film makers' characters have been done before. The director is all artistic frenzy, the producer is a sleazy scumbag, the screenwriter is ignored, and the actors are shallow. At one point, an actor playing a corpse with a hatchet in his face asks ""what is my motivation?,"" as if that joke has not been done a thousand times before.The hero here is a local cop and his cute actress girlfriend, who begin wandering around the set, writing down lists of names of the crew who have a connection to the high school. This plays like rejected scenes from ""Harriet the Spy,"" as they happen on a conversation, whip out a notebook, and nod and write. In the end, they do not even solve the murders, as the killer is revealed a'la ""Scooby-Doo.""Other familiar faces here are Vince Edwards, who proves he will appear in anything for a paycheck, and Maureen McCormick, TV's Marcia Brady, who has an odd role as an oversexed police woman. Clooney does disappear early, but the look on his face tells you he has to do this silliness to fill a resume.The film makers constantly try to trick the viewer with ""are you watching the film or the real thing?"" scenes that get real old after a while.

""Night of the Komodo"" had a no-name cast, lousy script, lousy special effects, and was a complete waste of time. The good news is ""Python"" had a couple B-level actors in the cast, and appears to have had some kind of budget...the bad news is, that it is as much a waste of time, and as hard to sit through as ""Night of the Komodo"" was.

1233623,"[...]Donnie Darko was truly an original and memorable movie. Darko was written and directed by a young and gifted filmmaker named Richard Kelly. The movie struck a massive chord with its intended audience after the studio botched its theatrical run. The DVD sold like hotcakes and was one of my favorite films of 2001. Flash forward to the here and now and we have S. Darko, a pseudo-intellectual wet noodle of a debacle. S. Darko is nearly unwatchable and easily the worst film of the year so far. Poorly acted (most of the miscast young actors stumble around vacantly and able to produce a single emotion), written, and directed, its a miserable movie-watching experience.S. Darko is about Donnie's sister Samantha (a broody and sullen Emo) who wanders around with another sneering Emo on a road trip to So Cal. Their car breaks down in a hellish small town in Utah populated by a hunky mechanic (a comatose Chuck Bass from Gossip Girl). Chuck smokes and tries to look edgy and seductive in Hanes white T-shirts in an odd bid to prove his heterosexuality, but he fails miserably, much like the movie in general. The other characters include Iraq Jack (wtf), a totally miscast and awful James Lafferty of the popular CW teen soap One Tree Hill. We also get a dumb cop, freaky Christians and an embarrassed looking Elizabeth Berkley of Showgirls and Saved by the Bell fame, blurting out some of the worst dialogue ever written. The plot has the basic conceits of the first film, minus any kind of menace, style, or wit. The bunny mask is there, the head has barbed wire around it so Iraq Jack can mutilate himself. A gratuitous and gruesome scene ensues. There's so many holes in the movie, I lost track after 50 or so. At one point meteorites start falling all around and no one seems to notice or care. The combination of the awful CGI and the non-reaction from the dead cast did produce some laughs. At this point I lost the will to keep going.S. Darko sucks.

990029,"I wanted SO much to like Ultraviolet,but it is plagued by poor editing and subplots that are either unfinished or thatsimply go nowhere.It is all look but no substance.The movie starts with Ultra telling us""I was born into a world,you may not understand"".Truer words were never spoken.The story concerns a research organization that alters a virus that has been around for centuries.The intention is to create stronger and faster soldiers;instead they create a contagion.We are told by a voice over by Ultra that she contracted the disease when her husband was killed(blood splattered on her),which in turn killed her unborn infant.As a result she fled underground and formed a resistance.A few scenes later we get our first plot contradiction,as she enters the research facility under the guise of being a courier to pick up a package.She gets the suitcase containing the ""weapon"" but her cover is blown when the real courier shows up.As she fights her way out security identifies her as one who has been confined to the facility in the past for EXPERIMENTATION and whose pregnancy was PURPOSEFULLY terminated(!?).She was human at one time but is now a hemophage like the rest of the resistance.The movie continues as she heads back to resistance headquarters and at one point stops to look inside the white case she carries.She discovers the ""weapon"" is a young boy.Her priorities,for some reason we're not privy to,change and she suddenly becomes a protective mother;totally opposite to the character we've so far seen.She spirits the boy away from the resistance leaders and turns to a fellow hemophage by the name of Garth for help.For some reason which again we are not privy to,Ultra needs a blood transfusion and Garth,who has pointy teeth,says it's lucky she didn't ""convert"" with her light exposure(?).After testing the boy he tells Ultra he doesn't have ""vampiral anti-genetic blood""(??);in fact he is useless to them.So Garth is a ...vampire too?While there the boy writes some chemical symbols on a magazine and Garth files it away for future reference(as we shall see).At this point there seems to be some kind of feelings between Garth and Ultra but that sub plot is not furthered in any way.The boy apparently is dying and when Daxus,the head of the research facility,contacts Ultra to get the boy back she finally relents when Daxus reveals he is the father.She takes him to a mall to leave him there but she again cannot bring herself to go through with it but the boy runs away and is caught by her own resistance.She fights and succeeds in freeing him from their grasp.Daxus finally talks Ultra into bringing the boy directly to the research facility and she shows up;but unbeknownst to Daxus,as a hologram.Daxus reveals that the boy really contains an anti-human vuris.The hemophages are no longer a threat to him so he's created a new menace people will line up at his doors to get the antidote for.It doesn't take long for Daxus to realize Ultra is not real but by this time she is long gone with the boy.They end up in a playground where the boy in a short time finally dies.With a teary Ultra kneeling over him,she is killed by Daxus who has followed her via a tracking device in the boy.Next thing we see is Ultra waking up having been revived by Garth.We also now see for the first time that Ultra has vampire teeth!? Garth is also NOW suddenly convinced that thewriting the boy did on that mag cover he stashed away,is a cure for the hemophages!? Ultra is not moved as she thinks the boy is still alive.Of course the showdown has to happen between Daxus and Ultra and a battle royale it is.During it we learn that Daxus has hemophage blood also so the fight goes neck in neck until Ultra finally triumphs.She and the boy are united.The boy WAS alive because the hemophage cells in her tears helped to transform him also into a hemophage.I have left alot out but I think you get the general idea.As the movie progresses the plot incongruities make things go from bad to worse as one can easily lose track of what is happening.Characters are doing things from motivations only known to them.The resistance movement lives in a spiral tipped building.They own the first half while a chinese gang,Ultra battles,owns the top portion.And after the battle,how she gets from the rooftop to a street level area with the boy in hand is not explained.Things like this are thrown out at you continually.Even the special effects have their lax moments.During a chase scene on a motorcycle Ultra is travelling first alongside an office building then straight up until she reaches the roof.While she is in midair her image gets shaky which effectively ruins the power of the moment and of the special effect itself.I know nothing of the history or creation of this film but I am certain there was alot of footage that got cut out here and what an obvious hatchet job was done too.It is like a puzzle that not only got reassembled improperly but with pieces missing!Either studio pressure,budget constraints or both got this thing whittled down,but at the price of the integrity of the picture.What a disappointment to such a promising property.For those interested the picture and sound quality are excellent here.The special features contained therein consist of the trailer,a 30 m ""UV Protection-The Making of UltraViolet"" short and optional commentary to the movie by star Milla Jovovich.Give this one a definite pass.",N/A

Tired of running and being afraid for her safety constantly, she decided to fight back and be the aggressor this time.Well, against my better judgement I went to watch Enough anyway, and after sitting through 2 hours of hackneyed and preposterous story, I can safely say that this is one of the worst movies of 2002.  The script was poorly written, the characters were flat and undeveloped, the acting was horrid and the dialogues were terrible.  The scary thing is that Enough actually featured a talented cast, with Juliette Lewis, Noah Wyle and yes, even Jennifer Lopez, yet none of them were watchable, the performances were uninspiring and boring.Let's face it, domestic thrillers have been done numerous times before, unfortunately Enough didn't do anything new to set itself apart from the others in the same genre.  The direction was uneven, and the pacing was jerky, all of the obligatory gimmicks in a suspence movie were there.  ...",Enough

BUT BEWARE: this dubbed version does have the Korean soundtrack available, but it has NO English subtitles available (despite the fact that the Amazon page says it has both English and Spanish subtitles)!As with most dubbed movies, this dubbing is truly awful, sucking all the drama and humor out of the movie. I can understand including a dubbed version for 1) the educationally-challenged who can't stand to (or are unable to) read subtitles, 2) the culturally-challenged who can't stand listening to foreign languages, or 3) the artistically-challenged who don't understand how much is lost when the voices of the real actors are replaced by Grade-F ""voice talents"" with no acting ability.What I can't understand is why they would arbitrarily delete the English subtitles from this version. They already had them on the previous version, so what does it cost to include them here?One other note about this version: it's almost an hour longer than the theatrical version. This is good and bad, mostly bad. About half the extra material is worth watching, even thought it screws-up the pace of the movie. The other half is outright garbage that should have been left of the cutting room floor.",N/A
657823,"Good Luck Chuck(2007) is a vulgar, mean, idiotic ""romantic comedy"" starring Dane Cook and Jessica Alba. The first hour is jam packed with nudity and soft core sex scenes! It also has its share of romantic comedy cliches. The film casually pokes fun of Asian people, religion and fat women! Even leading lady Jessica Alba criticized the film. The film's trailer did a good job hiding most of the vulgarity in the movie. Good Luck Chuck exploited a lot of talented people. The film has a ""surreal tone"" as a bitter ""Goth girl"" puts a hex on Charlie/Chuck. There's a Good Luck Chuck movie poster that spoofed John Lennon and Yoko Ono. The film fails to make Charlie a character that we could like. The movie also sends an irresponsible message as dozens of women in the story have carefree, casual sex with Charlie! The film makes phony attempts to tug at our heartstrings.Good Luck Chuck starts off on a bad note with 12 year old children talking to eachother about sex at a party. Did the parents of these child actors read the script? Hollywood starlets Alba and Chelan Simmons do their best in the film even though they're stuck with a bad script. Some people like this film!

Whenever US had some fine president, they got him killed like Kennedy, or impeached like Clinton, and then think that someone no woman would like to fool around with will be up to the job. The father's limitation was he couldn't do two things at the same time (for example stepping down some stairs and chewing gum). I was not sure the son can even do one only thing at all, but now I am, except anyone thinking that getting US down the drain can be regarded as a great achievement (except for those who still believe God is really pleased with suffering, and who were many enough to ask for four more years in misery). But, at least, this family is faithful to their beliefs, since the son could not think of anything else but to resume the war started by the father, and, this time, only demonstrating that it's the sheer opposition of two fanaticisms resulting from the complete dedication in superstitions based on dogmas they pretend to be religions.

From a trick bullet, defiance of physics and ignorance of thousands of hours of eye-witness testimony this video has it all, and it all adds up to sweet zilch. Sadly, the ugly propaganda head of the lame-stream media has continued to rise. Dan Rather of CBS forged Bush's National Guard documents. NBC altered George Zimmerman's 911 call. MSNCB cropped a video of an armed black man to make it seem like a white guy brought guns to an Obama rally. And most all the media continuously ran pictures of Trayvon Martin at age 12 and George Zimmerman photo-shopped to look ""white"".

Hollywood is first and foremost a business and no one is going to pass up the opportunity to squeeze more money out of a popular commodity. What's so frustrating about The Hangover Part II is the complete lack of anything resembling creativity or originality on the part of everyone involved. This movie is one of the most blatant examples of ""phoning it in"" that I have ever seen.The plot is an exact replica of the first film.

I could spend more time discussing the plot, but if you've seen the first film, then you've seen this one. The jokes are essentially the same, but the laughs are few and far between. The movie does seem to be striving to be cruder than the first, but it falls flat in that respect as well.

Mom suggests that she does nothing b/c if the husband really loved the girl, Mary would have felt it long ago and if she gets her friends involved then she'll just have another thing that she'll have to deal with.Mary finally confronts the other woman (Crystal) that's creeping around with her husband in a dressing room.  After Crystal obviously has no remorse about what she's doing, Mary confronts Steven (the rat) and says she wants a divorce.She gets the divorce in Reno but realizes too late that neither of them really want the divorce.  Steven feels that it is his duty to marry Crystal to protect what was left of her reputation.

It's worth a shot for a horror fan. 2 out of 3 stars.Aside from I am Omega, the rest only got 1 star from me (Omega got 2 stars). Evil Bong: I like fratboy humor but this was kind of stale. It was filmed on a camcorder and was about something-something. Meridian: too much romance to be considered horror. Looked made for 80s TV. It was a bore and quite sappy. Decadent Evil: was the porn? It featured a few boobs, but, for the most part, it featured dolls and ketchup for blood. Demonic Toys: 10 minutes in reviewer can't help but shake his head and wonder, ""Should I really sit here and watch this entire piece of crap?"" Toys and a 6 yr old boy are goring people to death? What kinda crappy 80s horror is this? It took about 30 minutes for the horror to begin. Prom Night: boooooring. Trying to cash in on Jamie Lee Curtis' Halloween fame is what created this easily forgettable snoozefest. I Am Omega: Made for Sy-Fy channel. It had action and zombies. It's basically a toned-done version of the Omega Man with Charleton Heston. Legend of Sorrow Creek: filmed in Canada on a camcorder. The main villains are a chick with no eyes and some fat hillbilly in overalls and plaid shirt. I am not kidding.All in all, this is not worth your cash.

866843,"After seeing the original production, produced in Japan, I was amazed at the contrast between the original and this Hollywood version knockoff.  Hollywood failed to deliver anything decent, despite the well made original movie they started with. This original story is tasteful, timeless and offers characters we can identify with.This plastic, Hollywood version of the same film showcases yet another uninspiring, typical Hollywood mysogyny mess filled with little more than the usual unmatched market-centered mediocrity.The Hollywood lead is the usual 'star' stud.  He pretends to be a middle aged, professionally advantaged, well-monied power monger who is bored with his life of excess and ease.  He decides to amuse himself and begins his clandestine diversions behind his wife's back.  He ventures into the ghetto, away from his peers and associates.  Here he enjoys slumming on the sly, in hot persuit of his target: a trashy, morally bankrupt, trampy, immature, barely legal dance teacher.  Their lines and interactions are vitriolicly vile in thier predictable, prepackaged, perverse platitudes.This original Japanese story gives far better.  Here is a man who is struggling to find meaning in a life filled with an emptiness he can't quite grasp. This original story isn't wonderlust, this is a shared sense of loss, futility, and disappointment that we can connect with.Hollywood plot changes aside, the casting choices were wrong.  Lopez gives the role a crass cheapness that crudely removes the ramining hints of class, elegance or distinction from the already disfigured indignity by Hollywood upon the original storyline.Here is a fine example of a beautiful story gone to hell in the hands of Hollywood.Hollywood doesn't make too many 'movies', mostly are little more than glorified infomercials, airbrushed extensions of playboy, and mindless marketing campaigns with idiotic dialog full of auditory advertisements and strict adherance to the ""sex sells"" standard.  I'd rather not support human objectification and sexual degradation in any form (no matter how subtle).My advice: Watch the Japanese original version of the film and forget about this remade wreck.Shall We Dance?

447421,"Curse of the Puppet Master (1998) After part five was promised to be 'The Final Chapter,' Full Moon Entertainment promptly started promoting the return of their popular characters in the ""Puppet Wars"" series, which looked to be fairly ambitious in scope, at least if you believed the drawn-long-before-the-movie-was-made poster art. But once again, Full Moon's ideas were bigger than their bank account, so instead we get this extremely cheap and tedious hour and fourteen minutes.The 'story' has the puppets suddenly and mysteriously under the thumb of a maniacal scientist trying to use their secrets to construct a life size puppet/human hybrid. Why? I have no idea. In and around this, the scientist's daughter and slow witted handyman frolic. Of course, the young dimwit is targeted by the scientist as the perfect specimen for his experiments, thereby seriously jeopardizing the romance. Finally, waaaaayy into this stodgy soap opera, the scientist sends the puppets out to kill a couple of guys. Yawn. This is far and away the worst of the Puppet Master movies.  This one truly looks like it was shot over a weekend on a budget of about $10,000. It was directed by David DeCoteau, who also made the best of the series, part three. But apparently recognizing the handicaps he was working with here, DeCoteau wisely chose to throw one of his female pseudonyms on for the credits.My last round of long winded squawking about this movie is in regards to where it fits in the continuity of the series. (I don't know why I care about this, but I do.) It doesn't work as a continuation of part five, since that set up the idea of more adventures with their new puppet master. About the only place it fits is between parts two and four (since three was a WWII era flashback). That still leaves two untold stories--#1: what happened at the mental hospital they were heading to at the end of part two; and how that led them into the clutches of the evil doctor here. Then you somehow have to #2: get the puppets from this movie's nonsensical non-ending back to the Bodega Bay Inn for parts four and five.

I haven't had such a negative reaction to a film in ages. I had no problem with the X-rated sex scenes and the bestiality sequence was something I've never seen before so that was kind of educational. My problem was with the snuff film sequence.I'm an old gorehound and I don't shy away from this kind of material but I feel context is very important when watching good gore. I like people and I don't want them to be eaten by Zombies so when I watch say Dawn Of The Dead I want to be horrified by scenes of carnage and I want the director to tell me I should be horrified.The problem with the gore in this movie is that its context is to serve as sexual titillation. Intercutting scenes of Laura Gemser having sex while looking through a window into the torture room with scenes of women being very realistically mutilated is way to perverse for me.

638733,"This movie was one of the all-time big disappointments.  It seems like they got everything wrong they possibly could.  I am not a purist, and I can certainly accept changes, but the only resemblence to the books, radio series or TV series (which all made changes) are the names, and the superficial aspects of some incidents.  The movie captured none of the wonderful, wacky feel of the earlier versions.I knew the movie was in big trouble when they started implying a Hollywood romance between Arthur and Trillian.  But when I saw what they did to Marvin, I knew the people responsible for this mess of a movie completely missed all the points.They tried to make a mass market movie from a cult classic, deleting virtually all the special flavor that made it a cult classic, but it's still too off-the-wall for mainstream audiences.This could have been a great film, if some attempt had been made to retain the spirit of the earlier versions.  Instead, it seems like a delibrate attempt was made to stamp out any semblence of such spirit.  The focus seemed to be on replacing all the wit and subversiveness with nifty special effects.I walked out of the theatre halfway through, keenly resenting the ticket price and the hour of my life so thoroughly wasted.

790656,"When does a trashy movie stop being fun and start being repulsive?  I've been asking myself this question ever since I saw Ching Siu-Tung's ""Naked Weapon"" (2002).  Ching is one of my favorite action directors.  His credits include the underrated gem ""The Terra-Cotta Warrior"" (1989) and better-known actioners like ""The East Is Red"" (1993).  He also provided the fight choreography for several of Tsui Hark's films and Zhang Yimou's two high-profile martial-arts movies.  So, seeing Ching's name on the credits of ""Naked Weapon"" instantly told me that the film would be a quality product.  But I was not only disappointed -- I was revolted.Now, I don't automatically fault a film for being a bit on the junky side.  Cult cinema certainly has its place, and so-called ""trash"" aesthetics can have their own positive properties that are as intriguing as the more ""respectable"" ones employed by more prestigious films.  So, just because some filmmakers might not take their subject matter seriously, or just because they might revel in the artificiality of their medium, that is not reason enough to condemn a movie.  Films that utilize trash aesthetics include many of John Waters' intriguing works and several enjoyable romps from Hong Kong like Luk Kim-Ming's ""Robotrix"" (1993).But ""Naked Weapon"" crossed the line from trashy action movie to something more disturbing.  Perhaps we're not supposed to take the film's premise -- a secret Darwinian ""school"" for female assassins where the pupils must kill each other to ""graduate"" -- at face value, but the subject is viewed with a solemnly straight face, not with a cartoonish or ironic distance.  Coupled with Ching's fierce fight choreography, the bloody, nerve-racking events faced by the main character, Charlene (Maggie Q), are harrowing in an unpleasant way.  Like other films I detest -- such as Masaru Konuma's ""Wife to Be Sacrificed"" (1974) or Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""Sal&ograve;"" (1975) -- ""Naked Weapon"" seems to encourage its audience to take sadistic delight in its lead character's misfortunes.This unsettling element reaches its pinnacle mid-way in the film when the ""school's"" cold-blooded leader, Madame M (Almen Wong), drugs her surviving graduates (presumably virgins) and has them raped by her male guards.  The scene is utterly gratuitous, and its gut-wrenching realism erases any ability to view the moment simply as a make-believe fiction.  The ""making of"" documentary that is included on ""Naked Weapon's"" DVD interviews Maggie Q and the other actresses after the rape scene was shot, and the women seem somewhat traumatized by the experience.  Why would a director want to put his actresses through such an ordeal?  For what purpose?  Furthermore, I would submit that the scene wants the viewer to identify with the rapists, rather than the women being raped.Now, let me be clear: I am not arguing against all depictions of rape per se.  The aquatic rape scene in ""Erotic Ghost Story II"" (1991) and the invisible rape scene in ""The Eternal Evil of Asia"" (1995) were too over-the-top to take seriously as portrayals of violence against women, as anything other than bizarre performances staged for the camera.  And there are more substantial films about rape where the viewer is made to indentify with the victim.  ""Naked Weapon's"" rape scene is in a different class entirely: a humorless, realistic moment where the (presumably male) viewer is allowed to relish the sexual suffering of beautiful women.  Moreover, Madame M never gets her comeuppance in the story (suggesting that the rape didn't warrant punishment), and Charlene's climatic battle with an out-of-left-field villain implies that it was her ordeals with Madame M -- including the rape -- that enable her to prevail.  Rape, the movie implies, is a relatively positive stepping stone toward female ""empowerment,"" something akin to a difficult step in a Shaolin student's martial-arts training.Some comments elsewhere on the Internet say that the rape scene in ""Naked Weapon"" shouldn't be taken seriously.  But the moment is played very seriously in this very serious film.  Others say that the scene should be taken within the context of the action genre.  I disagree: ""Naked Weapon"" is already a very grueling film about scantily clad women inflicting pain on each other in order to survive.  The action genre mandates neither the Darwinian violence of the ""student"" assassins against each other (I kept waiting for the girls to rise up against Madame M) nor the male viewer's pleasure in female suffering.  I'm appalled that anyone -- especially a director I respect -- would find this sadistic portrayal of rape and violence entertaining.",Naked Weapon

It was so slow and boring and, also irksome was the fact that the traumatized patient of the car accident and the events that followed at times seem absolutely unconnected to the basic plot of the movie.

255013,"This movie should have been billed as a spoof. After two, three, and four, it is obvious that the cast wanted to have fun with the story, and it is equally(and painfully)obvious that they really did not have a script. Kirk, McCoy and Spock are camping in Yosemite, when they are called back to go rescue the peace delegates on &quot;The planet of galactic peace&quot;. The delegates have been kidnapped by a renegade Vulcan named Sybok, who happens to be Spocks(half?)brother. That was a little too pat. Sybok's quest is to find God, who according to legend lives an the other side of the barrier at the center of the Galaxy. They rescue the delegates, only to have the delegates turn on them and turn him over to Sybok, who then turns his empathy powers onto the crew of the 1701-A, and who help imprison the Captain(Admiral!)and the Captain Spock. Except that they are rescued by the Captain Scott, despite his being exposed to the empathy powers of Sybok. Scottie then runs into a wall after saying he knows the ship like the back of his hand. The two captains are soon captured by Sybok's converts, but since they are now at or beyond the barrier, Sybok turns command back over to Kirk without even making him say pretty please. They find God, except he is not God but just some super energy being who was imprisoned in the ancient galaxy by forces/powers that we never find out about for reasons that are never stated. This scene produced the highlight of the movie, when Kirk asked &quot;Excuse me. Why does God need a starship?&quot;. A semi-renegade Klingon captain and crew were thrown in to spice it up, but ultimately they only give the movie two good lines for Spock: &quot;Damn you sir, you will try.&quot; and &quot;Please sir, not in front of the Klingons.&quot; The good-guys win, the bad guys lose, the betrayed idealist becomes the hero-martyr, and all is well again. Then we are back in Yosemite, but this time Spock knows &quot;Row, Row, Row your boat.&quot;It was obvious that the cast had fun doing this movie, but if I were the one titling it, it would be Star Trek Five: The Wrath of the Screen-Writers Guild.",N/A
71675,"I saw Psycho back in middle school about ten years ago.  I got my mom to rent it for me b/c she told me how good of a film it was. I remember watching 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' on Nick@Nite which I LOVED, so I decided to check out his movies. I watched PSYCHO all by myself in our finished, yet still creepy den, and was COMPLETELY unprepared for what happened to Marion!  It was obvious that Norm was a little ""off,"" however, like someone else said, he seemed so shy and so awkward that you would have never suspected him.  You would have thought that the extent of his weirdness was being a Peeper.  I was officially creeped out during the shower scene (my mom did not even mention this to me) and just the image of Janet Leigh's pupil and that shower drain was enough to make me turn on the lights.  I'm sitting in the dark in my apartment now watching GOLDEN GIRLS, and just typing about this movie gives me chills. Count me in the number that had to give themselves pep talks to take showers. Anyway, the movie was set up in such a way that you really thought Norman's mother was a menace!  From the creepy window scenes, to the voice, to him carrying ""her"" down the stairs and then the climax at the end, it was one big shocking ride.Fast forward to this triumphant tragedy.  When I used to faithfully read Entertainment Weekly, I remember reading about this remake.  I remember reading and seeing the shot-by-shot images and seeing Anne Heche laying in the tub. I thought ""what a crock!""  I definitely refused to spend my hard earned high school PT job money on this.  So I caught it on some cable channel in college, and I was absolutely offended. First off, if you're going to remake it, at least UPDATE it.  The dialogue was silly b/c obviously society is a lot less worried about being subtle.  You simply cannot be taken seriously when you acknowledge that the time frame is different yet do nothing to move the movie forward 30-plus years. Everything was gratuitous.  Psycho needed no nakedness, no self-pleasuring, etc. Again, where's the subtlety?  It is not a stretch to believe that Norman's stuffed birds got an eyeful after he watched Marion undress. Why is nothing left to the imagination anymore?I agree that only WHMacy and JMoore gave good performances. They are good actors period, but their roles in the original (although John and Vera were great) were not as key as Norman and Marion. Anne and Vince had HUGE shoes to fill. Vince works better in comedy and I can always take or leave Anne. There was no connection w/these characters. Of course Marion was wrong for taking the money, but who can say they didn't hold their breath waiting for the officer to back off? Who didn't hold their breath when Arbogast was interrogating Norman and clearly rattling him (same for Sam)?  None of that exists in this version.About my heading discussing the cover art.  Even though Janet Leigh is screaming on the cover, I still had no idea she DIED and even moreso so EARLY in the film. Contrast that with the obvious bloodbath on this version's cover. Less is more.I really feel for those who only have this version to go by or see this before Hitchcock's brilliant film, and cannot see what a shame this movie is.",N/A
1398274,"Amazon policy is to not talk about other critiques on a film here, but I must say the four glowing descriptions are by one-time reviewers, and I only looked into it because the film was just really that bad.The story follows a depressed cop as he muddles through a strange turn of events in his post family-killed-by-the-bad-guys life. Christian Slater plays the cussing, drinking killer priest (all only in church though) and Kim Coates plays the bad guy. At the ten-minute mark the screening became almost a laugh track as so many things had already gone wrong; The BD clarity was DVD to below average quality, the sound had been mixed poorly in every scene, the writing was obviously being improvised (later proven so in the making-of), and the overall feel of the film was beneath the low-budget approach.The long list of things that kept going wrong with the film made it to where I ended up offering the film for free and no customers were interested that had watched the clips. The music score drowned out dialogue, the flashbacks throughout the film of varying characters were cartoonish, and when the two main leads (Gooding and Slater) made it appear they were unhappy and miserable doing their parts - the film just becomes pointless. Kim Coates does save the day though, both in the film and in the making-of. The 11:49 minute supplement is also laughable as they left in all of the ""chaotic"" issues in making this film. But Kim gave a great snippet about knowing Gary Oldman years before and the advice shared by Gary to him, worth the watch just for that.The packaging shows Region 1 coded (obviously Millenium does not even invest in making their BD art correct), the sound says 5.1 but I dispute even that, English and Spanish subs. Writing about this will seem like I am trying to find more things wrong with the film but mostly I was making sure the four planted reviews here were countered just a bit. Not even a renter.",N/A

I just sat there wondering if I was missing something, but the others in the room assured me I wasn't. It was that bad. I never just stop a movie or walk out on it, but this one I was really tempted to do just that. Very poor narration by Samuel L. Jackson seemed painfully out of place, it would have far funnier if they used a one of those nature show narrator to add to the juxtaposition of the concept. The script was boring and reminded me of the dumb little video bits they did on America's Funniest Animals also with Bob Saget. It was just one of those dumb little video bit drug out for a entire movie, spiced up with bathroom and blue humor to I guess to entertain adults. Nearly every joke was lame and nothing near the quality of humor a number of this comic were capable of delivering.

1518566,"When I saw this movie I was hoping for a great swash buckling costume drama. That was not what I got.  This movie was ridiculous, that was really the only word for it. I cannot imagine what the people who put this thing together were thinking. The plot staggers all over the place without any substance. There is no drive to the story, no point to carry the story along. None of the heros made any connection with me, and did not leave me caring what happened to them. My impression of the King of France was to wonder why anyone would bother to fight for him.  The villians were just plain silly.  The Cardinal, supposed to be the main driving mastermind villan of the story, instead comes across as vague, bland and uninteresting.  The Duke of Buckingham was played more like a villain from an old cartoon show. There is a difference between comedy and farce, but you would not be able to tell that from this movie, which was pure farce.The sword fighting and special effects were nice to see, but nothing in the plot made any sense. The number of totally absurd things that happen are endless. You have whole fleets of flying boat/dirigibles, machine guns, flame throwers, intricate ""Temple of Doom"" type traps.Plus a Milady character who is a James Bond/Indiana Jones superspy. She slaughters an entire company of well armed musketeers in one scene, all while garbed in an elaborate French court gown, complete with nine layers of petty coats, and never even musses her hair. She sword fights better than Zorro, evades booby traps better than any cat burglar, again while never getting her wardrobe unsettled. And all of this happening in the 17th century!  And so on and so forth.  I like a good fantasy, but this was utterly ridiculous!It was a relief when this movie came to an end.

549538,"I just recently broke down and ordered two volumes out of this 10 set series of ""Lost Films of laurel and Hardy""(Volumes six-this one-and three):of Laurel and Hardy and Laurel and Hardy-related silent shorts.When I viewed them,I,nearly broke down.What a disappointment.This series has been on the market for about eight years now.I had already purchased quite a number of just the Laurel and Hardy shorts by themselves on VHS(VERY pricey!),which explains why I hesitated so long to buy them again on DVD.But I took the plunge,and definitely regretted it after what I saw.It seems it is getting harder and harder these days to trust ANY kind of marketing relating to any DVD releases,particularly when it comes to older films like these, and these releases just reinforce that distrust.To begin with,absolutely NONE of these films have been remastered in any way whatsoever visually,only a scant few have had part or all of their soundtracks remastered.All sources that have been used in the making of these films have been taken from existing master tapes of various origins from which only the producer Michael Agee knows for sure,but some of which we can be fairly certain of as you will see.About the only ""new"" thing about these films and apparently in reality about THE ONLY good selling point is the added soundtracks taken from the original Vitaphone sound discs.But they even had to push this too far by adding the Vitaphones to every other short in this collection that never had them in the first place!The two best that come closest to complete prints and in pretty decent shape are ""That's My Wife"" and(with a BIG reservation) ""Flying Elephants"".Let's start the ball rolling with the latter.The print of ""Elephants"" as I say is overall pretty darn good BUT except for an annoying square box in the right bottom area of the film....from beginning to the end!! I had to rub my eyes,thinking I was seeing things.And it isn't small,it distracts you constantly throughout the watching of the film. Whoever put it there is obviously hiding something,probably a ""banner"" of some kind on the tape this film was produced from.My guess would be Blackhawk films,but your guess is as good as mine.""Putting Pants on Philip"" is in not too bad of shape but I was disappointed in the film footage gaps that were extant.It's one of my all time favourite Laurel and Hardy shorts too.""Crazy like a Fox"" is a Charly Chase short and in poor shape;not a good print.""The Soilers"" is a Stan Laurel short and in God-awful shape.This short should run around 23 minutes.This truncated version runs a scant 10 and the print looks like something picked out of a garbage can.Lastly there is ""45 Minutes from Hollywood"".If ""The Soilers"" didn't get my goat bad enough this one topped them all.If you didn't believe me when I said these films are taken from existing master tapes THIS is the proof.Less than a minute into the film and continuing throughout the picture are very visible and annoying VIDEO LINES!! Yes that's right,those lovely little annoyances I just recently took the creators of the newly produced ""McHales Navy"",Shout Factory,to task on in their release of that series third season.And we can't forget also the Hallmark Laurel and Hardy DVDs that also have video lines.As I have said before;video lines are absolutely unforgivable.It shows a complete lack of respect for:1)The product,and2)The consumer.Let's move on and look directly at what is printed on every one of these releases.""...their original Vitaphone soundtracks have been restored from vintage 16"" phonograph recordings made in the 1920s"".Sounds great,right? Every silent film buffs dream come true?If you look closely at the notes for the indiviudal releases for each movie they mention the Vitaphone soundtracks included.Some will actually tell you that the Vitaphone disc is specifically from and for that particular movie;for example,""Original Vitaphone music and Effects soundtrack"".Those are the ONLY ones to believe.Any others that say something like "" Vitaphone soundtrack and effects"" or just ""music and effects"" are NOT from or for the movie you are watching;which appears to be the case with the majority of shorts in this series,whether Laurel and Hardy or not.They found some original discs for some films but the majority are lost and have used an amalgam of what discs they do have to provide accompaniment for the rest of the shorts in this series.It does get stale very quickly listening to the same music over and over and over again.""These vintage films have been meticulously digitally restored from the original 35mm negatives,dupe negatives or new safety fine grains"".Another piece of great restoration right?Remember what I said about ""45 Minutes from Hollywood""? That's right,TAPE LINES!! What this tells us is NONE of this material has been remastered...none.It has been digitally transferred;that's it.What movie hasn't in recent years since the advent of digitalization?? Transferred from....?? Master Tapes.""45 Minutes.."" proves that beyond a shadow of doubt.You have to read between the lines here.When they restored from 35 mm negs and dups you have to ask ""When were they restored""? My answer would be many,many years ago for most of this material,if not all, by people not even associated with the current producers of this DVD compilation.Want proof? If the covering up of the logo in ""Flying Elephants"" in this volume isn't enought to convince you,then go to Volume Three of this series.The first film on that DVD is ""Liberty"".A very good print one must admit.However what does one see in the opening credits? The good old Hal Roach plaque!! The same plaque used for all TV releases for the 1950s and onwards!! So the impression they give that these are NEWLY restored films is plain bunk,through and through.You can bet these films were transferred to tape years ago,taken from sources sometimes good(35 mm negs)and very bad(terrible mutli-generational dupes) and thrown together to get as close as they can to complete prints.Sometimes it works nicely,other times you just want to throw the DVD out the window.""These films have never been shown on television and most have never been released for home video"".I think the above example of ""Liberty"" destroys the first point of never having been shown on TV before;completely.Most if not all HAVE been seen on TV since the 1950s(the Laurel and Hardys in particluar) and I personally recall having seen them.Then they say that most have not been released on home video.Technically I suppose the Laurel and Hardy-related films out number the actual Laurel and Hardys so I guess they can claim that ""most"" of the films haven't been on home video( even that is arguable).But if we are speaking of just Laurel and Hardys,Hal Roach themselves released all of them themselves on home video(VHS) before putting them onto DVD!I bought them as did many others.The fact that they just didn't bother to change the package blurbs from VHS to DVD is the culprit here.Some of the releases mention that these DVDs couldn't have been released without the ""assistance of..."",usually film historian and preservationist David Shephard(who has done tremendous work in his field,especially on Chaplin material) and,on this Vol.6 release,by Serge Bromberg of Lobster Films in Paris.I have reviewed two DVD releases by Serge and Lobster films,""Flying Deuces-the Restored Version"" and ""Slapstick Emporium-The Stan Laurel Years,Vol#1 and both are highly recommended.I mention this because I think both David and Serge held back ,kept the good stuff for themselves and gave Michael Agee the leftovers for this release.""The Soilers"" is a good example.As I said above it is an absolute truncated abomination of a print.Want an excellent,full print? Get Serges' Stan Laurel ""Slapstick Emporium"" release where it sits in all its' full(24 minutes) and crisp,glorious splendor for all to see.In conclusion this DVD of ""Lost Films"",which were not lost(ANOTHER misleading statement) is a complete disappointment and an unmitigated failure on the part of the producer Mr.Agee.The liner notes give us false  and misleading statements throughout leading the potential buyers of these products assuming they are getting one thing when they are actually getting something altogether different.Under close scrutiny they just do NOT hold up at all.Let me be clear.As one of the Boys most devoted and biggest fans,there is nothing I'd rather do more than give them a ten star rating(if it was possible) for their great performances in these films;as they deserve nothing less.It is the visual aspect(as opposed to the performing aspect)of these releases that so degrade my appreciation that I can not in good conscience give this release any more than I have.Not only is it an insult,as I have already stated,to the product and the consumer it is the greatest insult to the memories of the greatest screen comedians there have ever been;Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy.And in their name I will never accept such shoddy workmanship as the producers of this release,and others that have come before would have us do,as any where near ""acceptable"".....NEVER!The only releases acceptable and worthy of appreciation are the recent MGM and Fox films(see my reviews for those).Avoid these releases altogether.The Laurel and Hardy product in North America AGAIN gets short shrifted.Will it never end?","The Lost Films of Laurel & Hardy: The Complete Collection, Vol. 6"

Guys like Steve Austin and Dwayne Johnson had dispelled the idea that wrestling types could be nothing more than cardboard caricatures.Sadly, this Kurt Angle vehicle proved that my original fears were, at least in this case, correct.This barely b-grade flick is evocative of the annual high school drama class production which we all cringed to watch in the school auditorium. 'End Game' delivered the near-perfect symbiosis of stiff wooden acting, ridiculous score, horrific costume design, derivative cinematography, and a plot that must've been written on the back of an IHOP menu.This pile of crap would've made the Troma guys embarrassed and Golan & Globus of the Cannon Group gawk in stunned amazement.If you went to film school for exactly one day and quit - you'd still have a leg up on Bruce Koehler, the hack that was given directorship of this cheapo monstrosity.",End Game

Ethan Hawke stammers so many times you wonder if he cracked his head getting off the Metro and addled his brains.  Julie Delpy is so old looking, worn out and haggerdy.  Her character's frequent soapboxing is tired too.I don't see much between these characters.  Clearly Julie Delpy's character is deeper, more introspective.  She challenge's Ethan Hawke's character several times, and all he can do is stammer and leer.Ethan is married, yet he is obviously more than ready to fling his committments aside and make a little French Connection (pardon the pun).  This is disturbing.  I mean, it is not like these two characters had some sort of deep or long lasting relationship.  They met briefly, talked, flirted, and drifted apart.  Now, ten years later, he is willing to throw aside his responsibilities for her.The movie is mostly about talk.  Talk, talk, talk.

Before Sunset is just another attempt by the left-wing, America-hating Movie Industry to stir up anti-American sentiments.  In this pathetically lousy flick, they cast the United States of America in the role of BIG BAD OPRESSOR, Land of Rape and Murder (watch for Julie Delpy's character's little ""boo-hoo, sniff-sniff"" speech early in the film about how she, the poor little sheltered French girl trembled with fear during a visit to America (where people are raped and abused by the police).  Her little diatribe about how an American policeman waved a gun about and basically threatened her was ridiculous and nauseating.The film makes it look like Paris is a haven, a cosmopositan but quaint world-class city with no crime, and New York City is a cesspool of murder and rape.  Interesting, considering the following statistics found on the International Crime Statistics Comparison website:Here are Interpol 2001 crime statistics (rate per 100,000):4161 - US7736 - Germany6941 - France9927 - England and WalesThus the US has a substantially lower crime rate than the major European countries!Here are the Interpol 1995 crime statistics (rate per 100,000):5278 - US8179 - Germany6316 - France7206 - England & WalesBesides the clearly WE HATE AMERICA, THE BIG BAD OPRESSIVE IMPERIALISTIC NATION message, the film just. . . sucks Seine water.I am a bonafide Francophile and adore France, but I am also a patrotic American.

1136526,"Where do I begin?  For one the summary for this movie is a lie, DMX is not a drug dealer called the dog calling the shots, he is in the movie for about 2 minutes and has no interaction with the characters, he is some odd narrator that say some non sensible quips from time to time.  The acting is perhaps the worst I have ever seen.  The story, where do I begin I could not understand what this movie was about one minute you got guys shooting each other, and then cops getting shot.  Then you got cops talking to the guy who everyone knows shot a cop as if nothing like that happened.  Then it jumps around and then you got preaching about how because these killing are in Black neighborhoods no one cares.  Then you got Lou Diamond Phillips overacting and then he is having an affair and then more people are getting shot and then you got renegade cops and then you got guys that visit their moms (oh how nice)and you got cops cheating on their wives and cops having threesomes and some drug dealer called the dominican and so on and so on. With my rambling run on sentence I probably do more justice to sum up the story than this movie does.  There is also some hypocritical message in the end stating that the New Orleans murder rate is high, then the very next message is something about honoring the fallen soldiers or warriors or something like.  Now I'm assuming that by fallen soldiers or warriors, theyre talking about the degenerates drug dealers and gang members that are getting killed in this violence, now call me reasonable (I know the writer and director would never understand this) but isn't saying the violence is too high and then saying the guys who got killed were heroes even though there they same type of people perpetrating the violence is kind of hypocritic.  I mean the whole movie is about gang members or drug dealer killing each other (I think, I really don't know what the movie was about), but that's okay because theyre warriors, but the killing is bad.",Death Toll

1683523,"For never was a version more slow, than this one butchered by Fellowes.Don't get me wrong -- I love modern adaptations of Shakespeare when they are well done, but I'm not even sure what this version was trying to be. It's not a modernized version, nor is it Shakespeare. The dumbing down of the language might have worked had there been any chemistry at all between two the leads (I actually dozed off during the balcony scene). However, as it's more exciting watching paint dry than these two, the loss of Shakespeare's beautiful language leaves an even bigger hole. There are also places in the film that make no sense because a line here or there has been left out, but is still responded to by another character. ??? Given, it was pretty arrogant of Fellowes to attempt to rewrite Shakespeare in the first place, the fact that he falls flat on his face in these areas kind of serves him right, imo.With the exception of Paul Giamatti as the Friar and Ed Westwick as Tybalt, the entire cast is passionless. Mercutio and the nurse, who are normally so animated (and written as such) are just as lifeless as the two leads here. If you want to do a modern version of R&J;, then update it completely and write a modernized script -- don't edit the Bard. Believe me, his text needs no &#34;help&#34; from you. This version just ruins the beauty of the language and encourages intellectual laziness. If kids these days don't want to learn to understand the original text, they don't deserve the joy one gains from reading, or watching interpretations of, the Master storyteller. The 1968 Zeffirelli version remains the quintessential film version. Do yourself a huge favor -- skip this drivel and watch that one.",Romeo & Juliet

596269,"Set in 2054, ""Minority Report"" follows the exploits of a cop and his pre-cogs - his what?!?  Three humans with exceptional clarvoyance and telepathic abilities predict crimes before they occur.  The system is flawless.  That is, until Tom Cruise finds himself being predicted as the next killer of a man that he has never met.  There's a lot of set up to this story that really drags, not the least of which is an extended chase on a vertical highway that is so CGI driven it is impossible to take seriously and a greenhouse segment that is full of lethal plants and a long explicative scene between the women who invented pre-crime and Cruise, who is nearly poisoned to death. In between we have some chase sequences that are not very engaging and a few gross-out scenes that really turn one's stomach, including one where Cruise, who has just had his eyes plucked from his head, eats a really spoiled sandwich by mistake and up-chucks a few seconds later.  I'm not sure what Spielberg was thinking when he made this movie.  It's dark, in a sort of ""Blade Runner"" way but with a bleached out color scheme that is not very engaging or easy on the eyes.  In fact it's down right oppressive.  Just in case you were too stupid to grasp the general concept of the film (which I must admit, for the first 30 min. I was) there's a long explanation at the end of the film in which dialogue between Cruise and the killer tie everything up nicely - too nicely and too neatly for a film that teeters between action/adventure and film noir.  Unfortunately, in this reviewers opinion, the ultimate product is neither but a mutt - a mix of a little of this and that, that comes off as nothing special in the final analysis.As for the DVD transfer - Dreamworks has retained the grain of the original theatrical experience but somehow managed to make the film look so grainy that, not even in theaters, do I remember it being this unpleasant a viewing experience on the eyes.  Quite literally, if you're watching this film on an anmorphic big screen at home, some of the scenes will make you sick.  The audio is nicely represented.  As a two disc special edition, disc two has a truck load of extras that are rather boring to watch.  Cruise looks and talks as if he's just finished an all night B-movie marathon while Spielberg somehow manages to retain none of that magic spark that made him become a director in the first place.  There is a sense, even from him, that he's done all this before and with far greater economy of wit, special effects, storytelling and charm.",N/A
1307388,"Further proof that finding a decent comedy nowadays is like finding Bigfoot.  Where do I start with this steaming pile of convoluted cow dung. The adorable Rachel Mcadams plays a morning show tv producer who has just been given the axe by her employers.  She is quickly hired by a much less respected network and sets out to pull this faltering news show out of the dumps.  Now that I have given a general synopsis I will continue to do what I had originaly intended to do here, completely trash this abysmal train wreck of a movie that stole nearly 2 hours of my life.  Mcadams is about as appealing as a chiuaua on speed in this movie,  she jumps around, chatters endlessly and knocks things over.  It was cute for about 10 minutes but got exhausting fast.  Enter the great Dianne Keaton, a foul mouthed news anchor who's less than satisfied with her role at the network,  she is given little to do here and gives the ""hey as long as the check clears"" impression.  We are then introduced to a character played by the usually dependable Harrison Ford, a gruff sarcastic highly esteemed news anchor who feels this network is beneath him, hey maybe thats a parable about this whole movie being beneath him.  The absolute worse thing about Morning Glory are the endless movie cliche's.  This was as predictical as movies get, not helped by annoying songs interspresed with scenes that were more jarring than feel good.  I wont even go into the forced love story subplot involving another coworker (Patrick Wilson in a completely thankless role).  What pisses me off the most about this movie is that this could have been a great movie.

The disk is too small to make a good frisbee and the story (which is supposed to be a psychological thriller) is neither psychological nor is it a thriller.Here is the story so you don't have to waste your time watching it.  Keaton plays a salesman who is set up to mentor a new man from the midwest.  The new man is engaged, so naturally Keaton's character, who is a really nasty fellow, starts having sex with his fiancee.  What he does not know is, the fiancee is a prostitute hired by a man who wants to take over the company.  Somehow Keaton's affair brings down the entire sales office and helps bring down the value of the company (since other prostitutes have been hired to sabotage other sales offices across the country.)  This creates an opportunity for the fellow who engineered the whole thing to buy the company for a cut rate price.  Keaton's character loses his job, finds out he's been played for a sap by a hooker, and then goes back to his old job at Northwestern University as a college prof.  The story ends with the people who set all this up laughing at him.  That is supposed to be a thrilling surprise ending, except that it makes no sense.

1482424,"I remember sitting in the theatre on August 13th, 2010 on my birthday in eager anticipation of the big, dumb fun to come in the form of Sylvester Stallone's '80&#8242;s action-tribute/ensemble movie, `The Expendables.' Fortunately, it was mostly everything I had hoped for: Big, powerful, bloody, gritty, unapologetic action interspersed with pretty laughable dialogue. Despite how pathetic that film often was whenever people weren't shooting each other, the original `Expendables' was still a good action movie because it nailed the right pacing and was able to etch out the right rhythm of bloody excitement and tough guys awkwardly shooting the breeze. Despite what all the highbrow critics thought, that movie worked both because of and in spite of Stallone's writing. It's sequel, however, does not.Somewhere in all the boringness of watching Stallone's latest cinematic effort, called `The Expendables 2,' I actually paused the movie to find out where exactly my friend and I were in the film because of how little action and how much boring, terrible dialogue there was. After nearly sixty minutes out of the film's 103 minute length, we had had exactly one action scene (all the way back at the beginning), and the rest of the schlock had been nothing more than Stallone's and Richard Wenk's awful, painful dialogue. The film went on for another five minutes or so before we finally got a quick action scene that wrapped up with a incredibly brief appearance of Chuck Norris, although I don't think we actually got to see him shoot anything.This is pretty much what the entire movie is. Although thankfully the snail's pace does pick up a noticeable amount in the movie's final third, most of E2 will simply bore you to tears, and given all the action and star power we were promised (including extended appearances by Norris, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Bruce Willis, and Arnold Schwarzenegger), that is simply unacceptable. For the most part, the problem is the pacing, as I mentioned. We all knew that the dialogue was going to be bad coming into this, so it wasn't like we were expecting some Shakespearean or Dickensian level of character development or colloquy. That's not my beef with this movie. The problem is that there is just so much of this awful, boring-ass dialogue, and hardly any action at all for the first hour of the film, and when the action finally does pick up in the airport finale, none of the shootouts or hand-to-hand combat match the violence from the first movie. That latter point is not necessarily a huge mark against E2, because the action in the original `Expendables' is pretty damn good, but given the sleep-inducing pace of most of the film, the fact that we are not absolutely blown away by the action when it does happen is disappointing. Really the only action scene that is up to par with the over-the-top violence of the original is in the opening scene.With that said, the action is still better than average, and I will take anything over the awful line delivery and forced jokes that make up most of the movie. I have a hard time deciding which particular conversation is the worst in E2, since they are all pretty awful and there are a lot of them. Some of the terrible jokes stick out more than the regular ""character growth"" moments, though. Dolph Lundgren's pathetic running attempts at comedic relief as a former chemical engineer or a math wiz or a super-genius or something (I don't remember what it was) is pretty bad, but so is the incredibly forced Chuck Norris joke about a cobra. I don't know, it's just all so boring and bad, and the fact that there is just so much of it makes it all the more irritating.As for the film's impressive lineup, that too is letdown. Willis and Schwarzenegger actually do some shooting in this movie, which is a small plus, but we don't see Norris actually shoot a guy on screen until the finale, and Jet Li leaves after the opening battle scene less than half an hour into the movie. And yes, before you interject, Van Damme does something cool...at the very end of the story for three minutes. Jesus, Stallone, if a cast member has less than fifteen minutes of screen time, or kills fewer than ten people, can you please not bill them as a ""starring role?""I don't know. I guess I just feel so cheated by the whole affair, and that's pretty pathetic considering that the action is pretty hard-hitting when it finally occurs (despite being underwhelming compared to the original). The first hour of E2 is so bad, and it's all because we have to watch a bunch of heavily muscled, macho, '80&#8242;s throwback guys pretending to be dramatic actors, when they should've stuck to what they did best and shot first and asked questions later. It would have been better than whatever the hell this is. Don't let people tell you that `The Expendables 2&#8242; is a revamped version of the original '80&#8242;s tribute. It's not. If anything, it's a watered down, lazy, half-assed version of the 2010 flick. It feels eerily like the outtakes from that movie, as if Simon West and Stallone simply took all the unused, cut footage from `The Expendables' and strung it together, and repackaged it to make another movie. It might as well be.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SCORE: 3/10+ The action is pretty solid...- ...when it actually happens. So much of the film is dedicated to boring, lazy, awful, sleep-inducing dialogue that goes on forever. The pacing in E2 is its greatest sin. And it's a big one.- Heck, this movie gets a con just for including that half-assed, pathetic Norris joke and Lundgren's ""super-genius"" gag.- Norris, Van Damme, and Li are disappointingly underused, and Yu is annoyingly overused.

531511,"One does try as hard as one can to avoid the working classes, although poverty and lack of transport make this problematic.  If curiosity about how they actually live their lives gets the better of one then what safer way than home video?  My last such glimpse into a strange and unfamiliar world was through Ken Loach's 'Kes', in which a frustrated and alienated young boy, cowed by an aggressive brother and the uncertainty of a benighted future down the pits, discovers that his best friend is a Kestrel.  Quickly crushing any aesthesia brought on by Loach's compassion for the great unwashed, it has taken the hyperbol surrounding 'Billy Elliot' to take me less than expeditiously down memory lane once more.  How have the lives of the working classes changed thirty years on?  Apparently they sleep two to a bedroom instead of six as I had once erroneously supposed and have inside toilets.  When a solitary worker has the temerity to want to do a day's work he is chased through a succession of working class dwellings by fifty riot police in full regalia until caught.  It's gratifying to see such a realistic prioritizing of police resources on film and the comforting knowledge of the tax payer's money well spent.  Apart from that, little has changed except for one egrigious detail.  Your actual working classes pirouette down the high street. Billy Elliot, a frustrated and alienated young boy cowed by an aggressive brother and the uncertainty of a benighted future down the pits, discovers that his best friend is a ballet tutu.  Also, his second best friend just might be a transvestite.  This irresponsibility on the part of the British film industry should not go unanswered.  This is not Hampstead.  Encouraging the lower orders to experience culture only leads to books, and books lead to union membership and then (God help us) secret ballots. I think the need to appeal to the American market has reared it's capitulant head here.  Pleas for sexual tolerance and finding your inner child are more important than a roof over one's head and the dignity of (hard) labour.  Kestrels are aggressive, macho symbols that may lower the tone and pull a boy's false eye lashes off.  Of course, we must take all these changes on trust, but how accurate is this to real working class lives?  Unlike the ending to 'Kes' which leaves the audience basking in the warm glow of their own undoubtedly justified prejudices, 'Billy Elliot' leaves us suspicious and distrustful at it's challenge to the natural order.  Yes, we may let the odd one escape to become rock musicians, sportsman and soap stars, but let us not get carried away.  This is an American fortune cookie, not OUR Britain, thank you very much.Now, one may be prepared to sit through working class life when the film making calibre of Ken Loach is involved, but when confronted by the almost obdurately dire artistic decisions and cack direction of Stephen Daldry, the urge to hit the off switch is overwhelming.  There are, no doubt, worse experiences one might be subjected to in one's drawing room than 'Billy Elliot' such as listening to pibroch while having your leg chewed off by a shark, but it's a close run thing.  It may be in the unlikely event prejudice (heaven forbid), but I thought this film was quite staggeringly, fall off Ben Nevis bad.  It's jocund liveliness cannot hide it's jejunity (and trying saying that fast, I guarantee it will be more comprehensible than 'Billy Elliot'). And if I have to endure one more scene in which a minor turns to another minor (as opposed to a miner) and after a long pause says &quot;do you want to play hide the salami with me&quot; or words to that effect, I shall emigrate to Botswana and I don't even know where that is.  Do contemporary writers think this is cute and cuddly coming from children, as opposed to deeply creepy put in their mouths by an adult?  May I suggest that in an act of charity not dissimilar to their salt of the earth goodness depicted in 'Billy Elliot', our actual working classes band together to confer on the writer Mr Hall, the useful and life changing gift of an escritoire?",N/A

501783,"This film is a remake of the 1962 horror classic of the same name.  The 1962 original was atmospheric, darkly poetic, haunting; its story a subtle balance between two alternate interpretations.This is none of those.  This remake is a clunky mess, arbitrarily meandering through pointless  scenes and aimless &quot;monsters&quot; lifted from JACOB'S LADDER.Aside from the monsters, a line, too, is lifted from JACOB'S LADDER.  The one about demons and angels.  This makes *some* sense, as both the  original CARNIVAL OF SOULS and JACOB'S LADDER are inspired by Bierce's  &quot;Occurance at Owl Creek Bridge.&quot;The 1962 film had a beginning,  a middle, and a twist ending.  This 1998 remake has numerous beginnings,  middles, and ends.  Scenes switch back and forth as the lead character  keeps &quot;waking up&quot; to indicate that all that went on before was a  dream.  If not for the rough road map provided by the original film, we'd  have an even murkier idea of what's going on.Basically, a woman drives  into the river, and at times seems to have escaped, at times is just now  escaping, at times appears never to have driven into the river at  all...Not clever, just confused and confusing.The original film's  cool lead actress portrayed a young woman afraid of life, who &quot;hadn't  really lived.&quot;  It was subtle, yet the point was made.

329205,"It came as a shock to see Mick Jagger's visage staring out from the dvd case of this movie but it also immediately raised my suspicions.  For, as big as the Rolling Stones are, if the movie had been any good certainly it would be well-known.  I suspect that any play this now gets is by people curious to see Jagger act.Ned Kelly is an Australian outlaw hero who has taken on mythic proportions.  If you spend any time around Australians (males, anyway) it is a sure bet that Ned Kelly's name will come up at some point, often in relation to his use of boiler plate armor to fight off the law.  That's about all I know about him but his is a romantic story begging to be put on film.This attempt falls flat for any number of reasons, yet the look and feel of the movie should be commended and alert viewers to the beauty of many of the movies made in the 1960's and 70's; the look of which aren't or can't be duplicated using today's modern methods.  It's not what the director intended, I'm sure, but watching this movie made me nostalgic to go back and watch Peckinpah and Sturges, among others.The real problem with this movie is that the script is crap, as is much of the acting, including Jagger's; although, he is still fun to watch.  The writers fail to supply a narrative that pushes the story forward in a logical manner.  Rather than dialogue the actors are given single lines which, because they are mostly mere responses or interjections do nothing to tell the story.  This might have worked if the visual narrative stood in for the lack of real dialogue (Anyway, real dialogue would have been difficult to understand beneath the thick Hollywood brogues).  Instead the movie is comprised of scenes stitched together in a kind of incoherent moving picture mural.The soundtrack doesn't help unless you like Country music, that is, and I mean 1970's style Country rather than the Country Pop of today.The music isn't poorly done, even if not to my liking, but it turns the mood of the movie into a sort of Irish Republican allegory.  One suspects this was intentional as the troubles in Northern Ireland had begun to flare up around the time of this movie.  I'm not sure if the actors were in on it but it seems pretty difficult to misapprehend today.This movie is recommended only to people who want to look at Mick Jagger.",N/A
1360306,"So I'm starting here with that simple statement, I don't get it. And I just don't. I watched this series just released on DVD and found that I just didn't get the attraction or rave reviews the show has garnered. For a comedy show about a comedian I found it offered very few laughs.LOUISE tells the story of comedian Louie (played by Louis C.K.). Just divorced and a doting father, it tells of his everyday life and what happens in it. Some moments are touching, some funny and some just perplexing. But it's his life and so we watch what happens. We try to relate to the situations he finds himself in. And short of living in New York I don't think many people do find themselves in most of these situations.The series covers such topics as dating after divorce, trying to raise kids, having fights with your friends and more. Intermingled with the stories are a few comedic moments but for the most part each episode just feels dry and lacking something. Laughs perhaps?The series has received all sorts of accolades and comparisons to other series like CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM. I might be in the minority here but that's a series I've never seen. And if it's anything like this one I doubt I'd ever want to.So what is it about series like this that make people rush to praise them and talk about how wonderful they are? Why is it that shows concerning themselves with the miseries of someone trying to get on with life are entertaining? All I saw here was a man who had great friends but had trouble with a love life or a life at home. Isn't that the life that most people lead? Aren't we all having problems we have to confront and find solutions for daily? And if so and I'm living this, why would I find it entertaining watching someone else do what I do every day? Well I mean with the exception that I'm not making nearly as much money or on TV each week.I've seen Louis C.K.'s stand up act and know he can be quite entertaining and funny. But there's a difference between writing a stand up routine that is fine tuned over so many weeks on the road and trying to make up new jokes or funny antics on a weekly basis. The episodes I made it through here felt like they were one joke ideas that entire episodes were then built around. A single joke with plenty of filler. It would be as if a regular hamburger were placed on a Big Mac bun and covered with double toppings. Sure the meat was there but it was so covered by other items that you couldn't enjoy it.I don't know. Perhaps over time I will get what everyone else is saying about shows like these. Perhaps I won't want to. Until then I'll watch things that make me laugh, make me cry, keep me on the edge of my seat or make me jump out of it. As for now I think I'll pass by this one. You should too unless you like something so far off the wall that you can't even find that wall.I know I'll be raked over the coals by fans who adore the show as has happened to me before here. But the fact remains that not all comedy works for all people. Some may enjoy this while others don't. If you choose to give it a shot, then walk in with an open mind not swayed by my slam or by those who praise it. Make up your mind for yourself.",N/A

I don't think these movies need to be this graphic and disgusting to be entertaining but, then again, this one doesn't have a leg to stand on in that department either.  Terrible acting, a bad script, lousy effects, and sorry, but Rebekah Kochan is not that hot looking.  All this movie is is an exercise in disturbing images and lots of irritating screaming.

584461,"Spy Game is an intellectual ""thriller"" that brings together two of Hollywood's best: Robert Redford and Brad Pitt.  Unfortunately, it was this attempt to be intelligent that brought the movie to its knees.  The beginning of the movie seemed promising (Brad Pitt's desperate attempt to escape the Chinese prison), yet the script turned out be very dry and the action very limited.  A large portion of Spy Game was spent largely on dialogue... not very good dialogue, mind you.  More captivating films tend to show these professional spies in action, i.e. jumping out of airplanes or making large buildings explode.  This may not be the case in real life, but it's what we paid to see.Robert Redford may have acted his character well, but was he interesting enough to glue his audience to the screen?  And then about halfway into the film, Redford's character has a flashback back to the Vietnam days that almost completely de-rails the whole focus of the film.  The viewers get stuck into a helicopter combat sequence that really adds nothing to the movie as a whole.>> 1 star.  Takes a ridiculous amount of patience to enjoy this movie.

866036,"Amazing how people will accept things based on a label.  The term in movies and TV ""over the top"" in reality means the writers and directors have no restraint or taste.  Deadwood initially had me devided between loving the characters, plot, setting and hating the ""over the top"" use of constant swearing.  Yup, I'll bet there was plenty of swearing back then but there was a balance of normal conversation and salty talk just like there is today.  I sat in a breakroom with a co-worker recently who went on a tirade about something or another for no more than 5 minutes.  I kept track of how many times he used the ""F word"" in those mere 5 minutes and it was 75 times. He also used the word ""dude"" about as many times but I couldn't keep track of both words.  Too much work! It would be interesting to take a work of Mark Twain and fill it with F***ing C**ks***ers to the point of absurdity.  His artful writing would be obscured with the attention drawn to childish profanity.  I use the ""F word"" on occasion when the occasion warrents but I use it for the ultimate of expression.  In other words I use it when circumstances themselves are ""over the top"".  Its a GREAT form of expression when used when something has got you completely and absolutely rilled.  Therefore, I RESERVE it for times I want to make a point when normal language doesn't suffice.  And there's the problem with Deadwood, a Mark Twain should have written the script and been allowed to pepper in some salty dialogue for occasional EMPHASIS.  Mark Twain spent some time in Silver City, Nevada and had real life experience with what the town of Deadwood was really like so too bad he's not around.  I'd sure like to have Mark Twain write the script for Deadwood but it sounds more like it was written by my co-worker.  Yo, yo, yo mother f***ing c***sucker the wild west was never so f***ing cool, dude!

94712,"What where they thinking giving the script for this movie the green light? Obviously Warner bros. Where just cashing in on the franchise and decided that casting the movie with big names will make it sell, but don't worry about finding a script for it.Val Kilmar replaces Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/ Batman. And he obviously never bothered to watch how Keaton portrayed Batman because he went in a completely wrong direction and made the Bruce Wayne character stiff and almost lifeless at times. The main character of Gotham City is the main focus of the Batman franchise, why cast such a boring actor to drain the life out of character?Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face and Jim Carrey as the Riddler you would think would make a great combination, Tommy as a great actor and Jim bringing the humour to the film, however both of them turned out the worst performance of there acting career's if you ask me. Tommy Lee Jones may have acted like a character he had never been seen to do before, but that doesn't make it good. And Carey did not bring what he should have either, and his acting was horrible too.Nicole Kidman playing the physiatrist to Batman also turned over a new low and created her worst performance too. Her character had no thought and no life behind it, just a familiar face to see on screen.The only actor in this whole film apart from the guy who returned to play Alfred is Chris O'Donnell. But even O'Donnell's excellent portrayal of Robin couldn't save this movie. At least he got to reprise his role in the next Bat-movie and be in a movie much better then this garbage.Please, forget about the cast, I know this movie has a lot of well-known actors, but please, forget that for one moment and take a look at the acting. Take a look at the plot, I was more interested to watch how bad the CGI was in backgrounds then I was in trying to find a good thing to say about this god-awful film. This film was sold on the cast alone. The Big name stars where all that was needed to sell this movie and to cash in on the franchise, and I wish that was a crime, because all it does is produces bad movies and major Hollywood rip-off's that make way for similar cheap scams and ideas by these companies to see what they have got to cash in on.The overall movie's plot could have been interesting with a few tweaks here and there, but instead it has become one of my personal ""worst movie of all time"" contender choices. The movie also murders the realism the first 2 movies had, as far fetched as some things where, at least you could believe it was somewhat in the same reality as the one we live in. Where as this movie and in the 4th one Gotham City has gone from a realistic city to the worlds oldest, most historic and gigantic city in the entire world where all crime bosses and villains seem to be lured to or they are created there.

114027,"Arsenic and Old Lace has a problem.  On the one hand, it is an absolutely an A team effort.  It stars two of the best in Cary Grant and Raymond Massey.  Priscilla Lane as Cary Grant's wife is cute and much put upon.  Then with Frank Capra directing, Max Steiner' music and lush photography by Sol Polito, the result is a very attractive to look at production.On the other hand, no matter how it is dressed up, the story is about a family of serial murderers.  The requirement for a suspension of critical review (the aunts are stone killers; the Raymond Massey character is a murderer and torturer; the Cary Grant character has been a torture victim) is too great for me.  Since none of the killers ever say or do anything that is funny (all those lines belong to other characters) watching this movie becomes an exercise in holding down the gag/revulsion reflex.If I were to look at the stylishness of the production it would rate 4 or 5 stars.  My policy is to try to accept a movie based upon its own premises.  However in this instance, the story is so unremittingly morally bankrupt, that to overlook this lack of principles is to not see the movie before you.

530694,"Beside bringing every tired cliche of the men who went to Viet Nam this movie has the added attraction of being exceedingly boring. A film can sometimes get away with a total lack of character development if the action is sufficient to keep it moving (ala ""Black Hawk Down""). This film has neither. The characters are cardboard cutouts and the action is so plodding it stands still. This could be better described as a SDS propaganda film made twenty odd years after the fact. The use of 16mm film could have added power if there had just been something of a story to be told.Instead we are introduced to the caring Bos, but we are never given any clues to why he cares, who he is, or what he actually thinks about anything. It's just one stereotype after another. We have it all in this film, the sadistic DI, the psycho recruit, the uncaring leader trying to fill a quota, and the savvy mentor fresh from the carnage.

Now I'm a pretty big Kubrick and Spielburg fan. But this movie made me feel like I was dying slowly.The story has an interesting premise to it.  But the cinematography and acting is so disturbing that after awhile the movie just becomes painful to watch.  The movie really feels like two movies in one and the point in which the directing duties changed from Kubrick to Spielburg are so obvious.  The camera angles and special effects change as if someone had just snapped their fingers.I major complaint is that the movie is just sooooo long. I don't know why Spielburg kept running with the plot but it just keeps going. The entire end of the movie is completely unnecessary and really contrasts with the main body of the story.  Just drags on with no end in sight.If you want a very different movie to watch or something that gives you the creeps, then by all means, give AI a shot.

1308295,"Min-Woo Hyung's ""Priest"" was a Korean manhwa about a gun-toting priest who sets out to defeat a gang of fallen angels bent on destroying the world.Now forget about that, because the movie ""Priest"" has absolutely nothing to do with the manhwa. Instead, this a generic vampire-slaying/rescue/revenge movie set in a completely generic dystopic future, with a choppy rushed story and painfully predictable writing. Paul Bettany is mildly cool, but we're never really given a reason to care about his character.It takes place in a dystopian future where vampires have... somehow turned the world into a desert wasteland, before being shut up in reservations. The only surviving authority is the Catholic Church, who trained vampire-slaying Priests to kill vampires -- but after the war, they were disbanded and are now shunned.Several years later, a small-town sheriff (Cam Gigandet) enters the walled city to ask the help of an unnamed Priest (Paul Bettany): the Priest's brother and sister-in-law have been murdered by vampires, and his niece has been captured. Against the orders of the Monsignor, he sets out to rescue his niece... but he doesn't know that she's in the grasp of an old enemy.Since it basically dumped the manhwa plot, ""Priest"" is cobbled together with bits of other movies: ""Blade II,"" ""Judge Dredd,"" ""The Searchers,"" ""Mad Max,"" a teeny bit of ""Lord of the Rings,"" and especially ""Solomon Kane."" And no, it's nowhere NEAR as much fun as any of the above films, even the horrible ones -- it's too bad to be enjoyable, but not nearly bad enough to be funny.And Scott Stewart is just AWFUL -- what else could you expect from the guy who made ""Legion""? Horrible dialogue (""I can smell the blood running through your veins. Smells like... dinner""), chaotic action scenes that might give you a seizure, and lots of unintentionally hilarious moments (usually the ones in slow-motion). I have to admit, the eyeless jagged-toothed vampires ARE a bit cool.But even a good director couldn't have made this mess anything but mediocre. There's barely a plot, lots of predictable ""twists,"" huge plot holes, and only some vague attempts at backstory. Everything feels like it was lazily slapped together without much thought, and Stewart just rushes on through as quickly as he can.Paul Bettany's character is as wooden as a plywood cross, and he's never really given any backstory or development to make us like him. He just drifts around in a quasi-religious, stone-faced haze of mild boredom. Gigandet is... okay; Maggie Q is pretty awesome as the buttkicking warrior Priestess, although I never understood why she was helping Bettany.As for Black Hat... aw, Karl Urban, why do you do this to me? I really like you, but you keep starring in horrible, horrible movies! In this one, Urban is basically a bad guy who doesn't even need a NAME -- he's just the Villain In The Black Hat who talks in a villainous whisper.""Priest"" is apparently this year's dark fantasy/horror/sci-fi stinker -- a clumsy, tedious mess cobbled together out of better movies.

1357340,"Last year I saw ""Paranormal Activity"" on my birthday so I was all excited to do the same thing again this year. I saw ""Paranormal Activity 2"" yesterday again on my birthday, but I certainly am glad that I only paid college movie theater prices ($5). I'd have been really annoyed if I paid beaucoup bucks to see the sequel. ""Paranormal Activity"" was creepy and exciting and weird. This movie included the lady in the last movie with her sister, and it talked about the connection between the siblings and what was going on outside of her home. The difference with the sequel is that there was a baby, a German Shepherd, a married couple, a teenage girl, a babysitter/maid and the teenage girl's boyfriend involved.My initial thought was, ""The first movie was so creepy because they had to depend on each other and there was no one to turn to."" This movie seemed to have too many people, but when the babysitter/maid was kicked out and the boyfriend wasn't constantly around, I thought, ""Okay, well, they're slowly filtering people out."" The keyword here is ""slowly."" This movie was entirely too slow. I could've sworn I saw night #19 two times, but why on Earth did it take so long to get to the action? I'm almost positive it was a good 40 minutes into the movie before viewers saw anything remotely scary or even exciting. I got so tired of looking at that dumb pool and the countertop. Enough! I wanted to be scared, and this movie was not fulfilling my paranoia request.Another problem I had--that any dog owner should, especially a German Shepherd owner of which I've lived with two--was that the dog was so relaxed when noises were heard. The teenage girl and the wife would go running downstairs anytime they heard anything, but the dog would stay in place. It wasn't like they told the dog to ""Stay."" The dog just wasn't around. She was in the baby's room just sleeping like she had a sedative. Dogs don't operate like this. If I stand up to go wash my hands, both dogs I've lived with are almost knocking me in the hip to get to the sink first. Even the most well-trained dog, especially German Shepherds who are naturally inquisitive and incredibly protective, will hear the noises LONG before a human would and will investigate.

346598,"Could this video possibly be worse?  I am new to this sport butold hand at exercise videos, and this has almost nothing right withit.  From the opening shots of Stephanie romping in the ocean with her family, it's a loser.  She is literally whispering the instructions in the warm up, kind of under her breath.  I wonder if they inadvertently released one of her warmup rehearsals because she is mostly talking to herself here--certainly not to motivate her audience.  The music has no discernible beat, but rather is a sort of 70's style sax and drum-riff background, which couldn't be more boring.  (If you watch carefully, she actually looks bored herself about 20 minutes into it.) She doesn't seem to understand the nature of working out to a video. If you mirror her pose to follow along, you will have to turn your head to see the screen, which of course is the wrong stance--she could at least have split the screen so you can see the proper stance, but mimic her straight on, eyes front.  With no beat to go by, it's difficult to follow along at her pace anyway, and you're best off getting the combination she wants down and using your own music!  She should pull this video from the market, since I will never use any of her videos, based on this one--although perhaps she really shines at something less dynamic than kickboxing.

1632188,"Normally I'm the sort of nitwit to instantly dismiss a film I don't dig and quickly move on to something better but occasionally a movie will come down the chute that is so ghastly that I get bloody bleeding burned to bits and feel impelled to put index finger to keyboard. The Counselor is one such piece of cinematic claptrap and let me state right up front what I reckon is the one and only thing wrong with this turgid turkey: the writing. God's Holy Trousers but Cormac McCarthy is about as clueless about screenwriting as Charlie Rose is about everything. Besides Fassbender's title character, who just keeps muttering ""Jesus"" every five minutes in startlingly fake mental distress, the ceaseless catalogue of bite-sized profundities spouted by nearly every other character makes The Counselor sound like a dubbed into English version of one of those unspeakable French movies from the 60s written and directed by some self-appointed intellectual knob--Godard at his most obnoxiously supercilious springs easily to mind. ""The truth has no temperature"" intones a laughably unsinister Cameron Diaz. ""Gimme a farking break"" I intone right back at the screen. Then this doozy oozes to the surface, courtesy of a clearly embarrassed Bruno Ganz, a diamond dealer: ""To partake of the stone's endless destiny, is that not the meaning of adornment? To enhance the beauty of the beloved is to acknowledge both her frailty and the nobility of that frailty. At our noblest, we announce to the darkness that we will not be diminished by the brevity of our lives."" At this point I was frantically looking about for someone to shoot me. But this preposterous film just kept rolling on interminably. And then what about the countless cack-brained observations about women? Here's one of Javier Bardem's unintentionally hilarious pronouncements: ""Men are attracted to flawed women too of course, but their illusion is that they can fix them. They just want to be entertained. The truth about women is that you can do anything to them except bore them."" Well said, Javier, but did you know that the truth about you in this film is that you look silly in that hair and decidedly uncomfortable to boot? In fact if good actors of the calibre of Fassbender, Bardem, Pitt and Cruz can be made to look like total amateurs, made to seem so incredibly ill at ease, then the lines they have to deliver must be very bad indeed. I've read nearly all of McCarthy's novels but stopped admiring them when he started pandering to the masses with the less-than-stellar Border Trilogy--everything after these three went further downhill as far as I was concerned, not necessarily bad writing, just sort of lacklustre and ho hum. But this first foray in film is most definitely bad writing, comically and cringe-inducingly bad, and I just guess I am astonished that this dude could cook up this crap and think it worth anybody's time. Ridley Scott also resembles McCarthy in my estimation in that he too started out with a few humdingers but somewhere round about the time of Gladiator started to lose his considerable movie mojo. At any rate these two old geezers should have known better than to punish the public with this putrid picture. To accentuate the one star rating above I will add my own personal rating for tripe of this magnitude: Eleven thumbs down.",The Counselor

799146,"Having given the theatrical release of this movie 1 star, after viewing the DVD I can not say that my impressions have changed that much. In fact I can now clearly see why I did not like Revolutions and why many others did not like it either. The central problem with Revolutions is that bit-part actors and actresses are given leading roles that are immensely time consuming. So much so that everyone who made the first Matrix so good have literally been given a backseat to Niobi's driving skills or a token Kid that saves the day. Forget Morpheus's slick philosophical statements while dressed in black. Here he just wears a woolly jumper and sits around wondering just what is going on. Imagine if Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Lea where replaced at the end of the trilogy with Jabba the Hut, a Jawa, a Storm Trooper and an Ewok made the central focus characters? Would you like that? Well this is EXACTLY what Revolutions does! Zion is really what has gone wrong here. By expanding the depth of the Matrix story the filmmakers have missed the mark of what made the first Matrix so good and this is a problem for the audience. In short, and for all intensive purposes, Revolutions does not resemble the original movie in any way shape or form. In fact the only thing that Revolutions has in common with the original film is the characters. Now we have been introduced to a battle between the machines and Zion - in an environment where Neo will not be found... or Morpheus ... or Trinity... or Agent Smith. This battle sequence is the BIGGEST part of the film. So for thirty odd minutes or so you will certainly NOT be watching any form of the Matrix... but heck this was never about the Matrix in the first place. Reloaded and Revolutions where designed to move between plot banality and theme-park type experiences WITHOUT the metaphysical `thought' and `dialogue' that made the original Matrix what it was. You are paying to see a empty spectacle - nothing more, nothing less.Those who have done their homework will realize that the filmmakers have forgotten a lot and provided us with simple excuses so that they can bring on the next big special effects scene. Like I said already NEW CHARACTERS are introduced that serve very little function and are forgotten about just as quick. The Trainman appears as an important character and then... disappears. His whole scene at the start of the movie with Neo served absolutely NO PURPOSE. The Architect materializes briefly at the end for a few lines to try and consolidate everything. Persephone is back again with the Merovingian as if nothing is wrong after her releasing the Keymaker in Reloaded. The Twins who disappeared in Reloaded are obviously vaporized, because they are not here. What happens to Seraph? What happened to the Merovingian? They are here in Revolutions but don't expect they actually play an important role in much because whatever they say or do means nothing by the time the end credits role and here is also another problem. The ENDING of the original Matrix is so much better than Revolutions that the sequels seem pointless. But there we really have summed it up. This is a money making high budget sci-fi movie, end of story. People are going to watch it so why not experiment? Sadly that experiment does not pay off simply because it breaks too many rules... rules that the original Matrix created for us. The original Matrix was a high like no other. Reloaded was satisfactory and at least had some knockout action sequences with elements that where in the first Matrix and a few extra scenes here and there to help develop the story around Zion. Okay so the dance scene at the start was totally out of place but in Reloaded as soon as Neo met the Oracle it was the Matrix rocking like you mother from start to finish. Revolutions is NOTHING like Reloaded.Like we said questions that where created in Reloaded are left unanswered. What is it with the Indian family who take up almost fifteen minutes talking at the start of the film? The copout for replacing the Oracle with a new actress is explained in the worst possible way..... AND WHOEVER WROTE THE SCREENPLAY DIALOGUE SHOULD HAVE HIS PAYCHECK REVOKED! What a cliche driven script! You will not believe the stereotype dialogue on display here! Watch Neo stand for a few minutes in stupidity as Bane, who sounds, talks and moves just like Agent Smith, almost has to tell Neo who he is before the penny drops with our savior character! Bill and Ted where on the screen for a few moments there. Sssshesshhh.....The bottom line here is that this film is a disaster. Even if it where like Reloaded it would have been an acceptable movie but it seems almost like some sort of Direct to Video type release on a big budget. It is very hard to describe what an utter disappointment this film was. It could possibly be one of worst mega-budget pictures ever made. Fans will feel downright conned. Those who are looking for popcorn fodder will probably find it okay-ish entertainment but if we wanted to watch okay-ish entertainment we would hope to find that somewhere else other than in one of the most expensive sci-fi films ever made!!!!! Thank God that the Lord of the Rings is there to redeem our faith in high-concept large budget fantasy films. Revolutions is a bad stain on the Matrix series - if not trilogies as a whole.

265876,"I've come to understand the ratings system here and have learned to exclude them in future deliberations. There is always a vocal minority who are most passionate about a given subject and extol on it's perceived virtues. The reviews for this movie reflect this. I don't know why those folks were so smitten by this film.The visual curiosity of having different hued settings was clever enough but lost it's appeal as the movie dragged on. The inevitable isolation and demise of the villain was predictable and formulaic. The story offered no novel insights or revelations about human debauchery. The heroine was rather unsympathetic and vacuous, the lover shallow and the cook was merely another background set piece.There are many who might object to the content and consider it base and vulgar, though I take no issue with that. I have no problem with artistic expression in all of it's forms. My primary critique is the pervading since of arrogance on the part of the director who presumes this to be a work of genius. If a heavy handed jackhammer can be considered art, than so too can this movie. Helen MIrren is a very versatile actress and she did her naked best to make this movie work.

891240,"I think it was morbid curiosity that made me want to see this.  After all, it had a fairly great cast, interesting choices, some raised an eyebrow (*ahem* Tara Reid and Edward Furlong... could they sober up for this?) and of course, the whole plot of another crow, another storyline based on the crow.  Since I liked the first, the second was bad, the third not-so-bad I had to watch this.  Plus, it was just held back from being released so long, (that's always a dead giveaway) I just knew this was a trainwreck waiting to be watched but wanted to give it a chance.  Oh, I was wrong.  I'm an optimist usually; I like to see the best in things but this was just bad.Whelp, we have another crow story.  This time, out in the desert and playing off the whole Native American aspect.  The film starts kind of artsy and has a ""Pulp Fiction"" feel to it and moves a bit slowly but not bad.  Little bit of corn here and there but tolerable.  The first act:  not bad.The movie was based on one of the Crow graphic novel series that continued after James O'Barr's original.  So basically the plot wasn't pulled out of some Hollywood writer's butt, it was adapted.  Furlong is a down-and-out social outcast who is simply in love with the sweetheart of the town.  Think of Romeo and Juliet.Enter the four horsemen of the apocalypse.  Yeah, it's kind of cheesy that they all have those names, but in the first they were just as cheesy (Fun Boy, anyone?)  Alright, let that slide.  They're out to get revenge on... I think it was the fact a coal mine is being shut down by the reservation to put up a casino.... yeah, the plot is that confusing.  But Luc is going to invoke the power of Satan and become immortal.  To do this, they need specific sacrifices, hence, Furlong and his sweetie will do!The second act is where is starts to become a mess.  Character development is let go completely to introduce a plot that is so messy and confusing that you start to become lost. It borrows too much from the original storyline to really have legs of it's own to stand on and you think: ""Oh yeah, this is going to happen.""  Even that is tolerable until you listen to the wise cracking delivery and start to cringe.Third act falls flat on it's face.  First off, the bloopers are completely visible (which I can't reveal due to spoilers if you actually want to watch it) and the plot stutters around as if it's completely mental.  The end is so cheesy you could spread it on a Ritz cracker.  Boreanez is SO annoying towards the end that it really is painful to watch.  The direction and writing are completely to blame at this part and it's unfortunate because it does seem as if the actors really are trying.Edward Furlong was an interesting choice.  Considering he was an excellent actor in the past and now is more famous for looking puffy-eyed and drugged up in tabloids, I wondered how he'd fare in this role.  He seemed to give it all he had but held back only slightly for whatever reason he chose to.  I get the impression in the first love scene that Emmanuelle Chriqui was disgusted by him because he has his arms around her and she actually seems like she's cringing away from him for some reason.  I think he was just too young to play this role.Tara Reid, dare I say it, wasn't that bad.  She seemed alright in her role of evil mole and her display of emotions was pretty good.  Considering I think she's an idiot, I was surprised she was pretty good.David Boreanez was disappointing.  If you've ever seen Angel, then you know he was playing ""Angelis"" in the role; Wise-cracking to the point of annoying, ridiculous and cheesy, his smart alec comments start alright and then get downright embarrasing.Considering Tara and David didn't even attend the premiere of this flick, I think even they knew it was going to be bad.This is a total trainwreck - not a watchable one either.  It's got that ""Star Wars Holiday Special"" feel to it; You either cringe or start fast-forwarding through it.My recommendation: die hard fans who've tolerated the sequels MAY enjoy a new storyline but will be heavily disappointed by the deliverance of this one.

I will try. Imagine the excrutiating boredom of watching a small group of amateurish actors wander aimlessly in the woods for at least 90 minutes, uttering trite phrases. Those familiar with one of the most famous worst-movies-of-all-time, Robot Monster, will fondly recall cave scenes in which some joker (aptly named Ro-Man) wearing a moth-eaten gorilla suit and a diving helmet on his head menaced a diminishing group of clueless actors. It couldn't get worse than this, could it? Well, how about substituting stock footage of a growling grizzly bear as your scary monster, instead of good old Ro-Man? No one could possibly be this silly, you would reply. And I would have agreed, until I witnessed the nightmare that is Savage Planet.This movie is an utter, abject failure, and the scope of its failure boggles the mind. Indeed, one of the tag phrases offered by Amazon at the bottom of the review page for this movie is ""crappy sci-fi"". Amen.Whenever confronted by a truly execrable production such as this, my common sense tells me that everyone involved must, at some time, have realized that they were participating in something totally devoid of any artistic merit...something really, really awful.

The only thing they succeeded in doing is being intentionally idiotic.Some might refer to this movie as a quirky gem.  Others might say it's so bad, it's good.  I can appreciate the imaginative efforts, but there's no other way around it--this is just plain dumb.It shambles along from the beginning in conventional zombie fashion--the undead causing mass hysteria in some Japanese city (I can't remember which one).  We get to witness a couple of rumblin' bumblin' stumblin' buddies struggle for survial.  The two sorta meet an annoying, foul-mouthed chick and decide to kidnap her.  Soon after catastrophe strikes.This leads to a major plot twist, which inevitably shifts the overall tone.  It goes from human survival mode to an unorthodox bourgegois clymphamatic social equalitarium rebuttal of psychological transferrance with a sole intent of entertaining the masses in a predominantly preordained aristocratic influx of societal reformation.  Basically what I mean is, it gets stupid trying to act smart.Lots of social commentary imbedded here in obvious fashion.  That's all well and good I suppose, except the film had too many other problems.  For one, the dialogue was atrocious...""Oh shutup! You sooo retarded!""Everybody got on my nerves.  I was begging for Long Duck to make an appearance and say something clever like ""No more hanky my wanky...the Donger need food!"".  No such luck.  The acting was intentionally over-the-top, and makes for a tiresome flick.This all would be easily forgiven if this movie had some freakin' action!  Please, some blood!  Gore!  Nudity!  Some hint of apocalyptic foreboding doom!  Anything!  Bad makeup and cheap effects are all the more noticeable when you don't spray the screen with some red stuff.  Sheesh!I don't know, maybe they were going for a silly PG-rated comedy with loads of social commentary that's disguised as a zombie film.  Was this a cure for insomnia, perhaps?  Or maybe this was aimed at comic book nerds with absolutely no life.  I'm not sure.  Either way, you will definitely appreciate life a little more once this movie is over.",N/A

(They only recieved American assistance when they were out of power and a small part of an ad hoc group of armed bands harassing the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia; during their oft-denied - by anti-war leftists like Noam Chomsky - autogenocide of millions of their own citizens, the Khmer Rouge were squarely in the communist bloc.)

Since he died the studio has apparently lost the whole idea of telling a real story, having characters you care about, and nothing too scary or controversial.  I must admit that there were some missteps in his day (Alice in Wonderland springs to mind) but even his missteps were pretty good.  This mess has absolutely NO redeeming qualities.

There are plenty of scenes and attempted scares that really have no place in the movie, (like the hot tub and the fence; you will know what I mean if you see the film.)  Worse still, since this was apparently shot on video, the picture quality is lousy, and the camera reacts extremely poorly to back light - (as well as low light, and most other lighting situations for that matter).More frustrating still, is that despite the film's best efforts, it is not in the least bit frightening, save for one scene in the very beginning that made me jump.  That won't cut it, especially since being startled and being scared are two entirely different things.As for DVD extras, there is one extremely lousy behind the scenes of production, one interesting featurette behind the computer effects and image layering, a number of deleted scenes, and a trailer, and a one ore two other assorted extras.But since the film is this bad, the DVD extras should not determine whether or not you give it a rental.

1450599,"Disclaimer: I am a diehard Tolkien fan, and I loved the first three LOTR movies that Peter Jackson made, despite the mostly understandable changes he included.For all those who say that Jackson has made a new version of The Hobbit that we can now appreciate alongside the book, shut the heck up. The amount this story was changed to make a &#8220;new version&#8221; of The Hobbit for people to like is equivalent to fan fiction at best and horrific corruption of the story at worst. It&#8217;s as if I wanted to tell a story about the Vietnam war, but Hitler is still alive and there is a foreshadowing 9/11 with not-so-subtle rumors of Bin Laden every 15 minutes. There is not a single significant event in this entire movie that didn&#8217;t have a big and unnecessary change from the book to the movie.Oh awful mistakes, how shall I enumerate thee? *SPOILER ALERT* Listed below are things the movie got wrong about adapting the story in the book to the big screen:The main orc should be dead before the journey began in the first movie; Legolas should not be there; Radagast should not be there; Tauriel should not be there (or anywhere, since her character doesn&#8217;t exist); Bilbo didn&#8217;t know about the Arkenstone beforehand; the dwarves were in the Elvish prison for at least a month before Biblo let them out (not just one day); Gandalf did not have any discoveries about Sauron like that in the movie, despite there being rumors of a necromancer and an encounter with him in the North (else Gandalf must have completely forgotten all about Sauron when he hung out with Bilbo later and didn&#8217;t wonder about the ring very much); the barrels with the dwarves in them had lids and straw and Bilbo rode on top (hence Bilbo&#8217;s nickname &#8220;Barrelrider&#8221;, not &#8220;Barrel-periphery&#8221; like in this movie); no dwarf was poisoned by an orc blade; there was no need to reference kingsfoil, as if PJ was remaking FoTR; there was no stupid dwarf smuggling situation with Bard at Lake Town; Beorn was a huge, muscular jolly man who only had milk and honey for food and whom they had to approach a few dwarves at a time, not some moping mountain man with a variety of food for everyone whose home they broke into until he transformed from a bear to said moping man; the dwarves did nothing with the spiders because they were drugged up on venom while Bilbo sang and killed all the spiders; there was only one black arrow and it was Bard&#8217;s; there was nothing magic about black arrows per se, the black arrow was simply Bard&#8217;s lucky arrow and he was boss with it; the dwarves were not such jerks to Bilbo by this point; Bilbo was sent in to spy concerning Smaug, not sent to retrieve the Arkenstone, of which he knew nothing; there were no orcs invading Lake Town; Bilbo was not such an idiot about taking off the ring when it would be advantageous to have it on (around a dragon, around spiders, etc); there was no dwarf plan to cover Smaug in molten gold (as if that would work, since he&#8217;s a freaking dragon and is immune to heat); the dwarves barely saw Smaug (if at all) before he was shot down at Lake TownAll these aside from the blatant overuse of CGI (sometimes really bad CGI), excess use of fight scenes (often ridiculous fight scenes) when no fighting occurred, the overwhelmingly obvious fact that Peter Jackson was making this into another LOTR movie (evidence for that is strewn throughout the movie), and the completely wrong tone of the movie for the story&#8230; all these force me to give this awful adaptation of a beloved story 1 star. I&#8217;d give it a 0 if it let me, but perhaps the good actors acting with a wretched script is worth 1 star. Shame on you, Peter Jackson, for ruining this story.

1009258,"Two things caused me to give this film a rental: the comparisons to ""Suspiria"" and Bruce Campbell. Combining these two elements, this movie should have been a no-brainer. Most modern horror movies lack the sense of tension of the movies of the 80's and before. For example, ""Halloween"" is pretty tame in the gore department but the atmosphere, camera work and music combine to give the viewer the feeling of ""What's going to happen next?"" throughout. I can't think of one modern horror movie; aside from ""High Tension"", that creates that same sense of dread.Well, you can toss ""The Woods"" into the ""Nice Try"" pile with the likes of other modern pseudo-horror like ""Hostel"". The premise is moderately similar to ""Suspiria"" in that both movies include witches and a school surrounded by woods but there is where the similarities end abruptly. The set pieces themselves are moderately good to a point but the way this film is lit, it is hardly intimidating at all. It reminds me of Hogwarts. Sadly, the girls in this school are able to scare the viewer in the same way Harry Potter might, which is to say that if you are 6 years old and Harry Potter movies cause you to leap from your seat, ""The Woods"" might be up your alley if you are seeking a good scare.With that said, the plot or story really unimportant. Basically, the school is run by witches and the woods surrounding the school are haunted by three witches from the 1800's. This might be somewhat effective if the witches in the school were a little creepier than the ones we are given but again, the intimidation factor is on par here with that of some cheesy Halloween made-for-TV movie on ABC Family Channel. The death knell for me (aside from the snail's pace  at which this movie plods along) was the main antagonist -- the woods themselves. The trees come to life and claim victims inside the school, specifically the one that sleeps in the bed at the end near the window. Game over.Nope, not even Bruce Campbell could save this movie from being an overhyped letdown. In addition, Lucky McKee's entry in the Masters Of Horror series ""Sick Girl"" was also only moderately interesting in premise only. The actual episode was hampered by poor acting by the lead actress and a complete lack of horror sensibility. So, if you truly must see ""The Woods"", give it a rental first and then decide if a purchase is absolutely necessary. For my money, I'll just watch ""Suspiria"" instead, as it blows this movie out of the water.",N/A

Eighty minutes of endless, repetitive, boring chase-and-crash scenes occasionally interspersed with pieces of the 10 minutes of actual story.If you like close-ups of Ethan Hawke's left foot stomping the clutch, followed immediately by close-ups of his right hand shifting gears, you'll be in Hog Heaven. Because you get to relive that particular moment of cinematic history about a hundred times.This is like a video game... except you're only watching while SOMEONE ELSE is actually playing it.Apparently the cops in Sofia, Bulgaria -- where the flick takes place -- drive Beemer cop cars. Well, first of all, the cops in Sofia are apparently set loose on the streets without one minute of actual driver training, if this idiotic movie is to be believed. And BMW must have had a record sales year, judging by the number of their products that crashed, burned, exploded, ran off bridges, plowed into rivers, hit other cars and trucks, and were otherwise completely destroyed.This has to be one of the stupidest movies made this year, if not in history.Um... needless to say, I'm not recommending it.",Getaway (2013) (Blu-ray)

1021687,"The fact that this is a DVD-R means very little.I'm not the type that complains simply because a disc is DVD-R instead of a 'pressed' disc. Many films would never be available at all if we had to wait for pressed editions. DVD-Rs allow many publishers to offer deep-library titles in small quantites, to collectors and film buffs (like me).Some publishers (such as Warner Archive, Sinister Cinema, etc.) offer excellent quality DVD-Rs, and I am happy to own, and watch, many from those particular sources....However, This disc does NOT fall into that category. The quality of the source print used for ""The Lost Volcano"" is very, very poor. Any publisher worth a darn could have found a better print to use-- but not these folks.I have a VHS-cassette of this 'Bomba' film that I copied from cable-TV back in the late 1990's.That VHS copy of mine is miles ahead of this in clarity, resolution, and overall ""watch-ability""....This appears to be a copy of a copy of a copy (..you get the point) of a bad copy tape.The resolution is so bad that you can actually count the pixel-lines on your TV screen.

I'm sure you would answer yes, so that begs the question, what is the purpose of splitting 'Pearl Harbor' onto 2 DVD's?  It is stupid if you ask me.  That is the only reason why I gave this 1 star rather than 3.The movie itself was ok.  The special effects were good, but you could tell that they were special effects, and that always detracts from my enjoyment of a film.  I thought the story was really two movies in one, a love story and a war story.  Each one would have been great on its own, but mixed together they just make for a long movie.  I also thought that Ben Affleck was not that good, and over acted for most if not all of the film.I would not suggest buying this DVD because the film is split onto two disks, and the movie was not that great.

Hollywood has yet again bought the rights to the name and even some of the characters of the original series and then totally trashed it.  This movie couldn't decide whether it was a comedy, slap-stick, gothic or horror, so it tries to be everything and fails miserably.  The original series, on-camera bloopers and all, had good actors doing their best with some hauntingly sad storylines; all this remake has is great CGI and wonderful sound - with lines that aren't worth hearing.

454309,"The first three ""Subspecies"" movies had their good points and bad points, but overall they were entertaining little vampire movies.Not so with ""Subspecies IV: Bloodstorm.""This is one of those movie sequels that does absolutely EVERYTHING wrong. Nothing about this story actually goes right, from Radu's makeup to continuity to the inclusion of new characters who are ABSOLUTELY POINTLESS. And what character development the main characters have experienced is literally tossed out the window within the first few minutes.Having been burned alive and impaled on a tree, Radu (Anders Hove) falls into a convenient pond, which extinguishes him enough that he can creep back into a crypt. Meanwhile, Becky and her compatriots get into a fatal car accident mere seconds into the film, and everyone dies except Michelle (Denise Duff). Yay. At least Michelle survived. Because I like her character so much.Michelle is rescued by a passing doctor, who takes her to the clinic of the crazy-eyed Dr. Nicolescu (Mihai Dinvale) WHO IS SO OBVIOUSLY A VAMPIRE. He recognizes Michelle's condition, and promises to cure her -- but he's especially interested in getting the Bloodstone. And Radu returns to Bucharest, taking over the holdings of his other fledgling, the refined and elegant Ash (Jonathon Morris) -- who also has plans to get rid of Radu.""Bloodstorm"" does everything wrong -- continuity, makeup (Radu now looks like a paper-mache witch),  pseudoscience, characterization, vampire lore, and the fact that all the established characters EXCEPT the ever-useless Michelle die ignominious, worthless deaths less than a minute into the story. There is nothing RIGHT about this movie.Instead, most of the movie consists of Michelle lying around whining, Dr. Nicolescu making crazy eyes, and Ash making vague ""we should totally kill Radu, but for some reason we're not allowed to"" speeches. Occasionally something happens that seems like it should be significant (such as Dr. Nicolescu's trap for Radu), but it usually ends up being pointless. There's even a subplot about Inspector Marin becoming a comedy-relief vampire... and dying without having made any real impact on the plot.And remember all that character development that Radu had in the previous movie, when he was starting to show regret and love? Well, forget about that, because he's now a 2-D baddie who now wants to live the high life in the big city. And Michelle is worse than useless -- when she isn't just lying around crying and whining, she's ACTIVELY saving Radu's life... because she wants to be free of him. STUPID.The new characters have some potential, even if Dr. Nicolescu's buggy eyes will haunt my nightmares. Ash is the refined, gentlemanly vampire that Radu is not, and Dr. Nicolescu has found a substance that allows him to walk in the daylight. But neither of these characters really get fleshed out adequately -- Ash in particular contributes ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to the story.""Subspecies IV: Bloodstorm"" is one of the worst sequels I have ever subjected myself to -- this is the vampire version of ""Troll 2.""",N/A

They take shots at the 80's and all of the big guys, and that is just plain stupid! If it were not for Hulk Hogan WWE would not be here today. Bret even makes the claim that back in the 80's kids would go home talking about his tag matches instead of the matches Hogan and the other big guys would be in.This DVD makes me sick! Bret even called Hulk Hogan boring! That made me laugh because I have heard a lot of people bash Hogan but calling a man who got the biggest pop from the crowd almost every event he was at back in his wrestling days boring is a pretty stupid comment.

Edward Norton has done nothing but commit career suicide since &quot;Fight Club&quot; and &quot;American History X.&quot;  Robin Williams' career ended after &quot;The Fisher King.&quot;  He hasn't been funny in quite some time either.

13726,"I have loved this movie since I was a teenager. As far as Edwardian-set period films go, this is definitely one of the all time best. That's why it breaks my heart that after months of anticipating owning this film in high definition, the final product that I received is of extremely poor quality to say the least.Unfortunately, it appears that there is a major issue with either the way this disc is being pressed over at Criterion or the way the HD master is being transferred onto the Blu-ray. The picture on my copy is FILLED with digital noise and snow. It's not just a mild amount that might have proved mildly distracting, but a thick layer of white grain that looks as if I'm peering through a blizzard.I logged on to amazon earlier today to see if anyone else was having this same issue and sure enough, others are reporting the same problem on varying levels. The issue is definitely not with my player. I have a magnificent Oppo BDP-83 which always delivers the finest High Definition picture possible on my new Samsung LCD.

873636,"I can understand when someone likes a film for reasons others may hate it, and sometimes acting, mood, lighting, sound, and direction all make a huge effect on someone's opinion of something. I believe anything could be better than this 'film', even cutting myself to pieces and filming it would be more fun than this crap!Danny Glover stars in this. I had to check the main Amazon page to verify that sense I don't own this crap. Isn't that a shock in the rubber parts??!! To think at one time he was doing such GREAT work in classics like ""The Color Purple"" to sink to doing this. Wow, what a downfall!! I think Danny Glover needed the money. I was embarrassed for him! And, I thought he was embarrassing in ""Gone Fishin"", but this is the bottom of the barrel. This is unwatchable garbage.Yes, this is simply nothing more than mind rot at its most blatant! There is no plot, no psychology, no suspense, just gore-gore-gore-and MORE gore just for the sake of showing gore. And to think this film not only is a 'hit', but it has spawned sequels. Now, that to me is psychologically frightening, a lot more scarier than this film (or its sequels) could ever dare to be. If I wanna see someone being tortured, I'll visit youtube and watch some Iraq footage or something, but I really don't prefer to view someone being tortured just for shock value.This isn't 'horror', nor is it a 'film', but disgusting pieces of footage combined together to whet a poor filmmaker's egotistical fetishes and air them in public for all to see; and, what vile carnal garbage this is, at that. Bilge like this should be flushed down the toilet, along with the people who made it. I couldn't sit through more than 20 minutes of this crap. It isn't merely disgusting, it's PRETENTIOUS JUNK that's pretending to be ""art"", when in reality it has NOTHING to say or add to the world...except maybe provide viewing pleasure for people who get off on watching torture. And THAT'S scary. We've sunk pretty low. These are some sorry individuals who made this!The scariest thing is indeed the fact that so many people love this crap. Some are starting to call it ""torture porn"", meaning that it's pornography for people who love violence, not sex. I think that's an apt description.These movies are inhuman. People, mostly kids and young adults, are paying good money to enjoy watching inhuman acts. Society is becoming like ""Lord of the Flies"". And the people who are the sickest are the least likely to see it in themselves, apparently.I advise anyone with any common sense of decency to stay as far away from these trash 'snuff-porn for dummies' films as possible. They are a plague on our country, and people are sitting in theaters eating them up as they are eating their popcorn and being told 'this is ok to watch', brainwashed like mindless sheep. Treat this crap like AIDS or Typhoid Mary, for it is liken to a very scary virus that's overtaking theaters in place of what used to be great cinema.I read someone reviewing ""Hostel part 2"" saying that Hitchcock would love it. HUH??? REALLY???! What drugs are these people on to even remotely try to compare this garbage to anything Hitchcock???! He wouldn't even watch such crap, let alone applaud it. And the same goes for Jonathan Demme (the director of the classic ""Silence of the Lambs"", another film these 'fans' are comparing this crap to).Don't get me wrong, for I believe everybody has the right to form their own opinion, but these type of films were hidden from sight and considered illegal just 20 years ago, and now they are being paraded from theater to theater with pride. What the h*ll happened to our society???If I wanna see someone digging in a toilet, I will watch a plumber working, that would be more entertaining than this trash any day.And, since I prefer my horror films to be psychological, I will steer as far from this as Humanly possible, and I advise the same for any other intelligent/intellectual film goer out there.

435865,"Viewed: 12/10Rate: 112/10: Noticing the amount of secondhand smoke going on throughout She's So Ugly, it's safe to surmise that everybody involved had lost ten years of their lives doing the film. I hadn't seen acting this so unbelievably bad from a cast that contained two major stars, and I don't even think that Robin Wright Penn has been so comparatively bad as other films I've seen involving a female lead with the notable exceptions of Julianne Moore, Sandra Bullock, Nicole Kidman, etc. On the whole, the entirety of She's So Ugly cast has been straight F turkey. It was hard to sit through the movie because I was literally watching a train wreck, and it was also difficult to keep my eyes on the screen. That was so painfully bad that I had to keep noticing that nasty, hideous bump on Harry Dean Stanton's forehead. He and Debi Mazar have to consider retirement from acting because they plain stunk. As for Sean Penn, can there be the most overrated actor alive? She's So Ugly marked the umpteenth time that he broke down crying and feeling sorry for himself in a film. How many times had this been done before? And how many times must this phoniness continue? I am tired of him. Then, there is John Travolta; at the point of him showing up, I had hoped that he would alleviate the pain of the film for me. But nope, he started to stunk it up with the obnoxiousness of his behavior. Speaking of illegal behavior, I couldn't believe that Robin Wright Penn's character was poisoning her fetus with alcohol, smoking, and assumed drug use. Then, I get insulted in the meanwhile that the daughter turned out to be fine. Uh uh...never happens in real life. That was supposed to be a child with a full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Now, honestly...why would anyone, especially somebody with money, to pick up a woman from the gutters who is all beaten up, drugged up, and totally out of it in her mind? That never happens either. Of Sean Penn's character, after ten years in the institution, that's how much he changed? Yeah right...we need more realism here. Some critics have said that this movie is funny. Hm, I don't see it. Finally, I decided that I've had enough and declared She's So Ugly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Without a question, She's So Ugly is beyond bad.",She's So Lovely VHS

1291785,"**This review contains spoilers**The message this movie spreads is that an affair is a terrific ego boost if you're feeling lonely, and justified if the betrayed spouse is a cheater, too.  There's some minor heartbreak, but overall, everything works to your benefit.Jane (Meryl Streep) cheats with her married, ex-husband Jake (Alec Baldwin), and they both feel refreshed about it.Her therapist gives the ok as well, saying the affair will be a great learning tool for her.Her friends also cheer her on, saying she's ""allowed this one"" and assures her that Agnes, the woman Jake left her for, is the one to hate.However, it's hypocritical of them to hate Agnes for her greedy behavior but then encourage Jane to engage in the same greedy behavior.  Being cheated on first doesn't mean two wrongs make a right.And if her friends hate Agnes, then they must hate Agnes's son, too, because his innocent life would also get turned upside down by the affair she's ""allowed"".Speaking of kids, neither Jane nor Jake consider how their affair might affect their kids' lives.  Instead they're too caught up believing that if something feels good, you should do it.  In the end, they even both agree they don't regret their affair.They shook up the lives of their innocent kids, an innocent son, and an innocent man who's heart got broken (Adam, played by Steve Martin) all over greed....and yet, if they could do it all over again, they would?Both Jane and Jake were too self-centered to offer real love to anyone.  Jake insists this affair reveals his undying love for Jane, but really, it's just an excuse to run away from adult responsibilities.  Jake is a narcissist who treats people like toys and when one toy breaks, he replaces it with another.In his first marriage, Jane was a good toy who took care of him.  However, she broke when kids came along and she had to split her attention with him.  He then replaced her with a new toy who adored him...but alas, that toy broke, too, when she had a son and her attention got split as well.So history repeats itself with Jake running off to another toy, Jane, who's waiting to be played with again.  She's more appealing now because with kids grown, she can pay more attention to him.  And just like before, instead of closing one relationship before opening another, he strings both toys along because they're both still useful.The kids are objects to Jake, too.  In one scene, he manipulates them with fake tears so they'll pressure Jane into letting him stay the night.  He says he misses the kids but that's only because all that's required of him is to eat dinner (that Jane prepared with him in mind) and watch tv on the couch.  If any adult problems emerged, he'd split in a second.Jane's character isn't any better...though she tries to redeem herself, saying if only she didn't feel so much guilt and fear, she'd lighten up about this affair.However, for like 90% of the movie, she's giggling and squealing with laughter.  Her conscience seemed pretty clear to me.Also, like Jake, she doesn't respect the boundaries of marriage.  She starts the affair because she wanted to experiment if something was still there with Jake.However, because Jake is married, she no longer had that right.  Despite what her friends said, she was NOT ""allowed this one"".I think this sentiment was just to make Jane seem deep, but she's not.  She told her friends that Jake was an ""ex with benefits"", so she was clearly looking for a fling to boost her ego.  No deeper meaning was intended.I would've given this movie 2 stars if Adam had left Jane like he originally planned.  He was a decent guy who was too good for Jane.Jane flaked on Adam twice...yet gets angry when Jake flakes on her once.And the only reason she invited Adam to her son's party was to make Jake jealous...and yet, she accuses Jake of only thinking of himself.In rom-coms, though, serious problems get neatly resolved, so Adam goes back to her.  It's a bad move, though.  Not only does he deserve better, but in the scene before, there's clearly unresolved feelings between Jane and Jake.So I could neither root for this couple like I was supposed to nor support the warped message that greed is good.",N/A
601885,"In BriefWhen Canadian Air Force pilot Jack Ferriman (Harrington) recruits the salvage crew aboard the tugboat Arctic Warrior to investigate a mysterious vessel he has spotted adrift in a remote region of the Bering Sea, they discover the remains of the fabled Antonia Graza.  Thought lost at sea for more than 40 years, once onboard the eerie cavernous ship, the crew discover that the decaying vessel is anything but deserted.  It's home to something more deadly and horrific than anything they've encountered in all their years at sea.ReviewThere is something knowing in this films charm.  Yes its decidedly corny, but as it opens with 1940&#65533;s period credits, one can&#65533;t help but think its always giving you a sly nudge and wink throughout.  Unlike other horror films, this doesn&#65533;t rely on over the top MTV editing but rather classic jumps and scares, building a solid if what somewhat flawed 90 minutes of entertainment.Opening with one the most original mass killings that I can recall, it is hilariously disgusting throughout.  And while, the story slows briefly to introduce everyone, it picks up apace and has beautifully depicted montage to Mudvayne&#65533;s latest song. Captain Sean Murphy (Byrne) is a slat weathered old hand, and lends the story some weight while team leader Maureen Epps (Margulies) and First Mate Greer (Washington) engage with the basic script aplomb.Hidden within this film, is a twist that will have you kicking yourself, and while the haunted house concept of Ghost Ship has yet to produce a classic, its filled with moments that bring it close.  The premise may be unoriginal but Ghost Ship is still worth a look, if only for a chance to laugh at an ending that is as knowing as it is ridiculous.The VerdictGhost Ship provides a fun night out; its not necessarily going to scare you ridged, but how many films really do that in our desensitised days?  It is gruesome, making me laugh on plenty of occasions, and with the talent on display here you have to conclude that they knew what they were creating.  The Sun would call it, &#65533;A fun filled thrill ride,&#65533; I&#65533;d call it &#65533;A hilariously disgusting B movie,&#65533; either way check it out!",N/A

As for the torture as only being a part of the film; no, at least two hours of the film is about torture, or people sitting around complaining that they have no intelligence because can&#8217;t torture anyone once the Obama administration comes to power.  I found it to be thoroughly pro-torture because all the Americans (i,e, -the sympathetic characters in the film) are pro-torture, or torturers themselves.  However the part that completely lost me was the last half hour, the raid that ended with the killing of bin Laden.  Most of the time the screen is black, with no picture, except for the occasional flashes of night vision; it&#8217;s like listening to a radio show, only the show doesn&#8217;t make any sense.  I suppose it&#8217;s supposed to be &#8220;realistic,&#8221; but it comes off as more &#8220;indie&#8221; &#8211; if the Navy Seals had vision like this during the raid it would have been a dismal failure and they would have run into each other like The Three Stooges.

649088,"The first half hour of Deja Vu is like being forced to watch overly melodramatic CNN/MSNBC news coverage of 9/11 or the tsunami.  Anyone who was alive during 9/11 has already had a lifetime overdose of news coverage of terrorist tragedy - I don't need a film to present the same.  The few shots that cut away from big band military music, flaming bodies and crying bystanders are straight from a bad, made-for-TV movie - Denzel gazing steely eyed at clues like grease smears under a bridge while mouthing soap opera'esque explanatory bomb specifics to the police.  And these few lines of awful dialogue only occur about half hour into the movie.  I'm serious, no one says a word for the first quarter of the film! Once again Hollywood cranks out another movie that lacks a plot or screenplay and has forgotten to be entertaining.  Not even the promise of staring at Denzel Washington for two hours could keep me awake.  The only entertaining moment is seeing Val Kilmer's beyond bloated face and neck appear on the screen and wondering how the neck of a 600 pound man could fit on the only marginally over weight Kilmer.  Bad Liposuction perhaps?  That's the only mystery worth pondering in Deja Vu.  Still lacking any semblance of a plot or more than five lines of dialogue, the movie starts showing close ups of burned and mutilated body parts, including severed children's hands.  Considering I was eating dinner, and not only bored but extremely irritated by the film at this point, I turned it off.  It was forty minutes into the film and they still hadn't gotten to anything to do with the manipulation of time - which was what sounded interesting about the movie to begin with.  While watching I kept thinking about how pathetic this era would seem to future historians looking back on the decade of ""terror"" - where every action film uses terrorists as the stock villain now replacing the Bolsheviks in the bathroom.  Deja Vu is not only dumb but out right pissed me off for trying so pathetically to manipulate emotions associated with the fear of terrorism.  The only thing I'm afraid of is how mainstream it has become to sell brainless propaganda as entertainment.",Deja Vu

Thus, the civil Court-house is the Bleak-house. We see the civil-lawyer-cartel is not interested in justice, but in making lots of money for themselves.

This intention of this movie is not to entertain, but to scare the viewer into becoming a Christian - or if you're already a Christian - stick to your faith, or else....

637856,"I realize Edgar Rice Burroughs' dopey King Kong story was written for  children & a young teen audience. I know it's supposed to be trite and two-dimensional! What I didn't expect was the blatant racism, the non-stop killing & gore, the pathological narcissism by one of the main characters, and the 1950's style monster movie drudgery, at the hands of an alleged genius, Mr. Jackson of Lord Of The Rings fame! I literally trusted that he would not pander to American society's lowest common denominator in order to make a buck.What a disappointment! I'd love to have been a fly on the wall when they did focus groups before making this movie. They must have impaneled a bunch of immature teenagers without any regard to either young children or grown-ups, which is a real shame!I was also a bit shocked by the disgusting racism shown towards a very dark skinned tribal community. It's now 2005, why were indigenous people portrayed as dangerous maniacs, and downright evil? This is a rather ugly stereotype the Western world has been carrying around for many centuries. To this very day, indigenous people are being run-off their land, or killed, because they stand in the way of the almighty dollar! Some situations are so extreme that organizations like Survival International from the United Kingdom, and Cultural Survival, out of Boston area, solely exist so this kind of mindless brutality will finally come to an end.This is a teachable moment. I hope Mr. Jackson makes amends for profiting off of a very White author's terribly misguided, and hateful, fantasies. Perhaps it's time to get Howard Zinn on the phone!The violence and gore caught me by surprise to the point it got rather tedious, and annoying! Besides being preposterous, for example, I don't care how strong a vine is, it's simply not going to hold onto a squirming, multiple ton dinosaur!  There was also a very disturbing message - that nature in its pristine wild state is, by design, an extremely dangerous place. Which, of course, needs to civilized by mostly White men!The attack of the giant cave bugs obviously reflects our childhood fears of the dark. But back in the real world most cave systems are occupied by some of the most unusually fragile endangered species on earth! Besides being fragile, they are blind, and totally harmless! How ironic! If this movie deters a single vandal from damaging an underground cave system, then hooray. But what most children, and plenty of older folks now will think is that caves are creepy, bad places instead of  biological treasure troves worthy of badly needed government protection!I could go on forever about why this film stinks.

The problem lies in the contrivances of the plot that makes not entirely credible connections between characters who might not otherwise meet. Another weakness is the way the characters spell everything out--no mystery here about how they feel because what they say out loud is all there is--no underlying mystery or nuance. By supposedly offering a take on the racist tendencies in all of us, the film manages to offer a number of racial stereotypes. A disappointing choice for best picture, a way for Hollywood to congratulate itself. I originally rated this film with 2 stars but now that it was awarded the Oscar, I have given it 1 star for being ludicrously overrated by the Academy.

The poor mite had to stay in character / keep returning to depressing ponnette for TWO years in order for us adults to be able to sit through the movie. Why? Because 5yr olds cannot act. Even 7 or 8yr oles are problematic. They can however play themselves and themes to do with childhood. See ""Lord of the Flies ""where the children fully understood the dynamics of bullying or they could choose a boy with an innate fascination for biology besides his film character. But 5yr old? Children are too ego-centric to get into another skin. No wonder she looks somber for real. This is the girl who grew up with a phobia for ponies? Did she smile when the directer said 'cut! ?Reaction to grief that age they cry and bury but it is surprising how elastic their minds are. With empathy from adults .Young kids live in the moment after all and death is not mental abuse. Show them a dead animal or story of a dead pet they can and do catch on. Why a film that dwells on possible immediate aftermath if father lacked empathy?But the dragged out maudelin process of this film is all about adults projecting their trips into small children. This is part of a new culture of child-rearing from mid 20th century where kids are babied and cossetted more and longer than they need be. Better for the kid? Not really but strangely cossetting for the parent. And so this infliction of grief on a ponette is absurdly self indulgent. At a pinch is it all about an adult softly chewing over the preciousness of their feelings than watching something in kid-land. Something the French at their worse may be more susceptible to do.Even the sound of spoken French lends itself to this indulgence. And somewhere in the extras of ""lord of the flies"" its noted the film never caught on in France because lack of cosseting and yet the children adapt without adults not sit on the beach bawling their eyes out till a rescue ship arrives.Ponette is both a baby and an adult. Too much of both qualities. Ditto oversentimental adults taking themselves far too seriously. Was it Oscar Wilde who said what kills art is over-earnestness?For example ,near start of film, seeing the same age little boy kiss and hug ponnette like a sexless teen Romeo or full fledged adult was the first sure bad omen and no I did not watch till the end.

466360,"NBC created a two-part epic of the story of Noah's Ark.  It was created by the team that did Merlin and Alice in Wonderland but will probably be remembered as being by the same people who did The Tempest.  It was really bad.Just how bad the show was can probably be summed up by saying that in one scene Noah greeted Lot.  For those a little rusty on their Old Testament, Noah can be found in Genesis chapter 6 while Lot is Genesis chapter 19.  This epic opened with the tale of Lot (minus Abraham) and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (also minus Abraham).One thing that really puzzled me about this production was the way the locals kept treating Noah as if he were a fool.  This puzzles me because the locals all knew that Noah had the only farm in the land where anything would grow.  So would frustrated and hungry farmers merely laugh at Noah or would they hate him and raid his farm?  I was also amused when some of the locals began quoting Shakespeare.  At another point a Michael Palin look-alike runs up dressed in rags and with a long scraggly beard and says, &quot;Its.&quot;  A brief moment of humor for Monty Python fans but I don't know why it was in there.But the writers of Noah's Ark did take from one good source, mainly the Broadway musical Two by Two starring Danny Kaye.  Unfortunately the stolen scene was one of Noah's sons claiming the Ark was not finished because it did not have a rudder.  Now if he were right and the Ark needed a rudder then God made a mistake.  But it would also meant that Noah's son would have to be strong enough to operate a rudder on a boat three-hundred cubits in length.  But the ark was built by God and not Noah.  The writers also kept pushing the idea that an ark is a boat.  No, but Noah's Ark took the form of a boat.  An ark is simply a sacred container for the safe storage of something precious.  Any fan of Indiana Jones knows that (or did he dig up a boat in Tannis?).This production is available on video and DVD and my recommendation is that it should be avoided.",Noah's Ark

Suffice it to say it's a common word starting with the letter C, something you see every day (ahem).At the beginning of ""My Favorite Year,"" the writing staff for King Kaiser's (Sid Caesar's) comedy show is reviewing the swashbuckling films of Alan Swan (Eroll Flynn), who's going to be the guest star that week. One of the writers (played by Bill Macy) is decidedly unimpressed. ""They're all [stuff].""""You don't like 'Captain from Tortuga'""? protests Benjy Stone (Mel Brooks). ""Captain from [Stuff]!"" is Macy's response.The same could be said about the TV output of William Hannah and Joseph Barbera. [Stuff]. Utter, total, unmitigated [stuff].Hannah and Barbera had a stellar career at MGM, where they produced a long series of ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoons, taking home the animated-short-subject Oscar for more than a decade. I don't much care for ""Tom and Jerry,"" but you can't deny these cartoons were beautifully drawn and animated. The first of the series, ""Mr. Cat Steps Out,"" is one of the best animated shorts ever made.The Supreme Court anti-trust decision that divested the major studios of their theaters removed the principal outlet for new cartoons. This, combined with the rising cost of animation after WWII, meant that by the early '50s, high-quality animated shorts were no longer economically viable.Not wanting to starve, Hannah and Barbera turned to television, where they were among to the first to produce cartoons using limited animation (ie, only a few cels per second; drawing only the part of the character that moved; heavy use of movement cycles).The first of these (IIRC), was ""Ruff and Reddy,"" an adventure series featuring a dog and a cat. It's an obvious lift of Jay Ward's ""Crusader Rabbit,"" and though it lacked the satirical thrust of the former, my memory is that it was occasionally amusing and sometimes charming. Everything after was [stuff]. Total [stuff].Starting with ""Huckleberry Hound,"" Hannah and Barbera churned out a huge pile of witless, humorless [stuff]. I'd go as far as to say that it is the _biggest_ pile of artistic [stuff] in the entire history of Western civilization. (I'm not joking.)""The Flintstones"" was the first prime-time animated series. That's its only legitimate distinction, as there's nothing else _worth_ saying about such a total mediocrity. The characters are lifted from ""The Honeymooners,"" and the plots are the same tired sitcom rehashes that were ancient when the series premiered.The idea that a series set in the Stone Age might be used to meaningfully comment on contemporary life doesn't seem to have crossed the writers' minds. Their idea of ""satire"" was such things as a Hollyrock actor named Cary Granite. Wow! Isn't that just side-splittingly hilarious? I can't stop laughing! How clever! How creative! How [stuff]y.""The Flinstones"" is contemporary with ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" and ""The Dick van Dyke Show."" Even by current standards, both are considered models of wit and solid comedy writing. ""The Flintstones"" isn't within even a couple of parsecs.If you want to see what ""The Flinstones"" _could_ have been, take a look at ""Dinosaurs."" (It's surprising Disney hasn't issued the better episodes on DVD. ""When Food Goes Bad"" is a classic.) Ditto -- cubed -- for ""The Jetsons"" and ""Futurama.""If I were Bill Gates, I'd buy the rights to all of Hannah and Barbera's TV ""creations,"" then publicly _burn_ every surviving negative, print, videotape, cel, and piece of artwork. They deserve no less.PS: What can you say about a theme song that invites the viewer to have ""a gay old time""? If there's one thing ""The Flintstones"" _isn't_, it's gay.

1403672,"Ok..........where to begin. This movie sucked. I'm sorry. Sometimes movies just suck. I heard Warner Bros spent Avatar money on this movie, marketing it as the big action adventure. Woah. Firstly, the Green Lantern is not even in the second tier of super heroes. He is so far down the chain among notables such as batman, spiderman and superman. I doubt most people even knew who this was. I knew who it was, but I never wanted to be green lantern for halloween. However, the trailers for it looked interesting enough and there was nothing out at the time. I saw it in theaters. I don't know what you get in the blu-ray version. It may not be worth it unless there is a free copy of spiderman 2 in there.Hal Jordan is cocky test pilot. For some reason, the lanterns choose him to be their next guardian. Apparently, the universe is full of green lanterns and they pick their members very carefully, but hall doesn't understand why they would pick him over everyone else. The usual super hero cliches begin. He gets powers. Learns them. Makes wise guy comments while doing so. Fights inner demons. Learn the ""real"" reason why he has been given these abilities. Fights a lame villain with a huge head. Fight another villain who is an escaped space monster. Fight said villain in large metropolitan area. Rescue a girl.What should be cool about this movie is that the Green Lantern can create stuff with his mind. A giant fist? Yes. Machine gun? Yes. Giant ramp resembling hot wheels? Yes....? This is where the movie really gets cheesy. In one scene, a helicopter, after launching from a helipad, quickly spins out of control endangering the people below. There is a party going on down below and no party is complete without helicopter launch pads. I dont know. Maybe I'm just a high roller. What does the Green Lantern do? He clips the wings which causes the helicopter to pummel to the ground. UH OH! Its going too fast and now its sliding on the ground? What does the Green Lantern do now? He makes a ramp out of thin air for the sliding machine to go onto. Yes....a ramp. In the effort to make this movie cool, no solution is ever practical or ground in common sense for the green lantern. Extravagance is on Hal's mind. Any number of things springs to mind here. What if I had these powers? I'm sure you thought you could either make giant arms and punch the thing away, build a wall to stop it, or blow it up with a canon (something he does use later in the movie). But none of this happens. The result is a weird mix of awkward action sequences that are not cool at all and look downright silly at BEST.Don't bother buying this seriously. Why spend 30 dollars on this????? Buy anything else instead.",Green Lantern

1028102,"Let me begin by saying that I was floored by Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" upon first viewing: the acting, the plot, and the originality in storytelling were exceptional.  I also enjoyed, to a lesser extent, ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs.""  ""The Village,"" however, was a bit of a disappointment.  While the cinematography and music were great, the atmosphere felt fake and the token surprise ending didn't deliver.  But even then, ""Lady in the Water"" makes that film look like ""Citizn Kane.""**Spoilers** I think what maddens me the most about this film is how the story unfolds as if it was being written while filming; as if Shyamalan was making it up as he went along.  Things like the little boy suddenly being able to see encrypted messages on cereal boxes, the man in the bathroom who supposedly has some part in the myth but whose part is never really explained or shown in action, the way Cleveland's emotional breakdown over his briefly mentioned murdered family somehow heals the nymph -- it's all so ridiculous.Furthermore, the myth itself coming from Korean ancestry is also ludicrous.  It would be more believable coming from, say, Norse mythology.  Not to mention, the Korean language, Hangul, doesn't even consist of sounds that are able to form words like ""narf"" and ""scrunt.""In short: As a made up bedtime story for your children, marginal.  As a big budget movie with hard work and long hours invested, awful.",N/A
1305567,"Jonah Hex is bad. Really bad. Please turn around now and pick up another movie.Don't trust the low Amazon rating? Read on. I have an almost masochistic fascination with really bad films so I watched this knowing it got terrible reviews from movie-goers and reviewers alike. Sometimes a movie is so bad, you just have to watch it to experience the utter ridiculosity of the filmmaker and new-found heights of cinematic stupidity, like Uwe Boll's seminal crapfestHouse of the Dead, ranked consistently in IMDB's 100 worst films of all time. Even in its awfulness, there's a sort ofMystery Science Theater 3000-like entertainment value as an example of WTF filmmaking to poke fun at. It's so bad, it makes you laugh. Jonah Hex is so bad it makes you want to punch all those involved in bringing this atrocity to the screen. Aside from the sight of the lovely Megan Fox in a bodice, there's really no reason to watch this complete mess of a film. If you enjoyed last summer's bombG.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, however, you might like Jonah Hex.Previous reviewers hit it right on the head when they likened JH to Wild Wild West and Van Helsing for its mix of western, sci-fi and steampunk. All 3 films had big, likable stars, were ridiculously campy and failed miserably at the box office. I'll add in another:The League of Extraordinary Gentlemenfor JH's similarity in plot of bad guy building a terrifying ship-based superweapon that can level cities and supernatural/occult overtones. I like hero/anti-hero action, westerns/period films and historical fiction, with an occasional bit of camp, but with a muddled script, a snooze-inducing villain, and a really crappy hero, Jonah Hex manages to get everything wrong in its brief 72 minutes. On top of that, the decision to mix heavy metal into the film was just dumb. The consistently excellent Marco Beltrami provides part of the score and progressive metal band Mastadon provides the rest. Westerns and heavy metal do not mix, especially during shootouts, adding a decided factor of cheese to the whole thing. I like westerns, I like action. I like metal. I do not like them all at once.Never mind some of the severe gaps in storytelling logic: Eli Whitney, inventor of the cotton gin, went on to design a secret super-weapon for the US government that it never built, but it had all the parts and plans just lying around? Never mind that a band of ex-Confederate rebels with no scientific or engineering background can build the thing in a few weeks or the unexplained source of the glowing orbs that provide the explosive power. Never mind because this movie is already so bad that logic gaps can't make it worse.Josh Brolin, who I loved inNo Country for Old Men, is totally uninteresting in his portrayal of the title character. Maybe there wasn't much he could've done with the script. He is devoid of personality and so is his arch enemy, John Malkovich, who looks more like bum than villain and maybe even more boring than he was inEragon. The last time I saw this much wood was at a gay pride parade. Michael Fassbender does give the film a much-needed splash of personality as the vicious and combat-adept Irish psychopath Burke, as does Aiden Quinn as President Grant, and the Smith who makes Jonah's gear. In his brief 2 or 3 minutes onscreen, Smith manages to convey more warmth and personality than Brolin does in the entire film.What killed this movie, aside from the lack of character development and plot that's as chopped up as Hex's face, was just how lame Hex was as a hero. I'm not familiar with the comics, but if Hex is supposed to be the strong, silent type, you won't see it here. Brolin's Hex can hardly fight and gets shot really easily. He's pretty much a wimp and a bungler. I didn't expect to see the archetypal ""Man With No Name"" that Clint Eastwood made famous (though there is a scene ripped off from Fistful of Dollars), but I did expect a solid measure of bad-assedness, self-reliance, and the ability to avoid getting shot, either by using brains, or quick reflexes. He seems to have no knowledge of combat/assault tactics and would've died if not for the unexplained Indian medicine men who keep reviving his sorry carcass. He depends on fancy weapons more than wit, quick-thinking, or fighting abilities. The gatling gun that features so prominently on the movie poster, you see only once. For about 20 seconds. He is so poor at being a hero that he gets ambushed trying to do an ambush -- he gets jumped by Burke as he tries to sneak up the plank to their boat. At night... Lastly is some questionable CG. The crayola-colored dreamworld/flashback sequences are cheesy and poorly done as are some really fake looking explosions. Even the superweapon is lame. It shoots out cannonballs, and then a glowing Dragon Ball to detonate them.Ugh.. watch this only if you feel life is too long.

1401495,"Today, the ruling ideology could be found in the realm of the popular culture, first and foremost the movies. It is easy to dismiss this movie as an innocent light entertainment, but I think it is not that simple. What we are consuming is ideology of a specific kind, an ideology of caricaturing the other cultures, while asserting a dominance of the Western norms. I think ""Ghost Protocol"" incites fear, loathing, and ridicule vis-a-vis the ""Orient"" in a jokey kind of manner.""Orient"" is not a geographical term, but a cultural one. It is a gap that separated ""the West"" form ""the Rest"". The hallmarks are: a reflexive cultural contempt and even mild racism, expressed in patronizing superiority vis-&agrave;-vis other cultures. It has become, with few exceptions, a common thing in the Hollywood today.  For me, as a Russian-American, it looks like Russia has been placed firmly by the Hollywood in the realm of cultural ""Orient"". In this particular film, Russia was portrayed as a backward, dangerous, Byzantine country once more. Starting with the music -- they chose a grim, ominous music for the beginning of the ""Moscow"" scene.A group of likable American spies sent to take down a world-threatening baddie, sort of a ""Consigliery"" to the Russian government. The plot in brief: the crazed Russian wants to incite nuclear war so that the planet may be cleansed and born anew, and he's doing the ""pit two nuclear powers against each other"" gimmick to make it happen. After the spies are implicated in a terrorist attack in Moscow, which destroyed the Kremlin, they went first to Dubai and then to Mumbai to clear their names by catching this guy ""red-handed"".The music, the military uniforms, and all other intangibles - all this suggest to us a militaristic, aggressive, and anti-Western nature of Russia. The crazed Russian politician - curiously -- has a Germanic name ""Kurt"". Thus, the remorseful scriptwriters Nemec and Appelbaum have fused the pre-supposed ""Prussian militarism"", and perhaps quasi-Nazi ideas with the Russian ""Oriental Despotism"" and the ostensible technological backwardness of Russia.That the Russians are backward is emphasized by the clich&eacute; that ostensibly nothing in Russia works (for example, the ""pay-phone"" scene). They also can be easily fooled by Ethan Hunt, could pretend to be a Russian without them noticing it. The ethnic divisions have been exploited once more (why not?) -- between the Russians and Ukrainians, between Serbs and Croats. The spies' helper is Bogdan, which in Russia is considered a Ukrainian name. Tom Cruise was thrown into Moscow prison for, supposedly, shooting six Serbs who ostensibly had been involved in the ""ethnic cleansing"".In my view, there have been three slurring ""shots"" at the Russians: 1] for putting innocent people in prison (the rule of law is absent), 2] for having the nukes which are not secure enough (backwardness), 3] for not having the brains to come up with the devilish scheme themselves (unsophistication). Thus, we are presented with Swedish-German ""Kurt"" who came up with the crypto-fascist idea to clean the Earth form the ""rabble"" using the Russian nuclear weapon. He pulls the strings in Kremlin, not even a native Russian guy.As usual with the Hollywood, all ""Russian"" scenes have been filmed in the Czech Republic. The producers didn't even bother to pick the native Russian speakers. Russian wasn't a native language of the ""Russians"" in prison scene and other ""Moscow"" scenes, except a single person - Vladimir Mashkov who played a Russian secret agent. All this looks and sounds really idiotic and incredibly patronizing. The movie is a collection of disconnected action ""packages"", TV series stitched together with white threads (Moscow-Dubai-Mumbai episodes). Appelbaum and Nemec's script are too jokey without being genuinely funny. In my opinion, they have created a dazzling array of techno-tricks that tries to be funny ""ad nauseam"" while making caricatures of the other cultures.",Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol

1686963,"My husband thought this movie was hilarious, I thought this movie was trash. We do not have the same taste in movies. If you like movies about orgies, constant drug ingestion and following a bunch of Wall-Street sales hustlers who follow Jordan Belfort (the Wolf) around like a bunch of moronic, juvenile, seal-clapping sheep (with no opinions or thoughts of their own) that constantly party and shout in a state of debauchery, depravity and disgust, then this movie is for you.I was immediately offended in the opening scene and thought, oh no, it's going to be more of the same, which it was. Leonardo DiCaprio has certainly crashed from his strong, sentimental hero role in the Titanic to this role, which will only make you think less of him. I kept hoping he would be caught, but Belfort keeps resurfacing over and over in his pursuit of the almighty buck throughout the movie. The character, his friends and his wife were so greedy and superficial that you spend your time hoping he gets punishment but he never really did. Exploiting others for money and it's too bad, that this expensive movie was made for it will only lead to Jordan's Belfort ideas of himself of more self-aggrandizement.I watched Pierce Morgan's interview of him and you can see that all he did, he thought was just highly amusing, which it was not. I watched him, and after this watching this movie, I will now steer clear of financial investors if they are like this narcissistic person who you know, only wrote the book for the money and the power and the fame. The only part of this movie that did make me laugh was when he overdosed on qualudes and was driving his Lamborghini home from the country club. Then that turned gruesome when his best friend almost died choking on a hot dog.Shame on you, Martin Scorsese for spending so much money and time and energy directing this awful movie and I am glad it did not win any Academy Awards, as it did not deserve any. As far as Jordan Belfort, I do hope someone stops you (he does play a cameo of himself at the end of the movie presenting DiCaprio directing a sales presentation). Obviously, you are a person of no morals and you haven't learned any.One last thing, if you like hearing the ""f"" word over and over and over, then you will like this movie. Raunchy, the height of vulgarity, obscene and immature, and just downright stupid, besides the pointless sex scenes, this movie left a strong distaste for me of all the hackers that are out there trying to sell you something.

The older Star Wars films were mostly a tribute to the cheesey sci-fi movies of the 50's and 60's.  A true space opera, they were classics.Episode II relies mostly on the impressive special effects to mesmerize and entertain.  Acting and story are second to this.

Sound is not great.  A number of minor unnecessary irritations.  The whole US-USSR thing is in the way rather than helping anything.  Meant to heighten tension I suppose.  Very poorly done.  Spacewalks are clumsy and non-sense in how they are done.  When aboard the Discovery for the first time, they open a spacesuit and breathe the air to test for oxygen.  Ridiculous when they obviously would have the means to test the air.  That was widely available even back when the movie was made.

1576634,"Wow, when I originally read reviews for this movie I really had high hopes. I am a big fan of giallo movies and euro-horror. I love Bava, Argento, Fulci and Franco and have seen many of the key recommended giallo films of the 70s. This is none of it. It doesn't even work on a reconstructed, subverted or meta level - because NOTHING happens in the movie. There is no central mystery to solve, there are no murders, there is no conspiracy. Midway thru when you are CRAVING some type of plot point or scene which would propel the narrative or give you a clue as to where the movie is taking you - you ask yourself, &#34;Is this just about Toby Jones slowing losing his mind?&#34; AND IT IS. Although you don't particularly have a clue as to why he's losing it. And him cracking up never leads to any kind of explosion of violence, denouement or cathartic release for the audience. There is a trying too hard to be clever &#34;switch&#34; one hour into the movie to lend it some kind of credibility by trying to put it in the company of Mulholland Drive, Persona or 3 women. But there is no underlying logic to it. What this movie has going for it is sound design and cinematography. But that was completely exhausted in the first 40 minutes. If you want to see another hour and 10 minutes of Toby Jones sliding faders and turning knobs or an actress screaming in a booth for the 10th time - be my guest. Tedious, repetitious and decidedly NOT a tribute to giallo (other than a sly tangental referencing of Suspiria in the movie that is being made within the film). It's a boring indie psychodrama masquerading as an arthouse &#34;horror&#34; movie. If you want to see an abstract arthouse tribute to giallo then rent &#34;AMER,&#34; a strange, stylish exercise in italian thriller subversion. (Although it has flaws, too!)

When a far, far superior product (the Disney production) is available for virtually the same price, I can only see the BBC charging the same for this DVD because they are accustomed to gouging and cheating the public by charging unreasonable high prices for shoddy merchandise of little to no quality.  Not only is the Disney production a far superior adaptation of the C. S. Lewis classic, the graphics, animation and acting are light years better than the BBC's production -- and at nearly the same price.  BBC, you should hang your heads in shame.",N/A

1634276,"....not good at all....&#34;In the heat of the night&#34;was a very successful movie in which a homicide detective from the north(Sidney Potrtier)is stranded in the deep south in a town called Sparta on the night of the murder of a rich white man.The bigoted police chief(Rod Steiger)at first suspects the detective,Virgil Tibbs of being the killer,based mainly on his race but then uses his expertise to solve the crime.The film was a gritty portrayal of bigoted attitudes that ultimately lead to a grudging mutual respect between the two main charectersSteiger won the Oscar for his portrayal of the policeman Gillispe..The t.v.show toned down all of the grit and realism,making Gillispie a sort of loveable curmudgeon with slightly politically incorrect racial viewpoints,while Tibbs,whose anger at the prejudice he experienced in the original film version was palpable was recast as a forgive and forget sort of a guy who just happens to accept a job working with Gillispie...Where the original film was on fire the t.v.show was just an ember...Still,once one got past all of the watering down the show succeeded as a typical 1980s police drama...Nothing really weighty or controversial,just the facts,the usual suspects,stock charecters played rather broadly.The 8th and&#34;final&#34;season was 4 really bad made-for t.v-movies,none of which had satisfactory conclusions.Gillispie the bigot has married a black politician,something the original film version Gillispie would never have done.Indeed,by the 8th season Gillispie may well have been a member of the N.A.A.C/P.given his 180degree makeover.Tibbs was long gone,the Sparta police department was happily integrated under a new police chief who was African-American,and Gillispie was sheriff of an equally happily integrated sheriff's department.So much for 1980s reality.The films present crimes and criminals but for the most part there are no conclusions to these tales.In &#34;By duty bound&#34;Gillispie is about to retire.A corrupt but popular businessman intends to take his place.Three murders take place.A suspect is arrested.END OF FILM.In&#34;Grow old along with me'an ex-policeman with a dark secret weds the local rich widow.A woman from the policeman's past emerges and threatens to spill the beans.The ex-cop and his new bride plan to murder her but their plans go very wrong and two innocent teens are killed instead.The couple is blackmailed.The ex-cop kills himself.END OF FILM.No conclusions.No wonder the show folded after this dismal last season.Sure,in real life there often are no satisfactory conclusions but given all of the re-tooling the show underwent in its transformation from film to television,and the 7 seasons in which each episode did have a conclusion these final 4 films are jarring to say the very least.",In The Heat of the Night: Complete Season 8

I will say one good thing about this movie didn't give it another star but at least the hero's had fears and freddy played on that, but super powers made the less scary.

1124636,"There are a couple of things one needs to know before reading on or for that matter watching this film.  Firstly, if you are aSawfan you might like this.  I am a not a fan of the Saw sequels.  I actually despise them so take that for what it is.  Secondly, if you haven't seen these films this is no place to start.  If you watch thefirst oneand then find your brain craving some bizarre inner need to watch even more unnecessary and gratuitous depictions of bloodshed, then soldier on through its sequels.  For the record, I don't put much stock into the quality of the original either.The Jigsaw Killer died in theprevious sequel, so here we just see the echoes of his self-righteous manipulations take their toll and wreak havoc on his victims even after his death.  The plot detail is long and a bit convoluted but really the ideas behind the traps and the many twists the film has are not bad, it is just that the cliche gets a bit tiring after a while.  If the film were done outside of the context of an obvious exploitation money-making machine I might even be praising how clever some of the film's details are.  The trouble is the film's goals are so obvious that quality in other respects (e.g. acting) is clearly placed aside in favor of making it's targeted audience squirm and cringe.  This is the modern dayA Nightmare on Elm StreetorFriday the 13thsequel but disguised underneath its surface of complexity and with far more in your face death/torture scenes.  To me, those aforementioned slasher film sequels had some comical charm within their obvious exploits, but the Saw franchise is pretending to be above that and that is unforgivable.  It is also somewhat sad that so many people would flock to see this.  It made $133 million worldwide ($63 million domestically) but cost just $10 million to make.  Either I don't get it at all, or I do get it and it's pretty twisted that so many people enjoy something so violent and so poorly done.I'm making myself out to be a movie snob for sure (and I probably am) but keep in mind I'm not opposed to violence in films.  In fact, I can even appreciate the use of violence to this extreme when it occurs in a serious and believable production or better yet in a film that doesn't have the intention of being taken seriously.  Saw IV's problem is that it takes itself seriously but doesn't in anyway feel remotely believable and even within the franchise's existence as a streamlined blockbuster producing monster, that is not acceptable to me.  Then again it's quite definitely acceptable for a lot of people.  That fact makes me squirm and cringe far more than the clever antics of the Jigsaw Killer.",N/A

Posey's brother brings home his fiance, played by Tori Spelling, to meet his mother and twin sister, played by Posey. He has not been home for years, and his mother nurtures the unnatural, sexual relationship between brother and sister. Posey instantly dislikes Tori so much that she goes out of her way to berate, insult, and undermine her at every turn without her brother interceding  and all against the background of a dark, stormy night (a cliched movie theme). Worse comes to worse and the movie descends down hill. Don't waste your money. Save it for &quot;Party Girl&quot; or the independent drama, &quot;Clockwatchers,&quot; if you are a Parker Posey fan.

Other than Daredevil, this is the worst comic book movie of all time. Val Kilmer had a creative difference with Joel, so he didn't come back, enter George Clooney. From E.R fame, and he's worse than Val Kilmer. He plays himself in this movie, and when he's Batman he doesn't try to disguise his voice. And please, Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. A wasted Character, a side note. It's really hard to take a Joel Schumacker movie serious, when you've got neon lights flashing all over the place.

Because much like the 60's t.v show, Batman and Robin go to social gatherings. WITH A BAT CREDIT CARD!!!!!!, are you kidding me. You don't give the most dangerous character in the JLA, and in the world A BAT CREDIT CARD. Oh and we're treated to Batgirl, yep Alicia Silverstone shows up as Alfred's niece . Yeah that's as much backstory as the movie gives too, meanwhile Alfred is dying. And surprise surprise surprise, he has THE EXACT SAME DISEASE THAT MR. FREEZE'S WIFE HAS, and only he has the cure. But he wants to freeze all of Gotham, to hold them hostage. In the immortal words of Chris O'donell, this movie's purpose was made to sell toys.

But that's about it, I keep trying. And other than the keep Alfred alive storyline, The movie just wanders, first Barbra is a bad girl from England, just without the british accent. Then she finds her way into the Batcave, and ALFRED ANTICIPATED THIS AND HAD A COSTUME MADE JUST FOR HER.

So, they enlarge this, decide to destroy the volume and audio clarity, then omit several episodes from the original broadcast. You cant even HEAR the narration; they enhance audio that isnt even from the same clip they show.In 2056 minutes, about one third to one-half are blurry and ruined film clips, somne are propaganda films that are presented as real events.

I have never played the game but that shouldn't be the reason why it was unclear what the heck was going on. Mark Wahlberg played Max Payne so passionlessly that it ached to watch, he was flat and lifeless. I understand that in the film he went through trauma since his wife and kid were killed but did it kill his acting too? He wasn't the tough guy he was portraying, he was a zombie, not to mention the lame casting; Nelly Furtado ( short part but still) and Ludacris? Really, are there no actors left to do their craft? Mila Kunis got her twitchy eyes fixed but still looked like a pug in makeup, not to mention Olga Kurylenko who played Mona Sax's sister, literally wearing the same nightie she wore as a dress in her other movie ""Hitman"" I was appalled that she had to play the exact same character, her outfit and makeup was exact, and of course she had to act like a monkey in heat, once was enough but to see her do it twice in two movies where it was almost identical was maddening, grrrr!At first the story was intriguing, the secret that seemed to bind people and then cause them death looked cool, not to mention they all had wing tattoos on their wrists; the wing of a Valkyrie, the Norse mythological deity that took those who died a violent death to heavens....Pretty soon we get to see dark winged creatures ripping people to shreds, later we find out that perhaps its all a hallucination, well at the end I didn't know what it was and I watched the whole movie. The mystery sucks if all the ends are loose and the secret isn't so shocking, some parts were obvious and some weren't even surprising, just a poor choice of conclusion and overall I thought the movie had nothing to say, even the ending was hollow and unimpressive.

(Identical twins speaking in unison:  ""Our mommy says our daddy is a sex machine.""  Remember ""I used to be a heroin addict, but now I'm a methadone addict"" and ""I'm into leather""?)But Schwarzenegger gets the kids to mind him by putting up a sign on the blackboard declaring his classroom ""Police School"" and teaching the five-year-olds to march through the playground.  The Fuehrerprinzip at work in our schools.  Is this part of Bush's No Child Left Behind?  Marching?

Then the principal lets him come back to the school as a teacher after he's put all the kids' lives at risk.

771718,"""The Driver's Seat"" is pure arty trash, pretentious, boring and smugly self-conscious, a blatant exploitation of Elizabeth Taylor in which she was obviously a willing participant.  Someone was smoking something when they concocted this one, but it's a-typical of the sort of stuff that tried hard to shock and be esoteric during the 70's.  The plot, such as it is, concerns a woman sought by the police who wanders around, looking for the right man to kill her.  Anyone who doesn't know what ""going south"" means might not realize her intent at first, but unless they're a diehard Elizabeth Taylor fan, I can't imagine they would care one way or the other what she's up to.  Basically Taylor is in her ""strange"" phase, the anti-MGM star, and here she is becoming blowsy and given to wild and tasteless patterns in clothes and frizzy hair, her milieu during this period along with kaftans, but even when shrieking like a harridan or filmed with unforgiving, show-every-bump-on-the-complexion lighting (as is the case here), Taylor is still an amazingly beautiful woman on a scale that few have ever come close to.  This is not one of her better performances, however; it is an excuse to show her clutching her own breasts and writhing on a bed and rolling around in seedy encounters with equally seedy men who spout such ""clever"" lines as, ""I need my daily orgasm"" and being as weird and self-indulgent as possible.  Andy Warhol even makes an appearance.  About as deep as a night at Studio 54 and every bit as banal.

388417,"I saw this movie because it featured one of my favorite actresses from the early '80s -- the lovely Diane Franklin who is probably best known for a better role in a better movie, Better Off Dead.  Here, Franklin is basically the only sympathetic character as she plays the sweetly virginal younger sister of a teenager who is eventually possessed by Satan and goes on a killing rampage in the house that would later become the setting of the Amityville Horror.  Anyway, as part of that whole possession deal, older brother decides to have an incestous relationship with younger sister and the fact that Franklin, an actress who deserved better, is so shamelessly exploited only serves to make this film even more sickening to sit through.  This is the most loathsome type of horror film -- i.e., the type of film that exists only to introduce a group of characters so that the audience can then get the thrill of watching them sadistically killed off.  That takes place in the first half of the film.  The second half is a blatant rip-off of the Exorcist and isn't any better.  Few other movie genres have the potential power of the horror film and a film like Amityville II serves only to remind us how great these films can be when done with some measure of talent and thought (the original Halloween, the Exorcist, the original Haunting of Hill House, and a few others come to immediate mind).  Still, anyone who enjoys watching little children graphically murdered and innocent girls raped by their brothers should find plenty to enjoy in this film.

Then it mercifully disappeared from the story.Hardly a family-friendly movie, needless to say.What dreck.  What an utter waste of 100 minutes of life.  If there are chick flicks, this must be a ""stupid guy flick"".Addendum:  So many nice, thoughtful people have left such deep and thoughtful comments on my review of this rather trivial movie that I thought I should clarify a couple of earlier points I made.First of all, about that ""hardly family friendly"" comment.  The promotional photo/poster and the movie trailers did strongly imply a ""Three Men and a Baby"" sort of family-oriented, if R-rated, comedy movie (definitely some false advertising there).  So it was a bit of a shock to see that photo at the end of the movie of the ugly woman fellating Zach Galifianakis.  I was sitting next to my two teenagers at the time and they were shocked.  I have no qualms about letting my kids watch R-rated movies, and have for many years.  In the past, depictions of [...] automatically got a film a minimum of an NC-17 rating.  I do not take my kids to NC-17 rated films, or to [...] flicks.  How this movie escaped an NC-17 rating is a question for the MPAA.  Nobody ever watches NC-17 rated movies anymore (too much free porn kicking around I guess), and so obviously the producers of this movie must have greased somebody's palms to escape this rating.Second, I wasn't sure when I first wrote this review that there was such a thing as a ""stupid guy flick"". I kind of threw that term out there as a test.  So thanks everybody for leaving all of your comments!  You passed this test with flying colors!  Now I know for sure there is such a thing as a ""stupid guy flick""!Addendum 2:  Hmmm... did some more research to try to understand the obsessive, semi-psychotic fandom for this movie, which is beginning to surpass ""Trekkie"" geek levels.  Here's a few facts:It was recently reported that 40% of households in America now have a female in the household (""the breadwinner"") who earns as much or more than anybody else in the household.  For a number of years now, far more females have attended 4-year college than males - statistically females outnumber males by 2-to-1 in many universities.  Several years ago, females began to outnumber the number of males entering medical school.No, Toto, we are not in Kansas anymore, back in the days when men were men, women were women, etc.  Something has definitely happened to the males of America, turned  them from the responsible heads of households and father figures of olde, into... the sort of men depicted in this movie!So, everybody, keep on posting those comments!  Your love for this ""stupid guy movie"" is phenomenal.  Without a doubt, this movie has hit upon a great truth as to what is happening in our country...",The Hangover - UNRATED

1070030,"It is my belief that superheroes are dark entities.  Let me explain further.  Over the course of many decades, Hollywood has attempted to grapple the popularity of comic book heroines by releasing big studio releases based on what they have seen.  It has been the opinion of many that these executives see color on the page, and immediately believe that the color is what has to translate onto the screen.  There have been countless examples of this happening in cinema, take the most recent ""Ghost Rider"", or ""Batman & Robin"" or even the debacle of the final X-Men film.  To bring it full circle, the reason that these films have not been successful, and why those smaller films seem to understand better the choices of the hero (i.e. why was ""The Punisher"" panned) and bring the grittiness to the surface.  It is when a director sees the hero as a fallen angel, someone who is just as dark inside as the villains that they fight (i.e. see the most recent ""Batman Returns""), that I believe they understand the printed page.  An example of a failure on both ends is the most recent direct-to-video release of the popular 90s comic disaster, the Death of Superman.  It stunned the world, killed the hero we believed couldn't die, and slowly and surely reconstructed the mythology of Superman.  This animated film destroys whatever soul was remaining within this story.  It takes creative risks, destroys sanity, and walks all over what is to eventually become of the Man of Steel.  To be honest, I like animated heroes (the Batman and early X-Men on FOX has been particularly entertaining), but this goes a bit too far and ultimately corrupts anything of value within the written story.What made the story of Superman's death enjoyable was that there was just this unknown beast awakened, so to speak, and fate brought these two indestructible beings together.  It was the battle that drew us to the page, it was the punches that Superman threw and the unknown of this being later to be known as Doomsday, which kept us turning page after page.  (Editor's note: I realize that perhaps Doomsday had been seen in other story arcs, that perhaps there had been other back story eventually created, and that other events had been leading up to this, but when I was young I just read this one particular story - the Death of Superman, and it is the basis for this review.)  To fill nearly an hour and a half, perhaps the creators of this film decided they needed to bring Luther in to prove that they were making a Superman story, perhaps they needed to demonstrate a pathetic love story between Superman and Lane, perhaps they needed to show mass destruction in which people HAD TO HAVE died or been wounded, but it was done so poorly that it transformed a good idea direct-to-DVD to a DVD destined to be eventually found in the $1 bin.  They story should have revolved around the big meeting between Doomsday and Superman, but instead the culmination involved this sub-story with Lex Luthor.  I was hurt.  Everything from Olsen getting a job at a trashy magazine, to the cheap secondary villain, to renegade clones just hurt over time.  This was not the story of Superman fighting Doomsday, but instead several small stories using that brief moment to grow.  It was not the excitement that I anticipated, nor wanted.With the story in ruins, one would hope that the voice talent would at least bring a level of professionalism to the table, but again, I have been wrong many times before.  Adam Baldwin is a ""Firefly"" god, but he doesn't quite have the power for Superman's voice.  There wasn't the strength or humanity behind it, but simply your average man's voice behind the blue suit and cape.  Anne Heche, voicing Lois Lane, seemed (and sounded) like she had been smoking twelve packs a day.  It sounded like Anne Heche doing voice work on an animated film, not an actual character on screen.  The rest were equally as bad.  Case in point, if you need to use Kevin Smith's voice as a cameo in the film, than you need to realize that your film is failing.  He is not credited, but I do believe they used him twice for two insignificant characters, but it was obviously him.  There is one scene where Superman battles, well, with himself (when viewed you will understand), and the dialogue between the two are hysterical.  It is not supposed to be, but it had me nearly in tears.Story in shambles, voice work below average, what else could go wrong with this simple little direct-to-DVD release?  Two more issues arose upon viewing which will confuse the more novice film viewer.  Superman will not allow a child to be killed by Doomsday, but has no problem causing millions of dollars worth of structural damage to the city by merely hitting the beast?  Who eventually has to pay for the rebuilding?  Who made sure nobody was holding a meeting or having a small family reunion in one of those skyscrapers or obvious tenement buildings in Metropolis?  The big battle raged which was fun, but the consistency of this animated Superman was perplexing.  Why would he save one, yet endanger others?  Or, could it be possible that all of this section of Metropolis was empty at this time during the morning?  Too much chaos was happening to believe that nobody else was hurt during the rumble.  The second point, which is brief, but those understanding the comics will get it - why were there no questionable supermen born from this disaster.  Was anyone willing to follow the comic story at all - or was there more money in creating their own storyline?Overall, this was not the film I was expecting.  Again, having grown up reading that single volume of how the ""Man of Steel"" dies, I wanted to see perhaps a synopsis of his life, some of his adventures, all leading up (character development and story) to his big battle with Doomsday.  I realize that more happens afterwards, at least in the comic, but what was presented here, in this film, is not the world or story that I imaged.  In fact, all imagination was stripped away with the poorly voiced characters, the minimal ""darkness"" that needed to surround this iconic character, and the complete chaos caused with minimal consequences.  I must say that the one point I did like from this animated feature was the fact that people did die.  Not tons, but enough to surround the point.  The escape of Doomsday, the fight with Superman, and even Lex's creature all killed, and it was interesting to see that in this DVD.  In the end, it was a sorry, pathetic little film that is worthless compared to the comic it represents.  For those fans, or even us casual ones, this represented nothing but commercialism and capitalistic opportunity - two words that should not be associated with either film or the printed page.Grade: * out of *****",Superman: Doomsday

The premise of the movie is that Violet and Tom are engaged but postpone getting married because Violet needs to move from San Francisco to Michigan where she has received a teaching fellowship. Dutifully, Tom goes with Violet giving up an outstand job as a chief for making sandwiches at a fast food joint.  Even though Violet and Tom are together, their wedding is postponed while Tom's friend Alex married Violet's sister Suzie and start a family, providing a contrast to the unmarried Violet and Tom.  Violet's stint in Michigan is to last for two years during which time they inexplicably don't get married.

The deer is roped to the roof of his friend's car and slides off so Tom has to put the deer in his car with its head sticking out of the sunroof. It would have been funny if the deer charged Tom or that the deer was not dead but stunned and wakes up in the car with Tom.  The movie is made up of scenes like this that simply fall flat.

It's the defective logic of the show's creator! George has once again, as with his re-imagining of the original Star Wars trilogy in the late 1990s, insulted his fans by cutting, splicing and throwing continuity out the window. HE HAD TO KNOW that the fans wanted these shows uncut, as originally broadcast. But because of his own vain obsessive compulsions and his never-ending lust for his fans' hard earned bucks, he's decided to release this monstrosity. Of course, when he sees the sales peak and then decline for these, he'll put out an expensive dvd set of the original episodes. I REALLY hate to say it but I've come to believe that George Lucas is a money-grubbing, anal retentive hack. Is this what the accumulation of great wealth does to the creative genius? Michael Jackson. Tom Cruise. Marlon Brando. George Lucas. Out of touch with reality and in denial that they've lost their creative spark because a much smaller segment of their long-time fan base (in addition to the newer, less familiar fans) adore crap like this no matter how far removed it is from the original product.","The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones, Volume One - The Early Years"
758165,"First off,let me start by saying im a HUGE horror/torture/exploitation movie fan. I own a big library of these films on dvd and jugde them for the intertainment they are,not the impact of certain scenes. That being said this movie in my opinion is utterly trash. The violence other reviews talk about is not as grusome or gory as seen in other films(look at any film by lucio fulci and thisll pale in comparison), the revenge part couldve been way better,the 10 min rape scene is nothing to write home about either. it was rather boring to watch and i just sat through it to see what all the fuss was about (yawns). the ONLY possitive side to this whole crap fest is seeing monica belluci nude in a few scenes,and the dress she wares in the rape scene looks hot on her,thats it. glad i rented this on amazon and didnt buy it because i wouldve been real pissed. the later half of the movie,after the rape is so slow and boring i fast forward it to the end just to get through it. save your money,your patience and 2 hrs of your life and skip this one,watch i spit on your grave, much better movie, better revenge, better gore, better rape scene. i would give it 0 stars if amazon would let me.",N/A
1468661,"My opinion of The Lorax stayed in flux as I watched the movie unravel.  Sometimes I cringed at how heavy-handed they were with Dr. Seuss' simple message, sometimes I was just dismayed by the overabundance of nasty characters they invented and imposed upon his story.  Too many times I wondered where Dr. Seuss was in this messy adaptation of his book.  He seemed to be missing.  The reason for this became clear in the bonus feature.  Apparently, the filmmakers felt it necessary to attach things not Seuss to the story because it was somehow deficient as it was; requiring their extensions.  One of them even had the gall to call it a homage.  But tampering is tampering; clearly they were dissatisfied with most things in the book, especially the notion of having to adapt Seuss' two-dimensional drawings into......two-dimensional drawings in motion.  A lot of work was required to ""make them come alive.""  Again, a slur against Dr. Seuss' work.  If they didn't like the book, why bring it to the screen?  Why add dopey songs that were less than memorable and subvert the plot?  Why ignore the language, what makes Seuss' work so distinctive?  There was a reason Dr. Seuss kept his book somber from page one to the end.  His point was concise, not easily forgotten.  But they had to turn everything into a carnival atmosphere complete with slapstick, a romance, a city, and another villain that wasn't even required.  When you overhaul someone else's work to this degree you're not honoring their work, you're desecrating it.",N/A
256210,"The Karate Kid trilogy despicably ends with one of the most pathetic movies ever produced, &quot;Karate Kid 3,&quot; which was SO stupid, in fact, that it was funny.Years after Daniel-sahn has returned home from Japan, he has yet a NEW girlfriend, and resides with Miyagi somewhere in the U.S.A.  Daniel-sahn is overweight and looking at him walk and talk, one would never guess that he even ever SAW a karate move in his entire life, much less PRACTICED one.  He looks like a chubby nerd who probably couldn't defend himself against a scrappy chihuahua puppy, let alone an adept karateka.In this flic, Daniel-sahn is coerced in numerous ways to begin training for a karate tournament that neither he nor Miyagi have any desire in entering.  Miyagi, in fact, initially refuses to train him and tells Daniel-sahn that he's on his own.  In comes Daniel's deus ex machina: One of the &quot;bad guys&quot; deceives Daniel into believing that he's a good guy that wants to train Daniel-sahn.  And he trains him by having Daniel hitting wooden boards so hard that they bludgeon his fists!  This aggressive training leads Daniel-sahn to break someone's nose, and finally the idiot gets a clue and realizes that he's been set up all along.Finally, Miyagi comes into the picture and gets Daniel back into true form in time for the tournament where Daniel faces an opponent who is clearly much more confident and aggresive than Macchio.  The tactic of Macchio's opponent -in typical, predictable fashion- is to injure Daniel-sahn as severely as possible, scoring illegal hits, then score a legal hit to win.  In typical fashion, Daniel-sahn pulls himself together and wins the last point and the movie ends.This is definitely a movie that should be submitted to Mystery Science Theater for review.  Don't get me wrong; there's plenty of comedy, but the only problem is that the producers of the movie didn't INTEND this flic to be a comedy.  Purchase this movie only if you enjoy comedies, but don't expect any of the drama and interesting plot found in the previous two Karate Kids.",The Karate Kid Part III VHS
625716,"This movie centres on digital effects and considerable noise. There is the ghost of a story here and, like a ghost, appears unexpectedly at times but, again like a ghost, is difficult to see and vanishes quickly.The movie holds your attention to a degree but in the way a series of explosions do. One goes off, then another then ... there's a pause, and then another. So when they stop you wait for the next one because you know it will happen shortly.I suppose my biggest problem with the film is the digital look. It is so excessive you want to tear your hair out. The actors look like people lost in a Twilight Zone episode where they've found themselves in a huge video game.As for the characters, it's fitting that James Cromwell plays a character who is seen only as a holographic image - something with no depth. This is pretty much what every character is.It's hard to fault the actors given what they have to work with. In fact, Bridget Moynahan as Susan Calvin is quite good and effective given the little room she has to actually act. But she's about the only one.For instance, there is the movie's star, Will Smith as Del Spooner . He appears to have phoned in his performance. But to be fair he has to spend the majority of his time being an action figure. But riding motorcycles and jumping from ledges is not acting. As an actor in I, Robot, he's a great stunt man.The sad thing about this movie is that there actually are the seeds of a pretty good story here. But they're lost amid cliche's, stereotype characters and the endless, unrelenting ""set pieces,"" all digitally created and very boring.","I, Robot"

At least, the landscapes are beautiful, but that's not enough for you to be keep awake.What you see is simple: two unnamed guys --  Matt Damon and Casey Affleck -- stray from the marked path somewhere in the wilderness, and wonder the deserted land for three days.  And ... and nothing more.  Surprisingly, according to one interview with Gus Van Sant, this film is loosely based on truth.'Gerry' refuses the traditional rules of films based on our accepted concepts about characters, stories, etc.  So, you should know that to criticize the film according to these ideas is pointless.  Yes, I know very well.  But....Can you really sit through this for more than 100 minutes?  Ask yourself.  Be honest.  Please, tell me.  And I watched it in theatre.  Yes, I confess, I slept during these long, continous scenes that show you two guys walking on and on and on ... and is that worth our money?  OK, let's not talk about money.  That's commercialism.THE problem is, Gus Van Sant denies traditional way of filmmaking -- that's fine in itself -- but  does not show something new, something that can take the place of the good old traditions.  We need something, or anything, in the place of conventional ideas storytelling.  Instead, what we see is, two men wondering on and on, trapped in the land of nowhere.  Existential?  Maybe, but think about that they made (part of) the film on location in Argentina!  Is that worth that trouble?Using the clout he got with 'Good Will Hunting,' Gus Van Sant made a silly remake (or copy) of 'Psycho.'

379158,"What else can I say about this movie? This... um... sequel (?) to a previous alien encounter film called Xtro is not only a blatant rip off of other, more popular Sci-Fi movies but it does them in the worst way possible. The script is a nightmare, the special effects are weak, the acting is weaker, and the whole idea just shouldn't have been done to begin with. Xtro II: The Second Encounter has nothing new (or even decent) to offer to science fiction or horror fans.Have you seen the original Xtro? Don't worry if you haven't because this ""sequel"" has absolutely nothing to do with it. Not a single connection is made between the two movies other than an alien killer is on the loose. I guess director Harry Davenport just likes to name his alien invader movies Xtro no matter how unrelated they are. The worse thing about this is the movie makes references to significant stuff that happened in the past. To a casual viewer they might think it's the previous movie when in fact it's stuff that's not from any previous movie. The references are so ominous and evasive that you can't help but wonder what the heck they are talking about.This is the sort of thing that plagues the script from beginning to end. The plot is vague and incoherent along with the fact some really dumb (and thankfully minor) plot twists are also splattered along the story. Essentially the movie moves from an Alien knock off plot with characters getting picked off one by one (and you can see it's coming a mile away) to an Aliens (the movie) knock off with more people getting picked off (again making you feel psychic for knowing who gets it and when). Any attempt to build suspense or fear fails miserably. The dialog is utter tripe, with lame one-liners and wannabe catch phrases all over the place. The more embarrassing being when they start doing ""tech talk"", which reminded me of Spaced Invaders. Only with Spaced Invaders they meant to make it sound silly.Character development? You can forget that. The characters are written one-dimensional and the acting doesn't get much better. The only character with even a hint of decent dialog is Zunoski, but it's not enough to endorse this film.  All of the acting is pretty lame with just a little exception to Jano Frandsen, who in the final 20 minutes of the movie finally shows some character development. Actually there is probably ten minutes in this movie where I did start feeling interested in it and it's during this Frandsen moment. But again it's not enough to give this movie any kudos. Special effects aren't special at all. As a matter of fact it feels more like an 80's movie. That's probably due to a small budget. I will give props on the design of the alien monster, even if how it came to be, why it's killing everyone, and how the characters handle it give more than enough to ruin what little the movie has going for it.Xtro II is a mistake. My only guess on why they made it was because they thought they could make money with just clich&eacute;s and no well-developed story. I can only recommend this to Mystery Science Theater 3000 as they are the only ones who could make something of this picture. I don't recommend this anybody or anything else.

1355766,"A dull supernatural series that gives Boris Karloff the chance to show that regardless of the plot, and how weak the dialogue is, that he could still show up for work.Some of the stories reminded me of Twilight Zone (1959 TV series), or Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955) while others reminded me of the Outer Limits (1963 TV series). In other words, they didn't have any fresh initiative or original feel of mysteries, thrillers or dramas.The entire Thriller series was so poorly done: low production values, weak story lines, abundant logic flaws (and that's taking the specific genre into account).Overall, not a big fan of Karloff but that is because I think stranding him on a dull supernatural series for years stuck in one genre was a big mistake and it didn't allow him to be a proper actor.Recommended only for the selfish people who love Karloff blindly since they won't listen to any objection if they're in love with crappy old anthologies or simply looking for past, stuffy nostalgia.All others avoid and save yourself the hefty money, this set isn't worth it.I'll be selling my advanced Thriller promo copy that I sat to watch for 2 long, dull weeks.",N/A

Also none of the titles were on the line thoughout this PPV which made some of the matches seem like ""what was the point of that?""  This PPV turned out to be a complete embarrisment to WCW (and wrestling) at the time.King Of The Road Match: Dustin Rhodes vs. Blacktop Bully - This match took place on the back of a caged flatbed moving truck where you had to move from the back to front & ring a bell at the top of the flatbed.  They were limited in what they could do so it wasn't anything special once you get past the whole ""they're fighting on the back of a flatbed truck"" thing.Martial Arts Match: Jim Duggan vs. Meng - Duggan doesn't know anything about martial arts so this was really a brawler vs. martal arts match...and it just wasn't any good period.Boxer vs. Wrestler Match: Johnny B. Badd vs. Arn Anderson - You can see why these type of matches never work because it just wasn't a good mesh.  It had a comical ending around the third round but besides that, it was like a train wreck that you had to just watch.Randy Savage vs. Avalanche - This match was just too slow & dull and Macho Man was grounded with slow moves by Avalanche.  The only thing to note in this match was Ric Flair dressing up in drag (complete with makeup, painted fingernails, ect.) to attack Randy Savage.  It's sad what Flair was reduced to at this time.Sting vs. Big Bubba - This was just another dull & boring match but I'll give some credit as Sting sold his hurt leg better than I've seen most wrestlers sell injuries.Falls Count Anywhere Match: Nasty Boys vs. Harlem Heat - This was the match of the night as this was the all over the arena brawl that resulted in everything being used as weapons...including mustard & funnel cakes with Sherri tripping & falling over all the mess that was made during this match.  It was just a fun wild & crazy brawl to watch.Strap Match: Hulk Hogan vs. Vader - Due to the backstage politics surrounding this entire fued (both men refused to job cleanly to each other), this match was overbooked with various runins & angles that was completely overkill.  First, this match was the debut of the Renegade character...which was nothing more than a cheap knockoff of the Ultimate Warrior (which Eric Bischoff, V.P. of WCW, admitted in Warrior's WWE DVD).  Another story was the ""kidnapping of Jimmy Hart"" in which he came out during the match with the assumption that Flair & Vader kidnapped Hart to keep him from being in Hogan's corner.  The masked man angle that WCW did back in late '97 (who was unmasked to be Brutus Beekcake back in October) returned here as well for it be revealed that Arn Anderson was in on everything going on with Flair & Vader as well.  Due to each man not willing to do the job, the ending had Hogan tied Flair to the strap (who was still wearing the makeup on his face from the Savage attack earlier) and touched all the corners with Flair attached to win the match.  Again, this was just out of control wacky booking that killed this match.In the end, WCW Uncensored was just a complete joke of an event that isn't even worth watching unless you just like to get a guilty pleasure out of ""wrestlecrap"" moments like this PPV.

Between that horrible film and Submerged Seagal has released a few decent direct-to-video films. Submerged is not one of them. The sound quality on Submerged was awful.  It's bad enough trying to understand what Seagal says with his mumbling (or the dubbing), but my wife and I found ourselves turning the volume up and down depending on the scene. While you don't really buy these films for the plot, you expect at least a minimal storyline...not with Submerged! We gave up on Submerged less than 15 minutes into the film. Unless your a Seagal fan and feel the overwhelming compulsion to add to your collection, do not buy this DVD!!! If you're not a fan, don't even bother renting (or borrowing from a friend)!",N/A

626977,"In a word,........dreadful!  Nicolas Cage should be embarrassed.  Obviously neither he nor his agent read the script prior to signing on.This farce revolved around the theory believed by Cage, apparently a treasure seeker, and his family, that a treasure map existed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.  This map would lead to the location of the National Treasure, an extensive hoard accumulated by the Knights Templar and Freemasons, and hidden from the British back in colonial times.Cage in an expedition in the Arctic uncovers a ship buried beneath the ice which holds a key to the mystery.  The probe is financed by Sean Bean, who turns bad guy and tries to kill Cage and his exceedingly annoying sidekick, Justin Bartha.  And so a race commences between Cage and Bean to steal the Declaration of Independence and ultimately uncover the treasure.Along the way, Cage recruits soon to be love interest, Diane Kruger, a head honcho working in the Archives.This flick seemed to attempt to copy a format popularized by Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom; swashbuckling hero, bimbo sidekick and blonde hanger on and love interest.  Unfortunately it was geared for a four year old.  The film was so corny that I rolled my eyes about ten time and glanced at the illuminated face of my watch a half a dozen times.",National Treasure
972790,"I remember watching the original Return of the Living Dead in 1985. That zombie movie played on the premise that Night of the Living Dead actually happened. It was a great twist and interesting idea. The zombies in that film weren't shambling and dumb like the one's in Romero's film. Instead these zombies were pretty quick and could talk and formulate plans and traps. Also these zombies couldn't be killed by destroying the brain. It was the birth of the superzombies and it made for a fun experience. One thing it also had was a nice dose of comedy mixed in with the horror.A few years later they had a sequel to Return of the Living Dead that was a good second helping. Nothing to write home about but it was a fun gory flick. Then came a second sequel which dropped the comedy and instead tried to be Romeo and Juliet meets brain-eating zombies. Other than the usual gore and bloodsplatter this second sequel was an utter failure. It took over 10 years for someone to try making a couple more sequels, but sure enough someone found a way to do it. They even found a good enough director in Ellory Elkayem (he directed the fun, campy giant spider monster flick Eight-Legged Freaks). There was talk that this third sequel will return the ROTLD franchise back to its roots of horror mixed with comedy. I was stoked about the news. Then when it came time to see Return of the Living Dead 4: Necropolis, I found out that it was going to go direct-to-cable. This usually means bad news all around about the overall quality of the finished film, but I was still going to give it a chance.I finally saw its premiere on Sci-Fi channel in 2005 and all my low expectations weren't even reached by the what I saw on the TV. The movie starts off well enough and right from the get-go they don't hide the fact that the film is taking place in some Eastern European country. Peter Coyote the --- only actor with any sort of talent --- makes his appearance in this scene and there's not even any attempt to make his character abit mysterious of whether he's a good guy or a bad guy. Coyote's scientist role in the film screams evil mad scientist. The rest of the cast seemed like it was randomly picked from a college campus and from the streets of Romania. The dialogue was bad enough but having them read out loud by amateurs just made it all worse.The whole premise of the film outside of reintroducing newcomers to the zombifying effects of Trioxin seemed like the writers were trying to emulate Resident Evil instead of Return of the Living Dead. There's the mega-corporation which deals with everything known to man and also research and develops illegal biowarfare technology like zombies armed with hi-tech weapons. Resident Evil did this better (thats not saying much) so it goes without saying that ROTLD4: Necropolis just didn't know what it wanted to be. There wasn't any of the comedy that made the first two films in the franchise so fun to watch. It looked as if they tried to make a serious zombie movie and instead it turned out to be seriously bad.Even the zombies themselves ended up being inconsistent with the zombies from the first two films. Some seemed smart enough but most were of the Romero kind which goes against everything that is ROTLD. Their feeding habits even changed from eating nothing but brains but to eating other parts of the body.And they're not indestructible anymore. Shooting these zombies in the head will drop them like a sack of bricks.There really wasn't anything fun about this sequel. I would've given it a second star if they just made the zombies right and added a higher gore-quotient. Zombie movies are suppose to be dumb, gory fun but instead Return of the Living Dead 4: Necropolis just ends up being dumb, horrible and awful. I had alot of hope in Ellory Elkayem as an up-and-coming genre director, but cranking out this film after making such a fun one in Eight-Legged Freaks is a mystery and saddening. I wouldn't recommend this film as a rental on dvd. Just go rent the original two films in the series and leave this one alone.",Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis

The first 20 minutes are so touching and sweet and then the whole thing just falls off an absurd cliff.  The whole plot (if you can call it that) was lame.

(Like, why would beautiful Keri Russell even consider marrying an abusive meathead like Jeremy Sisto's ""Earl""?)  Even the passionate love scenes were so exaggerated as to be ridiculous.

1051762,"It is a true disgrace that shows get butchered because of rights.  This has happened before.  Mystery Science Theater 3000 was cancelled because it was getting too popular and the rights to movies became too expensive.  Now WKRP in Cincinnati is being altered because of music rights.  I'm surprised certain clothing lines haven't demanded money for the rights to Beverly Hills 90210.  (Quick, airbrush their clothes!!!!)Here's an idea for Fox.  Instead of charging the $39.98 market price for the DVD set, charge $54.98.  That would add $15 per sale extra into the budget.  If you sell a meer 100,000 copies of the DVD (which I believe the city of Cincinnati, itself, would purchase) you then have $1.5 million to put towards the rights of the original songs.  Just think if you sell a million copies or more.  I personally would spend more money to get the original versions of the episodes instead of these blasphemous shells of a great show.

1384923,"I'm a rabid MJ fan but this collection made me furious! Do not believe the product hype! Quite simply ""Michael Jackson's Vision"" promises a lot and delivers very little. There is no mention of the fact that almost all the videos are presented in 4:3 aspect ration, so if you have a television that was manufactured ten years ago, you won't have a problem. In addition, the claim that these short films have been remastered is a gross deception. As you'll see from other reviews, there are few videos that are actually in HD.I already own various DVD releases of MJs short films including the Dangerous short film collection, the two volumes of his HIStory DVDs, Moonwalker, and his Number One compilation. I even own one of the few good versions of ""The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller"" on VHS, so when I complain about this box set, it's because there's so much to get upset about (one reviewer describes Michael Jackson's Vision as a disrespect to the memory of the artist and I couldn't agree more).One of the reasons I bought this collection is because it boasts the inclusion of the ""rarely seen 'Ghosts' directed by Stan Winston"". I own the only officially released version of this amazing short film when it came out on VHS back in the '90s. There have been illegal transfers of the 38 minute film from VHS to Video CD that are pretty low quality (like a schmuck I bought one) but currently there are no other legal version formats available. Thus my excitement to read in the product description that the short film had finally made its way to DVD - and remastered no less!! Don't you believe it.Instead of the 38 minute short film, what we are given is a 5 minute montage accompanying  the song ""Ghosts"" from MJ's ""Blood on the Dance Floor"" EP. Someone has actually gone to the trouble of butchering and reducing the original 38 minute remarkable short film down to a meaningless parade of nonsensical images. This ""limited release"" is nothing but a very expensive and poorly presented rip off. Even the booklet is lame and does not improve the quality of the product - merely a photo book of stills from the short films with scant production info. If I sound furious, it's because I really am.

883540,"Primer is arguably the slowest movie ever made, far from being a primer in time travel it seems to be an advanced tutorial in stopping time.  Imagine four Silicon Valley techno-geeks talking simultaneously into barely functioning mikes and you have Primer.  The plot, such as it is, has also traveled through time, revisit old episodes of Rod Serling's Twilight Zone to see for yourself.On its face, the premise of time travel and the creation of alternate selves, manipulating or not manipulating events and thereby tinkering with the smooth continuum, would seem to be promising.  While it does prompt rather grandiose philosophical questions, (questions that exceed the grasp of Mr. Carruth who wrote, directed, starred, scored, edited, and painted the props), it defeats its purpose because there are simply too many possibilities.  Drama depends on well-defined situations and tension, in the silly-putty world of Primer, where anything can happen; there is no definition, tension, or suspense.Normally, when I learn that plucky kids made a movie for $7,000 I cheer, because Hollywood needs to know that big money does not equal quality.  (Robert Townsend's Hollywood Shuffle is a stellar example of film excellence on a shoestring budget.)  When I hear that a film is a Sundance winner, I'm immediately interested because this often points me towards movies that are small, overlooked, and wonderful.  But no system is foolproof, and Primer snuck through the cracks.For a mature look at time manipulation that does provide meaningful structure, try Last Year At Marienbad, Memento, or even Lost Highway.  Marienbad and Memento are brilliant, and Highway, while it leans heavily on signature Lynch weirdness to make its point, at least provides the visceral impact thoroughly lacking in Primer.  I'm afraid that Primer is little more than 78 minutes I'll never get back.",Primer

519958,"I really, really did not like this movie. Saying this when almost all the other reviews are well written explanations of why this movie deserves 5 stars is very difficult indeed. Nevertheless, after seeing this movie I felt very disappointed. I am a fan of both fantasy and science fiction, and I read and enjoyed (to some extend) one of the books in the Lord of the Rings series. So it is not that I just dislike fantasy/sci-fi.The reason I disliked this movie is that when I saw it in the theaters I almost fell asleep. There was no dramatic tension at all. Although I have to admit the opening sequences were very good, and the special effects and scenery were great - I would claim that the filmmakers got totally carried away with special effects. Once the hobbit and company started fighting computer generated monsters, I grew less and less interested until I was at the point of walking out of the theater! I mean, I have nothing against fighting in movies, especially fighting with well done special effects - but enough is enough! After a point there is no more excitement, and it becomes monotonous and dull.Honesty, the sad thing about movies today is that the reliance on special effects has led to a decline in the quality of the other aspects of the film, such as dialogue, creativity, etc, etc. In my opinion, there is nothing interesting in watching hours of computer generated fighting scenes. Come on - where is the excitement in that?In addition to the excessive fighting, I feel that this movie was badly acted. In one scene, there was a close up on the hobbit's face after somebody was killed (the fact that I don't remember who shows how much I really cared at that point) - and the whole theater began laughing out loud. I don't think that this was the desired effect, somehow.Anyhow, this is only my personal opinion. After viewing the movie, I felt that it was very bad due to the excessive fighting (and subsequent lack of creative dialogue, character development, etc, etc.) and poor acting. Hollywood really needs to go back to watching some classic movies - which did not use any special effects - because it seems that filmmakers have lost the ability to entertain audiences without massive doses of sepcial effects. And even worse, as proved by this movie, sometimes even special effects cannot make a dull movie interesting...",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring

Great example guys! Worse yet, they end the ""love"" scene with a ""nice to meet you."" Blah! ya right.Then the multiple plots begin. First, the race is on between Jake Gyllenhaal and his competitor to sell anti depressants. Jake promotes Zoloft, saying it has 27 less side effcts than Prozac, but the point of that race is moot because Jake keeps stealing the Prozac samples from the doctor's office and tosses them in the dumpster, and we see a homeless man take them and progressively get his life back in order. Does that now mean Prozac is better than Zoloft?Second, the plot changes again, because Pfizer comes out Viagra and the whole anti depressant issue was just a waste of time, as Jake begins to party and cheat on Anne Hathaway, if they even had a relationship, considering yet another plot of Anne having Parkinson's disease, and Jake doesn't want to date somebody that is sick.All in all, who cares about this story?Next!",N/A

I'm no feminist, but even considering the unsavory idea of selling your kid to the highest roller left me flabbergasted.  There is no great singing in this movie and and absolutely no heart. I got more than halfway through the movie, and although Caron was known as a prima ballerina, I saw no great choreography or dancing. It'a a bitter pill to swallow for a movie buff like myself, that wonderful  musical movies like Minelli's own Meet Me in St Louis, and others like Singing In The Rain, didn't receive nominations, and that wonderful performers like Fred Astaire and Marilyn Monroe and Doris Day never won Academy Awards.The old people(who are actually wonderful,and the best part of this dreary movie) are the only ones that have decent songs in this pic.  That is, if you can get past the actual words to ""Thank Heaven for Little Girls"", the lyrics are kind of creepy if you really think about them.  ""The Night They Invented Champagne"", which sparkles in the introduction overture and should be the movies highlight, falls extremly flat during the actual performance of the song.(Surprisingly, no  great singing or dancing.)The production values also do not hold up to that old MGM musical movie machine of yesteryear.  It's not a wonder why that this old horse would soon come to a creaking halt; producing  bland movies,with terrible messages, with uninspired actors= going bankrupt.To be honest with you, I don't think that ""Chicago"" should have won best picture even though as a musical  it was a good picture.

Unfortunately, I've come across too many distributers, such as Retromedia, that get a print of the film, format it to fullscreen for reasons unknown, then put black bars across the top and bottom to make it LOOK LIKE widescreen. WHY? Not only are the sides cut off the film for fullscreen, but also the top and bottom are cut off for false widescreen. WHY? Movies like this one are ruined, and are preserved in their ruined state probably forever on a DVD. WHY? Plus, I have just wasted my money because you have fooled me.

157650,"Let's cut right to the chase by saying that this movie reeks, and should never be viewed by any human being. However since I'm a reviewer here it's not that easy. Sure it's a blast to make fun of and there's lots of material to work with, but this is the review on the movie itself, not how much fun you can have with it. The &quot;plot&quot;, if you can stretch the word that far, is about a wealthy man who has been wantonly destroying wildlife in the Florida Bayou finds that a swarm of murderous frogs is closing in on his own mansion habitat. Having said that, Frogs is a dumb little horror movie, and how much you enjoy it depends on your tolerance for wooden acting, silly death scenes, and lots of stock footage of reptiles and amphibians just sitting around. Since I have a since of humor, that spells F-U-N for me.:) In all seriousness however, The Crocker mansion rests on a secluded island in the middle of a swamp. After freelance photographer Pickett Smith is nearly killed while canoeing, by drunken idiot Clint, Smith is invited up to the family estate. There he meets Clint's &quot;cute&quot; sister miserable grand-pappy and about 12 other idiots who act just obnoxious enough for us to cheer when they eventually get eaten up. Even by the standard of B-movies, this one has a whole lot of blah-blah scenes. Dialogue such as ""Where's Maybelle and Grover?"" and ""What happened to Iris?"" permeate every scene. In order to best showcase the whole ""frogs"" theme, each and every sequence in the movie is followed by a shot of dozens of slimy, writhing frogs. They never really do anything, but we know they're there, just waiting. The clan has gathered at the mansion to celebrate several birthdays, drink a lot and do a lot of complaining about how `loud those damn frogs are'. Nasty old grandpa has decided to poison the frogs, but since his handyman has yet to return from the creek, it's safe to assume everyone's gonna die, and in very silly ways. Snakes hang from chandeliers, lizards take over the greenhouse, and still - the frogs watch...and wait. Now here's a shocker, are ya ready? The Frogs, curiously enough, don't commit any crimes. They are basically by standards, and do absolutely nothing to harm anybody!!!! They leave it up to their buddies to do all the dirty work, while the icky amphibians simply sit in the background, enjoying the havoc. These rich snobs get snakebit, tarantula cocooned, chomped by big turtles, sucked on by leeches, and even poisoned by the world's smartest monitor lizards. Up until the final scene, when they hop gleefully on a corpse, the frogs are merely the ringleaders. To put this into the simplest terms possible, this &quot;movie&quot; is dumb!

As others have stated, there are only 4 discs, and 3 are ""double-sided"". The cost of this set should have been in the mid-twenties. Amazon, you owe me ten bucks.As for the movies, I would award 3 stars. Personally, I was a Warner Oland Fan. Sidney Toler did a fair to middling job of continuing the series, especially his early ones. However, by the end of the 20th Century Fox run, the series was obviously spent. Toler bought the rights and continued filming with Monogram, but the Chan movies had run their course and were pretty much over. After Toler died, Roland Winters took over as Chan and effectively buried an already dead body. However, the movies in this series are watchable....just not the best Chans.UPDATE: within a couple of days of my review, Amazon updated their description that now correctly says ""4 discs"".

1416851,"Tarsem Singh is a true visual artist. His films include The Cell and The Fall. Both are visually striking, dramatically satisfying films, at once riveting and horrific. Both films contain unforgettable images. The Cell is a masterpiece of abhorrent beauty. The Fall is a haunting piece of eye candy with a heart-wrenchingly powerful story at its core. Tarsem is a talented man - yet it seems that he has finally decided to sell out, to squander his talents on mainstream macho-trash.The Immortals comes from the same ilk as 300, meaning that it's an overproduced action film, largely filmed using green screen technology, opting for style over substance. It tells the tale of Thesius, a young mortal who is sent on a mission from Zeus. The objective is to lead an army against King Hyperion, an evil tyrant who is trekking across Greece to obtain a coveted weapon - a magical bow and arrow, no less - which has the power to release the titans and annihilate all of humanity.Throughout the course of the film, Thesius crushes a few skulls, deflowers an innocent oracle, annoys the gods to no end, and unsuccessfully attempts to rescue his mother from the likes of Mickey Rourke, who shatters a man's testicles with a croquet mallet for kicks, and wears an awkward little mask with unnecessarily large horns throughout the majority of the film. Speaking of which, there isn't a character in this film that doesn't get to wear a funny hat. Lampshades, snail and clam shells, chandelier prisms - anything is up for grabs in the hat department, according to the costume designer of The Immortals.The acting is mediocre from all involved. Mickey Rourke is simply miscast. He grumbles and mumbles his lines. He seems bored and indifferent. Henry Cavill shows plenty of machismo and gets to scream and twirl around in slow motion a lot. As for Stephen Dorff - well, I'm still not sure what he is doing in this film. As with Rourke, he seems out of his element. The writing leaves much to be desired. This film contains laughably inept dialogue, and the characters are poorly realized. The visuals may be three-dimensional, but you can't say the same for the people on the screen.The direction is frustratingly dull. There is definitely some eye candy to be seen, but it does not feel like a Tarsem film. It feels like a Zack Snyder rip-off. That is nothing to be proud of.Rated R for graphic violence and sexuality.",N/A

With her powers amplified, Ella aims to put an end to Vlad before he can complete his sinister plan. Forrest J Ackerman's sexy heroine comes to life in the Roger Corman production of VAMPIRELLA, but a cheesy, low-budget one, at that. Years before the major studios were tossing millions of dollars at most comic book franchises, the independents managed to squeeze out a few schlocky entries of their own, including Full Moon's DOCTOR MORDRID (taken from a screen adaptation of the Doctor Strange comics), the shelved version of Corman's own FANTASTIC FOUR, and VAMPIRELLA. It is tough to say which is worse in this case, between the poorly choreographed action sequences, the ridiculous overacting, or the narrow-minded plot. If director Jim Wynorski's resume speaks towards anything, it is his tendency to gravitate towards cheap, hastily-made exploitation films, and this is certainly no exception. When she isn't speaking, fashion model Talisa Soto looks fine enough in costume, although the design is far less flattering than one might hope. A discussion into the differences between the comics and the film would be fruitless given the liberal use of the character, so suffice it to say that VAMPIRELLA is nothing more than B-movie fodder that can easily be avoided.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",Vampirella VHS

This potentially sounds HORRIBLE.I say give me Clive Owen, he seems sullen enough, and he proved to me he could tackle the complexities of sci-fi in his dazzling role in ""Children of Men.""(Back to the DVD review, as I'm digressing too much here... but to get a bit personal now...)Cash is king and AMC and A&E; are warming their collective hands over the bones of the highly-protective-of-the-series Patrick McGoohan, whom they waited patiently until he died so that they could then start mining his show that he created and wanted left untouched.And to be honest, there are more than a few of us who'd also like to leave this kept pure as well. No, we didn't need a remake or a reboot, and there are SO many people I know who've asked why do it at all?The release of this DVD set only goes to show me integrity, like clothing, can be shed for the right price, and AMC and A&E; will NEVER receive another consumer dollar from ME.Once again, since there are no technical details available anywhere except from what I found on this very website, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to assume that it's the same set just re-packged to deceive people, and because of that I'm giving this one star.THERE IS NO INFORMATION AVAILABLE ABOUT WHAT'S ON IT THAT'S NEW, so why award a company clearly out for profit?For the last time, and I'll be honest, it won't be the last time for me...

297006,"I recently rented INHERIT THE WIND to see for myself if it was really as bad as I'd heard. It was. I am astounded to find how many reviewers have excused its massive deviation from fact under the banner of ""entertainment.""  Has our capacity to evaluate information diminished to the point that we are no longer able to differentiate between simple entertainment and pure propaganda?  When a movie presents a supposedly intellectual argument, and paints EVERY SINGLE MEMBER on one side of that argument as a buffoon maroon, but shows the other side as thoughtful, open-minded, and humanitarian, you can bet the farm that you're being propagandized! A couple of reviewers here have equated the movie with an indictment of the horrors of ""McCarthyism.""  These folks have been twice-bamboozled!  Obviously they don't do any independent research, but ingest whatever gets fed to them.  Go to [...] and click on ""Profiles"" if you want to learn the truth about Joseph McCarthy and ""McCarthyism.""INHERIT THE WIND pretends to portray the famous 1925 Scopes ""Monkey Trial"" with a little dramatic license.  This movie strays SO FAR from the facts that even saying it is ""based on"" the actual event renders that term so elastic as to be meaningless!  John Scopes is renamed Bert Cates (Dick York), Clarence Darrow becomes Henry Drummond (Spencer Tracy), William Jennings Bryan becomes Matthew Harrison Brady (Fredric March) and Dayton, Tennessee becomes Hillsboro, Tennessee. The playwrights, Jerome Lawrence & Robert Lee, did not alter the names because they thought they could improve on them, but so they could legally reinvent history. The idea was to twist the truth & present it as entertainment ""based on"" a true story, knowing that over time, the drama will become accepted as factual by the masses. And it worked!  Look how many of us grew up thinking that INHERIT THE WIND was an essentially accurate account of the ""Monkey Trial.""All of the Christians (believing in ""Creationism"") in the movie are portrayed as emotionally-overwrought, brain-dead bigots. Paint any other group with such a broad brush and you'll be in court for the rest of your life, but here in Amerika, it's always ""open season"" on Christians.  Hardly sympathetic to both views, in reality, Darrow called Christianity, Bryan's ""fool religion.""Contrary to many opinions posted here, the acting does NOT make INHERIT THE WIND worthy of your time. March & Claude Akins are mere caricatures, but they're not to be blamed as Brady and Rev. Brown were written as cartoon blowhards. Tracy's naturalistic performance is enjoyable as usual, but Tracy was ALWAYS Tracy from film to film; there's nothing new here. Gene Kelly was fine as the cynical, MENSA-donkey newspaper reporter, but it was a simple part to play. The best, most sympathetic performance was actually turned in by Florence Eldridge as Mrs. Sarah Brady.

In set one you get nine episodes and then five bonus features that I'm not sure of exactly what they are, I'll guess either episodes or clip montages. Then if those &quot;extras&quot; are episodes then there are fourteen episodes. Then there is the fact that they are spread out so far over four discs, that is just plain stupid! If there are nine episodes plus reterospectives then they should be on two, maybe three discs, and the same really goes if there are fourteen episodes. Next is the packaging, could it BE any worse? First all that ever changes for the front cover from each set to the next is the color, how creative!

The price is FAR TOO expensive, if all six sets were combined into one package onto fewer discs and with the price given, maybe even a little more, this set would be more exceptable.

352731,"I regret having to write this review, as I am normally a staunch defender of Leslie Nielsen's films and of the genres or parody and satire. Unfortunately, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. What is most astounding for a movie of this budget and quality is that not only did the producers rope Nielsen into this, but Patrick Macnee and Cindy Williams as well. Mercifully given the cast, the title is figurative and no actual nudity is featured in this travesty. The film was originally released in 1983 as ""The Creature Wasn't Nice,"" and has also been titled ""Spaceship."" It was apparently re-released periodically to capitalize on Nielsen's waxing and waning popularity.The film is a very lame spoof of all things sci-fi, and most directly of ""Alien."" The crew of a spaceship under the command of Leslie Nielsen lands on an alien planet and brings back a red jellied life form, making Dr. Stark (Macnee) ecstatic because he has finally found something to name after himself. Macnee gets my vote for most entertaining in the cast with a few decent lines; he is over the top here, but the material lets him down. Cindy Williams is the gratuitous female onboard, and performs what I thought was the worst song and dance number in screen history to entertain the crew. That record was eclipsed about twenty minutes later when the red jelly, now fully grown into a ridiculous gelatinous blob of mucilage, sings a song called ""I Want To Eat Your Face."" If this sounds entertaining, you might be wrong: it reminded me of when I had a wisdom tooth extracted by a military dentist.I won't divulge the fate of the cast, although I will say that as the cast was thinned I was increasingly enthusiastic as I knew that the film was counting down to the end. Before I conclude, I have to give special mention to Gerrit Graham who played Rodzinski. Graham's presence in this film absolutely ensured failure: he was supposed to be obnoxious, but in reality he was so grating that I was almost unable to finish the movie. I suppose this was the result the director wanted, but I can't figure out why. The Rodzinski character has the worst dialogue, never rising above the level of junior high school locker room banter, in this whole insipid mess and rarely have I disliked a character as much. The only other onscreen persona I can recall disliking this much is, uncoincidentally, also in this movie: the ship computer, ""Max,"" has a personality, and the personality is that of a bad AM disc jockey playing personal favorites. Need I say more?I love good satire and parody: I adored ""Airplane!"" and most of Nielsen's other work. I also like genuinely bad camp films, with Ed Wood being a personally favorite anti-genius. The problem here is that there are some relatively big names in a cast that is utterly wasted on the material: some things can't be saved, and this is one of them.For a much better horror spoof, I highly recommend the relatively recent ""Lost Skeleton of Cadavra,"" which has a great cast, an entertaining story, and fidelity to the original genre being parodied.",Naked Space VHS

One of the most disturbing of all is the removal of the girl's &#34;need&#34; to be rescued by a man.  The feminist attitude of &#34;I can save myself&#34; is very thick through out the whole thing... especially at the end of the movie.4.

643596,"In the first act, we are introduced to the main characters. The president of the United States, along with a guy who is supposed to be Simon Cowell played by Hugh Grant, a chubby Mandy Moore and a bumbling al-Qaeda recruit. Seriously. Then they all take turns eating as much Ex-Lax as they can stomach. Then they take some naps and wake up and eat some more. That ends Act One.Act two is just all of the characters shooting diarrhea into five-gallon buckets. Some of it is very brown, but after a while it just becomes clear liquid. They fill up a bunch of buckets like this, on and on for forty-five minutes, until they have hundreds of gallons of diarrhea sitting in buckets. They put the buckets out in the sun and then Act 2 closes.Act three is wierd, because the al-Qaeda operative is one of the finalists on the show ""American Dreamz,"" which is supposed to be American Idol. Hugh Grant and The President of the USA are judging the final showdown between al-Qaeda and Chubby Mandy Moore. No, seriously. Then comes a big, audience participation surprise. Pretty innovative. The doors of the movie theater wer flung open and employees of the movie studio came filing in with the buckets of diarrhea from the second Act. They had long straws they used to suck up mouthfuls of the diarrhea and then they took turns spitting it at the audience for an additional 30 minutes.

328789,"I recently watched this film &#8211; a film I hadn&#8217;t even been aware of until now &#8211; and I found it fascinating in a horrifying sort of way.  The film was financed by William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper mogul, and depicts a president who falls into a coma after a car accident, and is visited by the Archangel Gabriel while in his sickbed.  He is thereby transformed from a passive office holder, based clearly on Warren Harding, into a hard-charging leader, imbued with such determination and fire that he will let nothing stand in his way in transforming the nation for the good of the people.  President Hammond, played by Walter Huston, suspends the Constitution, ruthlessly wipes out corruption and revives the economy through a national socialist agenda (yes, national socialist, i.e. fascist, which is what the Nazis were, and which is precisely the economic program the movie suggests as necessary). When Congress tries to impeach him, he dissolves Congress.What fascinates me almost as much as the movie itself is the fact that the only ones I&#8217;ve seen criticizing it for the ominous totalitarianism it promotes do so by attempting to link it to conservatives today.  On IMDB there is a post saying Bush must have loved this movie.  On Amazon, a user review labels it a &#8220;Conservative/Religious Right/Fascist Wet Dream.&#8221;  I&#8217;ve got news for these people: this was a movie and a message of the LEFT.  Hearst was a big supporter of FDR and the New Deal.  He actually sent the script to FDR and FDR suggested certain changes, which were incorporated into the finished movie.  Apart from the plot mechanism of having the Archangel Gabriel transform the protagonist, there&#8217;s nothing of the religious, right or otherwise, in this movie at all, and conservatives or libertarians, who want to preserve constitutional, limited government would be last ones to support a program like this.On the other hand, there was a lot of support from the left for this kind of idea back when the movie was made.  It&#8217;s no surprise; fascism, national socialism, was a movement of the left, advocating government regulation and control of privately owned business.  And back when this movie was made, before the Second World War and the Holocaust, revealed the evils of fascism in stark relief, for all the world to see, a lot of the left-leaning intelligentsia in the democratic countries had much good to say about Mussolini, and even Hitler.  H. G. Wells, the famous author, was also a devout socialist, who said in 1932 that progressives must become &#8220;liberal fascists&#8221; and &#8220;enlightened Nazis.&#8221; Regarding totalitarianism, he stated: &#8220;I have never been able to escape altogether from its relentless logic.&#8221;  The poet Wallace Stevens pronounced himself &#8220;pro-Mussolini personally.&#8221;  Muckraking journalist Lincoln Steffens said that Italian fascism made Western democracy, by comparison, look like a system run by &#8220;petty persons with petty purposes.&#8221;  NAACP co-founder W. E. B. DuBois saw National Socialism as a worthy model for economic organization. The establishment of the Nazi dictatorship in Germany, he wrote, had been &#8220;absolutely necessary to get the state in order.&#8221;  FDR adviser Rexford Guy Tugwell said of Italian fascism: &#8220;It's the cleanest, neatest, most efficiently operating piece of social machinery I've ever seen. It makes me envious.&#8221;  &#8220;New Republic&#8221; editor George Soule, who avidly supported FDR, noted approvingly that the Roosevelt administration was &#8220;trying out the economics of fascism.&#8221;  George Bernard Shaw hailed Stalin, Hitler, and Mussolini as the world&#8217;s great &#8220;progressive&#8221; leaders because they &#8220;did things,&#8221; unlike the leaders of those &#8220;putrefying corpses&#8221; called democracies.  After having visited Italy and interviewed Mussolini in 1926, the American humorist Will Rogers, said &#8220;I&#8217;m pretty high on that bird,&#8221; speaking of Mussolini. &#8220;Dictator form of government is the greatest form of government,&#8221; Rogers wrote, &#8220;that is, if you have the right dictator.&#8221;  And that&#8217;s just it.  All these people who imagine dictatorship would be just dandy because you can just cut through all the red tape and &#8220;get things done,&#8221; always, ALWAYS imagine that they will, somehow, have the right dictator.History suggests otherwise.  Sure, from time to time, you will get a Marcus Aurelius, an ideal, wise, benevolent, philosopher-king.  But more often, the evidence indicates, you will get a Caligula, a Nero, a Commodus.  That&#8217;s why our founding fathers tried so hard to avoid precisely what these progressives want: power concentrated in the hands of a strong man who will &#8220;get things done.&#8221;  They realized that that kind of power would inevitably be abused.  The leader in charge now might possibly use his power wisely and virtuously, but what about all his successors?And even those leaders who appeared to so many to be wise and virtuous at the outset, often enough revealed their true natures before long.  Just a few short years after all those intellectuals sang the praises of Mussolini and Hitler, World War Two revealed those leaders to be monsters, who plunged the world into the most destructive war in human history, and caused the deaths of millions, precisely because virtually all restraint on their power had been removed, and there was nothing stopping them.It shouldn&#8217;t have taken such a stark example to warn these intellectuals about such dangers.  A reading of history should have been all that was needed.  History is choc a bloc with examples of leaders who abused their power, even when they had noble ideals.  The French Revolution provided one of the best examples of precisely their program as well: put the right people in charge, empower them to act for the good of the people, and remove all the legal impediments to enacting their program and voila&#8230; you get the Reign of Terror, not a better society.  But the example of the Reign of Terror didn&#8217;t educate the progressives then, they had to see World War Two played out, bloodily, before their eyes to get the message that absolute power corrupts absolutely.  And today&#8217;s intellectuals are no better.  Obama&#8217;s job council chairman Jeffrey Immelt said &#8220;The one thing that actually works, state run communism a bit&#8211; may not be your cup of tea, but their government works.&#8221;  UN climate chief Christiana Figueres praised communist China (the world&#8217;s top emitter of greenhouse gases) as &#8220;doing it right&#8221; as opposed to democracies, because it&#8217;s &#8220;able to implement policies because its political system avoids some of the legislative hurdles seen in countries including the U.S.&#8221;People like these scare me, because they prove the truth of what Santayana said: &#8220;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.&#8221;  No matter how many bloody examples there are in our history of tyrants abusing power and destroying millions of human lives, there are those among us who, in order to achieve their short term political goals, stand ever ready to throw away the freedoms our ancestors bled for, because they are too arrogant and short sighted to see that once a dictator has the kind of power they dream of, he will inevitably use it, not just to &#8220;get things done&#8221; that they approve of, but for his own ends.",Gabriel Over the White House VHS

1324210,"This movie does not deserve the hype it is getting.Having now watched the movie and discussed it with many of its fans and read the favorable reviews, it appears the appeal of this movie is a) that it's ""smart"" and b) that it reveals the grand irony that the founder of the world's most popular social network is in fact a total jerk.I was not impressed with the movie on an intellectual level. The movie is essentially about the creators of Facebook, and not about the nature of facebook per se, its hidden privacy controversies and the fact of that such a shallow and virtually useless site is so popular in our soulless times. These to me are intellectual issues worth making various movies about, yet interestingly enough they are issues fans of the movie are quite oblivious of. Instead we get a movie about the creation of facebook and the petty controversies over intellectual rights (among the creators) for the site. Mr Zuckerberg as portrayed in this film is indeed a rather interesting persona himself, yet this socially inept, backstabbing cyber genius smacks too much of an antihero, that bad guy you like. Is it any wonder that in a time filled with so many egotistical, narcissistic facebook and twitter bloggers that this movie has been heralded as best film of the year and Zuckerberg as 2010 Person of the Year? That to me is just depressing.Visually, the movie has nothing to offer. It's just 100% of the time people in rooms arguing. What they argue about (the intellectual rights to facebook among the creators) is only very vaguely interesting. Director, actors and composer do everything in their power to make said talking appear profound by talking super fast in noise-filled clubs, but it didn't help (in fact it made it more difficult to follow). The ending/resolution is abrupt and highly anticlimatic.In short, this movie lets facebook users feel like they've learned a great deal about the site without compromising their own role in the site. People who watch the film come out saying whatever they like about Zuckerberg, but in the end they'll go home to their computers, mindlessly refreshing their facebook walls, posting status updates that no one really cares about, and adding complete strangers with whom they have nothing in common to their ""friends"" list, without once questioning why they feel compelled to do so. Nor, moreover, will they come out any more enlightened as to the dangerous role Facebook has played in undermining our privacy. The movie aims the lens at the wrong people (the creators rather than the users), leaving us with little more than a movie about annoying people making money.",N/A

899191,"The problem with this film is I read the book.  I was disappointed simply because `Be Cool' is an obvious showcase for the musical talent.  The overly long dance sequence with John Travolta and Uma Thurman is a prime example.  Somewhere the bulk of the story was lost--and there are some very--very good characters appearing in the film that would've been more intersing if somebody would've said, ""HEY, don't forget the book!""  But being true to the original source is not Hollywood's strong suit.  ""Be Cool"" provides some popular music, some known faces, but without John Travolta, the movie would never have been made.A few laughs are provided.  A couple ironic scenes show up, but there's too little to sustain a full-length feature.  Basically, the project is a disservice to everyone involved.  Some of the characters are so thin--face it--poor Christina Milian as Linda Moon, is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings--a clich&eacute;.  The Rock does the best he can but again, `He's a gay bodyguard;' he's the  brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a Raji, his boss [Vince Vaughn], who, in the book, is far more sinister--but in the film he's an idiot.Of course Chili is Chili. Travolta does a very nice job, and Chili's obviously the smartest guy in the room.  Uma Thruman's performance is, well, not funny--not serious, not intense--not much-- at best, she made me shrug.  I do like what Harvey Keitel did with Nick Carr, but there's just not enough, and all the negatives reflect completely on the director.

1251251,"I love dogs, Santa Claus, and Christmas... so I thought a movie with all three would be great. Alas, ""Santa Buddies"" is no Christmas classic. It is more like a piece of Christmas crud that might (hopefully, accidentally) get placed in your stocking.The magic icicle that stores Christmas Cheer throughout the year is melting fast. It seems that society as a whole has grown too cynical for Christmas. As a result, Santa Claus ( an especially pained and uncomfortable George Wendt) faces a major crisis/power failure at the North Pole. Also, Puppy Claus chooses to ignore his responsibility of  delivering gifts to dogs all over the world. He runs away and meets up with the ""Dog Buddies"" gang; who all must evade the clutches of dog catcher Christopher Lloyd.""Santa Buddies"" piles on every Christmas cliche in the book. Will Lloyd's cold and crusty dog catcher develop a heart of gold and give a free dog to a disabled boy? Will enough Christmas cheer be found in the hearts of cynical, jaded humans to save Christmas? Well, yes, but the production values on this ""Direct to DVD"" Christmas clunker are terribly shoddy.  Wendt and Lloyd, who have both had much better days doing ""Cheers,"" ""Alice In Wonderland,"" ""Bye Bye Birdie""  and ""Taxi"" and ""Back To The Future"" films, respectively,  don't seem too happy to be in this movie, for painfully obvious reasons. The best that can be said about ""Santa Buddies"" is that it is occasionally cute. But it is the type of Christmas movie that parents might put in the DVD player to act as a ""video babysitter"" for their children while they are otherwise too busy or too stressed out during the holiday season. I can't imagine any family taking time out of their busy holiday schedules to sit down and watch this together.  After watching ""Santa Buddies"" (and remember, I love dogs, Santa Claus, and Christmas) I regret purchasing it and do not intend to watch it ever again.",Santa Buddies: The Legend Of Santa Paws

For example, in Disc four (4) Episodes 11-13, Episode 12 is missing. And so on and so fourth. Between Disc one (1) and (2), the outside labeling of Episodes is wrong, i.e. Episodes are missing. And since the episodes are NOT labelled on the discs (you cannot see on the TV which Episodes are playing, despite the facts you have to watch the credits again and again) this defect is harder to detect.

1451732,"Madonna has yet to direct a movie that entertains or enlightens or even just makes you want to see more from her. Granted she's only directed two but without the celebrity status she brings to a picture why would anyone hire her to direct when so many good directors are looking for their next project?W.E. is the story of Wallis Simpson, the American divorcee, and Edward, the next King of England, and their romance. Well for most the story would be about that. Instead Madonna puts a new twist on the story that's been told time and time again. And of course that twist is more lurid than most films choose to use.But rather than just stick with the one story we have another running first and alongside the famous romance. A young woman is trouble with her marriage to her husband and keeps coming back to an auction house selling off pieces of Simpson's past. What a great way to go back and forth in time and allow for some glimpses of newer lingerie.Its been said that the point of this film was less about presenting an historically accurate telling of the same tale once more but more about discussing celebrity and people's desire to have that notoriety. In the way this story is told that seems to be the only thing that interests Wallis Simpson. In an unhappy marriage (on her part at least) she seeks fame and attention. She wants the hoi paloi to take notice of her, to talk about her parties and her friendships. Edward comes off as little more than a party boy who goes from one woman to the next. I could be wrong but I think there was more to their story than that and using them to tell a story completely foreign to their real lives seems a bit much.  Rather than do so why not just use a fictional couple instead? Using historical figures involves viewers bringing with them the baggage of knowing what they know about them already. To try and present them as something else just causes confusion.But that's not the worst of it. The worst of it is that the film is completely boring. There are no characters to sympathize with, to care about or to feel involved with. Everyone is self serving and watching them prance about from one party to another is just tedious.One thing will result from this movie. Those who are die hard fans of Madonna will rise to the occasion and defend it as a work of art. They will attack anyone who dares try to say different. Fortunately this is a minority from the look of the box office results for this film as well as DVD sales. With any luck that will mean that Madonna will decide she's better off performing live, recording music or simply acting. Leave directing to those who know how to do it best.",W.E.

1297226,"""Planet Hulk"" was directed by Sam Liu based on the comic book by Greg Pak. In this story, the Hulk has been deported by Iron Man from Planet Earth via a space shuttle and crash lands on another planet. Once there he is captured, enslaved, and forced to compete in gladiator games.This story feels like a complete rip-off of the movie ""Gladiator"" directed by Ridley Scott in 2000. The Hulk is forced into combat in a series of fights, first with other slaves, then with big monsters and robots, then a very scary opponent in golden armor, before finally facing the Red King. When the Hulk starts gaining fame from the fans that he doesn't even want, the Red King hesitates to end his life fearing the reaction and by prolonging it, Hulk grows more popular and the people begin to regard him as their savior from legend.The Red King's main bodyguard is Caiera, found by him after her village was attacked by little spiders that make people into really spiky zombies. She is almost invincible and indestructible with a gift for battle but slowly has her doubts about the Red King's decisions, much like the Emperor's sister in ""Gladiator.""Beyond the obvious similarities, the character development remains very shallow for Hulk. He focuses on being angry, stubborn, and destructive throughout the story and we are given little insight into his motives. He just likes to smash things and is out for himself, not much of a team player. In a round table discussion with the other slaves that Hulk isn't a part of, two of them reveal a bit of their back stories since they are relevant to foreshadowing future events, but the other two do not.The movie feels like it has a really slow beginning and it took a while to really get into it. The battle sequences are excellent complete with green blood squirting out of the Hulk whenever someone manages to land a punch on him. Once his green blood makes contact with this planet's soil, little green plants grow making his comrades a little more tolerant of his behavior and less skeptical about claims of his savior-ness. By the last thirty minutes of the film, it grew more exciting and though it was very predictable, it had some satisfying moments nonetheless.This could be a good watch for your kids and the story will free fresh to them if they haven't seen ""Gladiator."" If you were only mildly interested in this movie, you can skip it. The story is very much the same with Marvel characters replacing them on an alien planet. However the ending might be different....",Planet Hulk
1295385,"Avatar is little more than a propaganda film to make Americans look bad.Why some Yanks spend money on this is beyond me.Avatar begins with the now VERY familiar premise that humanity has used all its natural resources and now must look elsewhere for its necessities.The 'futuristic' (Set in the year 2154) dialogue even contains the phrases ""shock and awe"" and ""daisy cutter"".  While ""American"" is never uttered, every word spoken by an evil ""human"" was in an ""American"" accent.The Blue People were so preposterously pure and the (American accent) earthlings so preposterously wicked. The whole tale was so simplistic, as events in history never are.It's essentially a remake of ""Dances With Wolves"" and every other movie where the evil Americans terrorize the indigenous natives, kill them, take their land, and are just all around imperialistically wicked and inhumane.  Oh, and we're destroying the environment, clearing precious giant trees and natural landscapes and killing rare animals and their habitats, in order to invade and harvest valuable substances under the ground.

Everyone else is doin' it!""  Yeah, but that doesn't mean YOU should do it. But, nevertheless, here it is a remake to Carpenter's 1980 classic that sucks like the biggest black hole with no ending in sight (""The Fog"" will land with a thud on DVD January 24th, 2006 in it's original PG-13 format or in an unrated format, either way the film still sucks).The plot is still the same: Antonio Island or Bay (take your pick) is celebrating its 125 years of existence. A new monument to the towns three founding fathers has been erected right out in front of town hall. But, their is an ominous backstory to the town's origins & the citizens of Antonio Island are going to pay for it with their very lives. An unholy fog has rolled onto shore mysteriously killing anyone in its path. Its up to the towns descendents to figure out the mystery of the fog before its too late.Carpenter is without a doubt one of the true masters of suspense & horror. With the 1980 original version to ""The Fog"" he brought a great ghost story to the screen with the right amount of atmosphere, suspense, & with his trademark score ""The Fog"" remains one of his best films.The remake, however, is a different story entirely. Its crap. Every single frame of this film sucks.The characters are two-dimensional & after seeing the original a few times over the years, I couldn't really visualize anyone else in these roles. Tom Welling, Selma Blair & the entire cast are an absolute waste. Blair doesn't have the purr that Adrienne Barbeau had as Stevie Wayne, Welling wasn't believable as Castle let alone a fisherman, & the Father Malone & Old Man Macon characters get little less than 5 minutes of screentime - combined.The tweaking of the original story is really lame. Did we really need to see the whole backstory of the Elizabeth Dane plotline? Hal Holbrook's, Father Malone did a perfect job of reading from his grandfather's diary with out the need of one flashback, or an extra tug from his drinking flask! Has American society become so fu**ing attention defecit disorientated that we need to have everything spelled out for us? Leave a lot to the imagination - it's more creepier that way.The ending is the worst insult to Carpenter fans. What in the hell were they thinking?!

It hopes its retro synth/prog-rock score scores some cool points. What is essentially a kernel of an idea is stretched to feature length, in a plot so marvelously dull that a major turning point can occur because a character randomly trips for no reason.

I own John Carpenters The Thing, Killer Klowns From Outer Space, Let The Right One In, Let Me In, Exorcist 1, Exorcist 3, Tales From The Crypt The Movie, and Series, The Evil Dead, Childs Play 1-3, and many others. Why did I make this list? Because I want to mention the fact that I LOVE HORROR MOVIES. But This franchise known as Paranormal Activity is crap. Part one consists of some lame noises, and a fire. Its barely worth your time if youve actually read up on the paranormal such as The Demonologist by Ed and Lorraine Warren. By the way I am an atheist, but even you can still enjoy the such a book, or another book such as Dark Sacrement, or a tv series like A Haunting for the fear factor. This movie invokes none of the fear that the TV show A Haunting, or the books I have mentioned does. Even the old music television show FEAR was scarier then this crap. You could enjoy the legends. If you want to be scared, go read one of the books ive mentioened. They have more books like that in the links section. If you want to see a lame bump in the night movie then this is it for you.

I know this film tried to be scarey and tried to give a reasonable explanation for why a doll is going around stabbing folks, but it didn't work.OK, Chucky is a doll possessed by some evil guy's soul thanks to some voodoo dude.  Already this is laughable.  So this doll, for no real reason, goes on this rampage of stabbing anybody it wants and laughing as he does it.  I mean, nothing is scarey about this.  One minute a woman is walking around in the house, the next thing you know there's this red-headed doll, in overalls, screaming and stabbing her.  Then after it does its butchering it scurries away laughing like a A-typical villain.Please, if I took my teddy bear, installed fake dracula fangs in its mouth and gave it a cattle prod as a weapon, my form of ""child's play"" would be much more scary.Not to mention the way this doll talks is funny.  It cusses, it makes these stupid grunts, and these ""one liners"" that does little to entertain you.  It would be far more entertaining if Chucky accidentally drowned himself in the washer or finds himself getting molested and torn to shreds by the family's super horny pet.And this is yet another monster movie where the monster won't die at the end.  That's right, you kill it, but it comes back.  You kill it again, think it's dead, but suddenly attacks you again around the corner.  Kill it again, think it's dead this time, but comes after you again.  Then when it dies, you think to yourself ""why am I watching this movie?""I'm sorry, nothing proves to be a bad movie than a monster that has to die a million different ways before the film can end.  I would rather have seen someone just flush Chucky down the toilet than have this stupid head lying on the carpet saying ""get them, get them!""

The film does not make any surprising moves, and in the process you just want it to get over with.Morgan Freeman plays a character that he has done well before. Alex Cross was much better in &quot;Kiss The Girls&quot;, but here he is just a flat photocopy of his character from that and from the incredible film &quot;Se7en&quot;. This is a character that Freeman can do well, given a script better than this one.The whole &quot;plot&quot; of the film consists of a kidnapping from a rich school. Monica Potter is someone who works there. She has taken the test to be and FBI agent, but she has failed. Freeman sees that she has some talent, so he allows her to tag along and try to help him catch the kidnapper. The plot is long and drawn out, with moments where we are all supposed to feel compassion as the characters spill their guts about their past, something that is in every thriller.This movie is just a rehash of other movies. Better movies. This is a film that is not well done, just downright irritating.

Once again, I found out that the service of a memory weighed in more than the actual quality of new product for fans easily subjected to a Jedi mind trick, again.This movie isn't better than ""Episode I"" or ""II"" - it's as bad or worse.  If you think more screen time for Hayden can help anything, the force runs kind of weak in you.Here's what we have:  a lot of chaotic action sequences stringing together the main plot point; Darth Vader turns to the Dark Side to save his wife and children, doomed to die at childbirth.We see how Darth Vader came to be.

But Hayden's acting, already horrible at best, sinks further and further into deliveries that would shame a high school student - just in time for the all-important transformation.

134987,"This film is about the personal and professional life of boxer Jake La Motta, played by Robert de Niro. It starts off with La Motta as an overweight comedian just before going on stage, in 1964, and finishes with him going on stage. The story unfolds from there on, starting in 1941.The troubled life of La Motta, from his relationships to his business deals, is shown in an unflinching manner. Martin Scorsese doesn't hold back. Every bit of violence is shown in the boxing ring and every bit outside it. Raging Bull is shot in classic black and white, reflecting the setting of the action. The close-ups, lighting, reminds me of great classical films but the depiction is all Scorsese. If it's Italian, got plenty of swearing, smart guys, pretty girls and violence it's bound to be Scorsese. Mind you, that's not a bad thing at all.La Motta's impatience, paranoia and way of dealing with things, is clearly shown, ruining his relationship with his second wife and, eventually, his brother,, played by Joe Pesci. De Niro plays the role to perfection as you feel the impact of La Motta's emotions.Raging Bull is one of my favourite films by Martin Scorsese because it's more realistic. It's the life of a real man, filled with mistakes and regrets. The viewer can relate in one way or another, but don't compare this to Rocky. Raging Bull packs small hands but heavy punches.",N/A

I knew a good bit about Psycho the novel, and a little on the making of the movie.  This film just filled in the pieces for me.My complaint isn't with the film, but rather with how the DVDs were packaged.  If you own a regular DVD player, the only way to see the film is to buy the Blue Ray Edition with the regular DVD included.  You therefore pay a higher cost for the movie.  Then, when you search for extras on the DVD, the only thing you find are trailers for other movies.  All the extras are on the Blue Ray Edition, and you can't watch a Blue Ray disc in a regular DVD player, so you're screwed.I won't fall for this type of marketing again.

1573155,"Werewolves are by far my favorite kind of monsters, and unfortunately there are very few actually good werewolf movies. This is definitely not one of them. Usually when a movie goes straight to video thats usually a pretty good sign that its going to be bad. I gave this movie a chance simply because it had werewolves and I usually give every werewolf movie a shot but, all in all, this movie is just as bad as you probably think its going to be. The story is bad, especially the ending which feels cheesy and teeny-bopper Twilight inspired or something. The acting is bad, and the script is absolutely the worst. You can tell by the cast as they try to deliver their lines that they know their lines are awful and the movie is going to be awful. The CGI werewolf in this movie is also very bad (but that is expected with a straight to video release).So, I would suggest staying away from this movie. If you are looking for a good werewolf movie I would stick with Silver Bullet (in my opinion the best werewolf movie of all time), The Howling, The Wolfman (1941), or The Wolfman (2010).Edit 11/1/12: After seeing the director's cut of The Wolfman (2010) I can now say that is my favorite werewolf movie.

405782,"I'm thinking, &quot;What if I didn't waste time watching this trash, disguised as entertainment?&quot; Would I have done something more productive? I think, yes. Even if I spent the entire time banging my head against the wall for the whole time, it would have been a far better endeavor than watching this trash.While ultimately this film tries to make you think about tolerating the opinion of the next person, it conducts its' lesson by creating conservative stereotypes as manifested by left-wingers. So if the roles had been reversed, liberals would be screaming about this film years later. But since the Hollywood community is controlled by left-wingers, you don't hear a peep out of anyone in that industry about the horrible personalities created by this film.The sad thing is that the characters created in this film are really how Hollywood sees conservatives. Left-wingers actually create these people and truly believe that this is the way conservatives think and act. Of course, conservatives don't think and act as depicted in this film but left-wingers don't understand this point. This is the main reason why liberalism is a dying idealogy in the U.S. It's an idealogy that just doesn't get it. It creates enemies that don't exist and in fighting these imaginary enemies, their real opponents walk away the victor.This might have been a good film if the &quot;conservatives&quot; in the film were real. That their opinions were those of real conservatives. But the problem would have been that the liberal characters would have been seen in a far worse light than just murderers; they would have been seen as irrational lunatics that can't see reason. And that's not what the director was trying to show. The idea was to show liberals as being well-intentioned yet mistaken in their methods.If they had done the film correctly, conservatives would be invited to supper, they would have explained real-world thinking to the liberals, and the liberals would have killed the conservatives simply because they could not grasp what mainstream America already embraces as its' philosophy. But, again, this would have taken the film in too far of a supportive perspective of conservatives and that's certainly not acceptable to the producers of this poorly conceived tripe.",Last Supper VHS
797579,"I had heard some truly wonderful things about this movie and was looking forward to watching it. Mona Lisa Smile tells the story of a professor (Julia Roberts) who starts teaching Art History, or Appreciation, or something at Wellesley (an all-girls school). There are several big name young actresses-I mean students in her class. And they're all know-it-alls.The movie wants to be the ""girls' version of Dead Poet's Society"" so bad that the creators of DPS should be looking into a slander lawsuit because it is insulting what they do to what was originally a really good movie. Katherine Watson (Roberts) came to Wellesley to make a difference and she was not going to take no for an answer. So, when the actresses-I mean students outsmart her, she has to make the class more difficult. Because I guess they're not *really* learning until Watson has taught them. And Watson is not going to just teach them about Art. No. She's gonna teach them about *life* and that they don't have to get married and have babies. They can be whatever they want because they are soooo smart. And if they want to get married and have babies, then they're just in denial. Because Watson knows everything! Sadly, no one dies unlike in the original DPS.There's the antagonist, Betty Warren (Kirsten Dunst), who hates Watson, but in the end, loves her the most. The protagonist, Joan Brandwyn (Julia Stiles), who respects Watson, but in the end teaches Watson a life lesson. The morally ambivalent wanna-be, Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who wants to be Watson. And the ""ugly, fat girl"", Connie Baker (Ginnifer Goodwin), who just wants to be liked by a boy.Most of the acting was very cardboard. I am not sure whether to blame this on the script, the director, or the actors. Julia Roberts looked exactly the same as she has looked in her past 5 movies. Same ""smile"" theme, same bursting laugh, same ""unliked-girl"" who really is a pretty woman (ha!) deep down. She's turning into Meg Ryan by picking the same character over and over again.Kirsten Dunst's character was a little too whiney and in the end, when Betty Warren does the ""morphosis"", it is not believable. Even if it was believable, then we wouldn't really care because the way she was portrayed would be akin to feeling sympathy for Atilla the Hun.Julia Stiles was the only one whose character seemed to remain consistant. I am not sure if this is because of her acting or because the script didn't call for a ""character evolution"". Either way, Joan was still boring and lifeless.Maggie Gyllenhaal is beautiful and sexy and boy is Giselle a sexually free spirit in this movie. Hmm...Secretary, anyone? But, I'm not sure what they were trying to do with that student-teacher relationship/affair thing. Maybe I fell asleep and missed it.For the life of me I could not figure out why they thought Ginnifer Goodwin's character was fat or ugly so, we'll just ignore her because her character has no conflict!For that matter, nothing at all anywhere in this entire movie does...Oh, did I fail to point out that the title is mentioned throughout the movie at least eleventy-billion times?

469718,"While this movie has an R rating and supposedly is not to be seen by anyone under 18, it was made for the 14-16 year old.  The only reason it  would have an R rating is language, and that did become offensive after  about the 200th repetition of &quot;F---.&quot; The movie is flawed from  first to last, but the worst fault is the fact that there is not one  sympathetic figure among the participants, and one starts hoping the witch  will get them quickly and painfully, starting with the foul-mouthed,  egotistical girl.  When there is no one to care about, it becomes nigh  impossible to care about the movie itself.  Now, perhaps the 15-year old  will be much taken with how wonderful this all is (and how &quot;just  f---ing uncool,&quot; I am, to borrow a much repeated term from the film),  but any mature person should find this a  colossal bore.

It isn't fun, it isn't sexy, it isn't witty, it isn't charming...it just isn't.  The action is problematic in that it doesn't do anything we haven't already seen countless times before, and the chemistry between the two stars is borderline non-existent.  I haven't seen the original yet (although I will one day, considering my Hepburn adoration) and so I cannot compare, but I hope it has more substance and style than this one.  The plot just hangs there here, and the way it is strung along doesn't draw the audience in.  I expected more from Demme, who has proven himself a capable director...and then again, he has also proven himself inconsistent.  This is probably the worst thing he's ever done, and when you consider that it's one of the worst films of the past decade then it really says a lot for Demme's taste level.

Spike Lee must have had a hard time translating the original, brilliant, psychologically disturbing version.  So he decided to ramp up the incest theme, the violence and the gore, all in all reducing it to another sub-par thriller. On a related note, one of the best production elements in the original is a long single take fight scene.  Not content with that, in Lee's version the protagonist (Josh Brolin) beats up five hulking rugby (?) players without breaking a sweat and then takes on about 25 hoodlums at once and puts them all down.  So he has mad skills.  Then when the plot calls for it, a female bodyguard drops him with two moves. Later on two thugs manhandle him without a problem.  What the heck?

549602,"I am a real fan of Anne of Green Gables and all of LMM's works, so like many others I was looking forward to seeing this movie.  I knew they departed from LMM's books, but I was shocked to find out how much.  The story is loosely based on the last book in the Anne series, ""Rilla of Ingleside"", about Anne's youngest daughter during the First World War.  Being the only North American woman's written account of the war, it is a very famous book, and although fiction, has historical value.  In the book Anne & Gibert are middle-aged and the book centers around their young adult children, but the movie has Anne searching for Gilbert on the battle lines!  Of course Anne has a flirtation along the way even though she and Gilbert are married.  What were LMM's descendants thinking when they allowed this movie to be made!?The first two movies are splendid and are true to LMM's characters in ways that the third movie is not.  Although poetic license was used, especially in the 1st sequel, they went a bit further in this second sequel.  Anne didn't seem like Anne.  Gilbert and Diana were so thin they were almost unrecognizable.  How different was Megan Follows as Anne?  One of my friends commented to me that she had seen the movie and actually was under the impression that the actor who played Anne was not Megan Follows!!I think the most unforgiveable thing to me is how they portrayed Anne & Gilbert's wedding, which was so beautiful in the book ""Anne's House of Dreams""!My hope is that if Sullivan productions tackles such a project again that they present ""Anne's House of Dreams"", a wonderful story, and stick to the words that made LMM famous!  Hopefully it is possible to re-do Anne & Gilbert's wedding!",Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story VHS

Besides that, Universal most of the time indeed does have english subtitles, so I mailed to Amazon if someone could look at the back of the Blu ray to see if it had english subtitles after all. The answer I got was ""if it is not mentioned on our site you must wait for the next release of this item, perhaps that will have subtitles"". Not very satisfying, I immediately answered that I was not satisfied and why they didn't take the little trouble to look at the Blu raywhat was correct. No more answer.

The effects are not even that great and not even halfway believable.""The only thing that attracted me to this movie was the trailer, which, as it turns out, was the best part of the movie.Lines like, ""There are more things to do with books than burning them"" are just annoying and uncalled for and would make any lover of literature cringe, even under the circumstances that the books were being burned.

1344997,"This movie was awful, and I mostly stuck through it to see just how awful it could be.We have disjointed sequences, cutting from one location to another while a character is still talking, what seem to be thoughts about conversations and events in the past while other things are going on, people appearing wherever they need to be without any apparent motion.At the end, we get a chase thru Manhattan. First, our heroines decide to hide around the corner after running through what seemed like several blocks. Never mind the taxis. Then it's go to Chinatown, and take the subway. What? One of the pursuers appears on the train from nowhere? Better jump out. Now we're in Chinatown. But the pursuers get a tip that the ladies are there. Good thing Chinatown is a single block on Canal St, and that it takes zero time for the bad guys to show up at either end of the block. Hey, let's hop in a store! Why didn't we think of that until now? Who cares? But since Chinatown is a single block, the bad guys at either end spot the shop they go in.But they use cunning disguises and suddenly appear in Grand Central Station. Gee, why didn't they hop in a cab and go to Grand Central right away? Couldn't have a chase then. Now they're concerned about airports. So they logically get on Metro North, which doesn't go to an airport. PATH to NJ would get them to NWK. Subway and bus would get them to LGA or JFK. And a taxi would take them to any airport they wanted. Which is what they should have done 20 minutes earlier.Screw it, let's end with a pointless drawn out sequence of the ladies sitting in the Metro North train while it chugs up the Hudson River. Forget about a subway to the Bronx and a turn-around to Queens where the airports are. Forget about hopping off for a taxi. That probably wouldn't work, though, because the bad guys can teleport to wherever they may be as long as they stay in Manhattan.Seriously one of the most contrived and idiotic sequences I've seen in a long time. All logic, all time, all space, all is warped to fit the screenplay, the terrible screenplay.",N/A
1011578,"You can't copyright a title.  Therefore, it occasionally happens that two movies with the same title appear that are unassociated with each other.  Such is the case with The Covenant, which came out twice in around a year, both times as horror movies.  I can't comment on the latter release (having not seen it), but my guess based on watching the earlier Covenant is that version two is probably the better of the two.  It would be hard to be worse.This first movie stars Edward Furlong as David Goodman (he's essentially a good man, get it?), a political public relations guy who is gifted at his job and has an inexplicably devoted hot blonde wife.  I say inexplicable, because even early in the movie, he comes off as weaselly and banal, hardly one to attact such a woman, let alone have her head-over-heel in love with him.  Ah, well, love is blind, and soon he is also, the victim of a criminal act.Fortunately, he is offered a chance at getting his sight restored by Michael Madsen, a villainous sort who gives David a demonic cane that restores his vision and also turns him evil (or rather, feeds on David's naturally evil tendencies).  This leads to murders and other crimes, while David's wife investigates the origin of the cane.  All of which leads to a climax that is silly and derivative.Done correctly, this could have been a good movie, but instead, we get a bunch of standard movie cliches.  When a car catches fire, it, of course, explodes with that strange triple blast that only happens in bad movies.  When the wife is told by a professor that he has discovered important information and ""Come see me"" (because apparently he is incapable of saying any more over the phone), of course, he is dead by the next scene.Beyond the cliches, the writing itself is dumb from the very start:  in the prologue, we see Madsen's character retrieve a cane that is being held in a church.  Despite the obvious dangers of the artifact, it is only guarded by an ancient priest and isn't even hidden.  The rest of the plot is riddled with idiocies, but it is wrong to criticize the movie merely based on the plot.  The direction and dialogue are equally bad (and the effects are barely passable and display the low budget this film clearly has), but probably the biggest failing is Furlong himself, who cannot even begin to carry the picture;  he has neither the presence nor talent.Clearly, if you make it through this movie, you'll realize it is really just a cheap rip-off of The Devil's Advocate.  Keanu Reeves may never win best actor, but he is light years ahead of Furlong in his ability to star in a movie.  Similarly, Charlize Theron is easily superior to her counterpart (whose name I have already forgotten) in this movie, and Michael Madsen is not close to Al Pacino in his ability to ham it up.  So if you want to see The Covenant done right, see The Devil's Advocate instead.  Or if you want to see The Devil's Advocate (or horror movies in general) done wrong, watch this film.",N/A

Crude and brutal though at moments of action and dialogue, there's also strong man-hating theme.  Was this the attraction for Ms Basinger?The characters are poorly written and their motivations are obscure.In the very beginning, Basinger's character seems -- very clearly -- mentally unwell.  But she is also verbally and kind-of physically abused by her understandably frustrated husband.  Is Basinger's character supposed to be on medication?  She seems to be in a stupor at the start of the movie.  Or does she sit around the messy house all day drinking?  Something's not right.  But it's Christmas Eve.  So she goes out to buy wrapping paper and encounters some murderous thugs.  The thugs are ethnically diverse.There's no subtext here and the movie does not deliver the visceral thrills that demented fans (not me) of slasher films apparently crave.A sad exercise in hostility.  It won't make your holidays brighter (I guess it's a Christmas movie).Side step this one.NOTE: Some viewers have speculated this film is really about Ms Basinger's personal feelings regarding men in general and one man in particular.

1021124,"While each version of Jane Eyre has its weak and strong points, this one irritates with changes from the book that are not helpful or particularly pleasing.  The more I watch successive editions of this novel over the years, the more I am annoyed with Rochester, finding him teasing and false, extremely self-centered and self-pitying and correspondingly heartless to others.  However, all of that are dominant parts of his persona initially, though he does grow through Jane's influence.  In this farce, the negatives are quite irksomely prominent, adding a whining tone, without the finer man element.  This Jane seemed to just wriggle all over for this insulting male attention, without the convincing evolution of seeing beyond the outer faults to inner qualities.  If that was even attempted to be portrayed, it certainly got lost somewhere in this modernization effort.The unhelpful departures weaken Jane (she breaks down and actually wails childishly and pathetically to him over her disappointed feelings at one point - NOT).  This effort sickeningly emphasizes Rochester's manipulative toying with her. When I saw the cover pictures of the actors, I thought they found a truly ugly Rochester, which he is supposed to be, but with redeeming character qualities.  Where were these?  Sorry, any fans of Stephens, but to me he needed the makeup to mitigate that gravely, pock marked face. It was not appropriate for Jane, though this cow certainly needed help.  Rochester is usually portrayed (more successfully) as a large man.  Instead, the miscast Jane here is actually the larger, more well nourished figure.  This Rochester is the one who looks under-nourished.  The thing is miscast throughout, including the mangy dog!There is a good laugh in here, the invented bed scene, disgusting between two unattractive persons for one thing.  Stephens works her over to her yielding pants, then proposes going away and living together as brother and sister. He avers he would not think of compromising her -- ""I wouldn't do that.""  Again, a laugh for its utter absurd contradiction and stupidity.  The thing was crude as well. Just another example of weakening and cheapening a classic, I guess so modern day viewers could relate or pay their money for the extra juice or some other boneheaded misfired non starter.Without being a strident purist, in final analysis, I honestly think the departures played against this version's authenticity even as a film.  They seemed to think they knew better, but I did not find it so.  Not a pleasing version to me at all for foundational reasons.  Actually, this attempt is another example of trying to update to modern day mores and customs. In my opinion and experience, these compromises always fail -- especially when dealing with a merited classical work.  They certainly failed here. Failed adaptation - failed movie.

1551039,"Michael Biehn what the hell happened to your career?  I mean, seriously, bro, you were in Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, Tombstone, even The Seventh Sign, and now this?  Dude, if you're hoping for a Mickey Rourke comeback, doing D-level dreck like this is not the way to go.I should've known I was in serious trouble by the cheap looking title sequence as well as seeing Biehn's name listed four times.  Did you miss a credit?  Like, maybe scoring or make up or key grip?  But I'm a sucker for punishment, I guess so I went with it.  At $5, I might have just covered this movie's whole production value.So we have these two easy girls Annie (Jennifer Blanc-Biehn, yup the ultimate couch test: marrying the director) and Mary (Danielle Harris, Halloween, Urban Legend) who are out ""partying"" (ie: smoking dope and having sex) in the woods with two cops.  But when Mary is accidentally killed during sex, our two hot blooded lotharios scramble to coverup the crime and eliminating the only witness, Annie.  But Annie overhears this plan and makes good her escape.  She ends up at a lone cabin in the woods where Kyle (Biehn) is shunning the rest of the civilized world.  And this is where the fun is suppose to begin if this movie wasn't as bad as it was.Faults are plenty here.  The biggest one is casting.  Seriously, I don't know what strip club Biehn met Jennifer Blanc in but putting her in the leading roll was a travesty on your part.  She is no Sherry Moon.  This girl can't act; plain and simple.  At one point, she is lying on the floor of the cabin, sobbing as if somebody had just made her Sophie's Choice her children, yet when we see her face as she is wailing, not a single tear.  Not even her eyeliner is running.  Strike One.Which leads to character development.  First off, there is none.  All the main rolls here are as flat as the roads in Kanas.  And we all know that movies of this sort requires characters we are suppose to care for and would like to see come out stronger in the end.  They don't exist here.  Annie and Mary willingly put themselves in the situation.  And while Annie has just met one of the guys, this doesn't stop her from going down on this guy while Mary is having her thin, brittle little neck snapped.  Now, I'm no prude but how much can you like a character who does this?  Yes, I know that there are people like this out there in the world but that is why we usually find their stories being told on The First 48.  People rarely bat an eye when they go missing or turn up dead.  And Annie even winds up in Kyle's bed moments after coming back from trying to find Marry's body.  You would think that she would've learned her lesson but nope, not her.  Strike Two.The last straw here is the whole third act and the so called twist ending.  While violent as it is, since you haven't invested any personality into the characters, you really don't care that they are killed so there really is no payoff.  And the twist can be seen coming a mile away.  All in all, an epic fail.  Biehn, I hope you find your career again or, at least, a noble retirement.  Associating yourself with this so called Revitalized Grindhouse Filmmaking (as in, cheap movies with no redeeming reason to be made or seen by the masses) is not the way you want to go.

She is constantly running after Captain Wentworth (and not only in the last ten minutes, what about the concert scene?). I also much preferred the older Captain Wentworth (played by Ciaran Hinds). He seemed to show a lot more emotion while still staying true to Wentworth's steely character. Finally, why on earth was this one cut so short?

Halfway through ""Children"" I was so bored I began googling the names of old high school classmates just to pass the time. The biggest problem I have with the movie is the spouses of Kate Winslet & Patrick Wilson. Winslet's husband is an internet-porn addicted loser and Wilson's (Jennifer Connelly) is a shrew who cares more about her work and her child than she does her husband. By portraying the spouses this way Field basically gives Winslet and Wilson a free pass to commit adultery which removes the elements of moral dilemma, suspense, and drama from their actions. Jackie Earle Haley's character, rather than being sympathetic, is just a loser, much like the spouses, so we don't really care about him either.

Freakshow stumbles along on a tightrope-thin plot vaguely circling around a group of workers planning to make off with a load of money by sending an unbridled tramp to seduce a circus master with laughably fake boils on his face.Try as you might, there's hardly a coherent plot to be found anywhere in this tedious botch job of a horror movie. Dirty sex abounds throughout, but for the most part, it ends up disturbing more than tittilating.This film advertises itself as being ""banned in 43 countries"". That's a good gimmick really. Until you realize that it was probably banned for being a meaningless jumble of adolescent pseudo-horror thrown together in a jumble by a few producers trying to make a buck off of exploiting the idea that they are using ""REAL FREAKS"". There are no sideshow types in this film. There is a midget, a man with no legs, a man with no arms, a big bald guy, a latexed Elephant Man ripoff, an Amazonian porn star, a guy with hair glued to his face (dogman), and a half-man/half-woman... none of these are ""freaks"" per se.Overall this movie is tremendously disappointing, and I'd like to help prevent future viewers of this movie from coming anywhere near it because it really is the lowest form of filmmaking to be so pretentious as to use a gimmick like the phrase ""freak"" to sell a hodge-podge of bad acting, cheesy gore, and hastily thrown together murder scenes.The murders are not interesting, the sex scenes are awkward, the gore is fake looking, and the script will leave you wanting to stick hooks into your own skin.The DVD has several special features, which are just as painful to watch as the film itself. The only cool part of the entire DVD is watching the man with no arms drive with his feet in a behind the scenes featurette. And that's only a few seconds.Please don't buy this movie. Don't even rent it. You will regret it. No matter how much you think you might be interested in this, I can promise that you won't be.

I suggest you bypass this garbage and get something that pulls off the ""so offensive it's interesting"" genre, like Bloodsucking Freaks or pretty much any John Waters film.As a final note, I'd like to point out that Freakshow is a remake of the 1932 horror film Freaks, and while the original is exciting and surprisingly interesting even today, Freakshow is a terribly executed remake vaguely following the original plot but tossing in needless sex and violence, and confusing the story to the point of being nonsensical.",N/A

551630,"The use of present-tense verbs to describe events from the past is now commonplace in our post-literate age, especially by historians when talking down to lay people. This script does that, and worse. Consider this excerpt: ""In the 1950s, travel to the Moon is about to become possible because of the rocket. Long used as a weapon, the rocket is the only engine that can be used in a vacuum."" That's not true, and it's the kind of falsehood that sometimes happens when adults over-simplify their subject for children.Or this one: ""But when future generations look back, they may be surprised to learn why men first went to the Moon, because the ancient dream of exploration had almost nothing to do with what was called Project Apollo."" The script reveals that the true motive was to beat the Russians. How typical of Nova to be so condescending to its audience as to assume we have no understanding of the political context. And the truth is that Apollo had a great deal to do with the dream of exploration.Or this one: ""In 1968 men first left the Earth for the Moon. Millions of people watched their journey on television, but scarcely a handful knew how it really began."" Oh, so fewer than six people knew how Apollo 8 really began. Nonsense.Or this one: ""For an astronaut to survive there [in space], he'll need the protection of a spacecraft, or capsule. Even a small capsule will need a huge rocket to put it in space."" Sounds like they are talking to small children.Or this one: ""Lost between the pioneering flights of Mercury and the lunar triumph of Apollo was the program that found the answers. It was called Gemini. Nearly forgotten today, Gemini was the essential step to the Moon."" Lost and forgotten by whom? I sure didn't lose it, and I'll never forget it. I wish Nova would stop making things up and stick to the truth. In what sense was Gemini more essential than the other steps?Nova has it that few people know the true motive behind Apollo, or the true beginnings of Apollo 8, or even the existence of the Gemini phase. But Nova knows. Nova always has the answers, and we are children sitting at their feet, grateful for any bits of knowledge they deem to hand down.The DVD includes the commercials that air at the start of every episode of Nova. I would say that's an indicator of the low esteem Nova has for its audience.",NOVA - To the Moon

BOY WAS I DISSAPOINTED ! ! !The issue here is; Seth Rogan and the movie plot. Obviously Seth Rogan either never saw the original series, or he just likes to pervert a Classic.Jay Chou has presence and is a decent actor. He Steals the show but other than that, the fat arrogant "" Bitch-Boy "" Seth Rogan totally ruins the movie. Jay Chou has class and should never act again with the immature little boy Seth. Jay Chou isn't Bruce Lee but he'll do in a pinch.I remember the original actors as having a lot of class and they never, never, ever had arguments or fought with each other, nor did the Green Hornet ever talk down to Kato as Seth Rogan does numerous times in this movie, to Jay Chou, the Kato character in this movie.For those of you who have never seen the series, there is a fairly new T.V. channel that shows old classics, "" MeTV "" and they are currently showing "" The Green Hornet "" on Saturday Mornings.  If you want to watch a great classic from that time period, I recommend you watch it. You will enjoy it.

1692676,"I can think of two reasons to watch a TV series: I enjoy the characters (either like or dislike them, or both) and become interested in what happens to them (The Simpsons comes to mind); or something about the series arouses a more or less sexual response in me. Sports bore me to death, but I loved Friday Night Lights because so many of the guys were gorgeous. This series neither entertains me nor turns me on.I'm a gay male, and nothing about the female body or female sexuality excites me; in fact, it turns me off. So just the idea of a women's prison doesn't automatically get my juices flowing, and the abundant nudity and sex in this series leaves me cold and irritated. On top of that, every single character in this series is annoying, from the leads to the very least of the supporting roles.Piper Chapman is so obnoxious that she deserves far worse than what she gets here; I'd keep watching if I thought she'd eventually (hoping for sooner rather than later) get bumped off, but I know she won't. Her loser boyfriend isn't even sexy, which would be my only hope in a scenario like this.A Jewish nerd is pretty much my ideal man, but there's something very creepy about Jason Biggs (he isn't Jewish, for one thing) that negates any appeal the character might have. There aren't even any real villains I can hate, just dozens of petty, stupid, ugly, obnoxious jerks, who spend all their time posing and snarling.By the time I had struggled through the first two episodes, the ""So what?"" factor was so overwhelming that I gave up.

1554733,"Mary Shelly&#8217;s Frankenstein is one of the most easily recognizable characters in the history of storytelling.  Developed in 1818, Frankenstein will likely never be more appreciated than he is in his novelized form.  Over the years, there have been countless film incarnations of the character, the most prominent of which can be found in films that include The Curse of Frankenstein (portrayed by Christopher Lee), Young Frankenstein (portrayed by Peter Boyal) or in one of the more film variations, Mary Shelly&#8217;s Frankenstein (portrayed by Robert De Niro).  And, it was obviously only a matter of time before someone decided to create yet another re-envisioning of the character &#8211; which comes in the form of the new film, I, Frankenstein.From the producers (and a handful of others) that brought us the Underworld saga, Frankenstein &#8211; directed by Stuart Beattie (Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, Australia) &#8211; stars Aaron Eckhart as Frankenstein&#8217;s monster, Adam.  Upon his initial awakening, the monster doesn&#8217;t see eye-to-eye with his creator Victor Frankenstein (Aden young), inevitably leading to Victor&#8217;s death.  Doing the commendable thing, Adam decides to bury his creator &#8211; but is randomly attacked by a group of demons, and then saved by a group of gargoyles.It&#8217;s at this point that Adam learns from the head of the gargoyle order, Leonore (Miranda Otto), the world is more than it seems, and there&#8217;s a war going on between Heaven (gargoyles) and Hell (demons).  Feeling isolated and without anyone to guide him, Adam wonders the world for hundreds of years &#8211; constantly being hunted by the demons, on orders from their leader, Prince Naberius (Bill Nighy).  Posing as a wealthy industry leader going by the name Charles Wessesx, Prince Naberius is secretly relying on the work of a brilliant doctor, Terra (Miranda Otto), to solve the lost incarnation formula of Victor Frankenstein &#8211; with the intent to re-animate his army in waiting.In the modern day, humans are oblivious to the creatures that are living among them.  Adam, who is constantly being hunted by demons, decides to go on the offensive by eliminating them on his own.  However, during a battle, the death of human quickly leads to the gargoyles (protectors of man) decision to apprehend Adam and confine him for the good of humanity.  Now knowing the location of Adam, Naberius sends an army to apprehend him &#8211; putting Adam right in the middle of a brewing war between two very different sides of which he is both skeptical.Looking at I, Frankenstein as a standalone film is difficult since it resembles the Underworld films so closely.  This storyline basically replaces the gun-toting, leather-drenched Kate Beckinsale with a fit, stick-wielding Aaron Eckhart.  Naturally, if I had to choose &#8211; Beckinsale had much more appeal, but it&#8217;s not as though the Underworld films were anything special, either.  The franchise went on far longer than it probably should have, featuring a yawn-worthy drawn out war between vampires and werewolves, while I, Frankenstein features a similar premise &#8211; only with gargoyles and demons.  After Underworld: Awakening was released, rumors spread that the Underworld franchise was dead, so apparently the producers have thrown in the towel (for now) with the hopes that this film catches on.  But, to be honest, they shouldn&#8217;t hold their breath&#8230;Obviously, Aaron Eckhart&#8217;s most notable role to date is in playing Two-Face in The Dark Knight, and since then he&#8217;s really failed to do much to build off that role of lifetime.  He&#8217;s starred in Battle: Los Angeles and Olympus Has Fallen &#8211; both gaudy and forgettable.  Now, after playing a glorified, one-dimensional Frankenstein in a film that was doomed to fail from the get-go, it won&#8217;t help his cause in the future for acquiring significant roles.  Eckhart undoubtedly trained extensively for this role, but even with all of the action in this flick, there are still very few moments where Eckhart is able to showcase his acting ability.  Sadly, his version of a Frankenstein is nothing but an epic bore.While Eckhart was anything but memorable, his nemesis in the film &#8211; portrayed by Bill Nighy, was supremely enjoyable.  Nighy, who was also a villain in the majority of the Underworld films, plays a similar character here.  His demeanor is just so powerful and creepy that you can&#8217;t help but love him every time he plays the bad guys (which is more often than not).  His character quickly establishes himself as a man to be fear, and he sets the battle-centric tone that dominates the majority of the plot.Even though the cast is relatively expendable (meaning anyone could have done their job), the special effects are the standout achievement.  The beautiful darkness of the city, mixed with the explosiveness of the creatures (both gargoyle and demon) are surprisingly eye-pleasing, making the battle sequences the only part of the film that doesn&#8217;t make you want to check your watch or implore you to refill your popcorn.  Speaking of visuals, Eckhart looks far too much like Aaron Eckhart and not enough like a monster that was created from eight different corpses.  His voice and attire could have both gone in a better, creepier direction.  After all, Frankenstein should be scary &#8211; yet if I ran into Kate Beckinsale in a back alley, I&#8217;d be far more afraid of her than Eckhart&#8217;s version of Frankenstein.Overall, I, Frankenstein is handicapped right out of the gate by the fact that it resembles the Underworld franchise &#8211; which never really established itself as a commanding set of films to begin with.  This version of Frankenstein is mostly cartoon-ish, and not what you&#8217;d expect Frankenstein to be in the least.  Director Stuart Beattie shouldn&#8217;t even bare any of the blame when this film tanks because this script had bad news written all over it before production even started.  But, if Kate Beckinsale&#8217;s Selene character popped out during the credits and was preparing to face-off with Eckhart, maybe then this film would have generated a little excitement.  Unfortunately, that doesn&#8217;t happen and I, Frankenstein will no doubt land in whatever dark void bad movies go to after they tank at the box office.GRADE:  D+FNDNreview.com",N/A

This film does have a young and enthusiastic cast and there  are  good performances  from most of them.  There are the usual problems with the  script. Many of the cast look too old to  be  students at  High School. There are  also the usual  clich&eacute;s with the casting. Have one Asian and one African-American  in the  main cast  just to satisfy  people who think that  there are too many  Caucasians  and not enough  coloured people. Why weren't there more. varied  races in the cast? Let's face it . Do Caucasians make up the majority of  students in  High Schools in Los Angeles? A more multi-racial and  coloured cast  would seem more natural. The casting in the film truly discriminates in this respect. Everyone on the cast are good looking  and look like they come from  wealthy families. Not a true  representation of  the  American population.

1154127,"THE LAST WINTER (2006, not to be confused with the 100 other works of the same title) is a reminder to me why we don't watch just anything. I review it--such as this review may be--as an object lesson in lousy cinematic time-wasting. I imagine lots of money went into this stupid thing as well.Ron Perlman (HELLBOY I & II) who is a red flag all in himself, leads an unremarkable cast of dorks scouting for oil-drilling spots in Alaska. At least I think it is supposed to be Alaska, I missed a bit of the beginning of this tepid piece of excrement. The crew is doing the will of God by seeking and exploiting the terrific oil-getting opportunities where they are stationed........But the earth is apparently going to fight back, in the form of the Wendigo, a/k/a Chinoo. According to my understanding, the Wendigo is Sasquatch only uglier and meaner. Some Native tribes say it is a spirit...I guess the ghost of a bigger, meaner Bigfoot. The Chinoo, which in this film is also named as a possible culprit for the evil goings-on, may be a pathetic attempt at citing the Chinook Tribe (unless that is what the film meant to do, I can't actually tell). I know the ""Chinooks"" as a wind blowing down from the Rockies in Colorado, it usually blows away all traces of the first snow each year.Apparently the lesson here is the earth will fight back if you desecrate it. Well, this is your standard B-flick and it royally sucks. The dialogue is hilariously bad and the camera work is LSD-influenced as usual. It isn't even a good global warming message, it simply spooks one minute and grosses us out the next minute.Of course, I was taken with the character of Maxwell, played by the sexy Zach Gilford (DARE); I was mesmerized by his incredible body, which was also obviously loved by the camera. Gilford's hometown is not far from mine. It angered me that he was the first to go nuts and die. It's his corpse we see on the DVD cover art. Bit of a streak of necrophilia here, anyone?--I told, you, sick, sick, sick.Don't waste a second on this maddening, pointless movie.

518513,"Though stylish and well crafted, it would be hard to find a more disingenuous, manipulative, and hideous movie than Fight Club.  Imagine a film that showed beautiful people eating a fabulous, decadent meal, savoring every luscious mouthful - then, five minutes before the end, a spokesman for the American Heart Association came on screen with a warning that high fat foods cause heart attacks.  Or, imagine a film showing scantily clad women in provocative poses until, five minutes before the end, a representative from N.O.W. came on screen and warned that we live in a sexist society and, simply by watching this trash, viewers are validating her point.  Such is the awe-inspiring hypocrisy of Fight Club, a film that purports to be a cautionary tale about violence but is in fact a tutorial in it.The basic premise, that urban man has lost touch with his inner Neanderthal, is an interesting one, and would have served as the basis of a good movie.  To see how a better director approached the idea of innate violence, revisit Clockwork Orange, a masterpiece that director Fincher (Se7en - a much better movie) has certainly studied.  Kubrick's chilling adaptation of the Burgess novel came complete with skinheads, one of many similarities between the two works.  The second act of Fight Club is an orgy of brute violence with absolutely no redeeming qualities, and the third act offers one of the shabbiest, cheapest, and stupidest ""reveals"" - or ""aha"" moments - in the history of recent film.  Ed Norton is a really fine actor, but his performance is wasted.  Brad Pitt, by contrast, doesn't get beaten up nearly enough to redeem this abomination.

450286,"Ok, here's some mind-blowing news that the director might not have figured out. Disco was an African American and gay music. Another fact that he might not know - Studio 54 was run by a Jewish homosexual. Fact # 3 - you can't have a long conversation in a New York City club because it's too loud to hear anything you say. You have to shout everything and the best you can hope for is a nod and a smile before it becomes too unbearable for words.Yet somehow Stillman decided to portray disco in the same way he portrayed Upper East Side private club like a salon like environment peopled almost exclusively by wealthy white people pontificating on nonsense and cartoons, all the while wonder if their upper class white privilege is justified (short answer - why yes it is). There's some disco playing, but it's happily playing at low volumes in the background just so you know that it's about disco. There's not much of a story here but what passes for a sub-plot is stolen whole cloth from the travails of Studio 54 including the unfortunate hubris that would lead the club owners to brag about all the money they were ferreting away from the IRS that would lead to a raid that would find that money and the cocaine.What ultimately kills this movie is the fact that it's unbearably dull. No one has any passion or interest beyond talking about trivialities (the Scrooge McDuck conversation gets heavy rotation) and in the end, one of the bland characters says that disco is really fun and great. And then they go on the subway and start dancing the white man's overbite.Metropolitan has its charms despite being about people I normally find repugnant but this thing is just a sad little attempt to expand past the Upper East Side in that white racist fantasy of what New York could be like - if only the minorities weren't everywhere.",The Last Days of Disco VHS

402119,"Birdman of Alcatraz, 1962 filmThe film begins with a view of Alcatraz Island, then a Federal prison for dangerous convicts. Robert Stroud spend his adult life in prison since 1909. A train transports prisoners from Washington State to Leavenworth Kansas. Stroud breaks a window. Prisons have rules for inmates. Stroud has a hair-trigger temper. What's eating him? Live music at mealtime. ""I just follow the rules."" Stroud kills a guard! He has no remorse. Stroud is sentenced to hang. His mother says goodbye, then visited a Senator in Washington to ask for clemency. His sentence was commuted to life in solitary. ""I'll be damned."" Stroud makes an enemy of the warden. One stormy rainy day he finds a baby sparrow in the prison yard and adopts it. He feeds it by catching insects for food. Is he going ""bugs""?The film shows his work to train a sparrow. The new warden allows him to keep it. Other inmates were allowed birds as well. Stroud gets two canaries as well. In time Stroud learns better manners. A wooden box provides raw material for cages. He treats a sick canary, and finds the problem. ""How many, Stroud?"" One egg hatches. Stroud's aviary grows over time. Septic fever strikes the canaries, some die. Stroud reads about poultry diseases, and tries cures. Finally one method works. Stroud writes an article for a Canary Journal on diseases. A woman visits him with a business proposition to sell these cures. Then a new law bans pets for prisoners. Stroud tries propaganda to change the rules. Will a common-law marriage have an effect? The publicity makes the news. ""The public has a short memory.""Stroud makes a deal, he will raise canaries and the Government will take the profits. His mother warns him against Stella Johnson; Stroud breaks with her. The freed birds fly around his cell. Stroud gets a present - a used microscope for research. His research led to ""Stroud's Digest on Diseases of Birds"", a world-class book. But there is a surprise transfer to Alcatraz in the middle of the night! The guards also live on The Rock. Will Stroud write a new book? Will this cause trouble? Does prison create a bad attitude for prisoners? ""Parakeets are the coming thing."" ""Goodby, Bob."" In May 1946 two prisoners started a jail break. Stroud stayed in his cell. They had no hope for escape. Troops attacked the prison. In 1959 Stroud was transferred to another prison. Tom Gaddis wrote a book about Stroud and met him on the dock. In 1962 Stroud was in prison for 53 years.This movie is mostly boring with a few spots of action. It is overlong and deals with a unimportant event in history. How accurate is this story? [Was it inspired by ""I Want To Live""?] The film hints at Stroud's family connections but says little else about his background and personality. ""Alcatraz"" in Spanish means ""pelican"".

745007,"Darkness Falls (Jason Liebesman, 2003)Somehow I never got round to reviewing this. Which is okay, because everyone's already said everything I have to say about it, but hey.This movie is probably going to end a lot of careers before they begin, and could have deleterious effects on a few others. I watched it (well, because I like bad horror movies) mostly because Emma Caulfield is hot and I could never stand enough of Buffy the Vampire Slayer to get a good enough fix. This ain't much better, but at least I could sit through it.The Tooth Fairy (Antony Burrows in his big-screen debut, also a stuntman for the lead actor: what a surprise, a stuntman playing a monster) is a ghost who's been exceptionally pissed at a small town for a hundred fifty years. Every time a child loses his first tooth, he's visited by the tooth fairy, and if he's not asleep... well, trauma. Or the brutal and bloody murder of one's parents which then gets pinned on the kid, as happened to Kyle Walsh (Legally Blonde's Chaney Kley). Kyle, not surprisingly, split town after that for a while. No one believes in the Tooth Fairy (of course), and they all think Kyle's nuts (of course), but he comes back to town to save the son of his high school sweetheart, Caitlin (Caulfield). He's being stalked by the Tooth Fairy, as well.First, just to get this out of the way: enough with the new age psychology crap already. Oh, boy, childhood trauma. Yeah, that hasn't been horribly overdone. (No one uses the words ""inner child,"" but they're written all over Kley's face throughout. Try not to puke.)Second, pretty much everything bad you can say about this movie, well, you can say. The acting is hideous, the pace is off, the jumps out of your seat feel more like you settling your butt deeper into the chair. I was more scared by the last Mary Kate and Ashley movie.That said, there are two very above-average things about this flick. The special effects are tremendous, as is to be expected; the Tooth Fairy was designed by Stan Winston. Nuff said. Also, the direction has something going for it. Had Liebesman been able to put together as good a cast as found in, say, The Ring (or even as good a bad cast as found in, say, Cabin Fever), this might have been a wonderful little sleeper. Liebesman uses light and dark like he's working with a palette. Given enough time, he could be approaching the talent of David Lynch or early David Fincher.

When he returns to work on Monday morning, he is arrested and accused of being a synthetic replicant, a Centauri cyborg replacement for the real Spencer Olham, allegedly murdered (without his wife's knowledge) during the camping trip though nobody has a dead body to prove it.  While being held he is shown a &quot;Centauri Hit List&quot; that has been partially decrypted... his surname is among the names on the list.  He maintains his innocence to no avail, and must ultimately escape so that he can prove his own innocence.It takes over 90 minutes to resolve this &quot;is-he-or-isn't-he&quot; question, while Spencer continually runs away or fights when cornered, and is thwarted every time he attempts to find evidence to prove his innocence.The problem with this film is that, given what Hollywood is today, there are only three or four possible endings.  These endings are immediately imaginable and given Hollywood's love of a twist ending, the choices are reduced further.Most intelligent people I've discussed this film with guessed the ending before I even finished describing the premise.So since you basically know how the film is going to end, there is absolutely ZERO suspense.

I liked the title, which refers to a certain shade of lipstick or nail polish favored by the heroine, Shay Bettencourt (Nikki Reed) which attracts the boy she wants, wealthy young preppy Jordan (Jonathan Tucker).  Jordan's insistent neo-noir narration plays continually over the pretty pictures CHERRY CRUSH delivers, and you get tired of him saying over and over again, ""A good photographer captures his subject,"" significant pause, while the camera pans over 4,000 more vacuous shots of Shay in prim lingerie--then the capper, ""But a good subject captures her photographer.""  Staccato burst of horns.  It makes sense, sort of, but it depends on chemistry, and Tucker and Reed are no William Hurt and Kathleen Turner.  Oh what a mess this movie is, on every level.  Number one, it was ludicrous to set this noir thriller in high school.I know, I know, BRICK did it well, but BRICK was more a story of gangsters and turf and money, whereas CHERRY CRUSH wants to revel in the whole forbidden love POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE thing.  It still could work, maybe, but why hire Jonathan Tucker to play a high school student?  The guy looks like he's about 40 and a CPA.  When he's sitting next to Frank Whaley at a bar, Whaley looks younger.  Well, he wasn't directed to keep an absolutely deadpan face with no expression, whereas Tucker looks as though they injected curare into his facial muscles every morning at the beginning of the shoot.  There's a whole plot in which Jordan is supposed to be on the working board of a huge arts organization in order for his CV to look good when he applies to Cornell.  Jordan (and his girlfriend, equally late 30ish, but apparently also supposed to be 17) is thrust into heavy million dollar fundraising, well, I don't think so.  Why even have that plot, it is so ludicrous.  There must be a million other ways to show Jordan at the mercy of a powerful Ari-Gold type of dad who rules him with an iron glove, so that we should sympathize with his need to be free in some aspect of his wealthy young life, even if it means picking up the trashiest girl in town and becoming part of her web of sin, lies and murder.The biggest problem is Nikki Reed as the vamp--totally inadequate.

This had to be a made for TV movie, i'll wet myself laughing if they claimed this was a motion picture.A sceintist geniticly altered a bunch of bats and then they escape and attack when there called via remote. The ugly cop and her new dopey love interest & local animal control expert are on the case while his annoying and cant act for s*** daughter and boyfriend think there news reporters who keep follwing them around looking for an exclusive. All in a small and corrupted town.This is obviosly a TV movie. It plays more like a pathetic soap opera with slight attempts at humor from time to time, while adding killer mutated bats into the mix. It is neither a horror, nor suspence. There is nothing frightining about the film except for the bad acting. It's a no wonder you wont have seen these actors before, nor will you in future. The effects of gore are laying a cows rib bones on the back of an actor and then hanging plastic bats over him then add some badly created CGI shadows to create an effect thats so bad it's not even laughable.The movie is a waste of time. If you wanna see a Bat movie, then the actual title BATS was a better movie, but, it wasnt great either... but leaves this one for dead.Rent it if you feel ill and have the need to puke at bad acting.",N/A

Why would he take a perfectly PERFECT supernatural novel, freak around with it til it made no sense and then film what is, in effect, an expensive &quot;carnival-level&quot; spook-house story?  Another example of Hollywood's fetish with drugs, no doubt.  This has NOTHING in common with one of the most superior novels ever written (on which it CLAIMS to be based).  I think Jackson ought to come back and haunt De Bont for this travesty.  Is THIS what happens when you are apportioned 150 trillion dollars for special effects and 2-cents for screenplay development/scriptwriting?

1489493,"The entire movie is mostly Brad Pitt running around trying to find a solution to the Zombie virus outbreak. The problem is that it's not executed very well. Each person he meets babbles about something random and then goes on to tell him that ""the princess is in another castle"". So finally he sets out to the next location to find the origin of the virus so he can stop it. Along the way in his search he realizes something about the attacking zombie herds that leads him to have a stroke of genius that will help him find a way to save humanity.This movie is mostly CGI zombies and the other usual Hollywood special effects. I don't know what it was exactly about this movie but nothing worked for me. Brad Pitt isn't exactly someone I think off when I think Zombie, and to make matters worse he looks completely out of place here. His cookie cutter family doesn't match him, his pretty boy persona in a world gone to the dogs doesn't match him, and his serious/stale acting style just doesn't fit the movie. This guys delivery could never make me think he's in any danger. No matter what situation you get, you always end up with the poker face Brad Pitt. Is he happy? Is he Scared? Is he angry? I don't know he uses the same expression and delivery for all those emotions. It's not Brad Pitt's fault this movie doesn't fit him though, this film is pretty predictable and bland to begin with. Aside from seeing Zombies pile up to form ladders that's about all that's new. The theory of stopping the zombies has been done before in other horror movies. This is the first time I think I've seen it done with Zombies though.The thing that doesn't make this film work though is that aside from the cheesy CGI zombies (which are so unbelievably obvious I thought I this was a PS3 game), the movie lacks the Zombie feel to it. It just feels like your typical action movie. It's more Action/Science Fiction than it is Horror. This is adapted from a book that I haven't read so I'm not sure the direction these zombies are supposed to go in. With Zombies it can be anything. They used to be Supernatural and the dead coming back to life, then people started to try to make it believable and added in the toxic chemical theories and then the virus theories which takes it from being supernatural horror to science fiction. This is kind of like ""I am Legend"" with the scientific approach to understanding and solving the issue.For me the movie fell apart when Brad Pit meets a certain group of folks that are nestled away working on a solution. They are all so clean cut,mentally together, and nonchalant about what's going on that it only reminds you how poorly executed this movie is in trying to make you feel like the Zombie outbreak has ended the world as we know it.The bottom line is that this movie is just a way to kill time. I actually paused it to run errands for a few hours then came back to it. It was that engaging! I'm not surprised though I rarely find myself enjoying Brad Pit movies. It's not that I dislike him or his acting, the roles he takes are never in movies that interests me. This seemed more like a Tom Cruise role I could see him playing the lead and actually making it interesting even if the dialogue is bland.",World War Z
988055,"If you are sitting in a nearly empty theater, with a dozen other people, and you have a premonition you are about to waste 90 minutes of your life, head for the nearest exit. In all likelihood, your premonition will be correct.Okay, I'll admit it. I liked the first ""Final Destination"". It took a tired, old, over-worked premise, the horror film in which dumb teenagers get killed, and added a little twist to it, elaborate Rube Goldberg-esque murders. It was like watching a game of ""Mousetrap"", only with murder. The unique thing about the first film is that many of these `contraptions' ended with a quick cut, just as the victim is about to fall prey, allowing our mind to fill in the blanks. The filmmakers mixed these less gruesome, elaborate machinations with quick, brutal murders, keeping the viewer on their toes, always guessing.""2"" was a mess. A retread with more gruesome elements, robbing the film of any of the interesting work found in the first.""3"", directed by James Wong, an alumnus of ""The X-Files"", and co-creator (some might argue, perpetrator) of the first installment, attempts to use the mix of the first film while adding more gruesome elements, apparently to appease audiences who expect more and more graphic material. It just doesn't work. Part of what holds your interest in the first film is that you are never quite sure how someone will get offed. Some were gruesome. Some were elaborate. In ""3"", all of the methods are elaborate, but all are equally gruesome and graphic in detail. This provides the gore, but none of the shock.The acting? Irrelevant. A bunch of forgettable teenage actors, many of whom would be unable to get jobs on the WB, attempt to make their characters believable. But these attempts fail. Miserably. Then again, any one who goes to see this film isn't going to discover the next Meryl Streep. They want to see some teenagers get killed. That's what this genre is all about and it doesn't fail in that regard.But unlike the first film, it doesn't provide anything new. Yes, the teenagers are killed in different ways, but because they are all gruesome, the film doesn't have any of the surprise or interest the first entry had.Story? Ludicrous. Again, this isn't really the point of these films. An elaborate attempt is made to try to make the story believable. A young teenage girl has a premonition the roller coaster she is about to get on will have a terrible crash, killing her and all of the members of her senior class in the process. She screams and yells and they finally let her off, along with most of her senior class. Her boyfriend remains on the coaster. Soon, the car does jump the tracks and the remaining people all die. But what about the people who got off the ride? The girl soon realizes Death still wants them and will do whatever it can to get them, in the same order they should have died on the roller coaster. If they are able to save someone, Death skips them over and moves on to the next one. If you haven't stopped reading by now, due to the fact that you are laughing so hard at the ludicrous nature of the story, keep reading. The teenager is a photographer for the yearbook. Before they got on the ride, she took a lot of pictures of the Senior Class. As she realizes the survivors will soon die, she also realizes that there are clues to the deaths of the remaining survivors in the pictures. Oh no, not the pictures!The only thing that might have saved this film from the inevitable 99 cent rental bin at your local video store would be if they returned to the original formula of the first installment. Some elaborate murders with quick cuts, and some quick gruesome murders, leaving the viewer on their toes. Instead, they sort of combine both for this new installment, resulting in a predictably gruesome teenage blood fest. It seems sad that horror films have to be so gruesome, so bloody in this day and age. Whatever happened to the great films that left a lot of the horror to your imagination? These were much more effective and will stand the test of time. Instead, filmmakers now seem to feel it necessary to depict every gruesome detail for the viewer. Perhaps they feel that the viewer can no longer use their imagination and needs everything handed to them on a silver platter. When an image is left to your imagination it is usually scarier than anything a filmmaker could create, so let us think about it.Forgettable.Come on, you weren't going to see this were you?

633854,"I found myself asking `what was he thinking' quite a bit during this film.  I remember when it was first released I was excited to see a family comedy that looked entertaining but `The Pacifier' truly proves to be anything but.  It's the true definition of clich&eacute;d corny antics with no real plot other than some washed up implausible, prefabricated, ridiculous, contrived storyline that grows old before it gets started.  I felt like I had seen this done before in every other ridiculously unauthentic family comedy yet each and every other time I feel it was done better.  The first and largest mistake was the casting of Vin Diesel as the lead.  He's not funny, not even in the whole tough guy gets schooled kinda way they tried for.  He doesn't land a single joke and his physical humor is nothing more than awkward and just plain painful to watch.  The second major mistake was the inclusion of Brad Garrett's character.  Not the fact that Garrett played him (although I find Garrett annoying and unfunny anyways) but his character as a whole, even played by someone else, was a total waste of script paper.The story follows Shane Wolfe, Navy S.E.A.L., as he's assigned to watch the children of a slain scientist while his widow is retrieving some valuable information from his safety deposit box in Switzerland.  In her absence Shane has to deal with intruders looking for some top secret disc or something like that.  Shane's biggest problem though is the children who don't want him there and fight him every step of the way.  Our biggest problem is the script that the actors muddle through and we have to try and find entertainment and or enjoyment in.  That is a hard job and one not worth fulfilling.Vin Diesel was at one time a Hollywood `it' guy.  He was in the big blockbusters of the season thanks to his pivotal role in `The Fast and the Furious'.  After that he was admired by all men and swooned over by all women.  But it's apparent that his career has taken a dive.  His choice in films lately has been anything but inspired or even smart.  Turning up in a film much better suited for washed up talents as apposed to rising stars goes to further twist the knife.  I can't really think of anything nice to say about this movie.  Granted, there are a few scenes, very few, that made me chuckle, like when Shane teaches the Girl Scout troop to fight and they get to try it out on some rival troopers, but it's not enough for me to say I'd consider watching this mess again.  It was nice to see Lauren Graham, but I say that only because she's very easy on my eyes.  In fact the ending alone is so outrageously ridiculous that I can't help but chastise this movie for trying to be taken seriously.  It's not funny unless you find cheap imitations utterly hilarious.",The Pacifier

When the city is alerted to the fact there's a serial killer loose, and they show a picture  on the news of his targeted victim (who works in a shopping mall photo shop),no one happens to call. Excusing the fact there are cops who know what she looks like streaming through the mall. This bit of celluloid pulp makes the Chicago P.D. look like the biggest group of idiots going. Eventually Spader and Reeves have what's supposed to be their big standoff, but the director has Spader playing it so cool we never fear for him. There's no threat at all so consequently no tension.

914840,"WARNING... possible spoilers ahead.In CUP OF MY BLOOD, a pornographic photographer finds out that he's meant to be the last Guardian of the Holy Grail. This is basically a soft-core porn version of the DaVinci Code. If you are practicing Christian or are easily offended, you might want to skip this movie and the rest of this review.The movie starts off like the Ring, but instead of a video tape that kills anyone that watches it, it's an old wooden box which contains the one and only Holy Grail. Everybody that opens the box and sees the Grail dies a horrible death. Enter the pornographic photographer, who is struggling to take artistic pictures for a porn website. His boss is a stereotypical creepy businessman who keeps telling the photographer that he's trying too hard. As you might imagine, this gives the filmmakers plenty of opportunity to show nekked ladies. It spirals into soft-core mediocrity pretty quickly.Somehow, the photographer realizes that there's a secret code hidden on this porn website called ""The Second Cumming"". He clicks on a link and is given a series of clues that lead him to discover that the Holy Grail really exists, and that he is the meant to be inducted into a group of Sacred Knights that protect the cup... kind of like the old Knight from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. I couldn't really tell if the filmmakers were trying to be clever or shocking and irreverent. The end result is that it's not any of the above. It comes off more as a poorly executed live action version of a South Park episode. This actually might have made a good South Park. I can almost see Cartman web-surfing through a bunch of porn websites and finding out that the cup of Christ exists and that he's supposed to be the Guardian of the Holy Grail. When you start thinking that a horror movie is akin to South Park, you know you're in trouble.While our porn photographer tries to deny that he's destined to be a Templar Knight, he's almost seduced by a girl that he used to photograph. She turns out to be a demon, or a succubus or something. The succubus tries to get her hands on the Grail, but our porno photographer wins out and protects the cup of Christ from the demonic bimbo. This movie is pretty empty. It's not shocking, it's not controversial, it's just boring. Whether or not you are easily offended, you can skip this one and not feel like you've missed anything. Watch an episode of South Park instead.",Cup of My Blood

1265542,"I wanted to love this film since the premise behind it is near brilliant.Two teenage boys go vandalize an abandoned hospital and find a girl tied to a table. One of them decides to make her their private sex slave. The other does not. Then they discover she cannot die (even after one of them shoots her). So they keep her. One teen keeps using her while the other goes on to have conscience problems.But there are capital problems here that prevent such premise from blooming into a great one-of-a-kind film.The first thing that strikes me is the miscasting of 25y/o actors who look like 25y/o men and trying to make me believe they are 17y/o teens. That is one major thing that makes this film look quite ridiculous. So you have some 25y/o men dressed as teens and behaving like teens. For me it is hard to buy. I'm sure there are lots of 17y/o teens who would make this film really disturbing.The second big problem here is the script. It is talky and talky and talky. I have nothing against talky scripts but here I kept asking myself ""won't this film advance to the next scene, please?"". Then I realized this film only had story for 40 minutes. The rest of it was filling the void with slow pace.Plus, there are lots of implausible storytelling elements that makes the film progressively harder to like. For me this is a film that does not know what it is - and disguises itself as ""Daringly original and genre-busting (...) odyssey into the soul of our alienated youth that takes the conventions of the horror and coming-of-age movies and turns them on their heads"".No it's not.

I knew The Grey was going to be bad when (SPOILER ALERT) Liam Neeson, in the first fifteen seconds says, ""a summary killer,"" in describing what he does. I barely could pick up what he said, but there it was, yup, ""summary killer."" IMHO, one does not begin ones' movie with a difficult word like ""summary killer,"" within the first fifteen seconds.

GOOD THING ol' Liam was there, READY, to dust that evil toad, his mean, lean killing machine hefted at his shoulder. And he does what must be done.

916481,"When I was watching the movie, I couldn't help but write down some of the more ridiculous scenes that this film's masterminds constructed. It was a long, long list.One of my favorites was right in the beginning of the film. The two doctors in charge of a rather ridiculous and, at this stage of our scientific development, quite impossible, repeatedly refer to each other as ""ex"". Truth is, they're still married, and the still wear their rings.Some drama is made about the wife's ring, and she runs out of the rather large science facility to a remote dock where the sharks swim to get soap so that she can get the ring off.Now come on. In this entire science building, there isn't a single bar of soap anywhere? And it's safer for to leave said building and venture into the shark's den (even if they are, supposedly, well controlled)?Nah.And we know what happens. The ring falls off. She bends to pick up the ring and falls face first into the water. By some strange fortune, she finds herself floating on her back (a neat trick, considering that she was unconscious), and she's rescued by her husband - er, ex-husband, I think - and their assistant.This example fairly well sets the tone of illogic that follows the film from beginning to end.I only watched this because it was on cable (OnDemand), and free. And I thought it would be funny to see how absolutely horrid it was.And I wasn't disappointed. It was horrid.Unless you enjoy laughing at stupid movies because they're so ridiculously stupid (although I have to say that the only way you could really be laughing is if you were doing what I was doing - compiling notes to write a review), this might be for you.

And it starts and ends with the music which I haven't really heard properly played. I very much suspect it's the Conductor who is the guilty party. With his stodgy tempi and total lack of command over the score he literally grinds the work into the ground.

This may be a good idea except we never know if the Composer himself intended it to be a joke or the Director consistent enough to carry it through.

As a loyal fan of Douglas Adams for more than a quarter of a century, I was appalled and horrified by this incredibly unfaithful and singularly unfunny adaptation of his masterful work.  Maybe if you've never even heard of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy or the ingenious Douglas Adams, you might accidentally enjoy one or two seconds of this putrid cinematic mess (doubtful, but possible), but I don't see how any Adams fan can watch this thing without standing up and shaking his/her fist at the screen and muttering various unmentionable words throughout the entire hour and forty minutes.  I mean, this film is absolutely horrible.  I don't even consider it an actual adaptation of Adams' story because half of this movie is original, badly written material - and the other half is a sloppy mish-mash of Adams' vision.  I had my doubts that I would like this film, which is why I waited so long to watch it, but never did I imagine that I would hate it with every fiber of my being.This feature film never made it to development during Adams' life.  There's a reason for that: Adams wasn't going to let his definitive story be ruined by a bunch of writers who thought they knew more about Adams' vision than he did.  Adams' death allowed these script butchers to go ahead and sacrifice Adams' legacy at the altar of their own profit.  These guys took the funniest novel ever written and transformed it into a film without one remotely funny moment.  They got every character completely wrong.  What's this folderol about Trillian actually falling for Arthur?  And Zaphod's second head (and ridiculously fake third arm) - horrible, horrible, horrible.  And why the heck does Zaphod look like Tom Cruise and talk like Bill Clinton doing an Elvis impersonation?  Ford basically disappears halfway into the film.  And Marvin - I had hopes for Marvin (my favorite character) because Alan Rickman would be supplying the voice - those hopes were dashed to pieces.  Even the Hitchhiker's Guide graphics were abysmal - downright cartoonish, even when compared to the low-budget visuals of the classic BBC Hitchhiker's production (which, by the way, is actually faithful to the story and - more importantly -funny).I could go on forever about how terrible an adaptation of Adams' ingenious work this movie is.  This cinematic travesty will likely drive away a lot of people who will now never go near an actual Douglas Adams novel, as they will likely expect each one of them to contain the same kind of hopeless drivel that is this movie.

104845,"Bodice-ripping period flick based (very very loosely) on real-life 16th century Venetian courtesan, Veronica Franco. I have managed to catch this movie twice -- not on purpose -- and I did stick through to the end, so there is something of the ""guilty pleasure"" here of heaving bosoms, fancy costumes, jewel-encrusted goblets, etc.But this is the low-brow equivalent of a supermarket romance novel. IMDB lists no fewer than FIVE different titles for this film, 3 in the US alone and I don't recall it ever appearing at my local cineplex. It's really just soft-focus, soft-core porn for women (no horny guy could bear to sit thought this slop for the minimal nudity). That in itself wouldn't be so terrible, but I really mind historical fiction that butchers history.There are so many gaffes, it would take a ream of paper to list them all. Veronica is the kind of prostitute imagined by junior high school girls -- she's gorgeous, gets to wear incredible gowns and has loving, consensual, pleasurable sex with numerous good looking, stud-like men who respect her deeply. No old fat guys, impotent jerks, no one beats her up or refuses to pay her. Oh, and somehow someone has invented a sixteenth century ""morning after"" drug with NO side effects, so she can have all the sex she wants and never get pregnant.When in love with frog-eyed Rufus Sewell (as stiff as a Ken doll), Veronica dons men's clothing and rides horseback in pants. Other times, she wears short, revealing skirts or skirts over slacks. (Trust me, no woman in the Renaissance could have EVER dressed this way.) Catherine McCormack is beautiful, but has a very limited emotional range. She is especially unconvincing as a young teenager, since she's probably in her late twenties. (The fine Australian actress, Naomi Watts has a small part as Sewell's wife in an arranged marriage and is totally wasted in an unsympathetic part...you have to wonder what she could have done in the title role.)The whole thing culminates in an embarrassing ""trial"", where all the important men of the city stand up to the Grand Inquisition and admit they are Veronica's ""customers"" (risking punishment themselves, not to mention the wrath of their wives). This is just grating and unrealistic in the extreme. The real Veronica Franco was tried twice by the Inquisition (in private, as it was normally done) and not for witchcraft, which is absurd.Even worse is the poetry...clearly this is NOT Veronica's actual poetry, even in translation, but some kind of awful doggerel produced for the film. In all my readings about the Italian Renaissance, I never read anything about ""poetry slam"" contests, and if they had them, the quality of the poetry would have been considerably better -- remember this is roughly the period that William Shakespeare was working in.The film ends abruptly after the trail, with just a brief afterword on the screen to ensure us that Marco (Sewell) and Veronica remained in love for the rest of their lives. Uh-huh.The real lives of prostitutes, even courtesans, are totally ignored -- no unwanted pregnancies, illegitimate children (in a time when that made one a social outcast), venereal diseases, etc. Only one brief mention of the inevitable end of a prostitutes life -- a diseased outcast on the fringes of society, tossed out with no protection when she is no longer pretty or young.Although this movie is not especially ""dirty"" -- I have seen and heard much worse on ""Sex in the City"" -- I shudder to think of impressionable young girls seeing it and thinking that this is a historically accurate representation of women's lives in the past. There is NOTHING romantic about being a prostitute.In short -- bad, hammy soft-core nonsense for addle-brained romantics who have never studied history or want anything serious to think about.",N/A

872419,"I'd bought this a couple of years ago, and I believe I started watching the outtake portion, out of curiosity started with the Bonnie Raitt interview, wondering what 'by what stretch of the imagination could she be tied to the Rutles.'  The answer was ""she can't.""  I recall childish sexual references in her ""interview"", supposedly intended as humorous.  I'd had enough, and started the actual production.  Interviewer running to keep up with the camera pulling away.  I think I found that funny the first time in the first film.  Retreaded, it only qualified as tedious.  I don't remember how much further I got before I had to stop it due to it not being funny or entertaining.I wasn't as fond of ""Archeology"" as I was of the ""All You Need Is Cash"" soundtrack from 1978.  The reason being that with ""Archeology"", you weren't so much reminded of a Beatles song or song by the music, as knowing exactly which song was being parodied by the musical riffs stolen from the Beatles music.  The music was more original in AYNIC.  A perfect example of this is to compare the version of ""Shangri-la"" on Neil Innes' ""Takes Off"" album to the one on ""Archeology"".  The former is very Beatlesque, like a Beatles song that was never released.  The latter is a case of ""OK, this bit was taken from this Beatles song, and that bit was taken from that Beatles song.""I tried last night to watch ""Rutles 2"" again.

Boy was that a crock.The film is mostly - that is, about 98% - boring, slow-moving, and tedious, trying to get some &quot;drama&quot; into it. The plot is ridiculous and filmed and acted in such a way as to make it even more unrealistic, like a bad anime. It's utterly joyless and depressing. The characters you don't much care for.There are a couple of promising-looking swordfights - there seem to be maybe three swordfights in the whole movie - but they're badly filmed and in the end you feel cheated - you don't get to see just how the heroine survives those dozen or so opponents.  The bad costumes make the fights look even more silly. The final showdown ends weakly and cheaply. Very cheaply.So what was all the hype about?I see some of you don't believe me. Fine. Buy it.

His search for romance is urged on by his son, who notes that his father appears lonely and downhearted.Hence the introduction of the father's film producer friend.  The two characters stage a film with dozens of eligible young women ostensibly auditioning for the lead role.  Meanwhile, of course, the father has ulterior motives in meeting and interviewing the ladies.When the father meets the leading lady, there is an instant chemistry between the two and they hit it off, going out to dinner, spending the weekend together, meeting her stepfather, etc.  She has a troubled past, including abuse and the shattering of her dreams as a ballerina, but has resolved many of her issues with her abusive stepfather and now apparently cares for him at her residence.Finally, she comes back to his house, where things get off on the wrong foot when the young lady introduces the father to her amateur acupuncture skills.  This is also the moment in the movie when the young lady meets the son and there is definitely some friction between the two.The end of the movie is unclear, but I am optimistic that these two lovebirds will make it work out in the end, despite their differences.

I did not find the film funny at all (for the record I think that the Simpsons is the funniest, most intelligent show on television right now),  and the croc wasn't scary.  None of the characters were simpathetic in the  least.  I found myself rooting for the croc, just like Betty White.  This  movie could have used a cameo from Steve Irwin, of Crocidile Hunter fame,  just to give us at least one character worth rooting for.  What am I  talking about?

659958,"I had really been looking forwards to this film, while I enjoyed Batman Begins, I found that there were problems with it, which I had  thought would be remedied with this film. Coupled with the hype sorounding The Dark Knight I thought that I would be in for a treat.Instead I was tremendously disappointed.The Dark Knight  is more like a glorified episode of `The Sheild' or `The Wire', in which a cops and lawyers try to apprehend a psychopath. The movie is more about Gordon, Dent and The Joker than it is about Batman. In fact Batman is hardly in the film at all, and when he is featured there is no depth to his appearance or performance.  In fact if Batman had been taken out of it, or his part replaced with a maverick cop or private eye the film would have not been changed. Batman being in the film had no consequence to the film.  In retrospect the film really should have been called `The Joker' because the film  is more about him than anyone else.Here are some of the problems I had with the film.*In Batman Begins, Bruce said that he traveled the world to understand the criminal mind. Are we supposed to believe that he never came across a psychopath during his travels? I also guess that in the Nolan Batverse we are to believe that Stalin and Hitler and other such monsters never existed. Which is why it explains his complete surprise that someone like the Joker could exist, and his inability to get a handle him.* Batman is supposed to be well versed in the martial arts which above all  else instills discipline and focus. Yet he allows the Joker to needlessly provoke him into loosing his temper, wasting precious time while his  two friends are in mortal danger.* Batman has been on the job at most a year, yet he is able to order the Gotham City Police Department to do his bidding. I almost choked when I saw him lecture a cop about not contaminating the crime scene.*The Jokers' success in the film is contingent on most of the characters behaving stupidly and having no common sense.* In Batman Begins, Bruce was committed to being Batman, now in the TDK he wants to throw in the towel and quit at the first sign of trouble.  I would have thought that Batman would have a stronger spine.* Bruce deciding that he can give up being Batman because he now has Dent to take his place. How can that be the case when he and Dent do two completely different jobs? Batman is a vigilante who helps to apprehend criminals. Dent is a prosecutor who tries criminals, he does nothing to apprehend criminals he has to rely on the cops to do that.* Bruce saying that Dent is his successor despite the fact that Dent already had a bad reputation to begin with. Wasn't Batman supposed to have done research?* Dent's speech at dinner about Batman wanting to give up being Batman someday. How is Dent supposed to have come by this information?* Dent's sudden transformation to Two Face, because of the death of his girlfriend.*If the Joker is hell bent on confusion and destruction and human misery, why is he taking the time to explain to Dent that he had nothing to do with the death of his girlfriend?* The whole scene with the ferry. The notion of a group willing to sacrifice themselves until death for another group of people is unrealistic. Self-preservation is the number one rule of all human beings. Also if people are as self-sacrificing and nice as Nolan wants to suggest in that scene. Then what do they need Batman for?*Two Face whining about the what's fair, yet trying to justify trying to kill Gordon's family.* The notion that Batman is setting himself up as a sacrificial lamb at the end of the film because 'that's what the people' need is a lame attempt to draw an equation between Batman and Jesus Christ. It was extremely tacky and contrived. Nowhere is it written in any of the Batman books that Batman's  intent is to take the punishment for the people.*The Hong Kong scene was stupid and pointless, as was the useless car chase.And of course the self-important, pseudo intellectual verbiage that piled out of every characters mouth, No one spoke in this film. They just gave grandiose speeches. I just found it hard to take seriouslyThis is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my entire life.  Clearly Nolan has no understanding or respect for Batman.",The Dark Knight Theatrical Release
670424,"The king of obnoxious behavior, Tom Green, has made it no secret that he finds a great deal of humor in ticking off those who don't understand his brand of comedy.

I guess that this is a type of ""ironic brilliance"" but in all honesty, that's about the only thing you'll probably find funny with this mess of a movie. While his MTV television show had its share of funny moments back in the day, Tom Green should have left the acting (as well as directing) to people who can actually do it.

The lead, Alison Brie, just isn't strong enough to carry the movie, particularly a bad one. Veteran Denise Crosby has done better work. Actually, she is the only good performance in the movie next to Hodder.I don't recommend this film. The explicit use of gore is used as a substitute for tension and interest from a shoddy script.

504162,"In a certain sense, as a Bach fanatic, I support anything that exposes kids to his music.  So my 1-star rating is a bit awkward in that light.  However, I think it well worth pointing out that the music of Bach needs no video embellishment to captivate a child's attention.  As a toddler, I was given cassette tapes of Bach's music, and listened to them constantly.  In a very real sense, from about age 1 1/2 to 6 I lived *inside* the Brandenburg concertos, preludes, and fugues, and the immersive experience has irrevocably enhanced and deepened my perception and enjoyment of music to this day.  So, consider allowing your child to focus on the marvelous harmonic intricacy of Bach without the concurrent distraction of an irrelevant stream of baby photos and implicit toy ads.  Who knows?

( Even at that, I think I got ripped off! )  I earnestly believe this anime title to have NO redeeming features whatsoever.  It's based on what we are told was a ""classic"" anime of the 1960's.  If that's so, then why not reissue the ORIGINAL, instead of attempting to remake something this dated?  ( Not to mention trying to ""salvage"" the ghastly character designs! )  There's something disconcertingly incongruous about the mix of modern computer animation with these horrible, flat, and dated characters.The original 1960's version is touted as an originator of the concept of ""sentai"" or a group of super-heroes fighting a common enemy; in this case the unoriginal ""Black Ghost"", whose design makes Skeletor look GOOD!  Each member of the team has his ( or her ) own super-specialty, like rockets in the feet - obviously ""borrowed"" from Astro Boy.  Sadly, all that accomplishes is to keep this at the level of a very BAD stereotypical Saturday morning kiddie show.  I found it impossible to sympathize with or even like ANY of the characters, who are all total cliches.  Even watching with the original Japanese dialog was of no help this time; I can only imagine how horrible it must be with dubbing!The plot of the evil overlord trying to take over the world with his robot henchmen ( the eponymous Cyborgs of the title ) is lame enough to begin with, but I struggled heroically throughout all 8 episodes presented here TRYING to find a single redeeming feature - all in vain.

1553340,"Though I would've preferred a metal tin (see Justice League Complete Series)for the outer box, a decent enough cardboard material is used. The lone Amazon pic shows the first two of the four different sets of Angels on the left side of the outer box (in all their Silver Convention glory). The right side pleasantly shows the latter two sets of angels. Each of the four inside flaps are dedicated to one of the four sets of Angels, fully covered with photos from that phase. Most of which are from the indidivual season sets. A few new pictures along with each Angel's name appears on the flaps that cover each spindle. Which brings me to the main issue ... the two spindles which hold both stacks of discs. Though not as bad I first thought, a series so great as this deserves the five-star treatment and not some budget packaging. The discs seem somewhat secure in the cheap plastic holders but the inevitability of scratching will probably occur after the first removal. Which causes me to rethink ditching my individual season sets. Because even though I loathe thin cases, they're still better than spindles. There's also no booklet, just an episode list/insert inside the box. The discs of Seasons 1-4 all seem identical to the ones from the indidivual sets, with no added special features or remastering. Also, no special mention of Season Five's debut on dvd and the artwork on those discs are basically the photo from the box (which also appears on Amazon's CA : Season Five homemade item page). Cosmetically speaking, this box rocks but because of the disc housing inside and lack of booklet, the set gets a low rating. Word to the wise, wait for the individual Season Five.

955846,"Until recently, I had never encountered a person who seriously questioned the existence of Jesus. Sure, I've known folks who said he was an admirable, if deluded teacher, or that his followers misunderstood him or elevated his status, but none have suggested that he didn't exist.Then in a discussion with an academic philosopher, I was informed that ""Biblical scholars tend to fudge the issue, but historians are much clearer: there is no evidence of Jesus' existence. He goes completely under the radar of the Roman records, the Palestinian historians -- everyone.Everyone? I asked. That would be news to Josephus, Tacitus, Pliny, and Suetonius who, by the way,((( weren't particularly inclined toward this messianic character )))or his fringe following.Unfortunately, that comment didn't carry sufficient heft for the academian.A troubling question--if Jesus never existed, how did a Christian community arise within the living memory of those who were his contemporaries?Even more--why did they allow themselves to be thrown into the Coliseum by Nero for a fictitious hero?For whatever one may believe about the historical evidence about Jesus, one stubborn fact remains: the emergence (and persecution!) of a first century community that grew out of the teachings of a leader whose credentials could have been checked out from any number of surviving eyewitnesses.Jesus myth - Did He really live?Is the Jesus myth true? Is Jesus just the fabrication of a bunch of religious zealots? Some people would like us to believe that the existence of Jesus is nothing more than a myth. To examine this question, let's start by looking at how some people have defined the word ""myth.""a traditional story accepted as history; serves to explain the worldview of a peoplea story, usually of teleological content, that relates not historical fact but historical ""experience"" of its writer or culture. It is not a chronicle of ""what was or is"" but a profound expression of ""how things are.""an anonymous tale emerging from the traditional beliefs of a culture or social unit. Myths use supernatural explanations for natural phenomena. They may also explain cosmic issues like creation and death.If Jesus did not really exist, He would fit these definitions because He would not be part of history or historical fact. Conversely, even if He really did exist, the last definition implies that who He claimed to be could still be a myth if the supernatural miracles He performed had natural explanations or He was not the Creator He claimed to be or He really didn't have power over death He claimed to have.It appears that the person who wrote the last definition tailored it to fit Jesus. He apparently believed that Jesus was not what He claimed to be and consequently was a myth.Raising the potential mythology of Jesus is a fair question and believing in the Jesus myth is an acceptable position as long as such a conclusion is based upon a careful, unbiased examination of the evidence and not based upon what we want to believe.Many of us may want to jump to that conclusion just to avoid our responsibility toward God and to our neighbors that we would be forced to consider if Jesus is real and is who He says He is.Any careful and objective study of the facts that surround Jesus birth, life, death, and resurrection will convince anyone that Jesus is real and that He is who He said He was.Many people have done research specifically to discredit the reality of Jesus and who He claimed to be or examined their atheistic beliefs and ended up proclaiming the truth of Jesus and the Bible.Some of these that have written their story in a book include Josh McDowell, Lee Strobel, Sir William M. Ramsey, and Randall Niles.Without even getting into many detailed historical, archeological, scientific, and documentary facts, consider the following to see if Jesus' existence and His claim to be God are consistent with the facts:Our calendar is based upon the birth of Jesus both counting backwards (BC) before His birth and forwards (AD) after His birth. Why would we base our calendar on a myth?Why have Christians been persecuted throughout history if Jesus is a myth?If Jesus is a myth, why do people take His name in vein?Why does the mere name of Jesus instill such hatred and controversy and why is just mentioning the name of Jesus taboo if He is a myth?If Jesus and His resurrection was a myth, why did all the apostles die for what they knew to be a lie?How have so many lives been transformed from unsatisfying, self-destructive behaviors that are like a curse on themselves, their families, and society to a purposeful, satisfying life that is a blessing to society?How do you explain the wisdom that Jesus had when answering peoples questions when they tried to trick and trap Him?How do you explain how Jesus fulfilled all the messianic prophecies in the Old Testament that could not have been fulfilled by random chance?Why was Jesus crucified and why were the apostles murdered if it's all a myth?Many religious concepts are consistent with human thinking. Some promise to make us gods. Some promise many virgins. Some promise utopia. These concepts are consistent with human thinking. How do you explain God's plan that includes Jesus giving up His God status to become a lowly man; to live a perfect life and to die for us by our own hand and to save us from our sins. This is clearly not a concept that men would create.In the beginning was the Word,and the Word was with God,and the Word was God.He was with God in the beginning.Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.Whoever believes in him is not condemned,but whoever does not believe standscondemnedalreadybecause he has not believed in the name of God's one and only SonLastly, is organized religion bad?Yeshas racism always existed, and still does?Yesdoes it exist around the globe and not just in the USA?Yes",The God Who Wasn't There

472777,"Every fan of movies should be forced to watch Caligula as an ascetic exercise at least once.  For only in discovering how bad cinema can be are we able to fully appreciate how good it can be.  And the good news is that the film has a message- absolute power corrupts absolutely!  That is the end of the good news.As an historical drama, Caligula completely fails to capture any sense of time and place.  While some of the scenes depicted (such as the Emperor Tiberius swimming with his ""little fishes"") are based on historical sources, it seems as though it could have taken place on Mars.  The sets and costumes are incredibly garish or silly, sacrificing any suspension of disbelief.  The camera work is amateurish- it zips around, losing its subject, and often delivering an unclear picture due to what seems to be inadequate lighting or a failure to focus on the subject.  The picture is grainy throughout and tough on the eyes.As an ""artistic"" hard core porno flick, Caligula is boring and not the slightest bit titillating.  The sexuality is displayed between frequent and extremely gruesome acts of violence (the multitude of which I will not catalogue here, suffice it to say the movie should not be watched while eating).  Also, when trying to advance the plot (if Caligula has one), the hard core scenes are exasperating in their ability to delay the progression and break down whatever narrative quality the film might have had.Other reviews speak adequately as to the story of how this train wreck of a movie occurred, so I won't go into it.  I can suggest, however, that you will likely never see such an A-list cast in such an awful movie ever again.  The included documentary is laughable- Guccione is really convinced he is making a truly important film, and the casting reflects that.Now, the only dramatic alternative I know of to Caligula that covers the same period is ""I, Claudius"".  While Claudius runs 668 minutes and Caligula runs 155, I can guarantee you that the latter seems to go on much longer; forever, in fact.  You emerge from viewing it wondering what in the world you just watched, and whether or not viewing a film can actually make you a less noble person.  But I know you are curious... so have at it, just remember you were warned!",N/A

483243,"Probably one of the worst movies ever executed using a big Hollywood budget.""Heaven's Gate"" may be a classic compared to this car crash. The problem was they began shooting without a coherent script, resulting in a disjointed mess with genuine menace, but no real focus and not a single likable character.There was no amount of editing magic or special effects that could fix it if the story on paper was already this bad.The best actor on the production played a character killed off in the first 15 minutes of the film. The others, even Angela Bassett and the gorgeous Robin Tunney, are at best miscast, especially James Spader, who pulls duty in this film as a buff action hero, a role completely outside of his scope.It might be more accurate to say that the characters as written could never be played by actors of any caliber at all. This is just bad storytelling from the opening fade-in.One note: if they had released it with the original ending (viewable as one of the extras) it would have gone down in history as the biggest downer ending ever put on film.Skip this one.

709051,"Unlike some people I really enjoyed the HELLRAISER sequel that preceeded this one, INFERNO. It stuck more to the original concept (as in the original novel) than any of the other sequels, and actually had a new twist and a PLOT which is more than I can say for HELL ON EARTH (radio shack cenobites...ugg) and the idiotic, predictable BLOODLINE (Pinhead in Space, just like the stupid Leprechaun).So after the series had been so greatly revived by part 5, I hoped, though doubted, that part 6 might be halfway watchable.Firstly this movie is a rip-off of ANGEL HEART and JACOB'S LADDER. Secondly, it does the old ""it was only a dream"" trick every five minutes to the point where you cannot follow the plot at all. The only redemable moment is the ending which is commendable but isn't worth waiting for through the entirety of the boring, lame and redundant film.Pass on this.The interesting thing is that the people who own the rights to this series also own the rights to HALLOWEEN (or did). So if JASON VRS. FREDDY ever comes out and makes any profit, which it will no matter how campy it will doubtlessly be, then we will know whom Pinhead will eventually come face to face with. After that we can look forward to a reprise of the old monster movies like KING KONG VRS. GODZILLA which plagued the late fiftes and early sixties. Every horror movie icon will come back to fight another (which would also make for a great Playstaion 2 fighting game). THE FLY will fight LEATHERFACE. CHUCKY VRS. LEPRECHUAN is inevitable. THE THING could show up at SLEEPAWAY CAMP. Personally, I think once a franchise has reached up to part seven or, worse yet part 10 like FRIDAY THE 13TH, there is little left to do but go campy or call it quits. FREDDY went campy (super campy) by the first sequel. He knew what was up. Chucky and Leprechaun followed his lead, and Jason took his sweet time but he made it. Unless Hollywood finally lets PINHEAD and MYERS and the other greats finally rest in peace, then eventually they will be doomed to cinematic cheese. HALLOWEEN 8 (with Busta and Tyra) is an alarming warning of this.Let's hope they let PINHEAD maintain his dignity and throw in the towel. Some horror icons are too magnificent to go cheesy.

44033,"This is not an inditement of the movie but of the man. Harry Truman was the absolute worst president this country as ever had to endure. One of his first actions was to join the KKK in Missouri in order to become affiliated with the foremost political machine in the state. Once he made it to national office, he no longer considered himself a member as he did not need the KKK. What actually makes him the worst president is that he gave all of eastern Europe to the Soviet Union. The allies had just fought a war in order, partially, to keep Europe from being conquered by Nazi Germany. However, Truman just gave all of eastern Europe to the Soviet Union without a shot being fired. His best military leader, General Patton saw the threat from the Soviet quite clear. General Patton wanted to march straight through Germany to protect eastern Europe. Unfortunately, Truman, who knew absolutely about military tactics, disagreed to venomously with Patton that he relieved Patton of his command. A few years later, the same scenario was played out again in the Korean conflict.  General MacArthur, knowing that the war could not be won on the ground, wanted to bomb North Korea and China with 30 to 50 atom bombs. Again, Truman,  who still knew absolutely about military tactics, relieved General MacArthur of his command and the war was lost. Harry Truman was the reason the United States was involved in the cold war. If he had done what his military experts had wanted to do, there would have been no Soviet Union, Communist China, Communist North Korea or Communist Cuban.

1673501,"I had first posted this review forThe Sound of Music Live!movie while watching it when it aired on NBCBut just because I HATE this version and expressed my opinion about it -- which, BTW is the WHOLE point of a writing a review (NOT to be insincere and falsely fawn over and flatter the subject with a review written through ""rose colored glasses""!) I was constantly bullied with insulting replies, and a low ""helpful review"" score, like nearly every other 1-star reviewer for this item.I was so MERCILESSLY attacked that I finally just took down my review altogether.However, after thinking about it for awhile, I decided that I am NOT going to give in to a bunch of intolerant bullies obsessed with stamping out any dissent. This is a HORRIBLE production of ""The Sound of Music"" and I am FAR from the only one who feels that way! Not only did Kym Karath, who played the youngest Von Trapp child, Gretel in the Julie Andrews version, post on Twitter about her disappointment and disgust with this production, but even the surviving Von Trapp family members did NOT approve of this production either.  Which is why I decided to write another review -- and I don't care if I'm flooded with insults, and given a ZERO ""helpful review"" score, I'm not going to let the bullies intimidate me anymore, because even if there are others who disagree, I have a right to my own opinion.Now, before going any further, I just have to say that I am a HUGE, HUGE fan of ""The Sound of Music"". Not only have I read theStory of the Trapp Family Singersthe biography/autobiography written by Maria von Trapp, but I also haveThe Sound of Music Family Scrapbookand TWO sets of ""The Sound of Music"" on DVD (theFive Star Collection EditionAND theTwo-Disc 40th Anniversary Special Edition) and incredibly, I'm still considering getting the movie on Blu-Ray at some point in the future (assuming that interest in online streaming does not completely take over/replace the Blu-Ray market!). I have also seen the Julie Andrews version literally probably at least a THOUSAND times (if not more!) since childhood, so many times that I pretty much know it by heart. So no one can say that I am not knowledgeable and a devoted & loyal fan of ""The Sound of Music"" -- and in my opinion, this live version with Carrie Underwood was a HUGE disappointment, and a TOTAL DISGRACE to the original with Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews!!Even with all its hype, this production falls flat and the casting, the characters and the acting was all just AWFUL -- and even that is putting it kindly. I couldn't even get through a FEW MINUTES of this before I needed to change the channel and take a break -- and even though I switched back & forth from time to time (mainly to see if it'd get any better -- which it unfortunately did not) I couldn't get through more than a couple minutes of the movie each time, before I was itching to change the channel again!What is it with everyone producing such AWFUL remakes of ALREADY-GREAT musicals & movies likeThe Sound of MusicandAnnie??Carrie Underwood is awful as Maria!She has a good voice but it isn't the right one for this production and she doesn't have the acting ability to pull off the character in this remake. Sadly,  everything about Carrie in this role, from her hairstyle, to her clothes, to her acting ability (or sheer LACK thereof!) was just horrible -- and the word ""insulting"" doesn't even come close to being an adequate description. Even the surviving members of the von Trapp family didn't want Carrie in this role. She may be a great singer, but she definitely is NOT an actress! With years of practice that could change, but doing a live performance, particularly at this time was a huge mistake. Although Carrie's pretty & can sing pretty well, she sounds so whiny and annoying when she's pleading with the Mother Abbess not to send her away (to the Von Trapps) which brings to another point -- the HORRENDOUS casting of Audra McDonald as the Mother Abbess!Now I am all for equality, justice and non-discrimination, and I absolutely abhor any kind of bigotry, racism & prejudice, but by the same token, there is also a lot to be said for being accurate and realistically true to history, especially when the setting of the work depicted is in past decades/centuries/millenniums. In all seriousness, what Catholic convent in 1930s Austria would have permitted an African-American woman to be the MOTHER ABBESS?!?During the 1920s and 1930s, an African-American woman even just being an ordinary nun would itself have been extremely unusual (if not even nonexistent!) ANYWHERE in the world, let alone in pre-Nazi era Austria -- but her being in a position of power (like being a Mother Abbess in charge of a convent) would unfortunately have NEVER have happened in that era. It's sad & unfortunate but during those ""Jim Crow"" days. prior to the incredible work done by heroes like Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, Malcolm X., Medgar Evers and others, and the passage of the Civil Rights Act, and its slowly increasing acceptance, neither black men and especially not black women were allowed to be in any positions of power. As the saying went back then, black women were relegated to being ""maids, mammies and mamas""! And what is it with casting Audra McDonald in every single remake?? She was also cast as Miss Grace Farrell in the remake ofAnnieand she was awful, not to mention historically inaccurate, there as well!This is NOT about either racism, multi-culturalism, or ""political correctness"" -- its about sheer historical inaccuracy, that stretches the limits of believability. Its like remakingGone with the Wind, and recasting Scarlett O'Hara with a Chinese woman, Rhett Butler with an African-American, Ashley Wilkes with a Latino, Melanie Hamilton with a Native American, India Wilkes with a woman from India (and I say that being of Indian descent myself!) and Mammy & Prissy with fair-skinned, blue-eyed blondes! Because that's what the ridiculous casting in these remakes basically amounts to -- changing the cast's characteristics, simply for the sake of political correctness and multi-culturalism, and the truth of history be damned!Unfortunately. the rest of the casting and acting in this movie is just as bad, if not worse!Nearly every character is unbearably annoying and petulant, and the way they deliver their lines so forcefully, it almost sounds like they were under duress to say it. Rather than being lovable and adorable like the von Trapp children (especially Gretel) in the original movie were, the kids come off as total brats. Even most kids taken off the street could act better than the von Trapp children or even Carrie Underwood or Steven Moyer in this movie. Instead of being the stern but basically loving Captain like in the movie, this Captain Von Trapp just comes off as an irritating, heartless and insensitive tyrant! From what I saw (I couldn't get through more than even half of this movie) there was not been one single character in this production that I liked. Maybe if the cast had been honing their acting skills by doing these performances in front of a live audience for a year or two before televising it, it would have worked for a live TV airing. But that wasn't the case, and all the characters were really fake and rehearsed. NONE of their dialogues sounded effortless, like they were saying those lines naturally as part of their normal conversation, but rather like it's like something they'd practiced beforehand and/or are being forced to say!If that's not bad enough, the producers changed around the order/placement of the song sequences in this movie, in the most ludicrous ways. For example, they moved the ""My Favorite Things"" song (which in the original movie, that Maria sings/teaches the von Trapp children during the thunderstorm scene) and putting it in the scene where Maria is in the Mother Abbess's office! The last straw for me, was when Maria and the Mother Abbess were singing the song together and the Mother Abbess is sitting on her desk, dangling her legs back & forth like she is a kid riding a swing! RIDICULOUS! What is she like 5 years old?? *smh*The Sound of Music Live!is a disgrace to the classic original with Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews! I just wish I had never seen this movie in the first place, and I hope this crap doesn't end up sullying my memories of the original movie! I regret that I have wasted time on this garbage, when there were so many other nicer things I could have seen instead :(All in all, IMHO this movie has been horrible IN EVERY WAY, and I will never buy it on DVD!!!!",The Sound of Music Live!

91884,"Am I missing something?  Please write and tell me if I am, because I can't understand why people admire this movie.  As far as I can tell, this is what happens in ""A Time To Kill"": Carl Lee's daughter is raped and left for dead, and her white tormentors are captured.  Before they face trial, Carl kills them.  Why?  They would not be convicted, because as we all know a white southern jury couldn't possibly set aside its racism.  Carl is then acquitted by a white southern jury that sets aside its racism.  The film urges us to celebrate this verdict as some kind of race-relations watershed.  But beneath the back-slapping, soaring music and soft focus, the take home message is this: ""There is a time to kill.  If you think the justice system won't give you justice, then revenge killing is a noble option.""  Not only is this one of most appallingly idiotic dictums ever conceived, it betrays an appreciation of the justice system which is, at best, infantile.Let's apply a little common sense here.  What the white rapists did was wrong, and they should be punished for it.  What the black father did was wrong, and he should be punished for it, too.  Cases closed.  Yes, we can empathize with Carl.  Yes, put in the same position we might even do the same thing ourselves.  No, that doesn't make it right.  Even if you think Carl was rightly acquitted, the film defeats its own argument: the fact that Jake Brigance gets a white jury to recognise and set aside its inherent racism (""now imagine she's white"") demonstrates that Carl's fears were unjustified.  There was no need to take the law into his own hands after all - a black man can get justice from a white court.  However, I think a more realistic interpretation of the outcome is that a dumb jury can be sweet-talked by a pretty-boy lawyer into acquitting a guilty man they feel sorry for.  And what kind of 'justice' is that?  Don't ask screenwriter Akiva Goldsman - this is just another one of his sci-fi scripts.  Nor director Joel Schumacher - here, as in his equally insulting ""Batman"" films, he seems more interested in visually molesting his male star than in telling a decent story, and clearly spent most of his time contriving ways to get Matthew McConaughey's shirt off or setting up lingering butt shots.This film was pitched as an exciting suspense-thriller, nicely cast with a mix of heavy-weights and newcomers, and having the guts to explore some serious social and moral issues. For me, it's a vile and contemptible little film peddling an equally repulsive morality.  What the hell Spacey, Bullock and the Sutherlands are doing here is beyond me.  It's a blot on all their resumes.  Go back to your old job as a window dresser, Joel.  On the evidence of this film, pretty and pretentious facades are what you're best at.",N/A

This had to be the worst science-fiction series I have ever seen. The writing was sloppy, story lines confusing and special effects and props/ models very amateurish. The first few episodes were very difficult to get through. They made almost no sense at all. Subsequent episodes smoothed out and started to show some improvement as the characters developed a little, but overall I found it to be a complete waste of time and money. Sad too, as I have seen the actors in other roles and they were all quite talented and convincing, but in this series not so. As a result I'd have to conclude the problem had to be the script. No small wonder the series was cancelled.  The pleasant surprise was on the last DVD when I found there were only two episodes instead of four.",Crusade: The Complete Series
950749,"I'm a big George Michael fan and he mentioned liking this series when interviewed after getting out of hospital post-pnemonia (sp?), so I checked it out from the library to have a look.  All the actresses/actors were good; I give it one star because the lead character ran so roughshod over everyone around her and no one checked her, which I found unbelievable.  Yes she owned her own salon so I can understand her employees having to put up with her, and yes I can accept that she chose a husband she could walk all over, but every single other character she interacted with took her guff, in as many episodes as I could stand to watch (couldn't get through all of them), with very little to no complaint.  Even her customers were abused.  What successful small business owner would be such a dolt that she would run roughshod over her own customers; how could she stay in business.  Obviously she couldn't.  And she lived in a small village, not London, so word of mouth about her would quickly get around town, and she'd have no customers and therefore no business.  I understand that in real life, often out of politeness, people will not contradict an overbearing stranger, but the lead treated every single other character abominably and she got away with it every time (again wasn't interested enough in her to watch all the episodes). As the lead character isn't rich, famous or especially beautiful (not a knock at the lead, who is attractive, just obvious she isn't playing a high-end star) in the story, no reason for anyone but her employees, and possibly her husband, to put up with her.  One star due to unbelievable character interactions.  Lead actress was good, I thought she had a good time with the part.  If characters behave unbelievably in a story, how is the audience supposed to care about them.  The lead character was believable as a self-obsessed bully, but the surrounding characters were not believable in the way they reacted to her (except, as previously noted, her employees/husband).  Poorly written secondary characters.  Plus lead character was one note, didn't flush her out.  She started out obnoxious and stayed that way throughout (witnessed same behavior in final episode).  Most people in the audience don't know how a beauty salon is run, but every single person is an expert on human behavior/interaction (because we've been interacting with others since birth) and when an especially unbelievable character interaction is featured in a story, it makes it harder for audience to suspend disbelief, I think is the literary phrase.  Ugh, is my phrase.  As a woman, I want more roles featuring women, but if characters don't interact in a recognizable (i.e., human) way, then a story/series featuring a woman is unengaging.  I want more women's roles, but in quality, well-written projects.  I understand the lead actress wrote this, and it's been off awhile now, so she's probably gotten better.  I look forward to seeing more of her work and seeing her progression/improvement.  She's obviously talented; she can write a lead who gets the audience's attention, just needs to create a fictitious world in which her lead ""lives.""",Nighty Night - The Complete Series 1

It was horribly directed, horribly acted, slow to the point of putting you to sleep and ends just as the real good stuff is about to start happening - RETRIBUTION.  One thing that is terribly distracting and impossible to understand is the use of modern music, loud modern music, here and there in the movie.  In particular, the rendition of Fools Rush in by one of the worst singers I've ever heard just goes on and on.  In the first part of the movie they show you to the point of just putting a gun to your head the protocol of getting her out of bed and dressed and the putting to bed of both of them. Later they just drop this totally and she is hopping into bed with the soldier anytime she wants to.  If she was spending all her time at Petite Trianon with her friends and her lover how did she have time to sleep with her husband thus explaining the second child, the boy. If this movie was based on a book then it's either the worst book about her that was ever written or it is the worst adaptation.  I am leaning toward it being the worst adaptation.

522932,"I love toilet-humour but this is mostly toilet without the humour.  The Farrellys always had, until now, a good idea of what's funny, and if they can be gross and funny at the same time, well, that's even better.  But I didn't find anything funny about the prolonged shot of the defecating dog nor the placement of the chicken where the sun don't shine.  I think I only laughed aloud twice -- at the bit with the cow and at the sloppy wet kisses between the black dwarf chauffeur and Charlie's ex-wife.  There were other good moments but those damn promo trailers had already spoiled them.  I think the involvement of scowling corrupt cops in the plot was also a misstep.  Not only are the scenes involving the paper cut-out criminals incredibly dull, but just the presence of a menace in a Farrelly brothers movie is incongruously jarring, and as a result, I couldn't sense any of the sweetness that was at the core of their previous films.  Moreover, the Farrellys felt obligated to wrap up all the loose ends begotten by their ill-conceived plot with a stupid action sequence replete with an albino deus ex machina.  As for Jim Carrey, he is fun to watch, as always, especially in those scenes in which Hank and Charlie confront one another, which reminded me of the hilarious bathroom sequence in 'Liar Liar'.  But alas, he was unable to save the film.  I should also note that hockey fans may want to stay for the closing credits.  Giving billing to normally ignored extras at the end of the film may seem pointless for most folks, but hockey fans will see where Cam Neely, Brendan Shanahan and Reggie Lemelin's kids appeared in the film.",N/A

The movie had so much potential and had such a big following from just the trailer and of course when a trailer is that good there is always a little let down, but i don't think anyone expected for a let down like this. The movie is seriously set up like a show on national geographic exploring the art of exorcism and getting your first period, it captures that part perfectly, and it is just so boring. Yes exorcism movies typically have a lot of talking and stuff like that but this was unbearable, all it was, was talking and trying to be scary, which at some points was actually pretty funny. There was like 5 times during the whole movie that i jumped, the rest i sat there in my seat struggling to stay awake and to not yawn so loud. The camera was very shaky and i had a hard time seeing certain things or concentrating on certain things during the movie cause it was shaky or moving too much. And the ending, made the whole movie a horrible waste of time. the worst ending i have ever seen next to the ending of The Mist.

931985,"Okay, here goes.  These orphans, who all look to be in their twenties decide to escape from the cruel orphanage.  They work out this clever plan.  The clever plan?  Get out of bed and walk out the unlocked door then wait for the security guard to come out and beat him to death so they can then walk away. Yeah, that was clever.  So they escape the orphange and they go into the woods where there is this book, passed down from the Druids.  So they won't be caught and returned to the orphange, (even though they are all old enough to be holding down real jobs), they commit mass suicide, using some Druid spell, so that they can come back some time in the future when some unsuspecting souls wander into the woods and step into their magic circle.  One guy and I have no idea where he came from, becomes the guardian of the circle and it is his destiny to defend the circle and make sure no one ever goes into the circle and be possessed by the orphans.  So what does he do to make sure no one ever steps into the circle by accident?  He builds a wall around it.  Unfortunately, the wall is only about one inch high.  Really..I'm not making this up.  So a group of hikers (woo-hoo! unsuspecting souls)wander into the woods and all but one of them walks or trips or stumbles into the circle (I'm having trouble going on because this is so stupid) and they become possessed by the deceased orphans.  The guardian, who was apparently sleeping on the job when this happens, decides he has to hunt down the now possessed people and destroy them to protect the Earth.  He enlists the aid of the one guy from the hiker group who was not possessed to help. (And this guy is dumber than dirt) The guardian and the idiot hiker guy then enlist the aid of some young woman who is just a random friend of the guardian.  So how do you track down these demons from the pit?  I guess the plan was just to run in mindless panic, hiding in stupid places and hoping the demons find you, which they did with incredible ease.  So after the demon orphans, one by one, never as a group find our three heroes, they are then dispatched by the guardian's secret weapon.  Again, I'm not making this up.  Now when I'm fighting demons, my arsenal consists of things like holy water, wooden stakes and silver bullets.  A nice sharp sword that might behead one of the demons might come in handy too.  Maybe carry a small Bible in a pocket.  What does our hero use?  A shovel he gets from a hardware store.  With his trusty shovel, Excaliber, he beats the demons back to the burning pit. The only thing worse than the plot of this mess is the acting by an entire cast, and particularly the guardian guy.  I have never seen such horrible acting.  This guy should be the poster boy for bad acting.  If you don't pay attention in drama class, this could be you.

The writing is simply atrocious, some of the worst writing I have ever seen in movies. They give the impression that they simply were not planned and plotted out. Instead, I get the impression that it is a bunch of impulses. Then, like a high-schooler cramming to meet the deadline, characters make incredibly illogical and out of character choices so that the necessary plot points can be hit.So Anakin Skywalker makes this very stupid choice, which really there is no argument for. Palpatine, the big evil, does his dastardly deed and scheming because...just for the heck of it. Just because, why not? The other various villains in the movies are numerous to the point of being anonymous. Count Dooku shows up at the end of Attack of the Clones and is dead at the beginning of Revenge of the Sith. His motivations are just as inane as Skywalker's. There is a General Grievous who shows up at the beginning of Revenge of the Sith and is dead about halfway through the movie. He doesn't have any motivations at all. In that time, no dread is built up. Unlike the first trilogy where we have one clear villain: Vader, in the prequels the villains are a succession of toys to be bought at target for $14.99.The thing about writing is that it is hard work. You have to plan out the payoffs and plot points. It appears that no real effort was made to do this in these movies. Things just happen, in a shower of CGI sparkles, without any payoff, without any converging themes or story elements.Speaking of CGI, they cheapen the experience. Creativity comes from constraint, but CGI allows for lazy shots of basically computer screensavers, like something you'd see in a Windows default background screen. There is no magic at all in seeing the craftsmanship which went into making static models appear like they are flying -- just do it in the computer! The enemies that the Jedi are facing are mindless droids. The battles are similarly mindless and devoid of emotion. Significant important battles have heavy CGI. Yoda especially is depicted as a tasmanian devil -- which goes completely against the Yoda of Empire Strikes Back, who was basically an Indian mystic, frail in body but strong in mind...no, in the prequels the Force is no longer mystical or religious, but is pretty much technological. Dependable, predictable, done with the press of a CGI button.Worst of worst, Lucas even had the gall to scar the original trilogies with dancing CGI thingies, and cast from the prequel trilogy. It is completely arrogant, and it is simply bad filmmaking.Seriously, the only comparable movie to this might be Battlefield Earth. Even most cheap B-movies like Jumper at least have discernible scripts and motivations. The prequels are just a jumbled mess.Lucasfilm was recently acquired by Disney, so there is some hope. One can at least hope that one day the original theatrical versions of the movies will be released in the appropriate high definition format, without any CGI scarring.One can hope that one day the prequels will simply be remade. It could happen.Until then, I'll simply stick with a few Despecialized Editions of the originals.",N/A

Why did Olivia wear a golden version of one of her grandad's old suits? Is she too old to look femminine? Why sit down to sing several upbeat country songs? Is Olivia too old to stand up? This version of 'Your the one that I want' is pathetic. All the numbers have been slowed to walking (sleeping) pace and 'Let's Get Physical' is anything but. Totally lifeless numbers, the fire has gone out.Continue making CD's Olivia, but give up the stage if this is the best that you can do. The 1982 live concert video is far far superior.

Cannot wait to see it! I'm as liberal as they come, and I could not wait to throw my support behind people doing something so controversial, yet nessecary (because let's be honest, liberals are good at being walked all over and pushed aside and that is about it; just not an effective group).So i watched this.... 50% of the movie is filler, not a good start. I was thinking maybe they accomplish a great deal like I had heard... They crash a fabrics marketing meeting in Finland with maybe 45 nobodies in attendance and try to crash another meeting in Australia that gets canceled because of lack of attendees? Seriously? Wow, slow down.Worse still, they dont put a great deal of effort into anything they do, (again, typical liberal), they don't work on their presentation until a few days beforehand, they don't plan anything and they accomplish nothing.But wait, it gets worse! Their satire is the most dumbed down, stereotypical garbage that no one but a stoner freshman in college who thinks they have the whole world figured out could appreciate. You know that guy, he is out in the quad playing the 3 cords he knows on his guitar with a copy of something by nitzche or some other ""tortured author"" trying to look deep and impress girls with no self esteem and daddy issues. If you hate that guy, you are really going to hate this thing.It is kind of sad because at first these guys seem really intelligent and especially well informed on the groups they wish to target. And I can ever get past the handy cam quality of the entire feature because hey, anyone who is trying to make a difference deserves all the recognition and support they can get. But this is a poor excuse for a pipe dream that acomplishes nothing.

It had Poor film quality, corny dialouge, ridiculous zombies (were they even trying to make them look liek zombies), boring music scores. The basis of the stroy was some guy's brother gets the electric chair. And before his brother died, he made a promise to find the real killer of his sister in law. Turns out there was some stupid plot about a zombie master. The story on the back of the box made it sound like a big epic apocalyptic movie because the &quot;Zombie Master&quot; (who's just some old ugly guy) tries to take over the world with zombies (which are just people that give you blank stares, oh yeah and there was only one zombie) Throughout the whole film I was so bored that I actually wished I was in math class! By all means avoid at all costs and if you haven't seen this pathetic excuse of a movie yet, count your blessings. The title makes it soudns like one of those artsy italian zombie films but it's not.

It is nice to know that we have evolved in our notions and beliefs over the past 60 years.  Now back to the movie.  Gary Cooper walks through this movie like he's a zombie.  Patricia Neal over acts as Dominic so badly it's painful.  The other characters are so over the top, omg. The music score by Max Steiner famous for Gone with the Wind is pretty good however.  The set design was also pretty cool to behold.  All in all, this is a very overrated movie.  I mean, even Rotten Tomatoes gave it I think an 82%.  I would have given it a 45% and most of that for the musical score, set design, and direction by King Vidor.

Now, I'm a liberal in real life and also against the death penalty (probably the only person IN Huntsville who is, it seems sometimes), and even though the message of the film seems very anti death penalty itself, the film's moralistic, preachy message made me uncomfortable. If I wanted a sermon, I'd go to church. This is typical, liberal Hollywood propaganda. If I want to see a film addressing a controversial issue, I prefer for the film to use valid points from BOTH sides of said issue, in order to gain more understanding of what is being presented. This movie not only preached, it was mind-numbingly BORING, and the ""twist"" was easy to figure out way, way before it was revealed. It's the kind of manipulative Hollywood tearjerker that tries to make the audience sob and howl at the ""poor plight"" of this wrongly accused man, and it's shallow, pointless, EXCEEDINGLY cliche (ripe with horrible dialogue), and did I forget to mention BORING?

Well, he didn't and as a result, only made two films as England's most revered secret agent.  This time out he's chasing after a drug dealer (isn't this beneath him) and is aided by Cary Lowel (of Law & Order fame) and Las Vegas favorite (Wayne Newton) playing a high class hack peddling religion.  Long story short - the script is so bad that if the film didn't have Bond it would have tanked at the box office.  As it stands, it didn't exactly cut a financial swath.MGM/UA's DVD doesn't do the film any favors.  Aliasing, digital compression artifacts, fine detail shimmering and edge enhancement are all abundantly present making for an even greater disappointment of this already bad film.

1173436,"This movie tries to be a conservative version of Michael Moore, and fails miserably.  This movie might be ignored or simply laughed at if it weren't a symptom of the scientific illiteracy in the US.  Among the many failings and falsehoods of this movie are:1. It misrepresents the cases of the people supposedly ""expelled"". (They weren't)2. It displays stunning ignorance of evolution by natural selection (EBNS) and the evidence for it.3. It fails to present any case whatsoever for creationism or its politically-correctly renamed iteration, ""Intelligent Design.""4. The producers approached the scientists who participated under false pretenses.  And they then edited the interviews with these scientists to make them look foolish or sinister.5. It tries to smear EBNS and scientists generally with some completely unsupported connection to the Holocaust perpetrated by Nazi Germany. (This ham-handed and disgusting tactic is what drew the most fire from critics.)6. It fails to present the thousands of working scientists, including biologists such as Ken Miller, who are also firm believers in some kind of personal deity.Please search the web for expelledexposed to get the real story behind this movie and the supposedly ""expelled"" academics.  They were not ""expelled""; and this movie spreads bald lies about their situations.  Please also see the NOVA program ""Judgment Day"" about the Dover, PA trial of ID-creationism for the real story of ID (it is religion, not science:  even a conservative GW Bush appointee could clearly see that.)For the record and in accordance with items 2 and 5 above:  Nazi Germany's eugenics, like all eugenics plans, was an artificial selection program, determined by humans.  This is completely different from natural selection.  (Not survival of the fittest; but rather survival of those who are politically-favored.)  And, even if Hitler had invoked Charles Darwin as some kind of justification for his evil deeds (he didn't), he STILL would have been misunderstanding Darwin's idea of EBNS.  Darwin drew a crystal clear distinction between artificial human selection (in for instance the breeding of pigeons and livestock) and the workings of natural selection.  If you read, ""On the Origin of Species"" you will discover that for yourself.In addition:  ID is not science. I've read Behe and Dembski and other ID cdesign proponentsists [sic:  see Of Pandas and People]. They have but a single argument to make (they have no theory, no experiments, no data, no results) and I will summarize it: [Biological feature X] is too complicated for me to understand how it could have evolved, therefore God had to have done it, QED. This is simply a non sequitur. William Dembski's, my, or your lack of intellectual skills or knowledge neither requires nor implies anything about the nature of reality. A federal judge has ruled in detail that ID is religion. Magic explains nothing*. Magic is not science. Incredulity is not science: it is IGNORANCE. Science DISPELS ignorance by hypothesis and testing to find out the FACTS in the case.  (* If magic is allowed, then ANY effect can be equally well asserted to follow ANY cause; all rules of logic and evidence fail, and no conclusions can be drawn.)Why were film clips of Nazi Germany and concentration camps included in this film?  Ben Stein gives us the answer: In an interview with the Trinity Broadcasting Network, Ben Stein said the following amazing things in an interview with Paul Crouch, Jr.Stein: When we just saw that man, I think it was Mr. Myers [i.e. biologist P.Z. Myers], talking about how great scientists were, I was thinking to myself the last time any of my relatives saw scientists telling them what to do they were telling them to go to the showers to get gassed ... that was horrifying beyond words, and that's where science - in my opinion, this is just an opinion - that's where science leads you.Crouch: That's right.Stein: ...Love of God and compassion and empathy leads you to a very glorious place, and science leads you to killing people.Crouch: Good word, good word.That's your Ben Stein. That's what this film is about: trying to discredit science. You know, the discipline that brought you: vaccination, modern medicine, antibiotics, anesthesia, air travel, air conditioning, satellites, cell phones, modern agriculture, safe buildings and bridges. Who needs science?I strongly recommend that you save your money and spend it instead on, for instance:  Neil Shubin's ""Your Inner Fish,"" Matt Ridley's ""Genome,"" of Jared Diamond's ""The Third Chimpanzee.""",Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed

While CO2 is the heaviest gas in our atmosphere, all human and animal life exhale CO2 which is a beneficial gas that vegetation thrives on such as trees and plants that take in the CO2 and convert it back to oxygen. Also, the ""warming"" we are experiencing is due to the fact that climate changes occur in cycles. There have been record highs over one hundred years ago as well as record lows in between. The last few winters we've experienced were at record lows, particularly in upstate New York where temperatures dipped down to a fridgid -35F. Now what does that explain? In any part of the world climate does not remain stable where one would experience the same temperatures over and over again at a certain time of year since there are changes occurring all the time, it alternates.Volcanic eruptions would be a very big problem since a single volcano can release nearly ten times more toxic gases than all manmade emissions throughout the world combined. Third world nations account for environmental problems where there are virtually no strict codes on hazardous waste disposal. Hence, disease is rampant in these nations that have very few or no sanitation facilities by dumping solid waste directly into drinking water or into the ocean where deep water coral reefs thrive. Yes, there are deep water reefs in many parts of the world that encapsulate CO2 and other gases. Pollutants dumped into the sea are killing these reefs, thus releasing these gases into the atmosphere.True environmentalists are usually those employed by the logging industry that have done intense studies, maintaining nurseries, and replacing each hewned tree with two to four saplings. Younger trees, particularly saplings, thrive better on CO2 and have the tendency to release more oxygen than older specimens.We can only say that Al Gore has a lot of learning to do. He's just jumping to conclusions and listening to whatever data is available to him. This film would only be based on his opinions and not on fact.",N/A
245604,"I came here to write a review about a movie that I, quite frankly, I found slow and boring and a movie that did not hold my interest at all.  I read good reviews about this movie over the years so I rented it. I was bored. My wife would have been if she had not fallen asleep during the first 15 min. We turned the movie off after 1/2 hour. So I didn't get the hype. BUT, after seeing so many passionate lovers of this movie rate it 1 because of Lionsgate cuts, I'm wondering if that was enough to spoil the movie for the first time viewer.  Maybe it was. In any event, don't bother buying or renting this version of the movie. It isn't worth your time.",N/A
1305654,"I had to apologize to my wife for asking her to watch this film with me, instead of letting her want to go outside and wash her car.This movie was so slow and just didn't seem to go anywhere.  After the movie, I clicked on the bonus features section.  I wanted to see if the film maker offered any kind of verbal or printed apology for making us sit through this terrible movie.Not only did I have to waste nearly two hours of my precious time watching this lame movie, now I owe it to my wife that I'll have to wash her car for her, which will be my way of apologizing to her for wasting her time watching this lousy film with me.Boy, what a big disappointment!",N/A
467621,"Although he designed and directed a number of notable films, today William Cameron Menzies is best recalled as the director of the &#34;so bad it's good&#34; 1953 INVADERS FROM MARS. His work with the 1951 DRUMS IN THE DEEP SOUTH might be considered a build up to that ham-fisted style, for it has the same flatness. Sad to say, it has none of the same fun.The story concerns a Confederate effort to thwart Sherman's advance on Atlanta. Strange to say, however, Georgia seems to have been transplanted to the wild west for purposes of the film, which comes complete with a mesa on which the Confederates desire to plant their cannon and fire upon the railroad below. Throw in a love triangle and some of the most uninspired acting you can obtain and you have DRUMS IN THE DEEP SOUTH.Today the film is best recalled for the presence of actress Barbara Payton (1927-1967), a performer who trembled on the brink of stardom in the late 1940s and early 1950s before she self-destructed in a hog-wallow of sex, booze, drugs, and front page scandal. It is easy to see what the fuss was about: she has a dead-pan sexuality, larger-than-life beauty, and memorable speaking voice. Unfortunately, none of these qualities have much to do with either film or role, and even her cult-status can't make up for what is basically a remarkably shallow, incredibly silly, and deadly dull film.Unless you are desperate to see what Payton looked like on the screen before she ended up as a five dollar hooker working the Sunset Strip, DRUMS ALONG THE DEEP SOUTH is a film to avoid at all costs. Treat it as you would the plague.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",N/A
