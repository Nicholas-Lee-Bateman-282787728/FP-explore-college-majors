671354,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00005O4WC,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[18, 18]","After the first couple of songs, Engelbert really lets loose in this concert, even doing a terrific rap, which includes a moonwalk, as well as some nifty rock 'n' roll songs; the medley of ""Great Balls of Fire""/""Proud Mary"" is fabulous, and one of my favorite numbers in the show, and others include the gentle performance of ""The Shadow of Your Smile"" with solo piano accompaniment, the beautiful ""Love is a Many Splendored Thing"", and Eng's exquisite rendition of Lionel Richie's ""Still"".The sound and visual clarity are exceptional, and a rarity to have it this good for a live performance (the single released in 2000 however, ""How to Win Your Love"", is lip-synched). Daughter Louise Dorsay sings ""Heaven Help My Heart"", and though she doesn't have daddy's vocal chords (and who does), she is elegant and beautiful, with a lovely personality...and is certainly better than some of our current crop of pop singers.The band led by Eddie Tobin is terrific and play their heart out, and include seasoned musicians Brian Fox ~ keyboards, Mitch Reilly ~ sax, Dan Kent Sherrill ~ percussion, Dwight Smith ~ drums, Roy Vogt ~ bass, and Kenneth Cramer ~ guitar. Melissa Coleman and Regina Leigh King do a great job with the back-up vocals.Filmed at the London Palladium in 2000, this is a DVD that gets better with each viewing, with Engelbert wearing his years (he was 63 at the time) with amazing vitality and a musical gift that is wide-ranging and full of artistry; one also gets the sense of a man who has accepted the ups and downs of life with grace, and is immensely likeable. Total running time is 1 hour and 30 minutes.",5,"great entertainment, wonderful music",1103414400,"12 19, 2004",2004,1624,"['first', 'couple', 'songs', 'Engelbert', 'really', 'loose', 'concert', 'even', 'doing', 'terrific', 'rap', 'moonwalk', 'as', 'well', 'nifty', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'songs', 'medley', 'Great', 'Balls', 'Fire', '/', 'Proud', 'Mary', 'fabulous', 'one', 'favorite', 'numbers', 'show', 'others', 'include', 'gentle', 'performance', 'Shadow', 'Your', 'Smile', 'solo', 'piano', 'accompaniment', 'beautiful', 'Love', 'Many', 'Splendored', 'Thing', 'Eng', 'exquisite', 'rendition', 'Lionel', 'Richie', 'Still', 'sound', 'visual', 'clarity', 'are', 'exceptional', 'rarity', 'have', 'good', 'live', 'performance', 'single', 'released', '2000', 'however', 'How', 'Win', 'Love', 'lip-synched', 'Daughter', 'Louise', 'Dorsay', 'Heaven', 'Help', 'My', 'Heart', ""n't"", 'have', 'daddy', 'vocal', 'chords', 'who', 'elegant', 'beautiful', 'lovely', 'personality', 'certainly', 'better', 'current', 'crop', 'pop', 'singers.The', 'band', 'led', 'Eddie', 'Tobin', 'terrific', 'play', 'heart', 'include', 'seasoned', 'musicians', 'Brian', 'Fox', '~', 'keyboards', 'Mitch', 'Reilly', '~', 'sax', 'Dan', 'Kent', 'Sherrill', '~', 'percussion', 'Dwight', 'Smith', '~', 'drums', 'Roy', 'Vogt', '~', 'bass', 'Kenneth', 'Cramer', '~', 'guitar', 'Melissa', 'Coleman', 'Regina', 'Leigh', 'King', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'back-up', 'vocals.Filmed', 'London', 'Palladium', '2000', 'DVD', 'better', 'viewing', 'Engelbert', 'wearing', 'years', 'was', '63', 'time', 'amazing', 'vitality', 'musical', 'gift', 'wide-ranging', 'full', 'artistry', 'one', 'also', 'sense', 'man', 'who', 'accepted', 'ups', 'downs', 'life', 'grace', 'immensely', 'likeable', 'Total', 'running', 'time', '1', 'hour', '30', 'minutes']",N/A
671355,A1YG0WKFWO0VR2,B00005O4WC,Dennis Huskins,"[0, 0]",I have just now discovered Engelbert and i'm catching up on what a great singer he was. This DVD is a very good example of what a showman and powerful vocalist he is. You can tell he truly loves to perform and his talent is light years above all the so called singers of today. Engelbert Live with the Babe Salvetti orchestra is the best DVD i've sen so far but this one is a close second. My favorite cut on the DVD is How to Win Your Love but it does sound odd how his voice sudddenly changes as if he's lipsyching to a pre=recorded song. It may be that the band on stage couldn't duplictae the sound he had recorded the song in a studio with so it's understandable. His version of Love is a many Splendored Thing is a classic. I now will be catching up on every song he ever sang because --he is that good!,4,A Very Good DVD,1234310400,"02 11, 2009",2009,809,"['have', 'just', 'now', 'discovered', 'Engelbert', 'i', ""'m"", 'catching', 'up', 'what', 'great', 'singer', 'was', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'example', 'what', 'showman', 'powerful', 'vocalist', 'can', 'tell', 'truly', 'perform', 'talent', 'light', 'years', 'so', 'called', 'singers', 'today', 'Engelbert', 'Live', 'Babe', 'Salvetti', 'orchestra', 'best', 'DVD', 'i', ""'ve"", 'sen', 'so', 'far', 'one', 'close', 'second', 'favorite', 'cut', 'DVD', 'How', 'Win', 'Love', 'sound', 'odd', 'how', 'voice', 'sudddenly', 'lipsyching', 'pre=recorded', 'song', 'may', 'be', 'band', 'stage', 'could', ""n't"", 'duplictae', 'sound', 'had', 'recorded', 'song', 'studio', 'understandable', 'version', 'Love', 'many', 'Splendored', 'Thing', 'classic', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'catching', 'up', 'song', 'ever', 'sang', 'because', 'good']",N/A

The sound and picture quality is good. His voice was off several times, and I think he should of avoided the songs he can't really sing properly anymore......this show was rather boring - his movements are rather dead. There were a few good songs, with help from the band, but I frankly didn't carefor this show.
