257789,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,6301599896,A Customer,"[2, 3]","Summary:Frank Galvin (Paul Newman) appears to be a dried up, alcoholic attorney that seems more interested in chasing ambulances and drinking then actually working.  When a friend, Mickey Morrissey (Jack Warden), gets him a cut and dry case of medical negligence, Frank has to decide whether he wants to sober up and take it.  Eventually Frank has something of a revelation that a grave injustice has taken place here (a young woman is in a coma because she was given the wrong anesthetic) and instead of settling for the pittance that was initially offered, Frank decides to take the case to court.  Everything and everyone seems to be working against him, from the Judge (Milo O'Shea) to his newfound girlfriend (Charlotte Rampling) to his expert witness (Joe Seneca).  But, believing this case is worth pursuing, Frank pushes it through to the end and is surprised by the result.My Comments:The more movies I see with Paul Newman in them the more I realize that he is a superb actor.  He offers another brilliant portrayal in this movie and, frankly, is pretty much the entire movie.  The other characters seem to be hanging on to his coattails.The movie is interesting, but the story is not particularly astounding.  You can pretty much guess what is going to happen in the end because pretty much every court case that is turned into a movie is a victory for the underdog.  However, the court case, though it does serve to make or break the man, is really only peripheral to the transformation we see in Frank which is the focus of the movie.",4,Paul Newman does it again.,1050278400,"04 14, 2003",2003,1547,"['Summary', 'Frank', 'Galvin', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'be', 'dried', 'up', 'alcoholic', 'attorney', 'more', 'interested', 'chasing', 'ambulances', 'drinking', 'then', 'actually', 'working', 'When', 'friend', 'Mickey', 'Morrissey', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'cut', 'dry', 'case', 'medical', 'negligence', 'Frank', 'decide', 'sober', 'up', 'take', 'Eventually', 'Frank', 'something', 'revelation', 'grave', 'injustice', 'taken', 'place', 'here', 'young', 'woman', 'coma', 'was', 'given', 'wrong', 'anesthetic', 'instead', 'settling', 'pittance', 'was', 'initially', 'offered', 'Frank', 'take', 'case', 'court', 'Everything', 'everyone', 'be', 'working', 'Judge', 'Milo', ""O'Shea"", 'newfound', 'girlfriend', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'expert', 'witness', 'Joe', 'Seneca', 'believing', 'case', 'worth', 'pursuing', 'Frank', 'end', 'surprised', 'result.My', 'Comments', 'more', 'movies', 'see', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'more', 'realize', 'superb', 'actor', 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'movie', 'frankly', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'movie', 'other', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'hanging', 'coattails.The', 'movie', 'interesting', 'story', 'not', 'particularly', 'astounding', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'guess', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'end', 'pretty', 'much', 'court', 'case', 'turned', 'movie', 'victory', 'underdog', 'However', 'court', 'case', 'serve', 'make', 'break', 'man', 'really', 'only', 'peripheral', 'transformation', 'see', 'Frank', 'focus', 'movie']",N/A
257790,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6301599896,Acute Observer,"[5, 28]","This is a well-polished production that suffers from some over-acting (dramatic pauses). It is a drama about personal failures and the effect it has on the people who suffer from them. The film starts on a wintry day, snow is on the ground, an older man plays a pinball machine (symbolizing the chances of life?). Frank Galvin has time to waste. We see him putting on an act at a funeral home, and being rejected. His buddy Micky comes by to help him with a case of negligence. [Believable?] A woman went into a hospital to give birth but suffered a horrible fate that left her a vegetable. Who is responsible?A scene with the bishop tells about the defendant and the church hospital. [Could this happen at a non-church hospital?] Dr. David Gruber will testify for the plaintiff as an expert witness. The defense legal team is a large and prestigious law firm, seemingly as invincible as Goliath. Would they do anything unethical? A judge tries to arrange a deal and save valuable court time. No deal. Later the brother-in-law confronts Galvin about his failure to consult with his clients. [Is this grounds for disbarment?] Laura meets Frank and learns about his history; she is a friendly stranger. When Dr. Gruber goes away on vacation Galvin becomes frantic in finding a replacement. The film shows how testimony is rehearsed to present the right image (""horse-shedding"" the witness). The plaintiff's expert physician will be closely examined. [Does this seem very dramatic and emotional? Can a has-been lawyer overcome the odds? ""Frank Galvin"" is not an Earl Rogers.]The trial begins with testimony form the witnesses. The judge intervenes to ask a question. [Is this realistic or just another dramatic trick? Was this to fix the verdict?] There are discussions about the case. Galvin does some risky detective work to find the missing nurse. His partner Micky inadvertently (?) snoops and finds a secret about Laura that explains her actions. This leads to a violent and dramatic confrontation. [Believable?] Back in court Dr. Tower testifies about the patient. Can a Xerox copy be admitted into testimony? [Yes, to impeach a changed document. This film denies the reality, and we miss a ""Perry Mason"" moment.] The judge makes a ruling and tells the jury to disregard the testimony of the missing nurse. What will the jury decide? Galvin's summation asks for justice, an ambiguous plea. [You know a film needs a happy ending to commercially successful.] The judge tells the jury they are free to pick any amount of damages. [But this can often be reduced on appeal if it exceeds established standards.]This film sacrifices believable reality for drama. A law firm would not directly hire an undercover operative, that's what private investigators do (plausible deniability). Does the use of a double agent imply the defense knew of the discrepancies in the evidence? The rigging of this fairy tale story seems like something is wrong with the film writers or producers.",2,The Case of the Missing Nurse,1190592000,"09 24, 2007",2007,2975,"['well-polished', 'production', 'suffers', 'over-acting', 'dramatic', 'pauses', 'drama', 'personal', 'failures', 'effect', 'people', 'who', 'suffer', 'film', 'wintry', 'day', 'snow', 'ground', 'older', 'man', 'pinball', 'machine', 'symbolizing', 'chances', 'life', 'Frank', 'Galvin', 'time', 'waste', 'see', 'putting', 'act', 'funeral', 'home', 'being', 'rejected', 'buddy', 'Micky', 'help', 'case', 'negligence', 'Believable', ']', 'A', 'woman', 'went', 'hospital', 'give', 'birth', 'suffered', 'horrible', 'fate', 'left', 'vegetable', 'Who', 'responsible', 'scene', 'bishop', 'defendant', 'church', 'hospital', '[', 'Could', 'happen', 'non-church', 'hospital', ']', 'Dr.', 'David', 'Gruber', 'will', 'testify', 'plaintiff', 'expert', 'witness', 'defense', 'legal', 'team', 'large', 'prestigious', 'law', 'firm', 'seemingly', 'as', 'invincible', 'Goliath', 'Would', 'do', 'anything', 'unethical', 'judge', 'arrange', 'deal', 'save', 'valuable', 'court', 'time', 'deal', 'Later', 'brother-in-law', 'confronts', 'Galvin', 'failure', 'consult', 'clients', '[', 'grounds', 'disbarment', ']', 'Laura', 'meets', 'Frank', 'history', 'friendly', 'stranger', 'When', 'Dr.', 'Gruber', 'away', 'vacation', 'Galvin', 'frantic', 'finding', 'replacement', 'film', 'how', 'testimony', 'rehearsed', 'present', 'right', 'image', 'horse-shedding', 'witness', 'plaintiff', 'expert', 'physician', 'will', 'be', 'closely', 'examined', '[', 'seem', 'very', 'dramatic', 'emotional', 'Can', 'has-been', 'lawyer', 'odds', 'Frank', 'Galvin', 'not', 'Earl', 'Rogers', ']', 'trial', 'testimony', 'form', 'witnesses', 'judge', 'intervenes', 'ask', 'question', '[', 'realistic', 'just', 'dramatic', 'trick', 'Was', 'fix', 'verdict', 'are', 'discussions', 'case', 'Galvin', 'risky', 'detective', 'work', 'find', 'missing', 'nurse', 'partner', 'Micky', 'inadvertently', 'snoops', 'secret', 'Laura', 'actions', 'violent', 'dramatic', 'confrontation', 'Believable', ']', 'Back', 'court', 'Dr.', 'Tower', 'testifies', 'patient', 'Can', 'Xerox', 'copy', 'be', 'admitted', 'testimony', '[', 'Yes', 'impeach', 'changed', 'document', 'film', 'reality', 'miss', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'moment', ']', 'judge', 'ruling', 'jury', 'disregard', 'testimony', 'missing', 'nurse', 'What', 'will', 'jury', 'decide', 'Galvin', 'summation', 'justice', 'ambiguous', 'plea', 'know', 'film', 'happy', 'ending', 'commercially', 'successful', ']', 'judge', 'jury', 'are', 'free', 'pick', 'amount', 'damages', '[', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'reduced', 'appeal', 'established', 'standards', ']', 'film', 'believable', 'reality', 'drama', 'law', 'firm', 'would', 'not', 'directly', 'hire', 'undercover', 'operative', 'what', 'private', 'investigators', 'do', 'plausible', 'deniability', 'use', 'double', 'agent', 'imply', 'defense', 'knew', 'discrepancies', 'evidence', 'rigging', 'fairy', 'tale', 'story', 'something', 'wrong', 'film', 'writers', 'producers']",N/A
257791,A2MO0NUJ76FPG0,6301599896,"A. H. Lynde ""ahlynde""","[6, 6]","Simply put there is no American film of this genre that comes close.  Director Lumet darkly captures the naked power and corruption of the American civil trial system.  Actors O'Shea (the judge), Mason (the 'prince of darkness' defense counsel) and Charlotte Rampling (whose shock is best left unrevealed) are the epitome of the seedy wheels of what passes for justice and 'love'.  Newman, an alcoholic with one last prospect, struggles for redemption against mountainous odds, giving the most honest performance of his career.  Warden is Newman's essential wiser alter ego.  This film is no less than that rare cimematic device -- the allegory.  Each character represents a larger truth -- in addition to Mason, O'Shea, and Rampling, Joe Seneca as a black, ancient (degraded) doctor for the vegetative plaintiff; Catholic archidiocese bishop Ed Binns up to his collar in fraud; a nationally-renowned physician with secret blood on his hands; and a simple honest woman who wanted nothing more than to be a nurse - Lindsay Crouse in a career performance.  And there is the superb Mamet writing throughout.  This is a courtroom thriller that will nail you to your seat to the very end.  And absolutely true to life -- my view, at least, after 20 years as a lawyer.  I also teach law and never miss a chance to show this film to my students.

Paul Newman is fantastic as the broken down lawyer chasing what is likely to be his last big case. To win it, he has to  fight the famous doctors, the big hosital, the powerful, high-priced law  firm, a hostile judge and the Catholic Church. Oh, and throw in some  tactical blunders of his own, and a traitor girlfriend. But the case is  very compelling, and the peformances by the actors were powerful. Not just  Newman, but also James Mason as the opposing counsel, and Jack Warden as  his friend / guide. The only downside is that the sound is very muffled at  times, which may be due to Newman's amazing voice control, giving his  character the raspy, hoarse voice of a man who has drank too much for too  long.All these things add up to a great trial drama, with none of the  overly &quot;Hollywood&quot; treatment of movies like &quot;A Few Good  Men&quot;.

It was a real `Jack Nicholson in About Schmidt' type role; removed from his signature role yet just as infectious and quite possibly even more unbelievably brilliant.In `The Verdict' Newman plays Frank Galvin, an aging lawyer whose heyday is far behind him and so he has found himself drinking away his sorrows.  Frank is given a chance to revive his career when he is handed a medical malpractice suit.  Frank has to fight an uphill battle littered with a biased judge, deceitful friends and his own bad habits that always seem to get in his way.If there is a fault to be had with `The Verdict' it's that the film is predictable, but I have to question whether that is really a fault these days when it seems that the majority of movies are.The film rises above any and all faults with a slew of marvelously fleshed out performances, not just from Newman but from everyone.  James Mason is smooth and devilish as Ed Concannon, the lawyer going up against Frank, and Jack Warden is wonderfully complementing of Newman as his best friend and colleague Mickey.  Charlotte Rampling is beautifully elusive as Laura Fischer, and Milo O'Shea is memorable and engaging as Judge Hoyle.This film belongs to Paul Newman though.  He creates one of his greatest characters in Jack Galvin, showing immensely well the growing conflict within his own person.  He embellishes this man's drunken pride marvelously, and delivers to us a weathered and worn individual who is yearning for something greater than the sum of his own parts.  With a rasp reminiscent of Clint Eastwood, and a cowering demeanor that adds layers to this man's back-story, Newman delivers his finest screen performance, the performance for which he should have won the Oscar.Courtroom dramas are very easy to ruin.  You have to have an engaging cast to compliment an engaging story that is told through the eyes of an engaging director.  Thanks to three very engaging men (actor-Newman, writer-Mamet, director-Lumet) we have a marvelously crafted film that hits every mark extremely well.

257798,AXA7OH47LBXZ7,6301599896,"A Positive Guy ""Jay""","[4, 4]","Most, if not all of Paul Newman's films have him portraying characters that are cocky, shallow, and self-satisfied.  This is not the case with ""The Verdict.""  In this excellent Sidney Lumet masterpiece, we see Newman as down and out lawyer Frank P. Galvin unknowingly seeking restoration and redemption.As the movie opens, we see Galvin as an ambulance chasing drunk who spends most of his time in front of a pinball machine. What work he does get is in the form of charity given to him by an old friend, Mickey Morrissey, played skillfully by Jack Warden.  One of these cases is that of a young woman essentialy brain-dead because of the mistakes of two high powered doctors.At first, Galvin approaches it in his typical half-hearted 'give a damn' style.  But at a very important part of the film, Galvan rediscovers his honor and character.  He turns down a generous settlement from the doctors and hospital preferring instead to reach for justice by taking the case to trial.  Even his closest friends urge him to accept the settlement.  Seeking what is right over what is expedient becomes Galvin's driving force.As the movie unfolds he is challenged by ruthless and dishonest people who seek to thwart him at every turn.  The defense attorney Edward J. Concannon played brilliantly by James Mason is powerful and ruthless.  From there the movie evolves into a true 'edge of your seat' nailbiter between a man whose prime concern is winning at any costs and in any way possible and another whose primary motive is what is right.You will be kept guessing as this movie takes sharp turns through the maze of the legal system.  All of this as one man fights not only for the injured but for his own life.  This is the best film Paul Newman ever made and with a gifted supporting cast around him the film is first rate.Also, this DVD set contains a disc about the making of ""The Verdict"" with very interesting trivia and facts.This movie takes you through the whole range of human emotions.

257799,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6301599896,Austin Somlo,"[1, 1]","Viewed: 9/13Rate: 99/13: The Verdict is one of those rare films where Paul Newman doesn't act like Paul Newman. In fact, he actually acts. He himself admitted this in an interview. Of course, the more impossible the situation gets in The Verdict, the closer to the feeling of how predictable the movie has become.

257800,A1IBC9XP2LICQL,6301599896,A. Wolverton,"[0, 0]","Not only is 'The Verdict' a great film, it's also one of Paul Newman's best performances, maybe even his best. Newman plays Frank Galvin, an ambulance-chasing lawyer who once showed promise. Many years ago, Galvin tried to do the right thing and nearly got disbarred. He's had only four cases in three years and he's lost them all. Then one day a case falls in his lap. It's not really a case at all, but a settlement to avoid one. A girl suffered brain damage due to a mishap with an anesthetic. The Catholic-run hospital and two of Boston's most respected doctors want to settle out of court. But Galvin once again is faced with a choice, just as he was early in his career: Do what you're told and say nothing or try to do the right thing?David Mamet's script is absolutely marvelous. Most courtroom films contain way too much dialogue and useless talk, but not this one. Each word is carefully chosen, yet the script never comes across as stiff or rigid. Of course in the hands of masterful actors like Newman, James Mason, Jack Warden, and Charlotte Rampling (who has never received enough credit for this performance), the script sparkles with excitement. One scene in particular (I won't tell which one) could have really damaged Newman's career, but director Sidney Lumet expertly handles this and every other scene. An outstanding film that should have won the Best Actor Oscar for Newman.Unfortunately the only real extras on the DVD consist of brief interviews with the cast members, an audio commentary, and a few trailers. But don't let the lack of extras keep you from owning one of the best courtroom dramas ever filmed.129 minutes",5,"If the Charge is Great Acting, Newman is Guilty",1041638400,"01 4, 2003",2003,1646,"['Not', 'only', ""'The"", 'Verdict', 'great', 'film', 'also', 'one', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'best', 'performances', 'maybe', 'even', 'best', 'Newman', 'Frank', 'Galvin', 'ambulance-chasing', 'lawyer', 'who', 'once', 'showed', 'promise', 'Many', 'years', 'ago', 'Galvin', 'tried', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'nearly', 'got', 'disbarred', 'had', 'only', 'four', 'cases', 'three', 'years', 'lost', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'case', 'lap', 'not', 'really', 'case', 'settlement', 'avoid', 'one', 'girl', 'suffered', 'brain', 'damage', 'due', 'mishap', 'anesthetic', 'Catholic-run', 'hospital', 'two', 'Boston', 'most', 'respected', 'doctors', 'want', 'settle', 'court', 'Galvin', 'once', 'again', 'faced', 'choice', 'just', 'was', 'early', 'career', 'Do', 'what', ""'re"", 'told', 'say', 'nothing', 'try', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'David', 'Mamet', 'script', 'absolutely', 'marvelous', 'Most', 'courtroom', 'films', 'contain', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'dialogue', 'useless', 'talk', 'not', 'one', 'word', 'carefully', 'chosen', 'yet', 'script', 'never', 'across', 'stiff', 'rigid', 'course', 'hands', 'masterful', 'actors', 'Newman', 'James', 'Mason', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'who', 'never', 'received', 'enough', 'credit', 'performance', 'script', 'excitement', 'One', 'scene', 'particular', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'damaged', 'Newman', 'career', 'director', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'expertly', 'other', 'scene', 'outstanding', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'Newman.Unfortunately', 'only', 'real', 'extras', 'DVD', 'consist', 'brief', 'interviews', 'cast', 'members', 'audio', 'commentary', 'few', 'trailers', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'lack', 'extras', 'keep', 'owning', 'one', 'best', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'ever', 'minutes']",N/A

This is even worse than being an ambulance chaser (attorney who follows victims to hospitals).  He gets a shot at redeeming himself with a medical malpractice case involving a surgical patient who never recovered from her anesthesia.  Expiation and redemption are pivotal in this film and if you like that as a theme, and I do, this film is especially for you.

Thats a lot of talent & everyone is at their best in this movie which is often referred to as a courtroom drama but really only a very small amount of this film actually takes place in court. Much more time is spent at the local bars Frank Gavin has spent his waning years drowning in. Frank says at one point, ""its a long road that doesn't have any turns in it."" Well the court case that Jack Warden hands him on a silver platter is one of those turns. And to Franks credit he more than rises to the occasion but not without many moments of self-doubt and self-examination. Frank also begins a love affair while he is preparing to go to trial and that love affair with Charlotte Rampling is well drawn. Both are at all time low points in their lives. She keeps up with Frank when he is drinking and has as many tales of woe as he. That is yet another attractive component to this many layered look at Frank. As the relationship develops Frank is forced to see himself and his failures through her eyes and that as much as the pending court case contributes to his reformation. Charlotte Rampling gives a wonderful performance as a woman at the end of her rope, just barely hanging on. She needs the relationship to work but has very little left in the way of emotional resources. She too is looking to rehabilitate herself and is in a unique position to understand Franks efforts. Mamet is great at tough love and the most famous scene in the movie is certainly that.Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon is one of the most studied films by up and coming directors, and this one too has some of those masterful director signature moments in it, ie the last scene in the movie with Paul in his office after the trial and the phone ringing and ringing and Paul just sitting still in his newfound quiet.

Newman, in the role of Frank Galvin, a has-been, alcoholic attorney, is handed a case that no one seems to want. It involves a malpractice claim that a young couple are bringing on behalf of the wife's comatose sister. The hospital against which Newman brings the suit is represented by a powerful law firm and a top-notch defense attorney (played by James Mason) who will go to any lengths to win the case for his client.At first hesitant and unsure of himself, Galvin recognizes the justice of his cause, for it is evident to him that the hospital was grossly negligent in turning what should have been a routine operation into a tragedy that destroyed the life of a young woman. Galvin faces seemingly insurmountable odds. The judge mostly wants to get the case settled with as little difficulty as possible, and is greatly upset when Galvin refuses a settlement of $200,000 on behalf of his clients (of which his cut would have been approximately $70,000). To make matters worse, when Galvin's clients find out that he has refused this offer, because he recognizes it as grossly inadequate, they turn on him as well.Then, a woman (played by Charlotte Rampling) enters his life. Convinced that she is genuinely attracted to him, he takes her into his confidence, not recognizing that she is a plant by the defense.Despite all these setbacks, Galvin does not give up. He finally tracks down the only witness who can help him, a nurse who was on duty at the hospital on the crucial evening and who has the evidence to convict the hospital of negligence.Newman, supported by a great cast of actors, plays the part of Galvin perfectly, realistically, and convincingly.

Sidney Lumet directs Paul Newman and James Mason in a powerhouse film  which, though generally downbeat, never loses your attention and indeed  grips in its storyline and through these performances. Newman plays a  laywer who's seen the good times, (way back), but is now in a shambling and  hopeless state. His friend, played by the ever reliable Jack Warden, though  near the end of his tether at Newman's pathetic drunken state, gives him a  possible lifeline in a malpractice case. To Warden's relief he takes it,  but more important takes it seriously, and despite an ever spiralling  course of events which seem certain to bring about his final, total demise,  Newman finally triumphs. The finale is absorbing and superb! Alas, and not  terribly surprisingly based on the farce which is so often the Oscar  Ceremony, the film, Newman, and Mason all failed to win the oscars they so  richly deserved. A crime that Newman should lose for this, then be given  one of those pathetic Honorary Awards (remember when they gave one to the  previously un-Oscared Kirk Douglas for his performance having a stroke? No  doubt they thought it would be their last chance before he died, pleasingly  Mr. Douglas has proved them wrong), and then a genuine one for Newman the  next year in &quot;The Color Of Money&quot; because the first was seen  through for what it was: a too late apology. As for Mr. Mason, this sadly  would be his third and final failure at garnering an Oscar, (as he did pass  away two years later), beaten by Louis Gosset Jr. for a non-stop-yelling  performance which totally lacked the sublety which made Mason's so much  MORE menacing.

But Paul Newman, who grew out of the James Dean/Marlon Brando school of mannered method, gives his best performance as an actor, plagued as he has been by those blue eyes, mixed scripts and mannered performances in many many films.

257834,A192KEPM0HW6AC,6301599896,"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e...","[2, 2]","""The Verdict"" opens in a bittersweet, comical way, in which PaulNewman's portrayal of the alcholic lawyer Frank Galvin sort of recalls Walter Matthau's ""Whiplash Willie"" Gingrich from Billy Wilder's ""The Fortune Cookie"" (1966). We see Galvin sink beneath the gutter as he presses his business cards into the palms of grieving mourners. But, similarities end there: Given the most unlikely circumstance -- a malpractice suit -- Galvin sees the light at the end of the tunnel, redemption for the sorry mess he's made of his life. This movie unfolds like a revelation, but slowly, so that along with Galvin, we discover the small shred of remaining integrity within him that rises up and becomes courage: He turns down an insurance settlement to do battle against two renowned physicians, a corrupt Boston cardinal (played by the great character actor Edward Binns), a corrupt judge (Milo O'Shea)and the city's largest, slickest, law firm, whose legal team is headed by James Mason, in his final role as the suave and cynical Concanon. Galvin's transformation from self-professed ambulance chaser to a true man of the bar fighting for nothing but justice is one of cinema's most inspiring performances, because Galvin *is* a weak man, set upon by demons from his failed past, and by fear of an uncertain future. Still, he trudges on, sinks his teeth in and never backs down, despite one unlucky turn after another: His star witness disappears, his hired ""expert witness"" has a second-rate medical background, and the judge strikes out almost every shred of evidence favourable to his case. Yet, through his conviction and sheer will power, Galvin convinces the jury of the malpractice commited against his client, a woman put in a coma bynegligent doctors.Watching Frank's transformation is simply awe-inspiring, becausescreenwriter David Mamet wrote it so subtly, and because it happens to Newman over the course of the movie. There's no ""light bulb look"" that comes over him all of the sudden; Rather, we can see the dim flicker slowly and gradually burn to a raging flame.Director Sidney Lumet brilliantly captured the human drama of ""TheVerdict"" by letting the actors and the dialogue carry the movie; It's far less cinematic than his earlier movies such as ""Serpico"" or ""Twelve Angry Men."" This really lets the viewer get into the characters: Not only do Newman and Mason shine, but Jack Warden (as his gruff mentor), Lindsey Crouse and Charlotte Rampling really help flesh out the movie and make it utterly believable through their conviction to character.""The Verdict"" ends properly: Laura Fischer(Rampling), who has seduced Frank and reluctantly betrayed him, telephones him to make amends. But Frank, stronger from the ordeal of his life, maintains his integrity, knowing who is on the other end of the line, never picks up. Now not only has his client won, but he's won back his soul. Straight cut to black, titles.I was so taken by this movie, that I was certain that Newman and Mason won Oscars for their performances. I was wrong.

257835,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6301599896,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 3]","It is one rare film on a court case that may make us believe in the justness of jury justice. Frank Galvin, played by Paul Newman, is an alcoholic, and not an anonymous one at all. He nearly was debarred for it. He has a case that has all characteristics of a lost case. It is against well considered doctors, even authorities in their field, working for a Catholic hospital and ruining the life of a pregnant poor woman by sheer negligence, and then trying to cover it up by making the admitting nurse in the delivery room perjure herself and falsify the admittance document. The point is that this nurse is covered by the other nurse in the operating room and the first nurse has been forced to resign from her position and even her profession, then move out of the state of Massachusetts to get another job. The trick in this court case is that the judge is hostile to Frank Galvin and yet somewhere in his mind he has some kind of sense of justice. He will emphasize the testimony of that fired nurse when accepting the objection of the defense counselor and having the testimony struck off the record. And the jury will of course have heard and will of course keep in mind that testimony and the defense will lose their case, and the doctors will be found guilty of negligence and Frank Galvin will win the case for the sister of the wasted patient and that sister's husband. We should rethink jury justice because there are too many cases where the jury is not just at all and then there are enormous numbers of appeals, and even some executions of innocent people. Some may say that jury justice is the least bad system, and we should consider that is not good enough. The appeal procedures should be reexamined and no irreversible sentence, like the death penalty, should be allowed of any crime at all. Better have a criminal rot in jail than an innocent person executed. All documents whatsoever have to be admissible in court, especially since if a testimony is refused in one court it can never be used again in any other court. Then we have to find procedures to verify and validate testimonies or documents, but they must not be crossed out, especially by one single judge on the basis of eventually one other anterior judge's decision. Jurisprudence is also fine and dandy but there too there should be some fair and just procedures to assess such elements and their validity in any posterior case. This film is a great film that shows all the short comings of jury justice even if the outcome is positive. It is rarely so, or it is too often the reverse.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",5,"The jury is the law, when they are not afraid",1225152000,"10 28, 2008",2008,2704,"['one', 'rare', 'film', 'court', 'case', 'may', 'make', 'believe', 'justness', 'jury', 'justice', 'Frank', 'Galvin', 'played', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'alcoholic', 'not', 'anonymous', 'one', 'nearly', 'was', 'debarred', 'case', 'characteristics', 'lost', 'case', 'well', 'considered', 'doctors', 'even', 'authorities', 'field', 'working', 'Catholic', 'hospital', 'ruining', 'life', 'pregnant', 'poor', 'woman', 'sheer', 'negligence', 'then', 'trying', 'cover', 'up', 'making', 'admitting', 'nurse', 'delivery', 'room', 'perjure', 'falsify', 'admittance', 'document', 'point', 'nurse', 'covered', 'other', 'nurse', 'operating', 'room', 'first', 'nurse', 'been', 'forced', 'resign', 'position', 'even', 'profession', 'then', 'move', 'state', 'Massachusetts', 'get', 'job', 'trick', 'court', 'case', 'judge', 'hostile', 'Frank', 'Galvin', 'yet', 'somewhere', 'mind', 'kind', 'sense', 'justice', 'will', 'emphasize', 'testimony', 'fired', 'nurse', 'when', 'accepting', 'objection', 'defense', 'counselor', 'having', 'testimony', 'struck', 'off', 'record', 'jury', 'will', 'course', 'have', 'heard', 'will', 'course', 'keep', 'mind', 'testimony', 'defense', 'will', 'lose', 'case', 'doctors', 'will', 'be', 'found', 'guilty', 'negligence', 'Frank', 'Galvin', 'will', 'win', 'case', 'sister', 'wasted', 'patient', 'sister', 'husband', 'should', 'rethink', 'jury', 'justice', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'cases', 'where', 'jury', 'not', 'just', 'then', 'are', 'enormous', 'numbers', 'appeals', 'even', 'executions', 'innocent', 'people', 'may', 'say', 'jury', 'justice', 'least', 'bad', 'system', 'should', 'consider', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'appeal', 'procedures', 'should', 'be', 'reexamined', 'irreversible', 'sentence', 'death', 'penalty', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'crime', 'Better', 'have', 'criminal', 'rot', 'jail', 'innocent', 'person', 'executed', 'documents', 'have', 'be', 'admissible', 'court', 'especially', 'testimony', 'refused', 'one', 'court', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'used', 'again', 'other', 'court', 'Then', 'have', 'find', 'procedures', 'verify', 'validate', 'testimonies', 'documents', 'must', 'not', 'be', 'crossed', 'out', 'especially', 'one', 'single', 'judge', 'basis', 'eventually', 'one', 'other', 'anterior', 'judge', 'decision', 'Jurisprudence', 'also', 'fine', 'dandy', 'too', 'should', 'be', 'fair', 'just', 'procedures', 'assess', 'such', 'elements', 'validity', 'posterior', 'case', 'film', 'great', 'film', 'short', 'comings', 'jury', 'justice', 'even', 'outcome', 'positive', 'rarely', 'so', 'too', 'often', 'reverse.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",N/A

Paul Newman was awsome depicting the man, pique on the world and suffering together with his inner child.

257857,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6301599896,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 8]","Sidney Lumet was fortunate that Paul Newman was giving one of the best performances of his distinguished career in front of the camera on &quot;The Verdict,&quot; because this 1982 courtroom drama has a fatal flaw that might othrwise have sunk the film.  I do not know if the fault lies with David Mamet's screenplay or Barry Reed's original novel, but one of them is definitely the guilty party in this film that otherwise features a steallar script and grand performances from a veteran cast.Newman, in an Oscar nominated role, is Frank Galvin, a cynical and alcoholic ambulance chaser who is tossed a bone by old friend Mickey Morrissey (Jack Warden) in the form of a personal injury suit.  A young woman went into a hospital, owned by the Roman Catholic Church, was given the wrong anesthetic, became comatose, and is never coming back.  The idea is that Frank will do the paperwork, accept the settlement offer, and go back to sinking into oblivion.  But circumstances convince him to get his day in court and go for broke.One of the key dyanmics of this film is that even as Galvin has sunk so low as a lawyer, his opponent, Ed Concannon (James Mason, also deservedly nominated for an Oscar) represents one of the most corrupt large corporate law films in film history.  Concanno will literally do everything possible to defend his client, as we see over the course of the film.  Clearly the goal for Concanno is not justice but victory, while for Galvin the two become one in the same.  Mason's performance is as strong as Newman's, mainly because Mamet has written some great scenes for each actor's character.  But then, think of what is involved to make Newman the underdog in a major Hollywood movie.The flaw in the movie comes when we learn that while Concanno has an army of associates as well as a large law firm and the weight of the local archdioesce behind him, Galvin might actually have the truth on his side.  The case comes down to the claim of a proverbial last minute surprise witness as to what &quot;really&quot; happened and exactly what was the mistake that made the young woman brain dead.  This becomes more than a case of contradictory testimony but one of contradictory records as well.  At this point the every ready Concanno pulls out the appropriate legal precedent to have the piece of evidence thrown out.  The judge agrees, Galvin throws a fit, and the verdict comes down to what sort of an empassioned speech our heroes gives in his closing.The only problem is that the rule is wrong, and even viewers whose legal background consists of several seasons of &quot;L.A. Law,&quot; &quot;Law &amp; Order,&quot; &quot;The Practice&quot; or even &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; can probably spot the flaw in the judge's reasoning.  Even if they cannot come up with a sound legal basis for overturning the ruling, they will recognize on a fundamental level that this is just not right.  I have every reason to believe that the twelves jurors true sitting in judgment of the case recognize the sense of injustice as well and just might have their minds made up before Galvin's closing argument.Granted, most viewers are probably not as offended by this plot device as I am, especially given the mesmirizing performances of Newman and Mason.

He plays the role of a lawyer who is well past his prime, mostly because he's an alcoholic.  He hasn't taken a case in years and spends a lot of time in bars.His friend and fellow lawyer, Jack Warden, takes pity on him and gives him a case which seems open and shut.  A young woman was  giving birth in a Catholic hospital and something went horribly wrong.  Not only did the baby die but she was left a virtual vegetable.  Her sister and her husband want to sue the hospital and it looks like an open and shut case that will garner some money for both the lawyer and his clients that will never come to trial.  But then Newman goes to the hospital, sees the poor woman in her sorry state and changes his mind. The archdiocese very well funded and hires a big-time law firm headed by James Mason.  They coach their witnesses and it looks like Paul Newman and his clients will lose the case.Of course the audience is rooting for Paul Newman.  And of course it seems impossible to win this case.

A former editor of his college law review and partner in a prestigious law firm, he is now an ambulance chaser and alcoholic.  A professional lapse in judgment which led to almost being disbarred and to the end of his marriage has taken its toll.  A friend and former colleague, Mickey Morrissey (Warden) refers him a 'softball' case which should easily settle out of court with the insurance company for a nice fee.  With only ten days before the case goes to court (Frank has forgotten) his conscience starts to bother Frank and he really believes he can go to court and win, contrary to the client's wishes and everyone else's advice.

257861,ABE8YHLYSM15G,6301599896,Luke Killion,"[0, 0]","""The Verdict"" is a 1982 film directed by Sidney Lumet. This story would obviously be most enjoyable for fans of legal drama, similar to the novels of John Grisham. Like all important legal stories, the issues at the heart of the matter are very controversial. Huge lawsuits can often be make or break type deals for the people involved, so the stakes as portrayed in this story are very high.The framework for this story revolves around medical malpractice. It says alot about patient rights and to what extent doctors are responsible for the lives of people they treat. The doctors as portrayed here are obviously being accused of some pretty serious wrongdoing, but they are still shown to be very human. They are not monsters who set out to deliberately ruin lives. They are for the most part forthcoming and earnest. The predictament that they find themselves in speaks to the pressures involved in their jobs, and the heavy tax upon body and mind that is implied in their everyday routine. Doctors can often be miracleworkers and so much is expected of them. When they fail even once, there is little tolerance for excuses. So this movie was fascinating because there doesn't appear to be a very clearcut right and wrong at first.Paul Newman's character is the vehicle on which the story is told. He plays Frank Gavin, a down on his luck attorney in Boston whose former partner Jack Warden (Mickey Morrissey) gives him break in steering the medical malpractice suit his way.  Gavin is very much a Boston persona; his bio is laid out in the beginning of the story as the legal counsel for the Catholic Hospital set to battle him does some digging into his past. Gavin graduated from B.C. Law school in 1952 but hit hard times with allegations of jury tampering and a bad divorce. The opening scenes also witness his heavy drinking, as he repeatedly orders Bushmills and chugs beer with a cracked egg, Rocky Balboa style. His character seems very much in the mold of a Kennedyite; a promising leader beset by hard luck and scandal who tries to take on the system.The unfolding legal dilemma has Boston as its backdrop, with the plantiffs being an Irish middle aged married couple, the Doneghys. The case in question involves the wife's sister, who while pregnant asphixiated during the anesthisia process. The Hospital was one owned by the Catholic Church, so various priests within the Archdiocese are on the other side of the case. Their lawyer is the grandiose Ed Concannon, played very well by James Mason. This story has some twists and turns that are typical to any courtroom drama, but Newman's character and his big gamble on refusing an initial out of court settlement make the case a must win for him.",4,Courtroom drama starring Paul Newman,1366416000,"04 20, 2013",2013,2714,"['Verdict', '1982', 'film', 'directed', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'story', 'would', 'obviously', 'be', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'fans', 'legal', 'drama', 'similar', 'novels', 'John', 'Grisham', 'important', 'legal', 'stories', 'issues', 'heart', 'matter', 'are', 'very', 'controversial', 'Huge', 'lawsuits', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'make', 'break', 'type', 'deals', 'people', 'involved', 'stakes', 'portrayed', 'story', 'are', 'very', 'high.The', 'framework', 'story', 'around', 'medical', 'malpractice', 'alot', 'patient', 'rights', 'what', 'extent', 'doctors', 'are', 'responsible', 'lives', 'people', 'treat', 'doctors', 'portrayed', 'here', 'are', 'obviously', 'being', 'accused', 'pretty', 'serious', 'wrongdoing', 'are', 'still', 'shown', 'be', 'very', 'human', 'are', 'not', 'monsters', 'who', 'set', 'out', 'deliberately', 'ruin', 'lives', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'forthcoming', 'earnest', 'predictament', 'find', 'speaks', 'pressures', 'involved', 'jobs', 'heavy', 'tax', 'body', 'mind', 'implied', 'everyday', 'routine', 'Doctors', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'miracleworkers', 'so', 'much', 'expected', 'When', 'fail', 'even', 'once', 'little', 'tolerance', 'excuses', 'So', 'movie', 'was', 'fascinating', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'very', 'clearcut', 'right', 'wrong', 'first.Paul', 'Newman', 'character', 'vehicle', 'story', 'told', 'Frank', 'Gavin', 'down', 'luck', 'attorney', 'Boston', 'former', 'partner', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'Mickey', 'Morrissey', 'break', 'steering', 'medical', 'malpractice', 'suit', 'way', 'Gavin', 'very', 'much', 'Boston', 'persona', 'bio', 'laid', 'out', 'beginning', 'story', 'legal', 'counsel', 'Catholic', 'Hospital', 'set', 'battle', 'digging', 'past', 'Gavin', 'graduated', 'B.C', 'Law', 'school', '1952', 'hit', 'hard', 'times', 'allegations', 'jury', 'tampering', 'bad', 'divorce', 'opening', 'scenes', 'also', 'witness', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'repeatedly', 'orders', 'Bushmills', 'chugs', 'beer', 'cracked', 'egg', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'style', 'character', 'very', 'much', 'mold', 'Kennedyite', 'promising', 'leader', 'beset', 'hard', 'luck', 'scandal', 'who', 'take', 'system.The', 'unfolding', 'legal', 'dilemma', 'Boston', 'backdrop', 'plantiffs', 'being', 'Irish', 'middle', 'aged', 'married', 'couple', 'Doneghys', 'case', 'question', 'wife', 'sister', 'who', 'pregnant', 'asphixiated', 'anesthisia', 'process', 'Hospital', 'was', 'one', 'owned', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'so', 'various', 'priests', 'Archdiocese', 'are', 'other', 'side', 'case', 'lawyer', 'grandiose', 'Ed', 'Concannon', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'James', 'Mason', 'story', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'typical', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'Newman', 'character', 'big', 'gamble', 'refusing', 'initial', 'court', 'settlement', 'make', 'case', 'must', 'win']",N/A
257862,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,6301599896,"Maine Writer ""David""","[5, 5]","Ernest Becker, in his remarkably beautiful and insightfulThe Denial of Death, tells of how our mortality works to transfigure our lives into tales of overcoming -- of transforming ourselves from mortal creatures leading pointless lives into parts of an overarching eternal scheme. It is in this we find meaning. And so our life stories become crafted into heroic narratives.And so it is in The Verdict, a movie that gets it right in both the large and the small.  As a lawyer by training, I can say with great confidence that very few legal dramas and thrillers have so well and accurately depicted the lawyer's life. It is true in the details and in the broad strokes. Within minutes, The Verdict transports us into a world that not only rings true, but is true.  From there, we focus in on a critical ethical conundrum, as well as the nexus between the symbolic (and heroic) in human nature and the venal practicalities of real life. With a brilliant, nuanced performance from Paul Newman, the central issue in the story gains a luminosity and clarity that will make The Verdict one of those timeless stories that demonstrate the lasting significance of cinema as storytelling.Some spoilers follow.Okay, all that being said, Paul Newman plays a lawyer who has lost his moorings. We learn that he began his career as a brilliant, promising law school graduate. Top of his class. Order of the Coif (the law school equivalent of Phi Beta Kappa on steroids). Fancy job at a fancy firm. And then, he sees the sordid underbelly of the law, the venality of his employers, and gets set up for a fall. Either he looks the other way at the criminal behavior of his firm, or he loses his license to practice law and maybe spends years in jail. And so, facing this choice, the idealism of this idealistic young lawyer loses out. He goes along with the cover up and loses his job to boot. His wife leaves him. And then, he begins a rather slow unwind into alcohol, negligence, and meaninglessness. A lost soul, in other words.The Verdict picks up when Newman's character finds himself at the end of what may be his terminal losing streak.  A new case is referred to him, and it will be the last, it appears. It is, Newman's character later recounts, ""the case."" It will be the death of him, or his redemption. Unfortunately, that isn't exactly consistent with his duty to the couple that hired him (although they really aren't his clients at all -- he represents a comatose young woman clinging to life as a result of medical malpractice). Suddenly realizing his own redemption is at stake, he rejects a handsome settlement offer without even advising the couple (his ethical obligations required him to tell them), and takes a half-assed stab at going to trial on the case.  As his plan unravels -- including a disappearing witness who was the key to his case -- Newman has no choice but to go forward. To find out what he's really made of.  To face down an insuperable foe and prevail, or die trying.Capped off with a closing argument that is both incredibly moving and mercifully short (a hallmark of David Mamet's wonderful dialogue), The Verdict's ending may not be what you expect, but it is eminently meaningful, appropriate, and intelligent.P.S.  InA Few Good Men (Special Edition), you may note how Tom Cruise likely mimicked Paul Newman's performance in The Verdict.

People in his world start out desperate and stay desperate trying to do the wrong things for the right reasons, or doing the right thing despite their own corrupt souls. The Verdict is one of Mamet's finer works, and in the hands of director Sidney Lumet, it becomes a shining example of how story makes character, character makes story, and both force a vision on a sensitive director.Set in the maximium Catholic world of Boston, the Verdict tells the tale of a pretty boy whose failure to believe in deep corruption has turned him into a numb fool. The Church preaches redemption, but offers none, and Frank Galvin knows this deep in his soul, which is why he can't leave the womb-like sepia of his bar to face the blue cold. He is pityful, useless and defeated as only a pretty boy can be wrecked. But this modern reading of the Book of Job doesn't end there. Offered a gimme case, Galvin heads right for the gutter, until, in a moment of clarity, he visits the bleak ward where the object of the lawsuit rots in the arms of mother Church.Arrayed against this consummate loser are God, and the Prince of Darkness in concert. James Mason's valedictorian role is among his finest, so clean, so unafraid of turning men and women into whores and liars; he is a black hole of confidence and Mamet shows again and again how Concannon and his people are great lawyers, while Galvin can barely think.Things go from bad to worse: the family of the destroyed woman want to settle; the doctor tapped for testimony disappears; the expert witness is a hack doctor (and the unspoken racial overtones of who is credible and who is not are one of the most shocking parts of this film); and his key testimony and witness are disallowed unfairly.This is a writer writing properly: no breaks, no luck, no hope in the slightest for Frank Galvin. He wants redemption, he's going to get a belly full of it. The vicious dialogs between Charlotte Rampling's troubled character and Newman are so perfect and acidic that I cringe. A great example of two characters working from different internal scripts.There is so much good in this film, that I watch it over and over again, sometimes for the East Coast winter ambiance, sometimes for the joy of watching James Mason sneer, sometimes to watch Paul Newman beg Milo O'Shea.

The one line "" there is no other case... there is just this case "" says it all for me.I also love the ending. I remember the impact it had when I saw it in the theatre for the first time.

257871,AL4MKKO24563R,6301599896,Michael K. Beusch,"[107, 109]","During the first 25 years of his career, Paul Newman played characters who were confident and self-assured. Being a great actor, Newman was always able to infuse his characters with frailties and vulnerabilities that made them well-rounded and three dimensional. From Rocky Graziano to Cool Hand Luke to Doug Roberts (The Towering Inferno), Newman played self-confident characters who were strong and took charge of a situation. Perhaps this lack of frailty is the reason why Newman was able to play much younger characters well into his 50's (in 1981's Absence of Malice, the audience fully accepted that the then 56 year old Newman could be romantically involved with the then 35 year old Sally Field).In The Verdict, however, Newman is almost shocking in his hesitancy and self doubt. As attorney Frank Galvin, life has beaten him down so much, he seems like a man far older than his years who is afraid to do anything for fear that tragedy and bad luck will once again crush him. For the first time, Newman seems more like a victim than a survivor -- stammering, hesitant, weak, alcoholic and defeated. Even his courtroom summation at the end of the film is halting and hesitant. In a film full of fine actors (James Mason, Charlotte Rampling, Jack Warden, Milo O'Shea, Lindsay Crouse, etc.), Newman still stands out. It's an unbelievably great performance and a great companion piece to The Hustler -- ""Fast Eddie"" Felson after life has chewed him up and spit him out.Unfortunately, Paul Newman, once again, did not win the Oscar for Best Actor -- Ben Kingsley won for Ghandi. Unlike with The Hustler, however, Newman wasn't really robbed, but was actually the victim of bad luck. Kingsley was born to play Ghandi and gave the performance of his life. In most other years, Newman probably would have run away with the Oscar. In 1982, however, he had the bad luck to be up against an actor who literally became one of the most revered and admired men in history. While no one can say that Kingsley didn't deserve the honor, it is still a shame that Paul Newman did not win an Oscar for his flawed, weak and defeated Frank Galvin.",5,Newman's Best Work,1021420800,"05 15, 2002",2002,2133,"['first', '25', 'years', 'career', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'played', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'confident', 'self-assured', 'Being', 'great', 'actor', 'Newman', 'was', 'always', 'able', 'infuse', 'characters', 'frailties', 'vulnerabilities', 'made', 'well-rounded', 'three', 'dimensional', 'Rocky', 'Graziano', 'Cool', 'Hand', 'Luke', 'Doug', 'Roberts', 'Towering', 'Inferno', 'Newman', 'played', 'self-confident', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'strong', 'took', 'charge', 'situation', 'Perhaps', 'lack', 'frailty', 'reason', 'why', 'Newman', 'was', 'able', 'play', 'much', 'younger', 'characters', 'well', '50', '1981', 'Absence', 'Malice', 'audience', 'fully', 'accepted', 'then', '56', 'year', 'old', 'Newman', 'could', 'be', 'romantically', 'involved', 'then', '35', 'year', 'old', 'Sally', 'Field', '.In', 'Verdict', 'however', 'Newman', 'almost', 'shocking', 'hesitancy', 'self', 'doubt', 'attorney', 'Frank', 'Galvin', 'life', 'beaten', 'down', 'so', 'much', 'man', 'far', 'older', 'years', 'who', 'afraid', 'do', 'anything', 'fear', 'tragedy', 'bad', 'luck', 'will', 'once', 'again', 'crush', 'first', 'time', 'Newman', 'more', 'victim', 'survivor', 'stammering', 'hesitant', 'weak', 'alcoholic', 'defeated', 'Even', 'courtroom', 'summation', 'end', 'film', 'halting', 'hesitant', 'film', 'full', 'fine', 'actors', 'James', 'Mason', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'Milo', ""O'Shea"", 'Lindsay', 'Crouse', 'etc', 'Newman', 'still', 'out', 'unbelievably', 'great', 'performance', 'great', 'companion', 'piece', 'Hustler', 'Fast', 'Eddie', 'Felson', 'life', 'chewed', 'up', 'spit', 'out.Unfortunately', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'once', 'again', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'won', 'Ghandi', 'Hustler', 'however', 'Newman', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'robbed', 'was', 'actually', 'victim', 'bad', 'luck', 'Kingsley', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'Ghandi', 'gave', 'performance', 'life', 'most', 'other', 'years', 'Newman', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'run', 'away', 'Oscar', '1982', 'however', 'had', 'bad', 'luck', 'be', 'up', 'actor', 'who', 'literally', 'became', 'one', 'most', 'revered', 'admired', 'men', 'history', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'Kingsley', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'honor', 'still', 'shame', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'Oscar', 'flawed', 'weak', 'defeated', 'Frank', 'Galvin']",N/A

257877,A237RLQXTL55RG,6301599896,off the tropic,"[0, 0]","Paul Newman as the idealistic lawyer Frank Galvin in Sidney Lumet's masterpiece ""The Verdict"" is his finest performance and the grand culmination of his remarkable career. A Paul Newman performance is always good, but his portrayal of Frank Galvin has that touch of greatness that puts it in the company of the finest performances in film history. Newman proved that he is one of a handful of actors in Hollywood history who got better at his craft with age. His introspective, even cerebral, performance is reminiscent of Brando at his finest.Frank Galvin opts to give justice a voice in a cynical system designed to misrepresent the powerless.  Newman is entirely at home with Galvin's moral intensity as a struggling lawyer who has resolved to represent the family of a comatose victim permanently paralyzed after being given the wrong anesthetic. Every glance of Newman contributes to the moving testament of a lawyer who dares to change his life and risk all even when prudence and better sense counsels that he seek a pragmatic course of compromise and cooperation with colleagues in high places. The daily punishing grind of Frank Galvin fighting his demons, and living by the spirit of the symbols of justice within the courtroom despite the almost universal cynicism of his profession is a deeply moving experience. His friendship with Mickey, brilliantly brought to screen with Jack Warden's usual robust charm, helps him stay rooted. There are other promising allies that Galvin desperately needs, like Laura (Charlotte Rampling), who offers what seems like an authentic hand of friendship, but the twists and turns of this story of a lawyer and his Quixotic attempt to bring old fashioned American ideals of justice back into the courtroom, make this game of trust a treacherous business.Galvin tries hard to get back to his early promise as a brilliant lawyer but self-pity, his bouts of drinking, his lack of belief in himself, bring those rare upsurges of faith crashing down to earth. Lumet's camera captures the sheer fright of Galvin going alone against the system. Newman's face exudes the worn down honesty of Frank Galvin, from his moments of utter despair and hopelessness, to a barely perceptible gathering of inspiration, as he gains the confidence to put all the pieces together to successfully defend the defenseless victim of a surgery gone horribly wrong.The final declamatory scene in the courtroom redeems the washed up lawyer image that Galvin has had to live with as an alcoholic lawyer. The reputation of working on a string of cases he has badly lost makes his comeback a punishing experience. Galvin has to win back his credibility among key partners in the medical and legal establishment around him. Working against these odds with extraordinary courage in a long convoluted journey leads up appropriately to the moral climax of this last scene. Frank Galvin's final rebuttal comes at the end of a spiritual journey, one that sees him find every word in that speech paid with personal sadness and moral outrage. Idealism is hard business, and Galvin's ability to stay rooted to his principles come with the terrible price of alienating almost every well connected professional around him.John Galvin's arduous battle to convene credible witnesses to testify for him in the courtroom has added more scars on his care worn face. Newman's face lends credibility to Galvin's high ideals and is a perfect complement to the moral outrage of this final speech. They eloquence of this last speech quietens his severest critics in the courtroom. This grand declamatory moment begins with a dirge like lament: ""You know, so much of the time we are just lost...."" and ends with the Emersonian affirmation of what lies within us all: ""I believe there is justice in our hearts"". This is a great lyrical moment in cinema and a testament to David Mamet's talent for writing stirring rhetoric that harks back to the American movies of old. Lumet brings back the Capra-esque idealism that was so much a part of Hollywood culture in the irrepressible 1930s, represented movingly in the classic Jimmy Stewart character, Jefferson Smith, in Frank Capra's ""Mr Smith Goes to Washington"".Lumet's dramatic technique in ""The Verdict"" is to build tension with a quieter style. He uses a musical score only sparingly. Lumet opts to stress the interiority of his protagonist by alternating long silent shots with jarring sounds of Galvin alone in his room, or at the bar, fighting to keep his ideals and conscience alive, and his addictions, and uncertainties, at bay. This is pure cinema borne out of an austere visual sense that recalls Robert Bresson and Carl Theodor Dreyer. It also marks a trend in cinema in the 1970s and 1980s when an elite set of American filmmakers relies less on music and more on silence and everyday sounds to build mood, character, and dramatic tension of a scene. Alan J. Pakula's moody opening credits in ""All the President's Men"" is very close in spirit to the opening minutes of ""The Verdict"" with the sharp claps of a typewriter on a paper producing the same effect as the sounds of Newman as Galvin fighting to win back his last few cents on a pinball machine before he raps the table for his early morning whisky. This stylistic innovation that opts to go for a quieter, more realistic style in a decade known for producing films with unforgettable music soundtracks (The Godfather, Taxidriver) works remarkably well to sound out the meditative, somber mood piece like this Sidney Lumet masterpiece.""The Verdict"" is one of the finest films from that wonderful decade for the movies - the 1980s - but it is also a sad reminder of the sort of film that could hardly be made again. For one thing we have lost a distinct moral fervor in cinema that came with the likes of an actor like Newman with the closing of that last great decade of Hollywood films. Newman's kind belongs to a culture and age that is forever lost, the age that saw the likes of Heston, Brando, and Lancaster bring in a new form of moral outrage to American film and popular culture. The Verdict not only offers the viewer one of the great Newman performances but also what may be one of the last grand aesthetic documents of what is remaining of Hollywood's golden age, its fading pageantry in the early 1980s.",5,Newman's Moral Fervor,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,6325,"['Paul', 'Newman', 'idealistic', 'lawyer', 'Frank', 'Galvin', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'masterpiece', 'Verdict',

Frank is a washed-up alcoholic Boston lawyer who has been reduced to ambulance chasing to earn a living.  One particularly strong scene that shows the depths to which Frank has sank comes when he is forcibly removed from a funeral home by a grieving family after he tries to wrangle a case out of the death.  Frank is content to spend his time at a local bar getting drunk and shooting pinball until his pal Mickey (played wonderfully by Jack Warden) gives him a surefire winning civil case.  The lawsuit involves a comatose woman who was misdiagnosed in a Catholic hospital.  The Church wants to avoid an embarrassing trial and offers a healthy settlement.  But Frank sees a chance to win big bucks and rejects the settlement to go to trial against a big law firm lead by defense attorney Frank Concannon (played with an icy swarm by James Mason).  In the interim, Frank becomes involved with Laura Fischer (Charlotte Rampling) who is actually working for Concannon's firm trying to dig up information on Frank's strategy.  Another effective scene is where Frank finds out about Laura's deception and smacks across the face in a hotel bar.  Laura has fallen for Frank and understands and accepts the blow.  The film's main plot is the legal battle between the big and powerful Church and hospital and the helpless little guy, but the real crux of the film is Frank's struggles for redemption.  Mr. Newman's performance may well be the best of his career.  You root for Frank not just to win the case, but the overcome the demons he has been struggling with for so long.  Mr. Newman's performance is deeply nuanced and he shows his brilliance throughout.  The film was nominated for 1982 Best Picture, Director & Actor, but was swept away by the Gandhi tide of that year.",5,The Verdict Is In,1034726400,"10 16, 2002",2002,1853,"['Director', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'Verdict', '1982', 'stars', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Frank', 'Galvin', 'Frank', 'washed-up', 'alcoholic', 'Boston', 'lawyer', 'who', 'been', 'reduced', 'ambulance', 'chasing', 'earn', 'living', 'One', 'particularly', 'strong', 'scene', 'depths', 'Frank', 'sank', 'when', 'forcibly', 'removed', 'funeral', 'home', 'grieving', 'family', 'wrangle', 'case', 'death', 'Frank', 'content', 'spend', 'time', 'local', 'bar', 'getting', 'drunk', 'shooting', 'pinball', 'pal', 'Mickey', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'surefire', 'winning', 'civil', 'case', 'lawsuit', 'comatose', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'misdiagnosed', 'Catholic', 'hospital', 'Church', 'avoid', 'embarrassing', 'trial', 'healthy', 'settlement', 'Frank', 'chance', 'win', 'big', 'bucks', 'settlement', 'go', 'trial', 'big', 'law', 'firm', 'lead', 'defense', 'attorney', 'Frank', 'Concannon', 'played', 'icy', 'swarm', 'James', 'Mason', 'interim', 'Frank', 'involved', 'Laura', 'Fischer', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'who', 'actually', 'working', 'Concannon', 'firm', 'trying', 'dig', 'up', 'information', 'Frank', 'strategy', 'effective', 'scene', 'where', 'Frank', 'out', 'Laura', 'deception', 'smacks', 'face', 'hotel', 'bar', 'Laura', 'fallen', 'Frank', 'understands', 'blow', 'film', 'main', 'plot', 'legal', 'battle', 'big', 'powerful', 'Church', 'hospital', 'helpless', 'little', 'guy', 'real', 'crux', 'film', 'Frank', 'struggles', 'redemption', 'Mr.', 'Newman', 'performance', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'best', 'career', 'root', 'Frank', 'not', 'just', 'win', 'case', 'overcome', 'demons', 'been', 'struggling', 'so', 'long', 'Mr.', 'Newman', 'performance', 'deeply', 'nuanced', 'brilliance', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', '1982', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Director', 'Actor', 'was', 'swept', 'away', 'Gandhi', 'tide', 'year']",N/A

""The Verdict"" stars Paul Newman in one of his best roles.  It was a tough year for Best Actor Oscar in 1982 but it's still a shame he didn't win it then.  He plays a ambulance-chasing attorney who spends too much time drinking his lunch and too little researching his limited work.  A friend of his with some connections steers a fairly routine lawsuit his way but even that case he manages to mess up.  Having tossed away a large out-of-court settlement, he now has to make his case against a well-staffed powerful opponent.  That's probably more of the plot than needs to be revealed so I'll leave it at that.Like most excellent movies, ""The Verdict"" combines excellent writing directing and acting.  The supporting cast includes great preformances by James Mason and Jack Warden.  There are twists and turns as the movie evolves into a great courtroom drama.Newman is outstanding in his portrayal of a man who suddenly realizes that he is about to blow his last chance at making something of his life.

257885,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,6301599896,Roger J. Buffington,"[4, 4]","""The Verdict"" is one of the all-time great courtroom films.  The basic storyline involves Paul Newman as a broken-down ambulance-chasing plaintiff's attorney who nonetheless has gotten hold of an excellent medical malpractice case.  The Newman character had a streak of very bad luck earlier in his career, and is now an alcoholic wreck, neglecting his law practice as he descends into failure.One of the interesting things about this film is that unlike most legal flicks, this one involves a civil suit rather than a criminal case.  And it handles it, for the most part, very well.  In the story Newman totally botches the case in most respects.  I did think that the movie's handling of the issues Newman had with the Judge was somewhat unrealistic (no lawyer would speak to a Judge that way).  Setting these nits aside, this is nonetheless a fine film and an engaging storyline.  I would like to list some of the technical inaccuracies about the trial and litigation process as this film presents them, but I will not for fear of introducing spoilers.Newman fully explores his range as an actor, a great actor, in this film.  In most of his films he plays an assertive, aggressive type.  Here, he is hesitant, lacking in confidence--in fact he is a failing wreck who has been defeated by life and past villains.  He pulls it off brilliantly, and his characterization is highly believable.  This is an Oscar-caliber performance, although Newman was edged out in 1982 when the film hit the theaters.James Mason pulls a bravo performance as the ""Prince of Darkness"" defense counsel.

257888,A3VNYMNK7OC7CM,6301599896,R. Sardrena,"[0, 0]","Boston attorney Frank Galvin (Paul Newman) has hit rock bottom; a once-promising career and marriage are long gone.  Unable to cope with these blows, he spends decades slowly killing himself with alcohol.  But late in middle age, with his ruin seemingly complete, Galvin encounters one last case which could redeem him.Most of us love films dealing with the theme of redemption, and none accomplish it quite as deftly as The Verdict.  A quick glance at the box might make one think that this is a tiresome stew of alcoholism mixed with courtroom drama.  Indeed, the late Roger Ebert missed the point entirely about this film, lumping The Verdict into a pile of ""alcoholism films"" like The Days of Wine and Roses.  It's not; alcoholism is merely the protagonist's chosen form of suicide.  The film's true themes deal with how one lives on after the ideals of one's youth die.  When a decisive moment comes in young adulthood and one fails, how does one face the burden of disillusionment that follows?  Frank Galvin can't, and his hard climb back to self-respect is utterly engrossing.Paul Newman is well-known for so many roles, but his performance as Galvin is his most nuanced.  He is more willing to show vulnerability here than in other roles - partly due to David Mamet's hard-hitting script.  His Galvin has to slog deep through humiliation before a measure of grace is possible.  His use of his voice alone in this performance is revealing: gin-soaked and halting at times, puffed up by false bravado at others, we see the character here, not the artifice.The rest of the cast is equally powerful.  James Mason is excellent as Concannon, the cool, ruthlessly efficient defense attorney.  Charlotte Rampling is perfect as Newman's love interest; another flinty lost soul seeking grace.  Milo O'Shea seems to have been created for the role of the corrupt Boston judge.  Only Jack Warden as Newman's mentor and friend strikes a discordant note.

A fundamental complication which, more likely than not, led to the reported reluctance of other main actor possibilities in lieu of Paul Newman, to accept the role of Frank Galvin.At its black heart, the movie is about mean people being relentlessly mean to one another, and to hell with the consequences to the charity that they seek to bilk under the institutionalised legitimacy of the law, and to which the unintended victims of an unadmitted to accident, had sole recourse, as an alternative, to the private resources they could not, or did not not want to afford. To mitigate this, The A-Team of Sidney Lumet, David Brown, Richard D. Zanuck and David Mamet work like a super-charged switch train, in order to pluck the lowest of the low hanging fruit, more likely to pander to this movie's audience's socio-populist sensibilities.From a cinematic aspect, this is an impressive movie. The mise-en-sc&egrave;ne and mise-en-shot are certainly of a calibre that is well beyond that of the metteur-en-sc&egrave;ne that would have been a sufficient fit for this movie. The use of long-shot was very nicely done, and entirely plausible as a visual metaphor for the long shot, faced by Frank Galvin.The criticism above, is not exclusive to this movie, and could be similarly levelled at the likes of Oliver Stone's Wall Street and/or Michael Caton-Jones' et al's Doc Hollywood, for example.

257903,AH64XXZBL1T6Z,6301599896,Yaakov (James) Mosher,"[6, 6]","Surely one of the top 10 ""boozer"" movies of all time. Paul Newman plays the lush/lawyer. Jack Warden is Newman's law school teacher and collaborator in their Woodward and Bernstein-style assault against the medical establishment. James Mason plays an Irish-American attorney, leading the green-shoe law firm (replacing the white-shoe Yankee version) that defends the Archdiocese of Boston and the doctors who botched a woman's surgery.It's eerie to watch a 1982 movie dealing with a lawsuit against the Archdiocese of Boston knowing that the Roman Church was covering for pedophile priests during the period the movie was set. This 2007 viewer was half-expecting Newman and Warden to come across the pedophilia.I was amused at not hearing much in the way of Boston accents from most of the movie's actors. Perhaps an oversight. Perhaps accents disappear at high levels of the legal and medical professions.""The Verdict"" is a great primer on how to deal with betrayal and loss of idealism. Newman, in a riveting performance, follows the dictum of the great philospher/economist Ludwig von Mises -- ""Don't give it to the evil but proceed ever stronger against it."" Neocons reading this should not take this sentiment as an endorsement for attacking any country or person that talks bad about America and Israel.",5,"Boston legal thriller, minus the accents.",1186790400,"08 11, 2007",2007,1309,"['Surely', 'one', 'top', '10', 'boozer', 'movies', 'time', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'lush/lawyer', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'Newman', 'law', 'school', 'teacher', 'collaborator', 'Woodward', 'Bernstein-style', 'assault', 'medical', 'establishment', 'James', 'Mason', 'Irish-American', 'attorney', 'leading', 'green-shoe', 'law', 'firm', 'replacing', 'white-shoe', 'Yankee', 'version', 'Archdiocese', 'Boston', 'doctors', 'who', 'botched', 'woman', 'surgery.It', 'eerie', 'watch', '1982', 'movie', 'dealing', 'lawsuit', 'Archdiocese', 'Boston', 'knowing', 'Roman', 'Church', 'was', 'covering', 'pedophile', 'priests', 'period', 'movie', 'was', 'set', '2007', 'viewer', 'was', 'half-expecting', 'Newman', 'Warden', 'come', 'pedophilia.I', 'was', 'amused', 'not', 'hearing', 'much', 'way', 'Boston', 'accents', 'most', 'movie', 'actors', 'Perhaps', 'oversight', 'Perhaps', 'accents', 'disappear', 'high', 'levels', 'legal', 'medical', 'professions', 'Verdict', 'great', 'primer', 'how', 'deal', 'betrayal', 'loss', 'idealism', 'Newman', 'riveting', 'performance', 'dictum', 'great', 'philospher/economist', 'Ludwig', 'von', 'Mises', 'Do', ""n't"", 'give', 'evil', 'proceed', 'ever', 'stronger', 'Neocons', 'reading', 'should', 'not', 'take', 'sentiment', 'endorsement', 'attacking', 'country', 'person', 'bad', 'America', 'Israel']",N/A
