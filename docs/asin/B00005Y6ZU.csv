He has so much information in his head and I wish he had fleshed out his myriad of diatribes.  He often veers off telling a great side story and then stops himself to stay on point.  It's a big tease as I would like to hear the rest of the story! (most likely he was pressed for time as this was a live lecture) I hope he puts together a more in depth dvd series such as a set of 12 or 24 (hehe) but in the mean time this set is definitely worth owning.",4,A bit rushed but great information.,1125705600,"09 3, 2005",2005,576,"['Robert', 'Thurman', 'passionate', 'tibet', 'buddhism', 'easy', 'listen', 'articulate', 'intelligent', 'so', 'much', 'information', 'head', 'wish', 'had', 'fleshed', 'out', 'myriad', 'diatribes', 'often', 'off', 'telling', 'great', 'side', 'story', 'then', 'stay', 'point', 'big', 'tease', 'would', 'like', 'hear', 'rest', 'story', 'most', 'likely', 'was', 'pressed', 'time', 'was', 'live', 'lecture', 'hope', 'together', 'more', 'depth', 'dvd', 'series', 'such', 'set', '12', '24', 'hehe', 'mean', 'time', 'set', 'definitely', 'worth', 'owning']",N/A

To me, Robert Thurman is the finest teacher, either Eastern or Western, that I have ever come across. He loves his subject and he makes it exciting and real.Tibetan Buddhism is very complex. He does a lot to clarify many of the hardest concepts and brings even greater richness to an already rich tradition.",5,Wonderfully informative,1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,362,"['are', 'lectures', 'Tibet', 'House', 'New', 'York', 'Robert', 'Thurman', 'finest', 'teacher', 'Eastern', 'Western', 'have', 'ever', 'come', 'across', 'subject', 'exciting', 'real.Tibetan', 'Buddhism', 'very', 'complex', 'lot', 'clarify', 'many', 'hardest', 'concepts', 'brings', 'even', 'greater', 'richness', 'already', 'rich', 'tradition']",N/A

However, even though he knows his stuff and I personally find him extremely entertaining; you might find yourself alone in the TV room after the first twenty minutes.  If that does not bother you, then by all means.What you will see is a man (Robert Thurman) standing behind a lectern and talking (giving a lecture).  I find the man absolutely fascinating and for me he made the subjects of Buddhism and Tibet alive and vibrant.  But others might not feel the same way; if they are waiting to be entertained by other visuals or action.The DVD is a rich and wonderful compilation of a vast amount of knowledge on the subject matter; but it is not like watching a History Channel documentary or entertainment TV [so be forewarned].If you want to dive in deep and discover a wealth of knowledge about Tibet and Buddhism; then this DVD is for you.  I know of no other US based scholar who is more relevant to the Tibetan cause or is more of a leading expert on Tibetan Buddhism.  Robert Thurman is a personal friend of the Dalai Lama and has been for over 40 years.  He is the Jey Tsong Khapa Professor of Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Studies in the Department of Religion at Columbia University.  He has been ordained a Tibetan Buddhist monk.  His education background includes a B.A.. A.M., and PhD degrees from Harvard and he has also studied in Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in India and the United States.As a personal aside, his daughter from his second wife is Uma Thurman.I would highly recommend this collection for those who are sincerely (in a scholarly way) interested in finding out ""a great deal"" about Tibet and Buddhism.Bentley/2009",4,Everything on Tibet and Buddhism,1244592000,"06 10, 2009",2009,1697,"['Robert', 'Thurman', 'infectious', 'when', 'topics', 'However', 'even', 'stuff', 'personally', 'find', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'might', 'find', 'alone', 'TV', 'room', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'not', 'bother', 'then', 'means.What', 'will', 'see', 'man', 'Robert', 'Thurman', 'standing', 'lectern', 'talking', 'giving', 'lecture', 'find', 'man', 'absolutely', 'fascinating', 'made', 'subjects', 'Buddhism', 'Tibet', 'alive', 'vibrant', 'others', 'might', 'not', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'are', 'waiting', 'be', 'entertained', 'other', 'visuals', 'action.The', 'DVD', 'rich', 'wonderful', 'compilation', 'vast', 'amount', 'knowledge', 'subject', 'matter', 'not', 'like', 'watching', 'History', 'Channel', 'documentary', 'entertainment', 'TV', '[', 'so', 'be', 'forewarned', ']', '.If', 'want', 'dive', 'deep', 'discover', 'wealth', 'knowledge', 'Tibet', 'Buddhism', 'then', 'DVD', 'know', 'other', 'US', 'based', 'scholar', 'who', 'more', 'relevant', 'Tibetan', 'cause', 'more', 'leading', 'expert', 'Tibetan', 'Buddhism', 'Robert', 'Thurman', 'personal', 'friend', 'Dalai', 'Lama', 'been', '40', 'years', 'Jey', 'Tsong', 'Khapa', 'Professor', 'Indo-Tibetan', 'Buddhist', 'Studies', 'Department', 'Religion', 'Columbia', 'University', 'been', 'ordained', 'Tibetan', 'Buddhist', 'monk', 'education', 'background', 'B.A..', 'A.M.', 'PhD', 'degrees', 'Harvard', 'also', 'studied', 'Tibetan', 'Buddhist', 'monasteries', 'India', 'United', 'States.As', 'personal', 'aside', 'daughter', 'second', 'wife', 'Uma', 'Thurman.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'collection', 'who', 'are', 'sincerely', 'scholarly', 'way', 'interested', 'finding', 'out', 'great', 'deal', 'Tibet', 'Buddhism.Bentley/2009']",N/A

The DVD is great because you can listen to it many times. Each time you pick up more and more and finally you realize what an incredible journey he takes you through.  Robert is a wonderful lecturer, funny, happy, and has a lot to give.

I bought this to watch with a friend of mine, and she ended up wanting to watch all four hours on Tibet in a single afternoon!  We did just that, and didn't get bored once (although we did have to use the ""pause"" button to go to the bathroom!)Professor Thurman is a very knowledgeable man, and it is amazing to watch him rattle off a two-hour lecture while hardly ever referring to any notes.  I know my friend was somewhat disappointed that there weren't any pictures of Tibet in the lecture, and maybe Professor Thurman might consider doing a ""combo plate"" of pictures and lecture at some later date. All in all, excellent if you are interested in learning about Buddhism in general (obviously Professor Thurman's major interest is with Tibetan Buddhism), or about the history of Tibet.",5,Wonderful Lecture Series,1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,874,"['what', 'DVD', 'lecture', 'series', 'not', 'documentary', 'truly', 'great', 'buy', 'bought', 'watch', 'friend', 'mine', 'ended', 'up', 'wanting', 'watch', 'four', 'hours', 'Tibet', 'single', 'afternoon', 'did', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'once', 'did', 'have', 'use', 'pause', 'button', 'go', 'bathroom', 'Professor', 'Thurman', 'very', 'knowledgeable', 'man', 'amazing', 'watch', 'rattle', 'off', 'two-hour', 'lecture', 'hardly', 'ever', 'referring', 'notes', 'know', 'friend', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'were', ""n't"", 'pictures', 'Tibet', 'lecture', 'maybe', 'Professor', 'Thurman', 'might', 'consider', 'doing', 'combo', 'plate', 'pictures', 'lecture', 'later', 'date', 'excellent', 'are', 'interested', 'learning', 'Buddhism', 'general', 'obviously', 'Professor', 'Thurman', 'major', 'interest', 'Tibetan', 'Buddhism', 'history', 'Tibet']",N/A
