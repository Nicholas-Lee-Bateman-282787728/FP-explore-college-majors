1526821,AZVEPWRYOFBX5,B0076WKDQ6,Charity Bishop,"[0, 1]","Stories about villains are never as popular as those about heroes. Indeed, anyone writing such a story needs a credible cast in order to carry off the charm that will outweigh (at least for the audience) the deplorable behavior of any cad. Bel Ami is one such tale that would have felt more realistic with another leading man.I like Rob Pattinson, but here he is woefully out of his depth, possessing neither the chemistry with his costars nor the sex appeal needed to play a man like Georges. The script does him no favors and neither does the make up department, which means that through most of it, I was wondering what ever possessed the high society wives of Paris to fall for this utterly un-charming, sallow, sour-faced cad, who neither romances them nor really seduces them. Why do four of them fall into his arms? It defies all reason and is a shame, because the women are wonderful. He is just not their equal in terms of experience or charisma. This takes an otherwise gorgeous costume drama, full of beautiful clothes and exquisite period decor, down a notch and some of it can be blamed on a script that rushes so quickly onward that very little time is devoted to his relationship with any of these women.In some ways, the movie reminds me a bit of ""Dangerous Liasons"" but without the ultimate payback for this bad behavior. ""Bel Ami"" as the women are fond of calling him, gets away with whatever he likes, is absurdly jealous of his wife's indiscretions, seduces one woman merely to humiliate her husband, and in the end gets everything he wants through manipulation, seduction, and deceit. There really is no one to root for, since all of them are adulterous (except for the lovely Holliday Grainger, in a small but important part) and immoral, in more ways than one.Most costume dramas, I feel, benefit from hints rather than overt behavior.

1526831,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B0076WKDQ6,Douglas King,"[18, 25]","** 1/2""Bel Ami"" aspires to be a period drama that explores privileged people using marriage, romance, and sex in order to social climb, make money, or sometimes just inflict emotional damage on their enemies. Films like ""Dangerous Liaisons,"" ""The Age of Innocence"" and even the recent ""Cheri"" have all mined similar territory with, unfortunately, far superior results.Robert Pattison plays Georges, a soldier from a poor background who uses his looks and charm to burrow his way into Paris' aristocratic society via seducing and bedding powerful women. His first conquest is a wife of a wealthy businessman (Christina Ricci); his second, the wife of his boss at the newspaper he works, Madeleine (Uma Thurman, giving the film's best performance by far); his third, the wife of the newspaper's publisher (a wasted Kristen Scott Thomas, whom he beds not because he even finds her attractive, but as an act of pure revenge) and finally, the publisher's daughter (whom he marries out of pure strategy).""The most important people in Paris are not the men. It's the women,"" advises Madeleine. Madeleine quickly emerges as the smartest and shrewdest character in the film. Due to her gender, she's been forced to learn to influence and manipulate behind-the-scenes, however, she is also not above brutal honesty when appropriate. When her husband dies and Georges proposes marriage, she tells him ""I am not like other women. I will not tolerate authority, jealousy, or you questioning my behavior."" Georges marries her anyway, but she wears the pants in the relationship, and doesn't let him forget it for a moment. In fact, the more wealth and superficial success Georges attains, the more enraged the character becomes, as the various people around him seem to delight in constantly reminding him that he is, in essence, nothing more than a glorified gigolo.Georges, as a character, is supposed to be ruthless, charming, not terribly intelligent, and hopelessly out of his depth much of the time. Unfortunately, Robert Pattison as an actor is in the same boat. His performance isn't terrible, but when compared to charismatic and experienced actresses like Uma Thurman, Christina Ricci, and Kristen Scott Thomas, he comes across as an amateur. And since the film depends so much on his performance, and the film's script and direction are merely adequate, the film itself ends up mediocre.",3,Portrait of a Gigolo,1340150400,"06 20, 2012",2012,2384,"['1/2', 'Bel', 'Ami', 'be', 'period', 'drama', 'privileged', 'people', 'using', 'marriage', 'romance', 'sex', 'order', 'social', 'climb', 'make', 'money', 'sometimes', 'just', 'inflict', 'emotional', 'damage', 'enemies', 'Films', 'Dangerous', 'Liaisons', 'Age', 'Innocence', 'even', 'recent', 'Cheri', 'have', 'mined', 'similar', 'territory', 'unfortunately', 'far', 'superior', 'results.Robert', 'Pattison', 'plays', 'Georges', 'soldier', 'poor', 'background', 'who', 'looks', 'charm', 'burrow', 'way', 'Paris', 'aristocratic', 'society', 'seducing', 'bedding', 'powerful', 'women', 'first', 'conquest', 'wife', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'second', 'wife', 'boss', 'newspaper', 'Madeleine', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'giving', 'film', 'best', 'performance', 'far', 'third', 'wife', 'newspaper', 'publisher', 'wasted', 'Kristen', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'whom', 'not', 'even', 'attractive', 'act', 'pure', 'revenge', 'finally', 'publisher', 'daughter', 'whom', 'pure', 'strategy', 'most', 'important', 'people', 'Paris', 'are', 'not', 'men', 'women', 'Madeleine', 'Madeleine', 'quickly', 'smartest', 'shrewdest', 'character', 'film', 'Due', 'gender', 'been', 'forced', 'learn', 'influence', 'manipulate', 'behind-the-scenes', 'however', 'also', 'not', 'brutal', 'honesty', 'when', 'appropriate', 'When', 'husband', 'dies', 'Georges', 'marriage', 'am', 'not', 'other', 'women', 'will', 'not', 'tolerate', 'authority', 'jealousy', 'questioning', 'behavior', 'marries', 'anyway', 'pants', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'let', 'forget', 'moment', 'fact', 'more', 'wealth', 'superficial', 'success', 'Georges', 'more', 'enraged', 'character', 'various', 'people', 'seem', 'delight', 'constantly', 'reminding', 'essence', 'nothing', 'more', 'glorified', 'gigolo.Georges', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'ruthless', 'charming', 'not', 'terribly', 'intelligent', 'hopelessly', 'depth', 'much', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'Robert', 'Pattison', 'actor', 'same', 'boat', 'performance', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'when', 'compared', 'charismatic', 'experienced', 'actresses', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'Kristen', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'across', 'amateur', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'performance', 'film', 'script', 'direction', 'are', 'merely', 'adequate', 'film', 'up', 'mediocre']",N/A

In many ways that quote summarizes the plot of this story.BEL AMI  is set in Paris in the upper-middle class environment of the leading journalists of the newspaper La Vie Franaise and their friends. It tells the story of Georges Duroy (Robert Pattinson), who has spent three years of military service in Algeria. After six months working as a clerk in Paris, an encounter with his former comrade, Forestier (Philip Glenister), enables him to start a career as a journalist. From a reporter of minor events and soft news, he gradually climbs his way up to chief editor. Duroy initially owes his success to Forestier's wife (Uma Thurman) who helps him write his first articles and, when he later starts writing lead articles, she adds an edge and poignancy to them. At the same time, she uses her connections among leading politicians to provide him with behind the scenes information which allows him to become actively involved in politics. Duroy is also introduced to many politicians in Madame Forestier's drawing-room. Duroy becomes the lover of Forestiers' friend Clotilde Marelle (Christina Ricci), another influential woman. Duroy later tries to seduce Madeleine Forestier to get even with her husband, but she repulses Duroy's sexual advances and offers that they become true friends without ulterior motives instead. In a few months, Charles Forestier's health deteriorates and he travels to Cannes to regain it. Soon afterwards, Duroy receives a letter from Madeleine imploring him to come to join her and help her bear the last moments of her husband's life. As Forestier dies, Duroy asks Madeleine to marry him. After a few weeks to consider, she agrees. Georges now signs his articles Du Roy (an aristocratic style of French name) in order to add prestige to his name. The married couple travel to Normandy, the region of Georges's childhood, and meet his peasant parents. Finding the reality different than her romantic expectations, Madeleine feels very uncomfortable with his parents and so their stay with them is short. In the newspaper office, Duroy is ridiculed for having his articles written by his wife, just as the late Forestier had his articles written by her. His newspaper colleagues call him `Forestier', which drives Georges mad and he suddenly becomes heavily jealous of Madeleine, insisting that she admit having been unfaithful to Forestier, but she never does.In order to suppress the stings of jealousy, Duroy starts an affair with Mme Virginie Walter (Kristin Scott Thomas), the wife of the owner of the newspaper. He especially enjoys the conquest as he is her first extramarital lover. Later on, however, he regrets the decision, for he cannot get rid of her when he does not want her. Duroy's relations with his wife become chillier, and at one point he takes a police superintendent to a flat in which his wife is meeting a minister. They catch the two in the act of adultery, which was then a crime punishable under the law.Duroy's ascent to power continues. Duroy, now a single man, makes use of his chief Rousset (Colm Meaney) daughter's (Holliday Grainger) infatuation with him, and arranges an elopement with her. The parents then have no other choice but to grant their assent to the marriage. The last chapter shows Duroy savouring his success at the wedding ceremony at which 'all those who figured prominently in society' were present. His thoughts, however, chiefly belong to Mme de Marelle who, when wishing him all the best, indicates that she has forgiven him for his new marriage and that their intimate meetings can be taken up again.Directors Declan Donnellan and Nick Ormerod are novices and the pacing of the film could use some polish. The sets and costumes are the stars and the musical score by both Rachel Portman and Lakshmam Joseph De Saram and cinematography by Stefano Falivene mange to creat the atmosphere of La Belle Epoque well.  The cast is strong, though the title role of Georges Duroy (aka Bel Ami) feels undercast: Robert Pattinson lacks the depth of subtlety in his current acting skill to be convincing as the poor cad of this rags to riches via abuse of women role.  It will be interesting to see if this film will last once it is released in theaters.

Pattinson looks the part as an impoverished son of a farmer who elevates his social status by seducing powerful women or wives of powerful men.  Unfortunately he doesn't have the acting chops to pull off such a centrist role.  Directors Decian Donnellan and Nick Ormerod don't help as seemingly half the movie focuses on Pattinson various facial expressions.  Most of the time it is that blank look he perfected in the ""Twilight"" movies but without the glitter.The supporting cast is first rate.  Christini Ricci is the young wife of a powerful businessman who is rarely at home.  She falls for Georges (Pattinson) but her marriage precludes much beyond regular dalliances she arranges in a rented apartment.  Her young daughter, upon meeting Georges, calls him bel ami (beautiful friend).  Kristin Scott Thomas is the wife of a political leader and newspaper publisher (Colm Meaney).  She eventually succumbs to Georges.  Uma Thurman is Madeleine a behind-the-scenes political writer for her husband, and Georges boss, at the newspaper.  Yep, eventually he even marries her.We see all of this coming of course, along with the responses from the various ladies in Georges' life.

In Bel Ami, he is actually given very good material, based on Guy de Maupassant's 1895 novel, but he is merely only the weakest link in speciously poorly made movie.Pattinson plays Georges Duroy, a literary rogue, a skillfully charming social climber, or as de Maupassant himself subtitled his book, ""the history of a scoundrel."" Here he is transformed by Pattinson into a thoroughly unlikable reprobate, who's unreasonably smug and arrogant, a womanizer and a manipulator, it would be a stretch to call this guy an anti-hero. Pattinson lacks the necessary charisma to pull off such a role, think of Johnny Depp in The Libertine a few years back, he seems ill-at ease here, as if he understands that the material is staggeringly out of his depth.A capable supporting cast comes across mostly badly for one reason or another. Uma Thurman is primed and proper, but has to wobble her way through some horrendous dialogue. Kristen Scott Thomas plays frigid better than any other actress I know, oddly enough, a British actress, she has been a lot more warm and human in some recent French language films. Here she has little to do, but does successfully manage to exert great empathy for her repressive and shrewish character, but she also manages to remain unmoving and their for dull.  Colm Meaney and Philip Glenister, two good actors, play the other men in Pattinson's vehicle, this may explain why they fail to get any dynamic scenes or many scenes for that matter away from the dull lead. Only Christina Ricci adds any spark in a spirited supporting turn, but her role is only one dimensional, she comes across more like someone's pet than as a fully developed human being.The proceedings unfold so monotonously, that at one point Pattinson utters the line ""this is so boring this endless to and fro."" You don't get any more surreal than when movie characters start uttering your own inner thoughts. Everything fails to liven the surroundings, the sex is passionless, the character's motivations either unpleasantly despicable or maidenly vague. No wonder Pattinson is famous for playing a vampire, he is perhaps the most bloodless actor I have seen in ages, these days he's outclassed by Daniel Radcliffe.Adapted by Rachel Bennette and directed by Declan Donnellan and Nick Ormerod, first time directors, who like most virgins know the basic moves, but lack the skills to be fully satisfying. Set in and around Paris at the end of the 19th century, the details look good, though pretentiously photographed by Stefano Falivene, it is filled with what one character calls ""astonishing depths of emptiness.""Pattinson has recently formed a partnership with legendary cult director David Cronenberg, they have a finished film title that I greatly anticipate titled Cosmopolis set for US release in August, after that they have another film in development. Maybe Cronenberg sees something in Pattinson that has been missing up until now on screen, but will fans ever warm to the actor outside of his popular franchise, I don't have the answer, but one thing that is for sure, it wont start with Bel Ami, a beggar's version  of Dangerously Liaisons.Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",1,how could one movie be so boring?,1345420800,"08 20, 2012",2012,3621,"['Twihards', 'critics', 'are', 'unreasonably', 'harsh', 'virtues', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'notice', 'do', ""n't"", 'rally', 'enough', 'enthusiasm', 'actually', 'see', 'non-Twilight', 'flicks', 'such', 'suspect', 'realize', 'youthful', 'infatuation', 'not', 'out', 'way', 'fact', 'such', 'Remember', 'Me', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'possibly', 'also', 'understand', 'Pattinson', 'better', 'material', 'Bel', 'Ami', 'actually', 'given', 'very', 'good', 'material', 'based', 'Guy', 'de', 'Maupassant', '1895', 'novel', 'merely', 'only', 'weakest', 'link', 'speciously', 'poorly', 'made', 'movie.Pattinson', 'plays', 'Georges', 'Duroy', 'literary', 'rogue', 'skillfully', 'charming', 'social', 'climber', 'de', 'Maupassant', 'subtitled', 'book', 'history', 'scoundrel', 'Here', 'transformed', 'Pattinson', 'thoroughly', 'unlikable', 'reprobate', 'who', 'unreasonably', 'smug', 'arrogant', 'womanizer', 'manipulator', 'would', 'be', 'stretch', 'call', 'guy', 'anti-hero', 'Pattinson', 'necessary', 'charisma', 'pull', 'off', 'such', 'role', 'think', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Libertine', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'ill-at', 'ease', 'here', 'material', 'staggeringly', 'depth.A', 'capable', 'supporting', 'cast', 'across', 'mostly', 'badly', 'one', 'reason', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'primed', 'proper', 'wobble', 'way', 'horrendous', 'dialogue', 'Kristen', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'frigid', 'better', 'other', 'actress', 'know', 'oddly', 'enough', 'British', 'actress', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'warm', 'human', 'recent', 'French', 'language', 'films', 'Here', 'little', 'do', 'successfully', 'manage', 'exert', 'great', 'empathy', 'repressive', 'shrewish', 'character', 'also', 'remain', 'unmoving', 'dull', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'Philip', 'Glenister', 'two', 'good', 'actors', 'play', 'other', 'men', 'Pattinson', 'vehicle', 'may', 'explain', 'why', 'fail', 'get', 'dynamic', 'scenes', 'many', 'scenes', 'matter', 'away', 'dull', 'lead', 'Only', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'spark', 'spirited', 'supporting', 'turn', 'role', 'only', 'one', 'dimensional', 'more', 'someone', 'pet', 'fully', 'developed', 'human', 'being.The', 'proceedings', 'unfold', 'so', 'monotonously', 'one', 'point', 'Pattinson', 'line', 'so', 'boring', 'endless', 'fro', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'surreal', 'when', 'movie', 'characters', 'start', 'uttering', 'own', 'inner', 'thoughts', 'Everything', 'fails', 'liven', 'surroundings', 'sex', 'passionless', 'character', 'motivations', 'unpleasantly', 'despicable', 'maidenly', 'vague', 'wonder', 'Pattinson', 'famous', 'playing', 'vampire', 'perhaps', 'most', 'bloodless', 'actor', 'have', 'seen', 'ages', 'days', 'outclassed', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe.Adapted', 'Rachel', 'Bennette', 'directed', 'Declan', 'Donnellan', 'Nick', 'Ormerod', 'first', 'time', 'directors', 'who', 'most', 'virgins', 'know', 'basic', 'moves', 'lack', 'skills', 'be', 'fully', 'satisfying', 'Set', 'Paris', 'end', '19th', 'century', 'details', 'look', 'good', 'though', 'pretentiously', 'photographed', 'Stefano', 'Falivene', 'filled', 'what', 'one', 'character', 'astonishing', 'depths', 'emptiness', 'Pattinson', 'recently', 'formed', 'partnership', 'legendary', 'cult', 'director', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'have', 'finished', 'film', 'title', 'greatly', 'anticipate', 'titled', 'Cosmopolis', 'set', 'US', 'release', 'August', 'have', 'film', 'development', 'Maybe', 'Cronenberg', 'something', 'Pattinson', 'been', 'missing', 'up', 'now', 'screen', 'will', 'fans', 'ever', 'warm', 'actor', 'popular', 'franchise', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'answer', 'one', 'thing', 'sure', 'wont', 'start', 'Bel', 'Ami', 'beggar', 'version', 'Dangerously', 'Liaisons.Check', 'reviews', 'moviezonemagazine.com']",N/A

First, Pattinson just isn't up to the part. His character is supposed to be a suave, seductive, irresistible social climber, but Pattinson is none of those things. Emotion never reaches his dead eyes. He's flat and unsophisticated. While these ladies might want to roll in the hay with him behind closed doors, he's not someone you'd want to be caught talking to in public much less marrying. While you do get a sense that he doesn't like being poor, he doesn't come across as someone with much ambition of any kind.Second, midway through the movie it starts to develop this cat and mouse Dangerous Liaisons quality to it where the viewer starts to wonder who is the manipulator and who is the pawn? The women, the men, or Duroy/Pattinson? Unfortunately, that is short-lived. Despite the fact that Duroy is horribly inexperienced sop, he magically manages to come up with a few tricks that sets society spinning.

That's what I was thinking before watching ""Bel Ami,"" a 2012 film starring Robert Pattinson as Georges Duroy, a social climber in the 19gh century France rising to power by seducing wealthy women. But I like Christina Ricci, so anyway I gave it a try. She was very good (when she wasn't?), but the film itself, beautifully shot as it is, still doesn't answer the question: Why ""Bel Ami""?Robert Pattinson plays Georges Duroy, a man of modest means and limited talent, who first succeeds as a columnist, with a help from his old friend Charles Forestier (Philip Glenister) and Charles's wife Madeleine (Uma Thurman). Then he meets two of her friends, fun-loving Clotilde de Marelle (Christina Ricci) and Madame Rousset (Kristin Scott Thomas).All these Paris women, beautiful and elegant, seem to find Georges very attractive, sexually or otherwise. This is where the film falters. Robert Pattinson does his best, but with his character too flat and story too thin, he is not very convincing as a devilish charmer. To make matters worse, the story often feels rushed, jumping from one episode to another, and leaving little space for characters to develop.Directors Declan Donnellan and Nick Ormerod gathered an impressive cast, and ""Bel Ami"" has some excellent costume design. Still, we are not allowed to be well acquainted with the characters, and as a social satire the film is weak.

That must be one heck of a fabulous film! But no, it really isn't.  I saw this before it was ever released in theaters during a sneak preview channel I have. I was excited to see it for a couple of reasons. 1: I love any film with a corset, and 2: The all-star cast. So first thing's first-the scenery, imagery and costumes are beautiful. Very authentic looking. However, the actual film is quite a snooze-fest. There is no life in it, no spark. Like a bland meal, it leaves you wanting something better. It's a pity really because it's brimming with stars, but they just wander aimlessly throughout the film.Rob Pattison gives a respectable performance as a young man who arrives penniless in Paris, and quite quickly, through a string of luck and good fortune weaves his way upwards through society. In fact, he has no qualms about seducing anyone he feels he needs to, to get ahead. That includes Uma Thurman, Christina Ricci, and the almost-always flawless Kristen Scott Thomas. Aside from the poor accents, these actresses all look fantastic here, but lack personality. It's quite puzzling and I can only attribute the lack of interest to the dry-as-toast script, and barely-there plot. Rob Pattison doesn't have much to do here besides smolder, and flatter-which he does quite admirably, but his character's charm quickly wears off and he becomes just another pretty face with not much else going for him. It was frustating because he CAN do better, given a better director and script.

1526886,A107ZX1O8JZCN5,B0076WKDQ6,"Vicki Hopkins, Author ""Vicki Hopkins, Author""","[9, 10]","The title of the review pretty much sums it up.  It's often difficult with movies like these to write reviews.  Unfortunately, I find myself separating it into separate pieces and averaging my rating between the acting versus the quality of the story.  I can easily give a five star thumbs up for the superb acting, setting, costumes, etc.  However, the story, makes me moan, frankly, and I cautiously hand over one star.  In the end, we're left with three.Let's face it, Duroy is not a character you really fall in love with. Oh, yes, he's attractive, sexy, dreamy-eyed, able to seduce women with a single sly grin, and is everything you want in bed from a tender lover to a rough aggressive bad boy.  You understand the following about the man, besides his inability to keep his manhood in check, that he grew up poor, isn't very bright, and isn't respected by other men.  You quickly learn as well that he doesn't possess much of a conscience or a heart, and uses the lives of others for his own gain.  I guess that's where the character type of ""scoundrel"" enters in Bel Ami.The one thing that struck me about the movie was the entire time you're watching it, you are really not privy to the inward thoughts of Duroy and his motivations.  You watch his dark brooding, drunken binges, his narrowing gaze, and outbursts of anger and make your own conclusion as to what makes him tick as a man.  Besides being a morally loose rake, with no conscience bedding three women at once, he comes across as a relatively ignorant and despised man in his social circle.Finally, at the end of the movie, you are suddenly given a glimpse into the deep musings and inward workings of his dark heart. It's here that he reveals it's not enough to be loved. He doesn't want to scrape through life, like his father in poverty while praying for a better life in the next world.  There is no next world.  We rot in the grave.  Better to grab it in the here and now rather than to hope for something that will never come.  Of course, as a scoundrel, that's the only way he knows how to gain what he wants in life.
