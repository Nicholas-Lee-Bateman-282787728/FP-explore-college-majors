How can you resist a rags-to-riches story involving characters who truly deserve it, and the magical, warm feeling you come away with after viewing it?  It's funny how the poorest character was Sam Field (played by Will and Grace's Eric McCormack) until an angel posing as a Mexican businessman (Hector Elizondo, who is great in everything he plays) brings him together with his plant employee, Kathleen (beautiful Roma Downey), and her little girl Zoey (Sorry, didn't catch her real name!).Kathleen is a poor, single working mother with a child to raise and a deadbeat, golf fanatical ex-husband who only cares for himself.  She needs a safer place to raise her daughter and her car is literally on its last wheels.  Sam is a wealthy businessman who understandably attracts lots of women, but he is bankrupt inside because of the emotional damage his father inflicted upon him as a kid.  When big family man Senor Del Campo insists on doing business with only like-minded clients, Sam hires Kathleen and Zoe to pose as his wife and daughter.  Moral conflicts arise, and Zoe is not only precocious, but is still longing for her real daddy.I enjoy watching the situations that unfold as Del Campo's heavenly magic heals the three of them and brings them together.  It is a wonderful, magical story I never get tired of viewing around the holidays, but I only have one complaint:  They should have let Roma Downey use her Irish accent, because it's such a pleasure to listen to!",5,An All-Time Holiday Favorite!,1320710400,"11 8, 2011",2011,1625,"['movie', 'was', 'enchanting', 'heartwarming', 'first', 'time', 'caught', 'initial', 'airing', 'TV', 'wait', 'appear', 'cable', 'year', 'How', 'can', 'resist', 'rags-to-riches', 'story', 'involving', 'characters', 'who', 'truly', 'deserve', 'magical', 'warm', 'feeling', 'come', 'away', 'viewing', 'funny', 'how', 'poorest', 'character', 'was', 'Sam', 'Field', 'played', 'Will', 'Grace', 'Eric', 'McCormack', 'angel', 'posing', 'Mexican', 'businessman', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'who', 'great', 'everything', 'together', 'plant', 'employee', 'Kathleen', 'beautiful', 'Roma', 'Downey', 'little', 'girl', 'Zoey', 'Sorry', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'real', 'name', '.Kathleen', 'poor', 'single', 'working', 'mother', 'child', 'raise', 'deadbeat', 'golf', 'fanatical', 'ex-husband', 'who', 'only', 'safer', 'place', 'raise', 'daughter', 'car', 'literally', 'last', 'wheels', 'Sam', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'who', 'understandably', 'lots', 'women', 'bankrupt', 'inside', 'emotional', 'damage', 'father', 'inflicted', 'upon', 'kid', 'When', 'big', 'family', 'man', 'Senor', 'Del', 'Campo', 'doing', 'business', 'only', 'like-minded', 'clients', 'Sam', 'Kathleen', 'Zoe', 'pose', 'wife', 'daughter', 'Moral', 'conflicts', 'arise', 'Zoe', 'not', 'only', 'precocious', 'still', 'longing', 'real', 'daddy.I', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'situations', 'unfold', 'Del', 'Campo', 'heavenly', 'magic', 'heals', 'three', 'brings', 'together', 'wonderful', 'magical', 'story', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'viewing', 'holidays', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'complaint', 'should', 'have', 'let', 'Roma', 'Downey', 'Irish', 'accent', 'such', 'pleasure', 'listen']",Borrowed Hearts

Downey is very good as Kathleen Russell, a feisty single mom who is determined to make a better life for herself and her young daughter Zoey (Sarah Rosen Fruitman). Kathleen's boss Sam (McCormack) is an ambitious, handsome, but rather cold-hearted businessman. In order to successfully complete a business merger with an enigmatic client named Del Campo (Hector Elizondo), Sam must produce an ""instant family"" over the Christmas holidays. Kathleen and Zoey fit the bill nicely. It doesn't hurt that Sam's huge mansion is an exact replica of the dollhouse Zoey has always wanted. But what Zoey really wants is for her dead-beat dad, Kathleen's ex-husband, to return. This time around, it is Elizondo, not Downey, who portrays an angel in disguise.The conclusion is completely  predictable from the moment the plot is set in motion.

Seems his business associate has played up to the man with whom they will be signing the merger, Mr. Del Campo. He is big on family and likes to do business with family men, so his associate has told him that Sam has a family. As scenes at the beginning of the movie indicate, Sam is anything but a family man, but now he needs to acquire a family ASAP.Of course, Kathleen and Zoey get the job as his family and proceed to turn his world upside down--all the while little Zoey is longing for her real Dad who left town six months ago without saying good-bye.My purpose here is just to clarify what has been edited in the Feature Films for Families version and what is still in this version. I'm not passing judgment on what is appropriate for you and your family--I'm just noting the differences.In this version, and not in the Feature Films version, in the opening scenes Sam is having a formal dinner with a girlfriend. They start out at opposite ends of the long table and end up together at one corner. Though they are ""just eating"" it is done in a very ""steamy"" manner--if you can imagine. The next thing you see is the following morning when Sam is obviously not fully dressed beneath his robe and the woman from the dinner scene is fully dressed and storming out of the house--implying that she had spent the night. In his factory that day he tells his associate about the situation and that the angry departure was because he learned she was a mother and he doesn't date women with children. His associate replies that if he didn't do the crime he doesn't do the time (implying that if he is not the father he needn't be punished by being saddled with the child) and jokes with him about how he goes through so many women. While Kathleen is working that morning she makes a comment to a coworker that includes a reference to testosterone. The first ""hired wife"" (who doesn't get the job) tells Sam that if he wants to sleep with her it will cost him an extra $100. In a conversation between Sam and Kathleen he asks if she doesn't think of him when she is in his bed (in their pseudo-marriage she sleeps in his bed and he sleeps on a cot in the dressing room/closet).  He then says, ""Tell me you're not tossing and turning and wondering."" She admits that she is. There are also a couple of incidents each of swearing and profanity. That summarizes what I could detect, having watched both versions recently. In the edited version I only noticed one time where it was obvious that something had been cut.I like the movie. Corny?--at times, but overall an enjoyable, fluffy holiday romance that tries to squeeze in a message about the importance of family.",4,What was edited?

Throughout the deception, you learn the human side about the people involved.Hector Elizondo is excellent as the out-of-town businessman.  He is so smooth and classy.

She makes you want to grab her and hug her throughout the movie, especially in the heart-wrenching scene when her real father is about to hit the road again.  The local business man is great.

So I am taking a chance and ordering this movie in the belief it is ""Borrowed Hearts"" starring Roma Downey and Hector Elizondo. Pretty certain it is, but if wrong I can return it. Echo Bridge, Borders and Best Buy show a release date of June 1, 2010. Amazon shows May 25, 2010, but after I ordered the checkout form shows a date of June lst.

822897,A3BZSYJKZCRY03,B00023ELYG,Retro Pixie,"[1, 1]","Because of the multitude of reviews that stated they received edited versions, a review that said this is in black & white & a review that stated they were missing a Christmas music CD in their package, I thought I would address those things first.  The DVD I received is not edited; it's the entire movie in color with good quality.  Mine was purchased through Amazon, the photo on the front is with Roma Downey & Eric McCormack's heads together.  It was released through Echo Bridge Home Entertainment.  No, there isn't a Christmas music CD; and it's not advertised as having one with this particular release.  I can't speak for other versions out there, but this one is the real deal.This is a holiday romance from 1997 starring McCormack (Will & Grace) as Sam - a very wealthy man who owns a large company, Downey (Touched by an Angel) as Kathleen - a single mom working for Sam, and Hector Elizondo (Pretty Woman) as an angel.  Kathleen and her little girl agree to pose as Sam's family to impress a big client.  Kathleen needs the money to help raise her daughter, and Sam needs to prove he's not a commitment-phobe.  They have very strict rules about the agreement and sleep in separate bedrooms.  However, the client decides to become a house guest and the little girl has a ne'er-do-well father who isn't above blackmail, so it's going to be a Christmas miracle if they can all get through this unscathed.It has a lot going for it on the Christmas scale:  Sam's house is beautiful and looks gorgeous with Christmas decorations, there are lots of snowy scenes and even some ice skating.The unintentionally funny:  Eric McCormack's hair is exceptionally bad.  My mother refers to this movie as 'Borrowed Hair.'  And as if to match the bad hair, Roma Downey wears a ridiculous hat in the ice skating scene.  She's certainly lovely throughout the rest of the movie, but the hat makes me laugh every time.It's a sweet story about two very different people falling in love.  McCormack, Downey & Elizondo are all good, and Elizondo is charming as usual.  If I could change one thing about the movie, it would be that the little girl can be a bit mouthy and her mother indulges her instead of reprimanding her when she misbehaves.  I understand the mother is doing that because she thinks she's making up for the father, but the child's behavior can be irritating at times.  It's a minor irritation, because I do enjoy watching this every Christmas.
