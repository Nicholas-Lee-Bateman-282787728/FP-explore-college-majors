Martin Clunes is simply superb as the angry short tempered and eternally  frustrated GP in this small English coastal town filled with maddening and hilariously obstinate and quirky characters.  But then so is everybody in the cast here, including Caroline Catz who is the charming and attractive female lead.  The fictional village of Portwenn (beautiful St. Isaac in Cornwall)  is a real character in the ongoing drama with its winding streets, and views of the blue sea ---  and the unique  Ian McNeice is especially captivating as Bert Large, a lovable though fallible pillar of the community.  Stephanie Cole as Doc Martin's Aunty June is unforgettable  and so is Eileen Atkins as yet another loving and interesting aunt.  Claire Bloom does a great job now and then as Martin's ghastly mother.  But I love all the cast truly.  If you haven't tried this series, it's a pleasure to marathon it, let me assure you. There's something safe and comforting about it, though it is always surprising and entertaining.  And I so hope we will see a season 7.  We must have a season 7!!!!

That was how long we had to wait for Season 5 and now there has been a further two year wait for Season 6.  However, the good news is that, whereas for a while it did look like Season 5 was to be the last, Martin Clunes recently said that if Series 6 was well received then the show would continue.  I would imagine that the script writers would not have any problem writing new stories for the gentle folk of Port Wenn almost indefinitely so hopefully Doc Martin will be with us for some time to come.Doc Martin was formerly a successful surgeon in London before a phobia for blood drove him to his current position as GP in this sleepy Cornish village in the West of England.  With a deadpan face and no apparent people skills, he is not well equipped to deal with the eccentric inhabitants.  It is amazing how often a largely expressionless face speaks volumes!  One wonders how the long suffering Louise manages to put up with him, but clearly she does as this series opens with them preparing at last for their wedding.  However, as we might have expected, things on the day and subsequently run far from smoothly.As in the last series, child minding arrangements for Baby James are an ongoing issue.  This time the Doc falls out with the regular minder, and her temporary replacement does not prove to be entirely satisfactory.  Meanwhile, when he is drafted in to take the baby to a mother and toddlers group, he does not seem to blend in very well!  Neither does he endear himself with the unfortunate Louisa when he invites her school Chairman of Governors and wife around to dinner - it does not prove to be a perfect evening and this was one of the funnier episodes of the series.  However, often the action revolves around other characters such as Bert or PC Penhale and Doc Martin and family are in the background, although the series does finish on a note of high drama.You really cannot imagine anyone apart from Martin Clunes playing the part of Doc Martin and Port Wenn provides us with a gentle and charming show which we very much look forward to.

1672440,A1C70R9KCILEU,B00FPPQYXM,Elle,"[5, 7]","Doc Martin is back and he hasn't changed a bit.At the end of season five we saw Martin profess his love for Louisa.  I was looking forward to seeing season six with the hope that Martin had improved in sharing his life and feelings with Louisa.  I wasn't expecting miracles, just a gentle crack in his unfeeling faade, some kind of indication of Martin making an effort to reveal and share his feelings with Louisa.  The audience is shown glimpses of his love for her but he still withholds them from Louisa.Episode one begins with Louisa's and Martin's wedding.  I was trying to figure out how much time was to have passed between the end of season five and the wedding.  The best I could come up with was six, possibly seven months? At one point, Louisa comments that James Henry, their son, is nine months old and I think he was eight weeks old when they finally named him at the end of season five.  The reason for my doing this was to help me understand how their relationship had progressed to the decision to marry.  I hoped that they had had enough time to work out their ""problems"" with Louisa being sure she could live with the Doc.  Their ""relationship"" had already ended disastrously twice.  Surely, Louisa knew what she was getting into?  Unfortunately, it became immediately clear on their honeymoon that Martin is the same ol' Martin.Because of this, I spent the entire time I watched feeling sad and frustrated that it was more of the same old thing.  I guess I had gotten my hopes up for a sign of warming in Martin.  I understand how his overall demeanor could not be completely altered because that would take away from the premise of the show's original concept. Maybe, I had just forgotten how impossibly rude and well, mean, Martin was to everyone.  I kept wondering why in the world Louisa married him. It wasn't funny anymore.  The overall humor of the program had begun to wear thin for me in season five.This installment brought more insight into the reasons for Martin being so detached and cold.  We meet his mother and his incredibly troubled childhood is elucidated even more.  Neither of his parents showed any interest in him at all.  Guess what?  They were cold and detached.  Sad.  The only light he had in his life was his Aunt Joan.  When his attachment to Joan was noticed by his father, (Joan's brother) he parted them. His father was a cruel man. I understand the emotional damage that Martin suffered and as a result how he closed himself off to feel nothing.  In doing this he insulated himself from hurt but sadly, this protective barrier also kept him from opening himself up to meaningful relationships. However, he has an obviously brilliant mind and cannot be ignorant about how his behavior toward and treatment of others resembles that of his parents toward him.  Surely he understands that if it was wrong for his parents to treat him thus then it is equally wrong for him to imitate them?  I don't mean to sound harsh but I just thought that the writer's had brought him to these conclusions at the end of season five?  It's time they write some progress into his condition.The saving grace, for me, of this program is Portwenn and its citizens. The views! Oh, I want to go there!  What an absolutely gorgeous setting. Also, thank goodness for the quirky characters that are plentiful, which populate the small fishing community.  They are always good to Doc Martin even in the face of what I consider his cold and churlish behavior.  Anywhere else he might have been run out on a rail.Returning is Bert and Al Large. For me, Al really shone. I'm delighted that his character took such a front row seat.  Aunt Ruth Ellingham returns and is absolutely marvelous, she seems to be able to reach Martin when no one else, including Louisa, can.  Mrs. Tishell returns from the mental institution where she was treated for her delusions, which led to her kidnapping James Henry.  Is she cured of her obsession with Martin?  Morwenna, the new receptionist, while she's not Pauline, she has her own kind of moxy.  I liked her.  She is given a possible love interest. The ever nice and somewhat daft PC Joe Penhale continues to reach out to Martin in friendship and continues to be rejected.  A wonderful addition is another love interest, for Bert! A particularly interesting thread in the episodes is a child-minder afflicted with OCD. He fits Martin's sensibilities of order but as you can imagine drives Louisa crazy.The last two seasons my love for this series began to wane.  Martin made me so sad. His rudeness got on my nerves.  At the end of season five my hope was renewed that the story line would include some progress and improvement in Martin's desire and ability to relate to others. He could still be impatient but with a crack or two in his armor?  A sign of some softening?  Yet, once more we see Martin coldly shutting Louisa out and by the final episode is saying, to Ruth (not Louisa) that he wants to change.  The cliffhanger is...will he?I give this season four stars.  The supporting cast saved it for me.",4,Sadly It's The Same Old Martin...,1387065600,"12 15, 2013",2013,5069,"['Doc', 'Martin', 'back', ""n't"", 'changed', 'bit.At', 'end', 'season', 'five', 'saw',

The writing is excellent, providing every episode with a collection of plot threads that incorporate the entire populace of fun-loving ocean-side villagers. You'll laugh at everyone from street girls to the related pair of Doctors.Doc Martin's romance with Louise who runs the local school has always been tense, funny, and part of the ongoing main plot. Martin Clunes and Caroline Catz lead every great episode, but numerous side situations keep the story fast-pace and emotion scrambled. The perfect cast for this oddball mix of villagers is the driving force behind why this is a modern classic series. They even throw in guest stars. I own every series, and will always get the next.SDH SUBTITLES for all 8 episodes.1 Sickness and Health -Now Dr. & Mrs. Louisa Martin wed hilariously, as the case with everything in Portwenn. Isolated posh Cornwall honeymoon bliss turns chaos. Child sitter Aunt Ruth (Eileen Atkins) is grateful to the ex-army Pruddy (Felix Scott) who can fix electric and baby ills.2 Guess Who's Coming to Dinner -Work-hour nanny filled by an odd choice. The Doc's invited guest idea backfires when they overhear offensive conversation via the baby-com. Sexy receptionist Morwenna (Jessica Ranson, may she never leave Portwenn) is more prominent this season and takes in a male border.3 The Tameness of a Wolf  -More weird sitter problems. Al (Joe Absolom) questions his flat mate choice while Dr. Ruth gets stalked. There is a new pharmacist (Annabelle Apsion). Every local touches Doc Martin's life.4 Nobody Likes Me -Dr. Ruth moves into town and her neighbor proves others can be just as grumpy and offensive as Doc, her nephew. Doc outdoes his sociability lack with the mothers at his baby's play-group. Bert Large (Ian McNeice) has a female dilemma.5 The Practice Around the Corner -Is Portwenn too small for 2 pharmacists? PC Penhale (John Marquez) fares badly with a survivalist outing. Dr. Ruth's psychology needed all over, even with Doc M. Pa and son Large romantic? Tishell (Selina Cadell) returns, but sane?6 Hazardous Exposure -Insomnia hits Portwenn as well as hypochondria and the town panics. The topper is Doc's Ma (Claire Bloom) arrives with more despairing news. Relationships inTENSEify.7 Listen with Mother -Strain escalates on several Ellingham fronts. A serious accident. Not all is happy in Portwenn, and the town harbors a wanted man. You will still find places you laugh-out-loud.8 Departure -Martin talks to the family shrink when Louisa & baby Henry head to Spain for a holiday separation. Critical conditions go out-of-control in a rare ending to the series seemed surely headed to continuation in season seven.Bonus Features also have SUBTITLES:Martin Clunes as Doc MartinMartin and LouisaPort Isaac as PortwennHow to Speak CornishThe CastThe CrewMaking a SceneWhat Works for Doc MartinAre you new to Doc M?

The doc needs to get some serious mental help!  2nd.  Doc's married and has no idea how to be a good husband.  He's of course has never had any role modeling.  3rd.  His wife, is out of sorts because she won't cut the doc any slack; she seems to expect him to stand up and fly-right just because they're married and have  a kid.  Neither of the people have a clue on how to care for a baby.  Neither wish to give up jobs to care for a life they brought into the world because they were stupid.

NO ONE TRIES TO SIT DOWN AND DISCUSS, LIKE ADULTS, WHAT ARE NEEDS, HOPES, DESIRES, FEARS, EXPECTATIONS, ETC...But, I guess if the characters did that, there would be no show.

1672485,A28YDMI499J1X9,B00FPPQYXM,J. Janssen,"[5, 7]","When I first sat down to write this review I was taken aback by the negative comments claiming the producers had ""jumped the shark"" or made major changes that ruined the show.  In reality Series 6 is simply a continuation of the story arc started with Series 5 and that apparently will continue with a future Series 7.  I'm not going to give anything away but suffice it to say Martin's domestic bliss hits a major bump in the road, and not in a particularly humorous way.  Anyone watching the previous episodes in chronological order would know that Martin is evolving from the one dimensional character we met in Series 1.  Not everyone will approve of the direction they've taken, but to assume the show would remain static was simply naive.  As in the previous series there's 8 episodes on 2 discs running about 45 minutes each, along with additional video of cast and crew talking about the series, themselves, and Port isaac.Much like his American TV contemporary, Dr. House*, Martin was initially portrayed as an uncompromising loner who seemed totally out of his element as a village GP.  From the outset much of the hilarity stemmed from Martin's inept interactions with the odd assortment of patients who crossed his path.  Even though Clunes had been playing versions of this character for several years, the TV series was reaching for a larger audience and needed to establish Martin's quirky side before they could embark on the ensuing narrative of how he overcomes his problems.  It's my opinion that this is what Clunes had in mind all along and the first 3 series were setting the stage for the larger story now being played out.Much of the criticism appears to come from those who would prefer to have that one dimensional character in a series of comedic vignettes and would probably consider any dramatic narrative to be a negative.  Again, the same criticism was leveled at ""House"" when they began to expand the character's personal history and found similar familial disfunction and early romantic failures.  Had Martin simply continued seeing wacky guest stars with odd complaints it would have soon devolved into a pastiche of itself.  One way or another Martin was going to move on, otherwise what would be the point of the show, that he was simply a pathetically unhappy character?  I think they've made some choices that have worked rather well and a few others that haven't.  The path they're on may not suit everyone but it's infinitely more interesting than just leaving him as a cranky, miserable village doctor.Another criticism involved a couple recent cast changes.  These  were largely the result of the bi-annual production schedule and beyond the control of the producers.  All the actors, including Clunes, have other commitments and occasionally conflicts arise.  Unlike American television actors who usually devote their energies to a single role at a time, Brit actors commonly juggle multiple roles during the calender year due to the abbreviated number of new episodes UK television airs each season.  As a result cast changes are not that uncommon in UK productions.  Some shows roll on without a hitch while others fall from grace.  Examples abound, but popular UK shows such as Midsomer Murders, Foyle's War, and New Tricks have all had characters replaced or eliminated over the course of their run.  John Nettles had 3 different sergeants with little effect, though his own departure (along with his entire family) brought a slew of negative commentary.  Many fans of New Tricks feel the show has diminished in quality after cast changes, while Foyle's War carries the additional burden of doing without the backdrop of WW2 and moving only some of the original characters into the post war espionage series.  In ""Doc Martin"" both Stephanie Cole and Katherine Parkinson had other acting jobs and the Doc Martin producers had little choice but to replace their characters.In conclusion, this set continues the story arc that began in Series 5 and ends with an unresolved episode which bodes well for a future Series 7**.  If you were expecting a return to the antics of the earliest episodes you'll probably be disappointed.  I personally thought this group to be the best of the entire series with truly excellent performances by just about every cast member (especially Claire Bloom's ongoing role at age 82 as Martin's hideous mother, and Caroline Catz's most compelling Louisa yet) but rated it with 4 stars to allow for the possibility that it might not suit all tastes.*  Before anyone gets too worked up about one show stealing from another, both debuted in the fall of 2004 and both featured UK based actors of roughly similar background. The Martin character first appeared as Dr. Martin Bamford in the theatrical release ""Saving Grace"" and in two modest UK television movies in the early 2000's.  By all accounts the Gregory House character was drawn from the annals of Sherlock Holmes and owes much to Conan-Doyle's original characterization, including a penchant for self medication with narcotics.**  Clunes stated in a recent UK television interview that the series will continue only as long as the ratings remain at a high level.  Despite the  beautiful production values this is an expensive show to produce with a large cast and crew encamped on location for a minimum of 8 weeks per season. Funding for new episodes has always been dicey as numerous less costly productions compete for slots on the network's schedule.  As with the cast changes future episodes are further complicated by the bi-annual schedule which means cast and crew won't know if they have a job for at least a year down the road, leading some to seek more near term employment which can complicate their availability if future episodes are ultimately scheduled.",4,If you liked Series 5 you'll love Series 6,1388016000,"12 26,

The one thing that I would prescribe &#34;amputation&#34; for is the character of &#34;PC Penhale.&#34;  I quite simply hate the character.  He comes across as so hapless, pathetic, incompetent, and ridiculous, watching scenes with him in it where he is &#34;acting out&#34; are like fingernails on chalkboard.This isn't the fault of the actor playing him..it's just that &#34;PC Penhale&#34; is a character who would more belong in a slapstick comedy (maybe the &#34;Thin Blue Line&#34; or something).  He doesn't belong in &#34;Doc Martin&#34; because while that show is a comedy, it's a comedy with strong dramatic elements and serious story lines (and is not too hard to believe could be a story about real life characters).Every time Penhale bumbles onto the scene, I cringe because I know that he's going to act in a witlessly incompetent fashion.  And it beggars belief that a small town would put up with its only police officer being an ineffectual twit of such magnitude.  So if you're reading this, screenwriters, PLEASE write him out of the story and bring someone in who is more plausible (like the police officer who was in the first 15 or so episodes).",3,Series is Still Good but PC Penhale Character Knocks It Down to 3 Stars,1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,1460,"['was', 'asked', 'give', 'prognosis', '34', 'Doc', 'Martin', '34', 'sixth', 'season', 'would', 'say', '34', 'patient', 'basically', 'healthy', 'perhaps', 'growing', 'somewhat', 'repetitive', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'conflict', 'someone', 'up', 'saving', 'life', 'one', 'thing', 'would', 'prescribe', '34', 'amputation', '34', 'character', '34', 'PC', 'Penhale.', '34', 'quite', 'simply', 'hate', 'character', 'across', 'so', 'hapless', 'pathetic', 'incompetent', 'ridiculous', 'watching', 'scenes', 'where', '34', 'acting', 'out', '34', 'are', 'fingernails', 'chalkboard.This', ""n't"", 'fault', 'actor', 'playing', 'him..it', 'just', '34', 'PC', 'Penhale', '34', 'character', 'who', 'would', 'more', 'belong', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'maybe', '34', 'Thin', 'Blue', 'Line', '34', 'something', ""n't"", 'belong', '34', 'Doc', 'Martin', '34', 'show', 'comedy', 'comedy', 'strong', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'serious', 'story', 'lines', 'not', 'too', 'hard', 'believe', 'could', 'be', 'story', 'real', 'life', 'characters', '.Every', 'time', 'Penhale', 'bumbles', 'scene', 'cringe', 'know', 'going', 'act', 'witlessly', 'incompetent', 'fashion', 'belief', 'small', 'town', 'would', 'put', 'up', 'only', 'police', 'officer', 'being', 'ineffectual', 'twit', 'such', 'magnitude', 'So', ""'re"", 'reading', 'screenwriters', 'PLEASE', 'write', 'story', 'bring', 'someone', 'who', 'more', 'plausible', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'was', 'first', '15', 'so', 'episodes']",Doc Martin Series 6

The doctor himself, played by the talented Martin Clunes, still hasn't adapted to life in the close knit community. Clunes captures the curmudgeonly spirit of the misplaced &#34;Doc&#34; to a T. His short retorts and general tactlessness elicit giggles without trying too hard. Series 6 does step away from the issues of the citizens of Portwenn and the doc's practice to focus more on Martin and his new status as a husband and a father.  Of course matters of the heart aren't easily expressed, but the silent pauses speak volumes -- more than loads of dialogue ever could. Clunes is absolutely perfect in the role.Louisa (Caroline Catz), school headmistress, is Martin's polar opposite. They clash at every turn yet they are both likeable and it is easy to understand the frustrations they have with each other. Additonal supporting characters include officer PC Joe Penhale (aka British Barney Fife) played by John Marquez, as well as a kind-hearted but tough-as-nails, Dr. Ruth Ellingham (Eileen Atkins), and the plumber turned restaurateur, Bert Large (Ian McNeice). Somehow the doc's secretaries practice managers always end up being loud, quirky women and the latest, Morwenna Newcross (Jessica Ransom), makes for the perfect foil to the all business Martin. The brilliant, star-studded, supporting cast make this series complete.Doc Martin is a light-hearted drama fitting for those who like British humor. If you don't mind the occasional peek at a boil or the drawing of blood, this series will pull you in and leave you in stitches (no pun intended).

Doc keeps getting nastier and nastier and I can't wait to see if and how he and Louisa work their problems out. for awhile I found myself disliking him because of his lack of compassion towards anyone, including his family.
