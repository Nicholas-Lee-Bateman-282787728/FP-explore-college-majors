So they decide to buy a bar in Florida and turn in their retirement papers. They are asked to train their replacements and one of the biggest drug dealers gets out on bail. Those two events start a series of events that put everything into perspective. They like being cops, they like catching the bad guy and at least one of them misses his ex-wife.Watching this reminds me of Beverly Hills Cop and I believe that this is probably what set the tone for those similar movies that came after this one.One of the things that stands out watching this movie is that it is dated. By that I mean you will see clothing that looks like it's in the 80's. The car phones are early clunky car phones that only the drug dealers have, and instead of CD's they play cassette tapes in their cars. If that bothers you, this might be a movie you miss. Overall though, I didn't find the dated clothes, phones etc to be distracting.And because it is an older movie, it does not rely on special effects to make the scene. This means though that some of the scenes move slower than you might anticipate and there is not as much in the way of special effects. This means that there is less blood and gore than you might expect if this movie was remade now. I thought that was a good thing.Overall, this reflects what you might expect from a Billy Crystal movie. It's enjoyable, light and funny and yet it still has some serious tones that help you realize what really is important in life (friends, family etc).Well worth renting at a minimum.
