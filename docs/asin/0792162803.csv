There isn't really enough material to expand the sketch to a full length movie, but they made a valiant effort. Hey, it worked for Wayne's World.Parts are funny, but like Mary Katherine Gallagher's auditions, a lot of parts just fall flat. Mary works as a video store rewind girl, and that provides her the opportunity to watch tons of films, classic and trashy. She memorizes parts and then says things like, ""my feelings are best expressed by this dramatic monologue from ________ (insert classic yet incongruous movie title here).Will Ferrell plays a dual role, and is perhaps funnier in his second role. Tom Green doesn't have much to do, and frankly that is a blessing. Emmy Laybourne was great in a little bit as Helen Lewengrub, Mary's friend from Special Ed. At a boring assembly, they amuse themselves by playing Supermodel documentary hour. Though it was just an interlude that did nothing to advance the plot, it was nevertheless a most pleasant excursion.No need for a sequel, the material has already been stretched thin enough.

It's great to have the always-funny Will Ferrell (as well as Harland Williams, one of my favorite comics) alongside her for the ride, but her portrayal of Mary Katherine Gallagher is all you really need to laugh it up for the 80 or so minutes of this SNL skit - turned full-fledged movie.  I sometimes wonder what it would be like to be one of the lucky people who were always cool and made great sport of putting the Mary Katherine Gallaghers of the world down.  I'll never know because Mary Katherine is definitely ""my people,"" a unique character who suffers the insults and humiliations of life among her cooler, prettier peers even as she dreams of having just a taste of the kind of life they take for granted.  In the context of this movie, what Mary Katherine yearns for is a real slobber-knocker of a kiss - and, like all of us losers, she falls for the most popular guy/girl in school.  In other words, she does not have an easy row to hoe.She is realistic enough to realize that the likes of Sky Corrigan (Ferrell) isn't going to drop the head cheerleader and come smooching her way any time soon (even after he tells her she has some nice moves).  No, she thinks the only way she can get the hunky guy is to emulate her Hollywood heroines and become a - wait for it - Superstar!  And just when she thinks she's exhausted all of her options, along comes a school talent show (with the winner getting the part of an extra in a morally positive film in Hollywood) that just might be the answer to her prayers.  Winning the talent show would definitely impress Sky, she tells herself.To make her dreams come true, she's going to have to talk her grandmother into letting her audition, scratch and claw her way through a catfight or two with the head cheerleader (who also happens to be Sky's girlfriend), and overcome several other less than surprising obstacles in her way.  She does have some help, though - from her fellow Special Education students, her new best friend, and even her own personal image of Jesus (also played by Will Ferrell).Yes, it's oftentimes low-brow humor, especially in terms of the whole armpit thing, but somehow Mary Katherine's story always manages to remain above the fray of tastelessness and vapidity.  There's a little (or maybe even a lot) of Mary Katherine Gallagher in many of us, and there is actually a good story in here beyond all of the jokes.  The filmmakers even manage to pull off a really good ending without insulting our intelligence.

130720,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,0792162803,David Baldwin,"[1, 2]","""Superstar"" tackles the twin anxieties that spread fear in the hearts of teenagers, puberty and Catholic School.  The best of these kind of films are ones that tap into the pain and by circumstance the humor that exists in these subjects.  The best films in their respective genres are probably the work of John Hughes and a relatively obscure film from 1985, ""Heaven Help Us"", starring Andrew McCarthy.  ""Superstar"" does not breathe the same rarified air as those films.  The problem with this flick is that the humor is at best simplistic at worst sophomoric.  It would be helpful if the film contained some sympathetic characters.  Mary Katherine Gallagher as portrayed by Molly Shannon is both self-absorbed and obnoxious.  This may be intentional but it doesn't make her any more likable.  She reminded me of a more abrasive incarnation of a similar but more endearing character Gilda Radner portrayed on the original Saturday Night Live, Judy Miller.

When the movie came out I was waiting to see it, but the theather next to me only plays certain movies so they didn't get that one in. When it came out for rental I rushed to the rental store and grabbed a copy. I LOVED IT! The cast was great and it was all put together nicely.Superstar is about a girl in a Catholic high school that has the dream of being famous and have a big Hollywood type kiss. But at school no onw likes her and when she walks down the hall she gets made fun of. Her remark to all of this is ""Did you know that I'm rubber and your glue so anything you say bounces off of me and sticks right back on you? So put that in your back pocket"". The boy she likes, Sky,(Will Ferrel's character) is the most popular guy in school but hes dating the most popular girl, Evian(played by Elaine Hendrix). She gets the job at the local rental store as the Rewind Girl so she can study all the movies that need to be rewound. As the movie goes on Mary gets put into Special Ed. and makes a best friend, Helen. Helen is a really hyper kind of person. When they are having lunch they see that they are putting up a sign for a chance to ""be an extra, in a movie with psitive morel values"". Marys chance to stardom! She decides to try out but when asking her grandmother if she can, she says absolutly not. She then tells Mary to have parents were stomped to death at a step dancing compition. The next day Mary still trys out...The rest is so histarical that i don't want to tell you. So go rent this movie right away. And enjoy it like I did.

At times, the film is very funny. Unfortunately, it is not very funny as often as one would like. What works great as a five minute skit on Saturday Night Live does not necessarily make for a great full length, feature film, even though quite a few of the Saturday Night Live regulars have parts in it.The film revolves around Mary Katherine Gallagher and her attempts to fit in and make the most popular boy in the school want her the way she wants him. She also wants to be a superstar in the worst way, even though her grandmother with whom she lives wants her to become a business woman. She does get her big break, however, when her school has a talent contest.Some of the funniest scenes in the movie occur when Mary Katherine, absorbed in her romantic fantasies and impervious to her surroundings, has a one sided conversation with an apparent fantasy lover for whom she substitutes a tree as a stand in.

Scott ""futurestar""","[0, 0]","SUPERSTAR is the poignant, silly, campy comedy about a goofy, oddball, neurotic catholic schoolgirl, pining for attention in all the wrong ways. Another SNL project, this is the mastermind vehicle for Molly Shannon's Mary Katherine Gallagher character, co-staring Glynis Johns as her doting grandmother, Will Ferrell as the must-have guy from high school, and Elaine Hendrix as the loathsome cheerleader enemy. We travel her frustrations as she endeavors to try out for a talent show and a chance to win the part as ""an extra, in a movie with positive values"". I work in the industry, and I tell you, they get it right. Unlike most teen movies, this one has substance and something for those over the age thirty. The humor makes fun of everyone and everything, leaving no stones unturned in its wake. The characters as classmates are most inventive and idiosyncrartic bunch to grace the silver screen in some time. Even God makes a cameo appearance. Basically, this is the classic story of an ugly duckling turning into a swan, not one of beauty, but essence. The transition is necessary to convey the lessons one might learn, and the awkward process high school still is - the cliques, the estranged, the popular, the jocks, the shunned, etc. In the end, there are no real losers except those who never see this movie for the wonderful, modern fairy tale is really is. My only real beef is the tree didn't get screen credit, but the dance routine in the cafeteria is too die for. I'd put this down as one of my favorite teen comedies.

130781,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,0792162803,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[0, 1]","Like most Saturday Night Live films from the 1990s, this 1999 movie expands a recurrent skit from the TV show, and is just as awful now on DVD as when it was released. In this case, Irish-American comedienne Molly Shannon brings her Catholic schoolgirl Mary Catherine Gallagher (the one who was always smelling her armpits on TV) to the big screen in what turns out to be a terribly unfunny movie almost from minute one. This is the sort of movie that you vaguely remember being funny 15 years ago, only to rediscover on DVD the tremendous depths of its badness.The concept of an awkward teenage girl lusting after the cool quarterback (Will Ferrell) in a Catholic high school is a potentially funny one, but this film ruins it with horrible dialogue and unfunny cliches. The film's timeframe is most bizarre of all, as it seems to be taking place in the 1970s world of habited nuns and record players that formed Shannon's childhood, but otherwise appears to be set in contemporary America. Furthermore, Shannon is way too old to be believable as a high school girl, even within the limits of good comedy. The spectacle of watching a clearly middle-aged woman go through a series of sophomoric teen gags is frequently embarrassing rather than funny as it is presented here. Many scenes are so surprisingly bad that even Will Ferrell, who is usually a likable goofy presence, can't salvage them. For 82 minutes, there is rarely a smile or chuckle in this movie, but there is frequently a temptation to check one's watch.Overall, the biggest problem with this film is that it is offensive, in the very specific sense that it offends your intelligence in every scene. It offends your intelligence, not your religious sensibilities, by relentlessly making its characters do stupid and unbelievable things. Despite the fact that Mary Catherine appears to emerge from a deep place in Molly Shannon's Irish Catholic psyche, the movie makes no effort to respect her as a character or take her seriously, undermining the audience's ability to identify with her as a protagonist. Shannon pushes her weirdness into cartoonish insanity. With no likable characters to elicit anything resembling empathy from the viewer, this film requires only that we watch the train wreck as it happens, and it happens big time. There's a reason that Molly Shannon's film career vanished into thin air after this film.There a few mildly amusing moments in the movie. Some of the misfits in  Mary Catherine's special ed class have quirky moments of humor. It's nice to see &#34;Kids in the Hall&#34; veteran Bruce McCulloch directing fellow alumnus Mark McKinney in his quirky role as Father Ritley, the benevolent and bumbling head priest at Mary Catherine's high school. And Will Ferrell is briefly amusing as a hippie Jesus who occasionally appears to Mary Catherine, despite being underused in comparison to his dual role as the narcissistic high school quarterback. Unfortunately, these are very brief glimmers of entertainment in an otherwise disappointing film that doesn't even rise to the goofy level of brilliance found in other SNL films like &#34;A Night At the Roxbury.&#34; You'll live a long and full life if you skip this one.",2,Catholic schoolgirl SNL skit flops on the big screen,1397260800,"04 12, 2014",2014,3214,"['most', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'films', '1990s', '1999', 'movie', 'recurrent', 'skit', 'TV', 'show', 'just', 'awful', 'now', 'DVD', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'case', 'Irish-American', 'comedienne', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'Catholic', 'schoolgirl', 'Mary', 'Catherine', 'Gallagher', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'always', 'smelling', 'armpits', 'TV', 'big', 'screen', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'terribly', 'unfunny', 'movie', 'almost', 'minute', 'one', 'sort', 'movie', 'vaguely', 'remember', 'being', 'funny', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'only', 'rediscover', 'DVD', 'tremendous', 'depths', 'badness.The', 'concept', 'awkward', 'teenage', 'girl', 'lusting', 'cool', 'quarterback', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Catholic', 'high', 'school', 'potentially', 'funny', 'one', 'film', 'horrible', 'dialogue', 'unfunny', 'cliches', 'film', 'timeframe', 'most', 'bizarre', 'be', 'taking', 'place', '1970s', 'world', 'habited', 'nuns', 'record', 'players', 'formed', 'Shannon', 'childhood', 'otherwise', 'be', 'set', 'contemporary', 'America', 'Furthermore', 'Shannon', 'way', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'believable', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'even', 'limits', 'good', 'comedy', 'spectacle', 'watching', 'clearly', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'go', 'series', 'sophomoric', 'teen', 'gags', 'frequently', 'embarrassing', 'rather', 'funny', 'presented', 'here', 'Many', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'surprisingly', 'bad', 'even', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'who', 'usually', 'likable', 'goofy', 'presence', 'ca', ""n't"", 'salvage', '82', 'minutes', 'rarely', 'smile', 'chuckle', 'movie', 'frequently', 'temptation', 'check', 'one', 'watch.Overall', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'offensive', 'very', 'specific', 'sense', 'intelligence', 'scene', 'intelligence', 'not', 'religious', 'sensibilities', 'relentlessly', 'making', 'characters', 'do', 'stupid', 'unbelievable', 'things', 'fact', 'Mary', 'Catherine', 'emerge', 'deep', 'place', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'Irish', 'Catholic', 'psyche', 'movie', 'effort', 'respect', 'character', 'take', 'seriously', 'undermining', 'audience', 'ability', 'identify', 'protagonist', 'Shannon', 'weirdness', 'cartoonish', 'insanity', 'likable', 'characters', 'elicit', 'anything', 'resembling', 'empathy', 'viewer', 'film', 'only', 'watch', 'train', 'wreck', 'big', 'time', 'reason', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'film', 'career', 'vanished', 'thin', 'air', 'few', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'moments', 'movie', 'misfits', 'Mary', 'Catherine', 'special', 'ed', 'class', 'have', 'quirky', 'moments', 'humor', 'nice', 'see', '34', 'Kids', 'Hall', '34', 'veteran', 'Bruce', 'McCulloch', 'directing', 'fellow', 'alumnus', 'Mark', 'McKinney', 'quirky', 'role', 'Father', 'Ritley', 'benevolent', 'bumbling', 'head', 'priest', 'Mary', 'Catherine', 'high', 'school', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'briefly', 'amusing', 'hippie', 'Jesus', 'who', 'occasionally', 'Mary', 'Catherine', 'being', 'underused', 'comparison', 'dual', 'role', 'narcissistic', 'high', 'school', 'quarterback', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'very', 'brief', 'glimmers', 'entertainment', 'otherwise', 'disappointing', 'film', ""n't"", 'even', 'rise', 'goofy', 'level', 'brilliance', 'found', 'other', 'SNL', 'films', '34', 'Night', 'Roxbury.', '34', ""'ll"", 'live', 'long', 'full', 'life', 'skip', 'one']",N/A
