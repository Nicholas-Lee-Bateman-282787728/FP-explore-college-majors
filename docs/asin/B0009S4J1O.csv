912252,A2K6XRL5PUKWJ9,B0009S4J1O,abbyjo,"[0, 0]","I enjoyed this film, which filled several hours of this evening, as I needed to rewind and savor this and that.  The screen cannot replicate the vastness of this area, which I've only driven through in the distant past.  &#34;Ophelia's Ghost&#34; is a novel set in the same area of the American Southwest. The vast empty undulating vibrating curve; ever changing echos our psyche, ever hungry for &#34;more.&#34;A man is rich when he has a good marriage, a loving child, owns his home, lives by his wits and skill. Money is optional. Though I have not seen any comment yet here, not only is he a genius for living &#34;off the grid&#34; without money but he has no jealousy, he is gracious, he is generous. He has no anger. He owns his actions and his words and chooses them wisely.The young IRS agent was himself hungry...he had not been an agent for long. He realized after the bee sting that he had not come to New Mexico to collect back taxes from people that have no taxable income. As the tax man realized his true value as a man, so did the other characters.  The rest is art.Depression is a tricky business. Like a black hole, it sucks in not just the &#34;patient,&#34; but everyone around him. He is begged to swallow pills when everyone in the small family is sick of the head of house withdrawing into himself. Hadn't he earned it? The right to be quiet for awhile? Was the depression coming from him? Was it imposed on him by outsiders, in their judgements of him as a &#34;failure?&#34; such as the comment by the deliveryman, &#34;Are you all on mushrooms?&#34; Or did he just need something to do? Like making oil paint? Like Rembrandt did...and in the process enabling a seeker to become an artist. Trusting the one that comes to you to complete you...without force, and when they leave by death or bus...trusting what remains is wisdom.Hopi dates back to Anasazi peoples who built their homes into the cracks of high mountains. These people have been living on this land, without money, taxes, or governments since before Noah's Ark and the great flood. The film hints about the circle of life, the roundness of the horizon, the ever-changing nature of reality.  Or perhaps it is no more than a great circle, a cycle of life.I think it would be better on a big screen, and maybe there is some way to doctor it so that it looks 3d, but the point is to open the vision within...just as the stories read aloud of sails and sailing ships manifested one day in a real boat. They don't have to be perfect. If they were, there would be nothing left for us viewers to do after we watch the film.",4,Sail to the Land of Enchantment,1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,2605,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'filled', 'several', 'hours', 'evening', 'needed', 'rewind', 'savor', 'screen', 'can', 'not', 'replicate', 'vastness', 'area', ""'ve"", 'only', 'driven', 'distant', 'past', '34', 'Ophelia', 'Ghost', '34', 'novel', 'set', 'same', 'area', 'American', 'Southwest', 'vast', 'empty', 'undulating', 'vibrating', 'curve', 'ever', 'changing', 'echos', 'psyche', 'ever', 'hungry', '34', 'more.', '34', 'man', 'rich', 'when', 'good', 'marriage', 'loving', 'child', 'home', 'lives', 'wits', 'skill', 'Money', 'optional', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'comment', 'yet', 'here', 'not', 'only', 'genius', 'living', '34', 'grid', '34', 'money', 'jealousy', 'gracious', 'generous', 'anger', 'actions', 'words', 'wisely.The', 'young', 'IRS', 'agent', 'was', 'hungry', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'agent', 'long', 'realized', 'bee', 'sting', 'had', 'not', 'come', 'New', 'Mexico', 'collect', 'back', 'taxes', 'people', 'have', 'taxable', 'income', 'tax', 'man', 'realized', 'true', 'value', 'man', 'so', 'did', 'other', 'characters', 'rest', 'art.Depression', 'tricky', 'business', 'black', 'hole', 'not', 'just', '34', 'patient', '34', 'everyone', 'begged', 'swallow', 'pills', 'when', 'everyone', 'small', 'family', 'sick', 'head', 'house', 'withdrawing', 'Had', ""n't"", 'earned', 'right', 'be', 'quiet', 'awhile', 'Was', 'depression', 'coming', 'Was', 'imposed', 'outsiders', 'judgements', '34', 'failure', '34', 'such', 'comment', 'deliveryman', '34', 'Are', 'mushrooms', '34', 'did', 'just', 'need', 'something', 'do', 'making', 'oil', 'paint', 'Rembrandt', 'did', 'process', 'enabling', 'seeker', 'become', 'artist', 'Trusting', 'one', 'complete', 'force', 'when', 'leave', 'death', 'bus', 'trusting', 'what', 'wisdom.Hopi', 'dates', 'back', 'Anasazi', 'peoples', 'who', 'built', 'homes', 'cracks', 'high', 'mountains', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'land', 'money', 'taxes', 'governments', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'great', 'flood', 'film', 'hints', 'circle', 'life', 'roundness', 'horizon', 'ever-changing', 'nature', 'reality', 'perhaps', 'more', 'great', 'circle', 'cycle', 'life.I', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'big', 'screen', 'maybe', 'way', 'doctor', 'so', '3d', 'point', 'open', 'vision', 'just', 'stories', 'read', 'aloud', 'sails', 'sailing', 'ships', 'manifested', 'one', 'day', 'real', 'boat', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'perfect', 'were', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'left', 'viewers', 'do', 'watch', 'film']",N/A
912253,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B0009S4J1O,Alistair McHarg,"[12, 13]","The action in this film, such as it is, takes place quite literally ""off the map"" on a self-sufficient single-family homestead lost in the austere and exquisitely beautiful expanse of New Mexico scrubland. But the movie's essence is a strong argument for the idea that there is no map to guide people where they must go, on the journeys that will heal them and give their lives meaning. All the people in this superb film, definitely worth tracking down and owning, go on such journeys, not because they intend to, but because their lives intersect and prompt change, however subtle.The ""star"" and narrator is Bo Groden, played faultlessly by Valentina de Angelis. Her story concerns a year in her life when she was 12 or so, told in flashbacks recalled as an adult.  Despite living a virtually medieval existence, no running water or electricity, she is highly sophisticated with a keen interest in the outside world. (Her letters to customer service departments and newspaper advice columns are simply delightful and showcase her intelligence, charm, and innocence simultaneously.)Bo's mother Arlene, the family's anchor, is realized with subtlety and finesse by Joan Allen. Arlene manages to be playful, responsible, compassionate, and firm all at once, never losing sight of what's important. Her husband Charley is another story. Sam Eliott is dazzling as a man locked down in a paralyzing depression. These people do not romanticize anything, and watching Bo and Arlene work around Charley's black cloud is often intentionally funny.Into this equation comes William Gibbs, Jim True-Frost, who is, of all things, an IRS agent. For an IRS agent this would be the most improbable assignment of a lifetime. That it's his first, and that he clearly dislikes the work, compounds the dilemma. Gibbs quickly morphs from attacking outsider to dependent insider and is absorbed into this wonderfully generous and real group of people. He develops an idealized love for Arlene and a profound admiration for Charley. When he begins painting it is clear that something has happened to him, he has turned a corner.Just as the old story goes about one cow in one barn starting the great Chicago fire, so the presence of Gibbs and his soul-searching injects just enough passion into the equation to transform this whole family, in ways that are entirely heartwarming. Bo becomes less adult and gets more of the parenting she needs, Charley regains a grip on what's great about life, and Arlene gets her husband back. With the exception of a coyote being killed, the film contains no violence at all. In perfect keeping with the movie's spiritual perfection, the coyote's death is an occasion for grief, making amends, and redemption.

912255,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B0009S4J1O,Artist & Author,"[9, 9]","As I write this, my oldest daughter now lives in the wealthiest suburb in Canada.  However, when she was nine-ten years old, about the same age as 'Bo' in this movie, we moved to a small ranch in the California Sierras.  It was raw land so we lived in a tent for some months, then got a tiny trailer for winter.  We had no electricity, no plumbing, and the nearest phone was about 200 yards away in a little shed.  While others were watching 'Little House on the Prairie' on TV, my kids were living it!This time is now fondly recalled by my daughters as the best time of their lives.  They loved to have Mom read them stories by the light of a kerosene lamp.  In the winter, they stood by the heater to warm up.  They had to walk a mile just to catch the school bus to take them to school.  It was a treat to watch TV when they could plug a tiny 12-volt B&W; TV into our truck.  My daughter could ride her pony seven miles up to the end of our road in safety.Like 'Bo' in this movie, they were always busy, inventing new games and exploring the area.  There was a pool in a nearby creek where they and the other kids in the area would go swimming.  Watching 'Bo' in this movie, it seemed  like I was watching our kids all over again.  'Bo's' life was very realistically depicted in this movie, almost like a documentary.  I write this for any family that is thinking of leaving the hectic life of the city for the simple life.  This movie gives a very realistic portrayal of what your children's life would be like if you moved 'off the map.'This should be a PG movie; there is almost no questionable language, so I guess the fact that they showed that the family were naturists raised the rating.  The mother is very, very discreetly shown naked out in the garden soaking up the warmth of the sun, and the father was also implied to be naked when the IRS agent came up.  [If I'd made the movie, I'd also have had 'Bo' shown skinny-dipping to indicate that the whole family had healthy body acceptance.]  Even this aspect is realistic.  We had a hose rigged up over a tree branch for a shower, and one time my wife was taking a shower when a small airplane flew over -  and then circled over her a few times!  Our kids wore clothes more for protection from the sun in the summer than out of 'modesty.'  Indeed, some of their friends became naturists as well when they went with us to the river to swim.One aspect of this movie that is unlike so many movies is that the wife remained faithful to her husband, even though he could not be an equal partner, in spite of the fact that the IRS agent declared that he was in love with her.There isn't any real story to the movie - it is more of a chronicle of daily life for the family over a period of time.  The movie is slow-paced, which is like life in such a situation is in reality.  We found it to be very enjoyable.  'Bo' gave a very realistic portrayal of a typical eleven-year-old girl living that life.  This is a movie one could watch over and over just to vicariously slow down and enjoy the simple things of life more![Three stars for the 'story' with five stars for accurate, realism give the movie four stars for me.]",4,Very Realistic Depiction,1146873600,"05 6, 2006",2006,3176,"['write', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'now', 'wealthiest', 'suburb', 'Canada', 'However', 'when', 'was', 'nine-ten', 'years', 'old', 'same', 'age', ""'Bo"", 'movie', 'moved', 'small', 'ranch', 'California', 'Sierras', 'was', 'raw', 'land', 'lived', 'tent', 'months', 'then', 'got', 'tiny', 'trailer', 'winter', 'had', 'electricity', 'plumbing', 'nearest', 'phone', 'was', '200', 'yards', 'away', 'little', 'shed', 'others', 'were', 'watching', ""'Little"", 'House', 'Prairie', 'TV', 'kids', 'were', 'living', 'time', 'now', 'fondly', 'recalled', 'daughters', 'best', 'time', 'lives', 'loved', 'have', 'Mom', 'read', 'stories', 'light', 'kerosene', 'lamp', 'winter', 'stood', 'heater', 'warm', 'up', 'had', 'walk', 'mile', 'just', 'catch', 'school', 'bus', 'take', 'school', 'was', 'treat', 'watch', 'TV', 'when', 'could', 'plug', 'tiny', '12-volt', 'B', 'W', 'TV', 'truck', 'daughter', 'could', 'ride', 'pony', 'seven', 'miles', 'up', 'end', 'road', 'safety.Like', ""'Bo"", 'movie', 'were', 'always', 'busy', 'inventing', 'new', 'games', 'exploring', 'area', 'was', 'pool', 'nearby', 'creek', 'where', 'other', 'kids', 'area', 'would', 'go', 'swimming', 'Watching', 'movie', 'seemed', 'was', 'watching', 'kids', 'over', 'again', 'life', 'was', 'very', 'realistically', 'depicted', 'movie', 'almost', 'documentary', 'write', 'family', 'thinking', 'leaving', 'hectic', 'life', 'city', 'simple', 'life', 'movie', 'very', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'what', 'children', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'moved', 'map', 'should', 'be', 'PG', 'movie', 'almost', 'questionable', 'language', 'so', 'guess', 'fact', 'showed', 'family', 'were', 'naturists', 'raised', 'rating', 'mother', 'very', 'very', 'discreetly', 'shown', 'naked', 'out', 'garden', 'soaking', 'up', 'warmth', 'sun', 'father', 'was', 'also', 'implied', 'be', 'naked', 'when', 'IRS', 'agent', 'came', 'up', ""'d"", 'made', 'movie', ""'d"", 'also', 'have', 'had', ""'Bo"", 'shown', 'skinny-dipping', 'indicate', 'whole', 'family', 'had', 'healthy', 'body', 'acceptance', ']', 'Even', 'aspect', 'realistic', 'had', 'hose', 'rigged', 'up', 'tree', 'branch', 'shower', 'one', 'time', 'wife', 'was', 'taking', 'shower', 'when', 'small', 'airplane', 'flew', 'then', 'circled', 'over', 'few', 'times', 'kids', 'wore', 'clothes', 'more', 'protection', 'sun', 'summer', ""'modesty"", 'Indeed', 'friends', 'became', 'naturists', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'went', 'river', 'swim.One', 'aspect', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'wife', 'remained', 'faithful', 'husband', 'even', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'equal', 'partner', 'spite', 'fact', 'IRS', 'agent', 'declared', 'was', 'love', 'her.There', ""n't"", 'real', 'story', 'movie', 'more', 'chronicle', 'daily', 'life', 'family', 'period', 'time', 'movie', 'slow-paced', 'life', 'such', 'situation', 'reality', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'gave', 'very', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'typical', 'eleven-year-old', 'girl', 'living', 'life', 'movie', 'one', 'could', 'watch', 'over', 'just', 'vicariously', 'slow', 'down', 'enjoy', 'simple', 'things', 'life', 'more', '[', 'Three', 'stars', ""'story"", 'five', 'stars', 'accurate', 'realism', 'give', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', ']']",N/A

It's a quiet, simple and relatively happy life for the Grodin's until Charley unexpectedly falls into a deep, prolonged depression.

That 'I would have as much patience with him that the wife in this film has with her struggling husband'. Elliot's character is suffering from depression. His young daughter seems to be in her own little world, though not totally unaffected by her father's illness. I was touched with the beauty, patience and simplicity of the characters and their love for their surroundings. I think the young man sent by the IRS captured it completely when he tells the father that he's truly 'his own man'.

An IRS agent from near Boston comes to audit the taxes of a family that lives off the land.  They do so somewhat comfortably, but they make less than $5000 a year.  The agent, who has an artist's heart, falls in love with Joan Allen from the moment he sees her meditating naked in the garden.  He doesn't do so because it's a sexual turn-on as much as because it awakens his spirit to find himself.  He falls sick with a bad reaction to a bee sting, and when he is better several days later, he decides to quit the IRS thing and become an artist and stick around.Sam Elliott, Allen's husband, is depressed for really no reason, but it is with the help of our former IRS agent that he comes back to his old, happy self.The movie is taken by young actess Valentina de Angelis, who, despite being the youngest character, is the one who steers straight the ship.  You'll have to watch the movie to find out why this is both figurative, and literal.The biggest star of Off the Map is New Mexico itself.

912263,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0009S4J1O,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[7, 8]","No, this isn't another installment in National Lampoon's Vacation series, nor does it chronicle the wacky adventures of a group of friends who get lost on their way to some idyllic vacation spot and wind up trying to hide from inbred cannibalistic hillbillies.  Off the Map refers to the isolated setting of the story - as well as the very nature and tenor of the film compared to what you expect from movies these days.  I won't talk about this film in terms of comedy at all, as I don't think it has anything to do with comedy.  This is a low-key yet impassioned human drama about nothing and everything, an odd study of human nature, family life, living in communion with nature, and the whole cycle of life that always turns out to be much more circular than we ever expected.Amy Brenneman only appears at the beginning and end of the film, as this is really a story of her character's childhood, especially one important and meaningful summer.  Valentina de Angelis plays the twelve-year-old Bo, a girl who dreams of bigger and better things and, to some measure, helps provide for her family in her own special way.  Hers is not exactly the classic American home.  For one thing, they do live off the map; take a left at the boondocks, go about thirty miles until you reach the sticks, and you've still got a decent trip ahead of you to get to their house.  The family has almost no income, living off of what they grow and kill, and Bo's life basically includes only three people: her resourceful mother, her dad's friend George, and her father - who, at this time, was an extremely depressed man.  Sam Elliot spends most of his screen time staring into space or crying.  Young Bo, on the other hand, is perpetually spirited - and infectiously charming (and I must mention the fact that Valentina de Angelis is a remarkably gifted young actress).This summer of Bo's father's depression, the family gets audited by the I.R.S.  Agent William Gibbs (Jim True-Frost) somehow manages to find their house, only to be stung by a bee and lapse into a days-long fever.  He wakes up a changed man, deciding apparently be default to stay right there in the New Mexico desert and begin painting.  His presence there turns out to be important in more ways than one.You know, I really can't even describe this movie.  Things just slowly take shape as the summer draws to a close, and the ending does provide a great deal of cloture to this unusual, slightly surreal storyline.  By and large, this is a rather depressing movie, yet it somehow seems to shine a flashlight into dark, overlooked nooks and crannies in your soul.  You feel as if you have learned something from the whole experience - even if you can't describe what that might be.  I can't say with any assurance that there is any real point to the movie - but maybe that in and of itself is the point.  The whole movie's sort of a metaphor for life - it's a strange journey, you don't always know where you are or where you're going, and in the end you feel like the whole experience must have meant something.",5,"Well, that was certainly different",1130198400,"10 25, 2005",2005,3066,"[""n't"", 'installment', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Vacation', 'series', 'chronicle', 'wacky', 'adventures', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'get', 'lost', 'way', 'idyllic', 'vacation', 'spot', 'wind', 'up', 'trying', 'hide', 'inbred', 'cannibalistic', 'hillbillies', 'Map', 'refers', 'isolated', 'setting', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'nature', 'tenor', 'film', 'compared', 'what', 'expect', 'movies', 'days', 'wo', ""n't"", 'talk', 'film', 'terms', 'comedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'do', 'comedy', 'low-key', 'yet', 'impassioned', 'human', 'drama', 'nothing', 'everything', 'odd', 'study', 'human', 'nature', 'family', 'life', 'living', 'communion', 'nature', 'whole', 'cycle', 'life', 'always', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'circular', 'ever', 'expected.Amy', 'Brenneman', 'only', 'beginning', 'end', 'film', 'really', 'story', 'character', 'childhood', 'especially', 'one', 'important', 'meaningful', 'summer', 'Valentina', 'Angelis', 'twelve-year-old', 'Bo', 'girl', 'who', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'measure', 'provide', 'family', 'own', 'special', 'way', 'Hers', 'not', 'exactly', 'classic', 'American', 'home', 'one', 'thing', 'do', 'live', 'off', 'map', 'take', 'left', 'boondocks', 'go', 'thirty', 'miles', 'reach', 'sticks', ""'ve"", 'still', 'got', 'decent', 'trip', 'ahead', 'get', 'house', 'family', 'almost', 'income', 'living', 'what', 'grow', 'kill', 'Bo', 'life', 'basically', 'only', 'three', 'people', 'resourceful', 'mother', 'dad', 'friend', 'George', 'father', 'who', 'time', 'was', 'extremely', 'depressed', 'man', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'staring', 'space', 'crying', 'Young', 'Bo', 'other', 'hand', 'perpetually', 'spirited', 'infectiously', 'charming', 'must', 'mention', 'fact', 'Valentina', 'de', 'Angelis', 'remarkably', 'gifted', 'young', 'actress', 'summer', 'Bo', 'father', 'depression', 'family', 'audited', 'I.R.S', 'Agent', 'William', 'Gibbs', 'Jim', 'True-Frost', 'somehow', 'find', 'house', 'only', 'be', 'stung', 'bee', 'lapse', 'days-long', 'fever', 'up', 'changed', 'man', 'deciding', 'apparently', 'be', 'default', 'stay', 'right', 'there', 'New', 'Mexico', 'desert', 'begin', 'painting', 'presence', 'there', 'out', 'be', 'important', 'more', 'ways', 'one.You', 'know', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'describe', 'movie', 'Things', 'just', 'slowly', 'take', 'shape', 'summer', 'close', 'ending', 'provide', 'great', 'deal', 'cloture', 'unusual', 'slightly', 'surreal', 'storyline', 'large', 'rather', 'depressing', 'movie', 'somehow', 'shine', 'flashlight', 'dark', 'overlooked', 'nooks', 'crannies', 'soul', 'feel', 'have', 'learned', 'something', 'whole', 'experience', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'describe', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'assurance', 'real', 'point', 'movie', 'maybe', 'point', 'whole', 'movie', 'sort', 'metaphor', 'life', 'strange', 'journey', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'know', 'where', 'are', 'where', ""'re"", 'going', 'end', 'feel', 'whole', 'experience', 'must', 'have', 'meant', 'something']",N/A

""Off the Map"" is an unpretentious film, yet full of life, honesty, and humor. The dialogue is sharp, saying just as much between the lines as in them.""Off the Map"" is told through the eyes of a twelve-year-old girl, likable Bo. She is a survivor. She is intelligent. And she is lonely. Her father, played by Sam Elliott, is in a six-month-long depression, and this darkness looms over the family and their northern New Mexico homestead. Joan Allen does a fantastic job of acting as the wife, trying to hold things together for the sake of her loved ones. J.K. Simmons plays the quiet, stalwart friend. They live in the middle of nowhere, surviving off the land, making next to nothing, but when an IRS man arrives to do an audit, all of their lives are changed.Young Bo is a keen observer, often very insightful, even as she comes of age. Her mother and father both have their own issues to work through, as does their friend. But the IRS man is the X-factor who sparks new life, love, and ideas, even as he struggles with memory's of his mother's suicide when he was a young boy.If you like independent films, or if you're a big fan of Joan Allen's or Sam Elliott's, this is a film you must see.

It was written by Joan Ackerman. He loved the dramatic event, and immediately took out the option to film it. But per usual for these kinds of aspirations, he took 10 years to put the project together. In the interim, he directed three other films, BIG NIGHT (1996), HAMLET (2000) starring himself, and FINAL (2001).He brought his film crew in 2002 to a remote corner of New Mexico, north of Taos, not far from the old D.H. Lawrence ranch. They constructed the ""Grodin"" house with lots of extra windows. Scott, and his crack cinematographer, Juan Ruiz Anchia, used the intense southwestern sunlight and the breathtaking high desert landscape like another member of the cast.This is the story of a woman in her late 30's, Amy Brenneman, who reflects upon the summer she was 11 years old -the summer her father was depressed -the year a stranger came into her life and joined the family. Nothing was ever the same after that.Valentina de Angelis played young Bo. In her film debut she shows great promise, rivaling other grand performances by young girls, like Mary Badham in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, and Tatum O'Neal in PAPER MOON. She played a precocious intelligent child who although she dearly loved her father, she needed to grow up and escape the narrow, albeit natural, limits of the Eden he had created for his family. Sam Elliott played Charley Grodin. This is one of his finest roles. Playing against type, he reveals a rare vulnerability and emotional fragility that he has withheld from us in the past. He habitually stands in shadow and is often nearly mute -but we always know he is there and that he is in tremendous pain. Joan Allen, plays the wife and mother, Arlene, as a feisty sexy half-Hopi earthy long-haired hippie -who adores her eccentric husband and her fussing child, and thrives in the lifestyle that Charley has created out of inventiveness and a lot of useful items from the County Dump. She is struggling with the role of matriarch since her spouse is shut down with his crippling emotional issues. Jim True-Frost excels in the pivotal role of William Gibbs, the IRS pariah who wandered in lost off the desert -becomes first mesmerized by Arlene and then is stung by Grodin honey bees and falls into a near coma and fever. Emerging from his vision quest, he has an epiphany -quits the IRS, continues to live with the Grodins, and becomes an artist. J.K.Simmons does a nice turn as well as the loyal, although dim best friend, George.This is a slow moving yet sparkling film that merits a good look.

912269,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0009S4J1O,Grady Harp,"[10, 11]","OFF THE MAP is so unique a film that comparisons pale.  Adapted from her own play Joan Ackermann has written a screenplay whose main character is the high desert of New Mexico and the magical influence that natural beauty and tranquility of the place has on people.  Campbell Scott directs this intimate little story with such tenderness and intelligence that he has created what doubtless will become a cult classic.The time is the early 1970s, and the location is an isolated single home north of Taos owned by a strange family who live on less than $5000. a year by being at one with the land for its provisions. Charley (Sam Elliott) is in a chronically depressive state, unable to speak much and preferring to simply sit in the dark and periodically weep.  His resilient wife Arlene (Joan Allen) fends for the family, gardening for food and hunting for meat, selling crafts at the periodic fairs in Taos, and caring for her husband.  Their daughter Bo (Valentina de Angelis) is 11 and not only fully capable of living the life style of her family, but also at the same time longing for the ability to leave home and see the world, a desire she feeds by wisely devising rebates on food purchases, applications for credit cards etc.  The family's solid friend is George (JK Simmons) who has known Charley since their Korean War days and is fraught with his friend's severe depression.Into this physically gorgeous terrain that is home to this odd family comes an IRS agent William Gibbs (Jim True-Frost) sent by his new government boss to collect back taxes from the family who has not seen the necessity to pay taxes on their below modest income.  William approaches the house, sees Arlene gardening in the nude, is stung by a bee, and lapses into an allergic reaction, a situation that makes him a patient in the household for some days.  Bo is fascinated with this 'man form the outside world', Arlene cares for the patient, and Charley quietly opens up to him once William recovers.  William's car has been stripped in the desert and he is invited to live with the family until the car is restored.Each of the family members is changed by William's presence, but none more than William himself who undergoes an epiphany viewing the Sangre de Cristo mountains approach sunset: William forsakes his previous life, begins to paint with watercolors George had intended for Charley as a therapeutic venture, and informs Arlene that he has fallen in love with her.  The entire group influence each other's lives and the manner in which this happens is such rare magic that saying more in a review would be unfair to those who have yet to experience this film.The entire cast is absolutely superb, so much so that it is impossible to name the Star: Sam Elliott, Joan Allen, Valentina de Angelis, Jim True-Frost, and JK Simmons  give stunning performances, the quality of acting that takes full advantage of silences, body language, probing into the characters, and most important - understanding the importance of ensemble acting.

Beautiful scenery, huge horizons, no electricity or indoor plumbing, and a kid who wants nothing more than to be taken away from all that. Enter William Gibbs, the IRS man from Albuquerque who wants to find out why the Grodens have not filed for seven years.  His first vision -- the right word -- is Mom (Joan Allen) gardening naked and so entranced is he that he lets a spider bite him.  Many complications, often happy, almost always wryly humorous, ensue.Adapted from a play, and sometimes a bit stagey, Off the Map is entertaining, intelligent, profoundly human and well-acted.

912276,A9TG2NFA614S9,B0009S4J1O,John F. Rooney,"[1, 1]","""Off the Map"" (2005) is a strange but very affecting story. Those desert landscapes and that beautiful house will live on in my memory. The house has a thrown-together and homemade look, but it is a very beautiful house, beautifully decorated with probably found stuff, with open windows and an airy feeling. It's located at an isolated locale in the arid land, and there live a free-thinking family of three. The father (played by Sam Elliott) is going through a bad period of depression and is almost catatonic. The mother (Joan Allen), kind, loving and patient is raising and home-teaching an eleven-year-old girl, Bo Groden, of independence and with spirit, a basically happy child, but one who wants a credit card. The family live hand-to-mouth, and have canned enough food to last for years.A screwed-up I.R.S. agent comes stumbling out of the desert, not in good shape after abandoning his car and walking for miles. He gets stung by a bee, has a bad reaction, and has to stay on for a bit; the bit turns out to be years. The father owes back taxes, but the agent more or less forgets about that. The ex-agent starts painting desert scenes and later becomes a sought-after artist whose work is worth a great deal of money.The family friend, played by J. K. Simmons with great skill and empathy, is very helpful and almost a member of the clan.It's an off-beat family and their former IRS agent who go through life listening to a different, more liberating drummer. Everyone in the movie seems so nice and good that you feel as if you're watching people from another galaxy. At times the mother and father walk around in the nude, and nobody cares.It's a quiet, low-key movie with a strong story line that has a great deal to teach about living a simpler existence. It's a story that blankets you and comforts you with good characterization and acting. The mother stands out as a strong person with quiet determination.

Bernabo,"[4, 6]","When you see ""Off the Map"" it is hard to believe this was originally a play because the landscape of northern New Mexico is so integral to Campbell Scott's film.  Playwright Joan Ackerman did the screenplay as well, and I know that ""Off the Map"" has been performed on stage in places like Chicago, but I cannot get my mind past the idea of in being performed at the Adobe Theater in Corrales, New Mexico, where the landscape that is at the heart of the story is around you, or at least only a few miles away.  It only makes sense that in something called ""Off the Map,"" the place is of prime importance.""Off the Map"" is a memory play, as Adult Bo (Amy Brenneman) recalls when she was Young Bo (Valentina de Angelis) and an I.R.S. agent came to visit her family's home in an abode house out in the middle of nowhere.  With neither power nor running water Bo's family grows their own vegetables and sometime check out the local dump to see what is available.  Since their only income is $320 a month in Veterans benefits, they have not done their taxes for seven years.  So the I.R.S. has dispatched young William Gibbs (Jim True-Frost) to investigate, and after several days of driving along dirt roads his car breaks down and he finally stumbles across them.What he finds is Arlene (Joan Allen) standing naked in her garden, at which point he is stung by a bee and becomes ill.  Arlene takes care of him, having long ago gotten used to taking care of her husband Charley (Sam Elliott), who suffers from depression.  For the most part Charley cries or does nothing, and seeing Sam Elliott reduced to a piece of furniture is unsettling indeed.  It has been years, but since Bo is relating this part of her story we suspect that something might happen to shake Charley out of his lethargy.  Then again, maybe not, because it is the character of William Gibbs who is the key catalyst here.William recovers and announces his love for Arlene, whose response to the declaration is to simply say, ""That's nice.""  This is key to understanding her character because Arlene accepts things.  How else do we explain her interactions with her husband, the threats of the I.R.S., and William's decision not to leave?  But William is not only enamored with Arlene, he is sick and tired of his job, which is not what he wants to do with his life.  Then he picks up a paintbrush and the next thing we know Bo's room is decorated with a massive watercolor, 3 feet high and 41 feet long, wherein the earth meets the sky.  Meanwhile, Bo sends an interesting array of letters off into the world trying to provoke a response that gives proof to her own existence and her ability to matter in the world.I think Joan Allen is going to win the Oscar next year for her performance in ""The Upside of Anger,"" not just because it is a great performance but also because I think she is probably the second most admired actress in Hollywood after Meryl Streep.  I believe she has the same reservoir of respect that propelled Morgan Freeman to this Oscar win last year, and ""Off the Map"" is one of the build blocks in her richly deserved reputation.  Her Arlene is a portrait of restraint in so many ways that it takes you a while to catch on that there is a reason that she is not doing more and a key to the rationale for how she keeps her family together in the middle of no where.This is an ensemble piece and Allen is the anchor for that ensemble, with de Angelis (in her film debut), providing what little spark there is in the film.  This is not meant as a disparagement because ""Off the Map"" is a low-keyed film whose snail pace will undoubtedly drive some viewers to distraction.  But the pace is appropriate because this is ultimately a film about small things.  Maybe you just have to have lived out on the edge of a mesa, where coyotes catch rabbits on your front lawn from time to time and in some directions there is not another soul to be found for many a mile, to appreciate the tempo.  Final Note: I do not remember the name of the artist who did the artwork done by William in the film, but they did a really nice job with their watercolors, because I had no problem accepting that people would find them collectible.",5,An IRS agent becomes a painter when he lands off the map,1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,4202,"['When', 'see', 'Map', 'hard', 'believe', 'was', 'originally', 'play', 'landscape', 'northern', 'New', 'Mexico', 'so', 'integral', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'film', 'Playwright', 'Joan', 'Ackerman', 'did', 'screenplay', 'as', 'well', 'know', 'Map', 'been', 'performed', 'stage', 'places', 'Chicago', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'mind', 'idea', 'being', 'performed', 'Adobe', 'Theater', 'Corrales', 'New', 'Mexico', 'where', 'landscape', 'heart', 'story', 'least', 'only', 'few', 'miles', 'away', 'only', 'sense', 'something', 'called', 'Map', 'place', 'prime', 'importance', 'Map', 'memory', 'play', 'Adult', 'Bo', 'Amy', 'Brenneman', 'when', 'was', 'Young', 'Bo', 'Valentina', 'de', 'Angelis', 'I.R.S', 'agent', 'came', 'visit', 'family', 'home', 'abode', 'house', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'power', 'running', 'water', 'Bo', 'family', 'own', 'vegetables', 'sometime', 'check', 'out', 'local', 'dump', 'see', 'what', 'available', 'only', 'income', '320', 'month', 'Veterans', 'benefits', 'have', 'not', 'done', 'taxes', 'seven', 'years', 'I.R.S', 'dispatched', 'young', 'William', 'Gibbs', 'Jim', 'True-Frost', 'investigate', 'several', 'days', 'driving', 'along', 'dirt', 'car', 'breaks', 'down', 'finally', 'Arlene', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'standing', 'naked', 'garden', 'point', 'stung', 'bee', 'ill.', 'Arlene', 'care', 'having', 'long', 'ago', 'gotten', 'used', 'taking', 'care', 'husband', 'Charley', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'who', 'depression', 'most', 'part', 'Charley', 'cries', 'nothing', 'seeing', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'reduced', 'piece', 'furniture', 'unsettling', 'indeed', 'been', 'years', 'Bo', 'relating', 'part', 'story', 'suspect', 'something', 'might', 'happen', 'shake', 'Charley', 'lethargy', 'Then', 'again', 'maybe', 'not', 'character', 'William', 'Gibbs', 'who', 'key', 'catalyst', 'here.William', 'recovers', 'love', 'Arlene', 'response', 'declaration', 'simply', 'say', 'nice', 'key', 'understanding', 'character', 'Arlene', 'things', 'How', 'else', 'do', 'explain', 'interactions', 'husband', 'threats', 'I.R.S.', 'William', 'decision', 'not', 'leave', 'William', 'not', 'only', 'enamored', 'Arlene', 'sick', 'tired', 'job', 'not', 'what', 'do', 'life', 'Then', 'up', 'paintbrush', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'Bo', 'room', 'decorated', 'massive', 'watercolor', '3', 'feet', 'high', '41', 'feet', 'long', 'wherein', 'earth', 'sky', 'Meanwhile', 'Bo', 'interesting', 'array', 'letters', 'world', 'trying', 'provoke', 'response', 'proof', 'own', 'existence', 'ability', 'matter', 'world.I', 'think', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'going', 'win', 'Oscar', 'next', 'year', 'performance', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'not', 'just', 'great', 'performance', 'also', 'think', 'probably', 'second', 'most', 'admired', 'actress', 'Hollywood', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'believe', 'same', 'reservoir', 'respect', 'propelled', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Oscar', 'win', 'last', 'year', 'Map', 'one', 'build', 'blocks', 'richly', 'deserved', 'reputation', 'Arlene', 'portrait', 'restraint', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'while', 'catch', 'reason', 'not', 'doing', 'more', 'key', 'rationale', 'how', 'family', 'together', 'middle', 'where.This', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'Allen', 'anchor', 'ensemble', 'de', 'Angelis', 'film', 'debut', 'providing', 'what', 'little', 'spark', 'film', 'not', 'meant', 'disparagement', 'Map', 'low-keyed', 'film', 'snail', 'pace', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'drive', 'viewers', 'distraction', 'pace', 'appropriate', 'ultimately', 'film', 'small', 'things', 'Maybe', 'just', 'have', 'have', 'lived', 'out', 'edge', 'mesa', 'where', 'coyotes', 'catch', 'rabbits', 'front', 'lawn', 'time', 'time', 'directions', 'not', 'soul', 'be', 'found', 'many', 'mile', 'appreciate', 'tempo', 'Final', 'Note', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'name', 'artist', 'who', 'did', 'artwork', 'done', 'William', 'film', 'did', 'really', 'nice', 'job', 'watercolors', 'had', 'problem', 'accepting', 'people', 'would', 'find', 'collectible']",N/A

He was on cable's ""The Wire"" for six years as well as coming back for Campbell's ""Company Retreat.""  He hit all the levels for me from the uncertain to the smitten and included realizations about his childhood as he delved into tears.  This was a star performance.Joan Allen is already a star with three Oscar nominations for ""The Contender,"" ""The Crucible"" & ""Nixon.""  She does a wonderful job in the film as Arlene.  With a husband suffering from severe depression and a child who is growing up all too rapidly, she seems to accept life as it comes.  Allen has this saucy irreverence, well reflected in her masterful performance inThe Upside of Angerfor which she won a Best Actress award from the Chicago Film Critics Association.  In Arlene, the quality shines through a veneer of earth mother peacefulness.Sam Elliott was recently inThe Golden Compass (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition).  His rugged good looks & demeanor often cast him as a strong, emotionally secure character.  As Charley in this film, he is in the midst of a severe depression.  Elliott's internal work for the character is impressive.  I really appreciated when he comes out of his funk and gives Allen a sensual foot massage.J.K. Simmons has worked A LOT!  From the sassy newspaper editor in the Spiderman films toJuno (Single-Disc Edition)to appearances on cable TV's ""The Closer,"" his is a face you know you've seen.  He seems a bit simple as Charley's friend George, but willing to do anything as a good friend.  To my great disappointment, the DVD I rented skipped a bit just after Charley dowses George with beer and then wrestles him to the floor.  I wasn't quite sure how that one scene concluded.  (Comments? :)Amy Brenneman from TV's ""Judging Amy"" has a small cameo as the adult Bo.  The young Bo who inhabits most of the film is played by newcomer Valentina de Angelis.  Taking as much free reign as permissive parents might give, she complains about defective products to manufacturers to get free samples, examines George's checks, calls into the I.R.S. for William when a bee sting sidelines him, and then orders a $4,000 boat on a credit card for which she qualified through the mail.  She would be a handful to most parents, but in the New Mexico desert seems to bloom as a free spirit.The photography is lovely.  The film is good but perhaps doesn't climax as well in the film version.  I assume the climax is William Gibbs' demise, but it is rather understated, even though it is a turning point in these characters' lives.  I found the featurette less than illuminating.  For example at one point Joan Allen explains that at this point in the film she wants William to hand her a wrench, as if that weren't obvious.  The painted desert of New Mexico is gorgeous.  The audience at the Sarasota Film Festival voted ""Off the Map"" as their favorite.  It is a lovely small film, well worth an evening's entertainment.

912282,ABF9TML1GLCJ6,B0009S4J1O,Luca,"[39, 42]","The gentle rhythm of the movie is a gesture that penetrates the mysterious glow of nature with intense wisdom. I cannot recommend this movie enough. Director Campbell Scott accentuates the poetry of nature through a stark depiction of a land stripped of human adulteration. The movie is an adaptation of Joan Ackerman's play that centers on the isolated Groden family, Arlene (Joan Allen), Charley (Sam Elliott), and their precocious daughter Bo (Valentina de Angelis) who live in a state of depressed civilization, an abode that is under a spell of an involuted economy where money is but an afterthought and nature the true protagonist. The Groden family has no phone, no running water, no tv, and no neighbors aside from coyotes and bears, both of which end up dead in a ritual of nature that will have you transcend the usual materialist self-serving appropriation of the symbiotic aggregates of life. Survival is more of an internal issue for the family rather than an economic one. Civilization seems to have been dismissed in favor of a love for their landscape and the appeal of a spiritual dynamism that has yet to be ""put on the map"" by the commercial prints of the ""world"".One day a hapless IRS agent, William Gibbs (Jim True-Frost), arrives at their house for an auditing, issued by the government, for the Grodens had not filed in seven years. A Massachusetts native who has transfer to Albaquerque and adopted a new profession, which has buried him deeper into the symptoms that distinguish a cog in the wheel of our civilized machine. The agent will become enchanted with the lifestyle, the landscape and the bewitching simplicity that nestles the Grodens everyday existence. He will end up staying with the family sucked by the aridity of cares that seem to barter with his ease of consciousness and habitual indifference.The New Mexico desert offers a contemplative universe to the IRS agent who, betaken by Arlene's beauty and the mystical flux of her spiritual transparency, becomes invested by an artistic bent that will alleviate the economic strains the Grodens are about to suffer due to the penalties they incur for neglect to file their taxes. The mesmerism and the intimacy of their simplicity is fraught with an evocative sterility that has beset the head of the household, Charlie, who suffers a deep-rooted depression that will haunt him for half a year. This is the most interesting aspect of the movie. Charlie will detain his energy and become insignificant to the family he had been an ingenious resourceful maverick to.  He was the intelligence which had allowed for such a dissident lifestyle to work, while Arlene was the soul that fitted such a naked world. The arrival of the IRS agent signals a movement away from the grieving for the void that surrounds Charlie and a return to celebrate the beauty that this same void elicits.Bo is an insouciant, eloquent, witty, imaginative, young and dazzling virago that prowls about the story as years removed she piques her memory to disinter the events of the summer when her dad was suffering from such a depression. She narrates from different angles devolving into her return to her family's home at the conclusion of the movie, the setting of her reminiscing journey. The narrative does not offer a rush of action, but it does deliberate and exhilarate through the languid force of a natural mysteriousness, all aglow, illusive and compelling, abounding in its raw powers and contagion, we are absorbed by a dramatization where consciousness seems to be but the infusion, the curving point where the horizon swallows our vision as it dissipates: the vanishing point where humans become but the best interpretive agency that draws boundaries between life and death unaware of its transcendental beauty.Watch it and own it so that you may be delighted by repeated viewings. The layers of meanings are prodigious and profound. This movie succeeds in animating what great novels do in several hundred pages. It gives life to the dynamism of nature, lyrically startles and emotionally it reaches for a wasteland where desires are anchored in a barren immense.",5,"Enchanting, mesmerizing, spiritually intense",1217289600,"07 29, 2008",2008,4139,"['gentle', 'rhythm', 'movie', 'gesture', 'mysterious', 'glow', 'nature', 'intense', 'wisdom', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'enough', 'Director', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'poetry', 'nature', 'stark', 'depiction', 'land', 'stripped', 'human', 'adulteration', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Joan', 'Ackerman', 'play', 'isolated', 'Groden', 'family', 'Arlene', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'Charley', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'precocious', 'daughter', 'Bo', 'Valentina', 'de', 'Angelis', 'who', 'live', 'state', 'depressed', 'civilization', 'abode', 'spell', 'involuted', 'economy', 'where', 'money', 'afterthought', 'nature', 'true', 'protagonist', 'Groden', 'family', 'phone', 'running', 'water', 'tv', 'neighbors', 'aside', 'coyotes', 'bears', 'end', 'up', 'dead', 'ritual', 'nature', 'will', 'have', 'transcend', 'usual', 'materialist', 'self-serving', 'appropriation', 'symbiotic', 'aggregates', 'life', 'Survival', 'more', 'internal', 'issue', 'family', 'rather', 'economic', 'one', 'Civilization', 'have', 'been', 'dismissed', 'favor', 'love', 'landscape', 'appeal', 'spiritual', 'dynamism', 'yet', 'be', 'put', 'map', 'commercial', 'prints', 'world', '.One', 'day', 'hapless', 'IRS', 'agent', 'William', 'Gibbs', 'Jim', 'True-Frost', 'house', 'auditing', 'issued', 'government', 'Grodens', 'had', 'not', 'filed', 'seven', 'years', 'Massachusetts', 'native', 'who', 'transfer', 'Albaquerque', 'adopted', 'new', 'profession', 'buried', 'deeper', 'symptoms', 'distinguish', 'cog', 'wheel', 'civilized', 'machine', 'agent', 'will', 'become', 'enchanted', 'lifestyle', 'landscape', 'bewitching', 'simplicity', 'Grodens', 'everyday', 'existence', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'staying', 'family', 'sucked', 'aridity', 'cares', 'seem', 'barter', 'ease', 'consciousness', 'habitual', 'indifference.The', 'New', 'Mexico', 'desert', 'contemplative', 'universe', 'IRS', 'agent', 'who', 'betaken', 'Arlene', 'beauty', 'mystical', 'flux', 'spiritual', 'transparency', 'becomes', 'invested', 'artistic', 'bent', 'will', 'alleviate', 'economic', 'Grodens', 'are', 'suffer', 'due', 'penalties', 'incur', 'neglect', 'file', 'taxes', 'mesmerism', 'intimacy', 'simplicity', 'fraught', 'evocative', 'sterility', 'beset', 'head', 'household', 'Charlie', 'who', 'deep-rooted', 'depression', 'will', 'haunt', 'year', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'movie', 'Charlie', 'will', 'detain', 'energy', 'become', 'insignificant', 'family', 'had', 'been', 'ingenious', 'resourceful', 'maverick', 'was', 'intelligence', 'had', 'allowed', 'such', 'dissident', 'lifestyle', 'work', 'Arlene', 'was', 'soul', 'fitted', 'naked', 'world', 'arrival', 'IRS', 'agent', 'signals', 'movement', 'away', 'grieving', 'void', 'Charlie', 'return', 'celebrate', 'beauty', 'same', 'void', 'elicits.Bo', 'insouciant', 'eloquent', 'witty', 'imaginative', 'young', 'dazzling', 'virago', 'story', 'years', 'removed', 'memory', 'disinter', 'events', 'summer', 'when', 'dad', 'was', 'suffering', 'such', 'depression', 'different', 'angles', 'devolving', 'return', 'family', 'home', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'setting', 'reminiscing', 'journey', 'narrative', 'not', 'offer', 'rush', 'action', 'deliberate', 'exhilarate', 'languid', 'force', 'natural', 'mysteriousness', 'aglow', 'illusive', 'compelling', 'abounding', 'raw', 'powers', 'contagion', 'are', 'absorbed', 'dramatization', 'where', 'consciousness', 'be', 'infusion', 'curving', 'point', 'where', 'horizon', 'vision', 'vanishing', 'point', 'where', 'become', 'best', 'interpretive', 'agency', 'boundaries', 'life', 'death', 'unaware', 'transcendental', 'beauty.Watch', 'own', 'so', 'may', 'be', 'delighted', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'layers', 'meanings', 'are', 'prodigious', 'profound', 'movie', 'animating', 'what', 'great', 'novels', 'do', 'several', 'hundred', 'pages', 'life', 'dynamism', 'nature', 'lyrically', 'startles', 'emotionally', 'wasteland', 'where', 'desires', 'are', 'anchored', 'barren', 'immense']",N/A

Instead it is just constantly there, quietly reminding us of how much we have lost, in terms of connecting to nature and to ourselves. The folks who wonder what admirers love about the film see it as conrived and trite, and there is some of that.  But it works. Partly because of the acting, which is excellent, and partly because it does not offer easy epiphanies or resolutions. The good things that come to the characters are hard earned. The things that matter most are indeed precarious.  The power of the film comes from realizing how easily things are lost and how hard they are to gain. Looking back in time at her life at 12, the older version of the little girl sees beauty that eluded her then, when she was often bored and quite understandably wanted to escape to a more peopled landscape.

An 11 year old girl (Bo, played by Valentina de Angelis) is being home schooled by her parents in the simplest of homes... no water, phone, nor electricity.  They live four miles from the nearest road, and survive for the most part on what they grow and hunt, and they work with a bartering and trading economy. However, the father (Charley, played by Sam Elliott) is now suffering a crippling depression, and the mother (Arlene played by Joan Allen) has reached the limits of what she can do.  This status quo is changed when an awkward IRS agent (Jim True-Frost) shows up to see why they haven't submitted any tax forms for the past seven years.  As it turns out, this visit precipitates a series of actions that profoundly affect this family.The location is New Mexico, and you won't see many additional homes, cars, people, or appliances.  There are no fast food restaurants or soft drink companies paying money to the producers for product visibility in this movie.  Even the few beers consumed don't shout their brand names.The actors are very, very well chosen and paired with their respective characters.  Suffice it to say that the actors BECOME the characters.  The opposite of this would be, say, Arnold the Governator becoming a teacher in Kindergarten Cop (brrrrrrr).Finally, the director puts it all together in a simple tapestry of sets, lighting, minimalist dialogue, and action.

But we had rented it, so we didn't have a copy to watch again.  I recently bought it, so we were able to watch it again, and what a surprise we were in for--this film that we already liked was so much better the second time, when we were already familiar with the story.  The second time through, we were able to see so much more depth and love and compassion in this film, and my wife and I are pretty sure it won't be another ten years before we see it again.At its core, it seems to me to be a film about acceptance, about loving people unconditionally, no matter how they may be acting.  Nothing is forced here, there are no trite clich&eacute;s, there are no amazing moments of epiphany--we see five people living their lives and caring for and about each other.  Valentina de Angelis gives an incredible performance as Bo, but all of the performances are above average.If you like films with tons of action, this isn't for you.  If you like films that take their time to develop and that explore the depths of characters rather than just their surfaces, a film that has the patience to allow the story to develop, then there's a good chance that you'll enjoy this movie.

The direction is elegant, with poignant pauses that allow the furniture to creak dialogue, the desert's army of owls and coyotes to offer chorus. 1974, Korean war vet Sam Elliot, a very Sam Shepard inspired character, who is the mold for individualism and self-sufficiency, lives in a humble but radiant cabin in the high desert north of Taos with his wife and daughter. During the summer the film is set in, his precocious, charming and near criminally brilliant 11 year old daughter, Bo, begins what is to become the narrative diary that carries you through her fathers unexpected slip into clinical depression. Her mother, Joan Allen, is a full blooded Hopi Indian and a naturalist of sorts, auto mechanic, gardener, hunter, gatherer, who teaches reading to convicted felons, and herself the voice of nightly readings to the family by oil lamp from Two Years Before the Mast. She tries to keep the family in check on less than $5000. annual income and help her husband through this draining ordeal, when suddenly they receive notice that the IRS will audit them for not paying taxes for 7 years. The IRS agent arrives and never leaves. He falls victim to, at first, a hornet sting that has him fevered for days. His own demons surface, having as a child discovered his mothers suicide by hanging in the front hall of his Brookline MA home andte weight of his self-imposed responsibility. On the road to recovery, he falls in love with Joan Allen, as we all do, and the love between all characters is simply amazing to observe. There is much more to life than working and paying taxes. The child, Bo, steals the show from an outstanding cast, a surreally serene setting, a scrumptious script, a soundtrack that sounds like Calexico or Friends of Dean Martinez, blended with The Delfonics, Billy Paul, Cliff Noble and Nixon's brilliantly placed resignation speech. Indian mysticism, White man's futility, peoples compassion and unbridled desire to experience are the underlying rhythms. The way in which the characters work their own way out of their personal traps is an inspiration.

912294,A2NVQZ4Y7Y0J1R,B0009S4J1O,Traveler,"[56, 60]","""Off the Map"" reminded me a bit of ""Lost in Translation.""  The stories are completely different, of course.  But there is a similarity in tone and texture.  Both movies are more interested in showing the audience how their characters change and evolve than in advancing a traditional plot with a conflict and resolution.  Some people who disliked ""Lost"" might like ""Off the Map.""  However, I'm almost certain that anyone who did like ""Lost"" will find this movie as equally enjoyable.The plot of this movie has been written about several times here so I won't repeat most of it.  Briefly, it's about a family of three, two parents and a young girl, who live in a secluded house in New Mexico (no running water, no electricity) and live on less than $5000 a year, who are visited by a young inexperienced IRS agent.  The story is about how they all change as their lives intertwine in the midst of the beauty of the New Mexico high desert.New Mexico in itself is a character in this movie.  I briefly lived in Santa Fe and I completely related to the IRS agent's feeling of awe and inspiration.  Unlike some other viewers, however, I felt that the movie failed to convey some of the majesty of the region.  In one of the extras on the DVD the producers talked about how they didn't want to make the scenery ""too beautiful,"" as if it were some form of tourism porno.  Perhaps the problem is that I saw the movie on the small screen and not the theater because it seemed to me that they went too far in the other direction.  I have stood in the desert, like the IRS agent, and felt overwhelmed and inspired.  I understood the character's reaction, but didn't really see why he was reacting the way he did within the context of what they were showing in the movie.Which brings me to one of the best moments in the movie.  The IRS agent thinks he's in love with Arlene, the mother, who appears to be mildly amused by his attention.  There's a key moment when ""Map"" shifts into gear as the agent gazes upon the New Mexico scenery as the sexy song ""Mrs. Jones"" plays on the radio.  As the producers commented, in another movie this would be the moment that the affair began, not smoldered and blew out.The acting throughout  is human and true.  There's not a weak performance in the entire movie.""Off the Map"" won't be the most exciting movie you've ever watched.  But it is a rewarding experience that shows you just how good the movies can be, despite all the cliche tripe that passes for entertainment at the multiplex.(Note: If you crave more I recommend the book ""The Handyman"" by Carolyn See.  ""Map"" borrows a few key elements from the book which tells the story of a young artist and how he changes people's lives as he works as a Mr. Fix It in southern California.  It's not as good as this movie (surprisingly), but it does continue the story of art, contemplation and changing people's perspectives on the world.)",5,"Slow, easy, spiritual, contemplative.
