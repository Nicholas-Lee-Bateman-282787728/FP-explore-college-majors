1220350,A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST,B001NMT8WA,Best Of All,"[11, 11]","The ESPN special that aired nationally on December 13, 2008, was a fabulous walk onto a gridiron of dreams and the piecing together of an incredible historical moment for professional football.In cooperation with NFL Films, ESPN Films produced this special look back on the 1958 NFL Championship, which was captured in overtime by the visiting Baltimore Colts over the New York Giants, 23-17, in the cavernous Yankee Stadium, with a powerful one-yard run by fullback Alan Ameche.Utilizing a number of sources for film, NFL Films essentially rebuilt the game; it was mastered for HD and digitally colored. Host Chris Berman fills in the gaps in the play and smartly tackles the task in a low-key, serious approach.For additional commentary, players from the contest are teamed with players from the recent Super Bowl championship squads of the Giants and Indianapolis Colts. Colts legend Art Donovan and the recently retired Giants great Michael Strahan steal those segments through solid takes and allowing their great personalities to reach paydirt.Kickers Pat Summerall and Adam Vinatieri - another Giants-Colts pairing - provide valuable insight on this often overlooked specialty. The excitement and appreciation for the game shows with cerebral Colts coach Tony Dungy and the vivid details from radio announcer Bob Woolf is worth the price of admission.A fascinating look into the science of measuring a first down from a half-century ago is explained through a controversial run by Frank Gifford, as the Giants failed to put the game on ice as the clock ticked down to the closing minutes. In the melee - which included a delay due to Colt defensive end Gino Marchetti breaking his leg - allegations flew from the Giants that the football was moved back by a Colt player or the spot was incorrect by officials. Technology definitely answers the questions surrounding the play.An estimated 45 million people watched the game on TV, but it was blacked out in the greater New York City area because it was not sold out. And if a pulled plug wasn't fixed in a unique way during overtime, NBC may have had a mess of ""Heidi Bowl"" proportions.Summerall joked about the number of people who have told him that they attended the game. Through this DVD, future generations will have a real cozy seat for one grand slam of a duel on the frozen tundra in ""The House That Ruth Built.""",5,A Fitting Tribute to the Gladiators of the Gridiron,1229212800,"12 14, 2008",2008,2377,"['ESPN', 'special', 'aired', 'nationally', 'December', '13', '2008', 'was', 'fabulous', 'walk', 'gridiron', 'dreams', 'piecing', 'together', 'incredible', 'historical', 'moment', 'professional', 'football.In', 'cooperation', 'NFL', 'Films', 'ESPN', 'Films', 'produced', 'special', 'look', 'back', '1958', 'NFL', 'Championship', 'was', 'captured', 'overtime', 'visiting', 'Baltimore', 'Colts', 'New', 'York', 'Giants', '23-17', 'cavernous', 'Yankee', 'Stadium', 'powerful', 'one-yard', 'run', 'fullback', 'Alan', 'Ameche.Utilizing', 'number', 'sources', 'film', 'NFL', 'Films', 'essentially', 'rebuilt', 'game', 'was', 'mastered', 'HD', 'digitally', 'colored', 'Host', 'Chris', 'Berman', 'gaps', 'play', 'smartly', 'task', 'low-key', 'serious', 'approach.For', 'additional', 'commentary', 'players', 'contest', 'are', 'teamed', 'players', 'recent', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'championship', 'squads', 'Giants', 'Indianapolis', 'Colts', 'Colts', 'legend', 'Art', 'Donovan', 'recently', 'retired', 'Giants', 'great', 'Michael', 'Strahan', 'steal', 'segments', 'solid', 'allowing', 'great', 'personalities', 'reach', 'paydirt.Kickers', 'Pat', 'Summerall', 'Adam', 'Vinatieri', 'Giants-Colts', 'pairing', 'provide', 'valuable', 'insight', 'often', 'overlooked', 'specialty', 'excitement', 'appreciation', 'game', 'cerebral', 'Colts', 'coach', 'Tony', 'Dungy', 'vivid', 'details', 'radio', 'announcer', 'Bob', 'Woolf', 'price', 'admission.A', 'fascinating', 'look', 'science', 'measuring', 'first', 'down', 'half-century', 'ago', 'explained', 'controversial', 'run', 'Frank', 'Gifford', 'Giants', 'failed', 'put', 'game', 'ice', 'clock', 'ticked', 'down', 'closing', 'minutes', 'melee', 'included', 'delay', 'due', 'Colt', 'defensive', 'end', 'Gino', 'Marchetti', 'breaking', 'leg', 'allegations', 'flew', 'Giants', 'football', 'was', 'moved', 'back', 'Colt', 'player', 'spot', 'was', 'incorrect', 'officials', 'Technology', 'definitely', 'questions', 'surrounding', 'play.An', 'estimated', '45', 'million', 'people', 'watched', 'game', 'TV', 'was', 'blacked', 'out', 'greater', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'area', 'was', 'not', 'sold', 'out', 'pulled', 'plug', 'was', ""n't"", 'fixed', 'unique', 'way', 'overtime', 'NBC', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'mess', 'Heidi', 'Bowl', 'proportions.Summerall', 'joked', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'told', 'attended', 'game', 'DVD', 'future', 'generations', 'will', 'have', 'real', 'cozy', 'seat', 'one', 'grand', 'slam', 'duel', 'frozen', 'tundra', 'House', 'Ruth', 'Built']",The Greatest Game Ever Played
1220351,A2B2A1PIIKOLUJ,B001NMT8WA,D. Dutton,"[14, 16]","I was hoping that a definative epic would have been made to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the most famous single game in NFL history. Instead we got the INDY Colts? W H A T?ESPN had the 1958 players sitting with the modern Giants and Indy Colts talking about the game. Pat Sumerall and Adam Vinatieri was painful to watch as the connection simply could not be made. Why was it tried? This idea really needed to die in the first production meeting but somehow actually got carried out.Think how lame this will look in 5 years when Adam Vinatieri (the NE Patriot) somehow is linked to the Colts - Giants game of 1958. This was pitiful. (Yes he was a Colt at the time of production, but he will forever be remembered as a NE Patriot.)This illustrated how absurd it is to link the Indy Colts to the Baltimore Colts. Now that Indy has it's own Superbowl victory and legacy of great players, it no longer needs Baltimore's history. Jimmy Ersay should do the right thing and give Baltimore it's history back. The folks of Indy have never cared about the Baltimore Colts and still don't. According to the League, Gino Marchetti, Art Donovan, Lenny Moore, Johnny Unitas, Raymond Berry, Jim Parker, and John Mackey are all time Indianapolis Greats? Even the most die hard Indy fans acknowledge that this is S T U P I D !ESPN's Chris Berman seems to be a nice fellow. His jovial style is great for highlights and bloopers. As always Berman did a fine job. While Berman is impressive I believe another opportunity was lost here. Pat Sumerall would have been my 1st choice as this would bring together his legendary career as a Sportscaster and player. If not Sumerall, Sam Huff or Frank Gifford, who all starred in the game. (All are polished sportscasters).What was needed was the full NFL Films treatment. What we got was a ""trying to be hip"" hodge podge that did little justice to the importance and legacy of this game.Admittedly my expectations were probably set way too high as I was convinced that the 50th Anniversary (the last milestone anniversary that most of the players will see before they pass on) would have been the best. The 40th Anniversary NFL Films production with John Steadman, Johnny Sample, Raymond Berry, Pat Sumerall, Frank Gifford and Sam Huff was much better. It is included in the Colts History DVD set.(Baltimore Disk)The only reason this video gets even ONE STAR is they did settle the Gifford first down controversy. (Now with that settled...why did the Giants punt?)  Overall this video is a huge opportunity missed. Again the 40th Anniversary production remains the best account of this game.Hey NFL: Give Baltimore their history back, and next time leave the football documentaries to the folks that invented them...NFL Films.",1,Colts Giants 1958: ESPN?

Being a football fan starting in the early 1960's I saw some of these guys play on TV. I gave it only four stares because I think that there was maybe a bit too much talking. Most of the modern players seemed to have a difficult time relating to the football world of the past (There's a big shock). ""You mean you had to ger a job on the off season!?"" ""You made how much!?"" ""How could you play with no grass on the field?"" Nobody actually said these thing, but you know that's exactlly what they were thinking.
