Clearly Heidi Klum and Tim Gunn are developing their roles..to the point they are self aware of themselves as caricatures.The DVD: This DVD set for the first time has some bonuses including some outtakes and short docs of how some of the winners are doing.",3,Designers not as inspired those in the  previous two seasons.,1267920000,"03 7, 2010",2010,777,"['Contestants', 'technical', 'skills', 'contestants', 'seemed', 'generally', 'higher', 'previous', 'two', 'seasons', 'found', 'designers', 'seemed', 'less', 'inspired.A', 'lot', 'disgreeable', 'bland', 'contestants.The', 'First', 'Challenge', 'first', 'challenge', 'make', 'outfit', 'found', 'material', 'hotel', 'room', 'was', 'wasteful', 'ugly', 'disgusting.The', 'Production', 'did', ""n't"", 'revised', 'series', 'format', 'significant', 'amount', 'air', 'time', 'spent', 'recapping', 'previous', 'episodes', 'as', 'well', 'introducing', 'next', 'episode', 'Clearly', 'Heidi', 'Klum', 'Tim', 'Gunn', 'are', 'developing', 'roles..to', 'point', 'are', 'self', 'aware', 'caricatures.The', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'set', 'first', 'time', 'bonuses', 'including', 'outtakes', 'short', 'docs', 'how', 'winners', 'are', 'doing']",Project Runway: Season 3

Thanks to this season's designers, I actually enjoyed this season more than season 2. Some of the creative challenges include: creating an outfit made out of items found in the designer's living space; designing a gown for Miss USA in the Miss Universe Pageant; making matching outfits for a dog and its owner and creating a background story for the owner (actual dogs modeled the outfits on the runway!);  and one of my faves, using materials from a recycling plant in Jersey!Yes, there is some drama on this season (two designers accused of ""foul play"", one designer being rude to another's mother), but as before, the drama does not overtake the creativity that is this show's hallmark. Another wonderful thing about this show is how there is also a nice age range of the contestants (one of my faves is a 40-something mom of 5 children with another on the way during the show!).Extras on the DVD include:1. ""WEAR Are They Now?"" featurette: curiously, this time they eliminated one of the Project Runway Season 3 winners, with no explanation of why there is no update for the missing designer (I will not reveal the names so as not to spoil the series for anyone).2. ""WEAR Was He Then?: Tim Gunn, Making It Work"" featurette: a nice mini documentary on Gunn (can you believe this very formal guy was inspired by pop-up books as a kid?!?). Gunn definitely seems more human after watching this.3. Tim Gunn's Season 3 Blog: contains Gunn's commentary on the individual designers/episodes4. Designer Bios5.

I am SO glad that I was wrong!  I must say that Project Runway is a standout show from other reality shows.  The drama is there, but it's not over-done.  Heidi Klum and Tim Gunn really make the show worth watching.  I am now addicted to it and own the first two seasons (I'm waiting for the third one to arrive).  I didn't think I was into fashion, but it is the designing that really got me addicted.  I never knew just how much work goes into each piece of clothing!!

I love the various challenges each week and enjoy watching how the designers interpret their tasks.  I own all three sets of the series and highly recommend them - they are even fun to watch more than once!  You can see how each season this show gets better and better.  Season 4 is the best by far - more accomplished designers, more feedback from Tim Gunn, and constructive judging.  The judges may make some negative comments but I feel that they do not insult the contestants.  I like  the twists included in the show such as Season 3 allowing 4 contestants to go to Fashion Week and in Season 4 - a runoff between Romi and Chris to become the final member of the team to go to Fashion Week.  The challenges are becoming more interesting too - not so much with recycled garbage as in some earlier seasons.  This show is one of the best on TV - I'm addicted.  I encourage you to try it too!  You will love the boxed sets - no commercials.  I would like to see some bonus material included in the sets such as background on the designers, out-takes, and more comments on each  design.

1095436,A2Q543TN0328O1,B000UNYJT0,"Ramona ""Author of Dynamic Belly Dance""","[1, 1]","What I most enjoyed about Season 3 was the project to make a matching dog outfit to go with a ladies garment. I'm not a dog owner, but was very curious to see the outfits the contestants would sew up for these little dogs. Some of the outfits were cute, the dogs were all small-sized. Aside from that project, there were a number of other interesting projects, one of the most interesting was making outfits inspired by fashion icons (Cher, Katherine Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, etc.) There were some really beautiful outfits and some dreadful ones too. Also, for one of the competitions all of the contestants were flown to Paris, and it was interesting to see the scenes filmed there.One thing that I did not like about this season was the conflict between some of the contestants. I know that since this is a ""reality show"" that conflict and arguing is part of the formula, but I watch the show just to see the sewing and finished outfits, and I fast-forwarded through the arguements. Some people enjoy watching that kind of thing, but I could do without the conflicts, and I thought a lot of the personal conflicts should have been edited out so that we could see more of the sewing techniques the contestants were using. In this season, one of the contestants was disqualified when he was found violating rules, and a finalist was unjustly accused of violating rules but his name was cleared and he stayed in the competition. Those two parts were very relevant to the competition, but the personal conflicts and arguements were extraneous.Overall, I gave the show five stars because the filming was lovely and very entertaining, the show was very polished, the designers/contestants talking about their sewing was interesting, the runway shows were fun, there were some nice clothes (and some terrible ones too!). Tim Gunn is the mentor to the contestants, and he's got an utterly charming manner---very distinguished-looking and offers good opinions about works in progress.Finally, I thought that Season 4 was outstanding----and Season 3 was very good. With Season 4, in every episode I understood why a garment was judged and labelled as ""out"", and I could see why the ultimate prize-winner was selected over the other designers, and I saw more sewing details (which is my primary interest in the show). With Season 3, there were times that I couldn't see why a garment was selected as superior to the others, and I didn't understand the judges reasoning as to the ultimate prize winner. There were some beautiful clothes in this series, and I was gratified to see that one of the garments I liked the best won a competition near the end of the series. This show is so entertaining. If you like the ""reality show"" approach to fashion, you'll like Season 3. If you're more interested in sewing techniques, see Season 4.

Contestants have a design challenge each week, ranging from making clothing out of cast-off mail packaging to designing outfit for each others mothers to creating a look for a beauty queen. The worst designer is kicked off each week until there are three finalists who create collections to show in New York's Fashion Week.This season has a talented cast, each with their own very distinct styles and entertaining personalities. For example, there is Jeffrey, the tattooed, rock-and-roll oriented designer who has a rough past. Michael Knight has an affinity for designing for the female body. Laura is a classy, sophisticated mother of six. Kayne is a pageant designer who loves sparkle. Vincent is a designer who flourished in the 80s and is making a comeback to the field he loves.The personalities make the show, but the challenges are entertaining, the work the designers do is beautiful, and the judges always have something sharp to say. For anyone who loves the fashion world, and even for those who don't, this is a highly entertaining show, and a reality show in the true sense.

It learnt me the fact that in the fashion industry, designers are more brain (ideas)- driven and models are more physics (look)-driven. In order to become SOMEBODY in this business, you will just have to pair together! It is more collective output in order to brand yourself at the end.One of the comparisons i have been always thinking is Tyra Banks is all over America's Next Top Model, the whole program. It might not be the initial intention to set up her as the centre of the whole show (if so, then the show failed already), but the truth is she has that power/image to be the centre of the show, more than any models or judges over there.If you look at Project Runway, Hedi Klum is also the Host and one of the Judges, but you feel the show is really about those designers and their designs.
