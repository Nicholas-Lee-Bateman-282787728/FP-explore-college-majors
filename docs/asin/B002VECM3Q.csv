But, this movie is hamstrung by several factors:1.  Poor script/plot.  Pretty much every old ninja/martial arts cliche is brought back to life.  There are the requisite training scenes, the blood feud between the ninja and his old clan, etc.  In some ways, it reminded me of the movie Hunted, with Christopher Lambert.  I was hoping for a reinvention of the ninja genre that would breathe new life into it - this movie was far from it.2.  Poor special effects.  There seems to be a tendancy to use CGI for complex action sequences and blood splatter effects.  The problem with this is that it is really, really hard to make realistic blood splatter with CGI... most of the time it just looks like cartoon blood.  In addition, CGI generated weapons also have a habit of looking cartoony.  Part of the greatness of old martial arts movies was the fact that the actors really were doing what you saw on the screen... an element sorely missed in many scenes of this movie.Without a solid or interesting plot, this movie really needed strong visuals and amazing action sequences to hold the viewer's interest.

Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[2, 3]","Raizo (played by Rain), an orphan, was taken to a secret ninja training camp run by the Ozunu Clan when he was just a boy. After years of harsh, even deadly, training, Raizo was brought up to be the greatest ninja of the clan, even one who would one day take it over as leader.While a child and through his growing-up years, he befriends Kiriko (Anna Sawai) and she is just as strong-willed as he is except where he lacks feeling, she has a heart and doesn't agree with all the clan teaches. When Kiriko tries to escape, Raizo sees what it truly means to be a member of the Ozunu Clan and from then on follows his own path to take the clan down.Enlisting the help of a Europol agent, Mika Coretti (Naomie Harris), together they try and bring the clan to justice. However, not is all what it seems and the Ozunu Clan has plans of their own. Led by Raizo's brother, Takeshi (Rick Yune), the two are hunted, and only after the swords stop slicing and the blood cools will a victor be decided.This movie is hardcore, man. There's really no other word for it. Total and utter blood-soaked craziness that reminded me of Mortal Kombat (the game). I was just waiting for a low, ominous voice to say ""Fatality."" Awesome.The kung fu in this flick is intense, especially the swordplay. Those bladed fights were among some of the best I've seen, right up there with the stuff in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Rain looked brilliant, his body and demeanor as hard as steel. More than once was I reminded of Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon with the way he moved. The flashback sequences also worked well and really added to Raizo's back story and firmly cemented us in his psyche so we know why he fights the way he does, why he's on the path he's on, and what motivates him as a ninja. Well done.What I especially liked in this movie was the ninjas' mystique and their power, namely the part about them being one with the shadows and the paranoia those being hunted had with the dark. The idea of always keeping the lights on and bright was a great way to play this up. The ninja-morphing with the shadows was also cool, giving the impression that these guys, after all that training, have become something more than human.This is just one crazy bloodbath of a movie. Non-stop action. Amazing sword battles. Cool enough story to string one fight scene to the next.Ninja Assassin is the definition of a martial arts flick.Yeah, go check it out. Definitely.A.P.

1291969,A2PMQH87R1H3QU,B002VECM3Q,Benjamin Kidman,"[1, 3]","Ninja Assassin is certainly one of the most stylish Ninja movies ever made. The cinematography and soundtrack are awesome, capturing the shadowy, quick moving stereotype of these black clad martial arts experts with their swords, chains, flying stars, etc. And the blood and gore is almost off the scale as you see people sliced and diced. But behind all these extravagant action scenes is also a pretty good story, interesting script, and unexpectedly good acting, The story explains through flashbacks how these adult Ninja Assassins came to be - throw away street kids subsequently enslaved in an orphanage that serves as the martial arts training ground for Ninja clans. We meet the patriarch of this so called family, Ozunu (Sho Kosugi), who demands absolute loyalty, or death. Raizo (Rain), rebels, survives an escape, and becomes the outcast Ninja Ninja Assassin - interesting twist on the movie title. Throw in Naomie Harris as a targeted Europol agent who knows too much about the Ninja Assassin Clan, and then teams up with Raizo to bring the Clan down, the movie then shifts into a high action bloodbath. I was fascinated with the actor Rain - what a perfectly honed body and what great martial arts choreography. The other actor that really impressed me was Sho Kosugi, the chief villain, who was really scarily sinister. The brutality scenes of the kids training at the orphanage was eye-opening, and leaves more of an impression that the stylistic, almost cartoonish, adult action.

That said, it's a pretty fun action movie.The fight scenes are well choreographed and employ an excellent blood effect.  Every swipe, severing slice, or star seems to unleash a half-gallon of blood from the target and it looks great.

1291977,A3QNQQKJTL76H0,B002VECM3Q,buru buru piggu,"[1, 2]","Judging from the low score on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB, the negative buzz around this film when it came out, and Hollywood's generally bad track record with all films Asian (ahem...The Forbidden Kingdom,Dragonball: Evolution, Speed Racer), I was expecting to hate Ninja Assassin. I was surprised by the 4.5 average stars Amazon users gave it, but after having just seen this film, I must agree. Ninja Assassin is ninjaly goodness!Be warned, however, that it's not for everybody. If you don't like ninjas, violence, and fast-paced action sequences, please stop reading and look for another film. Brought to you by the same people who gave us the Matrix andV for Vendetta(producers Joel Silver & The Wachowski Brothers; director James McTeigue), this is one stylish film. It's hyper-kinetic, super-slick, and ultra-violent. The action scenes come fast and they come often. There's probably never more than 5 minutes of just dialogue or calm. If you're squeamish, definitely look for another film. Every battle scene is drenched in blood and littered with body parts. People get sliced in half, heads roll, and limbs go flying all over the place like confetti. It's a bloody, disgusting mess! And it's brilliant. People die in gruesome, graphic ways like inThe Final Destination [Blu-ray]. I caught myself wincing at some of the gore.Raizo, the main protagonist (played by Korean pop star Rain), is a member of a secretive mercenary ninja clan who through the centuries have carried out assassinations. He is a protege. As orphans, he and his clan siblings have been raised from childhood to be ruthless killing machines, emotionless, unseen, and impervious to pain. However, he has a good heart, and when tasked with executing a ninja for desertion, he betrays his master and is now hunted by his clan. The main theme in this film is obedience to one's duty vs. obedience to one's heart. There's also a minor thread of ninja sibling rivalry (like the terribleG.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra [Blu-ray]). The story is simple and well-trodden, but it's effectively and entertainingly presented, spaced out over time and sandwiched between the action sequences so there is never a lull for too long. Parts of the film reminded me ofL&eacute;on: The Professionalbecause of Raizo's unstoppable badness and protector role. Also worth noting is commanding screen presence of Ben Miles, who plays one of the Europol agents.Visually, the film is spectacular and the action sequences are fantastically over the top. Raizon's primary weapon is the kusarigama, a lethal swinging chain of pain. Parts of the film definitely look like a video game, especially theNinja Gaidenseries, due to the weapons similarities, copious decapitations/amputations, and even the ninja fight inside a burning dojo. The finale against his master is a boss fight, and the way it's filmed pays tribute to the samurai movie genre. I also spotted a bit ofChronicles of Riddickduring this sequence. You'll know what I mean when you see it.This film wasn't meant for a general audience, so I understand how it got killed at the box office.

There was a sudden boom a couple years ago whenHouse of Flying Daggers,Curse of the Golden Flower,Heroand many other great titles kept coming out. I love good Martial Arts movies whether it be due to great acting, superb visuals or simply intense action a good martial arts movie is always my first choice. Ninja Assassin is more of the later, non stop action, chaotic fighting and quite a lot of gore.The acting is decent in the current time parts but is excellent in the flashback's. The kid's do a great job making the viewer feel the extreme punishment that comes with the rigorous training of a Ninja. The plot moves quickly as to not stunt the excitement of each battle. It is the battles where this movie shines however. Extremely stylized and very unrealistic the fighting in NA comes off as brutal with a to-the-death feel as if you expect the main protagonist to die at any moment. The Ninja's come off as creatures more so then men and the quiet whispering in the shadow's was an eerie touch just before they attacked.All in all the plot was rather predictable but the insane action and chaotic fighting kept my interest. Watch it and decide for yourself but if your one whom requires intellectual dialog and a very tight and expertly crafted plot this movie is definitely not for you. This is one of those flicks you throw on after you've seen all the rest of your movies to many times for cheap thrills.

It's bloody, but even for me, who doesn't prefer gory bloody type movies, this was awesome!I think what made it so great was the main actor, Rain, and all of the stunt people involved.  The action sequences were superb.  They used people proficient in parquor, free running and acrobatics.  Almost all action sequences were done by real people, no wire work, no CG.  Just the human body.  I love ninja movies and this is by far one of the best ones that I have ever seen.Rain did almost all of his own stunt work except for a couple of scenes that involved cars.  He trained 6 hours a day for months to get into shape for this movie and it shows. His dedication is amazing.  He is totally ripped.  What you see, is what you get.  Phenomenal.  Absolutely phenomenal.The storyline is pretty good.  The other actors are pretty good.  The DVD extras are excellent.  It tells the story and history of ninjas. It tells the mythology of ninjas.

1292000,A3D3DJKKMLCRYZ,B002VECM3Q,"Erin ""skyblueboy""","[2, 10]","If you could use only one word to describe this movie, that would be it. That's not to say the movie is completely horrible. Rain is impressive in how much he dedicated himself physically to this role, and the martial arts action, for the most part, is pretty awesome. Most of the actors do their best with what's given to them.Where this movie fails, for the most part, is in the writing, both in terms of plot and dialogue. J Michael Straczynski was a hack when he was working on comic books and he is still. One reviewer here implies that people who don't like this movie will do so because they're a bunch of uptight philosophers who condemn anything that isn't full of deep, intellectual thought.The thing is though, even if you're not expecting the equivalent of Milton, that doesn't mean you have to be subjected to the same kind of brainless idiocy over and over again. This movie suffers from what I call philosophy for stupid people. It spouts the same moronic kind of thinking behind such phrases as ""pain is just weakness leaving the body"" or ""go big or go home.""Part of the reason for this thinking comes from stereotypical comic book geeks who get their ideas from pop culture and nothing else. Another part of it comes from the nature of martial arts philosophy itself. This shouldn't be taken to mean I hate either. I would not have watched this movie if that were the case.The problem with pop culture comes when you take mediocre pop culture and then copy it over and over until you have a pathetic copy of a pathetic original. The best pop culture either has some inspiration from something deeper and presents it in a simpler or different way, or it presents an original idea in a quality way, even ib a simpler form.This movie is full of the lousy dialogue and plot devices that have plagued movies since the 80s, at least. The visual effects that show how Ninjas blend into darkness have been done before. The twists are completely unoriginal.The use of ultra gore is cliched and only serves to try to hide the many shortcomings of the story.Which brings me to the issue of martial arts philosophy. Often, what works in reality is ruined by a lot of metaphysical, supernatural mumbo jumbo. The idea of being able to kill someone merely by lightly touching them or even by just ""projecting your chi"" out towards someone across the room to kill them is utter nonsense. The people who usually believe this are those who have never worked out a day of their life.These ideas become part of what's wrong with the plot of this show. The incredible parkour and loopkicks, the actual physical training that goes into honing real martial arts skill, is completely ruined by the ridiculous concepts of being able to do something beyond actual human ability.But this in itself isn't so much the problem, as is the inconsistent way it is presented. One moment, the main villain is training a child brutally, supposedly trying to teach him about enduring pain, or what real pain is. The next, he's standing out in the rain with an umbrella, apparently in fear of getting wet. Why isn't he able to endure the rain?Another time, they fight with realistic fighting skills. The next, this villain starts doing some idiotic disappearing act, only to reappear in order to kick the crap out of Rain's character.Rain gets a look of confusion on his face, as though he's wondering how his master is doing that, seemingly because it's a technique he never saw or was not taught. Then, suddenly, Rain is doing it himself!Again, you don't have to expect high brow, deep thinking in order to enjoy a movie. But if you can't think enough to realize what contradictory nonsense this is, you should really raise your standards a bit.It can no longer be acceptable to overlook poor plotting like this. I'm all for enjoying a movie for the action, but ignoring logic and consistency this much is just appalling.Anyway, take this review how you will. I'll sum things up and say, no, you don't have to be  a philosophy major to find fault with the stupidity found in this movie. The action is good, but it's not enough to save the movie from all its other faults.UPDATEA few of you are taking offense to my review. First, let me say, if you like this movie, keep liking it. I probably like a ton of movies that people think suck, but that's not going to change my enjoyment of them. A review is nothing more than an opinion and it's up to the reader to decide if they agree with it or not. I only ask that people keep an open mind and consider whether there's any validity in what's said.I try to be consistent in what I like and dislike. I get irritated with people who will condemn one thing for the same thing they praise in another thing. Such as when Roger Ebert says videogames aren't art but then praises absolutely pathetic movies that aren't anywhere near being artistic.So, to answer the question about which martial arts movies I enjoy, I'll give a brief list of the people who I think are at the top of the game. This does not mean their movies didn't suffer from plot issues or other things, but that they elevated the movies with their skills to the point where the movie's shortcomings weren't as painful.Anything with Bruce Lee, but especially the lost Game of Death footage (not the piece of crap that was thrown together after his death) and Return (Way) of the Dragon.Any later Donny Yen. I haven't actually seen a ton of his movies, but the early ones I did see were sped up. He's fast enough without needing to speed things up. Plus, when everyone is moving at a thousand miles per second, it just looks bad.Jackie Chan. He moved out of the shadow of people wanting to be the next Bruce Lee and showed he's the first Jackie Chan.David Belle. Taking it to the next level with the Parkour.Cyril Rafael: Another French guy with great skills.Michael Jai White. A big guy with great agility and decent speed.Scott Adkins. Similar to Michael but with more acrobatics.Tony Jaa: Awesome combination of TKD and Muay Thai as well as a few other styles. Another innovator.Mark Dacascos. The ultimate. A guy who is at least as fast as Bruce Lee, if not faster. He has real world fighting experience, having worked as a bouncer and being trained under his dad, Al, who trained for real world situations. He took acrobatics to a new level over Jackie Chan and was doing things that blows Tony Jaa away years prior. Someone who can do in months what others take years to do. He can do it all.There's more I can add but that should hopefully give people enough info to take issue with. =o)",1,STUPID,1311206400,"07 21, 2011",2011,6583,"['could', 'use', 'only', 'one', 'word',

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 3]","If you've come to this movie expecting an engrossing storyline, memorable acting, and ninja action, well, you'll get the ninja action and heaps of it. The title NINJA ASSASSIN pretty much sums up the movie. There be ninjas and they're assassinating all over the place. One sub-plot centers on an eager, out-of-her-depth forensic analyst for the Europol agency (Naomie Harris) as she stumbles onto the legendary Nine Clans, a clandestine affiliation of ninjas who down the centuries have stolen children and raised them as assassins. The Nine Clans having survived this long by existing primarily as a mere rumor, no way were they about to allow the forensic analyst to keep on digging. She's marked for assassination.The core story revolves around the orphan Raizo, brought up and trained mercilessly by the Ozunu Clan. In flashbacks we see Raizo as an intense child, then as a young man, an apt pupil and in fact the most promising of his generation. We learn what caused Raizo to ultimately defy the Ozunu Clan and to actively seek out the Clan's demise. But the odds are horrifying for Raizo; he eventually realizes he can't do this by himself. It's no real stretch to figure out that Raizo and the forensic analyst will team up. And that's pretty much it, the narrative framework which sets up all the frenetic action sequences.Martial arts buffs should get a kick out of this one. And, again, those with an eye for a meatier storyline and well-developed character arcs will just have to settle for plenty of ninjas assassinating. The story itself unfolds in predictable stages, and there's a pervasive mood that is dark and morose. Also bogging things down is a cryptic serving of hokum disguised as Eastern philosophy. The lead character lends himself to this bleak mood, Raizo being this taciturn dude plagued by his inner demons, driven by his need for revenge, and relentlessly hunted down by his former brethren. Thru Mika Coretti (the forensic analyst who Raizo claims has a ""special heart""), Raizo finally sees a means to an end. Sort of shameful is that Naomie Harris, who was so strong in28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)is here relegated to mere damsel in distress duties. Raizo is played by Korean pop star sensation Jeong ""Rain"" Ji-hoon, and big ups to his personal trainer, because dude is ridiculously ripped. His acting is so-so. It's probably not that hard playing a laconic action hero with a side order of brooding. But for sure Rain pulls off all the action scenes. Which, with this kind of movie, is really what matters. The treat for me, being a fan of 1980s martial arts flicks, is that Sh Kosugi has a featured role here, as Ozuni, the implacable ninja headmaster. Long live Sh Kosugi!The action is stylized and way brutal. Lots of viscera and rampant body part dismemberment, lots of blood spurting and gushing and fountaining. These are ninjas as they should be, wicked formidable and scary, emerging from the shadows like disgruntled wraiths. I'm pretty fond of the AMERICAN NINJA flicks back in the '80s, but, man, did they ever bastardize the ninja mythos. In AMERICAN NINJA 4: THE ANNIHILATION, I remember seeing packs of ninjas strutting around in bright colored outfits and in BROAD FRIGGIN' DAYLIGHT, and I cringe. In their shadowy element, the Ozunu Clan makes easy mincemeat of their victims, never mind that their targets are armed with hi-tech and modern weaponry. And because the ninja works best in the dark, at times the action sequences are hard to make out. But Raizo is marvelous to look at, especially when he's wreaking carnage with his wicked weapon of choice, the steel blade hook and chain (the kyoketsu shoge). Awesome weapon!NINJA ASSASSIN doesn't really show off a healthy sense of humor, although it flirts some with the absurd, but what it does offer in levity is very welcome, whether it's Raizo guessing a woman's wardrobe size or that exterior shot of the motel and the car parked outside it, with the car totally swiss-cheesed and bristling with flung shuriken. What made me laugh outloud, though, was when one Europol agent remarked that Raizo ""Looks like he belongs in a boy band."" Because in-jokes are always appreciated. I say go ahead and endure the labored narrative. The fight scenes are worth getting to, hellacious enough that they earn the movie a rating of 3.5 stars out of five from me.",4,meanest... orphanage...

Limbs flying, blood squirting, heads being lopped off faster than I could keep up with what might be happening next.  I guess if I can't even focus quickly enough to watch the action scenes there is not a chance in hell that I would ever be capable of Ninja like movements in real life.  Good thing that my only ambition is sitting and watching the gory mutilation versus learning to be an assassin in real life.Ninja Assassin takes on the old legend of warriors who are bread for no other reason than killing.  Every country wants the perfect death machine so why not breed them from childhood.  That is what the 9 clans attempt to do.  The 9 clans are an old Asian myth where children are taken from their parents as toddlers and spend their early years learning the skills of killing.  They are tortured when they lose, beaten when they fail and killed if they betray any of the basic guidelines.  Leaving is not an option and running ends in extinction.  You have no choices once you enter the clan.  You cannot ever quit.Raizo (Rain) is one of those children.  He has a talent for the arts and a gift for weapons.  The only problem is somewhere along the way he finds his heart and can't bring himself to kill a young girl even after being ordered to.  He turns on his clan and that just doesn't add up to anything good.  He is joined by a young Interpol agent (insert smoking hot partner here) and she aids him the best a librarian can.  Between the two of them they take on the group of killing machines who sniff them out like a pack of wolves.""Ninja Assassin"" is all about action.  There is not a lot of cast chemistry, no romantic ties and little real acting.  It is all about as many gruesome deaths that you can pack into a two hour span.  If you like action movies and hate anything else other than action this is a movie for you.  I tend to like a little balance at times so left the theater short on satisfaction.  That being said I did enjoy the movie just felt it would have been nice to even attempt something slightly more.It is a great movie to see with the guys but I would not bring my girlfriend or wife with you unless she is as close to a dude as she can be without jumping over the fence to the other side.

Boy was I proven right and wrong, haha: I already knew what it was coming into it; i.e. you should never take an action movie's plot too seriously.This movie made me remember the days as a kid imagining what if ninjas really could step in and out of shadows like it was a door hole in the wall. Definitely one of the bloodiest action movies I have seen where the attacks look straight out of Ninja Scroll or as if Ryuei Kitamura directed it; e.g. improbably slicing legs off clean with a kusarigama, and jumping ninjas in half with a katana. It fits the description both words: ridiculously cool, but the average viewer will lean towards either ridiculous or cool. Rain as a the protagonist was amazing showing off his handstand push-ups and acrobatic free-running/parkour as the true art of a ninja. It's weird to think Rain is an actual singer from Korea but making his lead role as a martial artist (probably the only way Asians can get lead roles since it's stereo-type-cast).One thing it did show promise in was breaking a stereotype, but fell short. I was hoping that they would've played more on is the racy (pun intended) inter-racial potential romance between characters Raizo (Rain) and Mika (Naomie Harris). I've seen a black woman with an asian man once before and it got heads turning. This would have been original as it hasn't been done since Romeo Must Die with Aliyah and Jet Li (which was also implied rather than showed) and since ABCs broadcast show Flashforward between Gabrielle Union and John Cho being the only physical romance shown. I guess the movie industry is still warming up to this idea (after all we have a democrat black president).I did get angry at the scene where the movie pitched a German Europol Swat team being over run by ninjas. Hey if Japan really did have ninjas LIKE THAT than I'm pretty sure the US wouldn't have won in WWII. Don't get me wrong, the choreography made it believable in some areas that a sword beats a rifle, but the opening scene where a kusarigama aka chain and sickle/knife cut a Japanese gangster's sword and body in half. (Research the 21 foot rule aka Tueller drill on defensive shooting)Do I like this movie, hell yeah. Does it deserve an acting awards....no.

(Every great martial arts movie should introduce an outlandish new weapon, like the flying guillotine from the movie of the same name, or the spiked ball on a chain from Tarantino's Kill Bill.) The only thing that could have made this better is 3D.We also get the requisite back story detailing our hero's travails as an orphan taken from the streets and forced to undergo the rigors of the ninja training by a ruthless master at a remote fortress, which sets up the revenge plot that leads to a great climactic fight reminiscent of the finale of Enter the Dragon. The directing by McTeigue is perfect, as it keeps the story moving along at hyper speed for it's 99 minute runtime.  The acting is good, though our hero doesn't really have a lot to do, which is probably for the best. Nice to see Ben Miles from Coupling appear in another Wachowski production in the part of agent Maslow. Naomie Harris is charming and likeable as the clerk caught up in events beyond her control. Sho Kosugi is chillingly effective as the sadistic mentor.My only disappointment with the disc is that there were almost no extras, just preview trailers, English, French and Spanish audio options and 8 minutes of deleted scenes.

1292032,A2DMY783TWSMC8,B002VECM3Q,"Kyuzo ""Joe""","[2, 4]","Ninja Assassin starts out with a bunch of Asian yakuza who inexplicably speak English getting slaughtered by an identityless ninja assassin (!). The sequence contains a pseudo dangling cause/ foreshadowing of an old mans heart in the wrong side of his body along with plenty of computer generated and obnoxiously unrealistic violence. The sequence is never explained or brought up again. What is the point of it? Actually, the point is a very true look at what's in store for the viewer. It's exactly what the rest of the film is going to be like, and it works as a sample to help you decide if you want to continue watching. If you do watch, you'll get more undeveloped and boring characters, more rarely funny humor, more bad acting, and more CG gore.Raizo, played by pop sensation Rain (not the Mortal Kombat character), is the same exact cookie cutter silent and deadly protagonist any viewer of martial arts films is likely to recognize. The only difference with him is...... his weapon, I guess. He uses the same techniques he learned from ""the bad guys"" against them. His experience with learning ""the bad guys"" technique is shown to us with multiple cliche flashbacks. I refer to the ninjas as ""the bad guys"" since that's all we ever really learn about them. They are bad. I've always felt it should be the bad guy who has the most interesting character. When they don't have any character at all, the film becomes much less engaging. Along with the main Raizo vs ""the bad guys"" plot there are also two small subplots. One concerns a Berlin agent Mika (who also inexplicably speaks English ...) that only really acts as a way for the film to add more exposition and plot devices. The other is a romance subplot between Raizo and fellow clan member Kiriko. It acts as yet another overused plot devise for revenge, but it also introduces a pretty large plot hole in the process. How the hell did Kiriko manage to last as long as she did in the clan and still remain so sweet? She must have been put through the same grueling, disgusting, and identity erasing process as everyone else, so how is she still so innocent? Just saying ""because"" isn't a good enough answer.The one thing Ninja Assassins does do right is the action scenes, all of which are pretty well choreographed and fun to watch. Of course, the ultimate outcome of each fight is easy to assume (Spoiler: the good guy wins) and sometimes the film will cheat in order to accomplish this, but the fights are still enjoyable. It is not, however, worth sitting through a 99 minute film that feels twice as long to see the handful of well done fights.",2,Isn't the Title Redundant?,1321488000,"11 17, 2011",2011,2615,"['Ninja', 'Assassin', 'out', 'bunch', 'Asian', 'yakuza', 'who', 'inexplicably', 'speak', 'English', 'getting', 'slaughtered', 'identityless', 'ninja', 'assassin', 'sequence', 'pseudo', 'dangling', 'cause/', 'foreshadowing', 'old', 'mans', 'heart', 'wrong', 'side', 'body', 'plenty', 'computer', 'generated', 'obnoxiously', 'unrealistic', 'violence', 'sequence', 'never', 'explained', 'brought', 'up', 'again', 'What', 'point', 'Actually', 'point', 'very', 'true', 'look', 'what', 'store', 'viewer', 'exactly', 'what', 'rest', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'sample', 'help', 'decide', 'want', 'continue', 'watching', 'do', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'get', 'more', 'undeveloped', 'boring', 'characters', 'more', 'rarely', 'funny', 'humor', 'more', 'bad', 'acting', 'more', 'CG', 'gore.Raizo', 'played', 'pop', 'sensation', 'Rain', 'not', 'Mortal', 'Kombat', 'character', 'same', 'exact', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'silent', 'deadly', 'protagonist', 'viewer', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'likely', 'recognize', 'only', 'difference', 'weapon', 'guess', 'same', 'techniques', 'learned', 'bad', 'guys', 'experience', 'learning', 'bad', 'guys', 'technique', 'shown', 'multiple', 'cliche', 'flashbacks', 'refer', 'ninjas', 'bad', 'guys', 'ever', 'really', 'learn', 'are', 'bad', ""'ve"", 'always', 'felt', 'should', 'be', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'When', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'character', 'film', 'much', 'less', 'engaging', 'main', 'Raizo', 'vs', 'bad', 'guys', 'plot', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'small', 'subplots', 'One', 'Berlin', 'agent', 'Mika', 'who', 'also', 'inexplicably', 'English', 'only', 'really', 'way', 'film', 'add', 'more', 'exposition', 'plot', 'devices', 'other', 'romance', 'subplot', 'Raizo', 'fellow', 'clan', 'member', 'Kiriko', 'as', 'yet', 'overused', 'plot', 'devise', 'revenge', 'also', 'pretty', 'large', 'plot', 'hole', 'process', 'How', 'hell', 'did', 'Kiriko', 'manage', 'last', 'as', 'long', 'did', 'clan', 'still', 'remain', 'so', 'sweet', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'same', 'grueling', 'disgusting', 'identity', 'erasing', 'process', 'everyone', 'else', 'how', 'still', 'so', 'innocent', 'Just', 'saying', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'answer.The', 'one', 'thing', 'Ninja', 'Assassins', 'do', 'right', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'well', 'choreographed', 'fun', 'watch', 'course', 'ultimate', 'outcome', 'fight', 'easy', 'assume', 'Spoiler', 'good', 'guy', 'wins', 'film', 'will', 'cheat', 'order', 'accomplish', 'fights', 'are', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'however', 'worth', 'sitting', '99', 'minute', 'film', 'twice', 'as', 'long', 'see', 'handful', 'well', 'done', 'fights']",N/A

I suppose I'm a bit more sci-fi and contemporary than the average Kung-Fu fan but I still appreciate the art.Anyway - back to ""Ninja Assassin.""  The main character's abilities are not grounded in any sort of reality.  He is capable of moving at what appears to be light-speed (from shadow to shadow), he can mend wounds in seconds, and generally has martial arts skills that rival... well, anyone.  Every time he gets going with his signature weapon (a curved dagger on the end of a chain whip) you can immediately tell that it's CGI.  Some fight scenes are so fast that you can't really tell who is doing what (which arm comes from which guy and so forth).The character development isn't that great either.  The movie tries to plug in a little human interest back-story about the main character's youthful days as an apprentice to a great master but ultimately you don't care about him as much as they want you to.  He also has very few lines.The female lead is also somewhat bland; she is a reporter who starts in on a story about the main character and his ancient ninja ways.  The acting is somewhat sub-par and you end up not really believing that the characters really care.  They even go as far as to point out that it's ""ninjas"" and who would really believe its ninjas in our society.  This concept in itself isn't so bad if the actors pull it off without a hitch - but in this movie they don't quite deliver.

I never saw the trailers, read the plot summary or even heard anything about it - the cover looked cool though! After I saw it pop up on sale, I took a peak at the reviews and saw that it did pretty well (generally high numbers) and I decided to give it a shot.I'm not too big a fan of traditional ninja movies. I prefer the more modern-day, action-packed hollywood movies where you just don't have to think, just sit back and let all sorts of ridiculous stuff happen for 2 hours and then forget all about it, and that's pretty much what this was. If you're looking for a story, you're better off skipping this one. If you're looking for some over the top slicing and dicing that will just make  you laugh because of how crazy, over the top ridiculous and unbelievable (not in a bad way) it is, this is your movie. It's sort of like the Crank or Kill Bill of Ninja movies. That alone should either make you want to order it right away or just completely pass on it.I'm never good at going into the plots of movies (especially odd ones like this), so I'll skip that here - many of the other reviews (or the Amazon description) will cover that part. I'll just go into the details of the Blu Ray.The movie itself, I give a 3.5: It's short & sweet, action packed and a fun movie to spend an hour and a half. What keeps it from getting a higher score is the whole investigation sub-story - I found it a bit boring and felt it took away from what could have otherwise been a very good action movie. Still enjoyable, but would've been a bit nicer without that whole part.Video was very good a nice treat on Blu-Ray (blacks were solid, colors were vibrant and I didn't notice any technical issues.Audio was also very good - a nice DTSHD 5.1 Master Audio track with lots of bang to it. It'll give your home theater a nice workout!Extras were decent with about an hour worth of documentaries, extra footage behind the scenes (some better than others). Fortunately all appeared to be in HD. My favorite though were the addition of a DVD and Digital Copy (same disc) - this is great for taking to a friends house (DVD) or copying to your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad (digital copy).Awesome audio, great video and a fun movie make this a recommendation from me!

I can't think of a film that has as many limbs being cut off or higher body count than this one. Maybe the first Kill Bill flick and that's really saying something. After reading a lot of reviews from the critics, I expected a horrible story and acting to go along with the carnage, but neither were that bad. I never heard of the lead actor, played by Rain, but he is suppose to be a big singer in Asia. His performance was on and off, but his physicality stole the show. I felt the scenes that showed the main character's training from a young boy to a man at a secret assassin fortress added some depth. That sensei doesn't mess around!Even though ninjas prefer to engage in combat in the dark, I like how you can still see what is going on in most of the fights. The many action scenes are the highlights for sure. They are brutal beyond belief, but some of the blood was a little too CGI for my tastes. Still, there were many creative kills using various slice and dice weapons. The opening scene has the most memorable kill, setting the tone for the rest of the film. And how can you not love seeing massive ninja stars being thrown at a machine gun rate of speed?The story is your typical martial arts fare and the acting ranges from pretty good to mediocre, but you should know better than to watch this for either of those elements. I remember a couple of weeks ago saying how the destruction of the Earth, as seen in the movie 2012, won't likely be surpassed. Well, I doubt there will ever be another ninja film that throws as much violence, gore and action into just a little over 90 minutes.

1292053,A20DRRKAN5Z9Q,B002VECM3Q,Moviedude,"[0, 0]","Ninja Assassin is a bit of an odd duck. It is obviously about ninja, but it chooses to address the ninja in terms of their fearsome mystical reputation while largely eschewing real martial arts. The result is something closer to a horror film than an action thriller- almost all the ninja mayhem, from Rain's chain flail to the innumerable shuriken that explosively tear apart the supporting cast are CG, as are most of the stunts. The results are creepy and more than a little fun to watch, but when you compare the pretend ninjitsu in this film to similar but real stunts in ""serious"" martial arts films, Ninja Assassin looks a little weak. The previously mentioned flail is a particularly obvious weakness, as Ong Bak 2 came out on home video about the time Ninja Assassin was released, and for much of Ong Bak 2 Tony Jaa does the same flail combat that Rain does... but for real.If you can close out your inner martial arts film critic and just view ninjas in this movie as crazy magical murderers who are a bit more than human (in idea often espoused by ninjas themselves in olden days and embraced by the Wachowskis here) then the movie is actually pretty decent. At its heart it's more or less just a rehash of Le Femme Nikita with a young man in the young woman's role. Ninja is raised as brutal assassin, grows a heart, has to fight other ninjas, learns to laugh and love. It's very rote and predictable, although Interpol's final showdown with the Ninja clan is a bit more conclusive (and insane) than the climaxes of more introspective assassin thrillers. Unlike the later Matrix films, this movie is short on navel-gazing and long on ass-kicking, even if that ass-kicking is mostly a cartoon.Special mention goes to the supporting cast in this film- 80s ninja movie legend Sho Kosugi gives a great turn as the villainous leader of the ninja clan, and to Naomie Harris, who is able to convey more depth than she did in Pirates of the Caribbean here, as well as more likeability than Skyfall allowed her to muster.PROS-Solid performances from a good cast-Very well shot-Deceptively subtle plot gives way to nutso climax-Sho Kosugi!CONS-Uses special effects fakery for stunts that would look better real-Middle plods a bit",3,"A solid enough movie, but a bit much fakery for my tastes",1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,2231,"['Ninja', 'Assassin', 'bit', 'odd', 'duck', 'obviously', 'ninja', 'address', 'ninja', 'terms', 'fearsome', 'mystical', 'reputation', 'largely', 'eschewing', 'real', 'martial', 'arts', 'result', 'something', 'closer', 'horror', 'film', 'action', 'thriller-', 'almost', 'ninja', 'mayhem', 'Rain', 'chain', 'flail', 'innumerable', 'shuriken', 'explosively', 'tear', 'apart', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'CG', 'are', 'most', 'stunts', 'results', 'are', 'creepy', 'more', 'little', 'fun', 'watch', 'when', 'compare', 'pretend', 'ninjitsu', 'film', 'similar', 'real', 'stunts', 'serious', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'Ninja', 'Assassin', 'little', 'weak', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'flail', 'particularly', 'obvious', 'weakness', 'Ong', 'Bak', '2', 'came', 'out', 'home', 'video', 'time', 'Ninja', 'Assassin', 'was', 'released', 'much', 'Ong', 'Bak', '2', 'Tony', 'Jaa', 'same', 'flail', 'combat', 'Rain', 'real.If', 'can', 'close', 'out', 'inner', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'critic', 'just', 'view', 'ninjas', 'movie', 'crazy', 'magical', 'murderers', 'who', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'human', 'idea', 'often', 'espoused', 'ninjas', 'olden', 'days', 'embraced', 'Wachowskis', 'here', 'then', 'movie', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'heart', 'more', 'less', 'just', 'rehash', 'Le', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'young', 'man', 'young', 'woman', 'role', 'Ninja', 'raised', 'brutal', 'assassin', 'heart', 'fight', 'other', 'ninjas', 'laugh', 'love', 'very', 'rote', 'predictable', 'Interpol', 'final', 'showdown', 'Ninja', 'clan', 'bit', 'more', 'conclusive', 'insane', 'climaxes', 'more', 'introspective', 'assassin', 'thrillers', 'later', 'Matrix', 'films', 'movie', 'short', 'navel-gazing', 'long', 'ass-kicking', 'even', 'ass-kicking', 'mostly', 'cartoon.Special', 'mention', 'supporting', 'cast', 'film-', '80s', 'ninja', 'movie', 'legend', 'Sho', 'Kosugi', 'great', 'turn', 'villainous', 'leader', 'ninja', 'clan', 'Naomie', 'Harris', 'who', 'able', 'convey', 'more', 'depth', 'did', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'likeability', 'Skyfall', 'allowed', 'muster.PROS-Solid', 'performances', 'good', 'cast-Very', 'well', 'shot-Deceptively', 'subtle', 'plot', 'way', 'nutso', 'climax-Sho', 'Kosugi', 'CONS-Uses', 'special', 'effects', 'fakery', 'stunts', 'would', 'look', 'better', 'real-Middle', 'plods', 'bit']",N/A

I'm not usually a fan of ultra violent, blood soaked gore fests-but I'll make an exception here.  The blood and nastiness is warranted to really give the audience a sense of just how deadly the Ninja Clans in this film are.  Movies like these are also rare in that every single frame and every line of dialog seem to be brimming with confidence and TLC.  Obviously this was given a LOT of TLC from the director and everyone involved.  This films just absolutely reeks (in a good way) of style and class.Surprisingly, the movie that Ninja Assassin reminds me of most is the original Terminator.  Like that film, the characters find themselves being pursued by a lethal enemy who will stop at nothing to kill them.  One is the protector the other the protected and the odds are not in their favor.  That's where the similarities end however, because honestly-the Ninja Clans in this film make The Terminator look like a complete wuss in comparison.It bears repeating that this film is all about style.  Style, style and more style.  It's slickly done, the music is loud and fitting, it's fast paced, dangerous and thrilling.  The fight scenes are all high stakes and deadly and even the protagonist is not immune to receiving a beat down.  It's refreshing in a time of remakes, reboots, movies based on tv shows, etc to see something so fresh and original come along.

These ninja are also invisible to the naked eye, making it virtually impossible for their intended victims to know when they're coming and to mount a viable defense against them before they arrive.  Raizo (South Korean pop singer Rain) is the ultimate Ninja warrior who, disillusioned with the whole killing thing, now resides in anonymity in Berlin, having long ago chosen to turn his back on the clan that raised him.  Mika (Naomie Harris) is the spunky forensic researcher who's beginning to uncover the existence of this group at great personal risk to herself and those around her.  Together, Raizo and Mika battle the evildoers, while a budding romance develops between them.As ninja movies go, this one is relatively well-thought-out and entertaining, mixing contemporary cloak-and-dagger espionage sequences with flashbacks to Riazo's unconventional upbringing.  In addition, this mega-bloody and ultra-violent film at least provides some internal conflict and character development to go along with its sometimes jaw-dropping and always skillfully executed martial arts sequences (the fact that Joel Silver and the Wachowski Brothers are the film's producers probably accounts for the comparatively high quality of the final product).",3,entertaining martial arts thriller,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,1504,"['***1/2The', 'main', 'villain', 'James', 'McTeigue', 'Ninja', 'Assassin', 'ancient', 'secret', 'clan', 'known', 'Ozuno', 'little', 'children', 'purpose', 'turning', 'cold-blooded', 'killing', 'machines', 'devoid', 'personalities', 'emotions', 'lives', 'own', 'ninja', 'are', 'also', 'invisible', 'naked', 'eye', 'making', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'intended', 'victims', 'know', 'when', ""'re"", 'coming', 'mount', 'viable', 'defense', 'arrive', 'Raizo', 'South', 'Korean', 'pop', 'singer', 'Rain', 'ultimate', 'Ninja', 'warrior', 'who', 'disillusioned', 'whole', 'killing', 'thing', 'now', 'anonymity', 'Berlin', 'having', 'long', 'ago', 'chosen', 'turn', 'back', 'clan', 'raised', 'Mika', 'Naomie', 'Harris', 'spunky', 'forensic', 'researcher', 'who', 'beginning', 'uncover', 'existence', 'group', 'great', 'personal', 'risk', 'herself', 'Together', 'Raizo', 'Mika', 'battle', 'evildoers', 'budding', 'romance', 'them.As', 'ninja', 'movies', 'go', 'one', 'relatively', 'well-thought-out', 'entertaining', 'mixing', 'contemporary', 'cloak-and-dagger', 'espionage', 'sequences', 'flashbacks', 'Riazo', 'unconventional', 'upbringing', 'addition', 'mega-bloody', 'ultra-violent', 'film', 'least', 'internal', 'conflict', 'character', 'development', 'go', 'along', 'sometimes', 'jaw-dropping', 'always', 'skillfully', 'executed', 'martial', 'arts', 'sequences', 'fact', 'Joel', 'Silver', 'Wachowski', 'Brothers', 'are', 'film', 'producers', 'probably', 'accounts', 'comparatively', 'high', 'quality', 'final', 'product']",N/A

Especially if you're into blood soaked martial arts films. The plot, in a nutshell is a rouge ninja named Razio faces off against his former clan after he refuses to follow their code of emotionless cold blooded murder. Elsewhere, a pretty, young Europol agent named Mika investigates the murder of a Russian diplomat and suspects ninja involvement, Ninja's that happen to be Razio's former clan. Needless to say, said ninjas don't like her meddling in their affairs and set out to take her out of the picture. Razio catches wind of thieir plans and uses it as an opportunity to sever some heads and act as Mika's personal bodyguard. As the ninja's attacks increase, Razio and Mika join forces to keep each other alive and to take the clan down once and for all. ""Ninja Assassin"" seems to take itself seriously but more often to than not it comes off as an action/comedy. When you watch ninjas fighting in the streets of Berlin as terrified Germans in their Volkswagen try desperately to swerve out of the way, you can't help but laugh out loud. The acting is pretty bad though ""Rain"" does a decent job playing the stoic ninja Razio. The best performance is by Razio's master and clan leader. He has a very interesting voice and his presence on screen demands attention. ""Ninja Assassin"" in a very pretty movie. The flight scenes in the rain and in the burning dojo are pure eye candy.

Body parts flying everywhere, heads getting lopped off left and right, hands, arms, legs, torsos being cut in half, and exaggeratedly immense amounts of blood gushing everywhere. People die in this movie, a LOT of people die in this movie, and not in nice ways. There's also more than your fair share of shooting. This is the best Martial Arts / Ninja movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a LOT of them. And what ninja thriller would be complete without an appearance from none other than Sho Kosugi? There is a lot of fighting in the dark, which of course is going to happen where ninjas are involved, and this makes some of the fight scenes a bit hard to follow. However, that just immerses you more into the chaos of the scene. You think it's hard to see what's happening? Picture being in a pitch black warehouse with dozens and dozens of soldiers and automatic gun fire and also barrages of ninjas coming out of everywhere swords-a-cutting and throwing dozens and dozens of throwing stars at anything that moves. Yeah, it's going to be a bit difficult at times to see just what the heck is happening. There is some supernatural-ness to the film but it fits in well with the context of the movie. The surround sound of the movie theater was taken full advantage of with throwing stars coming from all directions, and oh my gosh they threw a LOT of throwing stars. I bet this movie hands down has the most throwing stars used in it of any other movie. And they're not you're regular throwing stars. These babies are about 6"" across, four pointed, and razor sharp. It reminds me of those movies that have thousands of archers sending thousands and thousands of arrows at the enemy. This was a similar thing but with barrages of throwing stars instead. If you're into these types of movies, this has to be the best one to date. If you're not into these types of movies, you'll hate this one just as much as any other ninja movie.

1292082,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B002VECM3Q,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[1, 2]","Movie - 4.5Being born and growing up in the '80s, I had something of a ninja complex. Snakes Eyes and Storm Shadow from G.I. Joe, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, heck, even Super Ninja from Chuck Norris' Karate Kommandos were all inspirations to me. But when we're talking about ninja influences of the '80s, the name that still resonates with most ninja fans today is Sh' Kosugi. With almost a dozen movies made in that decade alone, Kosugi could be argued as the perennial iconic figure that helped catapult ninja mythology in the U.S. What most of us associate with ninjas today probably includes something along the lines of shadowy backdrops, a sacred katana or kusarigama (chain and sickle), a boatload of shurikens, termination by stealth, and some form of ninjutsu magic, which is essentially what we got from the ninja boom of the '80s. I, for one, found myself watching American Ninja, Revenge of the Ninja, and Ninja III: The Domination more times than I can remember. But why? It was never about the plot, of course, but the fascinating and extraordinary world of ninja lore. Put that concept together with an actual Hollywood budget, the director of V for Vendetta, production by the creators of The Matrix, and even star the legendary Kosugi himself as the villain, and, aesthetically, you may have the best-looking ninja flick to date. Simple story aside, what the film excels at is brutal violence, some dazzling acrobatics, a mesmerizing mysticism, and a propensity for blood-spatter. Performing in his first major role, Rain does an excellent job portraying and conveying the relentlessness and grit of his character, while Kosugi plays the ""Boss"" character with wicked aptitude and a type of vigor that many will reminisce of from his glory days. If anything, my only complaint would be that movie ended before I knew it.Video - 4.5Presented by Warner Bros. in 1080p using the VC-1 codec at an original aspect ratio of 2.39:1, Ninja Assassin looks quite good. Black levels, the most important factor and dominant color within the photography, are dead-on. I saw the movie twice in theaters and admit having trouble actually watching a good majority of the ninja action within the darkness. But here on Blu-ray, I have absolutely no problem. Shadow delineation is flawless, resulting in zero loss of quality and allowing me to not miss a single beat of the choreography outside of a few fast camera cuts. Colors range from lush to vibrant, though remain predominantly red when copious amounts of blood fly all over the screen. Flesh tones are very accurate for the most part as well and never feel over-saturated be it a day or night time scene. Details and textures are sharp, revealing a great amount of depth and dimensionality. The only problem I have is with one instance of distracting contrast in the scene where Raizo cuts Ozunu's face. It's as if they're on two completely different planes, but it may just be a result of the special effects sequence. I think I also spotted a few specs of debris here and there. Other than those minor quibbles, though, this is easily reference material if you're wanting to showcase the color black.Audio - 5.0While the video presentation may be slightly debatable, the audio presentation is not. The DTS-HD 5.1 track for Ninja Assassin is a ninja fan's dream come true. High/low ends have no discrepancies, easily differentiating between heavy and light sounds. Directionality becomes extremely engaging when the shurikens start flying, blades start clanging, and chains start rattling from all directions, which are doubly complimented by the dynamic range of the LFE levels. Thumps, thuds, and bumps have all kinds of subtleties between the sound of music, bodies hitting the floor, and shurikens managing to clunk themselves into either a wall, a chunk of wood, or human flesh. Gunfire from automatic rifles and machine guns also emanate a good deal of bass. Dialogue is clear-cut and never suffers from any dropout or volume anomalies, and the track shows some particularly good examples of immersion when all the ninja voices start talking in unison. Definitely use this title to showcase your surround systems.Extras 4.0Although the extras clock in at just under 40 minutes, I actually found all of it to be quite informative and entertaining. The first feature, ""The Myth and Legend of Ninjas,"" is a discussion about their origins and evolved perception over the years. It's relatively short, but actually very interesting to hear about how the legacy has progressed from something so sacred into more of a sideshow these days. They basically give you a brief history lesson of the ninja, talk about their original purposes, display some of the weapons, and talk about ninjutsu as an overall martial philosophy. The second feature, ""The Extreme Sport of a Ninja,"" is another quick, although deceptively detailed, look at how they incorporated Parkour and a lot of other athletic disciplines into the stunt coordination and fight choreography, which really raised my appreciation for the filming process. And the final feature, ""Training Rain,"" is a surprising transformation of the Korean pop star's status from boy band-member to buffed-out stuntman. Yes, this proves that with a lot of grueling work, buff Asian guys can exist. The package also comes with a convenient DVD/Digital Copy disc that may prove useful for lending and traveling situations. The only other thing I wish they had that might've bumped the extras to a 4.5 or 5.0 is the inclusion of a Maximum Movie Mode. But oh well, it's still a good set.Overall - 4.5Ninja Assassin is an escapist fantasy world that's really bloody, but a lot of fun at the same time. Action, and especially ninja, fans should rejoice for this newest entry into, what seems, a long and forgotten genre that somehow got lost in the black sands of time. The plot for these films certainly aren't anything to write home about, but that was never the point anyway. It's about the atmosphere. In modern times, ninjas have always been about style, fluidity, grace, and yet this cold, fearsome paranoia that if I ever were to be targeted by one, I'd most likely die a terrible and blood-soaked death, which this movie exudes to a great degree. With near-reference video, a guaranteed pleaser for the ears, and a surprisingly entertaining set of extras, Ninja Assassin comes highly recommended.",5,Ninja Assassin (Blu-ray),1268784000,"03 17,

Swept off the streets as a young boy, Raizo is transformed into an unstoppable killing machine by a secret society known as the Ozunu Clan.

In the aftermath of that killing, Raizo stages a daring escape, subsequently biding his time until the day he can take the entire Ozunu Clan down. Visually this movie is incredible.

The assassin's attack is much faster than Uma Thurman's heroine in ""Kill Bill Vol.1."" The killer (or killers) is silent and almost invisible and the gangsters have no chance from the beginning. The scene ends with severed heads and limbs in a pool of blood. We don't know why they should be killed, but we do know we are in for an extremely gory action flick.But we have to wait for that action to happen. The over-the-top violence is followed by the not-so-impressive storyline, in which Europol agent Mika Coretti (Naomie Harris) investigates a series of assassinations that she suspects are related to a mysterious clan of ninjas. In the meanwhile, we are introduced to a man named Raizo (Rain), who lives alone in an apartment room almost bare of furniture.""Ninja Assassin"" is a modern-day version of Grade-B ninja action movies, with special effects and martial arts stunts. Ozunu, a very strict leader of the clan, is played by Sh Kosugi, star of the cult ninja films during the 1980s. Hero's name Raizo reminds us of Ichikawa Raizo, Japanese actor best known for his role of the swordsman Nemuri Kyoshiro. The film is helmed by James McTeigue, director of ""V for Vendetta.""The intention of the producers (including Joel Silver, Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski) is clear - a cool and edgy ninja action film updated for the new generation. Sadly they forgot one thing: action. The stunts themselves are decent, but set-pieces are marred by choppy editing. The narrative is uneven and awkward with too many flashbacks. Actors did a fine job, but James McTeigue is not ready for this kind of big action flick, relying too much on CGI-created blood and weapons.Though it is one of the critically bashed films released in 2009, ""Ninja Assassin"" is not as bad as you might be led to believe.

There were some parts of the story that were a bet more personal than a lot of movies of this genre.  However;  I can overlook the fantastic things these hand held weapons could do such as making a clean cut through a skull with one hit....Even a power saw would have a difficult time cutting through a skull bone with flesh around it and brains still inside....Ok...I can just overlook that as fantasy.  What gets me about so many martial art films is how they figure these trained individuals can use some learned mental conscentrations to somehow defy physics.  When I see a Nija disappear with a smoke gernade that's logical.  When they disappear into thin air and then come back with super human speed like Clark Kent then that's just plain magic, and plain silly.  It works on Superman stories because that's part of the Superman character, but you don't start with totally human warriors and make them into super beings who can disappear, move at light speed, and even fly.

The sound really peaks near the end as it handles both continuous, rapid gun fire and flying ninja stars.  Both are clearly and uniquely heard happening at the same time.  There is a subtle film grain present in most scenes, but it does not peak during dark sequences, they are handled very well.This film is about 50% action and 50% story, a lot of which is told through flashbacks.  The action is very fast yet clear on a TV processing at 120hz.  One scene bothered me a bit in the finale.  Our hero is battling several ninja in a dojo and blood is flying everywhere, yet there is no blood on the floor.  It seems to just dissipate into thin air.  Also, the action wraps up at around 1hr 29mins.  The movie is 99mins so I think were going to get a nice epilogue.  Instead the movie ends about a minute later and we get 9mins of credits.For me, the holy grail of blood and guts horror films has always been Peter Jackson's Dead Alive.  Although some have claimed to have topped his grizzly visual assault, none have really come close.  The holy grail of blood and guts action films has been Kill Bill, with no close contender.

1292095,A1QF10TB8AYTA3,B002VECM3Q,"Wilmar Luna ""Author of The Silver Ninja""","[0, 2]","All right, so I decided to give this movie a little rental because well... Ninja's and Assassins, sounds cool right? Wrong, wrong, so wrong.Let's get one thing straight, this movie is very inconsistent in terms of quality, story, characterization, and everything else in between. This is what a B-movie would be like if it were given a bigger budget. So let's break down why you need to avoid this movie if you're bored wherever you are.1.) The beginning of the movie (after the murder of the nameless yakuza dudes) is mainly a flashback to the protagonists training days. This is normally fine, except for one problem: He's in the present having flashbacks at random! Oh there's a metal plate bobbing up and down, let me remember when my sensei yelled at me for making noise! Oh I'm going to do hand stand push ups over a bed of nails, let me remember when my fellow ninja dude beat the crap out of me in training.If the movie was going to put so much emphasis on the ""origin"" of the character, then the ENTIRE opening scene should have been done at the ninja school. Instead we're treated with random flashbacks which are paired with random training montages. What the hell is he training for? At this point of the movie he hasn't been asked to do anything nor is he really preparing for anything.2.) They try to make the protagonist into mr. silent but deadly hero dude. His training and grueling background would make any person into a quiet killer. Yet, this guy (in the present) throws out some light hearted jokes as if he's a nice guy. His jokes are very inconsistent with the dark background they've given him and they feel out of place.3.) The blood and gore is over the top. We're talking heads splitting in half, legs chopped off, torso cut in two, this movie has gratuitous blood to the most obnoxious level. First off, the effects look super fake, and the blood seems to serve no purpose than to just be bloody for the sake of it. At least when I watch Robocop and see dudes get blown to bits, I see a purpose behind it. Not so in Ninja Assassin, though if you're a fan of over the top fake looking blood. By all means, knock yourself out.4.) Why are the ninjas killing people anyway? There's no point!Let me repeat, there is NO POINT to this movie! It's ninja porn plain and simple and it's badly executed (which is ironic considering the names attached to this film). It's a mindless action movie that sets out to have one dude fighting and killing ninjas. That's it, there's no dramatic plot twist, there's no deep meanings or themes, and in all honesty. The action scenes aren't even that great.Sure there's some redeeming qualities to the film. The final fight with the sensei was like watching a video game boss battle, and the ninjas using the shadows to teleport was pretty cool. But all these scenes could most likely be viewed on youtube and there's absolutely no sense in you spending 1.99 to rent this movie.If you want to see a GOOD mindless action movie.

I would definitely recommend renting it on Amazon; it cost more to rent on other sites and I wouldn't pay more than two dollars to rent it.",4,Entertaining,1364688000,"03 31, 2013",2013,382,"['adore', 'Rain', 'really', 'wanted', 'watch', 'movie', 'rented', 'Amazon', 'video', '48', 'hours', 'costing', '2', 'movie', 'predictable', 'bit', 'campy', 'enjoyed', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'pretty', 'silly', 'still', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'renting', 'Amazon', 'cost', 'more', 'rent', 'other', 'sites', 'would', ""n't"", 'pay', 'more', 'two', 'dollars', 'rent']",N/A
