673387,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00005PJ8L,Acute Observer,"[0, 2]","Wing and a Prayer, 1944 filmThis is a story about the early days of WW II. The US Navy was damaged by the attack on Pearl Harbor. If the Japanese split their fleet the USN could attack and defeat them. The strategy is explained. They hope to attack and win at the Battle of Midway. They show a flight of Grumman TBD airplanes coming in for a landing on an aircraft carrier. One airplane makes a hard landing, he ignored a wave-off. Can they raise vegetables with just water? One pilot was a Hollywood actor. The talk tells about their culture. [The `Saturday Evening Post' cost a dime.] The pilots are ordered to avoid enemy action (as part of a ruse). The airplanes are launched at dawn. An old-fashioned X-ray machine checks one pilot's chest; he is fit. The pilots practice bombing. One is grounded for his attitude.Entertainment is a Betty Grable movie ""Tin Pan Alley"" (on 16mm film). The film breaks! The carrier changes course. ""General Quarters!"" They detected a submarine. Grumman F4F fighters take off on a mission. [The cockpits are open to allow an easy exit.] But one TBD crashes after its take-off. What happened? The pilot will be assigned to shore duty. We see American planes painted to look like Jap Zeros. One TBD is shot down. Did they see a Task Force? New orders come in. They prepare for combat. The Battle of Midway must be won in the air. F4F fighters are launched, then TBDs. One pilot has a problem with his airplane. Their radio talk is transmitted to the carrier (and the viewers). One airplane prevents a torpedo from hitting the carrier! The airplanes land safely.There is a lone TBF approaching the carrier, but rain and fog hide the carrier. Radio silence prevents communication. [It could also be an enemy trick.] They must save the carrier at all costs. Finally the sound of that airplane stops. ""He didn't have a chance!"" The lives of 3,000 men are more important than just three. Did this film meet the expectations of its audience? I'm sorry this movie wasn't better, but its war-time production had its censorship. ""The Battle of Midway"" was a much better movie. A history book is the best source on the battle and the war.The TBD torpedo bomber held a three man crew: pilot and two rear-gunners. Automobile manufacturers ceased production in 1942 and switched to airplanes. The TBF was built by Ford, the TBM was built by General Motors. GM (and others ) also built F6F fighters. George W. Bush Sr. flew a TBD during WW II (it crashed, but he survived). The title came from a popular son of that era ""Coming Home on a Wing and a Prayer"".

673395,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B00005PJ8L,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[0, 7]","Don Ameche (Cmndr. Bingo Harper) and Dana Andrews (Lt. Cmndr Edward Moulton) star in this movie that supposedly describes the Battle of Midway in 1942, but there are numerous inaccuracies that leave the viewer wondering what it is they are actually viewing.The basic plot of the movie goes something like this.  After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the American public was wondering where their Navy was.  It appeared to them that the Navy had gone into hiding and was actually afraid to face the Japanese fleet.  ""Carrier X"" was dispatched to lull the Japanese into thinking that the American fleet was scattered all over the Pacific ocean, when in reality, they were positioned off of Midway, ready to intercept the Japanese fleet which was intent on invading Hawaii.Cmndr. Moulton and his squadron of TBF torpedo bomber pilots have just landed on the carrier, and Cmndr. Harper takes command of the squadron.  Inflexible and strictly by-the-book, many men in the squadron soon take a disliking to Harper.During their voyage, the men are told to refrain from engaging enemy pilots, being told to return to their carrier rather than shoot it out with the Japanese.  Activities are limited to recon flights and target bombing practice.  The men become more and more frustrated with the non-combat strategy.  Finally, the Captain tells the crew that they are about to sail to Midway to join in battle against the Japanese fleet.  Relieved, the crew can now focus on fighting the Japanese.Despite this movie being produced in 1944, more care should have been taken in regards to historical correctness.  As a reader of World War II history for over thirty years, I was frustrated to see the American people in the film asking ""where is our navy"" when in reality, the American fleet started striking back (albeit rather small hit and run raids) immediately after Pearl Harbor.  Who can forget the heroic defense of Wake island only hours after the bombs had stopped falling over Pearl?As for the battle of Midway aspect of the film, this was the most disappointing to me.  During the actual battle, not a single American torpedo struck any ship in the Japanese fleet, but in the movie, the torpedo bombers were shown with their torpedoes striking with great regularity against the Japanese fleet.  Plus, the idea of the ""rogue"" American carrier joining up with the rest of the American fleet in the nick of time is somewhat absurd.I felt the acting was fairly good.  Don Ameche does a good job as the cold-hearted Commander Harper, Dana Andrews is good as Commander Moulton, and William Eythe does a good job as Ensign Hallam ""Oscar"" Scott, a former academy award winning actor turned torpedo plane pilot.I can only give this movie a lukewarm recommendation.  If you like action and battle scenes, then the movie is ok, but for historical accuracy and correctness, then the movie is extremely poor.  Don't watch this movie expecting to get an accurate account of the Battle of Midway; you won't.",3,"O.K.

No matter. lots of action scenes, many of the scenes were actors performing in front of newsreel footage in what we now call a blue screen. Years later we're all so smart it almost seems quaint & we may chuckle. But it is excellent for it's time, which was wartime.The U.S. military, paranoid as they are, covered up the battle & this movie for a long time. They publicized  the Dolittle Tokyo raid which happened a few weeks before to boost the public morale. I would have thought our smashing victory at Midway might have had the same positive effect & a negative one on the Japanese.The plot: The aircraft carrier USS X was traveling at light speed all over the Pacific so the enemy would think we had lots of carriers. It was traveling without it's escort ships which a carrier never does. It's too valuable. Then our pilots were to fly off the carrier but never engage enemy pilots. They are to run away, so the enemy thinks we are cowards. Of course, the enemy pilots would never think of following them back to their carrier which they could promptly sink since it has none of its escort ships. As history it is totally bogus but as a movie it is great. So I'm sorry if I'm critical. Dana Andrews, William Elthey & Henry Morgan etc. did good imitations of Navy pilots. They flew torpedo planes. In the movie they did a lot of damage & some of them survived. As we now know all the torpedo pilots went down & none of their torpedos hit a Japanese ship (some torpedoes were defective). This does not diminish their heroism or sacrifice. Don Ameche was exceptionally good as the stern, by the book, Cmdr. Bingo Harper. He is cast as the villian all the men love to hate.

673401,A1JJK67VXR1WSR,B00005PJ8L,William R. Hancock,"[10, 11]","""Wing & A Prayer"" is a very well done WWII period war movie. The story line is engrossing, the direction sure-handed, and the acting first rate. Like such jewels as ""They Were Expendable"", ""Bataan"", ""Guadalcanal Diary"", and others, this was a film as much about human beings and their hopes and fearsin the face of harrowing danger as it was about the ""boom-boom-rat-tat-tat"" of cinematic combat action ( and such emphasis on the human being rather than the bursting shrapnel was the reason why the television series ""Combat"" was so enormously popular in the 1960s). There is plenty of action, to be sure, though, in ""Wing & A Prayer"", much of it culled from actualcombat footage and the rest created by Fox's ace special effectsmaestro Fred Sersen. Add up the combat footage, the FX wizardry, the direction, the cinematography, the script, and the acting performances, and you see in toto a fine piece of filmmaking.People often carp about things that really don't matter in movies (continuity errors, etc.), and most all movies about WWII have them. Yes, you see Hellcats doubling for Wildcats at times, and sometimes Hellcats reconfiguring as Corsairs while in flight and then back to Hellcats again. And you generally see ""rising sun"" painted SBDs or AT-6 Texans impersonatingJapanese aircraft in films....or Sherman or Walker Bulldog tanks ""pretending"" to be German Tigers, Mark IV Panzers or Panthers. And sometimes M-3 or M-5 light tanks turn ""Japanese""on us. But so what? Filmmakers, at certain points in time, had to ""make do"" with what they had available to them at time of production (in ""To Hell And Back""...movie version...Audie Murphy earns his Medal of Honor atop a TANK...NOT a tankDESTROYER as in historical reality...again, so what?).I, for one, just let these little quibbles scoot by and don't worry about them. In the overall context of the stories being told, they don't amount to a thing.Give ""Wing & A Prayer"" a break. Its a good flick and the little ""bloopers"" just don't matter here.Lastly, to the reviewer who asked the question about the USS Ticonderoga and SBD footage shot aboard that vessel....part of a movie starring Errol Flynn...no, ""Wing & A Prayer"" isn't it.Flynn is nowhere to be found in ""Wing"". The movie you want to see is Warner Bros. 1941 vehicle ""Dive Bomber"", starring Flynn and Ralph Bellamy. ""Dive Bomber"" (about flight surgeons working to prevent dive bomber pilots from passing out from G-forceblood drainage from the brain in steep sustained dives)is the movie that a crackpot named Charles Higham cited as an example of Errol Flynn's ""nazi spy activities"" in a ludicrous book he wrote in the late 1970s. Long since discounted and now justly ridiculed, this author tried to claim that Flynn used his ""influence"" with Warner Bros. to have ""Dive Bomber"" filmed in, around, and over Pearl Harbor, so that views of the harbor could be sent to Japan to help prepare for the December 7th attack. This was a preposterous claim as the Japanese spy network in Honolulu had already supplied all the needed intel months before and models and mock-ups were already in use in Japan. Further preposterousness lay in the fact that no one...not even a ""star""...could influence filming locations under Hollywood's old studio system. And, lastly, given theproduction facts about ""Dive Bomber"", one has to wonder how a movie shot entirely on location in SAN DIEGO could possibly offer up any ""useful intelligence"" on PEARL HARBOR!!At any rate, if one is looking for ""family SBD"" footage from an Errol Flynn movie, ""Dive Bomber"" is what you are looking for.",5,Carrier X Gets It Done,1142294400,"03 14, 2006",2006,3587,"['Wing', 'A', 'Prayer', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'WWII', 'period', 'war', 'movie', 'story', 'line', 'engrossing', 'direction', 'sure-handed', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'such', 'jewels', 'Were', 'Expendable', 'Bataan', 'Guadalcanal', 'Diary', 'others', 'was', 'film', 'much', 'human', 'beings', 'hopes', 'fearsin', 'face', 'harrowing', 'danger', 'was', 'boom-boom-rat-tat-tat', 'cinematic', 'combat', 'action', 'such', 'emphasis', 'human', 'being', 'rather', 'bursting', 'shrapnel', 'was', 'reason', 'why', 'television', 'series', 'Combat', 'was', 'so', 'enormously', 'popular', '1960s', 'plenty', 'action', 'be', 'sure', 'though', 'Wing', 'A', 'Prayer', 'much', 'culled', 'actualcombat', 'footage', 'rest', 'created', 'Fox', 'ace', 'special', 'effectsmaestro', 'Fred', 'Sersen', 'Add', 'combat', 'footage', 'FX', 'wizardry', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'script', 'acting', 'performances', 'see', 'toto', 'fine', 'piece', 'filmmaking.People', 'often', 'carp', 'things', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'movies', 'continuity', 'errors', 'etc', 'most', 'movies', 'WWII', 'have', 'Yes', 'see', 'Hellcats', 'doubling', 'Wildcats', 'times', 'sometimes', 'Hellcats', 'reconfiguring', 'Corsairs', 'flight', 'then', 'back', 'Hellcats', 'again', 'generally', 'see', 'rising', 'sun', 'painted', 'SBDs', 'AT-6', 'Texans', 'impersonatingJapanese', 'aircraft', 'films', '.or', 'Sherman', 'Walker', 'Bulldog', 'pretending', 'be', 'German', 'Tigers', 'Mark', 'IV', 'Panzers', 'Panthers', 'sometimes', 'M-3', 'M-5', 'light', 'tanks', 'turn', 'Japanese', 'so', 'what', 'Filmmakers', 'certain', 'points', 'time', 'had', 'make', 'do', 'what', 'had', 'available', 'time', 'production', 'Hell', 'Back', 'movie', 'version', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'atop', 'TANK', 'NOT', 'tankDESTROYER', 'historical', 'reality', 'again', 'what', '.I', 'one', 'just', 'let', 'little', 'quibbles', 'scoot', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'overall', 'context', 'stories', 'being', 'told', 'do', ""n't"", 'amount', 'thing.Give', 'Wing', 'A', 'Prayer', 'break', 'good', 'flick', 'little', 'bloopers', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'here.Lastly', 'reviewer', 'who', 'asked', 'question', 'USS', 'Ticonderoga', 'SBD', 'footage', 'shot', 'vessel', '.part', 'movie', 'starring', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'Wing', 'A', 'Prayer', ""n't"", 'it.Flynn', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'Wing', 'movie', 'want', 'see', 'Warner', 'Bros.', '1941', 'vehicle', 'Dive', 'Bomber', 'starring', 'Flynn', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'Dive', 'Bomber', 'flight', 'surgeons', 'working', 'prevent', 'dive', 'bomber', 'pilots', 'passing', 'out', 'G-forceblood', 'drainage', 'brain', 'steep', 'sustained', 'dives', 'movie', 'crackpot', 'named', 'Charles', 'Higham', 'cited', 'example', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'nazi', 'spy', 'activities', 'ludicrous', 'book', 'wrote', 'late', '1970s', 'Long', 'discounted', 'now', 'justly', 'ridiculed', 'author', 'tried', 'claim', 'Flynn', 'used', 'influence', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'have', 'Dive', 'Bomber', 'filmed', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'views', 'harbor', 'could', 'be', 'sent', 'Japan', 'help', 'prepare', 'December', '7th', 'attack', 'was', 'preposterous', 'claim', 'Japanese', 'spy', 'network', 'Honolulu', 'had', 'already', 'supplied', 'needed', 'intel', 'months', 'models', 'mock-ups', 'were', 'already', 'use', 'Japan', 'Further', 'preposterousness', 'lay', 'fact', 'one', 'not', 'even', 'star', 'could', 'influence', 'filming', 'locations', 'Hollywood', 'old', 'studio', 'system', 'lastly', 'given', 'theproduction', 'Dive', 'Bomber', 'one', 'wonder', 'how', 'movie', 'shot', 'entirely', 'location', 'SAN', 'DIEGO', 'could', 'possibly', 'offer', 'up', 'useful', 'intelligence', 'PEARL', 'HARBOR', 'rate', 'one', 'looking', 'family', 'SBD', 'footage', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'movie', 'Dive', 'Bomber', 'what', 'are', 'looking']",N/A
