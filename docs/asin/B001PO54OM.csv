I originally figured to purchase The Searchers only, but when I came upon this collection, I knew I had heard of &#34;The Cowboys&#34; and really wanted to see it, too.  Both movies blew me away.  The Searchers clearly influenced The Outlaw Jose Wales and Unforgiven.  A real classic in the genre.  The Cowboys gave a look at an aging Duke and Bruce Dern gives his most sinister performance and by that, I do mean sinister.  Fort Apache shows another side to the Duke as he is not in charge.  Henry Fonda probably should not have been in charge as we see later on, but the Duke does play second fiddle and he does it well.  And of course, Rio Bravo is the ultimate John Wayne western.

It is rare when you find a movie set collection which has all the films as classics.  This set is absolutely fantastic because it has &#34;the Cowboys&#34; which is about John Wayne supervising a group of very young cowboys on a cattle drive.  The second one, &#34; For Apache&#34; is also a classic with John Wayne as a Calvary officer along with Henry Fonda.The third movie is also one of my favorite movies. Rio Bravo stars John Wayne, Ricky Nelson and Dean Martin.  The final selection is a true classic western which is one of the best movies of all time starring John Wayne who just got back from fighting in the civil war and winds up searching many years for his kidnapped niece who had been captured by the Indians when she was a small child.If you are a true western fan who does not have this 4-western movie classic set, you may want to check it out.
