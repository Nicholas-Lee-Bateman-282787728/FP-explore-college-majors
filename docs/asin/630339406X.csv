What an extraordinary job he did of conveying childhood as an adult.  There are too many moments of brilliance (of both hilarity and poignance) in this performance to pinpoint; I'll just say instead that the shot of the boy in a man's clothes near the end brought tears to my eyes when I first saw it (not to Hanks' credit but director Penny Marshall's).Spoiler:I like this movie enough, though, to be disturbed by what I felt was a bit of post-production tinkering in an attempt to soften the melancholy ending.  I'm convinced that when Hanks and Perkins are walking away from the camera on the boardwalk, what we hear them say as he puts his arm around her was dubbed afterwards; it only served to assure us that she would &quot;be OK&quot; in the end.  The moment itself would have felt right played without dialogue.  Likewise, the voices of the boy and his mother in the house at the end felt a bit contrived.  And -- this is what I've heard from others as well -- the lovely shot of Perkins' car driving off into the distance over the &quot;School Crossing&quot; sign on the road should have been the fadeout; the two boys walking away together felt anticlimactic.  Whenever I watch it, I always either stop the tape or change the channel before that image appears.

372003,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,630339406X,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","The fact that I absolutely adore this movie comes as a huge shock to me since Tom Hanks is one of those actors I find completely overrated.  There are really only a handful of his films I can even attest to enjoying (`Cast Away', shockingly, as well as `Saving Private Ryan') but for the most part I find his work a tad overrated (ala `Forest Gump' and `Philadelphia').  `Big', of all of Hanks' work, is probably my favorite.  It is most definitely my favorite performance he's ever given and honestly this very performance may cause me to rethink everything I've already concluded about this Hollywood icon.Penny Marshal's extremely successful family hit `Big' tells the story of twelve-year-old Josh, a kid tired of being a kid who makes a hasty wish to be an adult and winds up getting exactly what he wished for, with mixed results.  Unable to explain what happened to him, Josh takes off from home until he can sort things out.  This leaves him alone and confused and his parents distraught and heartbroken.  Soon Josh starts to adjust, quite well at that.  He lands himself a high profile job, acquires a very nice apartment and ends up dating a beautiful coworker.While everything may seem to be going in the right direction, `Big' ever so delicately asks whether or not a normal childhood is worth giving up.The script is beautifully written; in such a way that one can't help but relate to the main characters and become a part of their story.  This is also hinged strongly on Hanks' masterful performance.  He really adapts the mannerisms and mental wavelength of a child of twelve and exhibits those characteristics perfectly.  He becomes Josh (thanks to some great method acting from what I hear) and thus sells us on a rather preposterous story.The rest of the cast also delivers strongly here, especially the likes of Elizabeth Perkins and Robert Loggia.  Perkins plays Josh's love interest Susan with ample amounts curiosity and admiration.  She becomes a believable woman, a believable lover.  Robert Loggia doesn't have a lot of screen time, but he is love for me here.  Seriously, his little piano-key dancing scene with Hanks is my favorite scene in the film, and the look on his face is that look of found boyishness that just exudes such presence.  John Heard nails the egotistical corporate climber as Paul, Josh's nemeses.  He is the memorable villain, the guy you love to hate.Young actor Jared Rushton (of `Honey I Shrunk the Kids' fame) delivers a fine performance as well here, matching Hanks almost every step of the way; and Mercedes Ruehl's tortured mother is touching and heartbreaking all at the same time.What is so great about `Big' is that it manages to be lighthearted and warm while still tackling a big message.  It never waters down its message or makes light of it in order to sell itself as a family `fluff' film but instead creates a very touching and moving experience that makes us think and laugh at the same time.  While I feel that there is something extremely `wrong' with this film (I just had this shiver go down my spine when I realized that Josh and Susan, you know, did `it') I can't help but love it despite its questionable deviance from morality.  I'm not picking just so you know, and I understand that it is a `movie', but come on; you can't tell me that the fact that he was twelve didn't just hit you with unease.Anyways...Penny Marshall is one of our great female directors today.  She knows how to make a memorable and tender film (if you don't believe me then watch `Awakenings' and call me after you dry your tear drenched face) and `Big' is no exception.  Probably her biggest hit (although I think I prefer `Awakenings') and one of her most widely acclaimed motion pictures, `Big' is truly one of a kind.  Hanks outdoes himself here and truly changes my perception of his career.",5,One great big fun filled movie watching experience...,1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,3845,"['fact', 'absolutely', 'movie', 'huge', 'shock', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'one', 'actors', 'find', 'completely', 'overrated', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'handful', 'films', 'can', 'even', 'attest', 'enjoying', 'Cast', 'Away', 'shockingly', 'as', 'well', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'most', 'part', 'find', 'work', 'tad', 'overrated', 'ala', 'Forest', 'Gump', 'Philadelphia', 'Big', 'Hanks', 'work', 'probably', 'favorite', 'most', 'definitely', 'favorite', 'performance', 'ever', 'given', 'honestly', 'very', 'performance', 'may', 'cause', 'rethink', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'already', 'concluded', 'Hollywood', 'icon.Penny', 'Marshal', 'extremely', 'successful', 'family', 'hit', 'Big', 'story', 'twelve-year-old', 'Josh', 'kid', 'tired', 'being', 'kid', 'who', 'hasty', 'wish', 'be', 'adult', 'up', 'getting', 'exactly', 'what', 'wished', 'mixed', 'results', 'Unable', 'explain', 'what', 'happened', 'Josh', 'home', 'can', 'sort', 'things', 'out', 'alone', 'confused', 'parents', 'distraught', 'heartbroken', 'Soon', 'Josh', 'adjust', 'quite', 'well', 'high', 'profile', 'job', 'very', 'nice', 'apartment', 'up', 'dating', 'beautiful', 'coworker.While', 'everything', 'may', 'seem', 'be', 'going', 'right', 'direction', 'Big', 'ever', 'so', 'delicately', 'not', 'normal', 'childhood', 'worth', 'giving', 'up.The', 'script', 'beautifully', 'written', 'way', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'relate', 'main', 'characters', 'become', 'part', 'story', 'also', 'hinged', 'strongly', 'Hanks', 'masterful', 'performance', 'really', 'mannerisms', 'mental', 'wavelength', 'child', 'twelve', 'exhibits', 'characteristics', 'perfectly', 'Josh', 'thanks', 'great', 'method', 'acting', 'what', 'hear', 'thus', 'rather', 'preposterous', 'story.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'strongly', 'here', 'especially', 'likes', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'Perkins', 'Josh', 'love', 'interest', 'Susan', 'ample', 'amounts', 'curiosity', 'admiration', 'believable', 'woman', 'believable', 'lover', 'Robert', 'Loggia', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'love', 'here', 'Seriously', 'little', 'piano-key', 'dancing', 'scene', 'Hanks', 'favorite', 'scene', 'film', 'look', 'face', 'look', 'found', 'boyishness', 'just', 'exudes', 'such', 'presence', 'John', 'Heard', 'egotistical', 'corporate', 'climber', 'Paul', 'Josh', 'nemeses', 'memorable', 'villain', 'guy', 'love', 'hate.Young', 'actor', 'Jared', 'Rushton', 'Honey', 'Shrunk', 'Kids', 'fame', 'fine', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'here', 'matching', 'Hanks', 'almost', 'step', 'way', 'Mercedes', 'Ruehl', 'tortured', 'mother', 'touching', 'heartbreaking', 'same', 'so', 'great', 'Big', 'be', 'lighthearted', 'warm', 'while', 'still', 'tackling', 'big', 'message', 'never', 'down', 'message', 'light', 'order', 'sell', 'family', 'fluff', 'film', 'instead', 'very', 'touching', 'moving', 'experience', 'think', 'laugh', 'same', 'time', 'feel', 'something', 'extremely', 'wrong', 'film', 'just', 'had', 'shiver', 'go', 'down', 'spine', 'when', 'realized', 'Josh', 'Susan', 'know', 'did', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'questionable', 'deviance', 'morality', ""'m"", 'not', 'picking', 'just', 'so', 'know', 'understand', 'movie', 'come', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'fact', 'was', 'twelve', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'hit', 'unease.Anyways', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'one', 'great', 'female', 'directors', 'today', 'how', 'make', 'memorable', 'tender', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'then', 'watch', 'Awakenings', 'call', 'dry', 'tear', 'drenched', 'face', 'Big', 'exception', 'Probably', 'biggest', 'hit', 'think', 'prefer', 'Awakenings', 'one', 'most', 'widely', 'acclaimed', 'motion', 'pictures', 'Big', 'truly', 'one', 'kind', 'Hanks', 'outdoes', 'here', 'truly', 'changes', 'perception', 'career']",Big VHS

Tom Hanks in ""Big"" is as funny as in Forrest Gump, as touching as ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" and as goofy as ""Turner and Hooch."" You see the beginnings of the star of ""Castaway,"" ""Apollo 13,"" and ""Catch Me If You Can."" Hanks took on a solid movie and made it a great one.The story is simple, based on classic plotlines that extend back through fairy tales. Josh, the boy, is bummed his life is dictated by his small size and young age. He is unexpectedly granted his wish to be 'big', which means 30 years old. He then faces the adventures of being a grown-up.Scenes from this movie are famous, including the FAO Schwarz toy store dance on the keyboard floor mat. It has everything a vaudeville skit would have, from music to dance to the mix of an old and young man. It works incredibly well. Chopsticks has never been as entertaining.Josh becomes by serendipity the VP of toy development. Despite his immaturity, the owner feels Josh is tuned into the pulse of youth, unlike the lackeys cranking out marketing reports. His colleagues become jealous of his fast rise and unsuccessfully try to root him out. One of those trying to learn his game is Susan, but he wins her over in a confusing escapade of love.The movie is an overall pile of fun, but lacks in a few areas. It is dated, very stuck in the 1980s. That is tolerable. Had Josh been kidnapped, why wasn't his boyhood friend interviewed by police? Why didn't Josh ever confide in Susan while they fell in love?

Of course this movie is proof that he's a pretty darn good comedian too!Ah, being a kid again.  Wouldn't you love to go back to your early teenage years?  Yes, you would.  Rediscover what the world was like at such a young age without worrying about bills, your health or your future?  Back when friendships were in full swing, and relationships seemed like a thing that would never happen to you.  Back then your only *real* worries were turning in your homework assignments so Mrs. Raymond wouldn't get upset.Oh who am I kidding- I never grew up!  I'm living this fantastic life every single waking moment, haha!All joking aside (though I'm not actually joking about that- I'm a little kid in a grown mans body!) Big is a welcome addition to any movie library.  The glowing 5-star reviews you see here on amazon are no mistake ladies and gentlemen- this film will have you wishing you were young again.I have nothing but overwhelmingly positive things to say about Big.  I just love watching a 30-year old man (the same age as me, coincidentally) having the absolute time of his life acting childish, and totally enjoying himself.  You will see Tom Hanks playing pinball and getting into hissy fits, having fun with a pinball machine, and squirting silly string at his best friend.Of course the storyline is that he works for a company that comes up with toy inventions, and well... isn't THAT a fitting job for a child living inside a full grown mans body?  hahaHe finds a woman at his workplace and they hit off a great relationship.  He actually manages to get the woman to loosen up and stop acting so darn serious all the time!  Have some fun!  Jump on the trampoline with the lights on and the window blinds open!Before any of these major changes take place however, the character of Tom Hanks finds a magical wishing machine while visiting a carnival with his family.  Well this machine surely made one of his wishes come true- to be big.Now the ending... I guess it's a pretty good ending.  Perhaps it felt a little undeveloped/anticlimactic for my tastebuds, because I was assuming he'd go to sleep, wake up and be young again.  Nopers!Overall, enjoy Big.

372016,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,630339406X,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[4, 4]","The film that propelled Tom Hanks to superstar status, Big is one of the funniest and most friendly films to ever hit the big screen. Harboring its own unique charm, the movie wraps a unique and compelling storyline around a cast of likeable characters to create a film audiences will never forget. Director Penny Marshall became the first woman to direct a film grossing over one-hundred million dollars when Big was first released in 1988 (that's an actual Trivial Pursuit question I ran across that might come in handy someday)...When a young suburban boy named Josh (David Moscow) attends a local carnival with his family, his young life is turned upside down when the girl he has a crush on is allowed on a rollercoaster while he learns that he is still too young. Distraught, the boy makes a wish on an antique magic wish arcade machine. He wishes he was big, and the machine spits out its answer on a small piece of cardboard, ""Wish granted."" Josh thinks nothing of the reply until he wakes up the next morning as an adult version of himself (Tom Hanks).Run out of the house by his own mother, Josh turns to his best friend Billy (Jared Rushton) for help. But after convincing his friend, who's only ten-years-old himself, Billy can't provide much help except a small bit of cash and advice on getting a job. When Josh rents an apartment in New York City, Billy comes to visit him periodically. Playing guns in the toy store FAO Schwartz, the two run into MacMillan (Robert Loggia) founder of a toy manufacturer. MacMillan hits it off with Josh (the two men step dance a Chopin tune on a giant foot-operated piano in an extremely memorable and famous scene), and the toy titan immediately hires Josh to work for his company in the area of toy-related research.Climbing the corporate totem pole at MacMillan because of his vast insight into the toy preferences of kids, Josh befriends Susan (Elizabeth Perkins), a top-level executive hoping to learn what makes Josh such a master of the boardroom. But Susan's pursuit of Josh is not looked upon favorably by her colleague Paul (John Heard) who's spent his entire career kissing up to MacMillan only to have the inexperienced Josh appear out of nowhere and become the boss's favorite. This conflict, coupled with the breakdown of Josh and Billy's relationship, causes the adult kid to wish he could be his young self once again...One of the best scenes in the film is when Susan reveals to Josh that she can't believe she's considering sleeping over at his home. Josh replies by saying he does it all the time and gives her the option of the top or the bottom bunk! Hanks really comes off as a kid trapped in an adult's body, and that's why Big works so well. So well, in fact, that it became an instant comedy classic...Prior to Sleepless In Seattle, Forrest Gump, and Saving Private Ryan, Tom Hanks took Hollywood by storm with his charming performance in this larger than life movie. Big is a feel-good comedy without any foul language, gratuitous violence, or endless explosions. It simply retells the timeless tale of a young boy who wishes he were grown and doing grown up things - only in this instance, the kid gets his wish. As one of the biggest blockbusters of the 1980s, Big is a definite must-see film.

It has so many charming elements you could write a book describing them all. I've seen it a million times, so it seems. Undortunately, when you watch any given movie that much you catch the flaws. Most have already probably been pointed out but there's a glaring one that I think is subtle yet the greatest.Compare Hank's character portrayal to Forrest Gump and you find many similarities. But this man-child in Big isn't borderline 'retarded', he's a 13 year old boy. That said, does Hanks play a convincing 13 year old? When we compare his performance to a real one (his best friend in the movie) it's sad to say Hanks actually acts more like an 8 year old throughout, and what's more is everyone falls for it. It's one thing to offset an ironic childish maneuver or statement with a sly grin or chuckle, it's another to never do so and hence act like a retarded man or eight year old child. Hank's charachter never shows the wit to suggest to other adults that he isn't just being ironic and I don't think any adult would take him seriously the way they took Peter Sellers' Clancy gardener character in the movie 'Being There'. Sorry to point it out.But if you ignore this and focus on the fantasy, well, this movie is a sweet sentimental treat about the child in all of us.",5,Enjoy and try to ignore the details,1364860800,"04 2, 2013",2013,1371,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'movie', 'am', 'still', 'entertained', 'when', 'watch', 'so', 'many', 'charming', 'elements', 'could', 'write', 'book', 'describing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'million', 'times', 'Undortunately', 'when', 'watch', 'given', 'movie', 'much', 'catch', 'flaws', 'Most', 'have', 'already', 'probably', 'been', 'pointed', 'out', 'glaring', 'one', 'think', 'subtle', 'yet', 'greatest.Compare', 'Hank', 'character', 'portrayal', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'find', 'many', 'similarities', 'man-child', 'Big', ""n't"", 'borderline', ""'retarded"", '13', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'said', 'Hanks', 'play', 'convincing', '13', 'year', 'old', 'When', 'compare', 'performance', 'real', 'one', 'best', 'friend', 'movie', 'sad', 'say', 'Hanks', 'actually', 'more', '8', 'year', 'old', 'what', 'more', 'everyone', 'one', 'thing', 'offset', 'ironic', 'childish', 'maneuver', 'statement', 'sly', 'grin', 'chuckle', 'never', 'do', 'so', 'hence', 'act', 'retarded', 'man', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'child', 'Hank', 'charachter', 'never', 'wit', 'suggest', 'other', 'adults', ""n't"", 'just', 'being', 'ironic', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'adult', 'would', 'take', 'seriously', 'way', 'took', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Clancy', 'gardener', 'character', 'movie', ""'Being"", 'Sorry', 'point', 'out.But', 'ignore', 'focus', 'fantasy', 'well', 'movie', 'sweet', 'sentimental', 'treat', 'child']",Big VHS

What it does have is higher picture quality and sound. There are details I hadn't noticed before. Is it worth this purchase? That all depends on how much of a home theater buff you are. If you want blu-ray quality video and audio, then you will most likely want to upgrade this classic 1988 flick; otherwise, you might be content to hold onto your DVD version until something significantly better comes out.When it was first released in 1988, ""Big"" instantly became one of my favorite films. 20 years later, I can still say the same thing. This film not only ""holds up"" well, it is still a timeless classic. It is the story of 12 year old Josh Baskin, who wishes he were ""big"" after being humiliated at a carnival for not being tall enough to ride an attraction in front of the classmate that he has a crush on. His wish is granted by the arcade machine, Zoltar, and the next morning, he wakes up as a 30 year old (Tom Hanks). He's kicked out of the house by his mother, who thinks he is a pervert who has broken in. To make matters worse, he can't reverse the wish for at least another 30 days. On the advice of his best buddy, Billy (Jared Rushton), he gets a job in New York City to pass the time and earn some money to live on. Josh quickly moves up the ladder at MacMillan Toy Company, and also attracts the attention of Susan Lawrence (Elizabeth Perkins), who has made a habit of sleeping with the new up-and-coming executives. The longer he inhabits his 30-year old body, the more he grows away from his childhood buddy, Billy. However, the day of reckoning eventually comes when he must make a choice.Hanks & Perkins give outstanding performances; instead of ""playing"" a 12 year old, Hanks actually becomes one. His innocence is totally believable. Perkins plays the part of the ambitious Susan to perfection, and she is the perfect love interest for Hanks. Talk about chemistry!Just like its DVD counterpart, the Blu-Ray version gives you 2 versions of the movie; one is the theatrical version, and the other is an Extended Cut (note: NOT a director's cut...just an extra 20 minutes or so added back in). Skip the extended version; it adds nothing, and if anything slows the pacing down and adds sub plots that are meaningless (example: Billy's shrewish mother, played by Frances Fisher). The picture is wonderful; good detail and color. Sound is a DTS-HD Lossless Master Audio 5.1 Surround track (48kHz/24-bit) that sounds pleasing, but other than the Billy Idol ""Hot in the City"" Limo scene, doesn't really get much of a chance to shine. Video is presented in a remastered 1080p/AVC MPEG-4 transfer (1.85:1) and looks very good but won't blow your socks off. Extras are all presented in 480i/MPEG-2.There is an interesting ""commentary"" track by the writers/creators of ""Big,"" Gary Ross & Anne Spielberg. Although extremely interesting, this would have been better as an audio-only supplement. A nice commentary that corresponds with the picture by director Marshall or Hanks would have been better. The track consists of current interviews with Ross & Spielberg (yes, Steven's sister) who introduce vintage audio tapes that they made while they brainstormed the idea of what would become ""Big."" The tapes do not correspond to what you see on your screen. Yes, it is interesting, but after awhile, it gets somewhat annoying having to listen to Gary continually talk over Anne and not letting her ideas be heard. It does appear that much of the movie that we know and love came from Anne, who quietly (and thankfully) persisted with her vision.Deleted scenes with commentary by director Penny Marshall (but if you watch the extended cut, none of these will be new for you). For one of her first movies, she does an excellent job. As did Anne, she had a vision of what the film and especially Hanks' performance should be and she stuck with it, despite the risks (example: at least 3 other age-change movies were ready for release before ""Big"" would be finished). There are a number of featurettes: ""Big Beginnings"", ""Chemistry of a Classic"", AMC Backstory, ""The Work of Play,"" and ""Carnival Party Newswrap"" (a vintage film showing the wrap party for ""Big.""). There is a fair amount of overlap in all the extras, as Marshall, Ross, and Spielberg are the main contributors. Still, plenty of interesting tidbits; we came this close to seeing Robert DeNiro in the lead role. It is also interesting to hear the young stars of the film, David Moscow (young Josh) and Jared Rushton, discuss the filming. Perkins also gives some fun insights as well. Theatrical trailer and TV Spots round out this edition.If Blu-ray is to succeed, then some of the other studios besides Disney need to really step up to the plate and offer something that takes advantage of the format, rather than just shuffling over material from previously released DVD's. Disney puts most of their extras in high-def as well, whereas Fox and other studios seem content to only upgrade the movie itself.While it`s good to see ""Big"" on Blu-ray, I wouldn't recommend that people rush right out to buy this one.",4,Same features as DVD special edition,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,5207,"['haveBig', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'then', 'will', 'see', 'new', 'Blu-ray',

He projects the awkwardness and innocence of youth well and is supported by a good screenplay that makes the most of this fantastic situation.  Screenwriters Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg had the inspiration to place this naive, goodhearted character among the competitive, cut-throat yuppies on the staff of a major toy company.  Josh's insights into what appeals to kids (after all, he really is one) allows him to advance rapidly, much to the dismay of his coworkers, who see in his every action the same kind of manipulation and scheming that enabled them to reach their positions.  The juxtaposition makes Josh seem like the real grown-up and provides an interesting opportunity to appreciate how important it is to hang on to some of our more child-like qualities as we grow older./",4,Charming fantasy,999820800,"09 7, 2001",2001,920,"['Tom', 'Hanks', 'terrific', 'film', 'Josh', 'Baskin', 'twelve-year-old', 'boy', 'who', 'been', 'transformed', 'physically', 'adult', 'projects', 'awkwardness', 'innocence', 'youth', 'well', 'supported', 'good', 'screenplay', 'most', 'fantastic', 'situation', 'Screenwriters', 'Gary', 'Ross', 'Anne', 'Spielberg', 'had', 'inspiration', 'place', 'naive', 'goodhearted', 'character', 'competitive', 'cut-throat', 'yuppies', 'staff', 'major', 'toy', 'company', 'Josh', 'insights', 'what', 'appeals', 'kids', 'really', 'one', 'advance', 'rapidly', 'much', 'dismay', 'coworkers', 'who', 'see', 'action', 'same', 'kind', 'manipulation', 'scheming', 'enabled', 'reach', 'positions', 'juxtaposition', 'Josh', 'seem', 'real', 'grown-up', 'interesting', 'opportunity', 'appreciate', 'how', 'important', 'hang', 'more', 'child-like', 'qualities', 'grow', 'older./']",Big VHS

You now know him as the serious, dramatic, critical darling of reviewers and the Academy Awards.  This is the Tom Hanks who first got notice from the Oscars back in the late 80s, and he is no less spectacular than the Hanks of Saving Private Ryan, Philadelphia, Apollo 13, or Castaway.Young Josh, who actually is young in the beginning of the film, longs for the day when he will be an adult--&quot;big.&quot;  In an odd tempting of fate, his wish is granted, and he wakes up as Hanks.  Hanks, still holding the mind and emotions of the young teen Josh, must now make it in the world as an adult, despite the fact he is anything but.For his acting challenge, the adult becomes a child, and experiences all the awkwardness of that child becoming the adult he in fact already is.  Of course, his boyish good looks make the visible factor already easy for the audience to believe, but it is the mindset of wonderment, innocence, matter-of-factness, and uneasiness which brings the &quot;young&quot; Josh to life.Some of the most memorable moments of film from this time period come from Big.  The FAO Schwartz scenes involving an oversized keyboard, and the eating of baby corn ears immediately come to mind.  Directed by Penny Marshall, Tom Hanks easily convinced us of an impossible scenario, and pulled on our heartstrings while doing it. The most telling scene of his complete ability to achieve 'youth' is when he finds himself completely alone in a seedy motel, frightened out of his mind, crying himself to sleep to drown out the noise of the scary city outside the thin door.  Amazing!This is a sweet charmer of a film, and this performance is right up there with the best of his catalogue, as well as Marshall's.

Josh manages to luck into a highly ranked position at a toy company and even cluelessly ends up with a hot girlfriend (the very grown up Elizabeth Perkins). With only his 13 year-old best friend Billy as a confidant, Josh must navigate thru the minefield of burdens and hangups (eking out a livelihood, the pressure and jealousies in the work area, adult relationships, etc) normally associated with growing up. Josh, thru the course of the film, comes to realize he isn't ready to be a grown-up and that being a kid is actually a pretty cool thing to be. Now, if he could only find that dang fortune telling machine.Tom Hanks delightfully channels his inner kid in this modern fairy tale. I really can't think of anyone else who could've been as convincing and charming as Hanks in portraying a grown-up with the mind of an adolescent. Elizabeth Perkins, as the very poised but baffled Susan Lawrence, effectively plays her role as initially calculating but, by the film's closing scenes, she'll end up tugging at your heartstrings. Robert Loggia, as Mr. MacMillan, the elderly but young-at-heart owner and head honcho of the MacMillan Toys Company, is disarming and infectious (in the good sense, not in the sense that he'll give you a disease). Everyone touts the ""Chopsticks"" scene with Loggia and Hanks as a classic standout of the film.Big ties with A League of Their Own as Penny Marshall's best directing effort. There's a reason Big made Marshall the first female director to surpass $100 million in the box office. She not only elicits very nice performances from her cast but she also injects into her film wholesome humor and warmth, a tastefully done romantic arc, and an insightful perspective about what it's like to be mired in adulthood and how, sometimes, we grownups are all either just going thru the motions or taking life too seriously.The only thing I found disquieting is the kidnapping subplot, which introduces a jarring element and clashes with the overall gentle tone of the film. The script handles it as discreetly and as ""kid-gloves"" as possible, but one can't help but empathize with the mostly off-screen grieving mother. And that's my only quibble.If you enjoy this film, I recommend 13 Going on 30 (Jennifer Garner is almost as good as Hanks), if you haven't seen it yet. And if you like Elizabeth Perkins, check out the romantic comedy He Said, She Said, where Ms. Perkins has never been better.",5,"""What's a marketing report?""",1154908800,"08 7, 2006",2006,3003,"['Josh', 'Baskin', '13', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'David', 'Moscow', 'suffering', 'inequities', 'being', 'too', 'young', 'small', 'have', 'control', 'life', 'girl', 'dating', 'bigger', 'older', 'boy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'carnival', 'ride', ""n't"", 'reach', 'minimum', 'required', 'height', 'Zoltar', 'spooky', 'fortune', 'telling', 'machine', 'impulsively', 'wishes', 'were', 'big', 'wish', 'granted', 'Josh', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'transformed', '30', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'Tom', 'Hanks', '.But', 'bastardize', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'famous', 'line', 'big', 'body', 'big', 'responsibility', 'Josh', 'luck', 'highly', 'ranked', 'position', 'toy', 'company', 'even', 'cluelessly', 'up', 'hot', 'girlfriend', 'very', 'grown', 'up', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'only', '13', 'year-old', 'best', 'friend', 'Billy', 'confidant', 'Josh', 'must', 'navigate', 'minefield', 'burdens', 'hangups', 'eking', 'out', 'livelihood', 'pressure', 'jealousies', 'work', 'area', 'adult', 'relationships', 'etc', 'normally', 'associated', 'growing', 'up', 'Josh', 'course', 'film', 'realize', ""n't"", 'ready', 'be', 'grown-up', 'being', 'kid', 'actually', 'pretty', 'cool', 'thing', 'be', 'Now', 'could', 'only', 'find', 'dang', 'fortune', 'telling', 'machine.Tom', 'Hanks', 'delightfully', 'inner', 'kid', 'modern', 'fairy', 'tale', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'convincing', 'charming', 'Hanks', 'portraying', 'grown-up', 'mind', 'adolescent', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'very', 'poised', 'baffled', 'Susan', 'Lawrence', 'effectively', 'role', 'initially', 'calculating', 'film', 'closing', 'scenes', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'tugging', 'heartstrings', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'Mr.', 'MacMillan', 'elderly', 'young-at-heart', 'owner', 'head', 'honcho', 'MacMillan', 'Toys', 'Company', 'disarming', 'infectious', 'good', 'sense', 'not', 'sense', ""'ll"", 'give', 'disease', 'Everyone', 'Chopsticks', 'scene', 'Loggia', 'Hanks', 'classic', 'standout', 'film.Big', 'ties', 'A', 'League', 'Their', 'Own', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'best', 'directing', 'effort', 'reason', 'Big', 'made', 'Marshall', 'first', 'female', 'director', 'surpass', '100', 'million', 'box', 'office', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'nice', 'performances', 'cast', 'also', 'film', 'wholesome', 'humor', 'warmth', 'tastefully', 'done', 'romantic', 'arc', 'insightful', 'perspective', 'what', 'be', 'mired', 'adulthood', 'how', 'sometimes', 'grownups', 'are', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'taking', 'life', 'too', 'only', 'thing', 'found', 'disquieting', 'kidnapping', 'subplot', 'jarring', 'element', 'clashes', 'overall', 'gentle', 'tone', 'film', 'script', 'discreetly', 'kid-gloves', 'possible', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'empathize', 'mostly', 'off-screen', 'grieving', 'mother', 'only', 'quibble.If', 'enjoy', 'film', 'recommend', '13', 'Going', '30', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'Hanks', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'like', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'check', 'out', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Said', 'Said', 'where', 'Ms.', 'Perkins', 'never', 'been', 'better']",Big VHS

It doesn't have that sharpness that makes modern blu-rays amazingly detailed, but it's not needed or missed. Watching this is like watching it in a theater. If your TV or player has a Cinema or Movie mode (which mutes colors and/or softens the picture) turn it off. The movie already has the ""soft"" cinema look those modes induce. That being said, the colors are absolutely perfect, and it's hard to take your eyes away; especially if you've seen this before. The blacks are always inky, and overall there are never speckling or noise artifacts.The sound is punched up to modern standards as well (see below) and sounds amazing in surround (considering how the previous releases sounded). It's up to modern day standards for a drama/comedy. Dialog is clear and easy to understand, and surround and L/R components are present only when appropriate, not just to show off surround technology. But when it does kick in (for scenes with music, etc.), it's enveloping. Definitely up to par with modern movies.You have a choice of the regular or extended edition. The extended edition is fun. I've seen this movie many times, and the extra/extended scenes make it a lot of fun, since you never know when they're going to occur. Overall, if this is currently, or ever has been one of your favorites, you need to get it, even if you have it on DVD.

It amazes me how well he interprets being a young boy in a man's 30 year old body.  The young boy is named Josh Baskin (David Moskow), who has a crush on an older girl.  While at an amusement park, he is stunned to learn she is dating  a boy that is old enough to drive.  He leaves her in line for a ride, as he is disqualified for being too short for the thrill ride on a roller coaster.  Soon he makes a wish at a carnival ""Magic Seer"" machine.  It is an old machine and the robot inside looks devilish with red flashing eyes.  Josh wishes to only be ""big"" and receives a card from the machine saying his wish will be granted.  He goes to sleep that night at home in a room shared with his baby sister and wakes up a grown man.  He is astounded and frightened as well.  When he tries to tell his mother he grew up overnight, she screams and becomes panicky - and thinks this man has stolen her boy.Josh realizes he can't go back home until he returns to his normal size.  So the next day he travels with his 12 year old friend with the mission to find the same machine that can fix his wish to be a boy again.  Because of his youthful mind, he gets a job in a toy company and moves up fast as he knows what toys kids like, and what to make that will sell.  He has to adjust to adult ways, and Hanks plays the role to the hilt!  Hanks, as Josh,  also plays the best childlike romantic lead with a woman (Elizabeth Perkins - who looks like a young Judy Garland).  I laughed as he tried to eat cocktail corn at a party.  His apartment was nothing but a playground and the whole story was fresh and appealing.  What fun to be young at heart and be paid for it.

372089,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,630339406X,Martin Asiner,"[1, 1]","Every kid has dreams of what it would be like to grow up. Usually these thoughts revolve around the material things in life, most of which include adult-type possessions like money, girls, and cars. In director Penny Marshall's BIG, Tom Hanks gives an eminently believable performance as a 13 year old boy who makes the full circle from boy to man and back to boy. Although the audience has great fun with the many truly funny scenes, the real charm of the film is not the humor of a fish out of water but the growth of a boy who has a glimpse of what it is to be a man and yet can possess the wisdom to recognize that he is not ready to permanently stay an adult if it means losing the experience that should have accompanied that growth.The youth Josh Baskin (David Moscow) makes a wish to be an adult at one of those carny magic fortune teller machines. Right away the audience is swooped into one of two realms: the benign universe of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE or the more malignant one of the TWILIGHT ZONE where William Shatner is fed life- altering decisions by a machine that could be a clone of this one. But BIG is a sweet comedy and the audience can sense that there will indeed be comic complexities caused by Josh's getting his wish in a literal way that provides unexpected consequences.Josh, now played by Tom Hanks, uses his charm, his youth, his zest for things juvenile to land an adult job. The core of the comedy revolves around a succession of scenes that requires a delicate balancing act for Hanks. He must try to act like an adult but still retain the mannerisms of a child. The best scenes in which he accomplishes this include the dancing on the piano scene with Robert Loggia and the more adult relationship he forges with Elizabeth Perkins, who falls for the child that she sees in the man. No one else in Hollywood could have pulled this off.Josh builds a life as an adult. He has all the 'toys' that he thought all adults did, but inwardly his child rebels, causing him to want to experience life but not on the cheap. Experience, he learns, is dear, and it is not enough for others to give him credit for accomplishments that they presume is the result of a more natural emotional and physical accumulation of experience. Rather, he learns that life is sort of like those goofy electronic make-up-your-life-as-you-go toys that he developed as a marketing whiz. You can push a button and get the desired result, but once having done so, the reality on the screen does not match the reality in the heart. And for the young Josh or the old Josh or the audience, this is a very adult lesson indeed.",5,Big: Growth is not Just a Physical Stage,1025395200,"06 30, 2002",2002,2621,"['kid', 'dreams', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'grow', 'up', 'Usually', 'thoughts', 'revolve', 'material', 'things', 'life', 'most', 'include', 'adult-type', 'possessions', 'money', 'girls', 'cars', 'director', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'BIG', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'eminently', 'believable', 'performance', '13', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'full', 'circle', 'boy', 'man', 'back', 'boy', 'audience', 'great', 'fun', 'many', 'truly', 'funny', 'scenes', 'real', 'charm', 'film', 'not', 'humor', 'fish', 'water', 'growth', 'boy', 'who', 'glimpse', 'what', 'be', 'man', 'yet', 'can', 'possess', 'wisdom', 'recognize', 'not', 'ready', 'permanently', 'stay', 'adult', 'losing', 'experience', 'should', 'have', 'accompanied', 'growth.The', 'youth', 'Josh', 'Baskin', 'David', 'Moscow', 'wish', 'be', 'adult', 'one', 'carny', 'magic', 'fortune', 'teller', 'machines', 'Right', 'away', 'audience', 'swooped', 'one', 'two', 'realms', 'benign', 'universe', 'IT', 'A', 'WONDERFUL', 'LIFE', 'more', 'malignant', 'one', 'TWILIGHT', 'ZONE', 'where', 'William', 'Shatner', 'fed', 'life-', 'altering', 'decisions', 'machine', 'could', 'be', 'clone', 'one', 'BIG', 'sweet', 'comedy', 'audience', 'can', 'sense', 'will', 'indeed', 'be', 'comic', 'complexities', 'caused', 'Josh', 'getting', 'wish', 'literal', 'way', 'unexpected', 'consequences.Josh', 'now', 'played', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'charm', 'youth', 'zest', 'things', 'juvenile', 'land', 'adult', 'job', 'core', 'comedy', 'around', 'succession', 'scenes', 'delicate', 'balancing', 'act', 'Hanks', 'must', 'try', 'act', 'adult', 'still', 'retain', 'mannerisms', 'child', 'best', 'scenes', 'include', 'dancing', 'piano', 'scene', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'more', 'adult', 'relationship', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'who', 'child', 'man', 'one', 'else', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off.Josh', 'life', 'adult', ""'toys"", 'thought', 'adults', 'did', 'inwardly', 'child', 'rebels', 'causing', 'want', 'experience', 'life', 'not', 'cheap', 'Experience', 'dear', 'not', 'enough', 'others', 'give', 'credit', 'accomplishments', 'presume', 'result', 'more', 'natural', 'emotional', 'physical', 'accumulation', 'experience', 'Rather', 'life', 'sort', 'goofy', 'electronic', 'make-up-your-life-as-you-go', 'toys', 'developed', 'marketing', 'whiz', 'can', 'push', 'button', 'get', 'desired', 'result', 'once', 'having', 'done', 'so', 'reality', 'screen', 'not', 'match', 'reality', 'heart', 'young', 'Josh', 'old', 'Josh', 'audience', 'very', 'adult', 'lesson', 'indeed']",Big VHS

Well, if you are a child, and have watched this movie, you have probably changed your mind by now! And if you're an adult, then you will identify with a lot in this movie.

Now you see them, and you see rubbish graphics, and you had to type what you wanted the characters to do - I remember those!

The mum isn't included as much, it would have been nice to maybe see Tom Hanks come back and see her again, instead of just phoning her. My other quibble is that it's only rated a PG - so much more could have been done with the movie, if it had been a 15, maybe NOT an 18.

He is one of the few actors who started off as a comic and made a successful transition to dramatic actor that was accepted by audiences and peers alike.  This was, I believe, his transition role that would lead him into his dramatic future.Tom Hanks plays Josh (as an adult).  Josh makes a wish on a carnival game that he were big.  The next day, he wakes up a 12 year old boy in a 30 year old's body.  Suddenly driven out of the house, he is now forced into the adult world overnight and must deal with all the hilarious adult things from a kid's perspective.It was a good movie, put into that catagory of ""feel good"", to be sure.  But, it was a little too hooky for my tastes now.  When he wakes up a 30 year old man, how would he ever get his own place to live, a job, and a girlfriend if he had the mind of a 12 year old?  In New York City, no less.  The scene in the toy store was cute, of course, and it just so happens that he gets a job working for a toy company.I recently read that they changed the ending.  The original ending was that he would make a wish on the same game to be 12 again, and, his girlfriend would also wish to be 12 with him.  Test audiences said they didn't want this to happen, they wanted them to split.

His wish is to be 'BIG'....and to his amazement wakes up the next morning with the body of a 30 year old. Confused and frightened at being thrust into the adult world, Josh (with the help of his best friend) runs away to New York, where by sheer luck he lands a job in a Toy company. There he discovers the advantages of being big: freedom,money,unlimited toys and junk food.

But it was kind of the same story as the movie &quot;Big&quot; with Tom Hanks.  I am looking for this movie, but I don't know the title of the movie anymore, so I was hoping by writing this review someone can tell me the title.The movie goes like this:  A sience-kid invents this machine to make things big, like a tomato.  His friend, who wants to be big, tries out the machine, and gets big/older.  I think that he goes to school to be a teacher, but I am not sure about that.  He falls in love with a woman who is also a teacher.  The sience-kid, his friend, tries to repair the machine in a way so that he can make things small again.  When he can, the big-kid goes back into the machine, and gets to be small/a kid again.  The great part about this movie is, that it has a happy end, the woman-teacher that he has fallen in love with also goes into the machine and also comes out as a kid.  When the kid goes back to school, he feels misserable, because he misses the woman and because he has a new teacher (the woman-teacher used to be his teacher, but then it happens the &quot;woman-teacher&quot; comes walking in the classroom as a kid, and sits next to him.If you have seen this movie or know this movie and still know the name of the movie, or who plays in it.

372128,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,630339406X,Steven Aldersley,"[2, 2]","I've been a fan of Tom Hanks ever since I saw Big, and I would say that it's the first Hanks performance that really made me aware that he could be more than someone who would only be remembered as a briefly popular comedic actor. Big is a comedy, but it contains plenty of scenes which rely on drama. It makes some good observations about childhood, friendship, relationships, and life itself.Josh Baskin (Hanks) is 12, and has a crush on someone at school. Unfortunately, he has no chance because her boyfriend can drive. After a failed attempt to sit next to her on a fairground ride, Josh makes a wish on a Zoltar machine; he wants to be big. A card informs him that his wish has been granted, and he wakes up the next morning as an adult. While that sounds like utter nonsense, it provides an opportunity to show how a child in a man's body might interact with the world.We see Josh convince his friend, Billy (Jared Rushton), that he really is who he says he is. The two form a plan to track down a Zoltar machine so that Josh can wish to return to normal. While the pair wait for the information to arrive, Josh has to support himself. He likes computer games and manages to talk his way into working as a data processor at a toy company. I guess finding a job was easier in 1988 than it is today?The genius of the movie is in showing us how simple life can be when you're a child. Most adults become jaded when they realize the reality of working, the daily routine, and the struggle to pay for all the little luxuries that they covet. Josh attacks the world with the exuberance of a child. He does everything quickly and to the best of his ability, and his enthusiastic approach draws the attention of the Mr. MacMillan (Robert Loggia), who owns the company.Josh is promoted fast, and is soon vice president of development. His apparent luck causes resentment among some of the employees, but Susan (Elizabeth Perkins) finds his approach attractive. The two enter into a relationship, but we can see that Josh doesn't have any idea how to behave around a woman who isn't his mother. Once again, his honest approach pays dividends, and Susan perceives his attitude as a refreshing change from the manipulative partner she last dated. In fact, his childish notions help unlock the child inside her, and she likes the feelings it evokes in her.The movie is definitely a feel-good piece, but it's more than just fluff. If you think about some of the messages, it's telling us just to take things at face value and enjoy life. Josh succeeds because he has no ulterior motives. We are regularly reminded about the importance of friendship, and how events in our lives can sometimes threaten our relationships with established friends when we find something or someone new that we think deserves our full attention. Of course, a good friend will forgive you for such indulgences.There have been so many movies about identity switches, and quite a few of them were made in the 80s. Big is better than all of the others because after the initial fantasy element, it contains a lot of incisive observations about human behavior. The casting elevates the movie to yet another level, and it's one I return to every couple of years.The story was written by Gary Ross, who had a hand in the writing of Seabiscuit, Pleasantville, and The Hunger Games. This is easily his best early effort and it deserves your time. The Blu-ray includes an extended cut, which adds 26 minutes to the movie, and it's my preferred version.",4,The best Tom Hanks performance from the 80s,1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,3514,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'ever', 'saw', 'Big', 'would', 'say', 'first', 'Hanks', 'performance', 'really', 'made', 'aware', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'remembered', 'briefly', 'popular', 'comedic', 'actor', 'Big', 'comedy', 'plenty', 'scenes', 'rely', 'drama', 'good', 'observations', 'childhood', 'friendship', 'relationships', 'life', 'itself.Josh', 'Baskin', 'Hanks', '12', 'crush', 'someone', 'school', 'Unfortunately', 'chance', 'boyfriend', 'can', 'drive', 'failed', 'attempt', 'sit', 'next', 'fairground', 'ride', 'Josh', 'wish', 'Zoltar', 'machine', 'be', 'big', 'card', 'wish', 'been', 'granted', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'adult', 'utter', 'nonsense', 'opportunity', 'show', 'how', 'child', 'man', 'body', 'might', 'interact', 'world.We', 'see', 'Josh', 'convince', 'friend', 'Billy', 'Jared', 'Rushton', 'really', 'who', 'two', 'form', 'plan', 'track', 'down', 'Zoltar', 'machine', 'Josh', 'can', 'wish', 'return', 'normal', 'pair', 'wait', 'information', 'arrive', 'Josh', 'support', 'computer', 'games', 'manages', 'talk', 'way', 'working', 'data', 'processor', 'toy', 'company', 'guess', 'finding', 'job', 'was', 'easier', '1988', 'today', 'genius', 'movie', 'showing', 'how', 'simple', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'when', ""'re"", 'child', 'Most', 'adults', 'become', 'jaded', 'when', 'realize', 'reality', 'working', 'daily', 'routine', 'struggle', 'pay', 'little', 'luxuries', 'covet', 'Josh', 'world', 'exuberance', 'child', 'everything', 'quickly', 'best', 'ability', 'enthusiastic', 'approach', 'attention', 'Mr.', 'MacMillan', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'who', 'company.Josh', 'promoted', 'fast', 'soon', 'vice', 'president', 'development', 'apparent', 'luck', 'resentment', 'employees', 'Susan', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'approach', 'attractive', 'two', 'enter', 'relationship', 'can', 'see', 'Josh', ""n't"", 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'behave', 'around', 'woman', 'who', ""n't"", 'mother', 'Once', 'again', 'honest', 'approach', 'dividends', 'Susan', 'attitude', 'refreshing', 'change', 'manipulative', 'partner', 'last', 'dated', 'fact', 'childish', 'notions', 'help', 'unlock', 'child', 'feelings', 'her.The', 'movie', 'definitely', 'feel-good', 'piece', 'more', 'just', 'fluff', 'think', 'messages', 'telling', 'just', 'take', 'things', 'face', 'value', 'enjoy', 'life', 'Josh', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'are', 'regularly', 'reminded', 'importance', 'friendship', 'how', 'events', 'lives', 'can', 'sometimes', 'threaten', 'relationships', 'established', 'friends', 'when', 'find', 'something', 'someone', 'new', 'think', 'full', 'attention', 'course', 'good', 'friend', 'will', 'forgive', 'such', 'indulgences.There', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'identity', 'switches', 'quite', 'few', 'were', 'made', '80s', 'Big', 'better', 'others', 'initial', 'fantasy', 'element', 'lot', 'incisive', 'observations', 'human', 'behavior', 'casting', 'movie', 'yet', 'level', 'one', 'return', 'couple', 'years.The', 'story', 'was', 'written', 'Gary', 'Ross', 'who', 'had', 'hand', 'writing', 'Seabiscuit', 'Pleasantville', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'easily', 'best', 'early', 'effort', 'time', 'Blu-ray', 'extended', 'cut', '26', 'minutes', 'movie', 'preferred', 'version']",Big VHS

372132,A3SFN5013RD3U0,630339406X,Terry Downey,"[1, 1]","I've had this movie (on VHS) since it was first released, and its on my Movies I Can't Stop Watching list.  Tom Hanks portrays a 13 year old boy, Josh, who wakes up in the body of a 30 year old man after wishing he were bigger after not being allowed on a carnival ride and being made fun of by a taller boy.  Although this theme is not unique, nobody but Tom Hanks ever gets it quite right.  Hanks obviously has not forgotten what it's like to be an adolescent boy, and the results are hilarious!  His reactions to adult situations (a really aweful tux at a formal party, making gagging noises and spitting out caviar, playing with all the buttons in the limousine, thinking his workmate just wants to SLEEP when she asks to stay overnight and innocently replying,""Well, ok, but I get to be on top"" -  meaning the top of his bunkbed) never fail to send me into fits of laughter. On the more serious side, Hanks also poignantly portrays the fear and loneliness of a young boy suddenly thrust into the hostile environment of a trashy hotel (the only place he could afford, with the help of his best friend), where sirens, gunshots, and fights are happening right outside his door. Jared Rushton is perfectly cast as his best friend, and gets a good laugh of his own when he screams his bloody head off when first approached by the adult Josh, thinking he's a pervert bent on doing him harm.Great for anybody who remembers what it's like to be a child in a hurry to get bigger, and even for those who don't.",5,BIG is Tom Hanks at his best,1060992000,"08 16, 2003",2003,1505,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'movie', 'VHS', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'Movies', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Stop', 'Watching', 'list', 'Tom', 'Hanks', '13', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'Josh', 'who', 'up', 'body', '30', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'wishing', 'were', 'bigger', 'not', 'being', 'allowed', 'carnival', 'ride', 'being', 'made', 'fun', 'taller', 'boy', 'theme', 'not', 'unique', 'nobody', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'ever', 'quite', 'right', 'Hanks', 'obviously', 'not', 'forgotten', 'what', 'be', 'adolescent', 'boy', 'results', 'are', 'hilarious', 'reactions', 'adult', 'situations', 'really', 'aweful', 'tux', 'formal', 'party', 'making', 'gagging', 'noises', 'spitting', 'out', 'caviar', 'playing', 'buttons', 'limousine', 'thinking', 'workmate', 'just', 'SLEEP', 'when', 'stay', 'overnight', 'innocently', 'replying', 'Well', 'ok', 'get', 'be', 'top', 'meaning', 'top', 'bunkbed', 'never', 'fail', 'send', 'fits', 'laughter', 'more', 'serious', 'side', 'Hanks', 'also', 'poignantly', 'fear', 'loneliness', 'young', 'boy', 'suddenly', 'thrust', 'hostile', 'environment', 'trashy', 'hotel', 'only', 'place', 'could', 'afford', 'help', 'best', 'friend', 'where', 'sirens', 'gunshots', 'fights', 'are', 'happening', 'right', 'door', 'Jared', 'Rushton', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'best', 'friend', 'good', 'laugh', 'own', 'when', 'screams', 'bloody', 'head', 'when', 'first', 'approached', 'adult', 'Josh', 'thinking', 'pervert', 'bent', 'doing', 'harm.Great', 'anybody', 'who', 'what', 'be', 'child', 'hurry', 'get', 'bigger', 'even', 'who', 'do', ""n't""]",Big VHS

Only one of them really worked and it was with the film Big.  The film is about a kid named Joshua Baskin.  While trying to impress a girl by riding a roller coaster, he is deemed to be too small and is not let onto the ride.  Feeling depressed, he goes to a wishing machine and wishes that he was ""big.""  The next morning, Joshua wakes up to discover that he is big but not in the way he imagined it.  He wakes up in the body of a grown adult and spends the rest of the film trying to become a kid again.  He heads off to New York City with his best friend in the hopes of trying to find the machine and figure out how to explain Joshua's absence from his family.  In the hands of lesser talent, this film would have been a disaster.  Fortunately, the film went on to become one of the highest grossing films of 1988 thanks to terrific direction, a fantastic Oscar-nominated screenplay and the performance of a lifetime given by Tom Hanks.  Hanks went on to win a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.  Personally, I feel as though we would have won if Rain Man had not come out during the same year and Dustin Hoffman giving a truly memorable performance.  Hanks is completely believable as a 13-year-old kid trapped in the body of a 35-year-old.  We truly feel for Joshua as he learns about to complexities of adulthood with the longing for childhood.  The film is full of classic scenes such as Joshua using the large keyboard in the department store, his first time having a female over and especially the ending.  The supporting is cast is also terrific.  I personally felt that Elizabeth Perkins and the boy that played Joshua's friend should have received Oscar-nominations for Best Supporting Actress and Supporting Actors along with the film receiving a best picture nomination.  The screenplay touches on a wide variety of subjects such as valuing your childhood, the difficulty and challenges of growing up and really deciding on what you want.  For the kid in all of us, I would absolutely recommend this film to everyone.  It receives my highest rating of 5 out of 5 stars.",5,Big: A Timeless Classic,1329609600,"02 19, 2012",2012,2290,"['1988', 'were', 'least', 'four', 'films', 'had', 'same', 'idea', 'putting', 'child', 'grown', 'man', 'body', 'Only', 'one', 'really', 'worked', 'was', 'film', 'Big', 'film', 'kid', 'named', 'Joshua', 'Baskin', 'trying', 'impress', 'girl', 'riding', 'roller', 'coaster', 'deemed', 'be', 'too', 'small', 'not', 'let', 'ride', 'Feeling', 'depressed', 'wishing', 'machine', 'wishes', 'was', 'big', 'next', 'morning', 'Joshua', 'up', 'discover', 'big', 'not', 'way', 'imagined', 'up', 'body', 'grown', 'adult', 'rest', 'film', 'trying', 'become', 'kid', 'again', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'best', 'friend', 'hopes', 'trying', 'find', 'machine', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'explain', 'Joshua', 'absence', 'family', 'hands', 'lesser', 'talent', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'disaster', 'Fortunately', 'film', 'went', 'become', 'one', 'highest', 'grossing', 'films', '1988', 'thanks', 'terrific', 'direction', 'fantastic', 'Oscar-nominated', 'screenplay', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'given', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Hanks', 'went', 'win', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Musical', 'Comedy', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Personally', 'feel', 'would', 'have', 'won', 'Rain', 'Man', 'had', 'not', 'come', 'out', 'same', 'year', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'giving', 'truly', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Hanks', 'completely', 'believable', '13-year-old', 'kid', 'trapped', 'body', '35-year-old', 'truly', 'feel', 'Joshua', 'complexities', 'adulthood', 'longing', 'childhood', 'film', 'full', 'classic', 'scenes', 'such', 'Joshua', 'using', 'large', 'keyboard', 'department', 'store', 'first', 'time', 'having', 'female', 'especially', 'ending', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'terrific', 'personally', 'felt', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'boy', 'played', 'Joshua', 'friend', 'should', 'have', 'received', 'Oscar-nominations', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Supporting', 'Actors', 'film', 'receiving', 'best', 'picture', 'nomination', 'screenplay', 'wide', 'variety', 'subjects', 'such', 'valuing', 'childhood', 'difficulty', 'challenges', 'growing', 'up', 'really', 'deciding', 'want', 'kid', 'would', 'absolutely', 'recommend', 'film', 'everyone', 'highest', 'rating', '5', '5', 'stars']",Big VHS

Well, this comical little film shows what would happen if one of those children were to get their wish.For a short synopsis, this film tells the story of a 13-year old boy, Josh, who loses the ""girl of his dreams"" due to his short stature and lack of adult characteristics (such as driving).  So, in a moment of self-pity, Josh makes a wish on a carnival game machine that he wants to be ""big"".  The next morning, Josh wakes up with is 13-year old mind in the body of a 30-year old, and hilarity (and some emotional drama) ensues for the rest of the film.Tom Hanks, one of the few truly great actors of our day, plays the ""old Josh"", and really does carry this film in what turned out to be the start of his brilliant leading-role career.  Hanks absolutely nails the silliness and mannerisms of a young teenager, which makes for some hilarious physical and situational comedy.  Plus, the script is also very conducive to his acting, as the plot feeds into the mentality of a child (I mean, what could have possibly been a better job for the old Josh than Toy Tester?!).  Whether Hanks is failing to convince his mother that, at heart, he is still 13, goofing around with his best buddy, or trying to maintain an adult romantic relationship, Hanks is brilliant in every nuance of the character.A particularly touching scene comes towards the end of the film, when the Old Josh must decide whether he wants to revert back to childhood.  As he walks through his old neighborhood, he observes the simple moments that make childhood great, such as playing in a pile of leaves, a junior-high class picture, or starting a pick-up baseball game.  I'll leave you in suspense as to what Old Josh decides to do, but suffice it to say that the scene will have you wondering whether you would have made the same choice.I don't consider this film to be one of my all-time favorites, thus the 4-star rating instead of five, but it is a very engaging little film that can be enjoyed by pretty much all ages.  Children will love Hanks' crazy antics, while adults will appreciate Hanks' performance and be drawn into the conundrum he ultimately faces.",4,Tom Hanks's Exuberance Makes This Film A Classic,1229558400,"12 18, 2008",2008,2260,"['child', 'ever', 'born', 'earth', 'point', 'his/her', 'life', 'experience', 'life', 'grown-up', 'time', 'Well', 'comical', 'little', 'film', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'one', 'children', 'were', 'get', 'wish.For', 'short', 'synopsis', 'film', 'story', '13-year', 'old', 'boy', 'Josh', 'who', 'girl', 'dreams', 'due', 'short', 'stature', 'lack', 'adult', 'characteristics', 'such', 'driving', 'So', 'moment', 'self-pity', 'Josh', 'wish', 'carnival', 'game', 'machine', 'be', 'big', 'next', 'morning', 'Josh', 'up', '13-year', 'old', 'mind', 'body', '30-year', 'old', 'hilarity', 'emotional', 'drama', 'rest', 'film.Tom', 'Hanks', 'one', 'few', 'truly', 'great', 'actors', 'day', 'old', 'Josh', 'really', 'carry', 'film', 'what', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'start', 'brilliant', 'leading-role', 'career', 'Hanks', 'absolutely', 'silliness', 'mannerisms', 'young', 'teenager', 'hilarious', 'physical', 'situational', 'comedy', 'script', 'also', 'very', 'conducive', 'acting', 'plot', 'mentality', 'child', 'mean', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'possibly', 'been', 'better', 'job', 'old', 'Josh', 'Toy', 'Tester', 'Hanks', 'failing', 'convince', 'mother', 'heart', 'still', '13', 'goofing', 'around', 'best', 'buddy', 'trying', 'maintain', 'adult', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Hanks', 'brilliant', 'nuance', 'character.A', 'particularly', 'touching', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'Old', 'Josh', 'must', 'decide', 'revert', 'back', 'childhood', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'simple', 'moments', 'make', 'childhood', 'great', 'such', 'playing', 'pile', 'leaves', 'junior-high', 'class', 'picture', 'starting', 'pick-up', 'baseball', 'game', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'suspense', 'what', 'Old', 'Josh', 'do', 'say', 'scene', 'will', 'have', 'wondering', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'same', 'choice.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'film', 'be', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'thus', '4-star', 'rating', 'instead', 'five', 'very', 'engaging', 'little', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'pretty', 'much', 'ages', 'Children', 'will', 'love', 'Hanks', 'crazy', 'antics', 'adults', 'will', 'appreciate', 'Hanks', 'performance', 'be', 'drawn', 'conundrum', 'ultimately']",Big VHS
