329399,AWEG4MT8FCU3,6302720370,Ann Bronwen,"[16, 18]","This is the story of an exConfederate officer, (Charlton Heston) who meets and impulsively marries a former dance hall lady, (Anne Baxter).  He knows nothing of her past, but through the schemings of corrupt carpetbaggers who want his ranch, he soon learns all.  He is furious and sends her away.  His humor is not improved when she and his resentful younger brother try to make off with his prize herd of horses.  But all ends well, when love and true character triumph.This is a classic B western, made at the height of the ""adult western"" era.  Ms Baxter's costumes are 50's cocktail dresses with long skirts.  One wonders why this cast of heavy hitters, (Heston, Baxter, Gilbert Roland, Forrest Tucker, Tom Tryon) were featured in such a routine film.  Although everyone does a professional job, the scenes have a stagey quality.  Perhaps as ""A viewer"" suggested, Baxter and Heston were exhausted from their recent efforts in ""The Ten Commandments.""Nonetheless, there are some interesting plot turns and great location photograpy.  It is certainly one of the better movies of this type.

329403,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,6302720370,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","I was very, very pleasantly surprised by this little known but very good western. Below, more of my impressions, with limited SPOILERS.Colt Saunders (Charlton Heston), a rich farmer from Texas who served as captain in Confederate cavalry, managed to survive the War Between States with both his body and honour mostly intact. Demobilized he is heading now to his ranch, known as ""Bar S"", somewhere in the Texan wild hills. But on his way he meets a very beautiful and somehow mysterious woman, Lorna Hunter (Anne Baxter) - and his life will never be the same. That takes care of the first three minutes of the film - and about the rest of the film I will say just that there will be many unexpected twists, genuine drama and some tragedies before the final credits.Released in 1957 it is a rather old film, but it didn't age - at all! The scenario is quite original and it is hard to guess what EXACTLY will happen. Both Heston and Baxter gave everything they could in this film and the result is very visible from the first to the last scene. Their performance was certainly helped by their past experience as just one year before they starred together in ""Ten commandments""...Supporting cast is also very good, with an especially strong performance by Mexico-born Gilbert Roland, one of the few Latinos who made it in Hollywood in those times. Here he plays Innocencio Ortega, the foreman of ""Bar S"", who together with his five sons managed the estate during Colt Saunders absence. Aged 51 when playing in this film he was already a Hollywood veteran, with a great experience (he started to play in the silent movies in the 20s!) as ""Three violent people"" was his 87th film - and it is immediately visible...Tom Tryon (who did also very well in the cult SF film ""I married a monster from outer space"" and in Otto Preminger's war classic ""In harm's way"") gives here also a great performance as Colt Saunders younger brother - a gunfighter who is absolutely deadly, even if he has only his left arm left...Bottom line, this is a very classical and yet very original, intense, well done western. I will absolutely keep this film for another watch.

Do you want to get married?' But Lorna's answer was interrupted by Cault's long kiss...When they arrived to his ranch - already married - Lorna is introduced to Innocencio (Gilbert Roland) his Mexican right arm...When Lorna begins to familiarize with the place, Cault's brother, Cinch (Tom Tryon) appears on the scene, demanding his brother to sell portion of the ranch to any Northerner and to pay him his part in gold...Lorna was curious why Cinch is 'one-armed.' Her husband, impressed, narrated: 'We were just kids when it happened. We were horsing around on the windmill platform on the south ranch. Cinch got his arm caught in the gears of the windmill. I had to amputate his arm.'Soon, leaving the Office of the Deputy Commissioner, a stranger named Massey comes in sight... He identifies Lorna as a former saloon hostess from St. Louis... He tries to address some courteous words to her, but Lorna pretended ignorance...Cable (Forrest Tucker) insisted in pushing Massey to acknowledge Saunders about the past of his wife...Lorna admits her sin to Saunders, who was astonished... 'I'd get down on my knees if I thought it would help,' said Lorna, revealing then that she is going to have his baby...In the meantime, the government soldiers were planning for possession of the ranch, and Cinch invites his brother to a showdown...Heston is convincing as the untouchable in ethics, straight attitude toward upright conduct and honesty...Anne Baxter is excellent in her role as the tarnished woman, offended in her dignity... I remember her when preparing to leave her husband, she warns him with this great truth: 'When you're raising the boy, try to remember something. That people aren't perfect. They make mistakes. And when they do, they suffer, they pay.
