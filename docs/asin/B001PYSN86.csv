Kind of the Thief of Bagdad meets Good Fellas. There's even a rip-off scene of the famous Joe Pesci tirade against Ray Liota, &#34;How am I funny?&#34;If you have nothing better to do, this is not bad. As Bollywood goes, it has very little pizzaz, and need some flash to spice it up, as in the girlfriend could have been a dancer with a heart of gold, and the sister could have been an educated but evil opponent, etc., etc.And the guy steals the tackiest stuff that's supposed to be worth millions...tacky stuff....He could have been a jewel or art thief---but see it!",3,"An okay little film, not much to it, and a cloudy plot-line.",1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,631,"['okay', 'little', 'film', 'not', 'much', 'cloudy', 'plot-line', 'Kind', 'Thief', 'Bagdad', 'meets', 'Good', 'Fellas', 'even', 'rip-off', 'scene', 'famous', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'tirade', 'Ray', 'Liota', '34', 'How', 'am', 'funny', '34', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'not', 'bad', 'Bollywood', 'very', 'little', 'pizzaz', 'need', 'flash', 'spice', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'dancer', 'heart', 'gold', 'sister', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'educated', 'evil', 'opponent', 'etc.', 'etc.And', 'guy', 'tackiest', 'stuff', 'supposed', 'be', 'worth', 'millions', 'tacky', 'stuff', '.He', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'jewel', 'art', 'thief', 'see']",Oye Lucky !

1230144,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B001PYSN86,K. Gordon,"[0, 0]","Charming, well made Indian comedy/drama based on the real life adventuresof a charming, wildly successful thief.This owes more than a little debt to Scorsese, ""Goodfellas"" especially, crossingthe line from homage to rip-off at moments. Meanwhile, it lacks Scorsese's eyefor deeper pain and moral complexities.None-the-less, this is well filmed, well acted, and ultimately kind of moving, whilerevealing something of the Indian middle class to those of us half a world away.But at times the broadness of the comedy just feels like its from a different film,and that takes away from the film's effectiveness.Very catchy score, and the last 5 minutes helps pull it all together and gives thefilm something more.",4,Good Indian comedy/drama,1317168000,"09 28, 2011",2011,708,"['Charming', 'well', 'made', 'Indian', 'comedy/drama', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'charming', 'wildly', 'successful', 'thief.This', 'more', 'little', 'debt', 'Scorsese', 'Goodfellas', 'especially', 'crossingthe', 'line', 'homage', 'rip-off', 'moments', 'Meanwhile', 'Scorsese', 'eyefor', 'deeper', 'pain', 'moral', 'complexities.None-the-less', 'well', 'filmed', 'well', 'acted', 'ultimately', 'kind', 'moving', 'whilerevealing', 'something', 'Indian', 'middle', 'class', 'world', 'away.But', 'times', 'broadness', 'comedy', 'just', 'feels', 'different', 'film', 'away', 'film', 'effectiveness.Very', 'catchy', 'score', 'last', '5', 'minutes', 'pull', 'together', 'thefilm', 'something', 'more']",Oye Lucky !

Never looked like that he was acting in the film . Rest of the Actors were fine too(E) I had lots of expectations with Paresh Rawal as he is senior actor in the industry.
