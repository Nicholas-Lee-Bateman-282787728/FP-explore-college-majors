488874,AFNG8O2DXRCUV,7885142671,Amazon Customer,"[14, 17]","*NOTE: This review is for the ""Shaolin (Collector's Edition) [Blu-Ray]"".  Amazon merged reviews with another edition that is Blu-Ray + DVD combo.This is a beautifully made film with a compelling story and profound meaning. There is everything in this film: realistic kung-fu actions, human greed/power, undeniable love for family, and seeing an absolutely cold-hearted person becoming all heart. Andy Lau was the star so was Jackie Chan (as special guest) and other supporting actors. One can argue this is a drama-first (my believe), and action second.The package comes with a blu-ray and a DVD. blu-ray comes with two Chinese audio tracks (5.1 and stereo), and two English audio tracks (5.1 and stereo).  The main menu says the Chinese is Cantonese dialect, but both tracks are Mandarin. There is subtitle for English and Spanish as well. The English 5.1 seems to have better fidelity and decoding to all 5.1 speakers than the Chinese 5.1 version overall. The English dialog is translated well. The English subtitle is slightly different, but also translated very well. This is pretty rare. Kudos to the translators.The Full HD (1080p) is clean, detailed, sharp but properly softened as needed in the right places.As far as special features on the blu-ray, the deleted scenes are LONG and have pretty interesting ""side stories"". Many are actually quite significant to properly develop characters and bring out the strength of the overall story, but I can understand the movie would've been close to 3 hours long!  There are also two international trailers.The second disc is a DVD, and it contains additional bonus materials.  There are interviews of the cast and director, and behind the scene clips and documentaries. The interviews are in Mandarin and Cantonese dialects (no English).",5,"Beautiful Film, Well Translated, detailed full HD",1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,1789,"['*NOTE', 'review', 'Shaolin', 'Collector', 'Edition', '[', 'Blu-Ray', ']', 'Amazon', 'merged', 'reviews', 'edition', 'Blu-Ray', '+', 'DVD', 'combo.This', 'beautifully', 'made', 'film', 'compelling', 'story', 'profound', 'meaning', 'everything', 'film', 'realistic', 'kung-fu', 'actions', 'human', 'greed/power', 'undeniable', 'love', 'family', 'seeing', 'absolutely', 'cold-hearted', 'person', 'becoming', 'heart', 'Andy', 'Lau', 'was', 'star', 'so', 'was', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'special', 'guest', 'other', 'supporting', 'actors', 'One', 'can', 'argue', 'drama-first', 'believe', 'action', 'second.The', 'package', 'blu-ray', 'DVD', 'blu-ray', 'two', 'Chinese', 'audio', 'tracks', '5.1', 'stereo', 'two', 'English', 'audio', 'tracks', '5.1', 'stereo', 'main', 'menu', 'Chinese', 'Cantonese', 'dialect', 'tracks', 'are', 'Mandarin', 'subtitle', 'English', 'Spanish', 'as', 'well', 'English', '5.1', 'have', 'better', 'fidelity', 'decoding', '5.1', 'speakers', 'Chinese', '5.1', 'version', 'overall', 'English', 'dialog', 'translated', 'well', 'English', 'subtitle', 'slightly', 'different', 'also', 'translated', 'very', 'well', 'pretty', 'rare', 'Kudos', 'translators.The', 'Full', 'HD', '1080p', 'clean', 'detailed', 'sharp', 'properly', 'softened', 'needed', 'right', 'places.As', 'far', 'special', 'features', 'blu-ray', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'LONG', 'have', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'side', 'stories', 'Many', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'significant', 'properly', 'develop', 'characters', 'bring', 'out', 'strength', 'overall', 'story', 'can', 'understand', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'close', '3', 'hours', 'long', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'international', 'trailers.The', 'second', 'disc', 'DVD', 'additional', 'bonus', 'materials', 'are', 'interviews', 'cast', 'director', 'scene', 'clips', 'documentaries', 'interviews', 'are', 'Mandarin', 'Cantonese', 'dialects', 'English']","Shaolin [HK, 2011] Starring Jackie Chan & Andy Lau (Foil Cover)"

488883,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,7885142671,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 3]","SHAOLIN (a/k/a SHAOLIN TEMPLE, 2011, director Benny Chang) is one of the most stunning, perfect films I have ever enjoyed. This is Kurosawa-level good, and let no one tell you any differently. This is a Chinese film that I believe should be shown in schools.Rather than sit here and expound on the storyline, it's better if I explain that the era of this film and some of the major action is based on real life. In the 1920s, there was indeed a warlord in Hunan Province, who destroyed the Shao Lin Monastery after killing nearly everyone there. At that time, in the time of the last abbot until 1984 saw the installation of Abbot Shi Xing Zhen, 90% of the monastery complex was destroyed by fire.SHAOLIN seems at first glance to be some sort of remake of Jet Li's debut film SHAOLIN TEMPLE; it is not. This film tells the story of a Nationalist general who ends up as a Shao Lin disciple after fate has had her way with him. It is the story of true Buddhism, the story of real flesh-and-blood men who became Buddhist priests and fought for their cause: universal peace.As Thomas Jefferson taught us, peace comes at a very dear cost. The cost is home, blood, family, treasure and even history. This film will teach you that, and you will weep several times as I did because it is true, even if the characters are fictitious.This is one of the most exciting films in every way. The details, the acting and the cinematography are really ""to die for"" - forget the reviewers who complain about the fight scenes. I didn't see any wires, and the 'wire-fu' is requisite anyway on this grand a scale. The producers built up a complete Shao Lin Monastery set, and every detail is shown as the important symbolism that it really was. (The crew was denied permission by the present abbot to shoot anything near the real monastery.)The great Jackie Chan has an important cameo here as the temple cook; the immortal Yu Hai (a/k/a Hai Yu, a super favorite of mine who was in the original SHAOLIN TEMPLE and has been in nearly every Tai Chi film) plays the nameless abbot.A stunning and sexy Andy Lau (WHAT WOMEN WANT, HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS) plays the converted General Hou Jie; the wonderful, charismatic Jacky Wu plays the senior monk Shi Ching Neng. The crazed General Tsao Man is played by the very brilliant Nicholas Tse (THE MEDALLION, NEW POLICE STORY), who is one of the most beautiful men I've ever seen.Now for just a few further details brought to you by your favorite know-it-all reviewer. First there is the Buddhist blessing, O Mi To Fu. This does NOT mean ""Buddha Bless You"". It is a benediction but it means ""Rest in the Palm of Buddha."" You will see with your own eyes what this really means in this film.The famous exchange between the abbot and the cook actually goes like this:Abbot: What matters more, a pile of gold or a pile of mud?Cook: The gold of course.Abbot: What if you were a seed? Don't cheat yourself.As for the priests' robes: I can't believe they got away with this, but those are not typical Shao Lin robes by any means. They are the exact robes worn by the Dabei Temple monks - who are a bit in competition with Shao Lin today - and I can only guess it was a homage to the Dabei priests. Shao Lin routinely wore fine robes of grey, ceremonial robes of yellow. The abbot's shoulder-robe was always red. Here, Yu Hai's great abbot wears a black hemp robe and a dark brown shoulder robe.DO NOT SKIP THIS FILM. Though this DVD is all-region, and sounds like a vacuum cleaner is in your player at first, do not fear. It is a beautiful transfer, and you have your choice between English, Mandarin or Cantonese and the subtitles are adequate. I do not know what kept this film under wraps, but you'd be a fool not to buy it.One other thing I learned here: this was filmed in Mandarin and all the actors did their own voice-over work. They recorded it in Cantonese - no English dubbing! Then I realized, we never really know what our favorite Chinese actors sound like. Their voices are dubbed one way or the other, the sillier, the better - I have always hated that. This film paid so much detail to the voice-over work and the acting really comes through. Jackie Chan is especially funny speaking Mandarin!I have a feeling this will surpass any film you've ever enjoyed - and it will leave a legacy, because it deals with real events that are mostly forgotten.""Shao Lin will never die, it cannot be destroyed, because it is in our hearts. We take it with us."" - the cook",5,"THE BIGGEST, GREATEST SHAO LIN FILM IN HISTORY AND NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT IT.",1310774400,"07 16, 2011",2011,4487,"['SHAOLIN', 'a/k/a', 'SHAOLIN', 'TEMPLE', '2011', 'director', 'Benny', 'Chang', 'one', 'most', 'stunning', 'perfect', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'enjoyed', 'Kurosawa-level', 'good', 'let', 'one', 'tell', 'differently', 'Chinese', 'film', 'believe', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'schools.Rather', 'sit', 'here', 'expound', 'storyline', 'better', 'explain', 'era', 'film', 'major', 'action', 'based', 'real', 'life', '1920s', 'was', 'indeed', 'warlord', 'Hunan', 'Province', 'who', 'destroyed', 'Shao', 'Lin', 'Monastery', 'killing', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'there', 'time', 'time', 'last', 'abbot', '1984', 'saw', 'installation', 'Abbot', 'Shi', 'Xing', 'Zhen', '90', '%', 'monastery', 'complex', 'was', 'destroyed', 'fire.SHAOLIN', 'first', 'glance', 'be', 'sort', 'remake', 'Jet', 'Li', 'debut', 'film', 'SHAOLIN', 'TEMPLE', 'not', 'film', 'story', 'Nationalist', 'general', 'who', 'up', 'Shao', 'Lin', 'disciple', 'fate', 'had', 'way', 'story', 'true', 'Buddhism', 'story', 'real', 'flesh-and-blood', 'men', 'who', 'became', 'Buddhist', 'priests', 'fought', 'cause', 'universal', 'peace.As', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'taught', 'peace', 'very', 'dear', 'cost', 'cost', 'home', 'blood', 'family', 'treasure', 'even', 'history', 'film', 'will', 'teach', 'will', 'weep', 'several', 'times', 'did', 'true', 'even', 'characters', 'are', 'fictitious.This', 'one', 'most', 'exciting', 'films', 'way', 'details', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'are', 'really', 'die', 'forget', 'reviewers', 'who', 'complain', 'fight', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'wires', ""'wire-fu"", 'requisite', 'anyway', 'grand', 'scale', 'producers', 'built', 'up', 'complete', 'Shao', 'Lin', 'Monastery', 'set', 'detail', 'shown', 'important', 'symbolism', 'really', 'was', 'crew', 'was', 'denied', 'permission', 'present', 'abbot', 'shoot', 'anything', 'real', 'monastery', 'great', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'important', 'cameo', 'here', 'temple', 'cook', 'immortal', 'Yu', 'Hai', 'a/k/a', 'Hai', 'Yu', 'super', 'favorite', 'mine', 'who', 'was', 'original', 'SHAOLIN', 'TEMPLE', 'been', 'nearly', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'film', 'nameless', 'abbot.A', 'stunning', 'sexy', 'Andy', 'Lau', 'WHAT', 'WOMEN', 'WANT', 'HOUSE', 'FLYING', 'DAGGERS', 'converted', 'General', 'Hou', 'Jie', 'wonderful', 'charismatic', 'Jacky', 'Wu', 'senior', 'monk', 'Shi', 'Ching', 'Neng', 'crazed', 'General', 'Tsao', 'Man', 'played', 'very', 'brilliant', 'Nicholas', 'Tse', 'THE', 'MEDALLION', 'NEW', 'POLICE', 'STORY', 'who', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'men', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Now', 'just', 'few', 'further', 'details', 'brought', 'favorite', 'know-it-all', 'reviewer', 'First', 'Buddhist', 'blessing', 'O', 'Mi', 'Fu', 'NOT', 'mean', 'Buddha', 'Bless', 'benediction', 'Rest', 'Palm', 'Buddha', 'will', 'see', 'own', 'eyes', 'what', 'really', 'film.The', 'famous', 'exchange', 'abbot', 'cook', 'actually', 'Abbot', 'What', 'more', 'pile', 'gold', 'pile', 'mud', 'Cook', 'gold', 'course.Abbot', 'What', 'were', 'seed', 'Do', ""n't"", 'cheat', 'yourself.As', 'priests', 'robes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'got', 'away', 'are', 'not', 'typical', 'Shao', 'Lin', 'robes', 'means', 'are', 'exact', 'robes', 'worn', 'Dabei', 'Temple', 'monks', 'who', 'are', 'bit', 'competition', 'Shao', 'Lin', 'today', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'was', 'homage', 'Dabei', 'priests', 'Shao', 'Lin', 'routinely', 'wore', 'fine', 'robes', 'grey', 'ceremonial', 'robes', 'yellow', 'abbot', 'shoulder-robe', 'was', 'always', 'red', 'Here', 'Yu', 'Hai', 'great', 'abbot', 'black', 'hemp', 'robe', 'dark', 'brown', 'shoulder', 'robe.DO', 'NOT', 'SKIP', 'THIS', 'FILM', 'DVD', 'all-region', 'vacuum', 'cleaner', 'player', 'first', 'do', 'not', 'fear', 'beautiful', 'transfer', 'have', 'choice', 'English', 'Mandarin', 'Cantonese', 'subtitles', 'are', 'adequate', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'kept', 'film', 'wraps', ""'d"", 'be', 'fool', 'not', 'buy', 'it.One', 'other', 'thing', 'learned', 'here', 'was', 'filmed', 'Mandarin', 'actors', 'did', 'own', 'voice-over', 'work', 'recorded', 'Cantonese', 'English', 'dubbing', 'Then', 'realized', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'favorite', 'Chinese', 'actors', 'sound', 'voices', 'are', 'dubbed', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'sillier', 'better', 'have', 'always', 'hated', 'film', 'paid', 'so', 'much', 'detail', 'voice-over', 'work', 'acting', 'really', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'especially', 'funny', 'speaking', 'Mandarin', 'have', 'feeling', 'will', 'surpass', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'enjoyed', 'will', 'leave', 'legacy', 'real', 'events', 'are', 'mostly', 'forgotten', 'Shao', 'Lin', 'will', 'never', 'die', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'destroyed', 'hearts', 'take', 'cook']","Shaolin [HK, 2011] Starring Jackie Chan & Andy Lau (Foil Cover)"

Now any martial arts fan out there knows of Shaolin I am sure, from the actual history to the films in which this place and its people are portrayed. This is another in a list of films dedicated to the destruction of one of the temples. There have been many before this and I am sure there are more to come. Most people know of the old school ones back in the day and even one that came a little later that gave us a young Jet Li. The Li film is what this one is loosely based on from what I can tell. Also it should be noted that the actual Shaolin Monastery supported this film.Set during the Warlord Era of China in the 1900's the film tells the story of General Hou [Andy Lau] a warlord who wants more [don't they all]. We start with Hou entering the Shaolin Temple chasing down a rival warlord and despite the Monks pleas to leave the man be and show mercy he murders the man inside the Temple walls. In an effort to seize control of more power an assassination attempt on a warlord named Song Hu goes wrong when Hou's second in command Cao Man [Nicholas Tse] betrays him. While trying to escape Hou's daughter becomes fatally injured. In a desperate attempt to save her he takes her to the very Monks he disrespected at the Shaolin Monastery. While they do try to save her it is for nothing as she is too far gone his wife blames him for this and leaves him, he has lost everything. While he is full of anger and has lead a life contradictory to that of the Monks he is given sanctuary there. But his past may still catch up with him as Cao Man will not rest until he is dead.For those who don't know this film was directed by Benny Chan and I have to say that this may very well be his best film. Chan has been know as more of a style or action driven type director, but here he really comes through with the dramatic elements as well. But much like Woopak said it helps when you have actors who can help carry the film. Andy Lau is our lead and he does an excellent job here. He is believable as the power hungry warlord and as the changing man looking for peace after losing everything.Fan Bingbing is great as well as Hou's wife and it shows especially in scenes in which she blames her husband for their daughter's death. I really enjoyed Nicholas Tse here though as the lead villain after turning on Hou. He plays a very ruthless character that goes for what he wants at all costs. Then of course there is Jackie Chan who I am sure a lot of people will see this for him. Chan is great here as well in a supporting role playing a cook at the temple. His character has a lot to do with Hou coming to terms with what has happened, a good light dramatic role for Chan.Then of course there are the action and fight scenes here and I have to say that the film excels in that department. When the action hits in this film it really hits and is very exciting, from straight action as in things going boom and guns being discharged all the way to the fights. Any martial arts fan will enjoy the fight scenes in this flick although sometimes the wire work is a little too obvious. Still there is nothing like good martial arts being displayed and it is here. The last part of the film in particular will please any action fan in my opinion.Now not everything is great here but even the things I am about to mention don't take too much away from the film. Chan is really proving himself with this film but sometimes the direction seems a bit off. Some things are not fully explored to the fullest [I do understand this though since the film is already 2 + hours] like the Monks who pull ""Iron Monkey"" duties in stealing rice and such and giving them out to the poor town's people. It shows why they do it and why they stop since they are punished for stealing since it goes against their ways. But I felt like a little more from them would have been fun. Also the wire work is always fun and great to look at but in a film that is mostly based in reality sometimes the wire work seems out of place.In the end I would say that this film is an epic but falls just a little short of classic status in my opinion.

488888,A2HVL790PBWYTU,7885142671,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[32, 40]","SHAOLIN proves once again that the path to enlightenment is strewn with Kiiii-yaaaaahhhh!!! It also demonstrates that karma is a mother, ain't that so, General Hou Jie? SHAOLIN, the latest in a long line of period martial arts films, probably won't be quite the critic's darling that CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON was, but it should turn plenty of heads. It's epic enough. And aren't you yet convinced that Andy Lau is a hell of a charismatic actor? His character arc makes for a pretty compelling watch.Set in the early 20th century, shortly after the collapse of imperial reign, China's young republic is threatened by warring warlords eager to carve out their own territories. One such is the prideful, ruthless General Hou Jie (Andy Lau) who had just conquered the town of Dengfeng, in Henan. But uneasy drapes the mantle of power, and when one plays the game of thrones, expect the unexpected. Hou Jie, concerned with an ally's true intentions, plots to destroy him, except that he himself is double-crossed. Barely escaping with his life, Hou Jie seeks the sanctuary of the Shaolin temple, which is sort of cheeky, since this is the very same temple he had ridiculed days before. But when one plummets from such lofty heights, one must simply lump it. Hou Jie reflects on the evil he has committed and vows to attain a monk's serenity, never mind that, days before, he had picked up the temple's sign and sneeringly scrawled ""is no big deal"" after its declaration: ""The Birthplace of Martial Arts.""This isn't a Jackie Chan vehicle. Jackie does have a part, except that, now in his mid-fifties, it may be that his action lead days are on the wane. SHAOLIN is a serious drama more so than it is an action film, and Jackie provides the much-needed levity. To quote the seldomly quotable Steven Seagal, Jackie in this film is ""just a cook."" But his Shaolin temple cook plays a pivotal role in Hou Jie's transition from cruel warlord to tranquil monk.SHAOLIN is loosely based on 1982's THE SHAOLIN TEMPLE, the classic what debuted some teenager named Jet Li. Except that Andy Lau isn't an accomplished wushu master like Jet Li. But he IS an accomplished actor, and director Benny Chan plays to his strengths. SHAOLIN is character- and story-driven and the fighty fights that crop up spool naturally off story development. That's not to say that the action sequences aren't spectacular, because they very much are jaw-dropping stuff, gravity-defying stuff. Two highlights are the Shaolin children springing into action and Jackie Chan's one fighting showcase which makes inventive use of cooking utensils. There is also a harrowing nighttime carriage chase by the cliffside that is brilliantly executed and damn intense.Awesomely, the real-life, more than 1500 years old Shaolin Temple gave this film its blessing. And with the film crew having erected a full-sized temple replica, the weight of revered history is palpable. The story lends gravity and sense of place, and you believe these monks on camera, and their belief in their principles and their righteousness. Even though SHAOLIN focuses predominantly on the deposed General, it blocks out screen time for the supporting actors. I really liked the two headstrong young monks who agonize over the monastery's dwindling supplies - because Shaolin had been taking in starving refugees - and they resort to covert Robin Hood tactics. I wish that this sub-plot had gone on longer. But these benevolent outlaws don't escape the observant eye of the Senior Brother, another character I enjoyed. I will say that the gorgeous Fan Bingbing, who plays Hou Jie's wife, is criminally underused.Meditations on Shaolin philosophies such as turning the other cheek and the futility of violence - and the selfless grace to help a fellow man for no reason other than to help him - color the narrative, and even when the film's second half dissolves into a series of brutal action set pieces, the theme of redemption courses thru to the end. Buddha gets praised a lot, which is fine.The nits are ripe, just right for picking: There's a nationalistic streak. Maybe someday, China will make a martial arts film without portraying foreign white devils as utter tools. But that's not today, and not in this movie. And listening to these treasure-hunting Brits spout off the same old tired dialogue may draw snickers. One of the harder selling points is the film's contention that Hou Jei, in such a brief span of time, could rise to a prominent leadership role within the temple hierachy. Of course, I'm assuming that not much time had elapsed. The film doesn't really make this clear. Still, you cannot fault Andy Lau's skillful performance. He's so convincing as the cruel General that at some point I expected him to sacrifice his own family on the altar of self-interest, and yet he's equally credible when he converts to Shaolin and sheds his old self. His young daughter goes a long ways in humanizing him with one simple laughing scribble: ""Daddy likes to fight."" It takes Hou Jie one step closer to attaining Zen. But it's a bloody, roundabout way.",5,"""They greet you with Shaolin martial arts.

488893,A2O7P0578BBFBB,7885142671,K. Doyle,"[0, 2]","Better-than-average action film with the usual choreographed martial arts battles.  But I was hoping for more, thinking that the Shaolin angle would have provided a little more sophistication of the story than it did.  In fact, the monks were used for comic relief as much as anything else, which was a little disappointing.  Not that I didn't chuckle a bit, but the Shaolin angle seemed it should have been better utilized.  While there was a little ""insight into human nature"" that I was hoping for in the final resolution, I had hoped for more, or something a little more profound.  It was all pretty formulaic, really.  You could do worse, but they could do better.  The story was the weak point I would say, including the overdependence on the standard choreographed and unrealistic action.  Good guys and bad guys.  Otherwise the effects and camerawork were quite good.Such action movies appear to be the equivalent of the Westerns of the '40s and '50s with modern production values.  Eventually,  westerns started to expand outside the box, push the boundaries, and discard the old standard formulas.  Films like the the original 3:10 to Yuma, the Hired Hand, the spaghetti westerns and others of that opened up the field and didn't need to rely on unrealistic stereotypical gunfights to keep them interesting.  Who was a good guy and who was a bad guy was blurred, struggles with moral ambiguities, etc., more like real life.  Though there are some transitions in Shaolin, it's still pretty black and white when the all bad guy suddenly turns all good guy.  Hopefully better plots are on their way and we'll see some of that sophistication happen with the martial arts movies (or happen again, as I figure many of the classic samurai films qualify).

He is captivating and fills the screen with heart and soul in every scene he is in. I can't do justice to what he has done here. Early on, he is power hungry and fearful of loss. He clearly loves his family, but resorts to treachery to ""protect"" his world and them. Everything quickly unravels, at the hands of his younger brother who has learned from him... all too well.The cinematography is gorgeous, the supporting cast are all at the top of their game- and what a cast it is. The kung fu is great, but the action sequences are always in support of the story, which is unusual for big budget films, whether Chinese or American.

There is breathtaking action, heart-wrenching drama, thoughtful spirituality, and gorgeous cinematography of China. The movie is not a pure action romp nor is it a period-piece costume drama. It brings the best elements of both however, as well as elements that made some of the great crossover hits like Hero, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and House of Flying Daggers so great. There are perfectly placed laughs, tender moments of love and loss, and brutal scenes of cruelty. Being that it is a story of Shaolin monks battling external forces, there are also many philosophical nuggets to be mined, and I found these welcome and moving treasures.Andy Lau does a great job portraying the general whose life is transformed and I've not seen Jackie Chan used so perfectly in a long while, if ever. Moreover, the characters are given depth and unexpected trajectories that were a refreshing break from the predictable.The movie clocks in at slightly over two hours and paces itself well.

488911,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,7885142671,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[0, 0]","The Shaolin temple has long been a place of refuge and respite and the famed monks the people's protectors and servants.  This movie finds the monks attempting to be pacifists in the face of a ruthless warlord moving through town and making pacts with western governments that will increase both their and his power within China's verdant valleys.  The warlord is wounded, though, and where once he laid siege to the Shaolin monastery he now finds himself the beneficiary of the monk's care.  As time is taken for his body and spirit to heal the devious plots of the other power brokers play out until duplicity strips many of their lives and the monks are decimated in a bloodbath that they are forced to fight in in order to protect the people.You would think that this type of movie would employ more west versus east fighting with the warlords relying more heavily than they do on western weaponry rather than their hand-to-hand prowess but you'd be wrong.  There certainly is the explicit evil of the advanced western machinery of destruction, but the soldiers are no slouches to employing their fists and feet in the service of subjugation.  Thus we get an ample amount of fighting, some of it rueful and bitterly violent, and some of it delightful and laughable (as when the monastery boys fight in a child's inimitably small style and Jackie Chan, here portrayed as a kindhearted but mentally limited strongman, uses his wok to rock heads).  This is a decent Hong Kong actioner and worth the time for those who eat this stuff up.  But as has been said before, fans of Chan (who is featured prominently on the cover) need to look elsewhere to watch him in a starring role as this movie has him in but a small supporting role.Ultimately the bad guys are generally unsympathetic and rueful characters except for warlord Hou Jie (played by veteran Andy Lau) who goes through a painful redemption.  The Shaolin monks are a bit more nuanced as they show more emotional hostility and distrust and less intuitiveness than normal.  For those looking only for slam bang kung fu action they will get some but may overall be disappointed by more story than they're expecting.",4,More east on east violence.,1402444800,"06 11, 2014",2014,2171,"['Shaolin', 'temple', 'long', 'been', 'place', 'refuge', 'respite', 'famed', 'people', 'protectors', 'servants', 'movie', 'monks', 'attempting', 'be', 'pacifists', 'face', 'ruthless', 'warlord', 'moving', 'town', 'making', 'pacts', 'western', 'governments', 'will', 'increase', 'power', 'China', 'verdant', 'valleys', 'warlord', 'wounded', 'where', 'once', 'laid', 'siege', 'Shaolin', 'monastery', 'now', 'beneficiary', 'monk', 'care', 'time', 'taken', 'body', 'spirit', 'heal', 'devious', 'plots', 'other', 'power', 'brokers', 'play', 'out', 'duplicity', 'strips', 'many', 'lives', 'monks', 'are', 'decimated', 'bloodbath', 'are', 'forced', 'fight', 'order', 'protect', 'people.You', 'would', 'think', 'type', 'movie', 'would', 'employ', 'more', 'west', 'versus', 'east', 'fighting', 'warlords', 'relying', 'more', 'heavily', 'do', 'western', 'weaponry', 'rather', 'hand-to-hand', 'prowess', ""'d"", 'be', 'wrong', 'certainly', 'explicit', 'evil', 'advanced', 'western', 'machinery', 'destruction', 'soldiers', 'are', 'slouches', 'employing', 'fists', 'feet', 'service', 'subjugation', 'Thus', 'get', 'ample', 'amount', 'fighting', 'rueful', 'bitterly', 'violent', 'delightful', 'laughable', 'when', 'monastery', 'fight', 'child', 'inimitably', 'small', 'style', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'here', 'portrayed', 'kindhearted', 'mentally', 'limited', 'strongman', 'wok', 'rock', 'heads', 'decent', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'actioner', 'time', 'who', 'eat', 'stuff', 'up', 'been', 'said', 'fans', 'Chan', 'who', 'featured', 'prominently', 'cover', 'need', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'watch', 'starring', 'role', 'movie', 'small', 'supporting', 'role.Ultimately', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'generally', 'unsympathetic', 'rueful', 'characters', 'warlord', 'Hou', 'Jie', 'played', 'veteran', 'Andy', 'Lau', 'who', 'painful', 'redemption', 'Shaolin', 'monks', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'nuanced', 'show', 'more', 'emotional', 'hostility', 'distrust', 'less', 'intuitiveness', 'normal', 'looking', 'only', 'slam', 'bang', 'kung', 'fu', 'action', 'will', 'get', 'may', 'overall', 'be', 'disappointed', 'more', 'story', ""'re"", 'expecting']","Shaolin [HK, 2011] Starring Jackie Chan & Andy Lau (Foil Cover)"

488913,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,7885142671,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 6]","For most action film fans, the name of Shaolin is almost synonymous with Chinese martial arts action movies, especially the 1982 film starring Jet Li (then known as Li Lianjie). Despite its title, the new 2011 film ""Shaolin"" is neither a remake nor a sequel to the groundbreaking film made about 30 years ago. Though the action-packed new version (with the gorgeous set of the Shaolin temple) is entertaining, those who are looking for originality in action may be disappointed.Set in 1912, immediately after the Xinhai Revolution, the story of ""Shaolin"" centers around a proud and ruthless warlord Hou Jie (Andy Lau) attempting to get rid of his sworn brother General Song Hu (Shi Xiaohong), whom he no longer trusts. But his plans go terribly awry when Hou Jie's trusted second-in-command Cao Man (Nicholas Tse) has come up with another plan unknown to him.Directed by Benny Chan (""Who Am I?"" ""New Police Story""), ""Shaolin"" provides lots of action stunts including one rousing chase scene. They are expertly choreographed, but each sequence (in the second half of the film in particular) tends to be shorter than it should be, and sometimes dependent on big and loud explosions, which I think is antithesis to martial arts action.Andy Lau is a gifted actor, and so is Nicholas Tse. I know they are not required to show Jet Li's physical prowess, but the name of Shaolin is something special for martial arts film fans. For them the filmmakers wisely hired Wu Jing and Yu Xing (both former martial arts practitioners) as Shaolin monks, and a veteran actor/choreographer Xin Xin Xiong as a deadly assassin. Even Yu Hai (seen in Jet Li's ""The Shaolin Temple"") has come back from retirement as the Shaolin abbot. All of them are given a chance to show what they can do, but perhaps Benny Chan could have given them more screen time.Fan Bingbing as Hou Jie's wife is not required to do much except look sad and cry. Jackie Chan fares slightly better as a cook living in the Shaolin monastery, but his action sequence is not a big one.Overlong and a bit too bloody at times, ""Shaolin"" is a pretty good action film, if not very original.",4,(3.5 STARS) Entertaining Chinese Martial Arts Film (Not Much Originality Though),1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,2132,"['most', 'action', 'film', 'fans', 'name', 'Shaolin', 'almost', 'synonymous', 'Chinese', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'movies', 'especially', '1982', 'film', 'starring', 'Jet', 'Li', 'then', 'known', 'Li', 'Lianjie', 'title', 'new', '2011', 'film', 'Shaolin', 'remake', 'sequel', 'groundbreaking', 'film', 'made', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'action-packed', 'new', 'version', 'gorgeous', 'set', 'Shaolin', 'temple', 'entertaining', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'originality', 'action', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed.Set', '1912', 'immediately', 'Xinhai', 'Revolution', 'story', 'Shaolin', 'centers', 'proud', 'ruthless', 'warlord', 'Hou', 'Jie', 'Andy', 'Lau', 'attempting', 'get', 'rid', 'sworn', 'brother', 'General', 'Song', 'Hu', 'Shi', 'Xiaohong', 'whom', 'no', 'longer', 'trusts', 'plans', 'go', 'terribly', 'awry', 'when', 'Hou', 'Jie', 'trusted', 'second-in-command', 'Cao', 'Man', 'Nicholas', 'Tse', 'come', 'up', 'plan', 'unknown', 'him.Directed', 'Benny', 'Chan', 'Who', 'Am', 'New', 'Police', 'Story', 'Shaolin', 'lots', 'action', 'stunts', 'including', 'one', 'rousing', 'chase', 'scene', 'are', 'expertly', 'choreographed', 'sequence', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'particular', 'be', 'shorter', 'should', 'be', 'sometimes', 'dependent', 'big', 'loud', 'explosions', 'think', 'antithesis', 'martial', 'arts', 'action.Andy', 'Lau', 'gifted', 'actor', 'so', 'Nicholas', 'Tse', 'know', 'are', 'not', 'required', 'show', 'Jet', 'Li', 'physical', 'prowess', 'name', 'Shaolin', 'something', 'special', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'fans', 'filmmakers', 'wisely', 'hired', 'Wu', 'Jing', 'Yu', 'Xing', 'former', 'martial', 'arts', 'practitioners', 'Shaolin', 'monks', 'veteran', 'actor/choreographer', 'Xin', 'Xin', 'Xiong', 'deadly', 'assassin', 'Even', 'Yu', 'Hai', 'seen', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Shaolin', 'Temple', 'come', 'back', 'retirement', 'Shaolin', 'abbot', 'are', 'given', 'chance', 'show', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'perhaps', 'Benny', 'Chan', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'screen', 'time.Fan', 'Bingbing', 'Hou', 'Jie', 'wife', 'not', 'required', 'do', 'much', 'look', 'sad', 'cry', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'slightly', 'better', 'cook', 'living', 'Shaolin', 'monastery', 'action', 'sequence', 'not', 'big', 'one.Overlong', 'bit', 'too', 'bloody', 'times', 'Shaolin', 'pretty', 'good', 'action', 'film', 'not', 'very', 'original']","Shaolin [HK, 2011] Starring Jackie Chan & Andy Lau (Foil Cover)"
