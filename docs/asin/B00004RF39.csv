The book, however, portrayed Emma as more accessible and less implacable. Emma seemed brittle and inclement in this film. If you liked the Woman of Substance film,read Hold the Dream instead of watching this adaptation. While the book and film showed Emma was very much intent on continuing to build her empire, the movie failed to encapsulate Emma's vunerability, but rather she came off shrewish and implacable.  In my opinion, she was like an automaton as she didn't seem empathetic to anyone.She didn't really bond with her children as they were growing up and this movie made the children seem as props to be taken out when necessary, and then put away once she no longer needed them.  She seemed to grow more inflexible as time marched on.  This isn't a bad film, but Emma was not a sympathetic character.If, in the movie, she would have stepped down from her high horse occasionally, I might have been able to identify 'with her.  As it stands, in this film, Emma is no longer a woman of substance.",3,A Woman of Substance No More,1365379200,"04 8, 2013",2013,1240,"['Somewhere', 'two', 'productions', 'Woman', 'Substance', 'Emma', 'became', '34', 'woman', 'unsubstance.', '34', 'read', 'trilogy', 'years', 'years', 'ago', 'adaptation', 'Hold', 'Dream', 'was', 'mostly', 'faithful', 'book', 'book', 'however', 'portrayed', 'Emma', 'more', 'accessible', 'less', 'implacable', 'Emma', 'seemed', 'brittle', 'inclement', 'film', 'liked', 'Woman', 'Substance', 'film', 'read', 'Hold', 'Dream', 'instead', 'watching', 'adaptation', 'book', 'film', 'showed', 'Emma', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'intent', 'continuing', 'build', 'empire', 'movie', 'failed', 'encapsulate', 'Emma', 'vunerability', 'rather', 'came', 'off', 'shrewish', 'implacable', 'opinion', 'was', 'automaton', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'empathetic', 'anyone.She', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'bond', 'children', 'were', 'growing', 'up', 'movie', 'made', 'children', 'seem', 'props', 'be', 'taken', 'out', 'when', 'necessary', 'then', 'put', 'away', 'longer', 'needed', 'seemed', 'grow', 'more', 'inflexible', 'time', 'marched', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'Emma', 'was', 'not', 'sympathetic', 'character.If', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'stepped', 'down', 'high', 'horse', 'occasionally', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'identify', ""'with"", 'film', 'Emma', 'no', 'longer', 'woman', 'substance']",Hold the Dream VHS

I started to say it's like a soap opera because of the suspense and backstabbing going on, but it's better than a soap because there is some conclusion. I would suggest buying A Woman Of Substance, too and looking at it first. It's set in the early 1900's and gives a background on Emma Harte. You'll understand Hold The Dream better. I love these movies. They are not boring, but are filled with excitement, intrigue and all the good and bad that make up this family. They don't make mini-series like this anymore.
