1519461,AO5DDG05DHVIC,B006TBYC76,,"[0, 0]","As the Night Gallery went on it diminished in quality.  The 3rd and final season, which took a near eternity for Universal to release, was cancelled so there isn't even a full season to watch and the show was reduced from an hour to 1/2 hour format.  The stories varry widely in quality.  The transfer quality is ok, the color appears a little faded which could have been improved.  There are some extras, but not many to speak of.  The first season wasn't a full season either, although the 2nd did have the usual number of episodes for a season done at that time.  Universal probably would have done better to have released the entire series in two boxed sets with some more extras--given the odd number of episodes.  The best shows of the series were early on when Serling had more creative control of the content.  I do have to give them credit though, for being able to restore the shows to the way they were originally broadcast, for the most part, instead of the bastardized chop job they did for putting the show in syndicatioin.If you are a fan of horror anhtology series The Night Gallery is still worth watching--but only if you're a fan.  The feel of the Night Gallery is much more dated and different than the Twilight Zone (which has a timeless quality)--here we enter the realm of supernatural horror rather than the sci-fi/fantasy world of the Zone.  Frankly Ghost Story/Circle of Fear was a better horror series on a whole, but the anthology TV genre was on its way out by the time these rolled around and the decline in production values and writing is a good indication of that.",3,Worth Watching for Serling Fans,1405382400,"07 15, 2014",2014,1597,"['Night', 'Gallery', 'went', 'diminished', 'quality', '3rd', 'final', 'season', 'took', 'near', 'eternity', 'Universal', 'release', 'was', 'cancelled', 'so', ""n't"", 'even', 'full', 'season', 'watch', 'show', 'was', 'reduced', 'hour', '1/2', 'hour', 'format', 'stories', 'varry', 'widely', 'quality', 'transfer', 'quality', 'ok', 'color', 'little', 'faded', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'are', 'extras', 'not', 'many', 'speak', 'first', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'full', 'season', 'either', '2nd', 'did', 'have', 'usual', 'number', 'episodes', 'season', 'done', 'time', 'Universal', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'have', 'released', 'entire', 'series', 'two', 'boxed', 'sets', 'more', 'extras', 'given', 'odd', 'number', 'episodes', 'best', 'shows', 'series', 'were', 'early', 'when', 'Serling', 'had', 'more', 'creative', 'control', 'content', 'do', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'being', 'able', 'restore', 'shows', 'way', 'were', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'most', 'part', 'instead', 'bastardized', 'chop', 'job', 'did', 'putting', 'show', 'syndicatioin.If', 'are', 'fan', 'horror', 'anhtology', 'series', 'Night', 'Gallery', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'only', ""'re"", 'fan', 'feel', 'Night', 'Gallery', 'much', 'more', 'dated', 'different', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'timeless', 'quality', 'here', 'enter', 'realm', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'rather', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'world', 'Zone', 'Frankly', 'Ghost', 'Story/Circle', 'Fear', 'was', 'better', 'horror', 'series', 'whole', 'anthology', 'TV', 'genre', 'was', 'way', 'time', 'rolled', 'around', 'decline', 'production', 'values', 'writing', 'good', 'indication']",Night Gallery: Season Three

No longer an hour program, it was shortened to 25 minutes long.The theme music and intro changes again. Music by Eddie Sauther. Rod Serling did not have much control over the Night Gallery program and so the quality of the stories began to fail.You might recognize these guest stars:Bill Bixby, Vincent price, James Farentino, Joanna Pettet, John Astin, Kip Niven, Mickey Rooney, Victor Sen Yung, Raymond Massey, Sandra Dee, Christopher Connelly, Morris the Cat, Dane Clark, Ozzie Nelson, Harriet Nelson, Michael Lerner, Roger Davis, Cesare Donova, Lindsay Wagner, Ross Martin, Burl Ives, Barbara Anderson, Stuart Whitman, Ellen Corby, Alan Napier, Cameron Mitchell, Burgess Meredith, Barry Sullivan, Roger E.

They were in the Star Trek episode, ""The Empath"" in 1968.Leonard Nimoy directed ""Death on a Barge"".Did you hear Rod Serling actually say the word ""disco-tec"" in 1972?Disc One contains an audio commentary for ""Return of the Sorcerer"" with Night Gallery historians Scott Skelton & Jim Benson which can be turned on in ""Bonus Features"".Disc Two contains ""Lost Tapes"" in Bonus Features.""Die Now, Pay Later"" with Slim Pickens and Will Geer.""Room For One Less"" with James Metropole and Lee J.

For syndication in television, it was re-ran with the Night Gallery, however the one-hour episodes of ""The Sixth Sense"" was heavily-edited down into the 30-minute format of Night Gallery. Rod Serling added his own introduction to condense and explain the beginning of the story.""The Sixth Sense"" tv series is not available on DVD. It would be nice to see the entire one-hour episodes which have not been broadcast in whole in over 40 years. They only made 25 episodes.Rod Serling passed away June 28, 1975 having had several attacks including one on the operating table. He was 50.

1519487,A366S12KCZ280V,B006TBYC76,"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover""","[10, 12]","For those of us who are fans of the Serling's series ""Night Gallery"" we could not be more thrilled at the news that the third, and final, season is finally being released. We waited forever for the first season to ever be released. That occurred in 2004. Then we waited it seemed a life time for the second season to be released in 2008. It then seemed like an eternity before the word came out in 2012 the third season was coming out. The final season of ""Night Gallery"" is not the best, especially compaired to the second season but there are still some excellant episodes with a few big named actors appearing in what was probably the last of the great anthology series that use to be found on television. The sadness to all this was that NBC decided to cut the series down to only a half hour show and then cancelled it halfway throught the '72-'73 television season. The executives at NBC I guess didn't have a clue just how great NG was and probably couldn't comprehend the genius of Rod Serling who is and will always be to me the greatest writer for televison.There were 15 episodes during the last season of NG. Among the better stories I think are  THE RETURN OF THE SORCERER starring Vincent Price and Bill Bixby,  SPECTRE IN TAP-SHOES starring Sandra Dee, YOU CAN COME UP NOW, MRS. MILLIKAN starring Ozzie and Harriet Nelson, THE OTHER WAY OUT with Ross Martin and Burl Ives and FINNEGAN'S FLIGHT with Burgess Meredith. Some of the other big name actors that appeared in the third season include Mickey Rooney, Leonard Nimoy, Chuck Connors, Dean Stockwell and Sally Field.Also included is the missing story from the second season that was missing from the season 2 DVD set. It has been a true concern from ""Night Gallery"" fans far and wide if WITCHES' FEAST would be found and added to the season three set. Well it is official. It has!!!

1519505,A3VAXB8CDYY5BG,B006TBYC76,The Wingchair Critic,"[21, 33]","Despite Rod Serling's continued presence as host and script writer and a sterling cast of guest stars including Ozzie & Harriet Nelson, Sally Field, Dean Stockwell, Bill Bixby, Vincent Price, Stuart Whitman, Leonard Nimoy, and Geraldine Page, 'Night Gallery, Season Three' (originally broadcast in 1973) is simply awful.The format has been altered from the previous two seasons, so that each episode contains a single 24-minute episode. Almost every script suffers from static shoe-horning; some plots are dragged out far beyond their potential, while others, like the underdeveloped and badly-executed 'Whisper,' seem abruptly curtailed.Many, including 'Whisper' as well as 'Fright Night,' the inexplicable 'She'll Be Company For You,' and 'The Ring with the Red Velvet Ropes,' simply make no sense whatsoever or leave too many pertinent questions unanswered. For example, in and 'The Ring with the Red Velvet Ropes,' why does the Gary Lockward character have a vision of the boxer he's just beaten in the ring? How did he arrive at the mansion in question? Why is the alcoholic woman in 'Something in the woodwork' terrified of the ghost in her former spouse's body, when she's shown no fear of either the ghost or her spouse at any earlier point?'Season Three' begins ominously with the flat and overtly predictable 'Return of the Sorcerer,' which was clearly produced on the cheapest, tackiest sets imaginable. Not even the sterling presences of Vincent Price and Bill Bixby can animate it or make it interesting.One can only assume that most of the actors involved in 'Season Three' chose to participate due to the relatively high quality of 'Season Two,' which produced such excellent episodes as 'Brenda,' 'Pickman's Model,' 'Green Fingers,' 'Sins of the Father,' 'The Messiah on Mott Street,' the hilarious 'Professor Peabody's Last Lecture,' and 'Secret Snow, Silent Snow,' all of which, with 'They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's Bar' from Season One, come as close to being minor 'classics' as the show ever produced.The general impression 'Season Three' provides is that the producers knew that the show was being cancelled before the shooting of the first episode began, and thus hackneyed, unchallenging stories were adapted, every script was forced into production with the minimum of thought or editing, the flimsiest sets and most inexpensive special effects were utilized*, and the first take was used in each case. Every episode feels like it was created in clockwork fashion, with all expertise, skill, and genius left at the door.Even Gil Mell&eacute;'s stunning, wholly electronic score from the earlier seasons is replaced with music far more vapid, and the highly effective opening title sequence has been replaced as well.Admirers of Serling can only imagine what he must have felt during production.* The gorilla costume used in 'Hatred Unto Death' looks exactly like the one used ten years earlier in 'The Beverly Hillbillies' arc in which Granny forced a maid's costume on a gorilla (actually a man in a costume hired by Mr. Drysdale), gave it a feather duster, and put it to work cleaning the Clampett mansion.",1,The Gallery In Eclipse,1334275200,"04 13, 2012",2012,3135,"['Rod', 'Serling', 'continued', 'presence', 'host', 'script', 'writer', 'sterling', 'cast', 'guest', 'stars', 'including', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'Nelson', 'Sally', 'Field', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Stuart', 'Whitman', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'Gallery', 'Season', 'Three', 'originally', 'broadcast', '1973', 'simply', 'awful.The', 'format', 'been', 'altered', 'previous', 'two', 'seasons', 'episode', 'single', '24-minute', 'episode', 'script', 'suffers', 'static', 'shoe-horning', 'plots', 'are', 'dragged', 'out', 'far', 'potential', 'others', 'underdeveloped', 'badly-executed', ""'Whisper"", 'seem', 'abruptly', 'curtailed.Many', 'including', ""'Whisper"", 'as', 'well', ""'Fright"", 'Night', 'inexplicable', ""'ll"", 'Be', 'Company', ""'The"", 'Ring', 'Red', 'Velvet', 'Ropes', 'simply', 'make', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'leave', 'too', 'many', 'pertinent', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'example', ""'The"", 'Ring', 'Red', 'Velvet', 'Ropes', 'why', 'Gary', 'Lockward', 'character', 'have', 'vision', 'boxer', 'just', 'beaten', 'ring', 'How', 'did', 'arrive', 'mansion', 'question', 'Why', 'alcoholic', 'woman', ""'Something"", 'woodwork', 'terrified', 'ghost', 'former', 'spouse', 'body', 'when', 'shown', 'fear', 'ghost', 'spouse', 'earlier', 'point', 'Three', 'ominously', 'flat', 'overtly', 'predictable', ""'Return"", 'Sorcerer', 'was', 'clearly', 'produced', 'cheapest', 'tackiest', 'sets', 'imaginable', 'Not', 'even', 'sterling', 'presences', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'can', 'animate', 'make', 'interesting.One', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'most', 'actors', 'involved', ""'Season"", 'Three', 'chose', 'participate', 'due', 'relatively', 'high', 'quality', ""'Season"", 'Two', 'produced', 'such', 'excellent', 'episodes', ""'Brenda"", ""'Pickman"", 'Model', ""'Green"", 'Fingers', ""'Sins"", 'Father', ""'The"", 'Messiah', 'Mott', 'Street', 'hilarious', ""'Professor"", 'Peabody', 'Last', 'Lecture', 'Snow', 'Silent', 'Snow', ""'They"", ""'re"", 'Tearing', 'Down', 'Tim', 'Riley', 'Bar', 'Season', 'One', 'come', 'close', 'being', 'minor', ""'classics"", 'show', 'ever', 'general', 'impression', 'Three', 'producers', 'knew', 'show', 'was', 'being', 'cancelled', 'shooting', 'first', 'episode', 'began', 'thus', 'hackneyed', 'unchallenging', 'stories', 'were', 'adapted', 'script', 'was', 'forced', 'production', 'minimum', 'thought', 'editing', 'flimsiest', 'sets', 'most', 'inexpensive', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'utilized*', 'first', 'take', 'was', 'used', 'case', 'episode', 'feels', 'was', 'created', 'clockwork', 'fashion', 'expertise', 'skill', 'genius', 'left', 'door.Even', 'Gil', 'Mell', 'eacute', 'stunning', 'wholly', 'electronic', 'score', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'replaced', 'music', 'far', 'more', 'vapid', 'highly', 'effective', 'opening', 'title', 'sequence', 'been', 'replaced', 'well.Admirers', 'Serling', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'production', '*', 'gorilla', 'costume', 'used', ""'Hatred"", 'Unto', 'Death', 'exactly', 'one', 'used', 'ten', 'years', 'earlier', ""'The"", 'Beverly', 'Hillbillies', 'arc', 'Granny', 'forced', 'maid', 'costume', 'gorilla', 'actually', 'man', 'costume', 'hired', 'Mr.', 'Drysdale', 'gave', 'feather', 'duster', 'put', 'work', 'cleaning', 'Clampett', 'mansion']",Night Gallery: Season Three

1519508,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B006TBYC76,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[17, 18]","Always lingering in the shadow of ""Twilight Zone"", ""Night Gallery"" never received the love or critical respect that Rod Serling's first TV series received. Serling gave up creative control for ""Night Gallery"" hoping he would work less unfortunately that wasn't often the case as he would battle producer Jack Laird and others at Universal to insure a quality series. Although Sterling's name was above the title (so-to-speak), ""Night Gallery"" was as much writer-producer-director Jack Laird's show as it was Serling's.The third season of ""Night Gallery"" still managed to have a number of classic episodes even though they were sometimes fewer and far between compared to seasons one and two.Universal has done a stellar job with the transfers for the third season (much as they did with the second). The show does look soft on occasion but the overall presentation is quite nice. Image quality is surprisingly good with nice detail and although the colors are a bit subdued by modern standards, that's the look of the show itself and was pretty typical of early 70's TV shows.The mono soundtrack sounds nice and clear although there is some dullness that creeps in on some of the ""lost"" episodes simply because they had to use a variety of sources for the sound to complete them.Subtitles are in English (SDH).The special features include commentary tracks from Scott Skelton and Jim Benson who run TV Time Machine. Both Benson and Skelton worked with Universal to reconstruct the ""lost"" episodes from season two. Many of these episodes were ""lost"" because they were radically recut (""Die Now, Pay Later""), couldn't be located ""Witches Feast"" (which comes from a pristine beautiful looking 35mm print), have footage restoredthat never aired ""Little Girl Lost"" and also includes the short ""Room For One Less"" all with commentary tracks by Skelton and Benson discussing what happened to the episodes and how they were restored.All of the extras and effort that Skelton, Benson and Universal put into this two disc set bumps it up from three to four stars.",4,"Third season of ""Night Gallery"" arrives with ""lost"" and restored episodes, commentary tracks",1334016000,"04 10, 2012",2012,2053,"['Always', 'lingering', 'shadow', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Night', 'Gallery', 'never', 'received', 'love', 'critical', 'respect', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'first', 'TV', 'series', 'received', 'Serling', 'gave', 'up', 'creative', 'control', 'Night', 'Gallery', 'hoping', 'would', 'work', 'less', 'unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'often', 'case', 'would', 'battle', 'producer', 'Jack', 'Laird', 'others', 'Universal', 'insure', 'quality', 'series', 'Sterling', 'name', 'was', 'title', 'so-to-speak', 'Night', 'Gallery', 'was', 'much', 'writer-producer-director', 'Jack', 'Laird', 'show', 'was', ""Serling's.The"", 'third', 'season', 'Night', 'Gallery', 'still', 'managed', 'have', 'number', 'classic', 'episodes', 'even', 'were', 'sometimes', 'fewer', 'far', 'compared', 'seasons', 'one', 'two.Universal', 'done', 'stellar', 'job', 'transfers', 'third', 'season', 'much', 'did', 'second', 'show', 'look', 'soft', 'occasion', 'overall', 'presentation', 'quite', 'nice', 'Image', 'quality', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'nice', 'detail', 'colors', 'are', 'bit', 'subdued', 'modern', 'standards', 'look', 'show', 'was', 'pretty', 'typical', 'early', '70', 'TV', 'shows.The', 'mono', 'soundtrack', 'nice', 'clear', 'dullness', 'lost', 'episodes', 'simply', 'had', 'use', 'variety', 'sources', 'sound', 'complete', 'them.Subtitles', 'are', 'English', 'SDH', '.The', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'Scott', 'Skelton', 'Jim', 'Benson', 'who', 'run', 'TV', 'Time', 'Machine', 'Both', 'Benson', 'Skelton', 'worked', 'Universal', 'reconstruct', 'lost', 'episodes', 'season', 'two', 'Many', 'episodes', 'were', 'lost', 'were', 'radically', 'recut', 'Die', 'Now', 'Pay', 'Later', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'located', 'Witches', 'Feast', 'pristine', 'beautiful', 'looking', '35mm', 'print', 'have', 'footage', 'restoredthat', 'never', 'aired', 'Little', 'Girl', 'Lost', 'also', 'short', 'Room', 'One', 'Less', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'Skelton', 'Benson', 'discussing', 'what', 'happened', 'episodes', 'how', 'were', 'restored.All', 'extras', 'effort', 'Skelton', 'Benson', 'Universal', 'put', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'bumps', 'up', 'three', 'four', 'stars']",Night Gallery: Season Three
