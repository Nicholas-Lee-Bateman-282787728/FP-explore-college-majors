52700,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,0783225725,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[8, 13]","High Plains Drifter stands as a testament to the spirit of the art-film Western, and carries the Sergio Leone inspired existential qualities within  it.  The Stranger (Clint Eastwood) rides into a corrupt town full of  cowards, blows some of 'em away, and takes advantage of a luscious female.  I consider it a misinterpretation to call what Clint does rape.  His  character basically treats people exactly the way they deserve, and this  hot blonde in effect approached him, not vice-versa.  As Bill Curtis (who  played a munchkin in the Wizard of Oz) says, she tries to kill him because  she loved the sex, but afterwards he ignored her.Ambiguities abound in  the film.  Is the Stranger the ghost of the marshall that the town had  killed?  The film implies this, hence he knows a lot more about the  townspeople then he lets on.  Also contains an impeccable understated  performance from Verna Bloom.  At the heart of all this is sweet revenge,  and the Stranger gets it good.  Ranks with The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,  Once Upon a Time in the West, and the Hired Hand as one of the all time  great Westerns.",5,One of the Great Existential Westerns,964915200,"07 30, 2000",2000,1114,"['High', 'Plains', 'Drifter', 'testament', 'spirit', 'art-film', 'Western', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'inspired', 'existential', 'qualities', 'Stranger', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'corrupt', 'town', 'full', 'cowards', 'away', 'advantage', 'luscious', 'female', 'consider', 'misinterpretation', 'call', 'what', 'Clint', 'rape', 'character', 'basically', 'people', 'exactly', 'way', 'deserve', 'hot', 'blonde', 'effect', 'approached', 'not', 'vice-versa', 'Bill', 'Curtis', 'who', 'played', 'munchkin', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'kill', 'loved', 'sex', 'afterwards', 'ignored', 'her.Ambiguities', 'abound', 'film', 'Stranger', 'ghost', 'marshall', 'town', 'had', 'killed', 'film', 'hence', 'lot', 'more', 'townspeople', 'then', 'Also', 'impeccable', 'understated', 'performance', 'Verna', 'Bloom', 'heart', 'sweet', 'revenge', 'Stranger', 'good', 'Ranks', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Ugly', 'Once', 'Time', 'West', 'Hired', 'Hand', 'one', 'time', 'great', 'Westerns']",N/A

I love the movies he directs, he has a unique style that is far superior to most of what Hollywood has to offer.

52717,A1LHVIU8KL5S9T,0783225725,"Christopher William Jack ""megavengeanceman""","[3, 3]","""High Plains Drifter"" is a sort of Horror Western. A awesome mix of Clint Eastwood western and supernatural revenge saga with its' eerie score and familiar ""man-with-no-name-enters-small-western-town"" introduction followed by lots of moral ambiguity and a sort of unholy retribution. Clint plays the title character like he plays most of his action roles as a tough, soft spoken and surly gunslinger, only his actions prove less heroic here amidst a slew of gun battles, humiliations, dynamite and even a troubling sexual assault. Playing like the scarred flip side of his later ""Pale Rider"" (1987), this offers Eastwood as a more punishing force but no less mystical as he seems invulnerable and disappears into landscape by the film's end. Instead of bringing the town together to fight greedy tycoons and their bounty killers from ""Pale Rider"", he turns the town on each other and continues to mock, degrade or annihilate any of its' denizens with the exception of a saloonkeeper's wife and a dwarf played by Billy Curtis. The town harbors a terrible secret that Eastwood's character seems to have been summoned up from thin air to discipline them all for.

52719,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,0783225725,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[8, 11]","By the late 1960s Academy Award winner Clint Eastwood (Pale Rider, Unforgiven) had certainly established himself as an actor with such features as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), Hang 'Em High (1968), Where Eagles Dare (1968) before also taking on the role as director in his film Play Misty for Me (1971).  High Plains Drifter (1973) was Eastwood's 2nd directing gig, written by Ernest Tidyman (Shaft, The French Connection) and featuring Eastwood himself.  Also appearing is Verna Bloom (Animal House), Geoffrey Lewis (Every Which Way But Loose), Marianna Hill (Schizoid), Mitch Ryan (Lethal Weapon), Jack Ging (SSSSSSS), Stefan Gierasch (Silver Streak), Ted Hartley (Ice Station Zebra), Walter Barnes (Every Which Way But Loose), Anthony James (Unforgiven), Dan Vadis (Bronco Billy), and Billy Curtis, one of many little people featured in the film The Wizard of Oz (1939).The film, which takes place in a seaside mining town known as Lago, begins as we see a lone horseback rider (Eastwood) traveling across a shimmering desert landscape, making his way towards town.  His arrival draws much attention, particularly in three gun-toting yahoos who, after getting uppity with the stranger, soon find themselves dead.  Turns out the trio weren't just you run of the mill riff raff, but gunmen hired by the town for protection, specifically against three other men, soon to be released from prison, who the townsfolk believe will return for revenge (seems the three men currently in prison once held the position the three now deceased men held, that is before a particular incident occurred and they were railroaded into jail).  Anyway, the town leaders, now without their hired guns, decide to offer the stranger the position of protectorate, given the ease in which he dispatched their previous choices, and the stranger accepts only after being promised complete run of the town.  The deal seems like a good one, that is until the stranger starts taking liberties above and beyond what they believe to be fair and equitable, causing consternation among more than a few residents (as a result the townspeople start turning on each other).  As the stranger begins making good on his end of the bargain (setting up drills and such with the men in the town), the three men, including Stacey Bridges (Lewis) and his cousins Cole and Dan Carlin (James and Vadis, respectively) are released from prison and proceed to make their way towards Lago, their intent being to seek reparations against the town that had done them wrong.  As the town prepares for their arrival (including a spiffy, new paint job, at the stranger's behest), we continue to learn more and more of a past incident within the town, one that gruesome secret shared by all, rationalized away by most.For me this was a very straightforward tale of what goes around, comes around, especially in terms of everyone in Lago getting exactly what they deserved based on their level of involvement in past, unspeakable events.  I've had stuff in my life come back to bite me in the ash, but never to the extent depicted here...then again I never found myself in the position of either participating or witnessing a brutal crime (and doing nothing to help).  At various points in the film Eastwood's character's identity is questioned, to which it's never flat out specified but given key aspects of the film it seemed pretty obvious to me.  The short dream sequence early one should provide a good idea of where his character is coming from and if not, then the final sequence should (hint, there's a metaphysical element involved).  While Eastwood's character here does not have a name, that aspect is not meant to reflect on some of his earlier Italian made westerns where his character was generally not identified as the characters there and here are not the same.  There's plenty of nastiness in the film including some whippings, cold-blooded murders, acts of misogyny, and so on, but interestingly enough, they all seem to have their place within the story, especially given what we learn in terms of despicable secret most all in the town share.  That's not to say all the actions by the stranger were justified but given the underlying circumstances they weren't entirely unexpected.  Overall I think I had a pretty good handle on the characters (their motivations, where they were coming from, etc.), except for the one female character played by Marianna Hill, who seemed a real weirdo.  Her character would glom onto the most dominant male figure present to which she would then seem to resent them, particularly so with the stranger, but perhaps this was a result that Eastwood's character's interest in her was superficial at best, something which she felt and wasn't accustomed.  Regardless, she was one of those women who should wear a sign around her neck stating `Look, but don't touch'.  As far as Eastwood, well, he's Eastwood, and presents himself a much as one would expect in a role like this (cool, distant, and enigmatic).  I thought his direction wonderful along with his performance.  As far as the rest of the cast, primarily made up of character actors, I thought they all did very well, and the story provided just enough material and attention on each given their respective roles within the film.  My favorite part of the film, besides the confrontation sequence at the end, comes near the beginning as Eastwood's character arrives into town, enters the saloon, and begins getting verbally hassled by the three roughnecks to which he brushes them off and heads off for a shave and a bath, the three troublemakers not far behind.  They continue with the verbal jabs, and when they fail to get a rise out of him, they turn violent, forcing the stranger to react, resulting in a lesson learned by all not to mess with the bull lest you get the horns.  All in all I thought this a great film, and one of the better westerns to come out of the 1970s.The picture, presented in widescreen (2.35:1), looks pretty decent, but could have used a little cleaning up, in my opinion, as there's slight flaws present throughout (when I say `slight flaws', I mean minor dust flecks and such, but nothing overly obvious).  The audio, presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 mono, in both English and French, comes through very well.  As far as extras there's production notes, cast and crew biographies, a theatrical trailer, and subtitles in English and Spanish.Cookieman108",5,"""Only problem you've got Sheriff is a short supply of

52720,A1Z3LU078VNOA6,0783225725,C. Wynes,"[4, 5]","A stranger rides into town, appearing as if out of nothing through the haze.  This town is called ""Lago"", and is owned primarily by a mining company.  Nobody in town seems to have seen a stranger in quite some time.  The mining company has had quite some difficulty in the past with its hired guns.  A year or so earlier, they had three hired gunslingers protecting the town and the mine, but those had turned on a marshall to protect the mine's secret and been incarcerated.  The three replacements meet a quick end when they confront the stranger.  So, of course, the logical thing to do is enlist this strange drifter to protect the town from the first three gunslingers, now due to be released from prison.Eastwood's first western as a director is dark, sinister and mysterious.  This is a very atypical western, and is soaked in the cynical pessimism of 1970's cinema.  The stranger promises the townspeople that he can show them how to defend themselves, but when it comes down to it they have very little interest in defending themselves.  Flashback scenes show the townspeople hiding in shadow as the marshall was mercilessly whipped to death by the mining company's hired goons.  This is a town that has truly turned its back on the light, cowardly embracing the darkness.Truth and justice are the themes of all great westerns.  This film portrays a town so weakened by its own abandonment of those values that when faced with its own destruction it lacks the moral conviction to save itself from the lawless gunslingers who aspire to take what they feel is their due.  The townspeople are destroyed by their own moral corruption, and are impotent to defend themselves against evil because they have lost the ability to see themselves as the good.Is the stranger the old marshall?  The flashback scnes have Eastwood playing the role, as the marshall is bullwhipped for having discovered the mine's secret.  But the marshall has a grave, a fact the stranger remarks upon at the close of the film.  Is he a ghost of the marshall, an agent of justice visited upon the people of Lago to exact penance?  The film leaves this question open for the viewer.The stranger himself commits an act of sexual violence in an early scene, one which would be considered rather politically incorrect these days.  A woman takes an interest in the stranger, a woman who had stood calmly and watched the old marshall die.  She endeavors to bump into him, and he sees right through the charade.  He takes her to a stable and has his way with her.  It is never quite clear whether this is truly a rape.  She later claims it to be, but she embraced him during the sexual act.  Either way the act itself has no moral value, because the stranger simply allows the lack of morality in the townspeople to manifest itself in the way it responds to any act of wrongdoing.This is a dark western that shows much of the brilliance Eastwood would later receive acknowledgement of in his long career directing dramatic works.  If you are considering purchasing this DVD, which has no extra features to boast about, I would recommend it to anyone who is an Eastwood fan or otherwise considers themselves open to the limitless possibilities of the western film genre.",4,Eastwood's first western as a director is dark and mysterious,1123372800,"08 7, 2005",2005,3239,"['stranger', 'town', 'appearing', 'nothing', 'haze', 'town', 'called', 'Lago', 'owned', 'primarily', 'mining', 'company', 'Nobody', 'town', 'have', 'seen', 'stranger', 'quite', 'time', 'mining', 'company', 'had', 'quite', 'difficulty', 'past', 'hired', 'guns', 'year', 'so', 'earlier', 'had', 'three', 'hired', 'gunslingers', 'protecting', 'town', 'mine', 'had', 'turned', 'marshall', 'protect', 'mine', 'secret', 'been', 'incarcerated', 'three', 'replacements', 'meet', 'quick', 'end', 'when', 'confront', 'stranger', 'So', 'course', 'logical', 'thing', 'do', 'enlist', 'strange', 'drifter', 'protect', 'town', 'first', 'three', 'gunslingers', 'now', 'due', 'be', 'released', 'prison.Eastwood', 'first', 'western', 'director', 'dark', 'sinister', 'mysterious', 'very', 'atypical', 'western', 'soaked', 'cynical', 'pessimism', '1970', 'cinema', 'stranger', 'townspeople', 'can', 'show', 'how', 'defend', 'when', 'down', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'interest', 'defending', 'Flashback', 'show', 'townspeople', 'hiding', 'shadow', 'marshall', 'was', 'mercilessly', 'whipped', 'death', 'mining', 'company', 'hired', 'goons', 'town', 'truly', 'turned', 'back', 'light', 'cowardly', 'embracing', 'darkness.Truth', 'justice', 'are', 'themes', 'great', 'westerns', 'film', 'town', 'so', 'weakened', 'own', 'abandonment', 'values', 'when', 'faced', 'own', 'destruction', 'moral', 'conviction', 'save', 'lawless', 'gunslingers', 'who', 'aspire', 'take', 'what', 'feel', 'due', 'townspeople', 'are', 'destroyed', 'own', 'moral', 'corruption', 'are', 'impotent', 'defend', 'evil', 'have', 'lost', 'ability', 'see', 'good.Is', 'stranger', 'old', 'marshall', 'flashback', 'scnes', 'have', 'Eastwood', 'playing', 'role', 'marshall', 'bullwhipped', 'having', 'discovered', 'mine', 'secret', 'marshall', 'grave', 'fact', 'stranger', 'remarks', 'close', 'film', 'ghost', 'marshall', 'agent', 'justice', 'visited', 'people', 'Lago', 'exact', 'penance', 'film', 'question', 'open', 'viewer.The', 'stranger', 'act', 'sexual', 'violence', 'early', 'scene', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'rather', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'days', 'woman', 'interest', 'stranger', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'stood', 'calmly', 'watched', 'old', 'marshall', 'die', 'bump', 'right', 'charade', 'stable', 'way', 'never', 'quite', 'clear', 'truly', 'rape', 'later', 'be', 'embraced', 'sexual', 'act', 'way', 'act', 'moral', 'value', 'stranger', 'simply', 'lack', 'morality', 'townspeople', 'manifest', 'way', 'act', 'wrongdoing.This', 'dark', 'western', 'much', 'brilliance', 'Eastwood', 'would', 'later', 'receive', 'acknowledgement', 'long', 'career', 'directing', 'dramatic', 'works', 'are', 'considering', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'extra', 'features', 'boast', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'Eastwood', 'fan', 'otherwise', 'considers', 'open', 'limitless', 'possibilities', 'western', 'film', 'genre']",N/A

52726,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0783225725,Dennis Littrell,"[11, 12]","Obviously this was produced before the age of feminist political correctness.  The anti-hero with no name--Clint Eastwood, of course, a throwback to his days making spaghetti westerns in Italy with Sergio Leone--comes riding tall in the saddle down into a valley with a mining town by a lake.  (The movie was shot around the Mono Lake area of California.)  Particularly effective in this unforgettable opening scene is the music sounding like the high whine of the wind off of the desert.  This town would be ""Lago"" later to be renamed ""Hell"" by Eastwood's character who is identified in the titles as ""The Stranger.""The stranger really just wants a shave and a bath and something to drink and eat and place to lay his head for the night.  What he gets is a bad time from some roughnecks and a woman (Callie Travers, played by Marianna Hill) who has attraction/avoidance feelings for him.  He shoots the three guys and rapes the woman before the movie is twenty minutes old.  What I mean by this not being politically correct is that, despite herself, she likes it!  That sort of thing is not done in cinema these days.  The idea that a woman might be turned on by being raped would not play before today's audiences, nor would a Hollywood producer make such a film.I won't go any further into the plot but suffice it to say that Eastwood is just beginning to kick tail.  It seems that everybody in town is cowardly and without the will to protect themselves from the bad guys, especially the three who just got out of jail and are headed their way.  How Eastwood, who directed from a script by Ernest Tidyman (The French Connection [1971]; Shaft [1971] etc.), handles the familar revenge theme is interesting.First it is no accident that Eastwood's protagonist is named ""the Stranger.""  That is the English title of a famous novel by Albert Camus that surely influenced Eastwood.  Camus's stranger is an existential anti-hero, a kind of benign sociopath who really doesn't feel anything for others except as they affect his life.  But he is not particularly violent and just lives from one day to the next without any direction or goal.  He just ""exists.""Eastwood's stranger does more than just exist.  He takes action, and he is very good at it.  Indeed, I can't recall a western movie in which a gunman could draw faster or shot straighter, or any movie hero who was less afraid of putting his life on the line.  So, in a sense what Eastwood has added to Camus's stranger is Nietzsche's superman.  And herein lies, I think, the underpinning of Eastwood's philosophy and his ""message.""  Note that the people in the town to a man are cowardly.  The only exception is Sarah Belding (Verna Bloom) who, like the aforementioned Callie Travers, can't resist the stranger's forceful charm, and falls in love with him.  This somehow inspires her to leave the corrupt town.Yes, the town, like most of human society is corrupt.  And yes the average man in the street is cowardly and without the will to defend himself.  It is only the ubermensch, that rare breed celebrated in the works of the German philosopher, who has the skill, the strength and the will to bend events to his liking and to take on those who would use violence to achieve their ends.So what Eastwood does here in his second directorial effort (following Play Misty for Me, 1971) is to diverge from Leone's formula.  While there is some very funny and intentionally ridiculous dialogue in such films as, for example,  The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966), or For a Few Dollars More (1965) or A Fistful of Dollars (1964), there is little that is funny, intentionally or otherwise in High Plains Drifter.  Furthermore, whereas Leone just wanted to make a buck and saw that tough-minded heroes or anti-heroes involved in action-filled revenge plots was a good way to do it, Eastwood is interested in also making a philosophic (and perhaps political) statement.  We are degenerate, we humans, he is saying, except for those rare individuals who take the law into their own hands, make their own rules, and through superior skill and bravery, make their own luck and create their own reality, as does his stranger.In this film there is also an element of the supernatural, or so it would appear.  The stranger ""sees"" in his head the whipping of a past sheriff of the town.  Perhaps it comes from the mind of the dwarf Mordecai (very well played by Billy Curtis, by the way) who witnessed the tortured death while hiding under the saloon.  At any rate, the stranger shows that he is just as handy with the whip himself as he is with his six-gun.By all means see this for an early look at the work of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director.

We learn the killers were set up by their employers--the Lago city fathers; and we learn why law-abiding citizens stood silently and looked the other way when their marshal was murdered.  With the outlaws released and on their way back to Lago to extract numerous pounds of flesh, the Stranger is revealed for who he really is:  a metaphysical Avenger who not only claims vengeance for the murder. . .but for the actions of those who were so callously duplicitous.While Clint Eastwood has more than his fair share of locker room humor in his portrayal of the Stranger, he succeeds in coming across as a terrifying and inhumane force.

This time 'round, in his first directorial western, there's an extremely effective supernatural mood to the film; is the Stranger the ghost of the sherrif?  Is he his brother? You never can tell, and this only helps to enhance your viewing experience.  Aside from that, HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER is actually a little short on action.  But it saves it for some brief but brutal moments throughout the film (especially the climax, which I felt to be a litle anitclimatic.)  The acting ranges from first-rate to mediocre, but most of the cast is fairly decent.  Billy Barty is the most memorable as the pushed-around dwarf who, via the Stanger's unique form of persuasion, becomes both mayor and sheriff.  The soundtrack is really weird; while the main theme during the opening and closing credits is very eerie, the rest of it kinds [stinks].  The landscape, however, makes up for it, as it is some of the best I've ever seen.

52736,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,0783225725,Erik North,"[5, 6]","Having made an impressive debut as a director (as well as actor) in 1971 with PLAY MISTY FOR ME, Clint Eastwood turned his attention back to the genre that made him famous--the Western.  HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER was that movie.  And while it does bear a resemblance to the spaghetti westerns Eastwood made in the 1960s with director Sergio Leone as ""The Man With No Name"", it also takes on some chilling supernatural overtones.Eastwood here is the mysterious title character who rides into the town of Lago, at the foot of the eastern Sierra Nevada at the edge of Mono Lake.  The townsfolk are immediately suspicious of him and scared, and they have every reason to be.  Only a year before, they witnessed their previous sheriff murdered by a trio of ruthless gunmen because the sheriff found out that Lago sat on valuable land owned by the federal government.  Instead of stopping the murder, they allowed it to happen.But the more often Eastwood's character gets to have his way with the town, the more the people of Lago begin to turn on one another.  When word gets out that the three men (Geoffrey Lewis; Anthony James; Scott Walker) the town hired to kill the sheriff are let out of jail and vow to get revenge on the town, they realize they need Eastwood's help.  But Eastwood doesn't let Lago's residents off so easily.  Having ordered the town decorated blood red and renamed Hell, Eastwood disappears, while the townsfolk cower in fear at the outlaws return.  But the mysterious High Plains Drifter has a surprise for all concerned...Thanks to a very good screenplay by Ernest Tidyman (SHAFT; THE FRENCH CONNECTION) and Eastwood's directing and acting, HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, despite its occasionally graphic violence and a fairly nasty rape scene involving Eastwood's mysterious stranger and one of the few women (Verna Bloom) in Lago, is one of Eastwood's best films, and one of the best westerns of the 1970s.  Eastwood's charachter may very well be an avenging angel, or even, tantalizingly enough, the ghost of the sheriff who was allowed by the town to be brutally murdered, thus giving the movie a creepy quality akin less to the spaghetti westerns and more to the gothic horror genre.  The psychological tensions in the town are laid out fairly well, and Lewis and his outlaw partners are appropriately nasty.  Billy Curtis' supporting role as the town midget, and the only one sympathetic to Eastwood's cause, is an interesting and offbeat one, and it works.Eastwood actually filmed HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER on the shores of Mono Lake itself; the whole town of Lago was built from scratch.  With superb cinematography by Bruce Surtees and a haunting score by Dee Barton that echoes Ennio Morricone's scores for Leone, HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER is a long way away from the John Wayne school, especially in terms of violence, but it remains an impressive mark on Eastwood's long resume as both actor and director.",4,HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER--The First True Supernatural Western,1098403200,"10 22, 2004",2004,2912,"['Having', 'made', 'impressive', 'debut', 'director', 'as', 'well', 'actor', '1971', 'PLAY', 'MISTY', 'ME', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'turned', 'attention', 'back', 'genre', 'made', 'famous', 'Western', 'HIGH', 'PLAINS', 'DRIFTER', 'was', 'movie', 'bear', 'resemblance', 'spaghetti', 'westerns', 'Eastwood', 'made', '1960s', 'director', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'Man', 'Name', 'also', 'chilling', 'supernatural', 'overtones.Eastwood', 'here', 'mysterious', 'title', 'character', 'who', 'town', 'Lago', 'foot', 'eastern', 'Sierra', 'Nevada', 'edge', 'Mono', 'Lake', 'townsfolk', 'are', 'immediately', 'suspicious', 'scared', 'have', 'reason', 'be', 'Only', 'year', 'before', 'witnessed', 'previous', 'sheriff', 'murdered', 'trio', 'ruthless', 'gunmen', 'sheriff', 'found', 'out', 'Lago', 'sat', 'valuable', 'land', 'owned', 'federal', 'government', 'Instead', 'stopping', 'murder', 'allowed', 'happen.But', 'more', 'often', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'have', 'way', 'town', 'more', 'people', 'Lago', 'begin', 'turn', 'one', 'When', 'word', 'out', 'three', 'men', 'Geoffrey', 'Lewis', 'Anthony', 'James', 'Scott', 'Walker', 'town', 'hired', 'kill', 'sheriff', 'are', 'let', 'jail', 'vow', 'get', 'revenge', 'town', 'realize', 'need', 'Eastwood', 'help', 'Eastwood', ""n't"", 'let', 'Lago', 'residents', 'so', 'easily', 'Having', 'ordered', 'town', 'decorated', 'blood', 'red', 'renamed', 'Hell', 'Eastwood', 'disappears', 'townsfolk', 'cower', 'fear', 'outlaws', 'return', 'mysterious', 'High', 'Plains', 'Drifter', 'surprise', 'concerned', 'Thanks', 'very', 'good', 'screenplay', 'Ernest', 'Tidyman', 'SHAFT', 'THE', 'FRENCH', 'CONNECTION', 'Eastwood', 'directing', 'acting', 'HIGH', 'PLAINS', 'DRIFTER', 'occasionally', 'graphic', 'violence', 'fairly', 'nasty', 'rape', 'scene', 'involving', 'Eastwood', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'one', 'few', 'women', 'Verna', 'Bloom', 'Lago', 'one', 'Eastwood', 'best', 'films', 'one', 'best', 'westerns', '1970s', 'Eastwood', 'charachter', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'avenging', 'angel', 'even', 'tantalizingly', 'enough', 'ghost', 'sheriff', 'who', 'was', 'allowed', 'town', 'be', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'thus', 'giving', 'movie', 'creepy', 'quality', 'akin', 'less', 'spaghetti', 'westerns', 'more', 'gothic', 'horror', 'genre', 'psychological', 'tensions', 'town', 'are', 'laid', 'out', 'fairly', 'well', 'Lewis', 'outlaw', 'partners', 'are', 'appropriately', 'nasty', 'Billy', 'Curtis', 'supporting', 'role', 'town', 'midget', 'only', 'one', 'sympathetic', 'Eastwood', 'cause', 'interesting', 'offbeat', 'one', 'works.Eastwood', 'actually', 'filmed', 'HIGH', 'PLAINS', 'DRIFTER', 'shores', 'Mono', 'Lake', 'whole', 'town', 'Lago', 'was', 'built', 'scratch', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'Bruce', 'Surtees', 'haunting', 'score', 'Dee', 'Barton', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'scores', 'Leone', 'HIGH', 'PLAINS', 'DRIFTER', 'long', 'way', 'away', 'John', 'Wayne', 'school', 'especially', 'terms', 'violence', 'impressive', 'mark', 'Eastwood', 'long', 'resume', 'actor', 'director']",N/A

This was Eastwood's 3rd film (after Play Misty for Me and Breezy), and it still remains one of his best films.  Misty and Breezy are excellent films, but this one is far better than both of them.  Many critics have said this is a tongue in cheek Western.  I digress strongly.  Yes, there are humourous elements in it, but it's a morally complex, eerie, and brilliant piece of filmmaking.  Eastwood's character doesn't really have a name, but this isn't an extension of his work with Sergio Leone.  It has a lot to do with revenge, karma, greed, and what small town America in the west was really like.  It wasn't like the idealised, ""God-fearing"" folk (that cliche gets a real takedown in this film) you see in typical Hollywood westerns.  The ending is downright surreal, but it works brilliantly.  Even the supporting players (especially Billy Curtis) are excellent here.  A decent number of Eastwood's films have some bad acting in them in the supporting roles, but here that doesn't happen.

Do you know, if you rip off the fronts of houses that you'd find swine? The world's a hell.""No, those lines are not from Clint Eastwood's 1973 masterpiece ""High Plains Drifter.""  Actually, they were spoken by Joseph Cotten in Alfred Hitchcock's 1943 suspense movie, ""Shadow of a Doubt.""  But no other words can better capture the essence of this darkest and bleakest of Westerns.Clint Eastwood reprises his most famous role, ""The Man With No Name"" that made him a household name in such Sergio Leone movies as ""For a Few Dollars More"" and ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.""  Some people claim this movie as a ""revisionist Western,"" but to me it is a little more complicated than that.  ""High Plains Drifter"" is a harrowing admixture of elements from such disparate works as ""High Noon,"" ""Peyton Place,"" ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" and Dante's ""Inferno.""When the Man With No Name comes riding into the Texas hamlet of Lago, he immediately strikes fear in the hearts of the local townspeople.  Hiding behind the facade of piety and the pioneer work-ethic lies a craven, dark secret which the town will keep shrouded at any cost.Peopled only by bullies and cowards, the town is immediately torn apart by Eastwood -- executing the local goon squad who try to rough him up, raping the town prostitute, setting neighbour against neighbour and exposing the town preacher as a craven, hypocritical fraud.It soon becomes evident to the town that the stranger has come to avenege the death of their marshal, who was bullwhipped to death in the town square as everyone watched, none of the men lifting a finger to help him or to stop the killers.So, when the stranger shows up, the Marshal's killers are about to be released from prison.  The cowardly town Sheriff tries to hire the newcomer as a gunfighter to face down the killers, but Eastwood turns the tables on him and the town and soon has conscripted the town's spineless men in a local volunteer regiment to ambush the killers when they ride into town.  This is a neat twist on ""High Noon,"" in which Gary Cooper's Sheriff Will Kane had to face the men who swore to kill him alone, because no one in the town had the guts to help him; in ""High Plains Drifter,"" no-one has the guts to refuse the Man With No Name, for fear _he'd_ kill them.What is so compelling about ""High Plains Drifter"" is Eastwood's complex portrayal of executioner and avenging angel: Unlike in ""Shadow of a Doubt,"" Eastwood is no sociopathic murderer, as was Cotten's Charlie Oakley; Rather, the town of Lago *deserves* its violent demise, and -- as in ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" -- the Man With No Name icily exacts his revenge on the town ruthlessly, methodically.In ripping the facade of religiosity and respectability away from the town, he makes the only man with any courage in Lago -- the town midget, played by Bill Curtis -- the Mayor and Sheriff. The sets -- designed and built by Hitchcock set designers Henry Bumstead and George Milo -- play a key role in this movie.  Like any other frontier town in any Western, the buildings are standard issue: General store, hotel, church, saloon, livery stable, etc.  But, they are all constructed of bare wooden planks, without a drop of paint on them, save for the signs denoting their function.  Clearly, these buildings are naked citadels of greed, earmarked for gouging every last dollar and squeezing every last penny out of their customers and parishoners.  Only the mining office -- which hides the town's dark secret -- is whitewashed over to cover its sins.  It's a brilliant example of Bumstead's minimalistic Expressionism.The Man With No Name takes note of this, and before the killers' return, he orders the townsfolk to paint it a shocking, scarlet red.  The hotel owner protests, exclaiming ""it's going to look like Hell!""  Of course, all Eastwood does in response is squint and form an impish, ironic smile with his parched lips.The final scene is a brilliant deja-vu montage which recalls the Marshal's murder:  On a pitch-black night, the stranger horsewhips one of the killers to death, and guns his two partners down in intensely emotionless vengeance.  The stranger slowly walks away, finally cleansing Lago of its sin as the entire town burns in flames in a baptism by fire.I consider this movie to be Eastwood's greatest directorial effort, slightly above ""Bird"" and ""The Unforgiven.""

A mysterious stranger (Eastwood) rides his horse down a mountain toward the town Largo, out of a mist, as splendid music plays in the background. He passes a graveyard, which is significant, and rides into town, as the inhabitants gather at windows to watch him arrive. They sense something amiss, but do not know what. He is startled as he rides through town when he hears a stage coach driver snap his whip. He walks into a saloon, orders a beer, and is taunted by three thugs. He ignores them, strides across the muddy street to a barber shop for a shave and bath for ninety cents. The thugs follow him and try to shoot him, but he kills all three. The town people are amazed at his skill.As he falls asleep that night in a hotel, he sees/remembers a man being beaten to death with whips by three men, as he calls out to the town folks for help. They watch, but give no aid. The town leaders arrest the three while they are sleeping drunk, but not for the murder. Why, we wonder, did everyone do what they did? What prompted the beating? Were the citizens cowards or were they complicit in the murder? Who was killed?The three murderers are released from prison after serving their six month sentence and are returning to Largo for money and revenge. The town people are afraid of these gunfighters. They beg Eastwood to help them. They offer him anything he wants. He looks at the people with contempt. He agrees and takes whatever he wants. Among many other things, he seizes the hotel for himself, clutches expensive cloths,grabs many items and gives them as gifts, enters the saloon and orders free drinks for everybody, removes the mayor and sheriff from their offices and gives their jobs to a man the town despises. He helps the town prepare for the arrival of the three thugs by taking material from its citizens. He has the town painted red and changes its name on the sign that reads Largo to Hell. It is clear that he wants to destroy the town and hurt and perhaps kill its people.

The troubleshooters are put in prison for a year, but the ghost of the marshall comes back before they come out. He is at once attacked by three new troubleshooters and a virago-lady. He kills the three men and rapes the woman. Then he is proposed to become the gunfighter of the town against the three vengeful ex-cons who are arriving soon.

The inhabitants are left alone and are unable to resist to the burning of some buildings and to the killing of some men. They have no guts.

My favorite eastwood western would have to be outlaw josse wales and now this one. the mood in this film is ruminesant with the end of the call of the wild. I cant put my finger on what makes this film so memorable. Maybe this was the only way clint knew how to say goodbye to the man with no name. Its like the stranger is more of a ghost of the man with no name. Very good eastwood western. If you like clints westerns then get this one for sure.I got the bluray version. It has no special features just the movie in high def. I feel that all eastwood westerns are better on dvd because its slightly more gritty lending to the feel of his drama. All eastwood fans know that his westrns are very gritty and rough. So high def might no be the best viewing. But with that said. This film shines in high def with its vibrant colors. The sound is good not great. Some moments the music washes out the acting. I think that was the intent. Kinda like in for a few dollars more.

52755,A72A8JDQK4D8S,0783225725,John A. Lind,"[1, 1]","Very glad I waited for this to come out in Blu-ray and wondering why it's taken so long compared to other Eastwood films in his &#34;Man With No Name&#34; sub-genre. Eastwood's 2nd directorial effort (shortly after Play Misty for Me), it's not quite as good in plot (storyline) as &#34;Outlaw Josie Wales&#34; or &#34;Pale Rider&#34; which came years later, but only by a little as it's still a good tale. The cinematography and his directing are quite strong. There's plenty of action and enough depth to the story to keep interest. It has the typical gunslinger stranger arrives to town in extremis (or about to be) from a gang of ruthless ruffians. However, this one has a significant twist that the town's &#34;elders&#34; have brought the situation upon themselves (any more about this would be a major spoiler). Everyone pretty much gets their just deserves by the end; there is Karma.This film was a sufficient enough break from the traditional &#34;Western&#34; (as epitomized by John Ford's films) that it prompted John Wayne to write Eastwood a letter telling him this film did NOT represent the 19th Century American West, its values or its traditions. Perhaps Wayne had dismissed the Sergio Leone &#34;Dollars Trilogy&#34; that preceded this, and their popularity, as aberrant foreign Italian-Spanish imports (it had been some number of years)? What about Sam Peckinpah's &#34;The Wild Bunch&#34; released four years earlier? Perhaps it wasn't &#34;Western&#34; enough. In any event, Eastwood's &#34;High Plains Drifter&#34; is one of the films that continued to break down the 1930's-60's traditional Western genre, redefining it with Bad Men that aren't totally Bad, and Good Guys that had their own significant flaws.

This movie should be seen by all fans of westerns and the twilight zone.This is Eastwoods best work in my opinion.  And the stranger is as removed from ""The man with no name"" as he is from ""Josey Wales"".  People lump this movie in with the trilogy sometimes, but there are great differences between them.  The Stranger is never in trouble, never in a position of weakness.  He came to destory the town and deal out vengence on the people.  This has more in common with ""Needful Things"" than anything.

High Plains Drifter is an excellent tale that highlights Eastwood's talents in this genre, whether it's his ""Stranger"" type aura or the clipped but poignant lines.  This great western has a superb script and exceptional performances by Eastwood and the other actors.  Its surreal style, unexpected plot twists and great camera angles serve well to enhance this movies overall appearance.  I do not normally comment on the soundtrack for films however, in this case I feel compelled to because I felt the soundtrack for this one is a perfect accoutrement to the overall feel of the movie!The premise:A lone stranger rides into town and is immediately set upon by some of the locals.  Unfortunately for these rough locals, they've picked the star of the movie in Clint Eastwood to aggravate and they receive his quick six shooter justice for their efforts.  The locals, being a cowardly bunch, eagerly set out to appease him in every way in order to secure his loyalty and protection from a group of criminals who are soon to be released from the territorial prison.The ""Stranger"" agrees to be their benefactor and immediately sets out to do so in some strange ways.  Through humiliation, misogyny and the threat of immediate ""justice,"" he begins to prepare the town for return of the criminals.  As a surreal side note, the Stranger and some of the locals are having waking nightmares about the brutal killing of the former marshal by the criminals who are expected to return.  What follows is a western that is one of the best and a benchmark for all westerns to follow.I highly recommend this great Eastwood western to any and all die hard or casual fans of the genre or the actor.  It is a classic western that deserves a spot on the DVD rack.Special features:Not unlike many of the other movies of the time, this one isn't jam packed with special features because there just aren't many to throw in.

Eastwood made three Westerns in the Seventies(&#34;Joe Kidd&#34;, &#34;The Outlaw Josey Wales&#34;) and &#34;High Plains Drifter&#34; was his first Western as both star and director. Filmed at Mono Lake, the cinematography by Bruce Surtees looks stunning in this Blu-ray presentation from Universal with vibrant colors that are a wonder to behold. The restoration team at Universal deserves lots of credit for making this great Western look brand new. Not only can you see the dust of the town of Lago, but you can feel it too. Even the beads of sweat on the actor's faces stand out in the pristine close-ups that Eastwood films. Another improvement of the standard DVD release is the Audio. It's so clear that in the beginning of the film when Eastwood's mysterious  Stranger rides silently into town the only sound is the horse's hoofs hitting the dusty dirt road(A word of warning: the gunshots are loud so you may want to turn down the volume). The production design is another standout given a whole new life through this Blu ray presentation. You can really see the detail in both the interiors and exteriors. Costumes are more vivid too down to the smallest details. &#34;High Plains Drifter&#34; is 105 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 2.35.1) and contains the following subtitles: English SDH and Spanish.

52778,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,0783225725,Muzzlehatch,"[3, 4]","I've been a huge Clint Eastwood fan and have recently been revisiting some of the films that I hadn't seen for years, and there's no better place to start than with this, his second film and first western as director.The plot couldn't be simpler, in many ways harking back to A ""Fistful of Dollars"" in its elegant, stripped storyline: A stranger (Clint) rides into the town of Lago, quickly getting into a shootout that he didn't start and besting the three gunfighters that the town had hired to protect them. The townspeople are afraid of another trio who had once been on the payroll also, doing time in prison for a crime committed a year before that the town is complicit in, and due back to wreak vengeance. Seeing as how their protectors are dead, they agree to hire the stranger at any cost, and he proceeds to wreak havok on the town in more ways than one before proceeding on his way after filling his bargain in apocalyptic fashion.If the plot's simple, the characters, style and symbolism of the piece are a little less so. The Stranger it seems is haunted by dreams - memories or visions, who can say for sure? of a man who seems to be him, the town's former marshall, whipped to death by those same three men riding back for their own vengeance. ""Lago"" means ""lake"" and the town sits on an unnamed body of water; the town seems brand-new, most of the buildings are still under construction and unpainted, though from what we learn it's been around for over a year; the townspeople are greedy and cowardly, and The Stranger is cold, merciless, in the end even demonic. Is he a figure of vengeance, a revenant or demon sent from the real Hell that he names the town after, and that the marshall is seen in one flashback as damning it to, as he orders it painted completely red before the killers arrive in town?Though nearly everybody in the town is unpleasant, a couple of more positive images do stand out - Verna Bloom in one of the two significant female roles is the hotel-keeper's wife, who seems at first to despise The Stranger but seemingly just because he's another brutal [...] - when she realizes that he's the only man in the town with guts she softens, and he beds her just before the showdown. A dwarf, Mordecai (Billy Curtis), is also treated more softly, with The Stranger proclaiming him sherriff and mayor, pumping him up to the point where he alone of all the townsmen shows any guts at the eventual gun battle. I suppose it could be said that Clint's vengeful figure is capable of some charity and feeling towards the only two positive and ""good"" characters in the film. Significantly enough the other female character, a single woman (perhaps a whore? it's never very clear) named Callie (Marianna Hill) who he rapes shortly after entering town, develops an ambiguous love-hate attitude towards him and it's left quite ambiguous as to how much has to do with the rape (which both The Stranger and other townspeople deny) or because he then ignores her for the most part, even after she betrays him at one point.A town that seemed promising and new, fresh and full of vitality at the beginning of the film, perched on a cool lake and apparently prosperous, at the end has been half-burnt and decimated through a supernatural wrath, a vengeance for the greed and cowardice that killed a marshall and cowers before his redeemer - this is old-Testament filmmaking of a pure kind that Eastwood never really returned to in such an obvious way. There are certainly obvious odes to his spaghetti years, in the dirt and violence and unpleasantness of the townspeople and their souls, in Dee Barton's wonderfully eclectic, eerie score and of course in Eastwood's character; I also think it shares some kinship with the Don Siegel-directed Civil War film The Beguiled from 1971, another film with more than a touch of the supernatural, and few redeeming characters. But Clint makes it his own through the economy and his refusal to make things any more flashy or outr&eacute; than the screenplay calls for (which is plenty). The cast is terrific, mostly made up of names that were second-tier at best at the time and are largely forgotten now. Bloom and Curtis are especially goodPerhaps not one of the very best 70s westerns, and I'd certainly still put it behind ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" and ""Unforgiven"" in Eastwood's western-ography, but it's definitely one of the weirder and more fascinating examples of the genre from America during the period.",5,"A stranger rides into Lago, bringing a surrealistic vision of Hell...",1252886400,"09 14, 2009",2009,4474,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'huge', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'fan', 'have', 'recently', 'been', 'revisiting', 'films', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'years', 'better', 'place', 'start', 'second', 'film', 'first', 'western', 'director.The', 'plot', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'simpler', 'many', 'ways', 'harking', 'back', 'A', 'Fistful', 'Dollars', 'elegant', 'stripped', 'storyline', 'stranger', 'Clint', 'town', 'Lago', 'quickly', 'getting', 'shootout', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'besting', 'three', 'gunfighters', 'town', 'had', 'hired', 'protect', 'townspeople', 'are', 'afraid', 'trio', 'who', 'had', 'once', 'been', 'payroll', 'also', 'doing', 'time', 'prison', 'crime', 'committed', 'year', 'town', 'complicit', 'due', 'back', 'wreak', 'vengeance', 'Seeing', 'how', 'protectors', 'are', 'dead', 'agree', 'hire', 'stranger', 'cost', 'wreak', 'havok', 'town', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'proceeding', 'way', 'filling', 'bargain', 'apocalyptic', 'fashion.If', 'plot', 'simple', 'characters', 'style', 'symbolism', 'piece', 'are', 'little', 'less', 'so', 'Stranger', 'haunted', 'dreams', 'memories', 'visions', 'who', 'can', 'say', 'sure', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'town', 'former', 'marshall', 'whipped', 'death', 'same', 'three', 'men', 'riding', 'back', 'own', 'vengeance', 'Lago', 'lake', 'town', 'sits', 'unnamed', 'body', 'water', 'town', 'brand-new', 'most', 'buildings', 'are', 'still', 'construction', 'unpainted', 'what', 'learn', 'been', 'year', 'townspeople', 'are', 'greedy', 'cowardly', 'Stranger', 'cold', 'merciless', 'end', 'even', 'demonic', 'figure', 'vengeance', 'revenant', 'demon', 'sent', 'real', 'Hell', 'town', 'marshall', 'seen', 'one', 'flashback', 'damning', 'orders', 'painted', 'completely', 'red', 'killers', 'arrive', 'town', 'nearly', 'everybody', 'town', 'unpleasant', 'couple', 'more', 'positive', 'images', 'do', 'stand', 'out', 'Verna', 'Bloom', 'one', 'two', 'significant', 'female', 'roles', 'hotel-keeper', 'wife', 'who', 'first', 'despise', 'Stranger', 'seemingly', 'just', 'brutal', '[', ']', 'when', 'only', 'man', 'town', 'guts', 'just', 'showdown', 'dwarf', 'Mordecai', 'Billy', 'Curtis', 'also', 'treated', 'more', 'softly', 'Stranger', 'proclaiming', 'sherriff', 'mayor', 'pumping', 'point', 'where', 'alone', 'townsmen', 'guts', 'eventual', 'gun', 'battle', 'suppose', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Clint', 'vengeful', 'figure', 'capable', 'charity', 'feeling', 'towards', 'only', 'two', 'positive', 'good', 'characters', 'film', 'Significantly', 'enough', 'other', 'female', 'character', 'single', 'woman', 'perhaps', 'whore', 'never', 'very', 'clear', 'named', 'Callie', 'Marianna', 'Hill', 'who', 'shortly', 'entering', 'town', 'ambiguous', 'love-hate', 'attitude', 'towards', 'left', 'quite', 'ambiguous', 'how', 'much', 'do', 'rape', 'Stranger', 'other', 'townspeople', 'deny', 'then', 'most', 'part', 'even', 'one', 'point.A', 'town', 'seemed', 'promising', 'new', 'fresh', 'full', 'vitality', 'beginning', 'film', 'perched', 'cool', 'lake', 'apparently', 'prosperous', 'end', 'been', 'half-burnt', 'decimated', 'supernatural', 'wrath', 'vengeance', 'greed', 'cowardice', 'killed', 'marshall', 'cowers', 'redeemer', 'old-Testament', 'filmmaking', 'pure', 'kind', 'Eastwood', 'never', 'really', 'returned', 'such', 'obvious', 'way', 'are', 'certainly', 'obvious', 'odes', 'spaghetti', 'years', 'dirt', 'violence', 'unpleasantness', 'townspeople', 'souls', 'Dee', 'Barton', 'wonderfully', 'eclectic', 'eerie', 'score', 'course', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'also', 'think', 'shares', 'kinship', 'Don', 'Siegel-directed', 'Civil', 'War', 'film', 'Beguiled', '1971', 'film', 'more', 'touch', 'supernatural', 'few', 'redeeming', 'characters', 'Clint', 'own', 'economy', 'refusal', 'make', 'things', 'more', 'flashy', 'outr', 'eacute', 'screenplay', 'plenty', 'cast', 'terrific', 'mostly', 'made', 'names', 'were', 'second-tier', 'best', 'time', 'are', 'largely', 'forgotten', 'now', 'Bloom', 'Curtis', 'are', 'especially', 'goodPerhaps', 'not', 'one', 'very', 'best', '70s', 'westerns', ""'d"", 'certainly', 'still', 'put', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'Unforgiven', 'Eastwood', 'western-ography', 'definitely', 'one', 'weirder', 'more', 'fascinating', 'examples', 'genre', 'America', 'period']",N/A

This is the kind of film you want to drift through at 4:00 am on your TV set when you have nothing better to do.

Brutalized by a band of thugs, he returns to the town unrecognized to exact an obligation from the cowardly inhabitants who left him to be beaten and take revenge on his attackers. He obtains the help of a marginalized local dwarf (Billy Curtis) to rally the inhabitants and repaint the town red with the new name of ""Hell.""  ""Hell"" is what you will feel like as you plod through this boring film and its mundane plot.  The poor filming and simply atrocious acting by everyone involved will add to the feeling of infernal damnation.I am a big Clint Eastwood fan but this western is simply bad and unworthy of either rental or purchase.

52783,A1BM7TP9L9WDXR,0783225725,"Paul Ess. ""I almost care.""","[11, 12]","'High Plains Drifter' is my very favourite Eastwood movie (and that's saying something). I especially like the dark humour and ambiguity, but in truth, there's not much I don't like.You just know something bad is gonna happen the moment you see him appearing through the desert heat-haze in the eerie title sequence, and by the time the film ends with the same shot in reverse (a la 'the Searchers'), something bad has!In between, we're treated to much violence, sexism, adultery, hypocrisy and general wretchedness from the Lago townsfolk - and they're supposed to be the victims!These people are dire, far worse than the actual villains (who are gold-star nasty in a traditional sense); they stood and watched as their sheriff - the only honest character in the film - was whipped to death in the street.In essence, 'High Plains Drifter' is a cross between 'Witchfinder General,' 'High Noon' and 'the Omen' only with lashings more unpleasantness. The significant difference is that there's people to cheer for in those films - there's no-one here. Even the 'hero' appears a cruel, merciless killer, who is himself in no moral position to deliver salvation OR retribution to the cowering townsfolk.And who is he? The murdered sheriff's avenging kin? His ghost? The devil? The plot leads us up all the various avenues and alleyways but in the end it doesn't really matter. We're just glad that everyone who deserves retribution - gets it! The doing-good-via-bad clich&eacute; is hammered home, but again, we don't really care. We know right will out eventually, however perversely(and hopefully brutally!), because Eastwood's with the programme.Visually, the films superb. The town appears condensed, like a vacuum, especially when Eastwood demands it be painted red.It's not the traditional homely Western hamlet which deserves to be defended by brave men for whom it's worthwhile giving their lives. It's a bleak, soul-less outpost, desperate and afraid of it's own shadowy secrets and the fact they're returning to haunt it when it thought they were buried with the sheriff.Bruce Surtees camerawork effortlessly conveys this - and more (let's not give Eastwood ALL the credit). We get a very real sense of the artless, cuboid structures and the creepy inhabitants fully deserving each other.Performance-wise, Eastwood plays Eastwood (as he always does) with a twisted comic bravado (he knows he's distorting the western myth, by subverting the very iconography and legend that built it in the first place). He prowls the streets like Ann Coulter on the look-out for liberals; a cold glint as another low-life bites the dust.Geoffrey Lewis is grotesquely brilliant as the drunken, heartless, leering chief villain, and the rare Verna Bloom is handsome and sassy as the rebellious wife of one of Lago's slimy conspirators.There's blood by the bucket, roaring gun-fights, an inevitable,(but well-staged) all consuming fire, seriously nasty whippings and there's even a squalid, squeaky-voiced dwarf who, along with some 'pesky injun savages', are the only people to benefit from the 'drifter's' brief tenure.'High Plains Drifter' is a delirious amalgam of all that's small and sleazy in our sugar-veneered world. A cynical, yet not completely hopeless vision of mankind in general, which is as valid and relevant now as when Eastwood shot it.",5,"""Urghh, He Sure Had A Lot of Blood Left In Him, Didn't He?""",1217030400,"07 26, 2008",2008,3342,"[""'High"", 'Plains', 'Drifter', 'very', 'favourite', 'Eastwood', 'movie', 'saying', 'something', 'especially', 'dark', 'humour', 'ambiguity', 'truth', 'not', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'like.You', 'just', 'know', 'something', 'bad', 'gon', 'happen', 'moment', 'see', 'appearing', 'desert', 'heat-haze', 'eerie', 'title', 'sequence', 'time', 'film', 'same', 'shot', 'reverse', 'la', 'Searchers', 'something', 'bad', ""'re"", 'treated', 'much', 'violence', 'sexism', 'adultery', 'hypocrisy', 'general', 'wretchedness', 'Lago', 'townsfolk', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'victims', 'people', 'are', 'dire', 'far', 'worse', 'actual', 'villains', 'who', 'are', 'gold-star', 'nasty', 'traditional', 'sense', 'stood', 'watched', 'sheriff', 'only', 'honest', 'character', 'film', 'was', 'whipped', 'death', 'street.In', 'essence', 'Plains', 'Drifter', 'cross', ""'Witchfinder"", 'General', ""'High"", 'Noon', 'Omen', 'only', 'lashings', 'more', 'unpleasantness', 'significant', 'difference', 'people', 'cheer', 'films', 'no-one', 'here', 'Even', ""'hero"", 'cruel', 'merciless', 'killer', 'who', 'moral', 'position', 'deliver', 'salvation', 'OR', 'retribution', 'cowering', 'townsfolk.And', 'who', 'murdered', 'sheriff', 'avenging', 'kin', 'ghost', 'devil', 'plot', 'various', 'avenues', 'alleyways', 'end', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', ""'re"", 'just', 'glad', 'everyone', 'who', 'retribution', 'doing-good-via-bad', 'clich', 'eacute', 'hammered', 'home', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'know', 'right', 'will', 'out', 'eventually', 'however', 'perversely', 'hopefully', 'brutally', 'Eastwood', 'programme.Visually', 'films', 'superb', 'town', 'condensed', 'vacuum', 'especially', 'when', 'Eastwood', 'be', 'painted', 'red.It', 'not', 'traditional', 'homely', 'Western', 'hamlet', 'be', 'defended', 'brave', 'men', 'whom', 'worthwhile', 'giving', 'lives', 'bleak', 'soul-less', 'outpost', 'desperate', 'afraid', 'own', 'shadowy', 'secrets', 'fact', ""'re"", 'returning', 'haunt', 'when', 'thought', 'were', 'buried', 'sheriff.Bruce', 'Surtees', 'camerawork', 'effortlessly', 'more', 'let', 'not', 'give', 'Eastwood', 'ALL', 'credit', 'get', 'very', 'real', 'sense', 'artless', 'cuboid', 'structures', 'creepy', 'inhabitants', 'fully', 'deserving', 'other.Performance-wise', 'Eastwood', 'Eastwood', 'always', 'twisted', 'comic', 'bravado', 'distorting', 'western', 'myth', 'subverting', 'very', 'iconography', 'legend', 'built', 'first', 'place', 'streets', 'Ann', 'Coulter', 'look-out', 'liberals', 'cold', 'glint', 'low-life', 'dust.Geoffrey', 'Lewis', 'grotesquely', 'brilliant', 'drunken', 'heartless', 'leering', 'chief', 'villain', 'rare', 'Verna', 'Bloom', 'handsome', 'sassy', 'rebellious', 'wife', 'one', 'Lago', 'slimy', 'conspirators.There', 'blood', 'bucket', 'roaring', 'gun-fights', 'inevitable', 'well-staged', 'consuming', 'fire', 'seriously', 'nasty', 'whippings', 'even', 'squalid', 'squeaky-voiced', 'dwarf', 'who', ""'pesky"", 'injun', 'savages', 'are', 'only', 'people', 'benefit', ""'drifter"", 'brief', 'tenure', ""'High"", 'Plains', 'Drifter', 'delirious', 'amalgam', 'small', 'sleazy', 'sugar-veneered', 'world', 'cynical', 'yet', 'not', 'completely', 'hopeless', 'vision', 'mankind', 'general', 'valid', 'relevant', 'now', 'when', 'Eastwood', 'shot']",N/A
52784,A3UA40JOD3BE1M,0783225725,"Paul Fogarty ""Hopeless film addict!""","[8, 9]","""High Plains Drifter"" was only Clint Eastwood's second directorial effort, but already we can see that a master is at work, and if that wasn't enough, he also stared in, and produced the film, through his own ""Malpaso"" company. The film is very straightforward, at least on the surface. The small, isolated coastal town of Lago doesn't much take to strangers, rather like the desert town in Spencer Tracy's ""Bad Day At Black Rock,"" and for a similar reason; Lago hides dark and dismal secrets that have damned it's residents to a living Hell. Then one day, from out of the desert's shimmering heat-haze, rides ""The Stranger,"" and as it says on the jacket, ""They'll never forget the day he drifted into town.""The Stranger, nameless and taciturn, is an obvious twist on the ""Man With No Name,"" but taken here to it's logical extreme; Eastwood has given us, in the character of The Stranger, a figure that is undoubtedly one of the most brutally amoral anti-heroes in film history. With a running time of only 84 minutes, Eastwood doesn't waste a minute of that screen-time in getting the story into high gear. Starting with an eerily atmospheric, deceptively calm, opening sequence, The Stranger arrives in Lago. Within minutes he has gunned down 3 thugs who baited and goaded him, thinking they had an easy mark, and in the films most controversial scene, `rapes' a woman he meets in the street!I said that ""High Plains Drifter"" was a straightforward film, at least on the surface, but to truly understand the actions of The Stranger you have to look beyond the obvious. ""High Plains Drifter"" plays as a revenger, but it's more than that, it's a psychological western, and one, I think, that stands alongside Brando's ""One Eyed Jacks;"" The Stranger is as a mirror to the rotten and corrupted soul of Lago.The town is fearfully awaiting the arrival of three ghosts from its past, convicted killers who were set up and imprisoned on trumped-up charges; soon to be released, their first order of business will be to head back to Lago and extract their pound of flesh from each and every one of the people who betrayed them. And that brings us full-circle, the thugs The Stranger gunned down were hired by the town to protect them from the returning killers!Most of the townspeople, but especially the mayor and his cronies, are hypocrites and gutless cowards, both morally and physically; unable to live with their past actions, they use weasel words and spurious justifications to salve their collective conscience, and in doing so, Lago itself becomes their prison. After witnessing the speed and accuracy of The Stranger, they beg him to stay and protect them. At first he's not interested, `til they offer him ""anything,"" an ""open check,"" for his services... he takes them at their word. 3 pairs of hand-tooled boots, a gun belt, a silver-tooled saddle, unlimited gut-rot, beer, and cigars later, The Stranger tells them he won't do their dirty work for them, but he'll teach them how to do it for themselves.I said that you have to look beyond the obvious to understand the actions of The Stranger. While in the store he gives two jars of candy and a stack of blankets to an old Indian and his grandchildren, not out of any act of kindness towards them, but because he knows it'll upset the racist store owner. Similarly he watches as the boot-maker delightedly calculates his check for the boots etc, only to smile as the man is told it's all free of charge, the bar owner is overjoyed as The Stranger buys him a cigar and orders a round for everyone, only to be crushed by the same news. He then humiliates the mayor and sheriff in front of the whole town by giving their positions to the town joke, a midget named Mordecai. And that brings us to the `rape' scene that has upset so many people. As I said, The Stranger is a mirror to the towns rotten soul; it's blatantly obvious that the woman wants this powerful and masculine man, but on HER terms, well, she gets what she wants, but on HIS terms. In fact the only character that manages to surprise The Stranger is the Preacher, who shows, in one cynically comical scene, that he's quite capable of serving God and mammon both! An ambush of the killers is planned, and as a final act of degradation, The Stranger has the residents paint the whole town red, renames it ""Hell,"" and sets up a ""Welcome Home Boys"" street party for the returning killers... needless to say, they return to one HELL of a party!""High Plains Drifter"" is a wonderful film that works on many different levels; watch it for the fun in seeing The Stranger blowing away the bad guys and humiliating the craven townspeople, or delve deep inside the character of The Stranger and see just how far ""revenge"" can be taken...

The camera pans with the horseman to reveal a small town by a lake-lagoon... The horseman rides in, the camera tracking behind him, interrupted with faces of suspicious locals - even a coffin maker with his merchandises - and instantly one is reminded of Sergio Leone and his faithful reproduction of Kurosawa... A coach driver cracks the whip... The horseman turns, and moves back... He enters a bar and asks for 'a beer and a bottle.' A town heavy intervenes: 'Flea-bitten range-bums don't usually stop in Lago. Life here is a little too quick for them. Maybe you think you're fast enough to keep up with us!' The drifter replies: 'I'm faster than you'll ever live to be!'True to his promise, the Stranger kills the 'trouble shooter' and his two friends, and also rapes the town belle who responds as any Eastwood feminine victim is obliged to, with resistance turning strangely to joy... The town midget, Mordecai (Billy Curtis) offers him a cigar inquiring: 'What did you say your name was again?' The hardened Stranger replies: 'I didn't!'The Man With No Name has returned, this time, quite literally, with a vengeance... His dictatorship is flavored with cool humor... The name Billy Borders is mentioned to him...'Don't know the man,' he confesses.'You didn't have much time to,' comes the reply, 'because you shot him yesterday.'When his rape victim, Callie Travers (Mariana Hill) inaccurately empties a pistol at him during his bath, he casually resurfaces, cigar still in his mouth, and in an aside to his sidekick, Mordecai, reflects: 'I wonder what took her so long to get mad?' His fellow chauvinist suggests, 'Maybe because you didn't come back for more.'The townsfolk accedes to the Stranger's requests, who pushes them to the limit, even forcing them to paint the entire town blood red... 'When we get down,' says one of them, 'this place is going to look like hell.'This is the Stranger's intention; he takes a brush and strokes out the name 'Logo' on the town sign and writes 'Hell' instead.In a series of flashbacks, primarily from the Stranger's point of view and later from Mordecai's, it is revealed that the townsfolk stood by and let three men whip their Marshal to death... The Marshal had discovered that the basis of the town's prosperity, a mine, was actually on government land and not on the townspeople's own. He was going to report this, so no-one felt obliged to intervene when he met his vicious end... His body now was lying outside the town in an unmarked grave: 'They say the dead don't rest without a marker of some kind... he's the reason this town's afraid of strangers.'Now they have reason to be afraid of the three men who paid the price for the crime in which they all agreed... The Stranger analyzes this fear: 'It's what people know about themselves inside that makes them afraid.' The town reaction to his is reserved... A group of vigilantes try to kill him... The Stranger repays them with a stick of dynamite... Despite their training, the remaining locals are horrified when they realize that he does not intend to remain for the final showdown...""High Plains Drifter"" is one of the most important Westerns ever made, and when Eastwood takes his rightful place in film history alongside Cooper and Stewart and Wayne, this is the film that will be seen as the quintessential example of his art...",3,The Man With No Name has returns as an avenging angel of death!,1162857600,"11 7, 2006",2006,3740,"['exotic', 'location', 'desert', 'Lake', 'Mono', 'California', 'Sierras', 'certainly', 'film', 'fresh', 'refined', 'look', 'Westerns', 'sparkling', 'colors', 'backgrounds', 'changing', 'cloud', 'formations', 'gave', 'effective', 'shots', 'film', 'certainly', 'most', 'dramatic', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Western', 'burning', 'desert', 'Bruce', 'Surtees', 'discovers', 'lone', 'horseman', 'camera', 'horseman', 'reveal', 'small', 'town', 'lake-lagoon', 'horseman', 'camera', 'tracking', 'interrupted', 'suspicious', 'locals', 'even', 'coffin', 'maker', 'merchandises', 'instantly', 'one', 'reminded', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'faithful', 'reproduction', 'Kurosawa', 'A', 'coach', 'driver', 'whip', 'horseman', 'back', 'bar', 'beer', 'bottle', 'town', 'heavy', 'intervenes', ""'Flea-bitten"", 'range-bums', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'stop', 'Lago', 'Life', 'here', 'little', 'too', 'quick', 'Maybe', 'think', ""'re"", 'fast', 'enough', 'keep', 'up', 'drifter', 'replies', ""'m"", 'faster', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'live', 'be', 'promise', 'Stranger', ""'trouble"", 'shooter', 'two', 'friends', 'also', 'town', 'belle', 'who', 'Eastwood', 'feminine', 'victim', 'obliged', 'resistance', 'turning', 'strangely', 'joy', 'town', 'midget', 'Mordecai', 'Billy', 'Curtis', 'cigar', 'inquiring', ""'What"", 'did', 'say', 'name', 'was', 'again', 'hardened', 'Stranger', 'replies', 'did', ""n't"", ""'The"", 'Man', 'No', 'Name', 'returned', 'time', 'quite', 'literally', 'vengeance', 'dictatorship', 'flavored', 'cool', 'humor', 'name', 'Billy', 'Borders', 'mentioned', ""'Do"", ""n't"", 'know', 'man', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'time', 'reply', 'shot', 'yesterday', ""'When"", 'rape', 'victim', 'Callie', 'Travers', 'Mariana', 'Hill', 'inaccurately', 'pistol', 'bath', 'casually', 'cigar', 'still', 'mouth', 'aside', 'sidekick', 'Mordecai', 'wonder', 'what', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'get', 'mad', 'fellow', 'chauvinist', ""'Maybe"", 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'more', 'townsfolk', 'accedes', 'Stranger', 'requests', 'who', 'limit', 'even', 'forcing', 'paint', 'entire', 'town', 'blood', 'red', ""'When"", 'get', 'down', 'one', 'place', 'going', 'look', 'hell', 'Stranger', 'intention', 'brush', 'out', 'name', ""'Logo"", 'town', 'sign', ""'Hell"", 'instead.In', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'primarily', 'Stranger', 'point', 'view', 'later', 'Mordecai', 'revealed', 'townsfolk', 'stood', 'let', 'three', 'men', 'whip', 'Marshal', 'death', 'Marshal', 'had', 'discovered', 'basis', 'town', 'prosperity', 'mine', 'was', 'actually', 'government', 'land', 'not', 'townspeople', 'own', 'was', 'going', 'report', 'so', 'no-one', 'felt', 'obliged', 'intervene', 'when', 'met', 'vicious', 'end', 'body', 'now', 'was', 'lying', 'town', 'unmarked', 'grave', ""'They"", 'say', 'dead', 'do', ""n't"", 'rest', 'marker', 'kind', 'reason', 'town', 'afraid', 'strangers', 'have', 'reason', 'be', 'afraid', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'paid', 'price', 'crime', 'agreed', 'Stranger', 'fear', ""'It"", 'what', 'people', 'know', 'inside', 'afraid', 'town', 'reaction', 'reserved', 'group', 'vigilantes', 'try', 'kill', 'Stranger', 'stick', 'dynamite', 'training', 'remaining', 'locals', 'are', 'horrified', 'when', 'realize', 'not', 'intend', 'remain', 'final', 'showdown', 'High', 'Plains', 'Drifter', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'Westerns', 'ever', 'made', 'when', 'Eastwood', 'rightful', 'place', 'film', 'history', 'Cooper', 'Stewart', 'Wayne', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'quintessential', 'example', 'art']",N/A

The subject of the film was later reprized in ""Pale Rider"", which is good in its own right, but ""pales"" beside the mythic resonance of ""Drifter"".Clearly, Eastwood is using everything he learned at the feet of the master Sergio Leone, but goes the master one better. ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" had a strong anti-war message on a grand scale. ""Drifter"" is a more interior kind of study of group corruption, and the place of the a-moral avanger within the panoply of human foibles.I'm surprised that no reviewer has taken up the Christological overtones of the film. The Sheriff of Lago is whipped to death in the street in front of all of the townspeople - just like Jesus on the stations of the cross. ""The Stranger"", as the returning (resurrected?) ghost of the Sheriff (who is only reckognized as such by the town dwarf), is also handy with a whip, as was Jesus when he ""cleansed"" the Temple of the corruption of the money-lenders (which is the exact hidden sin of the town).""Lago"" is obviously an anagram for ""Gaol"": the citizens are locked in a purgatory waiting room, and The Stranger has come to dispense judgment.The role of the dwarf, whom The Stranger appoints first as Mayor and then as Sheriff of the town, simply to grind the faces of the towspeople in their own corruption, is a brilliant bit of Sergio Leone parody put on steroids!The entire movie is paced excellently and has a very satisfying balance. Geoffry Lewis as the head of the bad guys later became a staple player in Eastwood's Malpaso productions, including an excellent turn in ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot"".All in all, this is a quintessential Eastwood film, and is probably the capstone of the Sergio Leone style Western.

When it was released it was blasted by many critics for its violence since then its critical reputation has risen.Eastwood plays a stranger who arrives in an odd town called Lago. The residents are wary of any stranger and the gunslingers hired to protect the mining operation (among other things)immediately want to take him down a peg or two. They have no idea who they're dealing with. There's a dark secret involving murder eating at the heart of Lago and its residents. Its corrupting effects are hidden by pleasant facades of the buildings.The residents want to hire The Stranger who defend them against outlaws who have a grudge against the towns people. He's initially reluctant but agrees after given carte blanc to the town. He does lives up to his end of the bargain but not before exacting a brutal revenge.The film certainly merits five stars. It's an assured second film from Eastwood as a director. The script by Ernest Tidyman (with uncredited rewrites by Dean Reisner)marvelously captures many of the elements that made Sergio Leone's westerns so popular and manages to invert many of them at the same time. Reportedly inspired by a subgenre of samurai films revenge films, Eastwood chose to make the film when the treatment intrigued him. Tidyman's (The French Connection)screenplay is lean and compact providing a perfect frame work that echoes and compliments the films that Eastwood made for Leone. The haunting musical score also echoes Morricone's scores for Leone's films without imitating them.Universal has given this classic western shoddy treatment. The cover you see here isn't the cover on the current version. It's a much less dramatic photographic image. Additionally, it's clear that this is just a re-release of the original 1997 bare bones DVD. The film has not been remastered and there's loads of analog artifacts as well as some interlacing problems in a couple of scenes. The film deserves to be restruck from the original negative and remastered with 5.1 Dolby Digital sound. It also deserves a commentary track from star/director Eastman as well as a documentary on this magnificent film. There is a promotional film floating around that was made at the time of the film and the least Universal could have done with this reissue was put it on disc. That, along with a retrospective documentary and interviews is really what this terrific film deserves. Sadly, Universal has chosen to release it with little fan fare at a budget price but without any of the extras that would make it worthwhile. There is the original trailer (in pan and scan format) and production notes.One other minor flaw is that the transfer is cropped incorrectly in this widescreen presentation. As a result, some of the credits appear at the very edge of the screen. While this isn't a major issue, the film isn't presented in quite the way it should be.Eastwood deserves kudos for this fine western which was a pivotal film in his career as both director and star. Universal deserves a round of boos and hisses for the shoddy presentation of this reissue. Hopefully, this film, like Unforgiven, will receive the deluxe presentation it deserves.",5,Supernatural western 5 stars for content 2 for quality,1070496000,"12 4, 2003",2003,3304,"['odd', 'supernatural', 'western', 'number', 'twists', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'High', 'Plains', 'Drifter', 'now', 'recognized', 'pivotal', 'important', 'western', 'When', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'blasted', 'many', 'critics', 'violence', 'then', 'critical', 'reputation', 'risen.Eastwood', 'plays', 'stranger', 'who', 'odd', 'town', 'called', 'Lago', 'residents', 'are', 'wary', 'stranger', 'gunslingers', 'hired', 'protect', 'mining', 'operation', 'other', 'things', 'immediately', 'want', 'take', 'down', 'peg', 'two', 'have', 'idea', 'who', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'dark', 'secret', 'involving', 'murder', 'eating', 'heart', 'Lago', 'residents', 'corrupting', 'effects', 'are', 'hidden', 'pleasant', 'facades', 'buildings.The', 'residents', 'want', 'hire', 'Stranger', 'who', 'defend', 'outlaws', 'who', 'have', 'grudge', 'towns', 'people', 'initially', 'reluctant', 'given', 'carte', 'blanc', 'town', 'up', 'end', 'bargain', 'not', 'exacting', 'brutal', 'revenge.The', 'film', 'certainly', 'five', 'stars', 'assured', 'second', 'film', 'Eastwood', 'director', 'script', 'Ernest', 'Tidyman', 'uncredited', 'rewrites', 'Dean', 'Reisner', 'marvelously', 'many', 'elements', 'made', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'westerns', 'so', 'popular', 'manages', 'invert', 'many', 'same', 'time', 'Reportedly', 'inspired', 'subgenre', 'samurai', 'films', 'revenge', 'films', 'Eastwood', 'chose', 'make', 'film', 'when', 'treatment', 'intrigued', 'Tidyman', 'French', 'Connection', 'screenplay', 'lean', 'compact', 'providing', 'perfect', 'frame', 'work', 'films', 'Eastwood', 'made', 'Leone', 'haunting', 'musical', 'score', 'also', 'Morricone', 'scores', 'Leone', 'films', 'imitating', 'them.Universal', 'given', 'classic', 'western', 'shoddy', 'treatment', 'cover', 'see', 'here', ""n't"", 'cover', 'current', 'version', 'much', 'less', 'dramatic', 'photographic', 'image', 'Additionally', 'clear', 'just', 're-release', 'original', '1997', 'bare', 'bones', 'DVD', 'film', 'not', 'been', 'remastered', 'loads', 'analog', 'artifacts', 'as', 'well', 'interlacing', 'problems', 'couple', 'scenes', 'film', 'be', 'restruck', 'original', 'negative', 'remastered', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'sound', 'also', 'commentary', 'track', 'star/director', 'Eastman', 'as', 'well', 'documentary', 'magnificent', 'film', 'promotional', 'film', 'floating', 'was', 'made', 'time', 'film', 'least', 'Universal', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'reissue', 'was', 'put', 'disc', 'retrospective', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'really', 'what', 'terrific', 'film', 'deserves', 'Sadly', 'Universal', 'chosen', 'release', 'little', 'fan', 'fare', 'budget', 'price', 'extras', 'would', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'original', 'trailer', 'pan', 'scan', 'format', 'production', 'notes.One', 'other', 'minor', 'flaw', 'transfer', 'cropped', 'incorrectly', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'result', 'credits', 'appear', 'very', 'edge', 'screen', ""n't"", 'major', 'issue', 'film', ""n't"", 'presented', 'quite', 'way', 'should', 'be.Eastwood', 'deserves', 'kudos', 'fine', 'western', 'was', 'pivotal', 'film', 'career', 'director', 'star', 'Universal', 'round', 'boos', 'hisses', 'shoddy', 'presentation', 'reissue', 'Hopefully', 'film', 'Unforgiven', 'will', 'receive', 'deluxe', 'presentation']",N/A

First, there is no one better at playing mean than Clint Eastwood. The level of mean here almost equals his output in Dirty Harry. Second, there's a midget in this movie, and it isn't some ten second cameo either. This midget, who knows how to act, plays a major role throughout the movie. As far as midget performances go, this guy ranks right up there with the Wizard of Oz and anything Joe Pesci has done. Finally, the supernatural feel of the movie is accentuated by an unnerving soundtrack and irregular camera angles.If you're hungry for DVD extras, this release will leave your stomach growling.
