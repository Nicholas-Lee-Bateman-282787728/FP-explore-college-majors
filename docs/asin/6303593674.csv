Unfortunately, it's another case of less than pristine elements being used to make a video transfer.  As previous reviewers have noted, the widescreen print that's been transfered to video is quite poor, with dull contrast, heavy scratches, and extremely difficult to read subtitles.  Amazingly, there is a better transfer available, a fine contrast print with deep grey tones and few scratches, and -get this- new, yellow subtitles!  Unfortunately, it's a pan-and-scan version where you end up losing nearly half of the available image, but at least you can read the subtitles with ease.  This version has turned up on cable tv over the last few years, but was never on video, as far as I can tell.  Why a letterboxed video version hasn't been put together with the same or similar elements, I don't know.  Until that happens though, we'll have to make do with what we have.  It's a shame this is the case, because &quot;Sundays and Cybele&quot; deserves better.",4,"Lovely film, lousy print",1005955200,"11 17, 2001",2001,1099,"['quot', 'Sundays', 'Cybele', 'quot', 'beautiful', 'film', 'sensitively', 'handling', 'delicate', 'subject', 'adult', 'male', 'love', 'young', 'girl', 'Unfortunately', 'case', 'less', 'pristine', 'elements', 'being', 'used', 'make', 'video', 'transfer', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'widescreen', 'print', 'been', 'transfered', 'video', 'quite', 'poor', 'dull', 'contrast', 'heavy', 'scratches', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'read', 'subtitles', 'Amazingly', 'better', 'transfer', 'available', 'fine', 'contrast', 'print', 'deep', 'grey', 'tones', 'few', 'scratches', '-get', 'this-', 'new', 'yellow', 'subtitles', 'Unfortunately', 'pan-and-scan', 'version', 'where', 'end', 'up', 'losing', 'nearly', 'half', 'available', 'image', 'least', 'can', 'read', 'subtitles', 'ease', 'version', 'turned', 'up', 'cable', 'tv', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'was', 'never', 'video', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'Why', 'letterboxed', 'video', 'version', ""n't"", 'been', 'put', 'together', 'same', 'similar', 'elements', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ll"", 'have', 'make', 'do', 'what', 'have', 'shame', 'case', 'quot', 'Sundays', 'Cybele', 'quot', 'better']",Sundays and Cybele VHS

381196,A15DZ1M217MUOK,6303593674,Joe Vee,"[3, 3]","Every so often a film comes along that grabs hold of one's emotions and won't let go. &#34;Sundays and C y b e l e&#34; is this kind of film, initially released in 1962, garnering an Academy Award for Best Freign Film the following year. And for good reason: it is an absorbing, engrossing story about the innocence of childhood pitted against the suspicions and relative cynicism of the adult world that witnesses it and ultimately passes judgment on it, leading to its haunting, tragic finale. What I've always liked about this exceptional film is how this very emotional story unfolds, along with the cutting edge camerawork of the day. The plot unfolds beautifully and with sensitivity. Two damaged souls meet and forge a primal connection to each other, one a lost soul of an amnesiac and the other a young child abandoned by her father at a convent school in France. Unforgettable this film certainly is.

381197,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6303593674,Randy Keehn,"[4, 4]","Somewhere along the way, I had gotten the impression that ""Sundays and Cybele"" was one of those great ""feel good"" movies.  The two or three different stills I had seen over the years showed me two people lovingly enjoying being with each other.  I knew from those same pictures that the movie focussed on a man and a young girl.  As the film began, I soon became aware that the two main characters had each been damaged through different means.  The relationship that grew between them was indeed, quite impressive and certainly worthy of this movie.  My challenge was to appreciate the impressive way that we were made to know the extent of the man's disability.  It became difficult to watch the man in his inability to comprehend and cope with his limitations.  However, I realized that the relationship that was portrayed in ""Sundays and Cybele"" was able to transcend the standard movie fare because of the man's severe dysfunction.The VHS copy of this movie was rather dark which probably helped to enhance the film's impact.  There was enough light to obscure a number of the English subtitles.  I may have missed an important piece of dialogue here and there because I was unclear about the ending of the movie.  It may have been clear to others but my impression was that there were two possible explanations to the outcome of the movie; one innocent, one brutal.  I believe that the movie was as coarse as it was to keep us uncertain of the ending.  Many may likely chose the one that is more comforting while secretly worrying that it may actually have been the opposite.  I guess waiting for a happy ending almost made me miss a better movie.",4,Very Good but not quite what I Expected,1204502400,"03 3, 2008",2008,1653,"['Somewhere', 'way', 'had', 'gotten', 'impression', 'Sundays', 'Cybele', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'feel', 'good', 'movies', 'two', 'three', 'different', 'stills', 'had', 'seen', 'years', 'showed', 'two', 'people', 'lovingly', 'enjoying', 'being', 'other', 'knew', 'same', 'pictures', 'movie', 'focussed', 'man', 'young', 'girl', 'film', 'began', 'soon', 'became', 'aware', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'had', 'been', 'damaged', 'different', 'means', 'relationship', 'grew', 'was', 'indeed', 'quite', 'impressive', 'certainly', 'worthy', 'movie', 'challenge', 'was', 'appreciate', 'impressive', 'way', 'were', 'made', 'know', 'extent', 'man', 'disability', 'became', 'difficult', 'watch', 'man', 'inability', 'comprehend', 'cope', 'limitations', 'However', 'realized', 'relationship', 'was', 'portrayed', 'Sundays', 'Cybele', 'was', 'able', 'transcend', 'standard', 'movie', 'fare', 'man', 'severe', 'dysfunction.The', 'VHS', 'copy', 'movie', 'was', 'rather', 'dark', 'probably', 'helped', 'enhance', 'film', 'impact', 'was', 'enough', 'light', 'obscure', 'number', 'English', 'subtitles', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'important', 'piece', 'dialogue', 'here', 'there', 'was', 'unclear', 'ending', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'clear', 'others', 'impression', 'was', 'were', 'two', 'possible', 'explanations', 'outcome', 'movie', 'one', 'innocent', 'one', 'brutal', 'believe', 'movie', 'was', 'as', 'coarse', 'was', 'keep', 'uncertain', 'ending', 'Many', 'may', 'likely', 'chose', 'one', 'more', 'comforting', 'secretly', 'worrying', 'may', 'actually', 'have', 'been', 'opposite', 'guess', 'waiting', 'happy', 'ending', 'almost', 'made', 'miss', 'better', 'movie']",Sundays and Cybele VHS
381198,A2AJMMNO4S3IK,6303593674,"Tintin ""tintin75""","[14, 14]","This splendid film has to be the best-kept secret of the last half century in the film industry.  After winning an Oscar in 1963 for the Best Foreign Language Film and two more Oscar nominations the following year (Best Music and Best Screenplay), and a win in the same category of the Blue Ribbon Awards in 1964, it practically sunk into oblivion, especially in its country of origin, France, illustrating once more that no man is a prophet in his own land.  Soon after, Columbia Pictures, which owns the rights for this film, refused to release it because of its controversial subject.  Fortunately, Columbia has now relented and recently authorized its release on DVD, in Italy, Germany, and England.The film's subject was risqu&eacute; fifty years ago, and it remains so even now, and maybe even more so.  How can one make us believe in the delicate charm of this wondrous love story between a shell-shocked, amnesiac, thirty-something man and a lonely twelve-year-old child without promoting or raising the specter of pedophilia? In reading this film's synopsis, one immediately thinks of ""Lolita,"" except for the fact that in ""Sundays and Cybele"" the adult man is not the sexually obsessed Humbert Humbert and the young girl is not the treacherous nymphet, Dolores Haze. Under Director Serge Bourguignon, ""Sundays and Cybele"" becomes an authentic masterpiece, deeply moving, a film touched by grace and poetry, which is made even more miraculous by its controversial subject.The story is that of Pierre (Hardy Kr&uuml;ger), a pilot who, while crash-landing his plane during a mission in Vietnam (during the Franco-Vietnamese War) had perhaps killed a young girl. He now lives in Ville d'Avray with Madeleine (Nicole Courcel), the nurse who restored him to physical health. Although amnesiac, he is traumatized by a sense of culpability that he cannot comprehend. Pierre spends his days waiting for the recovery of his memory, and for getting over his acrophobia.At the local train station, he by chance meets a twelve-year-old girl, Franoise/Cyb&egrave;le (Patricia Gozzi). The girl is accompanied by her father who is planning to abandon her to the care of a Catholic boarding school in town (the girl's mother previously ran away with a magician).  Pierre is shattered by the young girl's tears and he desperately attempts to see her again at the boarding school.  Eventually, he successfully presents himself to the sisters as the girl's father and he is thus allowed to take her out on Sundays.  Between these two damaged characters, a deep history of friendship is born...and so is an intense love story of incredible purity, a love that the cynical and practical adult world cannot understand and will eventually condemn.On these blessed days, Pierre and Cyb&egrave;le (her real name) walk in the town's forest and around its magical ponds, losing themselves in nature vaulted cathedral of trees which surround them.  They live outside society, in their own world which they enter through their magic ritual, which consists in throwing a stone in one of the ponds, producing surface waves which open the door of their secret universe.""Les Dimanches de Ville d'Avray,"" as the film is known in France, is based on the eponymous novel by Bernard Echass&eacute;riaux.  This was Serge Bourguignon's feature film debut (and what a debut!) and it became his magnum opus.  The scenario is by Serge Bourguignon and Antoine Tudal, and so are the dialogues by Bourguignon, in collaboration with Echass&eacute;riaux.  Besides the grace of the cinematic conceit and the dialogue, Bourguignon's mise-en-scene is praiseworthy from beginning to end: instead of physically and literally recreating an imaginary world, he suggests its reality through its magic.  For example, there is a traveling framing of Pierre's and Cyb&egrave;le's reflections in the water rather than on them directly, as well as the many contemplative shots of nature during which the dialogue is superimposed.  The camera behaves as another character, a silent witness intimidated by their love, who does not dare to look them directly in the eyes, lest their innocence be corrupted. With these simple effects, Bourguignon renders the beauty and purity of their union - and also its fragility. The film puts great emphasis on intimate, silent scenes, such as the walks along the pounds and in the forest, in the cold and the mist of the winter Sundays, or between Pierre and Madeleine in their home.  Although this film was made during the birth of the Nouvelle Vague, Bourguignon's film is closer to the poetic realism of Carn&eacute;, Renoir, and in particular the tone in Ren&eacute; Cl&eacute;ment's Forbidden Games (1952).The relatively small cast is brilliant, starting with Patricia Gozzi's extraordinary portrayal of Cyb&egrave;le as an extremely feminine, intelligent, and enchanting little girl.  She plays this character with astounding insight, evoking the apparent understanding of a mature woman.  Her attachment to Pierre is a mixture of her budding sexual stirrings and of the impulses to reach for the male affection she has never known in a loveless, broken home.  Gozzi is without a doubt the finest child actress I have ever seen. This remarkable actress acted in only seven films over the course of eleven years, from 1960 to 1970, after which she unfortunately left the cinema.  Hardy Kr&uuml;ger fulfils his difficult role of Pierre with panache, as a misfit on the margins of society. He portrays a man whose life has been shattered, and who is desperately trying to find a way out of his amnesia and vertigo, to start anew.  Early in their friendship, Pierre says to Cyb&egrave;le, ""You will be my healer."" And in the process of his healing, Pierre becomes as much of a father to Cyb&egrave;le as he is her big brother, her boyfriend, and even her son.Nicole Courcel has had a long and successful career in films, theater, and television. In this film, she underscores her well-deserved reputation in the role of a loving and understanding mistress who has brought Pierre to physical health and is patiently trying to restore his mental health through her unconditional love. Daniel Ivernel is also excellent in his role as Pierre's best (and only) friend and confident, a man who has tried to understand and accepted his friend's relationship with the young girl.The setting is Ville d'Avray, a small community near Paris which at the time of the filming had still retained its rustic setting, its forest with its hunting roads and famous pounds which so inspired the painter Jean Batiste Corot. The sublime photography in black and white is by Henri Deca, who has 84 films on his r&eacute;sum&eacute;, including such memorable films as Louis Malle's ""The Lovers"" (1958) and Franois Truffaut's ""The 400 Blows"" (1959).  Maurice Jarre's discreet and beautiful musical score, together with a very appropriate old French song (""Aux marches du palais""), and other musical excerpts ranging from Tibetan music to works by classical composers including Thomaso Albinoni and Marc-Antoine Charpentier, and exquisite natural sounds, creates an other-worldly, timeless atmosphere.As mentioned above, the film's subject, the relationship between an adult man and a young girl, might be extremely controversial.  Although no sexual relation is ever suggested between Pierre and Cyb&egrave;le, their relationship being primarily emotional in nature (in Greek mythology, the goddess Earth Mother Cybele had a eunuch mendicant priesthood).  Nevertheless, many viewers and critics were none the less shocked and outraged. Times have not much changed: at a recent screening of the film at a cin&eacute;-club a few years ago, many viewers were appalled that such a ""eulogy to pedophilia"" could be shown. The strength of Bourguignon's film is the subtlety and sensitivity with which the subject is handled.  He never looks for the shocking or the melodramatic, or poses himself as a moralist. He is simply an emotional witness to the story where a child who has grown perhaps too fast and an adult who has reverted to childhood meet and emerge from their individual loneliness.  Bourguignon distances himself from the melodramatic by adopting an outsider's point of view:  his genius has been to put the viewer in the position of Madeleine and Carlos, rather than that of Pierre and Cyb&egrave;le.  Choosing the latter for the viewpoint would certainly have been detrimental to the film, manipulating the viewer's emotions to the extreme.  Following Bourguignon's suggestion, we should become a Madeleine or a Carlos, merely observing, and through our observations, try to understandThere is no doubt that ""Sundays and Cybele"" is a true French cinema masterpiece, and it would be quasi-criminal to still ignore it.  Fortunately, there are no more excuses, thanks to the film now being available on DVD.",5,"""Honi soit qui mal y pense"" (Evil be to him who evil thinks).",1332115200,"03 19,

He comments that this splendid film &quot;can't help but look terribly self-conscious now.&quot;  To whom?  To any but anyone with sufficient perspicacity to accept the quaintnesses of black&amp;white and a superb directorial style.  Anyone else, including myself, who has no problem accepting the easy transition between &quot;now&quot; (a word, like &quot;reality,&quot; which makes sense only between inverted commas) and &quot;then&quot; and has some understanding of the extent to which international film has severely ossified since &quot;then,&quot; must embrace Bourguignon's film with open arms.

While nostalgia certainly colored my viewing, I found it just as moving as I had so many years ago, when I was far less experienced & at an emotionally uncertain age -- not entirely unlike its two protagonists.This sort of story isn't in vogue today. No doubt most filmmakers would be reluctant to touch such a gentle, bittersweet story, since it deals with the relationship between a lonely 12-year old girl & a psychologically wounded 30-year old pilot. I'm afraid the sexually over-saturated atmosphere of contemporary culture would make the story just a little suspect, casting it in predatory terms.That's a shame, because we're in somewhat symbolic territory here, a landscape of the psyche as opposed to the ""real"" world. In fact, trying to judge this as a completely ""realistic"" film just doesn't work. It's true that some of the supporting characters are hard to accept as people you or I might know. But they aren't supposed to be, because this is a story of innocence -- its power, its fragility, and how a supposedly more ""sensible"" world distrusts it, distorts it, and ultimately destroys it.Hardy Kruger is very good as the shattered pilot, but young Patricia Gozzi is even better as the emotionally abandoned little girl. What an expressive face she has! Their relationship is tender, mutually supportive ... yet the director is honest enough to acknowledge a certain erotic undercurrent, where the purity of their love is tinged by something slightly more -- something unspoken, never to be acted upon, but still very real. Again, this would never be acceptable today.Each of the two protagonists is searching for a lost Eden, a redemption that exists in the private bubble of their relationship, a projected ideal each sees in the other ... but their idyll is finally ephemeral & doomed, just as we're all doomed to grow up. The ending is all too predictable & inevitable, of course. Could it really ever have ended any other way?The only drawback is that the film is only available on VHS, in a so-so print. This is crying for restoration & DVD release, as it's too good to be forgotten.
