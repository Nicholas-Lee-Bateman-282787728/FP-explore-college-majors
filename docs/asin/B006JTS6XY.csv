1516696,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B006JTS6XY,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[7, 7]","It's double the fun with Disney's double DVD release of the 2011 Disney Channel Original Movie ""Geek Charming"" and 10 episodes of Disney Channel's hit sitcom ""Shake It Up"".""Geek Charming"" made its debut on November 11, 2011 and was watched by 4.9 million viewers, the fifth largest number for a cable show that entire week.  The film is an adaptation of Robin Palmer's book ""Geek Charming"" and is directed by Jeffrey Hornaday (""Shout"", ""Madonna: Ciao, Italia! Live from Italy"") and written by Elizabeth Hackett and Hilary Galanoy.The film stars Sarah Hyland (""Modern Family"") as Dylan Schoenfield, a rich, spoiled, self-centered and popular girl at Woodlands Academy.  She and her friends love sporting the latest fashion but also dislikes anything that isn't cool.  Sarah's goal is to become this year's ""Blossom Queen"" and with her popularity, she hopes she can win!One day, while Dylan and friends were going to eat lunch, film club president and fellow student Josh Rosen (played by Matt Prokop, ""High School Musical 3: Senior Year"", ""Furry Vengeance"") accidentally runs into her and needless to say, all three girls get food all over them.Sarah cries out that popular people should not have to be in the same school as geeks.Meanwhile, Josh is in a lot of pressure as he needs to submit his film/documentary for the school's film festival.  After watching and observing Dylan, he decides to create a movie about the life of a popular girl and to explore if she's actually that shallow of a person.Dylan is delighted to be a star of a film but sees it as an opportunity for her to get more votes and be crowned Blossom Queen.As the two try to make a film, Josh is turned off by her diva-attitude as they both fight over who's move it is.  As Josh fires her, he eventually reconsiders when he finds out that Dylan had watched the sci-fi film ""Flight of the Navigator"".Despite Dylan feeling that popular girls and geeks can't co-exist, like cats and dogs are too different, the two start spending more time each other while making the movie.  And that is when Josh starts to see the true Dylan, a teenager who is driven to win the ""Blossom Queen"" because her dead mother was also ""Blossom Queen"" back in high school.  She admits to Josh that she feels more of a connection to her mother when she accomplishes similar things that she did.  And being ""Blossom Queen"" makes her feel more connected to her mom.But as she continues to film the movie, her popular boyfriend and her popular friends start to distance themselves away from her because she is spending more time with a ""geek"".  Dylan feels so comfortable around Josh, but at the same time, she doesn't want to lose her status as the most popular girl in school.What will she do?Disney's ""Shake It Up"" is a sitcom which premiered back in November 2010 and was created by writer/producer Chris Thompson (""Laverne & Shirley"", ""Bosom Buddies"", ""The Larry Sanders Show"").The film series focuses on two friends CeCe Jones (played by Bella Thorne, ""My Own Worst Enemy"", ""Dirty Sexy Money"", ""Big Love"") and Rocky Blue (""Frenemies""), both are stars of a local show known as ""Shake It Up Chicago"" and somehow these two tend to get into a bit of trouble on and off the set.Together with their friend Deuce Martinez (played by Adam Irogoyen), the three have big dreams of becoming professional dancers and with being hired on ""Shake It Up, Chicago!"", they want to go big!  Meanwhile, CeCe's little brother Flynn (played by Davis Cleveland) and his antics tend to get them into some trouble and are often in competition with brother and sister dance duo, Gunther (played by Kenton Duty) and Tinka (played by Caroline Sunshine).A total of ten episodes (of the 21-episode first season) are included in the ""Geek Charming"" DVD release.Included on this DVD are:DISC 1:Season 2, Episode 24A: A Shake It Up, Up and Away (Part 1) - CeCe and Rocky are touring but during a stop, CeCe and Rocky end up taking the wrong bus and the two including Flynn are stuck in Texas.Season 2, Episode 24B: Shake It Up, Up and Away (Part 2)  - CeCe and Rocky agree on taking on a Texas performance but they find out their performance will take place in air.Season 2, Episode 28: Double Pegasus It Up - CeCe and Rocky are excited that their idol, choreographer Theodore Vangorious  and creator of the dance move, the ""Double Pegasus"", is a person that Deuce delivers pizza too.Season 2, Episode 23: ""Three's a Crowd It Up"" - A dancer named Julio comes to perform on ""Shake It Up, Chicago!"" and Rocky, CeCe and Tinka fall for him.DISC 2:Season 2, Episode 25: ""Beam It Up"" - Ricky and CeCe attend a Halloween party at the ""Shake It Up, Chicago"" and both CeCe and Rocky meet guys at the party.Season 2, Episode 26: ""Doctor It Up"" - Rock's father, Dr. Curtis Blue, returns from his trip overseas and is unhappy to find his daughter dancing on television.Season 1, Episode 21: ""Throw It Up"" - CeCe and Rocky have the opportunity to perform a dance number with the English dance crew, ""The Highlighters"".Season 1, Episode 19: ""Twist It Up"" - CeCe and Rocky start a new dance craze and also start organizing Dina's birthday party.Season 1, Episode 10: ""Match It Up"" - Deuce and Savannah are in love but when Savannah finds someone who makes more money, she dumps him.Season 1, Episode 6: ""Age It Up"" - Rocky and CeCe get the opportunity to dance with teen star, Justin Starr.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Geek Charming"" is presented in widescreen 1:78:1 - Enhanced for 169 Televisions and audio is presented in English 2.0 Dolby Digital.  The film looks good on DVD and considering it's a newer film, picture quality is good especially since there are a good amount of outdoor scenes, and scenes are are well-lit.  Picture quality is also good for  ""Shake It Up"" which is comparable to the quality of series such as ""Hannah Montana"" and ""Sonny with a Chance"" and what one can expect from a DVD release.Subtitles are presented in English sDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Geek Charming"" comes with 10 episodes of ""Shake It Up"".JUDGMENT CALL:""Geek Charming"" is charming, heartwarming film, but be prepared to laugh but also shed some tears!When I first began watching ""Geek Charming"", the first thing that came into my mind was ""is this another `Mean Girls' type of film?"".  After all, the film focuses on a popular, self-centered girl who could care less about those who are not popular and her friends are the same.But things start to change when the popular girl Dylan and the passionate film fan Josh (who Dylan thinks is a ""geek""), decide to work together.  For Josh, he needs to submit a film before deadline and for Dylan, this is her chance to earn some points in order to become this year's ""Blossom Queen"".The film is a high point in the career of ""Modern Family"" actress Sarah Hyland as it gives her the opportunity to play a character with a variety of emotions.  While in school, she does take the ""popularity"" diva-ish attitude to the extreme, it's when she allows Josh into her life and he starts to discover that outside of school and her popular friends, she's a kind, intelligent girl who wants to feel a connection with her mother that died years ago.I enjoyed how the film transitioned from Dylan's more obnoxious side to showing a more kinder and gentler person, and we see how she changes through her time spent with Josh, despite her thinking that popular people and geeks can't get along.But ""Geek Charming"" may seem like your typical banal teenage film, popular girl falls for geek guy and vice versa, but it's how things come together for both people that I found heartwarming and endearing.And as for the DVD release, this is what makes ""Geek Charming"" much more enticing and its the fact that Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment included not one, not two but ten episodes of  Disney Channel's ""Shake It Up"".I've been reviewing Disney video releases for a long time and you never get a DVD release which includes more than 2 bonus episodes, and the fact that you get ten episodes from season 1 and 2 of ""Shake It Up"", definitely makes this DVD release even more enticing.Granted, it would have been nice to have special features of some kind with the talent of the show but Disney made up for it by including these bonus episodes.As for ""Shake It Up"", it's actually an interesting TV series.  Whereas ""Hannah Montana"" focused on a teenage pop star living two lives and hanging out with her best friend, ""Shake It Up"" features two dancers who dream of making it big!  And when both are cast for the local teenage dance show, we see the crazy antics that happen on and off camera. And similar to ""Hannah Montana"" which had Miley's brother and Rico often being the clowns of the series with their crazy antics, ""Shake It Up"" has Ty Blue and Deuce who often get into trouble at the local pizza shop where they work at.The episodes are fun, but also a bit farfetched as one episode features Cece and Rocky being strapped to an airplane while performing dance moves.  But at the same time, these episodes are full of humor and dancing that children will definitely enjoy this series.Overall, it's one thing to review ""Geek Charming"" and enjoying the film (as I do feel it is a good Disney Channel Original Movie) but when you add ten episodes of ""Shake It Up"" as extras, which is unheard of when it comes to Disney releases, all I can say is that ""Geek Charming"" fans are getting their money's worth. Because this is a pretty solid DVD release.Double the fun!  Disney's ""Geek Charming"" + ""Shake It Up"" is a fun and exciting combination and a Disney DVD release worth recommending!",5,"Disney Channel fans are getting their money's worth with one film + 10

Yes, high school students are at the center of the plot, however even being in my late 20's, I still enjoyed it!Dylan is a &#34;diva&#34; to the extreme, especially so during the first 15 or 20 minutes. I actually considered giving up on the movie during this time--just because she was so over-the-top about everything--however, I'm glad that I stuck with it. After the initial bit of time that is spent setting up the story, the main plot finally comes into play and the characters really begin to shine. I was quite surprised, in a good way, at how I got sucked into it.I liked how the movie showed that there are real people underneath the stereotyped &#34;popular&#34; and &#34;geek&#34; personalities, which is something that's often easy to forget. Dylan started out being ultra annoying, but over the course of the movie her real personality slowly surfaced and I actually ended up liking her. As for Josh...geek or not, I liked him from the start. He was just a nice guy, with a common-sense way of looking at things.I'm always a sucker for movies that bring together the unlikeliest of people, and this one certainly falls into that category. I liked how Dylan and Josh formed a friendship without even realizing it, and how they both started to pick up mannerisms and slang words from each other, just from spending time together. Oh, and I also wanted to mention Josh's film teacher: I loved his accent! :) Anyway, if you're looking for a clean, feel good movie, Geek Charming is definitely worth a look!",4,Fun story that brings together the unlikeliest of people,1399334400,"05 6, 2014",2014,1581,"['cute', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'appropriate', 'age', 'Yes', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'are', 'center', 'plot', 'however', 'even', 'being', 'late', '20', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'Dylan', '34', 'diva', '34', 'extreme', 'especially', 'so', 'first', '15', '20', 'minutes', 'actually', 'considered', 'giving', 'up', 'movie', 'time', 'just', 'was', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'everything', 'however', ""'m"", 'glad', 'stuck', 'initial', 'bit', 'time', 'spent', 'setting', 'up', 'story', 'main', 'plot', 'finally', 'play', 'characters', 'really', 'begin', 'shine', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'good', 'way', 'how', 'got', 'sucked', 'it.I', 'liked', 'how', 'movie', 'showed', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'underneath', 'stereotyped', '34', 'popular', '34', '34', 'geek', '34', 'personalities', 'something', 'often', 'easy', 'forget', 'Dylan', 'started', 'out', 'being', 'ultra', 'annoying', 'course', 'movie', 'real', 'personality', 'slowly', 'surfaced', 'actually', 'ended', 'up', 'liking', 'Josh', 'geek', 'not', 'liked', 'start', 'was', 'just', 'nice', 'guy', 'common-sense', 'way', 'looking', 'things.I', ""'m"", 'always', 'sucker', 'movies', 'bring', 'together', 'unlikeliest', 'people', 'one', 'certainly', 'category', 'liked', 'how', 'Dylan', 'Josh', 'formed', 'friendship', 'even', 'realizing', 'how', 'started', 'pick', 'up', 'mannerisms', 'slang', 'words', 'other', 'just', 'spending', 'time', 'together', 'Oh', 'also', 'wanted', 'mention', 'Josh', 'film', 'teacher', 'loved', 'accent', 'Anyway', ""'re"", 'looking', 'clean', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'Geek', 'Charming', 'definitely', 'worth', 'look']",N/A
