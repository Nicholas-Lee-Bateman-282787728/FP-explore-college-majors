Sure, some of the pontificating set me off.  Who likes pontificating?Mooney gasses away, sure. Maybe you like it maybe you don't.  Is that any more or less than is expected from comics who don't shy from social commentary?  If people like Mooney didn't do exactly what we see him do here, would he even have a job?  Or be worth seeing?  And would we, if not for comics daring and even overreaching sometimes, even have something to see?Mooney is almost always fun.  That's my first and best metric when it comes to judging comics.  I've used it to fail some very funny comedians when they resort to easy racist cliche-mongering, and I'll happily use it to celebrate everyone who really brings the funny, whatever it stirs up.  Mooney's historical(but funny) nonsense about Cleopatra aside, he ties the funny in to real issues worth thinking about.  If you need an attitude adjustment, Mooney's your man.I take it for granted that everyone is due an attitude adjustment. If you think you never do, you're probably in trouble. Mooney is here to help, and like all true wise men, he makes you laugh. He's flawed?  Yeah, maybe.  On the other hand, maybe he's just going for a laugh.  This show is a mixed batch.  If you want laughs, they're here.  If you want pure truth, some is here, but mixed with other stuff.  Don't expect this show to make you stop thinking by providing final answers or reliable facts.

It's my white perspective: there are too many implications created by the dynamic (and white guilt is no longer one of them, by the way).I don't know if the intent was to wake up people to the racism still alive and well in our society, and in some segments it does seem that Mr. Money is trying to get at something. But at other parts, seems he is just running a comedy show.Anyway, I welcome more serious content like this that helps keep us aware (especially people like me who grew up prejudiced and still are prejudiced by default) of the attitudes and assumptions we have.",4,"It's good for us 'white folks' to be disturbed and made uncomfortable, but ...",1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,938,"['lot', 'what', 'Paul', 'Mooney', 'say', 'really', 'important', 'white', 'people', 'hear', 'will', 'continue', 'watch', 'comedy', 'session', 'shake', 'use', 'N-word', 'comedy', 'context', 'just', 'something', 'have', 'tough', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'should', 'call', 'anyone', 'else', 'n*****', 'even', 'name-caller', 'Black', 'man', 'talking', 'Black', 'audience', 'white', 'perspective', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'implications', 'created', 'dynamic', 'white', 'guilt', 'no', 'longer', 'one', 'way', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'intent', 'was', 'wake', 'up', 'people', 'racism', 'still', 'alive', 'well', 'society', 'segments', 'seem', 'Mr.', 'Money', 'trying', 'get', 'something', 'other', 'parts', 'just', 'running', 'comedy', 'show.Anyway', 'welcome', 'more', 'serious', 'content', 'keep', 'aware', 'especially', 'people', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'prejudiced', 'still', 'are', 'prejudiced', 'default', 'attitudes', 'assumptions', 'have']",Paul Mooney's Analyzing White America
