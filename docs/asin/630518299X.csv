Viewing this only recently, I was touched by the social commentary of the director and writer, and by the performances of Ed  Harris, Jim Carrey, and Natascha McElhone.  The music added so much to such  a masterpiece, and without a doubt is some of the best I have ever heard.  Peter Weir's direction is superb, and The Truman Show's well-written script  deserves ultimate praise. It is rare that I see a truly outstanding motion  picture, but this one certainly qualifies for a place in my exclusive DVD  collection of all-time hits.  The best part is, I would actually watch  Truman and feel the same pity, hope, and joy as all his other viewers- I  wish him luck in the real world.",5,Masterful look at the human social condition,934156800,"08 9, 1999",1999,782,"['Truman', 'Show', 'should', 'have', 'been', '1998', 'Best', 'Picture', 'so-called', 'Academy', 'had', 'other', 'ideas', 'Viewing', 'only', 'recently', 'was', 'touched', 'social', 'commentary', 'director', 'writer', 'performances', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Natascha', 'McElhone', 'music', 'added', 'so', 'much', 'masterpiece', 'doubt', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'direction', 'superb', 'Truman', 'Show', 'well-written', 'script', 'deserves', 'ultimate', 'praise', 'rare', 'see', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'motion', 'picture', 'one', 'certainly', 'place', 'exclusive', 'DVD', 'collection', 'all-time', 'hits', 'best', 'part', 'would', 'actually', 'watch', 'Truman', 'feel', 'same', 'pity', 'hope', 'joy', 'other', 'viewers-', 'wish', 'luck', 'real', 'world']",N/A
453470,A2CRUETJKX1WA5,630518299X,absent_minded_prof,"[6, 6]","This is one of my favorite movies in recent history.  Jim Carrey here joins Robin Williams (&quot;Dead Poets Society,&quot; etc.) and Michael Keaton (&quot;Batman,&quot;  &quot;Pacific Heights,&quot; etc.), to be counted among the few comic actors who have managed a foray into the world of drama with spectacular success...  The basic idea of this film, as in all likelihood whoever is reading this already knows, is that Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, a man whose entire life has been surreptitiously filmed, and made into a sort of global media cult...  He is almost completely unaware of this, although now and then he has gotten an inkling that something's up.  Everything about this movie is perfect -- even Truman's name is a perfect mix -- &quot;True Man&quot;, which is what he is finally becoming, mixed with &quot;Burbank&quot;, the home of the phoniest people alive, the Hollywood establishment.I think one of the most important parts of this film is that Truman is turning 30 years old.  There is something about that age that, in my experience, really does involve a reassessment of all kinds of things in one's life.  There is a questioning that goes on, as well as a sort of heightened awareness of the social games around you that are really traps, if you think about them.  Some of them are traps that are probably worth fighting to stay locked up in, but now I'm revealing my bourgeois bias.  Be that as it may, given the general theme of becoming aware of perhaps living in some kind of fool's paradise --  if the main character of this movie were 16 years old, the movie would probably resemble &quot;Pump Up the Volume.&quot;  If the main character were 23, the movie might resemble &quot;The Matrix.&quot;  But the kind of awakening that happens in the early 30s is what's being captured here, and the director Peter Weir does everything perfectly.A couple things I wanted to say -- Noah Emmerich is terrific as the buddy, Marlon, who shows up with a six pack at crisis moments, to keep Truman's brain anaesthetized.  Noah seems to get typecast a little in the &quot;buddy&quot; role, he played a similar part in &quot;Beautiful Girls.&quot;  He does have a good look for that kind of role.  Oh well, I guess it's a living...  I also wanted to say that while it's easy to identify with Truman, breaking free of the lies that have bound his mind, I think anyone watching this should also ask themselves whether they've ever played the part of Cristoph, the director-overseer of the artificial world who keeps lying to Truman, to make Truman's &quot;happiness&quot; his (Cristoph's, not Truman's) responsibility.  I have done this in my life.  Looking at this movie, I identify at least as strongly with Cristoph as with Truman.  Probably even more.  This is the kind of mentality which could lead to someone becoming a mental abuser of a partner in any relationship -- romantic, familial, workplace, or what have you...  The killer storm that Cristoph invokes at the end, especially, reminded me of the kind of tantrum any controlling person might throw, if they could, to keep another human being under their thumb...  Cristoph made his decision to keep lying forever to the person who made his own &quot;happiness&quot; possible.  If anyone reading this is involved in any symbolically similar behavior, take a cue from this movie and change your ways while there's still time, and set the Truman in your life, whoever it is, free.  Just a thought.Fox Mulder, on the &quot;X-Files&quot; once famously mentioned that &quot;a choice given to many men is the choice between being a slave in heaven, or a master in hell.&quot;  The ending of this movie opens up the prospect of an exciting third possibility -- to be oneself, neither master nor slave, but a free being.  As long as you maintain a kind, gentle heart, which Truman clearly does, everyone should have that right.  This movie rules.  Absolutely worth owning.",5,"Good afternoon, good evening, good night - GREAT MOVIE!!",978307200,"01 1, 2001",2001,3943,"['one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'recent', 'history', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'here', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'quot', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'quot', 'etc', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'quot', 'Batman', 'quot', 'quot', 'Pacific', 'Heights', 'quot', 'etc', 'be', 'counted', 'few', 'comic', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'managed', 'foray', 'world', 'drama', 'spectacular', 'success', 'basic', 'idea', 'film', 'likelihood', 'whoever', 'reading', 'already', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Truman', 'Burbank', 'man', 'entire', 'life', 'been', 'surreptitiously', 'filmed', 'made', 'sort', 'global', 'media', 'cult', 'almost', 'completely', 'unaware', 'now', 'then', 'gotten', 'inkling', 'something', 'up', 'Everything', 'movie', 'perfect', 'even', 'Truman', 'name', 'perfect', 'mix', 'quot', 'True', 'Man', 'quot', 'what', 'finally', 'becoming', 'mixed', 'quot', 'Burbank', 'quot', 'home', 'phoniest', 'people', 'alive', 'Hollywood', 'establishment.I', 'think', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'parts', 'film', 'Truman', 'turning', '30', 'years', 'old', 'something', 'age', 'experience', 'really', 'involve', 'reassessment', 'kinds', 'things', 'one', 'life', 'questioning', 'as', 'well', 'sort', 'heightened', 'awareness', 'social', 'games', 'are', 'really', 'traps', 'think', 'are', 'traps', 'are', 'probably', 'worth', 'fighting', 'stay', 'locked', 'up', 'now', ""'m"", 'revealing', 'bourgeois', 'bias', 'Be', 'may', 'given', 'general', 'theme', 'becoming', 'aware', 'perhaps', 'living', 'kind', 'fool', 'paradise', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'were', '16', 'years', 'old', 'movie', 'would', 'probably', 'resemble', 'quot', 'Pump', 'Volume.', 'quot', 'main', 'character', 'were', '23', 'movie', 'might', 'resemble', 'quot', 'Matrix.', 'quot', 'kind', 'awakening', 'early', '30s', 'what', 'being', 'captured', 'here', 'director', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'everything', 'perfectly.A', 'couple', 'things', 'wanted', 'say', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'terrific', 'buddy', 'Marlon', 'who', 'up', 'six', 'pack', 'crisis', 'moments', 'keep', 'Truman', 'brain', 'anaesthetized', 'Noah', 'get', 'typecast', 'little', 'quot', 'quot', 'role', 'played', 'similar', 'part', 'quot', 'Beautiful', 'Girls.', 'quot', 'have', 'good', 'look', 'kind', 'role', 'Oh', 'well', 'guess', 'living', 'also', 'wanted', 'say', 'easy', 'identify', 'Truman', 'breaking', 'free', 'lies', 'have', 'bound', 'mind', 'think', 'anyone', 'watching', 'should', 'also', 'ask', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'played', 'part', 'Cristoph', 'director-overseer', 'artificial', 'world', 'who', 'lying', 'Truman', 'make', 'Truman', 'quot', 'happiness', 'quot', 'Cristoph', 'not', 'Truman', 'responsibility', 'have', 'done', 'life', 'Looking', 'movie', 'identify', 'least', 'strongly', 'Cristoph', 'Truman', 'Probably', 'even', 'more', 'kind', 'mentality', 'could', 'lead', 'someone', 'becoming', 'mental', 'abuser', 'partner', 'relationship', 'romantic', 'familial', 'workplace', 'what', 'have', 'killer', 'storm', 'Cristoph', 'end', 'especially', 'reminded', 'kind', 'tantrum', 'controlling', 'person', 'might', 'throw', 'could', 'keep', 'human', 'being', 'thumb', 'Cristoph', 'made', 'decision', 'keep', 'lying', 'forever', 'person', 'who', 'made', 'own', 'quot', 'happiness', 'quot', 'possible', 'anyone', 'reading', 'involved', 'symbolically', 'similar', 'behavior', 'take', 'cue', 'movie', 'change', 'ways', 'still', 'time', 'set', 'Truman', 'life', 'whoever', 'free', 'Just', 'thought.Fox', 'Mulder', 'quot', 'X-Files', 'quot', 'once', 'famously', 'mentioned', 'quot', 'choice', 'given', 'many', 'men', 'choice', 'being', 'slave', 'heaven', 'master', 'hell.', 'quot', 'ending', 'movie', 'up', 'prospect', 'exciting', 'third', 'possibility', 'be', 'master', 'slave', 'free', 'being', 'As', 'long', 'maintain', 'kind', 'gentle', 'heart', 'Truman', 'clearly', 'everyone', 'should', 'have', 'right', 'movie', 'rules', 'Absolutely', 'worth', 'owning']",N/A

It's still a worthwhile film, however.'The Truman Show' is clever in the way it gradually reveals the artificial nature of central character Truman's world. Jim Carey performs well as Truman - an actor people love or hate, but he suits the role admirably here, despite not being able to resist breaking out into his trademark exaggerated flourishes. Weir is a director who knows how to play the viewer's emotions, and the pathos of activists trying to tell Truman his life is a charade is beautiful.

You saw his vulnerabilty and confusion toward the end. Ed Harris shows his love for Truman but his unwillingness to let Truman experience anything that would make him more human undermines what he's trying to do.It also pointed out the flaws in the system, the main problem is that they made it too perfect and made it follow their own scripts instead of letting Truman discover these things for himself. They didn't allow him to have a legitimate and a real love interest and instead forced on him the relationship they wanted. But beyond that it shows the increasing voyeurism of the viewers.The Truman Show shows us what television is like know, even though it was filmed in 1998. It's really a remarkable and prophetic view of what we would and will continue to be interested in on TV. From Christof's first speech: people tired of seeing fake emotions and special effects to when he says,&quot;We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.&quot; We accept it as being reality, even though we latch on a little cynicism knowing that there is story editing, casted stereotypes, and &quot;confessionals.&quot; The &quot;reality&quot; is sucked out.

Just like we like to think we are at the top of the food chain and in control of our lives, so too does Truman believe that he makes real choices and that he is free. Little does he know that he is lives in a ""cage"".

It's a story with many levels of questions and interpretations, from the obvious to the existential. How far would television executives go for ratings? How much right does the public have to know all the details of someone's life? How much are we controlled by others? What is the nature of reality?However, simply as an allegory for middle-class life, it works extremely well and is deeply moving. When Truman begins to yearn to know more of the world, the people around him conspire to keep him in his claustrophobic environment, using guilt and manipulation. He has an aging mother, he has a job, he has a mortgage, he has friends, he has a wife who wants a baby - he is expected to be settled and happy. When he tries to interject a change of routine into his life despite their admonishments, he's thwarted by `acts of God'. Jim Carrey was perfectly cast as Truman, making the innocence and wistfulness of the character believable, as was Ed Harris as the god-like director who's both loving and wrathful towards his creation. The 1950's look to the controlled environment harks back to a time many people still think of as domestically ideal, a time when we had no doubts in our beliefs of what was right and proper and what wasn't.But perhaps the simplest message in it is that until we can overcome the expectations and limitations others impose on us, we will never be free.",5,Idyllic Prison,970617600,"10 4, 2000",2000,1587,"['will', 'know', 'now', 'surrealistic', 'movie', 'man', 'who', 'grown', 'up', 'controlled', 'environment', 'life', 'broadcast', 'television', 'aspect', 'life', 'planned', 'corporation', 'story', 'many', 'levels', 'questions', 'interpretations', 'obvious', 'existential', 'How', 'far', 'would', 'television', 'executives', 'go', 'ratings', 'How', 'much', 'right', 'public', 'have', 'know', 'details', 'someone', 'life', 'How', 'much', 'are', 'controlled', 'others', 'What', 'nature', 'reality', 'However', 'simply', 'allegory', 'middle-class', 'life', 'extremely', 'well', 'deeply', 'moving', 'When', 'Truman', 'yearn', 'know', 'more', 'world', 'people', 'conspire', 'keep', 'claustrophobic', 'environment', 'using', 'guilt', 'manipulation', 'aging', 'mother', 'job', 'mortgage', 'friends', 'wife', 'who', 'baby', 'expected', 'be', 'settled', 'happy', 'When', 'interject', 'change', 'routine', 'life', 'admonishments', 'thwarted', 'acts', 'God', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Truman', 'making', 'innocence', 'wistfulness', 'character', 'believable', 'was', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'god-like', 'director', 'who', 'loving', 'wrathful', 'towards', 'creation', '1950', 'look', 'controlled', 'environment', 'harks', 'back', 'time', 'many', 'people', 'still', 'think', 'domestically', 'ideal', 'time', 'when', 'had', 'doubts', 'beliefs', 'what', 'was', 'right', 'proper', 'what', ""wasn't.But"", 'perhaps', 'simplest', 'message', 'can', 'overcome', 'expectations', 'limitations', 'others', 'impose', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'free']",N/A

The 'cast', searching for Truman after his escape in the dark, is having a great deal of difficulty.Christof realizes the need for more light on the set and gives the order, &#34;Cue the sun!&#34; I love it. &#34;Cue the sun!&#34;, as only the creator can demand.Jim Carrey, in my opinion, is a talented actor with the depth to move from physical comedy to the serious subject depicted in The Truman Show. The manner in which he transforms his character from one of innocence into the realization that he's been tricked rings true for all of us. However, once he understands his plight, he makes good.

453483,A1GOI8745FGIDN,630518299X,"""an_avid_book_reviewer""","[2, 2]","The inspiring and heartfelt character of Truman reminded me of Forrest Gump.  This may be Carrey's best performance ever even though it doesn't at all tap into his comedian skills.This movie has many interpretations, but the one that stuck out most in my mind was that of ""the truth shall set you free"" versus ""ignorance is bliss.""Truman lives in an artificial world where all his ""friends"" and even his wife are paid actors.  Even the weather is fake and controlled.  The director Christof defends that Truman's world is just as real as the ""real world"" only Truman's world is much safer, more pleasant, etc.Once Truman begins to discover the truth of his world, his exploring nature leads him to break free from the studio world despite opposition, discomfort, and even endangerment to his life.  This is supposed to show that truth is better than deception and that we have free will, etc.  But if you think about it, Truman really had little choice.  How could he get in bed with wife again knowing that all along, she has been a paid actor, as have been all his friends.  How could he live with the betrayal; how could he continue as he had before knowing the world is watching him 24hrs a day?In the ending, Truman is on the border of the studio.  On one side is a pretty blue sky with a cheerful, although artificial, sun, and on the other side is an open door leading into complete darkness-- the outside ""real"" world.  After a conversation with Christof, he steps through the door, proclaiming a phrase he had used with his next door neighbors every morning, ""In case I don't see ya- good afternoon, good evening, and goodnight!""  Inspiring, but like I said, the real issue is whether or not Truman will ever wish he had never found out the truth about the studio world-- he was quite happy until he found out, after all.  I guess it will depend upon what life he makes for himself on the outside.  I think sometimes we want to be deceived or ignorant about things and other times we want the truth.  The truth can hurt and it isn't always ""enlightening.""The role of Christof introduces themes of God because that's what role he played.  When Truman and his best ""friend"" were sitting watching the artificial sunset, his friend remarked about what a paintbrush He has.  In the end when Christof is talking with Truman, he's speaking from above; Truman can't even see him nor has he ever met him although Christof has been watching him all Truman's life.  An interesting debate is whether or not Christof did Truman more good than harm.  When Truman behaves as he wants him to, Christof is benevolent to him.  When Truman tries to leave the studio, he is very wrathful.  Obviously, Christof's interests are not necessarily the same as Truman's and he decides he is better off rebelling despite Christof's retaliation.  Most of the viewers seem totally happy about Truman's escape from the studio so it seems that he will not be replaced by another character.  Overall, it is an inspiring, thought-provoking, and unique story.  ""The Matrix"" is similar, in that people are put into artificial worlds which exist only on computer.",4,"""Ignorance is bliss"" -VS- ""The truth shall set you free.""",1024444800,"06 19, 2002",2002,3135,"['inspiring', 'heartfelt', 'character', 'Truman', 'reminded', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'may', 'be', 'Carrey', 'best', 'performance', 'ever', 'even', ""n't"", 'tap', 'comedian', 'skills.This', 'movie', 'many', 'interpretations', 'one', 'out', 'most', 'mind', 'was', 'truth', 'shall', 'set', 'free', 'versus', 'ignorance', 'bliss', 'Truman', 'artificial', 'world', 'where', 'friends', 'even', 'wife', 'are', 'paid', 'actors', 'Even', 'weather', 'fake', 'controlled', 'director', 'Christof', 'Truman', 'world', 'just', 'as', 'real', 'real', 'world', 'only', 'Truman', 'world', 'much', 'safer', 'more', 'pleasant', 'etc.Once', 'Truman', 'discover', 'truth', 'world', 'exploring', 'nature', 'break', 'free', 'studio', 'world', 'opposition', 'discomfort', 'even', 'endangerment', 'life', 'supposed', 'show', 'truth', 'better', 'deception', 'have', 'free', 'will', 'etc', 'think', 'Truman', 'really', 'had', 'little', 'choice', 'How', 'could', 'get', 'bed', 'wife', 'again', 'knowing', 'along', 'been', 'paid', 'actor', 'have', 'been', 'friends', 'How', 'could', 'live', 'betrayal', 'how', 'could', 'continue', 'had', 'knowing', 'world', 'watching', '24hrs', 'day', 'ending', 'Truman', 'border', 'studio', 'one', 'side', 'pretty', 'blue', 'sky', 'cheerful', 'artificial', 'sun', 'other', 'side', 'open', 'door', 'leading', 'complete', 'darkness', 'outside', 'real', 'world', 'conversation', 'Christof', 'door', 'proclaiming', 'phrase', 'had', 'used', 'next', 'door', 'neighbors', 'morning', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'ya-', 'good', 'afternoon', 'good', 'evening', 'goodnight', 'Inspiring', 'said', 'real', 'issue', 'not', 'Truman', 'will', 'ever', 'wish', 'had', 'never', 'found', 'out', 'truth', 'studio', 'world', 'was', 'quite', 'happy', 'found', 'out', 'guess', 'will', 'depend', 'what', 'life', 'outside', 'think', 'sometimes', 'want', 'be', 'deceived', 'ignorant', 'things', 'other', 'times', 'want', 'truth', 'truth', 'can', 'hurt', ""n't"", 'always', 'enlightening', 'role', 'Christof', 'introduces', 'themes', 'God', 'what', 'role', 'played', 'When', 'Truman', 'best', 'friend', 'were', 'sitting', 'watching', 'artificial', 'sunset', 'friend', 'remarked', 'what', 'paintbrush', 'end', 'when', 'Christof', 'talking', 'Truman', 'speaking', 'Truman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'ever', 'met', 'Christof', 'been', 'watching', 'Truman', 'life', 'interesting', 'debate', 'not', 'Christof', 'did', 'Truman', 'more', 'good', 'harm', 'When', 'Truman', 'Christof', 'benevolent', 'When', 'Truman', 'leave', 'studio', 'very', 'wrathful', 'Obviously', 'Christof', 'interests', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'same', 'Truman', 'better', 'off', 'rebelling', 'Christof', 'retaliation', 'Most', 'viewers', 'seem', 'totally', 'happy', 'Truman', 'escape', 'studio', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'replaced', 'character', 'Overall', 'inspiring', 'thought-provoking', 'unique', 'story', 'Matrix', 'similar', 'people', 'are', 'put', 'artificial', 'worlds', 'exist', 'only', 'computer']",N/A
453484,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,630518299X,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","The concept behind `The Truman Show' is more pertinent to us today than it was when the film was released.  Sure, the idea of television controlling the world is not a new one, but in a world where every new television program is another take at the reality genre it becomes more and more probable that an event such as this one may one day take place.  The opening words by the shows creator say it all:""We've become bored with watching actors give us phony emotions.  We are tired of pyrotechnics and special effects.""With that said, `The Truman Show' begins.  The film tells the story of Truman Burbank, the only non-actor in a world filled with actors.  He is married to an actress; his best friend is an actor; his high school teachers and current employer and seriously everyone around him, from his mother to his late father to the person that happens to walk by his house at precisely the same moment every morning.  The thing is, Truman doesn't know this.  He actually thinks that his life is legit, but what he doesn't comprehend is the fact that everyone in the known universe is watching his every move being projected onto their living room television set.Yes, Truman is the star of his own reality show; a reality show he is unaware exists.I remember watching this film when it was first released and I was merely thirteen and I felt that the film was boring and unentertaining.  Because of the misinterpretation I stayed far away from this film for years, only recently entertaining the notion of watching it once again.  My feelings the second time around are vastly different.  `The Truman Show' is a marvelous study of the effect that television and the media in general has on each and every individual, and the damage it can do to ones psyche.The acting here is beyond good, especially when in regards to the star of the whole show; Jim Carrey.  Many have said that this is a career best for Carrey, and I think I may have to agree (although he was beyond superb in `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' as well).  He brilliantly captures Truman's naivety and his destructive curiosity once he starts to put the pieces together.  Laura Linney is wonderful as Truman's wife Meryl, contrasting her faux perfection with her genuine dissatisfaction with her actorly existence.  I was not entirely blown away by Ed Harris (the only Oscar nominated performance in the bunch) for I felt that his performance was not a very difficult one.  He pulls it off, sure, but there wasn't much to pull off here.  Supporting players like Natascha McElhone and Noah Emmerich are also wonderfully complete and add layers to each and every scene.What I love so much about `The Truman Show' is that it stays true to the concept in every aspect of the film.  There are product placements throughout the entire film, and they pop up in the most ridiculous manner, which adds light to the idea that television is steadily controlling our every thought and action.  The script is brilliantly fleshed out, creating real characters with real problems and real concerns.  Weir's direction is amazing, visually captivating from start to finish by using techniques (with camera angles and placement) that create an air of reality within this faux reality.This is what makes television worth watching.",5,My kind of reality show...,1221523200,"09 16, 2008",2008,3291,"['concept', 'Truman', 'Show', 'more', 'pertinent', 'today', 'was', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'Sure', 'idea', 'television', 'controlling', 'world', 'not', 'new', 'one', 'world', 'where', 'new', 'television', 'program', 'take', 'reality', 'genre', 'more', 'more', 'probable', 'event', 'such', 'one', 'may', 'one', 'day', 'take', 'place', 'opening', 'words', 'shows', 'creator', 'say', ""'ve"", 'become', 'bored', 'watching', 'actors', 'give', 'phony', 'emotions', 'are', 'tired', 'pyrotechnics', 'special', 'effects', 'said', 'Truman', 'Show', 'begins', 'film', 'story', 'Truman', 'Burbank', 'only', 'non-actor', 'world', 'filled', 'actors', 'married', 'actress', 'best', 'friend', 'actor', 'high', 'school', 'teachers', 'current', 'employer', 'seriously', 'everyone', 'mother', 'late', 'father', 'person', 'walk', 'house', 'precisely', 'same', 'moment', 'morning', 'thing', 'Truman', ""n't"", 'know', 'actually', 'life', 'legit', 'what', ""n't"", 'comprehend', 'fact', 'everyone', 'known', 'universe', 'watching', 'move', 'being', 'projected', 'living', 'room', 'television', 'set.Yes', 'Truman', 'star', 'own', 'reality', 'show', 'reality', 'show', 'unaware', 'exists.I', 'remember', 'watching', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'was', 'merely', 'thirteen', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'boring', 'unentertaining', 'misinterpretation', 'stayed', 'far', 'away', 'film', 'years', 'only', 'recently', 'entertaining', 'notion', 'watching', 'once', 'again', 'My', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'are', 'vastly', 'different', 'Truman', 'Show', 'marvelous', 'study', 'effect', 'television', 'media', 'general', 'individual', 'damage', 'can', 'do', 'ones', 'acting', 'here', 'good', 'especially', 'when', 'regards', 'star', 'whole', 'show', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Many', 'have', 'said', 'career', 'best', 'Carrey', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'agree', 'was', 'superb', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'as', 'well', 'brilliantly', 'Truman', 'naivety', 'destructive', 'curiosity', 'once', 'put', 'pieces', 'together', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'wonderful', 'Truman', 'wife', 'Meryl', 'contrasting', 'faux', 'perfection', 'genuine', 'dissatisfaction', 'actorly', 'existence', 'was', 'not', 'entirely', 'blown', 'away', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'only', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'bunch', 'felt', 'performance', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'difficult', 'one', 'off', 'sure', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'pull', 'off', 'here', 'Supporting', 'players', 'Natascha', 'McElhone', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'are', 'also', 'wonderfully', 'complete', 'add', 'layers', 'scene.What', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'Truman', 'Show', 'true', 'concept', 'aspect', 'film', 'are', 'product', 'placements', 'entire', 'film', 'pop', 'up', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'manner', 'light', 'idea', 'television', 'steadily', 'controlling', 'thought', 'action', 'script', 'brilliantly', 'fleshed', 'out', 'creating', 'real', 'characters', 'real', 'problems', 'real', 'concerns', 'Weir', 'direction', 'amazing', 'visually', 'captivating', 'start', 'finish', 'using', 'techniques', 'camera', 'angles', 'placement', 'create', 'air', 'reality', 'faux', 'reality.This', 'what', 'television', 'watching']",N/A

The Truman Show's  basic idea carries an undoubtful  cruel and sad felling, but in the hands of Peter Weir, a talented filmmaker  who believes in the humanity and in hope, the film turns out to be an  interesting, funny, and entertaining masterpiece, although it has an  undeniable sad context. Truman is played to perfection by an actor who I've  never thought that he could actually act, Jim Carrey. In this dramatic,  powerful and blessed hole, Carrey delivers an excellent job! certainly he  deserved the Golden Globe for this breakthrough performance. Carrey builds  an ingenuous, good and honest man, making impossible for the audience stop  caring and loving him. And during the whole running time of the film, you  will find yourself laughing, having a great time and sometimes crying for  Truman at each curve his fate takes.  The supporting performances stand out  for their quality, Laura Linney (from Congo, a great flick about explorers  who are hunted down by killer gorillas in a mountain, available at Amazon)  offers an unforgetable interpretation, playing with ear-to-ear smiles a  cold and cruel actress. It's beyond me the reason why she didn't receive  any Oscar nomination, but it's  said that Paramount, Truman's  studio,  tried to nominate her in the Best Actresses Category but the year's other  main performances (Cate Blanchet, Fernanda Montenegro) were more applauded,  but had they took the Supporting Category, she would be a tough contestant  for the Oscar. Ed Harris' Christof is one of those characters that will  live forever in the hearts of the audience, and Truman, well, Truman is  perhaps the most upright, honest and sweet hero that Hollywood ever  conceived. The technical aspects count with curious, never-seen-before  camera movements, intelligent and different ways of shooting the scenes and  a strong direction by Weir. The Truman Show is available at Amazon, the DVD  and VHS include the original trailers and interviews with the cast and  director. Own this masterpiece!

You either love him and see his incredible talent, or you hate him and refuse to see or acknowledge his talent. If you fall into the latter, well, that's too bad. Carrey went and tried to do something different with this film. He tried to show that he can act too. If you still don't see it, I recommend you seeing the early 90's TV movie ""Doing Time On Maple Drive"". In this film, Carrey plays Truman Burbank. A seemingly normal guy with a very normal, everyday life. He has a great house in a very picturesque seaside town, a great wife, and a good job. This is real life isn't it?. Then, Truman's world comes crashing down all around him. Everything he knew and had and throught to be true, turned out to be one big lie. Nothing is real. It seems that his whole life has been televised for the whole world to see. This isn't a town. It's a set. everything isn't real. His family members are all actors being paid for the job. The whole operation is being overseen by a producer, played very beautifully by the Oscar nominated Ed Harris, who's always good. At first, Truman thinks he's losing the mind. Then the truth comes out. This is a real showcase for Carrey and his talent. Yes, he is good. Yes, he can act. Yes, he's brilliantly talented. Some people already have their view on him and refuse to let actual truth come to them. It's a real shame. The movie was wonderfully directed with a real airy and haunting feel by Peter Weir. And don't worry Carrey fans, there is some goofball moments that will please the die hard fans of Carrey's comedic work. He should've been nominated for the Oscar. Weir and Harris were, but the star of the movie who made it work wasn't?. Where's the logic in that?. Oh well. ""The Truman Show"" is a fine piece of film.

CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 2]","The Truman Show is a pretty good show, but like the security guards who watched it religiously year after year, when it is over you'll ask yourself, ""What else is on?"" It had a High Concept that was executed well--that unbeknownst to Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), his whole life was filmed 24/7 for the ultimate 'reality show.' It didn't really take off for me, though. It was like a big jet airplane taxiing down the runway, looking like it was about to take off, but it never did. Your mileage may vary. I think The Cable Guy was Carrey's Citizen Kane, so that's where I'm coming from. The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was another career milestone. Call me a fool, but I think Dumb and Dumber was classic Carrey. I thought 'Truman' was good, just not as good as some of Carrey's other stuff.What if anything did I like about it? I really liked Natascha McElhone as the woman he wanted, the way her eyes haunted him. Loved how he made the collage of her face from magazine pictures, and kept it as a keepsake. For some reason, she just wasn't in his official script, so she was an excellent symbol of the tragedy that was the Truman Show for Truman Burbank. It's true his life wasn't so bad, but how sad that EVERYTHING in his world was just a phony and fake movie set. Paul Giamatti has a small part that he manages to make the most of. Still, it is Miles away from Sideways. Laura Linney is pretty good as his wife, but she's no Natascha McElhone. Ed Harris is fantastic as Christof, the director of The Truman Show. Did anyone see him in Glengarry Glen Ross?-------------------Christof: We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented.===========Holland Taylor, who plays Charlie Sheen's mother, Real Estate Agent Evelyn Harper on TV's Three & 1/2 Men, played Truman's mom. She looked great for her age; almost as good as she did in 1985's Key Exchange. Was that one about Real Estate, too?Bottom Line is you might want to watch The Truman Show if there was nothing else on, but first check out The Cable Guy and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and maybe even The Man on the Moon.-------------------Marlon: Where the hell's Fiji?

But Truman Show proves to be the exception to the rule. Intended as a comedy, it turns out to be rather thought provoking and moving. The story follows Truman Burbanks, a 30 year old man who has never left his home town. Unbeknown to him, he lives in a giant studio that is visible from space, was adopted at birth by a movie corporation and is viewed daily by millions around the globe.In the 21st century, television viewers in general have reached the point where they are fascinated by individual lives, a trait as old as gossip. Watch Big Brother if you don't believe me. Truman Show is impressive in that it portrays this new trend three or four years before it emerges (it was released in 1998). TV junkies and couch potatoes have an infatuation with watching other people run their lives, hence Big Brother, Survivor and such other series.Personally, I find this a huge waste of time and was not surprised at the recent drop in consumer spending (and hence economy strength) in First World countries - they're all watching TV! Fortunately for the UK and US, Christmas came and everyone suddenly went out buying presents, so the economy was saved.But getting back to the movie, Truman eventually begins to discover what's happening due to some freakish accidents. A studio light falls from the sky, his car radio changes frequency and begins to follow him around. And there's the mysterious Sylvia who manages to spoil the studio's profits by nearly telling Truman what's up and thus making him more inquisitive.The Show is brilliant, and definitely a worthwhile watch. It is funny in parts, more sobering in others. We realise how completely oblivious Truman is to his world (initially, at least) and, for those who've never left home, makes us wonder if WE might be a Truman (figuratively of course)",4,Jim Carrey at his Best,1009929600,"01 2, 2002",2002,1972,"['am', 'not', 'fan', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'find', 'many', 'movies', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'watch', 'quot', 'Me', 'Myself', 'Irene', 'quot', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'Truman', 'Show', 'be', 'exception', 'rule', 'Intended', 'comedy', 'out', 'be', 'rather', 'thought', 'provoking', 'moving', 'story', 'Truman', 'Burbanks', '30', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'left', 'home', 'town', 'Unbeknown', 'giant', 'studio', 'visible', 'space', 'was', 'adopted', 'birth', 'movie', 'corporation', 'viewed', 'daily', 'millions', 'globe.In', '21st', 'century', 'television', 'viewers', 'general', 'have', 'reached', 'point', 'where', 'are', 'fascinated', 'individual', 'lives', 'trait', 'as', 'old', 'gossip', 'Watch', 'Big', 'Brother', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Truman', 'Show', 'impressive', 'new', 'trend', 'three', 'four', 'years', 'was', 'released', '1998', 'TV', 'junkies', 'couch', 'potatoes', 'have', 'infatuation', 'watching', 'other', 'people', 'run', 'lives', 'hence', 'Big', 'Brother', 'Survivor', 'such', 'other', 'series.Personally', 'find', 'huge', 'waste', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'surprised', 'recent', 'drop', 'consumer', 'spending', 'hence', 'economy', 'strength', 'First', 'World', 'countries', ""'re"", 'watching', 'TV', 'Fortunately', 'UK', 'US', 'Christmas', 'came', 'everyone', 'suddenly', 'went', 'out', 'buying', 'presents', 'economy', 'was', 'saved.But', 'getting', 'back', 'movie', 'Truman', 'eventually', 'discover', 'what', 'happening', 'due', 'freakish', 'accidents', 'studio', 'light', 'sky', 'car', 'radio', 'changes', 'frequency', 'follow', 'around', 'mysterious', 'Sylvia', 'who', 'spoil', 'studio', 'profits', 'nearly', 'telling', 'Truman', 'what', 'up', 'thus', 'making', 'more', 'inquisitive.The', 'Show', 'brilliant', 'definitely', 'worthwhile', 'watch', 'funny', 'parts', 'more', 'sobering', 'others', 'realise', 'how', 'completely', 'oblivious', 'Truman', 'world', 'initially', 'least', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'left', 'home', 'wonder', 'WE', 'might', 'be', 'Truman', 'figuratively', 'course']",N/A

Middleton,"[11, 12]","A truly original and moving film, with the combined talents of Australian director Peter Weir (Master and Commander, Witness) and Andrew Nicole, (Lord of War, Gattacca, Simone) with his exceptional writing ability, The Truman Show hit the theatres across the board with dazzling critical acclaim not seen in the industry for many years.Andrew Nicole is an exceptionally gifted writer. New Zealand born, trained in London, making commercials, he travelled to Hollywood submitting his Truman script. Evidently the film execs told him that Truman was at least an $80 million project and they could not and would not attempt to sell a first-time screenplay to the studio. He went back to his little apartment and penned, Gattacca, a story about a future dystopian world based on the potential horrors of a society organized by way of genetics'...for less than $40 million. He directed Gattacca that ended up making more money than anyone, including the studio execs, ever dreamt.Consequently, The Truman show got the green light, however, again, the studio could not invest their dollars into a one-time director and screenplay writer, Nicole. Peter Weir finally, after hours and days of deliberation, got the job and pre-production began in earnest.Jim Carey at that point in time had only played over the top comedic roles. A real genius in many respects, he jumped whole heatedly into the character of Truman, revealing his range of talent as an actor. The character, Truman, represents everyman, an individual evolving as a ""product"" of his environment, the media and the sheer power of advertising.Since Truman's conception he has been the focus of millions of television viewers. For over thirty years, the TV viewing public has seen Truman move through his life. This ""Reality"" show had become a multi-billion dollar industry, as advertisers clamoured to be seen, until Truman's perfectly constructed world begins to deconstruct and everything falls apart.Everything about this film is astounding: cinematography, creating camera angles never seen before in conventional film. The sets, Seahaven, could be any town across the world. A beautiful soundtrack from Phillip Glass and Truman's perfect wife, Meryl, (Laura Linney) a quasi ""Stepford"" wife from the fifties. Truman's best friend, Marlon, (Noah Emmerich) was outstanding as Truman's childhood friend. The entire cast and crew contributed to this wholly remarkable story about our modern world.The most interesting character has to be Christof, (Ed Harris) the man responsible for the `The Truman Show', an egotist, a self-realized god-like individual who would rather see his ""creation"" live in his artifice than the ""real' world.

453522,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,630518299X,David Baldwin,"[2, 2]","""The Truman Show"" is a masterful collaboration between director Peter Weir, scriptwriter Andrew Niccol, and star Jim Carrey.  Though seemingly light in tone the film makes an ominous statement about our voyeuristic society even at the most mundane.  Niccol in his other projects has taken a fairly pessimistic view of society in his masterful ""Gattaca"" and the underrated ""SIMONE"" but ""The Truman Show"" is his most powerful indictment of human nature yet.  The film concerns Truman Burbank(Carrey) a rather affable fellow who lives a blissful life in the town of Seahaven with a seemingly perfect wife(Laura Linney) until he comes to the realization that it's all been a lie.  His entire life has been concocted by a television director, Christof(Ed Harris) and that his friends and relations are all paid actors.  Naturally, Truman's impulse would be to escape such an existence but there is too much riding on him to stay on the air and Christof will use all of his Svengalian powers to keep him in place.  Carrey gives probably his most effective screen performance to date evoking not only the comedy inherent in his role but also the pathos.  Harris, in a role that probably should have won him the Oscar, nearly steals the film as Christof.  His arrogance at Truman's attempts to escape from his power and the petulence he displays is masterful.  Linney is also effective as Truman's wife with the perpetual smile fixed on her face knowing full well that the cameras are on.  Natascha McElhone is also good as the woman who wants Truman to escape his stifling existence.

I watched The Truman Show again a few nights ago and was struck by how presciently it predicted the craziness of reality television. Insurance salesman Truman Burbank (a magnificent performance by Carrey) starts to crack up as he suspects his life is a sham and he is being filmed to entertain a mass audience. He wants to get out of his little community and finds his path blocked every time, be it by the driver of the bus to Chicago deliberately wrecking the gearbox or the travel agency with a picture of an airliner being hit by lightning under the slogan ""It could happen to you"". This is a sly film and you need to watch it several times to pick up all the comedy. The script is magnificent and shows us how the other characters in the show - the ones playing his wife and best friend - have an increasingly tough time dealing with Truman's mental disintegration. He is an animal on display and eventually he decides to escape, much to the wrath of the show's God-like creator. The final scene is particularly good and also very moving.

Instead of Christof (or his predecessor, the Wizard of Oz)  could there be aliens Out There running their TV show of us?We can't get  out of this solar system.  The sun is rigged Out There.  Just as Truman  could never sail to Fiji, no human can live long enough to transverse  interstellar space to Alpha Centuri Proxima, the nearest star.  Before the  gods we must have demigods in the form of those looking over us, real or  imagined.  Does it make any difference?  And as Christof says, we accept  the reality that is given us, so we could be fooled.Anyway, ""The  Truman Show"" begins with a startling premise marvelously presented.  The  script by Andrew Niccol is a work of art and the direction by Peter Weir  sure-handed and seamless.  He allows the story to unfold at a convincing  pace and the fifties cum nineties TV Americana feel to the ""Seahaven"" sets  is delightful.  Jim Carrey is perfect as Truman Burbank, the poor sap in a  fishbowl.  Everything about his life, including his wife and best friend  are totally fake (try that on for size).  Ed Harris as the megalomanic TV  artist Christof is creepy enough, although the scenes with him are  ironically less convincing than those in Truman's world.  I thought he came  across a little too much like a mad scientist.  Laura Linny as Carrey's TV  wife/product spokesperson with the ever present TV smile is wonderful, and  good too is his estranged girl friend, Natascha McElhone with the big  eyes.Some unanswered questions.  We know there is a camera in the  bathroom.  Do they switch to another shot when he is using it or does the  world-wide audience watch him move his bowels?  And is his wife a ""whore""  as well as a TV actress or is their relationship purely Platonic?  Does the  audience see them together in the bedroom?  Does she have a life away from  him?

453529,AZ1H3VLCDR298,630518299X,Derrick Thomas,"[2, 2]","I have, ever since he was a regular on In Living Color, been a big fan of Jim Carrey. First he did Fire Marshall Bill on the show, then moved to the big screen with Ace Ventura, then Dumb and Dumber, making some of the funniest movies of the 90's. He has become known for making some really crazy films, and has been labeled by many critics inmature and very over-the-top. So it was with great interest that I went to go see Jim Carrey in the Truman Show, a drama directed by Peter Weir, probably best known for directing Dead Poets Society. I had high hopes as well, since it was Weir who directed Robin Williams in that film, a known &quot;crazy man&quot;, and ended up winning Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards.Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, a man who seems to have it all: a beatiful wife, a nice home, a steady job, and friendly neighbors in a nice small island town. But lately, he has been feeling unrest, a yearning, to go out and see the world, escape New Haven and experience life, not just the candy-coated version he had been handed. But it goes much deeper than that, as he soon finds out. His dead father suddenly reappears one day on the street as a homeless man, and after he is carried away by strangers for no reason, Truman starts to question everything around him, including the ones he loves.For you see, Truman is the center of a great television show, called of course, The Truman Show. His whole life has been a sham, with his family nothing more than actors, and his entire surroundings a giant set in the middle of Los Angeles. The whole world is tuned in to him everyday, 24/7, and has been addicted to the show for over 30 years. There are Truman coffee mugs, Truman pillows, Truman dollhouses based on the real ones on the set, and even Truman bars, where people go to just watch the show. It is nothing short of a world-wide phenomona, created by  Christof, the man who originally came up with the idea and saw to the construction of it. He sees himself as Truman's surrogate father, and truly believes that he is benefiting Truman, as well as the viewing public.I won't go into too many more details of the plot, for there are those of you who have not seen it. But what I found to be fascinating is not only Jim Carrey's subdued, sympathetic performance, but the moral implications as well. We have today seen the sanctity of marriage destroyed in a &quot;reality&quot; program, witness voyeuristically first-hand people's sorrows and personal distasters, and while we say some of these programs are disgusting and against every moral fiber in our bodies, we continue to watch, and give these networks some of the highest ratings they have ever seen outside of the Super Bowl. I think this film raises several good points: how far would we go? And why are we so addicted to our televisions that we need to spend a hundred dollars a month on programming for 300 channels, that we need to catch every word of our favorite programs so we won't be left behind? The Truman Show is a great film to watch time and time again for entertainment, but it is also one of the most important cultural satires to come our way in a long time.As for the technical aspects of the film, I thought the musical score was brought out fantastically through the 5.1 surround sound. And the colors are supurb, almost life-like. And if you have a widescreen television, you are in luck, because this film has an aspect ratio that goes great with your televisions, no ugly letterbox.

Such is the fatal flaw of The Truman Show, an ambitious, visually stunning, intellectually advanced film that restores faith in major-studio product.I've heard both gushing adoration and  invective-based indictment of this film, so I wished to make a clear-headed  assessment.  I loved the film but very much disliked the star that plays  the central character of this character-based science-fiction allegory.I  am well aware that Carrey was probably the reason that an  anti-establishment piece like this got greenlit.  Unfortunately, he was  wrong for the role.  The masterstroke thematic and narrative argument of  this film is that a genuine, everyday person can be the emotional salvation  of millions of robotic, brainwashed people around the world.  By casting  Carrey, who has not as single genuine bone in his whole acting technique,  Peter Weir compromised Truman's humanity, upon which hangs his whole  film.That aside, The Truman Show is a film of stunning craft -- from the  Dagwitz/Glass score to Peter Biziou's amazing photography; from the  flawless production design to Andrew Niccol's top-notch script; and the  supporting players, led by a flaky Laura Linney (showing much comic  ability) and the low-key, infallible Ed Harris.  A brilliant touch casting  Harris as a godhead -- when the facade of the God is ripped down, Harris'  crushed reaction is brilliant.From a purely aesthetic viewpoint  (film-industry practices aside), this film could've benefitted from a  non-name star.

Although Truman Burbank (predictably)ends up leaving the TV world and enters the real world at the end (and is presumably happy), the ending is less than inspiring. No amount of triumphant violin music at the end can change the fact that Truman wasted most of his life, if you can call it that. So see this tear-jerker disguised as a heart-warming comedy. But Carrey fans, beware. This is this most understated performances yet. No rubber-face antics here. He almost (gasp) plays it straight.

Well to those who thought that I hope they eventually saw this because it really is good, how dare they to doubt.Truman Burbank is one of the best guys in the world who is loved by all and he gives that love back. He is the most polite and happy guy ever who has a nice life with a wife and best friend who love him. Or so he thought as his obsession with a lost love drives him to question what is real or fake. As he digs deeper and deeper things get riskier because he may find something he really does not want to know. His life as he knows it may have all been planned including his wife. Everyone around him seems to be in on it except the lady he so longingly wants to find. She is the one person who tried to tell him the truth, and as he tries to find the truth and leave the entire town tries to keep him there. It turns out that everything in his life is fake and he is forced to live out his life in this little bubble of a world, his life predetermined for him. A TV producer who adopted him as a new born has created a whole world around him and made him grow up there. It really is one of the most interesting films I have seen because this film may truly happen.Jim Carrey is absolutely brilliant in this dramatic comedy showcases both sides of the actor all in the same film. The film does have its comedic moments especially the first half of the film but it is the dramatic stuff were Carrey truly shines. For those who have not seen this he truly gives an award winning performance in my opinion. There is a scene in particular that really shows the pain and struggle of the character. In this scene he appears to be beaten when his boat reaches the end, it is a short scene but it is great. He shows excellent range in this film because up to this point in his career he was truly looked at as just a comedian.Ed Harris as always is excellent and is brilliant in the lead villain role of a TV producer who wants nothing but ratings. He will go to any lengths to make his show a success and any lengths to keep Truman inside his world. Harris is perfect in this role even making him seem human at times. Laura Linney plays his wife in this film and is great, bringing life to a role were she is an actress, love it. Noah Emmerich as well is great in the film as his best friend; Paul Giamatti and Adam Tomei also are good as assistants to the producer. Everyone in the film do a great job as people who are all actors, I wonder if that was hard.Written marvelously by Andrew Niccol this truly is a great film that mixes a perfect balance of different types of films. I can find moments for comedies, dramas, action, suspense, even horror because to be honest it is like one big Twilight Zone story. This film could have been a straight up comedy or a complete drama or even a really darker film, and all of them would have worked even with the same cast. While all those would have worked I happen to like the film director Peter Weir gave us. I highly recommend this movie because I have always enjoyed from day one. Skip the rental and buy this like I did, I think any movie goer will appreciate this film. Also there is an excellent and very in-depth behind the scenes feature on here.",5,CARREY SHINES ONCE MORE,1264896000,"01 31, 2010",2010,3779,"['TRUMAN', 'SHOWWe', 'people', 'seem', 'be', 'obsessed', 'watching', 'other', 'people', 'lives', 'ours', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'called', 'reality', 'TV', 'Sure', 'watch', 'see', 'people', 'more', 'pathetic', 'then', 'most', 'part', 'people', 'watch', 'other', 'people', 'feel', 'lives', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'Whatever', 'reason', 'ther3e', 'was', 'movie', 'kind', 'touched', 'type', 'thing', 'may', 'give', 'look', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'future', 'reality', 'TV', 'course', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'lot', 'people', 'doubted', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'was', 'acting', 'more', 'serious', 'how', 'dare', 'Well', 'who', 'thought', 'hope', 'eventually', 'saw', 'really', 'good', 'how', 'dare', 'doubt.Truman', 'Burbank', 'one', 'best', 'guys', 'world', 'who', 'loved', 'love', 'back', 'most', 'polite', 'happy', 'guy', 'ever', 'who', 'nice', 'life', 'wife', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'love', 'so', 'thought', 'obsession', 'lost', 'love', 'question', 'what', 'real', 'fake', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'things', 'get', 'riskier', 'may', 'find', 'something', 'really', 'not', 'want', 'know', 'life', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'planned', 'including', 'wife', 'Everyone', 'be', 'lady', 'so', 'longingly', 'find', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'tried', 'tell', 'truth', 'find', 'truth', 'leave', 'entire', 'town', 'tries', 'keep', 'there', 'out', 'everything', 'life', 'fake', 'forced', 'live', 'out', 'life', 'little', 'bubble', 'world', 'life', 'predetermined', 'TV', 'producer', 'who', 'adopted', 'new', 'born', 'created', 'whole', 'world', 'made', 'grow', 'there', 'really', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'may', 'truly', 'happen.Jim', 'Carrey', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'dramatic', 'comedy', 'showcases', 'sides', 'actor', 'same', 'film', 'film', 'have', 'comedic', 'moments', 'especially', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'dramatic', 'stuff', 'were', 'Carrey', 'truly', 'shines', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'truly', 'award', 'winning', 'performance', 'opinion', 'scene', 'particular', 'really', 'pain', 'struggle', 'character', 'scene', 'be', 'beaten', 'when', 'boat', 'end', 'short', 'scene', 'great', 'excellent', 'range', 'film', 'point', 'career', 'was', 'truly', 'looked', 'as', 'just', 'comedian.Ed', 'Harris', 'always', 'excellent', 'brilliant', 'lead', 'villain', 'role', 'TV', 'producer', 'who', 'nothing', 'ratings', 'will', 'go', 'lengths', 'make', 'show', 'success', 'lengths', 'keep', 'Truman', 'world', 'Harris', 'perfect', 'role', 'even', 'making', 'seem', 'human', 'times', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'wife', 'film', 'great', 'bringing', 'life', 'role', 'were', 'actress', 'love', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'film', 'best', 'friend', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Adam', 'Tomei', 'also', 'are', 'good', 'assistants', 'producer', 'Everyone', 'film', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'actors', 'wonder', 'was', 'hard.Written', 'marvelously', 'Andrew', 'Niccol', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'perfect', 'balance', 'different', 'types', 'films', 'can', 'find', 'moments', 'comedies', 'dramas', 'action', 'suspense', 'even', 'horror', 'be', 'honest', 'one', 'big', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'story', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'straight', 'up', 'comedy', 'complete', 'drama', 'even', 'really', 'darker', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'even', 'same', 'cast', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'happen', 'like', 'film', 'director', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'gave', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'day', 'one', 'Skip', 'rental', 'buy', 'like', 'did', 'think', 'movie', 'goer', 'will', 'appreciate', 'film', 'Also', 'excellent', 'very', 'in-depth', 'scenes', 'feature', 'here']",N/A
453545,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,630518299X,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[7, 7]","The Truman Show is one of those movies which takes an initiative, trying to be different and introspective. It is often labeled as a comedy, but I don't know if there is a real category that defines this film (it is part comedy, part drama, part ""reality"" show). However, I think one of the more important perspectives of this film is simply the morals projected: that free will and creativity make us who we are, that no one has the right to suspend our freedoms, and that diversity and change are natural in life and that attempts to take these away from individuals stifles one's ability to live. Truman has had ideas that everything in life isn't as perfect as it seems, and he is right. When he catches on to these, he truly begins to try to live, and push back the limits that have restrained him. Although the movie takes a very simplistic premise, the idea that Truman Burbank has been pretty much living a television show from birth, it works because its subject creates debate. Far too few films provoke any kind of reaction like this one; people should have an opinion about movies after they view them, and The Truman Show delivers in this perspective.One of the drawbacks is that some of the characters are a little bit too cut and dry. Take Christof, the director of the show, who is presented as an evil egoist who only wants ratings, and will not stop this idea of ""reality TV"" even when Truman is onto this idea. His character was a bit too simplistic. Not everything in this movie works, and sometimes the acting from characters is as phony as the world that Truman lives.It's a thought-provoking film though. It clearly makes one think about the possibilities and power that media sometimes has over individuals. How much do we really want to see and know about someone's life? What is ""crossing the line"" as far as personal space? The paparazzi could take a lesson from viewing this film. This movie was made before reality television really took off, but it really fits into this world because it presents the idea of taking away ""personal space"" and privacy. Truman's momentous life events are all a part of the American home, including the moment he ""lost"" his father, and the moment he regained his father. Many reality shows have individuals ""perform"" each episode and these individuals do this because they choose to. Truman Burbank's character is the very opposite of this spectrum; he doesn't have this choice, and takes measures to break from this.The concept of the movie is unique, and is certainly applicable in today's world.

453546,AP5G5ZVX6BOLU,630518299X,Free Thinker,"[3, 9]","Allow me to start by adding something to the previous review: a comment on the film's last shots. These shots (especially the very last one where 2 viewers wonder 'what else is on') are not just to close the film in a funny note. They're not scenes that the screenwriters just decided to include for fun. Far from that, they are a very bitter and pessimistic closure to the film, a portrayal of the reaction that the viewers (of the movie - not JUST the viewers IN the movie) will unfortunately have: after watching the movie they will just look for something else to 'consume', having missed the point they will casually look for another movie, another of what they just had: another movie to pass time. The majority will find it to be nothing but a movie about a reality tv show.Those scenes are a bitter comment on how most people will just fail to grasp it's real message. And it actually prophesised what followed after the movie came out, which is not a big surprise, really.Some people will actually manage to read between the lines, though. It's the same people that managed to understand the subject of movies like 'The Matrix' (not those who think it's about jesus) and 'Dark City' (not those who think it's about... aliens), the ones that understood what those movies tried to project. To those people all three of these movies talk about the same thing although adopting different storytelling methods to address it.The Truman show is the one that deals with the subject in the most down-to-earth and accesible fashion: by looking more 'realistic'. By looking ordinary compared to the others. And yet it is so more obvious for it. Sadly, most people don't think when they watch movies unless they are told they must do so.What is the common link between 'The Matrix', 'Dark City', and 'The Truman Show'? Could there be more than just that all three were filmed in Australia around the same time? Sadly (or perhaps not) there is absolutely no point in revealing what viewers should discover themselves - it will be no revelation they made themselves, that way - especially considering viewers that have yet to watch the film(s). Those people who watch and don't get the messages, they are simply not able or ready for them, hence those messages have absolutely no value in their present condition.Therefore, the only thing i can do is just give some food for thought and hopefully provide some hints: Could those three movies be talking about the fabric of reality? Could they be talking about control? If so, what is that control expressed by? What is Christof in Truman's 'world' or 'reality'? Could he be God? Is there a pun intended by the choice of his name? What could the Architect be? What could the 'Strangers' symbolize? Is there a similarity between Truman's effort to cross the 'sea' confronting Cristof's will and Ulysses' journey confronting the Gods and more specifically Neptune? Could there be a connection between Truman and Ulysses? Could the sea be symbolizing something? Could there be a conection between that and the sea in 'Dark City'? What is Truman's real home? And where? How is he being kept a prisoner? By what values? Aren't those values... valuable? Could someone be abusing them? How are Anderson (Matrix) and Murdock (Dark City) kept prisoners in their cases? What makes them want to escape? If Truman's name is not an accidental choice then could there be meaning in the names Anderson (hint: no, it does not mean son of man - there is NO greek word analogy there except for those who desperately need to put one there - could it simply mean what it SOUNDS?) and Murdock (hint: who was Marduk and what did he do)?  Could those names be significant in each respective movie? How? Could there be a connection between the viewers in the 'Truman Show', the ones plugged into the matrix and the citizens of 'Dark City? What could be the connection between the methods used in all three cases? Could there be a connection with the viewers/humans/citizens OUTSIDE the films? What are the means by which each 'reality' is maintained?There are so much more (especially if one steps into the metaphysical symbolism in each film) but this is only intented to stir your interest and your thinking process...I hope you have a good and creative time...P.S.: As a final thought... Could there be a connection between this film and 'The Dead Poets Society' that happen to have the same director?

Modern productions seem to always have generous helpings of foul language, sex, vomiting and bathroom scenes, but this film is a notable exception.  Here, the human condition as experienced in the early 21st century is explored in a humorous and satirical way, but with real questions about man's search for meaning, both as an individual and in society in general being explored.  This film uncannily anticipated what so-called ""reality"" television would be like, showing that ""reality"" as perceived by Hollywood, or rather, what Hollywood perceives people thinking reality is, is something out of a nightmare.  Perceptive viewers will note that the ""town"" Truman lives in is very similar in some ways to ""the village"" seen in the classic television series ""The Prisoner"" starring Patrick McGoohan, including people aimlessly riding about on bicycles.  Although everything seems nice and ordered, it is a sterile world filled with artificial emotions and constant surveillance.  Jim Carrey, whom I was not a big fan of before seeing this film puts in a stellar performance, appearing in almost every scene of the film and Ed Harris plays his usual authoritarian-type character in a chilling way.Today, ""freedom"" is defined as ""doing whatever you want"" (e.g. ""if it feels good, do it!""), but the Founding Fathers of the United States regarded it rather as the ability to reach one's maximum potential without artificial, outside constraints, even if this proves to be difficult and uncomfortable (one example being the homesteaders of the 19th century American West who actually often faced great dangers in exercising their freedom).

453555,A1CIW2OEVAJRM2,630518299X,Godly Gadfly,"[15, 18]","The 1998 film The Truman Show (directed by Peter Weir) narrates the life of Truman Banks (Jim Carrey), who is unaware that his entire life on the island of Seahaven is completely constructed by a TV crew, and is part of a constantly running reality television program called The Truman Show, watched by millions 24/7 world-wide.  But when Truman comes to realize that something is strange about his world, he makes plans to escape his artificially manipulated universe.The premise is a clever one, and the film succeeds on the level of story alone.  But what's particularly of interest to this reviewer are the profound philosophical and religious questions that the movie seems to ask.  Not only does it raises age-old philosophical questions common in the field of epistemology, concerning what we can know about reality (e.g. could I be deceived about what my senses and experiences are telling me about reality?), but it also appears to explore many deep religious questions by means of allusions to Christian themes.  Consider how the TV producer Christof (= Christ of) is the ""creator"" of Truman (= True Man), and functions as a god who controls his world.  The symbolism seems too strong to ignore, and as a result, particularly in Christian circles where this imagery cannot go unnoticed, there is considerable debate about the worldview behind the film, and whether it is intended to portray an atheistic or Christian worldview.  Reviewers typically fall into one of two camps:a) those who see it as a secular film, by portraying the Christian God as a cruel and harsh dictator who operates a deterministic universe from which we need to escape by rejecting God.  According to this view, Truman's liberation is a depiction of the Fall, and promotes an atheistic lifestyle of rebellion against the Creator and an escape from Eden.  Others have tried to be more charitable by interpreting it in line with Calvinistic theology, suggesting that the film depicts the tragedy rather than the triumph of sin, but this is implausible in view of how the Creator is portrayed negatively and how the final liberation is presented so positively.b) those who see it as a criticism of secularism, by suggesting that Satan creates an artificial world for us, from which we need to escape by converting to the truth.  According to this view, Truman's liberation promotes the need to escape the deception of Satan (the anti-Christ), and exchange it for a life lived in service to the true God.  Some have even seen it as giving a positive message about Christianity, for if Seahaven represents an illusionary man-made Paradise, then Truman's decision to leave this old world behind is symbolic of a conversion experience, and he represents a Christ-like figure who models the way of salvation.The first view interprets The Truman Show as a story of the Fall, where Christoff symbolizes the true God, and Sylvia (who encourages Truman to escape his ""world"") is a serpent-tempter figure that brings rebellion.  The second view interprets The Truman Show as a story of Redemption, where Christoff symbolizes an anti-Christ, and Sylvia is an intercessor that brings freedom in contrast to the Judas figure Marlon.  Proponents of both views have engaged in considerable debate over these two interpretations, the former which sees the Truman Show as a secular existentialist film, the latter which sees it as a pro-Christian film.Certainly the rich symbolism in the film lends itself to an interpretation which gives the Christological imagery throughout the film a more important meaning than mere allusion.  But neither of the above explanations is entirely satisfactory or consistent.  Because how can Truman be a rebel who rejects God, and at the same time a Christ-like figure (he is depicted as crucified in the boat, and at the end walks on water and ascends into a stairway of heaven)?  And how can Christoff be representative of a deterministic creator, and at the same time an anti-Christ?  A consistent allegorical interpretation fails in its application, and should already be a hint that one is not intended.Perhaps the best solution is one which is neither overly critical nor overly charitable with respect to the Biblical imagery, but sees this as subordinate to other themes about the media and television, without forcing a simplistic choice demanded by a polarized approach.  Director Peter Weir has gone on record in more than one interview that the film is about television.  Weir is of this conviction: ""My attitude to television, personally, is too much of it is a bad thing.""  According to Weir: ""And that's really at the heart of what the film looks at in a major way - this disturbance to our perception of reality, as a result of the immense entertainment and actuality coming at us, to the point where you can't differentiate anymore. News programs that are entertaining; video everywhere."" Given Weir's remarks, I believe that the Truman Show is essentially a sharp criticism of the dangers of a false reality cultivated by the media, and a warning against losing our sense of reality.Clearly Weir has chosen to portray the director Christoff as a creator figure very deliberately, but he does not use this image to push a religious agenda, but to give a social commentary about problems created by the modern media, which blurs the lines between appearance and reality.  In that regard, his analysis of television is spot on and speaks to our time: to what extent is our perception of the world the result of manipulation by the media?  And do we need to be liberated from the artificial reality of a TV world and return to the real world?  I see this explanation (advocated also by Andrew H. Trotter) as more plausible than one which sees the film as a simple spiritual allegory, or which interprets it as an indictment on reality television (note that the release of the movie predates much of the contemporary fascination with reality TV shows).In short, the Truman Show is defending neither an atheist or a Christian worldview, but it merely employs Biblical themes and allusions as servants to its real theme and social commentary about the media and television. It has to be conceded that both Christoff's and Truman's characters have clear Christological symbolism, but the film is ambiguous about which of the two is to be identified as the Christ figure simply because it doesn't want us making a choice between them.  Although the religious symbolism is too strong to ignore, in the end it is subordinate to the more central theme about the role of television and media in our culture, and is a means to an end rather than an end in itself.  Consequently in my view, it's a mistake to see the film either as an attack on Christianity, or as a tool for evangelism.  That's not to say that the film doesn't raise interesting parallels on a religious levels - certainly it can stimulate interesting discussion both about how God the Creator watches over us (cf. Psalm 139), as well as how the Satan the father of lies deceives us.  Ironically, the Truman Show has created its own deception - while appearances suggest it is a spiritual allegory, a closer look suggests that this perception is merely an illusion. - GODLY

I have now watched it for the first time, though I knew of its high reputation. Carrey scared me off for a long time. Had I realized that Ed Harris is the second main actor I might have watched it earlier.This is, of course, not a comedy. One might call it a science fiction film about the media world. A TV producer (Harris) creates a whole artificial world for the benefit of fooling one man, who is filmed from birth to the end (of the film, not his end). He is on screen 24 hours per day for over 10000 days and he doesn't suspect a thing until something starts to feel funny: his dead 'father' suddenly shows up, against the script. A female actor who has left the cast has a heavy flirt with Truman and she is the catalyst of his suspicion. The world wide audience is enraptured by watching the unravelling of the true man's world. Even his escapist adventures turn out in favor of the producer: audiences are glued to the screen.My conclusion: an intriguing idea, good acting performances from more than 2 cast members, but an imperfect implementation. Maybe it can't be otherwise: the idea is so complex that it can not reasonably be expected to come to a flawless implementation.

453567,A19JYLHD94K94D,630518299X,Itamar Katz,"[11, 11]","With its (all intentional of course) cheerfully colorful cinematography, cheesy music and one-dimensional supporting characters, it's easy to miss just how brilliant The Truman Show is; it's in fact one of the most important cinematic creations of the 1990's, at least as important as darker films like American History X and Fight Club, and one that works on several different levels. Because while it works quite clearly as a sarcastic satire and a commentary on the destructive and intrusive nature of the media in the post-modern age, in the light of the reality TV syndrome which was at the time just starting to grow, it's also a philosophical metaphor about the state of mankind.For Truman's story is man's story; and it's difficult not to see the importance in the names given to the lead characters. True Man's life, the film says, is an illusion, a lie. Or perhaps - all our lives are illusions, but the True Man is the one who figures it out and seeks a deeper truth. In its essence the point is very similar to the one The Matrix made; The Truman Show is a fascinating trip through Plato's Cave, and while it takes a rather simplistic look at Plato's philosophy - because any other way would be impossible in a film of less than two hours - it doesn't dumb it down. The Truman Show is a deep and intricate film that deserves repeated viewing and gets better with time, and can be discussed for hours.Writer Andrew Niccol - who made his breakthrough debut one year before with the critically acclaimed cult favorite Gattaca - lost the Oscar that year to the Academy's favorite Shakespeare In Love, and director Peter Weir got most of the credit for the film; but while it's certainly an important achievement for Weir and the best film of his long career, it's Niccol's sarcastic, intelligent, innovative script that made The Truman Show great; that, and the amazing performance by Jim Carrey, who showed his fantastic dramatic skills here for the first time. Carrey is enchanting in the lead role as the ultimate everyman Truman, and we're as fascinated with him as the show's fans in the film. Praise should also go to Ed Harris, who plays Christof, creator and director of The Truman Show (and again, special attention should be given to the character's name) - and also to Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Natasha McElhone, Harry Shearer, Peter Krause, Paul Giamatti and the rest of the wonderful supporting cast, both in Truman's world of Seahavan and in Christof's `real' world. Finally, a word of praise for the excellent musical score, composed by Burkhard von Dallwitz and the great Philip Glass, which compliments the film's atmosphere to perfection.The Truman Show is not an easy movie to absorb; it's a disturbing tale and a disturbing message, which takes some time to seep in, and while it's entirely unconvincing as a reality and even as sci-fi, and feels more like a metaphor than a story of a specific man, it's also entirely involving and demands to be taken at face value. Truman's character is irresistibly charming, and just like the people watching The Truman Show, we believe in him and identify with him completely. The beauty of The Truman Show is that it's lots of fun; it proves that entertainment and art are not necessarily opposing ideals. By being entirely entertaining and gripping, it gets its messages across a whole lot better.The Truman Show is now eight years old: the way I see it, once a decade has passed, a film can begin to be considered a classic. The Truman Show will pass that test. In any possible aspect, The Truman Show is one of the absolute best films of the 90's, and one that will remain relevant long after reality TV has bitten the dust.",5,"Oh, and in case I don't see ya...",1143676800,"03 30, 2006",2006,3698,"['intentional', 'course', 'cheerfully', 'colorful', 'cinematography', 'cheesy', 'music', 'one-dimensional', 'supporting', 'characters', 'easy', 'miss', 'just', 'how', 'brilliant', 'Truman', 'Show', 'fact', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'cinematic', 'creations', '1990', 'least', 'as', 'important', 'darker', 'films', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'Fight', 'Club', 'one', 'several', 'different', 'levels', 'quite', 'clearly', 'sarcastic', 'satire', 'commentary', 'destructive', 'intrusive', 'nature', 'media', 'post-modern', 'age', 'light', 'reality', 'TV', 'syndrome', 'was', 'time', 'just', 'starting', 'grow', 'also', 'philosophical', 'metaphor', 'state', 'mankind.For', 'Truman', 'story', 'man', 'story', 'difficult', 'not', 'see', 'importance', 'names', 'given', 'lead', 'characters', 'True', 'Man', 'life', 'film', 'illusion', 'lie', 'perhaps', 'lives', 'are', 'illusions', 'True', 'Man', 'one', 'who', 'out', 'deeper', 'truth', 'essence', 'point', 'very', 'similar', 'one', 'Matrix', 'made', 'Truman', 'Show', 'fascinating', 'trip', 'Plato', 'Cave', 'rather', 'simplistic', 'look', 'Plato', 'philosophy', 'other', 'way', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'film', 'less', 'two', 'hours', ""n't"", 'dumb', 'down', 'Truman', 'Show', 'deep', 'intricate', 'film', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'better', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'discussed', 'hours.Writer', 'Andrew', 'Niccol', 'who', 'made', 'breakthrough', 'debut', 'one', 'year', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'cult', 'favorite', 'Gattaca', 'lost', 'Oscar', 'year', 'Academy', 'favorite', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'director', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'got', 'most', 'credit', 'film', 'certainly', 'important', 'achievement', 'Weir', 'best', 'film', 'long', 'career', 'Niccol', 'sarcastic', 'intelligent', 'innovative', 'script', 'made', 'Truman', 'Show', 'great', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'who', 'showed', 'fantastic', 'dramatic', 'skills', 'here', 'first', 'time', 'Carrey', 'enchanting', 'lead', 'role', 'ultimate', 'everyman', 'Truman', ""'re"", 'fascinated', 'show', 'fans', 'film', 'Praise', 'should', 'also', 'go', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'Christof', 'creator', 'director', 'Truman', 'Show', 'again', 'special', 'attention', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'character', 'name', 'also', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'Natasha', 'McElhone', 'Harry', 'Shearer', 'Peter', 'Krause', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'rest', 'wonderful', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Truman', 'world', 'Seahavan', 'Christof', 'real', 'world', 'Finally', 'word', 'praise', 'excellent', 'musical', 'score', 'composed', 'Burkhard', 'von', 'Dallwitz', 'great', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'perfection.The', 'Truman', 'Show', 'not', 'easy', 'movie', 'absorb', 'disturbing', 'tale', 'disturbing', 'message', 'time', 'seep', 'entirely', 'unconvincing', 'reality', 'even', 'sci-fi', 'feels', 'more', 'metaphor', 'story', 'specific', 'man', 'also', 'entirely', 'involving', 'demands', 'be', 'taken', 'face', 'value', 'Truman', 'character', 'irresistibly', 'charming', 'just', 'people', 'watching', 'Truman', 'Show', 'believe', 'identify', 'completely', 'beauty', 'Truman', 'Show', 'lots', 'fun', 'entertainment', 'art', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'opposing', 'ideals', 'being', 'entirely', 'entertaining', 'gripping', 'messages', 'whole', 'lot', 'Truman', 'Show', 'now', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'way', 'see', 'once', 'decade', 'passed', 'film', 'can', 'begin', 'be', 'considered', 'classic', 'Truman', 'Show', 'will', 'pass', 'test', 'possible', 'aspect', 'Truman', 'Show', 'one', 'absolute', 'best', 'films', '90', 'one', 'will', 'remain', 'relevant', 'long', 'reality', 'TV', 'bitten', 'dust']",N/A

The premise could easily come across as some  episode off of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, and &quot;everybody&quot;  knows that Jim Carrey in the lead role makes this a comedy. Well, it didn't  turn out that way.Jim Carrey, in this movie, shows (once again) that he  can do some excellent dramatic acting. His character has traces of Jim's  wacko roles from the earlier movies that so many viewers define him by, but  this works. Truman Burbank has been raised in a totally unnatural  environment, and Jim Carrey shows the damage that this has caused in the  character. He is like a bomb which can go off at any second, and which does  go off during the course of the movie.Similarly, the rest of the movie  succeeds by walking just at the edge of ludicrousness. The very careful  handling of the story by director Peter Weir, and the restrained  performance of Ed Harris and the rest of the cast keeps us at the very edge  of our suspension of disbelief.

If there was a show on, where you got to follow a young man growing up, and living his life, there would be a LOT of people watching. Some people WOULD more or less put their lives on hold during significant moments of the show. This is the sheer brilliance of this movie. And rest assured: This movie is excellent.There have been arguments that a show of this kind would not be followed, if it were real life, with audiences being fickle. The thing is that the show changes. Christof (a superb Ed Harris) has thrown in all kinds of things happening to Truman (Will we ever see Jim Carrey better? I don't think I could take that in!), nothing majorly life-altering, but subtle changes, which keeps up the dynamics of the show.And come on! If you don't think that people could get that involved: Just look at stuff like Big Brother. For some reason, people seem to want more. (Hey, they've brought it back four times) People want things that can help them take their mind off things. People WANT to watch ""perfect"" worlds. Otherwise shows like ""Beverly Hills 90210"" and games like ""The Sims"" would not exist. ""The Sims"" is, more or less, your own little Truman Show.As for ""people putting their lives on hold"" to convince Truman that what he sees is real... It's called acting, and I think they would be paid pretty well.All in all: this is what producers of ""reality shows"" do to the participants on a daily basis.

They expected the usual Jim Carrey film with him giving a over the top comedic performance. I still couldn't wait to see it and still found it to be a great movie. I thought Carrey was about as goofy as any of the villians in the  Batman 60's series when he played the Riddler. I always thought he'd be a better actor if he took his medication lol. Here he must've took it since he gives a more laidback and heartfelt performance.He plays a man who was filmed on a set without knowing for his entire life. His whole life was scripted with him not being able to do things that he really wanted to do his entire life. He wants to sail across the ocean. So they had him sail with his tv dad and faked his death so he'd be afraid of the ocean. The girl he really wanted to be with wasn't even allowed to be with him since it wasn't in the script. Since she trys to tell him that his whole life isn't real, she gets rushed off the set never to be allowed on it again. A actress on the show played by Laura Linney gets shoved in his face so much that he eventually marries her.This isn't the usual hyper-active look at me I'm Jim Carrey and I'm funny comedy. The film is funny on it's own without him trying a little too hard to be funny like he usually does. For instance it's funny how everyone advertises products as they're talking to him. Like when he's having a heart-felt conversation with a buddy of his, he'd be advertising the 6 pack they're drinking. Or his wife advertises what they'll be eating.It's a clever comedy with Carrey letting everyone around him act without trying too hard to steal the show from them like he usually does. He gives a smart performance where you can tell he's thinking and knows that everything around him is a little odd. While in other movies he talks so much that you'd think he doesn't even take time to even use his brain lol. When Carrey gives a sensitive performance that actually shows he can act he gets ignored by the Academy and by his fans who just wanna see him go back to talking out his butt. It's sad though because this is a really good performance that he deserved credit for.

Reed,"[0, 0]","You will believe.When I first heard about The Truman Show I was less than enthused with the idea of a tv show documenting the entire life of an individual.  Particularly with everything about that individual's life  being staged or simulated.  Like most garbage coming out of Hollywood it  was entirely too fake.What I viewed however was a film with so much  humanity and lack thereof that it's hard not to get drawn in to the reality  of Truman's all too simulated world.To me the major question that the  film raises is what kind of society would not just tolerate but condone  this type of undertaking.  And perhaps an even bigger question is how  plausible is it that our present society would react just like the  characters in the movie.  The answer may be very disconcerting.  Or how  about the ethical lack of privacy issue and the audacity of any individual  to invade another's privacy in such a manner.  Or the low morals  particularly of Laura Linney's character who can at best be described as a  prostitute.Forget about the legalities of such an undertaking, the film  (in my mind) raises the morality question of playing God and the lack of  morality of the viewing public.  Only 1 character in the whole film even  remotely thinks of Truman as a real person and not an object of amusement  or a creation.  He merely exists for their own pleasure or sympathy.Yet  Truman, despite all that is stacked against him endeavors to break free and  know the truth.  One man... following his own voice despite all the signs  to the contrary.  To me that's powerful stuff.Jim Carey is phenomenal.  It's too early to tell but he may be that rarest of individual who can be  great at both comedy and drama.You will FEEL for Truman.

His entire life, from birth, has been televised live for over thirty years. He lives in a small island community that is actually a giant stage established for his benefit by the show's creator, Christof. Truman has never known he is the subject of a show, he is not an actor, just an insurance salesman living his life. Every person he knows, on the other hand, is an actor and acting out a script. His mother, best friend, wife, co-workers, all of them are there for the show and nothing else. The problem is that Truman is getting island fever and wants to leave. He also begins to suspect that something is wrong and that things in his life are fake somehow. His ""loved ones"" try to reassure him, but he's determined to keep pushing.The Truman Show challenged a lot of viewers in 1998 because Jim Carrey's presence seemed to promise a comedy similar to his most recent hit at the time,Liar Liar (Collector's Edition). This is not a comedy, however, but a drama with a bit of humor to break the tension. If you can get over waiting for Carrey to really busy out the zaniness, then you'll appreciate both the movie and what may be the finest performance of his career. The humor is still there occasionally, but so is a vulnerability that he has rarely exhibited. The supporting cast also turned in strong performances, led by Ed Harris as the tyrannical Christof who regards Truman as his personal property. Noah Emmerich, as best friend Marlon, is also noteworthy as the warm-hearted best friend who isn't what he seems.The Truman Show is not like any movie made before or since, and that alone makes it noteworthy. It was far ahead of its time in portraying the phenomenon now known as reality TV before even the first season of Survivor was a hit. It has a few funny moments, but mostly this is a story of a man who hungers for more in his life and feels trapped at every turn. It's Truman against the entire world he's trapped in and who among us has never felt a touch of that?",5,How will it end?,1199577600,"01 6, 2008",2008,2081,"['Truman', 'Burbank', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'star', 'most', 'elaborate', 'reality', 'television', 'show', 'possible', 'entire', 'life', 'birth', 'been', 'televised', 'live', 'thirty', 'years', 'small', 'island', 'community', 'actually', 'giant', 'stage', 'established', 'benefit', 'show', 'creator', 'Christof', 'Truman', 'never', 'known', 'subject', 'show', 'not', 'actor', 'just', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'living', 'life', 'person', 'other', 'hand', 'actor', 'acting', 'out', 'script', 'mother', 'best', 'friend', 'wife', 'co-workers', 'are', 'there', 'show', 'nothing', 'else', 'problem', 'Truman', 'getting', 'island', 'fever', 'leave', 'also', 'suspect', 'something', 'wrong', 'things', 'life', 'are', 'fake', 'somehow', 'loved', 'ones', 'try', 'reassure', 'determined', 'keep', 'pushing.The', 'Truman', 'Show', 'challenged', 'lot', 'viewers', '1998', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'presence', 'seemed', 'promise', 'comedy', 'similar', 'most', 'recent', 'hit', 'time', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'not', 'comedy', 'however', 'drama', 'bit', 'humor', 'break', 'tension', 'can', 'get', 'over', 'waiting', 'Carrey', 'really', 'busy', 'out', 'zaniness', 'then', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'movie', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'finest', 'performance', 'career', 'humor', 'still', 'occasionally', 'so', 'vulnerability', 'rarely', 'exhibited', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'turned', 'strong', 'performances', 'led', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'tyrannical', 'Christof', 'who', 'regards', 'Truman', 'personal', 'property', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'best', 'friend', 'Marlon', 'also', 'noteworthy', 'warm-hearted', 'best', 'friend', 'who', ""n't"", 'what', 'seems.The', 'Truman', 'Show', 'not', 'movie', 'made', 'alone', 'noteworthy', 'was', 'far', 'ahead', 'time', 'portraying', 'phenomenon', 'now', 'known', 'reality', 'TV', 'even', 'first', 'season', 'Survivor', 'was', 'hit', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'mostly', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'more', 'life', 'feels', 'trapped', 'turn', 'Truman', 'entire', 'world', 'trapped', 'who', 'never', 'felt', 'touch']",N/A

Clarity highlights would include - - Noah Emmerich's sea of freckles as he's interviewed in the opening credits - he plays Marlon who is supposedly Truman's best friend - always turning up with a ""Brewsky"" whenever there's a problem (they actually cake and paste Noah's face with make up to cover up his freckles in later shots). There are the pearls on Sylvia's wrist in the library when Truman and her finally talk, the ""How Does It All End?"" button on her cardigan - stunning clarity. There's Truman digging the garden in his horrible orange pants as his wife stops on her bicycle for a little product-placement (played superbly by Laura Linney)...""Look Truman! Chef's Pal! It's a Grater, Dicer and Peeler all in one!""""Wow!""You also notice the actors who went on to be huge stars, Paul Giamatti as Christof's technical sidekick, Peter Krause from Six Feet Under and Dirty Sexy Money as one of the suits in Truman's office and of course the ethereal beauty of Natasha McElhone who has eyes clinically proven to be deeper than the Pacific Ocean.Harry Shearer is in there too doing a fantastic turn as the appeasing interviewer Mike Michaelson. There's the crass reintroduction of Truman's dead father, which is being choreographed live by manipulative experts in the overhanging control room (quote above). But the trump card is the last minute cast appointment of Ed Harris as the show's all-powerful creator - the aptly named Christof. Harris is simply magnificent (nominated for an Oscar) all serene and quietly spoken one moment - but dictatorial the next when his little money-making baby and power trip start to get challenged by an unexpectedly spunky Truman - a man Christof's personally trained to be scared of certain things so he won't ever leave Seahaven...The two extras are the same as the Special Edition DVD - so a little disappointing there. But that's minor compared to how good the whole film looks on BLU RAY and especially how amazingly well it still stands up - a modern day masterpiece. And the scenes where Truman stops the bus in defiance and where he battles the storm on his boat trying to break free brought tears to my eyes - fabulous stuff.""You can't get any away further away before you start coming back..."" Truman says to Marlon about Fiji where his longed-for love Sylvia is.It's slightly disconcerting to find a movie character spouting such wisdom, because in 2009, our entire world feels like one big screwed up reality show that can only end badly...What a film! And a triumph on Blu Ray - Recommended.",5,"""...Easy On The Fog...Button Cam Three...Fade Up Music...""",1245888000,"06 25, 2009",2009,3471,"['***', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'IS', 'FOR', 'THE', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'VERSION', 'THE', 'FILM***Watching', 'Peter', 'Weir', '1998', 'film', '2009', 'weird', 'wonderful', 'trip', 'not', 'slightly', 'disconcerting', 'one', 'times.First', 'masterful', 'brilliant', 'remember', 'very', 'clever', 'unfolding', 'story', 'man', 'life', 'permanent', 'Candid', 'Camera', 'entire', 'planet', 'living', 'artificially', 'created', 'world', 'literally', 'everyone', 'being', 'actor', 'Then', 'stunning', 'believable', 'performances', 'perfectly', 'picked', 'cast', 'Carey', 'Linney', 'Harris', 'shine', 'second', 'appalling', 'Big', 'Brother', 'polluting', 'airwaves', 'night', 'night', 'Truman', 'Show', 'not', 'just', 'relevant', 'eleven', 'years', 'later', 'have', 'actually', 'predicted', 'television', 'future', 'back', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'first', 'thing', 'notice', 'picture', 'mixture', 'beautiful', 'clarity', 'one', 'moment', 'running', 'alongside', 'very', 'steady', 'DVD', 'quality', 'next', 'Clarity', 'highlights', 'would', 'include', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'sea', 'freckles', 'interviewed', 'opening', 'Marlon', 'who', 'supposedly', 'Truman', 'best', 'friend', 'always', 'turning', 'up', 'Brewsky', 'whenever', 'problem', 'actually', 'cake', 'paste', 'Noah', 'face', 'make', 'up', 'cover', 'up', 'freckles', 'later', 'shots', 'are', 'pearls', 'Sylvia', 'wrist', 'library', 'when', 'Truman', 'finally', 'talk', 'How', 'End', 'button', 'cardigan', 'stunning', 'clarity', 'Truman', 'digging', 'garden', 'horrible', 'orange', 'pants', 'wife', 'stops', 'bicycle', 'little', 'product-placement', 'played', 'superbly', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Look', 'Truman', 'Chef', 'Pal', 'Grater', 'Dicer', 'Peeler', 'one', 'Wow', 'also', 'notice', 'actors', 'who', 'went', 'be', 'huge', 'stars', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Christof', 'technical', 'sidekick', 'Peter', 'Krause', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Dirty', 'Sexy', 'Money', 'one', 'suits', 'Truman', 'office', 'course', 'ethereal', 'beauty', 'Natasha', 'McElhone', 'who', 'eyes', 'clinically', 'proven', 'be', 'deeper', 'Pacific', 'Ocean.Harry', 'Shearer', 'there', 'too', 'doing', 'fantastic', 'turn', 'appeasing', 'interviewer', 'Mike', 'Michaelson', 'crass', 'reintroduction', 'Truman', 'dead', 'father', 'being', 'choreographed', 'live', 'manipulative', 'experts', 'overhanging', 'control', 'room', 'quote', 'trump', 'card', 'last', 'minute', 'cast', 'appointment', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'show', 'all-powerful', 'creator', 'aptly', 'named', 'Christof', 'Harris', 'simply', 'magnificent', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'serene', 'quietly', 'spoken', 'one', 'moment', 'dictatorial', 'next', 'when', 'little', 'money-making', 'baby', 'power', 'trip', 'start', 'get', 'challenged', 'unexpectedly', 'spunky', 'Truman', 'man', 'Christof', 'personally', 'trained', 'be', 'scared', 'certain', 'things', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'leave', 'Seahaven', 'two', 'extras', 'are', 'same', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'so', 'little', 'disappointing', 'there', 'minor', 'compared', 'how', 'good', 'whole', 'film', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'especially', 'how', 'amazingly', 'well', 'still', 'up', 'modern', 'day', 'masterpiece', 'scenes', 'where', 'Truman', 'bus', 'defiance', 'where', 'storm', 'boat', 'trying', 'break', 'free', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'fabulous', 'stuff', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'away', 'further', 'away', 'start', 'coming', 'back', 'Truman', 'Marlon', 'Fiji', 'where', 'longed-for', 'love', 'Sylvia', 'is.It', 'slightly', 'disconcerting', 'find', 'movie', 'character', 'spouting', 'such', 'wisdom', '2009', 'entire', 'world', 'feels', 'one', 'big', 'screwed', 'up', 'reality', 'show', 'can', 'only', 'end', 'badly', 'What', 'film', 'triumph', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Recommended']",N/A

453607,A152C8GYY25HAH,630518299X,Matthew Horner,"[2, 2]","There were rumbling at Paramount Studios in the weeks before the release of The Truman Show. Word was that they knew they had one of the best movies of the year, but feared they had not come up with the right promotional campaign. When I heard this news, I crossed my eyes. How often have we heard that before?After seeing it, I admitted that they were right to worry. Truman Burbank is no ordinary hero, and the picture is even more extraordinary. It is enormously entertaining and strikingly insightful, but it belongs to no known genre.As a society, we have a compulsion to pigeonhole everything. The Truman Show has been labeled a comedy, a drama and a combination of both. I think it has elements of the best science fiction, which is a story that has never happened, but which conceivably could. Call it what you will. This movie is easily one of the Ten Best Films of 1998. I wouldn't be surprised if it won Best Picture at the Oscars.Suppose a television producer were able to create a TV show in which the life of a person was recorded from his birth on. This is the fate of Truman Burbank, brilliant played by Jim Carrey. I've never been caught up in Carrey Mania, but I've usually enjoyed him. My reservation about him has been that, while he is above average in talent, he's previously seemed to play his characters as impersonations of them. The Truman Show is all the proof I need that he can be a true actor. I found myself believing in Truman, not in Jim Carrey as Truman, and that's a tribute to the actor.We are introduced to Truman at the point where the show, now in its 30th year, is starting to unravel. The subject of this massive TV show, which runs 24 hours a day, lives in the world's largest set, a domed structure that must be five miles across. During the opening credits, we are given a quick history of the show. After that, the first scene shows one of the set's five thousand cameras crashing to the ground. It lands just a few feet from the startled Truman. I think he has known for a long time that his world is somehow wrong. Every attempt to leave, for example, has been thwarted. The shattered camera is the first piece of concrete evidence. Since all the other people in town, including his wife and his friends, are actors, there is not much they can do to help him. This behavior merely reinforces his suspicions.I don't think I have ever seen a film this short cover so many issues coherently or operate smoothly on so many levels. You can be merely entertained by it, or you can think about the issues it raises, concerning everything from a society that has become totally voyeuristic to the blurring of what is real to the results of our feeble attempts to play God. If you dare, you might consider the notion that, as a group, we are in danger of entertaining ourselves to death.Don't let the above paragraph put you off. The real magic of The Truman Show is its ability to gratify viewers no matter what level they approach it from..",5,On my top Ten of 1998,1017187200,"03 27, 2002",2002,2980,"['were', 'rumbling', 'Paramount', 'Studios', 'weeks', 'release', 'Truman', 'Show', 'Word', 'was', 'knew', 'had', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'year', 'feared', 'had', 'not', 'come', 'up', 'right', 'promotional', 'campaign', 'When', 'heard', 'news', 'crossed', 'eyes', 'How', 'often', 'have', 'heard', 'seeing', 'admitted', 'were', 'right', 'worry', 'Truman', 'Burbank', 'ordinary', 'hero', 'picture', 'even', 'more', 'extraordinary', 'enormously', 'entertaining', 'strikingly', 'insightful', 'known', 'genre.As', 'society', 'have', 'compulsion', 'pigeonhole', 'everything', 'Truman', 'Show', 'been', 'labeled', 'comedy', 'drama', 'combination', 'think', 'elements', 'best', 'science', 'fiction', 'story', 'never', 'happened', 'conceivably', 'could', 'Call', 'what', 'will', 'movie', 'easily', 'one', 'Ten', 'Best', 'Films', '1998', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscars.Suppose', 'television', 'producer', 'were', 'able', 'create', 'TV', 'show', 'life', 'person', 'was', 'recorded', 'birth', 'fate', 'Truman', 'Burbank', 'brilliant', 'played', 'Jim', 'Carrey', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'caught', 'up', 'Carrey', 'Mania', ""'ve"", 'usually', 'enjoyed', 'reservation', 'been', 'above', 'average', 'talent', 'previously', 'seemed', 'play', 'characters', 'impersonations', 'Truman', 'Show', 'proof', 'need', 'can', 'be', 'true', 'actor', 'found', 'believing', 'Truman', 'not', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Truman', 'tribute', 'actor.We', 'are', 'introduced', 'Truman', 'point', 'where', 'show', 'now', '30th', 'year', 'starting', 'unravel', 'subject', 'massive', 'TV', 'show', '24', 'hours', 'day', 'world', 'largest', 'set', 'domed', 'structure', 'must', 'be', 'five', 'miles', 'across', 'opening', 'credits', 'are', 'given', 'quick', 'history', 'show', 'first', 'scene', 'one', 'set', 'five', 'thousand', 'cameras', 'crashing', 'ground', 'just', 'few', 'feet', 'startled', 'Truman', 'think', 'known', 'long', 'time', 'world', 'somehow', 'wrong', 'attempt', 'leave', 'example', 'been', 'thwarted', 'shattered', 'camera', 'first', 'piece', 'concrete', 'evidence', 'other', 'people', 'town', 'including', 'wife', 'friends', 'are', 'actors', 'not', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'help', 'behavior', 'merely', 'suspicions.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'short', 'cover', 'so', 'many', 'issues', 'coherently', 'operate', 'smoothly', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'can', 'be', 'merely', 'entertained', 'can', 'think', 'issues', 'concerning', 'everything', 'society', 'become', 'totally', 'voyeuristic', 'blurring', 'what', 'real', 'results', 'feeble', 'attempts', 'play', 'God', 'dare', 'might', 'consider', 'notion', 'group', 'are', 'danger', 'entertaining', 'death.Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'above', 'paragraph', 'put', 'off', 'real', 'magic', 'Truman', 'Show', 'ability', 'gratify', 'viewers', 'matter', 'what', 'approach', 'from..']",N/A

453614,AMG2LF8MLUDN1,630518299X,M. Fields,"[3, 3]","Beware of spoilers here:This film is totally enjoyable.  Once again Carrey shows that he is capable of serious acting and not just the goofy stuff.  He really is a wonderful talent and I still continue to wonder why he did so many of those toilet humor movies.The premise of the film is fresh and entertaining.  In these days of reality television can a show like this be too far off in the distance?  I think not.  Here's the premise.  Carrey plays a poor unsuspecting soul named Truman.  He was an orphan who was sort of adopted by a televison show producer.  His whole world is fake.  His parents, his wife, best friend, neighborhood, job, etcetera.  The weather, the sun, wind, rain.  All fake.  Everyone in his world is an actor.  Even his town was a set.  Cameras were hidden everywhere.  The whole world watched Truman as he grew up.  His first steps, his first day at school.  Everything.  Can't you just hear Hollywood's wheels turning as they try to figure out a way to make this happen one day?The Truman show is such a hit that people in the real world have trouble functioning and living their own lives because they can't stop watching it.  It's on 24 hours a day.  There's the premise for reality t.v. Are we really so bored with our own lives that we have to tune in to watch what's going on in someone else's family?Truman starts to notice little strange things around him.  A light seemingly falls from the sky as he's on his way to work.  The radio announces that it fell from a plane but we know that it was one of the studio lights.  He also pines away for a girl that he never really had a chance to have a relationship with because the network already had a wife planned for him.  They can control his world but they can't remove his memories.  He also he a desire to travel but he lives on an island (or so it seemed to him) but he has a paralyzing fear of water because he saw his father drown in a storm at sea.  Actually, the father was fired (from the show) and the station decided to kill him off.  The man who played his father slips back on to the set one day and Truman sees him before the actors who play security guards and cops hustle him off the set.  Things start to fall apart for the show after that.Laura Linney plays Truman's make believe wife.  She plays his wife strictly for the cash and fame.  Ed Harris is excellent as the producer/director of the Truman Show.  He feels like he is Truman's real father since he's the one that's been taking care of him all of his life.Things finally come to a head and Truman has sort of a showdown with his creator.  I won't say what happens but when the transmission of the Truman Show is cut, what do the folks that have been watching faithfully for years do?  Turn the channel to see what else is on.This film raises some interesting questions.  Should we make a person's life a subject for our own entertainment?  Can we really be so disinterested with our own lives that viewing someone else's  life fulfills us?  Just how far will the entertainment industry go to make a buck?To those of you who are not Jim Carrey fans, I urge you to give The Truman show a try.

453617,A3TA89BA53WOE6,630518299X,Michael A. Garcia,"[4, 4]","The Truman Show, though funny at points, deals with a serious theme. Like Plato's Allegory of the Cave, this film deals with a similar situation with a modern twist. The film is the epitome of America's obsession with reality television. The film was released when shows like Survivor and Trading Spaces were conquering the airwaves. How far could reality T.V. actually get? The Truman Show, undoubtedly, would be the result.The film deals with Truman, a man that was abandoned at birth and was adopted by a television corporation. His life was turned into a TV show as he grew up in an artificial town known as Seahaven. Its creator is Christof, who oversees the day to day pseudo-reality of Truman's life. In many ways, he represents the ultimate modern man. He calls himself ""the creator,"" but unlike God, his creation is all artificial. The entire TV show revolves around Truman, and the only way to make this possible is to have absolute control of Truman's surroundings. This not only includes the town in which he lives, but the people he comes in contact with, and even the weather itself is manipulated to fit the desires of the shows producers, depending on the mood they want to set for a specific episode.The cost to obtain high ratings comes at a heavy price - Truman's freedom. From the moment of his birth, his future was already decided for him. Everything from his job, his wife, and even his father's death, was all scripted. He doesn't even have the freedom to be with the one he loves most. In the film, he falls in love with Sylvia, who at the time was playing her role as Lauren. As time passes, he tries to seek her out, and when he finally does, they meet secretly in a beach where Sylvia tries to tell Truman that his life is a T.V. show, but before the message was able to sink in, Sylvia was taken by another cast member to keep her from revealing the truth. Off the show, Sylvia continues to fight the producers of the show by making phone calls, persuading them of the immoral and dehumanizing effects of the show. Truman's longing for Sylvia was his ticket to freedom. During the course of time, since his separation from Sylvia, Truman begins to piece together cut-outs of magazines by taking eyes, mouths, noses, ears and hair from different models to create the image of Sylvia's face. Explicitly, this image represents his longing and love for Sylvia. Implicitly, however, the face he created is the face of freedom. In a sense, Sylvia, for Truman, becomes Lady Liberty. Like immigrants arriving on Ellis Island, the first face Truman would see once he is free from his bondage would be the face of his Lady Liberty, Sylvia, who at the end of film rushes to greet him into the real world.Truman's main journey in the film is the discovery of truth. Similar to Plato's Allegory of the Cave, Truman must search beyond his surroundings and day to day routines to discover the true nature of his identity. These people and surroundings he comes in contact with constitute his own shadows. These shadows are his world of ""ordinary things"" (Plato's term for the lesser physical world), but if he is to discover the truth of the real world (""world of forms""), he must step beyond his own cave and into the natural light.It is man's curious nature which leads him to wonderment. One of my favorite moments in the movie is when Truman asks Christof: ""Was nothing real?"" Christof tells Truman: ""You were real."" Truman was the only one in Seahaven who was authentic. This, thus, brings us to the notion of authenticity and inauthenticity. In many ways, Christof was right - Truman was the only real person. Even Christof himself was not living an authentic life. He had fooled himself into thinking that he was some type of god who can control people's lives. Truman desires freedom so much that he yells out at Christof: ""If you want to stop me, you'll have to kill me!"" As Truman fights for his life. amidst the raging storm, an employee implores Christof to cease the storm. He tells him, ""You're going to kill him in front of a live audience!"" To this Christof indifferently responds, ""He was born before a live audience."" Christof has played the role of God so long that he lost his own authentic identity and created for himself an artificial one.Another similar and interesting character is Meryl, the actress that plays Truman's wife. Not only is she a puppet of Christof, but she sells her body for higher ratings.  She tries to persuade Truman to have a child with her, which would undoubtedly have the same fate as his father (not to mention safeguarding the show's longevity). There's no doubt that Meryl would have received a great bonus if she were able to conceive a child on live television. The moral applications to this would be absurd. The meaning of sex would be reduced for the sake of higher ratings. In many ways, this could be considered a form of human trafficking. When Truman refuses to have a child, and Meryl leaves the show, the producers are forced to hire a new actress to play the role of Truman's love interest. It's as though they were hiring a prostitute with an acting degree. All this trouble for the sake of becoming the first television show to feature the very first live conception.At the movies end, Christof, in an attempt to persuade Truman to stay, tells him that the world ""out there"" is the sick world. He tells him that by staying here in this artificial world he can provide safety. Ultimately, however, Christof cannot control human freedom. He may have seemed omniscient by having cameras all over his artificial world, but as Truman so emotionally put it: ""You've never had a camera inside my head."" Truman's desire to be free and authentic leads him to say those famous words he often repeated one last time, officiating the end to his inauthentic career: ""In case I don't see you, good morning, good afternoon, good evening and good night.""",5,The Truman Show: Fully Reviewed,1264723200,"01 29, 2010",2010,5919,"['Truman', 'Show', 'funny', 'points', 'deals', 'serious', 'theme', 'Plato',

Wanting to give the audience the ultimate experience of a person's life, but not through the eyes of an actor, Omnicam Corporation adopted a young baby, named him Truman burban, and set him up in a spectacular city encased in a huge dome.  Everything is controlled, form outsiders trying to break into the set, to how Truman is interpreted by his family and friends.Now, it is some 30 years later, and Truman Burbank is married to the supposed woman of his dreams, is working as an insurance salesman, and everything seems to be going fine: until one day, when a strange object falls from the sky (an optical light, with the label of a major star form the night sky).  As the days go on, Truman encounters more strange and bizarre happenings: a man looking like his father appears, an elevator ina  building seems to just be part of an enclosed set, and a thunderstorm seems only to rain down on HIM!  Pretty soon, Truman is enraptured with the spirit to try and leave the city, of Sea Haven, which he finds that he almost cannot do.  All of these attempts are foiled by the Truman Show mastermind Christof(recipient of multiple emmy awards, as seen on a mantle near the door).  Chritsof has a complex of control over Truman, and tries everything to make sure that he never leaves.Jim Carrey is the major standout in this film.  He's not an actor, he actually acts like a man unsuspecting of his surroundings (the closest to a down to earth person Carrey had played befor was Stanley Ipkiss in &quot;The Mask&quot;).

I felt disappointed by its imperfection.  Until I saw the film again recently, that is, clear of the hype.  My reaction to it was much different this time.  It's a very good -- thought not great -- film.The major problem I have with ""The Truman Show"" is that it gives up its secret too early.  A much more suspenseful movie could have been made if the audience, along with the protagonist, were kept in the dark longer.  The sense of discovery these two entities could have shared would be staggering, the ultimate revelation of the man behind the curtain.  I understand why the movie didn't go this way.  I understand why director Peter Weir, a sensible sort, didn't want his movie to be about a gimmick (oh what a gimmick it would have been!).  He was aiming for a bigger metaphor, and I think he hit it just perfectly.The town/studio that the filmmakers have created is a wonder to behold.  Self-contained, it's designed to both steer Truman along his daily path, so that the camera can catch the product placements which are the sole source of the show's revenue, and to psychologically torment him, so that he'll never ever think of leaving.  It's a town filled with little flourishes that only the discerning viewer will catch.  Did you notice that the garbage can his neighbour is always carrying has an eyehole?  It's just one touch, unexplained throughout that film's first half that contributed to the flawless tapestry of the town.The film is structured wonderfully.  Except for an expository prologue (which cheekily replaces the film's credits with what appears to be the TV-show-within-the-film's credits), the audience is allowed to slowly follow Truman's discovery that the world he thought was real is not all it appears to be.  A studio light falls from the sky; confusing, until a radio report later that day reveals that an airplane inexplicably dropped some equipment.  Truman's long lost father, dressed in ratty clothing, attempts to make contact with him; later, a newspaper headline bemoans town's homeless problem.  Most effectively, Truman longs to be reunited with the true love of his life in a way that's at first hinted at, then, in a stunning revelatory moment, becomes bold and emotional.With all this good stuff to behold, this is one of the few times when a film's running time feels too short.  ""The Truman Show"", possibly because it is ostensibly a movie about a popular TV show, sells itself short.  It needn't have wrapped itself up too quickly.  I could have stood another thirty or forty minutes tacked on to its already hundred minute running time, the better to enjoy the richness of the world that has been created, to more effectively delve into the past that has come to inform the present story, and to allow the fine cast to further explore and flesh-out the characters they've been given.Jim Carrey got a lot of credit for taking a role that would seem to be miles away from manic buffoon he usually plays.  Well, that assessment is only half right.  For most of the film's first half, Truman is a boisterous fellow, amiable and friendly to all.  He isn't yet suspicious that something is amiss, and thus he gives as much joy as he gets.  The joy he gets doesn't come from real people, though.  It comes from actors.  Truman, a grotesque anthropological experiment, has never encountered sincerity.  The insipid greeting he repeats every morning (""Good morning... and if I don't see you later, good afternoon, good evening, and good night"") is little more than a catchphrase, delivered with a full fake smile and a mock-warm head tilt.  These scenes have Carrey smack dab in his element, playing over the top and phony.  But there's a purpose to his phoniness; it contrasts with the realization that Truman has to make in the film's second half, and the change that Carrey has to enact to go along with it.  He becomes a quieter man, in moments.  And when his mania bursts out, it comes in the form of a cunning schemer, intent on breaking down the walls that he just discovered are fencing him in.  Carrey pulls off both of these sides of Truman very well, and although you can sometimes see though the seams and tell he's Oscar-fishing, it never detracts from the performance.As for the grand metaphor that Weir, in conjunction with screenwriter Andrew Niccol, is looking for, well, it's certainly not an attack on the reality TV craze.  That's a not-so-sacred cow that gets tagged in the crossfire, but certainly not the target the film is aiming at.  It's really trying to make a point about loneliness.  More specifically, the loneliness of the authentic man.  In a world ravaged by greed and self-preservation, Truman is the only sincere person, and it's slowly eating him up inside.  He thinks he lives in a town that's friendly and caring.  He doesn't know that they're all paid to be there, and that he has no real friends or real family to call his own.  His final choice, whether to stay in his comfortable yet hollow existence or forage forth into the great unknown, is a moment played with suspense and, ultimately, grace.  Should he stay or should he go?  That's the moral issue the film lays at the audience's feet.  And as it keeps reminding us, the most important question, the one that none of us ever find the answer to in our real lives, is this: How is it all going to end?",4,"One For All, All For One: Weir

453623,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,630518299X,Mitch Weaver,"[4, 4]","Truman Burbank ( Jim Carrey) is a television star and he doesn't even know it. When he was a only a baby, he was adopted by a man named Cristof (Ed Harris). Cristof came up with the idea of the Truman Show. The show revolves solely around Truman himself, and the life that he leads. The city that he lives in is constructed specifically for the show, and everone in it is an actor playing a part. Even his wife ( Laura Linney), and best friend Marlon (Noah Emmerich). The world has been watching Truman since he was a baby, and it is the number one rated show in the country. But gradually Truman starts to realize what is going on...I am a huge fan of Jim Carrey. All of his movies have been entertaining from &quot;The Mask&quot; and &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;, to his latest film &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot;. However, the film that I enjoyed him the most in, concentrated less on the typical slapstick comedy that one has come to expect from a Jim Carrey film, and more on making you laugh through emotion and subtlety. The story itself is highly original and entertaining. The idea of one man being oblivious to the world aroud him is extremely funny. The fact that he is the center of a TV show only makes it funnier. All of the actors do an outstanding job. Of course Carrey steals the show with Truman. The transition from being naive, to a determined man is amazing. He plays both sides so well. Laura Linney is outstanding as his wife. She must put on the happy homemaker facade and pretend to love Truman. The funniest thing about the character is how she must constantly advertise products with everything that she does. Noah Emmerich is great as his best friend Marlon. Watching him try to convince Truman that it is just his mind playing tricks on him is hillarious. Even when a stage light falls from the sky, or it is sunny at 9:00 p.m., him and the rest of the actors try to convince Truman he is seeing things. Ed Harris does a nice job with Cristof considering the limited amount of screen time he had. It is also dissapointing as well. For such an important character, he has very little to do with the overall story. The rest of the actors in the film also do a great job as well.&quot;The Truman Show&quot; will make you laugh, and keep you on the edge of your seat, wondering if Truman will ever get out. The ending is very satisfying too. This is definately Carrey's best film. He and the rest of the cast does an amazing job, and really makes the film believeable. The DVD is somewhat dissapointing though. I would have loved to seen a making of featurette. Unfortunately, there is just the movie and the trailer. I have never been able to understand why movie studios feel that offering a trailer as a special feature is an added bonus. If you are going to watch the film, then why would you need to see a movie trailer?

You'd barely associate the man you see on your screen with the likes of Ace Ventura, Lloyd Christmas, or Stanley Ipkiss.  Truman Burbank is sweet, charming, certainly naive, and unknowingly the world's biggest television star.  This is one of those movie premises that you don't think will work, but it works in this film.  The way this world was built around our leading man to keep him in the dark is conceivably possible, though one has to wonder how the guys behind all this got the money to create this world...it had to cost a few million, or even billion, dollars.  I also thought the casting of Ed Harris as the head producer was a bit odd as it seemed to be a subdued role for him...I'm just used to seeing him in roles where he is able to let the whole room, and the audience, know that he is present and is to be respected accordingly.  To get my point (hopefully I'm making one), watch Con Air.  But Mr. Harris actually did well, even though I wanted him to be more in-everyone's-faces as in his other movies.  But he didn't do badly.  Overall, I liked this film and I'd watch again somewhere down the road.  One nice thing that this movie doesn't do is give a predictably ending right from the first minute...you really can't figure out anything about the ending, so there is a sense of suspense, eve if there's not supposed to be.  It's a good film and actually allows Jim Carrey to show some range in his acting ability...some range...there are still a few, probably unintentional, callbacks to the movies that made him a household name.

Truman Burkbank is the main character played by Jim Carrey in this, his most memorable role besides the Mask. Jim won the Golden Globe for Best Actor but was never nominated for an Oscar for this ground breaking role. What a shame because he is Truman and Truman is him. The sign of great acting is when you really, really care about the character.This is a film with many layers. The casual viewer will enjoy it for its oddball humour and quirky characters. At a deeper level there are parallels for how we as human beings live our lives. There is a innate hunger for feeling alive. Joseph Campbell said that we're mistaken when we think we are searching for meaning. Meaning is your head, its intellectual, but feeling is the whole body. And Truman through his escapades is searching for that feeling of being alive. And there is a girl that was removed from the Truman Show in his youth that drives his magnificent obsession. He gets thwarted by the omniscient Christoff, brilliantly played by Ed Harris, the creator of the Truman Show. And this eventually leads to a face-off which is one of the most spiritual moments ever recorded in cinematic history.

I had a chance to see it last night with my 12 year old son and I enjoyed it again.  It has the rare quality of being a movie that can be enjoyed by people of different generations.  If you don't know the story, that's all the better.  The movie does an excellent job of filling us in on what's what.  We get a lot of the basics during the opening credits, see some of the ""show"" and get more helpful information as we go along.  The many role players that we see on the screen reinforce the idea that we, too, are now watching the same Truman Show that they are seeing.  We come on board at the time that Truman finally starts to figure out that things aren't what they seem to be.The way the movie lets us see the ""acting"" in the actors, the coordination of the technical staff, the quick reactions to unforseen changes in Truman's behavior all help to make the movie that much more enjoyable.  It also gives us a sense of the shallowness of the program itself.  That point was amplified when we get to meet The Truman Show's creator played by Ed Harris.  Certainly a large element of this movie is a poke at the nature of television; what we like to watch and why.  By corrupting the old adage ""truth is stranger than fiction"" we are led to understand that the human interest shows on TV merely take time away from living our own lives.  What is really strange is how television on so many channels these days seems to sense that ""The Truman Show"" was a harbinger rather than a satire.  We now find out way more that we should need to know about people who voluntarily place themselves in positions that require that them to bare their humanness.I thought about rating this movie a ""5"" based on its' originality.  However, I stopped short of that because I thought it ended before it had the chance to explore other possibilities.

So I won't go into the basic premise here, in case you haven't seen it or heard about it.  Instead, basically here's what you'll learn in the first part of the movie:Truman lives with his wife in an ideal, suburban-like island community.  Truman's never left the island, his occasional attempts repressed.From Truman's point of view, strange things are happening, usually with pat explanations that comes a bit too late to ring true:The reappearance of his father, presumed dead; an elevator door that leads from a swank lobby to an unfinished room full of surprised looking loafers; voices on the car radio discussing his own whereabouts and movements; etc.  It becomes enough to make Truman paranoid, and to believe everyone is in on some kind of set-up at his expense, even his wife.  You'll see more than Truman does, evidence that he really is being spied on - by this time in the movie you'll probably know exactly what's going on, but the fun is in seeing Truman, initially baffled by the clues, gradually figure it out.One of the more imaginative sequences involves Truman gradually creating a picture of a girl he met in high school and never saw again.  He tears out different pieces of magazine pictures of women's faces, and pieces them together like a puzzle.  This is symbolic of his gradual discovery of what's really happening to him.If you don't like The Truman Show, I imagine it's because the premise doesn't seem to be plausibly presented. To me, that's part of the comedy.  It's also helped along by an outstanding performance by Ed Harris (The Right Stuff, Milk Money, Enemy at the Gates) as Christof, the guy behind it all.",5,Most fun paranoia possible.,1123632000,"08 10, 2005",2005,2509,"['guess', 'one', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'not', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'case', 'loved', 'mother', 'hated', 'twilight', 'zone', 'episode', 'lot', 'flare', 'humor', 'different', 'levels', 'depending', 'how', 'want', 'take', 'it.As', 'comedy', 'not', 'one', 'Carrey', 'funniest', 'consistenly', 'amusing', 'bit', 'dark', 'humor', 'even', 'morbid', 'However', 'enough', 'upbeat', 'tone', 'chiefly', 'due', 'music', 'Carrey', 'mere', 'presence', 'keep', 'being', 'classed', 'dark', 'comedy', 'want', 'can', 'read', 'more', 'perhaps', 'allegory', 'shells', 'build', 'symbolism', 'phoniness', 'general', 'something', 'that.If', 'know', 'premise', 'kind', 'spoils', 'surprise', 'intrigue', 'learning', 'what', 'going', 'main', 'character', 'Truman', 'Carrey', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'basic', 'premise', 'here', 'case', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'heard', 'Instead', 'basically', 'here', 'what', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'Truman', 'wife', 'ideal', 'suburban-like', 'island', 'community', 'Truman', 'never', 'left', 'island', 'occasional', 'attempts', 'repressed.From', 'Truman', 'point', 'view', 'strange', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'usually', 'pat', 'explanations', 'bit', 'too', 'late', 'ring', 'true', 'reappearance', 'father', 'presumed', 'dead', 'elevator', 'door', 'swank', 'lobby', 'unfinished', 'room', 'full', 'surprised', 'looking', 'loafers', 'voices', 'car', 'radio', 'discussing', 'own', 'whereabouts', 'movements', 'etc', 'enough', 'make', 'Truman', 'paranoid', 'believe', 'everyone', 'kind', 'set-up', 'expense', 'even', 'wife', ""'ll"", 'see', 'more', 'Truman', 'evidence', 'really', 'being', 'spied', 'time', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'fun', 'seeing', 'Truman', 'initially', 'baffled', 'clues', 'gradually', 'figure', 'out.One', 'more', 'imaginative', 'sequences', 'Truman', 'gradually', 'creating', 'picture', 'girl', 'met', 'high', 'school', 'never', 'saw', 'again', 'out', 'different', 'pieces', 'magazine', 'pictures', 'women', 'pieces', 'together', 'puzzle', 'symbolic', 'gradual', 'discovery', 'what', 'really', 'happening', 'him.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Truman', 'Show', 'imagine', 'premise', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'plausibly', 'presented', 'part', 'comedy', 'also', 'helped', 'along', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Right', 'Stuff', 'Milk', 'Money', 'Enemy', 'Gates', 'Christof', 'guy']",N/A

Certainly, it's a parable and a fantasy; Peter Weir has quite simply added another brilliant film to his awesome filmography. Jim Carrey was expected to be insanely funny because everyone thought he was nuts to begin with. As a previous reviewer said, that's what we expected from Robin Williams, too, and Adam Sandler (""Punch-Drunk Love""). Carrey's performance is so very complete, a wonderful display of sensitivity and focus. I was impressed. Mr. Weir's vision I'm sure had a lot to do with it all, and Laura Linney's performance was much under-rated. Ed Harris was customarily over-reactive. This is a fantasy to be enjoyed and not analyzed at first glance; let it take you in, and question your own mortality. This is a film about self-esteem.

Was it the fact that it was just another Jim Carrey movie... let alone Jim Carrey in a fairly dramatic role? My children almost seemed disappointed in Carrey. Disappointed in the fact that he wasn't acting like his normal characters - like Ace Ventura, Stanley Ipkiss or Lloyd Christmas. Wonderful performance by Jim Carrey and his supporting cast... Ed Harris, Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich (as Marlon). A film about false reality... all the characters in Truman's life are paid actors. Halfway thru, the story really picks up when Truman starts to figure things out. It's interesting to see the home audience watching and their reactions... from the viewers in the bar, the senior citizens watching at home with their Truman pillows, the car attendents, and even the guy that is forever in his bathtub. Truman Burbank's life is a TV show, and the whole world is watching. His dilemma begins when he gets the urge to explore - as he is telling his best friend Marlon about the need to ""get out there and see the world""... first stop is the island of Fiji. Naturally, the producer of the TV show (Ed Harris as 'Cristof'), wants to keep him at bay and will do anything to stop him... for without Truman, he has no show. Truman has been forever afraid of the ocean - since his father 'died' in a storm at sea right before his eyes. Now Truman must sneak away from the cameras and face the ocean to leave his so-called  reality. Cristof finds him in his boat and throws a wicked storm his way.

453647,A2IYUCI5A26O82,630518299X,R. Hansen,"[9, 9]","I've never been a fan of Jim Carey, but the idea behind this film intrigued me. I'm glad I saw it because it is an incredible work. In fact I am duly impressed with the completeness of the entire project. The script, direction, performances and attention to detail all mix to create a veritable trompe l' oeil, much like the fictitious world of Truman.This innovative film appeals to so many compelling concepts: The ubiquitous dint of television, the inclination of people to live vicariously through others, the turbid line between reality and the illusory, and the paranoia that someone is always `watching us'. At times I think that I must be some unwitting actor on a giant stage, being manipulated by some demiurgic force, because the world seems too ludicrous (not to mention the people that inhabit it) to be real.Of course the most piquant aspect of the movie is the exploration of the idea of a higher being. Truman's quest for the truth of his specious world is analogous to man's search for the meaning of religion, and ultimately, God. This is played out masterfully here. When the transmission is cut a person from the barroom exclaims `Jesus, God In Heaven!' As Truman nears his escape Sylvia (from outside of the fake world) ironically prays for his deliverance. Christof (catch the name?), played by Ed Harris, sits in his control room as the eminence grise of Truman's world. As the `creator' of the TV show that Carey's character dwells in, his position is plenary. The trouble is that Truman has questions that his ostensible family and friends cannot answer. Truman knows his life is a mendacious trap and he wants manumission. Ultimately Truman and Christof collide at the boundary of the faade as the former forces a theomachy. The omnipotent entity tries to force his recalcitrant subject to repent and return to his existence, but he refuses and finally rejects his originator.Other moments in the film are as entertaining as the concepts are deep. The technological glitches are amusing and the people trying to get on the set and warn him are great (esp. the guy jumping out of the Christmas present). The viewers are interesting too; the lady who ignores her crying child in order to see the show, the elderly women who watch so intently, and of course the security guards who provide the movie's prescient ending when they realize the show is finally over, `What else is on?'",5,Big brother meets reality TV,1091404800,"08 2, 2004",2004,2404,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'idea', 'film', 'intrigued', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saw', 'incredible', 'work', 'fact', 'am', 'duly', 'impressed', 'completeness', 'entire', 'project', 'script', 'direction', 'performances', 'attention', 'detail', 'mix', 'create', 'veritable', 'trompe', 'l', 'oeil', 'much', 'fictitious', 'world', 'Truman.This', 'innovative', 'film', 'appeals', 'so', 'many', 'compelling', 'concepts', 'ubiquitous', 'dint', 'television', 'inclination', 'people', 'live', 'vicariously', 'others', 'turbid', 'line', 'reality', 'illusory', 'paranoia', 'someone', 'always', 'watching', 'times', 'think', 'must', 'be', 'unwitting', 'actor', 'giant', 'stage', 'being', 'manipulated', 'demiurgic', 'force', 'world', 'too', 'ludicrous', 'not', 'mention', 'people', 'inhabit', 'be', 'real.Of', 'course', 'most', 'piquant', 'aspect', 'movie', 'exploration', 'idea', 'higher', 'being', 'Truman', 'quest', 'truth', 'specious', 'world', 'analogous', 'man', 'search', 'meaning', 'religion', 'ultimately', 'God', 'played', 'out', 'masterfully', 'here', 'When', 'transmission', 'cut', 'person', 'barroom', 'Jesus', 'God', 'Heaven', 'Truman', 'escape', 'Sylvia', 'outside', 'fake', 'world', 'ironically', 'deliverance', 'Christof', 'catch', 'name', 'played', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'control', 'room', 'eminence', 'grise', 'Truman', 'world', 'creator', 'TV', 'show', 'Carey', 'character', 'dwells', 'position', 'plenary', 'trouble', 'Truman', 'questions', 'ostensible', 'family', 'friends', 'can', 'not', 'answer', 'Truman', 'life', 'mendacious', 'trap', 'manumission', 'Ultimately', 'Truman', 'Christof', 'collide', 'boundary', 'faade', 'former', 'forces', 'theomachy', 'omnipotent', 'entity', 'tries', 'force', 'recalcitrant', 'subject', 'repent', 'return', 'existence', 'finally', 'originator.Other', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'as', 'entertaining', 'concepts', 'are', 'deep', 'technological', 'glitches', 'are', 'amusing', 'people', 'trying', 'get', 'set', 'warn', 'are', 'great', 'esp', 'guy', 'jumping', 'Christmas', 'present', 'viewers', 'are', 'interesting', 'too', 'lady', 'who', 'crying', 'child', 'order', 'see', 'show', 'elderly', 'women', 'who', 'watch', 'so', 'intently', 'course', 'security', 'guards', 'who', 'provide', 'movie', 'prescient', 'ending', 'when', 'realize', 'show', 'finally', 'What', 'else']",N/A

453649,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,630518299X,Robert Badgley,"[1, 1]","In another of my retro reviews,I thought I would return to one of Jim Carrey's best performances in The Truman Show.By now everyone knows the story of Truman Burbank(Jim Carrey) and his life which is viewed by people worldwide 24/7/365.There has been a live feed of him since his birth and the audience has viewed him at most every waking and sleeping moment he has had.He lives in a carefully controlled micro and macro environment.Everyone from his parents to his closest friends to his teachers are all fake;fake in the sense that they are all actors portraying certain parts in Truman's life.The entire city he lives in(Seahaven)is in a protective bubble and everything from the weather to the traffic to the changing of the days is controlled from the outside.Controlling every last detail of this vast project,and ultimately Truman's life,is Christof(Ed Harris).Beside's the enormous responsibility of Trumans' life,he has the TV network and it's ratings to figure into the overall equation.It is quite the balancing act.Now at age 30 Truman starts to suspect something is just not right.He sees a man that he swears is his ""father"" who is suddenly whisked away.A set light drops from the sky onto the road in front of his house.He is detecting patterns in everything from his neighbours,to traffic to his place of employment.His curiosity and testing of his suspicions start to throw the perfectly choreographed world Christof has created off the comfortable perch it has been on for so long;and he and his staff are having a hard time keeping up trying to predict what he will do next.Truman knows he MUST get away from the city by any means he can.He must escape and by escaping hopefully find the answers he seeks.In the films climax it is a battle of wills as Truman sails his boat away from the city with Christof conjuring a massive storm threatening to kill Truman.He almost succeeds but Truman barely scrapes through and sails his boat to the edge of the domed world.Truman walks out along a ledge and up a staircase to a doorway through which he escapes and into the ""real"" world.Carrey does such a good job of portraying just the right emotions at just the right time;such as when he faces down his own wife and his best friend knowing what they must think of him for raising doubts,but all the while deep inside knowing something is not right and that he must carry on no matter what.The movie works on so many levels simultaneaously;as reality TV to the extreme;an experiment in psychology and physiology;a micro and macro study of human development in a controlled environment with controlled stimuli;it even has it's theological threads as Christof literally plays God over Truman's entire life with even part of his name,Christ,emphasizing that fact.Truman is in a very real sense Christofs' Adam!Whatever level(s)you view this film on it still remains one heck of an entertaining film with a unique and different vision and story to tell.I think it is one of if not THE best performance by Jim Carrey to date,in a more serious vein.This role really challenges an actor to have a great depth and understanding of the part in order to properly emote at just the right moment and still staying true to the core of the character.Jim Carrey made it look effortless and I commend him for his talent and ability in that regard.The DVD picture is crisp and clear and is available in D-2.0 and D-5.1 surround sound.Special features on this DVD include:A two part doc on the making of the Truman Show,one on the visual effects of the movie,four deleted scenes,photo gallery,two trailers, and two TV spots.This is a movie that is a win-win all the way around.Jim Carrey gives a career cementing performance with this role while Ed Harris follows a close second with his portrayal of Christof.Director Peter Weir walked quite the tightrope with this script but managed to reach the other side unscathed;quite the feat considering the depth of the material he had to handle.It has been about eleven years now since its' inital release and it still holds up excellently.This is a definite must

453650,A361LE16VBQDP8,630518299X,Robert Bezimienny,"[4, 7]","This film has features akin to many mediocre science fiction films, in that it establishes an inherently interesting premiss, but fails to portray its protagonist as a credible, fully realised character.  Whatever 'journey' or development this character then undertakes seems obvious and almost inevitable, to the point of being unsatisfying.  The plot becomes similarly devoid of surprises.  Watching this might also be compared with viewing an 'escape' movie (i.e from a prison, or prisoner-of-war camp),  where very quickly you know where everything is headed - the pleasure then becomes that of the details, the mood, and unexpected insights into people's behaviour under stress (see 'Le Trou' for a classic example) - unfortunately, 'The Truman Show' is not strong on any of these counts.*Jim Carrey has a very limited talent.  He seems like a caricature of himself, every facial expression, every bodily gesture, being exaggerated.  This is fine for generating a certain kind of humour (Jerry Lewis did something similar), but it seems less than ideal as a technique for evincing audience empathy.  His casting here is regrettable.  I can imagine people leaping to his defence, but just imagine if this film starred an actor capable of rendering a complex personality, a personality riven with conflicting emotions and desires, rather than the 'one-emotion-at-a-time' style of Carrey - think Jeff Bridges (who appeared in Weir's 'Fearless'), or if you want go for broke, a young Marlon Brando.*What is more (or less), every other character is limited in depth and humanity.  Ed Harris, blank-faced veteran of such unreflective films as 'The Firm' and 'Apollo 13', gives a one, or possibly two, dimensional performance as producer turned god (perhaps this is forgivable as humanity has never been a notable quality of producers or gods).*Weir is at his best being suggestive.  'The Last Wave' is brilliant in this regard.  He's great at certain brooding atmospheres - see also 'Witness', or 'Picnic at Hanging Rock'.

Not at all.  Peter Weir's razor-sharp masterpiece, which was inexplicably denied an Oscar nomination for best picture, may be one of the most underrated movies ever to come out of Hollywood.  That a film this intelligent and provocative could even emerge from the Hollywood system is in itself a minor miracle.Much has been made of ""The Truman Show's"" subtext, and its timely implications about voyeurism and mass-media exploitation--all of which are entirely appropriate.  What gets lost in the discussion, however, is the fact that on a purely aesthetic level, Weir's film is a mightily impressive achievement.  If by sheer luck you don't yet know the film's much-publicized premise, you are probably in the best position to appreciate the consummate skill with which it unravels.The key word here is subtlety.  Rather than loudly trumpet what his film is really about (which, unfortunately, is exactly what Paramount did when promoting it), Weir initially frames his subject as an impeccably constructed mosaic, and then proceeds to pull that mosaic apart, piece by tantalizing piece.  Along the way, he employs some ingenious visual tricks and downright hilarious sight gags, so that by the time the big revelation arrives, it's not just a shock device--it's the culmination of an hour's worth of brilliantly sustained storytelling.  That's only the first pay-off.  There are plenty more to come, including a pivotal ""back from the dead"" scene so beautifully acted, so tightly edited, that it gets my vote for the single most riveting sequence of the year (and that includes the first 30 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"").It's a testament to Weir's skill that ""The Truman Show"" is not only one of the richest and most serious-minded films in recent memory, but also one of the funniest.  The numerous in-jokes--some of which would be the high points of a formulaic comedy but merely function as throwaways here--are truly priceless, and by extracting every possible ounce of humor from the material, Weir smartly avoids turning his movie into a polemic.  Equally impressive is his touch with actors--the criminally underestimated Jim Carrey does the best work of his career as Truman Burbank, while Ed Harris turns in a performance as human as it is chilling.  As Truman's wife and best friend, respectively, Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich offer excellent support.If this review sounds a tad evasive, it's only because ""The Truman Show"" is one film that deserves an untainted viewing.

I'm still scratching my head trying to figure out why this film was beat out by &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;,  and why Jim Carey, who turned in the best performance of his career in  &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, wasn't even nominated for best actor.The  plot of this movie is simple enough-Jim Carey plays a young man whose  entire life has been entertainment for the rest of the world.  He dares to  reach beyond the giant bubble which is his universe to see what's out  there, only to be foiled.Of particular note is the scene toward the  end of the film where Truman reaches the end of the dome shaped studio and  is told by Christoph (Ed Harris) about his world.

Imagine brushing your teeth, cooking a meal, watching TV, taking a shower, or just walking down the street without any solitude or discretion. Every smile, every tear, every embarrassing moment, every joyous hour - all caught on camera in an audience consisting of the entire world. Imagine finding out that your whole life has been an in-depth design of an innovative production team at a broadcasting company with more power than the president. What then? How badly would you suffer? Would your mind be completely blown? Could an idea like this be more unfeasible or absurd? These are the questions that &quot;The Truman Show&quot; poses to its audience as they examine the falsified life of a naive human being, a science project from its initial induction into a fictitious society. He grows into the man we know as Truman Banks, a man with nothing intimate concealed from anyone except his mind. His wife and friends are all talented thespians, chosen for him by the creative crew behind the eye in Truman's sky.This was a noteworthy film but it fell short of my initial expectations. I expected Jim Carrey to be a little more animated but I guess he was hard-pressed to give some earnest delivery after the numerous farces he effortlessly cranked out in the past few years, and the continuing doubt from audiences and critics alike that he could never do the serious actor bit convincingly. I wouldn't doubt Peter Weir had something to do with obtaining that goal, seeing as how his directing style is visibly apparent and exceedingly understated (Dead Poets Society, Witness, The Year Of Living Dangerously). I expect JC was on a very tight leash while under Weir's administration. His performance as a result was extremely subdued, but he was quite charming and very believable as a stanch romantic. Aside from this comforting fact, the action was less comedic than the overblown trailer gave the impression of. Don't get me wrong, the actors were great, but I thought I would laugh a lot more than I did when I watched it. I'm just thankful I rented it instead of going to the theaters to see it. ....Laura Linney pleasantly surprised me with her airhead act as the la-la-land persona of Meryl, this sunshiney portrayal attempted after her aggressive cabaret as prosecuting attorney Janet Venable in 1996's &quot;Primal Fear&quot;. She's a versatile talent, able to shift from one character to another with astonishing ease. She also impressed me recently in a made-for-TV movie called &quot;Running Mates&quot;, co-starring with Tom Selleck as his voracious lobbyist. Who I also took a liking to is Noah Emmerich, Truman's best friend Marlon. Noah was perfect as the everyday man and Truman's humble companion, following the baton well with Christof's instruction and the improv from fellow castmates (Linney). If you want to see another cute performance by Noah, watch &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot;. Ed Harris as the elusive mastermind behind it all was a strange casting choice. I really don't think he fit the part, what with his known temperament in roles. He can be the beguiling gentleman (China Moon), the indomitable sleuth (The Firm) or the serial psychopath (watch &quot;Just Cause&quot;, you'll be blown away!) but good and evil are the two extremes he wanders between and never teeters upon a fine line. He just isn't passive enough, and that makes me wonder if there were ever any creative differences between him and Weir during the filming of this movie. Of course, if someone as outrageous as Carrey can make the transition, I suppose Harris was more than willing to cooperate also.Besides the overblown theme, there are other problems, for instance the pace. This movie moves so slowly at times you wonder whether it's going to get to the point. Weir wastes so much time dwelling on what's inside Truman's heart that you have not an inkling of what's going on in his head or any outside stimuli. I wish I could appreciate the artistic essence of this film more, but the flaws seem to outweigh the assets. The older this film gets, the less appreciated it will be.

Raised entirely within a television show which comprises his entire world, Truman is an Everyman for the post-television age. Truman's world, ""Seahaven"", is an Eisenhower-era model of American bliss, recalling the prison-like Port Meirion and the moral certainty of Bedford Falls (""Its a Wonderful Life""). Surreptitiously filmed around the clock by 5000 hidden cameras, the show exists inside an enormous geodesic dome with simulated weather and even its own ocean. Through a series of production blunders Truman slowly realises that he is being controlled and that perhaps all in his world is not as it seems. His surrogate father by proxy, Christof (Ed Harris) the producer/director, goes from being benevolent social scientist to evil genius as his attempts to frustrate Truman's wanderlust become more and more deadly.  Truman becomes rebellious, trying desperately to escape his existence. More importantly, he is in love with a girl named Lauren (Natascha McElhone), who he met in school, but was taken away (She tried to tell Truman the truth).  In search for his one true love and the truth behind his life, Truman is taken on a whirlwind of experiences that are capitvating beautifully on screen.Director Peter Weir, who is emerging as one of Hollywood's most talented directors, plays the disgust element regarding Truman's situation strongly. He also provides an interesting portrait of the media and television industries, part satire and part thoughtful reflection, yet it's hard to believe the 'thoughtful reflection' side when all audiences watching Truman's show seem to be characters straight out of a satire (ditzy restaurant waitresses, a cackling man watching from his bathtub).  We can't take these characters seriously enough to reflect on what they represent in our society. Nevertheless, Weir maintains a firm directorial hand throughout; his pacing is superb, and his choices of music are, as usual, unexpected, refreshingly different (droning scores in the background reminiscent of 'Dead Poet's Society'), and completely succeed in beautifully complementing the film.  Weir is no stranger to casting comedic actors in dramatic films, he evoked a similar performance out of Robin Williams in ""Dead Poet's Society"". Here, he manages to morph Jim Carrey from playing the role of Truman as a straight out comedic role into playing a real person, who has the occasional comic moment. Besides being refreshingly subdued, Carrey also turns out a brilliant and consistently watchable performance, which is lucky, since his character in the film parallels his character's role on the TV show. The entire picture revolves around Truman, and Carrey carries the film with ease. It comes as a let down then, when Carrey lets himself drift ever so slightly over the top at parts, when Truman starts to go hysterical, believing people are following him.The supporting cast is less developed, also paralleling Truman's TV show, where characters seem to simply float in and out, never really connecting with the lead. The character of Truman's wife, played by Laura Linney, is hastily and sloppily written out of the story, leaving more room for a developing romantic subplot (which, mercifully, is only taken to a certain level) between Truman and a former 'cast member' (Natascha McElhone) whom Truman believes is the only woman he ever loved, and who, in turn, has developed feelings for Truman. But McElhone has one of the flimsiest characterizations in the film, despite how pivotal her character is, only really getting the chance to stare anxiously and complain about how this treatment of Truman is wrong. It's nice to see cameos from Harry Shearer as yet another news anchor, and Paul Giamatti as a show technician, but most of the acting support comes from Ed Harris' masterful performance as Christof, the man who orchestrated and directed virtually every aspect of Truman's artificial life. Harris is spellbinding, overshadowing every actor present except Carrey himself as the character stubbornly refuses to come to terms with the moral issues of his hit TV show.In the end this film is closer in spirit to psychological dramas and sci-fi movies where a person suddenly realizes they are the pawn in some grand experiment or a prisoner in an alien world than it is to anything in our current ""reality TV"" obsessed culture. Eventually it touches on a very basic conflict all humans must face (most people do so in childhood, some I fear never do). The universe does not revolve around us. In the closing moments we are excited for Truman because he finally realizes there is a whole new world out there to explore, but also slightly saddened because we know all to well that he will never be able to return to that idyllic ""childhood"" existence.  A giant leap for Carrey, and despite some of its enigmatic flaws, ""The Truman Show"" is an enduring, emotional, and humorus film with just the right touch of charm.",4,The Truman Show

I would not say that it is great entertainment; it's definitely not a movie to watch if you want to enjoy a good time and to feel better. Instead this ""psychological"" movie seems to be raising questions about individual Freedom and Privacy in our so-called ""modern, Western, democratic"" societies. Of course this is an important subject, and above all, this is a deep philosophical matter which needs to be constantly debated, because individual freedom can be endangered in many many ways . Naturally, very few things are more important than a person's freedom - and nothing is more precious than happiness I believe. So this movie, well in line with the Big Bother syndromes, raises important questions but does not try to give even the beginning of an answer or of a reason. The real problem however is : what do you believe in ? Do you believe in mankind ? Do you trust yourself ?? Do you trust your neighbour ? How much self-esteem do you have ? How much esteem do you need to feel happy ? How much love do you need to receive and to give to be happy ?? Unfortnately this movie does not provide any clues; it is just describing an absurd life, led by a guy who is a real prisoner inside a sort of virtual nightmare, cornered in a squarely strange bubble. What is very disturbing in this movie is the fact that somebody else decided that this person should be in this place without his consent and even without his knowledge, based on some dubious ethical grounds (here also the movie does not go far in providing clues). In essence it is describing a subtle and dangerous form of euthanasia , the euthanasia of freedom !! So is this movie a call to fight such threats to our freedom, or is it just a cold description or something that may happen, or has happened, or happens sometimes ?

This is a great movie that blends comedy and drama.  Carrey has some physical comedy, but much less than in his other films.  Watching Truman try to figure things out are the best scenes in the movie.  Boosting the movie is an excellent score by Burkhard Dallwitz.  This is a very good movie with something for everyone.Jim Carrey has never been better than his role as Truman Burbank, a man who is unknowingly the star of his own TV show.

Most of these people were silenced when 'The Truman Show' came out. Carrey proves he's more than capable of firing cheap (but funny) jokes at the audience. In fact, he does a helluva job as an actor here.Truman Burbank is your average Joe. A boring administrative job at a bank. A house with a fence and a wife. Nice friends. Or are they? Or in fact, is he?As it turns out, Truman, while being a baby, has become the world's first 24/7 soap star. He was removed from the 'real world' and placed into a giant city-sized studio. He's the world's most-viewed person on the planet, and doesn't realize it.His friends are in fact hired actors. His city is nothing but props. His wife married him for the sake of the show (And probably her wage and the marketing beneficials). So what _IS_ in fact real?Well, Truman is. Truman's dream is to head off to the Fiji Islands some day. Within his own (very small) world, Truman's life is genuine. The life, dreams, and thoughts of a real man, wanting to escape this place of utter boredom. Not that it's so bad there, but there's a whole world to explore, right?With and with, Truman starts to realise he's trapped in a carefully and closely directed world. Slowly, but surely, he catches on, and tests the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the people directing his life.The script itself challenges the reader. With soap operas occupying a LOT of airspace, and 'reality' programs like 'Big Brother' and 'American Idols' becoming more-and-more popular, where will it end? We already deprived people from their dignity and privacy. What's the next step? Their life?Is our thirst for genuine TV enough to force us into this scenario? Or would we rather have reality game shows where people are being slaughtered alive? (See The Running Man).",5,Reality TV.

Is there no genre this Australian director has not tried? An anti-war polemic? ""Gallipoli,"" with newcomer Mel Gibson. The supernatural? ""Picnic at Hanging Rock,"" based on a true incident. Coming of age? ""The Dead Poet's Society,"" with comic Robin Williams in his first serious role. You name it, Weir has done it, and done it extremely well.How fortunate for comic Jim Carrey to have had Weir to tame his rubber-faced antics in his first serious role. The coincidence does not minimize the talent that Carrey exhibits in ""The Truman Show"" and the sensitivity with which he exercises it. His lead performance was among the finest in its year not to be nominated for an Academy Award, and seeing it again on DVD only magnifies the slight. Truman lives an ordinary life under extraordinary circumstances: he is the clueless central figure, from birth to the present, in a popular reality TV show in which his home and town are settings and his wife, parents, co-workers and best friend are actors.Ed Harris is the eerily competent director of the show within this show. His assistant is nicely played by Paul Giamatti, who also was slighted by Oscar for his 2004 lead in ""Sideways."" The details and dynamic of the subterfuge, involving logistics and product placement, and how the show deals with Truman's awakening to the truth, are fascinating. As actors playing his wife and friend, Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich have funny and moving exchanges with Carrey, whose genius is not to be denied. His other forays into film drama have not been as successful as this truly original work.

I shouldn't have. Fortunately, I got the chance to see it at a friend's house, and I can honestly say that it left me speechless and amazed at the brilliance of the film. First of all, Jim Carrey excells in this role. I find him to be a very funny man in real life, but his wacky roles in previous movies (Ace Ventura, Dumb & Dumber...you know them) don't appeal to me at all. BUT, in this role, he shows that he is way more than a go-to weirdo or funnyman. The emotion and the vulnerability he brings to the naive Truman Burbank only improves as the movie goes on. Watching this man crack as the only world he knows begins to slowly betray him and the intensity of his attempts to discover what else is beyond his hidden cage is moving in a way that few movies can convey successfully.This movie is more than just about watching Truman Burbank find out the truth of his televised life, but it is a stunning portrayal of humanity. Truman's world was created by Christof (the always wonderful Ed Harris) to be what is considered ""perfection."" Christof is like God in the Seahaven world. He makes every choice for the world, including the weather and even Truman's fears...but Christof cannot change the one thing that noone can manipulate--Truman's thoughts. Truman is given the perfect wife, a brotherly bestfriend, a steady job, and a life in a world that exists without pain, sadness, or evil. But the world is a cage. The movie shows that stability is not perfection, ignorance is not bliss, and a life without ALL emotions--including sadness, fear, and pain--could never exist. Even without knowing that he is trapped, Truman feels the need to escape his ""perfect"" life and to see what else there is beyond the utopia that is Seahaven Island. It is a perfect display of our quest for the unknown, unsatisfaction with just mundane existence, and our interest in what normality really is.When you watch this movie, you will become just like the viewers in the movie who are watching Truman. You will root for him, cry for him, and laugh with (or at) him. His is truly a reality show that I hope that never is created for real...but we ARE humans, so who knows how we'll try to play God next...P.S.

453692,AQP1VPK16SVWM,630518299X,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[70, 74]","Before the absurd reality shows took the airwaves by storm, director Peter Weir and writer Andrew Niccol imagined the world of Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey). Adopted and placed in a soundstage build to resemble a small American town Seahaven, Truman discovers that his life is nothing more than a TV show full of product placement. Truman discovers his friends, family and the world he lives in is nothing more than a construct. The first clue occurs when a flood light used to illuminate the massive soundstage where Truman lives falls into the middle of the street.  When Truman wants to leave the small town he lives in and go to Fiji the TV show that is when his life begins to fall apart. Although Weir didn't write the film it deals with a subject common to his films; an individual who literally is an outsider in his own world. It's also about deception. Truman like most of Weir's protagonist discovers a web of deceit that corrupts his own world.A brilliant film that finds Weir (""Witness"", ""The Year of Living Dangerously"", ""Picnic At Hanging Rock"") in top form, it's amazing that this Oscar nominated film didn't pick up Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Writer and Best Director it was that good. Instead, the Academy rewarded ""The Truman Show"" like it does any film made by a Hollywood outsider-with a few awards recognizing the brilliance of the film and then settling into sublime mediocrity for the rest of the awards. There are clever visual references to Patrick MacGoohan's ""The Prisoner"" TV series woven into the visual motif of the film.Featuring a stunning anamorphic transfer, ""The Truman Show"" looks nearly perfect. Paramount has done a terrific job with this new edition. Colors are vibrant and bright and the image quality is amazingly sharp and crystal clear. The 5.1 sound mix makes nice use of the format with imaging placed around the speakers.We get a two part documentary that can either be played separately or as one. Weir, Carrey, Lara Linney and Noah Emmerich appear in interviews in the documentary. Curiously, the only person missing is writer Andrew Niccol. I'm not sure why Niccol doesn't appear in the film (perhaps he wasn't happy with some of the changes that Weir did but they work brilliantly). The fact that it closely resembles elements from Philip K. Dick's ""Time Out of Joint"" is also not addressed as well. The two part documentary runs about 40 minutes. The first part of the documentary focuses on the genesis of the film and some of the changes that occurred before the film was shot. The second part of the film focuses on pre-production through critical reception. This includes information on the wealthy beach community Seaside, Florida that DIDN'T want them to shoot there.We also get four deleted/extended scenes that provide additional information and background on the story. While they aren't essential, they are pretty fascinating to watch. There's also original theatrical trailers, TV spots and previews for other Paramount releases.A terrific film that was overlooked at Oscar time for far lesser films, ""The Truman Show"" catches Weir and his collaborators in top form. It's ironic that 10 years later the ""reality show"" world that was predicted came true (although not on this scale). The transfer looks terrific and the extras are certainly superior to the previous release on DVD.

If you're sceptical about Jim Carrey after all those silly movies he's done - rest assure, he proves that he can really act in this brilliant film.  The film is a sad tale about a man unaware that his life is being broadcast on its own devoted channel (since he was born).  He eventually discovers the truth and it leads to some interesting scenarios.  It also makes you realise how bizarre Reality TV is, and how viewers can be so dependant on television to satisfy their own boring lives.DVD SUMMARY:The print of this film is simply awesome, crystal clear with an impressive 5.1 soundtrack to boot - take note of the scene where the rain is falling on Truman (the sound is incredible in surround).  The DVD is let down however by  sad lack of extras - I mean, c'mon ... there must be some deleted scenes, behind the scenes footage?

When I finally did get around to seeing it in 2013, I realized that this show has become the most accurate representation of our current reality.I mean, back when this movie was made. Who really thought that there would be a time when a camera crew would follow someone around 24/7. From the time they wake up, use the bathroom, until the time they go to sleep. Obviously this movie has gone to extremes, but I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this happened in our lifetime.Anyway, should you watch the movie? Let's go into what was good and not so good about the Truman show.Good:- Very accurate portrayal of what our reality is like now. When this movie came out, this concept seemed far-fetched. Not anymore.- Jim Carrey does a great job of NOT hamming it up. He has some moments where he slips into his goofiness, but he plays it straight through most of the movie.- The acting and pacing is nicely done. There are really no boring moments in the movie.- The antagonist is very interesting. You can't quite tell if he's looking out for Truman, loves him, or just wants him for the ratings.My favorite line has to be from Carrey in one of the few moments where he hams it up. &#34;Is that the best you got? Ha ha ha ha ha! I guess you're just going to have to... KILL ME!&#34;Bad:The only one I could think of is that it's definitely dated. As the years progress, this movie will not age well.I enjoyed the movie and really couldn't find many negative things to say about it. I can't say I &#34;loved&#34; the movie, but I definitely did enjoy watching it.",4,Who would have thought how close to reality the Truman show would become.,1378771200,"09 10, 2013",2013,1621,"['So', 'being', 'late', 'party', 'never', 'saw', 'Truman', 'show', 'When', 'finally', 'did', 'get', 'seeing', '2013', 'realized', 'show', 'become', 'most', 'accurate', 'representation', 'current', 'reality.I', 'mean', 'back', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Who', 'really', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'time', 'when', 'camera', 'crew', 'would', 'follow', 'someone', 'around', '24/7', 'time', 'wake', 'up', 'bathroom', 'time', 'go', 'sleep', 'Obviously', 'movie', 'gone', 'extremes', 'honestly', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'happened', 'lifetime.Anyway', 'should', 'watch', 'movie', 'Let', 'go', 'what', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'Truman', 'show.Good', 'Very', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'what', 'reality', 'now', 'When', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'concept', 'seemed', 'far-fetched', 'Not', 'anymore.-', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'great', 'job', 'NOT', 'hamming', 'up', 'moments', 'where', 'goofiness', 'straight', 'most', 'movie.-', 'acting', 'pacing', 'nicely', 'done', 'are', 'really', 'boring', 'moments', 'movie.-', 'antagonist', 'very', 'interesting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'tell', 'looking', 'out', 'Truman', 'just', 'ratings.My', 'favorite', 'line', 'be', 'Carrey', 'one', 'few', 'moments', 'where', 'up', '34', 'best', 'got', 'Ha', 'ha', 'ha', 'ha', 'ha', 'guess', ""'re"", 'just', 'going', 'have', 'KILL', 'ME', '34', 'Bad', 'only', 'one', 'could', 'think', 'definitely', 'dated', 'years', 'progress', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'age', 'well.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'many', 'negative', 'things', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', '34', 'loved', '34', 'movie', 'definitely', 'did', 'enjoy', 'watching']",N/A

Weir manages to pull off a blend of surreal comedy and human drama in a way that a lesser director might not have achieved, managing to keep the two elements in perfect balance without losing the impact of either.The film is a powerful tale that takes the current trend in reality television to the nth extreme, the story of a man whose life IS a TV show (unbeknownst to him). It lampoons the dangerous direction of current television, a journey which only seems to have accelerated since this movie was made. Manipulation, artificiality, the stifling of creativity and imagination, and the scandalous objectifying of human lives are all exposed in this satire.

453701,AP3B615GM191G,630518299X,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[3, 3]","When ""The Truman Show"" hit theaters in the summer of 1998, there was no such thing as ""Survivor"", ""Big Brother"", ""Amazing Race"", or ""Jersey Shore"".  The fact that the film beat America to the reality-TV punch shows how much of a landmark production it truly was.For a basic plot summary, ""The Truman Show"" tells the story of Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), a ""regular guy"" who begins to suspect that his life is being controlled by forces outside of his own.  Without giving away any major spoilers, suffice it to say that after witnessing some strange behavior from his wife (Laura Linney), best friend (Noah Emmerich), and old flame (Natascha McElhone), Truman starts putting the pieces together and ultimately discovers how manipulated his life truly is.""Truman Show"" is a concept movie through-and-through.  It really nails the concept of ""reality TV"" & just how pervasive commercialism can become in our society.  As mentioned in the opener, this film was years ahead of its time in portraying such issues.  As such, the film resonates more today than it ever could have in '98.The acting helps the production rise above the concept, as well.  Carrey (though always typecast as ""Dumb"" or ""Ace"" type roles) turns in an Oscar-worthy performance as the befuddled Truman, while the auxiliary roles are finely-tuned also.  Director Peter Weir will have you truly caring about the little town of Seahaven Island and its inhabitants by the film's conclusion.Thus, I consider ""The Truman Show"" to be one of the better movie productions of all-time.  It has everything a great movie needs...intriguing plot, good pacing, solid acting, malleable characters, and even a little humor thrown in here and there.  This is a film that can be enjoyed (if not right away understand, in the case of the kiddies) by the entire family.",5,A Film Ahead Of Its Time,1325462400,"01 2, 2012",2012,1816,"['When', 'Truman', 'Show', 'hit', 'theaters', 'summer', '1998', 'was', 'such', 'thing', 'Survivor', 'Big', 'Brother', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'Jersey', 'Shore', 'fact', 'film', 'beat', 'America', 'reality-TV', 'punch', 'how', 'much', 'landmark', 'production', 'truly', 'was.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Truman', 'Show', 'story', 'Truman', 'Burbank', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'regular', 'guy', 'who', 'suspect', 'life', 'being', 'controlled', 'forces', 'own', 'giving', 'away', 'major', 'spoilers', 'suffice', 'say', 'witnessing', 'strange', 'behavior', 'wife', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'best', 'friend', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'old', 'flame', 'Natascha', 'McElhone', 'Truman', 'putting', 'pieces', 'together', 'ultimately', 'how', 'manipulated', 'life', 'truly', 'Truman', 'Show', 'concept', 'movie', 'through-and-through', 'really', 'concept', 'reality', 'TV', 'just', 'how', 'pervasive', 'commercialism', 'can', 'become', 'society', 'mentioned', 'opener', 'film', 'was', 'years', 'ahead', 'time', 'portraying', 'such', 'issues', 'such', 'film', 'more', 'today', 'ever', 'could', 'have', ""'98.The"", 'acting', 'production', 'rise', 'concept', 'as', 'well', 'Carrey', 'always', 'typecast', 'Dumb', 'Ace', 'type', 'roles', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'befuddled', 'Truman', 'auxiliary', 'roles', 'are', 'finely-tuned', 'also', 'Director', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'will', 'have', 'truly', 'caring', 'little', 'town', 'Seahaven', 'Island', 'inhabitants', 'film', 'conclusion.Thus', 'consider', 'Truman', 'Show', 'be', 'one', 'better', 'movie', 'productions', 'all-time', 'everything', 'great', 'movie', 'needs', 'intriguing', 'plot', 'good', 'pacing', 'solid', 'acting', 'malleable', 'characters', 'even', 'little', 'humor', 'thrown', 'here', 'there', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'right', 'away', 'understand', 'case', 'kiddies', 'entire', 'family']",N/A
