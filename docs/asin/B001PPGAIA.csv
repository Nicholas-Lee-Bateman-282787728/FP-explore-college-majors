Unfortunately, it ends up more like the kitchen sink, with the director trying to do too much at once, with a who's who of Australian cinema that also does the same. The first part is farce, the second part melodrama, the third action film and the fourth war film.Jackman is great, Kidman does well but overwrought, she always seems buttoned up anyway. We don't get to see much of the 'happy 2 years' til the war comes, so her whole 'you can't let the kid go walkabout' and scene where he goes to mission island lacks context.The motiveless malevolence of David Wenham, especially towards his own son, just seemed over the top.

The movie is spectacular and must be watched on the big screen and, yet, I have reservations recommending it outright. It's a longer film, clocking in at over 2 and 3/4 hours. The beginning of the film is intense and captivating and the movie could've easily been about the first part of the film. However, Baz isn't the one to give in to traditional formula and standard filmmaking, and goes on to expand the story and layer it with more magnificence and historical backdrop. The movie is visually stunning in its cinematography and costume design (as is to be expected from a Luhrmann production) and the cast is good to look at it too. Casting is particularity well chosen and both Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman act with grace and intelligence and ease. Kidman's performance will be recognized mightily come awards time, but it is Brandon Walters (in his debut role as Nullah, the character who represents the movie's main subplot of the Stolen Generation) who steals the show. Overall, this is atypical Lurhmann film, but it's also atypical Hollywood film and it's this unusual quality that makes it not only unique but highly watchable and immensely entertaining (and not for everyone).",4,it's not for everyone but those who love Luhrmann will love this film,1228003200,"11 30, 2008",2008,1331,"['epic', 'turn', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'audience', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'knock', 'viewers', 'off', 'feet', 'either', 'movie', 'spectacular', 'must', 'be', 'watched', 'big', 'screen', 'yet', 'have', 'reservations', 'recommending', 'outright', 'longer', 'film', 'clocking', '2', '3/4', 'hours', 'beginning', 'film', 'intense', 'captivating', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'been', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'However', 'Baz', ""n't"", 'one', 'give', 'traditional', 'formula', 'standard', 'filmmaking', 'expand', 'story', 'layer', 'more', 'magnificence', 'historical', 'backdrop', 'movie', 'visually', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'costume', 'design', 'be', 'expected', 'Luhrmann', 'production', 'cast', 'good', 'look', 'too', 'Casting', 'particularity', 'well', 'chosen', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'act', 'grace', 'intelligence', 'ease', 'Kidman', 'performance', 'will', 'be', 'recognized', 'mightily', 'come', 'awards', 'time', 'Brandon', 'Walters', 'debut', 'role', 'Nullah', 'character', 'who', 'movie', 'main', 'subplot', 'Stolen', 'Generation', 'who', 'show', 'Overall', 'atypical', 'Lurhmann', 'film', 'also', 'atypical', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'unusual', 'quality', 'not', 'only', 'unique', 'highly', 'watchable', 'immensely', 'entertaining', 'not', 'everyone']",N/A

Modern actors acting old-fashioned is probably not a very easy task.  Also, any movie from Baz requires a commitment.

1227861,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B001PPGAIA,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[8, 9]","The first half of this monster of a movie was quite enjoyable. It depicts a desperate cattle drive through the desert to the port of Darwin. I thought I was watching an Aussie version of ""Red River."" Nicole Kidman playing the terribly proper English aristocrat Lady Sarah Ashley winds up on a cattle ranch in the middle of the outback to sort out her dissolute husband -- but finds him dead. She teams up with High Jackman's character, known pretentiously only as ""Drover"" which happens to be his profession. Kidman performs with restraint but Jackson imbues his character with all the realism of a bed knob.Also involved is an Aboriginal mixed-race child called ""Nullah"" who is likably played by Brandon Walters. Meanwhile the child's father, the evil ""Fletcher"" is working to sabotage the cattle drive so he can take over the land.The photography of the desert scenary is spectacular and this first half of the movie has a narrative thrust and power that kept me quite enthralled. The cattle drive ends successfully -- and that's where the movie should have ended too. Unfortunately, director Baz Luhrmann is intent on making a major statement about Australian history, racism, the Japanese air raid on Darwin, the nature of love and desire and heaven knows what else. Now we're in another movie -- an Aussie version of ""Pearl Harbor"" mixed with ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner."" On and on the movie grinds -- the music swells as Luuhrmann presses every emotional button that's available. The central incident in this part of the movie is a Japanese attack on an island where Nullah has been taken to attend a mission school. Japanse troops land on the island determined to kill everyone there. This is entirely fictitious. The Japanese never landed on the island. Drover and his sidekicks mount a daring rescue mission. Everyone is joyouysly reunited and the movie finally takes mercy on its viewers and ends.Too long, too pretentious, too manipulative.",2,Terrible mishmash and historically inaccurate,1245628800,"06 22, 2009",2009,1954,"['first', 'half', 'monster', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'desperate', 'cattle', 'drive', 'desert', 'port', 'Darwin', 'thought', 'was', 'watching', 'Aussie', 'version', 'Red', 'River', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'playing', 'terribly', 'proper', 'English', 'aristocrat', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'Ashley', 'up', 'cattle', 'ranch', 'middle', 'outback', 'sort', 'out', 'dissolute', 'husband', 'dead', 'teams', 'up', 'High', 'Jackman', 'character', 'known', 'pretentiously', 'only', 'Drover', 'be', 'profession', 'Kidman', 'restraint', 'Jackson', 'character', 'realism', 'bed', 'knob.Also', 'involved', 'Aboriginal', 'mixed-race', 'child', 'called', 'Nullah', 'who', 'likably', 'played', 'Brandon', 'Walters', 'Meanwhile', 'child', 'father', 'evil', 'Fletcher', 'working', 'sabotage', 'cattle', 'drive', 'so', 'can', 'take', 'over', 'land.The', 'photography', 'desert', 'scenary', 'spectacular', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'narrative', 'thrust', 'power', 'kept', 'quite', 'enthralled', 'cattle', 'drive', 'successfully', 'where', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'too', 'Unfortunately', 'director', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'intent', 'making', 'major', 'statement', 'Australian', 'history', 'racism', 'Japanese', 'air', 'raid', 'Darwin', 'nature', 'love', 'desire', 'heaven', 'what', 'else', 'Now', ""'re"", 'movie', 'Aussie', 'version', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'mixed', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'movie', 'music', 'Luuhrmann', 'emotional', 'button', 'available', 'central', 'incident', 'part', 'movie', 'Japanese', 'attack', 'island', 'where', 'Nullah', 'been', 'taken', 'attend', 'mission', 'school', 'Japanse', 'land', 'island', 'determined', 'kill', 'everyone', 'there', 'entirely', 'fictitious', 'Japanese', 'never', 'landed', 'island', 'Drover', 'sidekicks', 'mount', 'daring', 'rescue', 'mission', 'Everyone', 'joyouysly', 'reunited', 'movie', 'finally', 'mercy', 'viewers', 'ends.Too', 'long', 'too', 'pretentious', 'too', 'manipulative']",N/A

Kidman's performance is her best since Far and Away, and the cattle ranch Down Under is named Faraway Downs - coincidence or lingering sentiment?3. Super hot Aussie all-rounder and hoofer Hugh Jackman heats up the screen as Drover, the Crocodile Dundee-type chappy who rounds up the cattle on the hoof.4. Turns out that Lady Sarah ends up in the middle of a cattle war with the reigning King Carney (Bryan Brown) and his slimy sidekick Neil Fletcher (David Wenham)5. Some of the story is narrated by Nullah (Brandon Walters) a young half-caste boy who sends Lady Sarah's heart over the rainbow6. No prizes for guessing who else sets her heart aflutter7. When droving cattle towards a billabong, never say Never Never8. Still about two hours to go for this epic romance/adventure/drama that highlights the fate of half-Aboriginal children known as the Stolen Generations with the backdrop of the Japanese bombing of Darwin during WWII9.

I guess you could describe it as an epic.  At nearly three hours, it delivers on this front!  But still....it failed to deliver any sort of knockout punch.The film is set during the early years of the Second World War in both Darwin and the outback reaches of Australia's Northern Territory. Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) travels to a huge cattle station called Faraway Downs which is being managed by her husband.  She arrives to find her husband murdered and she thence becomes involved with some very shady businessmen.  They want her property and hope to see her on the next plane back to England.  The male love interest is High Jackman who plays ""Drover"" which is a description of his job but also, for the film, the only name that he is given.  The pair seems to bond well on screen.The rest of the film is the basic love story set against a stunning scenic back drop.  There is also a back story of the ""stolen generation"" where the young aboriginal boy, Nullah, steals the show.  It is he rather than Kidman or Jackman who is the real star of the show.Overall, I found this film disappointing.  It was clich&eacute;d and predictable.

1227876,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001PPGAIA,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Walking into `Australia', I was expecting a disaster.  Despite being a fan of Luhrmann's, I was extremely skeptical of how this film was going to pan out since it was universally panned by nearly all critics and even by fans of the director.  It was seen as a misstep.  I was never really interested in the storyline or the feel of the film.  It just didn't have that same Luhrmann flare that I had grown to admire.I'm glad I finally saw this.`Australia' is far from a perfect film.  In fact, it is far from a great film, but it is good and one that, while messy, makes for a satisfying film experience.  The plot follows a woman named Sarah Ashley who travels to Australia to fetch her husband (whom she expects is chasing tail) and sell her land.  She is greeted by the Drover, a rugged and somewhat detached soul who is put off by the dainty Ashley.  When Sarah finally gets to her land she uncovers a dark plot involving a rival cattle baron who is stealing her cattle in an attempt to win over a huge account.  At the end of her rope, Sarah teams up with the Drover and a haphazard crew of drunks and Aboriginal's to drive her cattle through the outback and to victory.But the film doesn't end there.My main issue with `Australia' is that it's two halves don't quite gel as fluidly as they needed to.  It is clear that Baz Luhrmann was shooting for an ode to `Gone With the Wind'.  This is clear from some of the film's opening shots and the use of reds in the sky at dusk.  Baz also made mention of that in interviews at the time of the film's release.  The fact that the film takes place in 1939 (although `The Wizard of Oz' is the primary cinematic reference) is another giveaway.  Luhrmann was trying to make a socially important film regarding his homeland, and he manages to create some stirring visuals and connect some important dots, but this plays out like two separate films being squished together in a way that just doesn't work.  Sadly, the film comes off as a tad forced in some areas, as well as a tad repetitive.The look and feel of the film feels very much like a film Bogart and Hepburn could have made in the 40's, and that is nostalgic and endearing, but the corny dialog and plot points don't always work in a modern world.  I think that may have been a major reason why this is regarded so low by so many.  I don't think many moviegoers were expecting such a vintage feel to a film by Baz Luhrmann.  This is sad, because Luhrmann actually creates a beautiful homage to the classics and it is that aspect of the film that drew me closer and closer to it.When the film ended I was torn.  It was far better than I expected it to be, and yet again it was extremely flawed.

It also has a good dose of big name stars.  Sadly ""Australia"" lacks the power of synergism, and the parts come across as only a portion of what it could have been.After watching this film a few times I was struck by the fact that there is a wealth of possibilities in this story, but none of them was developed compeltely enough to be the central carrying force of the entire show.  It seemed like once a central theme was about to emerge the storyline would shift, and we were off in a different direction.  That was the case with the potential comedic element at the beginning of the show (watch for the scene with the kangaroos...you'll see), the budding romance between two of the main characters, the plight of half-white and half-aboriginal children in 1930s Australia, and the who-dun-it that seemely appeared out of nowhere.Am I glad I watched the show?

Not Darwin, though, I think. I understand the temperatures there in the summer are pretty outrageous. And I'm not sure I could celebrate the first big storm of the rainy season by running around in the downpour laughing and dancing.Still this is a great story. As far as I'm concerned, the real star of it is the little kid who is the narrator as well as central character. His name is Nullah, and as he explains right at the start, he's not a black fella, he's not a white fella, he doesn't belong anywhere.Well, that turns out not to be entirely true. But the government was certainly trying to enforce that concept. They set up ""mission schools"" where the half-caste children were basically taught to act white, and probably to aspire to jobs as servants. Nullah does not want to go. He's happy living on the cattle station where his mother works, in spite of being afraid of the manager who is probably his father and also apparently the murderer of the owner, Lord Ashley. Lady Ashley (Nicole Kidman) arrived from London just in time to find her husband laid out for burial. The murder was assumed to be the work of King George, Nullah's grandfather and a powerful native wizard. Indeed, he has taught Nullah much magic.One of the things that interests me about Australian movies and books is that they almost always act as if the aborigines' magic is real. Well, perhaps it is.This is a long movie, 2 3/4 hours long, but you'll never get bored. There are so many threads to the story that it weaves a complicated tapestry before you know what hit you. You can't help loving the main characters, Nulla, Lady Ashley, and Drover. And there are real villains to hiss, as well. Some of them work for the landowner right next to (and virtually surrounding) Lady Ashley's station, and the boss is determined to buy her out for a fraction of what the place is worth. He's trying to get a monopoly on supplying beef for the Army, and a ship is waiting in Darwin's port for the cattle he wants to sell for way too much money. So Lady Ashley, Drover, Nulla, and a minimum small band of assistance drive the cattle to Darwin despite all the odds. They face remarkable perils and have remarkable help, including some of that aborigine magic.The other significant thread is, quite obviously, the growing romance between Lady Ashley and Drover. All I have to say about that is I totally understand why Lady A found Drover (Hugh Jackman) appealing, and I suppose the gentlemen readers will understand why he found Nicole Kidman desirable. They make a very sweet couple when they get the chance.But don't forget the government's attempts to kidnap Nullah and try to make a good little Christian peasant out of him. That turns out to have bigger ramifications than it appeared early in the story, even though his mother died to protect him from the ""coppers.""Yes, see it.

1227888,A1CZAMELERRIKR,B001PPGAIA,"Barbra Madejczyk ""state theatre qualifier""","[0, 0]","Hugh Jackman has risen to fame and popularity as the tormented Marvel superhero, Wolverine. One would think that his legions of followers are there to gaze upon his handsome face and see his powerful form in action, but the Wolverine is the product of Hugh's acting talent--always multi-faceted and a blending of the character's positive and negative qualities. This transformative talent makes him totally believable in this very satisfying tale featuring the extreme beauty of Australia. The story is a tribute to the country's much loved cultural icons, and parts of the story loom large as if in fond admiration of them. Jackman portrays Drover, an image of the iconic master horseman and livestock herder of the Outback. He brings this image out of local legend and makes him honest and real--someone you would recognize from your youth as that guy who never started fights but always finished them, yet was a kind, thoughtful and true friend. Nichole Kidman plays Lady Sara Ashleigh, the wealthy, high-born Englishwoman who comes to Australia to bring her husband home, but stays to avenge his death. She is met at the ship dock at Darwin by Drover, who has been hired to drive her to her husband's station, Faraway Downs. This has been arranged by her husband's foreman specifically to scare her off--a delicate society lady who will be disgusted by the Drover's rough manner, high-handed attitude and easy sexuality with the local natives, and it seems to work; she hates the dust, the lack of morality and the apparent brutality of the landscape and the people. We learn that the foreman has been rustling Lord Ashleigh's steers for ""King"" Carney, who owns just about every place but Faraway Downs. The plan is to drive Lord Ashleigh out of business after which the foreman can have the station, which he has coveted since he was a boy and his father was foreman. The foreman will then partner with Carney. The foreman has murdered Lord Ashleigh to hurry the plan along, a fact unknown to Carney. But the evil foreman has judged Sara very poorly. She learns of the plot from the genteel, alcoholic bookkeeper, and when she sees the foreman cruelly beating a very young bi-racial boy for a tiny offense, she angrily orders him off the property. He laughs, and leaves with all the workmen except the Drover, who is his own boss. Sara is determined to stand up to the barbaric injustice she has encountered; she hires the Drover to move the herd to the shipping docks to honor a contract with the English Army, to feed the soldiers fighting in World War II. He thinks she's crazy. Who will he get for herdsmen? Lady Sara says she will ride (we have seen earlier in the film that she is an excellent horsewoman), and she will learn to herd the cattle. We now are introduced to another Australian icon--the brave, smart woman who can work side by side with the men and be their equal. The Drover has always wanted a thoroughbred to breed with the Australian brumbies and she promises him her horse. The two native women who work in the house are experienced herders and they too will ride, plus the alcoholic bookkeeper who admires and respects Sara enough to give up the bottle and help out. They need one more rider and after some thought, choose the little bi-racial boy. It is through this boy that we encounter the mysticism that the Australians revere in their native peoples. The boy, Nullah, is the grandson of a great leader and shaman. We meet the grandfather, called King George by the white people, while he is teaching Nullah the ways and songs of his people. Native songs are magic and history all in one, and the boy learns well. On the trail we learn that Sara's delicate beauty and genteel ways mask her inner strength and sense of justice, and these are revealed as they travel the starkly majestic plains of the wilderness. There is much danger and excitement on the drive, and a clash of wills with King Carney in the town of Darwin. There are brawls, snotty society people and much heroism in the old style of the 1940's and '50's films of Hollywood. This film feels very much like an old John Ford western, where courage and honor were still values to strive for; the people of this 1940's Australia are much like that. Baz Lurman takes what could easily be a simple melodrama and makes it a film of endearing simplicity about the sacrifices people really do make for love.",4,"Cowboy Hugh--action, adverture, romance and Nichole Kidman",1402963200,"06 17, 2014",2014,4399,"['Hugh', 'Jackman', 'risen', 'fame', 'popularity', 'tormented', 'Marvel', 'superhero', 'Wolverine', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'legions', 'followers', 'are', 'there', 'gaze', 'handsome', 'face', 'see', 'powerful', 'form', 'action', 'Wolverine', 'product', 'Hugh', 'acting', 'talent', 'always', 'multi-faceted', 'blending', 'character', 'positive', 'negative', 'qualities', 'transformative', 'talent', 'totally', 'believable', 'very', 'satisfying', 'tale', 'featuring', 'extreme', 'beauty', 'Australia', 'story', 'tribute', 'country', 'much', 'loved', 'cultural', 'icons', 'parts', 'story', 'loom', 'large', 'fond', 'admiration', 'Jackman', 'Drover', 'image', 'iconic', 'master', 'horseman', 'livestock', 'herder', 'Outback', 'image', 'local', 'legend', 'honest', 'real', 'someone', 'would', 'recognize', 'youth', 'guy', 'who', 'never', 'started', 'fights', 'always', 'finished', 'yet', 'was', 'kind', 'thoughtful', 'true', 'friend', 'Nichole', 'Kidman', 'Lady', 'Sara', 'Ashleigh', 'wealthy', 'high-born', 'Englishwoman', 'who', 'Australia', 'bring', 'husband', 'home', 'avenge', 'death', 'met', 'ship', 'dock', 'Darwin', 'Drover', 'who', 'been', 'hired', 'drive', 'husband', 'station', 'Faraway', 'Downs', 'been', 'arranged', 'husband', 'foreman', 'specifically', 'scare', 'off', 'delicate', 'society', 'lady', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'disgusted', 'Drover', 'rough', 'manner', 'high-handed', 'attitude', 'easy', 'sexuality', 'local', 'natives', 'work', 'dust', 'lack', 'morality', 'apparent', 'brutality', 'landscape', 'people', 'learn', 'foreman', 'been', 'rustling', 'Lord', 'Ashleigh', 'steers', 'King', 'Carney', 'who', 'just', 'place', 'Faraway', 'Downs', 'plan', 'drive', 'Lord', 'Ashleigh', 'business', 'foreman', 'can', 'have', 'station', 'coveted', 'was', 'boy', 'father', 'was', 'foreman', 'foreman', 'will', 'then', 'partner', 'Carney', 'foreman', 'murdered', 'Lord', 'Ashleigh', 'hurry', 'plan', 'fact', 'unknown', 'Carney', 'evil', 'foreman', 'judged', 'Sara', 'very', 'poorly', 'plot', 'genteel', 'alcoholic', 'bookkeeper', 'when', 'foreman', 'cruelly', 'beating', 'very', 'young', 'bi-racial', 'boy', 'tiny', 'offense', 'angrily', 'orders', 'off', 'property', 'workmen', 'Drover', 'who', 'own', 'boss', 'Sara', 'determined', 'stand', 'up', 'barbaric', 'injustice', 'encountered', 'Drover', 'move', 'herd', 'shipping', 'docks', 'honor', 'contract', 'English', 'Army', 'feed', 'soldiers', 'fighting', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'crazy', 'Who', 'will', 'get', 'herdsmen', 'Lady', 'Sara', 'will', 'ride', 'have', 'seen', 'earlier', 'film', 'excellent', 'horsewoman', 'will', 'learn', 'herd', 'cattle', 'now', 'are', 'introduced', 'Australian', 'icon', 'brave', 'smart', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'work', 'side', 'side', 'men', 'be', 'equal', 'Drover', 'always', 'wanted', 'thoroughbred', 'breed', 'Australian', 'brumbies', 'horse', 'two', 'native', 'women', 'who', 'work', 'house', 'are', 'experienced', 'herders', 'too', 'will', 'ride', 'alcoholic', 'bookkeeper', 'who', 'Sara', 'enough', 'give', 'up', 'bottle', 'help', 'out', 'need', 'one', 'more', 'rider', 'thought', 'choose', 'little', 'bi-racial', 'boy', 'boy', 'encounter', 'mysticism', 'Australians', 'revere', 'native', 'peoples', 'boy', 'Nullah', 'grandson', 'great', 'leader', 'shaman', 'meet', 'grandfather', 'called', 'King', 'George', 'white', 'people', 'teaching', 'Nullah', 'ways', 'songs', 'people', 'Native', 'songs', 'are', 'magic', 'history', 'one', 'boy', 'well', 'trail', 'learn', 'Sara', 'delicate', 'beauty', 'genteel', 'ways', 'mask', 'inner', 'strength', 'sense', 'justice', 'are', 'revealed', 'travel', 'starkly', 'majestic', 'plains', 'wilderness', 'much', 'danger', 'excitement', 'drive', 'clash', 'wills', 'King', 'Carney', 'town', 'Darwin', 'are', 'brawls', 'snotty', 'society', 'people', 'much', 'heroism', 'old', 'style', '1940', 'films', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'old', 'John', 'Ford', 'western', 'where', 'courage', 'honor', 'were', 'still', 'values', 'strive', 'people', '1940', 'Australia', 'are', 'much', 'Baz', 'Lurman', 'what', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'simple', 'melodrama', 'film', 'endearing', 'simplicity', 'sacrifices', 'people', 'really', 'do', 'make', 'love']",N/A

1227894,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B001PPGAIA,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[0, 0]","More bothersome than anything about AUSTRALIA is that it is both mislabeled as a romantic epic and that it seems to try and lead the audience in too many artistic directions. While viewing the trailers for it, I assumed it was another Baz Luhrmann visual-fest (if you've seenMoulin Rougeyou know exactly what I'm talking about).But from the get-go, I got the sense that Luhrmann was trying more to get across a sense of Australia's forgotten history than to entertain us. But then, as the film progressed, the gears of this behemoth began spinning in all different directions at different times. Clocking in at 165 minutes and costing over $130 million, Australia seemed (on the outside) to be headed toward the epic category.The good is that the film (just barely) holds together. Much of that is thanks to Luhrmann who, although he had a tenuous grip on it, delivered an entertaining mesh. The over-the-top acting, line-deliveries, and color schemes are all what we've come to expect from this dynamic director, too.Beginning with the life of an aboriginal half-breed named Nullah (relative unknown Brandon Walters), we initially seem to be headed toward the historical drama fold. Similar in tone to another excellent film you might want to check out entitledRabbit-Proof Fence, we are given some background on ""the lost generation"" of aborigines who were stolen from their parents and put in ""white homes"". But then the story switches to that of Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman,The Golden Compass), an English woman of noble right who comes looking for her supposedly cheating husband in the back-country of Australia at their ranch known as Faraway Downs. When she arrives, she quickly meets up with the ruggedly handsome and ruggedly tough Drover (Hugh Jackman,The Fountain) who guides her to Faraway Downs only to discover that her husband has been murdered, the ranch on the verge of collapse, and a group of aborigines hiding in fear of the local constabulary (among them is Nullah). The ""I-despise-you-but-eventually-fall-in-love-with-you"" story will not surprise anyone. And seeing Jackman and Kidman together is pretty easy on the eyes. But then a new wheel finds a cog and we're thrust into the middle of WW II. Oh. And did I mention that Nullah's grandfather is a medicine man and wants Nullah to follow in his footsteps? And that the main antagonist in the film is Nullah's white father? And that a businessman in the area wants to steal Faraway Downs from Lady Ashley? And all of this happens during a cattle drive? Whoa!To be even more brutally honest, there are a host of other things going on, too, which further muddies the waters. The astonishing thing, though, is that the film remains entertaining despite all of these threads. Kidman and Jackman's chemistry is very believable. And young Brandon Walters delivers an endearing role as the lost half-breed. The scenery, too, is astounding, with rich color sequences that follow sepia tones.It could've been better by settling on a few less plot threads. But it is what it is. And I'm glad I watched it.

She fires the leering foreman, and considers hiring the dark, husky young Drover to help her get her cattle to market. But she doesn't like him. He's so pushy. He's so arrogant.... then again...Sound familiar? Well, there's no particularly new ground here, but there is a sprawling, colorful, sweeping saga filmed on location in Queensland, Wales, and Australia, surrounded by loving, masterful cinema strokes from one of our finest directors. CGI and rotoscope effects anchor beautiful, majestic shots of the baking desert and high country. It's hot, and things heat up as Kidman starts to melt, starting from the first night on the trail, when Jackman takes his shirt off to shower.  At almost three hours, ""Australia"" is too long, but boredom is not an option. Baz Luhrmann's 2001 musical classic ""Moulin Rouge"" was held captive in a Parisian dance-hall. Luhrmann's new ""Australia""  explodes with the same quick-cut, self-confident magical movie-making style. Here is an honest, touching, magical journey. Here is a young boy and a native king, both born of the desert, and bound not to live without it. Here  is a story not bound to a wooden Parisian stage(""Moulin Rouge""). Here is a story not bound at all.

It begins in 1939, just as World War II is getting underway and Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) travels to Australia to bring home the husband she hasn't seen in an unspecified length of time.  Lord Ashley has been developing a stock ranch, Faraway Downs, which is encircled on three sides by the holdings of local beef baron ""King"" Carney (Bryan Brown), and he turns up dead--supposedly murdered by an aboriginal shaman known as King George--on the very day Sarah arrives.  When she realizes that her husband's station manager Neil Fletcher (David Wenham) isn't quite what he claims to be, she fires him, then finds herself crewless and teams up with rough-and-ready Great War veteran Drover (Hugh Jackman) and his two aboriginal riders, Ivan and Magarri (the latter in fact the brother of Drover's late wife) plus a ragtag trail crew--her Chinese cook, an aboriginal woman, a hard-drinking accountant, and King George's 10-year-old half-caste grandson Nalla (Brandon Walters)--to get 1500 head of cattle to the port of Darwin.  If she can succeed, she'll nail down a hefty Government beef contract--but Fletcher first stampedes her cattle, then poisons the waterholes on her route.  Now the only chance Sarah & Co. have is to drive across the Never-Never desert, guided by King George.  Of course they succeed, and thereby hangs the first climactic scene.  Then the story shifts from Western/romance to war story/drama as Sarah and Drover struggle to reconcile with each other's very different personalities and priorities, keep Nalla out of the hands of the government assimilation program, and survive the Japanese air attack that follows the Pearl Harbor tragedy--and hence the second.Many critics seem to consider the movie high camp, but I found it entirely enjoyable (despite a slightly ambiguous and unsatisfying ending) as a serious tale of adventure, jealousy, greed, love (not just the romantic kind: Nalla clearly develops a deep attachment to ""Mrs. Boss,"" as he christens Sarah, and to Drover), and determination, with elements of several major film genres.  (It's a great pity no one seems to have done a novelization; I'd have liked to have seen what a good adapter could do with the characters' backgrounds.)  It's the kind of movie that makes you realize (much as didQuigley Down Under) that the U.S. wasn't the only country that ever had a Frontier Experience--and that Australia's was in many ways similar.",5,Two for the price of one,1282608000,"08 24, 2010",2010,2598,"['Australia', 'could', 'almost', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'duology', 'not', 'only', 'almost', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'two', 'genuine', 'climactic', 'moments', ""'ll"", 'get', 'presently', '1939', 'just', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'getting', 'underway', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'Ashley', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Australia', 'bring', 'home', 'husband', ""n't"", 'seen', 'unspecified', 'length', 'time', 'Lord', 'Ashley', 'been', 'developing', 'stock', 'ranch', 'Faraway', 'Downs', 'encircled', 'three', 'sides', 'holdings', 'local', 'beef', 'baron', 'King', 'Carney', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'up', 'dead', 'supposedly', 'murdered', 'aboriginal', 'shaman', 'known', 'King', 'George', 'very', 'day', 'Sarah', 'When', 'husband', 'station', 'manager', 'Neil', 'Fletcher', 'David', 'Wenham', ""n't"", 'quite', 'what', 'be', 'then', 'crewless', 'teams', 'up', 'rough-and-ready', 'Great', 'War', 'veteran', 'Drover', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'two', 'aboriginal', 'riders', 'Ivan', 'Magarri', 'latter', 'fact', 'brother', 'Drover', 'late', 'wife', 'ragtag', 'trail', 'crew', 'Chinese', 'cook', 'aboriginal', 'woman', 'hard-drinking', 'accountant', 'King', 'George', '10-year-old', 'half-caste', 'grandson', 'Nalla', 'Brandon', 'Walters', 'get', '1500', 'head', 'cattle', 'port', 'Darwin', 'can', 'succeed', ""'ll"", 'nail', 'down', 'hefty', 'Government', 'beef', 'contract', 'Fletcher', 'first', 'cattle', 'then', 'waterholes', 'route', 'Now', 'only', 'chance', 'Sarah', 'Co.', 'have', 'drive', 'Never-Never', 'desert', 'guided', 'King', 'George', 'course', 'succeed', 'thereby', 'hangs', 'first', 'climactic', 'scene', 'Then', 'story', 'shifts', 'Western/romance', 'war', 'story/drama', 'Sarah', 'Drover', 'struggle', 'reconcile', 'other', 'very', 'different', 'personalities', 'priorities', 'keep', 'Nalla', 'hands', 'government', 'assimilation', 'program', 'survive', 'Japanese', 'air', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'tragedy', 'hence', 'second.Many', 'critics', 'seem', 'consider', 'movie', 'high', 'camp', 'found', 'entirely', 'enjoyable', 'slightly', 'ambiguous', 'unsatisfying', 'ending', 'serious', 'tale', 'adventure', 'jealousy', 'greed', 'love', 'not', 'just', 'romantic', 'kind', 'Nalla', 'clearly', 'deep', 'attachment', 'Mrs.', 'Boss', 'Sarah', 'Drover', 'determination', 'elements', 'several', 'major', 'film', 'genres', 'great', 'pity', 'one', 'have', 'done', 'novelization', ""'d"", 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'what', 'good', 'adapter', 'could', 'do', 'characters', 'backgrounds', 'kind', 'movie', 'realize', 'much', 'didQuigley', 'Down', 'U.S.', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'country', 'ever', 'had', 'Frontier', 'Experience', 'Australia', 'was', 'many', 'ways', 'similar']",N/A

There were some similarities, mainly is how well aboriginies were portrayed.  Makes sense that there'd be a half breed generation stolen from their mom's.  Note it wasn't a buncha white women with aborigine men.  Apparently, there were many Native Americans and, of course, Vietnamese, who were children of white American males and native women.  A nation is judged by history over how they handle those children.  This director did a great job weaving in a zing of almost fantasy, portraying the non Western aspects of aborigine culture in a cool way.

1227910,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001PPGAIA,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 3]","""Australia"" may in fact be Baz Luhrmann's most ambitious film, a love story about as epic in scope as the country itself. It's in some ways a departure from his first three films--""Strictly Ballroom,"" ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet,"" and ""Moulin Rouge""--all of which were told in the language of theatrical opulence; ""Moulin Rouge,"" for example, was a delightful sight and sound frenzy, with an operatic tragedy set against the backdrop of flashy sets and creative special effects. Even though it took place in 1899 Paris, it's about a time and place that could only exist in the imagination. Now we have ""Australia,"" which doesn't go for all-out fantasy but instead pays homage to the period melodramas of yesteryear. It presents us with a fabled but not wholly unrealistic setting, and despite a number of cumbersome details, the plot follows one of the most basic love-story formulas ever conceived of, namely two people from very different worlds falling in love.Some may criticize this film for its lack of originality. But keep in mind that we're talking about a fable, which is to say that Luhrmann never needed to reinvent the wheel. Every character is a tried and true archetype, and they're part of a story that's essentially a sweeping romance, the likes of which haven't been seen since ""Gone With the Wind."" The sentiment is reflected in the film's cinematography, which is striking to say the least; many shots are majestic bird's-eye views of distant landscapes, all obviously meant to fill every square inch of the broad Cinemascope format. And then there's David Herschfelder's grandiose score, which is clearly evocative of a love that will carry on no matter what. Such a love blooms between an English aristocrat named Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) and a rugged Australian stockman known only as the Drover (Hugh Jackman); they have virtually nothing in common, yet on a cattle drive across the Outback, they discover that they have feelings for one another.All this is completely expected and very well done. The only real flaw is that, at 165 minutes, the film is too long. Beginning in 1939 at the height of World War II, ""Australia"" interweaves a few too many themes and subplots, meaning there always seemed to be a lack of focus. Prim and proper Lady Ashley arrives in Australia to retrieve her husband, who owned a cattle station called Faraway Downs just southwest of a town called Darwin. She inherits the station when she discovers that her husband has been killed. She then learns that a rival group of English cattle barons, led by the wealthy King Carney (Bryan Brown), are plotting to steal her property; Carney relies on a ruthless Australian station manager named Neil Fletcher (David Wenham), a villain in every sense. Faced with the prospect of driving an entire herd of cattle through the Outback, Lady Ashley enlists the help of the Drover, who makes it clear that he only works for commission--no one hires him, and no one fires him.Tagging along is a half-blooded Aborigine boy named Nullah (Brandon Walters), who doubles as the film's narrator. His inclusion represents Luhrmann's personal disapproval of Australia's former racial policies, specifically the forced enslavement and brainwashing of Aboriginal children (which, appallingly, wasn't stopped until 1973). It's quite possible he made this film partially in response to the fact that his government formally apologized to indigenous peoples this year. A well-rounded social commentary to be sure, although I can't help but wonder how relevant it is given the fact that the film is, above all, a classic period drama. Still, Nullah takes part in some of the film's best moments, not the least of which is a beautiful scene featuring Lady Ashley telling him the story of ""The Wizard of Oz."" Watching their feelings for one another grow was certainly satisfying; for all intents and purposes, she becomes his mother by the end of the film.Nullah also was a nice counterpart to his grandfather (David Gulpilil), a wise and mysterious Aborigine who is both a spiritual guide and a physical protector. It may seem he has the ability to appear and disappear at will, although it's more likely that such moments represent Nullah's state of mind. Because he often yearns for his grandfather, it's almost as if he's right there with him.As with ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Romeo + Juliet,"" ""Australia"" begins in the spirit of good fun, only to grow more and more serious. By the time we reach the final forty-five minutes or so, the Japanese have begun bombing the country, which puts Lady Ashley, the Drover, and Nullah in an entirely new dramatic situation. It becomes less of a western and more of a war drama. As with the rest of the film, the climactic last act was visually splendid and wonderfully structured. There was, however, a creeping sense that it belonged in a different film, which is worrisome considering the skill employed by the filmmakers. But in no way does it ruin the entire experience. Despite some length, focus, and pacing issues, ""Australia"" is a stirring film, at times fun, at times touching, always adhering to the traditions that defined some of our more famous Hollywood romance stories. For characters that are deliberately broad, the actors give very enjoyable performances. It was especially nice to watch Jackman, who has so rarely been allowed to use his natural accent. And as for Kidman, well, the fact that she's such a talented actress should tell you everything.",4,A Dramatic Wonder in the Land Down Under,1227657600,"11 26, 2008",2008,5500,"['Australia', 'may',

Given the strong connection to Xavier Herbert's book ""Poor Fellow My Country"" (and hi earlier ""Capricornia""), acknowledged near the end of the final credits, it would have been better to get a bit closer to either the facts or Herbert's stories. The beef baron was actually English, not Australian, and the kow-towing to the English was much greater in reality. The separation between whites and aborigines was far sharper and harsher than  portrayed, and remains so, albeit significantly lessened these days (I lived in Darwin for some years). The peer pressure to conform to the social norms was far greater than portrayed. When was there ever an aboriginal woman who couldn't swim, or at least float? And where are these big cliffs and deserts between Katherine and Darwin? Herbert also viewed the behavior of many people in Darwin at the time of the first  Japanese bombing as quite shameful, and the conclusion of ""Poor Fellow My Country"" was anything but upbeat: it was a tragedy, pure and simple. The courageous died or disappeared, and the drones and the mindless mob inherited the Earth.So, watch ""Australia"" for the scenery, for the cinematography, for some false nostalgia, a spot of romance, and some feel-good stuff, but don't mistake it for any kind of reality, past or present.",2,"Mediocre at best, a Xavier Herbert rip-off without the guts",1237161600,"03 16, 2009",2009,1332,"['was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'film', 'Given', 'strong', 'connection', 'Xavier', 'Herbert', 'book', 'Poor', 'Fellow', 'My', 'Country', 'hi', 'earlier', 'Capricornia', 'acknowledged', 'end', 'final', 'credits', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'get', 'bit', 'closer', 'either', 'facts', 'Herbert', 'stories', 'beef', 'baron', 'was', 'actually', 'English', 'not', 'Australian', 'kow-towing', 'English', 'was', 'much', 'greater', 'reality', 'separation', 'whites', 'aborigines', 'was', 'far', 'sharper', 'harsher', 'portrayed', 'so', 'significantly', 'lessened', 'days', 'lived', 'Darwin', 'years', 'peer', 'pressure', 'conform', 'social', 'norms', 'was', 'far', 'greater', 'portrayed', 'When', 'was', 'ever', 'aboriginal', 'woman', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'swim', 'least', 'float', 'where', 'are', 'big', 'cliffs', 'deserts', 'Katherine', 'Darwin', 'Herbert', 'also', 'viewed', 'behavior', 'many', 'people', 'Darwin', 'time', 'first', 'Japanese', 'bombing', 'quite', 'shameful', 'conclusion', 'Poor', 'Fellow', 'My', 'Country', 'was', 'anything', 'upbeat', 'was', 'tragedy', 'pure', 'simple', 'courageous', 'died', 'disappeared', 'drones', 'mindless', 'mob', 'inherited', 'Earth.So', 'watch', 'Australia', 'scenery', 'cinematography', 'false', 'nostalgia', 'spot', 'romance', 'feel-good', 'stuff', 'do', ""n't"", 'mistake', 'kind', 'reality', 'past', 'present']",N/A

1227922,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B001PPGAIA,Cubist,"[6, 7]","After his debut filmStrictly Ballroom, writer/director Baz Luhrmann never looked back, creating lavish, ultra-stylish musicalsRomeo & Juliet - The Music EditionandMoulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition), and let's not forget that $5 million Chanel commercial starring his cinematic muse, Nicole Kidman. With his latest film, Australia, he decided to take national pride to a whole new level by creating a sweeping romantic epic about his home country that takes place between the World Wars and was made by and starring Australians. With a budget in the neighborhood of $130 million, the pressure was on Luhrmann now more than ever before to deliver at the box office and, while underperforming in North America, it has gone on to gross $200 million worldwide despite a lukewarm critical response.As he proved with is previous films, Luhrmann has an uncanny knack for casting. Who can forget the undeniable chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in Romeo + Juliet and the sparks that flew between Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge!? He's at it again with this new film with the casting of Hugh Jackman and Kidman as the romantic leads.Jackman finally fulfills those early comparisons to Clint Eastwood as he plays the Drover as a tough, dependable hero who's not afraid to show his vulnerable side. He's never been more charismatic as he proves to be equally adept at the physical demands and the emotional range that the role requires. No one knows how to photograph Kidman quite like Luhrmann. She looks stunning, even covered in a layer of dirt and dust from a cattle drive. At first, her stuffy English aristocrat comes off as a cartoonish stereotype but as her character becomes acclimatized to the country and she develops a bond with Nullah, she becomes warmer and more empathetic.Beginning in 1939 and climaxing with the Japanese bombing of Darwin in 1942, Luhrmann's Australia mixes the larger-than-life melodrama of Gone with the Wind (1939) with the exciting cattle drive in Red River (1948) and with a dash of The Wizard of Oz (1939). His film clearly harkens back to the kind of cinema that they just don't make anymore with very little CGI used and everything built from scratch and on location. Australia is the kind of ambitious Technicolor epic that might have been made by John Ford or George Stevens. It is a marvel of absolutely stunning cinematography - only Luhrmann could make the desolate outback look vibrant and alive. He alternates between sun-drenched day scenes and night scenes that appear to be impossibly illuminated by the stars.One should not go into Australia expecting realism. Luhrmann presents a mythologized take on his country. Love him or hate him, you have to respect Luhrmann for not being afraid to wear his heart on his sleeve. He's arguably the most romantic filmmaker working today with the possible exception of Wong Kar-Wai.

1227927,AIMGHPI1AGVRF,B001PPGAIA,Davewise,"[2, 3]","Despite all the poor reviews by critics, I wanted to give ""Australia"" a try. Overall I enjoyed the movie but it definitely has flaws and I don't feel it has much replay value for me. The visual presentation was well done; however, the writing - and at times the acting - was a little over-the-top.The movie has three main parts - it starts out as a Western, switches to a romance, then finally becomes a war film. For the most part the transitioning works and the variety makes for an interesting movie. This also helps it not feel like a long movie despite being over 2.5 hours. My favorite part was the Western. Sarah (Kidman) arrives in Australia to see what her husband is up to, only to find him murdered. With the help of the Drover (Jackman) and other outcasts from society, Sarah has to drive the cattle from her husband's estate to the coast for sale. There are dangers along the way, mostly set by Fletcher (David Wenham), who used to work for her husband but really works for ""King"" Carney, the rancher out to monopolize the cattle industry.The romance part centers on Sarah's relationship with Drover and Nullah, a half-Aboriginal child whom they adopt as their own. Nullah's grandfather is ""King George"", the local magic man. Nullah tended to get annoying at times, saying the same things over and over again. Kidman and Jackman do make a nice couple though. Since Nullah is half-Aboriginal and half-Caucasian, he is an outcast and is soon taken from them; Sarah does everything to get him back.Finally in the third part, World War II comes to Australia in the form of Japanese planes which attack the port where Sarah has stayed to get Nullah back. Drover is off on a long cattle drive related to the war effort when the attack occurs, so his help is late in coming, if at all.The acting is just okay, nothing outstanding. I think part of this is from the writing, which came across as rather melodramatic and forced at times. The Australian landscape was very picturesque, especially during the cattle drive. It was the proper backdrop for the epic which the movie wanted to be, and sometimes succeeded at. In essence, if you are looking for a beautiful melodrama, this movie is for you.",3,An epic melodrama which has its moments,1278979200,"07 13, 2010",2010,2202,"['poor', 'reviews', 'critics', 'wanted', 'give', 'Australia', 'try', 'Overall', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'definitely', 'flaws', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'much', 'replay', 'value', 'visual', 'presentation', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'however', 'writing', 'times', 'acting', 'was', 'little', 'over-the-top.The', 'movie', 'three', 'main', 'parts', 'out', 'Western', 'switches', 'romance', 'then', 'finally', 'war', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'transitioning', 'works', 'variety', 'interesting', 'movie', 'also', 'not', 'feel', 'long', 'movie', 'being', '2.5', 'hours', 'favorite', 'part', 'was', 'Western', 'Sarah', 'Kidman', 'Australia', 'see', 'what', 'husband', 'only', 'find', 'murdered', 'help', 'Drover', 'Jackman', 'other', 'outcasts', 'society', 'Sarah', 'drive', 'cattle', 'husband', 'estate', 'coast', 'sale', 'are', 'dangers', 'way', 'mostly', 'set', 'Fletcher', 'David', 'Wenham', 'who', 'used', 'work', 'husband', 'really', 'King', 'Carney', 'rancher', 'monopolize', 'cattle', 'industry.The', 'romance', 'part', 'centers', 'Sarah', 'relationship', 'Drover', 'Nullah', 'half-Aboriginal', 'child', 'whom', 'adopt', 'own', 'Nullah', 'grandfather', 'King', 'George', 'local', 'magic', 'man', 'Nullah', 'tended', 'get', 'annoying', 'times', 'saying', 'same', 'things', 'over', 'again', 'Kidman', 'Jackman', 'do', 'make', 'nice', 'couple', 'Nullah', 'half-Aboriginal', 'half-Caucasian', 'outcast', 'soon', 'taken', 'Sarah', 'everything', 'get', 'back.Finally', 'third', 'part', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Australia', 'form', 'Japanese', 'planes', 'attack', 'port', 'where', 'Sarah', 'stayed', 'get', 'Nullah', 'back', 'Drover', 'off', 'long', 'cattle', 'drive', 'related', 'war', 'effort', 'when', 'attack', 'help', 'late', 'coming', 'all.The', 'acting', 'just', 'okay', 'nothing', 'outstanding', 'think', 'part', 'writing', 'came', 'rather', 'melodramatic', 'forced', 'times', 'Australian', 'landscape', 'was', 'very', 'picturesque', 'especially', 'cattle', 'drive', 'was', 'proper', 'backdrop', 'epic', 'movie', 'wanted', 'be', 'sometimes', 'succeeded', 'essence', 'are', 'looking', 'beautiful', 'melodrama', 'movie']",N/A

1227929,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B001PPGAIA,David J. Brown,"[0, 1]","I missed this one when it was in the theatres, it didn't seem like it was there very long.  I had heard split reviews about the film.  Some hated it, some thought it was mediocre, nobody thought it was brilliant...and it certainly isn't, but it is definitely worth checking out.I don't do plost synopsis, so scroll up for that....This movie is so similar to Gone With The Wind in tone it's amazing.  It is truly old-fashioned filmmaking on a grand scale.  This film tried to tackle so many things, that only a few of them pay off in a major way.  The romance between Jackman and Kidman is simplistic and archetypical of any old western.  They have good chemistry and their performances are winning.  There are many big and elaborate set-pieces in this film, but only one really stands out, the stampede scene.  This one has the visual splendor and excitement we go to the movies for and even has a climax that is fun and plays into one of the film's themes.  Don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it, so I won't say what.But there are other scenes like the Japanese bombing that is quite underwhelming and doesn't quite have the punch it should.  It feels like that this tale has so much ground it wants to cover as far as Australian history goes and so much old-fashioned cinema conventions it wants to incorporate that it doesn't seem to be able to punch up many set-pieces, with the exception of the cattle stampede.The only other real flaw of this film comes from the racial issues presented.  It rightfully portrays the racist natures of many of Australia's inahbitants and the British looking to 'reform' some of the natives and 'creamy's' or half white and half blacks.  Native peoples of this region were treated as subhuman and their tribal rituals treated as satanic and primitive.  As if what they believed was any less silly than Christianity.  This is where the film gets hazy.  It seems to take the native's mysticisim literally.  Which means that Nullah(a child in the story that becomes very important to many events) is omniprescent, and seems to be able to appear and disappear at will, along with his on-the-run uncle(who hides in the mountains due to the mis-accusation of murder) King George.  The movie doesn't out-right say that they are superantura, but then it doesn't reallys ay that they're not.  King George seems to be able to appear at will, and at the right times.  Plus, he can easily catch up with men on horses and running cattle on foot, in the mountain tops.  The problem is that it takes some of the drama away from the events.  If they are mystical then why would the boy need so much help, and why would he be so afraid of danger and need so much saving?  Also, and this may be just my take, but doesn't take a little away from their struggle?  Their stuggles in Australia took a lot of human will to uprise, survive and take back the humanity they were denied.  All the mystical elements seem to make their struggle simplified and take some of the importance out of it...at least for me.So, is the film worth checking out?  Definitely!  It's visually stunning and absolutely beautifully filmed.  The director Baz Luherman(Moulin Rouge, Romeo + Juliet) was obviously very passionate about this film and it's subject and old-fashioned style.  His usual hyperactive, choppy editing style is mostly abscent in this film.  You can feel his presence, especially in the first act(light moments and broad comedy mixed with blunt camera moves) but once the second act rolls he settles down into the traditional Gone With The Wind template.  The acting is all on the money, the script is spritely and unabashedly epic in the old-school Hollywood tradition.  The romance is thin and not especially deep(blowing in the wind cowboy falls for stuck up proper English women, both change after meeting each other) but it works thanks to the movie star casting, and infectious on-screen persona's Jackman and Kidman present.The dvd editon of the film is waaaaay too sparse.  All we get are two deleted scenes.  This is a 20th Century Fox dvd, so past experience has taught me to expect another extended edition with a second disc of special features.  This is one film I wouldn't mind double dipping on and seeing a meatier version of, especially if we get more depth of character, more beautiful vistas and the basic traditional Hollywood grandiosity.",4,"Big, sprawling, epic in the Gone With The Wind tradition, but a bit underwhelming.",1236297600,"03 6, 2009",2009,4387,"['missed', 'one', 'when', 'was', 'theatres', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'was', 'there', 'very', 'long', 'had', 'heard', 'split', 'reviews', 'film', 'hated', 'thought', 'was', 'mediocre', 'nobody', 'thought', 'was', 'brilliant', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'plost', 'synopsis', 'so', 'scroll', 'up', '.This', 'movie', 'so', 'similar', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'tone', 'amazing', 'truly', 'old-fashioned', 'filmmaking', 'grand', 'scale', 'film', 'tried', 'tackle', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'only', 'few', 'pay', 'off', 'major', 'way', 'romance', 'Jackman', 'Kidman', 'simplistic', 'archetypical', 'old', 'western', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'performances', 'are', 'winning', 'are', 'many', 'big', 'elaborate', 'set-pieces', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'out', 'stampede', 'scene', 'one', 'visual', 'splendor', 'excitement', 'go', 'movies', 'even', 'climax', 'fun', 'one', 'film', 'themes', 'Do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'what.But', 'there', 'are', 'other', 'scenes', 'Japanese', 'bombing', 'quite', 'underwhelming', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'punch', 'should', 'tale', 'so', 'much', 'ground', 'cover', 'as', 'far', 'Australian', 'history', 'so', 'much', 'old-fashioned', 'cinema', 'conventions', 'incorporate', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'punch', 'up', 'many', 'set-pieces', 'exception', 'cattle', 'stampede.The', 'only', 'other', 'real', 'flaw', 'film', 'racial', 'issues', 'presented', 'rightfully', 'racist', 'natures', 'many', 'Australia', 'inahbitants', 'British', 'looking', ""'reform"", 'natives', 'half', 'white', 'half', 'blacks', 'Native', 'peoples', 'region', 'were', 'treated', 'subhuman', 'tribal', 'rituals', 'treated', 'satanic', 'primitive', 'what', 'believed', 'was', 'less', 'silly', 'Christianity', 'where', 'film', 'hazy', 'take', 'native', 'mysticisim', 'literally', 'Which', 'Nullah', 'child', 'story', 'very', 'important', 'many', 'events', 'omniprescent', 'be', 'able', 'appear', 'disappear', 'will', 'on-the-run', 'uncle', 'who', 'mountains', 'due', 'mis-accusation', 'murder', 'King', 'George', 'movie', ""n't"", 'out-right', 'say', 'are', 'superantura', 'then', ""n't"", 'reallys', 'ay', ""'re"", 'not', 'King', 'George', 'be', 'able', 'appear', 'will', 'right', 'times', 'can', 'easily', 'catch', 'up', 'men', 'horses', 'running', 'cattle', 'foot', 'mountain', 'tops', 'problem', 'drama', 'away', 'events', 'are', 'mystical', 'then', 'why', 'would', 'boy', 'need', 'so', 'much', 'help', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'afraid', 'danger', 'need', 'so', 'much', 'saving', 'Also', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'take', ""n't"", 'take', 'little', 'away', 'struggle', 'stuggles', 'Australia', 'took', 'lot', 'human', 'will', 'uprise', 'survive', 'take', 'back', 'humanity', 'were', 'denied', 'mystical', 'elements', 'seem', 'make', 'struggle', 'simplified', 'take', 'importance', 'least', 'me.So', 'film', 'checking', 'out', 'Definitely', 'visually', 'stunning', 'absolutely', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'director', 'Baz', 'Luherman', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'Romeo', '+', 'Juliet', 'was', 'obviously', 'very', 'passionate', 'film', 'subject', 'old-fashioned', 'style', 'usual', 'hyperactive', 'choppy', 'editing', 'style', 'mostly', 'abscent', 'film', 'can', 'feel', 'presence', 'especially', 'first', 'act', 'light', 'moments', 'broad', 'comedy', 'mixed', 'blunt', 'camera', 'moves', 'once', 'second', 'act', 'rolls', 'down', 'traditional', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'template', 'acting', 'money', 'script', 'spritely', 'unabashedly', 'epic', 'old-school', 'Hollywood', 'tradition', 'romance', 'thin', 'not', 'especially', 'deep', 'blowing', 'wind', 'cowboy', 'stuck', 'up', 'proper', 'English', 'women', 'change', 'meeting', 'other', 'thanks', 'movie', 'star', 'casting', 'infectious', 'on-screen', 'persona', 'Jackman', 'Kidman', 'present.The', 'dvd', 'editon', 'film', 'waaaaay', 'too', 'sparse', 'get', 'are', 'two', 'deleted', 'scenes', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'dvd', 'past', 'experience', 'taught', 'expect', 'extended', 'edition', 'second', 'disc', 'special', 'features', 'one', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'double', 'dipping', 'seeing', 'meatier', 'version', 'especially', 'get', 'more', 'depth', 'character', 'more', 'beautiful', 'vistas', 'basic', 'traditional', 'Hollywood', 'grandiosity']",N/A

1227939,A2IHIKHWCDB0FG,B001PPGAIA,Dexter Manning,"[9, 14]","THE FILMAfter many months of anticipation, Baz Luhrmann's epic motion picuture ""Australia"" has opened in theaters. The director of such deliciously extravagant spectacles as ""Moulin Rouge!"" ""Romeo + Juliet,"" and the giant stage phenomenon ""La Boheme,"" Luhrmann is indeed a storyteller but, first and foremost, a showman on the grandest scale possible, and his latest offering is no exception. Visually, his films look sumptuous, with production design that is so lavish and imaginitively unusual that the films seem to be carried along with the winds of escapist fantasy.""Australia"" is different in some ways from, say, ""Moulin Rouge!"" his previous effort. The new film, due to its setting in the rowdy, rugged desert continent ""down under"" during the Second World War, necessarily ties in with historical and social issues that are not to be taken lightly, such as the relations of the Aborigines, especially their children, with people of European descent. It's also a story about class, focusing on interclass relationships, and business and life in a harsh environment evocative of America's old wild west, and with as many social parallels.The movie exudes Luhrmann's trademark brand of exuberance and boisterousness, which feels exciting of course, but there are several moments, especially in the first forty-five minutes or so, when such a tone is misplaced, given the dead-serious significance of what is happening onscreen at the time. Presenting the story cloaked in such a tone, along with the irreverant humor in some scenes (also something of a trademark of this director), actually marginalizes, to a degree, the very real tragedies suffered at the time: social ostracism based on race, ethnicity, class, or gender; wartime attacks on civilians by foreign countries; military camps for unwanted children; and, to a lesser extent, generational differences. ""Moulin Rouge!"" could afford to take a more playful approach, due to its telling of a story that, compared to that of ""Australia,"" seems of less consequence (though still tragic in its own way); this film shouldn't have that luxury. It is evident that the filmmakers' were well-intentioned in depicting these issues and, fortunately, this picture does not persistently remain so flippant.The story (conceived by Luhrmann, who also wrote the screenplay with Stuart Beattie,  Ronald Harwood and Richard Flanagan) is narrated by one of those aforementioned ostracized kids, a young boy by the name of Nullah (charming, soulful Brandon Walters, making his movie debut) who, as the son of an Aboriginal woman and a White man (the identity of the man is not entirely clear until toward the end of the film), is derisively considered a ""cream,"" as all such children are. It is also the story of a wealthy, exquisitely well-mannered Englishwoman, Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman, gorgeous and first-rate, as usual, continuing her work with Luhrmann after starring in the director's ""Moulin Rouge!""; she was also the villainess in an adventure of a different sort, ""The Golden Compass""). Upon arriving in the country, en route to her late husband's mansion in the Australian outback, she seems humorously detached from any world outside her one of privilege to the point where the movie seems to ridicule her as a floozy. It's an example of the movie's style diminishing the importance of such a character, who, as the film itself later shows, was ahead of her time in her developing a lucrative and powerful business despite her sex, her relations with members outside her established class, and her acceptance, care and compassion for Aborigines and Aboriginal children at a time when the Europeans and their descendants routinely institutionalized them, supposedly for the benefit of society.When circumstances leave Nullah a child alone, Lady Sarah welcomes him into her home, and, eventually, into her heart, despite her initial feeling that she would not be a good mother. In an effort to cheer him up, she tries to tell him the story of ""The Wizard of Oz,"" going so far -- at Nullah's gentle insistance -- as to sing a few songs from the old classic (badly, as she's out of tune and can't remember the lyrics or, for that matter, much of the story). Her surrogate child loves music and loves to sing, and does so quite beautifully, especially his favorite, ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow."" One some levels it makes sense that it becomes a running motif through the rest of the film, given the more fantasy- and childlike aspects of the production. However, it is also rather overused and grows a bit saccharine, especially as the film becomes more serious.Finally, the story is also about Drover (Hugh Jackman, conceived here as the very epitome of physical manliness, much more so than in ""The Prestige,"" the stage musical ""The Boy from Oz,"" or even ""X-Men: the Last Stand""), a cattle driver as tough and rugged as the land, to whom Lady Sarah becomes infatuated soon when he gives her a ride in his truck soon after her arrival in the country, as prearranged -- and soon after he wins a knock-down, drag-out brawl at a local bar. Drover is the practical answer to Lady Sarah's progressive ideology. Where she is the optimist, what would today be considered liberal, who feels society's standards must change, he is a pragmatist whose eyes are colored by tradition and Australia's status quo; he's not necessarily against change, he just can't imagine it would happen. He soon shows her the feeling is mutual, and Nullah effectively becomes their adopted son. Drover is rather like John Wayne in any number of old Hollywood westerns, though more sexed-up, with Jackman's big, hairy muscles, frequently seen with no shirt. The main drawback to their relationship is that it seems the chemistry between the two leads is sometimes lacking, especially early on.Their shared goal is to make something more of the scrappy cattle business now run by Lady Sarah -- a.k.a., ""The Boss"" (except while herding the cattle, at which point Drover assumes that role, unquestionably) and defy the ruthless tactics of their more successful rival, King Carney (Bryan Brown) and his cruel-hearted deputy Neil Fletcher (a cold-bloodedly villainous David Wenham, who previously appeared in a different kind of role within a different kind of Australian western, ""The Proposition"")The film, several years in the making, was clearly a labor of love for Luhrmann, his Bazmark team and, it seems, the cast. Their devotion to it shows, just like in all his previous efforts. Luhrmann and the principal cast, including Kidman and Jackman, probably had more invested in this film, emotionally, than usual, since it focuses on the country from which they hail.At its stylistic heart, ""Australia"" is a Hollywood production of epic proportions. A widescreen presentation that is CinemaScope-esque. A meaty running time (clocking in at about two hours and forty-five minutes) that doesn't feel long. A huge country populated by people with huge personalities, ideas, and muscles. Big social issues. Lavish parties. Epic sequences of suspense and action (the bar-room brawl spills out into the dusty streets and seems to involve all the men in the town; later there's a stampede at cliff-side; a perilous no-man's-land desert crossing, and, finally, a massive air raid). ""Small"" or even ""average"" is clearly not in this film's vocabulary. It's more reminiscent of films like ""The Searchers,"" ""Giant,"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia."" In many ways its visual and tonal aesthetic seems rooted in classic films such as these and others.But, this is also a film by Baz Luhrmann, so the images we see are not merely grand, but super-stylized, sumptuous, and over-the-top, more restrained than in ""Moulin Rouge!"" but by no means reserved. And, except where noted as inappropirate above, that's not a criticism. Shots that I'm sure were already impressive with their high-gloss sheen and glorious views are given further lift by impressive digital special effects, well-done in that they blend in with the fantasy elements of the story. Technically, the film is engrossing and superb.When all is said and done, this movie, despite the issues it addresses, is not really a history lesson. At its heart lies the classic Hollywood spirit of pure, old-fashioned cinematic entertainment, in all its big, brash glory.",3,Australia: A Review. 3-1/2 Stars.,1233187200,"01 29,

He was magic on the screen, so moving and lovable, that I just wanted to hug and kiss him (reminded me a bit of my adorable nephew Layth) -- and adopt him.  He was so precious!

There is solid chemistry between Kidman and Jackman as a pair of opposites who have to take a herd of cattle through difficult Australian terrain and ultimately become familiar with the Aboriginal oppression.  I guess I have a bit of a biased view since I am a fan of Baz Luhrmann's work. I loved Moulin Rouge and his modern take on Romeo and Juliet, and thought that those films had such a ""larger than life"" feel about them. Luhrmann can take a very simple story and build it up to a grandiose scale, and he does that with Australia, with lush scenery, wonderfully crafted landscapes, and classy storytelling and cinematography. Anyone who enjoys Luhrmann will also love his use of music and songs amid the story, and he does so also in this one, employing a kind of Wizard of Oz theme to it. The song ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" comes to be associated with the plight of young Aboriginal boy Nullah, and although it may seem a tad over the top to some, it comes to be the ""song"" that that Nullah sings to Lady Ashley to keep their spirits up. The director seemed to be paying homage to the big epic films of the past, and there is a nostalgic feel while Australia that made it ""work"", at least to me.If there is one knock against the film, it was its length. At two hours and forty minutes, there are some scenes that just tend to drag on a little too long for effect.

Part Western and part War in the Pacific, there is something for everyone: romance, sweeping landscapes, cattle drives, stampedes, bush fires, a slice of history with Zeros attacking the port-city of Darwin [These war sequences were especially effective.], and a strong dose of magical realism. Hugh Jackman is the perfect handsome brooding hero, and, as the movie progressed, Nicole Kidman became a splendidly intrepid, if predictable, heroine. The young indigenous Australian boy, always under threat of being relocated, was engaging enough to gain one's empathy. I also found the wide range of ethnic ""cowboys"" to be particularly interesting.If the film had a weakness, I would say that it fell into two categories, characterisation and moral message: The villain was unrelentingly villainous (to the point of cliche, gnashing his teeth and glaring at the heroine). Furthermore, the respectable citizens of seemed a bit too obviously snooty to be credible.  Finally, the moral was laid on with a rather heavy trowel (The ""No Place Like Home"" scenes from the Wizard of Oz, and the playing of Elgar's ""Nimrod"" when the boy regains his heritage as he goes on walkabout at the end of the film seemed engineered to set the tears spilling down one's cheeks).Nevertheless, with the Blu-Ray technique, which enhances the spectacular cinematography, this Australian ""Western""-cum-World War II film presents a worthwhile several hours of viewing.

1227968,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001PPGAIA,Grady Harp,"[0, 2]","Baz Luhrmann needed to re-think his overly long epic of life in Australia during WW II: The first hour of this  165 minute film comes across as caricature with Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman being introduced as rather overblown, preposterous characters about whom the audience could care less.  But then suddenly the mood changes, the film becomes tender and real and issues of importance are treated well and presto! - an entirely different film is on the screen.  It would be interesting to see this film edited by a major editor who could comb away the extraneous silliness of the beginning and make this film far more dramatic and solid.Though the film begins in 1939 and continues into 1941, it feels like an old American Western flick with cattle drives, and rancher disputes and the development of a classy Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman)  from England traveling to her husband's ranch in Australia to face the failing of her inheritance, becoming involved with the politics of her competitor, finding support from her household of Aborigines who manage her ranch with the able assistance of a rowdy Drover (Hugh Jackman).  One important key element in the film is the emphasis on half breed children (half Aborigine, half Caucasian) who are called creamies and who are shunned by both sides of their inherited genes.  One lad Nullah (Brandon Walter) feels he has no one who cares for him outside of a kindly spirit grandfather King George (David Gulpilil) who gives him support from the shadows of the hills of the Aboriginal land.  The interesting part of the film is the manner in which this young boy pulls the other characters together, even during the Japanese invasion in 1941.  At this point the film becomes an epic worth watching and one accompanied by warmth and tenderness as evil is destroyed and the milk of human kindness rises.Once out of their caricature beginnings, Kidman and Jackman (and Walter) give fine performances.  They are aided by some fine effects from cinematographer Mandy Walker and by a musical score by David Hirschfelder that mixes excerpts from 'Somewhere over the rainbow' with Bach's Hunt cantata BWV 208 ('Sheep may safely graze') and of course the wondrously emotional Nimrod from Elgar's 'Enigma Variations'.  There are elements of information about racism and greed that are treated well.  And by the time this lengthy film is over the audience is left satisfied.  So 5 stars for the second part of this movie and 2 - 3 stars for the first hour  gives if a 4 star overall rating.

I've gotta give it two stars because it looks so good and because Kidman and Jackman do their best with the cliches they are required to recite from the vapid script.  This film is inordinantly long and you will find that after two hours you are very much ready for it to end.  Unfortunately it has almost another hour to go.  It lurches drunkenly between bad comedy and tearjerker melodrama in the space of 5 minutes leaving the viewer wondering just what sort of film he is watching.  Actually this is two films, with the first 90 minutes being devoted to a very dull but attractively photographed cattle drive and then switching gears to become an examination of racism in 1940's Australia.  And did I mention that the first half hour of the film is a comedy?  You may not remember the comedy so much after the Japanese Air Force attacks Australia and bombs a childrens home though. You may also wonder at all the magical mystical powers on display from the indiginous folks in the film. There is also a weird little kid who plays harmonica, has an obsession with the WIZARD OF OZ and (from the sound of his voice and pronuciation) will apparently grow up to be JarJar Binks.  There is simply too much going on in AUSTRALIA for one film to handle and too many different shifts in tone.  The story is simply a series of cliches and stereotypes and ""movie"" situations.

I counted at least thirty lines of dialogue in this movie that were stolen from other films (""Just because I am a woman doesn't mean I'm not as capable as a man."" ""Without love, you have nothing."" etc.). When the film isn't spitting out one visual or verbal cliche after another, it's inflicting one of the most annoyingly precocious child actors in the history of film on the audience. At one point, it appears that the aborigine boy (who serves as the voice over narrator!) has been shot. I yelled out, ""Thank god he's dead finally!""Nicole Kidman does her usual ice princess routine here - is she acting or was it all of those scientological counseling sessions? Hugh Jackman takes off his shirt and shows us he is a hunk. Of course, they hate each other at first but this is the movies and - SURPRISE! - they end up falling in love. There's just one problem, though. Outside of being the only two attractive people in that area of the outback (the aborigine women look like  - well, primates), there's absolutely no reason for these two to be together. Must have been desperate lust.You won't give a darn about Kidman getting her cattle to market in time to save her ranch. You just won't care. You won't care if the annoying child actor becomes a servant of the elite or is allowed to run off with his grandfather. You won't give a darn about that either. At the end of this bloated and sophomoric attempt at an epic movie, you will only care that you have wasted three hours of your life.Added note: the movie tries to make us believe that the aborigines can do magic. I find the suggestion that native peoples have supernatural powers or knowledge that ""white"" people have lost because they are ""civilized"" to be absurd. If you want to see magic, go to Florida and watch the space shuttle take off. Forget about the wackos who think that aborigines can stop cattle from stampeding with ESP. I wish those ""white"" people who pine away for native shamanic knowledge would strip off their clothes and run off with these savages and see just what kind of harsh lives these people live. Since the average life span of these people is usually 30 or so (I guess all of that supposed magic isn't helping them too much with life extension.), we could cull humanity of these New Age nutjobs pretty quickly.",2,"Hackneyed, weak, dull",1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,2506,"['Take', 'Out', 'Africa', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Far', 'Far', 'Away', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'throw', 'food', 'processor', 'run', 'blend', 'minute', 'will', 'have', 'dull', 'cliche', 'ridden', 'limp', 'epic', 'counted', 'least', 'thirty', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'were', 'stolen', 'other', 'films', 'Just', 'am', 'woman', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'m"", 'not', 'as', 'capable', 'man', 'love', 'have', 'nothing', 'etc.', 'When', 'film', ""n't"", 'spitting', 'out', 'one', 'visual', 'verbal', 'cliche', 'inflicting', 'one', 'most', 'annoyingly', 'precocious', 'child', 'actors', 'history', 'film', 'audience', 'one', 'point', 'aborigine', 'boy', 'who', 'voice', 'narrator', 'been', 'shot', 'yelled', 'out', 'Thank', 'god', 'dead', 'finally', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'usual', 'ice', 'princess', 'routine', 'here', 'acting', 'was', 'scientological', 'counseling', 'sessions', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'shirt', 'hunk', 'course', 'hate', 'other', 'first', 'movies', 'SURPRISE', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'just', 'one', 'problem', 'though', 'being', 'only', 'two', 'attractive', 'people', 'area', 'outback', 'aborigine', 'women', 'look', 'well', 'primates', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'two', 'be', 'together', 'Must', 'have', 'been', 'desperate', 'lust.You', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'darn', 'Kidman', 'getting', 'cattle', 'market', 'time', 'save', 'ranch', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'annoying', 'child', 'actor', 'servant', 'elite', 'allowed', 'run', 'off', 'grandfather', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'darn', 'end', 'bloated', 'sophomoric', 'attempt', 'epic', 'movie', 'will', 'only', 'care', 'have', 'wasted', 'three', 'hours', 'life.Added', 'note', 'movie', 'make', 'believe', 'aborigines', 'can', 'do', 'magic', 'find', 'suggestion', 'native', 'peoples', 'have', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'knowledge', 'white', 'people', 'have', 'lost', 'are', 'civilized', 'be', 'absurd', 'want', 'see', 'magic', 'go', 'Florida', 'watch', 'space', 'shuttle', 'take', 'off', 'Forget', 'wackos', 'who', 'think', 'aborigines', 'can', 'stop', 'cattle', 'stampeding', 'ESP', 'wish', 'white', 'people', 'who', 'pine', 'away', 'native', 'shamanic', 'knowledge', 'would', 'strip', 'off', 'clothes', 'run', 'off', 'savages', 'see', 'just', 'what', 'kind', 'harsh', 'lives', 'people', 'live', 'average', 'life', 'span', 'people', 'usually', '30', 'so', 'guess', 'supposed', 'magic', ""n't"", 'helping', 'too', 'much', 'life', 'extension', 'could', 'cull', 'humanity', 'New', 'Age', 'nutjobs', 'pretty', 'quickly']",N/A

Perskie ""ceruleana""","[4, 5]","""Australia"" is an epic film, reminiscent of ""Gone With The Wind,"" and ""Hawaii,"" with perhaps, a touch of the fabulous non-epic ""African Queen."" The combination of director and screenwriter Baz Luhrmann and Nicole Kidman is a winning one. Although ""Australia"" is far different from their collaborative effort in ""Moulin Rouge,"" (2001), I enjoyed this unconventional Aussie flick every bit as much. And what could be bad: with rousing action, sweeping landscapes, (kudos to cinematographer Mandy Walker), fabulous costumes, a hero's hero, a heroine worthy of the title, tear-jerking, dramatic kitsch, love, hate, loss, racism, war, a really nasty villain, Australian and Aboriginal history and culture, and so much more?  I say ""BOO"" to the professional critics who panned the film, Most people I know really liked it - men as well as women - so I won't bother to call this a chick flick. I never listen to these critics anyway. This is fun movie!Nullah, a young boy of mixed race - part aborigine, part Caucasian - is our narrator. He is nothing but wonderful in this role. Nullah is the grandson of King George, (David Gulpilil), an aboriginal shaman who teaches him the magical culture of their people. Nullah and his indigenous family are always on guard against the white ""cops,"" who want to take the countries ""creamies,"" (half breeds, usually illigimate), away from their native people and transport them to Mission Island to be educated in Western culture and religion.Just before the beginning of WWII, Lady Sarah Ashley, (Kidman), leaves the luxury of her English home to search for her estranged husband, who runs a remote cattle ranch, ""Far Away Downs,"" located in Australia's Northern Territory. Lady Sarah is determined to sell the ranch/station and drag hubby back to civilization. She arrives and storms into a local saloon looking for a man called ""Drover,"" (Hugh Jackman), who is supposed to meet her and drive her to ""Far Away Downs."" And Drover is so not what she expected.After a 3 day drive through the outback, which really ruffles the aristocratic lady's sensibilities, not to mention her elegant clothes and make-up, she reaches her destination only to find her husband dead, murdered. King George is accused of the crime. Lord Ashley had been attempting to break the monopoly on providing the military with beef held by King Carney, (Bryan Brown), a local bigwig. Carney, who seems to run everything in the area, is looking to have Lady Sarah sell him the ranch at a fraction of its worth, and doesn't care what he or his lackeys have to do to force the sale. After checking-out how things are being run at the ranch, and meeting young Nullah, Lady Sarah, uncharacteristically, decides to stay and make some serious changes.This film is obviously a labor of love by the director, cast and crew, who are mostly Australian and proud of it! I am always a fan of art, film and otherwise, created with lots of heart. Probably the best moments, for me, are those which deal with the aboriginal culture and the story of ""the stolen generations,"" children of mixed race, who during the 19th century and part of the 20th, were forcibly separated from their cultures by white Australians to ""civilize"" them.Again, I really like ""Australia.""

1227981,A96AUNSF6GESO,B001PPGAIA,Janeite,"[1, 3]","I didn't know what to expect from this film from the mixed bag of reviews I'd seen and heard. Before the film's release, I'd heard about this really BIG, old-fashioned movie about Australia coming out, but once it did all I heard was silence. I don't know one person who went to see it at the theater. So my husband and I rented it and we rather enjoyed it. It's VERY long, almost 3 hours, but the time passed quickly as the story held our interest. It does kind of bounce around from plotline to plotline, but we were interested the whole time and felt we wanted to watch it again when it was over. I was a little disappointed with Nichole Kidman. She's usually so incredibly wonderful, but she seems to have had some ""work"" done on her face so that her facial movements looked awkward and her expressiveness was hindered. She just didn't look natural at all, and I found myself distracted by looking at her odd lips and cheeks. Also, as with many modern movies, the CG effects are so heavy handed that they don't look real at all and (to me) take away from the sense of reality in the film. Hugh Jackman is divine, though. Hunky, muscular, and rough in all the right places, his Drover is the perfect Australian souvenir. I wonder if real Australians found this character stereotypical, because it seemed the director was using the Drover to symbolize Australia to the the viewer. He was a rough-and-tumble bloke who never shied away from a fight, had liberated views about the Aboriginal people, and turned into a dashing hero when the moment called for it. So overall, I will recommend the movie as a good choice for movie night at your house. I think kids might even enjoy it though mine weren't home when we watched it. There is a good bit of violence and a lot of deaths (SPOILER WARNING: a mother dies trying to save her child and a man is trampled by cows and looks pretty gross after) that may disturb the little ones or the squeamish, and there is one sex scene but no ""naughty parts"" are visible.

A period in history almost unknown to anyone outside of Australia.  It should have been an epic film.  Unfortunately it also has continuity errors as long as your arm, history errors, poor match move and CGI and mistakes that wouldn't be made in film school such as using the black and white 1955 version of Wizard of Oz instead of the sepia tone of the original 1939 movie.

""Moulin Rouge"" comes to mind. But like ""Moulin Rouge,"" his latest epic, ""Australia,"" is saddled with debt for FOX Studios and the shooting of three endings, one of which was reportedly so hard for the test audiences that they had to change the ending. This is rarely done in Hollywood anymore. But after spending nearly $150 million on this film, FOX and Luhrmann both are desperate for a hit. It comes out at a time that is beneficial for movie audiences. Of course it'll be a hit in Australia itself. Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman, both Aussie natives, have been down under promoting and praising the great film and also the Australians are anxious to see a film that paints their history on the world stage for a change. Aussies have an incredible history just as America. Like America, they get lost in many epic film stories in Europe and Asia. There are countless stories of The Holy Wars of Europe, the Persian Empire and even Alexander the Great. But this is Australia's first time leading the pack in the storytelling of their own history, independent of Great Britain and any other nation.Kidman is good in her role, but Hugh Jackman is the heart and soul of the film. It almost seemed as though it was not expected or planned, but Jackman brilliantly downplays many scenes and comes off the victor in the film when it comes to showcasing talent. This may be the film that revives Kidman's career, but it is the film that reminds movie goers that Jackman is not only the sexiest man alive, says People Magazine, but one of the most underrated actors of his generation. It's hard to get a headline when you have giants like Will Smith, Brad Pitt, Russell Crowe and Tom Cruise. But Hugh Jackman proves an old adage that Spencer Tracy once remarked. ""You should not play a role, you should live it."" Jackman may not have been trained by the greats like Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy and Laurence Olivier, but he surely channels them in his acting ability.FOX Studios official release states, ""In northern Australia prior to World War II, an English aristocrat inherits a cattle station the size of the U.S. State of Maryland. When English cattle barons plot to take her land, she reluctantly joins forces with a rough-hewn stock-man to drive 2,000 head of cattle across hundreds of miles of the country's most unforgiving land, only to still face the bombing of Darwin, Australia, by the Japanese forces that had attacked Pearl Harbor only months earlier.""Nicole Kidman's Lady Sarah Ashley is much like the actress, strikingly beautiful, with very soft features but a steely strength from within. Kidman, however, seems to play many roles the same way. Her range is only eclipsed by her beauty. Unlike Jackman, who in this role performs as no character I've ever seen him portray before. In addition, being handsome is almost an afterthought to the audience, because he lives this role.""Australia"" is going to have to compete over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend with the mega hit, ""Twilight."" But for those who are history buffs, those who are fans of Hugh Jackman and want to see a movie that is reminiscent of John Wayne's great epic ""Red River,"" I suggest you spend your hard earned money seeing this film. We won't know if Baz Luhrmann is vindicated until the numbers come in from the weekend Box Office tally. But as a genius who knows how to write and direct a film, he gets it. He achieved his goal.""Australia"" gets Four and a half of Five Stars. The deficit is very minor and Jackman's acting makes up for any lack that any of his costars may share with us. Go see this film, it's really a blockbuster.",5,Canyon News Editor Tommy Lightfoot Garret Loved Hugh Jackman in.....,1243641600,"05 30, 2009",2009,3939,"['Tommy', 'Garrett', 'wrote', 'following', 'review', 'Australia', 'Canyon', 'News', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'paper', 'last', 'fall.Film', 'Australia', 'Big', 'Screen', 'VersionBy', 'Tommy', 'Garrett', 'Editor', 'Canyon', 'NewsNov', '30', '2008', '8:36:32', 'PMWhen', 'genius', 'very', 'independent', 'film', 'director', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'work', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'epic', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'mind', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'latest', 'epic', 'Australia', 'saddled', 'debt', 'FOX', 'Studios', 'shooting', 'three', 'endings', 'one', 'was', 'reportedly', 'so', 'hard', 'test', 'audiences', 'had', 'change', 'ending', 'rarely', 'done', 'Hollywood', 'anymore', 'spending', 'nearly', '150', 'million', 'film', 'FOX', 'Luhrmann', 'are', 'desperate', 'hit', 'out', 'time', 'beneficial', 'movie', 'audiences', 'course', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hit', 'Australia', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Aussie', 'natives', 'have', 'been', 'down', 'promoting', 'praising', 'great', 'film', 'also', 'Australians', 'are', 'anxious', 'see', 'film', 'history', 'world', 'stage', 'change', 'Aussies', 'have', 'incredible', 'history', 'just', 'America', 'America', 'get', 'lost', 'many', 'epic', 'film', 'stories', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'are', 'countless', 'stories', 'Holy', 'Wars', 'Europe', 'Persian', 'Empire', 'even', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'Australia', 'first', 'time', 'leading', 'pack', 'storytelling', 'own', 'history', 'independent', 'Great', 'Britain', 'other', 'nation.Kidman', 'good', 'role', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'heart', 'soul', 'film', 'almost', 'seemed', 'was', 'not', 'expected', 'planned', 'Jackman', 'brilliantly', 'many', 'scenes', 'off', 'victor', 'film', 'when', 'showcasing', 'talent', 'may', 'be', 'film', 'Kidman', 'career', 'film', 'movie', 'goers', 'Jackman', 'not', 'only', 'sexiest', 'man', 'alive', 'People', 'Magazine', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'actors', 'generation', 'hard', 'get', 'headline', 'when', 'have', 'giants', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'old', 'adage', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'once', 'remarked', 'should', 'not', 'play', 'role', 'should', 'live', 'Jackman', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'trained', 'greats', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'surely', 'acting', 'ability.FOX', 'Studios', 'official', 'release', 'states', 'northern', 'Australia', 'prior', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'English', 'aristocrat', 'cattle', 'station', 'size', 'U.S.', 'State', 'Maryland', 'When', 'English', 'cattle', 'barons', 'plot', 'take', 'land', 'reluctantly', 'forces', 'rough-hewn', 'stock-man', 'drive', '2,000', 'head', 'cattle', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'country', 'most', 'unforgiving', 'land', 'only', 'still', 'face', 'bombing', 'Darwin', 'Australia', 'Japanese', 'forces', 'had', 'attacked', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'only', 'months', 'earlier', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'Ashley', 'much', 'actress', 'strikingly', 'beautiful', 'very', 'soft', 'features', 'steely', 'strength', 'Kidman', 'however', 'play', 'many', 'roles', 'same', 'way', 'range', 'only', 'eclipsed', 'beauty', 'Jackman', 'who', 'role', 'character', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'portray', 'before', 'addition', 'being', 'handsome', 'almost', 'afterthought', 'audience', 'role', 'Australia', 'going', 'have', 'compete', 'Thanksgiving', 'holiday', 'weekend', 'mega', 'hit', 'Twilight', 'who', 'are', 'history', 'buffs', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'reminiscent', 'John', 'Wayne', 'great', 'epic', 'Red', 'River', 'suggest', 'spend', 'hard', 'earned', 'money', 'seeing', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'vindicated', 'numbers', 'come', 'weekend', 'Box', 'Office', 'tally', 'genius', 'who', 'how', 'write', 'direct', 'film', 'achieved', 'goal', 'Australia', 'Four', 'half', 'Five', 'Stars', 'deficit', 'very', 'minor', 'Jackman', 'acting', 'up', 'lack', 'costars', 'may', 'share', 'Go', 'see', 'film', 'really', 'blockbuster']",N/A

The result was a very long film that at times was enthralling, and at others hideously dull and tedious.  To best convey the pace and tone of this movie, the rest of this review will be in the staccato style with which Morse code is delivered, mirroring a dreadful scene at the beginning of Australia that almost made me comatose.English aristocrat Lady Sarah's (Kidman) husband is in Australia.

Overall, however, Hugh Jackman was stellar.  He stole the show, but a great supporting role was turned in by Brandon Walters, who played an interracial child in the middle of every single story arc (except, of course, the romance).

Go in with high expectations and you're likely to get annoyed with certain aspects of the story.Basic Plot: A woman (Kidman) goes to Australia to meet up with her husband but discovers he's dead.  To save the farm she must drive the herd of cattle to market, and for this she enlists the help of the Drover (Jackman).The Good:  The cinematography is excellent, treating you to some tremendous vistas of the Australian outback.  And, in general, the performances from Jackman and Brandon Walters (the boy) are enjoyable.  There are several comedic moments along the way, and good use is made of Aboriginal lore.  All in all the movie rolls right along despite it's three hour girth (though I confess I did watch over the course of two nights).The Bad:  Kidman's performance is stiff and her chemistry with Jackman is marginal at best.  This isn't helped by those ridiculous new lips Kidman is sporting that look like a couple of greasy Kielbasas.  The storyline is contrived in places and and you can't help but wonder if the director was trying to write two stories.  The result is a jolting transition after the cattle drive that dumps you unceremoniously into part two of the story.Bottom Line: Australia isn't as good as Oprah would have you think or as bad as some critics make it out to be.

There's too many characters, and too many storylines, weaving in and out of it.The story feels confusing, and unrealistic from the start. The ""bad guys"" are weird, petty little men who just get caught up in this sad excuse for a movie; the lead roles are boring and their accents made me crazy. Everything feels as brittle and cheap as its CGI. Let me say, the stabs the director and writers made at drama (such as the cow-stampede scene, and the part where the fat man gets trampled... wow, that made me laugh my butt off), romance (Nicole and Hugh's characters are drunk when they first kiss... true romance? NOT), humor (What beautiful creatures... CRACK... dead kangaroo), and suspense (when all the mixed children survived the Jap shooting, I was like, REALLY?) ... well, let's just say it came off badly. Not to mention to bizarre story including the mixed boy's grandpa, who pops up and follows everyone like a little creepy stalker... he never really talks, and he kinda reminded me of Rafiki from the Lion King, you know?And it goes on for way too long, with what feels like multiple endings. Each character flits in and out of the story without much presence, and I found myself willing at least one character to be killed off so the movie would end. It literally feels endless, like the director had so many ideas he got carried away.I could go on and on, but you get the idea. It's so full of cliche, cheesy, sickeningly flimsy, stupid parts that... honestly, if this was to be a good movie, you'd have to trim it down so that only fifteen minutes were left. I am dead serious, it was a waste of my time. My eyes still kinda hurt from watching it for so long.So if you're bored and really are wondering what this movie is about? Watch it. But don't even dream of spending twenty bucks on this movie, it's quite a failure.

Baz Luhrmann's manic directing style, which worked pretty well for ""Moulin Rouge!"", is pretty distracting during the first half hour, but he eventually settles down and applies his crazy cuts and camera work more sparingly so we can get into the story.Anyway, it's all big sweeping stuff about cattle and romance and endless vistas and (finally) World War II, and there are actually three or four moments when your emotions will swell when it all comes together.  And the rest of the movie is tolerably watchable, if you take those breaks I mentioned.It's funny, though.  There's some solemn verbiage at the beginning of the movie about the issue of Aboriginal relocation (sort of Australia's version of how we treated our American Indian population, I think) and a little more verbiage about it at the end, as if the movie wants to convince us that it's really about this dark issue from Australia's past.  It's funny because the very long movie that appears between those two moments of onscreen verbiage is 95% concerned with Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman and whether they'll get together, with maybe six minutes (tops!) of the running time devoted to the Aboriginal relocation issue.  I had to laugh.I will say that the standard DVD I watched had spectacular picture and sound, so this sucker must look and sound really great on Blu-Ray.  Hey, good presentation always helps with those types of long movies (like this one) that never quite make you forget you're watching a long movie.In the end, let's just call ""Australia"" a tolerable, pretty good movie, no more and no less.

What a disappointing use of nearly three hours.However, the movie was worth watching for these things:1. The actor who played Nulla--the best acting and the best character. I was charmed by that lovely child.2. Learning that aborigines were (are?) treated just as distastefully and condescendingly in Australia as African-Americans once were in this country. Mixed race children fared worse than full-blooded whites or blacks because they didn't belong to one group and weren't accepted by the other.3. The story is set at the time of World War II when walk-abouts were practiced by aborigines. I wonder if the custom is still followed.4.

Hugh Jackman looks great without a shirt, but he simply lacks the right sex appeal in this role, or was it being paired with Kidman that makes him so blah? What that role needed was Gerard Butler or someone like Clark Gable.4. What was with Kidman and Jackman in their kissing scenes? What dead kisses!

In fact I wonder what Australians make of Australia, which seems to involve just one patch of the continent (the Northern Territory), when you would think it would be possible to involve all the Australian states?  Anyhow the story is pretty vast as is, and basically it's held together by a pretty tough racialized storyline involving the ""stolen generations,"" aboriginal children claimed by the state and brought up in orphanages away from their families.The story is told largely from the point of view of Nullah, son of an Aboriginal mother and a white dad, and therefore left feeling that he belongs nowhere.  Watched over from afar by his grandfather, little Nullah has a vague, pagan sense of cause and effect; for an American speaker his imagery of singing and fate and a violent liberty seems intoxicatingly difficult and offkilter, and maybe this soupcon of the unknown (even the ""exotic"" if you will) gives the otherwise stock romantic plot between Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman a new dimension.  After all, one can no longer believe that the romantic trials of a drover and an aristocratic Mrs. Boss should take central stage when so much else is going on in the world--so much injustice and so much bigoted cruelty.Kidman's character arc as Lady Sarah Ashley is like something out of an 80s'Goldie Hawn movie--pampered princess learns about life as it's lived in the dirt--but I suppose it was Scarlett O'Hara's too, tearing into the earth for a single turnip and swearing never to go hungry again.  Meanwhile a parade of Australia's top actors, including Jack Thompson, Bryan Brown, David Wenham, and even David Gulpilil (from Walkabout, The Last Wave, Rabbit-Proof Fence and Crocodile Dundee) take minor and major roles, so the movie also has some of the fun factor of George Stevens' Greatest Story Ever Told, with John Wayne as the Centurion.  There isn't one thing about Australia I didn't love--except for the horrid Elton John song that plays over the final credits.  Why, Baz, why, was this some secret gay tradeoff?  Outside of that gaffe, I spent the last hour and a half of the movie in tears, it was like the heavens opened and rained on my face, and I can barely remember a time when I did not live in Darwin and squadrons of highly trained Japanese pilots were not pouring down colorful bombs and destroying every evil person in town and breaking the prisons wide open.There weren't too many people in the theater when I saw Australia and I hope this isn't a sign of the movie not doing well.  It has had some totally unfair reviews.  Then I recall that the third, fourth, sixth, seventh and eighth times I saw Moulin Rouge the theater wasn't all that packed either.Those reviews made me think, going in, that I wouldn't be enjoying the film, and I can report that this was not the case.  It was fantastic and beautiful and wonderfully done.  OK, it's not for everyone.  But for me, it was the movie of the year and I only wish that Elton had just said, no thanks Baz Luhrmann.",5,Movie of the Year,1228176000,"12 2, 2008",2008,3178,"['Australia', 'followup', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'bigger', 'antecedecents', 'lie', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Titanic', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'Reds', 'big', 'pictures', 'told', 'national', 'scale', 'fact', 'wonder', 'what', 'Australians', 'make', 'Australia', 'involve', 'just', 'one', 'patch', 'continent', 'Northern', 'Territory', 'when', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'possible', 'involve', 'Australian', 'states', 'Anyhow', 'story', 'pretty', 'vast', 'basically', 'held', 'together', 'pretty', 'tough', 'racialized', 'storyline', 'involving', 'stolen', 'generations', 'aboriginal', 'children', 'claimed', 'state', 'brought', 'up', 'orphanages', 'away', 'families.The', 'story', 'told', 'largely', 'point', 'view', 'Nullah', 'son', 'Aboriginal', 'mother', 'white', 'dad', 'therefore', 'left', 'feeling', 'nowhere', 'Watched', 'afar', 'grandfather', 'little', 'Nullah', 'vague', 'pagan', 'sense', 'cause', 'effect', 'American', 'speaker', 'imagery', 'singing', 'fate', 'violent', 'liberty', 'intoxicatingly', 'difficult', 'offkilter', 'maybe', 'soupcon', 'unknown', 'even', 'exotic', 'will', 'otherwise', 'stock', 'romantic', 'plot', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'new', 'dimension', 'one', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'believe', 'romantic', 'trials', 'drover', 'aristocratic', 'Mrs.', 'Boss', 'should', 'take', 'central', 'stage', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'else', 'going', 'world', 'so', 'much', 'injustice', 'so', 'much', 'bigoted', 'cruelty.Kidman', 'character', 'arc', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'Ashley', 'something', ""80s'Goldie"", 'Hawn', 'movie', 'pampered', 'princess', 'about', 'life', 'lived', 'dirt', 'suppose', 'was', 'Scarlett', ""O'Hara"", 'too', 'tearing', 'earth', 'single', 'turnip', 'swearing', 'never', 'go', 'hungry', 'again', 'Meanwhile', 'parade', 'Australia', 'top', 'actors', 'including', 'Jack', 'Thompson', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'David', 'Wenham', 'even', 'David', 'Gulpilil', 'Walkabout', 'Last', 'Wave', 'Rabbit-Proof', 'Fence', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'take', 'minor', 'major', 'roles', 'movie', 'also', 'fun', 'factor', 'George', 'Stevens', 'Greatest', 'Story', 'Ever', 'Told', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Centurion', ""n't"", 'one', 'thing', 'Australia', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'horrid', 'Elton', 'John', 'song', 'final', 'credits', 'Why', 'Baz', 'why', 'was', 'secret', 'gay', 'tradeoff', 'gaffe', 'spent', 'last', 'hour', 'half', 'movie', 'tears', 'was', 'heavens', 'opened', 'rained', 'face', 'can', 'barely', 'remember', 'time', 'when', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'Darwin', 'squadrons', 'highly', 'trained', 'Japanese', 'pilots', 'were', 'not', 'pouring', 'down', 'colorful', 'bombs', 'destroying', 'evil', 'person', 'town', 'breaking', 'prisons', 'wide', 'open.There', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'people', 'theater', 'when', 'saw', 'Australia', 'hope', ""n't"", 'sign', 'movie', 'not', 'doing', 'well', 'had', 'totally', 'unfair', 'reviews', 'Then', 'recall', 'third', 'fourth', 'sixth', 'seventh', 'eighth', 'times', 'saw', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'theater', 'was', ""n't"", 'packed', 'either.Those', 'reviews', 'made', 'think', 'going', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'enjoying', 'film', 'can', 'report', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'was', 'fantastic', 'beautiful', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'OK', 'not', 'everyone', 'was', 'movie', 'year', 'only', 'wish', 'Elton', 'had', 'just', 'said', 'thanks', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann']",N/A

1228023,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B001PPGAIA,magellan,"[3, 4]","This movie is perhaps the most mixed bag of a flick I've ever seen. It has some good points, and bad points, and a lot of in-between. But this fully 180 minute movie is so sprawling and disjointed in its epic sort of way that it's hard to know where to start.So before writing this review, I read some of the 1 star and 5 star reviews just to see what the extremes were like, and some of the negative ones are quite negative and others quite funny, such as the Australian reviewer who called it a bunch of kangaroo dung, and another reviewer who said the movie is sort of like Gone with the Wind meets The Road Warrior. LOL. On the other hand, many of the 5 star reviews compare it to some of the great adventure epics of earlier years.Well, a great movie it is not, but I wouldn't call it a bunch of kangaroo dung, either. For me I would have to say the bottom line is that the movie, although it had a lot of potential, just doesn't quite get off the ground, for several reasons. Set against the backdrop of the rugged cattle ranching culture of the Northern Territory, the clash of cultures between the white man and the aborigines, and the impending Japanese bombing of Darwin, there was certainly a lot of potential for real drama, action, and emotion. But the disjointed story line is too patchy and disorganized. It's as if the director was trying to do too much, and in doing so failed to deal with any one subject really well.For example, one problem was the attempt to positively portray the aboriginal culture which just comes off as superficial and contrived. Another is the romance between Jackman and Kidman's characters, which falls somewhat flat, although not completely so, but they just don't seem to have a whole lot of chemistry together. There are too many characters in the film to really develop well, and as a result they all end up a bit too stereotypical and shallow and you don't care about any of them.Many people complained about the many CGI generated scenes and backdrops that looked too fake and cheesy but I didn't mind that too much; there was enough beautiful cinematography to compensate for that, and in fact, the cinematography is one of the strong points of the film. You get a good feel for the Australian countryside and it's sheer size, beauty, and dangers. I'm just sorry the rest of the movie didn't work out better.As for the acting, Hugh Jackman is convincing as the laconic but intrepid drover who helps save Kidman's ranch, but Kidman's character (an aristocratic blueblood from England) is too melodramatic and over the top. No doubt pre-WWII Australia wasn't exactly the Ritz, but Kidman seems to spend half of the movie with a look of sheer horror plastered on her face at the barbarity and primitiveness of the place.Finally, much of the dialog is lackluster and just falls flat, although Jackman and Kidman try valiantly to make it work. And the sound track, although there are some nice sections, overall just didn't add much to the movie.Overall, not a terrible movie but one that fell considerably short of its potential. I would give it 2.5 stars if I could but I give it three here since the movie tries hard and I just like anything about Australia no matter how bad it is.",3,A very mixed bag,1257206400,"11 3, 2009",2009,3232,"['movie', 'perhaps', 'most', 'mixed', 'bag', 'flick', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'good', 'points', 'bad', 'points', 'lot', 'in-between', 'fully', '180', 'minute', 'movie', 'so', 'sprawling', 'disjointed', 'epic', 'sort', 'way', 'hard', 'know', 'where', 'start.So', 'writing', 'review', 'read', '1', 'star', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'extremes', 'were', 'negative', 'ones', 'are', 'quite', 'negative', 'others', 'quite', 'funny', 'such', 'Australian', 'reviewer', 'who', 'called', 'bunch', 'kangaroo', 'dung', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'movie', 'sort', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Road', 'Warrior', 'LOL', 'other', 'hand', 'many', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'compare', 'great', 'adventure', 'epics', 'earlier', 'years.Well', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'bunch', 'kangaroo', 'dung', 'either', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'off', 'ground', 'several', 'reasons', 'Set', 'backdrop', 'rugged', 'cattle', 'ranching', 'culture', 'Northern', 'Territory', 'clash', 'cultures', 'white', 'man', 'aborigines', 'impending', 'Japanese', 'bombing', 'Darwin', 'was', 'certainly', 'lot', 'potential', 'real', 'drama', 'action', 'emotion', 'disjointed', 'story', 'line', 'too', 'patchy', 'disorganized', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'doing', 'so', 'failed', 'deal', 'one', 'subject', 'really', 'well.For', 'example', 'one', 'problem', 'was', 'attempt', 'positively', 'portray', 'aboriginal', 'culture', 'just', 'off', 'superficial', 'contrived', 'romance', 'Jackman', 'Kidman', 'characters', 'somewhat', 'flat', 'not', 'completely', 'so', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'whole', 'lot', 'chemistry', 'together', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'film', 'really', 'develop', 'well', 'result', 'end', 'up', 'bit', 'too', 'stereotypical', 'shallow', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'them.Many', 'people', 'complained', 'many', 'CGI', 'generated', 'scenes', 'backdrops', 'looked', 'too', 'fake', 'cheesy', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'enough', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'compensate', 'fact', 'cinematography', 'one', 'strong', 'points', 'film', 'get', 'good', 'feel', 'Australian', 'countryside', 'sheer', 'size', 'beauty', 'dangers', ""'m"", 'just', 'sorry', 'rest', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'better.As', 'acting', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'convincing', 'laconic', 'intrepid', 'drover', 'who', 'save', 'Kidman', 'ranch', 'Kidman', 'character', 'aristocratic', 'blueblood', 'England', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'top', 'doubt', 'pre-WWII', 'Australia', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'Ritz', 'Kidman', 'spend', 'half', 'movie', 'look', 'sheer', 'horror', 'plastered', 'face', 'barbarity', 'primitiveness', 'place.Finally', 'much', 'dialog', 'lackluster', 'just', 'falls', 'flat', 'Jackman', 'Kidman', 'try', 'valiantly', 'make', 'work', 'sound', 'track', 'are', 'nice', 'sections', 'overall', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'movie.Overall', 'not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'one', 'fell', 'considerably', 'short', 'potential', 'would', 'give', '2.5', 'stars', 'could', 'give', 'three', 'here', 'movie', 'hard', 'just', 'anything', 'Australia', 'matter', 'how', 'bad']",N/A

Nicole Kidman stars as an English aristocrat who travels to the primitive, faraway continent to take over a a cattle ranch after her husband is killed.  Hugh Jackman is the rough-hewn cattle driver, who helps Nicole get her herd to market and, ultimately, wins her heart.  They make a handsome on-screen couple.Of course, there are villains (David Wenham, Bryon Brown) who try to prevent their cattle drive from succeeding, then there are also the Japanese who bomb the city of Darwin in a very impressive sequence.Luhrmann paints his story on a broad canvas and, in general, he succeeds.  However, I think that he should have rearranged the structure of the last 15-20 minutes of his film, because, as it now stands, the final confrontation with the story's lead heavy comes off as anti-climatic.

There behind her stands the big house of a western ranch, or tea or rubber plantation. A stoic strong man challenges her and their mutual attraction grows against a sweeping Technicolor canvas as the stereophonic lush romantic score swells to overwhelm our senses and pluck the quivering strings of our hearts. Sounds good doesn't it? This is the stuff of the silver age of Hollywood; the 1950's epics abound in these kinds of films. And now it is back in a BIG way.Yes, we have seen this before, and unfortunately done with more conviction and brilliance. And when it is done right it is pure movie magic. For instance the incomparable George Steven's ""Giant"", or the lesser ""Elephant Walk"", or even the soapy yet very exciting ""Naked Jungle"" these are the fathers of inspiration for Baz Lurhman's ""Australia"".This film is an ambitious effort that falls on its face under the weight of its director's choices to go way over the top too many times. Now don't get me wrong. I love over the top in my sweeping epics but in good and timely measures. Not from start to finish. It is just too much and becomes self-conscious and takes one out of the film experience.The most indulgent of these choices is the casting of Nicole Kidman in the lead. She is too old and her face has changed by some sort of strange process over the last few years as to become hard and well, a little scary. But that aside her performance is not an honest one, she plays the comedy at the begining of the film straight for laughs and that rings false. Comedy in this kind of film and with this kind of character should be played dead serious to make it work. You just don't believe her and her acting is showing all over the place.But there were some good things about the film. The boy who the story is really about is just a natural wonder, a pure old acting soul in a child that the camera loves. Hugh Jackman delivers all that is required in the male lead and in the process is natural and believable in the ""Rock Hudson - Charlton Heston"" mode.  The images of Australia are indeed stunning to behold and the cinematography is at times thrilling. But then she pops up in the shot with those puff lips and gives you a start.There are those things to recommend ""Australia"" and on a purely visual level you might give it a try.

It nostalgia in every sense of the word, in every frame. The acting style reminds us of Bogart, Grant, Bacall and Dunne. The story is epic in every way and just lovely.

Selznick managed to do with DUEL IN THE SUN--he's created a sprawling epic of a canvas for a narrow storyline about a woman who needs a man to keep the villains from double-crossing her in a land deal. It's the kind of story every B-western had in the old days, usually with someone like Roy Rogers or Gene Autry playing the cowboy who helps a girl keep her ranch from the outlaws who want it. Here the tale has been expanded to include racial overtones (which DUEL also had) and some good cattle drive scenes that teeter into cliff hanging territory.Of course, he's added bits of Australian history to the background of the story--such as the treatment of Aborigines whom the villain of the piece calls ""creamies"" and a World War II sequence of Japanese bombing an island off Australia and heading for Darwin. No expense has been spared to make these scenes look very realistic. For production values alone, it deserves a 7.A sensitive looking boy named BRANDON WALTERS is effective as the boy Nullah whom Kidman comes to love as her own son. Unfortunately, the scenes between Kidman and Walters are clumsily handled by the actress who seems to be forcing herself on the characterization of a woman uncertain of herself when relating to children. Her ""Over the Rainbow"" moment seems unauthentic.HUGH JACKMAN is great as the cowboy called Drover who is assigned to escort the British born Lady Ashley (NICOLE KIDMAN) on a cattle drive where she intends to get a handsome sum for her cattle. DAVID WENHAM makes an excellent villain as the man who opposes Kidman and Jackman all through the story, getting his comeuppance as all good villains eventually do.The sheer predictability of the tale is what hurts it most. We all know that Jackman and Kidman will be locking lips long before the fadeout and that Wenham will make a nasty exit. What we can't foresee is that the story will drift in all sorts of directions about racial inequalities and weird rituals with a bit of World War II bombings thrown in.The casting of the leads hurts the story. Jackman is fine and has obviously buffed up for the role but Kidman is the wrong actress for the part, unable to summon the sort of temperamental display that someone like Kate Winslet was able to do with the role of Rose in TITANIC. A stronger actress would have been a better choice.However, having said all this, there are plenty of gripping moments in ""Australia"" that make you wonder why the film isn't doing as well as it should at the box-office.

1228055,A1A4URTS77JHWN,B001PPGAIA,Paul Frandano,"[2, 2]","Baz Luhrmann is a brilliant expositor of his own cinematic vision, and Australia's Blu-Ray release is packed with mini-documentaries, introduced and annotated by Luhrmann, on every aspect of production - from location scouting through set design, cinematography (AND still photography), editing, music direction - indeed, everything EXCEPT casting but with a nice little historical documentary that validates the broad historical elements of the picture. Thus do Luhrmann, the abundantly talented Catherine Martin (co-producer, set and costume designer, and Luhrmann's wife), and other cast and crew have the time and space, courtesy of 20th Century Fox Blu-Ray, to amplify in words and (also High-Def) images  Luhrmann's capacious attempt to capture his country and its experience in film.I think that, for the most part, he succeeds.The movie itself divided critics into two camps: the merciless dismissives - who derided Luhrmann as, among other things, a purveyor of kitsch - and the swept-up romantics, who were pulled into the David Lean-esque epic scale and David O. Selznick-style old-fashioned narrative. I number myself among the swept-up. The first obligation of a director, or any one of a film's three or four auteurs - director, producer, writer, cinematographer - is to present moving images that actually grip our eyes and hold them to the screen. At this Luhrmann succeeds wildly - the picture, given its locations, lavish set design, historically accurate costumery, and luminosity of its stars is visually never less than stunning. The action sequences and visual effects fill the screen imaginatively - these Australian cowboys even RIDE differently than John Wayne, Ward Bond, and the whole John Ford gang - and make the 2 hours and 45 minutes literally zip by.And then there's Brandon Walters, the 13-year-old Aboriginal lad who looks 10 and literally carries away every scene he's in, a rousing, energetic, wholly convincing performance by a stunningly talented (not to mention absurdly photogenic, with eyes as large and expressive as...okay, Bambi's) young man. And credit Luhrmann with eliciting so compelling a performance from a first-time acting novice.And yes, of course, there's Nicole Kidman and Wolverine, who are just fine, and the welcome return of Bryan Brown to American screens and a nicely evil turn by David Wenham. But this is to me all icing on cake. The film's main, and most riveting, character is Australia itself - the sights, sounds, geological diversity, flora, and fauna. And for most American audiences, this is will be a (welcome) introduction to a spectacular continent and country and a national narrative that, at many points, parallels our own American story.In particular, Australia will introduce most non-Australian audiences to Australia's national tragedy of The Stolen Generation (for which Prime Minister Kevin Rudd apologized last year). But don't expect perfect historical accuracy - this is a ""Hollywoodized"" past, especially in its idealization of the ""good guys"" a-historical views on race relations  - or profundity. Australia is a historical romance that intends to tug at your heartstrings. In the English-speaking world, the tradition of knuckle-headed stories that pack genuine emotional wallop goes back at least to Shakespeare, who late in his authorial career wrote romances - The Tempest, Pericles, Prince of Tyre, The Winter's Tale - that were deliriously implausible and but deeply emotionally honest. Thus it is with Australia. And only a stony heart will fail to be moved by a wholly predictable, yet emotionally credible, conclusion.So, yeah, I thought this was a pretty neat picture that, in the context of all those condescendingly dismissive reviews, easily surpassed my low expectations. And placed before me images that I'll scarcely be able to forget.",4,Useful Blu-Ray Extras Enhance the Experience,1245456000,"06 20, 2009",2009,3838,"['Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'brilliant', 'expositor', 'own', 'cinematic', 'vision', 'Australia', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'packed', 'mini-documentaries', 'introduced', 'annotated', 'Luhrmann', 'aspect', 'production', 'location', 'scouting', 'set', 'design', 'cinematography', 'still', 'photography', 'editing', 'music', 'direction', 'indeed', 'everything', 'EXCEPT', 'casting', 'nice', 'little', 'historical', 'documentary', 'broad', 'historical', 'elements', 'picture', 'Thus', 'do', 'Luhrmann', 'abundantly', 'talented', 'Catherine', 'Martin', 'co-producer', 'set', 'costume', 'designer', 'Luhrmann', 'wife', 'other', 'cast', 'crew', 'have', 'time', 'space', 'courtesy', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'Blu-Ray', 'amplify', 'words', 'also', 'High-Def', 'Luhrmann', 'capacious', 'attempt', 'capture', 'country', 'experience', 'film.I', 'think', 'most', 'part', 'succeeds.The', 'movie', 'divided', 'critics', 'two', 'camps', 'merciless', 'who', 'derided', 'Luhrmann', 'other', 'things', 'purveyor', 'kitsch', 'swept-up', 'romantics', 'who', 'were', 'pulled', 'David', 'Lean-esque', 'epic', 'scale', 'David', 'O.', 'Selznick-style', 'old-fashioned', 'narrative', 'number', 'swept-up', 'first', 'obligation', 'director', 'one', 'film', 'three', 'four', 'auteurs', 'director', 'producer', 'writer', 'cinematographer', 'present', 'moving', 'images', 'actually', 'eyes', 'hold', 'screen', 'Luhrmann', 'wildly', 'picture', 'given', 'locations', 'lavish', 'set', 'design', 'historically', 'accurate', 'costumery', 'luminosity', 'stars', 'visually', 'never', 'less', 'stunning', 'action', 'sequences', 'visual', 'effects', 'fill', 'screen', 'imaginatively', 'Australian', 'cowboys', 'even', 'RIDE', 'differently', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'whole', 'John', 'Ford', 'make', '2', 'hours', '45', 'minutes', 'literally', 'zip', 'by.And', 'then', 'Brandon', 'Walters', '13-year-old', 'Aboriginal', 'lad', 'who', '10', 'literally', 'away', 'scene', 'rousing', 'energetic', 'wholly', 'convincing', 'performance', 'stunningly', 'talented', 'not', 'mention', 'absurdly', 'photogenic', 'eyes', 'large', 'expressive', 'okay', 'Bambi', 'young', 'man', 'credit', 'Luhrmann', 'eliciting', 'so', 'compelling', 'performance', 'first-time', 'acting', 'novice.And', 'yes', 'course', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Wolverine', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'fine', 'welcome', 'return', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'American', 'screens', 'nicely', 'evil', 'turn', 'David', 'Wenham', 'icing', 'cake', 'film', 'main', 'most', 'riveting', 'character', 'Australia', 'sights', 'geological', 'diversity', 'flora', 'fauna', 'most', 'American', 'audiences', 'will', 'be', 'welcome', 'introduction', 'spectacular', 'continent', 'country', 'national', 'narrative', 'many', 'points', 'parallels', 'own', 'American', 'story.In', 'particular', 'Australia', 'will', 'introduce', 'most', 'non-Australian', 'audiences', 'Australia', 'national', 'tragedy', 'Stolen', 'Generation', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Kevin', 'Rudd', 'apologized', 'last', 'year', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'perfect', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'Hollywoodized', 'past', 'especially', 'idealization', 'good', 'guys', 'a-historical', 'views', 'race', 'relations', 'profundity', 'Australia', 'historical', 'romance', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'English-speaking', 'world', 'tradition', 'knuckle-headed', 'stories', 'pack', 'genuine', 'emotional', 'wallop', 'back', 'least', 'Shakespeare', 'who', 'late', 'authorial', 'career', 'wrote', 'romances', 'Tempest', 'Pericles', 'Prince', 'Tyre', 'Winter', 'Tale', 'were', 'deliriously', 'implausible', 'deeply', 'emotionally', 'honest', 'Thus', 'Australia', 'only', 'stony', 'heart', 'will', 'fail', 'be', 'moved', 'wholly', 'predictable', 'yet', 'emotionally', 'credible', 'conclusion.So', 'yeah', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'neat', 'picture', 'context', 'condescendingly', 'dismissive', 'reviews', 'easily', 'surpassed', 'low', 'expectations', 'placed', ""'ll"", 'scarcely', 'be', 'able', 'forget']",N/A

Set amid the dramatic backdrop of the world's largest island, the movie centers around Lady Sarah Ashley (played by Nicole Kidman whom I have a special attatchment to for thanks to her husband) and her cattle herder known as ""The Drover"" (played by the masculine Hugh Jackman). As Sarah tries to take over her dead husband's ranch in the outback, she is met with numerous obstacles including a corrupt cattle king who is seeking to monopolize the cattle industry, and her ranch manager who is secretly working for her opponent. I must say that David Wenham, who plays her traitor manager, does very poorly at his role. He's just too apparantely evil and sniveling. He was much better in 300. But anyways, Sarah must enlist the help of the Drover if her ranch is ever to survive and soon an improbable romance is ignited. But the gem that really sparkles in this film is the little aboriginal boy that Sarah decides to adopt in order to keep him safe from the government who exports the ""half cast"" children. But when the Japanese who bombed Pearl Harbor stage an air raid on Darwin, their worlds are all torn apart. I won't say any more because I don't want to ruin it for you. The ending is a little cliche but overall it was a good story. The two leads do a fantastic job together. I was especially impressed with Kidman who lended both humour and pathos to her role. The score was very good, using Over the Rainbow as one of its themes. The cinematography was stunning and effective. Even though it runs almost three hours long, I would encourage you to see it to form an opinion for yourself. You may not be blown away like I was.

1228065,A3ALCP02N5EF41,B001PPGAIA,Reader,"[13, 15]","Having seen the movie more than once has given me a more nuanced appreciation of this epic movie.  Its storyline tackles the relationship between two people coming from different cultures who eventually found themselves together -- initially at odds, in love, and part of a family unit -- all amidst the backdrop of the sprawling Australian outback, the divide of races and social strata, the age-old clash between good and evil, and the onset of the second world war in the Pacific!  The movie experience is like curling up with an extraordinary epic novel - and at the end feeling what a well-spent afternoon it has been!The movie's length does justice to this tale of love and adventure in a faraway culture and of unusual natural beauty.  The cinematography provides all the lush scenes of the Australian landscape, the rush of blood in some of the most awesome action scenes, and the loving closeups of the story of the relationship between Lady Sarah Ashley, The Drover, and their defacto son, Nullah! The musical score gives the movie the perfect complement to the excellent cinematography. The story unwinds from an initial meeting full of comedic winks ( including the now famous shower scene - featuring the leading man!) and clashing cultures. It then dawns on the central role played by the child Nullah and his aboriginal culture. Plus what would an epic movie be without the quintessential villains?  As the movie progresses and we witness the triumph of the independent cattle company versus the monopoly, it also gives us a slice of Australian history and its development in its early frontiers.  When the second world war breaks out and it marches down to Darwin, we are caught in another story between good and evil, so cinematically well-portrayed.  And they lived happily ever after, with a twist --the expected end of a truly epic movie!Who are the  main characters and how are they portrayed?Lady Sarah Ashley is the English rose who became an adopted daughter of the Australian frontier. She is transformed into a loving nurturer of a child and the harsh land because the relationship which came into her life also changed her outlook.  Nicole Kidman very ably portrays this complicated woman who changes from a non-sympathetic character to a caring heroine. This transformation is so well portrayed in the changing face of Lady Ashley - from the very beautiful and well-turned out woman to the woman whose inner beauty shines through her bedgraggled locks and almost plain face and through  her pained expression as she undergoes tragedy and is touched by sorrow, and finally to the look of someone who has come to terms with what is important in life.  This is one of Nicole's best movie portrayals!The Drover has a mysterious past and a rough image as we are first introduced to him.  He is a man who is iconic in the history of the outback but it was his reaching out to the shunned aboriginal community in the past which showed that he was an extraordinary man. In the song by Elton John, played second in the movie credits, called The Drover's Ballad, his story turns out to be rich in tragedy and a life full of love for the outback, which gives us more of a complete picture of this man with a heart of gold. The tragic life seems to follow him even much later in the movie - and this is where he shows his heart on his sleeve!  Hugh Jackman is magnificent in the role and it is hard to imagine anybody else giving a more masterful performance.  The magnificence is not just in how he looked ( Baz Luhrmann did show Hugh Jackman as the representation of physical perfection...surprisingly, because the other choice was Nicole Kidman) but also in his acting chops.  There are several scenes where Hugh displays his acting range at the highest emotional level - when he realizes that the people he loved may have become victims of the tragedy of war...and then the realization that fate had actually been kinder.  Who can't help but be mesmerized by his face and his voice in the scene by the burning war HQ and at the ruined bar, in the Mission Island rescue, and at the wharf in Darwin?  Had the past of the drover been more meaningfully played out on the screen, the role could have garnered Hugh an award recognition!The third important role is the child Nullah, as charmingly portrayed by a new child actor named Brandon Walters. He charms everyone except the villain.  He is in a sense at the heart of the story and Brandon makes us follow Nullah's journey with almost a maternal/paternal eye for his welfare in the story. At the end, he is conflicted about his real family and culture, but I am sure that when Nullah grows up, it will both cultures and both families that he will truly call his own!Kudos likewise to the actors who portrayed the main villain, the iconic aboriginal character, the Drover's friend and main man, even the hotel keeper and his gruff ways...as well as to the other Australian actors who gave life to this epic story.The creatives have done well to transform such a tale magnificently on screen! Baz Luhrmann provides the vision and the direction of the story-telling with such interesting and charismatic characters and amidst a magnificent background of natural beauty, culture, and slices of history!While the movie could only be given full justice in a cinema with its impressive big screen and excellent sound, I would still love to get a DVD/blu-ray version to allow me to see it again and again  - much like wanting to read and re-read a very good epic novel!",5,"A fine story of love, culture, and history!",1233705600,"02 4, 2009",2009,5530,"['Having', 'seen', 'movie', 'more', 'once',

The location is different, the war is different, and the circumstances are different! Perhaps the only similarity in characters is between the overseers, specifically Fletcher of Australia's Faraway Downs and the overseer of Tara plantation in Gone with the Wind. Nicole Kidman's ""English Rose"" who toughens up fast does not compare with Vivien Leigh's portrayal of the ruthless Scarlett O'Hara. Thankfully, the Drover does not compare to ""Gone with the Wind's"" decadent Rhett Butler either!Naturally, the Australian aborigines are completely different from the black southern American slaves (who probably really ran the plantations). Nullah, the winsome lad from whose viewpoint the tale is mostly told, is the character that really makes the story work. If anyone gives a performance worthy of an Oscar in this film, it's this promising young actor, Brandon Walters, whom I dearly hope to see more of!Otherwise, yes, if you are a Hugh Jackman fan, you will find the movie worth seeing for his competent portrayal of the gorgeously rugged, diamond-in-the-rough Drover. Will mention that a friend of mine thought that the portion when the Drover appeared at the ball resplendent in his tuxedo was ""Disneyesque,"" and, yes, my friend's viewpoint is valid. Perhaps Baz Luhrmann thought to show that the ""diamond-in-the-rough"" could successfully take on polish.Since this is a review rather than a social commentary, I won't get trapped into going on at length about the disgraceful way Australian aborigines were treated. Being American, that would be like the pot calling the kettle black (pun - if anyone sees it - is intentional). As someone who's bi-racial (possibility tri-racial), I can say that it's important to be aware that damage has been done and then get on with it - ""it"" being working at being fair, starting with oneself.In any event, see and enjoy Australia.

It translated well to a modern setting, and I've watched it countless times. And Moulin Rouge was not great but it was entertaining.This, my friend is not.Yes I love long movies, but on principle- as long as they:1. Don't Drag2. Stay entertaining the whole way through3. Manage to tell the story in a sense in which a shorter runtime would have been a rush jobI enjoyed Watchmen, The Godfather, Dances With Wolves, King Kong 05, and others on that Principle. ESPECIALLY Dances With Wolves. That movie was 3 hours long yet it only felt like 2 hours. When a movie that's over 140 minutes drags, gets boring in some bits, and rely on just being long (The Horse Whisperer, Inland Empire, and the recent Funny People), not a good sign. Australia is one of those movies.I was so looking forward to this movie- Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman who are two of the best actors, and Luhrmann. I rented it om Blu-Ray the day it came out. ANd then I watched it.About 96 minutes into the movie I was already checking my wristwatch. THen 140 minute mark, I think it's over. Turns out it's not. 150 minute mark, it's over. 152 minute mark, it's not. 159 minute mark, the credits are finally rolling. Wow, a story so thin and weightless lasted THAT LONG?The movie is a complete joke, and for several reasons.First off, this film is basically an extended remake of The Notebook. And while I wasn't crazy about The Notebook either, at least it had good acting and a good plot. This has good acting, but that's where it stops. The plot is confusing and hard to follow.Second, the length- 3 hours. The same story could easily have been told in two hours or less. But no, Luhrmann had to insert 5 minute shots so he could flesh it out.Third, the best thing about the movie, Nicole Kidman, was SEVERELY underused. She is a beautiful and undeniable actress, she has the abitlity to pull off any role. But she wasn't used enough.Oh, and the CGI overdose. This movie is the Die Another Day of Romance films. 60% of all the settings, props, etc. is CG. It's completely distracting.In short, this is one giant, long, boring, and confusing mess of a movie.

1228070,A2L7WYA5OENV03,B001PPGAIA,Reticuli,"[1, 2]","I'll admit being hard on this film due to initial high hopes.  After hearing about the Australian government's apologies for the Stolen Generation, I started thinking Luhrmann's project may have helped lead to that.  For a film claiming to have been initially inspired by the story of aborigine discrimination and mistreatment, it's surprisingly secondary to the film itself, comprising the minority of the performances and story...no pun intended.  I'd have much rather seen a film about a white man, a black woman, and their offspring than an attempt to water it down and use as a gimmick.  How appalling we should think that ""unmarketable"" in this day in age.While I generally have no problem with the lightness, humor, or overt Hollywoodness Luhrmann was going for, it just didn't quite mesh with the overall mood or tone of the film.  I also don't think it helped make Nicole Kidman's character as likeable as it could have.  This tends to make the romantic chemistry even more lacking.  Ordinarily we should feel much more sympathy for a woman who's just lost her husband, and thus be more empathetic and taken-in by the events surrounding her later.  I think instead we get something closer to Scarlet O'Hara, who frankly none of the audience was supposed to really give a damn about.  It's not that bad here, but this early choice has detrimental effects.The heavy use of CGI was further disappointing.  It had that extreme washed-out bright highlights quality to much of it, with that artificial foggy, dusty, blurry background from post-production tampering.  The closest look is that of the films Pearl Harbor and Indiana Jones & the Crystal Skulls...and not the non-CGI cave scenes from the latter, some of which were simply printed optically.  Combined with Luhrmann's need to cram everything within a single frame all the time that he inherited from his work on the stage, not to mention some of the stage-like lighting (strong backlights upon the hair at night, uniform color tints to background, etc) it just often looked rather synthetic.Structurally there is a serious flaw regarding timeline here.  Jackman's character is based on a real person.  The aborigine history is accurate.  The attack on the town of Darwin did happen.  However, the choice to put a two year gap between the cattle driving event and what is (which I will explain next) a fourth act, is baffling.  The child hasn't aged and there's an unnecessarily poor segue using newspaper clippings and newsreels to bring us up to date.  All this just as our bottoms are beginning to ache or the need to use the toilet (as Hitchcock put it) chimes in.Thus the solution would have been to shave off about 20 minutes to a half hour removing the written introduction, shortening the kisses (they all last a few beats too long), no thanking of the bartender at the end, making all slow-motions normal speed (a nauseating number of them), losing many extraneous shots & scenes, and tightening up every take's edit.  By putting the cattle driving section in 1941, you can also drop the aforementioned segue and more naturally lead into a proper third act without having ""blown the cinematic load"", to use a crude but efficient phrase, in an overly long first two-thirds.  The triumphant cattle drive would end act two, sufficiently joyful but not so cathartically exhausting that the Japanese attack is akin to Frodo leaving with the fairies after the audience is getting up to leave.  Out of Africa needed to be long.  Australia did not.A final word on plastic surgery:Please, women of Hollywood,Think twice about cosmetic surgery & ""procedures""...at least before you need it.  When things are really going south, no one's going to complain.  But this collagen in the lips thing has gotten out of hand.  Uma Thurman had a little work done recently with unexpectedly outstanding & admittedly rare results, but revealingly, very little of it had to do with her lips.

Baz Luhrmann's loving tribute to his homeland isn't as bad as the critics would have you think. Aside from the pretty people (Kidman, Jackman), there's an amazing performance from young Brandon Walters, who not only narrates the film but gives a very complete performance of discovery, angst and renewal, and ultimate discovery.Yeah, there's a love story, but the loving care regarding the kid sort of supercedes a lot. This was smart. Mr. Luhrmann is prone to visuals, and the sets and costumes, as well as the lovely cinematogrphy of Mandy Walker, are all excellent. Indeed, attention to period detail is perfect, as one like I could only imagine. Kidman and Jackson are good, but David Wenham was especially evil, a fine performance. I hated him very much. A film with Baz' name wouldn't be  proper without the magical use of music, most properly adapted by David Hirschfelder. I thought this film was better than the critics thought. Aside from the usual expected from Luhrmann, the performance of young Brandon Walters is reason enough to give this film credibility.  The one thing I don't understand is why, when they knew Darwin would be attacked, nobody did ANYTHING to protect themselves or fight back. That made no sense to me.

It satisfied all my expectations of sexy stares, double entendres, mean scoundrels, naked kissing, pretty clothes, and a sweaty, dirty, muscular Hugh Jackman.As of all movies of late, Australia was at least 15 minutes too long although I didn't get the feeling of it dragging in any part. The orchestral scores were too loud and dictatorial. The admiration of the Aboriginals mysticism was raised to almost a near-condescending level of being praised too much. The critics were right with their middle-of-the-road reviews. Cinematically, it wasn't bad but it wasn't that good either.With all that said, I wasn't disappointed by Australia. It wasn't as frenetic or eye-straining as Moulin Rouge or William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. Nicole Kidman's acting was pleasant as the Lady Sarah Ashley playing her both straight and with tongue firmly in cheek. Hugh Jackman yet again proved that he can be both a guy's guy and a girl's guy playing the rough-hewn Drover--a man who can control females of both the horse and human variety while drinking cheap rum from the bottle and with a hand-rolled cigarette dangling from his lip. The entire cast was a delight especially the young Brandon Walters who played the mystical bi-racial Aborigine boy at the center of most of the movie's non-romantic action.The big scenes of the movie, a cattle stampede and the bombing of Darwin, was worth the price of admission. It made my heart race and me gasp with anticipation even when I knew the outcomes. There was one scene I really did enjoy, but only because of the audience's reaction. The Drover, who is an outcast, sets high society's tongues a wagging when he arrives at a ball to claim his lady. As the camera pans up to reveal the lean, well-dressed, clean shaven handsomeness of Hugh Jackman, there is an audible contented sigh from the ladies in the theater followed by a group groan from the men in the theater.

Kyle,"[3, 3]","War's imminent, but Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) is tired of waiting for her husband Maitland to sell his Australian property and return home to her.  Despite her husband's admonitions, she flies to Darwin on a mission to convince Lord Ashley to sell Faraway Downs and come home to England.She lands in the middle of a cattle war.  King Carney (Bryan Brown) owns all the cattle ranches in the territory save for Faraway Downs, which he's trying to put into enough straits to make the owner sell with the help of Neil Fletcher (David Wenham) who ostensibly is the manager of Faraway Downs, but has been helping Carney siphon off cattle across the Billabong River for quite some time.Lady Ashley's husband Maitland is dead, supposedly the victim of a Aborigene spear.  But, she's seen the other set of books that Fletcher's beeng keeping for Lord Carney.  Lady Ashley fires Fletcher.Now the race is on.  In order to survive, Lady Ashley's got to drive 1500 head of cattle to Darwin to sell them for the Army contract ahead of King Carney.And war has broken out and it's coming to Australia.  The police want to take Nullah (Brandon Walters) away from Faraway Downs, because the boy is a 'creamy' or a half-cast (half Aborigene and half white).  While Lady Sarah is not a drop maternal, she's fallen for the boy and for Drover (Hugh Jackman) who's contracted to help her get the cattle to Darwin.The story's much more than this.  ""Australia"" has all the ingredients of a good Western, an excellent war film and a fine romance all tied up into a fairly elegant package.  Add to that, one of the most compelling performances by young Brandon Walters I've seen.Warning:  take your tissue with you and don't get a large drink.

1228076,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001PPGAIA,RMurray847,"[0, 2]","AUSTRALIA is a big, old-fashioned kind of epic that manages to entertain mildly on a very broad scale.  It's the kind of movie that made me think upon its conclusion, ""I liked it okay...but it's also a little weird and pointless that so much time and effort was put into such a ho-hum movie.""I think part of the problem is that much of the film is trying to illuminate Australia's recent history of very ill treatment of ""mixed race"" aborigines.  Apparently, as World War II was nearing the country, there was a policy in place to round up these ""half breed"" children and separate them from their tribal roots...I guess to keep white genes out of the aboriginal gene pool.  Naturally, this is an outrageous policy that had terrible consequences.  It's the kind of thing that probably still leaves Australians today with bad feelings.  But in the movie AUSTRALIA, no true sense of outrage is achieved.  We feel bad for the characters who endure this racism, but it all feels kind of quaint, too.  We can ""tut-tut"" to ourselves about how bad things used to be...but the film is not exactly a call to action.Frankly, the unsurpassed epic GONE WITH THE WIND stirs more outrage about the plight of enslaved African-Americans simply by NOT making an issue of their treatment.  To watch that film today, and to see the casual treatment of blacks as inferior is far more chilling (even though it wasn't deliberate).Anyway, AUSTRALIA primarily concerns the rich English lady played by Nicole Kidman, who travels to Australia more or less in a fit of pique to check up on her errant husband and his cattle business.  She arrives to find that her husband has just died (perhaps in suspicious circumstances) and she is suddenly somewhat responsible for the ranch, the cattle and her husband's employees.  As all women in epics of this kind do, she decides she can learn this business and drive her cattle to town, just through sheer spunk.  She enlists Hugh Jackman (a cattle drover whose name also appears to be Mr. Drover) to lead the way.  And this earthy, ill-mannered man who has little use for women with spunk eventually gives in, and wouldn't you know it, the two even manage to fall passionately in love.If I sound a little cynical in my tone, it's because virtually  nothing in the film comes as a surprise.  Will Kidman decide she has the right to be a rancher?  Will their cattle drive succeed in getting the cows into town ahead of  the mean, underhanded cattle tycoon (Bryan Brown) and HIS herd?  Will Kidman and Jackman fall in love?  Will they have many misadventures?  Will they both take a liking to the irrepressibly cute ""half breed"" child whose mother works on their staff?  Will they ""adopt"" him when his mother dies?What makes the film work to any extent at all is that some of these dramatic archetypes (i.e. clich&eacute;s) still work.  The ""cattle-drive against the odds"" is as old as movies themselves...yet there is still something amazingly effective about them.  The stampedes, the chance to get to see the noble side of all your main characters.  The chance to see some magnificent countryside.  It just flat out works.  There are some quite powerful scenes during this segment, which is easily the best chunk of the film.Later, WWII does strike the coastal town of Darwin, and Kidman, Jackman and the young boy are all imperiled and separated.  Daring rescues are needed.  The bad guys make things needlessly difficult, etc.  The town of Darwin is largely computer generated and the battle scenes are short and feel very, very uninspired.  These should be some of the climactic moments of the film...but they never really generate any significant suspense.The film also plays around a bit with the ""magic"" of an aboriginal elder, the boy's grandfather.  He wants to boy to go with him on a walkabout...taking the first steps to manhood.  The boy is torn between his desire to follow his seemingly all-knowing grandfather...but he also wants to live with Kidman and Jackman and enjoy the ""easy"" lifestyle of these civilized folks.  This dilemma, I think, is supposed to help illuminate the greater themes of the film as a discussion of Australia's systematic racism.  In reality, though, I would say that it simply suggests that a harmony could be reached for these ""half breeds""...one that values both backgrounds, and thus should be an OPPORTUNITY for succeeding in both worlds, rather be an outcast from both.The film is directed by Baz Luhrman, and I want to say right here and how that I am not a Luhrman fan.  I found MOULIN ROUGE to be almost unbearable to watch.  The endlessly droning, badly sung love songs.  The total lack of real chemistry between Ewan McGregor and Kidman.  The fantastical scenery that felt more and more like a Disneyland knockoff.AUSTRALIA is certainly better...but it suffers from some similar problems.  Kidman and Jackman do a great job of playing as though they are in love and have the hots for each other.  They stare into each other's eyes a lot.  Jackman frequently crushes Kidman to his chest, just like on the cover of a bodice ripper.  They kiss with great fervor.  And yet I never once felt connected to their relationship.  I always like Jackman's easy demeanor...he seems like an amiable kind of fellow, and it's nice to see him working in his ""native"" Australian.  Kidman is a cold actress (and greatly over-rated)...but she does manage to evoke some laughs and some convincing spunkiness.  Yet as so often happens with her, she is unconvincing as a woman in love.  And to me, her two most unconvincing romantic efforts to date have been 1) MOULIN ROUGE & 2) AUSTRALIA.  She may love working with Baz Luhrman...but doing so isn't helping her.If you see AUSTRALIA, chances are that you'll be entertained for its nearly 3 hour length.  But its impact on you will be brief and modest.",3,A fairly ho-hum epic.,1228435200,"12 5, 2008",2008,5847,"['AUSTRALIA', 'big', 'old-fashioned', 'kind', 'epic', 'entertain', 'mildly', 'very',

1228085,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001PPGAIA,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 2]","A movie easier to admire than it is to embrace, ""Australia"" is Baz Luhrmann's epic salute to the land of his birth.  As with all of Luhrmann's films, ""Australia"" is an eclectic mixture of various and sundry elements and styles, ranging from sweeping vistas a la David Lean to cattle stampedes to barroom brawls to larger-than-life romance to wartime melodrama to social commentary to Aboriginal mysticism to lowbrow comic hijinks.  It doesn't all come together in the final analysis, but Luhrman earns himself some points for at least  making the effort.Set in 1939, ""Australia"" stars Nicole Kidman as Lady Sarah Ashley, a British noble woman who travels to the land Down Under to join her husband on the cattle ranch he owns and operates there, unaware that he has already been murdered under mysterious circumstances.  Hugh Jackman is the rugged ""drover"" assigned to transport her from the coast to the isolated property deep in the outback.  Thus begins a tumultuous relationship that will take them across the continent and straight into the eye of World War II.Kidman and Jackman have charm and charisma to spare as the initially sparring couple who eventually become an item, and Brandon Walters captivates us completely as the mixed-race boy who becomes an integral part of the lovers' lives (the absurd caste system which allowed half-white children to be torn away from their aborigine parents becomes the major target of the movie's social criticism).Yet, while Lurhmann keeps things moving at a fairly brisk clip, he hasn't provided a focused enough narrative to pull us through a movie as long and grand in scale as this one is.  Say what you will about Lean's work, his storylines and characters always seemed commensurate in depth and gravity with the scope of his projects.  For significant stretches of time, ""Australia"" seems far too piddling, far too frivolous for the kind of movie it wants to be, while at other times, particularly towards the end, it threatens to wash away the audience in a tidal wave of manufactured sentimentality.Still, for all its weaknesses, ""Australia"" provides us with enough virtues of performance and filmmaking (the landscapes are literally stunning) to warrant at least a mild recommendation.  As a special added bonus for movie lovers, the film pays homage to such classics as ""The Wizard of Oz, "" ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Giant,"" the first one overtly, the latter two more subtly, through imagery intended to invoke our memories of them.Thus, though the movie itself may be far less than the sum of its parts, the parts alone make it worth seeing.",3,uneven but with much to recommend it,1228608000,"12 7, 2008",2008,2600,"['movie', 'easier', 'admire', 'embrace', 'Australia', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'epic', 'salute', 'land', 'birth', 'Luhrmann', 'films', 'Australia', 'eclectic', 'mixture', 'various', 'sundry', 'elements', 'styles', 'ranging', 'sweeping', 'vistas', 'la', 'David', 'Lean', 'cattle', 'stampedes', 'barroom', 'brawls', 'larger-than-life', 'romance', 'wartime', 'melodrama', 'social', 'commentary', 'Aboriginal', 'mysticism', 'lowbrow', 'comic', 'hijinks', ""n't"", 'come', 'together', 'final', 'analysis', 'Luhrman', 'points', 'least', 'making', 'effort.Set', '1939', 'Australia', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'Ashley', 'British', 'noble', 'woman', 'who', 'land', 'Down', 'join', 'husband', 'cattle', 'ranch', 'there', 'unaware', 'already', 'been', 'murdered', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'rugged', 'drover', 'assigned', 'transport', 'coast', 'isolated', 'property', 'deep', 'outback', 'Thus', 'tumultuous', 'relationship', 'will', 'take', 'continent', 'straight', 'eye', 'World', 'War', 'II.Kidman', 'Jackman', 'have', 'charm', 'charisma', 'spare', 'initially', 'sparring', 'couple', 'who', 'eventually', 'become', 'item', 'Brandon', 'Walters', 'completely', 'mixed-race', 'boy', 'who', 'integral', 'part', 'lovers', 'lives', 'absurd', 'caste', 'system', 'allowed', 'half-white', 'children', 'be', 'torn', 'away', 'aborigine', 'parents', 'major', 'target', 'movie', 'social', 'criticism', '.Yet', 'Lurhmann', 'things', 'moving', 'fairly', 'brisk', 'clip', ""n't"", 'provided', 'focused', 'enough', 'narrative', 'pull', 'movie', 'long', 'grand', 'scale', 'one', 'Say', 'what', 'will', 'Lean', 'work', 'storylines', 'characters', 'always', 'seemed', 'commensurate', 'depth', 'gravity', 'scope', 'projects', 'significant', 'stretches', 'time', 'Australia', 'far', 'too', 'piddling', 'far', 'too', 'frivolous', 'kind', 'movie', 'be', 'other', 'times', 'particularly', 'end', 'wash', 'away', 'audience', 'tidal', 'wave', 'manufactured', 'sentimentality.Still', 'weaknesses', 'Australia', 'enough', 'virtues', 'performance', 'filmmaking', 'landscapes', 'are', 'literally', 'stunning', 'warrant', 'least', 'mild', 'recommendation', 'special', 'added', 'bonus', 'movie', 'lovers', 'film', 'homage', 'such', 'classics', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Giant', 'first', 'one', 'overtly', 'latter', 'two', 'more', 'subtly', 'imagery', 'intended', 'invoke', 'memories', 'them.Thus', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'far', 'less', 'sum', 'parts', 'parts', 'alone', 'make', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

When she arrives, she is met by a rough bachelor called Drover (Hugh Jackman) who takes her to her husband's property, only to discover that he has been killed. The murder is blamed on the natives, but Lady Ashley quickly finds that something is afoot with the cattle boss (David Wenham) and she promptly fires him.Without someone to drive her cattle, Lady Ashley is forced to care for the land herself, and she must make a quick go of it. She becomes ""Miss Boss"" to the natives, and her forceful nature and womanly touch makes her a better candidate for the job than one might have first expected.The story is long and very predictable. It is obvious that most of the auxiliary characters will die, and the storyline doesn't make these deaths very surprising. The author wanted us to feel sad, but not in such a way that would affect the story too much.The scenery is beautiful, but that doesn't make a film great. Aside from that, the best part of the film is Brandon Walters who plays the makeshift son of Lady Ashley and Drover. The old adage about kids in film seems true here. Although Kidman and Jackman are well known for their acting skills, this boy steals every scene from them. He is charming, intelligent, and his lingo is very entertaining.

Starting off as a comedy with lots of typical Baz Luhrmann style direction, it then changes tack to become a more serious story of life travelling through the outback, with a hint of romance thrown in for good measure. The first half of the film follows Nicole Kidman, as Lady Ashley, who inherits her husbands cattle ranch and sets off to take the cattle to Darwin with the assistance of Hugh Jackman as the cattle drover. They are harassed and persecuted the whole journey by an unscrupulous rival and his henchman. The second half looks at their life afterward during the war. That is the story in a nutshell and it manages to keep you relatively interested for the duration, despite it's length and overblown direction. In fact it would have been better if it was shorter and focused just on the first aspect, with a few of the later loose ends tied up, instead of adding the extra hour of unnecessary storyline. This is quite corny in places (which is becoming a trademark of Luhrmann) and whilst the sweeping landscapes and overhead shots may look impressive, you get the feeling by the time you are half way through that this is a glorified promotional film from the Australian tourist board. There is a distinct lack of chemistry between Kidman and Jackman and both of their accents (plummy English lady and salt of the earth Aussie bushman) start to grate by the end. In fact the best actor has to be the aboriginal boy who travels with them on the cattle drive and he carries off an impressive performance.

That said, if you are reading this review, you'll have found that I rated the film a middle of the road 3 (out of 5) stars.  Why did I wind up there? Because the first 20 minutes just about completely lost my interest in seeing the rest of the film (along with my wife, who was also of the opinion we should just shut the Blu-ray off or toss in a definite comedy instead).It took two nights to get through the complete film.  After watching approximately half of the film, I was left wondering what the people that liked the movie were watching that seems so different than what I've found in watching that first half of the film.  Somewhere in that 90 minutes was what could be a decent film, if the director had decided whether he wanted a comedy, or a drama, or a mystery/thriller.Instead, it seems that in trying not to be too predictable, and also perhaps in trying to make an epic, the result is, at least throughout that first half of the film, and in several places in the second half too, an overly long film that takes too long getting to the point and telling the story.Just in that first 90 minutes there was at least 15 - 20 minutes that could have just been left on the cutting room floor and/or never been filmed at all. If it had to be filmed and kept in the story, then certainly much of the material could have been conveyed more efficiently without really changing the meat of the story.Not being quick to give up, my wife and I watched the second half of the film a night after watching the first half.  The second 90 minutes seems to stay more focused than the first and as a result seems to be less disjointed.  Perhaps it's more predictable, but it just seems better and less comical (and no, I don't mean comical as in it was trying to be humorous and came off that way, I mean comical as in nearly laughable and barely tolerable).For anyone considering purchase, I really recommend saving your money and going the rental route instead.  Go with Un-box and save your purchase money for something else.  Australia (the film) may look very nice (the picture quality on the Blu-ray disc is very nice), but it may just about lost you (as it nearly did with me) within the first 10 - 15 minutes on seeming to be just plain stupid. Minus that material, it's not as bad, but still takes a long time to get there and then leaves you thinking that the movie is too long and trying too hard when it didn't need to.Having finally seen the complete film, it doesn't surprise me at all that the movie didn't get much love in theatres and was raked over the coals somewhat by many reviewers.",3,"It really takes work to get into this one, even then...",1236470400,"03 8, 2009",2009,2707,"['one', 'type', 'films', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'absolutely', 'love', 'pretty', 'much', 'hate', 'said', 'are', 'reading', 'review', ""'ll"", 'have', 'found', 'rated', 'film', 'middle', 'road', '3', '5', 'stars', 'Why', 'did', 'wind', 'there', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'just', 'completely', 'lost', 'interest', 'seeing', 'rest', 'film', 'wife', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'opinion', 'should', 'just', 'shut', 'Blu-ray', 'off', 'toss', 'definite', 'comedy', 'instead', '.It', 'took', 'two', 'nights', 'get', 'complete', 'film', 'watching', 'approximately', 'half', 'film', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'people', 'liked', 'movie', 'were', 'watching', 'so', 'different', 'what', ""'ve"", 'found', 'watching', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'Somewhere', '90', 'minutes', 'was', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'decent', 'film', 'director', 'had', 'decided', 'wanted', 'comedy', 'drama', 'mystery/thriller.Instead', 'trying', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'predictable', 'also', 'perhaps', 'trying', 'make', 'epic', 'result', 'least', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'several', 'places', 'second', 'half', 'too', 'overly', 'long', 'film', 'too', 'long', 'getting', 'point', 'telling', 'story.Just', 'first', '90', 'minutes', 'there', 'was', 'least', '15', '20', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'and/or', 'never', 'been', 'filmed', 'had', 'be', 'filmed', 'kept', 'story', 'then', 'certainly', 'much', 'material', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'conveyed', 'more', 'efficiently', 'really', 'changing', 'meat', 'story.Not', 'being', 'quick', 'give', 'up', 'wife', 'watched', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'night', 'watching', 'first', 'half', 'second', '90', 'minutes', 'stay', 'more', 'focused', 'first', 'result', 'be', 'less', 'disjointed', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'predictable', 'just', 'better', 'less', 'comical', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'comical', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'humorous', 'came', 'off', 'way', 'mean', 'comical', 'nearly', 'laughable', 'barely', 'tolerable', '.For', 'anyone', 'considering', 'purchase', 'really', 'recommend', 'saving', 'money', 'going', 'rental', 'route', 'instead', 'Go', 'Un-box', 'save', 'purchase', 'money', 'something', 'else', 'Australia', 'film', 'may', 'look', 'very', 'nice', 'picture', 'quality', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'very', 'nice', 'may', 'just', 'lost', 'nearly', 'did', 'first', '10', '15', 'minutes', 'seeming', 'be', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'material', 'not', 'bad', 'still', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'there', 'then', 'thinking', 'movie', 'too', 'long', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'to.Having', 'finally', 'seen', 'complete', 'film', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'love', 'theatres', 'was', 'raked', 'coals', 'somewhat', 'many', 'reviewers']",N/A

Vibrant colors and gorgeous cinematography can't quite balance out the confusion caused from the rotation of genres as the film progresses in and out of action, romance, drama, musical, comedy, and more.  And while not every successful epic need be tragic, the tragedy befalling the protagonists of Australia never quite becomes emotional enough to warrant a very deep audience attachment.When English aristocrat Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) travels to Australia to deal with the selling of an inherited cattle ranch, she discovers a plot to monopolize the beef trade with the military by ruthless cattle baron King Carney (Bryan Brown).  Determined to fight the hostile takeover of her land, Lady Sarah hires the roguish Drover (Hugh Jackman) to help lead 2,000 head of cattle across the unforgiving Australian terrain to the city of Darwin.  But the cattle drive is just the beginning of their adventures as a begrudged stock-man conspires against them and the threat of the war looms imminently over the horizon.In Australia's epic scope, the first half of the film is disgracefully dull. The cinematography is the only thing that stands out amongst the uninspired storyline that borrows heavily from the tones, the characters, and the settings of memorable films like City Slickers, Crocodile Dundee, The Cowboys, and Quigley Down Under.  Drover rescues the unprepared Lady Ashley from all sorts of humor-injected mayhem in the playful mood of Crocodile Dundee and Matthew Quigley, and his own personality is little more than a blend of John Wayne's Wil Andersen with Billy Crystal's Mitch Robbins. The idea of droving cattle with a mismatched, novice crew is ripped straight from the plot of both The Cowboys and City Slickers. The jarring separation between part one and part two of Australia would have made for an appropriate intermission, or two completely disassociated films.While visual brilliance is clearly the film's strong point, its bizarre transitioning between a wide variety of genres creates an oddly style-confused epic.  The film starts almost like a screwball comedy, with fast-talking arguments between the leads and a light-hearted bar-fight introduction for the Drover.  Once the cattle drive begins, we're immersed in exciting action with stampeding herds and a race to the proverbial finish line.  Shortly after, the film heads into the territory of romance as the mismatched duo fall for each other, and then a brief stint in a public service announcement for the mistreatment and segregation of mixed-race children segues into a war film of the bombing of Darwin by the Japanese.Australia does manage a gorgeous look, but underneath that deceptive layer of beauty lies a film not too original and not too compelling.  A more precise approach and a steadier tone might have made a finer movie - after all an epic is not defined by length alone.- The Massie Twins",3,Australia Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1227571200,"11 25, 2008",2008,3034,"['Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'latest', 'effort', 'epic', 'feel', 'extreme', 'runtime', 'though', 'sadly', 'former', 'oftentimes', 'result', 'latter', 'Vibrant', 'colors', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'balance', 'out', 'confusion', 'caused', 'rotation', 'genres', 'film', 'action', 'romance', 'drama', 'musical', 'comedy', 'more', 'not', 'successful', 'epic', 'need', 'be', 'tragic', 'tragedy', 'befalling', 'protagonists', 'Australia', 'never', 'quite', 'emotional', 'enough', 'warrant', 'very', 'deep', 'audience', 'attachment.When', 'English', 'aristocrat', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'Ashley', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Australia', 'deal', 'selling', 'inherited', 'cattle', 'ranch', 'plot', 'monopolize', 'beef', 'trade', 'military', 'ruthless', 'cattle', 'baron', 'King', 'Carney', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'Determined', 'fight', 'hostile', 'takeover', 'land', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'roguish', 'Drover', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'help', 'lead', '2,000', 'head', 'cattle', 'unforgiving', 'Australian', 'terrain', 'city', 'Darwin', 'cattle', 'drive', 'just', 'beginning', 'adventures', 'begrudged', 'stock-man', 'conspires', 'threat', 'war', 'imminently', 'horizon.In', 'Australia', 'epic', 'scope', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'disgracefully', 'dull', 'cinematography', 'only', 'thing', 'out', 'uninspired', 'storyline', 'heavily', 'tones', 'characters', 'settings', 'memorable', 'films', 'City', 'Slickers', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'Cowboys', 'Quigley', 'Down', 'Drover', 'unprepared', 'Lady', 'Ashley', 'sorts', 'humor-injected', 'mayhem', 'playful', 'mood', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'Matthew', 'Quigley', 'own', 'personality', 'little', 'more', 'blend', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Wil', 'Andersen', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'Mitch', 'Robbins', 'idea', 'droving', 'cattle', 'mismatched', 'novice', 'crew', 'ripped', 'straight', 'plot', 'Cowboys', 'City', 'Slickers', 'jarring', 'separation', 'part', 'one', 'part', 'two', 'Australia', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'appropriate', 'intermission', 'two', 'completely', 'disassociated', 'films.While', 'visual', 'brilliance', 'clearly', 'film', 'strong', 'point', 'bizarre', 'transitioning', 'wide', 'variety', 'genres', 'oddly', 'style-confused', 'epic', 'film', 'almost', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'fast-talking', 'arguments', 'leads', 'light-hearted', 'bar-fight', 'introduction', 'Drover', 'cattle', 'drive', 'begins', ""'re"", 'immersed', 'exciting', 'action', 'stampeding', 'herds', 'race', 'proverbial', 'finish', 'line', 'Shortly', 'film', 'heads', 'territory', 'romance', 'mismatched', 'duo', 'fall', 'other', 'then', 'brief', 'stint', 'public', 'service', 'announcement', 'mistreatment', 'segregation', 'mixed-race', 'children', 'war', 'film', 'bombing', 'Darwin', 'Japanese.Australia', 'manage', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'deceptive', 'layer', 'beauty', 'film', 'not', 'too', 'original', 'not', 'too', 'compelling', 'more', 'precise', 'approach', 'steadier', 'tone', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'finer', 'movie', 'epic', 'not', 'defined', 'length', 'alone.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

1228121,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B001PPGAIA,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[0, 0]","Baz Luhrmann's (""Romeo + Juliet"", ""Moulin Rouge"") new film ""Australia"" pretty much defines the term 'sweeping epic'. And Luhrmann has created a film that is three things.Very sweeping. Very epic. And very long.Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman, ""Moulin Rouge"", ""The Others""), an uptight English woman, arrives in Australia to convince her husband to sell their ranch and return home before World War II breaks out in the Pacific. Upon her arrival, she finds Drover (Hugh Jackman, ""X-Men"", ""The Prestige"") and takes an immediate dislike to the crude hired hand. But he is her transportation through the Outback and they set off on the arduous journey. Upon their arrival at the ranch, she finds her husband has been killed and she stands to lose everything unless she can drive her cattle to port, to fulfill an Army contract, before the evil cattle baron King Carney (Bryan Brown, ""FX"") can use his considerable resources to fulfill the contract. Her only choice is to ask Drover to help her out. They enlist the aid of the Aboriginal people who work the ranch, including Nullah (Brandon Walters), a half white Aboriginal boy. When Nullah's mother dies, Sarah cares for the boy and tries to protect him from the government forces intent on taking him away from his mother and Sarah. The trek is treacherous and made all the more difficult by Carney's right hand man, Neil Fletcher (David Wenham, ""300""). But the cattle make it to port and Sarah is able to fix up the ranch. Then World War II threatens their Eden and everyone must help out in the war effort.Baz Luhrmann's films are, if nothing else, visual. And ""Australia"" doesn't disappoint in that regard. Luhrmann seems to have a fascination with picture books or pop-up books, because this influence continually reappears in his last few films. In ""Moulin Rouge"", he framed practically every image in deep reds and created 2-D frames for give the film a very stylized look, never allowing us to forget we were being transported into the director's inner mind, a journey many disliked. In ""Australia"", a fictionalized epic, he can't do this type of thing as much, but he certainly gets away with it more often than you might expect. The film begins with Nullah narrating the arrival of Lady Ashley and the beginning of the story, much like a parent might tell a bedtime story. But Nullah is relating a legend. He is Aboriginal and his people learn about their history and their way of life through recounting their legends. After a few minutes, he stops himself and we go backwards, to before her arrival, to get more of the details.Luhrmann's style is very graphic and he seems less concerned with getting meaningful or authentic performances from his actors. Occasionally, he achieves this, but it almost seems to be an accident. In ""Moulin Rouge"", every performer appears to be trying to achieve the live action equivalent of a comic book character. Shouting, mugging, laughing too hard, every emotion is too broad and too big. But it works. And ""Moulin Rouge"" is one of my favorite films of all time. In ""Australia"", Luhrmann is going for something a bit more natural, and this works less well. Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman topiline the cast, and they are both good, but unremarkable. They almost get lost in the epic and sweeping nature of the story.As much as Luhrmann wants to present a slice (a very large slice) of the history of his birthplace, these theatrical flourishes tend to depreciate the actor's performances. At one point, the camera sweeps in on Bryan Brown who plays the villainous cattle baron King Carney, as he laughs maniacally and the gold filling in his tooth sparkles on cue. If Luhrmann were really interested in presenting a slice of history, or dare I say, an Oscar contender, he would have held these artistic flourishes (excesses?) in check.Nicole Kidman plays Lady Sarah Ashley, a very uptight English woman who reluctantly travels to Australia to encourage her husband to sell the ranch they own and return home before World War II breaks out in the Pacific. Kidman's character is the typical uptight noble woman it almost seems every English woman is required to be. Why? Because she must transform before the end of the film. She will transform from the frigid, proper, uptight English woman and become less rigid, more romantic, and more open and all of this will be caused by ""Australia"". She will become a WOMAN in this strange, unusual land.Story events lead her to become the de-facto mother for Nullah. Initially, she is very cool and aloof to him. When he experiences a personal tragedy, she approaches and crouches down and says ""There. There"" in the most impersonal way someone could. While this moment is necessary, I never really felt like Ashley and Nullah ever have a true bond. Yes, they cry when they are separated, they cry when they are reunited. They cry. And cry. But it doesn't always feel real.Naturally, because Lady Ashley is so uptight, she will take to the Australian outback as naturally as a cat to water. Everything about the Outback will be a test for her. Can she open up and adapt? Or will she run back to England never to return? And if she dislikes the Outback, she will dislike Drover (Jackman) IMMENSELY. At least at first. Drover is the pure embodiment of everything the Out back is. Laid back. Rugged. Determined. Strong willed. And, of course, Jackman is very handsome, so Kidman's Ashley has to be drawn to him as well. But there will be, at first, clashes and fireworks.And this is another problem with ""Australia"". It's so damn predictable. If you've ever seen a movie like ""Gone With The Wind"" or ""Out of Africa"", you will recognize most of ""Australia"". Apparently, Luhrmann shot a few alternative endings and let some test audiences determine which one was included in the film. What he chose, based on their reactions, was the most acceptable, most recognizable, more predictable ending offering no surprises or to help set the film apart.Hugh Jackman is good as Drover, the rugged man of the Earth who becomes a reluctant ally to Lady Ashley. Initially, they unite to join forces against King Carney. Then, they unite to... well, unite.Drover is a good old boy who 'works for no man' and feels very comfortable sleeping on the range, maybe more comfortable than in a bed. He gets in drunken brawls, he drives horses and cattle, and he rarely shaves and looks great riding a horse. And Lady Ashley doesn't know what to think of him.At one point early on, Lady Ashley sits next to the fire on their initial trip to her ranch. Luhrmann then begins panning the camera across Jackman's broad, defined back as he soaps himself down. Soon, he reaches down for a bucket of water and douses it over himself. As the camera lingers over his torso, many women and gay men should thank Luhrmann for this piece of soft-core porn. Really, the camera moves in much the same way a Playboy video would capture a bunny washing a car. Oh, did I get that wet?And naturally, Ashley does a double take and realizes she is staring wantonly at her hired hand. She quickly composes herself.Throughout the film, Drover and Ashley struggle with the idea of a relationship and what that means to each of them, providing a little of the conflict in their relationship. But this isn't really the part of the story Luhrmann cares about telling, so it remains in the background.If Luhrmann had confined his story to the tale of the cattle drive, the resulting film would be better. Just as predictable, but better. But it isn't enough for Luhrmann to simply tell the story of the love of these two disparate individuals. He has to tell an 'important' story, an 'epic' story. So, he sets it against both the backdrop of World War II and includes the story of the Lost Ones. Both of these stories are interesting, but seem to have been tacked on as after thoughts.The better addition is the story of Nullah and what the Australian government did to all half-caste Aboriginals they could get their hands on. They uprooted these children, the product or sexual intercourse between a white man and an Aboriginal woman, and sent them to isolated areas, to be educated, to live together, to be held captive. Removed from their parents, the government was doing two things; trying to hide the evidence of affairs involving powerful white men and trying to make the children more acceptable to the community. And this happened for a shockingly long period of time.Luhrmann thrusts us into the middle of this dramatic piece of Australia's history allowing us to experience it through Lady Ashley's eyes, through Nicole Kidman's performance.Despite a few references throughout to the impending war, the last hour of ""Australia"" seems tacked on. There is a very clear division between two of the stories; when the cattle drive ends, we then pick up the threat of war. And because of this, the war sequence only serves to make the film seem longer than it already is.And it's long.Many people are making references to ""Gone With The Wind"" when they discuss ""Australia"" and I see the connection. They are very similar in scope, story, two strong leads, etc. And if you have seen ""GWTW"" or ""Out of Africa"", which I think is a better comparison, you will recognize most of ""Australia"" as you sit and watch it. And because Luhrmann is much more restrained with his over the top visual style, we are left watching a fairly predictable film.The question for you is can you sit through two hours and forty-five minutes of a predictable film?",4,3 1/2 - Very sweeping.

1228122,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B001PPGAIA,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[1, 1]","In his epic love letter to his native continent, Baz Luhrmann has crafted a sweeping three hour fairytale, filled to overflowing with beautiful people, scurrilous villains, music and dancing, danger and romance, music and magic. ""Australia"" is an old fashioned romance, and your fondness for it will depend on how you feel about grandiose pictures that were made with the intent to shamelessly grab your heartstrings while visually zapping you right between the eyes.While not perfect by any means, the scope and sheer WOW factor of ""Australia"" will give deep satisfaction to those movie watchers frustrated by cinema that seems pre-destined to small screen viewing or just load CGI-effects in ever increasing mania while forgetting about the magic that can be made by simply letting the backdrop tell the story. And for the first two-thirds of ""Australia,"" Luhrmann does just that. The impossibly good looking Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) finds herself a widowed ranch-owner forced to fend off the leering advances of Cattle Baron King Carney (Bryan Brown) and his slimy henchman Fletcher (David Wenham). Only the rugged ""Drover"" (Hugh Jackman) can help ""Miss Boss"" save ""Faraway Downs"" from the wicked ranchers. There is a wild west kind of scenario as the Faraway Downs race against time to herd 2000 head of cattle to the docks at Dover.That is the first part of ""Australia."" After that, it suddenly lurches into a WWII drama. The Japanese are poised to attack while Lady Sarah must undo what Fletcher has done to split her, Drover and Nulluh (the half-breed Aboriginal who spends the movie as its Greek Chorus). Somehow, Luhrmann ties all of this together (along with ""The Wizard of Oz"" and a social comment about aboriginal assimilation) while making it pretty entertaining. If this sounds like a good way to treat yourself to a movie night, by all means go ""Australia.""",4,The Wizard of Aus,1239840000,"04 16, 2009",2009,1881,"['epic', 'love', 'letter', 'native', 'continent', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'crafted', 'sweeping', 'three', 'hour', 'fairytale', 'filled', 'overflowing', 'beautiful', 'people', 'scurrilous', 'villains', 'music', 'dancing', 'danger', 'romance', 'music', 'magic', 'Australia', 'old', 'fashioned', 'romance', 'fondness', 'will', 'depend', 'how', 'feel', 'grandiose', 'pictures', 'were', 'made', 'intent', 'shamelessly', 'grab', 'heartstrings', 'visually', 'zapping', 'right', 'eyes.While', 'not', 'perfect', 'means', 'scope', 'sheer', 'WOW', 'factor', 'Australia', 'will', 'give', 'deep', 'satisfaction', 'movie', 'watchers', 'frustrated', 'cinema', 'pre-destined', 'small', 'screen', 'viewing', 'just', 'load', 'CGI-effects', 'ever', 'increasing', 'mania', 'forgetting', 'magic', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'simply', 'letting', 'backdrop', 'tell', 'story', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'Australia', 'Luhrmann', 'just', 'impossibly', 'good', 'looking', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'Ashley', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'widowed', 'ranch-owner', 'forced', 'fend', 'off', 'leering', 'advances', 'Cattle', 'Baron', 'King', 'Carney', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'slimy', 'henchman', 'Fletcher', 'David', 'Wenham', 'Only', 'rugged', 'Drover', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'can', 'help', 'Miss', 'Boss', 'save', 'Faraway', 'Downs', 'wicked', 'ranchers', 'wild', 'west', 'kind', 'scenario', 'Faraway', 'Downs', 'race', 'time', 'herd', '2000', 'head', 'cattle', 'docks', 'Dover.That', 'first', 'part', 'Australia', 'suddenly', 'WWII', 'drama', 'Japanese', 'are', 'poised', 'attack', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'must', 'undo', 'what', 'Fletcher', 'done', 'split', 'Drover', 'Nulluh', 'half-breed', 'Aboriginal', 'who', 'movie', 'Greek', 'Chorus', 'Somehow', 'Luhrmann', 'together', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'social', 'comment', 'aboriginal', 'assimilation', 'making', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'good', 'way', 'treat', 'movie', 'night', 'means', 'go', 'Australia']",N/A

They just don't make films like this anymore. I also wish more people appreciated films like this more. It was an unbelievable experience for me. I felt like I was experiencing something I had never experienced before. This was a beautifu story filled with lots of humor, adventure, romance, drama, and even some education on things I never knew anything about. The young actor who play Nullah was just amazing. His character added so much to the story. I might as well add how marvelous Hugh Jackman is in this film. This performance should really put him on the map. He is such a wonderful actor and I am glad he finally got such a great role (along with playing Wolverine). He is also perfect for this role and it sure aint bad to look at either.

1228124,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B001PPGAIA,trebe,"[0, 0]","If you like action and adventure on an epic scale, with an opposites attract love story with beautiful people, set against a huge canvas that includes the outbreak of global war, Australia (2008) may just be the ideal movie for you.  The film is massive in scope, with beautiful cinematography, and action that is capable of exploding with earth shaking consequences.  This is big time filmmaking at grand proportions that captures your attention, featuring Nicole Kidman as Lady Sarah Ashley, a widow in a strange new land, battling to save what is left of her fortune.  Spanning 165 minutes, there may be even a little too much story, as the adventure extends to include the Japanese attack on the continent in December 1941.  A tale of tragedy and triumph, Australia certainly delivers a big bang for your buck.The film opens with intrigue as, Lord Maitland Ashley the owner of the cattle ranch Faraway Downs is killed with a native spear while out on the range.  Lady Sarah has only just arrived from England, and after burying her husband, she finds that she has a ranch about to go under on her hands.  Ranch manager Neil Fletcher (David Wenham) has been stealing cattle, and trying to drive Faraway Downs into the ground, so that King Carney (Bryan Brown) a neighboring rancher can eventually take over.  Fletcher is fired after Nullah (Brandon Walters) an aboriginal boy informs Lady Sarah of the true situation, setting in motion the conflict that will propel much of the film.  With little choice, Lady Sarah turns to Drover (Hugh Jackman), to help drive her cattle across the countryside, so they can be sold at Darwin.The setup is familiar, as the cultured ""Mrs. Boss"" finds herself in a man's world dealing with situations requiring determination and physical strength.  Refusing to quit, she has no options but to depend on her staff, and an apparently crude individual of questionable character.  With her pale completion, native Australian Nicole Kidman looks the part of an Englishwoman completely out of her element.  With the physique of a Greek god, fellow Australian Hugh Jackman makes for one of the most dashing of outback cowboys.  As Lady Sarah learns the ways of the drove and braves the rigors of the outback, her romance with Drover is predictable, but probably sure to satisfy most romantics.What may be less familiar, are elements of Australian culture that play significant roles in the drama.  This includes prejudice against indigenous people, and the relationship between Nullah and his grandfather King George (David Gulpilil), who is suspected of killing Lord Ashley.  Also important are the spiritual elements related to aboriginal life.  King George is a ""gulapa"", a magic man, who helps the group cross the ""Never-Never"" desert.  Lady Ashley develops a special relationship with Nullah after he loses his mother.  Fletcher, Nullah's biological father, is the cause of much tragedy and hardship.A tale of struggle, sacrifice, survival, and love, Australia is a throwback to classic American Westerns, with some feel good Disney-like touches, and a uniquely Australian supernatural element.  The voice of Nullah narrates at points, providing some perspective as the story unfolds.  The special effects and CG green screen tricks more commonly a part of action films, are featured quite prominently here.  The cattle stampede sequence is one of the most impressive examples, as is the attack scene by the Japanese.The acting is quite good, given that the film is something of a romantic fairy tale.  Nicole Kidman shows great range in a strong performance.  Drover isn't given a lot of depth, but Hugh Jackman's performance is exactly what is called for.  The huge diverse supporting cast, apparently features a large number of native Australians, which along with the period costumes, helps give the film a realistic look.  Young Brandon Walters, makes and impressive acting debut, where somehow despite his youth, he manages to convey in his eyes, wisdom beyond his years.  David Gulpilil, perhaps most known for his iconic role in Walkabout (1971), doesn't say much, but as in that previous film, communicates much by his actions and presence.Writer/director Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge) does perhaps overreach by including the war story, and the film gets too melodramatic in the final act.  Still, Australia mostly holds your interest, taking on some surreal aspects in the aftermath of the attack.  This tour de force adventure/drama, is one should touch your heartstrings.  The only real disappointment is that lack of significant extras on the DVD release.  At this time, an upgraded full featured version would seem to be overdue.",4,grand romantic storytelling takes you somewhere over an Australian rainbow...,1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,4674,"['like', 'action', 'adventure', 'epic', 'scale', 'opposites', 'attract', 'love', 'story', 'beautiful', 'people', 'set', 'huge', 'canvas', 'outbreak', 'global', 'war', 'Australia', '2008', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'ideal', 'movie', 'film', 'massive', 'scope', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'action', 'capable', 'exploding', 'earth', 'shaking', 'consequences', 'big', 'time', 'filmmaking', 'grand', 'proportions', 'attention', 'featuring', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'Ashley', 'widow', 'strange', 'new', 'land', 'battling', 'save', 'what', 'left', 'fortune', 'Spanning', '165', 'minutes', 'may', 'be', 'even', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'adventure', 'include', 'Japanese', 'attack', 'continent', 'December', '1941', 'tale', 'tragedy', 'triumph', 'Australia', 'certainly', 'big', 'bang', 'buck.The', 'film', 'intrigue', 'Lord', 'Maitland', 'Ashley', 'owner', 'cattle', 'ranch', 'Faraway', 'Downs', 'killed', 'native', 'spear', 'out', 'range', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'only', 'just', 'arrived', 'England', 'burying', 'husband', 'ranch', 'go', 'hands', 'Ranch', 'manager', 'Neil', 'Fletcher', 'David', 'Wenham', 'been', 'stealing', 'cattle', 'trying', 'drive', 'Faraway', 'Downs', 'ground', 'King', 'Carney', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'neighboring', 'rancher', 'can', 'eventually', 'take', 'over', 'Fletcher', 'fired', 'Nullah', 'Brandon', 'Walters', 'aboriginal', 'boy', 'informs', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'true', 'situation', 'setting', 'motion', 'conflict', 'will', 'propel', 'much', 'film', 'little', 'choice', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'Drover', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'help', 'drive', 'cattle', 'countryside', 'can', 'be', 'sold', 'Darwin.The', 'setup', 'familiar', 'cultured', 'Mrs.', 'Boss', 'man', 'world', 'dealing', 'situations', 'requiring', 'determination', 'physical', 'strength', 'Refusing', 'quit', 'options', 'depend', 'staff', 'apparently', 'crude', 'individual', 'questionable', 'character', 'pale', 'completion', 'native', 'Australian', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'part', 'Englishwoman', 'completely', 'element', 'physique', 'Greek', 'god', 'fellow', 'Australian', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'one', 'most', 'dashing', 'outback', 'cowboys', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'ways', 'drove', 'rigors', 'outback', 'romance', 'Drover', 'predictable', 'probably', 'sure', 'satisfy', 'most', 'romantics.What', 'may', 'be', 'less', 'familiar', 'are', 'elements', 'Australian', 'culture', 'play', 'significant', 'roles', 'drama', 'prejudice', 'indigenous', 'people', 'relationship', 'Nullah', 'grandfather', 'King', 'George', 'David', 'Gulpilil', 'who', 'suspected', 'killing', 'Lord', 'Ashley', 'Also', 'important', 'are', 'spiritual', 'elements', 'related', 'aboriginal', 'life', 'King', 'George', 'gulapa', 'magic', 'man', 'who', 'group', 'cross', 'Never-Never', 'desert', 'Lady', 'Ashley', 'special', 'relationship', 'Nullah', 'mother', 'Fletcher', 'Nullah', 'biological', 'father', 'cause', 'much', 'tragedy', 'hardship.A', 'tale', 'struggle', 'sacrifice', 'survival', 'love', 'Australia', 'throwback', 'classic', 'American', 'Westerns', 'feel', 'good', 'Disney-like', 'touches', 'uniquely', 'Australian', 'supernatural', 'element', 'voice', 'Nullah', 'narrates', 'points', 'providing', 'perspective', 'story', 'unfolds', 'special', 'effects', 'CG', 'green', 'screen', 'tricks', 'more', 'commonly', 'part', 'action', 'films', 'are', 'featured', 'quite', 'prominently', 'here', 'cattle', 'stampede', 'sequence', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'examples', 'attack', 'scene', 'Japanese.The', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'given', 'film', 'something', 'romantic', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'great', 'range', 'strong', 'performance', 'Drover', ""n't"", 'given', 'lot', 'depth', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'performance', 'exactly', 'what', 'called', 'huge', 'diverse', 'supporting', 'cast', 'apparently', 'large', 'number', 'native', 'Australians', 'along', 'period', 'costumes', 'give', 'film', 'realistic', 'look', 'Young', 'Brandon', 'Walters', 'impressive', 'acting', 'debut', 'where', 'somehow', 'youth', 'convey', 'eyes', 'wisdom', 'years', 'David', 'Gulpilil', 'perhaps', 'most', 'known', 'iconic', 'role', 'Walkabout', '1971', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'previous', 'film', 'communicates', 'much', 'actions', 'presence.Writer/director', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'perhaps', 'overreach', 'including', 'war', 'story', 'film', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'final', 'act', 'Still', 'Australia', 'mostly', 'interest', 'taking', 'surreal', 'aspects', 'aftermath', 'attack', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'adventure/drama', 'one', 'should', 'touch', 'heartstrings', 'only', 'real', 'disappointment', 'lack', 'significant', 'extras', 'DVD', 'release', 'time', 'upgraded', 'full', 'featured', 'version', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'overdue']",N/A

To Australia, ""Australia"" is still the second highest grossing movie in Australian film industry. To the audience, mixed reviews are the norm for this $190 million epic that burns a hole nearly in every part of the world.Australia is not half bad. Seriously. It's Baz Luhrmann, the entertaining director who gave us ""Strictly Ballroom"", ""Romeo+Juliet"" and ""Moulin Rouge"". However, it is because of that that makes ""Australia"" failed to please anyone who likes the above films. The thing is, Baz has his own directing style, which worked perfectly with his previous films, but trying to keep his own style while trying to tell a real, serious epic story that involved one of the biggest wars in human history just didn't make it right for him. The product was a mix of style and scenes that actually failed to deliver the required chemistry that the audience was expecting.""Australia"" started off dealing with the topic of the Stolen Generation, but then apart from having an aboriginal boy (who was excellent) and his family to represent the stolen generation and what impact it is having on them, there was virtually nothing really that could touch the audience's heart. It lacks the raw impact of ""Rabbit Proof Fence"" (See my review on this) and ""The Tracker"" when dealing with the Stolen Generation. Although one thing I must say was that I was impressed about the blatant dialogue about ""Breeding out the blacks"" which I don't think we see a lot in international cinemas.The opening of the film looked very Baz and ""Moulin Rogue"" and ""Romeo+Juliet"", you certainly know that it is a Baz movie. But does that kind of entertaining and funny shots actually fit right into the serious notion of ""We are telling the world about Australia's Stolen Generation"" is something else. This inevitably weakened the opening of the film. To be honest, the first half an hour, which was supposed to be used for capturing audience's attention, was so weak that several times I thought switching the terminal (I saw it on a flight) to another channel. It's only my persistent to finish the movie to give it a fair review that I finish this 3 hour ordeal. After the first hour, the movie seems to get its act together again and then it becomes more interesting. However, how many people could be graceful enough to give a 3 hour sit an hour of credit without judging it immediately?A lot of people were complaining Nicole Kidman as the ice queen and the wooden actress but I must say she is not half bad. The thing is Baz unique direction of trying to make her look too much alike to Satine in ""Moulin Rouge"" to distinguish the character's growth into a serious business woman later just really didn't work. Satine gave Nic her first Oscar nomination, but it was such an impressive character that anything trying to play homage or imitate that character will completely destroy it. And that's the main problem with Nic's performance in ""Australia"". Hugh Jackman's character lacks depth until after half way through, and David Wenham's villain is just they need a villain for the movie and there he went. It is surprising that a 3 hour movie could be failing so badly in character development and at the end of the day, you don't seem to understand most of them except for the drastic change of Sarah (Nic) from a aristocrat to a ranch station owner. Nullah was great but suffers a similar fate. However I really enjoyed his relationship with his grandfather King George - and this is the most interesting aspect of the movie. There are other characters throughout but surprisingly some of them are quite memorable - Essie Davis and Jack Thompson, they are both brief characters but very memorable. Yuen Wah as the ranch cook just feels very out of place and one thing I can't understand is why Chinese actors always have to be the one to deliver comic moments in western movies? It is because of the forced comic moments that he has to deliver that I found him very irritating throughout.At the end of the day, ""Australia"" is not that bad. But Baz should know by now that piecing a montage of his previous successful styles won't work on serious movie with a serious topic (if that's what he wants to deliver). Also, naming a movie after Australia itself will not help to promote Australia either, and may in fact have a backlash of killing potential audience's interests. Lastly, avoid hyping a movie too much cause as we all know, the greater the hype the bigger the fall. ""Australia"" was killed by a number of unsuccessful elements embedded in the production itself, but if I want to be honest about it, it is not as bad as the media said. It certainly did not live up to Baz's standards (I mean the one we, the audience set for him) but the bad press is more about the media going in for a kill instead of looking at the movie objectively. I would still recommend it when you have 3 hours to kill (such as on a flight) but don't bring too much expectation to it and you will enjoy it.",3,Clash of Baz Luhrmann,1238112000,"03 27,

Actually Baz Luhrmann's 165-minute epic ""Australia"" looks like two movies in one: an ""Out of Africa""-style melodramatic romance between a man and a woman, and a coming-of-age tale of a young boy, all living in the turbulent pre-WWII era in Australia.In ""Australia,"" instead of Meryl Streep and Robert Redford, Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman play the lead roles. Despite her initial disliking for his (apparent) rough manners, Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman), who has inherited her late husband's cattle station in northern Australia, falls for roguish Drover (Hugh Jackman). Because of the contrived narrative device, the unlikely pair joins forces to accomplish one impossible thing - a long journey to get the 1,500 cattle to the port. And this is only the beginning of the long story.The epic story is told against the background of the country's history. Japanese military forces are poised to attack the country. Not only that. A young boy Nullah, a mixed-blood Aboriginal boy, has to hide from the authorities trying to separate him from his mother and place him in the government's facilities to ""civilize"" him, a topic that Philip Noyce has already taken up in his superb ""Rabbit-Proof Fence.""As you see, so many things are going on and the film doesn't exactly know where to direct its rambling story or when to stop it. When we think the film ends now, it restarts and goes on telling another story, as if teasing us with fake endings. The characters are one-dimensional, but much to his credit, Baz Luhrmann as director seldom bores us with actions, romance and beautiful landscapes. Jackman and Kidman are attractive (as always) and there are lots of talented supports including David Wenham, Jack Thompson and Bryan Brown, plus my favorite actors Barry Otto and Bruce Spence.I don't say ""Australia"" is a bad film. With Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman it cannot be, well, at least as a romance that is eye-pleasing.

1228129,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001PPGAIA,Turfseer,"[7, 8]","**THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**Germaine Greer, writing in the UK Guardian, lambasted 'Australia' for sanitizing the true history of the 'Stolen Generations', the forced removal policy of 'half-caste' Aboriginal children by the Australian government. Greer mainly objects to the depiction of how the Aboriginal workers would have really been treated at a place like Faraway Downs, the 10,000+ acre ranch run by Lady Ashley. She finds it absurd that ""a staff of no more than eight: a disloyal manager, a drunken accountant, three Aboriginal cattle hands, two Aboriginal women and a Chinese cook,"" could run such a vast enterprise as Faraway Downs. But even worse, the Aboriginal workers should have been shown to be basically indentured servants, living in ""humpies', filthy shelters ""with no clean water, no sanitation and no electricity."" Greer is equally incensed about the idea that Lady Ashley and Hugh Jackman's 'Drover' are sympathetic characters who do not represent the way the typical Australian treated the Aboriginal population. ""If white Australians had shown parental feeling towards mixed-race children, generations of them would not have had to be removed from Aboriginal communities by successive governments."" Greer misses the point about what director Baz Luhrmann was trying to do with characters such as Lady Ashley and The Drover. They represent a grafting of a modern sensibility on to the historical period in which the film takes place--a sort of projection of the way things could have been. The characters are not meant to be realistic but Luhrmann's way of atoning for the sins of the past. We see the same strategy in recent German cinema and literature (Atonement and Downfall are two examples) where there is always a set of 'good' characters to balance out the legacy of a genocidal past. Quite the contrary, Luhrmann is constantly reminding us throughout 'Australia' of the past poor treatment of the Aboriginal population. He's much more successful in low-key scenes such as when Nullah is being taunted by a Caucasian boy as he's shipped off to the Mission Island than the depiction of the stereotyped upper-crust Darwin socialites (are they all bigots?).Australia's 'First Act' needs a thorough fix-up. A good 20 to 30 minutes should have been cut from the beginning of the film. In addition to its length, the films' scenarists couldn't decide how to depict their Lady Ashley character. I think what they were going for was obvious: a straight-laced aristocratic type along the lines of Katherine Hepburn's determined missionary in 'The African Queen'. Instead we're offered up a childish and ditsy gal without a back story. Why should we care for Lady Ashley when we first we meet her? She's made out to be ridiculous for the first half hour (Ashley's utter goofiness reaches its apotheosis in the scene where The Drover flings her luggage all about during the fight with the bar patrons and she has a meltdown after her undergarments are spread around all over the muddy street). Luhrmann could do well to come out with a new 'Director's Cut' by shortening the opening act, making Lady Ashley less foolish, inserting a better musical score and generally making Act I less comic in tone.Kidman redeems herself with the break into Act 2. That's where she strikes the evil Fletcher with a whip and orders him off the ranch. From then on it's smooth sailing for Kidman who suddenly has morphed into the brave heroine she's supposed to be. Hugh Jackman does a fine job as the Drover, the outsider who aids Ashley in her quest to save her late husband's ranch. There's a nice buildup to the midpoint where Fletcher and his confederates attempt to thwart the cattle drive by setting multiple fires in the 'never never' leading up to Nullah almost being forced over the side of a cliff. Greer feels that Nullah and his grandfather, King George, especially in the scene where the cattle magically stop moving forward, are invested with 'superhuman' powers and hence that's demeaning to Aboriginal culture. Greer wants more 'developed' characters and perhaps she should see 'Rabbit Proof Fence', a more historically accurate account of the 'Stolen Generations'. Perhaps Luhrmann is putting his Aborginal characters on a bit of pedestal but he never demeans them--quite the contrary he admires the core of that culture which emphasizes a bond with nature as opposed to the other forces which seek to destroy it (there's a great shot of King George walking impassively, searching for the lost Nullah, as the Japanese zeros bomb Darwin from overhead).While Luhrmann has created stock characters of Hollywood epics, the strength of 'Australia' is in the plot. In the second half of Act 2, the action builds to a dark ""all is lost"" moment. Luhrmann makes clever use of the year the story begins, 1939, by alluding to two famous pictures from that year--The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind. 'Over the Rainbow' figures prominently in the story as Nullah seeks some way to reach his true 'home' and the Drover feels much like an updated Clark Gable especially when he appears at the ball clean shaven and then sweeps Lady Ashley off her feet. I was not completely convinced how easily Fletcher went from being a lowly ranch hand to taking over King Carney's position (handled rather quickly in a fleeting montage) but it makes sense for him to kidnap Nullah and his grandfather after Lady Ashley rejects his demands to sell Faraway Downs.'Australia' has several 'all is lost' moments with the Drover believing Lady Ashley has died in the Japanese bombing along with Nullah and the kids seemingly lost on Mission Island. Luhrman ties things up nicely by having King George save Nullah from a deranged Fletcher who blames Lady Ashley for the death of his wife. Australia is a true epic which could use some judicious cutting. Purists will bemoan the anachronisms but this is still a film with its heart in the right place.",3,Epic with good heart still needs 'Director's Cut',1254096000,"09 28, 2009",2009,5948,"['**THIS',

I wasn't sure if I was going to like the movie, but I absolutely loved it and it made my list of top ten films of 2008.Directed by Baz Luhrmann, the movie begins with a written introduction explaining the ""Lost Generation"" of Australians, children who were half-Aborigine and half-white that were taken away from their parents and raised by the government or private organizations.  This is important because even though the film takes pieces from a variety of different genres: adventure, Western, comedy, action, war film, and romance, the movie revolves around one particular child of the Lost Generation, Nullah (Brandon Walters), and his search for identity.Nullah's mother is a servant on the cattle ranch of Lord Ashley and his father is one of Lord Ashley's most trusted ranch hands, Neil Fletcher (David Wenham).  Lady Sarah Ashley believes that her husband is sleeping with an Australian mistress and travels to the cattle ranch to confront her husband.  Instead of confronting her husband with his infidelity, she instead is greeted by recent murder.  She soon learns that her husband had been honest and was giving the ranching life a chance.  The Ashley ranch was the only cattle operation on the continent that was keeping the tyrannical King Carney (Bryan Brown) from having a complete cattle monopoly on the continent.  With the death of Lord Ashley it is assumed that the Carney will now win a prize government contract and squeeze the life out of any competition left.  However, Lady Ashley isn't as frail as she seems and with the help of the nomadic Drover (Hugh Jackman) sets out to win the contract, save the ranch, and keep competition in the cattle trade alive and well on the continent down under.  Of course, along the way she and Drover fall in love.  And all through the journey Nullah is present as Lady Ashley becomes a mother to the orphaned boy and Drover becomes a father figure.  But, that's not all either because in the background is the threat of war as Japan's empire grows and becomes hungry for world conquest.AUSTRALIA is a beautiful film with some of the most gorgeous and spectacular cinematography seen in a film in 2008.  The film brings Australia to life and despite the hardships that living there can bring, it's easy to see how people can fall in love with the place.  There are a few cheesy moments (e.g. Hugh Jackman showering or Hugh Jackman's entrance into a party), but overall the acting is exceptional, especially Brandon Walters as Nullah and many of the secondary performers.  Lady Ashley and Drover are leads next to Nullah, but it is Nullah and the cast of non-lead characters that dominate the film and make the movie from just being an overblown love story into a film about a national epic about the people of Australia.AUSTRALIA was panned by the critics and though it did reasonable at the box office, it was in incredibly expensive film to make (it took about nine months of filming).  However, everyone I've talked to that has seen the movie have really enjoyed it.  It's a great movie that has just the right mix of everything, including a homage to THE WIZARD OF OZ.  I'm sure that with the DVD release AUSTRALIA will become a hit and one of those movies that people will wonder why they never got to see it in theatres.",5,An Epic Journey Down Under,1234828800,"02 17, 2009",2009,3342,"['first', 'saw', 'AUSTRALIA', 'last', 'November', 'birthday', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'made', 'list', 'top', 'ten', 'films', '2008.Directed', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'movie', 'written', 'introduction', 'explaining', 'Lost', 'Generation', 'Australians', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'half-Aborigine', 'half-white', 'were', 'taken', 'away', 'parents', 'raised', 'government', 'private', 'organizations', 'important', 'even', 'film', 'pieces', 'variety', 'different', 'genres', 'adventure', 'Western', 'comedy', 'action', 'war', 'film', 'romance', 'movie', 'one', 'particular', 'child', 'Lost', 'Generation', 'Nullah', 'Brandon', 'Walters', 'search', 'identity.Nullah', 'mother', 'servant', 'cattle', 'ranch', 'Lord', 'Ashley', 'father', 'one', 'Lord', 'Ashley', 'most', 'trusted', 'ranch', 'hands', 'Neil', 'Fletcher', 'David', 'Wenham', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'Ashley', 'husband', 'sleeping', 'Australian', 'mistress', 'travels', 'cattle', 'ranch', 'confront', 'husband', 'Instead', 'confronting', 'husband', 'infidelity', 'instead', 'greeted', 'recent', 'murder', 'soon', 'husband', 'had', 'been', 'honest', 'was', 'giving', 'ranching', 'life', 'chance', 'Ashley', 'ranch', 'was', 'only', 'cattle', 'operation', 'continent', 'was', 'keeping', 'tyrannical', 'King', 'Carney', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'having', 'complete', 'cattle', 'monopoly', 'continent', 'death', 'Lord', 'Ashley', 'assumed', 'Carney', 'will', 'now', 'win', 'prize', 'government', 'contract', 'squeeze', 'life', 'competition', 'left', 'However', 'Lady', 'Ashley', ""n't"", 'as', 'frail', 'help', 'nomadic', 'Drover', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'out', 'win', 'contract', 'save', 'ranch', 'keep', 'competition', 'cattle', 'trade', 'alive', 'well', 'continent', 'down', 'course', 'way', 'Drover', 'fall', 'love', 'journey', 'Nullah', 'present', 'Lady', 'Ashley', 'mother', 'orphaned', 'boy', 'Drover', 'father', 'figure', 'not', 'either', 'background', 'threat', 'war', 'Japan', 'empire', 'grows', 'becomes', 'hungry', 'world', 'conquest.AUSTRALIA', 'beautiful', 'film', 'most', 'gorgeous', 'spectacular', 'cinematography', 'seen', 'film', '2008', 'film', 'Australia', 'life', 'hardships', 'living', 'can', 'bring', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'fall', 'love', 'place', 'are', 'few', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'e.g', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'showering', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'entrance', 'party', 'acting', 'exceptional', 'especially', 'Brandon', 'Walters', 'Nullah', 'many', 'secondary', 'performers', 'Lady', 'Ashley', 'Drover', 'are', 'next', 'Nullah', 'Nullah', 'cast', 'non-lead', 'characters', 'dominate', 'film', 'make', 'movie', 'just', 'being', 'overblown', 'love', 'story', 'film', 'national', 'epic', 'people', 'Australia.AUSTRALIA', 'was', 'panned', 'critics', 'did', 'reasonable', 'box', 'office', 'was', 'incredibly', 'expensive', 'film', 'make', 'took', 'about', 'nine', 'months', 'filming', 'However', 'everyone', ""'ve"", 'talked', 'seen', 'movie', 'have', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'great', 'movie', 'just', 'right', 'mix', 'everything', 'including', 'homage', 'THE', 'WIZARD', 'OF', 'OZ', ""'m"", 'sure', 'DVD', 'release', 'AUSTRALIA', 'will', 'become', 'hit', 'one', 'movies', 'people', 'will', 'wonder', 'why', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'theatres']",N/A

He even hinted at it himself with regards to Gone With The Wind. He wanted a glorious epic of mass proportions but what he really created was a long, beautiful, but sometimes dull film. He strived for perfection but clearly didn't quite make it.I am a HUGE fan of Moulin Rouge. I love everything about it-the music, the acting, the costumes and the story. I can see some of that shining through in Australia as well. The beautiful array of colors, just splendid choreography and direction, there is no question about that. The problem lies with the script and the plot.This movie did not need to be over 3 hours long. I do not mind sitting through a film that long- I have done plenty of times before. But there were obvious parts that just dragged and some that were not necessary at all. The parts with the cattle drive were especially tedious, and that was most of the film...The 'magic' aspect didn't really fit into this. It worked in Moulin Rouge but for obvious reasons. This to me, is more of a serious film with serious issues. Stealing aborigines children and removing them from their home is something that should have been the main aspect of the plot. But it was muddled along with the other, less important subplots. Of course there is a bad guy-nicely played by David Wenham, and a hero-Hugh Jackman.Jackman is the true gem in this film. He carries basically the entire film and at least makes it more interesting to watch.  Nicole Kidman, usually a huge favorite of mine, seemed somewhat lost in this. She appeared to overdo most of her lines and while she looked lovely in her part, it just didn't suit her all that well. I was a bit surprised at that. The little aborigine boy, played by Brandon Walters was a heartwarming surprise. His acting,  I thought, was extroadinary.The climax of the film was more anticlimatic than anything. Just a tad predictable. I am indifferent with how it played out, though the very end gave me a slight lump in my throat...All in all, a worthy and well-made film. Clearly it took a lot of time and effort on everybody's part and should be commended.

The story's simply not very compelling and the characters aren't that interesting. The best character is a ""creamy"" (half black/half white) boy, but when the Japs attack at the end -- and the aftermath -- I didn't really care what happened.What went wrong? You can trace it to the fact that I failed to get hooked into the story in the first hour and so I sat there half-attentive and mildly bored throughout the rest. So I guess the problem lies with the writing. The filmmakers have the responsibility of making the characters, their world and their challenges come alive, but they failed. I don't fault the actors, as they did the best they could with what they had and Jackman's always a superlative protagonist.Lesser problems include an odd tone that's quirky and sometimes semi-goofy, as well as the decision to grace the Aborigines with mystical powers. (Isn't it ironic how, after a couple hundred years of being treated as subhuman savages, Native peoples in the Americas and Australia/New Zealand are now adorned with god-like powers and sage-like stature in cinema?) Although ""Australia"" is essentially an adventure-drama Western, these two factors take away from the believability. So don't expect the realism of historical adventure-dramas like 1992's ""The Last of the Mohicans"" or ""Pearl Harbor,"" rather expect an adventure-drama with a good helping of Indiana Jones. This might sound great on paper (I love Indiana Jones), but it somewhat fails in execution.Still, it's not bad and there are numerous highlights, like the scenic locations and all-around quality movie-making. I just wish they would've fit an interesting story and characters into the mix.GRADE: C",3,"Nice locations and good cast, but not compelling",1391212800,"02 1, 2014",2014,2241,"['Australia', '2008', 'interesting', 'study', 'cinema', 'wannabe', 'epic', 'Western', 'place', 'Australia', 'time', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'attack', 'got', 'good', 'plot', 'solid', 'cast', 'headed', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'excellent', 'Northern', 'Australia', 'locations', 'great', 'CGI', 'loads', 'drama', 'number', 'thrilling', 'scenes', 'including', 'revolving', 'around', 'massive', 'cattle', 'drive', 'Jap', 'attack', 'film', 'cost', '130', 'million', '2', 'hours', '45', 'minutes', 'something', ""n't"", 'click', 'come', 'together', 'cohesive', 'whole', 'story', 'simply', 'not', 'very', 'compelling', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'best', 'character', 'creamy', 'half', 'white', 'boy', 'when', 'Japs', 'attack', 'end', 'aftermath', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'can', 'trace', 'fact', 'failed', 'get', 'hooked', 'story', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'sat', 'there', 'half-attentive', 'mildly', 'bored', 'rest', 'guess', 'problem', 'writing', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'responsibility', 'making', 'characters', 'world', 'challenges', 'come', 'alive', 'failed', 'do', ""n't"", 'fault', 'actors', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'what', 'had', 'Jackman', 'always', 'superlative', 'protagonist.Lesser', 'problems', 'include', 'odd', 'tone', 'quirky', 'sometimes', 'semi-goofy', 'as', 'well', 'decision', 'grace', 'Aborigines', 'mystical', 'powers', ""n't"", 'ironic', 'how', 'couple', 'hundred', 'years', 'being', 'treated', 'subhuman', 'savages', 'Native', 'peoples', 'Americas', 'Australia/New', 'Zealand', 'are', 'now', 'adorned', 'god-like', 'powers', 'sage-like', 'stature', 'cinema', 'Australia', 'essentially', 'adventure-drama', 'Western', 'two', 'factors', 'take', 'away', 'believability', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'realism', 'historical', 'adventure-dramas', '1992', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'rather', 'expect', 'adventure-drama', 'good', 'helping', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'might', 'sound', 'great', 'paper', 'love', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'somewhat', 'execution.Still', 'not', 'bad', 'are', 'numerous', 'highlights', 'scenic', 'locations', 'all-around', 'quality', 'movie-making', 'just', 'would', ""'ve"", 'fit', 'interesting', 'story', 'characters', 'mix.GRADE', 'C']",N/A

Saavedra,"[0, 1]","This is a brilliantly executed story about true happenings in Australia including the `missionary work' ~ you know the lies told justifying one's cruelty, racism, horrible acts by saying one is doing God's work which among other things was until 1973 the forcible abduction and removal of Aborigine Children from their families and homes by the ignorant ruling class of Australia; life in Australia for all in pre World War II; language, traditions and growing up as an Aborigine after whites displaced the natives.The movie is a bit slow in the beginning, but it does pull through at the end, though without giving away spoilers, it does uncourageously still make the religious look `good, heroic' like their willing participation and possibly instigation of `saving the heathens souls' by stealing as many native children from their families and homes and imprisoning them in mission schools could in ANY lifetime be considered good work, or the choice of an `intelligent, benevolent, all-knowing being.'Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman seemed a bit stiff in their roles for the first half of the movie, but did great the second half.Hats off to David Wenham who did a brilliant job as a hateful, cruel character, I still want to beat the #!%# out of him.All the aborigine actors did a beautiful job of telling a story from that character's point of view: the woman raped by any white man who felt inclined; the young boy, Nullah who's father was a white ignoramous; the tracker enslaved to the whites; the shaman; and the brother and friend of Hugh Jackman's character.
