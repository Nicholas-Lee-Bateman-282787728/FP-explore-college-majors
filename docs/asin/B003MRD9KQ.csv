Here's the link to the full episode list, if this system allows it to post through:[...]As you can see, there were seven episodes, not 8 as some have misremembered, the first airing on 2 December 1976 and the last on 13 January 1977.All seven episodes are present and accounted for, sir!Episodes 1 and 7 were two hour episodes, the rest being an hour each. That was a total of 540 minutes of air time, INCLUDING THE COMMERCIALS. Take the commercials out and you're down to 400-some-odd minutes... exactly what's on this disc set.I found the quality to be as good as possible considering the source material: a TV miniseries in the days before Hi Def. I also just watched ""Rich Man, Poor Man"", from the same era, and the quality was exactly the same.My discs functioned flawlessly. The interactive menu works just fine.Now, for those who have read the book -- as I have -- this miniseries never did contain the entire book. I remember thinking that at the time of the original airing. The original novel carries the story further in time than the TV show did. Obviously a decision the producers and network made at the time... and obviously it's too late to change that now.So, if you liked it then and want to revisit it, do so with confidence. It aged well!If you haven't seen it, you should. There aren't too many works around that were written by people who lived that era of the military, and especially not many that are done so well. Irwin Shaw did it with ""The Young Lions"". Jones's ""From Here To Eternity"" trilogy.

When I viewed the mini-series I almost stopped after the first ten minutes due to the distractions caused by the scratches and light flickers in the film.  Either the Timeless Media Group--who released the Blu-ray and DVD versions--did not bother to look for or could not find a quality film stock for transfer; while I have not viewed the DVD format, I would guess that it is little better.  As for the clarity, sharpness, and color enhancement usually found in Blu-ray discs, ""Once An Eagle"" hardly seems to be of the quality I would expect; then again, this is a very old TV film and therefore not really suitable for transferring to Blu-ray format.The ""Blu-ray Features"" are limited to ""Interactive Menus"" and ""Chapter Selections,"" which one would expect on any DVD or Blu-ray disc.  There are NO bonus features and no playback options.  As would be expected, all seven ""chapters"" of the mini-series are on one disc (rather than two discs found with the DVD format).  As for the question of story continuity reported in reviews of the DVD, I did not notice any problems with the Blu-ray--the story flowed very well and nothing seemed out of order.  While I have not bothered to time the end credits, which are scrolled after the seventh ""Chapter"" only, I am going to assume that the lack of full end credits after each ""Chapter"" accounts for the discrepency between the complete running time listed at various web sites as 540 minutes and the listed playback time for the Blu-ray/DVD as 520 minutes.Having never seen the mini-series on TV, I purchased this film with no expectations other than it was a Sam Elliot movie; nor have I read the book.  As such, I found ""Once An Eagle"" to be a good movie that both entertained and engrossed me, while the acting was of the quality typical for ""high end"" made for television movies.  The movie reminded me ofThe Wings of Eagleswith John Wayne; albeit, the later is about the Army/Navy Air Corps and ""Once An Eagle"" is about the US Army Infantry.I recommend looking up the show on Wikipedia for more information about the content of the movie and for critical reactions to it.

1354419,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B003MRD9KQ,MadMacs,"[2, 3]","I hope this review finds a home amongst the long suffering hardcore fans who must've been in agony (30+ years!) for the official release. But it's here and I hope you guys enjoy the well-deserved DVD production.First off, I'm a huge fan of the tv mini-series format that ran from the 70's thru the late 80's, and I was stunned that I had never heard of this production before. Not once ever. As I think about it, I'm still amazed that this slipped past for so long.I read all 35 reviews that were posted here since 1998 (IMDB reviews) - and I agree with all of you wholeheartedly - this was a fantastic and truly wonderful production.And I also agree it was a dastardly crime that it took this long for 'Once An Eagle' to be given back to the viewing public.Okay, onto the review. (some spoilers - so be warned)As new fan of the series, I was surprised at how good the story that was told. Typically, as others have mentioned, the WWII drama is over the top, hyper-melodramatic and ultimately ""Hollywood-ized"" - presenting a false empty impression of the lives of soldiers, both officers and enlisted; especially those soldiers who did their service in between WWI and WWII. Can you imagine being a 2LT for 17 years?!?You couldn't have better defined the transition between a peacetime Army and wartime Army. The crafty officers who ably played the political game often meant that battle troops would be left behind in the promotions department; creating the initial paper-pusher trained service that combat hardened Imperial Japanese forces could take advantage of.Love that scene when John Fujioka, despite portraying an army officer who looks suspiciously like Hideki Tojo, clearly represented the real-life naval attach&eacute; to Washington D.C. in that period - a certain Captain Isoroku Yamamoto who often deftly deflected concerns that Imperial Japan would ever be a threat to the United States. That clever warrior. He was already on a war footing back in '28, thirteen years before Pearl.And very interestingly, I enjoyed how the production dealt with Court's homosexuality without having to confront it, which would have skewed the storyline in a pathetic attempt to validate some kind of political point, either pro or con. Very well done. Subtlety like this is a lost art in today's world of screaming-in-your-face lack of diplomatic skills. I realize that some may disagree with me here. But that's my impression given the collective scenes of the man on a personal level; what little there was to reveal - was very revealing indeed.I've read the comparisons between this and 'Winds Of War'. Until I had seen 'Eagle' - I would've been hard pressed to say that anything was better for the period. And because of the budget, obviously the battle scenes will always favor Winds. But the true character and temperament of the war, the men and women who were involved - you have to watch Once An Eagle.My only serious complaint was the ending. It felt like it was shortened by one episode, with many unanswered and unresolved questions. For example:- What happened with Sam's decision to hold Court responsible for his actions at ""Palladium""? Of course he stuck to his guns and went forward, but what about after?- The point at which 'Palladium' occurs suggests the latter part of the war, mid-to-late 1944. There was still a lot of fighting and many battles left in the Pacific theater - was Sam ever given a chance to command again? Or did he lose his chance by accusing a fellow officer of dereliction and murder? Typically those charges in an official inquiry will always taint both officers involved - irrespective of the results, but the ending doesn't point to any single foregone conclusion.- Did Sam and Tommie ever resolve their issues with one another, the loss of their son, and get back together? I know that things pointed in that direction, but to see them put Donny to rest *as a couple* and move on would have been a reward for viewers who traveled with them throughout their amazing journey. A summation, perhaps after the war had ended, showing them at the home on the lake. Something.- Was Jinny ever able to settle down and find a life of her own apart from her highly dysfunctional family?- Was it possible, however remotely, that Donny somehow survived? I know they had the funeral, meaning the Army Air Corp was able to retrieve the remains. But it happened back then that some aviators survived - concealing their American identities by tossing their dog tags into a pile of burning wreckage to throw off & evade opposing forces, attempting to contact partisans, and maybe even make it back to the allied lines.Even a counting of... skulls... would mean little if the B-29 stuck bottom first - the ball turret gunner's body would have essentially disintegrated making an accurate accounting improbable. Or even worse - had the B29 been unable to drop its payload before impact - what would the corps troops think? The bodies, what little remained, would be completely destroyed thereby making a count of the tags meaningless if not impossible. I can't see how anyone could make an honest appraisal in those situations. Questions like these haunted families for years afterwards, so I honestly see it as possible.Overall - fantastic and well worth the 7 hours spent.I always and thoroughly enjoy stumbling onto a hidden unexpected gem. :-)",4,"Excellent!

It is based on the novel of the same name by Anton Myrer. The book is required reading in the military schools because through the two main characters the reader/viewer learns the difference in leadership style and what it takes to be a true leader of men.The story traces the careers of 2 men from WW1 thru WW2. One is a martinet while the other is a leader. Action sequences are scattered throughout the movie but it is mainly the story of these two men and those surrounding them. It is also about the military ""system"" and the sacrifices soldiers...and their families... make to serve their countryI highly recommend both the book and the movie and look forward to the new DVD release. Anyone remotely interested in the military will enjoy both book and movie.

Who could ever say this is a good movie is beyond me.  ""War"" scenes are shot in the back lot at Universal, and look exactly that.  And of the eight episodes, only two have any semblance of military in them.  The rest are all silly, cheesy, soap opera.  I only liked the first episode.  I hated all of the rest.  All of this thing is shot in the lot at Universal, and how some raters can say, ""better than Winds of War"" is absurd.
