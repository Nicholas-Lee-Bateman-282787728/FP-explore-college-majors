In this series produced by CNN in the late 90s, the entire history of the Cold War is looked at.In twenty-four episodes, each major event that took place during the Cold War is examined. From the diplomatic relations between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. and to the military conflicts from Korea, to Vietnam, and Afghanistan. In addition to the history, many people that were directly involved in Cold War events are interviewed. These include military personnel, politicians, diplomats, activists, and others.The story of the Cold War in this series is told from both sides of the Iron Curtain.I would recommend this DVD set to those interested in history.",5,Excellent Cold War History,1377216000,"08 23, 2013",2013,826,"['Cold', 'War', 'refers', 'constant', 'tension', 'United', 'States', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'respective', 'allies', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'early', '1990s', 'series', 'produced', 'CNN', 'late', '90s', 'entire', 'history', 'Cold', 'War', 'looked', 'at.In', 'twenty-four', 'episodes', 'major', 'event', 'took', 'place', 'Cold', 'War', 'examined', 'diplomatic', 'relations', 'U.S.', 'U.S.S.R.', 'military', 'conflicts', 'Korea', 'Vietnam', 'Afghanistan', 'addition', 'history', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'directly', 'involved', 'Cold', 'War', 'events', 'are', 'interviewed', 'include', 'military', 'personnel', 'politicians', 'diplomats', 'activists', 'others.The', 'story', 'Cold', 'War', 'series', 'told', 'sides', 'Iron', 'Curtain.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'set', 'interested', 'history']",Cold War (DVD)

Over the course of 24 episodes (each of which runs for about 45 minutes), this series lays out the history of the Cold War, from beginning to end, in more detail than I ever thought possible.  This is, without question, the documentary series to watch if you want to learn about the Cold War.  It is packed full of interviews with men and women who made history -- politicians and policymakers, diplomats and dissidents, soldiers and spies, advisors and activists -- as well as with men and women who simply lived through that history and are willing to share their experiences of what life was like for ordinary people during the time of the Cold War.  Each episode is packed full of the best available film footage of the events being covered; and the story behind those events is told in clear and concise terms by narrator Kenneth Branagh (the noted Shakespearian actor and film director).  I can't even imagine a better, or more thorough treatment of the history of the Cold War.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this documentary series to students, teachers, and anyone who wants to learn more about this fascinating period in world history.  I should also note that this 6 disc DVD set comes with two bonus features: On disc 5 is an excellent extended interview with Fidel Castro, which focuses mainly on the events of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and which is well worth watching; and on disc 6 is an old, rather hokey, anticommunist propaganda film from 1952, which does a great job of illustrating how Americans saw the ""Red Menace"" back in the early days of the Cold War.

1523866,A16SVA8SZIJ0I7,B00701QYIE,"R. Fairbank ""Rod Fairbank""","[4, 5]","Concerned that the Cold War would slip into history, ignored and forgotten, Ted Turner hired 'World at War' producer Jeremy Isaacs to create a similar documentary about the conflict.  He succeeded in fine style - using the same narrative techniques as before.  As the box says: ""A massive three-year effort.... team shot more than 1000 hours of original footage and screened 1500 hours of archival film material.... travelled to 31 countries and conducted more than 500 interviews, many with key players at the time who rarely go before the cameras.""  My guess is that those interviewed knew this would be their last and best chance to state their case.Is 'The Cold War' perfect?  No -  but it's close enough for me.  I realize that not everyone has the time to watch 18.7 hours on the subject.  In 6 disks with 4 chapters apiece, a lot of time is covered -  from the end of World War I and the Russian Revolution up to the dissolution of the Soviet Union.  As with 'World at War', the producers do not follow an exact linear timeline.  Instead, they explore different topics in detail - with frequent overlaps in time periods, geography and personalities.  They interview policy makers and regular folks on all sides -  I say all sides because there were many sides to the Cold War and many interpretations, depending on who's doing the talking.  In a careful combination of interviews, historical footage, sound and silence, they convey the emotional reality of events and what people were thinking, why they believed they were right, what they feared and what they hoped to achieve.I won't provide a precis of each chapter or a list of interviews (get the program for that).  However, here are a few things that left a lingering impression:-  The poverty and desperation of defeated or oppressed nations, which are beyond the comprehension of most Americans.-  The selfishness and shortsighted bungling of the European powers after WW1 equaled anything you might find in Iraq or Afghanistan today.  They were not up to the aspirations that Woodrow Wilson had for them.-  Without the quick infusion of Marshall Plan money and aggressive CIA meddling, Greece and Italy would probably have gone communist and become East Bloc satellites.-  I didn't know much about the joint efforts of the Vatican and the CIA in tilting Italian elections.  This was mirrored 4 decades later in the cooperation of Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II in toppling the Jaruzelski regime in Poland.-  The successful occupations of Germany and Japan are surely among our country's greatest achievements.  The world's 2 most destructive nations were transformed into prosperous and stable societies.-  If you think spies have guilt or remorse for their treachery, think again:  Kim Philby went to his grave a loyal servant of the KGB; Aldrich Ames is sorry he got caught.-  It's worth noting that most US traitors turned sides for a banal reason: money.-  The Hungarian rebellion of 1956 has echoes in today's Syria.  Oppressed people fight for freedom and sheer physical survival; western nations cheer from the sidelines and salute them - but offer no direct aid.  They have their reasons: the US was not going to risk a nuclear war over Hungary - just as it is not going to risk a direct war with Iran today.-  The series offers deeper understanding of the Cuban missile crisis.  Today, it is portrayed as a colossal blunder by Khrushchev and a brilliant feat of statecraft by Kennedy.  In reality, it was a high-speed collision of 3 ambitious men: Khrushchev, Kennedy and Castro.  All 3 played a role in creating the crisis; 2 of them (JFK and Khrushchev) defused it; Castro was left out in the cold, furious that his loyalty to the Soviets left him with little to show for it.-  It's not wise to get complacent and think we can predict the future: 1 year after the crisis, Kennedy was dead; 2 years after, Khrushchev was tossed out of power.  Today, 51 years later, Castro is still alive, with his government intact, enjoying a comfortable seaside retirement.-  The Cold War ended without the firing of a single nuclear weapon.-  However, it was not 'won' for free.  At the very end, Isaacs wraps it up exactly as I knew he would: with a sober accounting of the Cold War's cost in human lives (millions of deaths - mostly civilian - in Korea, Vietnam and Afghanistan; hundreds of thousands in Africa and South America),  trillions of dollars, shattered hopes and lost opportunities.Some of the interviews are too short.  There's no way around this, really.  If everyone was given adequate time, the result would be a 600-hour TV show - which would not get a lot of viewers.  I see that this program has garnered only 28 Amazon reviews.  I hope it will find its way into high school and junior college curricula.",5,Ted Turner + Jeremy Isaacs = this great program,1365465600,"04 9, 2013",2013,4793,"['Concerned', 'Cold', 'War', 'would',

1523867,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B00701QYIE,Roger J. Buffington,"[1, 1]","""Cold War"" is mostly superb analysis and history of the major issues of the Cold War between the West and the Communist powers.  Having lived through most of this period I thought that I was pretty knowledgeable about most of the major issues presented here, and I was hugely surprised at how much I learned from this series (and how much I had not known).  Since this series was done by CNN I had my doubts about its objectivity, but mostly I believe that the analysis here is spot-on.  There are a few exceptions.  One episode of the series seems to draw a false equivalence between the Soviet Gulag system on the one hand, and America's ""McCarthy Era"" of anti-communist hysteria.  This is, of course, rubbish -- one imprisoned millions of innocent citizens while the other involved really only a small number of people suffering injustice, largely not affecting the average American citizen much or at all (which does not, of course, make it right).  Setting this anomaly aside, this series is largely brilliant.  Now that the old Soviet Union is no more, many of the commentators are former Soviet military and political figures who appear to be speaking quite candidly and with apparent truthfulness.  For example, who knew that the KGB was never told that the Soviet military was deploying IRBMs in Eastern Europe until it discovered this by its usual means of espionage?  The Soviet officials portray this deployment as an out-of-control military-industrial complex that just kept ""running the conveyor"" of missile production and deployment that for a long time no one in the Soviet government could stop.  (This had the effect of motivating America to deploy Pershing II IRBMs in Germany which were capable of striking Russian targets; that led to very significant arms reductions down the road).  This series presents many other equally fascinating insights.  The nature of the Sino-Soviet disputes is truly analyzed here.  Far from being a monolith, the Communist leaders are seen to be human beings engaged in power struggles, nationalist rivalry, and very human interpersonal rivalries.Anyone who is interested in the Cold War and the history of the struggle between the West and Communism will find this series to be an amazing and rewarding viewing experience.  Most will view this series many times.  This is a terrific value.  Highly recommended.

For me, having grown up in the 60s, for some reason, even now in the 21st century, when the subject of the military or space comes up, I find myself lapsing into old habits and referring to the Russians as Soviets.This presentation is a balanced representation of the events, not particularly biased toward either side.I can recommend this for a classroom presentation, or for a school or academic library.",5,This is a well done overview of the Cold War,1381276800,"10 9, 2013",2013,707,"['One', 'disadvantages', 'living', 'period', 'history', 'made', 'lack', 'objectivity', 'having', 'grown', 'up', 'Cold', 'War', 'are', 'still', 'things', 'remember', 'fear', 'anger', 'would', 'not', 'respond', 'emotionally', 'were', 'looking', 'material', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'having', 'grown', 'up', '60s', 'reason', 'even', 'now', '21st', 'century', 'when', 'subject', 'military', 'space', 'up', 'find', 'lapsing', 'old', 'habits', 'referring', 'Russians', 'Soviets.This', 'presentation', 'balanced', 'representation', 'events', 'not', 'particularly', 'biased', 'side.I', 'can', 'recommend', 'classroom', 'presentation', 'school', 'academic', 'library']",Cold War (DVD)

Let me say this is now tied in my opinion with ""The World At Way"" as the best historic documentary I have seen. In fact if I did not know better I would have thought this was a continuation of the eariler series. The footage is great and the many interviews with the people who were part of the Cold War are fantastic. In many cases you see footage of someone from the 1950's and that is followed by an interview with the same person. Anyone who wants to know the history of the 50+ years ""Cold War"" should run and buy this DVD set.",5,One of the best Doc's ever.,1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,616,"['Have', 'so', 'far', 'viewed', 'first', '8', 'parts', 'epic', '24', 'part', 'series', 'Cold', 'War', 'Let', 'say', 'now', 'tied', 'opinion', 'World', 'Way', 'best', 'historic', 'documentary', 'have', 'seen', 'fact', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'was', 'continuation', 'eariler', 'series', 'footage', 'great', 'many', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'part', 'Cold', 'War', 'are', 'fantastic', 'many', 'cases', 'see', 'footage', 'someone', '1950', 'followed', 'interview', 'same', 'person', 'Anyone', 'who', 'know', 'history', '50+', 'years', 'Cold', 'War', 'should', 'run', 'buy', 'DVD', 'set']",Cold War (DVD)
