Season 2 is back and better then ever. HBO really capitalized on this opportunity and this TV series caught on. In season two we are introduced to a character that we saw at the end of season 1 named Mary Ann. She is some sort of creature that people cannot figure out but she plays the biggest part in season 2. We get more closer to where certain relationship's stand overall as well. There is less sexual content in this season which is not a bad thing but they definitely cut out allot of sex scenes that mad season 1 so cutting edge for its time. There was allot of good things in this season, including more Eric and Sookie interaction. You can tell with those two characters that they are building to something big I feel between Bill and Eric for season 3 even though I have not seen any of season three except the first 10 minutes yet. Also they way they ended this season will make you want to come back for more and buy the third season. Sookie is not sure if she wants to get married to bill, when she goes to the bathroom to contimpatle this decision Bill is taken away by people that are not shown. It leaves you with Sookie running out saying yes Bill I will marry you but no one is there and there is a sign of forced struggled. Brilliant job on the part of True Blood and it will truly leave you wanting to come back for more in season 3. I have to give it up again True Blood season 2 did it again it won me over another 5/5 stars. Even though it is not as good as season 1 it is not far behind and it is that goo still that it deserves a prefect score. Make sure to pick up both of these DVD's.

1254722,A3TP31S61PPE3G,B00280LZAE,AlexJouJou,"[2, 3]","I loved Season 1. Season 2 just gets an ""I liked it"" and that is a bit generous. It would be more accurate to say I liked parts of it.I have read and loved the books. I do not expect a series based on the books to be exactly the same. I'm good if it is inspired by or similar to - no need for a carbon copy. After all I've read the books and already imagined that. I fell in love with the characters so if you go somewhere else for the TV version that's cool with me. That said what were they thinking with this season? It seemed aimless - as if the writers could not figure out what they really wanted to do so they just did a ""little bit"" of a bunch of things - leaving too much focus on inconsequential people and things and not enough where it really needed it to continue maturing story lines and characters and providing more depth. If it was a book the plot would be paper thin.Keep in mind my review is just that. Mine. I do not watch much TV (mostly because much of what is on nowadays is just so pitiful I cannot be bothered to waste moments of my life exploring it)Here is what I thought they did well:1. Godric's storyline - Great. Wonderful actor, well portrayed, did what good TV is supposed to do - gave us more insight into Eric and a depth of emotion we had not previously seen. Contrasted the complications that coming ""out"" brought to the vampires and what can happen internally when you exist so long that life loses all meaning whatsoever. Masterful. Poignant and enriching.2. Fellowship of the Sun storyline - I thought this was very good. A little too dramatic and one dimensional but it is TV.3. Andy's storyline - to some degree was well done. It gave you a real sense of his issues (he's prominent in the books) and the interactions between him and the Sheriff are priceless.4. Hoyt's storyline - I really liked Hoyt's storyline. The issues with his mom and Jessica. A great new spin on meet the mom. Jessica and Hoyt's romance is well played - with just enough tension to keep you interested but as they are both relatively innocent (in some ways) it comes off as a first love bringing back all those nostalgic moments. I found myself smiling when they were on screen. Actors have good chemistry as well.5. Bill and Lenore - they had more chemistry than Bill and Sookie..although it was a overacted in many places it still allowed you to see a bit of Bill's past. Give you a sense of who he was and is and why.6. Barry - Superb. SO wish it had been more explored. GREAT part of the storyline..I mean in the 1st season so much is about Sookie and what she can do and how different she is (more than human)..why could we not go further?What they did not do well1. Bill and Sookie - first I have never warmed up to either of these actors. I don't know why but there are times I almost cringe when they are on screen. They have chemistry but it's just not strong enough to carry the show. Apparently the writers think this too as they've added so many more storylines this year - really there would be no need if this lead couple could take the lead. I'm not speaking here about the fact the books are written only from Sookie's viewpoint - of course that would be too limiting for a TV show. And I get the Soap opera qualities - and the shift between stories all the time. Unfortunately some of the best moments of the show are not between Bill and Sookie. They are between Eric and Sookie, Godric and Eric, Hoyt and Jessica, etc.2. Vampire Queen - Oh my. Not even sure where to start? Somebody got Gossip Girl in my True Blood. Lame. Very very lame. Please do not continue to torture your viewers like this HBO. I like the actress just fine but in this it just makes a mockery out of a cool character and storyline. Way too campy.3. Sam's storyline with Daphne - which seems excellent at first and degenerates into yet more lame-ness. Sam finally redeems himself in the end but through much of the season he comes off as weak and scared and pitiful. He deserves better as a character. Good actor as well.4. Tara and Eggs - First Eggs is HOT. I mean that with a capital H. Whoa momma. Man is fine. The scenes with Tara and him were scorching. But when they started that weird orgy stuff - ish. Just yuck. I had hoped he would stick around for another season - there were a lot of places to go with his character. Somehow though those two on screen just never equalled the times it was Sookie and Eric or one of the other couples. Tara this year was also extremely irritating - please change this for season 3.And, finally, the epic failure of the Maryann storyline. Where do you even start with this? Dear God if I wanted to see a bunch of middle age folks having an orgy I'd, well, I wouldn't but if I did I'd just buy the DVD or hit the adult store. SO unappealing. I actually made my lemon face and fast forwarded during these parts. Seriously how hard is it to just get a bunch of actors (no special talent needed), strip them, and have them look like they are having sex? Is that what I pay for? The whole thing was like a bad B movie that I caught at a drive-in 20 years ago necking with my boyfriend. And we paid $1 each to get in.What do I want to see:1. More politics and interactions with the VAMPIRES. The show is about VAMPIRES. Not weird ancient creatures who turn into Bulls and make people into Zombies. The Vampire Queen, Sheriff's, conflicts within the vampire community - how humans interact now that vampires are ""out"". The core of what the show is about.2. More storyline with Eric and his crew - they have a lot of charisma and some of the best moments are when they are on screen. We need more. Much more. If you have to have tons of sex scenes let's see more Eric! He's mysterious and multi dimensional. And he's cuter than Bill by far. Plus Pam is funny - hopefully we'll see more of her in Season 3.3. More about Sookie and the vampires. Her interactions with them, the danger she gets into, why she is drawn to them, more exploration. I gotta be honest and say I'm not a fan of the actress herself much..but I'd rather have her than the whole Maryann crud.What I hope:That this sophmore slump (slide, downturn, crash, plummet, etc) of this season makes way for a Season 3 that is heavy on the good parts (politics, humans and vampire conflict, character growth and depth, storyline expansion, MUCH more vampire backstory, a little more higher end intelligence and snark and way less campy B grade movie junk).It gets 4 stars because of the good things. Godric and Eric's storyline elevates it a complete 2 stars (from 2 to 4 stars by the way). I cried when Godric met the sun. However, I almost took a star back on account of the severe lameness of the Vampire Queen but I decided to be forgiving.",4,Luckily some redeeming qualities - HBO you are not filming a B grade drive in movie here!

1254725,AKJONKU5DALMF,B00280LZAE,"A.Marte ""Supernatural  Lover""","[2, 2]","I discovered my love of True Blood just a week before this season was released on DVD. While other opinions beg to differ; I think this season was the better of all three. The first season, while great, was just setting the viewer up for the world of the supernatural and Bon Temps. This season featured all the main characters, as well as introduce a few new ones, facing challenges of what happens when you open your eyes to the supernatural world. One of the main three storylines, Mariann's, could have been resolved a little quicker. The second storyline involving the Fellowship of the Sun was entertaining( mainly because of the Newlin's). The final storyline, involving Eric and his maker, was my favorite. I wish more time was spent on there and less on Mariann.One of the most amazing things about True Blood is that while it is shrouded in the supernatural a lot of the actions could be applied to the real world. I was entertained but I was also provoked to thought. Most of the acting was amazing but the choice of clothes for some of the main characters were off. The only complaint I really have is that some of the episode were far shorter then the hour(or 50-55 min) allotment. Although, he is not really a main character, Alexander Skargard was wonderful in this season. Eric's scenes with Lafayette, were my favorites; Eric's scenes with everyone else was awesome too. If you do not mind a little lag with the meanad story; this season is definitely worth checking out, because it does go a little downhill after this.",5,It got Better,1292284800,"12 14, 2010",2010,1537,"['discovered', 'love', 'True', 'Blood', 'just', 'week', 'season', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'other', 'opinions', 'beg', 'differ', 'think', 'season', 'was', 'better', 'three', 'first', 'season', 'great', 'was', 'just', 'setting', 'viewer', 'up', 'world', 'supernatural', 'Bon', 'Temps', 'season', 'featured', 'main', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'introduce', 'few', 'new', 'ones', 'facing', 'challenges', 'what', 'when', 'open', 'eyes', 'supernatural', 'world', 'One', 'main', 'three', 'storylines', 'Mariann', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'resolved', 'little', 'quicker', 'second', 'storyline', 'involving', 'Fellowship', 'Sun', 'was', 'entertaining', 'mainly', 'Newlin', 'final', 'storyline', 'involving', 'Eric', 'maker', 'was', 'favorite', 'wish', 'more', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'less', 'Mariann.One', 'most', 'amazing', 'things', 'True', 'Blood', 'shrouded', 'supernatural', 'lot', 'actions', 'could', 'be', 'applied', 'real', 'world', 'was', 'entertained', 'was', 'also', 'provoked', 'thought', 'Most', 'acting', 'was', 'amazing', 'choice', 'clothes', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'off', 'only', 'complaint', 'really', 'have', 'episode', 'were', 'far', 'shorter', 'then', 'hour', '50-55', 'min', 'allotment', 'not', 'really', 'main', 'character', 'Alexander', 'Skargard', 'was', 'wonderful', 'season', 'Eric', 'scenes', 'Lafayette', 'were', 'favorites', 'Eric', 'scenes', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'awesome', 'too', 'do', 'not', 'mind', 'little', 'lag', 'meanad', 'story', 'season', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'go', 'little', 'downhill']",True Blood: Season 2

I like the HBO series True Blood as well. Naturally, they have made some changes that we will like or not like in the TV series. For example, keeping Lafayette alive in the series although he dies early in the book series. I like it.In this second season, I'm really disappointed in the concentration on the maenad. I like the actress, and she is perfect for the part. However, this story is terribly over-emphasized, which detracts from the rest of the stories. I think it should have been shorter as it was in the book. It was gross. I count on Sookie books and TV to be mysteries that happen to be a little different, funny and sexy with a little vampire/werewolf lore. Guilty pleasures. The maenad story was tedious after a few episodes. I found myself longing for that story to be over. Of course, if I got to see an episode weekly, it might not seem as tedious or gross. I have to borrow the DVDs in the complete set and watch it all in a week before turning it back in to the library. :)Still, I'll be loyal to Sookie TV and books till the end. The characters are well drawn, and the actors are well cast. Everyone's acting is great except for Bill, who also has the worse attempt at a genteel Southern accent that I have heard. I have to give him credit for trying 1) to portray a complicated vampire, and 2) to attempt the 19th century Southern genteel accent.If I had my wish, there would be more emphasis on Sookie, Bill, Pam, Sam, Eric and maybe Alcide.

I read the books and really loved them, but to tell you the truth the show is completely different from the books, so I will not refer to them at all in this review. Instead, I want to talk about how weird this season was. It was just a little too weird for me.The second season starts out where the first season left off, and then spirals downward from there. In the first season, you meet MaryAnn when she bails Tara out from jail and then allows her to live in her home. But the truth about MaryAnn soon comes to the surface and it isn't very pleasant. It was just weird and I wasn't feeling it.I would still suggest that if you liked the first season, then you should most definitely buy this season, but I will warn you that it wasn't the best thing in the world. To be honest, the only reason why I am giving this review three stars is because of Jessica, the girl that Bill changes in the first season. Jessica took me by suprise in this season, with her beautifully long, red hair and intelligent, bule eyes. And then she speaks... She blew me into oblivion with her sexy, southern cadence. I fell in love with her immediately and my heart gave a little stutter every single time that she came onto screen.Other than that, it wasn't that great. But I have high hopes for the third season and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD. So, I can't really tell you to buy this book, but I would suggest that you buy this so that it makes the transition from season one to season three just a little less messy.

1254739,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B00280LZAE,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[3, 4]","Picking up events three weeks after the end of Season 1, the second season of True Blood opens with people trying to get back to normal life in Bon Temps, Louisiana, following the resolution of the serial killer problem. For the staff and regulars at Merlotte's this is complicated by the disappearance of their cook, Lafayette, under strange circumstances. Meanwhile, Jason Stackhouse has found religion and is being drawn into the orbit of the Fellowship of the Sun, an anti-vampire fundamentalist group, whilst Sookie and Bill's relationship continues to develop. The disappearance of Godric, the vampire sherrif of Texas, has Eric calling on Sookie and Bill's aid to help find him, meaning they are out of town when newcomer Maryann begins to have a very odd influence on the people of the town. Oh yes, and Bill also has a freshly-risen vampire protege, Jessica, to deal with.True Blood's second season hits the ground running with a number of complex storylines in progress or just getting underway. As a result the second season has less of an introductory feel than the first, and cuts to the chase much more quickly. There's less of Sookie changing her mind every five minutes about whether she wants to be with Bill or not and more focus on more dynamic storylines, which is what the series needed after the first season, which got bogged down a few times.The fact that Sookie and Bill are now together and that's pretty much it (despite a couple of curveballs sent towards the relationship late in the season) results in Anna Paquin raising her game notably. Whilst always decent in the role of Sookie, the character's frequent changes in attitude in Season 1 gave the impression of leaving her unsure about how to play the character. In Season 2 she is visibly more confident about the character and that comes through in a stronger, more interesting performance. Stephen Moyer also has an ability to relax and add a bit more humour to the character of Bill, which mostly comes out in his interactions with Jessica and Eric.Deborah Ann Woll first appeared at the end of Season 1 as Jessica, but she's a regular in Season 2 and delivers a great performance as the stroppy teenage vampire who isn't initially particularly happy about her lot, but then finds vampirism an excellent way to rebel against her strict Christian upbringing. Her interactions with Moyer and also with Jim Parrack as her love interest Hoyt are very well-written and performed.Alexander Skarsgard also gives an increasingly excellent performance as Eric. He hits impressive heights towards the end of the season when his carefully-cultivated sense of unflappable stoicism is shattered. We also get to see his life as a human in flashback, adding additional layers to his character.Most of the rest of the cast are great, particularly Michelle Forbes as Maryann, a seeming hedonist who just wants people to have a good time. The unveiling of her true motives is well-done and Forbes seems to have a ball playing a more overt villain than some of her other roles (such as the much greyer Admiral Caine in BSG).The season's structure works quite well, with Sookie and Bill's adventures in Texas, Jason's storyline at the nearby Fellowship of the Sun church and events back in Bon Temps unfolding in tandem, allowing the story to skip around to another location whenever one storyline starts running out of steam. However, whilst the Texas storyline is well-developed and resolved fairly quickly (in eight episodes), arguably the Fellowship storyline remains pretty predictable and its depiction as a bunch of fundamentalist whackjobs is too simplistic, given the moral complexities of the story explored elsewhere. Events in Bon Temps also unfold far more quickly than is necessary, meaning that the latter half of the season seems to be almost entirely taken up by disturbing magic-driven orgy rituals and Sam running around with various people chasing him, waiting for Sookie and Bill to get back from their storyline to help resolve things.Still, the show remains well-written and entertaining, and even if it does lack the depth of a lot of other HBO shows it is also a lot funnier (even if that humour is as black as midnight) than some of them. The final episode also does a good job of setting up Season 3, with the introduction of Evan Rachel Wood as the Vampire Queen of Louisiana (a great performance based on 1950s starlets) and several plot elements that look set to be more thoroughly explored next year.",4,A solid continuation of the series,1254182400,"09 29, 2009",2009,4498,"['Picking', 'up', 'events', 'three', 'weeks', 'end', 'Season', '1', 'second', 'season', 'True', 'Blood', 'people', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'normal', 'life', 'Bon', 'Temps', 'Louisiana', 'following', 'resolution', 'serial', 'killer', 'problem', 'staff', 'regulars', 'Merlotte', 'complicated', 'disappearance', 'cook', 'Lafayette', 'strange', 'circumstances', 'Meanwhile', 'Jason', 'Stackhouse', 'found', 'religion', 'being', 'drawn', 'orbit', 'Fellowship', 'Sun', 'anti-vampire', 'fundamentalist', 'group', 'whilst', 'Sookie', 'Bill', 'relationship', 'develop', 'disappearance', 'Godric', 'vampire', 'sherrif', 'Texas', 'Eric', 'calling', 'Sookie', 'Bill', 'aid', 'help', 'find', 'meaning', 'are', 'town', 'when', 'newcomer', 'Maryann', 'have', 'very', 'odd', 'influence', 'people', 'town', 'Oh', 'yes', 'Bill', 'also', 'freshly-risen', 'vampire', 'protege', 'Jessica', 'deal', 'with.True', 'Blood', 'second', 'season', 'ground', 'running', 'number', 'complex', 'storylines', 'progress', 'just', 'getting', 'underway', 'result', 'second', 'season', 'less', 'introductory', 'feel', 'first', 'cuts', 'chase', 'much', 'more', 'quickly', 'less', 'Sookie', 'changing', 'mind', 'five', 'minutes', 'be', 'Bill', 'not', 'more', 'focus', 'more', 'dynamic', 'storylines', 'what', 'series', 'needed', 'first', 'season', 'got', 'bogged', 'down', 'few', 'times.The', 'fact', 'Sookie', 'Bill', 'are', 'now', 'together', 'pretty', 'much', 'couple', 'curveballs', 'sent', 'relationship', 'late', 'season', 'results', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'raising', 'game', 'notably', 'Whilst', 'always', 'decent', 'role', 'Sookie', 'character', 'frequent', 'changes', 'attitude', 'Season', '1', 'gave', 'impression', 'leaving', 'unsure', 'how', 'play', 'character', 'Season', '2', 'visibly', 'more', 'confident', 'character', 'through', 'stronger', 'more', 'interesting', 'performance', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'also', 'ability', 'relax', 'add', 'bit', 'more', 'humour', 'character', 'Bill', 'mostly', 'out', 'interactions', 'Jessica', 'Eric.Deborah', 'Ann', 'Woll', 'first', 'appeared', 'end', 'Season', '1', 'Jessica', 'regular', 'Season', '2', 'delivers', 'great', 'performance', 'stroppy', 'teenage', 'vampire', 'who', ""n't"", 'initially', 'particularly', 'happy', 'lot', 'then', 'vampirism', 'excellent', 'way', 'rebel', 'strict', 'Christian', 'upbringing', 'interactions', 'Moyer', 'also', 'Jim', 'Parrack', 'love', 'interest', 'Hoyt', 'are', 'very', 'well-written', 'performed.Alexander', 'Skarsgard', 'also', 'increasingly', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Eric', 'impressive', 'heights', 'end', 'season', 'when', 'carefully-cultivated', 'sense', 'unflappable', 'stoicism', 'shattered', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'life', 'human', 'flashback', 'adding', 'additional', 'layers', 'character.Most', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'great', 'particularly', 'Michelle', 'Forbes', 'Maryann', 'seeming', 'hedonist', 'who', 'just', 'people', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'unveiling', 'true', 'motives', 'well-done', 'Forbes', 'have', 'ball', 'playing', 'more', 'overt', 'villain', 'other', 'roles', 'such', 'much', 'greyer', 'Admiral', 'Caine', 'BSG', '.The', 'season', 'structure', 'quite', 'well', 'Sookie', 'Bill', 'adventures', 'Texas', 'Jason', 'storyline', 'nearby', 'Fellowship', 'Sun', 'church', 'events', 'back', 'Bon', 'Temps', 'unfolding', 'tandem', 'allowing', 'story', 'skip', 'location', 'whenever', 'one', 'storyline', 'running', 'steam', 'However', 'whilst', 'Texas', 'storyline', 'well-developed', 'resolved', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'eight', 'episodes', 'arguably', 'Fellowship', 'storyline', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'depiction', 'bunch', 'fundamentalist', 'whackjobs', 'too', 'simplistic', 'given', 'moral', 'complexities', 'story', 'explored', 'elsewhere', 'Events', 'Bon', 'Temps', 'also', 'unfold', 'far', 'more', 'quickly', 'necessary', 'meaning', 'latter', 'half', 'season', 'be', 'almost', 'entirely', 'taken', 'up', 'disturbing', 'magic-driven', 'orgy', 'rituals', 'Sam', 'running', 'around', 'various', 'people', 'chasing', 'waiting', 'Sookie', 'Bill', 'get', 'back', 'storyline', 'help', 'resolve', 'things.Still', 'show', 'well-written', 'entertaining', 'even', 'lack', 'depth', 'lot', 'other', 'HBO', 'shows', 'also', 'lot', 'funnier', 'even', 'humour', 'as', 'black', 'midnight', 'final', 'episode', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'setting', 'up', 'Season', '3', 'introduction', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'Vampire', 'Queen', 'Louisiana', 'great', 'performance', 'based', '1950s', 'starlets', 'several', 'plot', 'elements', 'look', 'set', 'be', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'explored', 'next', 'year']",True Blood: Season 2

It felt padded, and as a result, characters were thrown into numerous repetitive scenes, going through the same actions over and over from episode to episode... It was numbingly slow-moving and redundant, and I'm pretty sure they could have told the whole Going-To-Dallas/Defeating-The-Evil-Maenad story arc in six episodes, then turned to something new, and made a much, much better TV series. Sure, there were some nice touches and clever moments, but the giddy pace and wicked sense of humor seen in the first season were all but obliterated by the monotony and repetitiveness of it all.

Look out ya'll.*As other reviewers have noted, Sookie and Bill's relationship takes a backseat and subplots take precedence in this season. To be perfectly honest, I was getting a little tired of Sookie and Bill's emotional roller coaster (on again, off again/are we together or not? Fight after fight ending with Sookie storming off...) and was happy to have a break from that for a while. Lafayette is actually my favorite character so I was glad to see more of him in this season. I was happy to see that the scenes with Bill and Sookie showed them getting closer as a couple and not fighting. I was beginning to wonder what they saw in each other besides each other's obvious physical attractiveness.I did find myself going, &#34;NO BILL DON'T DO THAT! IDIOT!&#34; and &#34;Jason! Seriously? No!&#34; I really like Bill and Jason but sometimes I think they are the stupidest people on the show. Jason makes wrong decisions because he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer and he's super selfish. It seems like Bill does not think, period. I get he's a vampire and some kind of primal thing takes over, but compared to the other vampires who actually kill all the time they seem to have more precision and self control over their choices. Bill just goes nuts at the worst possible times (over Sookie) and it makes no sense to me since he's simultaneously being portrayed as intelligent. Also, it's obvious that he has a lot he's hiding from Sookie even though she has told him time and time again to be open with her and she can handle it. After everything she's been through with Bill I find myself getting frustrated with him each time there's a new revelation about his past for Sookie to get upset about. I want them to stop having sex for about an hour or so and have a nice, long talk. Of course, that would make this show boring. Haha. I never get emotionally invested or frustrated with characters on a TV show, if that tells you anything.The sequences involving the Newlins and FOTS were boring for the most part. They could have cut half of it out (especially most of Jason and Luke's rivalry) and we could still have gotten the same message. Coming from the South and having spent the better part of my childhood around Bible-thumping bigots and ignorant people trying to use Christ's message as a way of furthering their own hate, I found some of it hard to watch. It brings back a lot of nasty memories. Sarah Newlin is extremely convincing and scarily similar to many pastor's wives and even Christian television personalities. While watching the DVD extras featuring the Newlin couple, I was fighting back waves of nausea and getting angry chills. (Since obviously we are meant to draw a parallel with FOTS and Westboro Baptist Church, etc which has been apparent since Season 1)Highlights of the season are Eric's haircut (He's more gorgeous than ever), Sarah's bathtub handijay, Sookie meeting Barry, Jessica meeting Hoyt's mother, Lorena's vermillion dress, Lafayette in a white chiffon gown, and Sam as a majestic white bull.Over and over again I am impressed with the Southern accents, especially from the non-American actors. Some of the actors have TERRIBLE Southern accents (Anna Paquin especially, she sounds like she has phlegm in her throat all the time, but especially when she's trying to put on a heavy drawl) but some are absolutely spot on. I lived in Alabama from birth until my early 20's, and I can hear a Southern accent and tell you exactly what part of the South the speaker is from. On this show, a lot of these accents are Texan or Georgian. Sometimes it sounds like a mix of several different regions which is weird. A few characters sometimes sound like they are straight from the bayou, but most do not. (I knew Rene was not really Creole from the first time I heard his voice, and knew he was probably a 'bad guy' of some kind because his accent was so bad) What a lot of people don't know is that what part of the South you are from changes your pronunciation, how many syllables words have, and even your sentence structure. For instance, words that end in an &#34;oh&#34; sound like borrow, can sound like &#34;barr-ee&#34; or &#34;bar-uh&#34;  depending on what area of the South someone is from. Depending on where you are from, you might be more apt to end your sentences with prepositions, use certain types of slang, and even determine which metaphors and swear words you use most. This probably isn't an issue for many watchers who are not from the South and don't know the difference, but to those of us who can tell it takes away from the magic sometimes.The end of every single episode is a cliffhanger, and not in a soap opera way. In a frustrated screaming into a throw pillow sort of way. I don't know how people who had to wait a whole week for a new episode made it through their daily lives. Seriously. This show gets under your skin and you feel compulsively that you NEED to know what happens next.Starting Season 3 tomorrow night!

Eddy III,"[0, 0]","While this show is filled with vampires, shape-shifters, werewolves, and several other magical creatures, the writers have done a fantastic job creating a realistic society in which these creatures have been proven real. The resultant curiosity, turmoil, and fear is colored by prejudice and preconceived hatred, which do seem to occur whenever a new group of different or special individuals is unearthed.However be warned that this show, in true HBO fashion, contains frequent sex scenes and violent/bloody images. This season especially has constant blood and gore, usually combined with the sex scenes. It IS about vampires afterall.I would highly recommend watching the first season first, as most of the plot twists and revelations about characters would make absolutely no sense to someone who has not seen the show before. The easiest way to not have you freaking out and/or scratching your head confusedly at this show is to watch all of the episodes in order.Despite almost constant gore and considerably-more-than-just-ra&#8203;cy sex scenes, I do suggest watching the series. It is not some Twilight-ensue happy fairytale land where everyone is fine with the existence of mythical creatures; this series is dark and really gives the viewer a lot to think about (once they get past the raunchy-ness). The characters are very real, and everyone seems to have their own motive and drive throughout the series. Even the characters that would usually be considered caricatures of people (or vampires) have a descriptive and usually disturbing past that slowly becomes unveiled during the series, making them more real and relatable with every episode.WARNING: DO NOT WATCH THIS SHOW UNLESS YOU CAN HANDLE LOTS OF GORE AND RAUNCHY SEX SCENES.

1254753,A3T5QAIGG2OK3,B00280LZAE,"C. A. Waters ""C.A. Waters""","[0, 0]","Season 1 introduced the main and recurring characters. Sookie Stackhouse and the rest of Bon Temps adjust to normalcy after vampirism is made public and a series of murders blankets the town atmosphere with distrust. With Season 2, the plot splits into several subplots that allows each of these characters to grow and blossom within the contemporary environment of Bon Temps that now not only includes vampires, shapeshifters, and telepaths, but also strange bacchanalian creatures, the aid of a vampire noble hierarchy, dead-male posturing between the vampires, Eric and Bill, and a new series of murders that are ritual and carnal. Shapeshifter, Sam, finds a new, possible love interest, and Tara snuggles up with Eggs while living with her new caretaker, Maryann. In the meanwhile, Jason Stackhouse believes he has found his true calling when he teams up with the Fellowship of the Sun to destroy vampires and vampire-lovers forever.I found this season slower to start than the first season, with the characters exhibiting much less passion than the first, as well. The tension between Sookie and Bill, as lovers, isn't as acutely felt as in the first season. Also, while holding to the HBO style of creating series for an adult audience, some of the group hedonism seemed ill-placed or more like a desperate attempt to make the series sexy than an honest plot thickener.

However, Evan Rachel Woods was perfectly styled and given great lines in this season.  I've never seen Season 1 but the relationship between Sookie and Bill seems to have run its course.  I thought their relationship was a commnt on those simple romances that happen especially in isolated not well-off places between an older guy and young girl on the cusp where the girl's greatest attractiveness is her youth and the contrast of her youth to her beau's dotage.  It happens frequently, people get married, women get widowed young and they think it's a happy ending IF they never leave their small part of the world.  If they ever do get tired of each other, then the girl is going to look back and think, ""Gak, that wasn't love at all but ....""  I wouldn't buy this series but would strongly recommend scanning it for Evan Rachel Wood's jewel box performance piece.  This show has a talent for the cliffhanger but I was fortunate enough to see all the episodes in one sitting on cable otherwise I would have been very frustrated waiting for the next installment.  The cliffhangers are outsized compared to what is actually delivered.  There was way too much of the bacchanalia storyline.  This season left you wanting more of the Swedish guy and Evan Rachel Wood.  I kept thinking that Eric Northman looks like Bill Pullman and then was delighted when Eric pulled(!) a Bill Pullman when he was trying to get out of the church.Another good moment is when Jessica Tuck's character spat out, ""Watch it, Viking.""  But I still recommend watching it, not buying it.My favorite scene in this season was Queen Sophie Anne playing Yahtzee (as opposed to Nahtzee) with Eric Northman sitting across from Ludis, a Latvian Boy when Sweden is just across the water from Latvia yet the coloring is so different and if Alexander Skarsgard has a Russian Jewish ancestor (hence his attraction to his progeny played by Kristen Bauer Von Stratten) and Yvetta from Estonia (played by Russian Natalya Alam who was born in the Ukraine where Swedes settled long ago) and to Sookie played by Anna Paquin who has the same nose as Alexander Skarsgard and in the book, the two characters Sookie and Eric has the exact same coloring while Sophie Anne sits across from a Mongolian Jewish looking Hadley (think Roseanne Barr and wiki pogroms and Siberia) and Sophie Anne explains that ""We play to 5 million"" when more than 6 million claimants to Israel were killed in concentration camps and Hadley says, ""She's way ahead.""  Whereby, Sophie Anne explains that Yahtzee (unlike Nahtzee) is totally egalitarian and everyone has an equal chance of winning even her social (Sweden versus France), physical (Mongolian raped Russian Jews) and intellectual (Ludis is no Einstein) inferiors.  I think everyone seated at that table was an actor with Jewish ancestry.

1254763,A1T17LMQABMBN5,B00280LZAE,CoffeeGurl,"[255, 278]","I have been a major Sookie Stackhouse fan for years.  I began reading Charlaine Harris's series, then called the Southern Vampire Mysteries, since before book four came out, and have read them all in order.  I was puzzled when I found out that HBO was going to make a TV adaptation of it.  Why this particular series?  Why not Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series?  (It would have been suitable, what with all of the sex and all.)  There were others as well, like Kelley Armstrong's Women of the Otherworld and MaryJanice Davidson's Queen Betsy series -- all of which have the erotic tones that HBO would have loved.  So why this book series?  Now I know why, but more on that later.I very much enjoyed season one.  It was very faithful to Dead Until Dark, except that small characters like Tara and Lafayette were expanded, and you get everyone's point of view, not just Sookie's.  Also, Bill has more depth here, and you see things from his point of view, and you understand him better.  Other storylines were added, like the emphasis on ""V"" addiction, which makes sense.  Season two has taken things to a whole other level and I love it so far.  I can't wait for the blu-ray release!  From the very beginning, the show has very sexually explicit scenes, most of which centered on Jason's exploits, and some violence as well, with a great deal of emphasis to vampire hatred as the new form of southern racism/segregation.  Season two takes things further, with gore and horror replacing the sex (there's still plenty of it though), and the fledging out of characters like Eric, Tara and Lafayette (whose death does not happen in the TV series).  MaryAnn is the mysterious creature that makes a brief appearance in Living Dead in Dallas, but is expanded on the TV version to the point that she almost takes over the entire show.  Jessica, Bill's ""daughter,"" puzzled me at first.  What's the purpose to this character?  But I like her now, especially after Hoyt becomes her love interest.  And I love the emphasis on vampire makers, like Lorena and Godric, the latter of whom moved me almost to tears in the last episode that he's in (plus, the actor who plays him is totally hot).  I don't want to ruin it for people who don't have HBO and have to wait for the DVD or blu-ray release, but, in spite of the departures from the books, it's better than season one.The actors are great.  Ann Paquin has grown on me as Sookie, British hottie Stephen Moyer is wonderful as Bill, and I finally like Alexander Skarsgard as everyone's favorite vampire bad boy Eric.  I am also enjoying Sam Trammel (Sam Merlotte), Rutina Wesley (Tara), Nelsan Ellis (Lafayette), Michelle Forbes (MaryAnn Forester) and Ryan Kwatten (Jason Stackhouse).  I am also enjoying the actors who play Andy Belleflour and Hoyt for the comic relief they supply.  (Andy is hilarious as the drunken out-of-work cop who witnesses the orgies and general odd behavior and no one believes him.)  All in all, if you're a big fan of the books, then you won't want to miss this show.  No boring moments throughout the hour-long series.  I cannot wait for season three and season two is not even over yet!  And I see why HBO decided to adapt this particular book series.  They must've seen the potential for character development and the southern setting on the small screen.

The relationship of Sookie and Bill develops, we get glimpses of the vampire world outside of Bon Temps, new characters such as Jessica are developed and old characters such as Tara and Sam are shown in a different light to the first series.Overall, this is an excellent drama/thriller/horror series which gives a tired format (i.e Vampires in a remote town) a new spin. There are a few mediocre episodes, however, when this series is good, it is good! It does feel like &#34;Buffy&#34; from time to time but True Blood feels like it is more for young adults and adults rather than teens. It will be very interesting to see what happens next series.

For example, the Maenad, who was but a small blip in the second Sookie Stackhouse novel, is turned into one of the best villianesses in TV history. Alan Ball has a knack for taking the small supporting characters in the novels and giving them complex, interesting, and intertwining storylines.

If you're a Charlaine Harris fan, beware, both seasons bare little or no resemblance to the Book series.  They trash the Characters, and remove any semblance of an actual plot/story line.I bought this and season one, sight unseen, which was a big mistake.  I recommend renting a copy or borrow one from a friend.  To determine if you actually like it, or buy a used copy as scratches can only enhance this trite idiocy.  All the stereotypes are here, in regard to southern white folk.  If you enjoy lame porn, you'll love this.  From Anna Pauquin's fake tits, to the town orgy, (oh yeah they went there) you'll really love this waste of an investment.  I bought it as a gift for a family member, they won't let me sell it off on e-bay. As it is a gift.The HBO people should have written their own lame storyline instead of trashing Charlaine Harris.  The script writers would make great senators or congressmen as they can't be bothered with actually reading either.  They certainly didn't read the book.  Queen Sophie is not only too tall, she is too old.  The characters do NOT match the book. No plot. A total absence of plot, yep totally gone.  Wall to wall brain farts. The best way to view this inane piece of work is through an alcohol induced trance.  Then it might actually look well done.  They took so many liberties with this, they should have created their own total mess, rather than hacking and butchering Charlaine Harris's work.Vampires would certainly not waste as much blood as they did for this photo shoot. There are other glaring errors as well, but too many to list here.  Oh and HBO dudes, three letters, CGI, an absolutely wonderful video concept used for special effects, check it out. Shaking the camera while someone is trying to dance poorly is not a special effect.  And lacks imagination.  Not to mention screwing up a Pagan Myth to the Nth degree.  They did get off on the totally black eye effect.  Ohhhh, Ahhhh A Hannibal Lectre rerun. Oh my.Gratuitous sex and violence, yep, don't get angry.  After all it is only HBO, So having no expectations is a must for entertainment viewing.  Just use the mantra...it's only HBO, it's only HBO...Never in my viewing history have I seen something done so damn bad. Actually I lie, I just remembered Captain Apache (1971) both are about as well done.Imagine a clueless idiot, looking at a Jackson Pollock and thinking...""Hey, I can improve on this..."", so he puts paintballs up his butt and farts them out on a canvas (actually I believe this being done), then he thinks this is soooo visionary.  It's about as imaginative and innovative as the nut who peed in a jar and put a cross in it.  Way to recycle bodily fluids dude.  And yep, another dummy bought it.So, we have ugly people having orgies, (I'm ugly so on the ugly front I know whereof I speak on ugly, never done the orgy thing so not so sure there but a definite yuck.), overdone redneck stereotypes, lame gags.  At least the first season did have a couple of decent laughs.  This series makes old porn movies, hey even new porn movies look positively genius.  As it was a gift I was obliged to sit and watch the whole insipid thing.  Of course given the other reviews here, I see some actually liked it.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is; there are 2-3 episodes on each disc (Regular DVD, not Bluray). Each DVD has a link for ""Features"" but these are NOT features.We would think that the last DVD would have the DVD extras such as deleted scenes and gag reels, etc. NO..There's only a somewhat boring fake newscast and infomercials from the Fellowship of the sun church and that's about it.There are so little extras given to the fans that it's like a slap in the face.Lets not dwell on the bad.The characters are acted as strong as ever and the story stayed right on target without straying and leaving holes making the watcher wonder, ""What ever happened to that one guy?"". Have you ever watched a show and said, ""But in 2 episodes ago, he did all this stuff that had no point! What was that all about?"". Yeah, me too.Although I'm not complaining, the series seems to find any chance they can to get people naked.

Sookie's brother tries to make his life mean something after everything he has experienced by joining the Fellowship of the Sun.  Hoyt tries to get to know Jessica more and starts to fall in love with her.  We find out that Eric's maker Godric is tried of living and just wants to die so Sookie stays with him until the very end.  As the season draws to a close the main charcters are trying to figure out how the bodies are being killed off, Sam has an idea but can't prove it.

It's not the best show on TV or anything, but it has a fun Vampire/supernatural story and is a nice change from 'Vampire Diaries' and anything related to 'Twilight'. It's got all the angst and eye-candy of your typical vampire series but fills it with believable characters, good special effects, fun ideas and MUCH better sex. This second season, while more plot-driven than the previous season is just as engaging as the first.Unlike first season of 'True Blood' which spent most of it's time introducing the setting and characters (as well as the supernatural mythology), this second season starts out with a bang (or at least a few dead bodies. New characters are introduced, there's more development into original character's past and the story runs along like a season of 'Heroes' (only better). Sex scenes are still a staple of the show and you're given at least one steamy scene (or more) per episode but the plot is never lost and is a lot more interesting this time around.The good-looking actors inhabit their 2.5 dimensional characters well, providing some great character/relationship development and eye-candy. There's layers to each character but it's explored more with a sense of fun than heavy drama. I think the only characters that I haven't warmed up to are the two leads: Sookie and Bill. The actors are great and the characters believable, but they're just not as interesting as Lafeyette, Sam, Tara or even Jason. Thankfully the supporting characters from the first season are given much more screen time and their roles more expanded.Like I said, 'True Blood' isn't a work of art and probably won't be remembered for any real significance (except maybe the sex and gore) but I think that's a good thing.

But the scriptwriting seems like it got addicted to extreme swearing, which halted the seriousness of the drama and made it sound like high school drama wrapped in ""adult drama"" packaging. Not only that, I guess what I was taught in college was true- sex sells. Though the first season had plenty of sex, not much of it had been graphic in any particular way (except for moments of women being topless and side views of male nudity). In this case, there's more, including, if you look closely enough in a couple episodes, graphic nudity on both sexes, they're just not focused on. Cultic mindsets, religious cult tricks, and other strange things are, though.Personally, I really could've enjoyed this show better if it didn't rely so much on extreme swearing and sex. Though I did appreciate how it put this ""anti-you"" bias in a lot of churches in a bad light, not simply acknowledging the existence of hate groups- but actually stating things about them, including false pastors using their power and public image, only to be ruined, on a personal level, in a public way.Since I don't like to review things I didn't finish, I'll go ahead and say my thoughts on the 3rd season here:FAR too much sex for the good of the story and way too much cussing to have it be enjoyable almost at all.

Harris' novels for some time and this show truly captures the quirky mystery of her supernatural world. However, for those purists our there, Alan Ball takes some liberties with the TV show, expanding some plots, changing/developing minor characters (Lafayette, Tara) but surprisingly the whole works excellently. I really love how Ball expands some of the characters and truly breathes life into them, making them as real to us fans of the novels as possible through the medium of TV. I pre-ordered the Blu-Ray season 2 and the audio/video is amazing, you can hear the crickets and frogs croaking in the background.

1254836,A3C1PJUQ3EU1SQ,B00280LZAE,"John Dandell ""McRussell""","[3, 5]","This season was a full-on roller-coaster ride with very little to criticize. Every character gets their own sub-plot, each uniquely enjoyable, reflecting positively on the show. Who would have thought that Hoight & Jessica would become breakout stars or that Jason would get even better?  Who would have imagined the girl from Fly Away Home doing sexy nude scenes 13 years later? Gone is the jarring hardcore sex and crime, replaced with fantasy but still *very* bloody theatric violence. The real character depth is there, but not where you'd expect. Humor is mostly provided by Jason's dialog and outrageous adventures. This is True Blood season one on fast forward.Its ironic, however, that I called this season True Blood on fast forward, since I found myself literally fast forwarding through the disgusting beginning title sequence every time to get to the meat of the show. It no longer fits the tone of that piece of art. I also felt like I was watching out of morbid curiosity to waste my own time. On an emotional and artistic level they lost the pacing & real life meaning which makes an HBO show a movie every week. It definitely knows its a TV show; but one lacking a purpose. Viewers need more. The character's emotions felt simulated, due to pacing, but nothing was wrong with the acting. They are all on fire. True Blood knows its still candy. They filled the bag up this halloween.One thing I'd like to say: You gotta amp the violence level up. Not in a ""just cause"" immoral way (When Erik rips the dude in half). It should push the art of horror FX itself. Make me see something impossible and subconsciously horrifying (Like when we first see the Maenad Bull in the woods). It failed to live up its visceral-carnal, art-horror, reputation of the first season. We just got more sex instead.Deduct two stars from something potentially perfect. It was very good. It went by so fast. People need more insight into real life, rather than just its reflections. Since season 2 True Blood was more of a wild cascade of events than an artsy emotional story with next generation level meaning & insight, I can't say I'm a better person for watching this. Its an okay show which glues me to the screen, puts me in childlike awe rarely, and makes me laugh a few times. I love Jason and all the character's adventures.

When Sookie's best friend Tara moves in with her enigmatic benefactor, something crowds out her good judgment and restraint.  But Sookie can't help, because she's tangled in undead politics in Dallas.  Nothing goes right in either plot, and tension accelerates relentlessly as everything builds to an apocalyptic confrontation.Again, we can politely call the adaptation from Charlaine Harris' second Sookie Stackhouse novel,Living Dead in Dallas, ""approximate.""  The producers take glaring liberties, yet considering the needs of the respective media, I can be forgiving: this would make a cluttered, overwrought novel, while Harris' exact story would appear immobile and talky on screen.  The performances, the lush design, and the elaborate soundtrack combine for an elaborate but satisfying spectacle.I can't say this lacks faults.  The ridiculous reliance on dream sequences becomes distracting and takes me out of the moment.  Some episodes peter out rather than ending on a tense clincher.  Though these shortcomings are the minority, they crop up often enough to make me sit back, slap my forehead, and wonder what the producers were thinking.  I wish the creative team kept a tighter hand on such diversions.But overall, I enjoyed this season.  Watching the DVDs, I had to remind myself to cook dinner and go to bed, because I'd rather go hungry and stay up watching.

I thought the Maryann plotline brought out the best in the actors playing Tara, Sam, Arlene, Terry, and especially Andy Belleflour, who was a riot this season. Lafayette didn't have his same flare this season, but still made me very happy that they didn't kill him off like in the books. The Fellowship of the Sun storyline was also compelling to watch, with Steve and Sara Newlin's religious zeal, and Ryan Kwantan (as Jason Stackhouse) proved he is so much more than a hot bod. As a reader of all of the books, I think they stuck to the book (Living Dead in Dallas) rather well even though they made the Maenad a much more prominent plotline, made Godric much more significant, and didn't kill off Lafayette. I actually didn't want to see Eric in hot pink spandex (don't think any self-respecting 1000+ year old Viking vamp would actually do this, even for Sookie). Trust me he rocks a tank top much better!I truly think the scene stealers of the show are the vamps...Eric, Pam (who's coming on as a regular this season), and Jessica. Notice I didn't say Bill! As much as I like Stephen Moyer the actor, his character is such a wet blanket during the entire season...petulant, insecure, scolding Sookie as much as he does his ward, 17-year-old Jessica, who continues to deliver excellent performances as the rebellious new vamp. Her storyline was sweet and tender! And finally for Eric, Alexander Skarsgard absolutely shown the brightest this season. Even my husband, who's never watched the show, could understand my err, lust. He doesn't play the character over the top, kind of sizzles and smolders just standing there on the outskirts looking in on Sookie and Bill's relationship, and slowly getting under Sookie's skin.

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[37, 47]","The first season of True Blood was about as much fun as a TV show could be and as a fan I was eager to jump into season two, especially after the cliff-hanging ending to season one.The first few episodes weren't too bad - they fit in well with what came previously. We see that a few humans have been kidnapped for various reasons and are being kept in a basement that was decorated right out of the darkest moments of ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"".But then the show pursued two equally inane storylines: the first involves the ""Fellowship of the Sun"", a fundamentalist bible-thumpin' Christian Church led by a group of big-haired, frozen-faced... I was going to say ""zombies"", but they're humans - just the worst kind of stereotypes - the husband/wife team heading the church is like a younger version of Jim and Tammy Faye.  Anyway, the Fellowship recruits Jason to become a warrior for Jesus while they have secretly kidnapped Godric, one of the more ancient and powerful vampires.  The second storyline revolves around Tara and her evolving relationship with Maryanne, a woman with mysterious supernatural powers. (I'm stifling the urge to add spoilers, even though I think the spoilers wouldn't dampen your enjoyment more than the already tepid script.)Season one was fun and sassy and sexy, with great characters: Bill the Southern Gentleman vampire, Sookie the telepathic waitress, Jason - Sookie's dim-witted brother, Tara the sassy on the outside - tender on the inside girl and Lafayette, Tara's exotically flamboyant gay short-order-cook cousin. Season two is dull and disjointed and often just plain stupid.  The series, initially designed around the characters of Sookie the Waitress and Bill the Vampire, demotes both of them to supporting characters in this disjointed mess of a season. I'll stick around for a few moments of season three to see if the show improves, but life is short, know what I mean?",3,A Giant Leap... backward,1254355200,"10 1, 2009",2009,1907,"['first', 'season', 'True', 'Blood', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'TV', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'fan', 'was', 'eager', 'jump', 'season', 'two', 'especially', 'cliff-hanging', 'ending', 'season', 'one.The', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'fit', 'well', 'what', 'came', 'previously', 'see', 'few', 'humans', 'have', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'various', 'reasons', 'are', 'being', 'kept', 'basement', 'was', 'decorated', 'right', 'darkest', 'moments', 'Saw', 'Hostel', '.But', 'then', 'show', 'pursued', 'two', 'equally', 'inane', 'storylines', 'first', 'Fellowship', 'Sun', 'fundamentalist', 'bible-thumpin', 'Christian', 'Church', 'led', 'group', 'big-haired', 'frozen-faced', 'was', 'going', 'say', 'zombies', ""'re"", 'humans', 'just', 'worst', 'kind', 'stereotypes', 'husband/wife', 'team', 'heading', 'church', 'younger', 'version', 'Jim', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'Anyway', 'Fellowship', 'Jason', 'become', 'warrior', 'Jesus', 'have', 'secretly', 'kidnapped', 'Godric', 'one', 'more', 'ancient', 'powerful', 'vampires', 'second', 'storyline', 'Tara', 'evolving', 'relationship', 'Maryanne', 'woman', 'mysterious', 'supernatural', 'powers', ""'m"", 'stifling', 'urge', 'add', 'spoilers', 'even', 'think', 'spoilers', 'would', ""n't"", 'dampen', 'enjoyment', 'more', 'already', 'tepid', 'script', 'Season', 'one', 'was', 'fun', 'sassy', 'sexy', 'great', 'characters', 'Bill', 'Southern', 'Gentleman', 'vampire', 'Sookie', 'telepathic', 'waitress', 'Jason', 'Sookie', 'dim-witted', 'brother', 'Tara', 'sassy', 'outside', 'tender', 'inside', 'girl', 'Lafayette', 'Tara', 'exotically', 'flamboyant', 'gay', 'short-order-cook', 'cousin', 'Season', 'two', 'dull', 'disjointed', 'often', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'series', 'initially', 'designed', 'characters', 'Sookie', 'Waitress', 'Bill', 'Vampire', 'supporting', 'characters', 'disjointed', 'mess', 'season', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'around', 'few', 'moments', 'season', 'three', 'see', 'show', 'life', 'short', 'know', 'what', 'mean']",True Blood: Season 2

I would give 4-1/2 stars if I could, but it's not quite at the 5-star level of Season 1.The show remains well-written, funny, atmospheric and full of amazing twists and turns.The cast continues to do a marvelous job. Ryan Kwanten, who plays dim bulb Jason Stackhouse, particularly stands out to me as an amazing actor. I don't know why the award-nominating people keep overlooking him. He gets to show off in a really enjoyable plot in which he is recruited by the vampire-hating Fellowship of the Sun Church in Dallas, joined by the equally wonderful Michael McMillan as Reverend Steve Newlin and Anna Camp as Steve's wife and ministry partner Sarah. If you've ever seen Christian media, you'll recognize Steve and Sarah Newlin. In another Dallas-focused plot, Sookie, Bill, Eric and Pam investigate the kidnapping of Area 9 vampire sheriff Godric, a story line that manages to be engrossing, thought-provoking and ultimately moving. Romance blossoms for Hoyt Fortenberry, much to his possessive mother's chagrin, and Sam hooks up with a girl who seems just right for him--but appearances can be deceiving.The reason I can't give Season 2 five stars is the Mary Ann plot back in Bon Temps, which I found to be silly and tasteless. I don't mind that the show is sexy and violent. I don't expect ""family viewing."" But I did get grossed out by the tedious, repetitive orgy/sacrifice scenes that neither advanced plot nor developed character.Still, I just love watching this show and can hardly wait for the Season 3 DVD set to come out.

I'm disabled and have limited use of my left hand at the moment, so pressing the center button and lifting the disc at the same time is a major challenge.

The weird dancing, mind control, and sacrifices were just over the top, even for a show of this nature.

This season introduces some new characters with new supernatural powers, and although much of the plot is way out there and kind of ridiculous, I enjoyed it immensely. By far, my favorite scene this season is when Bill goes shopping at Forever 21, but there are definitely many hilarious moments to choose from. Despite Eric's bad haircut, Bill's aversion to using contractions, and Sookie's annoying gap-toothed smirk, there's still a lot of great things about this show. For me, a lot of my amusement revolves around the bad acting (the chick who plays the vampire queen is hands-down the worst actress that has ever appeared on an HBO program).

Because of this intriguing premise, it allows the producers to insert a somewhat subtle message of tolerance for all creatures...living or dead.Frankly, I'm not a big fan of vampire stories, but this one has such interesting, multi-faceted characters and truly quirky storylines that I'm hooked.  Production values are first-rate.The most engrossing story arc this season deals with the religious cult that wants to destroy vampires.  These episodes are loaded with suspenseful moments and cliffhanger endings that make you want to immediately watch the following episode.  Unfortunately, this narrative thread is pretty much over by the start of Episode 9. [Hopefully, it will return next season.]  That leaves the Enchantress story to fill out the remainder of the season.Aside from the fact that she's one of the most beautiful women on working television today, I really enjoy watching Michelle Forbes in just about anything.  She's a fine, intelligent actress who, given the right role, could certainly become a major star.It is definitely no reflection on her talents that the final 3 episodes of this season seem stretched and repetitive.  That's the fault of the writers who failed to add another interesting element or two to the story mix.Personally, I think that zombies are a bore and having them dominate the final three episodes of this season was a mistake.On the other hand, the season does end with another terrific cliffhanger, even better than the one that concluded Season One.  So, even with its few missteps, this sophomore season is well worth adding to your collection. Michael B.

So when I no longer had access to my ""drug of choice"", I waited faithfully for the release of True Blood Season 2. When it was available, I rushed to devour the disks like a mad woman, and spent an entire weekend locked in my bedroom riveted.Bon Temps, Louisiana appears to be a hot bed for paranormal activity. There has been another death reported at Merlotte's (the voodoo priestess who gave Tara an exorcism is has been found with her heart removed), and everyone is a suspect, including those in the small Louisiana town who aren't exactly human. Bon Temps' citizens are not only human, but werewolves, shifters, demigods, vampires and other things that aren't to easy to label. Season 3 finds: Sookie still devoted to Bill (although there are times that I don't know why); Eric still brooding and sexy (yeah, I prefer bad boy Eric to Bill); Tara still looking for love (with her new hottie Eggs) and a place to belong; Maryann still shimmering and causing the town's folk to have orgies; Lafayette is still being held in Eric's basement unsure if he is lunch; Jason, still slow but sweet and looking for redemption, has joined a church who has raged war on Vampires; Sam Merlotte is still confused and pining for something he is sure he can never have; Godric, the Vampire Sheriff is being held captive by Church but finding a new lease on life that includes vampires and humans co-existing (he is now enlightened); Andy the town sheriff is drinking heavily, risking his reputation and career, looking for an explanation into the unusual deaths in his town; and Sweet, virginal Hoyt has found love in the newly turned vampire, Jessica.While Sookie travels to Texas to assist Eric and the vampires rescue Godric, Tara undergoes several changes as Maryann worms herself into her life. Between Sam's maker returning, meeting a fellow telepath, and fighting the Minister who is bent on a war against the Vamps, Sookie sets out to right all wrongs. As the storyline converges into a satisfying season conclusion, I realize that I will have to wait several months for season 3 to be released.

This is purely a review of the job HBO did on putting this on Blu-ray.I own enough Blu-rays to be familiar with loading times and quirky menus. (Anyone used to DVD simplicity is in for a shock when they try to play their first Blu-ray, but I digress.) This Blu-ray stinks, for one reason and one reason only: you cannot get to the menus to play the actual show episodes without sitting through a silly, painfully long animation of a bottle of True Blood slowing draining. And don't think you can simply fast forward, skip or hit the menu button, no siree, that will take you back to Go, do not collect $200, do not advance to the menus or episodes.

On the flipside of things, Tara (Rutina Wesley) gets drawn deeper into the web that the demonic Maryann (Michelle Forbes) who is continuing to spin her plot to trap Sam (Sam Trammell), Jason (Ryan Kwanten) joins the quasi-Christian-fascist organization known as the Order of Light, and Lafayette (Nelsan Ellis) finds himself in a very grave situation that he may not recover from.  Having never read any of Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse novels, I cannot account for how faithful True Blood is to the source material, but what I can say is that Alan Ball's adaptation is loads of addictive fun.  Between the smoldering chemistry between Paquin and Moyer, and no lack of genuine surprises (who knew a vamp could fly?) and dark laughs to boot(""teacup humans"" indeed, Eric is fine form throughout the season), the second season of True Blood is definitely the best thing to come along on HBO in a while.  If there's any drawbacks, it's that the season finale proves kind of anticlimactic, but it sets the stage for some major developments to come in the future.

1254902,A1QYOWY8H6MT16,B00280LZAE,Phoenix Child,"[4, 5]","""True Blood"" is a dark, hot, addictive new supernatural show that's a wonderful brew of romance, mystery, paranormal thriller, and Southern gothic style storytelling. While the world seems to be caught in something of a vampire craze in popular culture (""The Vampire Chronicles,"" ""The Vampire Diaries,"" ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer/Angel,"" ""Twilight,"" etc), ""True Blood"" takes a new spin on things by simply taking the supernatural and planting it in the most mundane environment imaginable: the Bible-belt, deep South town of Bon Temps, Louisiana.Featuring a host of engaging characters and fascinating plot strings tying together in unexpected ways, the first season mainly focused on Sookie Stackhouse, a telepathic waitress, and her developing love affair with Bill Compton, a vampire originally from Bon Temps returning to his home two centuries later. While it was apparent from the start that ""True Blood"" had strong potential and an addictive nature, the first few episodes were stumbling blocks of too much sex, inexplicable plot points, and meandering storylines. By the end of the season, however, the show had found a strong inner voice and a central plotline wrapped in a mystery that ended with a climactic finish and a hell of a cliffhanger.In its second season, ""True Blood"" continued on this path, featuring two key storylines that came together for a season finale of epic proportions. Featuring powerhouse acting performances, engaging plotlines, startling and promising new character development, and yet another season-ending cliffhanger sure to keep viewers raring back for more come season three, season two improved on the formula and added new elements that enriched the experience in exciting new ways. In discovering that a television series is different from a book series, the second season took a few steps further away from the novels the show is based on and became a stronger, more original creation because of that.Season two finds Sookie and Bill facing the growing complications of their relationship, even while Erik requires Bill and Sookie's presence in Dallas to search for his missing maker, Godric, a more than two thousand year old vampire. Tara and the rest of Bon Temps are caught up in the powerful spell of the mysterious Maryann, and Jason finds himself entangled in the honeyed poison benevolence of an anti-vampire Christian cult dubbed ""The Fellowship of the Sun."" The delicate intertwinings of each of these plotlines all combine together to form one tapestry that's even more wonderful than the first.While there will certainly be some fans of the original ""Southern Mysteries"" novels by Charlaine Harris that will disapprove of the changes made to the second season; each season of ""True Blood"" is based on one novel from the series, and in the second novel certain plotlines and certain characters grew to new importance while some were discarded or changed entirely. This gave the television show new depth, however, in making it something new rather than something already-seen; indeed, in some ways, the second season of the show improved on some aspects of the novel (""The Vampire Diaries"" has also taken this approach with marked success).Of course, the only thing that ""True Blood"" has done wrong is enforce the ridiculously long waits for the DVD releases, but perhaps that just makes the viewers more eager to buy the set when it comes out. It's also hopeful that there will be a new soundtrack release for the second season, as well as another score release by the fantastically talented composer Nathan Barr.Of one thing, however, it seems to be certain: HBO's newest hit isn't going away anytime soon, and while it may not have the eternal life of some of its characters, it seems safe to say that ""True Blood"" will be sinking its fangs into new life for many summers to come.",5,Even More Addicting Than the First Season,1269820800,"03 29, 2010",2010,3839,"['True', 'Blood', 'dark', 'hot', 'addictive', 'new', 'supernatural', 'show', 'wonderful', 'brew', 'romance', 'mystery', 'paranormal', 'thriller', 'Southern', 'gothic', 'style', 'storytelling', 'world', 'be', 'caught', 'something', 'vampire', 'craze', 'popular', 'culture', 'Vampire', 'Chronicles', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer/Angel', 'Twilight', 'etc', 'True', 'Blood', 'new', 'spin', 'things', 'simply', 'taking', 'supernatural', 'planting', 'most', 'mundane', 'environment', 'imaginable', 'Bible-belt', 'deep', 'South', 'town', 'Bon', 'Temps', 'Louisiana.Featuring', 'host', 'engaging', 'characters', 'fascinating', 'plot', 'strings', 'tying', 'together', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'first', 'season', 'mainly', 'focused', 'Sookie', 'Stackhouse', 'telepathic', 'waitress', 'developing', 'love', 'affair', 'Bill', 'Compton', 'vampire', 'originally', 'Bon', 'Temps', 'returning', 'home', 'two', 'centuries', 'later', 'was', 'apparent', 'start', 'True', 'Blood', 'had', 'strong', 'potential', 'addictive', 'nature', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'were', 'stumbling', 'blocks', 'too', 'much', 'sex', 'inexplicable', 'plot', 'points', 'meandering', 'storylines', 'end', 'season', 'however', 'show', 'had', 'found', 'strong', 'inner', 'voice', 'central', 'plotline', 'wrapped', 'mystery', 'ended', 'climactic', 'finish', 'hell', 'cliffhanger.In', 'second', 'season', 'True', 'Blood', 'continued', 'path', 'featuring', 'two', 'key', 'storylines', 'came', 'together', 'season', 'finale', 'epic', 'proportions', 'Featuring', 'acting', 'performances', 'engaging', 'plotlines', 'startling', 'promising', 'new', 'character', 'development', 'yet', 'season-ending', 'cliffhanger', 'sure', 'keep', 'viewers', 'raring', 'back', 'more', 'come', 'season', 'three', 'season', 'two', 'improved', 'formula', 'added', 'new', 'elements', 'enriched', 'experience', 'exciting', 'new', 'ways', 'discovering', 'television', 'series', 'different', 'book', 'series', 'second', 'season', 'took', 'few', 'steps', 'further', 'away', 'novels', 'show', 'based', 'became', 'stronger', 'more', 'original', 'creation', 'that.Season', 'two', 'finds', 'Sookie', 'Bill', 'facing', 'growing', 'complications', 'relationship', 'even', 'Erik', 'Bill', 'Sookie', 'presence', 'Dallas', 'search', 'missing', 'maker', 'Godric', 'more', 'two', 'thousand', 'year', 'old', 'vampire', 'Tara', 'rest', 'Bon', 'Temps', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'powerful', 'spell', 'mysterious', 'Maryann', 'Jason', 'entangled', 'honeyed', 'poison', 'benevolence', 'anti-vampire', 'Christian', 'cult', 'dubbed', 'Fellowship', 'Sun', 'delicate', 'intertwinings', 'plotlines', 'combine', 'together', 'form', 'one', 'tapestry', 'even', 'more', 'wonderful', 'first.While', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'fans', 'original', 'Southern', 'Mysteries', 'novels', 'Charlaine', 'Harris', 'will', 'disapprove', 'changes', 'made', 'second', 'season', 'season', 'True', 'Blood', 'based', 'one', 'novel', 'series', 'second', 'novel', 'certain', 'plotlines', 'certain', 'characters', 'grew', 'new', 'importance', 'were', 'discarded', 'changed', 'entirely', 'gave', 'television', 'show', 'new', 'depth', 'however', 'making', 'something', 'new', 'rather', 'something', 'already-seen', 'indeed', 'ways', 'second', 'season', 'show', 'improved', 'aspects', 'novel', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'also', 'taken', 'approach', 'marked', 'success', '.Of', 'course', 'only', 'thing', 'True', 'Blood', 'done', 'wrong', 'enforce', 'ridiculously', 'long', 'waits', 'DVD', 'releases', 'perhaps', 'just', 'viewers', 'more', 'eager', 'buy', 'set', 'when', 'out', 'also', 'hopeful', 'will', 'be', 'new', 'soundtrack', 'release', 'second', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'score', 'release', 'fantastically', 'talented', 'composer', 'Nathan', 'Barr.Of', 'one', 'thing', 'however', 'be', 'certain', 'HBO', 'newest', 'hit', ""n't"", 'going', 'away', 'anytime', 'soon', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'eternal', 'life', 'characters', 'safe', 'say', 'True', 'Blood', 'will', 'be', 'sinking', 'fangs', 'new', 'life', 'many', 'summers', 'come']",True Blood: Season 2

Powsky ""hello""","[0, 0]","I find it funny that I'm readingDefinitely Dead (Sookie Stackhouse, Book 6)and I'm noticing the same features that I like and loathe in the series. The main character is great. The mythology is compelling but the story meanders about and at times you wonder if the author simply forgot that there was supposed to be a mystery in the first place. I await judgment until I read the ending. In season one of this series, I felt like every episode was leading somewhere and when the mystery was resolved, I felt like I had just wasted 12 hours of my life. I had a similar feeling at the end ofDamages: The Complete First Season. If the show is based on a big reveal at the end, then that reveal better be compelling enough to justify all the subplots and navel gazing and gratuitous dorkiness that gets us there.What's nice about this season as opposed to the first season is the fact that we pretty much know where it's going by the third or fourth episode. Sure, there's a lot of back and forth between the Order of the Sun and the Bacchanalia so we're not sure which of these nasty types is going to make it until the last episode, but we know that these are the villains. And the mystery set up in the first episode (who cut out that woman's heart) is taken care of early on.From this point on, you can sit back and enjoy the show. The action is fun. The mysteries are compelling enough. Accept that both Jason and Tara are stupid and enjoy their plots, especially when Jason gets to buddy up to Sobotka fromThe Wire: The Complete Second Season.

We had already been introduced to the main characters, and Sookie was less temperamental in this one than she had been in the latter half of season 1. We see more of the vampires, and understand that there are compassionate elements of vampire society beyond the main character (something that was not shown in the first one), although they are hardly representative of the majority (at least as we see it). We also get to see more of the Fellowship of the Sun, thanks to Jason and his stupidity...these scenes were some of my favorites; from the lock-ins to the evangelical doublespeak, it was a delicious depiction of hypocrisy and hate -- seasoned with suicide bombing and weapons caches just for good measure. Ridiculous? Sure. Hilarious? Absolutely.The Maryann storyline, on the other hand, was really...boring... Seriously, how many creepy-eyed, possessed townsfolk orgies do we want to see? And, when we already know that she's the ""bad guy"", how many meaningless scenes do we have to witness to reinforce that point? This plot could have been wrapped up in a few episodes.All in all, though, I personally enjoyed this season more than the first, but rate it about the same...4/5 stars.

The writers should have left that crap in the back their minds. That was just bad and I got tired all that lame hippie dancing in every damn episode. I was so happy that Lafayette did get a little bit back to his old self again, I was really hoping the ""poor me"" syndrome wasn't going to go on for long.I like how they are fleshing Eric out more, he's becoming more of the Eric from the books. Good job on them for that one. And I will say now that his hair isn't in his face completely, the guy they got for Eric isn't as ugly as I once thought he was. He's slightly attractive, so I wouldn't mind seeing him kissing or screwing another guy/girl. Still don't like the bags under his eyes though.That brings me to another thing. I'm pissed, pissed, pissed that not  one GAY scene was in this series at ALL. Two seasons, not ONE. GAY. SCENE. what the hell!?!?!?!?!!?  I'm just like the Queen herself, I LOVE seeing two men together. If I've got to look at a bunch of uglyass straight ppl having sex, naked body parts everywhere, then I should be able to see some naked parts I actually WANT to see in just as many sex scenes. Eric is BISEXUAL, he LIKES men just as much as women. I really hope they stop throwing the homosexual words around in the show and actually start showing some freaking homosexuality!!! If OZ can do it, and Blood and Sand can do it and Queer as Folk can do it True Blood should be able to do it too.I love Pam, and Jessica is growing on me.

1254913,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00280LZAE,Robert Moore,"[3, 6]","In its second season TRUE BLOOD remained something of a phenomenon, one of the highest rated shows ever on HBO and widely discussed across the Internet by critics and fans.  As in Season Two, the show more or less followed the storylines laid down by the Sookie Stackhouse novels, but Alan Ball and his team of writers felt free to make significant alterations.  For instance, Season One ended with the impression that Lafayette, who does indeed die in the book, had been murdered.  Happily, Lafayette, who was a minor character in the books, lives to sin another day in the TV series.  And the maenad of the book, who was a minor though important character in the second novel, was elevated to the level of Season Two big bad.  Sookie's brother Jason, who is a moderately important character in the books, continued to function as a major character on the series (though in a more clothed state).In my opinion TRUE BLOOD might be the finest guilty pleasure show ever made.  The very best shows are characterized by the richness and multiplicity of their subtexts.  One of the marks of a guilty pleasure show is the relative absence of subtexts.  One of the reasons that academics have embraced shows like BUFFY and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA is the extraordinary number of themes and texts running through them.  BUFFY alone has produced a prodigious body of literature.  TRUE BLOOD possesses subtexts, but not many and none of much sophistication.  The show deals with prejudice, of course, with vampires and shape shifters standing in for any kind ofSeason Two focused primarily on two arcs, one dealing with the Fellowship of the Sun, a virulent anti-vampire church (pretty transparently a parody of anti-gay Christian activism, and the other with the appearance of the maenad, an immortal being who takes on the identity of Maryann (played by Michelle Forbes, one of the finest actors on TV whose work I normally love a lot, but who sort of irritated me here - her work as Admiral Cain on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA is one of the finest guest roles I've seen in recent years).  Intertwined with this are a host of other stories, such as Andy Lefleur's descent into alcoholism, Lafayette's torture for selling V and then his recruitment to do the very same thing, and the tough transition of Bill's ward Jessica to being a teenaged vampire.  And through all of this the entire town of Bon Temps, suffering under the spell of Maryann, engage in one bacchanal after another.There were a couple of nice Arkansas (my home state) connections in the season.  Several scenes were shot in a church, which was supposed to be the home congregation for the anti-vampire Fellowship of the Sun, involved in one of the season's major plotlines.  I wasn't familiar with the church, but I instantly recognized it as the work of Arkansas's foremost architect, Faye Jones.  He is widely celebrated as the architect for the famed Thorncrown Chapel in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, a building that routinely is named as among the most beautiful structures in the United States.  If you know Jones work, the church in TRUE BLOOD was instantly recognizable.  My brother's late father-in-law was an architect.  He was a student of Faye Jones at the University of Arkansas, where Jones founded the architecture department, against the recommendation of his employer Frank Lloyd Wright.  The second Arkansas tie in was Sam's being told by his foster father the whereabouts of someone Sam was looking for.  Where?  Magnolia, Arkansas.  What makes that interesting is that Magnolia is the small Arkansas town in which Charlaine Harris lives and where she created the world of Sookie Stackhouse.",5,Another fine season for one of TV's more entertaining shows,1254700800,"10 5, 2009",2009,3655,"['second', 'season', 'TRUE', 'BLOOD', 'remained', 'something', 'phenomenon', 'one', 'highest', 'rated', 'shows', 'ever', 'HBO', 'widely', 'discussed', 'Internet', 'critics', 'fans', 'Season', 'Two', 'show', 'more', 'less', 'followed', 'storylines', 'laid', 'down', 'Sookie', 'Stackhouse', 'novels', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'team', 'writers', 'felt', 'free', 'make', 'significant', 'alterations', 'instance', 'Season', 'One', 'ended', 'impression', 'Lafayette', 'who', 'indeed', 'die', 'book', 'had', 'been', 'murdered', 'Happily', 'Lafayette', 'who', 'was', 'minor', 'character', 'books', 'sin', 'day', 'TV', 'series', 'maenad', 'book', 'who', 'was', 'minor', 'important', 'character', 'second', 'novel', 'was', 'elevated', 'level', 'Season', 'Two', 'big', 'bad', 'Sookie', 'brother', 'Jason', 'who', 'moderately', 'important', 'character', 'books', 'continued', 'function', 'major', 'character', 'series', 'more', 'clothed', 'state', '.In', 'opinion', 'TRUE', 'BLOOD', 'might', 'be', 'finest', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'show', 'ever', 'made', 'very', 'best', 'shows', 'are', 'characterized', 'richness', 'multiplicity', 'subtexts', 'One', 'marks', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'show', 'relative', 'absence', 'subtexts', 'One', 'reasons', 'academics', 'have', 'embraced', 'shows', 'BUFFY', 'BATTLESTAR', 'GALACTICA', 'extraordinary', 'number', 'themes', 'texts', 'running', 'BUFFY', 'alone', 'produced', 'prodigious', 'body', 'literature', 'TRUE', 'BLOOD', 'possesses', 'subtexts', 'not', 'many', 'none', 'much', 'sophistication', 'show', 'prejudice', 'course', 'vampires', 'shape', 'shifters', 'standing', 'kind', 'ofSeason', 'Two', 'focused', 'primarily', 'two', 'arcs', 'one', 'dealing', 'Fellowship', 'Sun', 'virulent', 'anti-vampire', 'church', 'pretty', 'transparently', 'parody', 'anti-gay', 'Christian', 'activism', 'other', 'appearance', 'maenad', 'immortal', 'being', 'who', 'identity', 'Maryann', 'played', 'Michelle', 'Forbes', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'TV', 'work', 'normally', 'love', 'lot', 'who', 'sort', 'irritated', 'here', 'work', 'Admiral', 'Cain', 'BATTLESTAR', 'GALACTICA', 'one', 'finest', 'guest', 'roles', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'years', 'Intertwined', 'are', 'host', 'other', 'stories', 'such', 'Andy', 'Lefleur', 'descent', 'alcoholism', 'Lafayette', 'torture', 'selling', 'V', 'then', 'recruitment', 'do', 'very', 'same', 'thing', 'tough', 'transition', 'Bill', 'ward', 'Jessica', 'being', 'teenaged', 'vampire', 'entire', 'town', 'Bon', 'Temps', 'suffering', 'spell', 'Maryann', 'engage', 'one', 'bacchanal', 'another.There', 'were', 'couple', 'nice', 'Arkansas', 'home', 'state', 'connections', 'season', 'Several', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'church', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'home', 'congregation', 'anti-vampire', 'Fellowship', 'Sun', 'involved', 'one', 'season', 'major', 'plotlines', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'church', 'instantly', 'recognized', 'work', 'Arkansas', 'foremost', 'architect', 'Faye', 'Jones', 'widely', 'celebrated', 'architect', 'famed', 'Thorncrown', 'Chapel', 'Eureka', 'Springs', 'Arkansas', 'building', 'routinely', 'named', 'most', 'beautiful', 'structures', 'United', 'States', 'know', 'Jones', 'work', 'church', 'TRUE', 'BLOOD', 'was', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'brother', 'late', 'father-in-law', 'was', 'architect', 'was', 'student', 'Faye', 'Jones', 'University', 'Arkansas', 'where', 'Jones', 'founded', 'architecture', 'department', 'recommendation', 'employer', 'Frank', 'Lloyd', 'Wright', 'second', 'Arkansas', 'tie', 'was', 'Sam', 'being', 'told', 'foster', 'father', 'whereabouts', 'someone', 'Sam', 'was', 'looking', 'Where', 'Magnolia', 'Arkansas', 'What', 'interesting', 'Magnolia', 'small', 'Arkansas', 'town', 'Charlaine', 'Harris', 'where', 'created', 'world', 'Sookie', 'Stackhouse']",True Blood: Season 2

I agree with one of the previous posters that the series strayed too far from the main story arc involving Sookie, Bill, the other vampires and their political infighting, and instead invested too much time on subplots.One other criticism that I might add is that towards the end of the season the series started to suffer from tonal problems.  Normally, True Blood is a serious supernational drama with the ocassional touch of dark comedy.  However, the writers seemed to forget this and turned the dark comedy/social satire dials way up to maximum.

Instead, ""TB"" aims right for the guilty pleasure zones of the brain - blood and sex mixed up with camp humor - and hits them over and over and over.  And that rocks.Season 2 of this glorious series seems destined for a dark turn as it answers the cliffhanger from Season One's shocking use of painted toenails flopping out of the back seat of a car - whose corpse did those toes belong to?  We are somewhat relieved that the deceased is not who we think it might be, only to find out that this beloved character is being kept by the vampires as human cattle in the darkest, dankest dungeon in the South (and that's saying something).  But this little subplot - seemingly set up as the thread for all the action of this season - is quickly disposed of and the creators move on to juicier territory.The Southern Gothic town of Bon Temps is already home to vampires and shapeshifters, but soon will be invaded by even more sinister creatures, up to and including fundamentalist Christian warriors who promise a (profitable) war against the vampires.  But the darkest by far is the eerie presence of Maryann (Michelle Forbes) who rode into town as Tara's unexpected benefactor in Season One.  Forbes - who can give John Malkovich a run for his money in the game of Knowing Stares - is clearly not what she seems.  But nobody can predict where she ultimately takes our little village - but it is a sexy, dark, and disturbing road indeed.Our favorites from Season One are back once again - Bill and Sookie, Sam and Lafayette, Jason and Tara - but are surrounded by a large and enjoyable cast of characters that are rich with flaws and humor.  Season Two nearly careens off the rails on a few occasions, and at times Sookie seems to take a back seat in her very own show, but all in all ""TB"" remains one of the most enjoyable larks on TV.",5,One of the guiltiest pleasures on TV,1285718400,"09 29, 2010",2010,2122,"['great', 'TV', 'series', 'cable', 'channels', 'aspire', 'greatness', 'Wire', 'Mad', 'Men', 'Sopranos', 'being', 'chief', 'such', 'lesser-known', 'triumphs', 'Deadwood', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'also', 'hitting', 'high-water', 'mark', 'True', 'Blood', 'seemingly', 'such', 'aspirations', 'Instead', 'TB', 'aims', 'right', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'zones', 'brain', 'blood', 'sex', 'mixed', 'up', 'camp', 'humor', 'over', 'over', 'over', 'rocks.Season', '2', 'glorious', 'series', 'destined', 'dark', 'turn', 'cliffhanger', 'Season', 'One', 'shocking', 'use', 'painted', 'toenails', 'flopping', 'back', 'seat', 'car', 'corpse', 'did', 'toes', 'belong', 'are', 'somewhat', 'relieved', 'deceased', 'not', 'who', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'beloved', 'character', 'being', 'kept', 'vampires', 'human', 'cattle', 'darkest', 'dankest', 'dungeon', 'South', 'saying', 'something', 'little', 'subplot', 'seemingly', 'set', 'up', 'thread', 'action', 'season', 'quickly', 'disposed', 'creators', 'move', 'juicier', 'territory.The', 'Southern', 'Gothic', 'town', 'Bon', 'Temps', 'already', 'home', 'vampires', 'shapeshifters', 'soon', 'will', 'be', 'invaded', 'even', 'more', 'sinister', 'creatures', 'up', 'including', 'fundamentalist', 'Christian', 'warriors', 'who', 'promise', 'profitable', 'war', 'vampires', 'darkest', 'far', 'eerie', 'presence', 'Maryann', 'Michelle', 'Forbes', 'who', 'rode', 'town', 'Tara', 'unexpected', 'benefactor', 'Season', 'One', 'Forbes', 'who', 'can', 'give', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'run', 'money', 'game', 'Knowing', 'Stares', 'clearly', 'not', 'what', 'nobody', 'can', 'predict', 'where', 'ultimately', 'little', 'village', 'sexy', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'road', 'indeed.Our', 'favorites', 'Season', 'One', 'are', 'back', 'once', 'again', 'Bill', 'Sookie', 'Sam', 'Lafayette', 'Jason', 'Tara', 'are', 'surrounded', 'large', 'enjoyable', 'cast', 'characters', 'are', 'rich', 'flaws', 'humor', 'Season', 'Two', 'nearly', 'careens', 'rails', 'few', 'occasions', 'times', 'Sookie', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'very', 'own', 'show', 'TB', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'larks', 'TV']",True Blood: Season 2

1254928,AHCUFJHJAD6HP,B00280LZAE,S. McKinney,"[1, 1]","I really liked True Blood Season One, thinking that Alan Ball did a great job expanding on the books without losing Charlaine Harris's vision of Sookie, the people of Bon Temps, the vampires, etc. *were*. This season, in spite of feeling big love for the unexpected Jessica Hamby story arc. I really enjoyed the whole Steve and Sarah Newlin angle, and that crazy church camp atmosphere was creepy and funny in equal amounts.But oh my unholy bacchanalia, could the story line with MaryAnn have been drawn out more annoyingly? It's really annoying to watch a show based on the Sookie Stackhouse novels - because you'd think you'd be seeing a lot of Sookie, right? - only to find her starring role pre-empted by a maenad, a creature who played only the most minor of roles in the novels. I don't think that the television series has to be based chapter-for-chapter, episode-for-episode on the books, but there's only so much that can be done to ""improve"" on Charlaine Harris's work without the entire story (which includes all the characters) dis-integrating.MaryAnn's story line wasn't so much uninteresting to me as it was stupid and overplayed. Greek mythology considered, her persona as Kind and Caring Social Worker was unusual...I would have thought that a maenad would have been the complete opposite and way more up front in her desire to party hard and take the town with her. Tara is revealed to be one of the most gullible and inept characters on television, possibly only surpassed by that little boy named Timmy in the long-ago program ""Lassie"": he was the kid who kept falling into wells or wandering into burning barns with alarming frequency. Tara is just as bad, and in the space of one short season has gone from an edgy and high-strung character that I liked to one that makes me roll my eyes every time she wanders on screen to either yell at someone or gush all over ""Eggs.""With an HBO drama, you know it's going to be pretty forthright as far as language and sexuality go, and Season 2 of True Blood was no exception. I'm no prude, but seeing orgy scene after orgy scene was just grotesque. Listen, I don't want to see even young, fit people engaging in group sex, much less the droopy and middle-aged. But boy, you got to see it everywhere. Out on the lawn, sprawled across the booths in Merlotte's, just a bunch of groping, gasping, ugly group sex. It was too much, way too much. By the time MaryAnn was done away with, I was ready for all those nasty people of Bon Temps to go with her. Surely there's another little town near Shreveport where Sookie could have moved?By the last episode, I was ready for True Blood Season 3 to include the following things: 1) for Sookie to call ServPro (""Like It Never Even Happened"") to get her house back to normal, because you know her Gran is probably turning over in her grave; 2) for Lafayette to make enough money selling V to send Tara to some out-of-state university; 3) for Sookie and Eric to get something going on, already; and 4) for the Newlins to get their comeuppance.It remains to be seen if those things will happen.

Now the characters have been thoroughly introduced to us this series can explore them in more depth. Sookie seems less nave this time around, Bill is as chivalrous and protecting, Eric is just as conniving, Sam shows more heart and sensitivity and Tara has a bigger role than before. In this series Sookie has to help find a 2000 year old vampire who is captured by an anti-vampire church group, who her brother, Jason, also gets caught up with. Tara meets a mysterious woman called Maryann, who manages to influence the town in strange ways and make them behave in ways completely unlike anything they would normally do. And Sam starts to come to terms with his own unique gift. Of course there is more to this series than that brief synopsis would suggest but that is more than enough to whet your appetite. It seemed like there were less scenes of a sexual nature than the first series and this should please those who felt it detracted from the storyline and that it was too gratuitous. Personally it never offended me, but the storyline most definitely takes precedence over any titillation this time round. I feel this series shows great development in the characters lives and manages to move forward with the story of Vampires in America and in Bon temps specifically.

The problem with season 1 was that it tried to follow too closely to the actual written word, but the translation from page to screen is always hard to do successfully.  With Season Two, the True Blood cast took a well needed step apart from the written cannon and struck out on its own, while still remaining faithful to the spirit of the novel series.Season Two takes its time to step away from the main characters of Sookie and Bill and really starts to focus on the other cast members.  Deciding whether to bill Jason or Tara or Sookie as the lead would be a hard choice in this season if you were to judge on screen time alone.There are three main plots in Season Two: Sam's past and the true nature of Maryann Forrester; Jason and the Fellowship of the Sun Church; Eric and the disappearance of Godric (Sookie's trip to Dallas).  Minor subplots include Hoyt and his vampire girlfriend (the newly-turned-by-Bill, Jessica Hamby), Sam and Daphne's ""similarities"", Andy Bellefleur's fall from grace, Lafayette's ""business"" catching up with him, and Tara/""Eggs""/Lettie Mae (Mom) relationship issues.Where Season One had a bad habit of lagging along in the storyline, leaving quite a few ""ho-hum"" moments, Season Two maintains a fleet-footed pace and maintains it through the entire season.  You'll love having this season on DVD since you won't have to wait week-by-week for new episodes.  Needless to say, the cliffhanger at the end of the final episode will probably elicit a few choice words directed at HBO for taking a year in order to air new episodes.Having watched True Blood in it's native HD resolution as well as in non-HD, the Blu-Ray investment is worth every penny.  The HD quality truly allows the dank, bog-ridden feel of the swamp really shine through, and the music from the series adds a lot to the overall atmosphere.If you weren't able to watch True Blood live on HBO and were on the fence about buying this set, go for it!

No, we find Jason picking up with what he thinks is a great group, The Fellowship of the Sun, we see Sookie and Bill hooking into forever onyl to fall apart here and there, and we see the thing that Bill is given as punishment for his transgressions at Fangtasia - a baby vampire named Jessica. The main thing happening here is that a very, very ancient vampire disappears and the Fellowship is thought to be involved and Eric, owner of Fangtasia and Sheriff of Area 5, seems more than concerned.So, what sleeps in the shadows here?I'm not a reader of the books - I have never gotten into them thusfar - and that is probably my loss. Still, I don't have a conflict of book-to-show and, in many ways, that is great. I personally dislike the way a lot of things go into production and, honestly, I hate seeing something I really loved reading come to some horrible end. That disclaimer out of the way, I love the way the show is. It has become more bloody as the thing progresses (Season 3 - that's a really gorefest) and there is increasing nudity. It is definately not the thing of childhood - unless you like those nightmares coming through loud and clear.The acting in the show has become stable and the questions you have - they become louder. You have the one big one, that being Sookie and her power, and there is something that happens here and is promptly ignored that is somewhat bothersome. still, it is also interesting. Equally interesting is the thing about Sam, who really seems like a weird person until you know him in backstory. That's what i love about this show and what i equally fear - too many things on the back on the mind and, well, you are going to have something ugly happen. You can either have a few people with big secrets or a whole town with a secret (which seems to be a problem that starts to come out of the woodworks). Still, the acting makes up for all of this, with people showing you their range and their talents by going from one vocal style to something totally different.You can see them starting to wear their characters well.And I also love the way the things piece together and the way some things are predictable. Sookie seems like a trouble magnet, Jason is trouble with a capital S-E-X, Tara has her mam drama as well as her demons, Sam is hopelessly lost in Sookie, Bill is a man that has secrets layered in secrets, Eric is a great character that will be explore dmore this season, and so on.yo realyl have to love it.to me, this is the Dark Shadows of a new generation, taking the vampire and putting it on a new stage.

I must say that I was slightly disappointed with how this season turned out. First of all, it dragged way too much. I think it started and ended with a bang, but most of the middle episodes really fell flat. It was characteristic of this season to build up and up to an exciting idea....and then be let down when it either doesn't happen or happens in an anti-climactic way.I agree with someone else who said this show came close to ""jumping the shark"" in some things. It seemed as though they were trying to stuff too many different ""supernatural"" creatures or aspects into it, forgetting not only the vampire base but the characterization as well. Without giving TOO much away, the fact they had Maryann in the whole season was a mistake. It seemed to me that she was made out to be this almost all=powerful immortal, goddess like creature. But in the last episode it seems as though she is killed rather easily, with an easy-to-figure-out trick.The best thing that did come out of this season however, was more Eric. The viewers see more of Eric (both character and body!) and he becomes more ""human"" if you can forgive the pun. I found the second half of the last episode very intrigiung as well.

1254953,A3I4XJW0NJROQ2,B00280LZAE,w.s.,"[0, 0]","In season two of True Blood, the writers moved the audience more away from the insulated world of Bon Temps out toward Dallas, Texas, where much of the major storyline came to a head. We were introduced to the Newlins, a fanatical Christian couple who were Pastor and First Lady of the Fellowship of the Sun Church, a vampire-hating organization equal parts parody and realism. Then, back in Bon Temps, we learn more about Tara's benefactor Maryann and the mysterious spell she begins to cast on the town that causes all Hell to break loose.Season one was kind of quiet and earthy. Like many shows, they upped the ante in season two. Much of this was due to the havoc Maryann was causing. I happened to find Michelle Forbes to be absolute gold in this role. I hated her but at the same time I was fascinated with her and secretly loved her. Forbes' powerful charisma and presence made it easy to why she had such a hold over almost everyone (besides her supernatural abilities). Her relationship with Tara provided some of the most interesting tension. As the viewer, I knew she was poison for Tara but I could also see how her feigned but very believable maternal energy pulled the wool over Tara's eyes, who'd never had a positive mother figure before. Wesley's Tara mellows a bit this season, compared to the spitfire of season one, but her dramatic abilities are more evident than ever, especially in her complicated relationship with Eggs (Mehcad Brooks, as talented as he is good looking).The Dallas storyline was bolstered by the newly introduced characters. Michael McMillan and Anna Camp are brilliant as the Newlins as well as Wes Brown who plays Luke, the Bible-thumping fanatic who becomes Jason's nemesis. Bill's maker Lorena (Mariana Klaveno) comes into the picture. She's spot-on, playing this evil, bloodthirsty creature who becomes completely sympathetic due to her desperate and unrequited love for Bill. But, the character who has the most impact is Godric (Allan Hyde). He's Eric's maker, a 2000 year old vampire who becomes repentant for all of his past sins. Hyde gives an amazing performance, one that's spellbinding due to the paradox between his youthful appearance and stature and his powerful aura of wisdom and inner strength. He also gives Eric some of his best scenes to play ever and a chance for us to see past the Viking's icy shell. No matter how many times I've seen it, the scene on the roof with Godric, Eric, and Sookie still makes me cry.All of the other actors, such as Paquin, Moyer, Kwanten, and Ellis, are fantastic as usual. The introduction of Jessica makes for a nice teenage love affair with Hoyt, the Mama's Boy of season one who's now starting to find his manhood and self-confidence. Jessica also matures from a petulant brat into a young woman with many inner conflicts and desires and yearnings.Season two is not as great as season one, but it's a very close runner up. The fleshing out of the many characters and the introduction of some solid storylines makes up for a few of the missteps along the way (I could've done without the Frenzier overload).",5,Very Solid Season,1309305600,"06 29, 2011",2011,3105,"['season', 'two', 'True', 'Blood', 'writers', 'moved', 'audience', 'more', 'away', 'insulated', 'world', 'Bon', 'Temps', 'out', 'Dallas', 'Texas', 'where', 'much', 'major', 'storyline', 'came', 'head', 'were', 'introduced', 'Newlins', 'fanatical', 'Christian', 'couple', 'who', 'were', 'Pastor', 'First', 'Lady', 'Fellowship', 'Sun', 'Church', 'vampire-hating', 'organization', 'equal', 'parts', 'parody', 'realism', 'Then', 'back', 'Bon', 'Temps', 'learn', 'more', 'Tara', 'benefactor', 'Maryann', 'mysterious', 'spell', 'cast', 'town', 'Hell', 'break', 'loose.Season', 'one', 'was', 'kind', 'quiet', 'earthy', 'many', 'shows', 'upped', 'ante', 'season', 'two', 'Much', 'was', 'due', 'havoc', 'Maryann', 'was', 'causing', 'happened', 'find', 'Michelle', 'Forbes', 'be', 'absolute', 'gold', 'role', 'hated', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'fascinated', 'secretly', 'loved', 'Forbes', 'powerful', 'charisma', 'presence', 'made', 'easy', 'why', 'had', 'hold', 'almost', 'everyone', 'supernatural', 'abilities', 'relationship', 'Tara', 'provided', 'most', 'interesting', 'tension', 'viewer', 'knew', 'was', 'poison', 'Tara', 'could', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'feigned', 'very', 'believable', 'maternal', 'energy', 'pulled', 'wool', 'Tara', 'eyes', 'who', ""'d"", 'never', 'had', 'positive', 'mother', 'figure', 'Wesley', 'Tara', 'bit', 'season', 'compared', 'spitfire', 'season', 'one', 'dramatic', 'abilities', 'are', 'more', 'evident', 'ever', 'especially', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'Eggs', 'Mehcad', 'Brooks', 'as', 'talented', 'good', 'looking', '.The', 'Dallas', 'storyline', 'was', 'bolstered', 'newly', 'introduced', 'characters', 'Michael', 'McMillan', 'Anna', 'Camp', 'are', 'brilliant', 'Newlins', 'as', 'well', 'Wes', 'Brown', 'who', 'Luke', 'Bible-thumping', 'fanatic', 'who', 'Jason', 'nemesis', 'Bill', 'maker', 'Lorena', 'Mariana', 'Klaveno', 'picture', 'spot-on', 'playing', 'evil', 'bloodthirsty', 'creature', 'who', 'completely', 'sympathetic', 'due', 'desperate', 'unrequited', 'love', 'Bill', 'character', 'who', 'most', 'impact', 'Godric', 'Allan', 'Hyde', 'Eric', 'maker', '2000', 'year', 'old', 'vampire', 'who', 'repentant', 'past', 'sins', 'Hyde', 'amazing', 'performance', 'one', 'spellbinding', 'due', 'paradox', 'youthful', 'appearance', 'stature', 'powerful', 'aura', 'wisdom', 'inner', 'strength', 'also', 'Eric', 'best', 'scenes', 'play', 'ever', 'chance', 'see', 'Viking', 'icy', 'shell', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'scene', 'roof', 'Godric', 'Eric', 'Sookie', 'still', 'cry.All', 'other', 'actors', 'such', 'Paquin', 'Moyer', 'Kwanten', 'Ellis', 'are', 'fantastic', 'usual', 'introduction', 'Jessica', 'nice', 'teenage', 'love', 'affair', 'Hoyt', 'Mama', 'Boy', 'season', 'one', 'who', 'now', 'starting', 'find', 'manhood', 'self-confidence', 'Jessica', 'also', 'petulant', 'brat', 'young', 'woman', 'many', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'desires', 'yearnings.Season', 'two', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'season', 'one', 'very', 'close', 'runner', 'up', 'fleshing', 'many', 'characters', 'introduction', 'solid', 'storylines', 'up', 'few', 'missteps', 'way', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'Frenzier', 'overload']",True Blood: Season 2
