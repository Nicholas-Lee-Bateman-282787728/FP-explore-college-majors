I have to disagree with that, though. Monster From Bikini Beach is one hundred trillion times better than Jaws! Not only does it have the best acting I've seen in a movie since Piranha 3DD, it also has the best special effects I've seen since Troll 2. Yes, it is that good. So come on and buy the movie that Roger Ebert gave four stars and called ""The best bikini movie since Bikini Bloodbath Carwash"".

Bad acting, no special effects, unattractive women, very cheesy monster, bad cinemetography, and looked like it was filmed by some kids studying to be movie makers. The main star is an old fart (65 plus), and a totally unlikeable character who has a 18 year old girlfriend (Yeah right), and investigates the murders, who all have what it seems like intestines hanging out of their bodies, sfter being mutilated by the monsters.I thought I seen the worst movie (Bad taste - Peter Jackson), but this film wins hands down. Nothing enjoyable, interesting or entertaining about this movie.The two people who reviewed this movie must have been smoking something good, and I don't think that would even do it. Sorry I bought this movie based on the reviews. I'll definitely watch a movie next time before I buy it. Even the main girl actor (reporter) has acne, and her partner is a total geek. Where did they find these actors? In a trailer park?

1605493,AKL7DGU8UVXTC,B00A3TFK58,Joe C. McPherson,"[0, 0]","This movie does exactly what it needs to for the intended audience-it entertains. The acting is intentionally horrible and the plot is also bad, but this movie is just fun to watch because it panders to these bad qualities and ironically makes it a good b-movie in the process. I chose four stars because the intentional retro feel of the movie and its deliberate bad acting make the movie more fun in its entire essence. TFO, otherwise known as Trash Film Orgy, is the production company and their deliberate effort to make notable b-movie fare has not gone unnoticed. Even the intentionally bad sets and the monster itself give this film a feel for sixties nostalgia.

The description on the reverse of the DVD leads one to believe the film contains outtakes from older films. That is not the case. The coastal town of Camaroville is plagued by a campy sea monster who does Troma style killings and has an insatiable appetite for bra tops. The cast includes a detective who works for the mob and a newswoman with skin issues who needs to shower. About halfway through the film a Randy Quaid type noodler is introduced. He says about his craft, ""Some call it foolish, others call it plain stupid."" His niece is a combination of country goof and rocket scientist.The film is low budget and campy. What makes a film such as this enjoyable outside of the topless women is the dialogue.
