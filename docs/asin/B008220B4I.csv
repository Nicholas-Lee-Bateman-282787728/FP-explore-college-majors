However when you do finish watching this film you are pleasantly surprised.......Loosely based on the Thomas Hardy novel, Tess of the D'Urbervilles"" , Winterbottom changes the location from Wales England to Rajasthan India however fundamentally the scenarios also change, it readers remember the original story was based in rural Wessex while the present day movie adaptation changes to a rural Rajasthan which is furiously changing with the advancing forces of globalization.Basically this is a film about a romance that one senses will end in doom but still offers some hope at times. Riaz Ahmed is the son of Roshan Seth, a rich hotelier who owns a number of hotels. He comes to Rajasthan to help manage one of the properties and ends with getting besotted by a low ranking employee played by Freida Pinto ( Trishna)  She is the eldest of a poor family and has to help support her father in keeping her family afloat..There is mutual romance because Riaz helps Trishna a lot. They move to Mumbai where the lovebirds get to know each other and love. However Jai is called to England to take care of his ailing dad. He returns but Trishna no longer is the same for him. He increasingly becomes humiliating and abusive and the story ends in tragedy.The young actors Riaz Ahmed and Freida Pinto are amazing. Pinto with her silences and painful gaze nails the essence of Trishna I thought that the end of the film was weak because although because insufficient  explanation was given for the arc. The union of these lovers could have been so much more but yet ends in sadness.

Barten,"[1, 4]","I don't know much about India, but I consider exotic films with native speakers of languages I do not know an acceptable part of the intellectual tradition that creates suspense with semantic aphasia. Many of the plot devices involving the fathers in this film illustrate masculine failures of the Phallic Function, and the idea that the woman has ""all three"" characters is a mathematical failure to be defined that is considered a feminine failure of Phallic Function expectations. The many changes in life that take place in the film is typical of the way we don't get obscure general significance that escapes in the usual understanding of semantic aphasia. Sacrifice as a means of purification might have been the main message of Thomas Hardy in his novel faithfully reporting what he understood of the problems of Tess.I enjoyed the music and dancing of the film Trishna, but it is difficult for me to imagine that the electrification of India will produce other aspects of Asia that I will enjoy. As a consumer of cultural stitches and twitches, I did not consider Trishna as trivial as a woman I walked out on earlier in the day that I saw the movie in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where people think I am crazy.

1542045,A328S9RN3U5M68,B008220B4I,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","To claim that TRISHNA is an adaptation of Thomas Hardy's `Tess of the D'Urbervilles' is really stretching the imagination. This is an engrossing film about caste differences in India: the screenwriters are not mentioned - only the fact that director Michael Winterbottom based his story on Hardy's famous novel seems to be more of a PR draw than reality. But the film is well acted and the aromas and atmospheres of India are well captured.TRISHNA reveals the life of one woman whose life is destroyed by a combination of love and circumstances. Set in contemporary Rajasthan, Trishna (Freida Pinto, beautiful and sensitive) meets a wealthy young British businessman Jay Singh (Riz Ahmed, inordinately handsome and polished) who has come to India to work in his father's hotel business. After an accident destroys her father's Jeep, Trishna goes to work for Jay, and they fall in love. But despite their feelings for each other, they cannot escape the conflicting pressures of a rural society which is changing rapidly through industrialization, urbanization and, above all, education. Trishna's tragedy is that she is torn between the traditions of her family life and the dreams and ambitions that her education has given her: the sexual double standard to which Tess falls victim despite being a truly good woman makes her despised by society after losing her virginity before marriage. Trishna has choices after she receives an education, but she instead chooses to follow her passion for Jay.  Jay truly loves Trishna but his social class demands that he keep Trishna as an employee, making his physical love affair with her a private matter due to the rules of the caste system.  Jay does not seem to be a villain here and Trishna is not a victim: these two facts make the ending a bit over the top and unnecessary. A more intelligent script could have made this a first class film.Freida Pinto and Riz Ahmed are fascinating to observe as they work through the confines of love in a world that does not condone their union. The other characters in the cast are excellent - especially Roshan Seth as Jay's father. In setting the story in contemporary India the director seems to have decided it was important to include cellphones and Bollywood dancing rehearsals and filmmaking to provide spice.  But in the end it is the fine acting by Pinto and Ahmed that make this film work.

Lane ""professional audience member""","[6, 9]","Based on Thomas Hardy's classic tragedy, Tess of the d'Urbervilles, this beautifully presented Bollywood version is surprisingly seamy and steamy (most Bollywood movies scarcely have a kiss), but the lovely Freida Pinto is perfect as our titular heroine. Our 2012 Seattle International Film Festival screening audience was very quiet as this ended; most of us knew the book, so we weren't surprised. We appreciated the R-rated updates: abortion, cell phones and jets, and suffered with Trishna, as her degradation and humiliation escalated at the hands of that handsome scoundrel.Let's look at some of the multilingual cast (English and Hindi, with English captions):* Freida Pinto (""Slumdog Millionaire"") is Trishna, who has managed to get some education despite her poverty, but it only serves to make her a misfit in her old village and with her family. Ultimately she has nowhere to turn.* Riz Ahmed (""Centurion"") is Jay, the son of a wealthy hotelier. He has no drive and no ambition, other than to work his way through the Kama Sutra. As his boredom grows, he demeans Trishna more and more.* Roshan Seth (""Amal"") is Jay's blind father, disappointed in his son but dependent on him to run the hotel, just the same.The dusty chaos that is India still mesmerizes, but this film could have been at least fifteen minutes shorter. Our heroine toils in the fields, in a factory, in a kitchen and in a hotel, and while those things are interesting, the lingering photography ultimately begins to wear.

I like well made foreign films (Sawariya, 200 Pound Beauty, A Very Long Engagement) so I thought I would give this a try.Film is garbage.The first 55 minutes seems to be setting the stage for the rest of the movie, but then the majority o that stuff doesn't have much influence on later sequences. The editing seemed slow and at times was cutting to new scenes in the story timeline, that looked just like the past scenes. Example, cuts of the two lovers in each others arms in the bed, or cuts of her at work over the course of days... it was like they were trying to create time by recycling footage instead of shooting new footage or at least using a different camera angle.Some of the dialogue seemed sloppily improvised too like when he's talking with his father or when his friends (who seem to add nothing to the story) bid him adieu.Too many little themes going on that never get finished. The only consistent theme is that this chick is playing the harlot, knowing that she's doing wrong, but stays in that situation instead of just running away like she keeps doing.This film is probably good for unmarried young men who are overly eager to lose their virginity.

1542053,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B008220B4I,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","I checked this DVD out from the library because I had seen it described as a take on Thomas Hardy's ""Tess of the D'urbeyvilles"". My interest heightened when I saw that Freida Pinto of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" fame plays the lead character. I settled in to watch this today and my reactions are mixed. This very loose adaptation of Hardy's source material, directed by Michael Winterbottom, has its moments but ultimately falls short of being brilliant. The cinematography is gorgeous and the soundtrack is achingly beautiful, but the story itself seems to have several drawbacks in the telling.Pinto plays Trishna, a girl from rural Rajasthan who comes from a poor background, though not as desperate as many others in that part of the world. A chance meeting with Jay Singh (Riaz Ahmed), British-educated son of a wealthy hotelier, sets her on the path to damnation and ruin. Jay becomes obsessed with the lovely and innocent Trishna, and when tragedy strikes Trishna's family, he conveniently slips into the role of knight in shining armor, and helps her get a job at one of his father's hotels in Jaipur. At first, Trishna is humbled by Jay's affectionate gestures but like Tess, finds herself a fallen woman. She returns to her family home in disgrace but Jay tracks her down and takes her to Mumbai where the pair live together as lovers.The story is one of emotional dependence and its destructive effects. Trishna, the beautiful and naive village girl, views Jay's interest in her with a level of awe and incredulity. After all, this is a sophisticated man of the world. She succumbs to his passionate attentions, and in the process loses her own self-identity. The destruction of Trishna's sense of self is depicted over the course of the movie and picks up in intensity to the point where Trishna, having lost all sense of self-decency, finally recognizes the destructive and degrading nature of her relationship with Jay, and reaches a point of no return, with terrible consequences.I thought the lead characters did a credible job in their respective roles. Pinto shines in the way she conveys her emotions, though I admit I got rather annoyed at her constant acquiescence to Jay's demands. Her character development is stunted which is probably what the director intended to portray, but it was hard to swallow, if only because she gets offered opportunities along the way to escape her predicament, yet plays the victim for most of the film. However, if one takes into account that Trishna is after all a naive village girl, the way her character is depicted and the events that transpire make more sense. Trishna's fluency in English was a little bit jarring considering the background she was from, so this was another element that I felt detracted from the credibility of the story.Pinto is unabashed in the sex scenes and there are quite a few in this film. It is quite racy by Bollywood standards and I hope it proves to be a career positive rather than a negative. The actor that plays Jay delivers a compelling performance as the manipulative jerk, and I hope to see more of this young actor in other film roles.
