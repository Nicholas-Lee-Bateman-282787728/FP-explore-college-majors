818796,A3E2AB97PKT0Y8,B0001ZWLVA,Dr J,"[39, 47]","I have mixed feelings about this DVD on the American Revolution.  On the positive side, the use of reenactors was good. Generally, PBS does uses reenactors much less than A&E; (and its sister companies)and Discovery.  This DVD was quite refreshing in that respect. I also very much enjoyed certain characters talking to the audience.  I like this technique in historical documentaries.  It cuts up the monotony of listening to a narrator and makes history come alive.  Great job here.  However, the battle scenes were small--only a handful of reenactors showed up on filming day, so we see the same few guys again and again. Also, the use of guys with beards seemed odd. Nevertheless, you work with what you have.As far as the presentation goes, the narrator is the star of the show.  He is on screen way too much.  It's 'interesting and valuable to see how some of the old sites, e.g. Breed's/Bunker Hills, Old North Church, etc. look today, but I really don't care to see the narrator traveling around in his car, playing with his radio.  I felt that the film crew just followed this guy around on his vacation with a camera.  And I cared even less to see MODERN New Yorkers (I think they were) going about their business.  At least show me some painting from the 18th century.On to the content.  This DVD is supposed to be from the British perspective.  This is a welcome idea.  I felt that it was very balanced, but too much so!  I didn't get any sense of what the British, in 1776 or now, thought/think about the American Revolution (of course, there is the usual ""loudest yelps of freedom from slavedrivers"" quote, but so what?  That really doesn't tell us much).  I also didn't care for the narrator interviewing random people on a bus.  That looked more like something from Leno's ""Jaywalking"" segment.Well, why did the British lose the war?  The only thing that came through was that they ""didn't win the hearts and minds of the people.""  Well blow me over with a feather!! I want to know what policies and practices, both from the generals and in London, led the British to defeat.  What could they have done differently?  Who was making the policy in London? What forces influenced his decisions? Could we have spent a few minutes watching a reenactment of a debate or council or the Prime Minister even working out things in his own mind?  That would have been made this a great presentation.Quite honestly, there's not much new here.  I would recommend A&E;'s or Discovery's Revolution sets (not PBS's Liberty, though).  They go into much more detail. This set could be cut by half and we wouldn't miss anything.  I've criticized a lot, and my criticisms are valid. However, the show gives good information, but it could have been a whole lot better.Fritz Juengling PhD",3,Disappointing,1093132800,"08 22, 2004",2004,2782,"['have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'DVD', 'American', 'Revolution', 'positive', 'side', 'use', 'reenactors', 'was', 'good', 'Generally', 'PBS', 'reenactors', 'much', 'less', 'A', 'E', 'sister', 'companies', 'Discovery', 'DVD', 'was', 'quite', 'refreshing', 'respect', 'also', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'certain', 'characters', 'talking', 'audience', 'technique', 'historical', 'documentaries', 'up', 'monotony', 'listening', 'narrator', 'history', 'come', 'alive', 'Great', 'job', 'here', 'However', 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'small', 'only', 'handful', 'reenactors', 'showed', 'up', 'filming', 'day', 'see', 'same', 'few', 'guys', 'again', 'again', 'Also', 'use', 'guys', 'beards', 'seemed', 'odd', 'Nevertheless', 'work', 'what', 'have.As', 'far', 'presentation', 'narrator', 'star', 'show', 'screen', 'way', 'too', 'much', ""'interesting"", 'valuable', 'see', 'how', 'old', 'sites', 'e.g', ""Breed's/Bunker"", 'Hills', 'Old', 'North', 'Church', 'etc', 'look', 'today', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'see', 'narrator', 'traveling', 'around', 'car', 'playing', 'radio', 'felt', 'film', 'crew', 'just', 'followed', 'guy', 'around', 'vacation', 'camera', 'cared', 'even', 'less', 'see', 'MODERN', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'think', 'were', 'going', 'business', 'least', 'show', 'painting', '18th', 'century.On', 'content', 'DVD', 'supposed', 'be', 'British', 'perspective', 'welcome', 'idea', 'felt', 'was', 'very', 'balanced', 'too', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'what', 'British', '1776', 'now', 'thought/think', 'American', 'Revolution', 'course', 'usual', 'loudest', 'yelps', 'freedom', 'slavedrivers', 'quote', 'so', 'what', 'really', ""n't"", 'tell', 'much', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'narrator', 'interviewing', 'random', 'people', 'bus', 'looked', 'more', 'something', 'Leno', 'Jaywalking', 'segment.Well', 'why', 'did', 'British', 'lose', 'war', 'only', 'thing', 'came', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'hearts', 'minds', 'people', 'Well', 'feather', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'policies', 'practices', 'generals', 'London', 'led', 'British', 'defeat', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'differently', 'Who', 'was', 'making', 'policy', 'London', 'What', 'influenced', 'decisions', 'Could', 'have', 'spent', 'few', 'minutes', 'watching', 'reenactment', 'debate', 'council', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'even', 'working', 'out', 'things', 'own', 'mind', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'great', 'presentation.Quite', 'honestly', 'not', 'much', 'new', 'here', 'would', 'recommend', 'A', 'E', 'Discovery', 'Revolution', 'sets', 'not', 'PBS', 'Liberty', 'though', 'go', 'much', 'more', 'detail', 'set', 'could', 'be', 'cut', 'half', 'would', ""n't"", 'miss', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'criticized', 'lot', 'criticisms', 'are', 'valid', 'However', 'show', 'good', 'information', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'whole', 'lot', 'Juengling', 'PhD']",Rebels & Redcoats - How Britain Lost America
818797,A3D90TLQSXQ7MW,B0001ZWLVA,Firelock1776,"[10, 17]","I have really enjoyed Professor Holmes work on the History Channel, so I was looking forward to this series. It turned out to be a mixed bag. Professor Holmes style is always entertaining, and I like the way he tours the modern ground while explaining the action. However, he is VERY biased in his viewpoint. I wouldn't mind this so much if it were a BBC production, but as it was produced by an American company that receives US public funds, I would have hoped for a more balanced picture.The bias is less pronounced in the first two installments (out of four), but it is there. Holmes understates the American reasons for going to war and instead plays up the provocative actions of Sam Adams and the Sons of Liberty. He does not, however, mention how the Coercive or ""Intolerable"" Acts passed by Parliament in retaliation for the Boston Tea Party illegally revoked the Massachusetts charter, placed the colony under martial law, and closed the port of Boston for a relatively minor offense. This united the colonies against Britain NOT because, as Holmes implies, there were a lot of young Americans who wanted to expand their trade, but because of the fear and outrage the remaining colonies had of the now completely arbitrary rule being exercised by England over the colonies.Holmes also characterized the battles of Lexington/Concord/Battle Road that began the Revolutionary War as an ""aggressive"" American action. He paints a picture of British generals who hoped to ""avoid war"" by taking the colonists' gunpowder away. He again does not mention that the colonists had every right at that time to stockpile weapons and ammunition under the colony's militia laws, and that once again the British were exercising arbitrary rule by attempting to take the arms away. Indeed, it is should be self evident that the British troops marching into the countryside burning towns were the aggressors who provoked the confrontation.Holmes says the battle of Bunker Hill ""is often characterized as an American moral victory"" but it was really ""a British tactical victory won at great cost."" While he is correct that the battle was a British tactical victory, it was also UNQUESTIONABLY an American moral victory. The Americans lost the field, but only barely, and they inflicted far more casualties on the British than they received. Even a cursory reading of literature of the era quickly reveals how the battle inflated American morale and correspondingly depressed British spirits.Holmes made several outright factual errors when discussing the role of the British and the cruel and inhuman institution of southern slavery. Holmes made it sound as if slavery was purely an American institution and that the British were going to liberate the slaves if they won. This was not true. I don't have the space to go into rebut all of Holmes statements in detail, but it needs to be noted that American slavery existed because of British laws that permitted and encouraged it. Of course slavery was exercised in other British colonies like Jamaica, but the British did nothing to end the practice where they had power to do so. In fact, southern Loyalists and some British officers sold many of the slaves ""liberated"" from southern Patriots to other British colonies in the Caribbean.Holmes also makes it sound as if the Americans were completely incapable of battling the British with regular troops on open fields of battle. He instead mischaracterizes Americans conflict as guerrilla war comparable to Vietnam. While this view is not completely without validity, it is a vast oversimplification that completely ignores the fact that Washington and the leadership of the American cause fought hard to create a regular army that could face the British on equal terms. It was not a guerrilla army that fought the British to a draw at Monmouth Court House, a battle that was a strategic victory for the Americans that essentially ended the war in the North. Partisan actions had their place and were important to winning the war, but partisan actions by themselves would and could not have won the war had there not been a regular army that was able to take on the British on equal terms on the field of battle. The Americans won two huge victories at Saratoga and Yorktown, where they captured large British armies; and the Americans managed to chase the British from Boston and essentially bottle the British up in New York for most of the war. The North Vietnamese never won comparable victories to these against the Americans.So, to sum up, the series is entertaining, but biased. Those who are not very familiar with the war would not be served well by viewing this because of the lack of balance and some of the factual errors. For those who are familiar with the war, Holmes provides a interesting, if sometimes flawed, perspective.",2,Entertaining but biased,1088726400,"07 2, 2004",2004,4829,"['have', 'really', 'enjoyed',

818799,A3KB1H0S7T6JX1,B0001ZWLVA,L Gontzes,"[6, 6]","Rebels and Redcoats: How Britain Lost America provides the British perspective vis-&agrave;-vis the American Revolution. Professor Richard Holmes does an excellent job of shedding light on little known aspects of the American War of Independence thus providing a more pragmatic, realistic, and in effect a more truthful account of events during the 1775-1783 conflict than what has been generally shown to-date. The documentary is divided into four parts dealing with as many aspects of and visiting as many geographic regions of the conflict as possible. Subsequently, the documentary provides valuable insight into a very important period of English (American and British) History.Specifically: We get a taste of the different attitudes and mentality of English North American colonists during the war along with their wavering support for one side and the other (the Loyalist American English and the Continental American English respectively).Moreover, the documentary presents the clash within the British side (i.e. the personality clashes-Clinton vs. Cornwallis, the admirals, etc.).In addition, one truly recognizes and appreciates the involvement of French King Louis XVI (beginning in 1778) and the French contribution (who along with the Spaniards in 1779 and Dutch in 1780 entered the war in opposition to Great Britain, and tipped the scales against King George III.Furthermore, there is special mention of the 100,000 American Loyalists that were forced into exile as well the Continentals' treatment (or mistreatment) of slaves and Indians alike.As a result, Rebels and Redcoats: How Britain Lost America is a daring documentary, which shatters more than a few misconceptions, deliberate and not, surrounding attitudes towards the American War of Independence, and provides for accurate, valid and often unpleasant or painful historical truths.In short, Rebels and Redcoats: How Britain Lost America is a documentary definitely worth watching, and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection, along with films such as Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor (Aidan Quinn and Kelsey Grammer), The Crossing (Jeff Daniels), and Revolution (Al Pacino). 5 Stars",5,"Excellent documentary, though not for the biased viewer!",1248393600,"07 24, 2009",2009,2182,"['Rebels', 'Redcoats', 'How', 'Britain', 'Lost', 'America', 'British', 'perspective', 'vis-', 'agrave', 'American', 'Revolution', 'Professor', 'Richard', 'Holmes', 'excellent', 'job', 'shedding', 'light', 'little', 'known', 'aspects', 'American', 'War', 'Independence', 'thus', 'providing', 'more', 'pragmatic', 'realistic', 'effect', 'more', 'truthful', 'account', 'events', '1775-1783', 'conflict', 'what', 'been', 'generally', 'shown', 'to-date', 'documentary', 'divided', 'four', 'parts', 'dealing', 'many', 'aspects', 'visiting', 'many', 'geographic', 'regions', 'conflict', 'possible', 'Subsequently', 'documentary', 'valuable', 'insight', 'very', 'important', 'period', 'English', 'American', 'British', 'History.Specifically', 'get', 'taste', 'different', 'attitudes', 'mentality', 'English', 'North', 'American', 'colonists', 'war', 'wavering', 'support', 'one', 'side', 'other', 'Loyalist', 'American', 'English', 'Continental', 'American', 'English', 'respectively', '.Moreover', 'documentary', 'presents', 'clash', 'British', 'side', 'i.e', 'personality', 'clashes-Clinton', 'vs.', 'Cornwallis', 'admirals', 'etc', '.In', 'addition', 'one', 'truly', 'involvement', 'French', 'King', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'beginning', '1778', 'French', 'contribution', 'who', 'Spaniards', '1779', 'Dutch', '1780', 'entered', 'war', 'opposition', 'Great', 'Britain', 'tipped', 'scales', 'King', 'George', 'III.Furthermore', 'special', 'mention', '100,000', 'American', 'Loyalists', 'were', 'forced', 'exile', 'as', 'well', 'Continentals', 'treatment', 'mistreatment', 'slaves', 'Indians', 'alike.As', 'result', 'Rebels', 'Redcoats', 'How', 'Britain', 'Lost', 'America', 'daring', 'documentary', 'more', 'few', 'misconceptions', 'deliberate', 'not', 'surrounding', 'attitudes', 'American', 'War', 'Independence', 'accurate', 'valid', 'often', 'unpleasant', 'painful', 'historical', 'truths.In', 'short', 'Rebels', 'Redcoats', 'How', 'Britain', 'Lost', 'America', 'documentary', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'one', 'seriously', 'consider', 'adding', 'movie', 'collection', 'films', 'such', 'Benedict', 'Arnold', 'Question', 'Honor', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'Crossing', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Revolution', 'Al', 'Pacino', '5', 'Stars']",Rebels & Redcoats - How Britain Lost America

Perhaps one of the surprising views expressed is the notion that he believes the Revolution was more a Civil War.  This is a view somewhat debated now by some newer historians.  The verdict is out on that one still in my opinion.The documentry provides a contempory look at many of the Rev War sites which gives it a nice contrast to other similer works.  One suspects that the intent was to give a different, almost travelogue quality to the production. At times it seems like we are on a road trip across the North East of America!This is a small scale production, so those looking for something like LIBEERTY or THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION documentries will not find that here.  Ample use is made of re-enactors, even though some could have looked the part better.  Some of the local Park Rangers and weapons experts provide a folksy addition to the discussion.Despite being almost 4 hrs long, there are still notably gaps in the coverage of the topic.  Not much is said about the Hessians, and after Trenton, the battle of Princeton is completely over-looked.  The same pretty much for Valley Forge and Monmouth battle in 1778.  Richard Holmes tries to show that the British worked against many odds to fight the war as they did.  Still, he could have emphisized more how well they did adapt to fighting in North America.  No other power of the day could have sustained such an effort acorss the Atlantic.  The constant Viet Nam comparisons worked part of the time, but a little too much was made of this.  Some of the discussions with Americans in the South was intended as humor more than anything else.  One wonders if this production was shown in the UK!Over all a decent production, with some different opinions which might be new to some viewers.  Richard Holmes is engaging and pleasant, and the whole production comes off almost like a road trip across the Eastern Coast to track down the Rev War battle sites.
