695519,A2D4TI1Z69CAWV,B000063K0Y,Andrew Frueh,"[1, 2]","I remembered watching this movie a lot on TBS when I was a kid.  It's funny how seriously I took it back then, because now, I can only laugh and roll my eyes.This isn't even a B movie.  It's more like a C movie.The acting is so wooden, there's a constant threat of it going up in flames.The plot, such as it is, runs like this:  An alien ship containing man-sized specimens for a space zoo crashes near a small town.  The critters escape and roam the countryside, racking up a body count.  The sheriff is called in, and help arrives from a scientist (with a secret) from the nearby planetarium.The character of the Mayor is highly concerned that bad press about roaming killer aliens might threaten the towns plans of bringing in an amusement park.  Seriously.The alien costumes are obviously cheap - mostly latex rubber and fur - but their construction is good for this type of movie.  Special effects are mostly bad explosions, bad stop-motion photography, or ok animation.If the medical team we see are proof of why we need health care reform.If you and your friends love to watch movies ""Mystery Science Theater 3000 style,"" this film is PERFECT.

695521,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B000063K0Y,David Girod,"[3, 3]","As a kid growing up in Maryland, long before cable TV reached out into the boonies, we received a total of 5 channels. The three networks of course, and a couple UHF channels, WBFF Channel 45 (now a Fox affiliate)out of Baltimore, and WDCA Channel 20 (now part of MynetworkTV) out of Washington DC. I LIVED on those two UHF channels. They featured everything from the old ""Tarzan"" movies to Kung-Fu theater to syndicated shows like ""Tales from the Darkside"" and ""Friday the 13th: The Series"". But the programming I lived for came on late Saturday night. WBFF had ""The Ghost Host"", a mad-scientist/werewolf dude who creepily introduced bad horror movies, things like ""Attack of the Giant Leeches"" and ""The Deadly Mantis"". On WDCA we had ""The Creature Feature"" a similar show, but it starred Count Gor De Vol. Where ""Ghost Host"" went for chills, the Count went for chuckles. I loved these shows, I loved the bad b-movies, I loved the way the hosts would lead us out to commercial, then lead us back to the movie.Okay, that was a long walk to get to this review, but there is a reason behind my rambling. ""The Alien Factor"" was a mainstay on our UHF channels. This thing would pop up on TV with what I consider it's ""sister film"", and I guess you could call it a sequel, ""Night Beast"", another Don Dohler production shot and filmed here in the Baltimore area. Both are cheesy beyond belief, but if you enjoy B-movies, you will LOVE them. ""The Alien Factor"" actually has a decent little story, and you can tell a bit of thought went into the production. Basically a spaceship carrying zoological specimens crashes in Perry Hall, Maryland. The three aliens escape the wreckage and begin terrorizing the local populace. The big haired sheriff sets out to stop the beasts with his deputy, a local doctor and her nephew are also on hand to help out. Well, they don't actually help do anything, but that is part of the fun. The mayor is worried about a business deal going sour if the aliens aren't stopped, and gets help from a pot-bellied guy from Harford County in stopping the menace.The special effects are non-existent, but still pretty inventive for a shoe-string sci-fi movie (actually much better than the CGI junk forced down our throats these days!), the acting is strictly dinner theater level, and the music had to have been composed on a late 1970's Casio keyboard....but it all comes together in a perfect B-movie storm.Maybe it's because I grew up on this movie, and enjoy seeing a Maryland from 30 years ago, long before developers sunk their teeth into the region, and turned every farm and field into a community of yuppie filled McMansions? Maybe it's because the mayor is played by none other than Dick Dyszel..who would later go on to play Count Gor De Vol? Whatever the reason, ""The Alien Factor"" is fun and well worth the rental fee if nothing else.",3,The Alien Factor...Still Fun 3 Decades Later,1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,2864,"['kid', 'growing', 'up', 'Maryland', 'long', 'cable', 'TV', 'reached', 'out', 'boonies', 'received', 'total', '5', 'channels', 'three', 'networks', 'course', 'couple', 'UHF', 'channels', 'WBFF', 'Channel', '45', 'now', 'Fox', 'affiliate', 'Baltimore', 'WDCA', 'Channel', '20', 'now', 'part', 'MynetworkTV', 'Washington', 'DC', 'LIVED', 'two', 'UHF', 'channels', 'featured', 'everything', 'old', 'Tarzan', 'movies', 'Kung-Fu', 'theater', 'syndicated', 'shows', 'Tales', 'Darkside', 'Friday', '13th', 'Series', 'programming', 'lived', 'came', 'late', 'Saturday', 'night', 'WBFF', 'had', 'Ghost', 'Host', 'mad-scientist/werewolf', 'dude', 'who', 'creepily', 'introduced', 'bad', 'horror', 'movies', 'things', 'Attack', 'Giant', 'Leeches', 'Deadly', 'Mantis', 'WDCA', 'had', 'Creature', 'Feature', 'similar', 'show', 'starred', 'Count', 'Gor', 'De', 'Vol', 'Where', 'Ghost', 'Host', 'went', 'chills', 'Count', 'went', 'chuckles', 'loved', 'shows', 'loved', 'bad', 'b-movies', 'loved', 'way', 'hosts', 'would', 'lead', 'out', 'commercial', 'then', 'lead', 'back', 'movie.Okay', 'was', 'long', 'walk', 'get', 'review', 'reason', 'rambling', 'Alien', 'Factor', 'was', 'mainstay', 'UHF', 'channels', 'thing', 'would', 'pop', 'up', 'TV', 'what', 'consider', 'sister', 'film', 'guess', 'could', 'call', 'sequel', 'Night', 'Beast', 'Don', 'Dohler', 'production', 'shot', 'filmed', 'here', 'Baltimore', 'area', 'are', 'cheesy', 'belief', 'enjoy', 'B-movies', 'will', 'LOVE', 'Alien', 'Factor', 'actually', 'decent', 'little', 'story', 'can', 'tell', 'bit', 'thought', 'went', 'production', 'Basically', 'spaceship', 'carrying', 'zoological', 'specimens', 'crashes', 'Perry', 'Hall', 'Maryland', 'three', 'aliens', 'escape', 'wreckage', 'begin', 'terrorizing', 'local', 'populace', 'big', 'haired', 'sheriff', 'sets', 'out', 'stop', 'beasts', 'deputy', 'local', 'doctor', 'nephew', 'are', 'also', 'hand', 'help', 'out', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'help', 'do', 'anything', 'part', 'fun', 'mayor', 'worried', 'business', 'deal', 'going', 'sour', 'aliens', 'are', ""n't"", 'stopped', 'help', 'pot-bellied', 'guy', 'Harford', 'County', 'stopping', 'menace.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'non-existent', 'still', 'pretty', 'inventive', 'shoe-string', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'actually', 'much', 'better', 'CGI', 'junk', 'forced', 'throats', 'days', 'acting', 'strictly', 'dinner', 'theater', 'level', 'music', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'composed', 'late', '1970', 'Casio', 'keyboard', 'together', 'perfect', 'B-movie', 'storm.Maybe', 'grew', 'up', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'Maryland', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'long', 'developers', 'sunk', 'teeth', 'region', 'turned', 'farm', 'field', 'community', 'yuppie', 'filled', 'McMansions', 'Maybe', 'mayor', 'played', 'none', 'other', 'Dick', 'Dyszel..who', 'would', 'later', 'go', 'play', 'Count', 'Gor', 'De', 'Vol', 'reason', 'Alien', 'Factor', 'fun', 'well', 'rental', 'fee', 'nothing', 'else']",The Alien Factor

My vhs video has vibrant color, studio quality picture that looks like it was remastered back then.  It is literally 10 times the quality of the dvd in every aspect.  The DVD has Washed out color, terrible graininess, is darker, has some kind of interference that comes and goes in the scratchy picture.  A guy was selling his Media VHS on Ebay for 50 bucks, and he didn't even know what he had or he would have mentioned the incredible difference in quality!  Nobody bought it, because they didn't know about this vast difference in quality.  So since nobody will pay what the VHS is worth, and they would rather settle for the cheap dvd, I'm going to just sit back and enjoy my 100% better quality and you all can eat your hearts out.  That is, unless you'd like to buy this tape for 50 bucks, just kidding.  Seriously though, I'd list it on Amazon, but they don't even have a record of it for selling.  Bottom line for those who really want to see the movie the way I'm seeing it, keep on the look out for that VHS.

695523,A3T673XO75VMEM,B000063K0Y,"Jose Angeles ""some dork""","[0, 0]","Alien Factor has this amazing story about aliens crashing on earth, terrorizing people, getting people to act stupid about handling the problem, and the ending is a huge unexpected twist that got me giggling for days. There were awesome primitive lazer beam effects and a silly yet amusing explanation for many of the bizzare happenings. The best part about the movie was this freakishly tall alien walking on carpet covered stilts. It looked like he was going to tip over any second too. He also had this weird thing with swinging his right hand in a rhythm. Watch as people run in fear at this thing they probably had to help up after filming the scene.Fiend was awesome too. A simple story about this neighborhood jerk that chokes people to death in order to gain energy to live longer. Nobody suspects him though (even if his murders are done in broad daylight) The one man to stop him is his next door neighbor that hates his loud music. Plenty of trademark Don Dohler cheesy lazer/light effects.Don Dohler is a genius filmmaker, Nightbeast was rad too and even had some gore.
