772321,AJWMVSLEVJ1UP,B0000C23HO,Alan W. Petrucelli,"[10, 10]","She may not have stuffed the dailies in her shoes or strummed ukuleles, but she has most certainly seen good times and bum times and sang the blues.And she's still here.And it's those blues --- and those good and bum times ---that make for a most colorful evening. Elaine Stritch, the septuagenarian recovering alcoholic, functioning diabetic and Tony-winning performer, has taken the liberty of sharing her life and all its highs and lows in ""Elaine Stritch At Liberty.""She's seen them all, my dear, and she's still here.Like the performer herself, the show is hard to pigeonhole: There are enough songs to call it a revue, enough juicy anecdotes and gossipy stories to call it a one-woman show. But labels don't matter. What matters is that Stritch --- best-known for her role in the Noel Coward musical ""Sail Away,"" too often associated with the Walter Kerr and Jean Kerr musical flop ""Goldilocks"" and canonized for the Stephen Sondheim musical ""Company,"" in which she sang ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" and too long a cult favorite among theatre devotees --- creates two and a half hours of sheer magic.She enters carrying a chair, and wearing black tights and a tailored white dress shirt --- ""an existential problem in tights,"" is how she refers to herself. Stritch's legs still have it; her body, despite the years of boozing, late-nighting and neglect, is still supple. And she proves it consistently, lugging around the chair, moving it from here to there, most often to up stage so she can strut her stuff walking down stage. No fool is she.)The opening line: ""It's like what the prostitute once said: it's not the work; it's the stairs;"" and the opening number --- ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" --- offers a tease of what's in store, sets the stage for a life about to made bare. What makes the show work is that Stritch is as tough as she is real --- ""you've got to be real to be funny,"" reminds us.She doesn't shy away from the pain. There's lots of loss here; aborted romances, vanished jobs (including screwing up an audition for ""The Golden Girls""), a dying husband. Stritch recounts first taking a drink, at age 13 or 14, at her father's insistence, and then developing an addiction for the stuff, even getting sloshed at the family dinner table. Alcohol would later be a co-star in her life, destroying romances and igniting trouble. We laugh at the stories, but the show is riddled with profoundly moving, emotional moments; we feel the pain and the strength that has led Stritch down the path of survival. ""I think I'm reclaiming a lot of my life hat I wasn't all there for,"" she muses toward the end of evening, as an explanation to why she did the show.Stritch is a spellbinding storyteller. Whatever all the tales are true or allegorical doesn't matter. We travel with her from her home in Michigan to arriving in New York, taking classes at the New School and meeting a young actor named Marlon Brando, who it seemed, slept with all the females except Elaine until one night ...She spends some times (a bit too much time) recounting how she understudied Ethel Merman in ""Call Me Madam"" at the same time she was performing in new Haven in the out-of-try-outs for ""Pal Joey."" She called a ex ""beau"" who she knew had an MG, and convinced him to drive her nightly from New York to New Haven ... time perfectly, so that she could go on stage for her second act show-stopping, ""Zip.""That song and many, many others are here ... including the long-forgotten ""Civilization,"" originated by Stritch in the long-forgotten ""Angel in the Wings"" and a hit for Bing Crosby and The Andrews Sisters. (Those who remember 78 records will remember: Bongo/bongo/bongo/I don't wanna leave the Congo/Oh no no no no no) ... ""I'm Still Here"" and, of course, ""The Ladies Who Lunch.""At Liberty is so seamlessly constructed that George C. Wolfe's direction is unobtrusive. The show's honesty is its strength, and its strength comes from its honest star, who's enough of a pro to know when (and how) to pause and how to deliver a zinger. When Stritch mentions famous friends --- a drunken Judy Garland bidding her good night at 7 in the morning, Noel Coward respecting her talents so immensely that he asked her to star in a musical, Rock Hudson repeatedly taking her to dinner while they were shooting a film in Europe (she turned down Ben Gazzarra hoping to get a piece of the Rock ... ""and we all know what a bum decision that turned out to be,"" she recalls), Gig Young asking to marry her, dishing Gloria Swanson and Dagmar and Marge Champion because of Stritch's on-stage antics in a summer stock tour of ""The Women"") --- it's a natural, self-absorbed, exercise in name dropping, but it's also an insight into the rich life of one of the theater's richest personalities.I'll drink to that!

And most of us are rather pleased that her work in film has always been secondary (her best work in that medium was in Woody Allen's SEPTEMBER)...and that her heart will ALWAYS be in the THEATAH. Although this one-woman-show has plenty of musical numbers, it is mostly an autobiographical tirade, designed to woo our sympathies. As a stage performance it was incredible; as a filmed performance with many close-ups it's a bit disconcerting, like sitting on the corner stool in a prize fight. This is not to diminish the writing, pacing, humor, or the brilliance of Stritch's performance. It's just a little overpowering. At the center of her angst is her Catholic upbringing, lack of luck in love, and her struggle with alcoholism. In fact, she is so tough on herself that you almost fail to notice how tough she is on others. Just short of libelous, we get some very interesting glimpses of her fellow performers: Gig Young, Ethel Merman, Judy Garland, Marlon Brando, Gloria Swanson, and Rock Hudson, to name a few.So move your barcalounger back twelve feet, get out your handkerchief, and hang on to your hat (does anyone still wear a hat?)

""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[3, 3]","The DVD cover of the award-winning ""Elaine Stritch: At Liberty"" compares  her to Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra, and Barbra Streisand. I've known for a long time that she is one of the grande-dames of Broadway, but I wondered if she was worthy of such comparisons. Well, for starters, Elaine, who describes herself at one point as an ""existential problem in tights,"" holds your attention all by herself for over two hours, and how many entertainers can do that these days? In her alternately hilarious and poignant one-woman show, Elaine takes us through all the ""headaches, the heartaches, the backaches, the flops"", the success, and so much more in her incredible 50+ odd years in show-business. Elaine has professional and personal stories to tell (involving the likes of Marlon Brando, Ethel Merman, Gig Young, Ben Gazarra, Rock Hudson, Noel Coward,  Richard Burton,  Judy Garland, Hal Prince, Stephen Sondheim, and a cast of real divas in a summer stock production of ""The Women""),  songs to sing, and a notorious, endearing  ""potty-mouth.""  Elaine is completely, 100% ""Original Elaine""; with  a refreshing lack of vanity. She is wise and, at last, self-aware enough to know the mistakes she made along the way. ""Maybe if I'd stopped to have a Diet Coke somewhere, I might have made a few more adult decisions,"" she says. Elaine takes full responsibility for blowing-- big time!-- her audition for ""The Golden Girls"", for example.She hilariously recalls running around like a crazy lady in the name of show-biz dedication (rushing to New York City to see if she was needed as ""stand-by"" for  Ethel Merman in ""Call Me Madam; rushing back to New Haven to sing the showstopper ""Zip!"" in ""Pal Joey"").""And you wonder why I drank,"" she hollers to her captivated audience. And, underlining everything is this: Elaine was a hard-working, self-destructive,  lonely, insecure, frightened, vulnerable lady who could never go on stage or on film ""alone."" This led to life-long alcoholism. Elaine, heartbreakingly,  admits that, due to drinking, she was ""absent almost  always"" from her own life. When alcoholism was combined with diabetes, Elaine played a dangerous game of Russian Roulette. She almost lost her battle with the bottle. Yes, she sings her signature song ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" from ""Company"" here. But, more importantly, she has earned the right to sing ""I'm Still Here."" She means every word of Sondheim's song because she has lived it.  Yes, Elaine is still here-- and I'm so glad!  She closes the show with, of all things, ""Something Good"" from the film version of ""The Sound Of Music."" Elaine sings it, full of genuine, quiet graditude, to her audience.

Ms. Stritch is just amazing in this show. I'd seen her in films and on TV on occasion, but this performance puts them all to shame. Her story about understudying Merman is just a riot. Her Judy Garland story is wonderfully funny, as is the story of her Rock Hudson dating. She's sad in recounting the story of her husband's death and in relating her long, long battle with alcoholism. Her name dropping stories are in turn funny and sad. The songs are great, even though you can tell the years of booze and cigarettes have certainly taken the toll on her voice. Her innocence in the early days of her Broadway career, and even as late as the early 70's in Company when she didn't know who Mahler was, is just amazing. All in all, Elaine is just a force of nature and this video should be watched by all lovers of the Broadway theater. A great companion piece to this would be the DVD of Company:Original Cast Album.

772328,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B0000C23HO,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[5, 5]","Elaine Stritch is a star.  Not necessarily because she can sing; in truth she hasn't much of a voice, raspy and of limited range.  Not necessarily because she can dance; she can, but she's hardly in the same leage with the likes of Elenor Powell and Ginger Rogers.  Not necessarily because she can act--although she most emphatically can do that and has proven it on numerous occasions.  No, she is a star because she is Elaine Stritch, possessed of a quality that instantly draws every eye and attunes every ear.Best known for her work on the New York and London stage, she is perhaps most famous for creating the role of Joann in the original production of Sondheim's landmark musical COMPANY--and for originating a key song in that show that go on to become her signature number, ""The Ladies Who Lunch,"" a poisonous and drunken diatribe against superflous women.  It was a character and song that keyed into her own personality: Stritch was an alcoholic throughout much of her life, a fact that undercut her career on numerous occasions and ultimately prevented her from obtaining the mass media celebrity she might have otherwise enjoyed.ELAINE STRITCH: AT LIBERTY is essentially the story of her own life told by Stritch herself through a series of songs, a few dance steps here and there, and an endless series of antedotes about who, what, and when.  Dressed in a long white shirt and black tights, she takes to the stage with a single chair upon which she perches rather like a naughty child--and she rules the audience with an iron fist.  The display ranges from horror to hilarity, piety to pity; her life has been a wild ride, and she bares as much as one can in this slightly over two hour show.  It is true that she ultimately emerges as unduly self-absorbed; it is true that she is often distinctly calculating in her performance.  But that is part of what a star is, and she is all of that and then some.When Stritch says she's been there and done that, you believe her.  She looks it.  She sounds it.  She moves it.  She has clearly been around the block more times than she count, sometimes against her will but more often as not as a result of bad decisions made.  At times she is wickedly funny to the point of toxicity--her stories of a stock production of THE WOMEN is laugh-out-loud funny--but there is often a bitter sting at the end, a twist that brings us back to the fact that she was a determined alcoholic and in many respects self destructive throughout much of her life and career.Stritch can name drop with the best of them: Noel Coward, Judy Garland, Rock Hudson, and Gloria Swanson are just a few of the names.  She tells her stories well, and you can't help but laugh, you can't help but mist up a bit.  And then, of course, there is that lived-in face and that croaking voice.  Yes, her range is limited and yes, the years have taken a toll--but even so she is a remarkable interpreter, tossing off the complex lyrics and melodies of such composer-writers as Sondheim and Coward with equal ease.  She is from start to finish commanding in all that she says, does, and sings, and it is a brilliant performance.The cinematography is quite simple, making effective use of occasional flash cuts but on the whole keeping a firm focus on Stritch herself.  There are no bonuses on the DVD, but frank Stritch should be bonus enough.

In this swiftly-paced one hurricane-of-a-performer show she lets out all the stops, recounting her life in the theater with its comic and poignant personal moments while giving brief but telling impersonations of Judy Garland, Noel Coward, and Ethel Merman at her coarsest. She jokes about her romantic attraction to Rock Hudson and Marlon Brando.Stritch is willing to share her naivet&eacute; with the audience, thinking that Mahler referred to a New York pastry shop and that heterosexual meant gay. Her rendition of a number of songs associated with her including ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" from ""Company"" are alone worth the price of the DVD. Her anecdotes about her long list of celebrity friends over the years also brings up her closest friend and stage savior of fifty years, booze, a friendship that was ended by a life-threatening bout of diabetes.Her body at 77 (born in 1926) is still in great shape. She was never a big star in Hollywood movies. She was a woman who had a lot of lucky breaks, but they were breaks justified by her talent. By irritating the director, she lost a great opportunity by being turned down as one of the stars of ""The Golden Girls"" that could have earned her a godzillion bucks. Her strong will power and her dedication to the theater have served her well in the long run. If you are a Stritch fan, you'll love this show and want to watch it over and over again.
