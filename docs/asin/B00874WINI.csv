Lazaroff ""Book lover""","[0, 1]","I love watching movies, (I've even seen &#34;Q: The Winged Serpent&#34; 6 times!), but this twenty or so minute flop is short on everything a movie should be, at least in the opinion of this reviewer. Science fiction movies, if made since 2000 or thereabouts, should pay attention the science in their fiction, but this movie prefers to shuck all attempts at realism in order to demonstrate Mankind's vast ability to destroy itself. By now everyone is aware we are killing our planet through every possible means, the moon is NOT the place anyone with so much as an ort of knowledge would, and should, understand. Advanced humans from the future, able to zip about like Kirk using a teleporter, would not need spaceships, and they might even try just a little to help the human race continue existing before disaster strikes. Some secret concerning the Apollo moon missions comes to light and every single person on Earth is suddenly having to take a quarter-million mile journey to the moon to survive and live out their lives. Would the moon even hold all 8 billion of us? Not without HUGE warehousing and infrastructure - but that must be a problem for the other makers of movies, this one simply implies that some heavenly intervention is needed and supplied, with absolute disregard to the physics of the solution provided. And...what happened to the Earth anyway?
