I had never seen this show before buying it from Amazon.  Robert Culp was just as cocky in this show as he was in the shows he did afterwards.

Used to wish it was an hour. This DVD is great. there are a few minor glitches, but it is from an old source so was not really disappointed.

Stories are generally pretty interesting but quality of picture detracts substantially. Not near the released video quality of Wanted Dead or Alive, the Steve McQueen oater that sprang form this very series. But then Robert Culp was no Steve McQueen so I'm sure didn't rate the post production effort to produce watchable discs. This show lasted two seasons which is indicative of the routine story lines and original production values, I'd judge. Of interest to die hard western (like me) fans principally.
