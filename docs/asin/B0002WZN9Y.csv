848402,A33L7G4E8CID3,B0002WZN9Y,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[132, 142]","The West Wing's third season began in sadness. The 9/11 attacks would change much about our country (and this show), and we got an episode after them (Isaac and Ishmael) that attempted to show sensitivity and comfort during a confusing time. At that time, it wasn't generally liked, but it seems to have aged well (it was voted the 10th best episode by Bravo viewers earlier this year). After this, though, the season began in earnest, picking up where the astonishingly good ""Two Cathedrals"" episode left off and begins a multi-episodic story arc that has the staff at odds with each other as well as the introduction of the fabulous Ron Silver as Bruno Gianelli (he would get an Oscar nod for his performance). Truth be told, this season didn't have the same uniformity of excellence that previous ones did--the middle of the season was lukewarm, with episodes like ""The Two Bartlets"" and ""Night Five"" which rank among the lowest in the series (let's keep it in perspective, though: the worst of this season is still better than the best of the current one). However, the show pulls off one of the best episodes of the show in the finale, ""Posse Comitatus"", which has President Bartlet grappling with faith, law and morality in the matter of having an Osama bin Ladin-like terrorist assassinated. The sheer shock of the final act still brings chills down my spine every time I see it. Also notable: perhaps the most emotional episode in the series, ""Bartlet for America"" won an Emmy and its final scene between the President and Leo rivals the denouement in Kubrick's Paths of Glory for full-force emotional impact. ""Gone Quiet"" is a gripping story about a lost submarine, and features a wonderful, curmedgeonly performance by Hal Holbrook as Assistant Secretary of State Albie Duncan. ""100,000 Airplanes"" is an example of the complex narrative structure of the series: there are no less than four major stories revolving around Bartlet's State of the Union address, each of which are engaging. One of my favorites is ""The U.S. Poet Laureate,"" which covers the scandal following an off-air gaffe on the part of the president. Says C.J. Cregg, ""It's a classic Washington scandal. We got in trouble for telling the truth."" But all through this season are these character threads: the President and Abbey (leading to a surprisingly touching scene in ""Dead Irish Writers""), Josh and Amy's budding relationship, Toby and his ex-wife, Andie, and, of course, the President and Leo. The final one was always one of the most satisfying relationships with the show, and the fact that the current WW writers have all but eliminated it is one of my major beefs with the show right now. Enough soapboxing. Season 3 of the West Wing contains powerful drama and excitement, examination of real political issues and real people. It's definitely worth the money for anyone.",5,Season 3,1096675200,"10 2, 2004",2004,2858,"['West', 'Wing', 'third', 'season', 'began', 'sadness', '9/11', 'attacks', 'would', 'change', 'much', 'country', 'show', 'got', 'episode', 'Isaac', 'Ishmael', 'attempted', 'show', 'sensitivity', 'comfort', 'confusing', 'time', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'generally', 'liked', 'have', 'aged', 'well', 'was', 'voted', '10th', 'best', 'episode', 'Bravo', 'viewers', 'earlier', 'year', 'though', 'season', 'began', 'earnest', 'picking', 'up', 'where', 'astonishingly', 'good', 'Two', 'Cathedrals', 'episode', 'left', 'off', 'multi-episodic', 'story', 'arc', 'staff', 'odds', 'other', 'as', 'well', 'introduction', 'fabulous', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'Bruno', 'Gianelli', 'would', 'get', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'performance', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'uniformity', 'excellence', 'previous', 'ones', 'did', 'middle', 'season', 'was', 'lukewarm', 'episodes', 'Two', 'Bartlets', 'Night', 'Five', 'rank', 'lowest', 'series', 'let', 'keep', 'perspective', 'worst', 'season', 'still', 'better', 'best', 'current', 'one', 'However', 'show', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'show', 'finale', 'Posse', 'Comitatus', 'President', 'Bartlet', 'grappling', 'faith', 'law', 'morality', 'matter', 'having', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Ladin-like', 'terrorist', 'assassinated', 'sheer', 'shock', 'final', 'act', 'still', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'time', 'see', 'Also', 'notable', 'perhaps', 'most', 'emotional', 'episode', 'series', 'Bartlet', 'America', 'won', 'Emmy', 'final', 'scene', 'President', 'Leo', 'denouement', 'Kubrick', 'Paths', 'Glory', 'full-force', 'emotional', 'impact', 'Gone', 'Quiet', 'gripping', 'story', 'lost', 'submarine', 'wonderful', 'curmedgeonly', 'performance', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'Assistant', 'Secretary', 'State', 'Albie', 'Duncan', '100,000', 'Airplanes', 'example', 'complex', 'narrative', 'structure', 'series', 'are', 'less', 'four', 'major', 'stories', 'revolving', 'Bartlet', 'State', 'Union', 'address', 'are', 'engaging', 'One', 'favorites', 'U.S', 'Poet', 'Laureate', 'scandal', 'following', 'off-air', 'gaffe', 'part', 'president', 'C.J', 'Cregg', 'classic', 'Washington', 'scandal', 'got', 'trouble', 'telling', 'truth', 'season', 'are', 'character', 'threads', 'President', 'Abbey', 'leading', 'surprisingly', 'touching', 'scene', 'Dead', 'Irish', 'Writers', 'Josh', 'Amy', 'budding', 'relationship', 'Toby', 'ex-wife', 'Andie', 'course', 'President', 'Leo', 'final', 'one', 'was', 'always', 'one', 'most', 'satisfying', 'relationships', 'show', 'fact', 'current', 'WW', 'writers', 'have', 'eliminated', 'one', 'major', 'beefs', 'show', 'right', 'now', 'Enough', 'soapboxing', 'Season', '3', 'West', 'Wing', 'powerful', 'drama', 'excitement', 'examination', 'real', 'political', 'issues', 'real', 'people', 'definitely', 'worth', 'money', 'anyone']",WEST WING: S3 (DVD)

848406,ABRKIJ6D4V42O,B0002WZN9Y,"Amazon Customer ""space_hamster""","[0, 0]","I admit that the Season 3 is where I lost track of the show. The debut episode, 'Manchester', marked a change in tone for the entire series. It's obvious that 9/11 changed the West Wing in a fundamental way. There's considerably less incidental music from ""Snuffy"" Walden. The attitude of the characters is far grimmer. More attention is placed on Middle Eastern politics and terrorism, and less to domestic political problems.We're also introducted to the much vilified Amy Gardner, played by Mary Louise-Parker. As I was heavily influenced by fan reaction rather than actually watching the show, I hated this character. But now that I've actually watched the show, I really like Amy. She's a perfect match for Josh, and her relationship with him is realistic and just downright charming. Which reminds me, I've gotta catch Mary Louise-Parker in Weeds.Another character that I think gets plenty of attention this season is Donna. She no longer has the outwardly ditzy persona of seasons 1 and 2. Instead, she gets to handle a scandalous relationship with a Republican lawyer. And she gets a lucrative job offer. She becomes more aware of her own self-worth this season, and it's wonderful to see Donna maturing and growing before our very eyes.The only genuine clanger this season is President Bartlet's ""psychological problems"" that are explored in 'The Two Bartlets' and 'Night Five'. What's odd is that the President has never exhibited any of these symptoms before .In summary, this season marks a huge sea-change for The West Wing. Gone is the bright, cheery optimism of the first two seasons. The events of 9/11 put an end to that. But this is still The West Wing. And these are still the characters we know and love, written by one of America's greatest playwrights.

848412,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0002WZN9Y,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[6, 7]","Premiering in September 1999, the original NBC series West Wing built an instant cult following with its seemingly realistic weekly excursions into the inner sanctums of the White House. The series became such a hit that some pollsters claimed that certain people actually believed Jed Bartlet was the real president (although, if true, this is more of a negative reflection on the intelligence of the electorate, and not necessarily an indication of West Wing's realism). But regardless, the truth of the matter is that West Wing definitely strikes a chord with certain audiences, providing entertaining brew of action, suspense, and drama on a weekly basis...Seasoned Hollywood actor Martin Sheen plays the lead role of President Jed Bartlet. The day-to-day affairs of Bartlet's administration are run by a number of individuals who surround him, among them are: Claudia ""C.J."" Cregg (Allison Janney), Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford), Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe), Toby Ziegler (Richard Schiff), Leo McGarry (John Spencer), and Charlie Young (Dule Hill). West Wing follows these dedicated staffers as they work extended hours behind-the-scenes to help keep the White House running smoothly. Along the way, the stress of the job and the characters' personal lives make for an interesting glimpse into what many believe is an accurate portrayal of a real-life White House administration...The West Wing (Season 3) DVD offers a number of dramatic episodes including the season premiere ""Manchester: Part 1"" in which C.J. mistakenly reveals during her press conference that President Bartlet suffers from a medical condition, prompting an onslaught of media attention regarding the president's health. In gearing up to spin the revelation, the staffers discuss whether or not Bartlet should apologize to the nation for failing to reveal the problem. Meanwhile, Abbey is not pleased when she learns that Jed has decided to run for re-election... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""The Indians in the Lobby"" in which a pair of Indians announce their plans to stand in the lobby of the Department of Interior until they receive an answer on their 15-year-old application to buy back lost Indian lands, and ""Hartsfield's Landing"" in which the staffers begin to execute their presidential primary strategy (beginning in New Hampshire) in their plan to win Bartlet's re-election...Below is a list of episodes included on the West Wing (Season 3) DVD:Episode 45 (Manchester: Part 1)Episode 46 (Manchester: Part 2)Episode 47 (Ways and Means)Episode 48 (On the Day Before)Episode 49 (War Crimes)Episode 50 (Gone Quiet)Episode 51 (The Indians in the Lobby)Episode 52 (The Women of Qumar)Episode 53 (Bartlet for America)Episode 54 (H.

BUT the weakness of the story line takes in down to a three i.e. a premise is established early in the program, and the solution is arrived at the end in a rather weak manner. We spend a entire program dealing with a submarine that has not reported in. And in the final minutes all is well. The sub was being shadowed by a North Korean ship, it escaped and reported in. It took 45 minutes to set the problem and about 20 seconds to bring it to conclusion.It brings to mind an old radio adventure series called(I think) the Adventures of Jack Armstrong. Every Friday, the show ended with Jack in some peril, and we had to wait until Monday to find his solution.

848418,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B0002WZN9Y,Craig MACKINNON,"[6, 7]","The third season of the West Wing falters a little relative to the second and fourth seasons, but the worst West Wing episode is still better than most other TV shows.  This season consists of 21 episodes in continuity, plus 2 ""bonus"" shows.  The season opener (Isaac and Ishmael) is one of the bonus shows and is also one of the highlights of the series.  It deals with the aftermath of September 11 (airing only a month after the fact) outside continuity of the show, but with everyone in character.  The second special show is a documentary on the way government is run - it may be self-congratulatory, but it also assures the viewer that they are seeing a ""truthful"" representation of life in the West Wing.  Also reassuring is the presence of 3 former presidents (Ford, Carter, and Clinton) in the special as well as numerous presidential aides (including notable Republicans Henry Kissinger and Karl Rove): even if you don't agree with the politics of the liberal/Democratic president of the show, thoughtful members of both parties like the show because it shows the president always trying to do what he feels is right.  And that's what you need your elected leaders doing!In between these two specials are the real, in continuity episodes.  They are a mixed batch, in terms of how interesting they are, but generally improve as the weeks go on.  The president accepts a congressional censure for hiding his medical condition after much angst and testimony from his staff.  The re-election campaign kicks off and Gov. Ritchie appears as the Republican nominee.  Meanwhile legislation is passed, the president vetoes a bill, and the cliffhanger ending sends reverberations through all of Season 4 and into Season 5.  There is one unfortunate addition to the semi-regular cast - the feminist Amy Gardner who is as annoying as the late unlamented Mandy from season 1.  For the most part, though, the supporting roles are great: the election spin-doctor Bruno, Leo's lawyer Jordan, Mark Harmon's secret service agent, and the first appearance of Adm. Fitzwallace (chair of the Joint Chiefs).However, outside of the ""23rd"" (documentary) episode, the extras on this DVD are mainly disappointing.  Not in quality (they are short, but enjoyable), but in quantity.  There are only 3 commentaries (as oppposed to The Simpsons or Futurama, for example, which have commentaries on every episode).  Finally, I will voice once again my main objection to the extras - why aren't there political scientists and/or politicians on commentaries explaining the actual governmental workings?  For example, on the episode where Bartlet vetoes the bill (Ways and Means), or one with the senate hearings (Bartlet for America), or how the primary system works (Hartsfield's Landing).",4,"A slow start, but picks up great momentum as the season progresses",1124668800,"08 22, 2005",2005,2766,"['third', 'season', 'West', 'Wing', 'little', 'relative', 'second', 'fourth', 'seasons', 'worst', 'West', 'Wing', 'episode', 'still', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'TV', 'shows', 'season', '21', 'episodes', 'continuity', '2', 'bonus', 'shows', 'season', 'opener', 'Isaac', 'Ishmael', 'one', 'bonus', 'shows', 'also', 'one', 'highlights', 'series', 'aftermath', 'September', '11', 'airing', 'only', 'month', 'fact', 'continuity', 'show', 'everyone', 'character', 'second', 'special', 'show', 'documentary', 'way', 'government', 'run', 'may', 'be', 'self-congratulatory', 'also', 'viewer', 'are', 'seeing', 'truthful', 'representation', 'life', 'West', 'Wing', 'Also', 'reassuring', 'presence', '3', 'former', 'presidents', 'Ford', 'Carter', 'Clinton', 'special', 'as', 'well', 'numerous', 'presidential', 'aides', 'including', 'notable', 'Republicans', 'Henry', 'Kissinger', 'Karl', 'Rove', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'politics', 'liberal/Democratic', 'president', 'show', 'thoughtful', 'members', 'parties', 'show', 'president', 'always', 'trying', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'what', 'need', 'elected', 'leaders', 'doing', 'two', 'specials', 'are', 'real', 'continuity', 'episodes', 'are', 'mixed', 'batch', 'terms', 'how', 'interesting', 'are', 'generally', 'improve', 'weeks', 'go', 'president', 'congressional', 'censure', 'hiding', 'medical', 'condition', 'much', 'angst', 'testimony', 'staff', 're-election', 'campaign', 'Gov', 'Ritchie', 'Republican', 'nominee', 'Meanwhile', 'legislation', 'passed', 'president', 'bill', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'sends', 'reverberations', 'Season', '4', 'Season', '5', 'one', 'unfortunate', 'addition', 'semi-regular', 'cast', 'feminist', 'Amy', 'Gardner', 'who', 'as', 'annoying', 'late', 'unlamented', 'Mandy', 'season', '1', 'most', 'part', 'though', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'great', 'election', 'spin-doctor', 'Bruno', 'Leo', 'lawyer', 'Jordan', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'secret', 'service', 'agent', 'first', 'appearance', 'Adm.', 'Fitzwallace', 'chair', 'Joint', 'Chiefs', '.However', '23rd', 'documentary', 'episode', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'mainly', 'disappointing', 'Not', 'quality', 'are', 'short', 'enjoyable', 'quantity', 'are', 'only', '3', 'commentaries', 'oppposed', 'Simpsons', 'Futurama', 'example', 'have', 'commentaries', 'episode', 'Finally', 'will', 'voice', 'once', 'again', 'main', 'objection', 'extras', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'political', 'scientists', 'and/or', 'politicians', 'commentaries', 'explaining', 'actual', 'governmental', 'workings', 'example', 'episode', 'where', 'Bartlet', 'bill', 'Ways', 'Means', 'one', 'senate', 'hearings', 'Bartlet', 'America', 'how', 'primary', 'system', 'Hartsfield', 'Landing']",WEST WING: S3 (DVD)

The main reason I love this show is the writing; the excellent character acting and cinematography coming in second and third, respectively.  The dialogue is thoughtfully written and remains fresh, for the most part, even after more than sixty episodes.  The third season picks up appropriately where the last episode from season two left off but the plot is then put on hold for one full show due to the events of September 11th.  The very first episode, which stands entirely alone, has more to do with explaining why those types of events occur in the first place, what belief systems are driving the extremists, and why, in short, do they hate America so much.  It was yet another enlightening episode, like many others from the previous two seasons, and is a somber tone to begin season three.  But most of the episodes that follow are actually upbeat and subsequently less passionate than season two.  I absolutely adored season two, and I knew going in to season three that high expectations were both in order and obviously unfair.  The writing is still superb.  The entire cast, with many, many guest actors entering and infusing their immense talents into the show, all look and feel more comfortable in their roles than ever before.  There are many moments of brilliance here, my personal favorite coming late in the season (episode #17 ""The U.S. Poet Laureate"") where the show is elevated to greatness throughout with every single nuance and word so carefully and emotionally revealed that something magical happens.  That entire episode is stellar.  This brings me to the only downfall to the season, which is that ""The U.S. Poet Laureate"" is the only show that never becomes predictable or stagnant or has a rare flat spot.  There are many great moments throughout each and every show, but unlike season two which had a multitude of outstanding whole episodes, season three only had one amazing episode and many other good ones.  To reiterate: the writing is the main reason to watch this show, regardless of untied sub-plots and too many unresolved characters exiting, not to be seen for five or six shows at a time.  The stories are at their most fresh in season three when flashback episodes unfold, where the actors give their characters more vitality and youthfulness instead of the weary characters of the West Wing stumbling into a re-election year.  Overall, this is yet another solid season of one of the most impressive shows ever brought to television.  Those who criticize ""The West Wing"" too much should look and see and remind themselves of all the heaping crud that comprises most network television, and thank their lucky stars that a show this professional and sometimes incredible was ever made.  Thank you Aaron Sorkin, and the entire cast and production staff of ""The West Wing.""

Kutinsky ""ekutinsky""","[25, 73]","It may have been the year that netted a dozen or so Emmy's (there was certainly no competition amongst the mediocre nominees), but this was the year that smelled like stagnation for the series.  There's a handful of strong episodes - great emotional ones like ""Bartlet for America,"" about Leo's alcoholic breakdown, or ""Dead Irish Writers,"" the funny and touching episode dealing with Abbey's fallout over the abuse of her medical license.  But for the most part, the ideas have gone stale - the impeachment plotline goes nowhere interesting, which is perhaps why it gets jettisoned midway through the year, and the season-ending culmination of CJ's bodyguard plotline with Mark Harmon is just embarrassing.  Aaron Sorkin seemed to be losing grip of his characters this year, especially his women who get plotlines that are either dull (CJ gets heated over land taken from the Indians!) or really dull (Donna needs to get out of jury duty - or, as I viewed it, time for a bathroom break).  In fact, the only woman he really gets right is the new one, Mary Louise Parker's feminist Amy that gives the season it's most memorable moments of heart and humor (""and I have legs that go all the way to the floor!"").  The West Wing even in its greatest episodes jutted up against a line of self-righteousness, and although this season doesn't spend the whole year jumping over that line, it spends far too much of it for comfort.  And for anyone taking votes on the jump-the-shark moment of the series, I'd pick ""Hartsfield's Landing,"" which overloads with Sorkin quirkiness - too much useless trivia, too many trivial sideplots, and a weak central metaphor about the president playing chess with everyone.

This comes in the wake of President Bartlett's admission to the public that he has M.S. and concealed it from the public during the campaign.The season actually starts off with an episode entitled ""Isaac and Ishmael,"" a stand alone episode written in response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11.  Many people did not like the episode (although it has gained popularity) but I really enjoyed it.  After that, the season resumes where it left off in ""Two Cathedrals"" (the second season finale).  Ron Silver comes on as Bruno Gianelli, the campaign director for Bartlett's re-election.  There are some spectacular guest appearances throughout this season (besides Silver).  First is Mark Harmon, as a Secret Service Agent who is assigned to protect CJ Cregg after she receives several death threats.  Also, Hal Holbrooke is great as Assistant Secretary of State Ablie Duncan.Bartlett's opponent in the presidential race is Republican Governor Richie, a man with a President George W. Bush-type persona.  Besides having to overcome his lie about his medical condition, Bartlett must compete with a candidate who seems to be more like the ""average American"" and he must decide whether to try and take that path, or stick with being himself, an academic liberal from New England.All in all this is a great season, although perhaps not as consistent as the first two.

848456,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002WZN9Y,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[14, 20]","The third season of ""The West Wing"" actually gets off on the wrong note as far as I am concerned for the simple reason that if they President of the United States shows up for a monumentally important press conference half-wet and looking wild eyes, the country is going to think he has gone off the deep end.  Having MS would be the least of Jed Bartlet's problems at that point, but we are supposed to let the high drama of the moment be such that none of the members of the rabid White House press corps notice his dishevelment.The MS plot line ends up being problematic during the Third Season.  The idea is certainly interesting, especially in light of revelations and Kennedy's Addison's Disease and Reagan's Alzheimer that have raised questions as to what medical conditions would affect a president's competency.  But the story arc devolves into more of a general sense of getting anybody in the Bartlet Administration, where Charlie is going to get saddled with $100,000 in legal fees if he has done nothing wrong (""Manchester""), Donna commits perjury because she tries to protect her personal diary (""War Crimes""), and Leo's alcoholism becomes the cherry on the Republican's sundae (""Bartlet for America"").  In the end, Leo's problems become what ends the issue, with Bartlet's neglecting to tell anybody he had MS becoming a footnote (""H. Con-172"").In retrospect what might have been missing from this season was a Democratic challenger to Bartlet's nomination, simply because there are so many episodes dealing with meaningless primaries (e.g., ""Night Five,"" ""Hartsfield's Landing"") and a face is not put on Republican nominee Governor Ritchie of Florida until the final episode (""Posse Comitatus""), although Bartlet does put a shot across his bow (""The U.S. Poet Laureate"").  This is underscored by what ""The West Wing"" is doing its current season, bringing in Alan Alda and Jimmy Smits as eager beavers all ready making their moves on the White House.What ends up being the major plot line that extends beyond the third season is the problem of Qumar and its defense minister Abdul Shareef with his terrorist ties.  Qumar was in the background the entire season, with the Administration trying to get an airbase lease with a nation that perpetuates atrocities against its women (""The Women of Qumar"") and other problems, but when Bartlet gives the order to have Shareef assassinated in the big finale he sets in motion a chain of events that will result in Zoe being kidnapped and Bartlet handing over the presidency to the Republican Speaker of the House at the end of Season Four.  If there is one strength of the show in recent seasons it has been in dealing with the problems of the Middle East.  Whether this was because of, or despite, the attacks on September 11th is too hard to tell.  The special episode, ""Isaac and Ishmael,"" which ran before the first episode and after September 11th was notable because it touched on a wide spectrum of issues while sounding the necessary note of caution regarding leaping to the assumption that all Arab-Americans are terrorists.  I think it is also clear that the show's harder edge in terms of realpolitik stems from what happened in the real world right before the third season started.Favorite Moments from ""The West Wing: The Complete Third Season"": The President calling the Butterball Hot Line and C.J. dealing with ""The Indians in the Lobby.""  C.J. raising hell with Nancy McNally over ""The Women of Qumar.""  Sam contemplating the paragraph that was cut from the State of the Union Address in which they cured Cancer in ""100,000 Airplanes.""  Charlie winning the war of practical jokes with C.J. in ""Hartsfield's Landing.""  Donna, the temporary Canadian, forgetting that Abbey turned back into Mrs. Bartlet in ""Dead Irish Writers,"" and being told by the President that he cannot do a proclamation to honor her favorite teacher who is retiring in ""Stirred.""  Ron Butterfield getting C.J. to take the death threats she is receiving seriously in ""Enemies Foreign and Domestic.""  We lose Ainsley Hayes, but we do have Amy Gardner and Simon Donovan in recurring roles, and a touch of Debbie Fiderer to go along with my favorite, Admiral Fitzwallace.After the big start and shocking finish to the Second Season, which was arguably the best season of ""The West Wing,"" it is not surprising that the Third Season is something of a letdown, especially when you compare the first and final episodes from those two seasons (I think ""In the Shadow of Two Gunmen"" was the best ""West Wing"" episode ever).  But the thing I remember thinking (and saying) most often during that season was that while everybody was worried about the president's re-election bid as soon as Jed Bartlet gets on stage with an opponent in a nationally televised debate, it is not just ""Game On,"" but game over.

But it is still very good!In the aftermath of 9-11, real life events overtook and overshadowed even the fictional world of Pres Bartlet's White House. Aaron Sorkin addresses the 9-11 attacks with a special episode that, for all its flaws, highlighted the immediacy with which TWW could comment on a pressing issue.But when the series returned to its continuing story of the POTUS's health crisis and the ensuing investigation, TWW felt disconnected. It wasn't just a fictional world. It sometimes seemed like an absurdly fictional world.Nonetheless, I give Aaron Sorkin all the credit in the world for his efforts.

848489,A1VY2CG81I1JRR,B0002WZN9Y,SingingDesigner,"[0, 0]","I've been watching the series streamed on my Amazon Prime.  Having never seen the show prior to this stretch, and really not following the critical acclaim for the show, I'd really never felt inspired to tackle the series until after watching and enjoying &#34;The Newsroom&#34; by West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin.I'm sure that the one or two of you that happen to stumble on my review, and have bothered to continue to read it, are probably more familiar with the show than I was, and regardless of what I have to say, have or will watch it regardless.  All I can say is that it is a real kudos to NBC that they let the show be produced with such a magnificent standard of intelligence that one has to either be sharp as a tack to follow it live, or else they rewatch a recorded copy.  Nonetheless, it moves fast in it's dialog and presumes that folks will keep up.I'm currently now into Season 4.  I have no idea what's to come (other than I'd heard in advance about changes in the Presidents staff due to health and contractual issues with certain actors) but I'm thoroughly engaged in the action.  I'd also heard that Season 4 was the last for Mr. Sorkin; if the series noticeably suffers as a result, I may drop out of the series.For now, I will say that the acting and writing is absolutely terrific, the flow of the action works well, and (perhaps the greatest compliment) that the show's various stories not only arc from episodes and moments within the season, but even moments from earlier seasons.  Which means that, to follow certain story lines, you really need to watch the whole series.  I so admire that in a series.  It works on it's own terms, and expects it's audience to comply.For all of my heaps of praise, I will add that it's not perfect (thus 4 stars).  While NBC does deserve it's kudos, it remains a very idealized version of American politics.  So far anyway, it tackles some complexities but avoids others, such as the influence of money in politics and various matters of corruption.Also, President Bartlett and his staff seem like an immensely likeable and extraordinarily intelligent bunch, fast thinking and amazingly clever, it's a bit irritating that there's hardly any noticeable deviation from this characterization.  I know this is Sorkin (I see it on &#34;The Newsroom&#34; as well) but it still makes the show feel like a show... contrived.  I start with shows like &#34;The Sopranos&#34; and &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; as the 5-star bar, where the characters are much more complex and fully realized.  On West Wing, the characters are simply less believable as real people.So, to sum up, after 3-1/2 seasons, I'm really impressed with the groundbreaking standard of quality for West Wing as a network TV series, but for all of it's admirable qualities, it's not as great as some of the non-network TV shows I've seen.",4,West Wing review in general (Seasons 1-3),1360713600,"02 13, 2013",2013,2853,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'series', 'streamed', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'Having', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'prior', 'stretch', 'really', 'not', 'following', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'show', ""'d"", 'really', 'never', 'felt', 'inspired', 'tackle', 'series', 'watching', 'enjoying', '34', 'Newsroom', '34', 'West', 'Wing', 'creator', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'one', 'two', 'happen', 'stumble', 'review', 'have', 'bothered', 'continue', 'read', 'are', 'probably', 'more', 'familiar', 'show', 'was', 'regardless', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'have', 'will', 'watch', 'regardless', 'can', 'say', 'real', 'kudos', 'NBC', 'let', 'show', 'be', 'produced', 'magnificent', 'standard', 'intelligence', 'one', 'either', 'be', 'sharp', 'tack', 'follow', 'live', 'else', 'rewatch', 'recorded', 'copy', 'Nonetheless', 'fast', 'dialog', 'presumes', 'folks', 'will', 'keep', 'up.I', ""'m"", 'currently', 'now', 'Season', '4', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'come', 'other', ""'d"", 'heard', 'advance', 'changes', 'Presidents', 'staff', 'due', 'health', 'contractual', 'issues', 'certain', 'actors', ""'m"", 'thoroughly', 'engaged', 'action', ""'d"", 'also', 'heard', 'Season', '4', 'was', 'last', 'Mr.', 'Sorkin', 'series', 'noticeably', 'result', 'may', 'drop', 'series.For', 'now', 'will', 'say', 'acting', 'writing', 'absolutely', 'terrific', 'flow', 'action', 'well', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'compliment', 'show', 'various', 'stories', 'not', 'only', 'arc', 'episodes', 'moments', 'season', 'even', 'moments', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Which', 'follow', 'certain', 'story', 'lines', 'really', 'need', 'watch', 'whole', 'series', 'so', 'admire', 'series', 'own', 'terms', 'audience', 'comply.For', 'heaps', 'praise', 'will', 'add', 'not', 'perfect', 'thus', '4', 'stars', 'NBC', 'deserve', 'kudos', 'very', 'idealized', 'version', 'American', 'politics', 'So', 'far', 'anyway', 'complexities', 'avoids', 'others', 'such', 'influence', 'money', 'politics', 'various', 'matters', 'corruption.Also', 'President', 'Bartlett', 'staff', 'seem', 'immensely', 'likeable', 'extraordinarily', 'intelligent', 'bunch', 'fast', 'thinking', 'amazingly', 'clever', 'bit', 'irritating', 'hardly', 'noticeable', 'deviation', 'characterization', 'know', 'Sorkin', 'see', '34', 'Newsroom', '34', 'as', 'well', 'still', 'show', 'feel', 'show', 'contrived', 'start', 'shows', '34', 'Sopranos', '34', '34', 'Breaking', 'Bad', '34', '5-star', 'bar', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'fully', 'realized', 'West', 'Wing', 'characters', 'are', 'simply', 'less', 'believable', 'real', 'people.So', 'sum', 'up', '3-1/2', 'seasons', ""'m"", 'really', 'impressed', 'groundbreaking', 'standard', 'quality', 'West', 'Wing', 'network', 'TV', 'series', 'admirable', 'qualities', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'non-network', 'TV', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'seen']",WEST WING: S3 (DVD)

848492,A3UD9EUWL78R8X,B0002WZN9Y,Spikewriter,"[22, 27]","It is not surprising that incidents of September 11, 2001 would resonate through the Bartlett White House.  For all the intention that the show stand outside real-life political events, it is fueled by them and Sorkin's personal anger and anguish comes through in more than one episode, sparking an arc that finds the President walking down a very dark road potentially even more damaging and devestating than the revelation of his MS in season two.To get the bad out of the way: ""The Women of Qumar"" is possibly the most heavy-handed episode of Sorkin's tenure on the series, and one that I find I cannot rewatch.  (Really.  We will change to reruns of ""Home Improvement"" at my house rather than watch this one.)  It is a moment when the show loses focus and becomes a political polemic rather than a sharply written and intelligent piece of drama that rises far above the average.Back to the good, which far outweighs the bad.  We start with ""Manchester"" which kicks off Bartlett's re-election campaign as they struggle with the aftermath of the MS revelation.  ""Gone Quiet"" has the President and Joint Chiefs waiting to hear from a sub that may be lost in hostile waters, while  ""Indians in the Lobby"" and ""Bartlett for America"" which follow in the show's tradition of holiday episodes that are far from gooey pieces of fluff.  Lord John Marbury returns in ""Dead Irish Writers"" just as Abby pays the price for her part in the coverup (and only Donna could lose and regain her American citizenship in a single night).  The season finally culminates in the stalking of CJ and the finale ""Posse Comitatus,"" where Bartlett comes face to face with his opponent in the election for the first time.  Sorkin once gives us television that asks us to think and pay attention and sounds a call against simple complacency.While the show I love may have outstayed its welcome on network television, we will still have this as an example of what television can be if the audience (and networks) are willing to not play it safe.",5,The Last Really Good Season,1093564800,"08 27, 2004",2004,2016,"['not', 'surprising', 'incidents', 'September', '11', '2001', 'would', 'resonate', 'Bartlett', 'White', 'House', 'intention', 'show', 'stand', 'outside', 'real-life', 'political', 'events', 'fueled', 'Sorkin', 'personal', 'anger', 'anguish', 'more', 'one', 'episode', 'sparking', 'arc', 'President', 'walking', 'down', 'very', 'dark', 'road', 'potentially', 'even', 'more', 'damaging', 'devestating', 'revelation', 'MS', 'season', 'two.To', 'get', 'bad', 'way', 'Women', 'Qumar', 'possibly', 'most', 'heavy-handed', 'episode', 'Sorkin', 'tenure', 'series', 'one', 'find', 'can', 'not', 'rewatch', 'Really', 'will', 'change', 'reruns', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'house', 'rather', 'watch', 'one', 'moment', 'when', 'show', 'focus', 'political', 'polemic', 'rather', 'sharply', 'written', 'intelligent', 'piece', 'drama', 'far', 'average.Back', 'good', 'far', 'bad', 'start', 'Manchester', 'off', 'Bartlett', 're-election', 'campaign', 'struggle', 'aftermath', 'MS', 'revelation', 'Gone', 'Quiet', 'President', 'Joint', 'Chiefs', 'waiting', 'hear', 'sub', 'may', 'be', 'lost', 'hostile', 'waters', 'Indians', 'Lobby', 'Bartlett', 'America', 'follow', 'show', 'tradition', 'holiday', 'episodes', 'are', 'far', 'gooey', 'pieces', 'fluff', 'Lord', 'John', 'Marbury', 'returns', 'Dead', 'Irish', 'Writers', 'just', 'Abby', 'price', 'part', 'coverup', 'only', 'Donna', 'could', 'lose', 'regain', 'American', 'citizenship', 'single', 'night', 'season', 'finally', 'stalking', 'CJ', 'finale', 'Posse', 'Comitatus', 'where', 'Bartlett', 'face', 'face', 'opponent', 'election', 'first', 'time', 'Sorkin', 'once', 'television', 'think', 'pay', 'attention', 'call', 'simple', 'complacency.While', 'show', 'love', 'may', 'have', 'outstayed', 'welcome', 'network', 'television', 'will', 'still', 'have', 'example', 'what', 'television', 'can', 'be', 'audience', 'networks', 'are', 'willing', 'not', 'play', 'safe']",WEST WING: S3 (DVD)

I think the 3rd season may be the best - starting with Isaac and Ishamel raising important questions about fear and presumption of guilt, and ending with posse comitatus with shrief is killed as is mark harmon's agent simon donovan in the boot-shaker of an episode. This is followed by the bonus of episode of the delightful west wing special.

The extremist murder people, destroy property, preach hate,continuously, to perpetuate their beliefs.
