842503,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0002OXUTM,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[0, 0]","Doug Stanhope is not only a great stand-up comic, but one with a rare characteristic of great stand-up comics: he's still alive. Stanhope doesn't often grace lists of great stand-up comedians simply because (and he'll be the first to admit) his act is not for everybody. It's not that his technique, persona, or delivery is any different from more celebrated comedians; it's his material. Stanhope is fearless, giving controversial opinions on any controversial subjects. If you're looking for political correctness, go elsewhere. This is, after all, a man who published a book entitledFun With Pedophiles: The Best of Baiting. His material is not for the easily offended.While I wouldn't label Stanhope ""underground,"" he's not exactly ""mainstream."" Most stand-up performances are performed in theaters; on a stage, in front of a couple thousand people. Deadbeat Hero, released in 2004, was shot in black & white in a small club in front of a small group of people. Even his 2007 special (arguably his most well-known),No Refunds, which premiered on Showtime and can be streamed on Netflix, shows him in a small venue in front of a small crowd. Dressed like he just rolled out of bed, Stanhope chain-smokes and drinks throughout both performances. In this one, Stanhope riffs on cops, Siamese twins, abortion, the idea of liberty and freedom in America, babies, and supporting the troops, among other things. These topics are nothing new to the avid stand-up fan, but Stanhope brings a refreshing unique and refreshingly offensive take to all of them. When discussing a woman who complained about him being drunk at a previous show, Stanhope muses ""why does it matter? I'm not driving a school bus. I'm a comic. It's like getting a lap dance and complaining your stripper is a Communist.""There's nothing fake about Stanhope's persona. Even when he tells the craziest story, you have no doubt that it actually happened to him. It's not remarkable that Stanhope is genuinely funny. What's remarkable is that beneath these stuttering, drunken ramblings he's not just hilarious and provocative, but insightful. Hearing genuine insight come from the mouths of George Carlin and Bill Hicks wasn't too surprising, but you wouldn't immediately guess that underneath Stanhope's hard-living lifestyle and physical appearance lurks a keen intelligence. This intelligence (the second most important component of comedy, besides...comedy) coupled with his inability to hold back the most provocative topics make him a comedic force to be reckoned with.Deadbeat Hero is certainly low-budget and less technically impressive than the average stand-up gig, but how technically stunning does a video of a man speaking need to be? In 75 minutes, there's not a dull moment. I have seen two of his specials and his twenty-minute segment on ""Comedy Central Presents,"" but I eagerly anticipate what else he has in store. For all I know, Deadbeat Hero may not be his magnum opus, but it's certainly a worthwhile introduction to his style and material. While it may take time for you to completely warm to him, I believe Doug Stanhope may be the most undervalued, unique comic working today.",4,Intelligent and Insightful - Not for the Easily Offended,1329955200,"02 23, 2012",2012,3166,"['Doug', 'Stanhope', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'stand-up', 'comic', 'one', 'rare', 'characteristic', 'great', 'stand-up', 'comics', 'still', 'alive', 'Stanhope', ""n't"", 'often', 'grace', 'lists', 'great', 'stand-up', 'comedians', 'simply', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'act', 'not', 'everybody', 'not', 'technique', 'persona', 'delivery', 'different', 'more', 'celebrated', 'comedians', 'material', 'Stanhope', 'fearless', 'giving', 'controversial', 'opinions', 'controversial', 'subjects', ""'re"", 'looking', 'political', 'correctness', 'go', 'elsewhere', 'man', 'who', 'published', 'book', 'entitledFun', 'Pedophiles', 'Best', 'Baiting', 'material', 'not', 'easily', 'would', ""n't"", 'label', 'Stanhope', 'underground', 'not', 'exactly', 'mainstream', 'Most', 'stand-up', 'performances', 'are', 'performed', 'theaters', 'stage', 'front', 'couple', 'thousand', 'people', 'Deadbeat', 'Hero', 'released', '2004', 'was', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'small', 'club', 'front', 'small', 'group', 'people', 'Even', '2007', 'special', 'arguably', 'most', 'well-known', 'No', 'Refunds', 'premiered', 'Showtime', 'can', 'be', 'streamed', 'Netflix', 'small', 'venue', 'front', 'small', 'crowd', 'Dressed', 'just', 'rolled', 'bed', 'Stanhope', 'chain-smokes', 'drinks', 'performances', 'one', 'Stanhope', 'cops', 'Siamese', 'twins', 'abortion', 'idea', 'liberty', 'freedom', 'America', 'babies', 'supporting', 'troops', 'other', 'things', 'topics', 'are', 'nothing', 'new', 'avid', 'stand-up', 'fan', 'Stanhope', 'refreshing', 'unique', 'refreshingly', 'offensive', 'take', 'When', 'discussing', 'woman', 'who', 'complained', 'being', 'drunk', 'previous', 'show', 'Stanhope', 'why', 'matter', ""'m"", 'not', 'driving', 'school', 'bus', ""'m"", 'comic', 'getting', 'lap', 'dance', 'complaining', 'stripper', 'Communist', 'nothing', 'fake', 'Stanhope', 'persona', 'Even', 'when', 'craziest', 'story', 'have', 'doubt', 'actually', 'happened', 'not', 'remarkable', 'Stanhope', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'What', 'remarkable', 'stuttering', 'drunken', 'ramblings', 'not', 'just', 'hilarious', 'provocative', 'insightful', 'Hearing', 'genuine', 'insight', 'come', 'mouths', 'George', 'Carlin', 'Bill', 'Hicks', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'surprising', 'would', ""n't"", 'immediately', 'guess', 'underneath', 'Stanhope', 'hard-living', 'lifestyle', 'physical', 'appearance', 'keen', 'intelligence', 'intelligence', 'second', 'most', 'important', 'component', 'comedy', 'besides', 'comedy', 'coupled', 'inability', 'hold', 'back', 'most', 'provocative', 'topics', 'make', 'comedic', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'with.Deadbeat', 'Hero', 'certainly', 'low-budget', 'less', 'technically', 'impressive', 'average', 'stand-up', 'gig', 'how', 'technically', 'stunning', 'video', 'man', 'speaking', 'need', 'be', '75', 'minutes', 'not', 'dull', 'moment', 'have', 'seen', 'two', 'specials', 'twenty-minute', 'segment', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'Presents', 'eagerly', 'anticipate', 'what', 'else', 'store', 'know', 'Deadbeat', 'Hero', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'magnum', 'opus', 'certainly', 'worthwhile', 'introduction', 'style', 'material', 'may', 'take', 'time', 'completely', 'warm', 'believe', 'Doug', 'Stanhope', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'undervalued', 'unique', 'comic', 'working', 'today']",Doug Stanhope - Deadbeat Hero

That's how I felt until I actually heard his material. Stanhope is one of the best working comics today. His material is very well thought-out and perfectly delivered. He works blue, period. With that said, this DVD or any of his CDs are not for the easily offended.I like how this release is very stripped down and it feels like you are in the smoky and cramped comedy club. It's shot in black and white which further adds to the documentary type of feel it has. His performance is just incredible. You soon realize you're watching a veteran professional comic in his element and completely comfortable on stage. His material is hilarious as well as varied. On one end of the spectrum he can do [...] jokes but on the polar opposite end, he speaks philosophically.As his set progresses, and as he gets more intoxicated, it's similar to watching a performance art piece. His delivery almost becomes stream of consciousness and he riffs mercilessly on the government, the war, human relations and everything in between.If you appreciate stand-up as an artform, this is mandatory viewing.
