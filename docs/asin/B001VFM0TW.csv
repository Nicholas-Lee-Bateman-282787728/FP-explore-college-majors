I love Peanuts a lot and I also think the TV shows are great too but I don't really care for the ones in the 1960s. Let me explain.First in A Charlie Brown Christmas the first special that they did, it was OK but I do feel bad for Charlie Brown. Also I have it on DVD so I don't really want to get it again but it is a classic but I would give it a B+. Then in Charlie Brown All Stars it was OK but again I feel bad for Charlie Brown. I would give this a B+. Then there's It's The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, I do like it but I already have it on DVD. I would give this a A-.Then there's You're in Love, Charlie Brown, it was OK but again I feel bad for Charlie Brown I mean everyone laughed at him at he got in trouble on the last day of school. I would give this a B+. In He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown, Snoopy was not that nice to Peppermint Patty and later she's mean to him. At first I think he deserves it but than I feel sorry for him. I would give this a C-.Lastly in It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown, I was upset that it did not have a good ending. Also in the show we can see Violet, Patty, Fredia, and Shermy when they were pretty much out of the comic strip at that time. I would give this a C-.I do think that the 1970s specials were much better. But I would still say for Peanuts fans if you don't mind all this stuff then get the DVD. I don't care if anyone finds this review helpful or not I just had to say what was on my mind.",3,Don't judge me,1248652800,"07 27, 2009",2009,1542,"['Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'saying', 'even', 'hate', 'saying', 'be', 'said', 'love', 'lot', 'also', 'think', 'TV', 'shows', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'ones', '1960s', 'Let', 'explain.First', 'A', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Christmas', 'first', 'special', 'did', 'was', 'OK', 'do', 'feel', 'bad', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Also', 'have', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'get', 'again', 'classic', 'would', 'give', 'B+', 'Then', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'All', 'was', 'OK', 'again', 'feel', 'bad', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'would', 'give', 'B+', 'Then', 'Great', 'Pumpkin', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'do', 'already', 'have', 'DVD', 'would', 'give', 'A-.Then', ""'re"", 'Love', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'was', 'OK', 'again', 'feel', 'bad', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'mean', 'everyone', 'laughed', 'got', 'trouble', 'last', 'day', 'school', 'would', 'give', 'B+', 'Your', 'Dog', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Snoopy', 'was', 'not', 'nice', 'Peppermint', 'Patty', 'later', 'mean', 'first', 'think', 'feel', 'sorry', 'would', 'give', 'C-.Lastly', 'Was', 'Short', 'Summer', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'was', 'upset', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'good', 'ending', 'Also', 'show', 'can', 'see', 'Violet', 'Patty', 'Fredia', 'Shermy', 'when', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'comic', 'strip', 'time', 'would', 'give', 'C-.I', 'do', 'think', '1970s', 'specials', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'would', 'still', 'say', 'Peanuts', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'stuff', 'then', 'get', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'anyone', 'review', 'helpful', 'not', 'just', 'had', 'say', 'what', 'was', 'mind']",Peanuts 1960's Collection (A Charlie Brown Christmas / Charlie Brown's All-Stars / It's the Great Pumpkin / You're in Love / He's Your Dog / It Was a Short Summer)
1243518,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B001VFM0TW,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[6, 7]","Even though I have thePeanuts Holiday Collection (It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown / A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving / A Charlie Brown Christmas) (Deluxe Edition), I decided to buy the PEANUTS 1960'S COLLECTION 2-DVD SET for the other four episodes.I've never seen ""Charlie Brown's All-Stars,"" ""You're In Love, CB,"" ""He's Your Dog, CB,"" and ""It Was A Short Summer, CB,"" and this set was cheap enough that I figured why not?Of course the two main holiday specials from the 60s, ""A CB Christmas"" and ""It's The Great Pumpkin, CB,"" are also included in this set but does NOT have the special features from the deluxe holiday release.Since I grew up on Peanuts specials this was a must have for me. I enjoyed the other cartoons just as much as the holiday specials and this adds to my collection.Other reviewers have already listed an episode guide so I won't do that. I'll just say that if you're trying to decide if this set is worth it, especially if you already have the deluxe holiday set like me, I'd say it is if you love Charlie Brown and the rest of the Peanuts gang. Peppermint Patty is featured in two episodes and the story revolves around Snoopy on ""He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown,"" so you get a good mix.===================  SPECIAL FEATURES  =========================**36:55-minute FEATURETTE ""THE MAESTRO OF MENLO PARK""Lee Mendelson (Exec. Prod for ""Peanuts""), Seward McCain (Bassist w/Guaraldi), David Guaraldi (Vince's son), and others discuss jazz maestro Vince Guaraldi--showing old photographs and playing samples of songs like ""Linus & Lucy,"" ""Christmas Time Is Here,"" ""Joe Cool's Blues,"" and ""Little Birdie""--explaining how he was chosen to supply the music for Peanuts and how iconic the music would become.=====================================================================There's something very special about Charlie Brown and Peanuts. Perhaps it's the touching story lines, simple drawings, and jazz music that create that magic. Or maybe it's because we all have a little Charlie Brown in us and that's why we still find these cartoons endearing. Whatever the reason, I  suggest buying this set, even though you'll be double dipping if you already have the holiday set, because it will bring a smile to your face and you get the other four episodes plus the Guaraldi special.The set comes in a clamshell case that holds the two DVDs but there's a mistake on the episode listing (all least on my set): the ""You're In Love, CB"" is listed on the cover sheet as being episode number 4 on DVD 1, but it starts off DVD 2.",5,*Double-Dipping* But You Get 4 Other Shows...,1248825600,"07 29, 2009",2009,2540,"['Even', 'have', 'thePeanuts', 'Holiday', 'Collection', 'Great', 'Pumpkin', 'Charlie', 'Brown', '/', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Thanksgiving', 'A', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Christmas', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'decided', 'buy', 'PEANUTS', '1960', 'COLLECTION', '2-DVD', 'SET', 'other', 'four', 'episodes.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'All-Stars', ""'re"", 'Love', 'CB', 'Your', 'Dog', 'CB', 'Was', 'A', 'Short', 'Summer', 'CB', 'set', 'was', 'cheap', 'enough', 'figured', 'why', 'not', 'course', 'two', 'main', 'holiday', 'specials', '60s', 'CB', 'Christmas', 'Great', 'Pumpkin', 'CB', 'are', 'also', 'included', 'set', 'NOT', 'have', 'special', 'features', 'deluxe', 'holiday', 'release.Since', 'grew', 'up', 'Peanuts', 'specials', 'was', 'must', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'cartoons', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'holiday', 'specials', 'collection.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'listed', 'episode', 'guide', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', ""'re"", 'trying', 'decide', 'set', 'especially', 'already', 'have', 'deluxe', 'holiday', 'set', ""'d"", 'say', 'love', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'rest', 'Peanuts', 'gang', 'Peppermint', 'Patty', 'featured', 'two', 'episodes', 'story', 'around', 'Snoopy', 'Your', 'Dog', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'get', 'good', 'mix.===================', 'SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', '=========================**36:55-minute', 'FEATURETTE', 'THE', 'MAESTRO', 'OF', 'MENLO', 'PARK', 'Lee', 'Mendelson', 'Exec', 'Prod', 'Peanuts', 'Seward', 'McCain', 'Bassist', 'w/Guaraldi', 'David', 'Guaraldi', 'Vince', 'son', 'others', 'discuss', 'jazz', 'maestro', 'Vince', 'Guaraldi', 'showing', 'old', 'photographs', 'playing', 'samples', 'songs', 'Linus', 'Lucy', 'Christmas', 'Time', 'Here', 'Joe', 'Cool', 'Blues', 'Little', 'Birdie', 'explaining', 'how', 'was', 'chosen', 'supply', 'music', 'Peanuts', 'how', 'iconic', 'music', 'would', 'become.=====================================================================There', 'something', 'very', 'special', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Peanuts', 'Perhaps', 'touching', 'story', 'lines', 'simple', 'drawings', 'jazz', 'music', 'create', 'magic', 'have', 'little', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'why', 'still', 'find', 'cartoons', 'endearing', 'reason', 'suggest', 'buying', 'set', 'even', ""'ll"", 'be', 'double', 'dipping', 'already', 'have', 'holiday', 'set', 'will', 'bring', 'smile', 'face', 'get', 'other', 'four', 'episodes', 'Guaraldi', 'special.The', 'set', 'clamshell', 'case', 'two', 'DVDs', 'mistake', 'episode', 'listing', 'least', 'set', ""'re"", 'Love', 'CB', 'listed', 'cover', 'sheet', 'being', 'episode', 'number', '4', 'DVD', '1', 'DVD', '2']",Peanuts 1960's Collection (A Charlie Brown Christmas / Charlie Brown's All-Stars / It's the Great Pumpkin / You're in Love / He's Your Dog / It Was a Short Summer)
1243519,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B001VFM0TW,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[1, 1]","Peanuts fans over the age of 42 or ""Schulzologists"" in general so will really enjoy this! While everyone is familar with a ""CB Christmas"" and the ""great Pumpkin"" episodes, some really rare stuff is included here.I don't believe that ""It Was a Short Summer, CB,"" (1969), ""He's Your Dog, CB,"" (1968), ""You're In Love, CB,"" (1967), or ""CB's All Stars"" (1966) have been shown any more than twice since their original appearances. In order, these deal with our gang going to summer camp, prodded by Lucy. The arm rasslin' match between Lucy and Snoopy is a hoot. ""He's Your Dog"" is the direct predecessor for the gang's second feature ""Snoopy Come Home"" (1972) and has a very direct reference to the latter film. Here, Snoopy's obnoxious and unwanted clowing with the other kids gets him a bid at obedience school at the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm. Mildly amusing (I liked it better when I saw it as a small child when it first came out), but it's still above much of the other fare of this era.""You're in Love,"" is really sweet, one of the few times CB comes out ahead? How? Watch it and you'll see. I wonder why this has seldom been aired since it's first broadcast (I recall seeing it around 1972 when I was in the first grade). ""CB's All Stars"" is an interesting tale that mixes baseball humor with a touching example of CB's loyalty to his ""friends"" in spite of their ingratitude. The ending of this is truly touching as well as amusing and says a lot about Linus' true loyalty to CB.The special feature is a documentary on Vince Guiraldi, the tunesmith behind the wonderful musical themes of these specials. Quite interesting. he appears to have had the perfect personality to do this wonderful music (I had no idea that it was him singing the ""Joe Cool"" song from ""You're Not Elected CB"" in 1972). It would be nice, given the fact that this IS about Peanuts in the 60s, if this were to include the Peanuts Ford commercials from earlier in the decade and the early aminated segments from the unsold 1963 documentary ""A Boy named Charlie Brown"" (not to be confused with the 1969 feature film of the same name). Such is the life of a certified member of the CGA (Cartoon Geeks of America).

To coax him out of his holiday blues, Lucy suggests he direct the school's Christmas pageant and decorate a glorious tree. Charlie Brown concedes. The tree he finds however, is puny, prompting everyone to ridicule him.Charlie Brown's All-Stars (1966) - Nominated for two Prime Time Emmys, in this delightful special, Charlie Brown is faced with a difficult moral dilemma; should he accept brand new uniforms and give the rest of the gang a chance to be part of an official little league baseball team even if it means that due to policy, Snoopy, Lucy, Patty, Violet and Frieda must be kicked off?It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (1966) - This Emmy Award-nominated special, finds the Peanuts gang outfitted in costumes, ready for trick or treating and crashing Violet's Halloween party. Charlie Brown is in a ghost costume (with more eyeholes cut out than needed), Lucy dressed as a witch and Snoopy in a World War I flying ace costume. Linus decides to steadfastly hold vigil in the pumpkin patch as he awaits the Great Pumpkin.You're in Love, Charlie Brown (1967) - This Emmy Award-nominated special finds Charlie Brown trying to work up the courage to meet his school-girl crush, the little red-haired girl. He enlists the help of his pals Linus and Peppermint Patty but they only aggravate the situation.He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown (1968) - This Emmy Award-nominated special finds Snoopy returning to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm for a refresher course in obedience training after his mischievous behavior lands Charlie Brown in trouble.

1243522,A1M181I8IYDLDA,B001VFM0TW,Brandon Cozart,"[5, 5]","Some things, though they become dated and quaint, still remain classic and timeless.  Charles Schultz's Peanuts TV specials are no exception to this.  Every year I look forward to one of the major television networks airing the Peanuts holiday specials, especially A Charlie Brown Christmas and It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.Recently, Warner Brothers has released a remastered collection of the 1960's specials on a two-disc set.  This set contains six half-hour specials, each disc containing three (although the box erroneously indicates that there are four on the first disc and two on the second disc).  Also included in this set is a featurette profiling the composer of the Peanuts music, including the famed ""Linus and Lucy"" track, Vince Guaraldi.The specials are included in chronological order, and the last two have never before been released on DVD.  Here are the specials included:A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965)The classic, beloved story of the Peanuts gang's Christmas pageant and Charlie Brown's quest to rediscover the true meaning of Christmas.Charlie Brown's All-Stars (1966)Charlie Brown and his hapless baseball team can't catch a break on the diamond.  Ever the shrewd manager, Charlie Brown believes new uniforms and entry into a real league will provide the inspiration his team needs to get over the hump.  However, there's a catch:  he must get rid of the girls on the team, as well as Snoopy.  How will he handle such a conundrum?It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (1966)Another beloved Peanuts holiday special.  This time it's Halloween and time for the gang to go trick-or-treating.  The dumb luck of Charlie Brown, however, will bring him more tricks than treats.  Meanwhile, Linus patiently awaits the arrival of the Great Pumpkin, a lesser-known holiday gift-bringer.You're in Love, Charlie Brown (1967)It's the end of the school year and Charlie Brown is distressed about not being able to have fun like the rest of his friends.  After complaining and venting to Linus, Charlie Brown realizes that his frustrations are due to his as-yet unrequited affections for The Little Red-Haired Girl, and it becomes his quest to talk to her (interesting sidenote, this is the first Peanuts special to feature the ""trombone voice"" of the schoolteacher).He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown (1968)The gang has become frustrated with Snoopy and his disobedient way, so Charlie Brown decides to send him back to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm for obedience training.  With Snoopy, however, nothing ever goes as planned.It was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown (1969)The Peanuts kids all go to summer camp, but the boys have a rough time.  Unfavorable conditions and repeated losses to the girls in sports get them down, but everything could change based on the outcome of the wrist-wrestling match between Lucy and Snoopy ""The Masked Marvel.""Since the 1960's there have been dozens of additional Peanuts TV specials, but there's something about these first few that keep us coming back to them time and time again.

Comparing those LD editions to washed-out looking VHS they are highly superior visually and sonically with vivid color and a rock-stable picture... probably produced from the original negatives, as opposed to some old 16mm prints or video format. Seeing they had done this work for Laserdisc, Paramount probably took the same LD masters to make their DVDs so remember this was early 90's technology and good as it was, when Warners obtained the licensing rights, well, you might imagine that film/video technology has come a long way in nearly 15 years! Personally, I like my older LD's and Paramount DVDs and wont be replacing them all with the Warners product. But I would like to see titles that Paramount did not release be put on digital disc.I would still buy this set however just to get ""All-Stars"" in high quality as it has only been released on VHS and the old RCA/CED format except for this DVD set. Warners should release All-Stars as a separate disc grouped with some of the other specials but I don't imagine they will do this. I have all the Peanuts Paramount Laserdiscs which include many of the Charlie Brown/Snoopy Shows and the This is America series so if you still own a Laserdisc you might try to locate some of these discs. Its a Nightmare, Charlie Brown and It's a Circus were released on the CED (Capacitance Electronic Disc) format in the 80's.

This is where the Peanuts Specials all began.Charlie Brown's All-Stars (1966)It's ball season and Charlie Brown faces a moral dilemma when he can get his team new uniforms and a shot at being part of an official league if he is willing to kick Lucy, Violet, Patty, Frieda and Snoopy off the team.It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (1966)Another perennial classic about poor Charlie Brown getting more trick's than treat's and ever optimistic Linus spending the night in a humble pumpkin patch. He believes in the Great Pumpkin.You're In Love, Charlie Brown (1967)Charlie Brown just wants the courage to meet his crush, the little red haired girl. When Linus and Peppermint Patty try to help things only get worse for good old Chuck.He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown (1968)Snoopy is supposed to return to Daisy Hill Puppy Farm for obedience training but winds up at the house of Peppermint Patty instead. Will Charlie Brown get his dog pal to come back home?It Was A Short Summer Charlie Brown (1969)At summer camp the boys are losing everything to the girls and putting up with poor conditions. Will the boys be able to prove themselves as winner's before the end of the summer? Maybe some help from the Masked Marvel (aka Snoopy) can do the trick.Five of these six specials were either Emmy nominated or winning. Here they are being presented with remastered picture and sound quality, and on top of that the last two specials have never appeared on DVD before this. The set also includes a documentary, ""The Maestro of Menlo Park - Profiling Composer Vince Gauraldi"", which takes time to look at the life of the jazz musician who wrote the classic 'Linus and Lucy' Theme as well as other peanuts music.There have now been forty-one specials in the Peanuts franchise and I'm hoping that they will work on releasing them all in these sort of chronological sets. This set is great for those who haven't bought the other Peanuts releases yet or fans that don't mind double dipping knowing that this time if these releases continue they will be in for a complete set.All these specials are great for those looking to relive childhood memories or share wholesome entertainment with their children while teaching them core values. I understand television has to evolve to reflect the current times but I wish more current shows could show half the moral undertones found here in these specials. Luckily with this DVD set those interested in wholesome family entertainment can now share these six classic specials with their children.",5,A Review From The Peanut Gallery,1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,2900,"['2-disc', 'set', 'going', 'be', 'released', 'July', '7th', '2009', 'classic', 'heartwarming', 'Charlie', 'Brown/Peanuts', 'Specials', 'aired', '1965-1969', 'are', 'six', 'specials', 'aired', 'sixties', 'specials', 'are', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Christmas', '1965', 'perennial', 'Christmas', 'classic', 'down', 'luck', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'adorably', 'pathetic', 'Christmas', 'Tree', 'where', 'Peanuts', 'Specials', 'began.Charlie', 'Brown', 'All-Stars', '1966', 'ball', 'season', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'when', 'can', 'get', 'team', 'new', 'uniforms', 'shot', 'being', 'part', 'official', 'league', 'willing', 'kick', 'Lucy', 'Violet', 'Patty', 'Frieda', 'Snoopy', 'team.It', 'Great', 'Pumpkin', 'Charlie', 'Brown', '1966', 'perennial', 'classic', 'poor', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'getting', 'more', 'trick', 'treat', 'ever', 'optimistic', 'Linus', 'spending', 'night', 'humble', 'pumpkin', 'patch', 'Great', 'Pumpkin.You', ""'re"", 'Love', 'Charlie', 'Brown', '1967', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'just', 'courage', 'meet', 'crush', 'little', 'red', 'haired', 'girl', 'When', 'Linus', 'Peppermint', 'Patty', 'try', 'help', 'things', 'only', 'get', 'worse', 'good', 'old', 'Chuck.He', 'Your', 'Dog', 'Charlie', 'Brown', '1968', 'Snoopy', 'supposed', 'return', 'Daisy', 'Hill', 'Puppy', 'Farm', 'obedience', 'training', 'up', 'house', 'Peppermint', 'Patty', 'instead', 'Will', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'get', 'dog', 'pal', 'come', 'back', 'home', 'Was', 'A', 'Short', 'Summer', 'Charlie', 'Brown', '1969', 'summer', 'camp', 'boys', 'are', 'losing', 'everything', 'girls', 'putting', 'up', 'poor', 'conditions', 'Will', 'boys', 'be', 'able', 'prove', 'winner', 'end', 'summer', 'Maybe', 'help', 'Masked', 'Marvel', 'Snoopy', 'can', 'do', 'trick.Five', 'six', 'specials', 'were', 'either', 'Emmy', 'nominated', 'winning', 'Here', 'are', 'being', 'presented', 'remastered', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'top', 'last', 'two', 'specials', 'have', 'never', 'appeared', 'DVD', 'set', 'also', 'documentary', 'Maestro', 'Menlo', 'Park', 'Profiling', 'Composer', 'Vince', 'Gauraldi', 'time', 'look', 'life', 'jazz', 'musician', 'who', 'wrote', 'classic', ""'Linus"", 'Lucy', 'Theme', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'peanuts', 'music.There', 'have', 'now', 'been', 'forty-one', 'specials', 'Peanuts', 'franchise', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'will', 'work', 'releasing', 'sort', 'chronological', 'sets', 'set', 'great', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'bought', 'other', 'Peanuts', 'yet', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'double', 'dipping', 'knowing', 'time', 'releases', 'continue', 'will', 'be', 'complete', 'set.All', 'specials', 'are', 'great', 'looking', 'relive', 'childhood', 'memories', 'share', 'wholesome', 'entertainment', 'children', 'teaching', 'core', 'values', 'understand', 'television', 'evolve', 'reflect', 'current', 'times', 'wish', 'more', 'current', 'shows', 'could', 'show', 'moral', 'undertones', 'found', 'here', 'specials', 'Luckily', 'DVD', 'set', 'interested', 'wholesome', 'family', 'entertainment', 'can', 'now', 'share', 'six', 'classic', 'specials', 'children']",Peanuts 1960's Collection (A Charlie Brown Christmas / Charlie Brown's All-Stars / It's the Great Pumpkin / You're in Love / He's Your Dog / It Was a Short Summer)

1243547,AUV0EFKWA46TX,B001VFM0TW,shaxper,"[16, 25]","For years now, loyal fans of the Peanuts have been waiting for a definitive collection containing the entire library of peanuts animated specials.  Unfortunately, these new Peanuts decade collections aren't it.  While the Peanuts: 1960's Collection contains the first five Peanuts specials in chronological order, it leaves out the sixth, ""A Boy Named Charlies Brown,"" which was released in 1969.  It turns out that, When Warner Bros. purchased the rights to produce these Peanuts specials on DVD, they did not acquire the rights to the Peanuts animated specials that were released in theaters, including ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown,"" ""Snoopy, Come Home,"" ""Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown,"" and ""Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown.""  As a result, you won't see any of those classics in these volumes.  True fans of the Peanuts, buying many of these specials for the second or third time, are no doubt expecting the COMPLETE Peanuts collection, but that's not what they're getting here.On top of this, the special features in this volume are a sincere disappointment.  The documentary about Vince Guaraldi is informative and comprehensive (though not particularly interesting), but that's all we get other than a trailer about the history of Warner Bros. which (I learned too late) is NOT kid friendly and in no way relates to the Peanuts.  In contrast, we recently bought ""Snoopy's Reunion"" on DVD and were wowed by the touching and fascinating retrospective about the voice talents for the Peanuts over the years.  Where is that kind of documentary in this set?All in all, this collection is incomplete, both in terms of features and additional content.  It's clear that Warner Home Video can do much better, and they probably will.  I'm sure there will be a new and better complete set (whether produced by Warner or Paramount) released once we've spent all our money on these ones.",3,"Where's ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown?""",1265500800,"02 7, 2010",2010,1876,"['years', 'now', 'loyal', 'fans', 'Peanuts', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'definitive', 'collection', 'containing', 'entire', 'library', 'peanuts', 'animated', 'specials', 'Unfortunately', 'new', 'Peanuts', 'decade', 'collections', 'are', ""n't"", 'Peanuts', '1960', 'Collection', 'first', 'five', 'Peanuts', 'specials', 'chronological', 'order', 'out', 'sixth', 'Boy', 'Named', 'Charlies', 'Brown', 'was', 'released', '1969', 'out', 'When', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'purchased', 'rights', 'produce', 'Peanuts', 'specials', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'acquire', 'rights', 'Peanuts', 'animated', 'specials', 'were', 'released', 'theaters', 'including', 'Boy', 'Named', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Snoopy', 'Come', 'Home', 'Race', 'Your', 'Life', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Bon', 'Voyage', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'result', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'classics', 'volumes', 'True', 'fans', 'Peanuts', 'buying', 'many', 'specials', 'second', 'third', 'time', 'are', 'doubt', 'expecting', 'COMPLETE', 'Peanuts', 'collection', 'not', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'here.On', 'top', 'special', 'features', 'volume', 'are', 'sincere', 'disappointment', 'documentary', 'Vince', 'Guaraldi', 'informative', 'comprehensive', 'not', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'get', 'other', 'trailer', 'history', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'learned', 'too', 'late', 'NOT', 'kid', 'friendly', 'way', 'Peanuts', 'contrast', 'recently', 'bought', 'Snoopy', 'Reunion', 'DVD', 'were', 'wowed', 'touching', 'fascinating', 'retrospective', 'voice', 'talents', 'Peanuts', 'years', 'Where', 'kind', 'documentary', 'set', 'collection', 'incomplete', 'terms', 'features', 'additional', 'content', 'clear', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'can', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'probably', 'will', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'new', 'better', 'complete', 'set', 'produced', 'Warner', 'Paramount', 'released', 'once', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'money', 'ones']",Peanuts 1960's Collection (A Charlie Brown Christmas / Charlie Brown's All-Stars / It's the Great Pumpkin / You're in Love / He's Your Dog / It Was a Short Summer)
