326168,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,6302658500,Alex Udvary,"[8, 8]","How odd it is that this movie is directed by Sam Taylor. Who knew he'd be able to direct a drama of this manner? Every film I've seen by him has been a comedy. He directed Harold Lloyd in &quot;Safety Last&quot; & &quot;Hot Water&quot; and Laurel & Hardy in &quot;Nothing But Trouble&quot;. And now here he is directing &quot;America's Sweetheart&quot; Mary Pickford (Pollyanna).Now given the fact that a majority of people I'm willing to bet are not entirely familiar with Pickford this is such a rare movie to find that I'm sure if you've heard of this movie you must know who she is, so there's no need to inform you about her life.Pickford plays a coquette named Norma who says she loves Michael Jeffery (John Mack Brown) but still, for awhile, flirts with Stanley (Matt Moore). But sadly for Norma and Michael, Michael is not in the same social rank, and her father would never permit his daughter to marry him let alone see him ever again (sounds pretty original doesn't it lol).&quot;Coquette&quot; was Pickford's first &quot;talkie&quot; and despite what some may say I think she does a pretty good job. She seems comfortable, though I'm sure everyone on the set was a bit neverous, she still seems to pull off her role. She does make the mistake most actors\actresses have made in early &quot;talkies&quot; where they feel if they scream they are projecting strong emotions. Sort of the way singers scream and the audience goes into a frenzy.&quot;Coquette&quot; has some real great moments in the middle and throughout. Pickford and cast are really laying it on. And while I bet a lot of people think the scenes may be campy, first of all lets remember one big factor here. It's 1929! What were you expecting? Personally I didn't find the movie campy but sincere. The film's last two major scenes are done quite well and the final scene is a bit of a heartbreaker.Pickford is going to be the reason a lot of people would chose to see this movie. First of all because it's her first &quot;talkie&quot; and because she won an Academy Award for her role. But, while Pickford is good I thought Matt Moore as Stanley was the most effective actor in the movie. Where Pickford screams he remains silent. And his silence speaks volumes more then her screaming. His restraint is a plus. What happened to him after this movie?Now if Pickford and Moore are the best than William Janney as Pickford's brother Jimmy is the worst. He hams it up. And has some of the film's worst dialogue. I wonder if it was done on purpose?Mary Pickford once said &quot;I never liked one of my pictures in its entirety.&quot; what a shame. Because &quot;Coquette&quot; really is a knockout. It's one of those great sappy melodramas that were coming out of Hollywood in the 30's, films such as &quot;The Champ&quot;, &quot;Possessed&quot; (1931 version), and &quot;Paid&quot; (sadly not available on vhs or dvd).Bottom-line: Very effective Mary Pickford vehicle that won her an Oscar. Has plenty of great melodramatic moments near the end and some strong performances (Pickford, Moore).

326171,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,6302658500,calvinnme,"[0, 0]","This film won Mary Pickford the second Oscar for Best Actress ever awarded, and was one of the more controversial decisions ever made by the Academy for that particular award. When Pickford made this film, she was already 36 but was playing a girl who was approximately 20. However, her tiny size and petite features prevented her from looking ridiculous. Pickford plays Norma Besant, daughter of Dr. John Besant, a southern belle of the flapper era known as a ""coquette"" - in modern terms, a flirt. Her lack of affection for her numerous suitors does not prevent her from accepting their gifts and leading them on, but her heart truly only belongs to Michael Jeffery, a ""man from the hills"". This is a polite term for what southern rural society in those days would call white trash. The two want to get married, but Dr. Besant, being a noble southern doctor of that era, holds dear several unnegotiable rules of behavior - defending one's honor seems to require lots of gunplay, never allow blacks in the house unless they're serving you dinner or cleaning your house, and poor white people  - such as Norma's suitor - should be neither seen nor heard. Thus when the young man performs the bold act of coming to his house to ask for his daughter's hand in marriage and mentions that they have been alone together the night before - though they were only talking about their future plans - Norma's father follows after Mike and shoots him down in cold blood. What follows is Pickford's best scene. When she hears Mike has been mortally wounded by her father, she rushes to his bedside just in time to see him die. In shock, she keeps trying to tend to him, at first refusing to believe he is dead. Her brother, one of her suitors, and an old family friend convince her Mike is gone. Now, they say, she must concentrate on saving her father from the gallows. They tell her she must lie and say Mike forced himself on her and that her father was doing the noble thing. I guess lying was considered OK in the code of the old south if the victim is ""just a man from the hills"". Norma understandably refuses, saying that if her father hangs it is what he deserves.Months pass, and the trial is in progress. Norma has forgiven her father, and here, unlike Mike's deathbed, her attitude is just bizarre. She acts as though her father has done little more than take away her cell phone priveleges - to put it in modern terms - rather than kill the only man she ever loved. She is now ready to go on the witness stand and lie about Mike's character - which by everyone else's account was noble and hard working - in order to free her extremey guilty father. However, it does indeed tear up Norma's conscience to say untrue things about her deceased beau, and she breaks down on the stand. At that moment, her father has a moment of clarity, goes to her, and tells her he was wrong to do what he did, and the two reconcile. He then grabs the gun that is lying as evidence on a nearby table and shoots himself, declaring that he owes his life to the state for his actions. End of story.Pickford's performance viewed today appears merely mediocre compared those of other early talkie actresses. You have to remember though, seeing America's Sweetheart talk for the first time was for the audiences of 1929 like seeing and hearing that T-Rex in Jurassic Park in 1993 - it's easy to confuse a technological milestone with a great performance, at least until the novelty wears off. What was interesting for me was to see the ""code of the South"" in its death throes. The attitudes of the upper class toward even the hard-working members of the poorer classes in the south were about to collapse when the Great Depression made poor people out of so many of the so-called nobility and put them all in the same crowded, uncomfortable boat.",3,Not particularly flattering for Pickford or the South,1171497600,"02 15, 2007",2007,3821,"['film', 'won', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'second', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress', 'ever', 'awarded', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'controversial', 'decisions', 'ever', 'made', 'Academy', 'particular', 'award', 'When', 'Pickford', 'made', 'film', 'was', 'already', '36', 'was', 'playing', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'approximately', '20', 'However', 'tiny', 'size', 'petite', 'features', 'prevented', 'looking', 'ridiculous', 'Pickford', 'Norma', 'Besant', 'daughter', 'Dr.', 'John', 'Besant', 'southern', 'belle', 'flapper', 'era', 'known', 'coquette', 'modern', 'terms', 'flirt', 'lack', 'affection', 'numerous', 'suitors', 'not', 'prevent', 'accepting', 'gifts', 'leading', 'heart', 'truly', 'only', 'Michael', 'Jeffery', 'man', 'hills', 'polite', 'term', 'what', 'southern', 'rural', 'society', 'days', 'would', 'call', 'white', 'trash', 'two', 'want', 'get', 'married', 'Dr.', 'Besant', 'being', 'noble', 'southern', 'doctor', 'era', 'dear', 'several', 'unnegotiable', 'rules', 'behavior', 'defending', 'one', 'honor', 'require', 'lots', 'gunplay', 'never', 'allow', 'blacks', 'house', ""'re"", 'serving', 'dinner', 'cleaning', 'house', 'poor', 'white', 'people', 'such', 'Norma', 'suitor', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'heard', 'Thus', 'when', 'young', 'man', 'bold', 'act', 'coming', 'house', 'ask', 'daughter', 'hand', 'marriage', 'mentions', 'have', 'been', 'alone', 'together', 'night', 'were', 'only', 'talking', 'future', 'Norma', 'father', 'Mike', 'shoots', 'down', 'cold', 'blood', 'What', 'Pickford', 'best', 'scene', 'When', 'Mike', 'been', 'mortally', 'wounded', 'father', 'bedside', 'just', 'time', 'see', 'die', 'shock', 'trying', 'tend', 'first', 'refusing', 'believe', 'dead', 'brother', 'one', 'suitors', 'old', 'family', 'friend', 'convince', 'Mike', 'gone', 'Now', 'say', 'must', 'concentrate', 'saving', 'father', 'gallows', 'tell', 'must', 'lie', 'say', 'Mike', 'forced', 'father', 'was', 'doing', 'noble', 'thing', 'guess', 'lying', 'was', 'considered', 'OK', 'code', 'old', 'south', 'victim', 'just', 'man', 'hills', 'Norma', 'understandably', 'saying', 'father', 'hangs', 'what', 'pass', 'trial', 'progress', 'Norma', 'forgiven', 'father', 'here', 'Mike', 'deathbed', 'attitude', 'just', 'bizarre', 'father', 'done', 'little', 'more', 'take', 'away', 'cell', 'phone', 'put', 'modern', 'terms', 'rather', 'kill', 'only', 'man', 'ever', 'loved', 'now', 'ready', 'go', 'witness', 'stand', 'lie', 'Mike', 'character', 'everyone', 'else', 'account', 'was', 'noble', 'hard', 'working', 'order', 'free', 'extremey', 'guilty', 'father', 'However', 'indeed', 'tear', 'up', 'Norma', 'conscience', 'say', 'untrue', 'things', 'deceased', 'beau', 'down', 'stand', 'moment', 'father', 'moment', 'clarity', 'was', 'wrong', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'two', 'reconcile', 'then', 'grabs', 'gun', 'lying', 'evidence', 'nearby', 'table', 'shoots', 'declaring', 'life', 'state', 'actions', 'End', 'story.Pickford', 'performance', 'viewed', 'today', 'merely', 'mediocre', 'compared', 'other', 'early', 'talkie', 'actresses', 'have', 'remember', 'seeing', 'America', 'Sweetheart', 'talk', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'audiences', '1929', 'seeing', 'hearing', 'T-Rex', 'Jurassic', 'Park', '1993', 'easy', 'confuse', 'technological', 'milestone', 'great', 'performance', 'least', 'novelty', 'off', 'What', 'was', 'interesting', 'was', 'see', 'code', 'South', 'death', 'throes', 'attitudes', 'upper', 'class', 'even', 'hard-working', 'members', 'poorer', 'south', 'were', 'about', 'collapse', 'when', 'Great', 'Depression', 'made', 'poor', 'people', 'so', 'many', 'so-called', 'nobility', 'put', 'same', 'crowded', 'uncomfortable', 'boat']",N/A
326172,A2WQF0QROK09AT,6302658500,F. J. PRISCO,"[0, 0]","Funny that anyone rates this one or five stars, since it is clearly neither. Yes, Mary Pickford has better movies under her name, but that has no bearing on this one; either it's worth seeing or it isn't, and answer is that it is but just barely.The good: Mary Pickford does just fine projecting her voice and playing an adult character. Her 'southern accent' isn't the worst we've heard, and she has a decent Oscar-highlight scene (boy friend's death).The not-so-good: well, sound was new, and both filmmakers and audiences had to learn just how this new medium should affect the art. Into that void went a lot of stage-isms that haven't aged well: stagey tones, stagey timing, stagey postures. The standout acting is by Louise Beavers, cast only as domestic due to her skin color but by far the most effective presence in this film.The bad: well, there's everybody else's acting, which ranges from acceptable to wooden. This isn't helped by the script (full of people making some strong statement followed by demurral - ""Oh, I guess I'm just ______ ..."", all delivered in the same tone regardless of who is speaking), and the lack of any real chemistry between Pickford and her paramour(s).As films go, this isn't great, but it is competent if rather histrionic. As 1929 talkies go, it's a success & vindication: with competent star power and a fairly brave story issue [the key drama revolves around what happened unsupervised in the cabin that night]. Pickford was in her 30s, and understandably done with being a Little Girl; by 1931, she would learn that her adoring public would not accept that. COQUETTE may only be worth seeing once these days, but in 1929 it was as good as anything else being made.

Happily, I think Mary Pickford did a splendid job of acting her heart out; and the others performed very convincingly, too! The choreography works well especially in the dance hall scene but the cinematography and dialogue was a bit ""creaky"" as is the case with many early talkies. As I watched the film certain long sequences all on one stage gave it the feel of a stage play but the plot and the acting are both so good that this is not a major problem. The musical score, while not extensive since this is certainly no musical, enhances the film and there's plenty of suspense as well!When the action starts, we quickly meet a few members of a wealthy family living somewhere in the south at the time this film was made. The patriarch of the family, Dr. John Besant (John St. Polis), cherishes his old fashioned Southern ways and pride. Unfortunately for Dr. Besant, however, he's becoming concerned about his very flirtatious daughter Norma (Mary Pickford). Norma has the chance to date practically any man in town because she is so attractive; she has no problem finding dates! Stanley Wentworth (Matt Moore) is a one good choice for Norma to date but Norma far prefers and desires the rather hot-headed, ne'er do well Michael Jeffrey (Johnny Mack Brown). But things become complicated: John Besant can't stand even the idea of Michael dating Norma and it isn't long before the two hot headed men clash. Not only does Dr. Besant want Michael away from his daughter Norma, he even wants Michael out of town--for good!But what Dr. Besant doesn't know is that Michael plans to turn over a new leaf, work hard at a new job to get enough money so he and Norma can marry and start off at somewhat comfortably and respectably! This relatively innocent goal leads to a series of unexpected and tragic events. The rest of the film shows how all of the issues play out.Look also for solid performances by Louise Beavers as Julia, the maid; William Janney as Jimmy Besant; Henry Kolker as Jasper Carter and George Irving as Robert Wentworth.Coquette not only tells an attention-grabbing story; it proved Mary Pickford could carry a talking picture.

Pickford tired of her goody-goody personna in pictures and after her mother Charlotte died in 1928, she had her legendary curls bobbed and announced to the fan magazines that she wanted to be &quot;dressed in smart clothes and play the lover&quot;.  The same year this turkey was made (1929) Pickford and her then-husband Douglas Fairbanks played in a politely well-received - but fairly ludicrous - version of Shakespeare's THE TAMING OF THE SHREW.  In 1931, Pickford resurrected an old Norma Talmadge silent vehicle - which co-starred Ronald Colman - entitled KIKI: it was a flop.  In 1933, at the milestone age of 40, Mary made her movie swan song performance in SECRETS, a fairly well-acted drama which co-starred 40 year-old Leslie Howard.  COQUETTE was based upon an original play by George Abbott and Ann Preston, which was written for Helen Hayes.  This photoplay adaptation is a creaky drama that served to introduce the previously silent Pickford to the talkies.  Surprisingly, she beat out Jeanne Eagels for the Best Actress AA for 1929 (The ailing heroin-addicted Eagels - she would die later that year - was nominated for her performance as Leslie Crosbie in Maugham's THE LETTER). In all honesty, Pickford had a lovely voice - something which was in short supply among silent stars making their transition into the talkies - but her performance is hardly Oscar-worthy.",2,A CREAKY CURIO.,1033948800,"10 7, 2002",2002,1739,"['tribute', 'acting', 'ability', '36', 'year-old', 'Pickford', 'Norma', 'Besant', 'flirtatious', 'twenty-something', 'Southern', 'flapper', 'who', 'hard', 'Michael', 'Jeffery', 'Dire', 'consequences', 'arise', 'due', 'father', 'intense', 'disdain', 'young', 'man', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'was', 'institution', 'silent', 'period', 'when', 'was', 'known', 'quot', 'America', 'Sweetheart', 'quot', 'Pickford', 'tired', 'goody-goody', 'personna', 'pictures', 'mother', 'Charlotte', 'died', '1928', 'had', 'legendary', 'curls', 'bobbed', 'announced', 'fan', 'magazines', 'wanted', 'be', 'quot', 'dressed', 'smart', 'clothes', 'play', 'lover', 'quot', 'same', 'year', 'turkey', 'was', 'made', '1929', 'Pickford', 'then-husband', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'played', 'politely', 'well-received', 'fairly', 'ludicrous', 'version', 'Shakespeare', 'THE', 'TAMING', 'THE', 'SHREW', '1931', 'Pickford', 'resurrected', 'old', 'Norma', 'Talmadge', 'silent', 'vehicle', 'co-starred', 'Ronald', 'Colman', 'entitled', 'KIKI', 'was', 'flop', '1933', 'milestone', 'age', '40', 'Mary', 'made', 'movie', 'swan', 'song', 'performance', 'SECRETS', 'fairly', 'well-acted', 'drama', 'co-starred', '40', 'year-old', 'Leslie', 'Howard', 'COQUETTE', 'was', 'based', 'original', 'play', 'George', 'Abbott', 'Ann', 'Preston', 'was', 'written', 'Helen', 'Hayes', 'photoplay', 'adaptation', 'creaky', 'drama', 'served', 'introduce', 'previously', 'silent', 'Pickford', 'talkies', 'Surprisingly', 'beat', 'out', 'Jeanne', 'Eagels', 'Best', 'Actress', 'AA', '1929', 'ailing', 'heroin-addicted', 'Eagels', 'would', 'die', 'later', 'year', 'was', 'nominated', 'performance', 'Leslie', 'Crosbie', 'Maugham', 'THE', 'LETTER', 'honesty', 'Pickford', 'had', 'lovely', 'voice', 'something', 'was', 'short', 'supply', 'silent', 'stars', 'making', 'transition', 'talkies', 'performance', 'hardly', 'Oscar-worthy']",N/A
