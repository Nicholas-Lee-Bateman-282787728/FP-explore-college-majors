This movie has major significance to what prisoners (innocent or not)has to endure day-to-day! ''You can't be a Tyrant & a bully and not expect for the tables to turn on you & those like you''!This movie is about Ethinicity,Good-Evil,Love-Hate and Bonds that are broken due to jealousy. It tells people of any creed or color to embrace & be Proud of who & what you are. Remain Humble don't let others steer you wrong! Don't make assumptions of others because you don't walk in their shoes (it's much deeper than what's on the surface). The same jail that Lamont (Esposito) put prisoners in was the same in which he becomes a prisoner!!",5,A STORY OF HOW THESE TYRANTS ABUSE THEIR POWER!,1116806400,"05 23, 2005",2005,749,"['Seeing', 'Keeper', 'caused', 'retrospect', 'back', 'movie', 'Walls', 'based', 'story', 'Attica', '71', 'movie', 'major', 'significance', 'what', 'prisoners', 'innocent', 'not', 'endure', 'day-to-day', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'Tyrant', 'bully', 'not', 'expect', 'tables', 'turn', 'movie', 'Ethinicity', 'Good-Evil', 'Love-Hate', 'Bonds', 'are', 'broken', 'due', 'jealousy', 'people', 'creed', 'color', 'embrace', 'be', 'Proud', 'who', 'what', 'are', 'Remain', 'Humble', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'others', 'steer', 'wrong', 'Do', ""n't"", 'make', 'assumptions', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'walk', 'shoes', 'much', 'deeper', 'what', 'surface', 'same', 'jail', 'Lamont', 'Esposito', 'put', 'prisoners', 'was', 'same', 'prisoner']",Keeper

If it wasn't for the fact that the story took place in approx. four different settings it would have done well in a stage play.  It was a hard hitting drama that basically focused on injustice.  I rated it four instead of five, because in a few spots the sound was messed up.
