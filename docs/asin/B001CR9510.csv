1177464,A3C9UDU6XQQ70Q,B001CR9510,Canuck in WA,"[10, 13]","I have previously purchased (3) of these DVD's in the America's Game set (1970 Colts, 71 Cowboys, and the 69 Vikings-Missing Rings), and this ranks alongside the 69 Vikings as the best produced one yet; and this is difficult to admit given that I am a lifelong Baltimore Colts fan (yes, BALTIMORE, NOT INDY).  But like a train wreck where you really should't watch it, but are compelled to, I had to buy it to get the NY perspective of Super Bowl 3 from their side.  The DVD interviewees are Don Maynard, Joe Namath and Gerry Philbin, and I have to admit, I was absolutely floored at some of the content that was released in it.  When Joe Namath is being interviewed and he states that one of the biggest honors he ever received as a player was being named team captain, and 3 seconds later Gerry Philbin remarks that the only reason Joe Namath was named team captain was because the owners and team management told the rest of the team that they HAD to name him, I was shocked and amused at the rest of the story.  Another episode that really has some shock value to it is a segment where both Philbin and Namath are on the ""Kyle Rote Show"" at the end of the season, and Namath remarks on it that ""He'd rather face the Raiders instead of the Chiefs for the AFL championship"" and goes on to state just why (the Chiefs and Raiders had tied for the Western Division championship at the end of the 68 season and needed a one-game playoff to decide who would go to the AFL championship game).  For me, during that time period where humility was common, to hear him state that on national television was really kind of a revelation, and surprised me as much as the ""guarantee"" he made in stating the Jets were going to beat the Colts.  Again, Namath is a good interviewee, but for me, Maynard and Philbin are the real stars of this DVD.  I havent seen either one give a whole lot of interviews in any of the previous NFL Films sets, but after watching these two, I wish they were the focus of other DVD sets as well.Frankly, I have to admit that this was a really well produced DVD and was definitely worth the money . .even if it was at the expense of my Colts back in '68.",5,Very entertaining.

1177465,A3737SEKOIHFQE,B001CR9510,ez,"[1, 6]",I am very disappointed in the DVDs I purchased. 15 different supposed super bowl collection series DVDs. A series in which a different super bowl was what the cover depicts for each team. THE SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS then it gives the number of the super bowl in roman numerals. Other have Americans game the SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP and shows the ring on the cover. Did I miss something? Would that mean the game is what the DVD is about?  Wrong the only super bowls I have received in their eternity are the two Broncos' super bowls of the Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII that came along with the 1977 AFC Championship Game in a three set entitled the Broncos 3 greatest games. Said nothing about super bowl games. The only reason I knew the super bowl games were included was I had researched it on another website what I should have done for these. All very misleading. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning 13 DVD.

1177466,A1CQCS17LQCHIH,B001CR9510,Jinkyu,"[2, 3]","Very enjoyable; a familiar story with some extra insights and some footage people will unlikely have seen before.  Joe Namath is of course one of the commentators, but with receiver Don Maynard and defensive end Gerry Philbin, you have some added entertainment because of their blunt and, at times, irreverent tone.  In the case of Philbin, the irreverent tone was at times applied to Namath.  Take Philbin's truthful comments on why Namath was elected captain at the beginning of the 1968 season: not because he had the necessaries, but because the Jets needed him to take the responsibility to negate his flamboyant style and off-the-field antics that tended to take his mind away from the game.Namath pays homage to offensive guard Dave Herman (who had to block Bubba Smith) and, of course, fullback Matt Snell, as heroes of Super Bowl III.  As for the MVP award, well, he is not so sure he absolutely deserved it, but with a smile, he is glad to have it.  I must say, I never objected severely to Namath and his guarantee as Super Bowl III MVP, although I admit, if it cracked down to it, I would take Snell.  However, I have always thought Namath, with pretty good stats (including yay, no interceptions), and receiver George Sauer were close performance-wise.  Namath vs. Snell is sort of like Roger Maris vs. Mickey Mantle for 1961 AL MVP -- it is an obvious analogy.What was missing was enough acknowledgement of the Jets' excellent defensive team of that year.  Sure, with Philbin as the commentator, they were bound to show a couple of good plays by him, but both the regular program and the extras were otherwise completely dominated by the offense: Namath all over the place, then joint profiles in the extras of halfback Emerson Boozer and Snell, plus Maynard and Sauer.  There is a separate section on Sauer's reasons for retirement and disenchantment with football that I find confusing and unclear.But that year, the Jets finished first in fewest yards allowed, fewest rushing yards allowed, and lowest yards per carry (3.2) against opposing rushers.  Defensive tackles Verlon Biggs and John Elliot and the three linebackers were tough cookies.  The Jets allowed 280 points, but ten of the touchdowns, including four touchdown runs on intercepted Namath passes, were ones the defense did not allow.  Keener football fans will recall that only two years later, in 1970, the first year after the merger with the NFL, the Jets were even better against the rush.  Despite Philbin's missing many games with injuries, they held opposing offenses to 3.1 yards per carry, the best in pro football, in a 26-team league as opposed to 10 AFL teams in 1968.I could go on: The offensive line deserved a lot of credit too, but the backfield and receivers made the headlines.  Anyway, I recommend this DVD for fans of the Jets dream season as well as those who want to get a good picture of what the AFL was like in the 1960s.",4,"Good Viewing, I Guarantee It",1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,2927,"['Very', 'enjoyable', 'familiar', 'story', 'extra', 'insights', 'footage', 'people', 'will', 'unlikely', 'have', 'seen', 'before', 'Joe', 'Namath', 'course', 'one', 'commentators', 'receiver', 'Don', 'Maynard', 'defensive', 'end', 'Gerry', 'Philbin', 'have', 'added', 'entertainment', 'blunt', 'times', 'irreverent', 'tone', 'case', 'Philbin', 'irreverent', 'tone', 'was', 'times', 'applied', 'Namath', 'Take', 'Philbin', 'truthful', 'comments', 'why', 'Namath', 'was', 'elected', 'captain', 'beginning', '1968', 'season', 'not', 'had', 'necessaries', 'Jets', 'needed', 'take', 'responsibility', 'negate', 'flamboyant', 'style', 'off-the-field', 'antics', 'tended', 'take', 'mind', 'away', 'game.Namath', 'homage', 'offensive', 'guard', 'Dave', 'Herman', 'who', 'had', 'block', 'Bubba', 'Smith', 'course', 'fullback', 'Matt', 'Snell', 'heroes', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'III', 'MVP', 'award', 'well', 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'absolutely', 'deserved', 'smile', 'glad', 'have', 'must', 'say', 'never', 'objected', 'severely', 'Namath', 'guarantee', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'III', 'MVP', 'admit', 'cracked', 'down', 'would', 'take', 'Snell', 'However', 'have', 'always', 'thought', 'Namath', 'pretty', 'good', 'stats', 'including', 'yay', 'interceptions', 'receiver', 'George', 'Sauer', 'were', 'close', 'performance-wise', 'Namath', 'vs.', 'Snell', 'sort', 'Roger', 'Maris', 'Mickey', 'Mantle', '1961', 'AL', 'MVP', 'obvious', 'analogy.What', 'was', 'missing', 'was', 'enough', 'acknowledgement', 'Jets', 'excellent', 'defensive', 'team', 'year', 'Sure', 'Philbin', 'commentator', 'were', 'bound', 'show', 'couple', 'good', 'plays', 'regular', 'program', 'extras', 'were', 'otherwise', 'completely', 'dominated', 'offense', 'Namath', 'place', 'then', 'joint', 'profiles', 'extras', 'halfback', 'Emerson', 'Boozer', 'Snell', 'Maynard', 'Sauer', 'separate', 'section', 'Sauer', 'reasons', 'retirement', 'disenchantment', 'football', 'find', 'confusing', 'unclear.But', 'year', 'Jets', 'finished', 'first', 'fewest', 'yards', 'allowed', 'fewest', 'rushing', 'yards', 'allowed', 'lowest', 'yards', 'carry', '3.2', 'opposing', 'rushers', 'Defensive', 'tackles', 'Verlon', 'Biggs', 'John', 'Elliot', 'three', 'linebackers', 'were', 'tough', 'cookies', 'Jets', 'allowed', '280', 'points', 'ten', 'touchdowns', 'including', 'four', 'touchdown', 'runs', 'intercepted', 'Namath', 'passes', 'were', 'ones', 'defense', 'did', 'not', 'allow', 'Keener', 'football', 'fans', 'will', 'recall', 'only', 'two', 'years', 'later', '1970', 'first', 'year', 'merger', 'NFL', 'Jets', 'were', 'even', 'better', 'rush', 'Philbin', 'missing', 'many', 'games', 'injuries', 'held', 'opposing', 'offenses', '3.1', 'yards', 'carry', 'best', 'pro', 'football', '26-team', 'league', 'opposed', '10', 'AFL', 'teams', '1968.I', 'could', 'go', 'offensive', 'line', 'deserved', 'lot', 'credit', 'too', 'backfield', 'receivers', 'made', 'headlines', 'Anyway', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'fans', 'Jets', 'dream', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'want', 'get', 'good', 'picture', 'what', 'AFL', 'was', '1960s']",NFL America's Game: 1968 JETS
