828457,A10FHA5E7VEDTW,B00029NM3Q,Colin Y.,"[2, 2]","I loved Here is Greenwood when I first saw it on the old VHS tapes. While the new DVD is the same excellent show, it has been redubbed for the worse.I suspect the reason why it was redubbed was so that they could record voices on more updated 21st century sound equipment. The problem is that they did not have the original English cast do the new recording, and have recorded the new voices with a new cast. Mitsuru and Shun sound particularly crappy on this new dub.Despite this, the show itself is great, and I give it five stars. It's funny, kind of nutty, and also dramatic at times. The DVD has the original Japanese voices, so I'd suggest you watch that. If you're a dub only kind of person, you may want to think about getting the old VHS version; the new dub is just that disappointing.",5,"Awesome series, new awful dub",1097452800,"10 11, 2004",2004,795,"['loved', 'Here', 'Greenwood', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'old', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'new', 'DVD', 'same', 'excellent', 'show', 'been', 'redubbed', 'worse.I', 'suspect', 'reason', 'why', 'was', 'redubbed', 'was', 'so', 'could', 'record', 'voices', 'more', 'updated', '21st', 'century', 'sound', 'equipment', 'problem', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'original', 'English', 'cast', 'do', 'new', 'recording', 'have', 'recorded', 'new', 'voices', 'new', 'cast', 'Mitsuru', 'Shun', 'sound', 'particularly', 'crappy', 'new', 'dub.Despite', 'show', 'great', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'funny', 'kind', 'nutty', 'also', 'dramatic', 'times', 'DVD', 'original', 'Japanese', 'voices', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'watch', ""'re"", 'dub', 'only', 'kind', 'person', 'may', 'want', 'think', 'getting', 'old', 'VHS', 'version', 'new', 'dub', 'just', 'disappointing']",Here is Green Wood

I watched the VHS of this series over and over again when I was in middle & high school (makes the rest of you feel old, eh?). Now that I'm able to watch the DVD, I recognize Shun's voice completely. I didn't even know there was a new set of talent till I read the reviews here. And until shown otherwise I refuse to believe it.It's nowhere near as awful as either the new Eva dub or the new Akira dub which just makes me want to burn my copy every time I want to watch it. In fact I love this dub and take no issue with it. Unless my version of the DVD is special and for some reason includes the original dub.Seriously though, this series is phenominal. For me it falls into a personal favorite OVA trilogy of ""Here Is Greenwood,"" ""Shinesman"" and ""Golden Boy.""Although genre wise it's definately more in line with Marmalade Boy which is by no means an insult since I think it's one of the most underappreciated anime series ever.",5,New Voice Acting?,1141689600,"03 7, 2006",2006,981,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'talking', 'watched', 'VHS', 'series', 'over', 'again', 'when', 'was', 'middle', 'high', 'school', 'rest', 'feel', 'old', 'eh', 'Now', ""'m"", 'able', 'watch', 'DVD', 'recognize', 'Shun', 'voice', 'completely', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'was', 'new', 'set', 'talent', 'till', 'read', 'reviews', 'here', 'shown', 'otherwise', 'refuse', 'believe', 'it.It', 'nowhere', 'as', 'awful', 'new', 'Eva', 'dub', 'new', 'Akira', 'dub', 'just', 'want', 'burn', 'copy', 'time', 'want', 'watch', 'fact', 'love', 'dub', 'take', 'issue', 'version', 'DVD', 'special', 'reason', 'original', 'dub.Seriously', 'series', 'phenominal', 'personal', 'favorite', 'OVA', 'trilogy', 'Here', 'Greenwood', 'Shinesman', 'Golden', 'Boy', 'genre', 'wise', 'definately', 'more', 'line', 'Marmalade', 'Boy', 'means', 'insult', 'think', 'one', 'most', 'underappreciated', 'anime', 'series', 'ever']",Here is Green Wood

To flee this ridicules home situation, Kazuya moves into Greenwood, the school's dorm. There he hopes for peace and quiet... but thats not what he finds. Greenwood is home to the weirdest students on campus.Here is Greenwood is a 6 episode OVA based on a 11 volume manga, so much of the story is left out. The first four episodes are self contained, while the last two are a two part arc about Kazuya's new crush. The funniest episode has the residents of Greenwood making a fantasy movie with characters that have ridicules names like ""Lemon Herb"" and ""Cool Mint"". I laughed every time the evil demon king was called ""Cool"".This was my first time seeing this show, so I don't have the bias of nostalgia, but I thought it was pretty fun.
