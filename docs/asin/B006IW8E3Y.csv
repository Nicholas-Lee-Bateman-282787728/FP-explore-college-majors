1515935,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B006IW8E3Y,Andres C. Salama,"[1, 2]","In a small village in Lebanon, Christians and Muslims live peacefully side by side. They speak the same language, enjoy the same TV shows, they share broadly the same culture, only their religion divides them. However, peace is only apparent since violent conflict seems to arise within a hair's edge. It is up to the women of the village to try to pacify the men (sometimes with outlandish schemes) and quell any arguments which could degenerate into a war. In this obvious crowd pleaser, director Nadine Labaki (who also has a role as one of the Christian women in the village) tries to paint the village as a microcosm of Lebanon in the years after the long, brutal Lebanese civil war. If the film is to believed, the country is only in a weak truce before Christians and Muslims are at each other's throats again. I wasn't too impressed with director Labaki's previous film Caramel, but this one is pretty enjoyable. On the minus side, the humor is perhaps too broad at times. And a subplot where a group of Ukrainian belly dancers are drawn to the village in a harebrained plot to pacify the place seems pretty weak.",4,"A bit broad, but entertaining and well meaning",1355616000,"12 16, 2012",2012,1121,"['small', 'village', 'Lebanon', 'Christians', 'Muslims', 'live', 'peacefully', 'side', 'side', 'speak', 'same', 'language', 'enjoy', 'same', 'TV', 'shows', 'share', 'broadly', 'same', 'culture', 'only', 'religion', 'However', 'peace', 'only', 'apparent', 'violent', 'conflict', 'arise', 'hair', 'edge', 'women', 'village', 'try', 'pacify', 'men', 'sometimes', 'outlandish', 'schemes', 'quell', 'arguments', 'could', 'degenerate', 'war', 'obvious', 'crowd', 'pleaser', 'director', 'Nadine', 'Labaki', 'who', 'also', 'role', 'one', 'Christian', 'women', 'village', 'paint', 'village', 'microcosm', 'Lebanon', 'years', 'long', 'brutal', 'Lebanese', 'civil', 'war', 'film', 'believed', 'country', 'only', 'weak', 'truce', 'Christians', 'Muslims', 'are', 'other', 'throats', 'again', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'impressed', 'director', 'Labaki', 'previous', 'film', 'Caramel', 'one', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'minus', 'side', 'humor', 'perhaps', 'too', 'broad', 'times', 'subplot', 'where', 'group', 'Ukrainian', 'belly', 'dancers', 'are', 'drawn', 'village', 'harebrained', 'plot', 'pacify', 'place', 'pretty', 'weak']",Where Do We Go Now?

1515937,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B006IW8E3Y,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 3]","From Lebanese director Nadine Labaki (""Caramel"", ""Bosta"", ""The Smallest Red Carpet, But the Biggest Heart"") comes her whimsical comedy about women of a village wanting to make a difference when their husbands of Christian or Muslim faith are fighting with each other.The film was inspired by Nadine's experience in Lebanon in war after two decades of peace and two opposing political parties moving towards war.  As an expecting mother, Nadine saw neighbors and friends turn to enemies because they belonged to opposing religious groups.  And so, she thought about her son and what kind of world he would see when he was born.  Would he be like everyone else who engaged in war?  As a mother, she thought about wanting to keep her son out of war and with the film, it developed from being one woman to a village of women who would do all they can to keep their son's from engaging in war.The film premiered as part of the 2011 Cannes Film Festival's ""Un Certain Regard"" and won a ""Cadillac People's Choice Award"" at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival.VIDEO:""Where Do We Go Now?"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  Picture quality for the film is beautiful.  Cinematography by Christophe Offenstein (""Tell No One"", ""Little White Lies"", ""Whatever You Say"") is warm, colorful and there is amazing details when it comes to the close-ups.  Wide shots are also breathtaking.  I didn't detect any scratches, dust or any problems while viewing the film.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Where Do We Go Now?"" is presented in Arabic 5.0 DTS-HD MA.  Lossless audio features crystal clear dialogue and music.  While the film is primarily center and front-channel driven, there are moments where ambiance of surroundings can be heard through the surround channels. Especially during the more action-paced scenes.  Also, the film has a wonderful musical score by Composer Khaled Mouzanar .Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES""Where Do We Go Now?"" comes with the following special features:Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by Director Nadine Labaki and Composer Khaled MouzannarAn Evening with Writer/Director/Actress Nadine Labaki, Composer Khaled Mouzanar and Producer Anne-Dominique Toussaint - (39:11) Director and actress Nadine Labaki explains what inspired her to create this film and we learn about the production, music of the film and more.The Making of Where Do We Go Now? -  (18:16) - Behind-the-scenes of the making of the film.Where Do We Go Now?: Making the Music - (12:16) A featurette on composer Khaled Mouzanar and the making of the music for the film.JUDGMENT CALL:Nadine Labaki takes one of the most complex situations that has affected various regions of the world for centuries and tries to find a silver lining through comedy and understanding.  But also with hope.May it be in Lebanon or another country, there religious differences between Christians and Muslims are serious and what makes Labaki's film so fascinating is the fact that the village featured, is not affected by media, television, newspapers or Internet.Sure, when they try to introduce television to the masses, surely things start to unravel.  There is a scene in which the village, which have co-existed and have remained peaceful, begin watching a newscast that details the ongoing fight between Christian and Muslims and it makes you wonder if that was the intention of Labaki.  To show that religious disagreements are possibly heightened by media.But watching the film, we see how people do try to make an effort for peace, to not quickly blame the other religion for problems.  But when things get out of hand, the women take charge.  The film was also quite fascinating because it was born out of Nadine Labaki's experience in Lebanon and wondering how she can keep her son growing up in a world with hostilities.  Facing the absurdity of the conflicts and with her experience, it's an experience that other women share, not wanting their husbands and sons being killed in war.  So, the women decide to take action.This is very intriguing because we often read in newspapers of how women do not have a voice in the Middle East.  Labaki's ""Where Do We Go Now?"" is a film that if the men are the cause of these religious disagreements and can not find peace with one another, perhaps the women of both religions can join forces and nullify these hostilities.They try to find ways to do it in the film, granted the hiring of dancers and using sex as a way to calming people down can only go so far.  But there is a message in the film.  That women in leadership positions or women who can be empowered, can make a big difference.  The film is not about finding solutions as this turmoil has been ongoing for centuries, but what Labaki was able to create, was a film that although not seen as complete feminism, but belief and hope that women can and will make a difference, if they work together, rally together and believe that they can make a change.As for the Blu-ray release, the cinematography is beautiful and the picture quality is fantastic.  Lossless audio is appropriate and you also get a good amount of special features included.While the film has a good blend of comedy and even music-driven scenes, some may find the blend of comedy and melodrama to be a bit jarring.  Personally, not only do I see it as progressive, I see it as a film that possibly can inspire or add hope to many women.But I do admit that the film is quite problematic when you try to balance comedy and melodrama.  With something as tense as Christian and Muslim relations, when people are killed, comedy is not a way to diffuse the situation.  But Labaki does try and accomplishes in sending out a message that women in various countries can possibly make a difference.",4,"(3.5 stars) Featuring beautiful cinematography and a unique storyline,

1515941,A328S9RN3U5M68,B006IW8E3Y,Grady Harp,"[5, 6]","Lebanese actress/writer/director/producer offers on of the most poignant statement about the struggle in the Middle East, a struggle between Christians and Muslims for power and dominance -a struggle that while real is the most preposterous argument tow `religions' based on love could have. Would that more people would watch this film there would probably be a better understanding of why the ongoing wars there are likely to never be settled.The story as written by the gifted Nadine Labaki (who also stars and directs) is that of a little village in Lebanon that is half Christian and half Muslim: the church and the mosque stand side by side and the morning bells from the church play at the same time the Muezzin calls the Muslims to prayer, the cemetery is divided between the Muslim side and the Christian side, etc. The balance between the two factions is tenuous and the men are always looking for ways to start war among themselves. The women of the town try everything to ease the tension - create a caf&eacute;, import Ukrainian belly dancers to distract them, ply them with hashish-laden foods.  But when a stray bullet kills the male child of one of the mothers the division stops, the mother hides the slaughtered child, attempting to keep peace until silly arguments among the youths result in the discovery that the endless bilateral taunting has resulted in a tragedy. At the end of the film the narrator speaks: `My story is now ending for all those who were listening, of a town where peace was found while fighting continued all around. Of men who slept so deep and woke to find new peace. Of women still in black, who fought with flowers and prayers instead of guns and flares, and protect their children. Destiny then drove them to find a new way' - to which the pallbearers ask of the divided cemetery, `Where do we go now?'Labaki understands the need for comic relief in a story of this nature and she provides that in some very warmly funny ways - the women walking along in groups sing and do a choreographic step that makes us smile.  But the power of the film is the message of compassion and the desperate need to re-think the omnipresent crises that tear the Middle East apart.  And it is quite proper to find similarities in every part of society.

1515947,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B006IW8E3Y,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[9, 10]","Where Do We Go Now is several things at once: a drama; a comedy; a musical of sorts; a slice of life in a troubled village and a commentary on life in general, at least in Lebanon and other countries nearby. It succeeds very well! True, once or twice things changed too quickly from drama to comedy or music; but this is a minor quibble. The plot moves along at a good pace and I was glued to the screen to see how everything would play out. The acting is superlative; although the actors are not highly seasoned professionals they give nuanced, convincing and passionate performances. The choreography and the cinematography work well and the musical score enhances the film, too.When the action starts, we meet quite a few people in a Lebanese village isolated because the only bridge to it is badly damaged and needs repair; traveling too far from the village is also dangerous because of land mines. The villagers are hemmed in. Fortunately, there is peace between the Christian and Muslim members of the community; their houses of worship are almost side by side--there's just one house between the mosque and the church. People are also very excited that a few teenagers found a way to hook up a television; now they can watch programs including the news.It isn't long, however, before pent up tensions begin to surface. At first it's just a comment here and there; but things deteriorate. Once the villagers see on television is that there is fighting on the outside between Muslims and Christians, the Muslim and Christian men in the village begin to fight and the women oppose the violence. Things begin to spiral out of control after Muslims suspect that Christians put goats in their Mosque and stole their shoes while they were praying inside the mosque; and Christians are appalled and angered when  a Muslim man smashes their statue of the Virgin Mary and they discover chicken blood in the font to mock their Communion.The religious leaders want peace but it is the women who really struggle to make it happen. The women hire Ukrainian belly dancers to distract the men and put hashish in baked goods to make the men mellow! There's more, too, including a huge plot twist at the end of the film that left quite an impression on me.Look for superb performances by director Nadine Labaki who plays Amale, a Christian woman in love with Muslim Rabih (Julian Farhat); Kevin Abboud as Nassim; Petra Saghbini as Rita; Caroline Labaki as Ada; Yvonne Maalouf as Yvonne; Claude Baz Moussawbaa as Takla; Ali Haidar as Roukoz; Oxana Chihane as Katia and Leyla Hakim as Afaf. As I mentioned above, the others give wonderful performances, too.Where Do We Go Now is a poignant look at life in a troubled Lebanese village and how it can be so hard to achieve peace between warring groups, in this case Christians and Muslims. I highly recommend this film for people who like drama with cultural, social and political themes with a side dish of comedy and even some music to lighten things up. Moreover, people who appreciate the work of Nadine Labaki will not be disappointed.",5,"""The story I tell is for all who want to hear...""",1349136000,"10 2, 2012",2012,3076,"['Where', 'Do', 'Go', 'Now', 'several', 'things', 'once', 'drama', 'comedy', 'musical', 'sorts', 'slice', 'life', 'troubled', 'village', 'commentary', 'life', 'general', 'least', 'Lebanon', 'other', 'countries', 'nearby', 'very', 'well', 'True', 'once', 'twice', 'things', 'changed', 'too', 'quickly', 'drama', 'comedy', 'music', 'minor', 'quibble', 'plot', 'along', 'good', 'pace', 'was', 'glued', 'screen', 'see', 'how', 'everything', 'would', 'play', 'out', 'acting', 'superlative', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'highly', 'seasoned', 'professionals', 'give', 'nuanced', 'convincing', 'passionate', 'performances', 'choreography', 'cinematography', 'work', 'well', 'musical', 'score', 'film', 'too.When', 'action', 'meet', 'quite', 'few', 'people', 'Lebanese', 'village', 'isolated', 'only', 'bridge', 'badly', 'damaged', 'repair', 'traveling', 'too', 'far', 'village', 'also', 'dangerous', 'land', 'mines', 'villagers', 'are', 'hemmed', 'Fortunately', 'peace', 'Christian', 'Muslim', 'members', 'community', 'houses', 'worship', 'are', 'almost', 'side', 'side', 'just', 'one', 'house', 'mosque', 'church', 'People', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'excited', 'few', 'teenagers', 'found', 'way', 'hook', 'up', 'television', 'now', 'can', 'watch', 'programs', 'including', 'news.It', ""n't"", 'long', 'however', 'pent', 'up', 'tensions', 'begin', 'surface', 'first', 'just', 'comment', 'here', 'there', 'things', 'deteriorate', 'villagers', 'see', 'television', 'fighting', 'outside', 'Muslims', 'Christians', 'Muslim', 'Christian', 'men', 'village', 'begin', 'fight', 'women', 'oppose', 'violence', 'Things', 'begin', 'spiral', 'control', 'Muslims', 'suspect', 'Christians', 'put', 'goats', 'Mosque', 'stole', 'shoes', 'were', 'praying', 'mosque', 'Christians', 'are', 'appalled', 'angered', 'when', 'Muslim', 'man', 'statue', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'discover', 'chicken', 'blood', 'font', 'mock', 'Communion.The', 'religious', 'leaders', 'want', 'peace', 'women', 'who', 'really', 'struggle', 'make', 'happen', 'women', 'hire', 'Ukrainian', 'belly', 'dancers', 'distract', 'men', 'put', 'hashish', 'baked', 'goods', 'make', 'men', 'mellow', 'more', 'too', 'including', 'huge', 'plot', 'twist', 'end', 'film', 'left', 'impression', 'me.Look', 'superb', 'performances', 'director', 'Nadine', 'Labaki', 'who', 'Amale', 'Christian', 'woman', 'love', 'Muslim', 'Rabih', 'Julian', 'Farhat', 'Kevin', 'Abboud', 'Nassim', 'Petra', 'Saghbini', 'Rita', 'Caroline', 'Labaki', 'Ada', 'Yvonne', 'Maalouf', 'Yvonne', 'Claude', 'Baz', 'Moussawbaa', 'Takla', 'Ali', 'Haidar', 'Roukoz', 'Oxana', 'Chihane', 'Katia', 'Leyla', 'Hakim', 'Afaf', 'mentioned', 'others', 'give', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'too.Where', 'Do', 'Go', 'Now', 'poignant', 'look', 'life', 'troubled', 'Lebanese', 'village', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'hard', 'achieve', 'peace', 'warring', 'groups', 'case', 'Christians', 'Muslims', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'drama', 'cultural', 'social', 'political', 'themes', 'side', 'dish', 'comedy', 'even', 'music', 'lighten', 'things', 'up', 'Moreover', 'people', 'who', 'appreciate', 'work', 'Nadine', 'Labaki', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",Where Do We Go Now?

1515949,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B006IW8E3Y,Paul Allaer,"[33, 33]","""Where Do We Go Now?"" (2011 release from Lebanon; 100 min.) brings the fictitious story of an isolated village in Lebanon where Christians and Muslims, tired of the endless and senseless killing of/by the Christian and Muslim men, are living together more or less in peace. The opening scenes show the village women, both Christian and Muslim, marching together towards the cemetery where they put down pictures of their fallen husbands, sons and other male family members.But the peace is threatened at times, not just by petty local events such as the strange disappearance of shoes from the mosque, but more so by watching the news on the one working television in the village, showing increased tension between Muslims and Christians. The women in the village decide that they need to ease the tension by whatever means possible. To say much more of the plot would be to ruin the viewing experience of this movie, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.This is a beautiful and touching movie. Props first of all to Nadine Labaki, the director/co-writer/star of the movie (she plays one of the key women roles). It wasn't until the movie's credits roled that I realized that Labaki was one of the main performers in the movie. While at times there is a light tone to the movie, we are quickly reminded of the absurd nature of the long-held mistrust between people from different religions. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. If you are looking for a sophisticated yet entertaining foreign movie, by all means check this out.

1515952,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B006IW8E3Y,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[4, 4]","This is a French made film that was originally released as `Et maintenant on va o&ugrave;? It is set in a remote Lebanese village. Christians and Muslims live side by side in an unsteady truce. The village lacks for most modern conveniences, such as television, or links with the outside.  So some of the enterprising young men rig up a satellite dish to try to be able to get a signal, of sorts. Then news of outside events start to filter in, and the villagers realise that religious war has broken out all around them. The women folk though have seen enough death through stupid intolerance and they decide that they have collectively had enough and decide to do what ever it takes to stop their men from fighting each other.So they start by enlisting the help of both the Priest and the Imam in the on coming subterfuge. But then one act of sabotage set the men off on a tit for tat in fight that looks like snow balling out of control. The women will invent miracles, use drugs and even get the `ladies' from the gentleman's club, known as `The Paradise Palace' to entertain their men into not fighting, the question is, will it work?This is an absolute gem of a film, it is a tragi- comedy as it is both heart breaking and sombre in places. The humour is never far from the surface though and makes this feel like a breath of fresh air. There is also a love interest between a Christian and Muslim that although it may look contrived as a message for unity, it is actually used more as a vehicle for showing why people sometimes fail to get on. It has good sub titles and is in Arabic, Russian and some English. There are only excellent performances here and a warmth that takes you in from the very start. It is a film I knew very little about, but is one that should have got a lot more attention.
