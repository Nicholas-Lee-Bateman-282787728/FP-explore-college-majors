128589,A1I8F97AHES8YD,0792154436,George Graham,"[2, 3]","At a point in my high school life not too long ago, I decided to basically watch every high school/college movie I had not yet seen in hopes to find a few I could enjoy to go alongside classics like ANIMAL HOUSE and the closest we have come recently to that film, AMERICAN PIE, ROAD TRIP, and OLD SCHOOL (though none can compare, obviously). Anyway, DEAD MAN ON CAMPUS was an intriguing film, as when I watched it I laughed out loud a few times, chuckled and smiled a lot, and then returned it to its Blockbuster rental home. Soon after, the more I thought about it, the more I was surprised I really enjoyed it. It became a movie I didn't want to spend the money on to buy, but I wanted it as a gift. Finally this Christmas I got it, and upon watching it again, still enjoy it. Yes, it is often (okay, constantly) stupid humor, but the concept is so funny that you would REALLY have to try to mess this up to make it not work. The film also creates 2 likable characters, something teen movies have a hard time doing a lot of times.Anyway, the story concerns Josh (Tom Everett Scott), a 'got all As in high school' kind of guy with a 6-year med school plan at the prestigious Daleman university. Then he meets his new roommate Cooper (Mark-Paul Gosselaar, of SAVED BY THE BELL fame and with black hair, most likely to mock his blond hair from the show), a slacker stoner who is there merely because his dad owns one of the top toilet cleaning companies. Cooper and Josh strike up a friendship, however, as Cooper makes Josh meet a girl and ultimately fall behind on his studies. From there the main story starts: Josh and Cooper both fail their midterms, and Josh discovers that he needs all B+ or higher grades to keep his scholarship, while Cooper's father threatens to quit paying for his schooling and make him scrub toilets if he doesn't clean himself up. Therefore, Josh would need a series of A+++ grades, and Cooper would have to (gulp) STUDY. They find another solution, however: if your roommate kills himself, you get straight A's. Josh and Cooper don't want one another dead, and their hot-tempered Catholic school result of a roommate (a pre-FREAKS & GEEKS Jason Segel, who hooks up with Linda Cardellini, but I digress) has been staying elsewhere, so the two decide to find the most suicidal guy on campus and drive him to take his life. I guess this is where a lot of critics roll their eyes. ""These two nice guys would never try to convince someone to commit suicide,"" they say, puffing on their snooty pipes. Well, if you're desperate to get your life back on track, I've seen dramas where people do crazier things. And besides, they were suicidal BEFORE, so Josh and Cooper are just helping him along.Whatever. You already know how this ends up, as this is a comedy (one way or another, Cooper will become a better person, Josh will learn to lighten up and have fun sometimes, and only a few bodies will hit the floor). It's hard to give this movie a good review because the material could have been used in a much more clever, mature way (i.e. make the film smart and witty, not dumb, why-am-I-laughing at this), but that's why comedy is such a wide-open spectrum. I can enjoy dumb and smart comedy equally, and it certainly takes smart guys to make funny dumb comedy (Mike White was a co-writer of this film after all).",3,Some people eat bugs.

The movie is actually a lot different, though.The first thirty minutes are basically a moral story about what can happen when a college student forgets his responsibilities and stops studying. That's when the suicide plot line appears, which you've probably read in other reviews.For the next half hour, our heroes try to perfect their plan while avoiding detection. It isn't until the 60 minute mark that they meet the ""party animal"" guy - and he disappears pretty quickly. The other victims of their plot are actually funnier characters (particularly the ""Bill Gates"" guy).I'd recommend this movie as a rental, because some of the stuff later in the movie is rather funny.

128593,A1W0ODR0SK9H4R,0792154436,LeftManOut,"[0, 0]","It seems that ""Dead Man on Campus"" has always been one of those ""so-so"" movies to a lot of people. If you've seen it you're either like ""man that's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen"", or you say ""man that's one of the worst movies I've ever seen."" There appears to be no middle ground with the movie. I don't really understand why though. The movie to me has always been a comedic gem in my collection, and one that I dust off from time to time, and take a trip back into the laughs the movie can offer. ""Dead Man On Campus"" has an interesting plot, which I'm sure most of you are familiar with, and it's mainly because of its topic, which deals with suicide, that I think the movie has remained relatively cult like, and never received the attention it deserved. However if you're looking for a good laugh, and something with an entertaining, interesting plot, this is one you should most definitely check out.""Dead Man On Campus"" follows Josh (Tom Everett Scott), a bright young college freshmen ready to start his first semester at Daleman College. In the beginning Josh is all about studying and keeping up his good grades (I mean he has to maintain a B+ average to keep his scholarship!), and doesn't really take much to the social life surrounding him. Well at least at first.... Cooper (Mark Paul Gosselaar), Josh's lively roomate, quickly shows him the finer points of being in college; partying and girls. Josh quickly falls behind in his school work, and after failing all of his midterms, realizes there is now way for him to pass and keep his scholarship. Cooper's father is also threatening to take him out of college, If Cooper doesn't pass every single one of his classes. So both have pretty much given up hope, until being turned on to a loophole in the school's charter, which awards any student straight A's, whose roommate commits suicide. So Josh and Cooper must find the best candidate for the job. The jokes and laughs in the movie are hilarious. I personally find Kyle to be one of the funniest characters in the movie, with his memorable lines about jacking it to the freshmen facebook and his polite ""don't **** with my stuff"". Cliff is also a widly entertaining personality, with his constant humping of things and outlandish behavior. Tom Everett Scott and Mark Paul Gosselaar really work well together and give good performances, as well as the rest of the cast (including Allison Hannigan, and a bunch of smaller actors). There's plenty the movie has to offer, if just given a good viewing.This has been labeled as a ""black comedy"" (like I said mainly because of it's topic of trying to get a roommate to commit suicide), but that shouldn't scare anyone away. It's right up there with all the great comedies of the late 90's like Half Baked and American Pie (although nothing like either), although it's always remained relatively small. That gives it a little more sentimental value, but I'm not quite sure why this movie is so underappreciated. If you like a good laugh, some dirty jokes, and non-stop entertainment, then ""Dead Man On Campus"" is perfect for you.

Here you have Gosselaar (the old ZAK on `Saved by the Bell')  partying like crazy in college and living with Scott, who is easily  distracted by Gosselaar. Well the distractions take their toll and both  Gosselaar and Scott are headed for collegiate non-return status, when they  hear the 4.0 story. Now if you have been on a college campus as long as I  have, you will come across a great deal of students who claim this is true  and that it has happened to a friend of theirs at some college...well, you  are mistaken..it never happened and never will.

Thankfully it was exactly what I expected - a pleasant comedy full of idiotic jokes and lame humor with flashes of greatness, but nothing too distracting.I had interest in watching this movie awhile back as the dead-roommate-straight-As was one of the only urban legends that I actaully believed. While I'm glad i didn't spend money in the movie theater for it, I'm still happy to have seen it. The characters are cliched, the situations are pretty standard, and everything is the way you expect it to be. Not that that is bad but it could have been better. The Frat Boy from hell character is just not up to John Belushi of Animal House standards (then again, who is?) and the conspiracy theory freak is pretty tame.However, the goth rock star who acts like a depressed brit in public but happily sings showtunes in private is hilarious. I think it's probably because I've alternately hated and loved the kind of music (Cure, Peter Murphy,etc.) parodied by the song &quot;Tragic Sperm&quot; that I was giggling through those scenes. Besides, revelations that Robert Smith is now an overweight drunk football fan make that character all the more believable. Sadly that character is only on screen for about 15 minutes total.

Josh enrolls via a scholarship, and is studying to become a doctor, and Cooper, well, he's just there to avoid having to clean toilets for a living at his father's business, and of course, to goof off and party. Josh eventually decides to party with Cooper, and as a result, starts to fail every class he's in. He winds up failing his mid-terms, and he finds out that he needs to maintain a B+ average if he wants to keep his scholarship.One night, while the boys are at a local bar, they find out that if your roomate commits suicide, you get straight As for your grief, so they decide to move a suicidal roommate into their dorm!In my opinion, the best roommate they find is a no holds barred psychotic named Cliff O'Malley (played by the underrated Lochlyn Munro). Cliff is my favorite character in this film! He's so wacky, and he completely lacks sanity or a conscience! Most of his dialogue and facial expressions in this film is priceless! I'd list a few quotes, but I'm sure Amazon will bleep 'em out!As for their other roomates:Buckley: He's a computer nerd who's paranoid, suicidal, and thinks Bill Gates is after his brain!Matt Noonan: He's the ""depressed"" goth rock star who acts happy and likes to sing show tunes when no one's around!In the end: This is one of the most underrated teen stoner flicks ever! For off the wall teen comedies, this is as good as it gets, right up there with ""Wayne's World"" and ""A Night At The Roxbury"". This movie originally bombed at the box office when released in August of 1998, and seems to be forgotten nowadays, but trust me, it's funny, and the character Cliff totally makes it worth the admission!
