100654,A2CRUETJKX1WA5,0790733226,absent_minded_prof,"[3, 4]","This movie stands head and shoulders above most science fiction.  I was really moved by it when it came out...  Before I forget, I want to recommend looking at &quot;Carl Sagan: A Life&quot; by Keay Davidson, or at &quot;Black Holes and Time Warps&quot; by Kip Thorne.  Both have some discussion of this movie -- Kip Thorne's discussion mostly has to do with Carl Sagan consulting him about the wormhole idea, but still.  Or, for more about the Drake Equation, look in your copy of Michael Crichton's &quot;Sphere&quot;.This movie captures the excitement of astronomy, and the feel of SETI-like programs, to a &quot;T&quot;.  Jodie Foster is terrific -- I wonder if she considers this one of her better roles.  I hope so, because she blew me away.  Tom Skerrit plays a complete jerk, which is sort of a stretch for him, as he generally seems to get more solid, midwestern-American-values sorts of roles...  He does a good job though.  Rob Lowe has a minor but interesting part, as the movie's version of the real-life Ralph Reed -- look it up, seriously, that guy is worth knowing more about.  Also, Angela Bassett plays a powerful African American woman with her usual aplomb.  She brings a lot of intelligence and vividness to her part.  James Woods is pretty terrific too -- I would give a lot to hear his input on various scenes, he's no dummy, science-wise, as a real-life M.I.T. graduate.The excitement of science is what you walk away from this movie feeling.  So often scientists in movies are &quot;mad scientists&quot;, or maybe an action movie hero type with a slightly introspective streak.  Jodie Foster's character is an atheist, a scientist, and of course a woman, but she makes a great heroine.  Generally this movie just rocks, and rocks hard.  I imagine that Carl Sagan would have considered this a fantastic curtain call, before he left this planet.

You've watched six shows, at most, on PBS. Sesame Street, Are You Being Served, Monty Python's Flying Circus, The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy, Red Dwarf, and Cosmos with Carl Sagan. If you're brighter than me, throw in The McNeil-Lehrer Report or its sequel. But that's it.Why COSMOS? Well, if I type ""billions and billions"" in quotes, you hear his voice in your head. Yes you do. The man made astronomy interesting because he was a wordsmith.CONTACT is a novel by Carl Sagan. Copyright 1985, which works for me. I read it when it was new. Back in my security guard days, down in Tampa Florida. (Yo Bob!) I later saw the film, very well done, with Jodie Foster, but I can't remember it. One of the advantages of getting old.How does the book stand the test of time? So well that I'm gonna recommend you get it right now. Of course the science is spot on, since this is Carl Sagan. If we ever do hear from somebody not of this earth, this is how it'll happen. But that's a given. What's easy to forget is that Sagan gave us some very well-drawn characters from his world in an eminently readable style. And, as always, accessible science that makes you marvel at the possibilities. Keep in mind that I've probably never used the word ""marvel"" in a book or movie review before. I'm too old and jaded to marvel. But heck, I marveled.As if that weren't enough, he had so much fun predicting the future. This far down the road, we can see where he misfired, which was almost never. We can enjoy how accurate he often was. This is where he let his subtle humor roam free, and we can love him for his wit. These are the traits I didn't catch 20 years ago, because I was looking for aliens. Which he also delivers, somewhat, but I don't even care at this point. I just know I love this book.And yes, the DVD as well, which is good since that's what I'm supposed to be reviewing here.  The DVD is true to the book, so of course it's excellent.

I looked forward to seeing the science team interact, detect, and piece together the alien signals.  Sadly, the intelligent characters were cast aside and the plot moved to  Washington, D.C., not known as a mecca for bold, original thinkers.With  all the richness and possibilities inherent in cinema, I was frustrated to  witness so many scenes revolving around TV news screens and the lingering  reaction shots of the cast.  Great scientific discoveries were being made,  but the director chose to show the characters having dull meetings and  watching TV.  &quot;Contact&quot; was weighed down by sappy music  throughout.It wasn't possible to take &quot;Contact&quot; seriously  after the tedious second act.  The main character was diminished by the  filmmakers' unimaginative reliance on crudely caricatured antagonists.  The  sets and special effects were well done, but there was no need to dwell on  them.Big Moments happened every 7 minutes, and the story's power was  diluted by the time Dr. Arroway began the space voyage.

100657,A3QP8RGAUPF2OS,0790733226,"A Customer ""Vicarious sycophants will abuse t...","[0, 15]","`Revision..Not Concision'..Too Busy Planning the Y2K/9-11 Demolitions  Part IOriginally, review of this movie found some fault with the short shrift given to the novel's breathtaking resolution.  Usually the movie based on a book should at least attempt to preserve that, but it was mathematical, not unlike the computer models so excellently done in the movie--so it's debatable there were other motivations to further dumb down the content.  Computer graphics are ok, just don't give people any ideas; and that's roughly the paranoid police state's continuing theme from movie to movie.  So paranoid in fact, former head of creativity for Walt Disney Company Eric Hazeltine headed up a Discover magazine round table with American mathematics leaders to discuss no longer teaching long division in the public schools (9/'02).  The point is, he was also a figure in the NSA meddling by some `association', thus we have a connected set of reciprocating facts surrounding what Sen. J. W. Fullbright called, ""The Pentagon Propaganda Machine"", largely channeled through the movies.So it's all about this idea of using cybernetic controls to pose as an alien threat, or the ultimate hack into human consciousness or tool for propagating torture and psychological conditioning on the population called Quantum Information and Communications (many titles are in the university library).  And of course it has to have exclusive control over Artificial Intelligence, rumored to have begun development under DARPA way back in the 50s.  Noam Chomsky tries not to allude to it very much, unsuccessfully, in his book ""Language and Problems of Knowledge"".  The brain is sort of a language processor, so better look out for that character.  Thus, the public is condescended to in this film quite miserably; I was expecting less overacting and more science.  I guess any theater company's rendition of `Trouble in Tahiti' is going to disappoint some of the audience by a wide margin, or fail to capture many important elements of the story.  Certainly the effort to push Shakespearian English on the modern drama goes without question as the worst form of retro.  So when we go to the movies, expectations should consider anything possible.  I guess it wasn't so bad...except for the effort at incorporating docudrama...with news coverage and Clinton's Mars Rock tape.  That got off subject by confusing current events with a science fiction story.  Of course the San Diego cult's execution has nothing whatsoever to do with any of this, or that viewing technology misrepresented in ""Quantum Gravity"" by Lee Smolin, or that other industry promo by Spielberg in `Minority Report'.What can be done?  Any book is going to drive the movie projector and production of the imagination about 10 times better than a movie ever will or ever could.  This is why motion picture propaganda is so easily filleted.  (Take for instance the continent hopping, double murder insurance scam in `Flight Plan'--and other unsophisticated macho pieces) Movies are a kind of opiate for the masses, they're literally feeding off their sponsor's desperate desires to condescend and intimidate, pride in playing everyone for a fool, and more importantly a serious propaganda problem of a warfare level of escalation, such as the movie `The Forgotten' which tries to blame missing persons (like the prior movie) and modern disasters on aliens.  Is extraterrestrial intelligence an important question for concern? It certainly is so far as the evasion of crime under such a ridiculous proxy to condition public passivity.  Does it lend itself to any practical context with the down to earth?  I doubt it.  And the reason is actually more curiously redirected to the question...it is comprising more offshoot entertainment themes that posit a different universe or a different consciousness than was expected...movies like `The Matrix', `CUBE', `THX', `Planet of the Apes' or allegorical time travel settings.  So who knows?  It doesn't interest as much as it used to, the bigger questions of course being the unceasing war on many levels between the various cultures of human beings, and not short of arriving in the American daily life.  Science fiction has always been a social prospectus or blueprint for great dreams of beyond even urban planning, as have terrorist political movements always envisioned since earlier in the 20th Century.  Then here we are right where it's thinking nothing of clearing the way, i.e. building demolitions and war spawned genocides.Let's take a look at one thing that was brought up in the earlier review, that being the oddity of the crop circles and elaborate glyphs.  That certainly hints at a sign extraterrestrial presence maybe.  Because you know, science and technology are not a static thing.  In the 1950s diplomacy attempted to shake the earth in the South Pacific with hundred of enormous hydrogen bomb blasts, so called testing that was more a race of saber rattling...and of course its high aloft radioactive fallout disintegrated enough tri atomic oxygen to form the ozone hole...a fact that has to hide behind a courtesy screen in a book title like ""Ozone Diplomacy"".  The `official science' doesn't add up, contrasting the Northern polar region's allegedly intact ozone layer where all the industrial CFCs were produced after all, and by the way, all the ozone from tailpipes of millions of automobiles at the same time.See the unsettling conclusion to the review on the soundtrack....",3,`Revision..Not Concision'..Too Busy Planning the Y2K/9-11 Demolitions  (Part

100659,AHL35XZ3OND2Z,0790733226,Adron Gardner,"[3, 18]","Before I review this film, I am going to say this. If you haven't seen this film - don't. Track down Disney's 80s made-for-cable ""Flight of the Navigator"" and be happy with a bowl of popcorn on a Saturday night. But if you must...Contact is a difficult film to review. Based on Carl Sagan's serenade novel to the stars, the ambitious, and occasionally moving, story of Ellie Arroway taps into the romance of stargazing but fails to explore the larger implications of the Pandoras Box it opens. Like a black sheep family member, I really can't hate this film, but it is also so difficult to love it.In many ways Contact is a concept film - a ""what if"" statement on a slice of Kubrick's 2001: A Spacey Odyssey. ""What if"" somebody made an entire film on somebody discovering the monolith from 2001? ""What if"" the monolith and signal is a radio transmission telling us how to construct an advanced piece of technology? ""What if"" we ditch the stark soundtrack of deep breathing sounds and add pulsing radio transmissions, romance and a sad story of a little girl losing her dad? This is the movie Contact is. On paper, it all sounds so interesting, but somehow it all goes very wrong.Jodie Foster invests heavily in Ellie and so does the audience. She is stubborn, driven and also charismatic. What I am not persuaded by is the script's tacky father-daughter story laced so sloppily into the plot. What I feel, is there is a greater story to be mined here, but the father-daughter angle rings hollow. John Hurt is wasted as a Yoda inspired bald genius and every other character in the film seems recycled from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest institution staff. There are too many villains and the only supporting character with more than one dimension is Matthew McConaughey.  This is one of those movies where everybody is crazy and evil but Ellie.  Everybody knows better than Ellie - they know so much better, they do everything she says and in the end, still make her think she is crazy. Ellie discovers the sound, Ellie discovers the bomber, Ellie...well you get the idea.  All the males are paper cut out bastards and little old Ellie is the perpetual victim.  It is one of those movies where you are continually frustrated by the contrived characterizations and idiocy of the characters and writing rather than engaging into the story.  Yes it is one of those movies.The film is based largely on the idea and euphoria of discovery, but the film offers so little of it. Director Robert Zemeckis tries desperately to resolve questions about aliens and religion within the social conscious, but instead we are given long lectures, congressional testimonials and emotional schlock more fitting to the Young and the Restless. Like a bad episode to the TV series LOST, there are many exciting ideas in Contact but they end up flushed by filmmakers and writers who are afraid to take on these ideas, or even any of Carl Sagan's ingenuity or conjectures from the novel, with any seriousness or dedication. The filmmakers take the easy way out and play out melodrama instead of insight.  The novel's intricate plot is ditched for a ""are you kidding me?"" laugh-out-loud ""alien"" beach rendezvous and intelligent writing is ditched in favor of teary-eyed soliloquy to tug at your heart strings. The search for intelligent life in movies continues.The finality doesn't do justice to Ellie Arroway any of the deep ideas proposed by the plot or ultimately to the intelligence of the audience. There is, however, one brief redemption. There is a moment in the film where Ellie is lying in the Plains of San Augustin under the VLA telescope listening to static. This is when the first pulse of the alien signal hits. Ellie's eyes grow large and so do ours. It is an incredible epoch. It is the only moment in the two and a half hour film where Contact actually makes some.",2,White Noise,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,3857,"['review', 'film', 'am', 'going', 'say', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'Track', 'down', 'Disney', '80s', 'made-for-cable', 'Flight', 'Navigator', 'be', 'happy', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'Saturday', 'night', 'must', 'Contact', 'difficult', 'film', 'review', 'Based', 'Carl', 'Sagan', 'serenade', 'novel', 'stars', 'ambitious', 'occasionally', 'moving', 'story', 'Ellie', 'Arroway', 'romance', 'stargazing', 'fails', 'explore', 'larger', 'implications', 'Pandoras', 'Box', 'black', 'sheep', 'family', 'member', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hate', 'film', 'also', 'so', 'difficult', 'love', 'it.In', 'many', 'ways', 'Contact', 'concept', 'film', 'what', 'statement', 'slice', 'Kubrick', '2001', 'Spacey', 'Odyssey', 'What', 'somebody', 'made', 'entire', 'film', 'somebody', 'discovering', 'monolith', '2001', 'What', 'monolith', 'signal', 'radio', 'transmission', 'telling', 'how', 'construct', 'advanced', 'piece', 'technology', 'What', 'ditch', 'stark', 'soundtrack', 'deep', 'breathing', 'sounds', 'add', 'pulsing', 'radio', 'transmissions', 'romance', 'sad', 'story', 'little', 'girl', 'losing', 'dad', 'movie', 'Contact', 'paper', 'so', 'interesting', 'somehow', 'very', 'wrong.Jodie', 'Foster', 'invests', 'heavily', 'Ellie', 'so', 'audience', 'stubborn', 'driven', 'also', 'charismatic', 'What', 'am', 'not', 'persuaded', 'script', 'tacky', 'father-daughter', 'story', 'laced', 'so', 'sloppily', 'plot', 'What', 'feel', 'greater', 'story', 'be', 'mined', 'here', 'father-daughter', 'angle', 'rings', 'hollow', 'John', 'Hurt', 'wasted', 'Yoda', 'inspired', 'bald', 'genius', 'other', 'character', 'film', 'recycled', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'institution', 'staff', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'villains', 'only', 'supporting', 'character', 'more', 'one', 'dimension', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'everybody', 'crazy', 'evil', 'Ellie', 'Everybody', 'better', 'Ellie', 'know', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'do', 'everything', 'end', 'still', 'make', 'think', 'crazy', 'Ellie', 'sound', 'Ellie', 'bomber', 'Ellie', 'well', 'get', 'idea', 'males', 'are', 'paper', 'cut', 'out', 'bastards', 'little', 'old', 'Ellie', 'perpetual', 'victim', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'are', 'continually', 'frustrated', 'contrived', 'characterizations', 'idiocy', 'characters', 'writing', 'rather', 'engaging', 'story', 'Yes', 'one', 'movies.The', 'film', 'based', 'largely', 'idea', 'euphoria', 'discovery', 'film', 'offers', 'so', 'little', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'desperately', 'resolve', 'questions', 'aliens', 'religion', 'social', 'conscious', 'instead', 'are', 'given', 'long', 'lectures', 'congressional', 'testimonials', 'emotional', 'schlock', 'more', 'fitting', 'Young', 'Restless', 'bad', 'episode', 'TV', 'series', 'LOST', 'are', 'many', 'exciting', 'ideas', 'Contact', 'end', 'up', 'flushed', 'filmmakers', 'writers', 'who', 'are', 'afraid', 'take', 'ideas', 'even', 'Carl', 'Sagan', 'ingenuity', 'conjectures', 'novel', 'seriousness', 'dedication', 'filmmakers', 'take', 'easy', 'way', 'play', 'out', 'melodrama', 'instead', 'insight', 'novel', 'intricate', 'plot', 'ditched', 'are', 'kidding', 'laugh-out-loud', 'alien', 'beach', 'rendezvous', 'intelligent', 'writing', 'ditched', 'favor', 'teary-eyed', 'soliloquy', 'tug', 'heart', 'strings', 'search', 'intelligent', 'life', 'movies', 'continues.The', 'finality', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'Ellie', 'Arroway', 'deep', 'ideas', 'proposed', 'plot', 'ultimately', 'intelligence', 'audience', 'however', 'one', 'brief', 'redemption', 'moment', 'film', 'where', 'Ellie', 'lying', 'Plains', 'San', 'Augustin', 'VLA', 'telescope', 'listening', 'static', 'when', 'first', 'pulse', 'alien', 'signal', 'hits', 'Ellie', 'eyes', 'grow', 'large', 'so', 'do', 'ours', 'incredible', 'epoch', 'only', 'moment', 'two', 'half', 'hour', 'film', 'where', 'Contact', 'actually']",Contact

While that is part of the reason that I gave this movie 5 stars, I was even more  impressed by the director's ability to catch a glimpse of what can be the  dog-eat-dog world of scientific funding, credit and credibility.Jodi  Foster plays a brilliant, budding young scientist who wants to pursue SETI  (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) work.  Her former mentor (Tom  Skerritt), now head of the National Science Foundation (the government's  primary funding agency for science), sees that work as professional  suicide.  He then does what he can to pull the rug out from under her and  her work.  In the meantime, Foster meets McConaughey, a handsome ex-priest  who seeks truth not via science, but through spirituality.When Foster  recognizes that contact is taking place and she makes that information  public, Skerritt swoops in and attempts to take control of the project.I  am extremely impressed by this movie's ability to tell a great story of a  possibility, presenting the premis of non-confrontational contact.  This is  no shoot-em up movie.  It does, however, have a healthy dose of special  effects, but those effects are not the heart of the show.There are  interesting plot developments, instructive insights into the lengths that  some scientists may go to gain recognition among their professional peers,  and the conflict that some scientists face when they realize that there are  more ways to learn about who we are and why we are than via science.I  encourage you to give this movie a look.

The photography in ""Contact"" is very detailed.

Ellie developing a sexual relationship with Palmer was really corny. I saw this movie once years ago, years before reading the book and I liked it alot then. But I just read the book a couple weeks ago, so I went back and bought this movie and realized how much they actually changed... for the worse.The main thing that troubles me with this film is the theological aspects. I'm an atheist (I wasn't when I first watched the movie years ago, so I didn't catch all the religious overtones at first) and I felt kind of slighted at the treatment of the source material. The way they made Ellie seem like a bad person for being an atheist. Granted, in the real world that is likely how it would've played out, but I can't help but feel this movie had more of a pro-religion agenda.The worst part of the film was definately the ending... If they had followed the book directly, the ending would've been much more dynamic. They also definately should've kept S.R. Hadden's ending. It was so cool, but instead in the book we just see S.R. Hadden's dead body being wrapped up. The book's ending was definately ten times more satisfying than the movie version's.

I feel as though I am constantly told throughout the movie that ""science is great but don't loose your faith"".  This whole movie would be better served as the novel originally did not choosing a side and merely posing philosophical ideas that sometimes conflict and leaving the audience to debates these different ideas among themselves.

CONTACT is based on a book by Carl Sagan, and I approached it with caution but interest. It was a wonderful film to see on the big screen and of course lost some of that power in the transfer to your TV set. That aside, the transfer is GREAT and the sound-especially if you have DD 5.1 (I believe there is a DTS version as well) -is fantastic. The extras are actually interesting here; I really loved the explanation of the computer animated sequence for the opening of the picture. The other menu items are also interesting.Knowing Sagan's proclivities, I figured there would be a strong 'bash on religious thought' undercurrent to the film. I was pleased to see that that was not the case. The monumental issues of faith and science were *generally* dealt with respectfully. I did find Matthew M's character (former man of the cloth Palmer Joss) to be an interesting foil for Jodie Foster, SETI scientist, answering her pointed questions with even more thought-provoking statements like ""Prove it."" I appreciated that because, in fact, the naturalist/rationalist is at the same pains to support their ideologies. But I digress... Perhaps the most interesting point to the entire film is the way in which Foster's doubting character is forced to defend herself in the face of evidence that she imagined the entire experience. This alone leads me to believe that the entire purpose of the film is to tell the story of one person's transformation from skeptic to surprised and berated believer. How interesting...On the other hand, the preacher has no problem sleeping with Jodie Foster which was more than a bit strange, and the film's consistant portrayal of religious followers/leaders as morons and lunatics (Busey) grated on me after a while. Ugh. How tiring. How a number of reviewers can claim that this film was some sort of religious propaganda is *beyond* me.  Outside of 'Palmer Joss' the 'religious' characters are anything but likeable.  In the end, the film was still very good and well worth seeing despite these issues. It remains a powerful film with amazing originality.  The effects are wonderful, the displays of CNN crew and President Clinton effective at first, then a bit annoying.  Finally, to answer the question 'What was the point of having Jodie Foster travel all that way to meet her father?'  Uh, I think the reasons for that are obvious:1)  To prove to some of the numbskull film audience out there that perhaps not everything in life is not tied up with a ribbon as nicely as we want it to be.2)  The fact that perhaps this alien culture tailors these trips to the individual making them-and they knew that Foster's character had unfinished business with her father.3)  Plus, rather than overloading Foster's character, they presented themselves in a pleasing form.

100684,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,0790733226,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","CONTACT is an excellent sci-fier based on a Carl Sagan story and directed by Bob Zemeckis that deftly considers not only the possibility of life elsewhere but also both sides of the eternal debate on whether there's a Divine Being.It stars Jodie Foster as a scientist who tenaciously clings to her SETI explorations despite obstacles and resistance from her boss (Tom Skerritt). Just before the plug is pulled and Foster's Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence team is evicted from Socorro, NM's Very Large Array radio astronomy observatory, they get a hit. Monitored signals originating from the Vega constellation send a mix that includes a 1936 TV broadcast from Nazi Germany of the Berlin Olympics, the first high-powered signals of such a type. These apparently took 26 years to reach Vega, and 26 years to be bounced back.Not as a criticism of the plot, but this raises a question in my mind. I know little of physics, so it'll probably sound as dumb as I am on the subject. If there's nothing in the universe that's perpetual, including energy, how can a radiowave, which is a sort of energy (yes?), travel billions of miles without dissipating?Anyway, news of this discovery brings out the lunatic fringe, each group converging on Socorro, all with different agendas. Most amusing are the Chevy Vega car clubs; most frightening, some scruffy Neo-Nazis and a raving ""end-of-the-world"" proselytizer.When sub-frequncies are unscrambled and a language decoded, scientists are able to construct a one-person craft (from instructions sent by an unknown ET) that will instantly transport a passenger across the universe. Unseen events occur and Jodie is the one selected to make this voyage.A ""traveling through a wormhole"" sequence is terrific and quite scary. Jodie arrives safely on a planet somewhere in Vega. The next scene is so obviously foreshadowed early in the film the alert viewer is expecting it, and yet I found the experience to be very emotionally stimulating. In hindsight, it occurred to me that we were SUPPOSED to know what's coming. Not being caught off-guard is what makes the moment so satisfying.Bottom line is: I love this movie.

Apparently I'm not alone. Other reviewers have brought up a number of good reasons for their enthusiasm. Reasons such as top-notch acting, a thoughtful and thought-provoking story, and dramatic moments like the initial appearance of the alien signal and the destruction of the alien device.I'm on board with all of these observations. In particular, the intelligent treatment of the controversy that erupts over the human response is plausible. This is a more thoughtful scifi movie than most (not to take anything away from space operas), and that's a good thing. Beyond this, however, there are some things in CONTACT that are special for me that haven't been noted by others.First, there's the opening sequence. It begins with a view of earth floating in space. From there the camera seemingly falls away at an accelerating pace, zooming past the other planets in our solar system, flying backward to a position looking back at the Milky Wat galaxy. It's a breath-taking sequence and the DVD is worth having just for that alone.Then, there's the great scene when Jodie Foster's character enters the capsule and waits to go wherever she's going. ""Good to go"", she keeps repeating. ""I'm good to go."" I can never watch this part of CONTACT without reflecting on what a terrifying yet exhilarating moment that would be. Foster's character has no idea where she's going (if she goes at all) or what she'll find when she gets there. It's the moment she's waited her whole life for, but she's facing the ultimate unknown. The scene is, for me, an incredible one and I never tire of seeing it.Finally, the trip Dr. Arroway finally goes on is visually gorgeous and emotionally satisfying. What happens is very much open to debate, but the journey is eye candy from beginning to end.

Both fields seek meaning in this life and both ultimately end in a mystery.  So too this movie.  Jodie Foster is brilliant as a scientist who longs for meaning even in the midst of her scientific endeavors.  This movie is big all the way around.  Rather than highbrow entertainment we are drawn to the characters and really feel the character Jodie Foster portrays.My only criticism is the pseudo-religious character played by Matthew McConaughey which is a more sterilized version of presenting the religious element.  But the religious element is necessary to make the whole thing work or it becomes just another sci-fi flick.  Perhaps in places the movie is a bit over the top but in the end it works.Visually the film is remarkable.  It is not overladen with special effect but the special effects that are present are dynamite.

The intelligence of this film - especially compared to the garbage shown daily - is just stunning  Jodie Foster has said about the heroine that it was the closest any character had gotten in representing her spirit. That is an outstanding compliment considering the main character is based on a real-life scientist and the movie shows her as skeptic, searcher and explorer.The movie and the book have been compared both favorably and unfavorably but that should not be the case.  Both are excellent representations of their particular genre. The best one can say about their relationship is that the movie effectively captured the spirit of the book - if not exactly following the storyline.CONTACT has been called science-fiction for &quot;thinkers&quot; and it is void of much of what is seen in current films of this type - no action-packed space shootouts, no morphing monsters, no aliens using ESP or advanced technology.  No, it is instead a quiet demonstration, as the main character states, that we as a race are so small and so insignificant and so precious when viewed in the background of the Universe. It is continually surprising, the plot consistently logical, the characters always &quot;in character&quot;.  It is one of the best portrayals of scientists and their work with all the bickering, fighting, jealousy and in the end, awe upon discovering Nature's secrets.Philosophically, it asks many questions.  The book deals more forcefully with the role of superstition and religion as it relates to scientific ventures.  Indeed, both the book and movie go to great lengths to explain that science does not demand blind obedience and is constantly challenged and tested in its assumptions and theorems.

Deeply embedded in the story and the visual images and even certain lines of dialog is the spirit of Carl Sagan. He lives forever in the changes he brought about in his world.Jodie Foster plays Dr. Ellie Arroway, who is passionately pursuing SETI - the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence. As you probably know, lots of people consider it a huge waste of time, and lots more consider it a security risk. Then there are those who consider it blasphemy. All these viewpoints are represented in the film, along with the courage of scientific research and liberal theology. The latter is represented by Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey, quite delicious), religious philosopher and writer, and Ellie's lover and number one fan.Her number one financial backer is a mysterious billionaire named Dr. S.R.Haddon, a colorful figure to say the least, who made me think of Captain Nemo. He lives in an airplane, and seldom lands it. Her primary nemesis is Dr. David Drumlin, who first has her funding cut and then, when she finds unmistakably artificial signals, takes credit for the project and hogs the limelight.I'm not going to spoil too much in telling you that the signal includes detailed plans to build some sort of machine, nobody is quite sure what it's supposed to do. But a great deal is made of the fact that it seems like a vehicle of some sort, and only room for one person. Who will represent the entire human race to some completely unknown aliens? The government sets up a commission to make the decision, and Palmer Joss, as a close friend of President Clinton's (who appears in the movie, presumably with carefully edited stock footage), is included in the commission. Does he pick Ellie to go, knowing she may well not survive, or not be able to come back, or come back something over 50 years later, not having aged appreciably while he becomes an old man? She wants to go so very much, but then so do quite a few other qualified scientists, and also Dr. David Drumlin, Mr. Limelight Hog.The reasons for the commission's decision may depress the heck out of you; they did me. The stunning act of sabotage that threatens the whole mission is also depressingly realistic. In fact, good parts and bad, this movie is disturbingly realistic.

I can't think of any other reason that &quot;Contact&quot; wasn't resoundingly laughed out of bookstores, much less theaters. I know my friends and I were reduced to helpless tears halfway through.The very notion that Jodie Foster is listening to the various frequencies that SETI is scanning for signs of extraterrestrial life is foolish enough, but then the flaws are compounded by repeated improbable meetings with priest Matthew McConaughey. Apparently, his character's dialogue with Foster's is supposed to be thought-provoking and challenging. Apparently, the screenwriters have never actually had a thought-provoking or challenging conversation.The payoff to all this foolish mumbo-jumbo is a machine the alien message provides for communicating with them, followed by actual contact. Sagan boldly goes where few esteemed figures have gone before, and rips off John Varley's novel &quot;The Ophiuchi Hotline&quot; for the idea of the aliens giving out plans for an interstellar communication device.

Jodie Foster, one of our finest actresses, is at her best here.  She captures all the subtleties of a highly complex and engaging character.

Matthew McConaughey portrays another quite subtle character and he also never misses a note as ""a man of the cloth"" who transcends the usual limits of such a character.  To fully appreciate the direction and photography, be sure to watch the extra commentaries included in the DVD.  Robert Zemeckis convinces us of his genius (without trying).

I felt that she portrayed her character well, particularly where she had to use her imagination in the scenes where she is experiencing and seeing things that are supposed to be indescribable. I thought she was masterful in expression of emotion.The rest of the characters were predictable and cheesy, however. I did not appreciate how the religious figures, except for one, were portrayed as hick, &uuml;berconservative obstructionists or fanatical, evil, and insane martyrs. Not very believable characters. I will say again, cheesy and predictable. The supporting actors were more believable (ex. president's secretary). Being LDS, I rolled my eyes at the reference to the fanatical preacher being from Utah. It was also a stretch in the plot to have a Howard W. Hughes figure in S.R. Hadden. His role in forwarding the plot was essential, but it was a bit silly to watch the Hughes eccentricity replicated.This was just an interesting premise by Carl Sagan and it shows that scientists indeed must have creativity in their field. I'm glad that Sagan stuck with science and did not continue to write books. The movie is good for Foster's acting and good for pretty good entertainment. Pop the popcorn and watch it.

I can't remember any science-fiction film after 2001: A Space Odyssey to be this thought-provoking, and while Contact is not quite as profound a statement as the aforementioned opus, it still has quite a lot to say for itself. Jodie Foster plays an earnest scientist who spends her whole life searching for extra-terrestrial life and finds vindication when a message is received from outer space. Naturally, it throws the world into a huge frenzy, and despite the efforts of kitschy bad guy Tom Skerritt and military operations-head James Woods, she gets to go on a journey to the heart of the universe and see whether or not she can find the answers she's looking for.  Perhaps it's a little hokey, but I found myself totally captivated throughout the whole film, and the adventure Foster goes through in the last third of the picture is one of the most thrilling sequences in the films of 1997 (not the least because Foster, surrounded by all these new worlds she's viewing, can act the scene to pieces, which is amazing considering the fact that we know she really sat in front of a blue-screen for two weeks).

100718,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,0790733226,Brian Driver,"[0, 0]","This is one of my favorite movies OF ALL TIME. It's a movie about science, religion, faith, love, first contact, fanaticism, politics, money, genius, and intolerance.  It's a thoughtful film that's not afraid to confront not only what it might feel like to communicate with an alien race, but whether we are mature enough to handle such an event.I won't describe the plot--enough reviews have done that already. Here are, however, the reasons I think you will love this movie:1) IT'S A THRILLING ADVENTURE STORY: There is tension present throughout this movie, some of it represented by the big questions below, but a lot of it is because of the excitement of discovery. When early on in the movie radio astronomer Ellie Arroway (Jodi Foster) receives the radio signal from outside our galaxy, the movie kicks into high gear. Not only are they hustling to clarify the message signal, but they also have to decode it to discover an amazing set of what appear to be BLUEPRINTS...but for what?2) IT HAS A GREAT PEDIGREE: The original book is by scientist Carl Sagan, and it went through many changes in its almost decade-long development.  Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Flight,Cast Away,Forrest Gump, andGothika), it has quite a cast: besides Foster, there's Matthew McConaughey, James Woods, Tom Skerritt, William Fichtner, John Hurt and Angela Bassett - all in top form.3) IT ASKS BIG QUESTIONS: What will happen to individuals, the country, and the world, when we finally contact alien life?  Are we mature enough as a society not to go off the deep end? How will discovery of another intelligent species change our attitude about God, Heaven, and our place within His universe? How will our political system react to science issues concerning national security?4) IT TAKES SCIENCE AND RELIGION SERIOUSLY: It's rare that a movie, or book, treats both of these subjects with care and sincerity. While the plot includes religious zealots who are definitely there to derail any somber efforts to follow the blueprints, McConaughey's Father Palmer is portrayed with genuine intelligence. This is NOT the McConaughey who so frequently plays the stoner dude in so many movies - no, this is the sober actor who once in a while gives us the potential he inA Time to Kill,FrailtyandThe Lincoln Lawyer [HD]. His Father Palmer is an advisor to the President, and it's a role that really lends gravity to the religious side of the discovery. I'm not especially religious, but I'm open enough to have movies portray religion at its best in order to increase the seriousness of the debate.Note: As for drawbacks, the movie does run a little long, and there is one plot development late in the film - I won't spoil it here, but it involves a backup plan that comes out of nowhere - that defies credulity. But they're just tiny flaws in the masterpiece, as they say, and in no way hurt this terrific, wonderful, intellectual movie.",5,An Enlightening Intellectual and Philosophical Adventure,1365897600,"04 14, 2013",2013,2914,"['one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'TIME', 'movie', 'science', 'religion', 'faith', 'love', 'first', 'contact', 'fanaticism', 'politics', 'money', 'genius', 'intolerance', 'thoughtful', 'film', 'not', 'afraid', 'confront', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'might', 'feel', 'communicate', 'alien', 'race', 'are', 'mature', 'enough', 'handle', 'event.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'describe', 'plot', 'enough', 'reviews', 'have', 'done', 'already', 'Here', 'are', 'however', 'reasons', 'think', 'will', 'love', 'movie:1', 'IT', 'A', 'THRILLING', 'ADVENTURE', 'STORY', 'tension', 'present', 'movie', 'represented', 'big', 'questions', 'lot', 'excitement', 'discovery', 'When', 'early', 'movie', 'radio', 'astronomer', 'Ellie', 'Arroway', 'Jodi', 'Foster', 'radio', 'signal', 'galaxy', 'movie', 'high', 'gear', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'hustling', 'clarify', 'message', 'signal', 'also', 'have', 'decode', 'discover', 'amazing', 'set', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'BLUEPRINTS', 'what', '2', 'IT', 'A', 'GREAT', 'PEDIGREE', 'original', 'book', 'scientist', 'Carl', 'Sagan', 'went', 'many', 'changes', 'almost', 'decade-long', 'development', 'Directed', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'Flight', 'Cast', 'Away', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'andGothika', 'quite', 'cast', 'besides', 'Foster', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'James', 'Woods', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'top', 'form.3', 'IT', 'ASKS', 'BIG', 'QUESTIONS', 'What', 'will', 'happen', 'individuals', 'country', 'world', 'when', 'finally', 'contact', 'alien', 'life', 'Are', 'mature', 'enough', 'society', 'not', 'go', 'off', 'deep', 'end', 'How', 'will', 'discovery', 'intelligent', 'species', 'change', 'attitude', 'God', 'Heaven', 'place', 'universe', 'How', 'will', 'political', 'system', 'react', 'science', 'issues', 'concerning', 'national', 'security', '4', 'IT', 'TAKES', 'SCIENCE', 'AND', 'RELIGION', 'SERIOUSLY', 'rare', 'movie', 'book', 'subjects', 'care', 'sincerity', 'plot', 'religious', 'zealots', 'who', 'are', 'definitely', 'there', 'derail', 'somber', 'efforts', 'follow', 'blueprints', 'McConaughey', 'Father', 'Palmer', 'portrayed', 'genuine', 'intelligence', 'NOT', 'McConaughey', 'who', 'so', 'frequently', 'stoner', 'dude', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'sober', 'actor', 'who', 'once', 'while', 'potential', 'inA', 'Time', 'Kill', 'FrailtyandThe', 'Lincoln', 'Lawyer', '[', 'HD', ']', 'Father', 'Palmer', 'advisor', 'President', 'role', 'really', 'gravity', 'religious', 'side', 'discovery', ""'m"", 'not', 'especially', 'religious', ""'m"", 'open', 'enough', 'have', 'movies', 'portray', 'religion', 'best', 'order', 'increase', 'seriousness', 'debate.Note', 'drawbacks', 'movie', 'run', 'little', 'long', 'one', 'plot', 'development', 'late', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'here', 'backup', 'plan', 'nowhere', 'credulity', ""'re"", 'just', 'tiny', 'flaws', 'masterpiece', 'say', 'way', 'hurt', 'terrific', 'wonderful', 'intellectual', 'movie']",Contact

This one is grounded in the real world for a change, not the la-de-da what-if world of a fantasizer (although those can often be quite entertaining; it's just that this one is refreshing because of the perspective of writer/producer Carl Sagan).We see the struggle of the modern scientist to be taken seriously, the single-mindedness that marks the great mind, the helplessness of losing control of one's ""baby,"" all in the setting of a visually unique experience that's as dazzling as anything I've seen on film.Yet it's also Sagan's perspective that spoils the experience on one level. His evolution-based theories have always caused him to be singled out for opposition commentary by those who believe in Creation rather than his purist form of natural selection. Therefore his story includes snotty religionists (Rob Lowe in a bit of bizarre casting, thinly disguised as Jerry Falwell) and mindless fanatacism masquerading as religious fervor (stunning role by Jody Busey, son of Gary).  This smacks of possibly a ""strike back at them"" attitude in Sagan's heart, as he seems to see ALL Christians now as wild-eyed freaks and self-righteous hypocrites.Sagan's idea of presenting a balanced perspective toward those with religious views is to include a near-priest who dropped out because he ""couldn't handle celibacy"" and hops into the sack with Foster right away, yet is our Godly hero. Puh-leeze. Have to have sex to sell tickets, I guess, but that's seriously left field. Likewise the government people and department heads are all one-dimensional bad guys.I continue hope in vain that the movie industry at large can one day manage to lose its prejudice against us with a deep faith in God, and thereby present Christians as real three-dimensional people rather than one-note props to play off of and treat as idiots, yet there is no doubt that the story of ""Contact"" is moving and exciting, visually hypnotic and inventive. Obviously it does not commit the sin of boring the viewer; it's one you can debate after seeing it.Further, major props to the makers for at least presenting the scientist herself even-handedly. She is not Ms. Perfect. That would have been unforgivable. It's a shame she's the only character in the entire story who really seems like a real person with complexities and a past. For a 2-1/2 hour film, you'd think at least one other character would have the hint of a personal history.

Doyle,"[5, 8]","""Contact"" is a film that can be interpreted to be a film about several things.Ellie Arroway, our main character, is an astronomer working with SETI in New Mexico when she discovers a radio signal transmitting from a near-by star system.  After decoding the message, which turns out to be blueprints for a transportation device, they ""send"" her off.  When she returns, she discovers that it appears to everyone that she didn't actually ""go"" anywhere at all.The focal point that is driven in this movie was the relationship between Ellie and her love interest, Palmer (Matthew McConaughey...).Palmer is a spiritual man who ""can't picture a world without God.""  Ellie is a scientist who looks at fact and logic to understand the universe.  In the end, Ellie can't prove that she did ""go"" anywhere, but she finds that she has grown faith for it to be true.  Why?  Because her experience was a gift, a beautiful view of the universe and the realization that although, as earthlings, it may seem that we are all alone, we are actually not.  This is the meaning of religion; that when humans feel alone or weak or afraid, they can find comfort that God is with them.  Even though she cannot fully explain what happened, or the meaning of what she experienced, she will not back down from that belief, even with an angry James Woods yelling at her.I think that in the end, after going through the whole experience, Ellie finally finds out why people would choose to ""have faith"", rather than look at everything in a factual, scientific manner.A great movie overall.  A very rare film that combines science with science fiction, religion with ET, and ultimately, ""the pursuit of truth,"" which may not always mean what the facts support, but rather, what you believe inside.  Definately one of my favorite movies.My favorite quotes:Ellie(on God): ""How do you know that you're not diluting yourself?  For me, I'd need proof.""Palmer: ""Proof... Did you love your father?""Ellie: ""...Yes...very much.""Palmer: ""Prove it.""--Palmer: ""You personally.  You.  By doing this, you're willing to give your life. You're willing  to die for it.  Why?Ellie:  ""For as long as I can remember, I've been searching for...some reason why we're here.  I mean why are we here, what are we doing here? Who are we? If this is a chance to find out even a little part of that answer, I don't know, I think it's worth a human life...""--Ellie:  ""Is it possible that it didn't happen?  Yes...I had an experience.  I can't prove it.  I can't even explain it.  But everything that I know as I human being, everything that I am tells me that it was real.  I was given something wonderful, something that changed me forever...a vision of the universe...that tells us, undeniably, how tiny, and insignificant, and how rare and precious we all are.  A vision that tells us that we belong to something that is greater than ourselves, that we are not, that none of us, are alone.  I wish I could share that.  I wish that everyone, if even for one moment, could feel that awe and humility and that hope...but...that continues to be my wish.""",5,"The search for meaning, the search for truth",1130025600,"10 23, 2005",2005,3091,"['Contact', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'interpreted', 'be', 'film', 'several', 'things.Ellie', 'Arroway', 'main', 'character', 'astronomer', 'working', 'SETI', 'New', 'Mexico', 'when', 'radio', 'signal', 'transmitting', 'near-by', 'star', 'system', 'decoding', 'message', 'out', 'be', 'blueprints', 'transportation', 'device', 'send', 'off', 'When', 'everyone', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'go', 'anywhere', 'all.The', 'focal', 'point', 'driven', 'movie', 'was', 'relationship', 'Ellie', 'love', 'interest', 'Palmer', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', '.Palmer', 'spiritual', 'man', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'picture', 'world', 'God', 'Ellie', 'scientist', 'who', 'fact', 'logic', 'understand', 'universe', 'end', 'Ellie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'prove', 'did', 'go', 'anywhere', 'grown', 'faith', 'be', 'true', 'Why', 'experience', 'was', 'gift', 'beautiful', 'view', 'universe', 'realization', 'earthlings', 'may', 'seem', 'are', 'alone', 'are', 'actually', 'not', 'meaning', 'religion', 'when', 'humans', 'feel', 'alone', 'weak', 'afraid', 'can', 'find', 'comfort', 'God', 'Even', 'can', 'not', 'fully', 'explain', 'what', 'happened', 'meaning', 'what', 'experienced', 'will', 'not', 'back', 'down', 'belief', 'even', 'angry', 'James', 'Woods', 'yelling', 'her.I', 'think', 'end', 'going', 'whole', 'experience', 'Ellie', 'finally', 'out', 'why', 'people', 'would', 'choose', 'have', 'faith', 'rather', 'look', 'everything', 'factual', 'scientific', 'manner.A', 'great', 'movie', 'overall', 'very', 'rare', 'film', 'science', 'science', 'fiction', 'religion', 'ET', 'ultimately', 'pursuit', 'truth', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'mean', 'what', 'facts', 'support', 'rather', 'what', 'believe', 'inside', 'Definately', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies.My', 'favorite', 'quotes', 'Ellie', 'God', 'How', 'do', 'know', ""'re"", 'not', 'diluting', ""'d"", 'need', 'proof', 'Palmer', 'Proof', 'Did', 'love', 'father', 'Ellie', 'Yes', 'very', 'much', 'Palmer', 'Prove', 'Palmer', 'personally', 'doing', ""'re"", 'willing', 'give', 'life', ""'re"", 'willing', 'die', 'Why', 'Ellie', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'remember', ""'ve"", 'been', 'searching', 'reason', 'why', ""'re"", 'here', 'mean', 'why', 'are', 'here', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'here', 'Who', 'are', 'chance', 'find', 'out', 'even', 'little', 'part', 'answer', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'think', 'human', 'life', 'Ellie', 'possible', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Yes', 'had', 'experience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'prove', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'explain', 'everything', 'know', 'human', 'being', 'everything', 'am', 'tells', 'was', 'real', 'was', 'given', 'something', 'wonderful', 'something', 'changed', 'forever', 'vision', 'universe', 'undeniably', 'how', 'tiny', 'insignificant', 'how', 'rare', 'precious', 'are', 'vision', 'belong', 'something', 'greater', 'are', 'not', 'none', 'are', 'alone', 'wish', 'could', 'share', 'wish', 'everyone', 'even', 'one', 'moment', 'could', 'feel', 'awe', 'humility', 'hope', 'be', 'wish']",Contact

100730,A1S3C5OFU508P3,0790733226,Charles Ashbacher,"[4, 5]","The only event that I believe would have more power than establishing contact with alien intelligence would be an appearance by God similar to those documented in the bible. However, to many people, the events would be equivalent, which is one of the many themes of the movie. I very much enjoyed the movie, finding so many of the subplots typical of what would be expected if such an event occurred. The main character, a hard-driving independent female scientist, obtained much of that focus from having her mother die when she was born and her father when she was nine. This determination kept her going through many lean years of project cancellation and ridicule.Subplots aside, the main event was of course the message from aliens. Given the horror of the perspective of history, it seems bizarre that a telecast of Hitler opening the 1936 Olympic games would be the first message received. However, since it was the first telecast of any power, it is a reasonable possibility. The appearance of President Clinton as himself lends an air of realism that could be obtained no other way. He has a stage presence and an air of seriousness that makes his cameo appearance work to perfection. Other cameos by television commentators such as reporters reinforce the realism.While government agents are occasionally portrayed as bureacratically bound, it does not descend to the appearance of idiocy, which was a welcome relief. The agents are characterized as rigid, but not foolish, up to the very end. The last segment, where you see the beginning of a cover-up is the least plausible notion and comes across as artificial.  The main character, played superbly by Jodie Foster,  is a strong personality and as befits such a character, she is surrounded by similar strong personalities, one of the toughest of which is the president's chief of staff. She is a hard-nosed woman who gets her way simply by saying what it is. Foster's &quot;boyfriend&quot;, a deeply religious man who contributes heavily to her loss of a prized position, still respects her beliefs even though he strongly disagrees with them.With all the subplots, the main plot is still strong enough to dominate the movie. It is a movie with all the intrigue of a major political event, yet still manages to retain the scientific aspects of any contact with an alien civilization.",5,Blended political intrigue and scientific achievement,1001030400,"09 21, 2001",2001,2348,"['only', 'event', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'power', 'establishing', 'contact', 'alien', 'intelligence', 'would', 'be', 'appearance', 'God', 'similar', 'documented', 'bible', 'However', 'many', 'people', 'events', 'would', 'be', 'equivalent', 'one', 'many', 'themes', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'finding', 'so', 'many', 'subplots', 'typical', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'such', 'event', 'occurred', 'main', 'character', 'hard-driving', 'independent', 'female', 'scientist', 'obtained', 'much', 'focus', 'having', 'mother', 'die', 'when', 'was', 'born', 'father', 'when', 'was', 'nine', 'determination', 'kept', 'going', 'many', 'lean', 'years', 'project', 'cancellation', 'ridicule.Subplots', 'aside', 'main', 'event', 'was', 'course', 'message', 'aliens', 'Given', 'horror', 'perspective', 'history', 'bizarre', 'telecast', 'Hitler', 'opening', '1936', 'Olympic', 'games', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'message', 'received', 'However', 'was', 'first', 'telecast', 'power', 'reasonable', 'possibility', 'appearance', 'President', 'Clinton', 'air', 'realism', 'could', 'be', 'obtained', 'other', 'way', 'stage', 'presence', 'air', 'seriousness', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'work', 'perfection', 'Other', 'cameos', 'television', 'commentators', 'such', 'reporters', 'reinforce', 'realism.While', 'government', 'agents', 'are', 'occasionally', 'portrayed', 'bureacratically', 'not', 'descend', 'appearance', 'idiocy', 'was', 'welcome', 'relief', 'agents', 'are', 'characterized', 'rigid', 'not', 'foolish', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'last', 'segment', 'where', 'see', 'beginning', 'cover-up', 'least', 'plausible', 'notion', 'across', 'artificial', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'superbly', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'strong', 'personality', 'befits', 'such', 'character', 'surrounded', 'similar', 'strong', 'personalities', 'one', 'toughest', 'president', 'chief', 'staff', 'hard-nosed', 'woman', 'who', 'way', 'simply', 'saying', 'what', 'Foster', 'quot', 'quot', 'deeply', 'religious', 'man', 'who', 'heavily', 'loss', 'prized', 'position', 'still', 'beliefs', 'even', 'strongly', 'them.With', 'subplots', 'main', 'plot', 'still', 'strong', 'enough', 'dominate', 'movie', 'movie', 'intrigue', 'major', 'political', 'event', 'still', 'retain', 'scientific', 'aspects', 'contact', 'alien', 'civilization']",Contact

Great direction by Zemeckis, and Jodie Foster is brilliant as usual, and Sagan's ideas are well worth bringing to the screen.Now for the nitpicking...--SPOILER WARNING--I haven't read Sagan's book, but I'm guessing the story was altered to give it a wonderful sappy ending in which religion and science are ""both right"". Maybe they are both right, but this movie sure didn't show it. Because the ending has a monstrous gaping hole.In their effort to teach Ellie (and us) a lesson about faith, the writers contrive an ending where Ellie is left with nothing but a memory to verify her wonderful experience. An angry congressional inquiry, led by the James Woods character, investigates, and comes up with an alternative explanation for everything that has happened -- that it's all been an elaborate hoax perpetrated by the eccentric genius Haddon. But this is ridiculous, for many reasons. For one thing, how did Haddon come up with radically new technology capable of generating lightning and tidal waves yet inside of which ""the weather's fine""? He's smart, but not that smart (he has self-sealing door metal technology that he never thought to sell?).But more importantly, a signal from deep space could not be faked by a satellite, especially one that's been verified in Australia. And even if it could, THE SIGNAL WAS STILL THERE during the entire building of the machine. The aliens could not have known it was received at least until Ellie made her journey, so they would not have stopped transmitting. There was all the time in the world to verify that the signal was in fact coming from Vega. So there was clearly a message sent by aliens, and the public anger over wasted money makes no sense. So, the entire ending of the movie seemed stupid and manipulative to me. The message of this movie should have been ""science trumps human stupidity"", but that message wouldn't have been commercial.Oh yeah, and don't anyone ever put Matthew McConaughey in a sci fi movie again.

It's quite a good movie cause there's a sense of pace and structure without it being too long or just spurts of goodness laced in with long boring stuff.The film opens very impressively with a shot of Earth outside its atmosphere with multiple sounds going on at once like songs and famous quotes and we do what could possibly the longest zoom out in cinema as we leave the solar system with the sounds starting to fade until we have left the Milky Way and then we see dozens of galaxies popping up. They then combine together into one little shiny light in a girl's eye. Quite neat but onto the story.The little girl is Ellie Arroway, a quite gifted child with an acute taste for science and math and she becomes someone of huge intelligence only to sit in a chair at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico looking for signs of alien life. Her thorn in her side is David Drumlin, her boss and head of the Science Division. She ends up having to move to New Mexico's observatory and there she finds an alien signal filled with stuff so the whole world is now focused on her discovery even though she feels she's not being fully thanked.One of the coolest scenes undoubtedly is all the radio signal decoding turns out to be a machine, an incredibly expensive machine that will send one occupant into a large energy core. Seeing her travel in this thing is quite neat but what happens afterwards is good since it reinforces the theme of the movie which is belief although some people absolutely hate it(like Mr. Garrison on South Park for one).I can only watch the film now and then, just one of those movies that I can't really re-watch a little while after just seeing it but when I do, it's still good.

100741,AUHG8KSHI529U,0790733226,Craig Matteson,"[4, 5]","While this movie is often held up as a science fiction story about first contact with beings from another world, that is only the framework for what the story of this movie is about (I have not read the book and do not know if the book is similar to the movie, but the Carl Sagan was involved in the screenplay).  Contact also refers to the human search for truth and what coming into contact with that is like.  This isn't a particularly subtle story, but it does have a strong point to make about the humility true seekers of truth have versus those who talk about truth, but distort and destroy as they advance some other agenda.A mistaken view of the movie would be to see it as science versus religion or as reality versus faith.  Sagan is actually pointing out the similarity of scientific truth seeking and faith - a lesson that Eleanor Arroway (played by the great Jodie Foster) eventually learns as she is persecuted for the reality she experienced, but cannot prove.  She even refers to her experience as a vision in trying to describe it.  And her soulmate, the man of faith Palmer Joss (played quite well by Matthew McConaughey), supports her testimony and sees something in the search for truth through science that he had not suspected.The bad guys in the film are on both sides and are portrayed a bit ham handedly, but are well acted by Jake Busey as Joseph, and James Woods as Michael Kitz.  Joseph is the wild eyed ""prophet"" whose vision of the truth leads him to reject anything that science has to say (except the making of explosives, apparently), and Michael Kitz is a cynical politician who ""investigates"" Arroway's experience, but who is really using her to try and advance his political career.  (Why they simply didn't have someone else go through the machine to verify what Arroway said one way or the other eludes me - maybe the story made up some ""reason"" to prevent that logical next step.)  So, this way the story pairs Arroway and Joss as true seekers who have humility and devotion to the truth, but who have different approaches.  Their love story shows them as soul mates not only in love, but also in their love of truth.  Then we have the idiot bad guys Joseph and Kitz who have other desires and only pretend to be seeking the truth.  They already ""know"" their truth and aren't seeking anything.The other characters all help dress out this theme and add to an interesting story, but this is the main point of the story and makes for a pretty good film.

You can't help but get caught up in her quest for signs of intelligent life in the universe and sympathize with her frustrations from fellow colleagues and government types.The supporting cast is also excellent -- in particular, William Fichtner as a blind scientist (based on a real person, btw) is a real stand-out. He normally plays psychos or bad guys in movies and so it is really great to see him cast completely against type as a gentle soul who is very loyal to Foster's character.The DVD is quite good in quality -- although, the extras do tend to lean to the special effects aspects of the film, which gets a little dull after awhile.

100756,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0790733226,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 2]","I really wasn't sure that Carl Sagan's novel would translate very well to the big screen; after all, Sagan and his book were grounded in science, some of the most hardware-intensive scenes were left rather vague in the novel, and Sagan's atheism threatened to somehow taint the story's interplay of science and religion.  This movie, though, despite the fact that it necessarily differs from Sagan's novel at times, works amazingly well, even resurrecting a powerful ending under conditions that could be criticized by some in the two words ""nothing happens.""  Indeed, something amazing does happen, and even if it had not, one theme that I read into this story is that the journey is often more important than the destination.This motion picture is (pardon the pun) stellar in so many ways, reflecting a rare level of commitment on the part of everyone involved.  This really starts with the cast.  The role of Dr. Ellie Arroway was a crucial one that, in the hands of the wrong actress, could have doomed the whole project.  Any concerns along these lines, though, were dispensed with immediately upon the signing of Jodie Foster, the greatest female actress of this generation.  Matthew McConaughey gives a better than average performance as Palmer Joss (the religious guy), Tom Skerritt is as unlikable as always in his role as the President's Science Advisor and frequent Arroway nemesis, and the rest of the cast excels as well.  The injection of then-President Clinton and a number of CNN journalists into a number of scenes also brings a most welcome feel of reality to the profound events taking place here.  The special effects are just wonderful.  The opening scene is as beautiful and memorable as any scene you will find anywhere, the animation of the giant machine is extremely realistic, and the visual aspects of space travel are also a sight to behold.  Not only do these great scenes delight the eyes, they remain true to the nuts and bolts of science that Sagan wanted in the movie.  This movie may be long by some standards, coming in at almost two and a half hours, but there's not one wasted scene.The story is, in a sense, not all that complicated.  Ellie Arroway (Foster) finally gets a chance to realize her dream of searching for signals from outer space, only to find herself and her project stripped of funding by an unimaginative (or possibly secretive) government.  She and her colleagues refuse to let the dream die, and on one remarkable day they pick up a signal.  Once the signal is verified and word gets out, the public begins to wig out in a number of ways (quite overblown, in my opinion) and the government, specifically the military, swoops in to get their hands on the project.  Ironically, yet very plausibly, part of the signal ends up showing a clip of Hitler opening the Munich Olympic Games (which was the first television signal broadcast over a sizable area).  Arroway manages to persevere in her work, and eventually a message is discerned among the data, yielding blueprints for some type of great machine.  After plenty of government haggling, the machine is built, and one person is chosen to travel in what the scientists now come to believe is some type of interstellar craft.  The movie does not end here, though, not by a long shot.I find a few aspects about this movie and Sagan's novel interesting on a personal level.  Sagan was a long-time exponent of the search for extraterrestrial life, yet at a certain point in his career, he noticeably changed and became one of the most unobjective bulwarks of the movement to discredit any and all UFO sightings and encounters; some have speculated that he became a participant in the official government policy of disinformation and dismissal.  I believe he would know better than most how the government would frown upon news as profound as the discovery of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, and this movie certainly does show some of the dangers inherent in the military takeover of extraterrestrial projects.  I am also somewhat surprised at just how effective the juxtaposition of science and religion is presented here, given Sagan's lifelong atheism.  The religious aspect of the film works more in a spiritual than a Biblical sense, yet work it does.  There is obviously a lot of Sagan himself in Dr. Arroway, and this story, in both novel and motion picture form, stands as a true testament to one of the most influential scientists of modern times.",5,A brilliant and profound motion picture event,1057449600,"07 6, 2003",2003,4469,"['really', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'Carl', 'Sagan', 'novel', 'would', 'translate', 'very', 'well', 'big', 'screen', 'Sagan', 'book', 'were', 'grounded', 'science', 'most', 'hardware-intensive', 'scenes', 'were', 'left', 'rather', 'vague', 'novel', 'Sagan', 'atheism', 'threatened', 'somehow', 'taint', 'story', 'interplay', 'science', 'religion', 'movie', 'though', 'fact', 'necessarily', 'Sagan', 'novel', 'times', 'amazingly', 'well', 'even', 'resurrecting', 'powerful', 'ending', 'conditions', 'could', 'be', 'criticized', 'two', 'words', 'nothing', 'Indeed', 'something', 'amazing', 'happen', 'even', 'had', 'not', 'one', 'theme', 'read', 'story', 'journey', 'often', 'more', 'important', 'destination.This', 'motion', 'picture', 'pun', 'stellar', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'reflecting', 'rare', 'level', 'commitment', 'part', 'everyone', 'involved', 'really', 'cast', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Ellie', 'Arroway', 'was', 'crucial', 'one', 'hands', 'wrong', 'actress', 'could', 'have', 'doomed', 'whole', 'project', 'concerns', 'lines', 'though', 'were', 'dispensed', 'immediately', 'signing', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'greatest', 'female', 'actress', 'generation', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'better', 'average', 'performance', 'Palmer', 'Joss', 'religious', 'guy', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'as', 'unlikable', 'always', 'role', 'President', 'Science', 'Advisor', 'frequent', 'Arroway', 'nemesis', 'rest', 'cast', 'excels', 'well', 'injection', 'then-President', 'Clinton', 'number', 'CNN', 'journalists', 'number', 'scenes', 'also', 'most', 'welcome', 'feel', 'reality', 'profound', 'events', 'taking', 'place', 'here', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'just', 'wonderful', 'opening', 'scene', 'beautiful', 'memorable', 'scene', 'will', 'find', 'anywhere', 'animation', 'giant', 'machine', 'extremely', 'realistic', 'visual', 'aspects', 'space', 'travel', 'are', 'also', 'sight', 'behold', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'great', 'scenes', 'delight', 'eyes', 'remain', 'true', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'science', 'Sagan', 'wanted', 'movie', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'long', 'standards', 'coming', 'almost', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'not', 'one', 'wasted', 'scene.The', 'story', 'sense', 'not', 'complicated', 'Ellie', 'Arroway', 'Foster', 'finally', 'chance', 'realize', 'dream', 'searching', 'signals', 'outer', 'space', 'only', 'find', 'project', 'stripped', 'funding', 'unimaginative', 'possibly', 'secretive', 'government', 'colleagues', 'refuse', 'let', 'dream', 'die', 'one', 'remarkable', 'day', 'pick', 'up', 'signal', 'signal', 'verified', 'word', 'out', 'public', 'wig', 'out', 'number', 'ways', 'quite', 'overblown', 'opinion', 'government', 'specifically', 'military', 'swoops', 'get', 'hands', 'project', 'Ironically', 'yet', 'very', 'plausibly', 'part', 'signal', 'up', 'showing', 'clip', 'Hitler', 'opening', 'Munich', 'Olympic', 'Games', 'was', 'first', 'television', 'signal', 'broadcast', 'sizable', 'area', 'Arroway', 'persevere', 'work', 'eventually', 'message', 'discerned', 'data', 'yielding', 'blueprints', 'type', 'great', 'machine', 'plenty', 'government', 'haggling', 'machine', 'built', 'one', 'person', 'chosen', 'travel', 'what', 'scientists', 'now', 'come', 'believe', 'type', 'interstellar', 'craft', 'movie', 'not', 'end', 'here', 'though', 'not', 'long', 'shot.I', 'find', 'few', 'aspects', 'movie', 'Sagan', 'novel', 'interesting', 'personal', 'level', 'Sagan', 'was', 'long-time', 'exponent', 'search', 'extraterrestrial', 'life', 'yet', 'certain', 'point', 'career', 'noticeably', 'changed', 'became', 'one', 'most', 'unobjective', 'bulwarks', 'movement', 'discredit', 'UFO', 'sightings', 'encounters', 'have', 'speculated', 'became', 'participant', 'official', 'government', 'policy', 'disinformation', 'dismissal', 'believe', 'would', 'know', 'better', 'most', 'how', 'government', 'would', 'frown', 'upon', 'news', 'as', 'profound', 'discovery', 'intelligent', 'life', 'elsewhere', 'universe', 'movie', 'certainly', 'show', 'dangers', 'inherent', 'military', 'takeover', 'extraterrestrial', 'projects', 'am', 'also', 'somewhat', 'surprised', 'just', 'how', 'effective', 'juxtaposition', 'science', 'religion', 'presented', 'here', 'given', 'Sagan', 'lifelong', 'atheism', 'religious', 'aspect', 'film', 'more', 'spiritual', 'Biblical', 'sense', 'yet', 'work', 'obviously', 'lot', 'Sagan', 'Dr.', 'Arroway', 'story', 'novel', 'motion', 'picture', 'form', 'true', 'testament', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'scientists', 'modern', 'times']",Contact

100759,AAE2DUEMTR30I,0790733226,DAVID BRYSON,"[4, 15]","Considering the subject it tackles, I always felt that Carl Sagan's `Contact' was a little bit of a let-down. It would be unreasonable to look for something of the order of Childhood's End let alone of Stapledon, but Contact trivialises itself in too many ways. When the author presents us with the undeniable evidence (fictional of course) that a major civilisation is consciously trying to reach us, to base a lot of the story round the issue of trying to obtain funding is sheer bathos. Also, to a European reader the whole issue of science-vs-faith is a complete non-issue seemingly introduced to play to a certain kind of American gallery, and even from that standpoint it is hard not to find ridiculously implausible the status the book gives to vested religious interests, to say nothing of an auto-da-fe being made the qualifying criterion for participation in the project.The film could have alleviated some of this, but the production elects not to and instead throws in a variety of gratuitous downers of its own. It should be said at this stage that the film abruptly hoists itself on to a higher level towards the end, from the point where the alien machine first appears. Until then the camera-work is dull and average, the situations are void beyond belief of imagination, (the romantic theme in particular seeming a blatant crowd-pleaser), the dialogue is as flat and artificial as could be, and the only remaining hope was that the acting might raise the level a bit. No such luck. McConaughey is downright awful, but Foster and the rest of them are very little better, and it took a machine to rescue the production. The thought crossed my mind that if I had been the alien intelligence I would have hit the off-switch and looked for a more promising culture on Betelgeuse, Algol, Polaris or in another galaxy altogether.I'm a bit of a sucker for light-shows, and my level of interest and involvement rose sharply when the alien machine started up. The actual alien contact is notoriously vague and inconclusive. There is nothing basically wrong with the idea as far as I am concerned, but it should have been developed in some way. Instead we are brought back to earth with a bump and the focus shifts back to the less-than-gripping topic of congressional hearings, this one featuring some perfectly farcical conduct by the committee chairman.The story has the basic makings of real greatness, the film has some undoubtedly gripping sequences - so could I honestly manage to award it a third star?

I thought the changes didn't diminish too much the ideas from the book.  And some concessions have to be made when books become movies.For those not liking the portrayal of science and the way it is sometimes at odds with religion I can only say it must have seemed that way to Carl Sagan.  And I think it often is at odds.  As we advance in science as a culture it will be more at odds in the future.  Some compromises or changes will have to occur.  This movie left that open ended.

I don't know too much about Carl Sagan but I've listened to enough Art Bell that I am interested in SETI and the pursuit to find out the truth of life outside our  universe.This movie focuses on several topics such as extra-terrestrial  life and also the battle between science and religion.  I for one am a  person who thinks scientifically but at the same time a God believing  person and for others they can't compare the two, both are at opposite ends  of the spectrum and this movie is really good at showing that.Also,  the involvement of the US government.  Very interesting.  Also, the movie  uses a lot of major newscasters from CNN and President Bill Clinton.  Also,  very interesting.This DVD is one of the best intelligent movies and the  whole story including the special effects are wonderful.  The video is nice  and clear and the use of many colors in the film are brilliant.  The sound  on digital 5.1 is also very nice.As for the DVD extras, I have to give  Warner Bros. an applause for doing this movie justice by including three  feature length commentaries by Jodie Foster, the director and producer  Robert Zeickis and Steve Starkey and another group being Ken Ralston and  Stephen Rosebaum.  Also, it was nice to see the computer animation concepts  and tests, special effects designs and more.  I'm not sure if there were  many deleted or cut scenes but I wish they included them but I can't expect  much, they did a great job and by including three commentaries, that's  really awesome!I'm sure some people will love or hate this film due to  the science vs. religion overtone but I know what my heart believes and I  can only say that this DVD is highly recommended!",5,Contact DVD Review: A Truly Superb movie!,960336000,"06 7, 2000",2000,1739,"['film', 'was', 'very', 'important', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'too', 'much', 'Carl', 'Sagan', ""'ve"", 'listened', 'enough', 'Art', 'Bell', 'am', 'interested', 'SETI', 'pursuit', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'life', 'universe.This', 'movie', 'several', 'topics', 'such', 'extra-terrestrial', 'life', 'also', 'battle', 'science', 'religion', 'one', 'am', 'person', 'who', 'scientifically', 'same', 'time', 'God', 'believing', 'person', 'others', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'are', 'opposite', 'ends', 'spectrum', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'showing', 'that.Also', 'involvement', 'US', 'government', 'Very', 'interesting', 'Also', 'movie', 'lot', 'major', 'newscasters', 'CNN', 'President', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'Also', 'very', 'interesting.This', 'DVD', 'one', 'best', 'intelligent', 'movies', 'whole', 'story', 'including', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'wonderful', 'video', 'nice', 'clear', 'use', 'many', 'colors', 'film', 'are', 'brilliant', 'sound', 'digital', '5.1', 'also', 'very', 'nice.As', 'DVD', 'extras', 'have', 'give', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'applause', 'doing', 'movie', 'justice', 'including', 'three', 'feature', 'length', 'commentaries', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'director', 'producer', 'Robert', 'Zeickis', 'Steve', 'Starkey', 'group', 'being', 'Ken', 'Ralston', 'Stephen', 'Rosebaum', 'Also', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'computer', 'animation', 'concepts', 'tests', 'special', 'effects', 'designs', 'more', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'were', 'many', 'deleted', 'cut', 'scenes', 'wish', 'included', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'including', 'three', 'commentaries', 'really', 'awesome', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'will', 'love', 'hate', 'film', 'due', 'science', 'vs.', 'religion', 'overtone', 'know', 'what', 'heart', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommended']",Contact

This is what WE would transmit and do transmit because such signals cannot be mistaken for natural phenomena.  It's obvious that what we have here is intelligent science fiction.  The  general public may be surprised to learn-I know I was-that a significant  segment of the scientific community considers the Search for  Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) a pie in the sky waste of money and  human energy.  The prejudice is so great that until recently no  self-respecting astrophysicist would dare specialize in it for fear of  having no career.  Well, there are a few brave souls.  This is a movie  about one of them.I didn't read the book-shame on me, but works of  fiction by scientists usually make me blush in embarrassment for their  authors.  But Carl Sagan was no ordinary scientist, nor was he an ordinary  writer.  Still I suspect that what made this an excellent movie was the  script by James V. Hart and Michael Goldenberg.  It is extraordinarily well  thought out and carefully crafted with deft turns of plot and a satisfying  conclusion, with no need for spaghetti code patches near the end, the bane  of most sci-fi and action/adventure flicks.  It is also emotionally  moving.There is, however, just the slightest ""written by committee"" feel  to the movie.  Everything is a little too neat and too well explained.  It's a paradox of any art form that sometimes you can polish too much, you  can overwrite and lose some spontaneity in the production.  And yes, Palmer  Joss (Matthew McConaughey) is a little too good to be true, and Arroway  (Jodie Foster) really needs a serious fault or at least some kind of vice  to round her out.  Being a political innocent isn't enough.  And the media  and governmental reaction is a little too pat and cynical.However all of  that is insignificant compared with the most difficult thing about writing  a futuristic or ""superior civilization"" story, namely coming up some  unknown technology or information to make it seem real.  The formula for  cold fusion would work, or the cure for cancer.  But how can you do THAT?  You can't (otherwise what you come up with would probably be more important  than your script).  It is fascinating to see how Sagan, Hart, Goldenberg  and Director Robert Zemeckis cleverly sidestep this pitfall.  Only those  who have tried it can know what a fine job was done here.  And incidentally  Zemeckis can be given credit for making ""Contact"" intelligible without any  dumbing down, no mean feat in itself.As far as star Jodie Foster goes,  it's clear she inhaled and imbibed the persona of the modern woman of  science in preparation for this role, so well does she play the part of  astrophysicist Ellie Arroway.  They have her come out looking androgynous,  which is appropriate for two reasons, one, she lost her mother early and  had to identify with her father more than most (an explanation, if one were  needed, for how she became a scientist); and two, those little green beings  aren't going to be men or women, having given up our sort of primitive  sexuality long ago.  She is never glamorized; even when she dresses up, she  still looks like a normal woman in a gown.  And she is appropriately  unpolitical and naive and far too honest in front of the camera.Best  line: ""It's so beautiful.

Personally, I don't know what to make of this film.  It frustrates and annoys me and yet I found it absolutely absorbing, something I couldn't turn away from, even at its lowest ebb.  At all times it is entertaining.  But it is also manipulative, filled with stock character types rather than genuine people, and a story that is obvious; nothing truly surprised me about this film.  And yet, I still liked it.  I'm trying to figure out why.The opening sequence is magical in its simplicity and beauty.  It gives one pause to wonder.  Unfortunately, how and why we wonder is soon taken away from us by a story that literally maps out exactly what we should feel, when, and why.  Allowing us to arrive at our own conclusions was taken away, I find that galling and not a little insulting.  I was also put off by the heavy handed way in which religion was presented (making Christians either lunatics or self-righteous nitwits).  This was less a story about discovery and more about the politics that might surround such an incredible occurrence.  All the fringe ugliness dampened whatever enthusiasm would be inherent in such a life altering moment.  This is a great idea, mishandled.  Why the botched ""contact"" moment?  Why all the nastiness with James Woods maniacal character?  If you want to tarnish and kill an ending, that's the way to do it!On the other hand....there is that magnificent performance by Jodie Foster (and Jena Malone) as Dr. Eleanor Arroway.  John Hurt was bizarre (in a good way) as the mysterious S.R. Hadden.  It was so nice to see David Morse play something other than a bad guy, the same goes for William Fichtner.In the end, I find myself justifying why I liked this movie in spite of all its negative points (that would include Jake Busey & Rob Lowe).  I think that what I liked most was the notion that this could be possible, and wouldn't it be great if it was.  I think that for a film to inspire that (hope) is something special in itself.I've often found myself peering up at the night sky, wondering if anyone is out there...wondering if anyone is out there.",4,"Star light, star bright, The first star I see tonight.....",1312070400,"07 31, 2011",2011,2276,"['Fraught', 'controversies', 'lawsuits', 'misinformation', 'outright', 'miracle', 'stubbornness', 'film', 'ever', 'got', 'made', 'such', 'devoted', 'overprotective', 'following', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'make', 'film', 'annoys', 'yet', 'found', 'absolutely', 'absorbing', 'something', 'could', ""n't"", 'turn', 'away', 'even', 'lowest', 'ebb', 'times', 'entertaining', 'also', 'manipulative', 'filled', 'stock', 'character', 'types', 'rather', 'genuine', 'people', 'story', 'obvious', 'nothing', 'truly', 'surprised', 'film', 'yet', 'still', 'liked', ""'m"", 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'why.The', 'opening', 'sequence', 'magical', 'simplicity', 'beauty', 'one', 'pause', 'wonder', 'Unfortunately', 'how', 'why', 'wonder', 'soon', 'taken', 'away', 'story', 'literally', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'should', 'feel', 'when', 'why', 'Allowing', 'arrive', 'own', 'conclusions', 'was', 'taken', 'away', 'find', 'galling', 'not', 'little', 'insulting', 'was', 'also', 'put', 'off', 'heavy', 'handed', 'way', 'religion', 'was', 'presented', 'making', 'Christians', 'lunatics', 'self-righteous', 'nitwits', 'was', 'less', 'story', 'discovery', 'more', 'politics', 'might', 'surround', 'such', 'incredible', 'occurrence', 'fringe', 'ugliness', 'dampened', 'enthusiasm', 'would', 'be', 'inherent', 'life', 'altering', 'moment', 'great', 'idea', 'mishandled', 'Why', 'botched', 'contact', 'moment', 'Why', 'nastiness', 'James', 'Woods', 'maniacal', 'character', 'want', 'tarnish', 'kill', 'ending', 'way', 'do', 'other', 'hand', '.there', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'Dr.', 'Eleanor', 'Arroway', 'John', 'Hurt', 'was', 'bizarre', 'good', 'way', 'mysterious', 'S.R', 'Hadden', 'was', 'so', 'nice', 'see', 'David', 'Morse', 'play', 'something', 'other', 'bad', 'guy', 'same', 'William', 'Fichtner.In', 'end', 'find', 'justifying', 'why', 'liked', 'movie', 'spite', 'negative', 'points', 'would', 'include', 'Jake', 'Busey', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'think', 'what', 'liked', 'most', 'was', 'notion', 'could', 'be', 'possible', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'great', 'was', 'think', 'film', 'inspire', 'hope', 'something', 'special', 'itself.I', ""'ve"", 'often', 'found', 'peering', 'up', 'night', 'sky', 'wondering', 'anyone', 'there', 'wondering', 'anyone', 'out', 'there']",Contact

100790,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,0790733226,Erik North,"[2, 2]","A film very much in the league of such sci-fi giants as 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, and E.T., director Robert Zemeckis' 1997 film CONNTACT is one of the genre's most stunningly intelligent films of all time. Clearly having learned much about displaying a sense of cinematic wonder from his mentor Steven Spielberg, Zemeckis has fashioned a film that, like ""2001"", has elements of spiritualism, mysticism, and child-like awe.Jodie Foster is Dr. Eleanor Arroway, an ambitious radio astronomer who, ever since she was a young girl, has been dreaming of making contact with other beings from outer space. As her ambitions grow, there is, of course, plenty of resistance from other corners of the scientific community to her search--especially from her mentor (Tom Skerritt), who sees this as wasteful, pie-in-the-sky stuff. But when Foster and her team at New Mexico's Very Large Array radio telescope field in New Mexico detect an actual alien signal (represented in prime numbers) eminating from the star Vega, some twenty-six light years away, all bets are off. Despite the somewhat ominous beginning to this (the signal is eventually found to have been in response to the first-ever TV transmission on Earth, which were the opening ceremonies to the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, presided over by Adolf Hitler), further research, funded by an eccentric engineer (John Hurt) reveals the desire on the part of the aliens for the human race to build a space pod that will hurl itself towards Vega at or near the speed of light.Immediately, of course, there is a worldwide firestorm of controversy, and not just from the scientific community. The religious community, particularly America's religious right-wing, comes to attack Foster and her fellow scientists for wanting to contact aliens who might not believe in God (or their version of Him). Foster does, however, have one sympathetic friend in that community--Reverend Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey). When, during a test of the new pod, Skerritt is killed by a fanatic religious bomber, it is up to Foster to make that ultra-perilous journey to Vega.When she does, she stunningly meets up with her father (David Morse), whom she lost at an early age. Her return to Earth and her story is met with unbridled incredulity and iron skepticism. But McConaughey chooses to take the high road in this case, stating that although the two of them operate under different covenants of thought, their goals are one and the same--the pursuit of truth.Based on the only fictional novel written by the late Carl Sagan, creator of the legendary PBS-TV series ""Cosmos"", CONTACT is a very lengthy and extremely ambitious film that succeeds far more often than it slips (which is extremely rare here). As with any of the great science fiction movies, the special effects and the hardware are incredibly spectacular; but going hand in hand with all this are a highly credible story and some fine acting, particularly by Foster, whose performance here is as good as anything she has given us since THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.With newsreel references to the religious cult murders that occurred in San Diego shortly before the film's release, as well as video cameos by Geraldo Rivera, Geraldine Ferraro, and president Bill Clinton (some of them admittedly resembling humorous asides more than they do advancements in the story), CONTACT is also topical. By having McConaughey's character display a genuine sympathy towards Foster's approach to things, the film does not balance science over religion; but it also does not fail to condemn certain segments of the religious community for trying to force their values onto others. In essence, CONTACT is a plea for understanding among all the world's people, and bravely suceeds in telling us that ours is not the only intelligence that God may have bought forth.For anyone interested in the science fiction genre, CONTACT is a must-have for your video or DVD collection.",5,One of the all-time great science fiction movies,1011312000,"01 18, 2002",2002,3978,"['film', 'very', 'much', 'league', 'such', 'sci-fi', 'giants', '2001', 'SPACE', 'ODYSSEY', 'CLOSE', 'ENCOUNTERS', 'THE', 'THIRD', 'KIND', 'E.T.', 'director', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', '1997', 'film', 'CONNTACT', 'one', 'genre', 'most', 'stunningly', 'intelligent', 'films', 'time', 'Clearly', 'having', 'learned', 'much', 'displaying', 'sense', 'cinematic', 'wonder', 'mentor', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Zemeckis', 'fashioned', 'film', '2001', 'elements', 'spiritualism', 'mysticism', 'child-like', 'awe.Jodie', 'Foster', 'Dr.', 'Eleanor', 'Arroway', 'ambitious', 'radio', 'astronomer', 'who', 'ever', 'was', 'young', 'girl', 'been', 'dreaming', 'making', 'contact', 'other', 'beings', 'outer', 'space', 'ambitions', 'grow', 'course', 'plenty', 'resistance', 'other', 'corners', 'scientific', 'community', 'search', 'especially', 'mentor', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'who', 'wasteful', 'pie-in-the-sky', 'stuff', 'when', 'Foster', 'team', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Very', 'Large', 'Array', 'radio', 'telescope', 'field', 'New', 'Mexico', 'detect', 'actual', 'alien', 'signal', 'represented', 'prime', 'numbers', 'eminating', 'star', 'Vega', 'twenty-six', 'light', 'years', 'away', 'bets', 'are', 'off', 'somewhat', 'ominous', 'beginning', 'signal', 'eventually', 'found', 'have', 'been', 'response', 'first-ever', 'TV', 'transmission', 'Earth', 'were', 'opening', 'ceremonies', '1936', 'Olympics', 'Berlin', 'presided', 'over', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'further', 'research', 'funded', 'eccentric', 'engineer', 'John', 'Hurt', 'desire', 'part', 'aliens', 'human', 'race', 'build', 'space', 'pod', 'will', 'hurl', 'towards', 'Vega', 'speed', 'light.Immediately', 'course', 'worldwide', 'firestorm', 'controversy', 'not', 'just', 'scientific', 'community', 'religious', 'community', 'particularly', 'America', 'religious', 'right-wing', 'attack', 'Foster', 'fellow', 'scientists', 'wanting', 'contact', 'aliens', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'believe', 'God', 'version', 'Him', 'Foster', 'however', 'have', 'one', 'sympathetic', 'friend', 'community', 'Reverend', 'Palmer', 'Joss', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'When', 'test', 'new', 'pod', 'Skerritt', 'killed', 'fanatic', 'religious', 'bomber', 'Foster', 'make', 'ultra-perilous', 'journey', 'Vega.When', 'stunningly', 'up', 'father', 'David', 'Morse', 'whom', 'lost', 'early', 'age', 'return', 'Earth', 'story', 'met', 'unbridled', 'incredulity', 'iron', 'skepticism', 'McConaughey', 'take', 'high', 'road', 'case', 'stating', 'two', 'operate', 'different', 'covenants', 'thought', 'goals', 'are', 'one', 'same', 'pursuit', 'truth.Based', 'only', 'fictional', 'novel', 'written', 'late', 'Carl', 'Sagan', 'creator', 'legendary', 'PBS-TV', 'series', 'Cosmos', 'CONTACT', 'very', 'lengthy', 'extremely', 'ambitious', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'often', 'extremely', 'rare', 'here', 'great', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'special', 'effects', 'hardware', 'are', 'incredibly', 'spectacular', 'going', 'hand', 'hand', 'are', 'highly', 'credible', 'story', 'fine', 'acting', 'particularly', 'Foster', 'performance', 'here', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'given', 'SILENCE', 'THE', 'LAMBS.With', 'newsreel', 'references', 'religious', 'cult', 'murders', 'occurred', 'San', 'Diego', 'shortly', 'film', 'release', 'as', 'well', 'video', 'cameos', 'Geraldo', 'Rivera', 'Geraldine', 'Ferraro', 'president', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'admittedly', 'resembling', 'humorous', 'asides', 'more', 'do', 'advancements', 'story', 'CONTACT', 'also', 'topical', 'having', 'McConaughey', 'character', 'display', 'genuine', 'sympathy', 'towards', 'Foster', 'approach', 'things', 'film', 'not', 'balance', 'science', 'religion', 'also', 'not', 'fail', 'condemn', 'certain', 'segments', 'religious', 'community', 'trying', 'force', 'values', 'others', 'essence', 'CONTACT', 'plea', 'understanding', 'world', 'people', 'bravely', 'suceeds', 'telling', 'ours', 'not', 'only', 'intelligence', 'God', 'may', 'have', 'bought', 'forth.For', 'anyone', 'interested', 'science', 'fiction', 'genre', 'CONTACT', 'must-have', 'video', 'DVD', 'collection']",Contact

Now, after purchasing this movie and having had the opportunity to sit and watch it again, I see that it truly is a work of art.Jodie Foster does an amzing job in her role as the first person from our world to EVER make ""Contact.""  While many others shoot her thoughts, ideas, and hopes down throughout the movie, she never wavers once!  Standing firmly in her convictions as a scientist, she aims to make believers of us all.Although I am not a big Matthew McConaughey fan, he does a solid job as Foster's polar opposite.  Another thing i liked is, although they are very opposite in opinions of the world, they can co-exhist and share one common thing: love.  Now, you may be thinking ""oh there's a love story here?""

It has great cinematography, casting, and music, but its script is the real standout.  It's rare that *any* fictional film spends so much time on science, even other science fiction films, but this movie manages to touch upon a lot of the important dichotomies and other concepts in the field of science:  Basic science versus applied science, empirical data versus faith, openness versus control of information, the opposition of science and religion, the convenience and ubiquity of technology versus personal fulfillment, and even the role of sexism in a field where judgement on knowledge and merits is supposed to be the only thing that matters.  (The excellently cast and played Drummond spends pretty much all of his screen time alternately patronizing the main character and stealing credit for her work, even daring to justify his behavior by lecturing her about how the world is not a place where fairness matters, as if he were teaching her some kind of important lesson and she would thank him someday.)This movie has held up extremely well since 1997, and anyone with a sense of curiosity and wonder would be well served to see it at least once.",5,Underrated movie,1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,1223,"['Contact', 'been', 'list', 'favorite', 'movies', 'long', 'time', 'great', 'cinematography', 'casting', 'music', 'script', 'real', 'standout', 'rare', '*any*', 'fictional', 'film', 'spends', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'science', 'even', 'other', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'movie', 'touch', 'lot', 'important', 'dichotomies', 'other', 'concepts', 'field', 'science', 'Basic', 'science', 'versus', 'applied', 'science', 'empirical', 'data', 'versus', 'faith', 'openness', 'versus', 'control', 'information', 'opposition', 'science', 'religion', 'convenience', 'ubiquity', 'technology', 'personal', 'fulfillment', 'even', 'role', 'sexism', 'field', 'where', 'judgement', 'knowledge', 'merits', 'supposed', 'be', 'only', 'thing', 'matters', 'excellently', 'cast', 'played', 'Drummond', 'pretty', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'alternately', 'patronizing', 'main', 'character', 'stealing', 'credit', 'work', 'even', 'daring', 'justify', 'behavior', 'lecturing', 'how', 'world', 'not', 'place', 'where', 'fairness', 'matters', 'were', 'teaching', 'kind', 'important', 'lesson', 'would', 'thank', 'someday', 'movie', 'held', 'up', 'extremely', 'well', '1997', 'anyone', 'sense', 'curiosity', 'wonder', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'served', 'see', 'least', 'once']",Contact

However, I do not find that to be the case. Since I now have both the Blu-ray and DVD, I can see just how bad the DVD print is, full of picture noise and compression artifacts. The color also doesn't look quite right in places. The Blu-ray image, while not reference quality, is a very good transfer which, while cleaning up the image considerably, also retains much of the natural graininess of the film. For the most part, colors are strikingly vibrant without looking over-saturated. The aspect ratio also seems correct (i.e., no vertical stretching). On a properly-calibrated TV, this looks vastly superior to the DVD print. And the sound is just fantastic.Unfortunately, the bonus material leaves a lot to be desired. Although the short-and-small computer animation featurettes from the DVD are retained, they look terrible. Also, I didn't find the extensive text-only production notes from the Special Edition DVD on this Blu-ray.A low price makes an upgrade from DVD more than worthwhile.

100814,AEV640MKB3I9J,0790733226,Hank Drake,"[2, 4]","Contact is the most satisfying science fiction movie of the 1990s.  It avoids the pitfalls of being a shoot 'em up like Starship Troopers, or being coldly intellectual like 2001.  It is also one of those rare movies that gives the scientific aspect of the script proper respect, without  being pedantic or sacrificing character development.For me, what makes  the movie work is the versimilitude with which the story is handled.  Using  CNN reporters, celebrities, and even President Clinton, the story comes off  as very realistic.  Certain details from the book would have made the ending a bit less ambiguous--e.g., the fact that sand was found in the pod seemed to  indicate in the novel that Ellie really did visit another world.  Apparently, the  producers wanted to keep the ending more ambiguous, which is  understandable, since one of the themes of the film is faith.  Ellie's lack  of faith in organized religion ironically comes back to haunt her when she  realizes that for people to believe her journey actually took place, they  must accept her statement--on faith.  (Incidentally, the book makes clear that Ellie is not an Atheist, but rather an open-minded Agnostic.)This is one of the few films in this genre to have truly first class acting.  Foster does her usual excellent job, as do the supporting players, especially Tom Skeritt.The visual effects in this film are in a class of their own, and they are placed at the service of the story, in contrast to the Star Wars movies.This is one of the first DVDs I purchased, and for years it was my demo-disc.  Warner has simply packed it with extras, inclusing three commentary tracks and a French translation.  There are also extra materials explaining how the  visual effects were achieved and how the Machine was designed.  The Blu-ray has the same features.This is a  DVD everyone should have!UPDATE, June, 2010:Contact has since been issued on Blu-ray.  I recommend that over the DVD for several reasons.  In addition to the obvious visual improvements, the old-style snap-case of the DVD was rather unwieldy.  The generous features on the Blu-ray are exactly the same as those on DVD, but the menu is easier to navigate.Over the years, my opinions on the movie have changed somewhat - although I continue to rate it highly.  Since my original review in 2000, I have visited Puerto Rico twice and the Arecibo Observatory once.  Although the telescope itself is spectacularly presented in the film, the huts that Ellie and her co-workers live in couldn't be farther from a realistic portrayal.  Buildings in Puerto Rico (which is in a hurricane zone) are invariably made of cement.  The same can be said of the ""lechonera"" style restaurant where Ellie meets Palmer.  Arecibo is essentially a suburban town, not some third-world hovel.  In real life, Arecibo (like most of Puerto Rico) has been overrun by American fast-food restaurants.The use of real-life footage of President Clinton is, in retrospect, a mistake.  It serves only to date the film.  In the novel, the President was an unnamed woman who was only referred to as ""Madame President"".  I feel the film would have been more successful if it had stayed closer to the book - Angela Bassett, who played the Chief of Staff, would have been a good choice as President.",5,Versimilitude,956275200,"04 21, 2000",2000,3295,"['Contact', 'most', 'satisfying', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', '1990s', 'pitfalls', 'being', 'shoot', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'being', 'coldly', 'intellectual', '2001', 'also', 'one', 'rare', 'movies', 'scientific', 'aspect', 'script', 'proper', 'respect', 'being', 'pedantic', 'sacrificing', 'character', 'development.For', 'what', 'movie', 'work', 'versimilitude', 'story', 'handled', 'Using', 'CNN', 'reporters', 'celebrities', 'even', 'President', 'Clinton', 'story', 'off', 'very', 'realistic', 'Certain', 'details', 'book', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'ending', 'bit', 'less', 'ambiguous', 'e.g.', 'fact', 'sand', 'was', 'found', 'pod', 'seemed', 'indicate', 'novel', 'Ellie', 'really', 'did', 'visit', 'world', 'Apparently', 'producers', 'wanted', 'keep', 'ending', 'more', 'ambiguous', 'understandable', 'one', 'themes', 'film', 'faith', 'Ellie', 'lack', 'faith', 'organized', 'religion', 'ironically', 'back', 'haunt', 'when', 'people', 'believe', 'journey', 'actually', 'took', 'place', 'must', 'accept', 'statement', 'faith', 'Incidentally', 'book', 'clear', 'Ellie', 'not', 'Atheist', 'rather', 'open-minded', 'Agnostic', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'genre', 'have', 'truly', 'first', 'class', 'acting', 'Foster', 'usual', 'excellent', 'job', 'do', 'supporting', 'players', 'especially', 'Tom', 'Skeritt.The', 'visual', 'effects', 'film', 'are', 'class', 'own', 'are', 'placed', 'service', 'story', 'contrast', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movies.This', 'one', 'first', 'DVDs', 'purchased', 'years', 'was', 'demo-disc', 'Warner', 'simply', 'packed', 'extras', 'inclusing', 'three', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'French', 'translation', 'are', 'also', 'extra', 'materials', 'explaining', 'how', 'visual', 'effects', 'were', 'achieved', 'how', 'Machine', 'was', 'designed', 'Blu-ray', 'same', 'features.This', 'DVD', 'everyone', 'should', 'have', 'UPDATE', 'June', '2010', 'Contact', 'been', 'issued', 'Blu-ray', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'several', 'reasons', 'addition', 'obvious', 'visual', 'improvements', 'old-style', 'snap-case', 'DVD', 'was', 'rather', 'unwieldy', 'generous', 'features', 'Blu-ray', 'are', 'exactly', 'same', 'DVD', 'menu', 'easier', 'navigate.Over', 'years', 'opinions', 'movie', 'have', 'changed', 'somewhat', 'continue', 'rate', 'highly', 'original', 'review', '2000', 'have', 'visited', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'twice', 'Arecibo', 'Observatory', 'once', 'telescope', 'spectacularly', 'presented', 'film', 'huts', 'Ellie', 'co-workers', 'live', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'farther', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'Buildings', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'hurricane', 'zone', 'are', 'invariably', 'made', 'cement', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'lechonera', 'style', 'restaurant', 'where', 'Ellie', 'Palmer', 'Arecibo', 'essentially', 'suburban', 'town', 'not', 'third-world', 'hovel', 'real', 'life', 'Arecibo', 'most', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'been', 'overrun', 'American', 'fast-food', 'restaurants.The', 'use', 'real-life', 'footage', 'President', 'Clinton', 'retrospect', 'mistake', 'only', 'date', 'film', 'novel', 'President', 'was', 'unnamed', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'referred', 'Madame', 'President', 'feel', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'successful', 'had', 'stayed', 'closer', 'book', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'who', 'played', 'Chief', 'Staff', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'choice', 'President']",Contact

This movie doesn't give  any answers.  It doesn't show ""the alien"", though it shows -a  representation- of an alien, from the main character's memory.  It says so  right in the dialog, but I guess that since ""Contact"" doesn't  come pre-chewed and digested, there are a lot of people who can't  understand it.  This movie is aimed at people who are willing to think.  Others need not apply.What the movie -does- do is ask questions, and  really interesting questions at that.  An example: any answer to questions  like, ""are we all alone in the universe"" would be bogus, because  we don't know.  Instead, it asks, and shows an example, of how humans might  react to a ""first contact"" situation.  It asks questions relating  to science vs religion.  It speaks to us of ""the world as it is""  rather than ""the world as we'd like it to be"".  The only thing it  adds is ""the message"", whatever that really is.I've read the book, and found that this movie is one of those rare examples where the movie is better than the book.The DVD is  fantastic, because not only do you get the awsome movie, but you get all  the commentary which allows you to extract every iota of meaning from it.

100817,A3LIMH3HXT94YB,0790733226,I.M.,"[0, 0]","Actually i, personally, didn't think that the novel &quot;Contact&quot; could be applied to a motion picture for it had multiple levels of storytelling. Moreover, it presented a long time period with ingenious  connections, references and, of course, memories which could turn out as a  disadvantage for a film to grasp it all. However, Zemeckis' demiurgical  blend of Sagan's novel with conventional Hollywood approach makes this film  an experience to enjoy. What's so striking is that, the film and the book  almost enrich one another. For example, in order to visualize the Machine  (of course not fully, because it's a bit altered in the film) described in  the book, you have to see the film. On the other hand, if you want to touch  a deeper level of meaning &amp; cross-references (through a magnificent  choice of quotes, flawlessly constructed storyline, and the unique  perspective of the universe &amp; life itself that Sagan makes us witness)  you have to read the book. But beware: if you read the book 1st, then you  may find the film less satisfying. Because, after all, this is a Hollywood  production. It has to address the public taste with a pinch of a love  story, injustice &amp; redemption sequences, and of course a  &quot;comprehensible&quot; finale.

For this reason, not all science fiction fans will love the movie as much as I did.  Jodie Foster (as Ellie)turned in one of her typically stellar performances, and her transformation from a strict ""Just the facts, please"" scientist to a woman who accepts faith's role in the building of the universe was believable and moving, and it really resonated with me.  Matthew McConnaughey, on the other hand, was horribly miscast as Foster's religious and intellectual counterpart and as her sort-of love interest.  Fortunately, he kept his usual smarmy smirking acting technique to a minimum.I love the opening of the film which portrays a gradual pullback from a point on Earth to a faraway point in the universe before the visual zooms back into the eye of Foster's character as a child.  I can watch this scene over and over.Side note with a SPOILER:  I originally saw this film with two friends in the theater when it was released in 1997.  At the conclusion, both made comments about how bizarre it was that Ellie's father was on another planet.  Whaaaat???  I didn't understand how they could possibly have reached that conclusion, especially since the dialogue spoon feeds us the explanation for the alien's appearance.

How can we be intelligent enough to build all of these tools to use, and still have room for doubt about the why? What if humans on an insignificant planet in the Cosmos actually did pick up a signal or make 'Contact' from outer space? How brave would you actually be? The movie 'Contact' presents this loneliness with a gentle and loving manner. The movie presents the greatest challenge -- do we survive, despite ourselves here on this insignificant speck like a grain of sand in all the grains of sand in all the beaches of the planet we live on? It really is not thought that humans would end it all, being even made to feel smaller than previously before by receiving advanced technology from aliens meant to meet this 'Contact', or is it a weapon?But then again, they are extremely more intelligent, and give us hope, and fear, about the why and the what and the who and the how, but where are we, as humans, really at within the Grand Scheme of It All? The movie shows that the answer these questions give leave all even smaller and less advanced then we previously thought and still leaves the possibility open with all the awe and wonder Carl Sagan sought to show when talking about the Cosmos. The movie presents all of this with all the technological wonder it can muster at this Time and in this Space called SpaceTime. But then again, perhaps Carl Sagan should be remembered most for his love of life, and his thoughtfullness on why we as humans ought to survive and not create a Nuclear Winter Scenario by having a Nuclear War, a Holocaust due to hate and stupidity on this Planet Earth, in the Sol System, in the Persus Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy, one of the local group of 50 galaxies traveling together through SpaceTime at around 33 miles/ second traveling towards the SuperCluster Cluster of Strings of Galaxies near the Virgo Constellation only reaching that part of SpaceTime in another 300-400 million years, and still will we survive or make 'Contact' in that SpaceTime while we all are traveling in this SpaceTime and still find that everything else has moved that was there before in that region of SpaceTime, but yet find the strength and courage needed to survive?

Throughout the enitre film you will be cheering her on, as you quickly realize she is the &quot;outcast&quot; of the scientific world.

Because of this movie, I had to stop and think many times, about the power of faith.  The movie made me realize that we as humans are a tiny incriment of the universe.  Are we the only intelligent life in the universe?  Can faith and science coincide with one another?Robert Z. is the perfect director for this.  Jodie was the PERFECT Ellie.

This movie is really the best of both worlds.The transformation of Jodie's character through the movie is subtle and heart-breaking. It's hard to imagine who else could have come close to pulling off this role as she did. Sci-Fi movies of course never win best actor/actress awards, but she was nominated for Golden Globe for this role.There is an interesting article about this film on Wikipedia, that discusses the ""screen-writing hell"" the film ended up in for years. Multiple directors, a parade of writers that came and went... And the film is flawed, no doubt. (The main antagonist, played by the wonderfully slimy Tom Skerritt, dies half way through the film.) But the acting is wonderful all around.I bought the movie on DVD, and watched the lengthy special mini-documentary about the making of the film. The vast majority of the special effects shots in the movie are not in the more sci-fi scenes, but in the normal, day-to-day scenes -- a crane shot of her house as a young child that zooms in and pushes right through the window into the room where shes sitting, for example (the window wasnt there, of course: the window, the trees reflecting in it and even the finger prints on it were all animated).

This reviewer loves it.`Contact' is a fresh story, and is particularly great for those who enjoy their sci-fi light : science fiction movies that don't require laser guns and spaceships, etc.  Its subject is thought provoking, its characters are memorable and well portrayed, and its overall presentation is top-notch.The events following the signal's detection are spot on, as director Robert Zemeckis captures brilliantly the reaction and events that would most likely follow an event of this magnitude.  I view what he presents not as a swipe at humanity, but as a snapshot of its current state.  Religious zealots to scam artists to a media feeding frenzy are presented here, not to mention rather accurately and believably.  The political, religious, social, and moral fallout of such an event are also presented here extremely well.The movie's climax (Ellie's final destination) is not only satisfying, but also intentionally ambiguous, forcing the viewer to think about what they have just seen, and where she might actually have been.  For the sake of anyone who hasn't seen it, I'm being as vague as possible, so as not to ruin anything.It's probably redundant to say that Jodie Foster was fantastic, but I'll say it anyway.  She is in a category by herself, in terms of acting talent, and she is supported by a great cast featuring Tom Skerritt, Matthew McConaughey, David Morse (a terrific actor in his own right), Angela Bassett, John Hurt, and James Woods, among others.  Also featured are many well-known media figures who had cameos in the movie, adding a level of authenticity to the film.`Contact' definitely deserved more attention at Oscar time the year it was released, and why it didn't receive more, I can't say.

I had read the book, and although obviously there had to be some changes, I thought in general it stayed faithful to the spirit of Carl Sagan. It's good to see a science-fiction movie in which battles with aliens isn't the main theme.One thing surprises me. Although I haven't plowed through all the reviews, nobody seems to have commented on an allusion which I thought was fairly obvious (and is also in the book). Ellie encounters her 'father', who tells her that he has taken this form because it would make her feel more comfortable. He then goes on to say that it has always been done this way. Now, that seems to me to be very sensible; if you wanted to arrange to meet another type of life-form, the best way to do it without provoking alarm would be to adopt the same corporeal form as those whom you going to contact. The suggestion that it has 'always been done this way'.... well, maybe it has, except that it was on this planet.

Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[4, 10]","Plenty of reviews below talk about the plot details, etc, so I will omit that here.What I like best about this film is that it addresses both sides of the Science versus Religion debate, and is equally respectful of both sides.  Jodie Foster's character is a woman of Science, not of God.  But by the story's end she has found her own kind of Faith, though it comes partially because she is unable to provide proof of something that her doubters know darn well does actually exist.My only beef with the film is a minor one but it stuck out like a sore thumb to me:  Late in the film's first act she is explaining what Prime Numbers are to some government men.  She says that prime numbers are ""numbers that are only divisible by themselves and One.""  Thanks for the math lesson, dear screenwriters, but in truth Prime Numbers are only EVENLY divisible by themselves and One.  Yes, there is a difference.  That little error in semantics wasn't the issue for me, however.  The issue is that just a few years before ""Contact"" was made, Jodie Foster directed and starred in ""Little Man Tate"", a film about a young boy with above-average intelligence.  In a science and math contest, the young boy and some other bright kids are asked ""Which of these numbers are divisible by [some integer, like 3]?""  While the other kids think it out, Little Man Tate shouts out ""All of them"", which was technically correct.  The contest moderators were looking for the numbers EVENLY divisible by the integer, but they failed to make that distinction.  Tate caught the mistake and put the quizmasters to shame.  Jodie Foster, having directed that scene, SURELY should have remembered that distinction when delivering her lines in ""Contact"".

100855,A2Q0ERQ25AQQNG,0790733226,Jonas Cukierman,"[3, 4]","The best science-fiction film of 1997 and one of the best of all time. Based on the book by the late Carl Sagan, this film examines the possibility of life on other planets and the means to make ""contact"" with  them. There is however an even more profound question this film ponders. At  the forefront of one of history's oldest battles are the two contenders of  science and religion. The story begins with Eleanor Arroway (Jodie Foster  in one of the greatest female roles I have ever seen on film) as a young  girl. As an extraordinarily brilliant child, she shows the making of a  scientist at an early age. The death of her mother and later her father  (both at a very tender age) only push her to explore the limitless  boundaries of the life/faith dilemma. As the film progresses, the  intermingling of science and religion become more apparent. After Arroway  receives what is believed to be a signal of life in outer space, she is  determined to go into space (at risk of death) to explore the origin of the  alien life. What follows before the flight is a plethora of red tape enough  to frustrate God. The religious community, from liberal to fundamentalist,  is determined to make its voice known to the world by apprehending Arroway  and convincing her that it is a question of faith and not science that life  exists. Enter cynic philosopher and Minister Palmer Joss (Matthew  McConaughey). His close relations to Arroway and his visibility on the  world stage create a fabulous breeding ground for conflict and make the  audience think hard about the dual truths and ambiguities of both religion  and science. In fact, the line between science and faith almost seems to  disappear at times. In the end, we are left to our own conclusions about  what is what, but not without feeling that science and religion have both  been given a fair shake. If you are expecting laserbattles and  intergalactic dictators on mega-spaceships, then Contact will certainly  disappoint you. However, if you are expecting to dive deeply into the  thought process and see a Sci-fi film, which is more on the philosophical  side with, many questions left unanswered (like 2001: A Space Odyssey),  then you are in for a great voyage into the unknown. The best thing about  this film aside from the material it approaches is the handpicked cast.  Aside from Foster, James Woods is remarkable as a starchy-shirt, bureaucrat  who refuses to bend to what he cannot see, Angela Bassett is the  open-minded and contemporary believer in the science community who is more  willing to accept Foster's story than anybody else. John Hurt is the  eccentric billionaire who is Foster's only real ticket to the spaceflight.  On a less powerful note, McConaughey is unable to make his role interesting  or even the least bit appealing. The only thing he can convince us of is  that he cannot deliver such a powerful character as his is supposed to be.",5,"Thought provoking science theory, not just sci fi.",959040000,"05 23, 2000",2000,2929,"['best', 'science-fiction', 'film', '1997', 'one', 'best', 'time', 'Based', 'book', 'late', 'Carl', 'Sagan', 'film', 'possibility', 'life', 'other', 'planets', 'means', 'make', 'contact', 'however', 'even', 'more', 'profound', 'question', 'film', 'ponders', 'forefront', 'one', 'history', 'oldest', 'battles', 'are', 'two', 'contenders', 'science', 'religion', 'story', 'Eleanor', 'Arroway', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'one', 'greatest', 'female', 'roles', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'young', 'girl', 'extraordinarily', 'brilliant', 'child', 'making', 'scientist', 'early', 'age', 'death', 'mother', 'later', 'father', 'very', 'tender', 'age', 'only', 'explore', 'limitless', 'boundaries', 'life/faith', 'dilemma', 'film', 'intermingling', 'science', 'religion', 'become', 'more', 'apparent', 'Arroway', 'what', 'believed', 'be', 'signal', 'life', 'outer', 'space', 'determined', 'go', 'space', 'risk', 'death', 'explore', 'origin', 'alien', 'life', 'What', 'flight', 'plethora', 'red', 'tape', 'enough', 'frustrate', 'God', 'religious', 'community', 'liberal', 'fundamentalist', 'determined', 'make', 'voice', 'known', 'world', 'apprehending', 'Arroway', 'convincing', 'question', 'faith', 'not', 'science', 'life', 'exists', 'Enter', 'cynic', 'philosopher', 'Minister', 'Palmer', 'Joss', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'close', 'relations', 'Arroway', 'visibility', 'world', 'stage', 'create', 'fabulous', 'breeding', 'ground', 'conflict', 'make', 'audience', 'think', 'hard', 'dual', 'truths', 'ambiguities', 'religion', 'science', 'fact', 'line', 'science', 'faith', 'almost', 'disappear', 'times', 'end', 'are', 'left', 'own', 'conclusions', 'what', 'what', 'not', 'feeling', 'science', 'religion', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'fair', 'shake', 'are', 'expecting', 'laserbattles', 'intergalactic', 'dictators', 'mega-spaceships', 'then', 'Contact', 'will', 'certainly', 'disappoint', 'However', 'are', 'expecting', 'dive', 'deeply', 'thought', 'process', 'see', 'Sci-fi', 'film', 'more', 'philosophical', 'side', 'many', 'questions', 'left', 'unanswered', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'then', 'are', 'great', 'voyage', 'unknown', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'aside', 'material', 'handpicked', 'cast', 'Aside', 'Foster', 'James', 'Woods', 'remarkable', 'starchy-shirt', 'bureaucrat', 'who', 'bend', 'what', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'open-minded', 'contemporary', 'believer', 'science', 'community', 'who', 'more', 'willing', 'accept', 'Foster', 'story', 'anybody', 'else', 'John', 'Hurt', 'eccentric', 'billionaire', 'who', 'Foster', 'only', 'real', 'ticket', 'spaceflight', 'less', 'powerful', 'note', 'McConaughey', 'unable', 'make', 'role', 'interesting', 'even', 'least', 'bit', 'appealing', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'convince', 'can', 'not', 'deliver', 'such', 'powerful', 'character', 'supposed', 'be']",Contact

Well the title, opening and ending are the same but most of the rest is new. As a film it was o-kay but as an adaptation it was pretty bad.Radio telescopes pick up a signal from space. The signal has many levels and originates from a system that has been too quiet. In the signal there appears to be the instructions for building some sort of machine. The machine is built and sabotaged. A second machine is activated and the movie's star has an experience unobserved from Earth.It is common to shrink casts to make a book fit in a movie. In this case it lengthened it. By cutting the team down to one person there was suddenly a lot of politics about what single person could represent all of Earth. After the return it is one person's word, not a team's, against the evidence.I was not a big fan of the book when it came out (the characters jumped to too many conclusions and I didn't like the ending). The film 2001: A Space Odyssey becomes the template for the journey with language lifted right from the novelization (of 2001, that is) thus weakening the story even further.One way to think of it is that if this film mated with Independence Day then the offspring would be The Arrival. While The Arrival does the contact bit better Contact is still fun to watch. Tom Skerrit makes an excellent low-key bad guy.

100862,A1VZLLDNLURGJB,0790733226,Keith Mirenberg,"[1, 1]","I rate Contact (1997) a five star film which featured wonderful Jodie Foster. This movie played well on a conventional TV, but did not hold up well on a LCD 52"" HDTV and upward compatible DVD player. If you really love this film the way I do, I would suggest definitely getting it in Blu Ray.I can't say enough about what a fine job was done in making this film. Jodie Foster was able to perform in a totally synthetic environment while delivering (I think) one of her finest performances, delivering a breathless rapture suitable for the cosmic occasion presented. The computer graphics were the best and totally believable. Overall, the cast, direction, pacing, CGI were great and the special effects were meticulously done. The musical score and story were just great.The film was dedicated to Carl Sagan who wrote the original book and helped with the screenplay and is a fine testimonial to the man.I went to the single star reviews and found that this movie was rated as a stinker by a considerable number of people, some of which down rated it because of the compromises it made regarding the fact that Sagan was apparently a registered atheist! They appeared to be upset that this film made some kind of case for faith. It did not make a case for religion, however, and just implied that certain ""human experiences"" can never be proven to the satisfaction of a scientist.The human condition of personal experience still exists, despite the condition described in the film as ""the self reinforcing delusion"". I started out in my early years as a strong faith based person, and now that I am a considerably older person find myself becoming more of an agnostic with time, despite the approach of mortality. I don't deny Hollywood the right to make a compromise between faith and evidence for marketing purposes, or whatever. I agree with the gist of the statement that Ellie made about her lack of belief in god.

After decoding the message, NASA builds a large machine that was described in blueprints contained within the message.

Luckily, there is a second machine, secretly built in Japan, and Ellie is chosen to man it. She ends up taking the ride of her life.The movie co-stars Jena Malone as Ellie as a girl, William Fichtner as a blind astro-scientist, James Woods as the National Security Agency head, and Matthew McConaughey as a not-quite-priest who develops a relationship with Ellie.The 2-1/2 hour movie is very well made, has many special effects (some are the type you don't notice), generally good acting, and an interesting premise.The inexpensive DVD has 3 commentaries - one by Zemeckis, one by Foster, and one by the special effects guys; analysis of several specific special effects; sparse analysis of a few computer-animated concepts; includes extensive text-based behinds the scenes information.Based on Carl Sagan's book ""Contact"" which interweaves military, religious and science aspects to space-travel.

So when I gaze into the starry heavens at the countless suns of space, I marvel at how seemingly insignificant it would superficially appear that our planet is and yet just as this movie highlighted the important role that faith plays whether in regards to believing in a Higher Power or believing in the existence of alien beings far removed from our galactic proximity, I do have faith that our sphere (Urantia) is just as precisely administered and just as lovingly fostered as if it were the only inhabited world in all existence.",5,SETI Seeks What Is Already Here,1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,1997,"['someone', 'who', 'are', 'literally', 'trillions', 'inhabited', 'planets', 'out', 'there', 'cosmic', 'playground', 'outer', 'space', 'much', 'origins', 'destiny', 'as', 'well', 'pertaining', 'own', 'planet', 'have', 'been', 'revealed', 'documented', 'last', 'century', 'series', '196', 'Papers', 'known', 'collectively', 'Urantia', 'Papers', 'Urantia', 'Book', 'were', 'authored', 'various', 'Beings-Not-Of-This-Realm', 'who', 'were', 'commissioned', 'bestow', 'epochal', 'revelation', 'planet', 'including', 'translating', 'English', 'language', 'English', 'not', 'native', 'tongue', 'local', 'universe', 'Nebadon', 'superuniverse', 'Orvonton', 'Paradise-Havona', 'Central', 'Universe', 'Divine', 'Perfection', 'dwelling', 'place', 'eternal', 'God', 'everything', 'else', 'everyone', 'else', 'revolves', 'accordance', 'superuniverse', 'plans', 'evolutionary', 'progress', 'spiritual', 'attainment', 'was', 'predictably', 'pleased', 'watch', 'movie', 'asked', 'Are', 'really', 'alone', 'universe', 'universes', 'vast', 'enormity', 'wasted', 'space', 'encircling', 'lifeless', 'set', 'decoration', 'are', 'rather', 'part', 'gigantic', 'undertaking', 'fusing', 'perfection', 'imperfection', 'blending', 'science', 'religion', 'one', 'creatively', 'unfolding', 'project', 'mortal', 'comprehension', 'fully', 'fathom', 'other', 'living', 'beings', 'other', 'inhabited', 'planets', 'who', 'are', 'truest', 'sense', 'cosmic', 'cousins', 'So', 'when', 'gaze', 'starry', 'countless', 'suns', 'space', 'marvel', 'how', 'seemingly', 'insignificant', 'would', 'superficially', 'appear', 'planet', 'yet', 'just', 'movie', 'highlighted', 'important', 'role', 'faith', 'regards', 'believing', 'Higher', 'Power', 'believing', 'existence', 'alien', 'beings', 'far', 'removed', 'galactic', 'proximity', 'do', 'have', 'faith', 'sphere', 'Urantia', 'just', 'precisely', 'administered', 'just', 'lovingly', 'fostered', 'were', 'only', 'inhabited', 'world', 'existence']",Contact

But, like any other human being, she isn't perfect.  Contact, apparently her creative child, ought to pop whatever &quot;genius balloon&quot; the folks in Hollywood have tried to pin on her sleeve.  This movie is slow, overbearing, and not very interesting--quite an accomplishment for a movie involving inter-stellar travel and first contact with intelligent life outside of Earth.  All in all, Foster holds her own compared to the insufferable performance from Matthew McConaughey.  Simply put, he is awful, attempting to portray an intelligent representative of the religious point of view.  He simply isn't up to that task, and comes across as more of a dumb hick way out of his element.  (Has he ever been good in anything?

The film contains two prominent themes: a conflict between science and religion, and the wonder and excitement of discovery.  It is slow-moving and deliberate, and yet contains some incredible special effects in the final act.  The result is an extremely absorbing and up-lifting experience.  Contact centers around a bravura performance by Jodie Foster as Dr. Elinor Arroway, an astronomer obsessed with the idea of life in other galaxies.  The Foster character is in virtually every scene of the movie, but is aided by terrific supporing characters.  In particular there is Ellie's father (David Morse), who motivates her as a child to pursue her dreams; Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), theologian and love interest; and billionaire Hadden (John Hurt - almost unrecognizable), who provides the financial stability for Ellie at just the right moment of her life.  The discovery of a signal from outer space by Ellie triggers the beginning of the second act of the film, and I had great fun at this point watching the world come together, trying to figure out what to do next.  I won't reveal any more, since the key to the enjoyment of the movie is discovering at the same time as the characters.

The scene in which she witnesses the cosmos  and cries, &quot;They should have sent a poet&quot; is breathtaking.Now, the DVD is pretty cool too!  Ms. Foster's commentary channel is a  revelation.  And the step-by-step process of creating the digital effects  is interesting as well.  It is truly amazing what computers have done for  visual effects. I'm not sure I understand how some of the effects were done  even after watching the demo reels on the DVD!They've truly done a first  class job on this DVD.

100914,A7KC2Y7KU4D46,0790733226,mg,"[3, 3]","I liked the movie overall.  The one thing that I would like to discuss is the whole religion aspect.  I think this movie is more ""about"" religion vs science, than anything else.  Even extra-terrestrial contact and the ensuing politics comes a distant second.Carl Sagan was supposedly an agnostic so I think that he was personified by the main character (Dr. Ellie Arroway), who seemed to doubt a supreme being herself.  Watching his series COSMOS, Carl iterates over an over that our civilization would have advanced much more than it did -- if it wasn't for the fact that, at every turn in our history, scientific progress and critical thinking has been stalled, halted, or even set back centuries by religious dunderheads too comfortable in their religious worldview to accept new information.I wonder if he made the religious characters in this movie so unbearably annoying because he was, to a similar degree, personally annoyed with religion in the real, nonfiction world.  I'm not going to tell you my personal views or whether I agree or disagree with [what I perceive as] Carl's annoyance at religion... because this review is about my thoughts on Contact and it's author; not about me.This movie has a strong undertone -- A theme that tries to remain subtle, but shines through clearly whether it was intended to or not by the director:  This undertone is all about the battle between (1) sound scientific reasoning and logic (and 2) the single-minded agenda of science deniers that defend their own beliefs, even against facts themselves.The religious characters in this movie are depicted as naive and gullible characters that are too clouded in their own superstition to see reason.  I like this excerpt of dialog from the movie (little spoiler):~~~~Palmer Joss: Our job was to select someone to speak for everybody. And I just couldn't in good conscience vote for a person who doesn't believe in God. Someone who honestly thinks the other ninety five percent of us suffer from some form of mass delusion.Ellie Arroway: I told the truth up there. And Drumlin told you exactly what you wanted to hear.~~~~Who is right or wrong?  I guess it depends on your own worldview.  When I was younger (years ago), I remember watching this movie and definitely agreeing with one of them; and now that I'm older I re-watched this same movie agree with the opposing character.  I liked the movie equally well when each viewing (separated by years of course), since the movie does a pretty good job of raising both sides arguments without sounding like it's definitively rooting for either.****** Now, this next part has a bit of a spoiler so don't read it if you don't want to ruin the movie ******In the end, the movie portrays a sense of balance -- that neither side is necessarily 100% right or 100% wrong when (1) the main religious figure (Palmer Joss), does in fact exhibit the redeeming quality of being open to the possibility that Ellie Arroway is telling the truth, and (2) the main secular figure (Ellie Arroway) ironically shows ""faith"" in that she truly believes (despite no empirical evidence) that her personal experiences were real and not a delusion; and she also bequests her opponents to have faith in her as well.Finally, there is just one big plot hole in my mind (also a spoiler):If nobody believed her, then why didn't someone else just go in the machine again and verify it?

100915,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,0790733226,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[275, 292]","In 1985, Pulitzer-prize winning author and astronomer Carl Sagan (1934-1996) wrote a brilliant &quot;what-if&quot; scenario in his novel entitled &quot;Contact&quot;.  In the novel, Carl Sagan created a scenario in which his protagonist, a radio astronomer named Dr. Eleanor Ann 'Ellie' Arroway, discovers an extraterrestrial radio transmission that is clearly from an intelligent alien source.  The discovery causes intense debate between the proponents of science, religion and government that eventually leads to some very compelling questions on the nature of faith itself.  In 1997, the novel was transformed into a film of the same name under the direction of the well-known director Robert Zemeckis, who had previously directed &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (1994, for which Zemeckis won the Oscar for Best Director), &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; (1992), &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (1985) and &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; (1984).Carl Sagan, with assistance from writers Ann Druyan, James V. Hart and Michael Goldenberg, slightly modified the original story by giving Dr. Arroway (played by Jodie Foster) a more personal adversary in another astronomer, Dr. David Drumlin (played by Tom Skerritt).  At the beginning of the film, a brief exploration of Dr. Arroway's childhood (played by Jena Malone) is provided that helps to establish her purely scientific perception of reality that resulted in part from the passing away of her father, Ted Arroway (David Morse), who had also encouraged her love of science, astronomy and radio communications.  As an astronomer, Dr. Arroway dedicated her work to the SETI project (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence), which Dr. Drumlin considers frivolous and potentially damaging to Dr. Arroway's credibility.  With her governmental funding cut, Dr. Arroway eventually gets private funding after she approaches one of the world's richest and most influential men, S. R. Hadden (John Hurt).  With funding secured, Dr. Arroway's search continues at the Very Large Array (VLA) near Socorro, New Mexico.  With her unorthodox method of personally listening to outer space static, Dr. Arroway suddenly and unexpectedly hears a bizarre set of sounds.  She immediately gets her team, which includes Kent Clark (William Fichtner), busy working on analyzing the signal, which likely comes from an extraterrestrial source.  Once verified, she announces her discovery to the world via the news media, to the disdain of governmental officials including Dr. Drumlin, National Security Advisor Michael Kitz (James Woods) and then President Bill Clinton (himself via archive footage).  It also gains explosive response from very religious individuals who don't necessarily share Dr. Arroway's enthusiasm, except for Father Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), whom Dr. Arroway met in Puerto Rico in a more than casual sense.  The content of the message itself raises some very large questions.What really brought Carl Sagan's vision to life in &quot;Contact&quot; was placing it within a contemporary timeframe.  This included the use of many real events, people and places that included CNN, the VLA, the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and many cameos from current politicians the television personalities (Jay Leno, Larry King, Geraldine A. Ferraro, Geraldo Rivera to name only a few).  Also, Robert Zemeckis placed actors within archival footage in much the same way as he did with the film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; in 1994.  All of this, as well as superb acting from the principal actors (Jodie Foster, Tom Skerrit, Matthew McConaughey, John Hurt, William Fichtner and James Woods), great cinematography, wonderful sets and great special effects make this a brilliant film.  Other memorable characters include Rachel Constantine (Angela Bassett), Richard Rank (Rob Lowe), the NASA Mission Director (Tucker Smallwood) and Joseph (Jake Busey).  Some of the most memorable scenes in the film include Dr. Arroway hearing the message at the VLA, the public response, the political discussions, Dr. Arroway meeting S.R. Hadden, the machine, Dr. Arroway's relationship with Palmer, the pinnacle event and its aftermath.Overall, I rate &quot;Contact&quot; with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  In my opinion, it portrays many very probable debates and reactions if astronomers ever actually do discover intelligent extraterrestrial communication signals.  I applaud Carl Sagan for his vision, as well as Robert Zemeckis and the many actors and other people involved with the making of this very engaging and compelling film.",5,&quot;Wanna take a

100916,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,0790733226,Michael Butts,"[9, 10]","CONTACT poses the philosophical dilemma revolving around the existence of God..or a God.  Scientists are thought to believe only those things which can be proven...there has always been a battle between religion and science.  Carl Sagan's book and Robert Zemecki's movie are not afraid to approach this dilemma.  And it's ironic that in the end, the scientist faces a panel that asks for proof.  It's a difficult question, and no answers are given.The movie itself is a panoramic visual delight from the awesome opening to Ellie's travel to a distant galaxy.  Although the movie is a little long in the tooth, Zemeckis coaches a dynamite performance from Jodie Foster.  In her role as Ellie, Foster embodies the soul of a woman who has spent her life searching for answers, wanting to believe that there's more to life than us and our planet.  Using her distinctive voice, those beautiful eyes, and her heart-felt performance, Foster brings life to a complex, yet innocent, woman.  Matthew McConaughey as the spiritual former priest, Palmer Joss, uses his star power to enliven an otherwise poorly developed character.  The supporting cast has some good performances from William Fichter, as Ellie's blind companion; James Wood as a slimy National Security director; Tom Skerritt as the underhanded scientist who mocks Ellie and then when something occurs, takes the glory, and Angela Bassett as an aide to the president.  Zemeckis uses his FORREST GUMP technique of inserting the then real President Clinton into the film to authenticate the action.The film works mainly because of Foster.

100921,A2VGKGXSG81KAS,0790733226,Michael J. Berquist,"[12, 13]","I remember walking out of &quot;Contact&quot; struck by how unusual a film it was for a summer release. Not an action film, not a romance flick, not a comedy, &quot;Contact&quot; was a serious exploration of the roles faith  and science play in our daily lives, and it asks a good question of us- how  compassionate are we really? Do we accept the beliefs of others, or do we  stay to our own narrow beliefs? (Appropriately, I saw the movie in our  nation's capitol, just a block or two away from where numerous scenes take  place in the film.)The short and sweet of the plot is this: Jodie Foster  plays an atheist scientist whose quest to find life on another world is  rewarded with a signal one day carrying instructions on how to construct a  machine capable of transporting a human being. I won't give away too much  else. Suffice to say I was impressed by how the film handled the message  and the response- it was not melodramatic and seems quite plausible. The  viewer gets the feeling that if mankind does ever make contact, this would  be how it was done. The question of whether there is extraterrestrial life  out there is a daunting one- to put it mildly it would be the greatest  discovery in the history of mankind and would fundamentally challenge  virtually all of the assumptions mankind has made about our place in the  universe.Foster is quite good, but I found Matthew McConaughey's role as  Foster's love interest and a religious thinker to be a little hard to  swallow. He's a talented actor to be sure (he was terrific in &quot;A Time  to Kill&quot;), but he was miscast here. James Woods and Tom Skerrit don't  impress as the film's two villains, but the story and Foster are strong  enough to carry the movie along despite some weak characters.Does the  movie demonize religion? For the most part: no. The unfortunate casting  aside, McConaughey's character has an important role to play here in making  it abundantly clear that faith and reason need not conflict and that  mankind can believe in god and still be able to question the world around  ourselves. A good message, but one that the film only half-heartedly  makes.In terms of technical execution, &quot;Contact&quot; has much  going for it. It all looks plausible, like we are watching a documentary  instead of a fiction film. The sequences involving CNN reporters and clips  of President Clinton (re-edited to make it appear like he was commenting on  events in the film) blur the line between fiction and fact.On the  balance, well done.

Add to this a love story between our driven scientist and a fallen yet  equally driven spiritualist and you have all the making of a mass of hokum  that in lesser hands would go downhill faster than a Radio Flyer on Mount  Everest.However, we are in the hands of Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump,  Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Back To The Future) who masterfully weaves the  framework drafted by Carl Sagan into a marvelous tapestry.Jodie Foster  is Ellie Arroway, the driven scientist who needs empirical evidence for  anything to exist in her world.  She's part of a SETI (Search for  Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) group about to have their funding pulled by  Dr. David Drumland (Tom Skeritt), who at the film's open is the director of  the National Science Foundation.  Arroway's childhood traumas and  fascinations have fused to turn her into this driven force; she is a woman  with a vision and she is not easily deterred.  Ellie briefly becomes  involved with Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), a man who nearly became a  priest, but who admits that celebacy was a problem for him, which makes him  no less devout as a messenger for God's word.What evolves is a story  that explores the relationship between society, science, and religion.  Its  characters, which could easily fall cartoonish in the wrong hands, are  well-drawn and expertly directed by Zemeckis, who had some prior experience  with 'toons and apparently was aware what to watch out for.Lest you  think my opening was a criticism of Carl Sagan and Ann Dryan's screen  story, it was not.  Sagan and Dryan provided a good story structure for  screenwriters James Hart and Michael Goldenberg to build on.  Zemeckis,  aided by Alan Silvestri's music, keeps it all in tune and doesn't provide  us with pat answers, and yet keeps us interested.One of the more  endearing qualities of this film is its true-to-life representation of what  would happen in America should what happens to Ellie happens to us.

100928,A27PSZX2SE0B51,0790733226,Mike Stone,"[6, 13]","Imagine if Kubrick's &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; was made with late-'90's technology and a Hollywood cast, by -- for better or for worse -- the Spielberg disciple who directed &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;.  You don't have to imagine it, because we have the reality of &quot;Contact&quot;.  I had a lot of problems with this movie, some of which I'll list later, but overall I enjoyed it a lot.The science of the movie was fascinating (even though I'm not familiar with the source material, the late Carl Sagan probably deserves much credit here).  A rag-tag group of science misfits picks up a pulse from outer space, and slowly learns the message contained within.  There's a fine moment near the end of this sequence where a video representation of the message is revealed, and it is a truly stunning moment, that carries much drama.  The message contains plans to build a machine, which will send one person to a distant star, presumably for enlightenment.  The &quot;machine&quot; is gloriously realized.  It is both beautiful and believable, its power palpable and awesome (especially in one scene where things go horribly wrong).  Director Robert Zemeckis uses his considerable skill at special effects very wisely here, giving us enough to keep the imagination entertained but never overwhelming the story.Unfortunately, the less technical aspects of the movie are handled quite sloppily.First, the acting.  James Woods and John Hurt, two actors I admire, had a tough time fleshing out their two-dimensional characters.  Woods didn't do anything more than show narrow-mindedness and anger, while Hurt was stuck in eccentric billionaire mode.  Rob Lowe, also playing a two-dimensional character, was just painful to watch, affecting a hoarse voice and a beatific smile that did little to hide the fact that his character was no more than a fluffy device to introduce basic religious arguments.  Ditto Jake Busey, as an over the top zealot who carried the added detriment of an albino fright wig and &quot;evil&quot; white-eyes.  Tom Skerritt fared better, although he was miscast.  Skerritt is usually fine when playing the saintly father figure; here he's asked to be a slick, egotistical bureaucrat, and doesn't pull it off.  Which brings us to Matthew McConaughey.  I had no problem with his acting, but the character was completely implausible.  A man with a self-help book at number one on the bestseller list would not get this much time with the President, especially if his ideas were as lame as Matt's 'Palmer Joss'.  He represents a bigger problem with the movie, in that the fight between science and religion is handled in a very passionate, but utterly simple-minded way.  I suspect that some of the book's big ideas and arguments were dumbed down for a mass audience.  It's unfortunate, wasting an opportunity for intelligent mass discourse.The lone bright spot in the cast is -- duh -- Jodie Foster.  I admit to being ambivalent about Foster in the past, but here she won me over.  Her Dr. Arroway is meant to have passion, drive, brains, desire, spunk, and innocence.  Foster pulls off all of these traits wonderfully.  There were some moments near the end, when Arroway takes flight (&quot;They should have sent a poet,&quot; she cries when confronted by an ineffable view of space), that in the hands of a lesser actor would be hokey.  Foster gets them all right.I get the impression that Zemeckis himself doesn't trust the weight of the ideas he's putting forth here, because he does several things that distract the audience from them.  First, the relationship between a young Arroway and her father was manipulation of the highest order.  It's pop psychology that anyone can understand on an emotional level, rather than the intellectual level, which should have been the movie's strength.  Also, he employs &quot;testimony&quot; from real-world media figures (it seemed like the entire staff of CNN appeared on screen at one point or another) to lend the ideas credibility.  In fact, the ideas were undermined because of this.  The same can be said for his liberal use of news footage of President Clinton, whose intentionally vague speeches are supposed to relate to the film's narrative, but rather prove distracting.There is a lot of potential in &quot;Contact&quot;.  I was gripped by the story, even though a lot of the times I felt like a machete-wielding explorer hacking my way through a jungle of debris to get to it (I have the sneaking suspicion that Zemeckis realizes this, for he includes a take-off of the line &quot;Dr. Livingstone, I presume&quot;).

100936,AB5DVSNPX1JSK,0790733226,"Mr. Fisher ""grand_clown""","[0, 3]","Contact was a film that interested me from the get go.  I loved the idea, and I guess I still do: a chance to make contact with Alien life and making it come across as real.  There is no question that this film provides a realness, an authenticity of plot mixed in with good acting.  What Contact lacks however is some contact with originality and general audience appeal and satisfaction.  Now what in the world did I just say?  Well let's analyze this movie:Arroway played by the supberb actress Jodie Foster is a scientist who goes out of her way to be the first to make contact with recent Alien life that eventually becomes national, meaning it becomes obvious to the public.  Now two good things here that I liked:1. It pretty much avoided the cliche of the big ""government conspiracy"" that so many sci-fi films feel they must have (until the end).  The government and public are just as surprised by the sudden alien contact as any one else.2. You don't get to see Aliens, they are left up to the viewers imagination.  Another words, you don't know what this out of space life is.  This maintains interest and suspense.Now, here's where it lacks originality.  Arroway is not an original character.  She's a scientist, a believer in new life out there, explorer, etc.  This is the character ""we"" as the audience would expect to be the main character.  Although it may be what we expect, that doesn't make it original.  What makes Close Encounters of the Third Kind better is that the main characters were ordinary people, with no expertise, learning and changing and developing as the film progresses.  Arroway changes hardly at all, because practically the film is about everything changing for HER.  Everything opens up to her from opportunities to beliefs.  We don't sympathize with her because she doesn't grow, only the plot grows around her.  And it should be the other way around.Another cliche is Skerritt's death.  I'm sorry, you knew that was going to happen.  You knew some accident was going to take place to keep him from going up so Arroway could go in his place.  This plot is good, but it is at the same time predictable.  And because it's predictable, some of suspense goes down the drain.Now the worst of all worst cliches in the movie is when she makes actual ""contact"" with a being that's in the shape of her father.  How utterly stupid.  How many films have I seen now that have this?  Visited by an image of her father, a ghost like figure, so many films do this.  They have to ruin this film by making the ""contact"" turning out to be a relative of hers.  There is no satisfaction to this, all the suspense during the whole film of wanting to know WHAT is trying to make contact is answered by adaptation of her father?!  What a waste.That costed it one star, the cliches and the wasted suspense of this movie.  What costed it another star was that I really did not like the political/religious bias and slams and cliches in this movie.  I'm sure Athiests love this movie, because religion is dissed big time in this.  Half this movie was not about the contact from another life form, but rather the struggle between theoretical differences (Athiests vs. Religion).  This did create drama and friction between characters such as between Arroway and Palmer (Matthew McC.).  However, it came across as if this film had another objective in mind.  As if it was on a mission to show up religions and make it appear as if ""religion is the doorstopper in progression.""I'm not the only one who thinks this, who was a little offended by how someone who believes in God is represented.  Sorry, Palmer didn't make a very convincing religious person.  He basically shies away from Arroway when the topic comes up, as if ""he knows she's right.""  And naturally for villains, the director has it be these religious wackos.  Then when Arroway is being interviewed by world leaders, they make it appear as if she's being persecuted for not having a religious belief.Again, these are all slams and cliches against religion, and some of us like to see better representation in movies if it's going to be an essential element of the movie.  Not that the issue has to be ignored in movies, but create a balance not a bias.  Otherwise, leave the subject alone if you can't accurately or fairly represent the other side.  Because quite clearly there was an anti-religious agenda in this movie and I felt it uncalled for.Other than the biasness and the lack of originality in climax and character, this film has a good storyline.  It has great acting, it is a very believable film.  And if not for these blackmarks, I would've considered among my top favorite sci-fi films.  But the director made a classic mistake in dividing the audience by slamming a belief system rather than telling a story without the anti-spiritual agenda.Grade: C",3,Contact makes rough contact,1064707200,"09 28, 2003",2003,4843,"['Contact', 'was', 'film', 'interested', 'get', 'go', 'loved', 'idea', 'guess', 'still', 'do', 'chance', 'make', 'contact', 'Alien', 'life', 'making', 'come', 'real', 'question', 'film', 'realness', 'authenticity', 'plot', 'mixed', 'good', 'acting', 'What', 'Contact', 'however', 'contact', 'originality', 'general', 'audience', 'appeal', 'satisfaction', 'Now', 'what', 'world', 'did', 'just', 'say', 'Well', 'let', 'analyze', 'movie', 'Arroway', 'played', 'supberb', 'actress', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'scientist', 'who', 'way', 'be', 'first', 'make', 'contact', 'recent', 'Alien', 'life', 'eventually', 'national', 'meaning', 'obvious', 'public', 'Now', 'two', 'good', 'things', 'here', 'liked:1', 'pretty', 'much', 'avoided', 'cliche', 'big', 'government', 'conspiracy', 'so', 'many', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'feel', 'must', 'have', 'end', 'government', 'public', 'are', 'just', 'surprised', 'sudden', 'alien', 'contact', 'one', 'else.2', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'Aliens', 'are', 'left', 'up', 'viewers', 'imagination', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'out', 'space', 'life', 'interest', 'suspense.Now', 'here', 'where', 'originality', 'Arroway', 'not', 'original', 'character', 'scientist', 'believer', 'new', 'life', 'there', 'explorer', 'etc', 'character', 'audience', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'main', 'character', 'may', 'be', 'what', 'expect', ""n't"", 'make', 'original', 'What', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'Kind', 'better', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'ordinary', 'people', 'expertise', 'learning', 'changing', 'developing', 'film', 'Arroway', 'changes', 'hardly', 'practically', 'film', 'everything', 'changing', 'HER', 'Everything', 'up', 'opportunities', 'beliefs', 'do', ""n't"", 'sympathize', ""n't"", 'grow', 'only', 'plot', 'should', 'be', 'other', 'way', 'cliche', 'Skerritt', 'death', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'knew', 'accident', 'was', 'going', 'take', 'place', 'keep', 'going', 'up', 'so', 'Arroway', 'could', 'go', 'place', 'plot', 'good', 'same', 'time', 'predictable', 'predictable', 'suspense', 'down', 'drain.Now', 'worst', 'worst', 'cliches', 'movie', 'when', 'actual', 'contact', 'being', 'shape', 'father', 'How', 'utterly', 'stupid', 'How', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'now', 'have', 'Visited', 'image', 'father', 'ghost', 'figure', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'do', 'have', 'ruin', 'film', 'making', 'contact', 'turning', 'out', 'be', 'relative', 'hers', 'satisfaction', 'suspense', 'whole', 'film', 'wanting', 'know', 'WHAT', 'trying', 'make', 'contact', 'answered', 'adaptation', 'father', 'What', 'costed', 'one', 'star', 'cliches', 'wasted', 'suspense', 'movie', 'What', 'costed', 'star', 'was', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'political/religious', 'bias', 'slams', 'cliches', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Athiests', 'love', 'movie', 'religion', 'dissed', 'big', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'contact', 'life', 'form', 'rather', 'struggle', 'theoretical', 'differences', 'Athiests', 'vs', 'Religion', 'did', 'create', 'drama', 'friction', 'characters', 'such', 'Arroway', 'Palmer', 'Matthew', 'McC.', 'However', 'came', 'film', 'had', 'objective', 'mind', 'was', 'mission', 'show', 'up', 'religions', 'make', 'appear', 'religion', 'doorstopper', 'progression', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'who', 'was', 'little', 'offended', 'how', 'someone', 'who', 'God', 'represented', 'Sorry', 'Palmer', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'very', 'convincing', 'religious', 'person', 'basically', 'away', 'Arroway', 'when', 'topic', 'up', 'right', 'naturally', 'villains', 'director', 'be', 'religious', 'wackos', 'Then', 'when', 'Arroway', 'being', 'interviewed', 'world', 'leaders', 'make', 'appear', 'being', 'persecuted', 'not', 'having', 'religious', 'belief.Again', 'are', 'slams', 'cliches', 'religion', 'see', 'better', 'representation', 'movies', 'going', 'be', 'essential', 'element', 'movie', 'Not', 'issue', 'be', 'ignored', 'movies', 'create', 'balance', 'not', 'bias', 'Otherwise', 'leave', 'subject', 'alone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accurately', 'fairly', 'represent', 'other', 'side', 'quite', 'clearly', 'was', 'anti-religious', 'agenda', 'movie', 'felt', 'uncalled', 'for.Other', 'biasness', 'lack', 'originality', 'climax', 'character', 'film', 'good', 'storyline', 'great', 'acting', 'very', 'believable', 'film', 'not', 'blackmarks', 'would', ""'ve"", 'considered', 'top', 'favorite', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'director', 'made', 'classic', 'mistake', 'dividing', 'audience', 'slamming', 'belief', 'system', 'rather', 'telling', 'story', 'anti-spiritual', 'agenda.Grade', 'C']",Contact

It's well made, entertaining, and compelling. As a science fiction movie, Contact is OK, as long as you ignore it's lack of faithfulness to Carl Sagan's novel of the same name. It's really a political drama in which the sci-fi element is the MacGuffin.As a time capsule of the late 1990's, it excels at using faked news media to make it seem real. The special effects are excellent. The cynicism in the way government operates, the manipulative abilities of the extremely wealthy, the fairly negative view of humanity, and the emphasis on spirituality and God deliver a conservative message that today's Evangelical Christians and Tea Party should find quite appealing.Unfortunately, it's one of those movies where you really want the entire movie to be the first 15 minutes because what happens next is more interesting than the first two hours - especially if you're interested in it as a sci-fi film. (Which, of course, would have taken it even further away from Sagen's book.)I must say that I kept wanting Jody Foster to give Matthew McConaughey a good swift kick in the gonads and send him packing, but she never did.This film, while not a masterpiece, is a solid and entertaining film that will hold up well to the test of time. After writing this, I took a look at Roger Ebert's review. I usually find that he and I have similar taste and tend to rate films similarly - although it is often for very different reasons. Roger gave this film 5 stars and thinks it is, in fact, a masterpiece. So, do take a look at Contact and decide for yourself whether Roger Ebert got it right and I got it wrong.

The same is true of Tom Skerrit's Big Bad Boss Who's Only In It For The Glory.For all that, you're certainly left mulling over the notion of contact, in all its manifestations (you know, with little green men, with other human beings, with your lost father, with your spiritual side etc.) throughout, and given that the author of the screenplay was a thoroughly scientific and sceptical chap, the final message is one of surprising humility and irony.Ostensibly the conflict is between science (which needs to know The Truth, whatever the religious consequences) and blind faith.

100959,A26972KFFGMG0W,0790733226,Peter F. Ward,"[8, 33]","Contact is avowed atheist Carl Sagan's glorious swan song, a brilliant treatment of the hypocrisy of religion and establishment. Jodie Foster is characteristically excellent as Dr. Ellie Arroway, the gifted astronomer whose discovery of an alien beacon sets off a frenzy for control of how the discovery should be handled.  Dr. Arroway is slapped down at every turn by those who do not appreciate her independent thinking. Her dilemma reflects the logical fallacy at the heart of all religion. When she will not accept on faith the ""truths"" imposed on her by religious zealots, she is denied the chance to be a part of a mission based on her research. Later, she is ridiculed for asking others to accept what she has seen with her own eyes.  Purists among us will quibble over some of the film's science, particularly in an early scene where Dr. Arroway, a brilliant mathemetician, miscalculates the odds of finding advanced civilizations in the universe by orders of magnitude. But the film has many worthy diversions. Matthew McConaughey, as Palmer Joss, is supposedly the good guy among the religious right. He is cunning and calculating, and like most religious fanatics, he is willing to do anything to get his way, especially if it includes a chance to punish nonbelievers. But Rob Lowe is priceless as Richard Rank, a thinly veiled version of Ralph Reed, a bigoted, hateful power monger who wields his flock as a sword to further his political interests.  Tom Skerritt's Dr. Drumlin lacks dimension, but is right on as the Machievellian politician exploiting Arroway's discovery. The supporting cast is sterling, including Angela Bassett, Jake Busey and David Morse, as Dr. Arroway's father. But the gem of the supporting cast is John Hurt. He is utterly magnificent as the ominous S. R. Hadden, the Howard Hughes-like scientist who lives on an airplane and funds the research that leads to the discovery of the alien signal.  Trivia note: one of Dr. Arroway's colleagues is Dr. Kent Clark, and I can't help but wonder what Sagan implies by that, aside from the obvious.  Far better than the typical Sci-Fi fare, Contact is a thoughtful and challenging look into the relationship between science and religion. It isn't hard, from watching the movie, to determine which side of the conflict Sagan came down on.",1,A brilliant treatment of the hypocrisy of religion and establishment.,1224460800,"10 20, 2008",2008,2316,"['Contact', 'avowed', 'atheist', 'Carl', 'Sagan', 'glorious', 'swan', 'song', 'brilliant', 'treatment', 'hypocrisy', 'religion', 'establishment', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'characteristically', 'excellent', 'Dr.', 'Ellie', 'Arroway', 'gifted', 'astronomer', 'discovery', 'alien', 'beacon', 'sets', 'off', 'frenzy', 'control', 'how', 'discovery', 'should', 'be', 'handled', 'Dr.', 'Arroway', 'slapped', 'down', 'turn', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'appreciate', 'independent', 'thinking', 'dilemma', 'logical', 'fallacy', 'heart', 'religion', 'When', 'will', 'not', 'accept', 'truths', 'imposed', 'religious', 'zealots', 'denied', 'chance', 'be', 'part', 'mission', 'based', 'research', 'Later', 'ridiculed', 'asking', 'others', 'accept', 'what', 'seen', 'own', 'eyes', 'Purists', 'will', 'quibble', 'film', 'science', 'particularly', 'early', 'scene', 'where', 'Dr.', 'Arroway', 'brilliant', 'mathemetician', 'odds', 'finding', 'advanced', 'civilizations', 'universe', 'orders', 'magnitude', 'film', 'many', 'worthy', 'diversions', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Palmer', 'Joss', 'supposedly', 'good', 'guy', 'religious', 'right', 'cunning', 'calculating', 'most', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'way', 'especially', 'chance', 'punish', 'nonbelievers', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'priceless', 'Richard', 'Rank', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'version', 'Ralph', 'Reed', 'bigoted', 'hateful', 'power', 'monger', 'who', 'flock', 'sword', 'further', 'political', 'interests', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'Dr.', 'Drumlin', 'dimension', 'right', 'Machievellian', 'politician', 'exploiting', 'Arroway', 'discovery', 'supporting', 'cast', 'sterling', 'including', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Jake', 'Busey', 'David', 'Morse', 'Dr.', 'Arroway', 'father', 'gem', 'supporting', 'cast', 'John', 'Hurt', 'utterly', 'magnificent', 'ominous', 'S.', 'R.', 'Hadden', 'Howard', 'Hughes-like', 'scientist', 'who', 'airplane', 'funds', 'research', 'discovery', 'alien', 'signal', 'Trivia', 'note', 'one', 'Dr.', 'Arroway', 'colleagues', 'Dr.', 'Kent', 'Clark', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'what', 'Sagan', 'aside', 'obvious', 'Far', 'better', 'typical', 'Sci-Fi', 'fare', 'Contact', 'thoughtful', 'challenging', 'look', 'relationship', 'science', 'religion', ""n't"", 'hard', 'watching', 'movie', 'determine', 'side', 'conflict', 'Sagan', 'came', 'down']",Contact

Planet earth is a spec of dust within it all, yet we humans are so pompous we actually find it difficut to believe there is other life out there. But not Ellie(Jodie Foster). She had the faith to believe in such possibilites, and by sticking with her hope she discovers the greatest breakthrough in human history, and was then left to stand aside while goverment scrutiny and red tape made their own decisions and not for the best.

Though much of what we hear coming from the mouth of Dr. Arroway (Jodie Foster), as directed at Palmer Joss (McConaughey), is presented with such an attempt at persuasion as you'd find in the characters of an Ayn Rand novel, the basic story is that life is a precious possession, to be cherished for all it is at the present moment.

We are really left wondering about just what the actual ""phenomenon"" is that we have witnessed, since evidence proves finally lacking for the rigorously-grounded scientist to follow.  Sagan's awareness of the kind of fringe groups that ""are out there"" is illustrated by the mass-celebration and -demonstration held outside the Very Large Array, even to include a chapter of the Chevy Vega collectors' association, in honor of the star that has finally heard our stray RF from the 1930's and sent back its reply.  The response of the Clinton administration (though I understand the clip of him giving a press conference was lifted from another context) in militarizing the project might even find support among the UFO conspiracy-types.

Einstein, it has been said, asked all of his important questions before the age of twenty-five, then spent the rest of his life working on them.  ""Contact,"" directed by Robert Zemeckis, is the story of a young scientist, Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster), who like Einstein and all the greats before her, has been asking questions and seeking answers since she was very young.  And now, as a member of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) team, she is able to pursue her obsession with the mysteries of the galaxies and the infinite universe that surrounds us.  Her job is to sweep the skies, using the most sophisticated equipment available, for a signal from deepest space.  It may be her job, but for Ellie it's a labor of love, for she is convinced that there is something, or someone, out there somewhere, because otherwise, she reasons, what a terrible waste of space it would be.  Ellie may be a dreamer, but she knows in her heart that it is the dreamers who over the years have been responsible for making us evolve, making us learn and grow because they are the ones who take insane, foolish ideas and pursue them.  And to her, two-plus-two will always be five.Ellie loves her job and believes in what she is doing, but it's been a struggle over the years, as she and others have had to constantly fight for the funding necessary to keep the project alive, begging for dollars from short-sighted, unimaginative people with vision that goes only as far as the bottom line of their budget book.  It's been a tough row to hoe, and she's had to swallow a lot of pride over the years, but then one day it all pays off, when in one magic moment she hears what she's been waiting for all her life:  A signal from a distant end of the galaxy-- someone attempting to communicate, to make contact, with the people of the Earth.Ellie and her team soon realize that, whomever it is, they are using the universal language of prime numbers in their attempts at making contact; and when Ellie deciphers the code, she discovers something monumental in the bargain.  But it's a message of global importance, something much bigger than she and her team alone, and she soon find herself fighting to remain a part of the drama that is only beginning to unfold-- the first interaction between human beings and an alien life form.  And it's only the beginning of the adventure and the wondrous places this film is about to take you.Jodie Foster gives a performance here that demonstrates what a gifted, talented actor she is.  Her Ellie is convincing and believable, and someone to whom you can genuinely relate, no matter who you are or where you're from, because there is something universal in Ellie's passion and longing to discover the truth and to see beyond the veil of our limited mortal capacities.  There's a strength to Ellie, born of a combination of intelligence and innocence, as well as tenacity and faith, and Foster manifests all of these complexities of her character beautifully, with a performance that should've landed her an Oscar nomination.  In this role, she is simply as good as it gets.As the young Ellie, Jenna Malone gives a terrific performance, also, which certainly captures the same spirit that we find in the adult Ellie.  And there's a maturity she brings to the character that far exceeds her years.  She was a perfect choice for the part, and if this is any indication of what she is capable of, Malone has a successful career ahead of her.The supporting cast includes David Morse (Ted Arroway), Matthew McConaughey (Palmer), Geoffrey Blake (Fisher), William Fichtner (Kent), Tom Skerritt (David), James Woods (Kitz) and Angela Bassett (Rachel).  Zemeckis did a brilliant job of bringing this film to fruition, especially in the way he allowed Foster the time to really develop her character, by giving her that extra moment at just the right time that ultimately meant so much in the final analysis.  Too often it's those few minutes that wind up on the cutting room floor that make the difference between  a good film and an exceptional one; and between Zemeckis and Foster, they took it to the edge by taking some chances to realize that combined vision, which in the end made this a great film.  Thoroughly engrossing and entertaining, ""Contact"" will transport you to places you can only imagine, and it's all done with style and in a way that makes this a truly memorable cinematic journey.  It's what the magic of the movies is all about.",5,"Foster, Zemeckis Realize Sagan's Vision",993427200,"06 25, 2001",2001,4759,"['greatest', 'work', 'greatest', 'scientists', 'been', 'done', 'were', 'very', 'young', 'when', 'were', 'stupid', 'enough', 'believe', 'two-plus-two-equals-five', 'pursued', 'instead', 'listening', 'who', 'were', 'much', 'older', 'wiser', 'who', 'said', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Waste', 'Your', 'Time', 'Einstein', 'been', 'said', 'asked', 'important', 'questions', 'age', 'twenty-five', 'then', 'spent', 'rest', 'life', 'working', 'Contact', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'story', 'young', 'scientist', 'Ellie', 'Arroway', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'who', 'Einstein', 'greats', 'been', 'asking', 'questions', 'seeking', 'answers', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'now', 'member', 'SETI', 'Search', 'Extraterrestrial', 'Intelligence', 'team', 'able', 'pursue', 'obsession', 'mysteries', 'galaxies', 'infinite', 'universe', 'job', 'sweep', 'skies', 'using', 'most', 'sophisticated', 'equipment', 'available', 'signal', 'deepest', 'space', 'may', 'be', 'job', 'Ellie', 'labor', 'love', 'convinced', 'something', 'someone', 'there', 'somewhere', 'otherwise', 'reasons', 'what', 'terrible', 'waste', 'space', 'would', 'be', 'Ellie', 'may', 'be', 'dreamer', 'heart', 'dreamers', 'who', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'responsible', 'making', 'evolve', 'making', 'learn', 'grow', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'take', 'insane', 'foolish', 'ideas', 'pursue', 'two-plus-two', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'five.Ellie', 'job', 'what', 'doing', 'been', 'struggle', 'years', 'others', 'have', 'had', 'constantly', 'fight', 'funding', 'necessary', 'keep', 'project', 'alive', 'begging', 'dollars', 'short-sighted', 'unimaginative', 'people', 'vision', 'only', 'as', 'far', 'bottom', 'line', 'budget', 'book', 'been', 'tough', 'row', 'hoe', 'had', 'swallow', 'lot', 'pride', 'years', 'then', 'one', 'day', 'off', 'when', 'one', 'magic', 'moment', 'what', 'been', 'waiting', 'life', 'signal', 'distant', 'end', 'galaxy', 'someone', 'attempting', 'communicate', 'make', 'contact', 'people', 'Earth.Ellie', 'team', 'soon', 'realize', 'whomever', 'are', 'using', 'universal', 'language', 'prime', 'numbers', 'attempts', 'making', 'contact', 'when', 'Ellie', 'code', 'something', 'monumental', 'bargain', 'message', 'global', 'importance', 'something', 'much', 'bigger', 'team', 'alone', 'soon', 'find', 'fighting', 'remain', 'part', 'drama', 'only', 'beginning', 'unfold', 'first', 'interaction', 'human', 'beings', 'alien', 'life', 'form', 'only', 'beginning', 'adventure', 'wondrous', 'places', 'film', 'take', 'you.Jodie', 'Foster', 'performance', 'here', 'what', 'gifted', 'talented', 'actor', 'Ellie', 'convincing', 'believable', 'someone', 'whom', 'can', 'genuinely', 'relate', 'matter', 'who', 'are', 'where', ""'re"", 'something', 'universal', 'Ellie', 'passion', 'longing', 'discover', 'truth', 'see', 'veil', 'limited', 'mortal', 'capacities', 'strength', 'Ellie', 'born', 'combination', 'intelligence', 'innocence', 'as', 'well', 'tenacity', 'faith', 'Foster', 'complexities', 'character', 'beautifully', 'performance', 'should', ""'ve"", 'landed', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'role', 'simply', 'as', 'good', 'young', 'Ellie', 'Jenna', 'Malone', 'terrific', 'performance', 'also', 'certainly', 'same', 'spirit', 'find', 'adult', 'Ellie', 'maturity', 'character', 'far', 'years', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'part', 'indication', 'what', 'capable', 'Malone', 'successful', 'career', 'ahead', 'her.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'David', 'Morse', 'Ted', 'Arroway', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Palmer', 'Geoffrey', 'Blake', 'Fisher', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'Kent', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'David', 'James', 'Woods', 'Kitz', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Rachel', 'Zemeckis', 'did', 'brilliant', 'job', 'bringing', 'film', 'fruition', 'especially', 'way', 'allowed', 'Foster', 'time', 'really', 'develop', 'character', 'giving', 'extra', 'moment', 'just', 'right', 'time', 'ultimately', 'meant', 'so', 'much', 'final', 'analysis', 'Too', 'often', 'few', 'minutes', 'wind', 'up', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'make', 'difference', 'good', 'film', 'exceptional', 'one', 'Zemeckis', 'Foster', 'took', 'edge', 'taking', 'chances', 'realize', 'combined', 'vision', 'end', 'made', 'great', 'film', 'Thoroughly', 'engrossing', 'entertaining', 'Contact', 'will', 'transport', 'places', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'done', 'style', 'way', 'truly', 'memorable', 'cinematic', 'journey', 'what', 'magic', 'movies']",Contact

Robert Zemeckis' movie cleverly takes a look at what would happen if we discovered evidence that we are not alone. It sets itself apart from blockbuster science fiction like &quot;Independence Day&quot; because of how realistic it is, how convincing and plausible. The screenplay by James V. Hart and Michael Goldenberg, based on the novel by Carl Sagan, is filled with interesting characters, but more with interesting ideas. We also appreciate how they add philosophical arguments into the mix. Most science fiction films don't really explore the debates about God and science, this movie does, by letting the two main characters debate about the issues. The movie is also entertaining on the dramatic angle and the special effects are wonderful to look at. The movie has style and realism mixed with science and deep philosophical issues. I have nothing against the &quot;cool&quot; stuff like &quot;ID4&quot; or &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; but &quot;Contact&quot; is a breather for people looking for something smart and thoughtful.

Each time I watch this movie, I'm left wondering how Contact is time and time again glossed over and seemingly forgotten. It's a true work of art; a beautiful, inspiring, self-affirming and hope filled tale of one woman's ambitious spiritual and scientific journey through the monumental discovery of alien life. This film does not pander to the blockbuster Michael Bay super-explosion loving crowd of ""aliens vs humans'' plotlines that seem to dominate sci-fi, it's much deeper than that. This film is about how little, insignificant and infantile we are as a species, and how there may be millions of advanced creatures out there willing and ready to guide us through our evolution as a species if only we can find a way past all the troubling and petty politics and be receptive to them. Contact also expertly intertwines the seemingly contradictory doctrines of science and faith, and in the end shows how having a little bit of both may be the answer to the human experience.What makes this film is the incredible performance of Jodie Foster and the emotionally resonant plot that humanizes her weaknesses as explainable personal tragedies early in her life. The culmination of the long and powerful story is one of the most beautiful and artistically vibrant scenes in any film I've ever seen. Truly, it's moved me to tears. I can count the number of films that have done this on one hand.I have NO IDEA why this film has received so little recognition, whether on top all-time Sci-Fi films or top movies in general. The great Carl Sagan's brilliant story is brought to life in a semi-realistic portrayal of what would happen if a message from an alien species was ever received in modern times.5 Stars.",5,"Quite possibly one of the most underrated, underappreciated and misjudged movies in the history of film.",1314662400,"08 30, 2011",2011,1748,"[""'ve"", 'viewed', 'film', 'countless', 'times', 'time', 'watch', 'movie', ""'m"", 'left', 'wondering', 'how', 'Contact', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'glossed', 'seemingly', 'forgotten', 'true', 'work', 'art', 'beautiful', 'inspiring', 'self-affirming', 'hope', 'filled', 'tale', 'one', 'woman', 'ambitious', 'spiritual', 'scientific', 'journey', 'monumental', 'discovery', 'alien', 'life', 'film', 'not', 'pander', 'blockbuster', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'super-explosion', 'loving', 'crowd', 'aliens', 'vs', 'humans', 'plotlines', 'seem', 'dominate', 'sci-fi', 'much', 'deeper', 'film', 'how', 'little', 'insignificant', 'infantile', 'are', 'species', 'how', 'may', 'be', 'millions', 'advanced', 'creatures', 'there', 'willing', 'ready', 'guide', 'evolution', 'species', 'only', 'can', 'find', 'way', 'troubling', 'petty', 'politics', 'be', 'receptive', 'Contact', 'also', 'expertly', 'seemingly', 'contradictory', 'doctrines', 'science', 'faith', 'end', 'how', 'having', 'little', 'bit', 'may', 'be', 'answer', 'human', 'film', 'incredible', 'performance', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'emotionally', 'resonant', 'plot', 'weaknesses', 'explainable', 'personal', 'tragedies', 'early', 'life', 'culmination', 'long', 'powerful', 'story', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'artistically', 'vibrant', 'scenes', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Truly', 'moved', 'tears', 'can', 'count', 'number', 'films', 'have', 'done', 'one', 'hand.I', 'have', 'NO', 'IDEA', 'why', 'film', 'received', 'so', 'little', 'recognition', 'top', 'all-time', 'Sci-Fi', 'films', 'top', 'movies', 'general', 'great', 'Carl', 'Sagan', 'brilliant', 'story', 'brought', 'life', 'semi-realistic', 'portrayal', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'message', 'alien', 'species', 'was', 'ever', 'received', 'modern', 'times.5', 'Stars']",Contact

Ellie (Jodi Foster) spends her whole career listening for sounds from space.  Along the way she meets Palmer (Matthew McConaughey), a man concerned with how scienctific discovery and technology affect human welfare and religion.  These two characters have very different religious viewpoints, and I feel like the differences were handled well.  The debate could have gone on endlessly, but that wasn't the point of the movie, and once it reached the fundamental divide between faith vs. proof they let it go.The movie was well-acted by all the characters.  Jodi Foster plays a very convincing obsessed scientist, and Matthew McConaughey is a thoughtful counterpoint.  Personally, I think the downfall to a lot of science fiction movies is that the characters are too attractive and the movie gets wrapped up in their romantic relationships.  Contact kept the science on mainstage with brief cameos from other topics, which was great!Contact brings the viewer in and forces you to think about really important issues and how you would react to the events that unfold.

Of course as a film it is designed to appeal to Americans - frankly the film was more entertaining than the book which included about five people visiting the alien world - more scientifically credible by all means.This film is a tremendous breakthrough in CG animation and the use of realistic news casts and video inserts to convey a sense that it really happened.  If it did happen, how would it unravel and the book is a masterly portrayal of how things could change.  The script also analyses the scientific method, Occam's Razor and the problems with truth and the bugbear of science and relgion - veering rightly in my view towards science against the dogmatic aspect of religion.How accurately the film foretold the tragedies of suicide bombers.  How lovingly it showed the whole of a dessert community madly celebrate the message from outer space, in so diverse a fashion and hyperbole as only Americans could.The best bits were views of our solar system and such extraordinary footage of young Ellie - rushing down a corridoor to open the medicine chest.The best film of 1997 and perhaps the 90s sadly underated and comparable to other Zemeckis treats like Forest Gump.Entertaining, educational and the depiction of a golden age for the US and Americans, the best in its civilisation which was set to change in the Post Clinton era.

Each of us, scientist, priest, spiritualist, agnostic, looks for answers that define our existance.  It is the quest, the journey, that each of us shares with one another.&quot;Contact is the story of Eleanor Ann Arroway (Ellie, for short) and her individual, life-long quest to seek answers to the questions &quot;Who are we? Why are we here?&quot;  She seeks answers as a radio-astronomer, heading up a division of S.E.T.I.

Her search, which spans many years of her adult, professional life, lead her to the discovery of a radio signal from Vega, a star roughly 4 light-years from Earth.What unfolds in this epic story, originally written by Carl Sagan, reaches far beyond the realm of an average science fiction film.  It is the story of a woman, whose faith in science leaves her with more questions then it answers.  It is the story of a man, torn between the love of a woman, and the faith of the religious covenant he has dedicated his life to.  It is the story of a government, at once skeptical and manipulative, attempting to dictate the actions of a discovery that really belongs to the world.  And, ultimately, it is the story of each of us; of anyone who has ever asked the big questions:  &quot;Who are we?

100998,A1DUIMS229CQR1,0790733226,scott welles,"[5, 7]","Occasionally in sci-fi movie magazines, you'll see articles like ""Top 10 Women In Science Fiction,"" and it's always the predictable fan-fave list of hot babes kicking the butts of vampires, zombies, robots, etc.  You never see Jodie Foster in ""Contact"" on such lists, and that's a shame.  Why?  Because that would involve an actual WOMAN (an intelligent, mature woman of integrity and subtance, as opposed to a kung-fu sex object on steroids) in an actual SCIENCE FICTION movie (an intelligent, thought-provoking premise, as opposed to yet another action movie in space).Robert Zemeckis made ""Contact"" as a follow-up to his record-breaking, critically acclaimed ""Forrest Gump,"" and the two make an oddly matched pair.  Both are epic stories centered around a single point-of-view character, one the simple man who takes us on a tour of our past, the other a complex woman who leads us into the future.  Foster's performance is easily the equal of Tom Hanks' Oscar-winning turn, but sadly this gem of a film didn't get quite the attention it should.  (Possibly because, like ""The Abyss,"" another classic, it was swallowed up in the midst of too many summer blockbusters.)""Contact"" follows in the footsteps (and the high quality) of both ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" treating its subject of alien intelligence with serious thought: the most plausible aliens ever put on film are the ones we can't quite see.  This leaves us free to use our imaginations -- which far exceed Hollywood's abilities in any event -- but also keeps the focus on the story's most truly important aspect, ourselves and our reactions to the prospect that we are not alone in the universe.Although the story may sound dry on paper -- there are no ray guns, bug-eyed monsters or flesh-eating mutants in this movie -- the pace is never dull, and there's plenty to keep audiences engrossed, including a large amount of sideshow silliness from the world media, some devious government politicking, a chillingly plausible subplot about religious extremists (with Jake Busey, a dead ringer for his dad Gary), and an exasperatingly funny convention of every UFO-loving nutjob in the western hemisphere.The cast is uniformly impressive, with charismatic actors like Angela Bassett, David Morse, Tom Skerritt, and the always enjoyable James Woods.  Stealing the show (and giving us the pleasure of having 2 ""Alien"" veterans in the cast) is John Hurt as a manipulative Howard-Hughes-ish recluse whose scenes are few but played with ""Silence of the Lambs"" intensity and power.  Personally, I'm not a big Matthew McConaughey fan, but he serves well as the pseudo-love-interest who quietly challenges the beliefs of Foster's character and makes her (and us) reexamine her deepest motives.Jodie Foster, however, carries the film's emotional center with aplomb, making herself both admirably resourceful and empathetically flawed in equal amounts.  Her emotionally wounded character is driven to delve into the heart of the universe through strictly scientific methods, yet resists any suggestion of religious faith, realizing only at the end that both are flipsides of the same coin.  Foster allows this conflict within herself to drive the story as much as the global events occurring around her.  (Note, incidentally, the recurring characteristic trait of curling into a protective fetal position while perched on the very edge of something -- a chair, a bed, a porch, a canyon -- and gazing upward and outward even while retreating inward.  Nice touch, Ms. Foster!)The plot is well-developed, with a particularly wicked double-twist ending, and there is some insightful social and philosophical commentary in this movie.  But, for sheer thrills, it also boasts the most exciting climactic sequence I saw that entire year, as Foster's character makes the last walk to embark on the journey to end all journeys.  And frankly, for the summer of '97, that's saying something!(P.S.: Can't let this review go by without a nod to author of the book, Carl Sagan.

Mathew McConaughey stars as the unconvincing religious scholar Palmer Jones. I found Contact to be slow at first. Once the alien contact was made I found the novel much more interesting. I really enjoyed the slow buildup and the introduction of each new clue to the alien entity.I was rather lukewarm about Palmer as a love interest. He seemed to lack conviction and faded in and out of Ellie's life with no apparent. reason. I also found the religious message to be rather heavy handed.  (Don't get me wrong, I don't mind religious characters, but I hate to be bludgeoned over the head with a message). The whole ""Woman Looks For Aliens and Finds her Faith Instead"" message I could really do without. Also, the meeting with the 'alien' was anticlimactic and  seemed more suited for an episode featuring the star trek holodeck than a big budget film.Overall, I felt Contact was a rather tepid film, that started out great, but failed to deliver the goods. (Oh, and Ellie's hair stylist needs to be fired. The whole hair extension thing looked cheap and really, really fake!) I give this film 3 stars for the excellent promise.

In order to fully understand the poverty of this film adaptation, one needs to know more than a little bit about Carl Sagan. Dr. Sagan was an astronomer with a well thought out and unwavering view of what NASA should be about. He lobbied for the terra-forming of Mars as early as 1972. Four 02 machines, and 25 years, would produce a noticeable atmosphere on the Red planet. Another quarter century would produce an environment still very hostile to humankind, but sophisticated ""space suits"" would enable the few colonists (Engineers, Scientists) working there, to prepare Mars for permanent inhabitants. Mars is rich in gympsum, and thus few tools would be needed to erect permanent structures from the strong yet malleable rock. By the year 2042 - a mere 75 years after the start date - Mars would be able to support human life fairly easily. No special gear or out-fitting would be needed. People could tolerate the atmosphere wearing nothing but ""street clothes"" for several hours a day. People would probably carry a small 02 unit to combat any shortness of breath. Mars would be Earth-like and able to support human life by 2070. Perhaps man will learn from our mistakes on Earth and not rape the planet, or make war.Carl Sagan was also a politician. Genuine and enthusiastic, but not very effective. The scientific community tapped him to argue Evolution vs. Creationism with a team of debaters who trained in San Diego at the Creationism Institute. These debaters rehearsed with an IF-THEN approach to counter anything Sagan said. Sagan tried to bridge the gap between science and religion in a manner respectful to all points of view. He had underestimated the religous zealots, and thus, walked away from these public debates having appeared to be weak, ill-prepared, slow, confusing, and unconvincing. He made the same errors when testifying in front of Congress for additional funds for space exploration. His battles with NASA were highly publicized, and NASA looked as weak as him. He had a love/hate relationship with NASA in that he disagreed with their plans, but understood tha NASA was the only game in town. He died a slow agonizing death shortly before the film came out, and gave it a very tacid thumbs up. For all his love, all his work, he passed having realized none of his funding attempts and was ultimately one of the saddist people of the 20th c.THE FILM: Ellie Arroway (""Sparks"") brought to life by Jodie Foster, never met her mother as she had died at Ellie's birth. Her father died when she was 9. Ellie raced through High School, College, and Graduate school, and turned down Fellowship after Fellowship to devote her life to SETI. There is a lot of poetry here: Ellie's mother dying from childbirth is visualized by the tunnel-like Black Holes she travels through during her personal space odyssey. Her fathers caution that she'll need to take small steps to realize her frontier. And small steps she took during her quest.Ellie and her Research Assistants - one of whom is blind and thus able to hear nuances sighted people may miss - eventually receive radio signals that are sophistcated and repetitive. Not products of randomness. She had resorted to begging Billionaires for funds to continue her effort, and now it was paying off. They had made Contact. A message millions of pages long comes to NASA's computers in the form of unfinished diagrams, symbols of apparent mathematics, and endless blogs of HTML-like instructions. Nothing seems to fit together. A reclusive Billionarre tells Ellie to ""think like a Vegan."" She puts the pages together in a three dimensional format and finds the primer that enables her and the other scientists to read a message, get instructions, from another world.Palmer Joss: this unnecessary token religous character seems to have been inserted itno the film only to provide gratuitous nudity. Played by handsome Matthew Mc Coughnehy, this man of the cloth character serves only to interrupt the seamlessness of the film while spouting profound revelations, and presenting Ellie with a dichotomous love interest. This character sucks.After Congressional inquests during which Ellie is villified for being atheist; after a horrific act of terror by a religous zealot that kills the character nicely played by Tom Skerrit, Ellie becomes the traveler. Propelled through the universe by entering the fore-mentioned tunnels, Ellie meets a person who appears to be her father. The alien admits he has taken the appearence and persona of her father to make it easier on her.""Small steps Sparks. Small steps."" ""This is how its been done for billions of years"". Ellie returns with a story no one believes. A very lo-tech device aboard the capsule confirms her story, but remains a secret.

Contact is a prime example of how to make a good drama in a setting of science and exploration. It's as true an adaptation to Carl Sagan's novel as you can get considering what you have to do to make the events of the book fit into a feature film. They certainly don't skimp on the special effects either. The opening scene alone is beautiful in it's expansiveness. 'The Machine' hey build to do the space exploration thing is awesome to behold. They do a great job portraying the massive scale of it.What really makes Contact a good drama is... well... the drama. You have Dr. Arroway (Jodie Foster) dealing with conflict from several fronts in not only the persecution of her profession, but also her own issues with religion and relationships. If you read between the lines you see reasons why she seems to be in denial about God and her relationship with Palmer (Matthew McConaughey). Add a boss stealing her credit, government spooks scrutinizing her, and a life long ambition so close she can taste it and you have a veritable melting pot of reasons for a breakdown. If you take out the alien transmissions and space transports you would still have a good drama.Contact takes a whole different approach in space exploration and alien contact. Contact is not an action film. It's a movie that delves into not only exploration of outer space but also the exploration of human emotions and faith in the unknown. If you're into SETI you're going to love this film. The attention to detail and consistency are really nice. It's about as accurate as you can get to that kind of research.The DVD is not exactly feature-rich. However back when it was made it was considered pretty nice. You get background information on the actors as well as a fair amount of technical notes on the production of the movie as well as the movie's evolution from book to film. There is also a really nice commentary track by the director and producer that is very informative without being boring or distracting. There is a commentary track by Jodie Foster, but I haven't listened to it yet.Contact might not be for everyone.

SF - yes - but they make you believe it could happen exactly like this (and who knows - it  might...). One of the most interesting facets of this movie is the fact  that it has something that is rarely seen in Hollywood: a female heroine!  Jodie foster brilliantly portrais a woman who is strong, intelligent,  driven, courageous but also sensitive and emotional. Easily the strongest  female character since Sigourney Weaver in &quot;Alien&quot;. The DVD is a  showcase in itself: the 5.1 digital sound is clearly the best in over 100  DVDs I've seen, extremely dynamic (if you have a subwoofer: tie it to the  floor for the &quot;liftoff&quot; and journey parts of the movie or else it  will bounce all across your living room), there are wonderful directional  effects aplenty, the dialogues are crisp and easy to understand and the  score is a beauty, too. For me the highlight are the full-length  commentaries of Jodie Foster and director Zemeckis. They offer interesting  and often humorous first hand insight into the making of this great movie.  You learn a great deal about filmmaking (much more than through any  &quot;making-of&quot; featurette), share toughts, feelings, even doubts of  the people who brought this masterpiece to you and even learn about some  memorable human episodes that happened during the shoot.

The Mbps rate varies from the high teens to low thirties depending upon the action's needs.  Forget all that, how does it look?  This is one of the very best transfers of video I have seen.  Absolutely no artifacting, no motion blurs which would have been real easy to see for many of the scenes in this movie and no false colors either.  The colors created in post production are simply beautiful to look at and skin tones are spot on.  There were a couple of scenes where the contrast was so good, it was almost like watching it in 3D.  Contrast throughout the entire film is excellent and I do believe this transfer could and should be used as a DEMO worthy disc.  I do not have this film on Standard Def DVD so this review is not a comparison and I can not say whether or how much they did any remastering but the video is just gorgeous.AUDIO....The lossless PCM 5.1 audio shows how much audio editors can do when they put their minds to it.  There is a full usage of both the front and rear stages as well as many scenes of discreet channeling between the rears and front as well as pans of audio all around.  The very first scene will wake up your audio system and let it know it has some work to do.  The LFE channel is not called upon as often but it gets its own workout in many scenes. The dialogue is clean and very transient and transparent.  Audio levels are set properly so you will not have to roller coaster your remote's volume control.  If you know your chapters with this film, the audio is also, totally demo worthy.Extras consisted of making of documentaries cut to individual chapters mostly focusing upon how they created the various composite scenes in the film for special fx.  Also included were two trailers and 3 different commentaries( a touch of overkill IMHO)  Also included was a music only audio track.I bought this film on a lark, hadn't seen it in years but now am very glad I did.All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.Thanks for reading.",5,Contact on Blu Ray,1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,2535,"['everyone', 'else', 'already', 'provided', 'summaries', 'storyline', 'opinions', 'acting', 'everything', 'else', 'will', 'always', 'do', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'film', 'Blu', 'Ray.VIDEO', '.It', 'just', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'highest', 'Mbps', 'rate', 'create', 'good', 'transfer', 'video', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Mbps', 'rate', 'varies', 'high', 'teens', 'low', 'thirties', 'depending', 'action', 'needs', 'Forget', 'how', 'look', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'transfers', 'video', 'have', 'seen', 'Absolutely', 'artifacting', 'motion', 'blurs', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'easy', 'see', 'many', 'scenes', 'movie', 'false', 'colors', 'either', 'colors', 'created', 'post', 'production', 'are', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'look', 'skin', 'tones', 'are', 'spot', 'were', 'couple', 'scenes', 'where', 'contrast', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'almost', 'watching', '3D', 'Contrast', 'entire', 'film', 'excellent', 'do', 'believe', 'transfer', 'could', 'should', 'be', 'used', 'DEMO', 'worthy', 'disc', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'film', 'Standard', 'Def', 'DVD', 'review', 'not', 'comparison', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'how', 'much', 'did', 'remastering', 'video', 'just', 'gorgeous.AUDIO', '.The', 'lossless', 'PCM', '5.1', 'audio', 'how', 'much', 'audio', 'editors', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'put', 'minds', 'full', 'usage', 'front', 'rear', 'stages', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'scenes', 'discreet', 'channeling', 'rears', 'front', 'as', 'well', 'pans', 'audio', 'around', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'will', 'wake', 'up', 'audio', 'system', 'let', 'know', 'work', 'do', 'LFE', 'channel', 'not', 'called', 'upon', 'often', 'own', 'workout', 'many', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'clean', 'very', 'transient', 'transparent', 'Audio', 'levels', 'are', 'set', 'properly', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'roller', 'coaster', 'remote', 'volume', 'control', 'know', 'chapters', 'film', 'audio', 'also', 'totally', 'demo', 'worthy.Extras', 'consisted', 'making', 'documentaries', 'cut', 'individual', 'chapters', 'mostly', 'focusing', 'how', 'created', 'various', 'composite', 'scenes', 'film', 'special', 'fx', 'Also', 'included', 'were', 'two', 'trailers', '3', 'different', 'commentaries', 'touch', 'overkill', 'IMHO', 'Also', 'included', 'was', 'music', 'only', 'audio', 'track.I', 'bought', 'film', 'lark', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'years', 'now', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'did.All', 'reviews', 'focus', 'solely', 'quality', 'transfers', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'video', 'audio', 'do', 'hope', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'deciding', 'purchase', 'decisions', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'type', 'review.Thanks', 'reading']",Contact

It would be rather preposterous to presume that we're the only living thing existed in the whole universe.  As it is so well put in the movie that 'It would be such a waste, wouldn't it?'  This is why I am so fond of Jodie Foster's character in the movie; from a very young age, she is fascinated with the idea of receiving messages from intelligent living thing from outer space.  She has the support from her father but; unfortunately, he died when she is still very young. However, her interest remains unchanged and goes on to pursue her ambition and graduated with a doctorate in her desired field.  She has to go through adverse situations before she got her financial support from a prominent industrialist played by John Hurt.  She finally succeeded in receiving messages from a faraway place.  The messages she received is to build a machine but it is in code that no one can decipher.  Just as the hope of deciphering the blueprint is in vain, the industrialist summons her to his private plane and conveys the decoded chart to her.You can imagine the discovery of this magnitude when made known to the world, what kind of commotion it would create.  From this climatic moment on there is no dull moment. You see the ambitious contest and opportunistic seizure by some scientist to gain recognition and the right to ride in the spacecraft, the wacky religious cultist and his bent on destruction, and all kinds of outlandish demonstrations of human irrational reactions.  In the end Jodie Foster gets to ride the spacecraft.I don't want to spoil the fun of watching the movie yourselves, therefore, I'll leave it right here.  I guess I'm not the only one who got a kick out of the line 'Wanna take a ride' spoken by John Hurt in the movie.

In most movies with aliens, the aliens are either nice or evil but there is always the usual way the aliens meet us or us them. In this movie, Segan uses a different approach. We get some real science tossed in. Cosmos fans will undoubtedly recognize some of Sagan's lessons scattered here and there.

101021,A3NQSMTG612AF,0790733226,TheTruthHurts,"[9, 10]","Warning, this review contains spoilers...if you haven't yet watched it, don't continue on, but simply hear this; it is a masterpiece!  Forget renting it, find yourself a copy to own.This movie, at least as far as I am concerned, is Robert Zemeckis' best, even better than Back to the Future and Forrest Gump.  Let me begin by stating that if your IQ is lower than 100 (or 120 for that matter), you probably won't enjoy it.  Why?  There are indeed no ""aliens"" or ""monsters"" that jump out of the shadows, nor are there big men with big guns that blow them up and cheer ""go back to your home planet, you scum...America rules!!!""  This isn't Star Trek, nor is it your typical cornball ""sci-fi"" flick.  If it were, I wouldn't be reviewing it, because I wouldn't have seen it.  What this movie is is an amazing rendition of one of Carl Sagan's most enthralling and intelligent novels, and it is indeed a fine example of just how good a film based on a work of fiction can be.  What this piece is is a work of art; rather than stimulate our animalistic urges to see ""little green men"" pop out at us with ""plasma rifles,"" like most everything else that's come out of Hollywood since its inception, the ending of the film leaves it up to our imaginations, essentially, to decipher precisely what happened to Ellie (Dr. Elanaor Arroway, the protagonist) during her journey to the galaxy in which the star Vega is contained.  The beginning of this film alone, in which a three-plus minute digression from our planet through seemingly trillions of miles of the universe takes place, was enough to hook me.  This film is about not only the endless debate between religion and science, of which Ellie is a firm believer in the latter, but it is about her transformation, more or less, in the end of the film to someone just a little less skeptical...what Zemeckis (and obviously Sagan) was indeed trying to portray in the ending of this film is that there is reason to have ""faith"" in the future, even in these desolate times, and to show us that there just might be more than meets the eye to our existence...and that there may be more than we know, and/or are capable of knowing, to ourselves, our race, and each other and what each of us believes, especially in the face of having no tangible ""proof""...and finally that we are indeed never as ""alone"" as we all feel at one time or another.  A truly unique and masterful film, consistently underrated and panned by critics, most often for its inclusion of a certain ex-president in a couple video clips...give me a break.  Does that really detract from the quality and purpose of the film?  I think not, and to give the film lower marks for it is ludicrous, in my opinion.I am not a religious individual, and am in fact an agnostic.  I could easily envision overtly religious people loathing Jodie's character beginning with the scene of the death of her father, as she hastily denies the support of the religious figure(s) at her father's wake.  However, like I said earlier, the film is by no means out to deny the existence of God or debunk any religion, nor does it attempt to verify these concepts.  It is merely contrasting the two sides of the argument and makes valid points in favor of each.  So, my main point is that this film is so much more than a ""sci-fi"" film (to say that this film doesn't compare to Star Wars or Star Trek is quite absurd; they aren't even honestly in the same genre in the first place, and this film transcends any of that...stuff).  Just give it a chance, and if you disagree, so be it...but I know that it moved me like no other film had in quite some time, and I'm a better person for having seen it, and it remains one of my all-time favorite films, even eight years after its release.

101022,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,0790733226,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[6, 9]","Director:  Robert ZemeckisCast:  Jodie Foster, Matthew McConaughey, Tom Skerritt, James Woods, Angela Bassett, John Hurt, David Morse, William Fichtner, Geoffrey Blake, Sami Chester, Timothy McNeil.Running Time:  153 minutesRated PG for some intense action, mild language and a scene of sensuality.All of the greatest work by the greatest scientists has been done while they were very young, when they were stupid enough to believe that two-plus-two-equals-five, and pursued it instead of listening to all of those who were much older and wiser who said Don't Waste Your Time. Einstein, it has been said, asked all of his important questions before the age of twenty-five, then spent the rest of his life working on them. ""Contact"", directed by Robert Zemeckis (""Forrest Gump"", ""Back to the Future""), is the story of a young scientist, Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster), who like Einstein and all the greats before her, has been asking questions and seeking answers since she was very young. And now, as a member of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) team, she is able to pursue her obsession with the mysteries of the galaxies and the infinite universe that surrounds us. Her job is to sweep the skies, using the most sophisticated equipment available, for a signal from deepest space. It may be her job, but for Ellie it's a labor of love, for she is convinced that there is something, or someone, out there somewhere, because otherwise, she reasons, what a terrible waste of space it would be. Ellie may be a dreamer, but she knows in her heart that it is the dreamers who over the years have been responsible for making us evolve, making us learn and grow because they are the ones who take insane, foolish ideas and pursue them. And to her, two-plus-two will always be five.Ellie loves her job and believes in what she is doing, but it's been a struggle over the years, as she and others have had to constantly fight for the funding necessary to keep the project alive, begging for dollars from short-sighted, unimaginative people with vision that goes only as far as the bottom line of their budget book. It's been a tough row to hoe, and she's had to swallow a lot of pride over the years, but then one day it all pays off, when in one magic moment she hears what she's been waiting for all her life: A signal from a distant end of the galaxy-- someone attempting to communicate, to make contact, with the people of the Earth.  Ellie and her team soon realize that, whomever it is, they are using the universal language of prime numbers in their attempts at making contact; and when Ellie deciphers the code, she discovers something monumental in the bargain. But it's a message of global importance, something much bigger than she and her team alone, and she soon find herself fighting to remain a part of the drama that is only beginning to unfold-- the first interaction between human beings and an alien life form. And it's only the beginning of the adventure and the wondrous places this film is about to take you.Jodie Foster gives a performance here that demonstrates what a gifted, talented actor she is. Her Ellie is convincing and believable, and someone to whom you can genuinely relate, no matter who you are or where you're from, because there is something universal in Ellie's passion and longing to discover the truth and to see beyond the veil of our limited mortal capacities. There's a strength to Ellie, born of a combination of intelligence and innocence, as well as tenacity and faith, and Foster manifests all of these complexities of her character beautifully, with a performance that should've landed her an Oscar nomination. In this role, she is simply as good as it gets.  The supporting cast includes David Morse (Ted Arroway), Matthew McConaughey (Palmer), Geoffrey Blake (Fisher), William Fichtner (Kent), Tom Skerritt (David), James Woods (Kitz) and Angela Bassett (Rachel). Zemeckis did a brilliant job of bringing this film to fruition, especially in the way he allowed Foster the time to really develop her character, by giving her that extra moment at just the right time that ultimately meant so much in the final analysis. Too often it's those few minutes that wind up on the cutting room floor that make the difference between a good film and an exceptional one; and between Zemeckis and Foster, they took it to the edge by taking some chances to realize that combined vision, which in the end made this a great film. Thoroughly engrossing and entertaining, `Contact' will transport you to places you can only imagine, and it's all done with style and in a way that makes this a truly memorable cinematic journey. It's what the magic of the movies is all about.",5,Contact  (1997),1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,4717,"['Director', 'Robert', 'ZemeckisCast', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'James', 'Woods', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'John', 'Hurt', 'David', 'Morse', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'Geoffrey', 'Blake', 'Sami', 'Chester', 'Timothy', 'McNeil.Running', 'Time', '153', 'minutesRated', 'PG', 'intense', 'action', 'mild', 'language', 'scene', 'sensuality.All', 'greatest', 'work', 'greatest', 'scientists', 'been', 'done', 'were', 'very', 'young', 'when', 'were', 'stupid', 'enough', 'believe', 'two-plus-two-equals-five', 'pursued', 'instead', 'listening', 'who', 'were', 'much', 'older', 'wiser', 'who', 'said', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Waste', 'Your', 'Time', 'Einstein', 'been', 'said', 'asked', 'important', 'questions', 'age', 'twenty-five', 'then', 'spent', 'rest', 'life', 'working', 'Contact', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Back', 'Future', 'story', 'young', 'scientist', 'Ellie', 'Arroway', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'who', 'Einstein', 'greats', 'been', 'asking', 'questions', 'seeking', 'answers', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'now', 'member', 'SETI', 'Search', 'Extraterrestrial', 'Intelligence', 'team', 'able', 'pursue', 'obsession', 'mysteries', 'galaxies', 'infinite', 'universe', 'job', 'sweep', 'skies', 'using', 'most', 'sophisticated', 'equipment', 'available', 'signal', 'deepest', 'space', 'may', 'be', 'job', 'Ellie', 'labor', 'love', 'convinced', 'something', 'someone', 'there', 'somewhere', 'otherwise', 'reasons', 'what', 'terrible', 'waste', 'space', 'would', 'be', 'Ellie', 'may', 'be', 'dreamer', 'heart', 'dreamers', 'who', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'responsible', 'making', 'evolve', 'making', 'learn', 'grow', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'take', 'insane', 'foolish', 'ideas', 'pursue', 'two-plus-two', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'five.Ellie', 'job', 'what', 'doing', 'been', 'struggle', 'years', 'others', 'have', 'had', 'constantly', 'fight', 'funding', 'necessary', 'keep', 'project', 'alive', 'begging', 'dollars', 'short-sighted', 'unimaginative', 'people', 'vision', 'only', 'as', 'far', 'bottom', 'line', 'budget', 'book', 'been', 'tough', 'row', 'hoe', 'had', 'swallow', 'lot', 'pride', 'years', 'then', 'one', 'day', 'off', 'when', 'one', 'magic', 'moment', 'what', 'been', 'waiting', 'life', 'signal', 'distant', 'end', 'galaxy', 'someone', 'attempting', 'communicate', 'make', 'contact', 'people', 'Earth', 'Ellie', 'team', 'soon', 'realize', 'whomever', 'are', 'using', 'universal', 'language', 'prime', 'numbers', 'attempts', 'making', 'contact', 'when', 'Ellie', 'code', 'something', 'monumental', 'bargain', 'message', 'global', 'importance', 'something', 'much', 'bigger', 'team', 'alone', 'soon', 'find', 'fighting', 'remain', 'part', 'drama', 'only', 'beginning', 'unfold', 'first', 'interaction', 'human', 'beings', 'alien', 'life', 'form', 'only', 'beginning', 'adventure', 'wondrous', 'places', 'film', 'take', 'you.Jodie', 'Foster', 'performance', 'here', 'what', 'gifted', 'talented', 'actor', 'Ellie', 'convincing', 'believable', 'someone', 'whom', 'can', 'genuinely', 'relate', 'matter', 'who', 'are', 'where', ""'re"", 'something', 'universal', 'Ellie', 'passion', 'longing', 'discover', 'truth', 'see', 'veil', 'limited', 'mortal', 'capacities', 'strength', 'Ellie', 'born', 'combination', 'intelligence', 'innocence', 'as', 'well', 'tenacity', 'faith', 'Foster', 'complexities', 'character', 'beautifully', 'performance', 'should', ""'ve"", 'landed', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'role', 'simply', 'as', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'David', 'Morse', 'Ted', 'Arroway', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Palmer', 'Geoffrey', 'Blake', 'Fisher', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'Kent', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'David', 'James', 'Woods', 'Kitz', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Rachel', 'Zemeckis', 'did', 'brilliant', 'job', 'bringing', 'film', 'fruition', 'especially', 'way', 'allowed', 'Foster', 'time', 'really', 'develop', 'character', 'giving', 'extra', 'moment', 'just', 'right', 'time', 'ultimately', 'meant', 'so', 'much', 'final', 'analysis', 'Too', 'often', 'few', 'minutes', 'wind', 'up', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'make', 'difference', 'good', 'film', 'exceptional', 'one', 'Zemeckis', 'Foster', 'took', 'edge', 'taking', 'chances', 'realize', 'combined', 'vision', 'end', 'made', 'great', 'film', 'Thoroughly', 'engrossing', 'entertaining', 'Contact', 'will', 'transport', 'places', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'done', 'style', 'way', 'truly', 'memorable', 'cinematic', 'journey', 'what', 'magic', 'movies']",Contact

101025,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,0790733226,Thomas Glebe,"[5, 10]","""Contact"" is the filmed version of Carl Sagan's novel of the same name, and was completed after his early death.  I can imagine Carl having as mixed feelings about this movie as I do, but overall, I think he would've been generally pleased.  However, there are so many things, so many details, and extrapolations in this filmed version which were dealt with so much more satisfying and explanatory in the novel, that I wonder.Generally, ""wonder"" and a sense of ""awe"" at the scope and size and meaning of the universe, and whether or not we are ""all alone"" (as far as technological, advanced, intelligent OTHER civilizations in the cosmos are concerned), or not, is at the heart of this movie.  And considering Hollywood's reluctance to tackle such weighty cosmic matters, overall, this film has to be considered a moderate success.Unfortunately, crucial elements from the novel are simply ignored here or are given lip service at best, and the result is a film which is compelling and eye-candy in some parts, but in the end especially, lacks any solid ground and is overlong and in too many sections, insufficiently explained for the layman/average viewer.  Also, while the beginning of the film is one of the coolest major motion picture beginnings of all time, the payoff and end leave something to be desired.Technically, the film is almost perfect, with great pace, acting, and a mostly intelligent screenplay.  The opening sequence, in which we travel from our own little noisy corner of the universe, zooming out towards our real, rather insignificant and silent place in the greater scheme of things, is amazing.  It's just too bad that the whole film couldn't have kept up that quality.  And the end, in various ways, seems to contradict and/or diminish the same.Having read the novel long ago, I remembered an ending even more cosmic and mind-blowing than that which is exhibited here.  Perhaps, in retrospect, the ending of Sagan's novel, in which the whole question of ""religion"" and ""God"" and the ""cosmos"" is given as compelling an ending as the film's beginning, couldn't really have been ""filmed.""  Perhaps during the production, it was decided that the end of Sagan's novel, really couldn't be visualized with film, so while the movie as a whole is generally satisfying, the end is very disappointing.""Religion"" and humankind's views of such and how they may or may not explain our being and place in the cosmos, play a significant part here, but a more undefined ""belief in a God"" is confused with ""terrestrial"" religious tenets and symbols here.  And the whole government/taxpayer supported SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) ""scientific"" project and ""mission"" is eventually revealed to be nothing much more than just another ""religious"" idea, explored with science and technology and MONEY, instead of meaningless ancient voodoo and superstition.This leads to a confusion between ""faith"" and ""evidence"" which the movie never really addresses.  In a crucial scene, the question is asked, ""You loved your father?  Prove it.""  I'm sure Sagan could've and did (in the book) explain this, but in the film, this is left unanswered unnnecessarily.  As are so many questions and answers, up until the end.Many parts of the film and premise, are just too simple-minded and too much a set-up for easy answers later on, when it all could have been so much more.  And yet, a lot of this I'm sure, will fly light years above most people's heads.  Still, as one who has studied both UFO/ET/Abduction evidence along with that of the continuing mission of SETI, I'd have to call it a draw so far.In the end, the film comes nowhere near the truly mind-expanding conclusions and questions of the novel, but again, perhaps, this was just too much to be put in a Hollywood movie, and may even have been impossible to visualize with mere cinema.  The main problem here is that a very patronizing ending is tacked on where something more in keeping with the general spirit of the novel's original ending, would've been so much better.We are told, in the end, that the traveler's journey and contact with real ET, can somehow be proved beyond faith, with science and human measurement instruments, but besides the temporal moments the traveler spent light years away, the only proof of such, could lay in a 1000 different explanations, including the first one that came to mind.  The traveler could've dreamed it all up, in a split second.  While observers (and human science) recorded it as something more.This is an overall entertaining and intelligent movie, with some great special effects and wonderful music, but its basic premise, that of SETI itself, is flawed in my view, and is never fully and satisfyingly addressed within.  In the beginning, the young girl is told by her father, when asked if there was anyone else out there, ""if not, it would be an awful waste of space.""  Sadly, the end of the movie, refinforces this general idea, but it is as much a ""religious"" idea as is anything the movie preaches against.Space and our universe is big, really, really big.  But size and numbers of planets do not posit some sort of religious idea that life, let alone intelligent life, is somehow ""common"" in the cosmos.  And really, if there were such advanced civilizations, I think a more likely explanation would be that they've already been here for eons, and that primitive ""radio"" signals we might someday receive from them, would've been discovered long ago.  Long before the ""UFO"" phenomenon, long before our technologies, and perhaps beyond the reach and imagination of SETI scientists and researchers, who after all, depend upon money and peer status, for everything they pursue and have the courage to pursue.I would've loved to have read Carl Sagan's review of this film, because in his dying days, a lot of what he seemed to think and say, he seemed to refute, and was strangely contradictory to this pretty but too much shallow rendering of his great novel.",3,"Good film, could've been great...",1172361600,"02 25, 2007",2007,5985,"['Contact',

101032,A4JHEO7H330AF,0790733226,Tom Brody,"[1, 1]","CONTACT stars Jodie Foster as an MIT-trained physicist, Matthew McConaughey as a self-trained ""man of the cloth"" and Jodie's love interest, and Tom Skerritt as the manager of a large-scale astrophysics project.  Smaller parts include Jake Busey as the religeious fanatic who blows up the astrophysics project.  James Woods plays a government official who is skeptical about the results provided by the astrophysics project, but (spoiler alert) who eventually changes his mind.  Angela Bassett plays White House Chief of Staff to President Clinton, who provides routine assistance to Jodie Foster.SUMMARY.  The film starts out with Jodie as a girl.  Her father trains her to monitor signals from space, using amateur electronics equipment.  One day, the father has a heart attack and croaks, leaving Jodie without a dad.  Eventually (fast forward), Jodie is a student at MIT acquiring a Ph.D. in astrophysics.  Years later, she tries to get funding to rent time on a radiotelescope in the desert to monitor signals from outer space.  Eventually, she is granted an audience with a funding agency, but she blows up in anger, because they are not sympathetic to her goals.  But an ""angel"" (angel is the technical term for a venture capitalist who funds projects on his own) steps in and funds her project.  With her project funded, Jodie continues to monitor signals from the radiotelescope in the desert.  John Hurt is one of her co-workers.  Eventually, the team discovers some strange signals that sound like washing machine sounds.  With the aid of computer processing (warning, another spoiler alert), the team discovers that the signals are really plans for building a huge machine.  The machine is an astrophysics gadget that enables the traveler to journey through a wormhole to meet her dead father.  The machine is built at Cape Canaveral.  Tom Skerritt, wanting to steal all of the credit from Jodie Foster, decides that he will be the first to use the machine.  But Jake Busey sneaks inside the facility, disguising himself as a technician, and blows up the whole thing, killing Tom Skerritt. Fortunately, (warning, another spoiler alert), a duplicate machine had been built on a remote island off of the coast of Japan.  Jodie Foster is allowed to take the journey in the machine in Japan.  She travels through space, journeys through a wormhole, and visits with her father on a beach.  When she returns, she is not able to convince anybody of what had happened, because the available evidence suggests that nothing had happened.  However, at the last minute in the movie, data demonstrated that what earthlings had perceived to take place in less than a second, actually represented a few hours of time for Jodie Foster.  The film ends with the the tantalizing realization that what Jodie had experienced had actually come to pass.GREAT LINES.  The screenplay is noted for some great lines.  For example, when Jodie was a girl, her father told her that it would be a waste of space if there was no life out there in the stars.  Years later, during her love affair with Matthew McConaughey, Matthew spontaneously comes up with the same concept, and says the same thing (""it seems like an aweful waste of space"") that her father had said years earlier.  This greatly increases the affinity that Jodie has for Matthew, as one might expect, given Jodie's love for her deceased father.At one point, Jodie is grilled by a large committee, where the issue is whether she should be allowed to journey in the machine.  Three people grill Jodie on the question, ""Do you believe in God?""  This was meant to be a provocative question, and to brand Jodie as an atheist and therefore not adequate to be the first passenger on the space gadget.  Jodie replies, ""I don't believe that there is data either way,"" referring to whether God exists or doesn't exist.  When pressed further on this point, Jodie replies, ""I believe, um, I believe that I've already answered that question.""  A similar dialogue occurs in GULLIVER'S TRAVELS with Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen, where Mary is asked if she believes the wild stories told by Ted Danson, who plays Gulliver.  Mary refrains from answering that she belives him, but instead answers, ""I belive in him.""At an early point in the movie, Matthew opens up a box of Cracker Jack, and inside is a toy compass, and he gives this to Jodie as a momento.  This particular toy is kept by Jodie, through thick and thin, and it serves as a humble icon that is kept, just as Jodie keeps alive her affection for Matthew.  A toy compass in a Cracker Jack box also makes its appearance in the movie 1941, where actor Slim Pickens quickly swallows the compass so that the Japanese submariners will not be able to use it to find their way.  The common item (Cracker Jack compass) but totally different uses for this item, makes one of the more remarkable footnotes in the history of American cinema.Another amazing part of the script, is where Jodie Foster takes Angela Bassett aside, in order to ask an important question.  But as it turns out, Jodie's question is, ""Where can I get a really great dress?""CONCLUSION.  I liked every moment of this film.  There were no ""dead sequences"" in the middle, meant to use up time.  The film was full of twists and surprises.  The film ends with a few ambiguities, though these ambiguities were intentional.  More than most films, this movie calls for a sequel.",5,Great for repeated viewings.

Can you watch a movie more than once and still get something out of it? Can you read a book more than once and get something from it?""Contact"", the movie, seems to meet the criteria for replay value, at least for me. I have seen it possibly a dozen times, and I have enjoyed it every time.There are criticisms that it isn't like the book by Carl Sagan. The same can be said of many movies. I haven't read the book yet, so I cannot address this.What I can address is why I find this movie consistently entertaining and would recommend it.Acting:The actors are all pretty convincing and do a memorable job.Jodi Foster carries the film as Ellie Arroway with believability and a great humanity. In the scene where she is about to launch in the ""machine"", she shows a considerable amount of nervousness and even fear. Given the character's situation, I'd say, YES! I'd be scared out of my mind! It wouldn't stop me, but I'd still be scared. She also shows vulnerability as her character gets tossed over by political rivals, especially the Tom Skerritt character.Tom Skerritt delivers a fine performance as the smarmy intellectual uber scientist David Drumlin who seems to have made it is personal quest to defeat Jodi Foster's character at every turn. He is so unlikeable, just short of being a villain.Matthew McConaughey plays Palmer Joss with excellent patience and sensitivity. His sexual interest in Arroway is obvious from the start, and when she basically abandons him early in the film, he doesn't really hold it against her. It does come as a surprise when during the selection hearings for who is to go visit the aliens, he sidewinds her. Fortunately, the script is sympathetic enough to have him explain his real motivations were selfish, he wants her to stay around as his love interest, even though she is often not there for him.John Hurt as S.R. Hadden is a delight. He's confident and a real ""angel"" in the financial sense. He supports Ellie brilliantly throughout the film, and he has a cynicism that is fun to watch.The other actors ( and there are many!) are also very good and deliver fine and believable performances.The film is worth a look just for their acting craft.Another plus in the movie is the musical score by Alan Silvestri. He really knows how to make the most of the simplest melodies, and his score is understated, gentle and just wonderful to hear.Finally, the sets and graphics are very good to excellent. The design of the 'machine' is suitably pseudo scientific and looks serious enough, and the outer space scenes are top notch. In this movie, getting there really is half the fun!For all these reasons, the film is very entertaining.Now, as to the ""message"".Yes, the movie does try to pit science against religion, or vice versa. It's an argument that is getting so old it is almost cliche. No one seems to ever try the middle of the road where the two can work together, religion reveals mystery, science attempts to explain mystery.And it is because of the all black/white polarization that some of the plot and dialog miss the boat for me.I like the line where Palmer asks Ellie, ""Did you love your father, prove it."" It is a valid argument because love is something that pure scientific inquiry cannot yet prove or measure or replicate. It is a mystery. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist.There is a point in the film where during the selection process, they ask Ellie if she believes in God. Of course, she has to hem and haw and finally say she cannot prove God. So, of course, she is disqualified because ""95% of the population of the Earth do believe in God"".If the film wasn't trying to make such an antagonistic argument between science and religion, it could have had Ellie respond in the most logical way. She could have responded: ""I personally do not because I cannot find proof to my satisfaction. However, as a representative of the people of Earth, I would tell the aliens that 95% of humanity does believe in a God. And as a scientist, I would ask them, what they believe."" The script doesn't allow this common sense response, and it was a bit disappointing.The faith vs. evidence argument is played out again after Ellie has returned from her journey and cannot prove that she has been anywhere. The film only leaves us with a question about 18 hours of static on the video recording device. However, what happened to the science here?If it seems like Ellie didn't go anywhere, and the 'machine' is still working just fine, why not send her or someone else on another trip? In other words, do what scientists are supposed to do, replicate the experiment. How they missed this is beyond me. It seemed so obvious!Conclusion:In spite of the muddy message of the movie, it is very well produced, well acted, has great sets and shows considerable restraint for a scifi movie. It is not an 'action thriller', it is thought provoking. It has great music and is an overall enjoyable experience.

In essence ""Contact"" acts as both a literal title and a pun--the film is about contact between science and faith, between a woman who loses her family at a young age trying to reconnect in some little way with what's she lost and her unending faith that she will discover there IS life out there.Working with authors Carl Sagan and Anne Druyan director Robert Zemeckis has refashioned the tale adding the character of David Drumlin (Tom Skerrit)as an adversary who dogs Ellie every step of the way pushing her further and further away from her opportunity to embrace her discovery. Featuring a terrific supporting cast ""Contact"" focuses more on the humanity rather than the hardware but deals with a number of complex themes in the process. Rather than focusing on a team that goes to meet the Vegans Zemeckis and screenwriters James V. Hart & Michael Goldberg elect to make one person go throwing the finale into question--again, it comes down to a matter of faith and Ellie believes.The Blu-ray has all of the original extras that were on the 1997 DVD. While the transfer looks extremely good with nice detail, color and clarity. It appears to be digitally scrubbed though with a bit too much digital noise reduction used reducing the level of the detail in the process. Nevertheless, it does blow away the original DVD by leaps and bounds particularly the opening sequence as we look at the Earth following the radio waves as they leave our planet moving further and further away from our solar system.""Contact"" is a very good if flawed film. The faith vs. science themes that were so prevelent in Sagan's book are still here but presented in a bit of a muddled fashion. There's zero chemistry on screen between Foster and McConaughey. David Morse brings a strong, quiet presence to his role as Ellie's father. The ending although it is touching and does provide a sense of closure (and while it does make sense in many respects) may feel like a cheat to some. I thought it worked quite well within the context of the film. Some of the story elements like the subplot involving a terrorist attack on the ""Machine"" and NASA are deftly handled--they could have been blown up (pardon the pun)into soap opera spectacle but Zemeckis plays it low-key. The other flaw is the time compression from discovery to execution; while it was essential to keeping the film moving forward it also makes everything seem as it it happens rather quickly.Over all this is a exceptionally good looking Blu-ray and the fact that Warner has ported over all the DVD extras (something that many studios have chosen not to do)is a big plus as well.

101048,A3VOW473J03GOB,0790733226,"Wayne ""waynesworld857""","[2, 2]","Adapted with the help of famous astronomer Carl Sagan from his book of the same title, CONTACT brilliantly brings to life the fictional story of astro-physicist Ellie Arroway (Foster) whose passion for the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence is matched only by her resoursefulness. She is instilled with a sense of wonder about the universe by her adoring father, a widower raising her alone until his untimely death when Ellie is only 9. She finds no comfort in the words of the minister who advises that she must accept his death as God's will. As an adult, she chooses to eschew religion and devotes her energies to the pursuit of science. When she meets and is attracted to Palmer Joss (McConaughey), a religious scholar, there is a clash over issues of faith.The plot revolves around  contact with an intelligent civilization many light years away that transmits blueprints for a machine of unknown purpose. But the strength of the story is the very well developed central character and Jody Foster's emotional portrayal of her (and Jena Malone does a wonderful job as the young Ellie). The story's lofty contemplations on faith vs. science and the implications for our planet of the discovery of extra-terrestrial intelligence lift this film above most other sci-fi. It also contains one of my favorite examples of imaginative cinematography. In a scene in which 9 yr. old Ellie discovers her father unconscious on the 1st floor, she races upstairs to get his medicine from the bathroom. In one continuous shot the camera tracks just ahead of and looking back at Ellie, from the 1st floor, up the stairs, turns down a hallway and into the bathroom. When she reaches for the medicine cabinet, you see that you have been looking into the reflection of the cabinet mirror the whole time. But of course, there is no way you could literally see Ellie's reflection in that mirror from the start of the shot, which began at the bottom of the stairs.",4,Intelligent Sci-Fi,1065398400,"10 6, 2003",2003,1954,"['Adapted', 'help', 'famous', 'astronomer', 'Carl', 'Sagan', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'CONTACT', 'brilliantly', 'life', 'fictional', 'story', 'astro-physicist', 'Ellie', 'Arroway', 'Foster', 'passion', 'search', 'extra-terrestrial', 'intelligence', 'matched', 'only', 'resoursefulness', 'instilled', 'sense', 'wonder', 'universe', 'adoring', 'father', 'widower', 'raising', 'alone', 'untimely', 'death', 'when', 'Ellie', 'only', '9', 'comfort', 'words', 'minister', 'who', 'must', 'accept', 'death', 'God', 'will', 'adult', 'eschew', 'religion', 'energies', 'pursuit', 'science', 'When', 'meets', 'attracted', 'Palmer', 'Joss', 'McConaughey', 'religious', 'scholar', 'clash', 'issues', 'faith.The', 'plot', 'around', 'contact', 'intelligent', 'civilization', 'many', 'light', 'years', 'away', 'blueprints', 'machine', 'unknown', 'purpose', 'strength', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'developed', 'central', 'character', 'Jody', 'Foster', 'emotional', 'portrayal', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'wonderful', 'job', 'young', 'Ellie', 'story', 'lofty', 'contemplations', 'faith', 'vs.', 'science', 'implications', 'planet', 'discovery', 'extra-terrestrial', 'intelligence', 'lift', 'film', 'most', 'other', 'sci-fi', 'also', 'one', 'favorite', 'examples', 'imaginative', 'cinematography', 'scene', '9', 'yr.', 'old', 'Ellie', 'father', 'unconscious', '1st', 'floor', 'upstairs', 'get', 'medicine', 'bathroom', 'one', 'continuous', 'shot', 'camera', 'just', 'ahead', 'looking', 'back', 'Ellie', '1st', 'floor', 'up', 'stairs', 'down', 'hallway', 'bathroom', 'When', 'medicine', 'cabinet', 'see', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'reflection', 'cabinet', 'mirror', 'whole', 'time', 'course', 'way', 'could', 'literally', 'see', 'Ellie', 'reflection', 'mirror', 'start', 'shot', 'began', 'bottom', 'stairs']",Contact

Perhaps this is because they both hail from the late 90s (""Contact"" came out the summer of '97 and ""Armageddon"" a year later). Toss in some elements of ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture- The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)"" and -- voila -- you have ""Contact."" Not that it doesn't possess its own uniqueness, of course.The story has to do with an astronomer (Jodie Foster) finding conclusive radio evidence of extraterrestrial life. The intelligence -- whatever it is -- then sends data on how to meet, but only one person can go.Foster's character is an atheistic scientist while her romantic interest in the story believes in God (Matthew McConaughey). The respectful tension of these two mindsets in the face of extraterrestrial contact is interesting and the filmmakers do a good job of maintaining a balance between the two, rather than advocating one above the other. Generally speaking, science and religion both pursue truth (the way it really is) but their methods differ, science stresses empirical evidence whereas religion looks to faith and love. Why can't we embrace both? (What a revolutionary idea!)Both vantage points are portrayed by people who are genuine and honest about their pursuit of truth. Between them is the character of David Drumlin (played excellently by Tom Skerritt) who is driven by selfish ambition and therefore willing to put on airs to attain his goals. But corruption comes at a price.The film is based on Carl Sagan's book of the same name. The balance in the film between fact and faith, atheism and belief can be attributed to Sagan's spiritual agnosticism. He rejected the arrogance of atheism and has stated: ""Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light-years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual."" Although I'm not a disciple of Sagan I appreciate his humility, genius and honest reflections on the awesomeness and beauty of the universe and all it's mysteries. The movie conveys this.The film runs two and a half hours.GRADE: B",4,Science and religion in wedded bliss,1361318400,"02 20, 2013",2013,2328,"['can', 'imagine', 'Armageddon', 'action', ""'d"", 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'Contact', 'Perhaps', 'hail', 'late', '90s', 'Contact', 'came', 'out', 'summer', ""'97"", 'Armageddon', 'year', 'later', 'Toss', 'elements', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Motion', 'Picture-', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'voila', 'have', 'Contact', 'Not', ""n't"", 'possess', 'own', 'uniqueness', 'course.The', 'story', 'do', 'astronomer', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'finding', 'conclusive', 'radio', 'evidence', 'extraterrestrial', 'life', 'intelligence', 'then', 'data', 'how', 'meet', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'can', 'go.Foster', 'character', 'atheistic', 'scientist', 'romantic', 'interest', 'story', 'God', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'respectful', 'tension', 'two', 'mindsets', 'face', 'extraterrestrial', 'contact', 'interesting', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'maintaining', 'balance', 'two', 'rather', 'advocating', 'one', 'other', 'Generally', 'speaking', 'science', 'religion', 'pursue', 'truth', 'way', 'really', 'methods', 'differ', 'science', 'stresses', 'empirical', 'evidence', 'whereas', 'religion', 'faith', 'love', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'embrace', 'What', 'revolutionary', 'idea', 'vantage', 'points', 'are', 'portrayed', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'genuine', 'honest', 'pursuit', 'truth', 'Between', 'character', 'David', 'Drumlin', 'played', 'excellently', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'who', 'driven', 'selfish', 'ambition', 'therefore', 'willing', 'put', 'airs', 'attain', 'goals', 'corruption', 'price.The', 'film', 'based', 'Carl', 'Sagan', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'balance', 'film', 'fact', 'faith', 'atheism', 'belief', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'Sagan', 'spiritual', 'agnosticism', 'rejected', 'arrogance', 'atheism', 'stated', 'Science', 'not', 'only', 'compatible', 'spirituality', 'profound', 'source', 'spirituality', 'When', 'recognize', 'place', 'immensity', 'light-years', 'passage', 'ages', 'when', 'grasp', 'intricacy', 'beauty', 'subtlety', 'life', 'then', 'soaring', 'feeling', 'sense', 'elation', 'humility', 'combined', 'surely', 'spiritual', ""'m"", 'not', 'disciple', 'Sagan', 'appreciate', 'humility', 'genius', 'honest', 'reflections', 'awesomeness', 'beauty', 'universe', 'mysteries', 'movie', 'this.The', 'film', 'runs', 'two', 'half', 'hours.GRADE', 'B']",Contact
