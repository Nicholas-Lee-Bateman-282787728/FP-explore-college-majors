677903,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005R5GC,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[10, 14]","I would like to go back for a moment and dig deeper into the idea of full circle. I caught this idea as I was watching this film, and I thought it was amazing the way the director showed this transition.  The first person, outside of Lytton, that Carrington falls for is a man who is only interested in a physical relationship. Although she claims she is not interested in him sexually, it is at this time in Carrington's life, she is interested in a man's mind, not what is under his pants.  She breaks off this relationship to live with Lytton, a man who can give her the intellect that she desires.  As Carrington grows older, she finds comfort in physical relationships.  In fact, the majority of this film is about physical relationships.  Carrington is never hesitant to jump into the arms of another man.  A part of me thinks that she is constantly trying to find another Lytton out there, but there is another part of me that says that she was just trying to get the physical from men, because she had the perfect man at home (Lytton of course).  So after being with a man that only wants to have a physical relationship, she jumps into the arms of a soldier. One that is great with the physical, amazing towards Lytton, and perfect for Carrington.  As this comes to a surprising end, we see her jump into a relationship that was purely sexual. There was no interaction between the two except for when they were on his boat having sex.Carrington experiences the best sex of her life with this man, but it again ... much like the others ... comes to a complete halt when he tells her that he is not really interested in her sexually. Odd, isn't how this films started with Carrington and her first boyfriend. We have come full circle.If we were to look at this film in a symmetrical angle, we would notice a circle outside with Lytton in the direct center of this circle. The circle would represent Carrington's life. All around the circle would be the men that she has been with, while Lytton would be her stability point. All throughout her encounters with other men she always is able to find comfort with her center figure ... Lytton.  If you watch this film closely, you will notice that there is only one point in the movie where Carrington goes outside the circle.  It is when she is having a party at her house.  Carrington goes outside only to sit down on a stump that happens to be facing the house.  She is able to see all the windows in the house, and all of her past lovers with their new ones.  Even Lytton with his new boyfriend.  This is the moment that we see Carrington thinking about her life. Seeing what she has been a part of, and watching it somewhat crumble down. This is her only moment outside of the circle that she has built. Lytton is the foundation to this circle, and it is obvious that without Lytton everything around Carrington must crumble as well.That my friends, is how you build a love story.Grade: *** out of *****",3,"No, she accepted.

One can read about it in Virginia Woolf's diary. But again ... Emma Thompson proves herself up to challenge - delivering an indubitably authentic performance as the enigmatic Carrington, more than twenty years her junior.  Considering the graphic sophistication of today's media audience, regularly bathed in representative imagery - no mean achievement. Both of the characters develop as they age and the story progresses, and the noted nuanced emotional complexity of the relationships seamlessly plays right into the players' wheelhouses.The film is really first rate - but not mass audience fare - and one get's far more out of the viewing having previous knowledge of the peripheral characters and relationships (for instance, it has been verified that Lady Ottoline and Carrington at least slept together on a number of occassions)which the contraints of film do not allow to be developed. In fact the whole of Carrington's ""strong Sapphic"" predlictions are merely implied, not explored in the film.The showing of her art during the closing titles - which is reminiscent of the end of original Modigliani (""Montpanarsse  - whatever the adress was)- was terrific - but feature film is all too constraining I think to explain such quintessential art and the drama which surrounds its production, no matter how great the efforts made, great as many of them are here...",5,dame emma,1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,1501,"['first', 'was', 'somewhat', 'skeptical', 'Thompson', 'was', 'born', '1959', 'Carrington', 'was', '21', 'when', 'fell', 'Lytton', 'Strachy', 'kid', 'One', 'can', 'read', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'diary', 'again', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'up', 'challenge', 'delivering', 'indubitably', 'authentic', 'performance', 'enigmatic', 'Carrington', 'more', 'twenty', 'years', 'junior', 'Considering', 'graphic', 'sophistication', 'today', 'media', 'audience', 'regularly', 'bathed', 'representative', 'imagery', 'mean', 'achievement', 'characters', 'develop', 'age', 'story', 'noted', 'nuanced', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'relationships', 'seamlessly', 'plays', 'right', 'players', 'wheelhouses.The', 'film', 'really', 'first', 'rate', 'not', 'mass', 'audience', 'fare', 'one', 'get', 'far', 'more', 'viewing', 'having', 'previous', 'knowledge', 'peripheral', 'characters', 'relationships', 'instance', 'been', 'verified', 'Lady', 'Ottoline', 'Carrington', 'least', 'slept', 'together', 'number', 'occassions', 'contraints', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'allow', 'be', 'developed', 'fact', 'whole', 'Carrington', 'strong', 'Sapphic', 'predlictions', 'are', 'merely', 'implied', 'not', 'explored', 'film.The', 'showing', 'art', 'closing', 'titles', 'reminiscent', 'end', 'original', 'Modigliani', 'Montpanarsse', 'adress', 'was', 'was', 'terrific', 'feature', 'film', 'too', 'constraining', 'think', 'explain', 'such', 'quintessential', 'art', 'drama', 'production', 'matter', 'how', 'great', 'efforts', 'made', 'great', 'many', 'are', 'here']",N/A

It is more than platonic, yet distinctively one without sexual intercourse.  Lytton is openly gay, yet is unable to deny how deeply he loves Carrington.  Carrington is in love with Lytton in an almost obsessive capacity, confessing her love to him while he does nothing to dissuade her.  In fact, his heart is obviously hers, despite his inability to desire her in a sexual way.  While they do share intimate embraces and kiss in the movie, never do they fully consummate their unique relationship.  Carrington embarks on numerous sexual affairs, marries one man (a young officer) who she ""shares"" with Lytton, and lives in torment that the only man she wants can love her in every way BUT a sexual way.  As in real life, Carrington and Lytton end up living together.  A poignant scene is when a sick and delirious Lytton calls out to Carrington, who's at his bedside.  He expresses his love and regret that he never married her, indicating his romantic love for her despite lack of physical desire for her body.Jonathan Pryce is phenomenal in this movie as Lytton Strachey.  Behind the beard and the soft voice, one could hardly recognize him as the same man who played the villain in ""What A Girl Wants.""

She waits until her mid-twenties to lose her virginity, and when she does, she finds she is subject to the unbridled passions of every lover who comes her way.  Only Lytton, who is openly homosexual, cherishes her the way she wants to be cherished, in ways that leave her free to live her own life.He is her ultimate love.  She is his ultimate love.  Neither ever fully engage that romanace and yet being afar seems to keep their love for each other real and close.Carrington is less a movie about an eccentric homosexual writer than it is a movie about a radical feminist who dares to be her own person.  She wants to be in charge of her own life, not the object of some one else's passion.  In the same way, she wants to paint and create a total living environment through which she can control her world, she wants emotional control over herself.Lytton lets her do that, because his writing consumes him, and all his boyish lovers are transitory.  The amazing decorative arts effects she paints throughout their houses are reminiscent of the Bloomsbury Group in general, but, in the movie, they represent her will be be in charge of her environment.  She has no desire to display her work or sell it.  She paints her lovers' images to retain them as she remembers them -- without demanding control over them.  Only Lytton gives her the same space.In Lytton's oddly removed love, she finds the one true love that lets her be.  While both Lytton and Carrington take other lovers, their relationship is the steadfast calm that guides both of them through storm tempests of hot passion elsewhere.In the end, the movie Carrington is about Carrington.

677913,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005R5GC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 8]","There is probably some profoundly deep irony to the idea that the writer Lytton Strachey was informed by Virginia Woolf that the ravishing young boy he had his eye on was really a woman, the painter Dora Carrington, but it remains outside of my grasp at this point.  However, I am not surprised that this story of a profound platonic love between two people is taken from the pages of history, because Hollywood is rarely inclined of the consummations it routinely wishes (remember, the classic tale of Cyrano de Bergerac comes from a play and was not written directly for the screen).Strachey, Carrington, Woolf and most of the other characters in this 1995 film were members of the Bloomsbury Group, all of whom were eccentric British geniuses who explored the dynamics of human relationships in strange ways when they were not busy exorcising their artistic impulses.  In a masterful understated performance Jonathan Pryce plays Lytton, who was a quiet, dry witted, reserved homosexual in his thirties when he met Carrington, played by Emma Thompson, who was 15 years younger and still a virgin.  Their first meetings and the strange attraction that would bind them for the rest of their lives are sketched out in the first several scenes.  The explanation for why they would live together while loving others is developed throughout the rest of the film.  What becomes clear is that no matter who Lytton and Carrington took into their respective beds, or shared between them for that matter, no one mattered more to them.  Ultimately, the tragedy of their relationship is not the absence of the physical dimension, but, as is often the case with most relationships, the failure of both to articulate the depth of their feelings to the other until fate cruelly rectifies that error.Thompson's character is on a par with the other victims of unrequited love she has played with great success in ""Howard's End"" and ""The Remains of the Day.""  Writer-Director Christopher Hampton, working from Michael Holroyd's book on Lytton Strachey, expands her character through Carrington's art: she must have painted every corner of Ham Spray House, where they lived in Berkshire.  She is the film's title character, not only because she survives Lytton, but because after they met and became friends (pure understatement, I assure you) she continued to pursue other interests and people while he was remarkably contempt to enjoy those she brought into their small circle.Still, it is Pryce's Lytton who is the captivating character.  Like most British eccentrics he was a natural epigramist, but with a great sense of restraint, picking his moment for his one rapier thrust (even if it is on his own death bed).  Carrington is the one who actively engages in the acts of intimacy between them while we have to remind our selves that Lytton's passive acceptance of it is out of a sense of propriety and not a lack of deep feelings.  I have always had a strong affection for love stories that never enter the realm of the physical (is there a sexier scene in movies that the dance in ""The King and I""?), and ""Carrington"" is a film in that tradition, especially for those with an affection for British period dramas.",4,Pryce and Thompson in a true tale of a great platonic love,1066953600,"10 24, 2003",2003,3203,"['probably', 'profoundly', 'deep', 'irony', 'idea', 'writer', 'Lytton', 'Strachey', 'was', 'informed', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'ravishing', 'young', 'boy', 'had', 'eye', 'was', 'really', 'woman', 'painter', 'Dora', 'Carrington', 'grasp', 'point', 'However', 'am', 'not', 'surprised', 'story', 'profound', 'platonic', 'love', 'two', 'people', 'taken', 'pages', 'history', 'Hollywood', 'rarely', 'inclined', 'consummations', 'routinely', 'remember', 'classic', 'tale', 'Cyrano', 'de', 'Bergerac', 'play', 'was', 'not', 'written', 'directly', 'screen', '.Strachey', 'Carrington', 'Woolf', 'most', 'other', 'characters', '1995', 'film', 'were', 'members', 'Bloomsbury', 'Group', 'whom', 'were', 'eccentric', 'British', 'geniuses', 'who', 'explored', 'dynamics', 'human', 'relationships', 'strange', 'ways', 'when', 'were', 'not', 'busy', 'exorcising', 'artistic', 'impulses', 'masterful', 'understated', 'performance', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'Lytton', 'who', 'was', 'quiet', 'dry', 'witted', 'reserved', 'homosexual', 'thirties', 'when', 'met', 'Carrington', 'played', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'who', 'was', '15', 'years', 'younger', 'still', 'virgin', 'first', 'meetings', 'strange', 'attraction', 'would', 'bind', 'rest', 'lives', 'are', 'sketched', 'out', 'first', 'several', 'scenes', 'explanation', 'why', 'would', 'live', 'together', 'loving', 'others', 'developed', 'rest', 'film', 'What', 'clear', 'matter', 'who', 'Lytton', 'Carrington', 'took', 'respective', 'beds', 'shared', 'matter', 'one', 'mattered', 'more', 'Ultimately', 'tragedy', 'relationship', 'not', 'absence', 'physical', 'dimension', 'often', 'case', 'most', 'relationships', 'failure', 'articulate', 'depth', 'feelings', 'other', 'fate', 'cruelly', 'error.Thompson', 'character', 'par', 'other', 'victims', 'unrequited', 'love', 'played', 'great', 'success', 'Howard', 'End', 'Remains', 'Day', 'Writer-Director', 'Christopher', 'Hampton', 'working', 'Michael', 'Holroyd', 'book', 'Lytton', 'Strachey', 'character', 'Carrington', 'art', 'must', 'have', 'painted', 'corner', 'Ham', 'Spray', 'House', 'where', 'lived', 'Berkshire', 'film', 'title', 'character', 'not', 'only', 'Lytton', 'because', 'met', 'became', 'friends', 'pure', 'understatement', 'assure', 'continued', 'pursue', 'other', 'interests', 'people', 'was', 'remarkably', 'contempt', 'enjoy', 'brought', 'small', 'circle.Still', 'Pryce', 'Lytton', 'who', 'captivating', 'character', 'most', 'British', 'eccentrics', 'was', 'natural', 'epigramist', 'great', 'sense', 'restraint', 'picking', 'moment', 'one', 'rapier', 'thrust', 'even', 'own', 'death', 'bed', 'Carrington', 'one', 'who', 'actively', 'acts', 'intimacy', 'have', 'remind', 'selves', 'Lytton', 'passive', 'acceptance', 'sense', 'propriety', 'not', 'lack', 'deep', 'feelings', 'have', 'always', 'had', 'strong', 'affection', 'love', 'stories', 'never', 'enter', 'realm', 'physical', 'there', 'sexier', 'scene', 'movies', 'dance', 'King', 'Carrington', 'film', 'tradition', 'especially', 'affection', 'British', 'period', 'dramas']",N/A

It is very earnest, very well acted and very pretty to look upon.  It's sometimes quite intelligent.  It is also very self-satisfied, very slow and very lacking in humor.  It's sometimes very dull, too.The virtues are just that, virtues.  Cumulatively, they build up a lot of credit for this film.  The faults, depending on a viewer's personal values, may be regarded as lying somewhere on a scale ranging from irrelevant to fatal.  I lean to one extreme.  My wife leans to the other.It might even be argued that the self-satisfaction, the humorlessness are neither more nor less than accurate depictions of Dora Carrington, Lytton Strachey and that whole self-absorbed, sexually-perplexed, navel-gazing crowd of twits at Bloomsbury.I prefer to regard the director-writer, the actors and the whole production as hopelessly gullible in taking their real life protagonists at their own value.  The Woolfs, the Bells, Strachey and Carrington herself would, if given half a chance, express themselves as characters in a drama of high-flown aspirations and tragic consequences.  I, on the other hand, tend to view them as puppets in a French farce, albeit one written by D. H. Lawrence.This film, its settings, its characters and its mind-set bear only the most tenuous connection with the real, tangible world.  As W.S. Gilbert might have put it, the film and all those in it yearn for Elysian fields, but ignore the fact that they ""can't get'em and would only let'em out on building leases"" if they had'em.  ""Carrington"" would be well served by the presence of just such a character as Fitzgerald threw in to add a spice of reality to the slow-simmering gumbo of Gatsby and Daisy and Tom: Nick, the narrator, doubter and conscience--a pallid character, yes, but still a whiff of the tax paying, traffic light-bound workaday world.As a film, ""Carrington"" is easy on the eye.  Its story is interesting enough, although I can't imagine being drawn back to watch it of my own volition again at any time in the foreseeable future.  But even as I question the worth of making the film, I can't deny the high level of skill lavished on it.I think ""Carrington"" is  a film worth seeing--once.

What a pity. This film presents an alternative twist on the theme of love, interweaving the ever-changing and amorphous desires of people and giving an honest portrayal of the ambiguous sexuality many people feel.Jonathan Pryce and Emma Thompson team up in an on-screen romance that is both tragic and fulfilling. Lytton Strachey, cold, wise, and homosexual meets promising painter Dora Carrington. She insists on being called by her surname and is even mistaken for a boy by Lytton when he first sees her. Carrington is still a virgin and repels advances by men all the time, and it's driving her boyfriend Mark insane. In desperation, Mark begs that Lytton ""work on her a bit"". The relationship between Carrington and Lytton is untainted by lust, something Carrington has always objected to. She denies Mark sex because she fears that he will become only sexually interested in her.Carrington, however, falls undeniably in love with Lytton, which is a slight inconvience considering the fact that he is gay. Still, they begin living together and spend some of the happiest years of their life. A touching moment occurs when Lytton asks Carrington, ""Why are you so good to me?"" and she replies by showing him the pen wiper which has the words ""Use Me"" on it. But alas, it must end in tragedy. The parting shot (and sound) of the film is so poignant that it left tears in my eyes.Emma Thompson carries this film entirely on her shoulders. If not for her performance, this film would not be half as enjoyable. Just watching this woman in front of the camera is absolutely fascinating. Combine that with the idiosyncratic Jonathan Pryce and a wonderful supporting cast and the mixture is very much appropriately off-beat and quirky.Definitely recommended and a must-see for Emma thompson fans.",4,A surprising look inside the nature of Love,1142121600,"03 12, 2006",2006,1940,"[""'Carrington"", 'belongs', 'category', 'films', 'are', 'obscure', 'eccentric', 'released', 'small', 'art', 'houses', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'What', 'pity', 'film', 'alternative', 'twist', 'theme', 'love', 'interweaving', 'ever-changing', 'amorphous', 'desires', 'people', 'giving', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'ambiguous', 'sexuality', 'many', 'people', 'feel.Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'team', 'up', 'on-screen', 'romance', 'tragic', 'fulfilling', 'Lytton', 'Strachey', 'cold', 'wise', 'homosexual', 'meets', 'promising', 'painter', 'Dora', 'Carrington', 'being', 'called', 'surname', 'even', 'mistaken', 'boy', 'Lytton', 'when', 'first', 'Carrington', 'still', 'virgin', 'repels', 'advances', 'men', 'time', 'driving', 'boyfriend', 'Mark', 'insane', 'desperation', 'Mark', 'Lytton', 'work', 'bit', 'relationship', 'Carrington', 'Lytton', 'untainted', 'lust', 'something', 'Carrington', 'always', 'objected', 'Mark', 'sex', 'will', 'become', 'only', 'sexually', 'interested', 'her.Carrington', 'however', 'undeniably', 'love', 'Lytton', 'slight', 'inconvience', 'considering', 'fact', 'gay', 'Still', 'begin', 'living', 'together', 'spend', 'happiest', 'years', 'life', 'touching', 'moment', 'when', 'Lytton', 'Carrington', 'Why', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'replies', 'showing', 'pen', 'wiper', 'words', 'Use', 'Me', 'alas', 'must', 'end', 'tragedy', 'parting', 'shot', 'sound', 'film', 'so', 'poignant', 'left', 'tears', 'eyes.Emma', 'Thompson', 'film', 'entirely', 'shoulders', 'not', 'performance', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'half', 'enjoyable', 'Just', 'watching', 'woman', 'front', 'camera', 'absolutely', 'fascinating', 'Combine', 'idiosyncratic', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'wonderful', 'supporting', 'cast', 'mixture', 'very', 'much', 'appropriately', 'off-beat', 'quirky.Definitely', 'recommended', 'must-see', 'Emma', 'thompson', 'fans']",N/A

Maybe because this is the art crowd who were  living in the 1920s when conventions were breaking down. Maybe I just got  used to &quot;real estate romances&quot; as Movieline termed these movies.  But I think most of it had to do with Jonathan Pryce and Emma Thompson.  She's one of those women who needs to fall in love with gay men and he  loves her attention. Together they become even more intertwined than they  are with their lovers (who seem more like window dressing than characters -  even when Emma is doing it doggie style on a boat.) and this ultimately  proves fatal for the Emma Thompson character.This seems to be the  recovery from Merchant Ivory characters. These people, instead of being  repressed, are trying to be emotional in a repressive atmosphere and going  too far but not far enough. They are toddlers learning how to walk and then  running into walls.Of course, British movies have suffered too long  under the MI spell, and this movie does remind me enough of those awful  things to only get four stars. It is odd that a fully realized British  novel (High Fidelity) about emotional people doing irrational things, but  without the repression gets made into a movie and is immediately  transplanted to Chicago.

677920,A18C1PCR8WUAST,B00005R5GC,"Tracy Hodson ""Awi Usdi""","[17, 20]","It's an odd thing when a film is perfectly cast, painstakingly researched, extraordinarily well-written, and wonderfully acted, that still it should feel a bit lifeless, stolid and conventional, completely unlike the characters it's illuminating. Look-alike Jonathan Pryce as the homosexual Lytton Strachey and the always remarkable Emma Thompson as the passionately heterosexual (Dora) Carrington act their hearts out, bringing vividly and with complete believability to life one of the oddest couples in recent history, but while Christopher Hampton has made his reputation on excellent writing such as we see here, his direction is leaden, and the film is interesting more for the work of the actors and the real people they play, rather than from any great feat of filmmaking. Sadly, not many people saw the film in the theatres despite the achievements of the cast.Dora Carrington, though a painter of note, was most famous for her life-long, rather self-abasing devotion to Lytton Strachey, the writer of a number of essays and criticisms, who later published a witty expose of four ""Eminent Victorians,"" which was subersive and significant, both literarily and financially. But like many of the Bloomsbury set to which he and Carrington more or less belonged, he was arguably more remarkable for his eccentricity, wit, and whimsical personality than for a rather slender body of brilliant writing. Pryce's portrayal of him is delightfully unrestrained and flamboyant--when he and Ottoline dance at a party, they are a pair of absurdist clowns, having a marvelous time with no concern for anyone else`s opinion.  Carrington was his devoted and loving but non-sexual partner (she once described herself as his pen-wiper, there to serve him, asking nothing in return), and between them, at first through her selflessness, then through his own recognition of the rarity of this devotion, there grows a love deeper than most marriages.  Sexual passion is something they both choose to deal with independently, and surrounding themselves with lovers who somehow also manage to (mostly) rise above sexual jealousy, they live happily together almost from initial meeting to their deaths.Her early life gave no clue that she would become such a committed non-conformist. After her graduation from the Slade School of Fine Art in London and the winning of a number of prizes, she was considered a painter of great promise, and became indeed, a quite prolific and interesting painter, but one who never even sought to show her work, despite much interest. Instead she painted to satisfy herself and others, and filled her homes with countless paintings (most famously her portrait of Lytton), especially portraits of friends and lovers, as well as covering every wall and piece of furniture with glorious scenes, delighting everyone who visited.The two were introduced by Virginia Woolf's sister, Vanessa Bell (Janet McTeer), while Carrington was visiting her and, dressed in men's clothing with her hair shorn in a Dutch boy's bob, she was mistaken by Lytton for a boy--his dismay at learning that the ""lovely boy"" romping with Nessa's sons is a young woman is amusing. At first Carrington detested him, but they spent a great deal of time with Lady Ottoline (so brutally lampooned by D. H. Lawrence in ""Women in Love,"" she is treated here with great affection). The up-and-coming painter Mark Gertler (played by Rufus Sewell with his usual vigor and intensity), has enlisted Lytton's help in his quest to seduce the reluctant virgin he has spent four years pursuing, so the two are much thrown together and soon discover that they are born soul mates, feeling a great ease and openness with one another.Eventually they decided to live together, with Carrington doing all the work to transform their first small house into a magical realm, while Lytton supported them with his earnings from the sudden, unexpected success of  ""Eminent Victorians."" They lived in perfect harmony, despite the fact that her physical passion for this man had to be diverted into relationships with other men. She married a man with whom Lytton was more in love than she, and though Rafe Partridge (Steven Waddington) did not requite Lytton's physical passion, he became a steady third in their lives with all three eventually owning their most famous home, Ham Spray House, together. Eventually a fourth was added to the family, when Rafe fell in love with another woman,  Frances (Alex Kingston), who managed to fit herself into the household, too (after Carrington`s death, they married). Throughout their years together, both Lytton and Carrington had many lovers, most of whom remained constants in their lives. Several were with him when he died of a sudden and fatal illness, which devastated Carrington. Though stories of her un-witnessed end vary, due to the need of others to try to protect her reputation, what we see in the film is  accurate in itself--what happened over the next couple of days is the time about which there are several accounts.Carrington's generous and loyal nature endeared her to everyone she knew, and she and Lytton were a happy if unusual couple. Thompson plays her with intelligence and a sort of glowing health and energy that seduces us; she lights up the screen, and despite the boyish dress and early gracelessness, her face is as clear and lovely as the summer sky and she utterly convinces us of Carrington's irresistible charm--that many men desired and loved her is hardly surprising. Just as Lytton's fragile frame and effeminate gestures would, in one less brilliant and magnetic, become difficult to live with, his kindness and humor more than make up for any of the extra work others have to do in order to ensure his comfort and security. Even the extra manly Rafe is tolerant of Lytton's slightly silly ways.  They all work hard--he is the delicate and difficult center of everyone's world, at least externally, but as we get deeper into the relationship, we see that without Carrington, he might very well have been lost to ill-health and a tendency to melancholia--she may appear to be the satellite revolving him, but a greater insight reveals that she is the solid rock upon whose stability he is entirely reliant.The film does capture the feeling of camaraderie that the Bloomsbury artists shared, their refusal to participate in the horrors of World War I, their solidarity despite the constant intrigues and affairs, and gives us some insight into the process of making art, of being artists unafraid to live outside the constraints of society. But most of all, Hampton, Thompson, and Pryce seem to really understand this unique relationship that ran so deep--the two loved and understood one another to a degree rare in life, and they seemed to be aware of this great gift, treasuring it and keeping it strong. Between them there were no secrets, and while Carrington would have loved Lytton as a woman loves a man, she accepted that this wasn't possible, and poured all her passion for him into being his mother, his sister, his dearest friend, his truest companion. Lytton repaid her devotion equally, and allowed her to build around him a real family which supported and loved him, despite his naturally solitary nature.The cast, the delightful d&eacute;cor of the homes Carrington made chiefly for Lytton`s comfort, the beauty of Carrington's paintings (please be sure to sit through the end titles, when her paintings are displayed side by side with the credits), are the principle reasons to watch this film which is worth owning, as you'll enjoy it more than once, especially if you're an artist yourself. Even if you're not, you may find yourself wanting to grab a brush and turn an old table into a work of art. Despite Hampton's flawed direction, these two people who fashioned a deeply meaningful relationship despite what most would consider built-in ""limitations,"" are fully brought to life by Emma Thompson in the title role, with Jonathan Pryce firmly by her side, as solid and fascinating as Carrington and Lytton. On the cover of a biography of Carrington is a picture of the two together, outside of Ham Spray House; Thompson's glowing smile and Pryce's dandyish pose are perfect. So perfect are they, that only after I opened the book and read that it was a photo, not of the actors, but of Carrington and Lytton themselves, did I realize how perfectly captured they'd been. I think they would have been pleased to see themselves in this film.",4,A unique relationship between two extraordinary individuals,1140566400,"02 22, 2006",2006,8498,"['odd', 'thing', 'when', 'film',
