1145050,A1GNYR4N5T7TQ1,B00143XE64,"Charles Cain ""mad gamer""","[3, 3]","Totally awesome show. I don't own the dvd and will explain why shortly. However I have seen every episode aired so far in japan via fansubs online. This show starts out good and stays good throughout.Now is the problem part. This show is almost 400 episodes long so far in japan and shows no signs of slowing down at all. Then Funimation releases this set. I am very happy as many people are that they made these dvds uncut finally, unlike the 4kids version garbage. However this box holds 13 episodes....anyone want to do the math on how many boxes will be required to hold just the current ~400 episodes? Its 30 boxes. for the first 400 episodes, plus at least 100 more episodes probably or more.What I ask for and want, is much larger box sets, use a slim form factor of some kind or other and release box sets with like 50 episodes if possible. Then I would have to buy far fewer boxes and it would take up less shelf space. I know this is mostly just semantics and personal preference, but I'm not the only one who feels this way and for a show this insanely long, more expansive box sets are necessary. Asking for this concession seems more than reasonable to me, if not an outright obvious thing to do.Lastly, How many shows do you know that run 400 episodes plus and stay good the whole time? I know of no other. So if you don't mind the size of this box or have no intention of buying more than the first few seasons, then this box is very worth your while. So go and buy it already. Those of us who plan to buy all 560 episodes of the show or however many it ends up being....all we can do is pray they will wise up and give bigger boxes. Good luck to everyone?

They run for over hundreds of episodes, which can be murder on the wallet if you want to buy all three. But, if you can choose to only follow one long running anime series, when it comes to the story One Piece has the strongest, most entertaining arc of all three.One Piece is about pirates. But, they don't hunt for treasure in the traditional sense, instead it showcases how the bonds of friendship, family, and memories might be the greatest treasures of all.This two disk set contains the first 13 episodes of this great anime series. Like the other two popular series, One Piece starts relatively simple before picking up stride. Two noteworthy antagonists are found in this volume: Captain Axe-Hand Morgan and Captain Buggy the Clown. As well as introducing three of the main characters: Luffy, Zorro, and Nami. Coming to you uncut and uncensored from Funimation, with dual audio: English, or Japanese with English Subtitles.

Be it the Head Pirate over all others, being the best swordsman in all the land or the best thief ever.  All the characters have something that brings them together good or bad.

1145053,A16TCB7BYD8WXP,B00143XE64,Erik K. Olund,"[4, 6]","At long last, One Piece is being released as it was made to be. Ever since July, 2004, America has been plagued with the irritating English release by 4kids Entertainment. Now, Funimation has picked up the license and is releasing uncut, unedited episodes with an all new English cast and optional Japanese language and English subtitles.This set features the first 13 episodes of the long running pirate epic, One Piece. A young boy, Luffy, sets out to sea with prospects of gathering a strong crew of mates, becoming the strongest pirate in the world, and finding the legendary treasure, the One Piece. Along the way, he'll meet several villains with evils ranging from power and status, greed, and basic malcontent with the rest of the world. This melodramatic, heroes-against-villains premise pushed the series into the spotlight with believable human drama and bloody duels. While these first few episodes may seem to be a bit slow in some places and the animation doesn't look as shiny and bright as other series, it should be remembered that these episodes were made in 1999. However, the main point of this release is that the One Piece series is getting the treatment it deserves, following Funimation's successful release of the eighth movie.The new English cast is exceptional, in my opinion. Most of the new actors do a fine job portraying the the enduring characters. The script is accurate to the original, and the new gags are decent. I particularly enjoy Chris Sabat as Roronoa Zoro. Mike McFarland as Buggy the Clown leaves a little to be desired, but otherwise the dub is enjoyable. Changes include an English dub of the opening and closing songs (both of which are not quite as good as the original, but very close), and the removal of text from the opening, plus changing the original One Piece logo to the Funimation version. The original Japanese cast is slightly superior, but it is harder to notice in the earlier episodes, as the actors are still getting used to the characters, especially Kazuya Nakai(Zoro) and Kappei Yamaguchi(Usopp) who overacts the ""determined scenes"" too much in the beginning.Do pick up this set as there will be many more to follow. The series is filled with charming, memorable characters, ranging from the simple-minded, but determined protagonist Monkey D. Luffy, to the sneaky, infatuating theif Nami. The series contains several hilarious situations that show the world what screwball slapstick can accomplish, and awe-inspiring character drama that will remind why people learn to trust and love one another.The art style is unique and varied, as the crew meets hordes of intelligently designed individuals. The characters go into exaggerated face faults when annoyed, shocked, or greatly amused, and the undying charm of camaraderie keeps you hooked on this great series.Along with the 13 uncut episodes, the first episode has an English commentary track on the first episode(featuring Coleen Clinkenbeard[Luffy], Chris Sabat[Zoro], and Mike McFarland[Buggy, Line Producer]), textless opening and closing animation, the DBZ-inspired Marathon Mode that allows one to play all episodes in order while removing the additional opening and closing songs and teasers, and the typical page full of Funimation trailers, including the trailer for the next volume of One Piece.Currently, the price of this set is just over $20. This is a fantastic deal.

1145054,A3LIWTQDSQ5UOO,B00143XE64,"Jonathan Oyama ""Welcome to die!""","[1, 1]","If anyone remembers, 4Kids ruined the first American TV run of ""One Piece"" with a god-awful opening song rap and other terrible dubs.However, for the most part, Funimation does a great job with all the dubs and the special features in ""First Voyage (Uncut).""This is ""One Piece"" as it was meant to be seen. Characters gets scarred up by swords and other weapons, but Luffy and his friends manage to take out plenty of evil pirates, while helping other people along the way.Luffy wants to travel on the Grand Line to find treasure, to become the world's greatest pirate and to return his straw hat to his idol, Captain Shanks. Luffy's friends also want to travel for their own reasons. Roronoa Zoro wants to become the world's greatest swordsman, for his friend Kuina. Nami is a pirate pickpocket who doesn't want to join Luffy, but she still admires Luffy's courage and passion for his friends.Overall, ""One Piece"" follows the typical shonen format, in which superpowered characters beat up villains with special powers. However, ""One Piece"" has tons of charming characters. Luffy always reveals his presence at the most inconvenient times, saying whatever he feels like saying. Zoro is a cool-headed swordsman, wielding swords in both hands and a sword in his mouth. And Nami is much tougher and more cunning than Kaoru (from Rurouni Kenshin) could ever be.There are a couple quips. Funimation dubbed English voices to sing the original TV theme, which sounds somewhat better than the 4Kids rap, but still awful. And some of the dubs are mediocre. For example, one of the marines in episode one threw a grappling hook and missed a barrel in the ocean. Then his buddy says, ""HA!HA!HA! You suck!"" Overall, though, the voice actors do a good job. Luffy's voice actor is especially great at capturing the Gum-gum punch voice.So, don't be afraid of some of the slightly mediocre dubs or the somewhat unconventional character designs. This is an excellent shonen anime that never stops losing momentum. The fights are intense and the characters are unforgettable. And although ""First Voyage"" ends in the middle of the epic battle between Captain Kuro and Django, it's a great introduction to an awesome series.",5,Piece Out With Luffy and the Gang,1235952000,"03 2, 2009",2009,2204,"['anyone', 'remembers', '4Kids', 'ruined', 'first', 'American', 'TV', 'run', 'One', 'Piece', 'god-awful', 'opening', 'song', 'rap', 'other', 'terrible', 'dubs.However', 'most', 'part', 'Funimation', 'great', 'job', 'dubs', 'special', 'features', 'First', 'Voyage', 'Uncut', 'One', 'Piece', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'seen', 'Characters', 'scarred', 'up', 'swords', 'other', 'weapons', 'Luffy', 'friends', 'manage', 'take', 'out', 'plenty', 'evil', 'pirates', 'helping', 'other', 'people', 'way.Luffy', 'travel', 'Grand', 'Line', 'find', 'treasure', 'become', 'world', 'greatest', 'pirate', 'return', 'straw', 'hat', 'idol', 'Captain', 'Shanks', 'Luffy', 'friends', 'also', 'want', 'travel', 'own', 'reasons', 'Roronoa', 'Zoro', 'become', 'world', 'greatest', 'swordsman', 'friend', 'Kuina', 'Nami', 'pirate', 'pickpocket', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'join', 'Luffy', 'still', 'Luffy', 'courage', 'passion', 'friends.Overall', 'One', 'Piece', 'typical', 'shonen', 'format', 'superpowered', 'characters', 'beat', 'up', 'villains', 'special', 'powers', 'However', 'One', 'Piece', 'tons', 'charming', 'characters', 'Luffy', 'always', 'presence', 'most', 'inconvenient', 'times', 'saying', 'whatever', 'saying', 'Zoro', 'cool-headed', 'swordsman', 'wielding', 'swords', 'hands', 'sword', 'mouth', 'Nami', 'much', 'tougher', 'more', 'cunning', 'Kaoru', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'could', 'ever', 'are', 'couple', 'quips', 'Funimation', 'dubbed', 'English', 'voices', 'sing', 'original', 'TV', 'theme', 'somewhat', 'better', '4Kids', 'rap', 'still', 'awful', 'dubs', 'are', 'mediocre', 'example', 'one', 'marines', 'episode', 'one', 'threw', 'grappling', 'hook', 'missed', 'barrel', 'ocean', 'Then', 'buddy', 'HA', 'HA', 'HA', 'suck', 'Overall', 'though', 'voice', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'Luffy', 'voice', 'actor', 'especially', 'great', 'capturing', 'Gum-gum', 'punch', 'voice.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'slightly', 'mediocre', 'dubs', 'somewhat', 'unconventional', 'character', 'designs', 'excellent', 'shonen', 'anime', 'never', 'losing', 'momentum', 'fights', 'are', 'intense', 'characters', 'are', 'unforgettable', 'First', 'Voyage', 'middle', 'epic', 'battle', 'Captain', 'Kuro', 'Django', 'great', 'introduction', 'awesome', 'series']",One Piece: Season 1 - First Voyage

1145058,A29HVOSR9VLFKP,B00143XE64,Mike  Silverman,"[0, 0]","The action flows very smoothly and very quickly in this series, there are very few dull moments. What really makes this series work is that you care about the characters. Each of the key character has a full story behind them. You learn about their backgrounds, what motivates them, why they are the way they are.  This is what separates a good series from a truly great one. You cheer them when they are victorious, you worry when they get hurt.Here are some of the key characters in the series.The main character, Luffy, is so carefree and happy it's funny. He lives for the moment.  When he's hungry he looks for food and eats as much as he can.  When he's tired he drops where he is and starts sleeping. He tries to befriend everyone and he continuously finds it hard to believe that anyone could be mad at him. He is unswervingly honest.  In fact his directness and honesty gets him into quite a bit of trouble since he speaks his mind freely without a second thought as to how other people might take what he's saying. There are only two things that ever seem to genuinely disturb him.  When anyone mocks his straw hat or tries to damage it, and when anyone hurts his friends. When that happens, you'd better run for cover. When he was a young child he accidentally consumed a strange fruit called the Devil Fruit that came from the mysterious Grand Line, as a result Luffy can stretch his body in a hundred different ways and knows how to use this strange power to very effectively deliver a beating to his enemies. The offset is, consuming the fruit has robbed him of his ability to swim or even to float when in the water, and this gets him into serious trouble many times. Luffy wants to be King of the Pirates, and while he's certainly got the free-wheeling spirit necessary, he doesn't really have the heart to be vicious cruel and brutal like a real pirate would be. His goal is to sail to the Grand Line and find the One Piece, the secret treasure of the former Pirate King known as Gold Roger.Roronoa Zoro ( Mostly called Zoro in the series ) is the first recruit Luffy gets as he starts to form his Pirate crew.  Zoro is known as  ""The Pirate Hunter"" and is a master swordsman.  He carries three swords and knows how to use them all at the same time very effectively.  His goal is to become the world's greatest swordsman, an oath he swore to accomplish, in memory of a young girl who was also a sword master. They had constantly challenged each other to sword contests as children and she had always won. Zoro was determined to keep training until he could beat her, and though they were bitter rivals they had a respectful friendship. Tragically she dies while Zoro is still very young and still training, and Zoro now carries her sword in her memory and uses it as one of his three swords whenever he fights.Usopp, who calls himself ""Captian Usopp"" , is Luffy's next recruit.  A young man with long hair and an unusually long nose who is very good with his slingshot, which he uses with his own home made pellets filled with different substances to create different effects. He has a reputation as a prodigious liar, and he does lie frequently, but not very well. He's rather cowardly, and often runs from serious enemies.  As such he's very good at running, and very good at sneak attacks. Though he has a cowardly streak in him, he usually overcomes it when his friends are in trouble and will stand up to villians when the others really need him. Basically a good hearted guy, Usopp keeps the crew amused with his wild stories and his silly antics.Sanji is next on board Luffy's crew. Sanji is an execllent chef and a very sharp dresser. Slender and blonde, always looking suave and well groomed, he typically has a small cigarette dangling from his lips.  Aside from being a great chef he has incredibly powerful legs and can kick down walls and through steel doors. He was trained by a powerful former pirate captian named Zeff who saved Sanji's life when Sanji was just a young boy. Zeff, known as red-foot because of all the men he kicked to death, is likely from whom Sanji learned his kick tecnhiques. Sanji is seeking the ""All Blue"", a legendary place where the four oceans of the world meet and fish from all the oceans are available at one spot for catching. A chef's dream place. Sanji is in love with Nami, but Nami doesn't feel the same about Sanji and constantly fights off his romantic advances.Nami is the next recruit. She is a master navigator and map maker. Her skills are unrivaled at steering on the sea. She was a captive slave of the vicious pirates known as the Arlong Pirates, half-fish and half-men, they took over her village when she was young and the fish-man pirate leader, Arlong, made a bargain with her that he would set her and her village free if she could gather one hundred million berries. ( berries... the form of currency in the world of One Piece ). Meanwhile they held her captive at their compound , forcing her to use her skills at map making to set up their own exploitation of the seaboard. It took eight years but Nami finally had colleted almost all of the ransom, by stealing treasure from other pirates.  But Arlong cheated her, and in a deal with a corrupt marine commander had her secret stash of treasure confiscated. Leaving her with no way to pay the ransom. Luffy , learning of her struggle, invaded Arlong's compound and fought him on behalf of Nami, and Nami agreed to join his crew after that.There is a lot humor , some touching sentimental moments, and some VERY weird battles and insane characters they encounter along the way. It's really the intense characters and bizarre battles that make this series stand out.  I can't think of anything else that compares to it. Once you start watching, you will definitely be hooked on it. The DVD's worked perfectly, great video and audio.  Also, a great feature included on the DVD's in this series is the option for ""Marathon"" Play. That allows you to watch all the episodes on the disk, in a row, without having to watch the opening and closing song segment and credits every time. While there are some violent fights and some drinking/smoking that goes on, I'd rate it a PG level.- Mike S.",5,SUPERIOR,1264377600,"01 25, 2010",2010,6218,"['action', 'very', 'smoothly', 'very',

Clear, crisp visuals. Clean sound. NO EDITING. WOO HOO!!One technical complaint is that the individual episode links don't seem to work on Disk 2. No matter which episode I select, it always starts on the first one on the disk. Annoying, but not deal-breaking. Marathon mode (where you can watch all the episodes on a disk in a row with titles and re-cap cut out) MORE than makes up for this minor production flaw. I just hope they get that sorted out on the next set.I'm a purist, I admit it. Personally, I listen only to the Japanese track. I know a dub is essential for marketing in the US, but honestly, one is missing SO MUCH of the One Piece experience if one only listens to the dub.Part and parcel of the One Piece package is the INCREDIBLE voice acting on the part of the Japanese seiyuu; only they seem able to bring these amazing, inspiring, crazy characters to full life. Just watching Luffy's Gomu Gomu no Bazooka or Zoro's Oni Giri in motion doesn't quite do it... you need to *hear* them. Especially the always wacky and delightful Kappei Yamaguchi (more commonly known for his role as Inuyasha) as Usopp the Liar and the series-favorite Kazuki Yao who creates distinctive voices for many of the more, um, *unique* villains along the way (until he finally joins the crew much later!).I'd really like to see the Japanese versions of the title/ending songs as extras next time too, in addition to the English re-works (which actually are pretty decent). You did *so* much better then 4Kids with this one, Funimation, that it's no real comparison. I like to pretend that horror doesn't even exist, actually. (Now if we could just get Viz to show the manga more respect too.... *heavy sigh*)THANK YOU for saving One Piece, Funimation. It more than deserves the chance to be as big over here as it still is in Japan after 10 years!Keep up the good work and... when does the next set come out?

1145060,AFV2584U13XP3,B00143XE64,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[1, 2]","My friend had told me about this series and how great it was and after getting the first four season one voyage sets and seeing them all I can say is while not bad it really wasn't my kind of anime either.  For the most part the main three characters Luffy, Zoro, and Nami were decent enough but after a few episodes of watching it felt a little like another series I was watching, at first I couldn't put my finger on who Luffy reminded me of but than it hit me his personality resembles Naruto a lot I thought the main connection I felt was their dreams they give the other people in their series with Luffy wanting to be the pirate king and Naruto wanting to be the Hokage and both of them are at first ridiculed and humored for their lofty dreams but after showing their resolve are encouraged as others start to truly believe in them.  The one other thing that didn't pull me into the series was the animation which is a miss or hit I feel for some people depending on their likes, and for me this series animation was a miss as while it's not bad animation the way they drew some of the characters really put me off as you couldn't take them either as a serious or dramatic character to well.  So for anime fans is the series worth buying?,  I suggest trying to watch a few episodes online ate least five of them to get to know the characters to finally decide also realize that the series in all is a bout 350 or so episodes so expect to wait a long time to finish your collection of this series.",4,An Enjoyable Enough Series But Doesn't Really Do Anything For Me,1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,1503,"['friend', 'had', 'told', 'series', 'how', 'great', 'was', 'getting', 'first', 'four', 'season', 'one', 'voyage', 'sets', 'seeing', 'can', 'say', 'not', 'bad', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'kind', 'anime', 'most', 'part', 'main', 'three', 'characters', 'Luffy', 'Zoro', 'Nami', 'were', 'decent', 'enough', 'few', 'episodes', 'watching', 'felt', 'little', 'series', 'was', 'watching', 'first', 'could', ""n't"", 'put', 'finger', 'who', 'Luffy', 'reminded', 'hit', 'personality', 'Naruto', 'lot', 'thought', 'main', 'connection', 'felt', 'was', 'dreams', 'give', 'other', 'people', 'series', 'Luffy', 'wanting', 'be', 'pirate', 'king', 'Naruto', 'wanting', 'be', 'Hokage', 'are', 'first', 'ridiculed', 'humored', 'lofty', 'dreams', 'showing', 'resolve', 'are', 'encouraged', 'others', 'start', 'truly', 'believe', 'one', 'other', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'pull', 'series', 'was', 'animation', 'miss', 'hit', 'feel', 'people', 'depending', 'likes', 'series', 'animation', 'was', 'miss', 'not', 'bad', 'animation', 'way', 'drew', 'characters', 'really', 'put', 'off', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'either', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'character', 'well', 'So', 'anime', 'fans', 'series', 'buying', 'suggest', 'trying', 'watch', 'few', 'episodes', 'online', 'ate', 'least', 'five', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'finally', 'decide', 'also', 'realize', 'series', 'bout', '350', 'so', 'episodes', 'so', 'expect', 'wait', 'long', 'time', 'finish', 'collection', 'series']",One Piece: Season 1 - First Voyage

Yeah, I really wish there were special features, and I hope and pray with all my might that future releases will contain more episdoes, since - as many have mentioned - One Piece is still going strong at 500+ chapters in the manga and 300+ episodes of the anime.And it is all oh so good. I am consistently amazed by this show. Sure, it's goofy and adventurous. But it can also be utterly heartbreaking, gut-bustlingly hilarious, and violent enough at points to be wince-worthy. Not that any one of those things is merit enough by itself. It's just that One Piece is all of those things at once and it's so darn seamless. Really. I cannot praise this show highly enough.That being said, since this is a review of a DVD set and not the entire show, I was unsure about buying this set because it only has the first thirteen episodes, but I bought it in hopes that my purchase would reflect the desire for One Piece among American consumers. Plus, it's fantastic to watch on a large television screen, instead of a small computer screen.And if you are worried about the English dubbed voices, let me just tell you that I am in love with the original Japanese voices, but my 10-year-old sister has a hard time reading subtitles, so we watched it with the English dub. It does take an episode or two to get used to the new voices, but Funimation has really done a good job. Characters don't have outrageous and stereotypical accents like in the 4Kids dub, and Zoro is actually called ""Zoro"" instead of ""Zolo""! Hurrah!It's lovely to go back and relive the early days when all our favorite characters first met, and to viewers who are new to the world of One Piece, I want to put it on the record that when I first read One Piece (I read the manga before I saw the anime) it took me quite a while to get into it. Heck, I didn't even like pirates! But all good things take time, and I kept reading, and soon I was hooked. So give it a chance. And if it turns out it's not your cup of tea, then thanks for looking anyways.

These 13 episodes cover the beginning of Monkey D. Luffy's quest to become the Pirate King, including the introductions of crewmates Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and also Luffy's fateful childhood encounter with his hero Shanks. The set ends halfway through the ""Kuro"" arc, as the gang fight to protect a village from being pillaged by pirates. To be continued in volume 2.As mentioned, this is not the horrid 4Kids dub, nor is it a merely serviceable dub like so many other anime shows are saddled with. There's care in the script and the acting, making the English adaptation just as valid and enjoyable as the original Japanese. The original music is intact as well, and even the openings and endings have faithful English counterparts. There's strong production value all around.About the only thing that keeps this set from being truly ""uncut and unedited"" as billed would have been the inclusion of the original One Piece logo on an alternate angle (Funi uses their gold variation, which removes the Luffy caricature for an actual ""I"").
