Not only does Denzel do a great job acting, but he makes you believe he's that person in real life. From making him want to love/hate him as a crooked cop in 'Training Day' to making you empathize as a parent in desperate need in 'John Q' these films are well worth the purchase!",5,Denzel!!!!!!,1395014400,"03 17, 2014",2014,403,"['first', 'started', 'watching', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'captivated', 'Not', 'only', 'Denzel', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'acting', 'believe', 'person', 'real', 'life', 'making', 'want', 'love/hate', 'crooked', 'cop', ""'Training"", 'Day', 'making', 'empathize', 'parent', 'desperate', 'need', ""'John"", 'Q', 'films', 'are', 'well', 'purchase']","4 Film Favorites: Denzel Washington (Fallen, John Q, The Pelican Brief, Training Day)"

""Fallen"" was totally unexpected. A very odd premise, but very worth watching until the end. ""Training Day"" was really full of twists and turns and the plot was incredibly complicated. When you finally understand what has happened, you realize how much you missed by watching it only one time. The other 2 were great acting on his part. He just is one of our finest actors.
