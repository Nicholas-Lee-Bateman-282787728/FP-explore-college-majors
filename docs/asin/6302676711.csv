When Martin Harvey, played by Martin Short, inherits a yacht from an uncle he decides he wants to sail it to Florida to sell. His wife Katherine, played by Mary Kay Place, isn't overly thrilled until she finds out that it was once owned by Clark Gable and may be worth a quarter of a million. They take the kids Benjamin, played by Benjamin Salisbury, and Caroline, played by Meadow Sisto, to pick it up. When they arrive they find that the yacht has been neglected for years and looks a wreck. The company wanting to buy the yacht then decides to change Captains and in walks Captain Ron, played by Kurt Russell, to sail them to Miami. To say he is a seadog with a very unique style of sailing and an unusual outlook on life puts it mildly.Now along the way they find the yacht has dry rot, fall overboard a couple times, get lost a few times, play hide the salami, almost drown in the shower, run into Guerillas, NOT GORILLAS!, get hijacked by Pirates of the Caribbean, NOT THE DISNEYLAND RIDE!, get tattoos, land in Cuba, and generally have an exceptional adventure. I love both Martin Short and Kurt Russell and this movie is great fun. Capn Ron's and Martin's dialogue is hysterical. If you like comedies like ""Summer Rental"" and ""Overboard"" you should enjoy this movie. The DVD is nicely done in Widescreen and the picture and sound quality are great.

I like the idea the movie brings up, getting an old boat and taking the family out for an adventure, or two, or three.  It starts with a standard uptight family that has gotten busy enough with the day to day everything that they really don&#8217;t know or respect each other much.  When the dad, Martin Short, agrees to take a boat from point A to point B, he thinks it would a good experience for them all.

The film follows a family as they hire a boat captain to help them sail their inherited boat from a Caribbean Island (something like Potato) to Miami so they can sell it.  They plan on spending a family bonding 45-day adventure at sea and end up spending 45 days of hell on the water.  What's great about this film is that it's far from predictable, it's humorous and witty and completely unexpected and will keep you entertained until the very end.

327397,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6302676711,David Baldwin,"[2, 2]","The critics are an odd bunch.  They'll collectively dump on a movie like mindless nimrods without even giving it a chance which is the case with ""Captain Ron"".  Leonard Maltin's movie guide gives the film the dreaded BOMB rating.  I avoided seeing the film because of said critics.  My interest in it was piqued when I was surfing Amazon and I saw a preponderance of five star ratings.  After seeing the movie I can honestly say that the unvarnished opinion of the average Joes is more on target than the overfed minions who are paid to mindlessly trash decent flicks.  Kurt Russell, not unlike Jeff Bridges, is one of our more underappreciated actors.  Time and again he has shown his versatility whether it be drama, comedy, action or whatever.  Here he tackles broad comedy and he had me in his introductory scene where he stumbles out of a ""borrowed"" car and proceeds to sink it in the drink by not applying the breaks.  This is not an over-the-top performance but one of subtle touches that tickle the funny bone.  It's that semi-raspy voice that suggests a past that includes some unsaid overindulgence of chemical relaxation.  It's the eyepatch he wears under the sunglasses.  It's the perpetual five o'clock shadow that hints that this guy is on his own private Idaho.  Whatever it is Russell has created an indelible screen character.  The film is a vehicle for Russell and it's success sinks or swims on his performance and consummate pro that Russell is the movie goes swimmingly.  One of the more irrelevant criticisms I've heard is that funnyman Martin Short plays straight man to Russell.  One can assume that Short read the script and as any good comedian knows too many cooks spoil the broth.

327421,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,6302676711,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[12, 12]","CAPTAIN RON is my favorite stupid movie. The story of Captain Ron Rico, a one-eyed scoundrel and charter boat skipper (in that order) and the white bread and mayonnaise Harvey family from Chicagoland, this movie is just so absurdly over the top that it's irresistible.The Harveys have inherited a sea hag that once belonged to Gable and Lombard. The old wooden ketch is gorgeously appointed but dry-rotted and barely seaworthy. Dad Martin Harvey (Martin Short) decides that there's one last sail left in her---to the breaker's yard. He convinces his wife Katherine (Mary Kay Place) and his children Caroline (Meadow Sisto) and Ben (Benjamin Cunningham) to have a nicely planned out ""spontaneous adventure"" taking the old wreck from the mythical Isle of St. Pomme de Terre (""It means St. Potato, honey."" ""No it doesn't."") to Miami.Since the Harveys can't sail, they hire the disreputable Captain Ron to skipper the boat. Kurt Russell has so much fun playing Captain Ron that he literally eats the storyboards, giving us a portrayal that's half Jimmy Buffett and half Baby Huey spiked with Malibu Rum. His one-liners are all priceless (""Yeah, incentives are important, I learned that in rehab."") and they are constant.Captain Ron is a consummate sailor, but in the tradition of the true Old Salts of yore, he's totally ragtag, disdaining charts, fuel capacity, weather conditions, international politics, sobriety, and the Harveys own plans as he wanders, Odysseus-like from island to island, drinking, seducing women, enraging husbands, outrunning insurgents, and avoiding arrest on any number of charges, all with the bewildered Harveys in tow.But as adventure piles on adventure (including a brief internment in Cuba, and a pitched battle with a pirate ship named ""Albondiga"" i.e., ""The Meatball""), Captain Ron shows a daring and competence under pressure that his happy-go-lucky ways belie, thus winning the hearts of the Harveys.The lemon in this lemonade is the usually sidesplitting Martin Short, who comes across as mostly inept. As the rest of the family starts to take a shine to their bizarre shipmate and he to them, Short never quite manages to have the obligatory male bonding moment with Captain Ron. In Short's defense, he's also stuck with some of the dumbest dialogue ever written for the screen (""You said GOrilla, not GUERRilla...Go, guh, go, guh."" and ""I can't stand Captain Ron, he's eating my brain!"" (?)).This is Kurt Russell's film and he got 95% of the good lines. Short got stuck with ALL the downers. That's a shame, and it's the only flaw in this otherwise uproarious film. Everybody on the set looks like they're about to lose it utterly, and that's part of the fun of watching. A good time is definitely had by all.CAPTAIN RON is a cult comedy classic. If you've ever owned a boat or sailed, you will instantly recognize Captain Ron as the squint-eyed grinning undine who lives aboard every boat and in the heart of every true sailor. This is my favorite stupid movie for a reason, and it'll be yours, too.

I think some negative reactions are from disappointed expectations rather than the movie not being actually good. One problem is that it's marketed as a comedy but I don't really see it that way. It's one of those movies that is more amusing than laugh out loud funny. I notice that there are many enthusiastic reviews here.Obviously, much of the fun is in watching Kurt Russell and Martin Short. Regarding Kurt Russell, the guy is a major star and goes waaaay back to the 60s as already a major star. If you are a fan of his (as 40+ years' worth of people are), you will enjoy watching him cut up in this whacky role. He's a lot of fun and since I've been a fan since 1967's Flubber, I really enjoyed his entire performance.I'm a big Martin Short fan but so often his roles in movies are restrained, e.g. The Three Amigos. I'm not really sure what he is shooting for in that persona, but if you like him he can come across as charming in whatever he says or does. In this case his character is again restrained, the straight guy, and on the annoying side, plus he's a little bit of a loser. None of that seems like a formula for success and I don't really think the character or performance works all that well but since I like him he comes across as charming for me.The movie is largely an adventure and it works on that level. A lot of things go wrong and I don't like that type of movie but it doesn't hit that close to home for me because I've never tried to quit my job and take a boat across the world. So the situations seem so outlandish that I can laugh them off without feeling Martin's pain.Also this movie features Benjamin Salisbury (Brighton from ""The Nanny."") He's a great actor, I really like the way he delivers his lines.Anyway, as many others here have said, it's pretty good and especially if you're a fan of either or both of the stars, it's worth watching.",4,It's good.

And despite his stunningly long career, in my opinion, this is without a doubt his best comedy, even outpacing the funny 'Overboard' and thoseDexter Riley Disney flicksthat have long since found a special place my heart.Short plays Martin Harvey, anonymous cog in a large company and recent recipient of a bequeathed luxury yacht from an uncle not seen in twenty years. His plan: Whisk the family away from the infamous Chicago Winter and sail though the sun-soaked Caribbean isles, then onto Florida to a boat broker who has already agreed to purchase the craft, cash out and head home with a pocketful of money and a wonderful experience. Seems pretty straight-forward.Unbeknownst to Martin, the busy broker absent-mindedly agreed to the deal without doing a proper records check. However, having finally done so, he unhappily discovers the age of this particular craft. Realizing that he might be throwing good money after bad, surreptitiously amends the original order. Instead of getting one of his best contractors to guide the craft to their facility, he decides to hire the cheapest rent-a-captain in the world - that would be Cap'n Ron. The living embodiment of a one-eyed, beer-guzzling, knucklehead pirate if there ever was one.The meeting of The Harvey Family and Cap'n Ron is inauspicious to say the least. While the family awaits his arrival - they notice a crazy man who carelessly drives a vintage car off the wharf, dumping it into the ocean. Running toward the yacht, rapid introductions are made as Ron seems *very* eager to start the family's special cruise. And as the boat leaves the dock, in the distant background you can see why he was desperate to get under way - an angry husband with a gun! And this is just the beginning of the movie. X-DThis hasty first encounter sets the stage for the movie as Martin and Ron repeatedly clash with one another - eager dad versus the sly crusty pirate - with hilarious consequences. To this day, on the rare occasion that 'guerilla' is worked into a conversation, I never fail to correct the speaker about gorillas - that they only exist in Equatorial Africa and not in places like Afghanistan.The results are mixed. But I laugh anyway. :-DI've long since memorized all the lines and scenes - and it's ready to load anytime I've had a bad day.",5,Gurr - Gohr. Big Difference!

From strip monopoly and ""pull in somewheres and ask for directions"" to ""guerillas not go-rillas"" and the Pirates of the Caribbean this movie has all the high seas adventure anyone could ask for.The Harvey family has inherited a boat from some uncle and they decide to sail it in themselves to sell it and have a vacation at the same time. The movie doesn't really start until we meet Captain Ron and from there the adventure ensues. This movie is hilarious and there is something for everyone.
