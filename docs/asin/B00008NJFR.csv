I was expecting to be sitting at home on the couch watching Brian Wilson perform almost 30 of his greatest songs live in concert. When I did finish watching it, however, I was kind of dissapointed.My major gripe is that it's not what it what I thought it was. There are only a handful of complete live performances. The rest of the songs are either from rehearsals (and those are just more snippets) or a capella performances by Brian with his friends and with Ronnie Spector that are so pointless, they don't even merit credit on the box. The interviews are tame and never really catch fire (who'd want to see Brian teaching Neil Young the organ part on &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; ?). However, it's not all bad. The live performances that are here - &quot;Fun, Fun, Fun&quot;, &quot;California Girls&quot;, &quot;Do It Again&quot;, &quot;God Only Knows&quot;, &quot;Darlin&quot;, &quot;Add Some Music To Your Day&quot;, etc - are electrifying. But if you want to see Brian work his magic with a live crowd, get &quot;Brian Wilson Live At The Roxy Theater&quot;, with 2 discs of Brian dong what he does best.I really think that this dvd could've been better. Hopefully Brian will release a complete live concert on dvd in the near future featuring hits, rare tunes and solo numbers interspliced with some chatter here and there. &quot;Brian Wilson On Tour&quot; is not that.",3,"Good, But Brian's Live Album Is Much Better",1075075200,"01 26, 2004",2004,1431,"['had', 'extremely', 'high', 'hopes', 'when', 'heard', 'dvd', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'sitting', 'home', 'couch', 'watching', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'perform', 'almost', '30', 'greatest', 'songs', 'live', 'concert', 'When', 'did', 'finish', 'watching', 'however', 'was', 'kind', 'dissapointed.My', 'major', 'gripe', 'not', 'what', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'are', 'only', 'handful', 'complete', 'live', 'performances', 'rest', 'songs', 'are', 'either', 'rehearsals', 'are', 'just', 'more', 'snippets', 'capella', 'performances', 'Brian', 'friends', 'Ronnie', 'Spector', 'are', 'so', 'pointless', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'merit', 'credit', 'box', 'interviews', 'are', 'tame', 'never', 'really', 'catch', 'fire', 'who', ""'d"", 'want', 'see', 'Brian', 'teaching', 'Neil', 'Young', 'organ', 'part', 'quot', 'Good', 'Vibrations', 'quot', 'However', 'not', 'bad', 'live', 'performances', 'are', 'here', 'quot', 'Fun', 'Fun', 'Fun', 'quot', 'quot', 'California', 'Girls', 'quot', 'quot', 'Do', 'Again', 'quot', 'quot', 'God', 'Only', 'Knows', 'quot', 'quot', 'Darlin', 'quot', 'quot', 'Add', 'Music', 'Your', 'Day', 'quot', 'etc', 'are', 'electrifying', 'want', 'see', 'Brian', 'work', 'magic', 'live', 'crowd', 'get', 'quot', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'Live', 'Roxy', 'Theater', 'quot', '2', 'discs', 'Brian', 'dong', 'what', 'best.I', 'really', 'think', 'dvd', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'Hopefully', 'Brian', 'will', 'release', 'complete', 'live', 'concert', 'dvd', 'near', 'future', 'featuring', 'hits', 'rare', 'tunes', 'solo', 'numbers', 'interspliced', 'chatter', 'here', 'there', 'quot', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'Tour', 'quot', 'not']",N/A

I sat through the whole thing and ended up kind of unhappy. I know I'm probably not going to get a lot of ""helpful"" votes for this review, but this is solely my opinion, and I'm sure a few people will agree with me.First up, I was expecting a full - blown concert dvd, like the superior ""The Beach Boys : Good Timin' - Live At Knebowrth"", which featured a low - profile Brian at his worst, but he and the rest of the band gave a pitch - perfect performance. Instead, this is a documentary featuring less than a handful of complete live performances and even the rehearsal footage of some songs are butchered to mere snippets. I was also looking forward to hear Brian perform ""Vegetables"" in concert. I thought thsi song was so complex and produced nobody could pull it off in concert, and I really looking forward to hearing how Brian did it. Imagine my frustation when it was just shown as a brief a capella performance in a Vegas hotel lobby. I was also mad that my favorite song that Brian sang with the Beach Boys, ""Don't Worry Baby"", is performed as a joke in brain's dressing room by Ronnie Spector. And the new song on the dvd, ""Saturday Morning In The City"" is just Brian at the piano singing a 30 - secodn recognition of the song. How's that for your money ? If they really wanted to make a documentary of an artist on tour with some rehearsals and interviews thrown in, they should have done one in vein of the two Elvis documentaries ( ""That's The Way It Is"" and ""Elvis On Tour"" ), both of which featured some intervieews and rehearsal footage but mainly focused on Elvis's stage performances.Still, the complete performances that are featured actually make up for all the dvd's many flaws, particuarly ""Fun Fun Fun"", ""Barbara Ann"", his Carl Wilson tribute ""Lay Down Burden"" and ""God Only Knows"" ( also dedicated to Carl ). However, if you want to hear a great Brian Wilson live performance, try the 2001 release ""Live At The Roxy"", which is a two - disc set featuring 30 excellent live tracks ( mostly rare Beach Boys tunes that were never performed in concert before ) plus an exclusive interview with Brian.I don't think this was a terribly bad dvd. It has some truly astonishing live performances and some very funny offstage moments ( including Brian dancing to ""Surfin' Usa"" ). But this dvd should have been a complete concert rather than a documentary.",3,"Good, But Brian's Live Album Is Much Better",1070755200,"12 7, 2003",2003,2455,"['admittedly', 'had', 'very', 'high', 'hopes', 'when', 'purchased', 'dvd', 'store', 'New', 'Jersey', 'sat', 'whole', 'thing', 'ended', 'up', 'kind', 'unhappy', 'know', ""'m"", 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'lot', 'helpful', 'votes', 'review', 'solely', 'opinion', ""'m"", 'sure', 'few', 'people', 'will', 'agree', 'me.First', 'was', 'expecting', 'full', 'blown', 'concert', 'dvd', 'superior', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'Good', 'Timin', 'Live', 'Knebowrth', 'featured', 'low', 'profile', 'Brian', 'worst', 'rest', 'band', 'gave', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'performance', 'Instead', 'documentary', 'featuring', 'less', 'handful', 'complete', 'live', 'performances', 'even', 'rehearsal', 'footage', 'songs', 'are', 'butchered', 'mere', 'snippets', 'was', 'also', 'looking', 'forward', 'hear', 'Brian', 'perform', 'Vegetables', 'concert', 'thought', 'thsi', 'song', 'was', 'so', 'complex', 'produced', 'nobody', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'concert', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'hearing', 'how', 'Brian', 'did', 'Imagine', 'frustation', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'shown', 'brief', 'capella', 'performance', 'Vegas', 'hotel', 'lobby', 'was', 'also', 'mad', 'favorite', 'song', 'Brian', 'sang', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Worry', 'Baby', 'performed', 'joke', 'brain', 'dressing', 'room', 'Ronnie', 'Spector', 'new', 'song', 'dvd', 'Saturday', 'Morning', 'City', 'just', 'Brian', 'piano', 'singing', '30', 'secodn', 'recognition', 'song', 'How', 'money', 'really', 'wanted', 'make', 'documentary', 'artist', 'tour', 'rehearsals', 'interviews', 'thrown', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'one', 'vein', 'two', 'Elvis', 'documentaries', 'Way', 'Elvis', 'Tour', 'featured', 'intervieews', 'rehearsal', 'footage', 'mainly', 'focused', 'Elvis', 'stage', 'performances.Still', 'complete', 'performances', 'are', 'featured', 'actually', 'make', 'up', 'dvd', 'many', 'flaws', 'particuarly', 'Fun', 'Fun', 'Fun', 'Barbara', 'Ann', 'Carl', 'Wilson', 'tribute', 'Lay', 'Down', 'Burden', 'God', 'Only', 'also', 'dedicated', 'Carl', 'However', 'want', 'hear', 'great', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'live', 'performance', 'try', '2001', 'release', 'Live', 'Roxy', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'featuring', '30', 'excellent', 'live', 'tracks', 'mostly', 'rare', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'tunes', 'were', 'never', 'performed', 'concert', 'exclusive', 'interview', 'Brian.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'terribly', 'bad', 'dvd', 'truly', 'astonishing', 'live', 'performances', 'very', 'funny', 'offstage', 'moments', 'including', 'Brian', 'dancing', 'Surfin', 'Usa', 'dvd', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'complete', 'concert', 'rather', 'documentary']",N/A

Huntington,"[1, 1]","I was greatly disappointed to find that I can't share this video with all company to my house, especially the kiddies, due to the occasional profanity.  Brian Wilson uses the F word once as does Ronnie Spector, and Brian uses ""Go##ammit"" once.  I think Brian uses bad judgement to include the profanity on this DVD, as I really doubt if the use of profanity is going to add to anyone's impression of him or his DVD, but the profanity and R rating will exclude it from being marketed in the WalMart stores, so he loses a potentially big market there.But the performances and sound are awesome.  Brian adds more vocal harmonies and really takes his songs to another level, its just mind blowing.
