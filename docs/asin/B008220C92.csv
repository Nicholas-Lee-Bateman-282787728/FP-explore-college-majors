Since the opening scene, the way the front of the house is presented to us, screams something very dark is going to happen. The acting is great, specially by the 'family man' (the novel writer) who knows how to transmit suspense more often than not. Very good actor choice to perform the writer character.After seen so much horror garbage out of Hollywood, where either one knows right away what is going to happen next, or rather than be scared, one leave the theater laughing at the silly script/poor acting, well, this is a very refreshing movie in the sense that it let us know that still there is talent left to impress us big time.",5,So good that I would love to watch it again!,1362182400,"03 2, 2013",2013,1000,"['been', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'horror', 'movie', 'this.Just', 'watched', 'film', 'confirmed', 'what', 'know', 'gallons', 'blood', 'weird', 'monsters', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'scary', 'keep', 'audience', 'so', 'interested', 'movie.Some', 'things', 'really', 'enjoy', 'way', 'camera', 'opening', 'scene', 'way', 'front', 'house', 'presented', 'something', 'very', 'dark', 'going', 'happen', 'acting', 'great', 'specially', ""'family"", 'man', 'novel', 'writer', 'who', 'how', 'transmit', 'suspense', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'Very', 'good', 'actor', 'choice', 'perform', 'writer', 'character.After', 'seen', 'so', 'much', 'horror', 'garbage', 'Hollywood', 'where', 'one', 'knows', 'right', 'away', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'rather', 'be', 'scared', 'one', 'leave', 'theater', 'laughing', 'silly', 'script/poor', 'acting', 'well', 'very', 'refreshing', 'movie', 'sense', 'let', 'know', 'still', 'talent', 'left', 'impress', 'big', 'time']",N/A

That's in part what makes this movie so foreboding and dark.  Okay, so the truth behind the murders in this movie is a bit farfetched, but it's a MOVIE.  So was Frankenstein, the Wolfman, etc. but that didn't keep people from being creeped out by the sheer thought of the possibility of something like that happening.  Any situation where innocence is turned into something sinister (no pun intended) is always disturbing, and that's what makes this movie engaging.  I think it was well done and qualifies as a good, solid &#34;scary movie&#34; if that's what you're looking for.  It's amusing when reviewers tell everyone how mediocre a movie is because the ending was predictable.  Well, if you sit there and think about it as though you were Sherlock Holmes instead of letting yourself be entertained, you can figure out any number of endings to any movie.  There's no challenge in that, so nobody is really impressed by their self-proclaimed acumen.  Apparently some people don't know how to sit back and let themselves be entertained through that wonderful little mind trick called suspension of disbelief.

I too found myself wondering why doesn't anyone turn on a light. Also made no sense that the entity haunted the family at one house only to wait to kill them in their other home. What weird switch was flipped there just because of a move from one building to another? There also was no inclination that the youngest child was being corrupted in anyway. If pictures were a portal, when did she see them? Most of the movie was spent showing grainy and graphic murder scenes on home movies. The wife was oblivious that she was living in a murder house. Really? With today's technology there's no way she couldn't have known about such a horrid thing unless she was living under a rock.All this I could've overlooked and would have had it not been for the ending of this movie. I really wanted to like this movie and it could've been really good. The story had so many other directions it could've taken but it stuck to what I figured was going to happen 2/3 of the way through. It could've been a creepy and intellectual thriller say had the villain turned out to be an actual serial killer or cult doing the murdering or even if had the local sheriff been in a little more on the sinister things going on than anyone realized. There were so many routes the plot could've gone. Instead it chose to have an entity hypnotize children to kill their families so the entity could then have the child for dinner. Thank you but no thank you. The ending made me sick. I find the idea of children murdering their own families then being eaten by some supernatural being sick not scary.

The fear is a different one then you might be used to. It's the fear of fading into obscurity, and the lengths someone will go to, to avoid this. The film shows a defiance of logic, to prevent the fade. Peppered throughout the film, are suspenseful moments, and some quirky characters. The movie is wonderfully shot, and lit. At times you will be peering into the darkness to see if you can make out the antagonist. The Super 8 footage looks awesome as well. I can't recommend this movie highly enough. If you have to see a horror movie in theaters go see this! It's an ORIGINAL movie! And at the end of the day isn't that better than seeing the 4th film in a franchise where someone will inevitably stand over someones bed? I tried to be spoiler free. After a long time a really good horror movie has arrived. Sinister was smart, unpredictable and scary. It also the right mix of gore and supernatural thrills.

1543387,AG5XM49AZVIYH,B008220C92,"Ben ""Pizza Enthusiast""","[1, 1]","As a horror aficionado, I find that I rarely enjoy the critically acclaimed films that seem to terrify everyone else. They always have the visuals, the lighting, and the acting to get it done, but they frequently lack good writing. At the same time, most of the lower budget, under-the-radar horror flicks I enjoy are intelligently written but just don't have the visuals or the acting to back it up (and let me be clear- by ""visuals"" I do NOT mean CGI).Sinister is one of those rare horror films that combines the best qualities from both realms.Beginning with a chilling super-8 reel of a gruesome murder, Sinister puts the viewer on edge from the start. This is a film that does not waste its time easing anyone into the atmosphere of a horror film; it hits its viewers with a substantial amount of dark material right away, and the initial build-up is chilling. Indeed, the first hour of the film is exceptional. Rather than relying on jump-scares or gore, Sinister utilizes disturbing imagery and subtle face-in-the-background shots to create an aura of fear. Very rarely am I so impressed by the beginning of a horror film.Unfortunately, and for some inexplicable reason, Sinister suffers from the same problem that just about every other Hollywood horror film suffers from: a climax unworthy of the scenes leading up to it. It's difficult for me to elaborate without spoiling anything, so all I will say is that the ending is just too... Hollywood. It was abrupt, and it was way too predictable. In short, it is not how I would have chosen to end the film.Apart from a letdown ending, there are a few silly aspects to the rest of the movie. Ethan Hawke (who provides a superb performance in the lead role) walks around his house at night, terrified, and never once turns on a light. Moreover, the entities he encounters are unnecessarily overused. This was only mildly distracting to me but might bother others more.Despite my minor criticisms, I enjoyed Sinister quite a bit and still highly recommend it to horror fans. As far as ""mainstream"" horror films go, this is one of the better ones I have seen in recent years, and I will likely watch it again in the future.

It was pretty satisfying.As with most horror movies, there were plenty of moments when the characters' actions defied reason. Ethan Hawke, the main character, is a true crime writer who wrote a successful book years ago. His more recent books have been flops, and he's out to score big one more time so he can provide for his family and continue to avoid a 9-to-5 existence. He moves his family to a town where an unexplained disappearance happened and seeks out to find answers ... which are pretty much handed to him in the form of a box of old home movies, which show the ghastly deaths of one family after another. Despite the scary nature of the material, Hawke continues to work alone in the middle of the night, when everything is scariest. And despite having all these death films, which he should turn over to police, he decides to keep them secret and try to use them to expose a heretofore unknown serial killer.The tension ratchets up, and ...

I found one.Sinister tells the story of Ellison Oswalt, a true-crime writer whose best work was ten years ago. In an effort to get his mojo back, he moves his family to a small town in the middle of nowhere to chronicle the murder of four people and the disappearance of the family&#8217;s youngest daughter. And in a move that the local sheriff notes is in &#8220;bad taste,&#8221; he decides to move into the house previously occupied by the murdered family. Did I mention the family was murdered in the back yard, hanged from the branch of a particularly sturdy tree?Things start to go hairy when Ellison discovers a box of Super-8 films in the attic of his home, films that shouldn&#8217;t be there (we are treated to a crime scene photo showing an empty attic). One of the films depicts the murder of the people Ellison is investigating. But when Ellison watches some of the other films in the box&#8212;spanning several decades&#8212;he finds that each one depicts another family, and another murder. But when Ellison makes out the image of the killer in one of the films, that&#8217;s when things take a turn for the worst.I tell you what, this movie is freaky-deaky from the word go. From the very first frame, it&#8217;s go time. I am reminded of the similarly named Insidious, a movie that was wonderfully horrific until the last 15 minutes or so, when it sorta falls apart. This movie doesn&#8217;t fall apart. And the thing is, it almost never lets up. There are very few opportunities to relax. The Super 8 films harken back to Peeping Tom, the excellent 1960 horror film that was so far ahead of its time that it destroyed the director&#8217;s career. But the heart of the movie is purely supernatural and altogether unsettling. The fact that the family dynamic is so well-established only makes it worse. I can honestly say that Sinister is one of the scariest movies I have seen since The Ring.Highly recommended for anyone who loves a good scare.5 StarsBonus: Sinister manages to breathe new life into the jump scare as well. There is one scene where the lead character sees something that makes him jump out of his chair.

It's been years since I've seen a film I simply could not wait to purchase the second it came out on DVD, and Sinister is that new film. The music is something that stood out immediately as terrifying; by far the scariest soundtrack I've heard in a very long time. It adds an extra dose of fright when fright is due.Another positive is the lighting and, to an extent, the setting. The overall look and feel is literally dark, which is fitting for the dark content of the film. The ambience as a whole was very well executed, and matched up perfectly with the plot.The cast's performances were quite good, with Ethan Hawke being especially convincing, although the actress playing his wife did not come across well, and she gains no sympathy for her character. Even though she is continuously &#34;screwed over&#34; by her husband, you really can't feel sorry for her- all you really want is for her to stop whining. The children did very well, as did the other cast members. I love me some V D'Onofrio.The plot is definitely my favorite aspect of the film, as it is more original than nearly any horror film I've seen. Yes, 'original' can flop, but when it doesn't, it's truly a pleasure to watch. I was on the edge of my seat during the length of the film because- and this happens VERY rarely- I honestly had no clue how it would end and I was dying to know what would happen. The storyline just hit all the marks perfectly in my opinion, and I thought it was evident that everyone who worked on this film truly collaborated in every sense of the word. It just came together like the perfect storm for me, evidenced by my ravings to all my friends and family members since I saw it opening weekend (and once more two weeks later. I would have totally gone for view number three, but my husband isn't that big on repetition, though he did love the film). I highly recommend you at least give this a watch.Warning: there are scenes that can be disturbing in this film. There is very little blood and no gore, but there are children in not so nice situations in the movie that can definitely cause a negative reaction in sensitive viewers. However, it isn't graphic, so there are definitely worse movies as far as unpleasantries go. I myself HATE blood and guts, so I would never recommend a movie with any substantial amount of it in its content.",5,Original plot delivers bang for your buck,1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,2424,"['have', 'seen', 'many', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'life', 'top', '5', 'standout', 'been', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'purchase', 'second', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'Sinister', 'new', 'film', 'music', 'something', 'stood', 'out', 'immediately', 'terrifying', 'far', 'scariest', 'soundtrack', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'extra', 'dose', 'fright', 'when', 'fright', 'due.Another', 'positive', 'lighting', 'extent', 'setting', 'overall', 'look', 'feel', 'literally', 'dark', 'fitting', 'dark', 'content', 'film', 'ambience', 'whole', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'executed', 'matched', 'up', 'perfectly', 'plot.The', 'cast', 'performances', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'being', 'especially', 'convincing', 'actress', 'playing', 'wife', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'across', 'well', 'gains', 'sympathy', 'character', 'Even', 'continuously', '34', 'screwed', '34', 'husband', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sorry', 'her-', 'really', 'want', 'stop', 'whining', 'children', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'did', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'love', 'V', ""D'Onofrio.The"", 'plot', 'definitely', 'favorite', 'aspect', 'film', 'more', 'original', 'nearly', 'horror', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Yes', ""'original"", 'can', 'flop', 'when', ""n't"", 'truly', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'length', 'film', 'because-', 'VERY', 'rarely-', 'honestly', 'had', 'clue', 'how', 'would', 'end', 'was', 'dying', 'know', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'storyline', 'just', 'hit', 'marks', 'perfectly', 'opinion', 'thought', 'was', 'evident', 'everyone', 'who', 'worked', 'film', 'truly', 'collaborated', 'sense', 'word', 'just', 'came', 'together', 'perfect', 'storm', 'evidenced', 'ravings', 'friends', 'family', 'members', 'saw', 'opening', 'weekend', 'once', 'more', 'two', 'weeks', 'later', 'would', 'have', 'totally', 'gone', 'view', 'number', 'three', 'husband', ""n't"", 'that', 'big', 'repetition', 'did', 'love', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'least', 'give', 'watch.Warning', 'are', 'scenes', 'can', 'be', 'disturbing', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'blood', 'gore', 'are', 'children', 'not', 'nice', 'situations', 'movie', 'can', 'definitely', 'cause', 'negative', 'reaction', 'sensitive', 'viewers', 'However', ""n't"", 'graphic', 'are', 'definitely', 'worse', 'movies', 'as', 'far', 'unpleasantries', 'go', 'HATE', 'blood', 'guts', 'would', 'never', 'recommend', 'movie', 'substantial', 'amount', 'content']",N/A

1543407,A2983KT3N8FGM0,B008220C92,Calder,"[0, 0]","This film has a slick, polished look that differs greatly from the ""shaky cam"" or ""found film"" branch of the horror genre that likely provided its heaviest influences. It plays like an offshoot of that tradition mixed with elements of kaidan inspired Japanese horror cinema. The cast performances are all handled pretty well, although one might find a handful of scenes a bit over-acted. There are a couple of well-placed and timed shocks. However, overall I found I was increasingly bored by this film. It didn't really break any new ground or try anything very innovative. Some of the background music meant to add dark, creepy undertones was, I thought, increasingly distracting. Make-up and special effects sometimes looked like, well, make-up and special effects. I never felt much of a connection to the characters. For example, Juliet Rylance's character just seemed to appear on screen to yell and argue - albeit with good reason - but she is so poorly conceived as a character she doesn't really generate any sympathy. Ethan Hawke's character lends itself to a disparate comparison to Gregory Peck in The Omen - a driven male lead who, through his own misguided efforts, lands the family in a mess. However, where Peck drew you in and built sympathy for his character and situation, Hawke's character, similar to Rylance's, doesn't generate much sympathy. That ultimately means many viewers will stop caring what happens to him. A couple of other characters felt the same way, and two lesser roles were developed in a stereotypical manner. Hokey or stereotyped characters can work in a tongue-in-cheek film, but this movie seems to be trying very hard to be taken seriously. This adds to an overarching feeling that it all just doesn't come together very well.I was intrigued by the relatively positive critical reviews, but ultimately found little to recommend. If you are undecided, wait for the DVD or Blu-ray release. Much of the film is very dark (too dark, in my opinion) and shot in enclosed interiors. There is nothing that benefits from viewing on the big screen. Younger viewers with little exposure to the genre's long history or those who like predictable, cookie cutter entertainment may find this film enjoyable. I could probably justify giving Sinister two and a half stars out of five, but three just doesn't seem applicable.",2,"A few effective scenes, but ultimately derivative and unsatisfying",1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,2350,"['film', 'slick', 'polished', 'look', 'differs', 'greatly', 'shaky', 'cam', 'found', 'film', 'branch', 'horror', 'genre', 'likely', 'provided', 'heaviest', 'influences', 'offshoot', 'tradition', 'mixed', 'elements', 'kaidan', 'inspired', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'cinema', 'cast', 'performances', 'are', 'handled', 'pretty', 'well', 'one', 'might', 'find', 'handful', 'scenes', 'bit', 'over-acted', 'are', 'couple', 'well-placed', 'timed', 'shocks', 'However', 'overall', 'found', 'was', 'increasingly', 'bored', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'try', 'anything', 'very', 'innovative', 'background', 'music', 'meant', 'add', 'dark', 'creepy', 'undertones', 'was', 'thought', 'increasingly', 'distracting', 'Make-up', 'special', 'effects', 'sometimes', 'looked', 'well', 'make-up', 'special', 'effects', 'never', 'felt', 'much', 'connection', 'characters', 'example', 'Juliet', 'Rylance', 'character', 'just', 'seemed', 'appear', 'screen', 'yell', 'argue', 'good', 'reason', 'so', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'character', ""n't"", 'really', 'generate', 'sympathy', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'character', 'disparate', 'comparison', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Omen', 'driven', 'male', 'lead', 'who', 'own', 'misguided', 'efforts', 'family', 'mess', 'However', 'where', 'Peck', 'drew', 'built', 'sympathy', 'character', 'situation', 'Hawke', 'character', 'similar', 'Rylance', ""n't"", 'generate', 'much', 'sympathy', 'ultimately', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'stop', 'caring', 'what', 'couple', 'other', 'characters', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'two', 'lesser', 'roles', 'were', 'developed', 'stereotypical', 'manner', 'Hokey', 'stereotyped', 'characters', 'can', 'work', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'film', 'movie', 'be', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'overarching', 'feeling', 'just', ""n't"", 'come', 'together', 'very', 'well.I', 'was', 'intrigued', 'relatively', 'positive', 'critical', 'reviews', 'ultimately', 'found', 'little', 'recommend', 'are', 'undecided', 'wait', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'Much', 'film', 'very', 'dark', 'too', 'dark', 'opinion', 'shot', 'enclosed', 'interiors', 'nothing', 'benefits', 'viewing', 'big', 'screen', 'Younger', 'viewers', 'little', 'exposure', 'genre', 'long', 'history', 'who', 'like', 'predictable', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'entertainment', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'could', 'probably', 'justify', 'giving', 'Sinister', 'two', 'half', 'five', 'three', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'applicable']",N/A

""Sinister,"" of course.Now usually, I'm not a fan of the whole found-footage genre.  And I also find films where the main protagonist is an author to be somewhat ""lazy"" -- it's not too hard for a writer to add this type of character since he's lived it himself.  However, the found-footage ""stuff"" is necessary to drive the plot -- and perhaps even a possible theme, discussed below -- and I actually liked the way that Ethan Hawke played the writer character here.  So I think that both of these elements worked.It seems that the director and screenwriter were trying to introduce the following theme:  what we watch truly does affect who we are, and how we think.  While the protagonist is appalled by what he watches, he is also intrigued and drawn in at the same time.  And this in turn drives his behaviour and the outcome of his and his family's life.  If this is true, Hollywood should rethink their current argument that movies and video games have no effect on violence in America.  (Just a little public service announcement for ya'.

Without giving too much away, it has a great premise, both psychological and jump-out-at-you thrills, and the acting was good too.  Some might find the pacing slow, but I found that it nicely built the suspense to the climax.  On the downside I found the scenes a little dark, in the lighting sense.  Even shots in the daylight felt like they were lit with a 20 watt bulb.  I know it's hard to have something jump out of the shadows if there are no shadows but I felt like turning the brightness on the TV up on several occasions just to get out of the perpetual twilight.  The fact that the characters seemed incapable of operating a light switch, even when searching their house at night, seemed excessive.  Avid horror movie watchers will also probably peg the ending, or at least narrow it down to a couple of possibilities before the climax.  Still, it's definitely worth a watch.

If not, you are in for a seriously chilling moment that I won't go into great detail about here.Are you creeped out by creepy, murdering kids every time, no matter how often it's been done in movies?  Yeah, me too.  This one has that in spades.Ethan Hawke does fine work as a ""true crime"" author a few years away from his last successful book.  He moves himself, his wife, son and daughter into a home that happens to be the site of a gruesome murder that also left one child missing (there seems to be a pattern of families being murdered with one child then turning up missing).  Another reason for the move, it should be noted, is the downturn in the family's economic fortunes; they simply cannot afford to live where they had been living or sustain their previous lifestyle.There are echoes of ""The Shining"" as Hawke's character discovers some old Super-8 films in the attic, along with, how convenient, a projector and decides to play them for himself.  What he sees are a series of gruesome murders.  Rather than share them with authorities, he decides to do his own investigation.Things get more and more freaky and end badly.  VERY badly.

It's far more subtly done than some of the other product placements Hollywood has done and the Macbook does actually work as part of the plot, but I can't help but poke a little fun at this fact.Now I bet you're wondering: is this scary? Yes and no. Yes in that there were scenes where I did react, but no in that none of this is really that scary in the long run. Most viewers won't be clutching their pillows tight later on that night after seeing Sinister. A lot of the scares here are of the ""jump scare"" variety, with our supernatural bits leaping out at us from the screen. It's effective with one viewing but it's something that will lose its impact with further watching. What does work here scare-wise is that parts of this are very suitably unsettling, especially as we watch Hawke pretty much come apart at the seams. As the hauntings/supernatural bits continue, Hawke becomes more and more unhinged. As far as gore goes, don't look for it here. There is some gruesomeness via the Super 8 snuff films, but the gorier ones are fairly quickly viewed and it's really fairly light in comparison to the rest of the film. I'll warn you: most of this film does not focus on gore or jump scares. When the film is trying to be scary you have the jump scares. Otherwise the main brunt of this story is more psychological, ultimately being about the slow and possibly inevitable downfall of a guy that puts his work before his family. And I hope you like Ethan Hawke, because he carries the entire movie on his shoulders.Part of why the film worked so well is all due to the soundtrack. The music here is excellently done. It's not the typical orchestra soundtrack you'd get with just about every other movie out there. You have a lot of scenes that are helped out by these pieces of music that are of the discordant variety, complete with ""spooky children talking"" effects. This was honestly the one part of the movie that I absolutely and completely loved. If I watch this again, it'll be to enjoy how well the soundtrack is worked into the movie and how slick it makes so much of the movie feel. It's what pushed my opinion of this film up to four stars. It's not the type of music that you could sit and listen to like you would a soundtrack such as say, the Donnie Darko soundtrack, but it's pretty enjoyable for how different it is.I think that ultimately sums up this movie, is that it's different. Sure, the movie is ultimately one that has been told over and over again in various formats, but the creative team on this tried really hard to give it a different spin. For the most part, it works. There's a good story here and enough of the jump scares to keep most viewers entertained. We're also given enough ""inbetween"" stuff to lessen the tension, although I do think that the movie could have been tightened a little and had maybe about 10 minutes or so taken off. No more than that, though. And the ending? I rather liked it, but I can't go into why without really spoiling anything.Overall, I can easily see this being one of those films that you'll either really like or you'll really hate. It's going to be something that'll get a cult following and is also one of those ""artsy"" horror films that tries to straddle mainstream and indie. I honestly do recommend it at least once. I'm not sure that I'd really watch it again with the same level of attention, but I can say that I enjoyed the ride.",4,When bad things happen to Apple users,1350691200,"10 20, 2012",2012,3502,"['could', ""n't"", 'help', 'title', 'given', 'high', 'visibility', 'Apple', 'products', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'subtly', 'done', 'other', 'product', 'placements', 'Hollywood', 'done', 'Macbook', 'actually', 'work', 'part', 'plot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'poke', 'little', 'fun', 'fact.Now', 'bet', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'scary', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'were', 'scenes', 'where', 'did', 'react', 'none', 'really', 'scary', 'long', 'run', 'Most', 'viewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'clutching', 'pillows', 'tight', 'later', 'night', 'seeing', 'Sinister', 'lot', 'scares', 'here', 'are', 'jump', 'scare', 'variety', 'supernatural', 'bits', 'leaping', 'out', 'screen', 'effective', 'one', 'viewing', 'something', 'will', 'lose', 'impact', 'further', 'watching', 'What', 'work', 'here', 'scare-wise', 'parts', 'are', 'very', 'suitably', 'unsettling', 'especially', 'watch', 'Hawke', 'pretty', 'much', 'come', 'apart', 'seams', 'hauntings/supernatural', 'bits', 'continue', 'Hawke', 'more', 'more', 'unhinged', 'As', 'far', 'gore', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'here', 'gruesomeness', 'Super', '8', 'snuff', 'films', 'gorier', 'ones', 'are', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'viewed', 'really', 'fairly', 'light', 'comparison', 'rest', 'film', ""'ll"", 'warn', 'most', 'film', 'not', 'focus', 'gore', 'jump', 'scares', 'When', 'film', 'trying', 'be', 'scary', 'have', 'jump', 'scares', 'Otherwise', 'main', 'brunt', 'story', 'more', 'psychological', 'ultimately', 'being', 'slow', 'possibly', 'inevitable', 'downfall', 'guy', 'work', 'family', 'hope', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'entire', 'movie', 'shoulders.Part', 'why', 'film', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'due', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'here', 'excellently', 'done', 'not', 'typical', 'orchestra', 'soundtrack', ""'d"", 'get', 'just', 'other', 'movie', 'there', 'have', 'lot', 'scenes', 'are', 'helped', 'out', 'pieces', 'music', 'are', 'discordant', 'variety', 'complete', 'spooky', 'children', 'talking', 'effects', 'was', 'honestly', 'one', 'part', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'completely', 'loved', 'watch', 'again', ""'ll"", 'be', 'enjoy', 'how', 'well', 'soundtrack', 'worked', 'movie', 'how', 'slick', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'feel', 'what', 'pushed', 'opinion', 'film', 'up', 'four', 'stars', 'not', 'type', 'music', 'could', 'sit', 'listen', 'would', 'soundtrack', 'such', 'say', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'soundtrack', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'how', 'different', 'think', 'ultimately', 'sums', 'up', 'movie', 'different', 'Sure', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'one', 'been', 'told', 'over', 'again', 'various', 'formats', 'creative', 'team', 'tried', 'really', 'hard', 'give', 'different', 'spin', 'most', 'part', 'good', 'story', 'here', 'enough', 'jump', 'keep', 'most', 'viewers', 'entertained', ""'re"", 'also', 'given', 'enough', 'inbetween', 'stuff', 'lessen', 'tension', 'do', 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tightened', 'little', 'had', 'maybe', '10', 'minutes', 'so', 'taken', 'off', 'No', 'more', 'though', 'ending', 'rather', 'liked', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'why', 'really', 'spoiling', 'anything.Overall', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'being', 'one', 'films', ""'ll"", 'either', 'really', ""'ll"", 'really', 'hate', 'going', 'be', 'something', ""'ll"", 'get', 'cult', 'following', 'also', 'one', 'artsy', 'horror', 'films', 'straddle', 'mainstream', 'indie', 'honestly', 'do', 'recommend', 'least', 'once', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'d"", 'really', 'watch', 'again', 'same', 'level', 'attention', 'can', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'ride']",N/A

1543426,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B008220C92,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[1, 2]","Much to my enormous pleasure, I viewed the 2012 horror film ""Sinister"" and discovered one of the great works of a venerable genre. It's a masterpiece, and certainly the best horror film since the 2007 classicThe Mist. I like to think I'm a horror film expert. There was a Friday night ""late show"" in Dallas during the 1970s, and I had the good fortune to watch an endless run of classic Universal horror films. Traveling through a sea of black and white, I marveled toFrankenstein (1931),Dracula (1931), ""The Wolf Man,"" ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" -- you name it. I've avoided the torture porn of recent years, as true horror must have a dose of the supernatural. I lovedThe Blair Witch Project, though hated the imitators.Film critics have not been kind to ""Sinister."" A queasy lot, they almost always miss the boat when it comes to great horror. Like British ghost stories of the 19th century, subtle skill is necessary to pull off the tale, and ""Sinister"" has achieved its plateaus with unexpected success. The most important key is a good cast. Ethan Hawke, Juliet Rylance, Fred Dalton Thompson, Vincent D'Ornofrio and James Ransone are an unusually talented team. Hawke especially gives a near-brilliant effort as a tortured writer possessed by the compulsion of solving a mystery.The set-up is a marvel, as Hawke plays true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt. Like Ann Rule before him, he travels to towns of notorious crimes to investigate details for his latest book. Oswalt has stumbled of late, as finances are tight, and he needs a bestseller. From desperation comes risk. Unknown to his wife and two children, he's purchased the isolated home where an entire family hung themselves from a backyard tree. In a splendid early scene, the local sheriff (Thompson) frowns on Oswalt's family as they move into the house. Familiar with the author, he says simply, ""I want you to know this is in bad taste,"" a classic line. Mrs. Dudley, the infamous caretaker ofThe Haunting, could not have set up a more uncomfortable atmosphere.I love the house, a common brick structure likely built in the 1960s. It's just modern enough to lack menace, with no hanging shutters or boarded windows. Towering pines surround the property, making the living room dark even at midday. Hallways stretch for miles, as they usually do in an empty house, and there's an attic. Oswalt prefers to work at night as the subject matter he's investigating is inappropriate for his young children. There are bangs and creaks throughout the structure, later explained in terrifying detail. In the darkest corner of the attic he discovers 8mm home movies and a projector. His investigation evolves as the dusty films detail the family's murders. In the tradition of Thomas in Michelangelo Antonioni's 1966 classicBlow Up, he must blow up frames from the footage to reveal clues in the hazy background.That's as far as I'm going, as the mystery evolves with unbearable tension. We like Oswalt, his sympathetic wife Tracy (well played by theater veteran Rylance) and his clever kids. This is a good, Bohemian family. Like Rosemary Woodhouse, Eleanor Lance, Robert Thorn and Father Karras before them, we want to protect these decent people from the growing evil engulfing their lives. The triumph of ""Sinister"" is we genuinely like the characters and care about their safety.Director Scott Derrickson has evolved and ""Sinister"" is his most assured work. He gave us the the surprisingly goodThe Exorcism of Emily Rose (+ BD Live) [Blu-ray], though followed with the crappy remakeThe Day the Earth Stood Still (2008). ""Sinister"" is an example of his maturation and growing expertise within the medium. His screenplay, co-written with C. Robert Cargill, is ingenious. Having read quite a few true crime novels, I've often wondered if such authors as Rule, Vincent Bugliosi and John Douglas have felt a moment's guilt for making a living off the terrible fate of others. Has such investigation opened the door to unknown evils? Are they haunted by the figurative ghosts of the victims, hovering above their typewriters, perhaps exposing a disturbing thread connecting all unexpected horrors of life?I once worked in a Texas town where a husband killed his wife in a newly built home. A young couple soon moved into the same house and, a year later, the husband killed his wife in the front yard. The cosmic coincidence caused the house to remain unoccupied for years. It's a common enough suburban structure, residing on a block without the slightest clue of menace (sort of like that house inPoltergeist). But I wouldn't spend a single night in such a place. Like the house in ""Sinister,"" it stands alone, its doors better left forever locked.",5,Doors better left forever locked...,1362009600,"02 28, 2013",2013,4704,"['Much', 'enormous', 'pleasure',

1543429,A1JZZLIVXGJSIB,B008220C92,CinemaMinor,"[2, 3]","Disclaimer: I've loved Ethan Hawke since ""Dead Poets Sociey.""  But I'm also a huge horror movie fan so would have seen ""Sinister"" regardless of his starring role.  As others have commented -- and as I comment in all my reviews of horror movies -- the bar has been set pretty low for horror flicks in the past few years, and I've wondered if all the good material has been used up.  ""Sinister"" does borrow a lot from other films; most notably it borrows its central theme from ""The Shining.""  Hawke plays a true crime writer (in real life he is a writer in addition to an actor, which added something to the movie for me), looking to reclaim the glory of his past success.  He's also a husband and father who has obligations which compete with his career aspirations.  Although his character, Ellison Oswalt, is a much better father than Jack Nicholson's character in ""The Shining,"" there is definitely a comparison to be made here in terms of men feeling like their wife and kids are weighing them down a bit.  There's also a found footage aspect which is central to the plot, and a kind of, sort of haunted house they're living in where the family Ellison is writing about was murdered.  For all of its tried and true plot points, I will say that for the first time in a long time while watching a horror movie, I wasn't able to figure out the ending until it ended -- which I consider to be a huge plus.However I'm not sure if my inability to guess the culmination of events didn't have something to do with the film's odd pacing.  I felt like it started in the middle of the first act...there was very little scene setting...we're in the thick of things pretty much from the get go.  And then when I thought I was at the end of the second act, it turned out I was in the middle of the third -- there's a sudden, rapid acceleration of the plot that's kind of jarring. On a positive note, this was a refreshing change from movies that go on and on.What does happen in ""Sinister?""  Actually, not much.  Most of the movie takes place in and on the grounds of the murder victims' house -- we frequently see their murder scene replayed throughout the movie (in fact, this is the first image we see).  Ellison spends most of the time in his home office watching old Super 8 films he found in the creepy attic that depict homicides of additional families in other locations.  We're supposed to believe that Ellison's desire for another best seller keeps him from turning this footage over to the authorities.  As he investigates the murders spooky things happen in the house, he uncovers a few details that shed some light on the situation, yadda yadda yadda, I don't like to give too much away.The key here is ""supposed to believe,"" and a lot of Ellison's actions in the movie aren't believable, but Hawke's acting is, thereby redeeming the weak plotting (other reviewers say this too).  Another thing that at least one other reviewer commented on is that the lights in the house are always off; one of the first scenes is the family eating dinner together in the near dark.  This did add a lot to the creepy feeling of the movie, but it was also disctracting as every time I saw a light switch in the background I wanted to scream, ""Turn on the lights!"" at my TV.  There is a scene where a law enforcement officer whose character resembles Dewey from the ""Scream"" franchise says something to Ellison along the lines of, ""If I lived in this house I'd sleep with the lights on,"" and it perhaps came off as more comical than it should have.I still found the movie to be effective because it doesn't give itself away and the found footage is disturbing without being gross -- although this movie is certainly not suitable for kids or anyone with delicate sensibilities and overall, the movie is perhaps beyond disturbing (but you have to get to the end to find out how much so).  I watched it yesterday and am still a little creeped out.  I like it better the day after than I did while I was watching it...although I certainly didn't want to fast forward...which for a horror movie these days is definitely not a bad thing.",4,Nothing new...yet still sets itself apart,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,4117,"['Disclaimer', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Sociey', ""'m"", 'also', 'huge', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'Sinister', 'regardless', 'starring', 'role', 'others', 'have', 'commented', 'comment', 'reviews', 'horror', 'movies', 'bar', 'been', 'set', 'pretty', 'low', 'horror', 'flicks', 'past', 'few', 'years', ""'ve"", 'wondered', 'good', 'material', 'been', 'used', 'up', 'Sinister', 'borrow', 'lot', 'other', 'films', 'most', 'notably', 'central', 'theme', 'Shining', 'Hawke', 'true', 'crime', 'writer', 'real', 'life', 'writer', 'addition', 'actor', 'added', 'something', 'movie', 'looking', 'reclaim', 'glory', 'past', 'success', 'also', 'husband', 'father', 'who', 'obligations', 'compete', 'career', 'aspirations', 'character', 'Ellison', 'Oswalt', 'much', 'better', 'father', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'Shining', 'definitely', 'comparison', 'be', 'made', 'here', 'terms', 'men', 'feeling', 'wife', 'kids', 'are', 'weighing', 'down', 'bit', 'also', 'found', 'footage', 'aspect', 'central', 'plot', 'kind', 'sort', 'haunted', 'house', ""'re"", 'living', 'where', 'family', 'Ellison', 'writing', 'was', 'murdered', 'tried', 'true', 'plot', 'points', 'will', 'say', 'first', 'time', 'long', 'time', 'watching', 'horror', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'ending', 'ended', 'consider', 'be', 'huge', 'plus.However', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'inability', 'guess', 'culmination', 'events', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'something', 'do', 'film', 'odd', 'pacing', 'felt', 'started', 'middle', 'first', 'act', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'scene', 'setting', ""'re"", 'thick', 'things', 'pretty', 'much', 'get', 'go', 'then', 'when', 'thought', 'was', 'end', 'second', 'act', 'turned', 'out', 'was', 'middle', 'third', 'sudden', 'rapid', 'acceleration', 'plot', 'kind', 'jarring', 'positive', 'note', 'was', 'refreshing', 'change', 'movies', 'go', 'on.What', 'happen', 'Sinister', 'Actually', 'not', 'much', 'Most', 'movie', 'place', 'grounds', 'murder', 'victims', 'house', 'frequently', 'see', 'murder', 'scene', 'replayed', 'movie', 'fact', 'first', 'image', 'see', 'Ellison', 'most', 'time', 'home', 'office', 'watching', 'old', 'Super', '8', 'films', 'found', 'creepy', 'attic', 'depict', 'homicides', 'additional', 'families', 'other', 'locations', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'Ellison', 'desire', 'best', 'seller', 'keeps', 'turning', 'footage', 'authorities', 'murders', 'spooky', 'things', 'happen', 'house', 'few', 'details', 'shed', 'light', 'situation', 'yadda', 'yadda', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'key', 'here', 'supposed', 'believe', 'lot', 'Ellison', 'actions', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'believable', 'Hawke', 'acting', 'thereby', 'redeeming', 'weak', 'plotting', 'other', 'reviewers', 'say', 'too', 'thing', 'least', 'one', 'other', 'reviewer', 'commented', 'lights', 'house', 'are', 'always', 'one', 'first', 'scenes', 'family', 'eating', 'dinner', 'together', 'near', 'dark', 'did', 'add', 'lot', 'creepy', 'feeling', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'disctracting', 'time', 'saw', 'light', 'switch', 'background', 'wanted', 'scream', 'Turn', 'lights', 'TV', 'scene', 'where', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officer', 'character', 'Dewey', 'Scream', 'franchise', 'something', 'Ellison', 'lines', 'lived', 'house', ""'d"", 'sleep', 'lights', 'perhaps', 'came', 'off', 'more', 'comical', 'should', 'have.I', 'still', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'effective', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'found', 'footage', 'disturbing', 'being', 'gross', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'suitable', 'kids', 'anyone', 'delicate', 'sensibilities', 'overall', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'disturbing', 'have', 'get', 'end', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'much', 'so', 'watched', 'yesterday', 'am', 'still', 'little', 'creeped', 'out', 'like', 'better', 'day', 'did', 'was', 'watching', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'fast', 'forward', 'horror', 'movie', 'days', 'definitely', 'not', 'bad', 'thing']",N/A

The death scenes were downright sickening to watch, along with a hint of ingenuity throughout. At one point, I even told my wife that I wanted to stop watching since I was so afraid.I quickly lost this about 60% of the way in as the movie began to (spoiler alert) signify a more undead or haunted aspect. Also, who hears a noise in their house in the middle of the night, and does not turn on all the lights to see what is going on? Spooky: yes. Realistic: not necessarily. Especially with children in the house.The movie had great potential from the beginning. The premise was fairly original- a crime author who moves into the homes of victims to get the best feel for his new novels. The scares started shortly after with surprising scenes and loud noises that made me jump just about every time. It started to lose me over halfway through, and the ending I didn't particularly care for. Having said this, I did not suspect the actual killer was who it ended up being. Kind of a tricky, possession twist.Do I recommend this movie: Sure. Try it out for a well placed thrill, some well written scenes, cheap scares, and decent acting. Do not get your expectations up for the end. I felt it built right up simply to fall kind of flat.

Sawin,"[7, 10]","Out of all the films labeled as horror to be released this year, not many (if any at all) have actually had bite to them or have offered authentic scared. As incredible as ""The Cabin in the Woods"" was, it was how the film messed with your head and it's completely epic mind-warping conclusion that made it so memorable. Most PG-13 fare like ""The Woman in Black"" or ""House at the End of the Street"" relied on nothing but jump out scares while R-rated horror like ""Piranha 3DD"" and ""Chernobyl Diaries"" are just poorly written all around and awful however you try to look at them.Thankfully ""Sinister"" can be categorized with your favorites from throughout the year. One of the ways it's able to accomplish that is how it utilizes sound in addition to its visuals to attempt to creep you out. The more senses a horror film is able to play with and manipulate properly to put you that much closer to the edge of your seat, the better that particular film turns out to be. What you hear in ""Sinister"" and the way those sounds seem like they're coming from all around you makes the events that unfold throughout the film all the more terrifying.Such heavy use of sound effects actually contributes to the film's incredibly glowing reputation. The encompassing creaks of the house of the Oswalt family are almost overwhelming at times because you can never quite pinpoint where they're coming from and the score is just as paralyzing. The music is very unusual as it's typically a pulsating rhythm with a ton of bass, the sounds of super 8 film reaching the end of its track, or various sounds that appear to be out of tune and/or played backwards. These noises almost seem like they shouldn't be strung together to make the score of a film since they're just sounds and noise, but the score is successfully rattling and is really unnerving.The emphasis on the super 8 projector and home movies comes off very well. Seeing Ellison (Ethan Hawke) prepare each film or seeing the horrors he witnesses in the darkness of his office in the reflection of his glasses is grotesquely mesmerizing. ""Sinister"" finds a way to make the concept of playing a super 8 film compelling every time that projector is turned on. The use of dynamic perspectives, the close-ups of the lens of the camera or the on/off switch of the projector, and the scene where Ellison falls asleep on the couch with a bat in his lap as the sun rises are just a few examples of how glorious the cinematography is.Aside from the super 8 films, the menacing figure of Bughuul/Mr. Boogie that appears in each film has one of the most unique concepts to be put into a horror film of recent memory. Hearing his origins for yourself is part of the film's macabre charm, but just embrace the fact that there are still horror movies out there that are trying to do something different and original.The one thing that ""Sinister"" doesn't necessarily do wrong, but may not sit right with a lot of people is revolve so heavily around children. Their inclusion works perfectly, but their involvement feels overused and a bit silly by the time the film's conclusion rolls around. Whether you're a fan of evil children in horror to begin with may play a factor in that though. The problem with that is that getting rid of that aspect of the film would also rob you one of the defining moments of the film, so it's kind of a catch-22 situation.""Sinister"" does for home movies what ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" did for nightmares. The combination of an extremely well-edited film along with a score that immediately puts the hairs on your arms on end and sound effects that make your spine tingle completely envelopes you in this cocoon of anxiety. Many horror films fall apart once their origins are explained, but ""Sinister"" only seems to flourish on the fact that its explanations only make the final product more frightening. With a magnificent performance from Ethan Hawke, ""Sinister"" provides the authentic scares the horror junkie in you has been craving all year long.",4,The most terrifying film of the year,1350000000,"10 12, 2012",2012,4014,"['films', 'labeled', 'horror', 'be', 'released', 'year', 'not', 'many', 'have', 'actually', 'had', 'bite', 'have', 'offered', 'authentic', 'scared', 'As', 'incredible', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'was', 'was', 'how', 'film', 'messed', 'head', 'completely', 'epic', 'mind-warping', 'conclusion', 'made', 'so', 'memorable', 'Most', 'PG-13', 'fare', 'Woman', 'Black', 'House', 'End', 'Street', 'relied', 'nothing', 'jump', 'out', 'scares', 'R-rated', 'horror', 'Piranha', '3DD', 'Chernobyl', 'Diaries', 'are', 'just', 'poorly', 'written', 'around', 'awful', 'however', 'try', 'look', 'them.Thankfully', 'Sinister', 'can', 'be', 'categorized', 'favorites', 'year', 'One', 'ways', 'able', 'accomplish', 'how', 'sound', 'addition', 'visuals', 'attempt', 'creep', 'out', 'more', 'senses', 'horror', 'film', 'able', 'play', 'manipulate', 'properly', 'put', 'much', 'closer', 'edge', 'seat', 'better', 'particular', 'film', 'out', 'be', 'What', 'hear', 'Sinister', 'way', 'sounds', 'seem', ""'re"", 'coming', 'events', 'unfold', 'film', 'more', 'terrifying.Such', 'heavy', 'use', 'sound', 'effects', 'actually', 'film', 'incredibly', 'glowing', 'reputation', 'encompassing', 'creaks', 'house', 'Oswalt', 'family', 'are', 'almost', 'overwhelming', 'times', 'can', 'never', 'quite', 'pinpoint', 'where', ""'re"", 'coming', 'score', 'just', 'paralyzing', 'music', 'very', 'unusual', 'typically', 'pulsating', 'rhythm', 'ton', 'bass', 'sounds', 'super', '8', 'film', 'reaching', 'end', 'track', 'various', 'sounds', 'appear', 'be', 'tune', 'and/or', 'played', 'backwards', 'noises', 'almost', 'seem', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'strung', 'together', 'make', 'score', 'film', ""'re"", 'just', 'sounds', 'noise', 'score', 'successfully', 'rattling', 'really', 'unnerving.The', 'emphasis', 'super', '8', 'projector', 'home', 'movies', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'Seeing', 'Ellison', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'prepare', 'film', 'seeing', 'horrors', 'darkness', 'office', 'reflection', 'glasses', 'grotesquely', 'mesmerizing', 'Sinister', 'way', 'make', 'concept', 'playing', 'super', '8', 'film', 'compelling', 'time', 'projector', 'turned', 'use', 'dynamic', 'perspectives', 'close-ups', 'lens', 'camera', 'on/off', 'switch', 'projector', 'scene', 'where', 'Ellison', 'asleep', 'couch', 'bat', 'lap', 'sun', 'rises', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'examples', 'how', 'glorious', 'cinematography', 'is.Aside', 'super', '8', 'films', 'menacing', 'figure', 'Bughuul/Mr', 'Boogie', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'concepts', 'be', 'put', 'horror', 'film', 'recent', 'memory', 'Hearing', 'origins', 'part', 'film', 'macabre', 'charm', 'just', 'embrace', 'fact', 'are', 'still', 'horror', 'movies', 'there', 'are', 'trying', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'original.The', 'one', 'thing', 'Sinister', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'do', 'wrong', 'may', 'not', 'sit', 'right', 'lot', 'people', 'revolve', 'so', 'heavily', 'children', 'inclusion', 'perfectly', 'involvement', 'feels', 'overused', 'bit', 'silly', 'time', 'film', 'conclusion', 'rolls', 'Whether', ""'re"", 'fan', 'evil', 'children', 'horror', 'begin', 'may', 'play', 'factor', 'though', 'problem', 'getting', 'rid', 'aspect', 'film', 'would', 'also', 'rob', 'one', 'defining', 'moments', 'film', 'kind', 'catch-22', 'situation', 'Sinister', 'home', 'movies', 'what', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'did', 'nightmares', 'combination', 'extremely', 'well-edited', 'film', 'score', 'immediately', 'hairs', 'arms', 'end', 'sound', 'effects', 'make', 'spine', 'tingle', 'completely', 'cocoon', 'anxiety', 'Many', 'horror', 'films', 'fall', 'apart', 'once', 'origins', 'are', 'explained', 'Sinister', 'only', 'flourish', 'fact', 'explanations', 'only', 'make', 'final', 'product', 'more', 'frightening', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Sinister', 'authentic', 'horror', 'junkie', 'been', 'craving', 'year', 'long']",N/A
1543440,A1CHGDG3NUDA5R,B008220C92,"C. Seggelin ""Plastered Dragon""","[17, 26]","I was hooked into streaming this film by the trailer.  I do like Ethan Hawke, and even though this film was coming from the creators of that abysmal dreck ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"", I wanted to give it a chance.  It cost $3.99 to stream on Amazon, and almost certainly is not worth that much.  This is a $1 rental at best folks.  Better yet wait a year and it will be streaming for free--trust me you aren't missing anything.Ignoring for a moment the obviousness of the story, and how easy it is to figure out where it's going before it gets there, the ending is utterly anticlimactic and rushed in a way that is particularly annoying after the 100 minutes of buildup.  I'm sure most people wanted to see Ethan's character fight ""Mister Boogie"" in some way--even if he lost.  No such luck--instead the director was counting on shocking you with the banal twist ending that you figured out sixty minutes earlier.  Since that failed utterly, the ending is just a let-down.The movie tries to use jump-scares and loud noises to frighten you, but the repetition left me cold.  It's scary when Ethan walks down a hallway and a ghostly child appears behind him.  It's not scary when it happens five times.  In a row.  Overdoing the scares makes them boring instead of scary.  ""And now a weird noise"" is not something you should be thinking right before the director tries to scare you with a weird noise.The characters behave in mind-numbingly stupid ways.  Hawke wanders around his house carrying a baseball bat at night because he hears someone moving around... and walks past light switch after light switch without ever flipping one on.  Ever.  There is no way any sane thinking person wouldn't flip on each and every single light in his situation.  Which means he is deliberately not doing it because it wouldn't be ""spooky"" with the lights on.  Which makes the whole thing feel contrived and destroys the tension.Finally, the whole film is shot too damned dark.  You can't see anything half the time.  This doesn't add to the tension or the fear, although it may have you frustratedly checking to see how much more time you are going to have to spend watching this train wreck.In short, the only frightening thing about this picture is that it probably won't be Scott Derrickson's last.Do yourself a favor, skip this film.",1,"Scott Derrickson's ""Sinister"" Is A Steaming Pile",1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,2324,"['was', 'hooked', 'streaming', 'film', 'trailer', 'do', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'even', 'film', 'was', 'coming', 'creators', 'abysmal', 'dreck', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'wanted', 'give', 'chance', 'cost', '3.99', 'stream', 'Amazon', 'almost', 'certainly', 'not', 'worth', 'much', '1', 'rental', 'best', 'folks', 'Better', 'yet', 'wait', 'year', 'will', 'be', 'streaming', 'free', 'trust', 'are', ""n't"", 'missing', 'anything.Ignoring', 'moment', 'obviousness', 'story', 'how', 'easy', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'going', 'there', 'ending', 'utterly', 'anticlimactic', 'rushed', 'way', 'particularly', 'annoying', '100', 'minutes', 'buildup', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'people', 'wanted', 'see', 'Ethan', 'character', 'fight', 'Mister', 'Boogie', 'way', 'even', 'lost', 'such', 'luck', 'instead', 'director', 'was', 'counting', 'shocking', 'banal', 'twist', 'ending', 'figured', 'out', 'sixty', 'minutes', 'earlier', 'failed', 'utterly', 'ending', 'just', 'let-down.The', 'movie', 'tries', 'use', 'jump-scares', 'loud', 'noises', 'frighten', 'repetition', 'left', 'cold', 'scary', 'when', 'Ethan', 'walks', 'down', 'hallway', 'ghostly', 'child', 'not', 'scary', 'when', 'five', 'times', 'row', 'Overdoing', 'scares', 'boring', 'instead', 'scary', 'now', 'weird', 'noise', 'not', 'something', 'should', 'be', 'thinking', 'right', 'director', 'scare', 'weird', 'noise.The', 'characters', 'behave', 'mind-numbingly', 'stupid', 'ways', 'Hawke', 'wanders', 'house', 'carrying', 'baseball', 'bat', 'night', 'someone', 'moving', 'around', 'walks', 'past', 'light', 'switch', 'light', 'switch', 'ever', 'flipping', 'one', 'Ever', 'way', 'sane', 'thinking', 'person', 'would', ""n't"", 'flip', 'single', 'light', 'situation', 'Which', 'deliberately', 'not', 'doing', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'spooky', 'lights', 'Which', 'whole', 'thing', 'feel', 'contrived', 'tension.Finally', 'whole', 'film', 'shot', 'too', 'damned', 'dark', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'time', ""n't"", 'add', 'tension', 'fear', 'may', 'have', 'frustratedly', 'checking', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'time', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'spend', 'watching', 'train', 'wreck.In', 'short', 'only', 'frightening', 'thing', 'picture', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'Scott', 'Derrickson', 'last.Do', 'favor', 'skip', 'film']",N/A

After the Universal Monsters had all their eerie night in the dark, British sensibilities brought us the Gothic ghost horrors of the fifties and early sixties. Then the late sixties and seventies brought us a slate of movies involving secret satanic rituals and demonic possessions (which reflected real national fears of such societies according to polls at the time). The late seventies and eighties gave birth to the unstoppable killing machine of the slasher flicks and their near infinite variations. The nineties were a period of nostalgic retreads with the only lasting sub genre being the ""found footage"" films that splashed into widespread success with the hit The Blair Witch Project. Currently, Hollywood makes any variation or combination of the above sub genres- possession and found footage films clearly the most popular. Sinister says, ""why not combine all of those genre's into one film."" And it does it well. The film lives off the strength of Ethan Hawke's character, true crime fiction writer Ellison. It contains a powerful and compelling narrative that unfolds with the proper taunt amount of pacing, stronger than most horror films. It has some disturbingly real and grisly visuals unrestrained by its PG-13 rating thanks entirely to clever film making. While no horror movie ever really scares me, those images stuck with me which is a testament to its quality. The ending was telegraphed and the reveal of a certain supernatural element in the climax of the second act seemed technically lacking, but other than that the film is strong. Frankly, its probably one of my top ten horror films of the last decade... at least this week.

My small pet peeves include when people are searching a darkened house and simply refuse to flick on a light switch to see what is going on ( this movie had a case of chronic darkness ).  I know it's for effect, but I just couldn't get around it.  Also, the local deputy was a bit of an inept charicature who ends up delivering more solid information in the movie than anyone else, not sure why they designed him that way.  I enjoyed Ethan Hawke ( although they never give him a wardrobe change ), and it was good to see Fred Thompson and Vincent D'Onofrio included ( albeit uncredited ).The ending did tie is up neatly in a bow, but it's like the whole movie was designed just to deliver the ending, and kind of missed throughout.  The key pieces to the story, the local police's warnings, the son's night terrors, and the girl's 'friend', were all kinda glossed over, which left the substance of the story somewhat light.  Ironically, it is not a short movie, checking in at just under two hours, so I felt there was time to deliver more.The violence itself was graphic and suspensefully delivered, but it wasn't enough to make it genuinely scary.

The wait was well worth it.  ""Sinister"" is a story about a true-crime writer who's researching for his next book.  What he is really searching for is another huge paycheck, television interviews, a possible series--you name it--he's putting all his eggs in one basket.  He moves into the house where four horrible murders took place--all hangings.  He starts to ""dig,"" and he doesn't have to wait very long at all until something ""sinister"" appears.  It seems there were 8mm home movies of previous tragedies (all involving the murders of entire families) waiting for him in his attic.  He watches each film (marked as ""Pool Party"" 1969, ""Camping Trip,"" etc.) and that's when the horror really begins.I am not going to give away anything else about this movie; it's simply too good to ruin for someone.  Ethan Hawke does an exceptional job playing the tormented writer that may have bitten off way more than he could chew in researching materials for his new novel.  The actors portraying his wife and children also give very credible performances.  ""Sinister"" takes its own sweet time in spinning a very captivating and horrifying web for its viewers.

1543477,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B008220C92,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[0, 0]","I've been interested in the work of Director / Writer Scott Derrickson since hearing he was a Christian many years back. I was fascinated to find someone else who shared not only my basic religious beliefs but also had a passion for the horror and science fiction genres I love so much. It's not often you hear of Christians who are successful in Hollywood.Derrickson has an impressive resume of films and actors he's worked with over the years. His early endeavors consist of writing &#34;Urban Legends: Final Cut&#34; and directing and penning &#34;Hellraiser: Inferno.&#34; He moved on to take the helm of &#34;The Day the Earth Stood Still&#34; and &#34;The Exorcism of Emily Rose.&#34; Both of these films starred well-respected actors like Keanu Reeves, Laura Linney, and Tom Wilikinson. His latest film &#34;Sinister&#34; ranks at the top of his filmmaking career.True crime writer Ellison Oswald (Ethan Hawke) gained notoriety ten years ago with a book about a grisly murder. After a couple unsuccessful novels, Oswald is looking to repeat his success and return to the top of the bestseller list. He takes up residence in the home where the victims he's investigating actually lived and were killed.While moving in, he discovers a box of Super 8 movies which hold footage of several brutal murders that he believes somehow tie together. As Oswald digs deeper into each crime, his world begins to crumble around him. Is he losing his sanity or is there a supernatural force out to get him and his family?&#34;Sinister&#34; is the culmination of everything good about several horror sub-genres. You have the &#34;Paranormal Activity&#34; found footage concept covered through the use of the Super 8 films. People who enjoy movies with supernatural entities like the ones in &#34;The Grudge,&#34; &#34;Boogeyman,&#34; and others of that nature will enjoy it. Those who crave modern day ghost stories like &#34;The Pact,&#34; &#34;The Apparition,&#34; and &#34;Insidious&#34; will love it as well. There really is something for every type of horror enthusiast in &#34;Sinister.&#34;The movie isn't a sloppy hodge-podge of those movies, either. Derrickson ties everything together with a script that makes sense and a story that is well-paced and intriguing. It has slow-burning suspense and jump-scares combined together to keep you on the edge of your seat and nervously awaiting the next disturbing scene.Several special features are included in the DVD version of &#34;Sinister.&#34; There are two separate audio commentaries featuring Director / Writer Scott Derrickson and Co-writer C. Robert Cargill. It also contains two featurettes entitled &#34;True Crime Authors&#34; and &#34;Living in a House of Death.&#34; Deleted scenes include optional audio commentary by Director Scott Derrickson. Lastly, we get a trailer for the film.&#34;Sinister&#34; is a satisfying horror film which will appeal to many types of fright fans. It's a successful combination of old and new tricks. When it comes to what we see onscreen, it has more in common with Hitchcock than it does gorier fare like &#34;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&#34; and the likes. Viewers who like a twisty storyline which leaves something for your imagination visually will enjoy &#34;Sinister.&#34;",4,"DVD Review: ""Sinister""",1362096000,"03 1, 2013",2013,3264,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'interested', 'work', 'Director', '/', 'Writer', 'Scott', 'Derrickson', 'hearing', 'was', 'Christian', 'many', 'years', 'back', 'was', 'fascinated', 'find', 'someone', 'else', 'who', 'shared', 'not', 'only', 'basic', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'also', 'had', 'passion', 'horror', 'science', 'fiction', 'genres', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'not', 'often', 'hear', 'Christians', 'who', 'are', 'successful', 'Hollywood.Derrickson', 'impressive', 'resume', 'films', 'actors', 'worked', 'years', 'early', 'endeavors', 'consist', 'writing', '34', 'Urban', 'Final', 'Cut', '34', 'directing', 'penning', '34', 'Hellraiser', 'Inferno.', '34', 'moved', 'take', 'helm', '34', 'Day', 'Earth', 'Stood', 'Still', '34', '34', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose.', '34', 'films', 'starred', 'well-respected', 'actors', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Tom', 'Wilikinson', 'latest', 'film', '34', 'Sinister', '34', 'ranks', 'top', 'filmmaking', 'career.True', 'crime', 'writer', 'Ellison', 'Oswald', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'gained', 'notoriety', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'book', 'grisly', 'murder', 'couple', 'unsuccessful', 'novels', 'Oswald', 'looking', 'repeat', 'success', 'return', 'top', 'bestseller', 'list', 'up', 'residence', 'home', 'where', 'victims', 'investigating', 'actually', 'lived', 'were', 'killed.While', 'moving', 'box', 'Super', '8', 'movies', 'hold', 'footage', 'several', 'brutal', 'murders', 'somehow', 'tie', 'together', 'Oswald', 'deeper', 'crime', 'world', 'crumble', 'around', 'losing', 'sanity', 'supernatural', 'force', 'get', 'family', '34', 'Sinister', '34', 'culmination', 'everything', 'good', 'several', 'horror', 'sub-genres', 'have', '34', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '34', 'found', 'footage', 'concept', 'covered', 'use', 'Super', '8', 'films', 'People', 'who', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'supernatural', 'entities', 'ones', '34', 'Grudge', '34', '34', 'Boogeyman', '34', 'others', 'nature', 'will', 'enjoy', 'who', 'crave', 'modern', 'day', 'ghost', 'stories', '34', 'Pact', '34', '34', 'Apparition', '34', '34', 'Insidious', '34', 'will', 'love', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'something', 'type', 'horror', 'enthusiast', '34', 'Sinister.', '34', 'movie', ""n't"", 'sloppy', 'hodge-podge', 'movies', 'either', 'Derrickson', 'ties', 'everything', 'together', 'script', 'sense', 'story', 'well-paced', 'intriguing', 'slow-burning', 'suspense', 'jump-scares', 'combined', 'together', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'nervously', 'awaiting', 'next', 'disturbing', 'scene.Several', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'included', 'DVD', 'version', '34', 'Sinister.', '34', 'are', 'two', 'separate', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'featuring', 'Director', '/', 'Writer', 'Scott', 'Derrickson', 'Co-writer', 'C.', 'Robert', 'Cargill', 'also', 'two', 'featurettes', 'entitled', '34', 'True', 'Crime', 'Authors', '34', '34', 'Living', 'House', 'Death.', '34', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'include', 'optional', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Scott', 'Derrickson', 'Lastly', 'get', 'trailer', 'film.', '34', 'Sinister', '34', 'satisfying', 'horror', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'many', 'types', 'fright', 'fans', 'successful', 'combination', 'old', 'new', 'tricks', 'When', 'what', 'see', 'onscreen', 'more', 'common', 'Hitchcock', 'gorier', 'fare', '34', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', '34', 'likes', 'Viewers', 'who', 'like', 'twisty', 'storyline', 'something', 'imagination', 'visually', 'will', 'enjoy', '34', 'Sinister.', '34']",N/A
1543478,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B008220C92,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[0, 0]","A crime novelist, Ellison Oswald (Ethan Hawke) moves into a house where several members of a family were brutally murdered and the youngest daughter disappeared. Ellison, trying to revive his now dead writing career, intends to write a book about the murders and has moved into the house for inspiration. His clueless wife, Tracy (Juliet Rylance) and his 2 children, are unaware of their new homes murderous past. Ellison soon discovers a bunch of home movies in his attic, and when he views them, finds out they are all snuff films, spanning several decades. He enlists the help of a local deputy, and a professor who specializes in the occult, to try to make sense of the grisly crimes and to establish the connections between the murders despite years, decades, separating each crimes.This creepy horror tale is at times shocking and disturbing despite having minimal gore on display. It's all in the atmosphere and the gruesome subject matter. Watching people being murdered in horrific ways via a grainy home movie is chilling and the super 8 movies are very well done. The locations are dark, with minimal lighting, no sounds, sometimes grainy and always spooky. Some of the home movies start out charmingly enough, with the luck-less victims having a great time either fishing, at a picnic, hanging around in the swimming pool etc then the footage cuts to some horrible executions. The tale then takes a supernatural twist when Ellison discovers a creepy looking face watching from the depths of a swimming pool in one of the film clips and also notices a strange occult symbol that keeps re-appearing and is discovered to represent a malevolent and mysterious pagan deity.The film is very atmospheric, and many of the shots are in complete darkness and the main character is always walking around looking fearful and paranoid, which adds to the films tone. However, I do wish he would have just turned on some lights and saved us all the grief. Dude, you are investigating a strange noise and carrying a baseball bat for protection, walking through various dark rooms of your creepy house, would it hurt you to turn on a few light switches? Geesh. Despite a very creepy atmosphere, the film does not always get it right and there are one too many jump scares too many. There is one scene that takes it to an absurd level and inspired some laughter from the audience when I watched this at the theatre. I imagine laughter was not what the director was going for and this just proves that you can over-do it. The film is a bit predictable and how many supernatural themed horror films have you seen that involve a child who can sense the evil and draws pictures of the evil yet the parents remain clueless? The pace is also a bit slow. This movie is more psychological so this is expected, but having one actor carry the whole picture may not have been a good idea. Hawke is good, but we get far too many shots of him being shocked, or worried, or bored, or scared, and although I liked the idea of keeping the villain a mystery and not giving it a whole lot of screen time, I would have preferred more of it, and less of the annoying children that kept re-appearing throughout the film.Despite the negatives, ""Sinister"" is a pretty good chiller with good performances, and a lot of tension and atmosphere and although there are a lot of murders being committed, most of it is not shown, just implied or not clear enough to warrant looking away (even so, I have to admit, some of the home movies, as brief as they were, disturbed me to the core). As is typical of today's horror movies, there is a twist ending and the film ends on a high yet disturbing note. With some minor tweaks, ""Sinister"" could have been a whole lot better but it is still a good horror film to watch with the lights off and on Halloween night.3.5 out of 5",3,Sinister is Right.,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,3835,"['crime', 'novelist', 'Ellison', 'Oswald', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'house', 'where', 'several', 'members', 'family', 'were', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'disappeared', 'Ellison', 'trying', 'revive', 'now', 'dead', 'writing', 'career', 'write', 'book', 'murders', 'moved', 'house', 'inspiration', 'clueless', 'wife', 'Tracy', 'Juliet', 'Rylance', '2', 'children', 'are', 'unaware', 'new', 'homes', 'murderous', 'past', 'Ellison', 'soon', 'bunch', 'home', 'movies', 'attic', 'when', 'are', 'snuff', 'films', 'spanning', 'several', 'decades', 'help', 'local', 'deputy', 'professor', 'who', 'occult', 'try', 'make', 'sense', 'grisly', 'crimes', 'establish', 'connections', 'murders', 'years', 'decades', 'separating', 'crimes.This', 'creepy', 'horror', 'tale', 'times', 'shocking', 'disturbing', 'having', 'minimal', 'gore', 'display', 'atmosphere', 'gruesome', 'subject', 'matter', 'Watching', 'people', 'being', 'murdered', 'horrific', 'ways', 'grainy', 'home', 'movie', 'chilling', 'super', '8', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'locations', 'are', 'dark', 'minimal', 'lighting', 'sounds', 'sometimes', 'grainy', 'always', 'spooky', 'home', 'movies', 'start', 'out', 'charmingly', 'enough', 'luck-less', 'victims', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'fishing', 'picnic', 'hanging', 'around', 'swimming', 'pool', 'etc', 'then', 'footage', 'cuts', 'horrible', 'executions', 'tale', 'then', 'supernatural', 'twist', 'when', 'Ellison', 'creepy', 'looking', 'face', 'watching', 'depths', 'swimming', 'pool', 'one', 'film', 'clips', 'also', 'strange', 'occult', 'symbol', 're-appearing', 'discovered', 'represent', 'malevolent', 'mysterious', 'pagan', 'deity.The', 'film', 'very', 'atmospheric', 'many', 'shots', 'are', 'complete', 'darkness', 'main', 'character', 'always', 'walking', 'around', 'looking', 'fearful', 'paranoid', 'films', 'tone', 'However', 'do', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'turned', 'lights', 'saved', 'grief', 'Dude', 'are', 'investigating', 'strange', 'noise', 'carrying', 'baseball', 'bat', 'protection', 'walking', 'various', 'dark', 'rooms', 'creepy', 'house', 'would', 'hurt', 'turn', 'few', 'light', 'switches', 'Geesh', 'very', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'not', 'always', 'get', 'right', 'are', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'jump', 'scares', 'too', 'many', 'one', 'scene', 'absurd', 'level', 'inspired', 'laughter', 'audience', 'when', 'watched', 'theatre', 'imagine', 'laughter', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'director', 'was', 'going', 'just', 'can', 'over-do', 'film', 'bit', 'predictable', 'how', 'many', 'supernatural', 'themed', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'involve', 'child', 'who', 'can', 'sense', 'evil', 'draws', 'pictures', 'evil', 'yet', 'parents', 'remain', 'clueless', 'pace', 'also', 'bit', 'slow', 'movie', 'more', 'psychological', 'expected', 'having', 'one', 'actor', 'carry', 'whole', 'picture', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'idea', 'Hawke', 'good', 'get', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'shots', 'being', 'shocked', 'worried', 'bored', 'scared', 'liked', 'idea', 'keeping', 'villain', 'mystery', 'not', 'giving', 'whole', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'more', 'less', 'annoying', 'children', 'kept', 're-appearing', 'film.Despite', 'negatives', 'Sinister', 'pretty', 'good', 'chiller', 'good', 'performances', 'lot', 'tension', 'atmosphere', 'are', 'lot', 'murders', 'being', 'committed', 'most', 'not', 'shown', 'just', 'implied', 'not', 'clear', 'enough', 'warrant', 'looking', 'away', 'even', 'so', 'have', 'admit', 'home', 'movies', 'as', 'brief', 'were', 'disturbed', 'core', 'typical', 'today', 'horror', 'movies', 'twist', 'ending', 'film', 'high', 'yet', 'disturbing', 'note', 'minor', 'tweaks', 'Sinister', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'still', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'watch', 'lights', 'off', 'Halloween', 'night.3.5', '5']",N/A

I was not sure what to make of this movie at first, as I played it upon arrival but was really not in the mood to watch it.  So I put it away and played it again much later and over and over. This is a fantastic &#34;horror&#34; movie not only in its ability to keep you spellbound, but also in its ability to make you think. It also the affect which PYSCHO has on most people (well at least in 1961 when I saw it) and that is the gore you think you see is not really there...it is your imagination run wild.Hawke plays his role very close to the vest and very calculated. His angst rises in a slow manner until the movies climax. His pre-climatic scares are extremely believable in context of the movie plot. No screams or horrors which are not appropriate (unlike many horror movies).  The story lines continues to unfold with unexpected twists and turns, while Hawke takes us closer and closer to his unknowing abyss.The production and execution is believable and the other characters are well developed, particularly Deputy So-and So and Hawke's wife. Once again their quiet unease develops slowly and over time but in a believable manner. The story and horror are featured in such a way that there are no actual gory scenes, and those ideas are strictly left to the viewer. The psychological component is what makes this movie a GREAT horror flick.There are &#34;horror&#34; movies and there are &#34;horror&#34; movies. One relies on actual scenes, blood and carnage to makes its point. There is a place in film for that.

1543481,A3JXBZ8F65100O,B008220C92,Ferdy,"[5, 7]","I've loved horror movies and watched loads of them since I was a teenager.  After 30 odd years, you get pretty used to all the usual scare tactics and it takes a lot to really make you cringe.  I have to say that Sinister had me cringing, biting my nails and even covering my eyes in some parts.  It was original, unexpected for the most part and definitely creepy and frightening.  Ethan Hawke  gives an amazing performance as a true crime writer who finds a box of old home movies and stumbles upon a string of murders of whole families. The murders all happen in the most gruesome ways and are all recorded on super 8 film.  This is not a slasher movie.  The film of the actual murders all cut away at exactly the moment when it became gruesome but enough is shown to give you a clear idea of what is happening and honestly the imagined horror is, I think, worse, than seeing the blood and hearing the screams.  The only point where I think this movie didn't excel was toward the end.  It reverted to cheap and easy ""jump out of the shadows"" kind of scares rather than continuing with the creeping terror of the rest of the movie. That was only for about the last 15-20 minutes, though.One scene in particular stands out to me.

That whole things are there but you can't see them/things go bump in the night thing just gets me. I have always loved things like ""Unsolved Mysteries"" and ""A Haunting"" for just that reason. So when these types of movies come out I am always looking forward to seeing them. The best thing about these movies is when they do it right and have the right amount of atmosphere and chills. This kids is one of those movies as I ended up loving it, in fact it actually gave me chills at certain points.Ellison Oswalt [Ethan Hawk] is a true crime writer that had a huge hit and then could never match the same level of success with each project following. But maybe just maybe this new project of his may turn things around. He and his family are moving into a house that at one time was the scene of a horrific multi murder. While there he is going to do his usual thing and investigate the crime and try to get back that fame he once had.As it turns out he is not that welcome in town by its people or its law officials, but that is not the worst of things. Once settled in a little he discovers a box in the attic, the contents are a few films. So naturally he sets them up and watches them, turns out they are home movies of the murder he is investigating. The crazy thing is that there are more home movies of murders from different states and time periods in the box, and they may all be connected, and they may have brought the same evil into his home.This is one of the best horror movie I have seen in a while, especially from here in America. I have really been enjoying foreign horror films more so the past couple of years but this one is very very good. Written by first timer C. Robert Cargill and director Scott Derrickson this movie has everything you could want from a horror flick. The best thing though in my opinion is the atmosphere of this dark movie. I also like that movie builds and doesn't rush anything. A lot of good movies have been ruined by that. Also the super 8 films that he watches are very creepy and seem very realActing wise I have to say that Ethan Hawk did a great job here, maybe my favorite performance from him. he plays a man who longs for something lost that slowly succumbs to something truly dark and evil. Juliet Rylance who plays his wife is also excellent here as are the children. All around I liked everyone here including all the supporting players, which is rare because there is usually someone who annoys me.This film comes with some cool features including things on true crime writing but it is the audio commentaries that are the key to me. Firstly we have the director's commentary with Derrickson, and this is full of great insight into the making of the film. I would highly recommend viewing this movie with that commentary first as I think it was recorded first. Then of course we have the excellent and just as great writer's commentary with both Derrickson and Cargill. This commentary as all kinds of interesting facts and stuff that only adds to the film. I would highly recommend this film to any horror fan out there.",5,GREAT MOVIE AND EXCELLENT COMMENTARIES,1368489600,"05 14, 2013",2013,3176,"['SINISTERSupernatural/ghost/demon', 'stories', 'seem', 'always', 'strike', 'chord', 'reason', 'whole', 'things', 'are', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'them/things', 'go', 'bump', 'night', 'thing', 'just', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'things', 'Unsolved', 'Mysteries', 'Haunting', 'just', 'reason', 'So', 'when', 'types', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'am', 'always', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'best', 'thing', 'movies', 'when', 'do', 'right', 'have', 'right', 'amount', 'atmosphere', 'chills', 'kids', 'one', 'movies', 'ended', 'up', 'loving', 'fact', 'actually', 'gave', 'chills', 'certain', 'points.Ellison', 'Oswalt', '[', 'Ethan', 'Hawk', ']', 'true', 'crime', 'writer', 'had', 'huge', 'hit', 'then', 'could', 'never', 'match', 'same', 'level', 'success', 'project', 'following', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'new', 'project', 'may', 'turn', 'things', 'around', 'family', 'are', 'moving', 'house', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'scene', 'horrific', 'multi', 'murder', 'going', 'do', 'usual', 'thing', 'investigate', 'crime', 'try', 'get', 'back', 'fame', 'once', 'had.As', 'out', 'not', 'welcome', 'town', 'people', 'law', 'officials', 'not', 'worst', 'things', 'Once', 'settled', 'little', 'box', 'attic', 'contents', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'So', 'naturally', 'up', 'watches', 'out', 'are', 'home', 'movies', 'murder', 'investigating', 'crazy', 'thing', 'are', 'more', 'home', 'movies', 'murders', 'different', 'states', 'time', 'periods', 'box', 'may', 'be', 'connected', 'may', 'have', 'brought', 'same', 'evil', 'home.This', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'while', 'especially', 'here', 'America', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'enjoying', 'foreign', 'horror', 'films', 'more', 'so', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'one', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'Written', 'first', 'timer', 'C.', 'Robert', 'Cargill', 'director', 'Scott', 'Derrickson', 'movie', 'everything', 'could', 'want', 'horror', 'flick', 'best', 'thing', 'opinion', 'atmosphere', 'dark', 'movie', 'also', 'like', 'movie', 'builds', ""n't"", 'rush', 'anything', 'lot', 'good', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'ruined', 'Also', 'super', '8', 'films', 'are', 'very', 'creepy', 'seem', 'very', 'realActing', 'wise', 'have', 'say', 'Ethan', 'Hawk', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'maybe', 'favorite', 'performance', 'man', 'who', 'something', 'lost', 'slowly', 'succumbs', 'something', 'truly', 'dark', 'evil', 'Juliet', 'Rylance', 'who', 'wife', 'also', 'excellent', 'here', 'are', 'children', 'liked', 'everyone', 'here', 'including', 'supporting', 'players', 'rare', 'usually', 'someone', 'who', 'me.This', 'film', 'cool', 'features', 'including', 'things', 'true', 'crime', 'writing', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'are', 'key', 'Firstly', 'have', 'director', 'commentary', 'Derrickson', 'full', 'great', 'insight', 'making', 'film', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'viewing', 'movie', 'commentary', 'first', 'think', 'was', 'recorded', 'first', 'Then', 'course', 'have', 'excellent', 'just', 'great', 'writer', 'commentary', 'Derrickson', 'Cargill', 'commentary', 'kinds', 'interesting', 'facts', 'stuff', 'only', 'film', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'horror', 'fan', 'there']",N/A

He's not THAT old!  (He seems to wear that old-man sweater nearly the whole movie, though!)  Hawke, who plays a murder-novel author, and Juliet Rylance, who plays his wife, are very good here and believable as a couple, especially in that authentic-feeling argument scene in the bedroom after she realizes that he has deceived the whole family by having them move into a house where a murder spree took place, hoping to get quality inspiration for his new true-murder novel in order to, are you kidding me, provide the best for his family!  Well, at least that part is original, but otherwise it's mostly another Hollywood horror classic wannabe that just isn't quite convincing enough, although, admittedly, it does have some frightening visuals, but even they will probably prove to be ultimately forgettable.  What I'll probably remember more is that it seems like 1/4 of the movie is Hawke loading and splicing home movies; what was the point of that, anyway?  And, just a thought, but it wouldn't have hurt to throw in a splash of a sense of humor (like in ""An American Werewolf in London"").  Former United States presidential candidate Fred Dalton Thompson (who some may remember from the first season of ""Roseanne"" as Roseanne's no-nonsense boss) is a nice touch, though, and interesting to see as the local unwelcoming sheriff.

Usually, movies with massive buzz turn out to be duds, yet Sinister skillfully avoids this accursed fate, I'm happy to say! It stars my favorite actor Ethan Hawke, who, I'm happy to realize, has fathered children with his former nanny, a true, touching love fest to be sure!The plot of Sinister revolves around Hawke's character who is a true-crime fanboy, which means that he is really a superfan of serial killers, and he makes his living by purchasing serial killer memorabilia (such as Chuck Manson's sweet-a/s/s guitar and Scott Peterson's hands that strangled Lacey!). Ewww, eerie, right? I know! Anyhoo, to purchase this memorabilia, he has a lot of traveling to do, which is why he very benevolently moves his family around from new city to new city, uprooting his kids wherever he goes. However, Hawke finally settles in an old house (oh, you know that it just will turn out to be an Amityville Horror house of some kind *rolls eyes*), yet he discovers a treasure trove of old, VHS movies that really gets the plot moving into full-steam.It turns out that there was a family of liberals who was actually murdered in his new house! The old, VHS movies are actually old recordings this ultra-crazy family of Texas Chainsaw Massacre-like libs made before they were murdered. As the story progresses, we see with increasing horror how this family of slain libs actually recorded all of their debauched acts, such as promoting voting without any checks for IDs at voting booths, handing taxpayer money over to green-energy companies like Solyndra, and, worst of all, taking turns defecating on the U.S. flag! Horrid, I know!Watching all of these old, VHS movies unleashes a horribly malevolent, supernatural entity in Hawke's new house, and his family is immediately under threat. This diabolical entity begins to do all sorts of noxious things, such as p/e/e on the family's American flag, banish crosses all over the home and even set all TVs in the house to MSNBC. After a while, poor Hawke and his family become crazy, with Hawke finally snapping and killing his wife and his little, crippled, undergrown 8-year-old boy, in what the authorities later suspect was a ""roid rage"" killing. Shockingly, we the audience find out in the epilogue that the only thing wrong with the house was that it had some asbestos in the walls that was leaking out and causing this craziness. In other words, the Hawke character killed his family and his crippled, 8-year-old, retarded son for nothing!Honestly, I had mixed emotions about the stunning ending because it played on my emotions rather cruelly, especially because my emotions are still raw from all those newspaper accounts of whole families being murdered that I always read.

At the basic level, it's really not scary - the ghost children have horrible make-up and the main scary guy (called Boogie) looks like a cheap Halloween mask. The lighting is so bad that you can't see enough from scene to scene. The music is distracting. The logic is weak and character motivations lacking.

Ok, that sounds familiar? But, the town does not want Ethan Hawke, as he is an investigative journalist/novelist that writes about true murder cases of people. His biggest success, is where he actually cracked the case of a murder, making the cops look inept, which most of them did not take to kindly to, including the head cop of the new town he moved to, telling him he should pack up & leave.Ellison told his wife he was writing a new book, but didn't tell her the whole truth. As the house they moved into was the scene of four family members murdered, & a fifth member, a little girl is missing. Ellison is using this house to write a new book, one that will save his career, at least he thinks...then he finds an 8mm film of the family members being murdered, each one singularly, in a different manner, but not only the family from the house, but others too! A dark shadowy figure appears in these films. After watching this, strange things begin to happen to the whole family. The children have imaginary playmates. The shadowy figure appears in glimpse, & the corner of Ellison's eyes. It has an agenda, it wants the children!""Sinister"" is a film that will crawl under your skin, moving around, making you just intrigued & uncomfortable enough to keep watching, as a feeling of impending doom starts to arise from the plot. It most definitely has a sublime creepiness that grows more potent as Ellison begins to become aware of the danger to his family, & himself, made all the more potent by fine direction, acting, & a deliberate pace of new secrets being opened up, as the lid of doom inches ever closer to shutting on the family. You are glued to the screen wondering what will transpire next, even if you think you know, there are a few good twists, that reveal their selves, in a very potent ending, that you soon won't forget!Take the time to check this one out.

The town sherrif (played well by Fred Thompson--he found his way to the set!) wants no part of him, understandably, and warns him to move before something even worse takes place.  This all sounds like cliche horror fare, but the way Derrickson films it is entirely new.  He departs from the ""puppet master"" style ofInsidiousand only uses the ""found footage"" of the previous family's disaster to highlight the real premise of this supernatural thriller: that a certain kind of voyeurism--incidentally, what anyone who watches this must be complicit in--is itself a trait bad enough to warrant the punishment that comes, and boy, does it.  He deceptively puts the viewer at ease halfway through the film--I mistakenly thought the real promise of the film had already passed halfway through the movie--and then delivers what can only be called some masterfully cruel and unusual punishment.  The end, without using any spoilers, makes me think of a grimierCarnival of Souls.I'm not sure I could watch this again, and is only for those who like the absolute hell creeped out of them.  I think the success of the film is also dependent on it's soundtrack.  To my mind, this is better thanParanormal Activityand the aforementioned film he did with James Wan.

Ellison eventually finds a set of  disturbing snuff films and abnormal events begin to occur. Sinister is a disturbing and unsettling ride of psychological horror.The story in this film creepy and haunting and the horror is balanced very well; it uses elements like eerie sounds and ghostly imagery to create an unsettling atmosphere and high tension, and uses realistic violence and effective jump-scares to shock. I really enjoy the variety and balance of the horror it has, since most modern horror films rely solely on one type (usually jump-scares or gorefest); it keeps you on your feet. The film also uses found-footage like sequences when Ellison watches the snuff films; these are very disturbing and shocking, and one of these holds a jump-scare that has already jumped to the top of my favorites (I won't spoil it, though). The ending of the film was also twisted and great. The story moves at a consistent pace, usually on the slower side but I felt like it added to the suspense. Ethan Hawke gives an amazing performance, one you wouldn't expect in a horror film but one that should be expected from a great actor like Hawke. The film has a unique and superb soundtrack, as well, that positively added to the haunting atmosphere of the film; this is truly a standout OST worth listening to outside of the film.Overall, Sinister is an exceptional horror film; it effectively uses all of the best elements of horror in a well balanced manner; and it's supported by a great lead performance, a consistent story, and an excellent soundtrack. I highly recommend a purchase for fans of the genre, a rental if you're still on the edge.

Give me a break.And mature movie goers who have seen the same old flash of black & white sudden appearance of some ghost out of nowhere right next to the main character with the same old requisite blast of loud music: Guess what? It's really old. There are some really interesting ideas out there (e.g., The Pact) that relate stories in innovative ways without all the black and white ghosts and sudden bursts of music. Really, I think it's time to move on.There was nothing that explained why the antagonist decided to do what he did when he did. The last half hour came together a bit too conveniently - the set up for a sequel is abundantly clear.

1543576,A1EDDPGP0A8PF7,B008220C92,Kristofer Upjohn,"[0, 0]","Full review from Film Phreak! Visit us at filmphreak.tumblr.comSINISTER is an amazing balance of traditional film storytelling and the found footage motif. Of course, ever since Blair Witch (and revitalized with Paranormal Activity) there has been an unceasing gush of found footage flicks. Now, that may be an issue for some, but not for me. I like the genre overall. Not that there aren&#8217;t bad versions of the conceit but the genre as a whole isn&#8217;t trash, it just requires patience and an appreciation for the &#8220;slow burn&#8221;, a phrase I&#8217;ve seen bandied about SINISTER. Not every horror movie is about shock and awe - for the record, I LIKE shock and awe horror - and the found footage genre, while it does depend on shock, gets its shocks from atmosphere and flashes of terror rather than by unleashing horror weapons of mass dismemberment. As it happens, there are a number of gruesome murders as part of SINISTER&#8217;s sinister story but there are shown, but obliquely, suggested askew with cinematographic techniques, more than hints, peeks, perhaps, of the violence that is part and parcel of SINISTER. But with SINISTER what&#8217;s important is knowing that these things happened, not seeing it in gory detail. It ain&#8217;t that kinda movie. SINISTER is about building tension while being creepy in tone right from the start. It&#8217;s a build that has as much hook as anything in the [name of torture porn[ franchise. It&#8217;s not the same kinda movie, but it&#8217;s as suspense filled as John Carpenter&#8217;s &#8220;Halloween&#8221; and - dareIsayit?yesIdaresayit - and is qualitatively every bit as good. It&#8217;s one of the scariest of the found footage movies, ranking right up there with my favorites, such as VHS and GRAVE ENCOUNTERS 1 & 2. But, as I mentioned, this is not only found footage, but a blend. I&#8217;m going to say little about the plot, for both spoiler reasons and the fact that I&#8217;m not a plot regurgitator/synopsis-book-report kinda critic. I&#8217;ll say this much: The found footage is grafted perfectly into the normal cinematic narrative by way of reels of home movies containing distressing and murderous footage; these reels are integral to the plot. Ethan Hawke is a true crime writer trying to keep his family together as well as struggling to write another bestseller (his last one came out years ago) to keep his family afloat. He&#8217;s driven and the family move into the house where the crimes occurred that Hawke is writing about places great stress on family members and &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s nice to have some REAL drama incorporated into a horror movie.

1543585,A2T049UQONS0OY,B008220C92,Larry VanDeSande,"[1, 2]","""Sinister"" is a little horror film that made the rounds of small theaters coincidental with its video release. I saw it yesterday in a mall theater in Grand Rapids, Mich. It's the story of an author (Ethan Hawke) who writes about grizzly murders for a living, moving himself and his family (wife plus two kids) to the whereabouts of the killings for his book research. In this film, his family has moved to the home where the murdered family lived and where the deeds occurred. And, this time, the intrepid journalist gets a lot more than he bargained for, receiving clues about the murders no one else knows from who knows where.The production involves many typical horror film tricks -- loud noises and things that go bump in the night, ghostly visions of what may or may not be people, townspeople at odds with the principal characters because they are revisiting the murders that rocked their neighborhood, machines that turn themselves on after everyone goes to bed, the usual malcontented children, one of whom can't sleep through the night without going into something like night shock. And on and on. All the odd noises and strange goings-on happen in the dark, of course.But a few clever plot contrivances, a marginally serpentine story that will keep you vested, and some originality save this little film from being just another exercise in horror film ho-hum. I can't tell you the best part because it would spoil the end and disclose the denouement. However, I can tell you that neither my wife nor I -- who are 65 and 62 years old, respectively, and veterans of hundreds of horror films in the theater and at home -- could guess how the film would be resolved and what would happen at the end. If neither of us can guess how a movie is going to end -- and you get a few clues in the last half-hour of ""Sinister"" -- then it is in my book an effective movie.Be forewarned, the opening scene of ""Sinister"" is fairly grizzly in itself. Having seen the opening, I was fearful the movie would venture into X-rated territory but it did not. It is R-rated for intensity, adult content, scenes of murder, language and blood but the movie does not particularly manifest anything the average horror film maven would consider bad taste in 2012. See this in the small theater, like we did, or on your 55-inch TV and prepare yourself for a good horror story.",4,An effective little horror film though not among the greats of the genre,1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,2358,"['Sinister', 'little', 'horror', 'film', 'made', 'rounds', 'small', 'theaters', 'coincidental', 'video', 'release', 'saw', 'yesterday', 'mall', 'theater', 'Grand', 'Rapids', 'Mich', 'story', 'author', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'who', 'grizzly', 'murders', 'living', 'moving', 'family', 'wife', 'two', 'kids', 'whereabouts', 'killings', 'book', 'research', 'film', 'family', 'moved', 'home', 'where', 'murdered', 'family', 'lived', 'where', 'deeds', 'occurred', 'time', 'intrepid', 'journalist', 'lot', 'more', 'bargained', 'receiving', 'clues', 'murders', 'one', 'else', 'who', 'where.The', 'production', 'many', 'typical', 'horror', 'film', 'tricks', 'loud', 'noises', 'things', 'go', 'bump', 'night', 'ghostly', 'visions', 'what', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'people', 'townspeople', 'odds', 'principal', 'characters', 'are', 'revisiting', 'murders', 'rocked', 'neighborhood', 'machines', 'turn', 'everyone', 'bed', 'usual', 'malcontented', 'children', 'one', 'whom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'night', 'going', 'something', 'night', 'shock', 'odd', 'noises', 'strange', 'goings-on', 'happen', 'dark', 'course.But', 'few', 'clever', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'marginally', 'serpentine', 'story', 'will', 'keep', 'vested', 'originality', 'save', 'little', 'film', 'being', 'just', 'exercise', 'horror', 'film', 'ho-hum', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'best', 'part', 'would', 'spoil', 'end', 'disclose', 'denouement', 'However', 'can', 'tell', 'wife', 'who', 'are', '65', '62', 'years', 'old', 'respectively', 'veterans', 'hundreds', 'horror', 'films', 'theater', 'home', 'could', 'guess', 'how', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'resolved', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'end', 'can', 'guess', 'how', 'movie', 'going', 'end', 'get', 'few', 'clues', 'last', 'half-hour', 'Sinister', 'then', 'book', 'effective', 'movie.Be', 'forewarned', 'opening', 'scene', 'Sinister', 'fairly', 'grizzly', 'Having', 'seen', 'opening', 'was', 'fearful', 'movie', 'would', 'venture', 'X-rated', 'territory', 'did', 'not', 'R-rated', 'intensity', 'adult', 'content', 'scenes', 'murder', 'language', 'blood', 'movie', 'not', 'particularly', 'manifest', 'anything', 'average', 'horror', 'film', 'maven', 'would', 'consider', 'bad', 'taste', '2012', 'See', 'small', 'theater', 'did', '55-inch', 'TV', 'prepare', 'good', 'horror', 'story']",N/A

1543601,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B008220C92,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","Anyone who reads this column regularly knows that I am a horror fan. Sometimes it's to the point that I attempt to not write about a new horror release for fear people will think that's all I watch. But on occasion a movie comes along that I feel compelled to write about because it is just that good. Such is the case with SINISTER, a movie I missed in theaters but one that will stick with me now that I've watched it.Ethan Hawke stars as Ellison Oswalt, a true crime author whose last two books didn't do so well after the roaring success of his first book. In search of a new story Ellison is moving his family, wife Tracy and children Trevor and Ashley, into a new home in a new town. What he doesn't tell them is that the house they are moving into was owned by the victims of a gruesome murder and possible abduction.It seems that the family living there previously was executed in their own backyard. Bound with their heads covered by bags, they were stood on a bench with nooses round their necks. The opposite ends of those nooses were tied to a branch that fell, lifting them and strangling them. All the family with the exception of their little girl.As they move in Ellison takes a box of loose items to store in the attic and finds a scorpion there. He drops the box on it to smash it which loosens a floorboard under which he discovers a box of super 8mm films. Taking these to his office where he's already hard at work on the story of the family, he watches the first movie which begins with clips of the family and then shows their execution. Rather than call the local police who are no big fans of his (with the exception of one deputy) due to his treatment of other officers in one of his books, he begins watching the other films.Each night as Ellison works on his book and watches another film, he learns more about the killer. At the same time strange things begin to happen in the house. Noises, walking about in the attic, all draw his attention away from the book to see what is happening. Several of these incidents end up being a child searching for the bathroom in a new house or his son having night terrors, something he has suffered from in the past. But other items happened for reasons best left unsaid.Each roll of film reveals another family that seems fine until their death throws are captured on film. While watching the second film, Ellison catches a glimpse of something in the waves reflected on the pool a family is being drowned in. The image is that of a face but distorted. Subsequent films offer more glimpses of the possible killer as well as symbols at each one.With the assistance of the deputy Ellison is put in touch with a university professor the police sometimes contact for dealings in the occult of cults. This professor provides Ellison with some of the clues he's been looking for as well as part of the connection between these families. But it isn't until the last moments of the movie when he gets the one item that ties it all together. Before he gets that information the question of Ellison's sanity is called into play and just whether or not he's dreaming things or they are actually happening is answered.I've seen a lot of horror films, so many that I couldn't tell you the last time one of them actually scared me. This film did just that. When it was finished I found myself thinking that perhaps sleeping with the lights on that night might be a good thing. Yes there are a few predictable jump moments but there are some even I wasn't prepared for. At one point I checked my pulse and found that it was indeed racing just a bit.Hawke has had good and bad movies both in his career. This time around he does it right offering just the tiniest hint of possible insanity but lots of proof that he is definitely frightened and a bit disgusted by what he sees on screen. His character is determined to have that success of a hit book one more time but begins to wonder if the cost of his family is worth it.The best way to truly experience this film is sitting in the dark, the phone unplugged and every other distraction taken away. But if you tend to jump at the smallest thing, if you have nightmares induced by these sort of films and if you just don't like feeling your skin crawl you might want to watch it with the lights on.

1543618,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B008220C92,M. Oleson,"[2, 3]","This is an above average ghost story in spite of some obvious silliness.  A true crime novelist (Ethan Hawke) who was a big success with his first book but not so much on 2 follow-ups is feeling the pressure to get out another hit.  He focuses on a small town in upstate New York and moves there with his wife (Juliet Rylance) and 2 children (Michael Hall D'Addario and Clare Foley).What he doesn't tell them is that they are actually moving into the house owned by a family of 5 that were summarily hanged in the back yard.  Well, all but one girl who was never found.  Things start to go bump in the night but only Ellison (Hawke) seems to notice.  Lured into the attic, he finds an 8 mm film projector and a handful of family film reels.  When he watches them he discovers typical family gatherings but the videos abruptly change to the brutal murders of each family dating back to 1966.  So what is the common element here?For help, Jack calls in a friendly sheriff deputy (James Ransone).  Strange things are happening with the kids too.  The boy sleepwalks and has terrible nightmares.  The girl draws on walls and has invisible relationships.

We follow this attempt where he unexpectedly encounters the supernatural.Even with a formulaic plot, Sinister grabs the viewer for a fairly fast pasted ride.  There are a few plot holes; however, they could be explained using the realm of the supernatural.  The evil could have been better explained by utilizing the Professor Jonas character more.Negatives aside, the movie subsists with a remarkably small cast and small area.  The plot moves forward at a well paced clip with certain surprising moments.  The actors all properly portray their characters.  Also importantly, the story does not break its own rules.

The original ideas are pretty entertaining and the ideas for murder are pretty neat but all in all it's pretty much the same stuff we've seen before.You have a true crime writer who moves into a house once owned by a family that was slaughtered by a killer and, of course, now crazy things begin to happen. The reason the family doesn't move immediately is because the writer is more obsessed about his book than the well-being of his family. More things happen and couple predictable twists happen and I won't give anything away but the building suspense leads to exactly where you'd think it'd be an hour into it.I watched this alone at night and it wasn't very scary. The scenes that were supposed to make you jump didn't and the gruesome scenes that were supposed to make you cringe only made you slightly uncomfortable.The soundtrack was amazing though and I'll look into buying that cause it very unsettling and entertaining.

Tired of the same formulas being re hashed over and over it was with some hesitation we streamed the aptly named ""Sinister"".This is one terrifying movie, a story well told and an instant classic. The cast is superb and performances are top notch all the way around. However, it's Ethan Hawke in perhaps his best performance since ""Before the Devil Knows you're dead"" who carries the film in a tour de force performance as unsolved murder case writer  Ellison Oswalt who  when asked early on in an interview if he would ever write for money exclaims ""I would rather cut off my hands"". We learn quickly  that this isn't entirely true as he willingly puts his wife and two young children in harms way.Hawke's descent into some gray fog between terror and madness has a surgical precision to it -- and it's riveting to watch. ""Sinister"" doesn't waste time as Cinematographer Chris Norr creates an ominous and disturbing world of shadow and light, and the feeling of being watched is palatable. Director and Co Writer Scott Derrickson avoids the expected and cliche' like the plague. Coaxing genuine performances he understands that an audience has to connect with the actors on screen and we do and we do at an almost visceral level. This is smart, terrifying story telling.Aside from a bit of blood splatter there is no gore here and fans of splatter films are sure to be disappointed because ""Sinister"" does have one pre requisite - it requires you to think an demands you let go. The horror in terms of violent atrocities are suggestive and that too is smart. The greatest horror films that have stood the test of time knew this. They banked on it. The directors knew that nothing, absolutely nothing on the screen can compete with the imagination and that to try is to fail.Roger Ebert whom I have great admiration and respect for was disappointed that the demons identity is revealed so early in the film. But I disagree. In ""Fallen"" we know very early in the film the demon is Azazel, in ""The Rite"" we learn almost immediately  Anthony Hopkins is possessed by a demon named Baal and of course the early introduction of the big cheese himself  - Satan - makes an appearance early on in many films including such legendary classics as the Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby.""Sinister"" is not so much a film of possession, it doesn't drag in the over played Church versus Demon formula that requires you to believe in God for any chance of absolution from the terror unfolding on the screen. It's a deliberate and welcome choice.Impressive cameos by both Fred Thompson as sheriff and an uncredited performance as a famous professor of the occult is wonderfully played by accomplished actor Vincent D'Onofrio.

1543654,A1K6K23WG0IBWE,B008220C92,Quadro Sinead Summer,"[7, 11]","'Sinister' was a massive disappointment. I should have known better. ""From the director of The Exorcism of Emily Rose"", as though that's something to market on. I hated that movie, and thought it was a massive letdown. Anyway as has always been the case I read a ton of reviews that suggested even jaded horror fans will find it truly scary and terrifying, what a load of granny's apple pie that was. Truth is the movie was average horror at best, only a little creepy here and there, even sometimes predictable, which I did not expect.I suggest not even reading my review any further and go watch Insidious again. I can tell you that Insidious at least does manage to be truly creepy and scary at times. it can also almost get a jump out of a hardcore horror fan, but this movie doesn't even come close to being as good as Insidious, and I am truly a hardcore horror fan, and even Insidious was not as good as I had hoped. Still I did really like it though. But this movie? If you are a genuine jaded horror fan and not just one who really isn't but thinks they are, I feel pretty confident in saying you will likely sit there wondering when something is going to happen that will really knock your socks off. And while your waiting, if you saw the trailer, you'll be thinking ""Ok maybe it get's really scary when he see's what ever it was I saw in the trailer that made him jump back in terror. I bet it get's really horrifying then"". Well the truth is when that moment comes don't expect much if you truly are a real jaded horror fan because you will likely be disappointed that the moment is only a little unsettling and not much more than that.Added to that, What was supposed to be these ghost children or what ever they were, they looked like your average kids next door in bad Halloween makeup. This was supposed to really creep you out. But it doesn't. It comes off feeling pretty silly and sometimes mildly creepy. Mostly the inclusion of the children made it seem more like a lite weight horror film for lite weight horror fans. But there were some moments that gave me a bit of a jump and a few seconds here and there where I felt a bit scared I suppose, But that's it. And the acting was excellent sometimes, but also a bit off at other times. Including Hawke who I felt didn't react enough to some stuff that would make most people s*** their pants.The 8mm footage scenes were a bit creepy, but felt more like something you would see on one of those ION forensic TV shows, and the demon or what ever it was looked like a singer from a Norwegian black metal band. In the end there was maybe one or two mild jump scares, some pretty good music, and silly kids running around in bad Halloween makeup. Strongly advise hardcore horror fans to skip it.

The cast is fantastic to a fault; Ethan Hawke and Juliet Rylance in particular act the hell out of a scene together later in the film as tensions are coming to a head. The movie is about a true crime writer (Hawke) who moves his family into a murder house so that he can get a better feel for the subjects of his latest book. At the house - which his family is not supposed to know is the actual murder house, which is one of a number of unlikely things he does in this movie - he finds a box of home movies. When he watches the home movies he realizes the mystery he is investigating is a lot weirder than he ever imagined. The idea behind what happened to the previous family is plenty disturbing enough to keep the viewer uncomfortable, and the research the lead character uncovers about a symbol discovered at the crime scene will keep you thinking about the film long after you shut out the lights to try to sleep. The soundtrack is a genius blend of sound effects and eery music, not quite one or the other, to keep you on edge. It's just that Ellison, the lead character, does things you'd think any halfway intelligent human being would have known better than to do. Like move his family into a murder house and think they wouldn't find out about it. Or something else he does later in the movie, which (minor spoilers) was telegraphed in such a way that the viewer did not need the deputy's timely intervention to see it coming. As a true crime writer, Ellison should have picked up on that connection and it would appear he didn't. These random acts of derp from the main character detract a bit from the overall enjoyment of the movie, but it's still well worth a watch if you like creepy films.",4,Very well acted,1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,1808,"['Sinister', 'tries', 'do', 'cardboard', 'boxes', 'what', 'Psycho', 'did', 'showers', 'movie', 'definitely', 'cast', 'fantastic', 'fault', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Juliet', 'Rylance', 'particular', 'act', 'hell', 'scene', 'together', 'later', 'film', 'tensions', 'are', 'coming', 'head', 'movie', 'true', 'crime', 'writer', 'Hawke', 'who', 'family', 'murder', 'house', 'can', 'get', 'better', 'feel', 'subjects', 'latest', 'book', 'house', 'family', 'not', 'supposed', 'know', 'actual', 'murder', 'house', 'one', 'number', 'unlikely', 'things', 'movie', 'box', 'home', 'movies', 'When', 'home', 'movies', 'mystery', 'investigating', 'lot', 'weirder', 'ever', 'imagined', 'idea', 'what', 'happened', 'previous', 'family', 'plenty', 'disturbing', 'enough', 'keep', 'viewer', 'uncomfortable', 'research', 'lead', 'character', 'uncovers', 'symbol', 'discovered', 'crime', 'scene', 'will', 'keep', 'thinking', 'film', 'long', 'shut', 'out', 'lights', 'try', 'sleep', 'soundtrack', 'genius', 'blend', 'sound', 'effects', 'eery', 'music', 'not', 'quite', 'one', 'other', 'keep', 'edge', 'just', 'Ellison', 'lead', 'character', 'things', ""'d"", 'think', 'halfway', 'intelligent', 'human', 'being', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'do', 'move', 'family', 'murder', 'house', 'think', 'would', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'something', 'else', 'later', 'movie', 'minor', 'spoilers', 'was', 'telegraphed', 'such', 'way', 'viewer', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'deputy', 'timely', 'intervention', 'see', 'coming', 'true', 'crime', 'writer', 'Ellison', 'should', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'connection', 'would', 'appear', 'did', ""n't"", 'random', 'acts', 'derp', 'main', 'character', 'detract', 'bit', 'overall', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'still', 'well', 'watch', 'like', 'creepy', 'films']",N/A

The opening 10 minutes that set up the movie were an intriguing combination of decent acting and subtle exposition. Ethan Hawke plays a true crime writer who moves into a house that is a crime scene in order to write that one book that will make him famous. As he starts investigating the crime, he sees a lot of home movies that are all very disturbing. His research becomes even more insane as similar murders crop up other places.It's a great setup but there's a certain point where the movie becomes all about the research. There's only so much tension that you can get out of a man searching over the internet and that's pretty much exhausted in the first 20 minutes. The middle part of the movie is full of just too much research and while this might have been more scary in a movie theater (people are freaking out over Paranormal Activity after all), it really doesn't work very well at home.There's also the domestic argument scene that adds some veracity to the movie but is also a drag on the last act. The ending has some nice creepy camera work but it is conveying a twist that everyone could see coming a mile away.Still, it's a fine horror movie with many of the tropes that people have come to expect from their midnight viewing.

I think Sinister was good but not great, it had several good scary scenes, which is ultimately what I look for in horror films, and it was also very suspenseful, but ultimately it never really transcended the typical horror formula, it utilized found footage in the form of the tapes depicting the murders of the previous families, and before you discover the film's ""monster"", which is a pagan deity called Baghuul,it seems almost like a murder mystery film. Had it not been for the trailers which spoil many scenes in the movie and focus intensely on the Baghuul character I probably wouldn't have known this was even a supernatural horror film. I probably would have thought it was a crime or mystery film, albeit a dark one, but still not horror. The trailer really ruined it for me, and had me believe the film was more focused on Baghuul when in reality it focused much more on Ellison (Ethan Hawke) and his downward spiral to madness, after he knowingly moves his family into a house where the grisly murders took place. The acting was okay, and it was very scary at times, but the film was simply good, not great. Many of the scenes in the film were pointless, corny, or incredibly cliched, such as the creepy child's drawings and the eerie ghost kids. Overall decent, but nothing excellent or unique.

Upon further inspection, Ellison discovers that a pale, hollow-eyed figure can be seen lurking in the background in each one of the home movies. A pattern begins to emerge, as Ellison becomes consumed with the dark secrets that lie within the films. Further investigation confirms that there are demonic forces at work, and that Ellison may have opened a gateway that has placed his family in danger.`Sinister' takes familiar themes and situations and spins them in entirely different directions, making the film unpredictable and highly unnerving as a result. The film score by Christopher Young is almost a character in and of itself. It accentuates the disturbing nature of the film, cranking the scares all the way up to eleven. Ethan Hawke delivers an extraordinarily nuanced performance, and this ranks among some of his best work. The rest of the cast is just as good, under the direction of Scott Derrickson, who pulls absolutely no punches for the entirety of the film. Where most directors would turn away from such material, Derrickson dives right in, creating a cinematic experience that will live forever in your memory.`Sinister' is utterly disturbing and the best horror film that I have seen all year.

Based on this high rating, I rented it from Netflix and was very, very disappointed. Warning: there are some spoilers below.The cast seemed impressive. I generally like Ethan Hawke, Fred Thompson, and (especially) Vincent D'Onofrio (who was uncredited....probably by choice), but this production gave them little to work with. Ethan Hawke spent virtually the entire movie roaming the house, in the dark despite nearby light switches, being startled every 10 seconds by things we've all seen before....items appearing from nowhere, weird faces in photos, scorpions, snakes, falling through the floor, etc. What was particularly annoying is that the director was not content with simply letting the shock value of each revelation speak for itself, but chose to accompany each of them with a blast of noise so loud that it made you jump off the couch. Fred Thompson did the best he could with his ""cranky sheriff"" part, but Vincent D'Onofrio never directly appeared in person, relegated instead to a talking image on a computer screen, providing all the plot exposition necessary to make some sense of what was happening.The prevailing feeling throughout the movie was that I had seem it all before, and done much better. The idea of an ancient demon making life miserable for innocent folks was done long ago....in Ghost Busters, for one. The progressive deterioration of a father being driven crazy by events in a house....in the Shining and Amityville Horror. The threat to children by paranormal forces....in Poltergeist and about 98 other movies. In short, there was not a single original moment in the entire film. If you have been watching movies for even a few years, you have already seen it all before....and probably done much better. Add to that the fact that this movie lasted for almost two hours, occurred almost entirely in the dark (turn on the lights !!!), and dragged so horribly, that inadvertent naps were not only inevitable, but almost a relief.A horror movie is only as scary as its villain, and in this case, the ancient demon, I forget his name, was a joke. He reminded me of just how awful Exorcist II was (remember good old Pazuzu?). Indeed, I have seen more convincing demons at my door on Halloween; and, let's face it, the whole ""ancient demon"" concept has been done to death. The moment Vincent told us who was responsible for the mayhem, I rolled my eyes and almost reached for the STOP button on the remote. You KNOW a movie you have selected is lousy when members of your family progressively lose interest, wander off to do other things, and you end up all alone, marinating in the misery of your own poor judgement.Avoid this embarrassment and leave this turkey on the shelf or otherwise un-rented, un-purchased, and most importantly, un-watched.

True crime author Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) moves into the same house with the intention of investigating the gruesome killing and writing about it. The locals are not warm to the idea, but we don't see any incidences due to budget constraints. Ellison doesn't inform his family they are in the same house that the killings took place.In the attic, Ellison discovers a horde of super 8 movies (some that have their own sound track, or so it seems) of the killing he is investigating as well as other killings that date back to the 1960's. He asks the questions, ""Who is filming this?"" and ""Why?"" and ""Where is Stephanie?"" She was the daughter of the family that was hung. They never found her.Ellison begins to investigate the other cases as weird things start to happen in the home. As usual it starts out slow and escalates.I liked the concept of the film more than its amateurish execution.

I would compare the horror in this to the Shining more then any other movie. Overall, not bad but I expected something different, more scary. I did like the ending though. I give it a B-.",3,Scary in parts but I expected scarier. This is more of a psychological then Saw like horror. Compareable to the Shining.

This was much better, though a bit slow at times. It is a haunted house film, a bit like Paranomal activity, except this film doesn't involve demons or ghosts. It does make you think and wonder about what is going on in it. Ethan Hawke does a good job as the crime writer getting scared to death while trying to write the best true crime book he has ever written. Someone should have told him to be careful what you ask for, as he gets more than he expects with this on. First of all, this man moves his family into a house where the entire family was hanged and one of the children is missing without telling his family about it. Shame on him.

Yes, the director wanted a different, darker look than a standard Hollywood film but it really pushed my suspended disbelief to the limit when, after several disturbing events, our protagonist wanders around in the near-pitch-black seemingly just to provide shadows for things to potentially hide in. Come ON! This was distracting for me, but, I feel this film gets so many things right in such a singular, tightly-reined way, my criticisms fall into the &#34;well, nobody's perfect&#34; zone. I'd give it 5 stars were it not for some distractingly dodgy makeup and some clunky, talky, and in my opinion unnecessary information-dumping. I found any plot holes to be small. Having said that, I was enthralled by this film. The Super 8 footage is INCREDIBLY DISTURBING and admirably this is due to what the viewer does NOT see. I'm still haunted by it days after watching the film. There are a blessed minimum of silly jump scares and overt cgi effects. However, it's Ethan Hawke who makes this whole thing work. He is SO inside the skin of his very rather unsympathetic character it's amazing. There is a scene where his character argues with his wife which is OUTSTANDINGLY real... just blew me away, and it could've gone so wrong had he not pitched his performance so well. Wisely, the action is mostly focused on the interior of the houses. The various red herrings are quite well-done without seeming unrealistic. And, THANK GOODNESS for once the whole thing doesn't climax with some stupid, clich&eacute; special effects fireball &#34;confrontation&#34;. Dread is ratcheted up very, very slowly to excellent effect. Personally, I felt things were explained a bit too much towards the end, but, it was such a different sort of ending I was able to set this aside. The cinematography is incredible without drawing to much attention to itself. I recommend this film with the strong warning that the &#34;home movie&#34; scenes were VERY UPSETTING to watch. There was a reason for this, instead being pure excessive indulgence, but, I hadn't been this bothered by this sort of approach since way back in HENRY, PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER.
