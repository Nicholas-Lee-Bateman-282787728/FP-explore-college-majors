And my was I quite pleasantly surprised.  I was amazed by the performances of Emile Hirsch and of Elisha Cuthbert, and of the ensembles as well.  Danielle's ""pimp"" was quite a well-played character, and I must give the actor his due (though I can't bring his name to mind right now).This movie is a wonderful blend of heart, humor, fantasy (please, who wouldn't want Elisha Cuthbert to move in next door), and downright SEX APPEAL.The movie keeps you enticed at all times watching the relationship between the leads develop, all the way to the VERY surprising and rewarding ending.  After this having been our begrudged fall-back, my friends and I walked out of the theater, and all we could say was, ""Wow"".  None of us could find more eloquent words to describe the movie.

622993,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B00005JMX6,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[2, 2]","I have to admit to expecting something of the calibre of an ""American Pie"" style lewd comedy aimed squarely at the 16 - 24 demographic, but was more than pleasantly surprised to find otherwise. Whereas this movie does have definite parallels to ""Risky Business"" the former teen cult classic, it's actually a very well paced, acted and script built gentle comedy, that can and does stand on its own feet. Emile Hirsch plays the shy academic desperately seeking love or sex preferably at the end of his graduating year, and hangs around with two unintentionally comic, and likeminded ""nerd"" friends. Enter Elisha Cuthbert as the new next door neighbor, immediately making Hirsch smitten beyond thoughts of graduation, and his impending attempts to win a scholarship to an Ivy League College. This premise alone has potential but when you add that she is a former porn star trying to escape her past, and has a seductively villianous former Producer hanging around (played brilliantly by Tim Olyphant), the standard teen love tug formula gets a much needed makeover. There are plenty of laughs and original moments as the script twists and turns, and overall the effect is a ""feelgood"" movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but doesn't revert to formula nonsense either. Those expecting titillation may wish to check out the unrated version I suspect (not having seen it) as the bulk of the ""sex"" in this comedy is tastefully handled. It's refreshing to find a teen style comedy that although it might not dazzle the intellect, has a good solid story, and doesn't rely on sight gags, or cheap vulgarity. 4 stars is a little high, but this was mainly for Olyphants performance (who I last saw in Deadwood), who has a sinful panache that carries the bulk of the story (for me at least). Surprise ending may preclude repeat viewings for many, and DVD extra's are a little thin, otherwise very entertaining.

622994,A2GANR9I6XHTU9,B00005JMX6,Amy Lynn,"[3, 6]","The begining of the film looked diffrent and promising, not your typical high school comedy. As the film goes on you realize it sure isnt your typical high school comedy but it SUCKS! The acting is horrible, the only half decent actor is played by the lead character Emilie Hirsh. What can you expect? The movie is about a porn star living next door. It was definetly worse than I expected and mixes in these stupid messages about love that shouldnt even be in the movie. It dosent even seem realistic, you cant buy it after all you have seen. I didnt see any chemistry at all between the 2 main characters-( the porn star and the kid) then again , maybe it was just bad acting. I dont see how anyone can compare this film to American Pie let alone Risky Business. I am also a big fan of more obscure cult movies but this just wasnt good. I didnt see how it can have much cult appeal either. The first half of the movie starts out with a 18 yr old named Mathew and his 2 friends, one day mathew sees ( the girl next door) and falls in love with her basically, then finds out shes a porn star. WOW. It even gets better from there , he gets into fights with her manager or guy who directs her films the guy steals 25 grand from some stupid club or fund raiser for this foreign kid thats suppoused to come to the school and now the kid has to come up with the money again and guess how he does it? Anyway there are a couple laughs towards the end but thats about it, this film was A DUD. A waste of time. I wouldnt recomend buying this without renting first. - also how this movie got 4 stars is beyond me , i dont know what kind of reviwers would give this dud 4 stars, that is really Misleading to people on here who want to buy a good movie. Ive seen good movies on here with 4 stars that are actually good but to place this one in with them is just nuts/ misleading- ITS 2.5 stars at the most. Buyer Beware.

I'm still not quite sure if it works as a ""teen comedy,"" but as a romantic comedy (one that definitely thinks outside the box), I like it. Emile Hirsch (Matthew) is defintely someone to watch for in the future.Basically, Matthew is a smart, nerdy (but not quite nerdy, he's pretty cute and sweet) high school senior, getting ready to head to Georgetown-- it's expensive, so of course he needs a scholarship to go. He's having trouble writing his ""What I'll remember most about high school"" quote for the yearbook. Then one day, a beautiful girl moves in next door (Elisha Cuthbert). He spies on her, sees her naked, she sees him, gets angry and storms next door. The next thing you know, poor Matt is running down the street naked. She totally got him back. Another thing also happens-- they begin to fall for each other. But what do you know. She's a former porn star. He had no idea and is uncomfortable about it. She didn't want to tell him, saying, ""I liked the way you looked at me.""All kinds of stuff happens in this movie. Do you notice how choppy the above paragraph is? That's the way the movie is. It would've been nice if it was just a story about him and her, minus all the stuff about the porn business. It was like the movie makers really wanted to make a teen comedy and show as much boobs and butt as possible for their audience. As much I liked Timothy Olyphant in this, I wish the whole ordeal with him had just been deleted. It could've been a great movie about people. Not teen situations.Overall, a fair movie.

Things get worse when her producer Kelly(the solid Timothy Olyphant), gets into the mix, and Matthew's perfect world starts to collapse. The film is a hodgepode of teen sex farce, romantic comedy, and parts where it tries to be serious and poignant. It's an odd mix, and they don't all gel. The direction and style, courtesy of Luke Greenfield, comes off like a new version of ""Risky Business"" for the new generation. It's a style that is sets it apart from some of it's kin, and is kind of refrshing. The leads are pretty good too. Emile Hirsch has a strong likeability factor, and you really do like him and want him to win. Elisha is a vision, and she is perfectly cast because she exudes the perfect fantasy girl you wished lived next door. Olyphant is equally engaging and funny to watch. Matthew's friends are funny comic reliefs as well. The premise is obviously silly to the nth degree and is beyond plausible. But in movies like these, plausibility probably isn't the first thing on everyone's minds. While the decent acting and stylish direction is most welcome, it still can't hide the fact that the movie is raunchy, and is indeed a teen sex fiasco with some fancier coating. If it's not your thing, this won't grab you. If you are open to anything, or to this type of film, you might be surprised.",3,"Knock, Knock....",1096070400,"09 25, 2004",2004,2471,"['geriatric', 'woman', 'horrible', 'cough', 'brought', 'decades', 'smoking', 'couple', 'four', 'noisy', 'dogs', 'four', 'kids', 'who', 'matches', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'next', 'door', 'Not', 'one', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'one', 'can', 'dream', 'yet', 'member', 'teen', 'sex', 'comedy', 'canon', 'bit', 'better', 'most', 'others', 'recently', 'genre', 'might', 'be', 'downright', 'monstrosity', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'breezy', 'surprise', 'others', 'Granted', 'fluff', 'thru', 'thru', 'was', 'better', 'had', 'expected', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Matthew', 'Kidman', 'ordinary', 'kid', 'nice', 'boy', 'next', 'door', 'demeanor', 'do', 'gooder', 'striving', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'become', 'next', 'president', 'walks', 'beautiful', 'new', 'neighbor', 'Danielle', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'who', 'housesitting', 'next', 'door', 'aunt', 'eyeful', 'first', 'meeting', 'two', 'become', 'inseperable', 'Matthew', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'good', 'luck', 'gorgeous', 'hot', 'sexy', 'blonde', 'rubbing', 'brainless', 'jocks', 'not', 'merry', 'when', 'out', 'sleazoid', 'friend', 'Eli', 'Chris', 'Marquette', 'Danielle', 'actually', 'porn', 'star', 'Things', 'get', 'worse', 'when', 'producer', 'Kelly', 'solid', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'mix', 'Matthew', 'perfect', 'world', 'collapse', 'film', 'hodgepode', 'teen', 'sex', 'farce', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'parts', 'where', 'be', 'serious', 'poignant', 'odd', 'mix', 'do', ""n't"", 'gel', 'direction', 'style', 'courtesy', 'Luke', 'Greenfield', 'new', 'version', 'Risky', 'Business', 'new', 'generation', 'style', 'apart', 'kin', 'kind', 'refrshing', 'leads', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'strong', 'likeability', 'factor', 'really', 'do', 'want', 'win', 'Elisha', 'vision', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'perfect', 'fantasy', 'girl', 'wished', 'lived', 'next', 'door', 'Olyphant', 'equally', 'engaging', 'funny', 'watch', 'Matthew', 'friends', 'are', 'funny', 'comic', 'reliefs', 'as', 'well', 'premise', 'obviously', 'silly', 'nth', 'degree', 'plausible', 'movies', 'plausibility', 'probably', ""n't"", 'first', 'thing', 'everyone', 'minds', 'decent', 'acting', 'stylish', 'direction', 'most', 'welcome', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hide', 'fact', 'movie', 'raunchy', 'indeed', 'teen', 'sex', 'fiasco', 'fancier', 'coating', 'not', 'thing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'grab', 'are', 'open', 'anything', 'type', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'surprised']",N/A
623003,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005JMX6,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","The Girl Next Door is a pretty good comedy.  It's about a young man who is lucky enough to experience a wish that many young men have- a REALLY attractive girl moves in next door.  Of course at the time he doesn't realize that he's interested in a porn star.  When he finds out who the girl is and what kind of work she does... well surprisingly, he doesn't exactly have his feelings hurt (at least, not as bad as one would expect) but after witnessing a pornographic film starring the girl, he *does* get pretty angry for a few moments.  Fortuntely his feelings for the girl are much greater than his sexual desires, so the two hit off a friendly relationship despite her line of work.Of course as a man, I remember wishing for an attractive knockout of a girlfriend like the one featured in this film when I went to high school.  We ALL have!  As a viewer, you get to watch how shy and bashful the boy understandably is around the girl.  Don't even try to convince me you'd act any differently than the boy portraying the shy character in this movie.  Come on!  You'd be shy too!  I admit that I'd be.As far as comedy is concerned, well the parts I enjoyed the most were whenever the boy thought he was in deep, deep trouble!  Let me give you an example by mentioning a scene in the beginning.  Before even knowing the girls name, he happens to catch a glimpse of the young woman through his bedroom window undressing.  She quickly turns around and sees the kid watching her.  The boy of course freaks out!  Suddenly the girl storms out of her house and runs over to ring the door bell.  The kid walks down the stairs, sees his parents standing there and starring him down.  He gulps, braces himself for punishment, however... that's not what happens at all!  Instead it's the next door neighbor coming over to introduce herself, haha.  That's just one example of the humor you can expect.  A segment involving the boy embarrassing himself by walking down the street in his underwear is another hilarious part.Overall, the characters are really spectacular.  The high school jerks are convincing and can't believe the nerdy kid actually has a porn star for a girlfriend, and even the boys dorky friends are stunned beyond belief as well.  It's amazing how the porn star actually stands by the boys side through all the silly adventures and aspirations.  The boy never really has to try very hard to prove his love either- other than one brief segment, the porn star falls back into his loving arms once again.  Perhaps because she realizes that not many boys accept a girls feelings as openly and lovingly as this one does, so she holds onto a special relationship.I have to end this review on a personal note by saying that the girl who plays the porn star (Elisha Cuthbert) is REALLY gorgeous in this role.  She was attractive in the hit TV show 24 as well, but here?  She's really beautiful in The Girl Next Door.Quality laughs, solid storyline, and all the right actors and actresses make this film a clear winner.",5,she's a beauty,1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,3020,"['Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'pretty', 'good', 'comedy', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'lucky', 'enough', 'experience', 'wish', 'many', 'young', 'men', 'have-', 'REALLY', 'attractive', 'girl', 'moves', 'next', 'door', 'course', 'time', ""n't"", 'realize', 'interested', 'porn', 'star', 'When', 'out', 'who', 'girl', 'what', 'kind', 'work', 'well', 'surprisingly', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'have', 'feelings', 'hurt', 'least', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'witnessing', 'pornographic', 'film', 'starring', 'girl', '*does*', 'get', 'pretty', 'angry', 'few', 'moments', 'Fortuntely', 'feelings', 'girl', 'are', 'much', 'greater', 'sexual', 'desires', 'two', 'hit', 'friendly', 'relationship', 'line', 'work.Of', 'course', 'man', 'remember', 'wishing', 'attractive', 'knockout', 'girlfriend', 'one', 'featured', 'film', 'when', 'went', 'high', 'school', 'have', 'viewer', 'get', 'watch', 'how', 'shy', 'bashful', 'boy', 'understandably', 'girl', 'Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'convince', ""'d"", 'act', 'differently', 'boy', 'portraying', 'shy', 'character', 'movie', 'Come', ""'d"", 'be', 'shy', 'too', 'admit', ""'d"", 'be.As', 'far', 'comedy', 'concerned', 'well', 'parts', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'were', 'whenever', 'boy', 'thought', 'was', 'deep', 'deep', 'trouble', 'Let', 'give', 'example', 'mentioning', 'scene', 'beginning', 'even', 'knowing', 'girls', 'name', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'young', 'woman', 'bedroom', 'window', 'undressing', 'quickly', 'around', 'kid', 'watching', 'boy', 'course', 'freaks', 'out', 'Suddenly', 'girl', 'house', 'ring', 'door', 'bell', 'kid', 'down', 'stairs', 'parents', 'standing', 'there', 'starring', 'down', 'braces', 'punishment', 'however', 'not', 'what', 'Instead', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'coming', 'introduce', 'haha', 'just', 'one', 'example', 'humor', 'can', 'expect', 'segment', 'involving', 'boy', 'embarrassing', 'walking', 'down', 'street', 'underwear', 'hilarious', 'part.Overall', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'spectacular', 'high', 'school', 'jerks', 'are', 'convincing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'nerdy', 'kid', 'actually', 'porn', 'star', 'girlfriend', 'even', 'boys', 'dorky', 'friends', 'are', 'stunned', 'belief', 'as', 'well', 'amazing', 'how', 'porn', 'star', 'actually', 'boys', 'side', 'silly', 'adventures', 'aspirations', 'boy', 'never', 'really', 'try', 'very', 'hard', 'prove', 'love', 'either-', 'other', 'one', 'brief', 'segment', 'porn', 'star', 'back', 'loving', 'arms', 'once', 'again', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'many', 'boys', 'accept', 'girls', 'feelings', 'openly', 'lovingly', 'one', 'special', 'relationship.I', 'have', 'end', 'review', 'personal', 'note', 'saying', 'girl', 'who', 'porn', 'star', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'REALLY', 'gorgeous', 'role', 'was', 'attractive', 'hit', 'TV', 'show', '24', 'as', 'well', 'here', 'really', 'beautiful', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door.Quality', 'solid', 'storyline', 'right', 'actors', 'actresses', 'make', 'film', 'clear', 'winner']",N/A

You know, that movie where Tom Cruise was an uptight high school student who wanted to go to some Ivy League school who learns to say, well, ""f**k it"", by falling in love with a hooker with a heart of gold(are there any other kinds, really?) and defeating her pimp? Remember? Well, this movie ai'nt no ""Risky Business"".Here, Emile Hirsch, from the decent ""Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys"", plays an uptight high school student who dreams dreams of going to Georgetown who has to learn to say, well, uhm, ""f**k it"" when he falls in love with a porn star with a heart of gold(are there any other kinds really?) and has to defeat her producer(Timothy Olymphant).Oh, and do you remember when Tom Cruise had to come up with a lot of money before his parents came home so he decided to hold a party full of prostitutes? Well, in this movie, get this, Emile Hirsch has to come up with a lot of money by the end of a weekend by... well, I won't ruin the lovely surprise for you.""The Girl Next Door"" is a rip-off of ""Risky Business"". We get that. And that's all right, as long as you put an origanel spin on it, right? Well, not here.The director and screenwriters have a clear contempt for humanity. The film is so poorly written, executed, and for the most part, acting that I found myself counting the numerous continuity errors that pop up.The movie is poorly lit and shot, with a cheap look that a Lifetime movie surpasses. Choppy editing and cheap looking slow motion don't help, neither does the fact that none of the scenes flow into one another, which makes you think your watching a bunch of sub-par ""Saturday Night Live"" skits.And I could forgive this, almost, if I a)understood the actions of the actors or b)really cared, but the script never cares about stuff like realistic charactors or devolpment. Ha! thats for good movies!!! We are meant to believe that the Tom Cruise, oh crap, Emile Hirsch, charactor is willing to get beaten up, face down the probability of a prison sentance(though this plot devolpment is false) and do all other sorts of stupid things for a girl he, nor we, get to know. The title charctor, played by Elisha Cuthbert who has confused acting with pouting and trying to look pretty, is never a real charactor, merely a part of the lead charactors imagination.Oh, I forgot the two buddy charactors, a quiet, nebish guy who has to learn to like himself(oh, how nice a message) and an irriating, grating pervert who likes to watch porn with his friends and says some of the most horrendous lines in movie history that I actually crunged at the presumption. And I've seen ""Clerks"" a thousand times.I am an objective watcher, so I weill give props to Timothy Olymphant, who despite a crappy, sleazy charactor, gives a relativly good performance, although he is playing the same role he played in the much better ""Go"" from a few years back.""The Girl Next Door"" is sleazy, dirty, dumb, mean, unfunny and unrealistic.

623009,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00005JMX6,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[2, 2]","`the girl next door' directed by Luke Greenfield is a new rendition of the `Risky Business' plot adapted with the hindsight of watching a generation of John Hughes high school student movies. The movie is not quite a remake, but the story comes so close to the movie that launched Tom Cruise's career that comparisons are inevitable and very useful in evaluating the new movie.For starters, the lead male actor, Emile Hirsh, is only 17 years old, so he is totally convincing as a high school senior, because that is exactly what he is. He brings the kind of innocence and genuineness to the role that is very hard for an older actor to simulate. Unfortunately for this movie, he lacks Cruise's mischievous energy in `Risky Business', so that Hirsch never seems to quite rise above the 17 year old persona to make us believe he can pull off the stunt which saves him from the story's problem. The role of `the girl next door' is played well by Elisha Cuthbert who, unlike the known prostitute in `Risky Business' is a porn star, a fact unknown to the boy's character until well into the second act. This adds a new element to the story, but I'm afraid Ms. Cuthbert, who is a knockout to look at and a capable actor, does not quite generate the excitement I sensed with Rebecca DeMornay in `Risky Business'.In this story, the heavy is played by a business associate of the woman, a sex movie actor / producer rather than a pimp. And, although a fair amount of effort is made to hide the nature of the event that puts our hero into his pickle that drives the action in the third act, the eventual situation is as much a surprise as the sun's rising in the morning. And, it is made obvious as soon as the `Risky Business' plot line similarity is seen, if you did not happen to see this similarity prominently printed on the cover of the DVD case.Copying a story line from an earlier source does not necessarily mean the new version will be weaker. It only means that the game is not in any surprise in the main story line, but in how well you implement the plot. Virtually all historical dramas are based on this premise. Shakespeare built over a third of his output on the history of English kings as well known to his audience as we know about Roosevelt, Truman, and Eisenhower. He also used well-known fictional stories as in `The Taming of the Shrew' and `A MidSummer's Night Dream'. Homages to fictional story lines do have the advantage of being able to freely make changes to the plot. While the television drama `The Missiles of October' with William Devane and Martin Sheen and the recent '13 Days' with Kevin Costner handled the Cuban missile crisis in very different ways, they could not change the basic story line. `the girl next door' does succeed in a surprise at the end by which the teenager outsmarts the heavy, saves the day, brings his foreign student in from Cambodia, and ends up at Georgetown in a new BMW roadster. The result is no surprise whatsoever in a movie like this, only the way you get there.In general, the supporting cast is not quite as strong as in `Risky Business'. I was surprised to spot Timothy Bottoms appearing as the lad's father, a very small roll, enough to keep up with the rent after starring in some rather important 70's movies such as `The Paper Chase' and `The Last Picture Show'. The heavies are quirky and worth a few good surprises, but simply not as threatening as DeMornay's pimp.The screenplay and direction are capable, where much use of imagined fears of the lead character are played out as if they really happen, until we snap back to the actor's gazing into the middle distance after having played the scene out in his mind. These digressions contain one rather dramatic surprise, and I have mixed feelings on whether they add to the enjoyment or detract. I have a sense that the movie would have been better if the creative forces behind the movie had found a better way to deal with these points in the story.For no premium price, the DVD has my favorite feature, a voice-over commentary by the director. Unfortunately, the commentary is a solo act and simply is not as entertaining as, for example, several I have heard from Kevin Smith and his ensemble cast and producer.The selection of published music behind the action is complementary, but not very distinctive until very near the end, when we are hit by a surprise appearance of Donovan's `Atlantis' followed by the always dramatic The Who's `Baba O'Reilly' which has probably appeared in more movies and commercials now than the song `Singing in the Rain'.This is a good, enjoyable movie with good value to the extras on the DVD. It will not replace `Risky Business' among classic teen problem movies.",4,Another 'Risky Business' with a bit less zing than original,1093564800,"08 27, 2004",2004,4720,"['girl', 'next', 'door', 'directed', 'Luke', 'Greenfield', 'new', 'rendition', 'Risky', 'Business', 'plot', 'adapted', 'hindsight', 'watching', 'generation', 'John', 'Hughes', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'movies', 'movie', 'not', 'quite', 'remake', 'story', 'so', 'close', 'movie', 'launched', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'career', 'comparisons', 'are', 'inevitable', 'very', 'useful', 'evaluating', 'new', 'movie.For', 'starters', 'lead', 'male', 'actor', 'Emile', 'Hirsh', 'only', '17', 'years', 'old', 'totally', 'convincing', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'exactly', 'what', 'kind', 'innocence', 'genuineness', 'role', 'very', 'hard', 'older', 'actor', 'simulate', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'Cruise', 'mischievous', 'energy', 'Risky', 'Business', 'Hirsch', 'never', 'quite', 'rise', '17', 'year', 'old', 'persona', 'make', 'believe', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'stunt', 'story', 'problem', 'role', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'played', 'well', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'who', 'known', 'prostitute', 'Risky', 'Business', 'porn', 'star', 'fact', 'unknown', 'boy', 'character', 'well', 'second', 'act', 'new', 'element', 'story', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'Ms.', 'Cuthbert', 'who', 'knockout', 'look', 'capable', 'actor', 'not', 'quite', 'generate', 'excitement', 'sensed', 'Rebecca', 'DeMornay', 'Risky', ""Business'.In"", 'story', 'heavy', 'played', 'business', 'associate', 'woman', 'sex', 'movie', 'actor', '/', 'producer', 'rather', 'pimp', 'fair', 'amount', 'effort', 'made', 'hide', 'nature', 'event', 'hero', 'pickle', 'action', 'third', 'act', 'eventual', 'situation', 'as', 'much', 'surprise', 'sun', 'rising', 'morning', 'made', 'obvious', 'as', 'soon', 'Risky', 'Business', 'plot', 'line', 'similarity', 'seen', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'see', 'similarity', 'prominently', 'printed', 'cover', 'DVD', 'case.Copying', 'story', 'line', 'earlier', 'source', 'not', 'necessarily', 'mean', 'new', 'version', 'will', 'be', 'weaker', 'only', 'game', 'not', 'surprise', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'how', 'well', 'implement', 'plot', 'Virtually', 'historical', 'dramas', 'are', 'based', 'premise', 'Shakespeare', 'built', 'third', 'output', 'history', 'English', 'kings', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'audience', 'know', 'Roosevelt', 'Truman', 'Eisenhower', 'also', 'used', 'well-known', 'fictional', 'stories', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'MidSummer', 'Night', 'Dream', 'Homages', 'fictional', 'story', 'lines', 'do', 'have', 'advantage', 'being', 'able', 'freely', 'make', 'changes', 'plot', 'television', 'drama', 'Missiles', 'October', 'William', 'Devane', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'recent', 'Days', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'handled', 'Cuban', 'missile', 'crisis', 'very', 'different', 'ways', 'could', 'not', 'change', 'basic', 'story', 'line', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'succeed', 'surprise', 'end', 'teenager', 'heavy', 'day', 'foreign', 'student', 'Cambodia', 'up', 'Georgetown', 'new', 'BMW', 'roadster', 'result', 'surprise', 'whatsoever', 'movie', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'there.In', 'general', 'supporting', 'cast', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'strong', 'Risky', 'Business', 'was', 'surprised', 'spot', 'Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'appearing', 'lad', 'father', 'very', 'small', 'roll', 'enough', 'keep', 'up', 'rent', 'starring', 'rather', 'important', '70', 'movies', 'such', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'heavies', 'are', 'quirky', 'few', 'good', 'surprises', 'simply', 'not', 'as', 'threatening', 'DeMornay', 'pimp.The', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'are', 'capable', 'where', 'much', 'use', 'imagined', 'fears', 'lead', 'character', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'really', 'happen', 'snap', 'back', 'actor', 'gazing', 'middle', 'distance', 'having', 'played', 'scene', 'out', 'mind', 'digressions', 'contain', 'one', 'rather', 'dramatic', 'surprise', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'add', 'enjoyment', 'detract', 'have', 'sense', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'creative', 'forces', 'movie', 'had', 'found', 'better', 'way', 'deal', 'points', 'story.For', 'premium', 'price', 'DVD', 'favorite', 'feature', 'voice-over', 'commentary', 'director', 'Unfortunately', 'commentary', 'solo', 'act', 'simply', 'not', 'as', 'entertaining', 'example', 'several', 'have', 'heard', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'producer.The', 'selection', 'published', 'music', 'action', 'complementary', 'not', 'very', 'distinctive', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'are', 'hit', 'surprise', 'appearance', 'Donovan', 'Atlantis', 'followed', 'always', 'dramatic', 'Who', 'Baba', ""O'Reilly"", 'probably', 'appeared', 'more', 'movies', 'commercials', 'now', 'song', 'Singing', ""Rain'.This"", 'good', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'good', 'value', 'extras', 'DVD', 'will', 'not', 'replace', 'Risky', 'Business', 'classic', 'teen', 'problem', 'movies']",N/A

It's not as good as your ""American Pie"" or early 80's sex comedies (i.e. Porky's, Last American Virigin), but it does have a little bit of heart to go with all the overblown fluff.Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is just your everyday average nerdy senior- whose never even gotten close to getting laid. He's terribly envious of all the popular kids in school who seem to be having the time of their lives. Howver, he's so out of their league that he really is quite pathetic.Enter Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) the new girl next door. After Mathew lamely busts himself by getting caught watching Danielle change by the window, and a quick act of revenge by Danielle, the two become friends.Mathew is too much of a wimp to make a move on Danielle, but she eventually eases him out of his shell more and more each day. When at a party and one of the jocks begins hitting on Danielle, Matt finally makes his move and kisses Danielle.Looks like the kid has some balls after all! Good job Matt.Matt eventually finds out that Danielle is a washed up porn star, and she has moved in next door to start a new life as a clean and wholesome girl. That is until her ex boyfriend and manager Kelly (Timothy Olyphant)strolls into town to haul her off to the annual Las Vegas porn connection.After Matt blows Danielles cover and makes her feel like the tramp she once was, she decides to high tail it with Kelly. Matt is completely whipped over her by this point and begs her not to go -but alas, she bails anyways.Matts balls have gotten pretty big by now, and he takes off to rescue her from the clutches of her evil pimp. Eventually after Danielle returns home- Kelly comes back with a vengeance for Matt - causing him to lose the school funding he has been working on to bring a foreign exchange student to his school. He also manages to slip him some Ecstatsy - on the very night he has to give a speech in an attempt to gain the scholarship to college that he has worked so hard for.Nerds and porn stars eventually come together to hatch a plan to raise the money once again - this time by making their own porno right at their very own school.""The Girl Next Door"" is the kind of movie I would have enjoyed a lot more as a teenager than as an adult. Now grown up- you realize how far from reality this kind of stuff is--but as a kid- this would have been a fantasy flick that I would have killed to see come true in my own life.Overall stupid but enjoyable.Recommended for all you nerdy/horny teens with big dreams and not much else.......",3,Not the typical girl next door.....,1125446400,"08 31, 2005",2005,2554,"['movie', 'mindless', 'fun', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'American', 'Pie', 'early', '80', 'sex', 'comedies', 'i.e', 'Porky', 'Last', 'American', 'Virigin', 'have', 'little', 'bit', 'heart', 'go', 'overblown', 'fluff.Matthew', 'Kidman', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'just', 'everyday', 'average', 'nerdy', 'senior-', 'never', 'even', 'gotten', 'close', 'getting', 'laid', 'terribly', 'envious', 'popular', 'kids', 'school', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'time', 'lives', 'Howver', 'so', 'league', 'really', 'quite', 'pathetic.Enter', 'Danielle', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'new', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'Mathew', 'lamely', 'getting', 'caught', 'watching', 'Danielle', 'change', 'window', 'quick', 'act', 'revenge', 'Danielle', 'two', 'become', 'friends.Mathew', 'too', 'much', 'wimp', 'make', 'move', 'Danielle', 'eventually', 'shell', 'more', 'more', 'day', 'When', 'party', 'one', 'jocks', 'hitting', 'Danielle', 'Matt', 'finally', 'move', 'Danielle.Looks', 'kid', 'balls', 'Good', 'job', 'Matt.Matt', 'eventually', 'out', 'Danielle', 'washed', 'up', 'porn', 'star', 'moved', 'next', 'door', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'clean', 'wholesome', 'girl', 'ex', 'boyfriend', 'manager', 'Kelly', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'town', 'haul', 'off', 'annual', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'porn', 'connection.After', 'Matt', 'Danielles', 'cover', 'feel', 'tramp', 'once', 'was', 'high', 'tail', 'Kelly', 'Matt', 'completely', 'whipped', 'point', 'begs', 'not', 'go', '-but', 'alas', 'anyways.Matts', 'balls', 'have', 'gotten', 'pretty', 'big', 'now', 'rescue', 'clutches', 'evil', 'pimp', 'Eventually', 'Danielle', 'home-', 'Kelly', 'back', 'vengeance', 'Matt', 'causing', 'lose', 'school', 'funding', 'been', 'working', 'bring', 'foreign', 'exchange', 'student', 'school', 'also', 'slip', 'Ecstatsy', 'very', 'night', 'give', 'speech', 'attempt', 'gain', 'scholarship', 'college', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'for.Nerds', 'porn', 'stars', 'eventually', 'come', 'together', 'hatch', 'plan', 'raise', 'money', 'once', 'again', 'time', 'making', 'own', 'porno', 'right', 'very', 'own', 'school', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'kind', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'more', 'teenager', 'adult', 'Now', 'grown', 'up-', 'realize', 'how', 'far', 'reality', 'kind', 'stuff', 'kid-', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fantasy', 'flick', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'see', 'come', 'true', 'own', 'life.Overall', 'stupid', 'enjoyable.Recommended', 'nerdy/horny', 'teens', 'big', 'dreams', 'not', 'much', 'else']",N/A

Now, don't get me wrong with American Pie.  I loved the series, but it's been done too many times and it's tired.  So, naturally before I saw this I ha to check out the reviews.  Let's just say I was pleasantly surprised at it being called sweet and romantic.Well, the day finally came that I was going to see it.  In the past few months the reviews I read are either completely opposite or dead on in a bad way.  Not this time my friends!  As a guy, of course I didn't find it sweet or romantic, but I wasn't like the other ogres in the theater that hooted and hollered every time a girl came on-screen with little or nothing on either.  What i found really interesting and original about GND was that it did in thirty minutes what other romantic comedies take the entire two hours to accomplish yet at the same time gets you to like and care for the two lead characters, Matt and Danielle (Athena).  Also, another interesting aspect is the boy loses girl, boy gets girl back scenario embelished on.  In GND it's made into boy loses girl, boy gets girl, girl helps boy get stolen money back by helping him with a porn direction scam on prom night.The thing that surprised me most is that the female lead, played by the lovely and talented Elisha Cuthbert of 24, isn't really all that exposed to the camera if you catch what I mean.  That's another thing I liked about it was that it avoided being overly raunchy like American Pie but it rather made you laugh or made you want to yell ""Just kiss her!"" at the screen.  That is what made this movie such a big surprise.To some it all up, I'll just say I left GND with my mind totally elated because this movie made me so happy.  I saw it again for the second time two days later and it made me even happier watching it again.  It takes turns you may or may not see coming without being too predictable.  Of course you're going to guess certain plot points, but that's what makes the movie going experience so enjoyable.  It's wondering if you're right or not in your prediction.  This is the first film of the year that I actually liked.  Correction...  I loved it!  it's amazing!

This movie has some good moments in it, but it had some fundamental problems, the main one being that it couldn't decide what it wanted to be and it never truly captures the emotions intended.Was it a comedy? yes. Was it a drama about a girl who needed to be saved from the porn business? yes.There are some great moments in similar movies like RISKY BUSINESS and THE LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN, that manage to transform from comedy to drama AND THEY WORK!!! Is it the realism? Is it the direction? Is it the actors? Probaby a combination, but something is wrong with THE GIRL NEXT DOOR.Bottom line. THE GIRL NEXT DOOR is not all that great of a movie. The storyline is good, but not completely achieved. The comedy is okay, but never much better than that. The movie is about porn stars but not all that dirty.On the flip side... Elisha Cuthbert is drool inspiring, but her performance is hindered because she never really did anything all that dirty... so, the only reason I thought she was a porn star was because they told us she was.THE GIRL NEXT DOOR is just another movie in a long series of movies these days that don't really have the guts to be TRUE TO ITS SUBJECT.Boaz Davidson pushed the envelope with THE LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN and made a cult classic that was RISKY at the time to make. Amy Heckerling made a name for herself with a pull no punches movie named FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, and Tom Cruise became a star in the smash hit RISKY BUSINESS.THE GIRL NEXT DOOR didn't really do anything.

My senior year in high school was this movie, only turned down about 50 notches.  No, there were no porn stars or pimps.  But there was a girl I was crazy about who broke me out of my shell and taught me to live for another human is very liberating.  Perhaps too liberating as my relationship with her led to months of delinquency that finally crossed the line and brought an end to the trouble making.  I even had a virginal sex advisor.  Because of this I was sucked directly into this film and felt for the characters.  That said this is a good, but flawed film.  It has a tight script that works as a screwball comedy for horny teenage boys.  It is filed with hilarious scenes.  I especially liked the scene where Matthew had to give a speech while high on ecstasy.  The film also refuses to bend over for convention.  Yes, in the end it is a soft film.  However, it is not nearly as soft as its inspiration Risky Business.  Where that film tried to prevent us from stepping out of line by showing the consequences, this film tells out that the consequences are all a scam.  Sometimes you have to reject ""The Man"" to win the girl.  It is refreshing to hear that from a Hollywood movie.  It also had fun playing with the concept of what happens when tonnages run into their fantasies.  Porn stars seem to lose their appeal when their business associate robs you of $25,000 and sicks the cops on you.  There were a lot of problems that did prevent it from being great.  I didn't like its cloudy morality.  They spend tons of time spitting on the porn industry while exploiting its mystique to sell movie tickets.  Also, the scaremongering of the sex ed tapes are played for laughs but in the end I found myself asking myself if this was a sex ed video.  The answer is probably no, but it does do its fair share of scaremongering along the way. 3.25 out of 5",3,Unpredictable Fun,1103673600,"12 22, 2004",2004,1922,"['film', 'have', 'admit', 'hit', 'very', 'emotional', 'level', 'senior', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'movie', 'only', 'turned', 'down', 'about', '50', 'notches', 'No', 'were', 'porn', 'stars', 'pimps', 'was', 'girl', 'was', 'crazy', 'who', 'broke', 'shell', 'taught', 'live', 'human', 'very', 'liberating', 'Perhaps', 'too', 'liberating', 'relationship', 'led', 'months', 'delinquency', 'finally', 'crossed', 'line', 'brought', 'end', 'trouble', 'making', 'even', 'had', 'virginal', 'sex', 'advisor', 'was', 'sucked', 'directly', 'film', 'felt', 'characters', 'said', 'good', 'flawed', 'film', 'tight', 'script', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'horny', 'teenage', 'boys', 'filed', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'especially', 'liked', 'scene', 'where', 'Matthew', 'had', 'give', 'speech', 'high', 'ecstasy', 'film', 'also', 'bend', 'over', 'convention', 'Yes', 'end', 'soft', 'film', 'However', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'soft', 'inspiration', 'Risky', 'Business', 'Where', 'film', 'tried', 'prevent', 'stepping', 'line', 'showing', 'consequences', 'film', 'out', 'consequences', 'are', 'scam', 'Sometimes', 'have', 'reject', 'Man', 'win', 'girl', 'refreshing', 'hear', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'also', 'had', 'fun', 'playing', 'concept', 'what', 'when', 'tonnages', 'run', 'fantasies', 'Porn', 'seem', 'lose', 'appeal', 'when', 'business', 'associate', 'robs', '25,000', 'cops', 'were', 'lot', 'problems', 'did', 'prevent', 'being', 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'cloudy', 'morality', 'spend', 'tons', 'time', 'spitting', 'porn', 'industry', 'exploiting', 'mystique', 'sell', 'movie', 'tickets', 'Also', 'scaremongering', 'sex', 'ed', 'tapes', 'are', 'played', 'laughs', 'end', 'found', 'asking', 'was', 'sex', 'ed', 'video', 'answer', 'probably', 'do', 'fair', 'share', 'scaremongering', 'way', '3.25', '5']",N/A

623023,A364W6U6YL219D,B00005JMX6,"Craig Edwards ""Media Guy""","[2, 3]","The Girl Next Door (2004) I tend to enjoy movies where a world wise young woman introduces a nave young man to life and love. At the same time, I tend to be annoyed by movies that are set in or near the world of adult entertainment while maintaining a PG-13 rating. So, I had not seen this movie even though it has the basic plot layed out in the first sentence, mainly because it tries the feat mentioned in the second sentence. However, I finally gave in and watched after seeing bits and pieces on TV. The filmmakers have obviously seen Risky Business, as the movie follows that film's structure pretty closely throughout its running time. The story has Matthew (Emile Hirsch) a bright, hard working high school senior about to deliver a speech that he's sure will get him the scholarship he needs to go to the college of his choice. Then, his quiet and studious life gets turned upside down when his next door neighbor's niece Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) moves in to house sit while her aunt is away. Danielle pulls Matthew out of his quiet, staid world and in effect introduces him to life. He of course falls head over heels for her. Then the big plot complication rears its head. Matt's pal Eli (Chris Marquette) recognizes Danielle as a star of adult entertainment movies. From there the movie gets kind of flighty and a bit complicated, throwing in Danielle's producer/boyfriend, a charming but also menacing fellow named Kelly (Timothy Olyphant), the foreign student Matt's class is saving up to bring to America, another adult film producer (James Remar) and a trip to a porn convention in Las Vegas. And all of this noise takes away from the simple charms the movie had early on when it was just boy learning how great life is from girl, especially this girl, as Cuthbert is delectable in this role. By the time the lead trio of high schoolers is successfully meandering around that porn convention in Las Vegas with no one stopping them, the film becomes a kind of fantasy fable, and pretty much stays that way through the end of the film. It's watchable, but boy it could have been amazing if they'd built on the promise of the first half hour and kept it a quiet comedy-drama of first love. Oh well.

623024,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B00005JMX6,Cubist,"[4, 4]","If the American Pie movies were a new Millennium reworking of the Porky's films, then The Girl Next Door is Risky Business for the 21st Century. Whereas Risky Business was a reflection of the age of materialism that defined the 1980s, The Girl Next Door also represents its time by blending raunchy humour with romantic idealism. In a canny marketing ploy, Fox has released two versions of The Girl Next Door: the theatrical version and a slightly longer, unrated version with a bit more nudity included.The first disc features an audio commentary by the film's director, Luke Greenfield. He wanted to recreate the high school experience for an audience that was of that age or much older. Greenfield does a fine job of analyzing his own movie and explaining the autobiographical elements.Also included is the ""Trivia Track: Revealing the Girl Next Door"" with the occasional factoid popping up in the corners of the screen. However, they are mostly statistical in nature (i.e. ""More than 60% of people believe in love at first sight."").The second disc contains the bulk of the supplemental material. First up, is the ""Scene Specific Commentary by Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert."" He comments on four scenes while she talks over five.""The Eli Experience"" is a mock-featurette hosted by Christopher Marquette and follows his character (who has now become a porn film mogul) around.""A Look Next Door"" is a pretty standard Making Of featurette that mixes interview soundbites from the cast and crew with behind-the-scenes footage.Another standard feature, the ""Gag Reel,"" is included and features lots of blown lines, pratfalls and other hi-jinks that occurred during filming. Mildly amusing.There are also 16 deleted and extended scenes with an optional commentary track by Greenfield.Rounding out the disc is a ""Stills Gallery"" with production photos and a couple of trailers for the movie and for two other Fox films.While there are many similarities between The Girl Next Door and Risky Business, the former has much more heart than the latter. There is a sincere sweetness to this movie that Risky Business lacks. Again, this is indicative of the times each film was made in. However, The Girl Next Door is superior in one very significant way: the idealized woman is actually given some depth and dimension and isn't merely a sex object that fuels the man's fantasy as in Risky Business.",4,Risky Business for the New Millennium,1093824000,"08 30, 2004",2004,2391,"['American', 'Pie', 'movies', 'were', 'new', 'Millennium', 'reworking', 'Porky', 'films', 'then', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'Risky', 'Business', '21st', 'Century', 'Whereas', 'Risky', 'Business', 'was', 'reflection', 'age', 'materialism', 'defined', '1980s', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'also', 'time', 'blending', 'raunchy', 'humour', 'romantic', 'idealism', 'canny', 'marketing', 'ploy', 'Fox', 'released', 'two', 'versions', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'theatrical', 'version', 'slightly', 'longer', 'unrated', 'version', 'bit', 'more', 'nudity', 'included.The', 'first', 'features', 'audio', 'commentary', 'film', 'director', 'Luke', 'Greenfield', 'wanted', 'recreate', 'high', 'school', 'experience', 'audience', 'was', 'age', 'much', 'older', 'Greenfield', 'fine', 'job', 'analyzing', 'own', 'movie', 'explaining', 'autobiographical', 'elements.Also', 'included', 'Trivia', 'Track', 'Revealing', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'occasional', 'factoid', 'popping', 'up', 'corners', 'screen', 'However', 'are', 'mostly', 'statistical', 'nature', 'i.e', 'More', '60', '%', 'people', 'believe', 'love', 'first', 'sight', '.The', 'second', 'disc', 'bulk', 'supplemental', 'material', 'First', 'up', 'Scene', 'Specific', 'Commentary', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'comments', 'four', 'scenes', 'five', 'Eli', 'Experience', 'mock-featurette', 'hosted', 'Christopher', 'Marquette', 'character', 'who', 'now', 'become', 'porn', 'film', 'mogul', 'Look', 'Next', 'Door', 'pretty', 'standard', 'Making', 'featurette', 'mixes', 'interview', 'cast', 'crew', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage.Another', 'standard', 'feature', 'Gag', 'Reel', 'included', 'features', 'lots', 'blown', 'lines', 'pratfalls', 'other', 'hi-jinks', 'occurred', 'filming', 'Mildly', 'are', 'also', '16', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'optional', 'commentary', 'track', 'Greenfield.Rounding', 'out', 'disc', 'Stills', 'Gallery', 'production', 'photos', 'couple', 'trailers', 'movie', 'two', 'other', 'Fox', 'films.While', 'are', 'many', 'similarities', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'Risky', 'Business', 'former', 'much', 'more', 'heart', 'latter', 'sincere', 'sweetness', 'movie', 'Risky', 'Business', 'lacks', 'Again', 'indicative', 'times', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'However', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'superior', 'one', 'very', 'significant', 'way', 'idealized', 'woman', 'actually', 'given', 'depth', 'dimension', ""n't"", 'merely', 'sex', 'object', 'man', 'fantasy', 'Risky', 'Business']",N/A

Ok let me se...For a movie that is only 5 or 6 years old, the transfer shouldn't look older than it does. The transfer is just a modest upgrade of the less-than-reference quality picture included on the original DVD.Too much noise/grain and inconsistent color levels are the main offenders here, with the occasional edge enhancement creeping in as well. Night time and indoor scenes have the most issues, but our first reveal of Cuthbert in a wet, white shirt looks near-perfect, picture-wise. Colors are mostly set to a permanent dull hue, and in some instances are muddy, which is surprising given the quality of most Fox offerings. Trust me, this isn't blu-ray quality.So if you have the DVD version of it, stick to it and don't change it for the Blu-ray version, you can even find a DVD unrated adaptation of it, plus you won't loose money on it!As for the extras and unrated part:The 16 Deleted or Extended Scenes are definitely worth watching. You have a play all option with commentary from director Greenfield. One scene featured actress Amanda Swinton losing it when she had to put a condom on Klitz, who wore a fencing mask to do the scene. She struggles to keep a straight face and loses it at the end. Most were cut for pacing purposes, which is a shame, because a lot of these scenes had moments of genuine emotion that really humanized the movie. We also get the original ending that - get this - Greenfield cut because people at the test screenings thought Matthew was in the White House when he's standing in front of the Capitol Building...anyways...The movie's first trip on Blu comes with most of the bonus content present on the unrated SD release.* Audio Commentary by Luke Greenfield* Scene Specific Commentary by Emile Hirsch* Scene Specific Commentary by Elisha Cuthbert* ""The Eli Experience"" Featurette* ""A Look Next Door"" Making-Of Featurette* Gag Reel* Deleted and Extended Scenes (Including the Original Ending)* Theatrical Trailer, ""Dirty"" EditionThe only extra missing from the previous SD release is the Pop-Up trivia track, but viewers aren't missing much. The stand-outs here are the director's commentary and ""The Eli Experience"" featurette. The unrated version is nine minutes longer, but they are nine minutes that do nothing for the movie but increase its running time, and pad it out with an extra few seconds of nudity. So for you people, that means the disc gets the DVD equivalent to a Cable Ace award.""The Eli Experience"" is a riot. Chris Marquette, who plays Eli, goes to the Adult Industry Expo, held during CES, and mingles with the porn stars. In a Howard Stern moment, hulking ex-pro wrestler Matt 'Horshu' Wiese walks up to men at the expo asking them if they want to make out with him. Man this has to be seen!As for ""A Look Next Door"" is a standard making-of EPK, and the Gag Reel runs three minutes long as features many on-set screw ups.

623028,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B00005JMX6,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[122, 140]","There is a point in ""The Girl Next Door - Unrated Edition' (which I received and promptly devoured, extra's and all, in one sitting) where the movie is in danger of changing in tone and focus from American Pie to Showgirls,  but luckily for the movie - and viewers - it recovers itself and ends in a definite teen comedy spirit.I never saw this movie in the theater so I cannot comment on what has been added to this ""unrated edition"" but there is certainly quite a lot of nudity, but nothing involving the main actors. There are some graphic scenes at a strip club (including lap dancing) and we get shots of one of the main actors watching a porn video at home.  There are some nude scenes from behind of both principal actors Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert, but as Hirsch points out on Side B of the disc (where most of the extras are located) the movie used a stand-in for those shots.I have a word of caution regarding the list of extra's on the Amazon page. One is titled a scene specific commentary by Hirsch and Cuthbert. What we have here though is not a commentary for the whole movie from the two stars, but rather several scenes on the flip side of the disc in which the two actors both give separate commentary.Largely (and unjustly) ignored at the box office this teen comedy starts of really well and within the first few moments had me rolling with laughter. The movie starts with a montage of sorts, we see the jocks, brains and cheerleader-types all stating, for their entry in the yearbook, what they ""will always remember.""Then there is Matt (played by Hirsch) who is pondering this question. Sure, he has had a successful academic career - as illustrated by his acceptance to Georgetown - but he really hasn't done anything memorable in his senior year of high school.That's about to change for Matt though with the arrival next door of Danielle (played by Cuthbert), who plays a breathtaking beauty house-sitting for his neighbors.Entranced by her Matt is unable to stop himself from watching Danielle undress in the window opposite his bedroom - but he is spotted. From that moment he is on a rollercoaster ride. Danielle, amused and evidently attracted to Matt, shows him the excitement of living on the edge, from running naked through the streets to moonlight skinny dipping in his school principal's pool.Just as everything seems to be going so well between Matt and Danielle, Matt is shocked when one of his best friends Eli (who is a connoisseur of porn movies and full of in-experienced sex advice) shows one of his porn movies - in which Danielle is the main star.Foolishly following some of his friends advice, the two part company and moments later the movie changes tack and takes on a decidedly darker and more serious tone as Matt becomes sucked into the shadowy world of the pornographic movie industry.What follows is both inventive and highly amusing. How will Matt afford to get into Georgetown? What will become of Danielle? These are just some of the questions in this entertaining movie that borrows heavily and liberally from a number of the John Hughes movies of the 1980s and the AMERICAN PIE movies of more recent years. The movie ends on a high note in a conclusion that is both satisfying and enjoyable.Now onto the part that most readers of this review are more interested in - the extra's. On Side A of the disc we have an OK director's commentary from director Luke Greenfield and an at times amusing and at other times fascinating trivia track.Then on Side B of the disc we have the aforementioned seven to eight scene specific commentaries from Hirsch and Cuthbert (Hirsch curiously has one more) and deleted and extended scenes with optional directors commentary. None of these scenes are of any particular value to anyone but completists or fans of the movie. They add nothing to the feature, but do have a curiosity factor to them. They also chose the better of the two endings also.Of more interest is an amusing featurette in which actor Chris Marquette (who plays Eli in the movie) poses as a porn producer and lures in all too interested men (there'e a cute blonde on the bed afterall) who get decidedly less interested (for the most part) when the girl is replaced by a big burly guy.We are also offered a stills gallery and a VERY short gag reel as well as trailers for a couple of other like-minded movies in addition to one promotional trailer for several other Fox titles. There is also a trailer for THE GIRL NEXT DOOR with the subtitle `Dirrrty,' which in reality isn't really that much of a big deal.All in all, this is a good and entertaining movie, it seems to lose its footing half way through but successfully and engagingly returns to top form before the final credits roll. This is a definite must-buy for fans of the movie and the genre and certainly great entertainment",4,Saw a review copy - loved this entertaining comedy drama,1092268800,"08 12, 2004",2004,4848,"['point', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'Unrated', 'Edition', 'received', 'promptly', 'devoured', 'extra', 'one', 'sitting', 'where', 'movie', 'danger', 'changing', 'tone', 'focus', 'American', 'Pie', 'Showgirls', 'luckily', 'movie', 'viewers', 'definite', 'teen', 'comedy', 'spirit.I', 'never', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'been', 'added', 'unrated', 'edition', 'certainly', 'quite', 'lot', 'nudity', 'nothing', 'involving', 'main', 'actors', 'are', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'strip', 'club', 'including', 'lap', 'dancing', 'get', 'shots', 'one', 'main', 'actors', 'watching', 'porn', 'video', 'home', 'are', 'nude', 'scenes', 'principal', 'actors', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'Hirsch', 'out', 'Side', 'B', 'disc', 'where', 'most', 'extras', 'are', 'located', 'movie', 'used', 'stand-in', 'shots.I', 'have', 'word', 'caution', 'regarding', 'list', 'extra', 'Amazon', 'page', 'One', 'titled', 'scene', 'specific', 'commentary', 'Hirsch', 'Cuthbert', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'though', 'not', 'commentary', 'whole', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'rather', 'several', 'scenes', 'flip', 'side', 'disc', 'two', 'actors', 'give', 'separate', 'commentary.Largely', 'unjustly', 'ignored', 'box', 'office', 'teen', 'comedy', 'starts', 'really', 'well', 'first', 'few', 'moments', 'had', 'rolling', 'laughter', 'movie', 'montage', 'sorts', 'see', 'jocks', 'brains', 'cheerleader-types', 'stating', 'entry', 'yearbook', 'what', 'will', 'always', 'remember', 'Then', 'Matt', 'played', 'Hirsch', 'who', 'pondering', 'question', 'Sure', 'had', 'successful', 'academic', 'career', 'illustrated', 'acceptance', 'Georgetown', 'really', ""n't"", 'done', 'anything', 'memorable', 'senior', 'year', 'high', 'school.That', 'change', 'Matt', 'arrival', 'next', 'door', 'Danielle', 'played', 'Cuthbert', 'who', 'breathtaking', 'beauty', 'house-sitting', 'neighbors.Entranced', 'Matt', 'unable', 'stop', 'watching', 'Danielle', 'undress', 'window', 'bedroom', 'spotted', 'moment', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'Danielle', 'amused', 'evidently', 'attracted', 'Matt', 'excitement', 'living', 'edge', 'running', 'naked', 'streets', 'moonlight', 'skinny', 'dipping', 'school', 'principal', 'pool.Just', 'everything', 'be', 'going', 'so', 'well', 'Matt', 'Danielle', 'Matt', 'shocked', 'when', 'one', 'best', 'friends', 'Eli', 'who', 'connoisseur', 'porn', 'movies', 'full', 'in-experienced', 'sex', 'advice', 'one', 'porn', 'movies', 'Danielle', 'main', 'star.Foolishly', 'following', 'friends', 'advice', 'two', 'part', 'company', 'moments', 'later', 'movie', 'tack', 'decidedly', 'darker', 'more', 'serious', 'tone', 'Matt', 'sucked', 'shadowy', 'world', 'pornographic', 'movie', 'industry.What', 'inventive', 'highly', 'amusing', 'How', 'will', 'Matt', 'afford', 'get', 'Georgetown', 'What', 'will', 'become', 'Danielle', 'are', 'just', 'questions', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'heavily', 'liberally', 'number', 'John', 'Hughes', 'movies', '1980s', 'AMERICAN', 'PIE', 'movies', 'more', 'recent', 'years', 'movie', 'high', 'note', 'conclusion', 'satisfying', 'enjoyable.Now', 'part', 'most', 'readers', 'review', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'extra', 'Side', 'A', 'disc', 'have', 'OK', 'director', 'commentary', 'director', 'Luke', 'Greenfield', 'times', 'amusing', 'other', 'times', 'fascinating', 'trivia', 'track.Then', 'Side', 'B', 'disc', 'have', 'aforementioned', 'seven', 'eight', 'scene', 'specific', 'commentaries', 'Hirsch', 'Cuthbert', 'Hirsch', 'curiously', 'one', 'more', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'optional', 'directors', 'commentary', 'None', 'scenes', 'are', 'particular', 'value', 'anyone', 'completists', 'fans', 'movie', 'add', 'nothing', 'feature', 'do', 'have', 'curiosity', 'factor', 'also', 'chose', 'better', 'two', 'endings', 'also.Of', 'more', 'interest', 'amusing', 'featurette', 'actor', 'Chris', 'Marquette', 'who', 'Eli', 'movie', 'porn', 'producer', 'lures', 'too', 'interested', 'men', 'e', 'cute', 'blonde', 'bed', 'afterall', 'who', 'get', 'decidedly', 'less', 'interested', 'most', 'part', 'when', 'girl', 'replaced', 'big', 'burly', 'guy.We', 'are', 'also', 'offered', 'stills', 'gallery', 'VERY', 'short', 'gag', 'reel', 'as', 'well', 'trailers', 'couple', 'other', 'like-minded', 'movies', 'addition', 'one', 'promotional', 'trailer', 'several', 'other', 'Fox', 'titles', 'also', 'trailer', 'THE', 'GIRL', 'NEXT', 'DOOR', 'subtitle', 'Dirrrty', 'reality', ""n't"", 'really', 'much', 'big', 'deal.All', 'good', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'lose', 'footing', 'half', 'way', 'successfully', 'engagingly', 'returns', 'top', 'form', 'final', 'credits', 'roll', 'definite', 'must-buy', 'fans', 'movie', 'genre', 'certainly', 'great', 'entertainment']",N/A

From the cover I was thinking it would be something along the same lines of THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY.  While there certainly were elements here & there of slapstick comedy, for the most part this film was nothing like that.Instead, THE GIRL NEXT DOOR is a sort of dark comedy.  It seems to always hold about 60% disturbing plot and 40% comedy.  It is a bizarre mix, but it works.  After watching this film I felt different than I've felt watching any DVD the past 5 years.Elisha Cuthbert is dazzling as a beauty who lives next door.  She also just so happens to be a porn star.  Who would have thought?  Timothy Olyphant gives the strongest performance of the movie.  This is important as his pivotal role is the one on which the rest of the film swivels back & forth.For some reasons the story had a very 1980s feel to it.  For one, during the 80s the world of pornography was depicted as having a very dark underbelly.  Which, perhaps, it did.  While this may still be true to some extent these days, it is not nearly so entrenched in people's minds as it used to be.As for the DVD being unrated, I didn't see anything out of the ordinary that would warrant that rating.  I have not seen the ""R"" rated version so I don't have any grounds to compare the two.

623038,A2TI8XP8GY1RO1,B00005JMX6,DukeOfEarl,"[10, 13]","I basically just bought this movie because Elisha Cuthbrest was in it and she is one of the most gorgeous, freshest faces in Hollywood (in my mind) for quite some time. While my friends still eat up dime-a-dozen high-school and college comedies (as well as simplistic, style over substance action movies) I have begun to resent these types of movies as an actor myself. I now dissect every film's plots and acting much more than I ever did and much more than the average filmgoer, and it appalls me how people will flock to movies that basically tread on familiar, yet hard to point out, territory. The best years are definitely behind Hollywood until a whole new generation of fresh-thinking, visionary actors, directors, writers, and producers emerges.Okay, this movie does cover a lot of familiar territory. Although I admit I liked it much more than I thought I would. Actually I was really into it but the ending seemed to be too convenient, and everything worked out too perfectly with some questions unanswered. In retrospect, I can point out a few flaws before the ending as well.  The acting performances are about as good as you're gonna get out of young, inexperienced actors, and the guy who played the porn producer Kelly, did a remarkable job I thought.There were only laughs occasionally (some really big ones at times), but I remember at one extended point in particular (the scene with Matthew and Kelly breaking into the house) where it didn't feel like a comedy at all. So this can be a good or a bad thing. The relationship between Matthew and Danielle was really underdeveloped I believe. He was so nervous around her, and then he kisses her at a party and next thing you know they're all lovey-dovey. She goes away to Las Vegas trying to forget him, and comes back to him and next thing you know lovey-dovey. You don't see any conversation or nothing explaining their feelings and changes of heart. Plus, Matthew never really declares that he loves Danielle, not Danielle the porn star.Overall, I liked this film enough to watch it a few times. It may have been done before, but I like the idea of an innocent, all-work-no-play type of kid going out on a limb for the beautiful, living-life-too-fast-no-more type of girl. It just squeezes itself out of that dime-a-dozen comedy category. I prefer this mightily to those overrated, fantasized tales of the American Pie movies, Eurotrip, etc., etc. which are easy attempts to cash in on the ignorance and shallowness of the mainstream young moviegoer.

The answer to that question is no! It was shame too, because it had such a great idea, but it was not exacuted properly at all. The entire movie just tried to be as dirty as possible, and that's how these kind of movies should work. This is the movie that ""American Pie"" was smart enough to stay away from. At least that movie had a little heart, and whenever this movie tried to have some heart. . . it did it in a dirty way. I'm sure alot of people would like it better than I did, but this was just painful to watch. Typical teen movie acting to-bad. The best preformance came from Timolthy Olyphant, because he had some charm, and I believed him throughout the movie.The movie stars Emile Hirsch as Matthew, a senior in high school, who hangs out with friends Klitz and Eli. All three of them are pretty much obsessed with sex and everything about it, but of course they don't have any experience in the act. So, they make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night. . . no I'm kidding. Matthew finds out that his next door neighbor is having their house watched by Danielle. She and Matthew begin to hang with each other, and they begin to develop some kind of relationship. That is, until his friends make a shocking discovery. They find out that Danielle was a former porn star, and when she finds out that he knows, he is only disappointed for her. They relationship faulters, and when she is taken away by her producer Kelly to the convention with all of the other porn stars. Matthew goes to rescue her, but Kelly doesn't like that because she is a big money-maker in the business, so he decides to destroy Matthrew through his school work, including taking the money that was going to bring a foreign exchange student into the country, and through his affection for Danielle.Don't be a sucker for an idea, it's how the movie works, and ""The Girl Next Door"" doesn't work at all. First Matthew and Danielle like each other, then she doesn't like him, then she likes him again. It keeps changing, and it becomes hard to root for them to be together, but in the end, you just don't care. The laughs are not to be had in this movie, and from the very beginning I saw a rocky future ahead. Elisha Cuthburt is overrated, in both looks and acting, and I don't see much coming for her. This is by far, at this point, the worst movie of the year, and I could feel so many young adults reading this right now and yelling at me.

The soundtrack in the opening scenes of The Girl Next Door was used in Risky Business, and the plot similarities are there as well.  Once again, we have a young man, in this case more precocious than the Cruise character, who encounters the sex industry before he actually enjoys sex.  Emile Hirsch has aspirations of attending Georgetown, where the good Jesuits would frown on his forays into the porn industry, and is swept away by a vision of an ""angel,"" as he refers to her, in the form of the Elisha Cuthbert, house-sitting at the neighbors.  Despite Hirsch's obvious intellectual talents, Cuthbert's character is wiser in the ways of the world, having earned a prominent position as a star in the closed world of porn.  So, Hirsch's character falls in love with Cuthbert's character, and then incurs the wrath of her porn pimp, Timothy Olyphant.  Olyphant's performance is nothing short of brilliant. Hirsch on ectasy during the dinner in which he is a speaker competing with other speakers for a scholarship to GU is almost funny, until at the pivotal moment of his speech Hirsch is no longer looped, but instantly profound and serious. At any rate, this is a fun film and audiences who are not uncomfortable with sex in the cinema will find much here to enjoy.

Granted, his character is supposed to be a bit of a loser at the beginning of the movie, but even when he's supposed to NOT be a loser, he's still without any screen charisma. If you compare his performance to Tom Cruise in ""Risky Business"" (and how can you not, really?), Tom Cruise was a loser, but right from the start you liked him. Emile Hirsch just doesn't have that...My main problem with the movie, though, is that it the whole message is supposed to be how Emile Hirsch is so in love with Elisha Cuthbert and sees beyond her ""Porn Star"" past to the real person inside.. when she considers going back to doing porn, he tells her ""You're better than this."" and later she asks ""Why do you believe in me so much?"" That's all fine and well, but at the same time, it seems like there's nothing really to her character beyond the fact that she's really, really hot looking and that because she' s so good-looking, her being with Emile gives him all this status and power that he didn't have before. I mean, what is it that he likes about her aside from the fact that she's really sexy and he loves having a sexy girlfriend? What else is there to her character? Before he had a porn star girlfriend, Emile didn't get any respect from anyone at the school. After he starts dating her, all the jocks and everyone are really jealous of him and so he feels more confident and takes more risks in life. So, yeah, I can see why he likes being with her and would do all this stuff to keep her with him instead of letting her go back to porn. But is that really supposed to be love?""The Girl Next Door"" has some funny bits (when they go to the dinner for the scholarship speeches, the sex education film they show at this school, and maybe a couple of other moments that I can't recall) but a lot of it is really kind of dull, due to a weak lead actor, and the ""message"" of the movie comes across as insincere, at best...",3,Not Quite Worth the Squeeze...,1096761600,"10 3, 2004",2004,2268,"['Given', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', ""n't"", 'trying', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'modern-day', 'Risky', 'Business', 'least', 'halfway', 'enjoyable..', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'good', 'job', 'looking', 'yummy', 'not', 'nearly', 'annoying', 'here', 'character', '24', 'villain', 'movie', 'lot', 'fun', 'main', 'actor', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'kind', 'dud', 'Granted', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'bit', 'loser', 'beginning', 'movie', 'even', 'when', 'supposed', 'NOT', 'be', 'loser', 'still', 'screen', 'charisma', 'compare', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Risky', 'Business', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'was', 'loser', 'right', 'start', 'liked', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'whole', 'message', 'supposed', 'be', 'how', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'so', 'love', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'Porn', 'Star', 'past', 'real', 'person', 'inside..', 'when', 'going', 'back', 'doing', 'porn', ""'re"", 'better', 'later', 'Why', 'do', 'believe', 'so', 'much', 'fine', 'well', 'same', 'time', 'nothing', 'really', 'character', 'fact', 'really', 'really', 'hot', 'looking', 's', 'so', 'good-looking', 'being', 'Emile', 'status', 'power', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'mean', 'what', 'aside', 'fact', 'really', 'sexy', 'having', 'sexy', 'girlfriend', 'What', 'else', 'there', 'character', 'had', 'porn', 'star', 'girlfriend', 'Emile', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'respect', 'anyone', 'school', 'dating', 'jocks', 'everyone', 'are', 'really', 'jealous', 'so', 'more', 'confident', 'more', 'risks', 'life', 'So', 'yeah', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'being', 'would', 'do', 'stuff', 'keep', 'instead', 'letting', 'go', 'back', 'porn', 'really', 'supposed', 'be', 'love', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'funny', 'bits', 'when', 'go', 'dinner', 'scholarship', 'speeches', 'sex', 'education', 'film', 'show', 'school', 'maybe', 'couple', 'other', 'moments', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'lot', 'really', 'kind', 'dull', 'due', 'weak', 'lead', 'actor', 'message', 'movie', 'insincere', 'best']",N/A

623050,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JMX6,Grady Harp,"[5, 6]","THE GIRL NEXT DOOR looks for all the ""Unrated Version"" stamps that unfortunately hide the figure of Elisha Cuthbert on the DVD box like this is a moron audience directed chick flick.  But inside the poorly advertised trappings is a nice little light film that is far better than the average movie aimed at the school age audience.  Credit director Luke Greenfield and his writers David Wagner and Brent Goldberg for instilling some sense of dignity and tenderness into this story about hormone-pumping highschool kids.Much of the success of this film must also be credited to Emile Hirsch who is surfacing as an actor to watch (if anyone has a chance to see him in THE MUDGE BOY you'll know what I mean).  He plays Matthew, a bright but naive highschool senior who depends more on his brain than his sexual prowess to make it through school.  His two fellow nerdy friends Eli (Chris Marquette) and Klitz (Paul Dano) may always be on the lookout for their first sexual experience, but the three boys do represent the saner side of teenage life.The story involves a new neighbor for Matt, one Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert), an ex-porn star who moves next door to housesit.  Slowly Danielle entices Matt into showing her around her new town, plays a few cute tricks on him until the playing field is level, and their adventure can begin.Trouble enters when Danielle's 'producer' Kelly (Timothy Olyphant) appears to re-claim his 'property' and Matt discovers Danielle's background.  The remainder of the film deals with how Danielle and Matt interact with Eli, Klitz and the entire highschool bunch and involve the town in a staged scandal that has its own rewards.The dialogue is fairly clever and more interested in matters of the heart than in matters of the toilet, and in the end there is much to be said for the philosophical stance the story takes.  The acting is good to excellent (especially fine are Hirsch, Cuthbert, Olyphant, Marquette and Dano) and the pacing is brisk and warmly entertaining.  I'm not sure why the 'Unrated' label is placed because this is a rather tame movie despite its subject matter.  If it is there as a marketing ploy, it didn't work in the theaters.  Maybe it will have a happier life as a DVD!

623051,A26LWI9RAR7RX7,B00005JMX6,In Search Of...,"[4, 5]","Risky Business knockoff yes. Entertaining? A resounding yes.This movie is pretty much a Risky Business 2004 but with an even more enjoyable flavor.First of all the soundtrack is fantastic. However, most of the key music is NOT included in the official soundtrack! David Gray's This Year's Love is not even on it! Even the depressing but excellent closing credit song Maybe You're Gone isn't included!Emile Hirsch as Matt does a pretty good job of being that uptight HS kid that wants to experience the carefree lifestyle of his fellow student body.What really makes this movie is Elisha Cuthbert. Incredible, simply incredible. I'll be the first admit that I bought the movie just from seeing her in the previews. What I did not expect was that she would take her meagerly scripted character and make it glow brighter than the sun. She took every scene she was in and showed she can act. Her subtle facial gestures and delivery of lines in some dramatic scenes like the motel room really showed me something. She is so much more than simple eye-candy although I'm pretty sure that alone will endear her to many fans. I can't wait to see her in a movie where she actually gets to showcase more of her acting talent. She is simply stunning on the big screen.Timothy Olyphant as Kelly the producer offered that edge in the movie. He was also brilliant in his unpredictable character strip. Kelly was a ""charming jerk"". He really stole some scenes.Emile's sidekicks were also a good cast. They offered funny moments and most kids growing must have had one of those two types of friends at one point in their life.The movie was definitely at the far end of escapism with it's mix of comedy, drama, and romance blended together but it works for this movie.

623052,A14JEURPY1CXZB,B00005JMX6,James D. Leverton,"[4, 5]","What is it with critics nowadays? They fall all over themselves praising the &quot;American Pie&quot; films, in which morons drink bodily fluids and make love to apple pies and girls exist mainly to have sex with. (Maybe that's too harsh, but you get the point.) Then &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot; opens and you'd think it's the sleaziest piece of trash in the history of cinema, simply because the TV ads were deceptive and didn't mention that one of the main characters is a porn star. Ebert and Roeper were especially hard on it, using words like&quot;despicable&quot; to describe it. Come on, now. I'm a sensitive guy and believe me, &quot;The Girl Next Door,&quot; while hardly a great film, is not nearly that bad. Actually, at times it is quite funny and no more offensive than the film that clearly inspired it, namely 1984's &quot;Risky Business.&quot; And it has several superior performances by a promising young cast anchoring the silliness.The wonderful young actor Emile Hirsch stars as Matthew Kidman, his school's senior class president who feels he has wasted his high school career studying and is ready to cut loose and party with his two horny (and nerdy) best friends. Then he sees the ravishingly beautiful Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert of TV's &quot;24&quot;), who has just moved in next door. They meet cute and start dating, until Matthew finds out she is a retired porn star. Then her sleazeball &quot;producer&quot; (Timothy Olyphant) shows up and forces her back into the biz, so Matthew takes it upon himself to save her from such an unsavory lifestyle.That's the gist of it. That's what so many critics are riled up about. In &quot;Risky Business&quot; Tom Cruise and prostitute Rebecca DeMornay operate a bordello in Cruise's parents' house. Here, the hero is trying to rescue his beloved from the sex trade. How offensive! Yes, the porn industry is not presented in nearly as sleazy a light as it probably is, and Cuthbert is not exactly believably worldly as the porn star. And the ending does go way off the deep end when Matthew and his friends hatch a scheme and attempt to pull it off during the senior prom, culminating in a plot twist that is unbelievably ridiculous to say the least. But then, the film is rated &quot;R&quot; for a reason. It's an adult fantasy, much in the same way &quot;Risky Business&quot; was, although not quite as good.As I said, Cuthbert isn't believable as a porn star, but she exhibits strong screen presence and makes a better impression in 100-or-so minutes than she has in three seasons as the dippy, annoyingly stupid Kim Bauer on &quot;24.&quot; And Olyphant is typically sleazy, quite funny and even scarily unhinged as the producer/pimp, while Christopher Marquette (TV's &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot;) is an absolute hoot as Matthew's sex-obsessed, foul-mouthed friend and Paul Dano, the terrific young actor from &quot;L.I.E.&quot;, scores solidly as a shy introvert named Klitz. (Yes, that's really his name!) But the film clearly belongs to Emile Hirsch, who I feel is quite simply the most exciting young talent to come out of Hollywood since, well, Tom Cruise. And he's a better actor, to boot. Witness his roles in &quot;The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys&quot; and &quot;The Emperors' Club,&quot; then compare them to this one and, especially, his remarkable work in the strange and little seen wonder &quot;The Mudge Boy.&quot; You may well find it hard to believe that the disarmingly handsome Matthew and the strange, goofy-looking oddball Duncan Mudge are played by the same young man, who changes his looks not through makeup but simply by the way he clenches his jaw and uses his eyes. He is a talent to watch and a possible superstar-in-the-making.In short, &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot; has cult-classic potential written all over it. It looks great, it's fast-paced, and it features five young actors who should have long and fruitful careers ahead of them. Forget the fuddy-duddy critics. They're over-the-top on this one. &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot; isn't for everyone, but for those who are game, it rocks. ****",4,Critics!

Sure, it's a typical attempt to remake Risky Business, with a young, charismatic young man getting involved with a beautiful, mysterious young woman; however, there are enough twists and turns to keep it interesting.Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is the typical over-achiever in high school.  He's in all sorts of clubs, AP classes, and never seems to have the care-free fun that the rest of his fellow seniors are having.  He's even gone so far as to start a fund to bring a Cambodian, teenage genius to America.  His whole world changes when Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) moves in next door.In a matter of no time it becomes clear that Danielle is a former porn star - discovered by Matthew's porn-obsessed friend Eli (Chris Marquette) - and she has a world of experience and knowledge that are going to broaden Matthew's horizons on more than one level.Danielle wants out of the porn business, but her sleazy producer Kelly (Timothy Olyphant) wants the exact opposite.  It's soon a battle of influence, as Matthew tugs at Danielle's heart-strings, while Kelly tugs at her through the type of power typically given to those who would dominate over another psychologically.

Whereas we all pretty much know what's going to happen in most teen comedy movies, The Girl Next Door gives a fresh take on the genre.The climax at the prom (pun intended) was a brilliant way to conclude the movie, squeeze a few gorgeous women into the movie (Sung Hi Lee cameo), and provide a combination of comedy and real drama.It would be a travesty if I didn't mention the fact that the ""Eli Experience"", the eventual producing empire formed by Eli as part of a whirlwind surprise ending, is clearly my favorite part of the movie.

It takes the Risky Business script and edits it. The hooker role is now a pornstar and the pimp role is now a porn producer. However Elisha Cuthbert (24, Old School) and Timothy Olyphant (Scream 2, Go!) play them very well, especially Olyphant. He takes the part and does something with it. He makes his character scary and pretty damn funny as well. He makes this his move the second he appears on screen. Since Go! I always saw him as one of the most talented under used actors and he proves that he is here. He's why I mostly don't think the movie is bad. Him and Elisha Cuthbert make it worth watching and almost make you forget it's not a fresh idea. I think Emile Hirsch got too much abuse in the reviews.

623068,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00005JMX6,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[15, 17]","Teen comedies always turn up big business at the box office, this is generally due to the fact that the creative forces behind these movies include plenty of crude humor, sex, and nudity as can be allowed under the MPAA ratings system.  Most of the time these teen comedies are a dime-a-dozen, opening big and fading shortly thereafter, with little lasting appeal with audiences.  However, there have been some successes in the genre that have had more staying power than others, examples would be ""Animal House"", the `Scary Movie' franchise, and the `American Pie' series.  With those examples of successful teen comedies, they all have some common traits in which they share, basically they are packed full of sex, nudity, and crude humor and language.  However, one thing these examples of successful teen comedies, and even the unsuccessful ones lack is any amount of heart or soul in the story.  In 2004, Fox Studios produced yet another teen comedy to appease the masses for a short while, ""The Girl Next Door"".  Starring Elisha Cuthbert (TV's ""24"") and an unknown lead actor named Emile Hirsch, ""The Girl Next Door"" would stand out from the other teen comedies that have come before it or even after it, for this movie contained the one thing that I said was lacking in those others, that is heart and soul.""The Girl Next Door"" is the story of 18-year-old Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch), a straight-laced, overachieving, good boy who has never really lived life to the fullest.  That is, until he spies his incredibly sexy neighbor (Elisha Cuthbert) changing in the window, and finds that through his desire to be with her, he will do anything and everything to be with her.  But, Matthew gets thrown for somewhat of a loop when he discovers that his perfect `girl next door' is actually a former porn star, who is trying to forget about the life she used to lead.  Now, Matthew's sheltered life quickly begins to spin out of control as he attempts to help his new girlfriend leave the life she knew to embrace the life she longs for.The reason I feel this movie is far and above those other teen comedies I listed, some of which I enjoyed by the way, is like I said earlier ""The Girl Next Door"" contains plenty of heart and soul in its story.  This movie isn't simply about having sex, yes there is that obligatory teen comedy element in this movie, but this movie is actually about the discovery that sex isn't the only thing to look for in a relationship with someone.  To prove that point the main character in the story, Matthew, who by the way is played perfectly by Emile Hirsch, is forced to learn that to have a true meaningful relationship with a woman, he must get past his lustful desire to only want the physical body, with no regard for the emotional side of the woman.  A lesson he has to learn the hard way, and it forces his character to mature throughout the story, until finally he is able to have a committed relationship with this `girl next door', as he discovers that she is more than just a beautiful woman, and former porn star, and in fact that she is a person with real feelings.  And all she asks of Matthew is that he move past her former life and see her for who she truly is.The writing in this story is better than most contained in this type of movie, generally the story is fairly thin, and is pretty much there to link each crude joke to the next or to bridge the gap between sex scenes; however, in this movie the story is the main focus, yes there are the crude jokes and a couple of sex scenes, but the story isn't simply a minor plot device to get the audience to these obligatory teen comedy sequences.  The actors all do a very good job of bringing their characters to life, and appear to be enjoying themselves immensely with the roles they've been given.  Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsch share a great chemistry that helps to elevate this movie to almost a romantic comedy level, instead of just teen comedy.  Timothy Olyphant (""A Man Apart"" and ""Scream 2"") makes several appearances throughout the film as a shady porn producer, and he manages to steal almost every scene that he's in, and actually provides Matthew with some rather sage advice, though inadvertently I might add.If you are a fan of teen comedies, but are perhaps tired of the same old thing, then check out ""The Girl Next Door"", I promise you it is more than your average teen, gross-out sex comedy.""The Girl Next Door"" is available in both rated R and Unrated editions, both contain language and sexuality/nudity.",4,Fall For the Girl Next Door...,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,4532,"['Teen', 'comedies', 'always', 'turn', 'up', 'big', 'business', 'box', 'office', 'generally', 'due', 'fact', 'creative', 'forces', 'movies', 'include', 'plenty', 'crude', 'humor', 'sex', 'nudity', 'can', 'be', 'allowed', 'MPAA', 'ratings', 'system', 'Most', 'time', 'teen', 'comedies', 'are', 'dime-a-dozen', 'opening', 'big', 'fading', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'little', 'lasting', 'appeal', 'audiences', 'However', 'have', 'been', 'successes', 'genre', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'staying', 'power', 'others', 'examples', 'would', 'be', 'Animal', 'House', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'franchise', 'American', 'Pie', 'series', 'examples', 'successful', 'teen', 'comedies', 'have', 'common', 'traits', 'share', 'basically', 'are', 'packed', 'full', 'sex', 'nudity', 'crude', 'humor', 'language', 'However', 'one', 'thing', 'examples', 'successful', 'teen', 'comedies', 'even', 'unsuccessful', 'ones', 'lack', 'amount', 'heart', 'soul', 'story', '2004', 'Fox', 'Studios', 'produced', 'yet', 'teen', 'comedy', 'appease', 'masses', 'short', 'while', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'Starring', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'TV', '24', 'unknown', 'lead', 'actor', 'named', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'would', 'stand', 'out', 'other', 'teen', 'comedies', 'have', 'come', 'even', 'movie', 'contained', 'one', 'thing', 'said', 'was', 'lacking', 'others', 'heart', 'soul', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'story', '18-year-old', 'Matthew', 'Kidman', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'straight-laced', 'overachieving', 'good', 'boy', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'lived', 'life', 'fullest', 'incredibly', 'sexy', 'neighbor', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'changing', 'window', 'desire', 'be', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'everything', 'be', 'Matthew', 'thrown', 'somewhat', 'loop', 'when', 'perfect', 'girl', 'door', 'actually', 'former', 'porn', 'star', 'who', 'trying', 'forget', 'life', 'used', 'lead', 'Now', 'Matthew', 'sheltered', 'life', 'quickly', 'spin', 'control', 'help', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'leave', 'life', 'knew', 'embrace', 'life', 'for.The', 'reason', 'feel', 'movie', 'far', 'other', 'teen', 'comedies', 'listed', 'enjoyed', 'way', 'said', 'earlier', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'plenty', 'heart', 'soul', 'story', 'movie', ""n't"", 'simply', 'having', 'sex', 'yes', 'obligatory', 'teen', 'comedy', 'element', 'movie', 'movie', 'actually', 'discovery', 'sex', ""n't"", 'only', 'thing', 'look', 'relationship', 'someone', 'prove', 'point', 'main', 'character', 'story', 'Matthew', 'who', 'way', 'played', 'perfectly', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'forced', 'learn', 'have', 'true', 'meaningful', 'relationship', 'woman', 'must', 'get', 'lustful', 'desire', 'only', 'want', 'physical', 'body', 'regard', 'emotional', 'side', 'woman', 'lesson', 'learn', 'hard', 'way', 'character', 'mature', 'story', 'finally', 'able', 'have', 'committed', 'relationship', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'more', 'just', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'former', 'porn', 'star', 'fact', 'person', 'real', 'feelings', 'Matthew', 'move', 'former', 'life', 'see', 'who', 'truly', 'is.The', 'writing', 'story', 'better', 'most', 'contained', 'type', 'movie', 'generally', 'story', 'fairly', 'thin', 'pretty', 'much', 'there', 'link', 'crude', 'joke', 'next', 'bridge', 'gap', 'sex', 'scenes', 'however', 'movie', 'story', 'main', 'focus', 'yes', 'are', 'crude', 'jokes', 'couple', 'sex', 'scenes', 'story', ""n't"", 'simply', 'minor', 'plot', 'device', 'get', 'audience', 'obligatory', 'teen', 'comedy', 'sequences', 'actors', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'characters', 'life', 'appear', 'be', 'enjoying', 'immensely', 'roles', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'share', 'great', 'chemistry', 'elevate', 'movie', 'almost', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'level', 'instead', 'just', 'teen', 'comedy', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'Man', 'Apart', 'Scream', '2', 'several', 'appearances', 'film', 'shady', 'porn', 'producer', 'steal', 'almost', 'scene', 'actually', 'Matthew', 'rather', 'sage', 'advice', 'inadvertently', 'might', 'add.If', 'are', 'fan', 'teen', 'comedies', 'are', 'perhaps', 'tired', 'same', 'old', 'thing', 'then', 'check', 'out', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'promise', 'more', 'average', 'teen', 'gross-out', 'sex', 'comedy', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'available', 'rated', 'R', 'Unrated', 'editions', 'contain', 'language', 'sexuality/nudity']",N/A

Cockrel,"[6, 8]","Elisha Cuthbert's sweetly sexy presence can't save this half-baked, confused teen sex comedy.At it's heart, ""Girl Next Door"" wants to be a sort of ""Risky Business"" for the 21st Century.  But it lacks the intelligence and edginess of that film and the magnetism of a Tom Cruise in the lead role.I have to give props to Cuthbert, who is of course best known for playing Kim, the daughter of the hero of TV's ""24""(Keifer Sutherland as Jack Bauer).  I suspect her picking this part had more to do with showing she could act outside the confines of her good girl image than any love of the storyline.  Here she plays a 19-year old porn star with a heart of gold who wants to leave her past behind.But she's ultimately hampered by the weak script which can't decide if it wants to be a sex farce, a morality tale, or a straight romance.  Emile Hirsch, the neigbhor boy who falls in love with her at first sight lacks the gravity needed to serve as a convincing co-star.Furthermore, the movie's conclusion is just too unbelievable.  Granted the movie is basically structured as a wish fulfillment fantasy for horny teenage boys but this climax comes off as too neat, too tidy, and ultimately fake.If there's any reason to see this movie it's, believe it or not, not Cuthbert but Timothy Olyphant who nearly steals the movie as an oily, venomous porn flick producer.

623077,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JMX6,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[26, 35]","I can see where the 2004 film entitled ""The Girl Next Door"" (they have been making films with this title since 1914) would be squarely in the crosshairs of critics.  In this film, which obviously wants to be ""Risky Business"" for this generation the titular character turns out to be a porn star, whose real name is Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert, finally getting away from being daddy's little girl on ""24"").  Fortunately, Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch; bend your mind around the idea of him as the next Tom Cruise) falls in love with her at first sight and has to be informed of her vocation by his friend Eli (Chris Marquette; who is as far removed from his character on ""Joan of Arcadia"" as you can get).Now, on the one hand the idea of a teenage boy getting involved with a teenage porn star is rather offensive.  I mean just think about it in real world terms and unless you are a teenage boy there are some serious problems with this idea.  Add to this the fact that the trailers for this movie made it seem like this was another innocent teenage boy hooks up with slightly older beautiful woman (you know, the entire good boy meets hot girl sub-genre), so when you throw a bunch of ""adult film"" actresses into the mix it certainly violates expectations.  No wonder this movie was nominated for a Teen Choice Award as a Choice Movie Your Parents Didn't Want You to See.But what salvages this film is that it really is about the boy next door.  They keep telling us that Danielle is a porn star, and we see some rather tame clips from her films, but despite the encouragement of his friends to the contrary (and the one obligatory misstep) Matthew sees her as Danielle, the girl next door, and not the porn star.  So, since we like the kid, whose dream is to win a scholarship so he can afford to go to Georgetown, we are inclined to see her this way too.  Besides, it is not like she really acts like a porn star (fill in your own idea of what that would be, because whatever it is, she does not do it) and Cuthbert wisely stays away from full nudity, knowing full well it is sexier that way.In the end ""The Girl Next Door"" is really just a love story, which will not only surprise but also disappoint those who are looking for a raunchy teenage sex comedy.  Of course there are all sorts of ""Risky Business"" like complications involving $25,000 to bring the next Einstein to America from Cambodia and Danielle's producer Kelly (Timothy Olyphant, in a scene stealing role) who does not like the idea of some high school boy getting his girl to give up show business.  Kelly is as close as Luke Greenfield's film gets to the sleazy side of the adult entertainment film industry, but his idea of how to mess with the kid is more creative than violent and I really did like his reaction to the twist the film takes at the end.  I was wavering on whether to round up or down from the 3.5 this film was going to get from me, and that was enough to shift the scale towards the high end.In the end your ability to enjoy this film is going to come down to how much you like the two stars, whether you are offended there is not more sex, and how much it bothers you that ""The Girl Next Door"" follows the ""Risky Business"" playbook from start to finish.  The comedy is better than the sex and I was thinking more about the old Andy Hardy movies where the kids decide to put on a show during the end of this film as anything else.  Maybe it was wrong to laugh at some of the hijinks in this film, but that was what I was doing, although it seems strange to be giving credit to a movie for not going to far given all the opportunities that it has to do so.  But you do get credit for negotiating the curves in this world, which is why ""The Girl Next Door"" is probably going to become a late night cable cult classic (albeit in the ""rated"" version of the film).",4,"Yes, it rips off ""Risky Business"" but still a fun film",1093392000,"08 25, 2004",2004,3847,"['can', 'see', 'where', '2004', 'film', 'entitled', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'have', 'been', 'making', 'films', 'title', '1914', 'would', 'be', 'squarely', 'crosshairs', 'critics', 'film', 'obviously', 'be', 'Risky', 'Business', 'generation', 'titular', 'character', 'out', 'be', 'porn', 'star', 'real', 'name', 'Danielle', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'finally', 'getting', 'away', 'being', 'daddy', 'little', 'girl', '24', 'Fortunately', 'Matthew', 'Kidman', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'bend', 'mind', 'idea', 'next', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'be', 'informed', 'vocation', 'friend', 'Eli', 'Chris', 'Marquette', 'who', 'far', 'removed', 'character', 'Joan', 'Arcadia', 'can', 'get', '.Now', 'one', 'hand', 'idea', 'teenage', 'boy', 'getting', 'involved', 'teenage', 'porn', 'star', 'rather', 'offensive', 'mean', 'just', 'think', 'real', 'world', 'terms', 'are', 'teenage', 'boy', 'are', 'serious', 'problems', 'idea', 'Add', 'fact', 'trailers', 'movie', 'made', 'seem', 'was', 'innocent', 'teenage', 'boy', 'up', 'slightly', 'older', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'know', 'entire', 'good', 'boy', 'meets', 'hot', 'girl', 'sub-genre', 'so', 'when', 'throw', 'bunch', 'adult', 'film', 'mix', 'certainly', 'expectations', 'wonder', 'movie', 'was', 'nominated', 'Teen', 'Choice', 'Award', 'Choice', 'Movie', 'Parents', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Want', 'See.But', 'what', 'film', 'really', 'boy', 'next', 'door', 'keep', 'telling', 'Danielle', 'porn', 'star', 'see', 'rather', 'tame', 'clips', 'films', 'encouragement', 'friends', 'contrary', 'one', 'obligatory', 'misstep', 'Matthew', 'Danielle', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'not', 'porn', 'star', 'So', 'like', 'kid', 'dream', 'win', 'scholarship', 'can', 'afford', 'go', 'Georgetown', 'are', 'inclined', 'see', 'way', 'too', 'not', 'really', 'porn', 'star', 'fill', 'own', 'idea', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'whatever', 'not', 'do', 'Cuthbert', 'wisely', 'away', 'full', 'nudity', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'sexier', 'way.In', 'end', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'really', 'just', 'love', 'story', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'surprise', 'also', 'disappoint', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'raunchy', 'teenage', 'sex', 'comedy', 'course', 'are', 'sorts', 'Risky', 'Business', 'complications', 'involving', '25,000', 'bring', 'next', 'Einstein', 'America', 'Cambodia', 'Danielle', 'producer', 'Kelly', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'scene', 'stealing', 'role', 'who', 'not', 'idea', 'high', 'school', 'getting', 'girl', 'give', 'up', 'show', 'business', 'Kelly', 'as', 'close', 'Luke', 'Greenfield', 'film', 'sleazy', 'side', 'adult', 'entertainment', 'film', 'industry', 'idea', 'how', 'mess', 'kid', 'more', 'creative', 'violent', 'really', 'did', 'reaction', 'twist', 'film', 'end', 'was', 'wavering', 'round', 'up', 'down', '3.5', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'was', 'enough', 'shift', 'scale', 'high', 'end.In', 'end', 'ability', 'enjoy', 'film', 'going', 'come', 'down', 'how', 'much', 'two', 'stars', 'are', 'offended', 'not', 'more', 'sex', 'how', 'much', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'Risky', 'Business', 'playbook', 'start', 'finish', 'comedy', 'better', 'sex', 'was', 'thinking', 'more', 'old', 'Andy', 'Hardy', 'movies', 'where', 'kids', 'decide', 'put', 'show', 'end', 'film', 'anything', 'else', 'Maybe', 'was', 'wrong', 'laugh', 'hijinks', 'film', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'strange', 'be', 'giving', 'credit', 'movie', 'not', 'going', 'far', 'given', 'opportunities', 'do', 'so', 'do', 'get', 'credit', 'negotiating', 'curves', 'world', 'why', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'probably', 'going', 'become', 'late', 'night', 'cable', 'cult', 'classic', 'rated', 'version', 'film']",N/A

It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.In short, the Girl Next Door is a movie definitely worth watching!",5,American Pie meets Risky Business,1097452800,"10 11, 2004",2004,948,"['Definitely', 'outstanding', 'comedy', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'screen', 'exactly', 'what', 'title', 'story', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'who', 'madly', 'love', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'who', 'be', 'porn', 'star', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'rest', 'cast', 'have', 'outdone', 'performances', 'are', 'exceptional', 'say', 'least', 'actors', 'exceptions', 'give', '100', '%', 'really', 'chemistry', 'AMAZING', 'Very', 'well', 'written', 'very', 'well', 'presented', 'movie', 'doubt', 'guaranteed', 'provide', 'more', 'just', 'few', 'laughs', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'simple', 'enough', 'great', 'job', 'describing', 'people', 'young', 'adult', 'alike', 'day', 'problems', 'face', 'just', 'show', 'simplicity', 'often', 'far', 'better', 'complexity', 'when', 'trying', 'present', 'issues', 'human', 'nature.In', 'short', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

A nerd falls in love with his neighbour and later, when they are already dating, finds out that she is a porn star. After some time of fighting, he decides that he'll save her from this porn world, because he is too in loved with her. Of course there are many really hilarious jokes in this movie. Believe me, there really isn't any lack of humour. But what makes this movie so great is the star of the movie ELISHA CUTHBERT. This girl is so great. And I don't mean just her beauty. It has to be sad, that this girl can really act. She is not like the other cute actresses, who usually don't have a clue about acting. She is awesome actress. I believe there is a great future in front of her. And beside this acting skills, she is also one of the cutest girls I have ever seen. She is a true dream girl.

623084,A16X7GKCK83WUE,B00005JMX6,"Matthew Bratkowski ""mattster""","[1, 1]","This movie is about a timid, scholarly, high school student named Matthew (Emile Hirsche) and the hot, former porn star that moves in next door to him named Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert).  The two fall in love and have a positive effect on each other.  Danielle teaches Matthew that he can be successful without doing everything strickly by the book and can still have fun, and Matthew teaches Danielle that she has better things to do with her life than make pornographic movies.  Along the way, Matthew's two friends, Klutz and Eli, add humor to the movie, as does Danielle former porn director, who tries to make Matthew's life hell for stealing Danielle from him.Before seeing this movie, I was confused as to whether it was supposed to be billed as a comedy or a melodrama.  After watching it, I would say that it is more like the later.  It has humorous moments, but I wouldn't say that it is akin to American Pie.  Instead, it is about high school losers that are actually played by actors that look like high schoolers, not mid-twenty something actors pretending to be younger.  And these guys really are losers, not just guys that can't get any.  The movie is sexually driven, but is more about love than sex and has a number or sexual themes, but isn't about people just trying to get sex.Despite the more realistic cast of the movie, many parts of the plot are largely fictional.  The movie only deals with the glamorous, sexy, side of the pornographic industry and not its actual dirty, self-demeaning, drug and disease ridden reality.  Obvisouly, this would not make a happy movie.  Yet, The Girl Next Door is a rather happy movie where everything seems to easily come together for all of the characters at the movie's end and everyone is happy, which is pure fiction.Although it is not a realistic movie, I still found myself liking it.  I felt a little sympathy for Matthew and his troubles, and think that Elisha Cuthbert did a good job balancing the innocent, girl next door look of Danielle, and the sex goddess Athena.  Overall, the movie wasn't anything spectacular, but is a general feel-good movie and lacks the looming sappyness that is apparent in other high school movies such as ""The Perfect Score.""

Although it does stick to the typical boy-meets-girl-boy-loses-girl-boy-wins-girl-back formula, there's a lot of twists, and nudity inbetween.Although the cast were a bunch of unknowns to me (although Elisa Cuthbert was previously in a blink-and-you'll-miss-her scene in Love Actually), I found myself identifying (not with the porn bit obviously) and liking them. Emile Hirsch, looks extremely boyish, and has a real baby face, but I was shocked in a couple of scenes that he has a really hairy chest and legs! From a guy that doesn't actually look like he could shave, he could rival Robin Williams in the body hair stakes! Ugh!While I wasn't overly keen on the front cover of this movie, as I thought Elisa looked quite strange, she surpassed herself in this movie, and definitely looks prettier than she does on the cover. And the outfits she wears are absolutely gorgeous! I want her wardrobe!I haven't seen Risky Business, which this movie is really similar too, so I can't really comment on the similarities - although I do want to see it now!I loved the character of Timothy Olyphant, nice one minute, nasty the next. I'd previously only seen him play Mickey in Scream 2, and I liked him in that too. I did not like Eli's character, and the extra feature dedicated just to him was so bad I switched it off.From a female's point of view, this film doesn't really offend that much, but it does make you feel really insecure about your body. There's lots in it for the guys - although just to ruin your fantasies, some of the bikinis were digitally removed. Not so much a film for a girl to watch, if you get an attack of the green eyed monster, or you just don't like watching other prettier girls parading about in not very much. However, the one sex scenes there is, is very subtle, and appears near the end. Unless you count the porn movie scenes on the TV. For guys who have a thing for Elisa, although being the focus of the movie, she spends an alarming amount of time not actually on screen. It's more a Boy Next Door movie!The extras are unsurprisingly dull - can't they think of some more interesting extras? There is a commentary by Luke Greenfield; trivia track (does anyone watch these?); Revealing the Girl next Door; photo gallery; 16 uncensored deleted/extended scenes, including the original ending; hilarious unrated gag reel; 2 provocative featurettes ""A Look Next Door"" and ""The Eli XXXperience"" and there's apparently an Easter Egg (ooooh, chocolate!) somewhere, but I have no hope of finding it.This is a film worth taking a look at, particularly if you like the teen movies, or if you're an adolescent boy.

His future is looking bright due to the fact that he was excepted into Georgetown University. Unfortunately, Matt's family does not have the money to send him, and he has to compete for a full scholarship based on moral fiber. Standing in the way of this, is the girl of his dreams in the form of a porn star named Danielle ( 24's Elisha Cuthbert)who has recently left the profession and moved in next door to housesit for her aunt that is away on vacation. Matt and Danielle soon hit it off and fall for each other instantly. However, Matt is forced to choose between his future and his girl, when Danielle's film producer Kelly ( Timothy Olyphant) comes calling to convince Danielle to remain in the adult film industry.Going into this film, I was in the same boat as a lot of the people who are going to see The Girl Next Door. I figured that the movie would be your typical teen sex comedy. While the film does play out like a modern day version of the Tom Cruise film Risky Business, the laughs are non-stop, the story is extremely well done, and there is the perfect amount of sex and nudity to keep the film from going over the top. You are probably asking yourself what the perfect amount of nudity is. In my opinion, the perfect amount in a film like this, is enough to get the point across, without taking anything away from the story. After all, the movie is centered in the porn industry which may turn some people away. But, it actually turns out to be a very good film. It is also great when a movie makes you laugh, but it is even better when the story for the film keeps you involved. In fact, I would probably call The Girl Next Door, the best ""dramedy"" I have seen in awhile. The performances were top notch in this film as well.Overall, The Girl Next Door is an amazing movie. The great performances, non stop laughs, and incredible story are what make this movie one of my all time favorites. The DVD itself is very cool. It is packed full of special features including a short film called ""The Eli Experience"" in which actor Chris Marquette goes to an actual adult film convention and plays his character Eli Brooks from the movie.

623093,A228JH8V9Y700G,B00005JMX6,MortensOrchid,"[0, 0]","When I picked up this movie, I was thinking it was going to a smutty comedy along the lines of American Pie / Risky Business / Porky's.  It turned out to be a bit darker than I expected, with some not so funny parts and some downright grim realities coupled in with it.Matt is a stereotypical ""nice guy"" who has an ordinary high school career, not very popular, not very exciting, and a bit on the dull side.  One day, a beautiful girl moves in next door and he is smitten.  Much to his surprise, he discovers Danielle is a 19 year old former adult film star.  That is, she's every horny teenage boy's dream come true.  She's running away from the life, and doesn't want anything to do with it anymore.  But she's being stalked by ghosts from the past, her manager is looking to make his investment back and he'll stop at nothing to get her back into his movies.  Soon he and his friends propose making their own movie to pay him off once and for all, and even offer some of the other popular boys to be in it.  They get many offers, and suddenly things are looking up for Matt.What a movie like this says about our culture cannot possibly be summed up in a review like this.  There are so many layers to this.  The porn industry, while it seems exciting and glamourous on the outside, is really a horrifying place where women are mislead, abused, and intimidated into preforming.  Danielle wants nothing else but to escape, and she's being stalked by the monsters who have lured her in.  Matt sees her on one hand as his ultimate object of desire, and ends up falling for her.  (Fiction!)  Matt seems to be a nice guy, but he seems to hold this porn star girlfriend closer to him for the fact that she's a former porn star and not just ""the girl next door"".Perhaps the most telling of events is when they are going to film the porn movie in the library of their school.  When they talk the popular boys into doing it, they jump at the chance thinking that it will enhance their status.  And the one who seems the biggest and strongest of them all can't preform.  Stuck in the situation, Matt at first volonteers to be the one, but he can't do it.  He loves Danielle too much to degrade her again.  So his friend volonteers (the biggest laugh of the movie, when he appears on camera with the fencing mask on).  And I had the best thought of the entire movie when he did that.  I just thought ""Wow, what a good friend"".  Perhaps that was the most noble thing of them all.",4,Darker than I expected,1181865600,"06 15, 2007",2007,2470,"['When', 'picked', 'up', 'movie', 'was', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'smutty', 'comedy', 'lines', 'American', 'Pie', '/', 'Risky', 'Business', '/', 'Porky', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'bit', 'darker', 'expected', 'not', 'so', 'funny', 'parts', 'downright', 'grim', 'realities', 'coupled', 'it.Matt', 'stereotypical', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'ordinary', 'high', 'school', 'career', 'not', 'very', 'popular', 'not', 'very', 'exciting', 'bit', 'dull', 'side', 'One', 'day', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'moves', 'next', 'door', 'smitten', 'Much', 'surprise', 'Danielle', '19', 'year', 'old', 'former', 'adult', 'film', 'star', 'horny', 'teenage', 'boy', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'running', 'away', 'life', ""n't"", 'want', 'anything', 'do', 'anymore', 'being', 'stalked', 'ghosts', 'past', 'manager', 'looking', 'make', 'investment', 'back', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'back', 'movies', 'Soon', 'friends', 'propose', 'making', 'own', 'movie', 'pay', 'off', 'once', 'even', 'offer', 'other', 'popular', 'boys', 'be', 'get', 'many', 'offers', 'suddenly', 'things', 'are', 'looking', 'up', 'Matt.What', 'movie', 'culture', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'review', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'porn', 'industry', 'exciting', 'glamourous', 'outside', 'really', 'horrifying', 'place', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'mislead', 'abused', 'intimidated', 'preforming', 'Danielle', 'nothing', 'else', 'escape', 'being', 'stalked', 'monsters', 'who', 'have', 'lured', 'Matt', 'one', 'hand', 'ultimate', 'object', 'desire', 'up', 'falling', 'Fiction', 'Matt', 'be', 'nice', 'guy', 'hold', 'porn', 'star', 'girlfriend', 'closer', 'fact', 'former', 'porn', 'star', 'not', 'just', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'most', 'telling', 'events', 'when', 'are', 'going', 'film', 'porn', 'movie', 'library', 'school', 'When', 'talk', 'popular', 'boys', 'doing', 'jump', 'chance', 'thinking', 'will', 'enhance', 'status', 'one', 'who', 'biggest', 'strongest', 'ca', ""n't"", 'preform', 'Stuck', 'situation', 'Matt', 'first', 'volonteers', 'be', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'Danielle', 'too', 'much', 'degrade', 'again', 'friend', 'volonteers', 'biggest', 'laugh', 'movie', 'when', 'camera', 'fencing', 'mask', 'had', 'best', 'thought', 'entire', 'movie', 'when', 'did', 'just', 'thought', 'Wow', 'what', 'good', 'friend', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'most', 'noble', 'thing']",N/A

While many reviewers have commented on its similarities to Risky Business, those similarities are only superficial.  Yes, this is a teen romantic comedy.  Yes, it has at its central characters an all American adolescent guy and a hot girl with a sex industry worker past.  And, yes, the opening romantic musical theme sounds a lot like ""Love on a Real Train - Risky Business"", probably because the original music was done by Paul Haslinger, who was a member of Tangerine Dream for most of their memorable music soundtracks (but not a member of the band when they did the soundtrack for Risky Business).  That is where the similarities end, however.Where Risky Business was about getting out of trouble caused by being smitten with a prostitute, The Girl Next Door was about voluntarily getting into trouble because of genuine love for a girl that just happened to be an ex Porn star.  As far as movies about being young, in love, and under pressure go, they don't get much better than this.  I really liked this movie, however I can't imagine why the DVD is rated UR as opposed to R.  My guess is that with any imaginative editing, at all, it could have easily been rated PG-13.  It certianly doesn't push the boundaries in the other direction (toward NC17).

623095,A179GX8E3M4G52,B00005JMX6,"Mr D. ""Artist/Designer/Kibitzer""","[5, 8]","That girl is gorgeous and just look at that bod, Matthew thinks as he walks into a garbage can out side his house.Later, while Matthew is upstairs in his bedroom when he sees her, in the house next door, through his window and she's UNDRESSING! Just as she finishes taking off the last piece, she turns around quickly and looks Matthew straight in the face. A shy and shocked Matthew quickly ducks below the window sill and after a minute, slowly, ever so slowly, peeks over the sill but the girl is gone.Just then Matthew (Emile Hirsch) hears the doorbell ring and his parents call for him. He comes out of the bedroom and there with his parents is the girl. ""Oh Oh"" he thinks ""She's telling them I'm a voyeur, a Peeping Tom"". The girl, Danielle is her name, has a Cheshire smile on her face, then his mother says Danielle is new in town and wonders if you could show her around town.Unknown to Matthew, who is the not so popular class president in high school and about to graduate, is that Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) has been in pornographic films and is trying to break away from the business. This fact is thrust upon Matthew by one of his nerdy friends, Eli (Chris Marquette), who is obsessed with pornography, when he begins to show him one of Danielle's films.So begins The Girl Next Door A racy teenage comedy directed by Luke Greenberg and written by screenwriters David Wagner and Brent Goldberg, which bounces back and forth between Matthew's High School, when he has earned new found credibility because of his foxy new girlfriend and the annual Pornography Convention in - where else - Las Vegas in a tug of war for Danielle with Kelly (Timothy Olyphant), her former adult film producer with designs of landing her back in front of the camera.ConclusionI liked this film but I didn't love it. The story was clever and some of the situations were funny but I found the subject matter a little silly if not distasteful. I had only seen the two lead actors before and they had both played petulant, surly teenagers, Hirsch as the troublesome son of a senator in one of my favorite movies ""The Emperors Club"" and Cuthbert as the querulous daughter in the TV series 24 Hours . My impression of both actors has improved with this movie. Neither was great but they performed in a yeomanship manner and despite the subject matter their characters were upbeat and impressive. Cuthbert has blossomed from the temperamental child/woman of 24 Hours into a very attractive and sensuous actress. I look forward to more work from both actors. Another bright spot was the kinky quirky acting of Timothy Olyphant. One minute a friend the next an enemy, he played the part to a tee. Cheers for Olyphant. Matthews two nerdy sidekicks also gave good performancesThere is a R Rated version and an unrated version. I watched the unrated version which had some nudity (surprise) but only in cameo appearances from minor actresses and at the porn convention. That's right, only girls, no guys. Sorry, girls, equal rights hasn't progressed that far.Despite the fact that this is a so called ""teen comedy"", you might want to keep any teens under, say seventeen away from the racy unrated version.Overall I found the movie to be entertaining, Final rating a low four stars @ 3.6",4,WOW!

I understand that ""The Girl Next Door"" was made as a public service to these viewers and deliberately featured a screenplay so dumbed-down that even those just slightly above the moron level could have their first-ever intelligence insulting viewing experience.Start with a mix of ""Risky Business"" and ""Can't Hardly Wait"", extract all elements of intelligence and charm that characterized those films, and then further dumb-down the story as a public service to the brain-activity challenged members of the audience; and you have a good description of ""The Girl Next Door"".But it sure has a nice promotional poster. Elisha Cuthbert looks good posing and she does a decent job playing Elisha Cuthbert (who just happens to be ""The Girl Next Door""), but her range as an actress is too narrow to even be measured. Unfortunately for Cuthbert, ""This"" girl next door (a part most talented young ""actresses"" would love to play) is supposed to be a multi-dimensional character (for those in the target audience this means that the character is really two different people: ""a girl next door"" and a ""young but hardened by experience porn star""). If you have seen the movie and are still confused don't be embarrassed, nothing in Cuthbert's performance would lead anyone to believe she is a ""young but hardened by experience porn star"". That is because Cuthbert herself is not a ""young but hardened by experience porn star"". She would have to ""act"" differently than ""the girl next door"" to communicate this dimensionality to the audience. To do this she would have to be an ""actress"".So give Cuthbert credit for being able to pose for pictures and for being herself-she seems like a very nice girl that I would welcome as my neighbor. For some people that is enough, for those busy with the experience of having their intelligence insulted for the first time it is probably not important. The rest of us we would be hard pressed to find a worse way to spend our time.Then again, what do I know?

This movie though takes that plot and runs with it in a highly clever fashion.From the opening scenes whereby the population of the high school scribble in their year book memories obliviously labeling themselves amongst the high school social order hooked my attention. Emile Hirsh(Presumably a relative new-comer to the Hollywood movie scene as he was unbeknownst to me) fits in his role admirably. As a young man struggling with his self-and familial imposed expectations while wanting to cut loose and enjoy some of the experiences he watches from the classroom window as the ""rebels"" cut class to hit the beach and party.His life changes when he spies the gorgeous blonde neighbour changing prompting her to confront and befriend him.Soon the two main characters are swept away in the early tides of romance, until the revelation of Elisha's ex-porn profession hits the lad like a ton of bricks. Other obstacles include her ex-producer/boyfriend (brilliantly played) and a school project to import a genuis from overseas to the school (which wasn't an obstacle until the ex-producer showed up).This film is at heart a romantic comedy, but it appeals to the cynical/jaded audience of the twenty first century not only because of the plot, dark comedy and acting but because it has an edge shining through all the above factors insuring it isn't some mushy lovey dovey story.This is a romantic comedy for the 21st century.Finally an apology to Elisha Cuthbert. I had seen some episodes of the critically and audience acclaimed 24 and always thought she looked wooden onscreen. After seeing her acting abilities in this movie I now realize I was judging her talents unfairly. She can not only act(She fulfills this role as if it was written for her and perhaps it was). As an added bonus she is Canadian yay ms. Cuthbert.This movie is as much a social commentary(another one I know but one of the better ones) on high school and a surprisingly moving love story in which I totally rooted for Matthew and Danielle.",4,"Smart, Funny, Timely what more do ya Want?",1095724800,"09 21, 2004",2004,2236,"['Admittedly', 'premise', 'movie', 'ex-porn', 'starlet', 'moving', 'next-door', 'high', 'school', 'reluctantly', 'term', 'geek', 'shoe', 'little', 'large', 'niche', 'high', 'school', 'heirarchy', 'stretching', 'things', 'movie', 'plot', 'highly', 'clever', 'opening', 'scenes', 'whereby', 'population', 'high', 'school', 'scribble', 'year', 'book', 'memories', 'obliviously', 'labeling', 'amongst', 'high', 'school', 'social', 'order', 'hooked', 'attention', 'Emile', 'Hirsh', 'Presumably', 'relative', 'new-comer', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'scene', 'was', 'unbeknownst', 'role', 'admirably', 'young', 'man', 'struggling', 'self-and', 'familial', 'imposed', 'expectations', 'wanting', 'cut', 'loose', 'enjoy', 'experiences', 'classroom', 'window', 'rebels', 'cut', 'class', 'hit', 'beach', 'party.His', 'life', 'changes', 'when', 'gorgeous', 'blonde', 'neighbour', 'changing', 'prompting', 'confront', 'befriend', 'him.Soon', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'swept', 'away', 'early', 'tides', 'romance', 'revelation', 'Elisha', 'ex-porn', 'profession', 'lad', 'ton', 'bricks', 'Other', 'obstacles', 'include', 'ex-producer/boyfriend', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'school', 'project', 'import', 'genuis', 'overseas', 'school', 'was', ""n't"", 'obstacle', 'ex-producer', 'showed', 'up', '.This', 'film', 'heart', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'appeals', 'cynical/jaded', 'audience', 'twenty', 'first', 'century', 'not', 'only', 'plot', 'dark', 'comedy', 'acting', 'edge', 'shining', 'above', 'factors', 'insuring', ""n't"", 'mushy', 'lovey', 'dovey', 'story.This', 'romantic', 'comedy', '21st', 'century.Finally', 'apology', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'had', 'seen', 'episodes', 'critically', 'audience', 'acclaimed', '24', 'always', 'thought', 'looked', 'wooden', 'onscreen', 'seeing', 'acting', 'abilities', 'movie', 'now', 'realize', 'was', 'judging', 'talents', 'unfairly', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'act', 'role', 'was', 'written', 'perhaps', 'was', 'added', 'bonus', 'Canadian', 'yay', 'Cuthbert.This', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'social', 'commentary', 'one', 'know', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'high', 'school', 'surprisingly', 'moving', 'love', 'story', 'totally', 'rooted', 'Matthew', 'Danielle']",N/A

Look beyond the raunch and smut, participate in the many laughs the humor brings, and try to dig deeper and deeper.  You'll find something.Could it be ::gasp:: heart and maturity?  Could you find a couple of significant life lessons?  Perhaps you have heard them before.  THE GIRL NEXT DOOR has no qualms about reiterating them for today's teen and adult world - that's the audience this flick is targeted at.THE GIRL NEXT DOOR borrows more than a little bit from the classic 80's flick RISKY BUSINESS.  Pay attention closely.  Emile Hirsch plays Matthew, filling the shoes of the straightedge Tom Cruise role.  Elisha Cuthbert is ethereal, with a Marilyn Monroe-esque appeal.  Here, rather than conquering the role of Kiefer Sutherland's daughter on the drama 24, she is the Rebecca DeMornay character.Much of this comedy occurs in the high school world.  Matthew is a straightedge who is Ivy League-bound to Georgetown, hopefully by scholarship.  He has a few close buds who are nothing like him, depicted as porno-obsessed and headed off to some random community college.  The night he sees Danielle (Elisha), he is instantaneously transfixed by how beautiful she is.  For the summer, she'll be house-sitting the place next door.  The two teens get to know each other and soon enjoy one another's company very much, as friends, basically - with the potential to be more.The potential declines thanks to one of Matthew's buds.  He has discovered a porno film with a familiar-looking star.  To Matthew's shock, the sexy starlet is none other than Danielle, who at first glance, had an innocent sort of allure to her.  Rather than being psyched to personally know a porn star, he's more shocked than anything else - shocked to near tears, actually.  He knows he needs to help Danielle to leave her shady past behind.  But how can he with her ex-boyfriend and porno producer (Timothy Olyphant) back in the picture, trying to get her back into the biz?  Those attempts to lure Danielle back into the world of film sex are succeeding, to Matthew's dismay.  Once Olyphant leaves the film, he takes much of the heart with him.Still, there's enough heart left over for a few additional laughs, I suppose, despite the fact it's rather difficult for me to fathom how this stole profusely from RISKY BUSINESS, which is annoying, being that I search for originality in a movie...What are the lessons of THE GIRL NEXT DOOR?  It's never too late to start over, no matter how wretched your past.  And sometimes, those straightedges need to loosen up and let the good times roll, if you get the gist of what I'm saying.Will Matthew's determination be enough to save Danielle from the porn industry?  Will it be good enough to help her reclaim her innocence?

That's the Impression we might get by looking that the Picture on the DVD/Blu ray Box of the movie.But when the movie started, I was looking at a completely new concept. It was actually a story of a Young Boy, with a Goal in Mind regarding his Education & His Life. And as the Movie progresses, You will see so many different things that we see in our regular life.Every Little Part of the movie has a little thought behind. And the Best of all was, ""Don't Judge a Person By The Looks and Profession of His/Her. There might be a Reason and A Pure Soul behind it."" And, TRUE LOVE doesn't see anything except for the other person's Heart.Emile Hirsch & Elisha Cuthbert were really good for their roles in the Movie. Even the two friends of Emile were really good. They really made a Fantastic Tripod together. The Background Score, Songs and all were too good.

Sure this movie is not original but I found myself captured by the chemistry on screen between Emile Hirsch(playing Matthew Kidman) and Elisha Cuthbert(playing girl next door Danielle). They are the most important characters in the movie and hold their own very well. I'm not going to go into just how similar this movie really is to Risky Business.(It is so similar even some of the soundtrack sounds nearly identical) I'm just going to lay out there the things that stand out most in my mind after viewing the movie twice.This is coming from a single guy in his mid twenties, but I stress to say that Elisha Cuthbert simply friggin lights up the screen. Not only is she such a wonderful gorgeous, cute, knockout of a girl, she seems to just have a certain something that just makes you want to watch her just to see what she might do next. You watch her along with Matthew Kidman simply captured by her smile and her laughter. Everything seemed so light and natural. Sure her lines are nothing special but I find it rare to find somebody with such a glow. Lets put it this way. Elisha portrays a girl so smokin hot that you can't think of meaningless sex although she has every asset. This is a girl you want to make love to. The way the movie ends kind of never fully captures that especially since Danielle was trying to escape the opposite of that in porn. In fact it is so similar to Risky Business I almost choked the way it comes together.Anyhow, I think most any person can enjoy the movie although the unrated version will probably offend some people with the more graphic scenes of porn watching. The supporting cast are all solid and Matthew's friends are a real laugh. The kid with the Vivid Video hat is hilarious and basically there is a scene where each supporting character forces you to chuckle. Kelly, the porn producer is so funny and creepy at times you just don't know whether to hate or love him.Now, if nothing else catches your fancy, at least watch this movie for the sake of seeing Elisha. She is worth the price of admission.

A gesture, meant to stear the young woman away from her chosen career, puts in jeopardy not only the boy's entry into college, but maybe even his very life and freedom.Surprisingly, the one entertaining factor in this far fetched story comes in the form of Timothy Olyphant as a porn producer and the porn stars ex. It is the part that challenges my previously grim view of the man's acting skills. His very appearance: the plaid pants, the crazy hair, the five pounds of jewelry, is chuckle worthy.

It starts out that a porn star moves into a neighborhood to house sit next door to a high school boy.  This boy falls in love with this girl before finding out of her past.  A man from the industry shows up and forces her to go back with him to make another porn movie.  When this boy finds out, he takes off after her.  There is a large amount of money involved here.  The boys agree to make their own porn type movie using her friends from the industry.  After they make the movie, this man threatens to show it to his parents if he doesn't pay him money.  The boy tells him to go ahead and show the movie.  What is cool about this is that the boys have made a sex education movie showing real girls and boys to be shown in schools. They use real nudity and instructions on how to use a condom on a real boy.  This is very funny when they show the movie in his school.  This porn girl has also fallen in love with the neighbor next door also.  The rest is history as they say.I recommend this movie to those who don't mind a little nudity.

Contains nudity (for a movie that includes the adult film industry, there is less nudity than you might expect), and profanity.DVD Features: The 2-sided DVD (don't forget to turn over the DVD to the B side) contains the movie, and some special features.  Side A: movie; Special Features: Feature Commentary by the director and feature trivia track.  Side B: Special Features: ""Scene Specific Commentaries by"" the two leads (six shared scenes, one scene with just Hirsch and two scenes with just Cuthbert (""we really rehearsed the big scenes""); ""The Eli Experience"" (a visit to a real adult convention in Las Vegas); ""A Look Next Door"" (feature about the movie (contains nudity)); ""Gag Reel""; Deleted and Extended scenes (16 scenes including the original ending includes director commentary); Still Gallery; Trailers (three movie specific trailers and one movie reel (clips from several movies)).Credits: The movie stars Emile Hirsch (Matthew Kidman - student council president; ""Lords of Dogtown""), Elisha Cuthbet (Danielle; ""24""; ""House of Wax""), Timothy Olyphant (Kelly; ""Deadwood""), James Remar (Hugo Posh; ""Blade:Trinity""), Chris Marquette (Eli; ""Joan of Arcadia""), and Paul Dano (Klitz; one episode of ""The Sopranos""). Also starring Sung Hi Lee (Ferrari; ""Nurse Betty""), Ulysses Lee (Samnang; ""Day of Independence"") and Matt ""Horshu"" Wiese (Mule; a.k.a. Luther Reigns - ""WWE""). The director is Luke Greenfield (""The Animal"").Plot: The movie is about a group of kids in the last part of their last year in high school and about a hot new 19-year-old female (Danielle) that moves in next door to a high school senior named Matthew (movie specifically focuses on Matthew).  Danielle and Matthew hook up after Danielle tries to break Matthew out of his shell.  The day after they kiss for the first time, trouble develops when he learns that she is an ex-porn star.  He learned this interesting tidbit from his friend that likes to watch a lot of porn.Review: The movie opens with a yearbook photo shoot and a fantasy like segment where the students show/mention what they will always remember (the movie starts as if it will turn into a porno movie and then we see that it is just a high school photo shoot).  The movie focuses in on three geeky males that appear to be unpopular, though one of them had the ability, at some point, to get the rest of the senior class to vote for him to be their student council president.  Judging by how the students around him act, and his speech at the pep rally, it would probably be the case that he won because everyone else was busy goofing around and skipping class.Matthew first sees the new girl next door as she wanders up to her house while Matthew is taking the trash out to the curb.  He does not greet her. Later, he spots her stripping in her room, and he watches her, and she catches him watching.  She then immediately walks over to his house, and Matthew thinks he is in trouble with her and his parents.  Danielle doesn't mention it to the parents and Matthew and Danielle end up driving through the city, and that is how they meet.I'm not sure I like any of the characters in this movie, and I'm not sure if that is good or bad acting.  I've only seen one of the actors before (the one from ""24"") so I can't compare previous/post acting jobs by any of the other actors.  I'm not sure, but the girl from ""24"" might have progressed in her acting ability.Interesting, the movie reminds me of a ""Dream On"" episode, ""The Charlotte Letter,"" where the lead, Martin Tupper, dates a woman (Charlotte).  Everything is going fine in the relationship until a friend points out to Martin that the woman is an ex-porn star, and then Martin suddenly can't stop seeing Charlotte in porn star positions, regardless of the setting (TV show: at a party; this movie: meeting his parents; Plot; there is also a plot line near the end of the TV show ""Sports Night"" series where one of the anchors, Dan, dates a current porn star).  There are major differences between the two plot-lines though (""Dream On"" and this movie).  In the TV episode the man has already slept with the woman, talks about his problem, and they resolve it.  In the movie, the boy/man hasn't already slept with the woman, doesn't talk about his problem, and tries to get her drunk so that he can sleep with her (and I've suddenly realized that I've already seen this movie or I've seen this exact plot-line elsewhere, since I don't recall seeing this movie before).Wherever the high school is set (California?), everything looks real instead of a stage (setting).  The gang also visit Los Vegas.  Based on the short drive, it would appear that they could be from Baker, CA (from Oakland, it is 558.87 miles, eight hours 55 minutes; from Bakersfield: 286.50 miles; from Baker CA it is just one hour and 24 minutes away). The view of Vegas looked real, but the action that occurs indoors could have occurred in any convention center.Overall, I'd rate this movie 3.45 stars.",3,"The daughter from ""24"" moves next door,

I hate this movie so much that I couldn't believe that I spent money to see trash.  If you're expecting a risky romance movie from the trailer you saw, you're wrong and I am not insulting you, I thought that too.  This is another teen movie, now don't get me wrong I like teen movies, but this is horrible and has got to to be the worst movie of the year maybe in history.  Now, they do copy parts from Risky Business(starring Tom Cruise) but it's not good.  The ending, don't even get me started at the ending, it was really bad, now I won't spoil it for you so don't worry. Now, by off the trailer you're thinking it's about this kid(Matthew Kidman, played by Amile Hirsh) has meets the girl next door(Elisha Cuthbert, Danielle) and falls in love with her and has to risk it all for her, I expect you to know that she is a porn star.

623138,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JMX6,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 4]","I'm sorry but I didn't like it.  I hated this film not because it includes a story about a teenage boy and 'the girl next door.'  That could be interesting as we have seen in 'Risky Business.'  No, this film actually is NOT about the relations between them; it soon tries to find 'funny' gags in such often recycled materials as 'rescue operations' or 'cute, nice speech', which we have already seen in the films like 'Agent Cody Banks' or 'American Pie.'The actors are charming.  Emile Hirsch plays Matthew Kidman, whose next-door neighbor turns out a new 'house-sitter' Danielle.  When Danielle is Elisha Cuthbert, or Kim of '24', what could he wish for more?  And Danielle later again turns out a porn star.But the film, during its lengthy 110 minute course, tries to swallow too much.  Danielle's former love pops up, at the exact moment when we expect.  When you hear Matthew has to make a speech in front of the posh audience, and he realizes that he is on some substance, we know exactly what is going to happen.  And knowing that, the film extends itself by including so many unnecessary things (like some 'wracky' scenes in Vegas!) as if trying to outwit us.No, the filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves.  Because by extending the story, they wasted these good actors, including likable Hirsch, sexy and charming Cuthbert, and Timothy Olyphant (who appears as unpredictable 'Kelly').  In fact, Olyphant is really a talented one, who should be given better materials than this one.Occasionally funny, but 'The Girl Next Door' shows one undeniable fact that Hollywood needs able screenwriters more than ever, who can describe the convincing relations between a girl and a boy.  (Consider Ms. Cuthbert was seen in Richard Curtis's 'Love Actually' which could have given a chance for her to shine with more screentime.)  If you find this film amusing (and I don't deny that I was sometimes amused too), that's because of these actors.",2,Charming and Gifted Actors Awfully Wasted,1105660800,"01 14, 2005",2005,1944,"[""'m"", 'sorry', 'did', ""n't"", 'hated', 'film', 'not', 'story', 'teenage', 'boy', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'could', 'be', 'interesting', 'have', 'seen', ""'Risky"", 'Business', 'No', 'film', 'actually', 'NOT', 'relations', 'soon', 'find', ""'funny"", 'gags', 'such', 'often', 'recycled', 'materials', ""'rescue"", 'operations', ""'cute"", 'nice', 'speech', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'films', ""'Agent"", 'Cody', 'Banks', ""'American"", 'Pie', 'actors', 'are', 'charming', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Matthew', 'Kidman', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'out', 'new', ""'house-sitter"", 'Danielle', 'When', 'Danielle', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'Kim', ""'24"", 'what', 'could', 'wish', 'more', 'Danielle', 'later', 'again', 'out', 'porn', 'film', 'lengthy', '110', 'minute', 'course', 'swallow', 'too', 'much', 'Danielle', 'former', 'love', 'up', 'exact', 'moment', 'when', 'expect', 'When', 'hear', 'Matthew', 'make', 'speech', 'front', 'posh', 'audience', 'substance', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'knowing', 'film', 'including', 'so', 'many', 'unnecessary', 'things', ""'wracky"", 'scenes', 'Vegas', 'trying', 'outwit', 'us.No', 'filmmakers', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'extending', 'story', 'wasted', 'good', 'actors', 'including', 'likable', 'Hirsch', 'sexy', 'charming', 'Cuthbert', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'who', 'unpredictable', ""'Kelly"", 'fact', 'Olyphant', 'really', 'talented', 'one', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'better', 'materials', 'one.Occasionally', 'funny', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'one', 'undeniable', 'fact', 'Hollywood', 'able', 'screenwriters', 'more', 'ever', 'who', 'can', 'describe', 'convincing', 'relations', 'girl', 'boy', 'Consider', 'Ms.', 'Cuthbert', 'was', 'seen', 'Richard', 'Curtis', ""'Love"", 'Actually', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'chance', 'shine', 'more', 'screentime', 'find', 'film', 'amusing', 'do', ""n't"", 'deny', 'was', 'sometimes', 'amused', 'too', 'actors']",N/A

""Oh, it's like someone handed the director a script for a dumb teenage movie and forgot to tell him that it didn't need to be that good.  This was a really great movie,"" is one of the things I heard; that was one of a couple of gushing reviews I caught about how great it is.  I wanted to see it, had high hopes but when I finally did see it I was very disappointed.Yes, it is a decent movie, but it is a blatantly shameless rip-off of the classic ""Risky Business.""  Even some of the camera shots, lines, and music are the same!  Of course it's a decent movie; 75% of it is just RB rehashed, so how bad can it possibly be?I was expecting something funny and original, but all this consists of is someone jacking a story that's been told before (and much better I might add), changing a couple of the details and calling it their own.  Saying that ""The Girl Next Door"" is something that ""pays homage"" to RB is being extremely generous.  This is not paying homage, this is simply a form of plaigarism.Some examples....GND has a ""Delby-ish"" friend in it, one who desperately persuades, to the point of being obnoxious, the good kid to do naughty things, but then does not actually partake in any bad behavior himself; all talk, no action.  There is a replacement for RB's Guido in the form of Kelly, whom the main character crosses unintentionally for which he pays the price.  In GND he pays in the form of $25,000 (the manner in which the money was stolen was completely unbelievable, by the way); in RB he pays in the form of his mother's egg and everything not nailed to the floor in his house.  In GND he has to utilize the ""profession"" in which his new ""girlfriend"" is/was working in in order to make back the money he lost which is not really his; in RB he has to utilize the ""profession"" in which his ""girlfriend"" is working in in order to make the money to fix the car he tanked, which was not his.  Hmm, in GND he is stressing out over getting a scholarship that will allow him to go to Georgetown.  In RB he is worried about his project for Future Enterprisers and getting accepted to Princeton.  Even the ""train"" scene from RB pops up in GND in the form of a limo.  Come on, the lighting, looks on their faces, and position were the same (she is even on the same side of the screen!)  Anyone who has seen and likes RB knows what I mean.  I could go on with more, but I have already gone on enough!  You get the point!There is no new territory covered here, and nothing original about any of it.  The only high points are James Remar (in near-buttfloss) in an unfortunately small role (maybe five minutes of screen time, if that), and Timothy Olyphant, who is absolutely hilarious and does an excellent job in his role, as he usually does.  Olyphant's scenes were laugh-out-loud funny, which is no shock as he usually makes his characters stand out.This movie could have been done differently and still have been funny and possibly even moving.  But alas, anything good it does is simply overshadowed, ruined even, by the fact that all one (who has seen RB) can do is think of is the movie it's copying, which is what this film deserves.  I am totally annoyed that this movie is getting so much recognition for being witty and unique, when it is anything but.  Yeah, it's funny, but that is no surprise considering the source from which it was COPIED.",2,"How bad can it be if it's a ""Risky Business"" rip-off?",1093564800,"08 27, 2004",2004,3400,"['kept', 'hearing', 'how', 'great', 'movie', 'Oh', 'someone', 'handed', 'director', 'script', 'dumb', 'teenage', 'movie', 'forgot', 'tell', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'good', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'things', 'heard', 'was', 'one', 'couple', 'gushing', 'reviews', 'caught', 'how', 'great', 'wanted', 'see', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'when', 'finally', 'did', 'see', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed.Yes', 'decent', 'movie', 'blatantly', 'shameless', 'rip-off', 'classic', 'Risky', 'Business', 'Even', 'camera', 'shots', 'lines', 'music', 'are', 'same', 'course', 'decent', 'movie', '75', '%', 'just', 'RB', 'rehashed', 'how', 'bad', 'can', 'possibly', 'be', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'funny', 'original', 'someone', 'jacking', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'much', 'better', 'might', 'add', 'changing', 'couple', 'details', 'calling', 'own', 'Saying', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'something', 'pays', 'homage', 'RB', 'being', 'extremely', 'generous', 'not', 'paying', 'homage', 'simply', 'form', 'plaigarism.Some', 'examples', '.GND', 'Delby-ish', 'friend', 'one', 'who', 'desperately', 'point', 'being', 'obnoxious', 'good', 'kid', 'do', 'naughty', 'things', 'then', 'not', 'actually', 'partake', 'bad', 'behavior', 'talk', 'action', 'replacement', 'RB', 'Guido', 'form', 'Kelly', 'whom', 'main', 'character', 'crosses', 'unintentionally', 'price', 'GND', 'form', '25,000', 'manner', 'money', 'was', 'stolen', 'was', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'way', 'RB', 'form', 'mother', 'egg', 'everything', 'not', 'nailed', 'floor', 'house', 'GND', 'utilize', 'profession', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'is/was', 'working', 'order', 'make', 'back', 'money', 'lost', 'not', 'really', 'RB', 'utilize', 'profession', 'girlfriend', 'working', 'order', 'make', 'money', 'fix', 'car', 'tanked', 'was', 'not', 'Hmm', 'GND', 'stressing', 'out', 'getting', 'scholarship', 'will', 'allow', 'go', 'Georgetown', 'RB', 'worried', 'project', 'Future', 'Enterprisers', 'getting', 'accepted', 'Princeton', 'Even', 'train', 'scene', 'RB', 'up', 'GND', 'form', 'limo', 'Come', 'lighting', 'position', 'were', 'same', 'even', 'same', 'side', 'screen', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'likes', 'RB', 'what', 'mean', 'could', 'go', 'more', 'have', 'already', 'gone', 'enough', 'get', 'point', 'new', 'territory', 'covered', 'here', 'nothing', 'original', 'only', 'high', 'points', 'are', 'James', 'Remar', 'near-buttfloss', 'unfortunately', 'small', 'role', 'maybe', 'five', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'who', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'excellent', 'job', 'role', 'usually', 'Olyphant', 'scenes', 'were', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'shock', 'usually', 'characters', 'stand', 'out.This', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'differently', 'still', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'possibly', 'even', 'moving', 'alas', 'anything', 'good', 'simply', 'overshadowed', 'ruined', 'even', 'fact', 'one', 'who', 'seen', 'RB', 'can', 'do', 'think', 'movie', 'copying', 'what', 'film', 'am', 'totally', 'annoyed', 'movie', 'getting', 'so', 'much', 'recognition', 'being', 'witty', 'unique', 'when', 'anything', 'Yeah', 'funny', 'surprise', 'considering', 'source', 'was', 'COPIED']",N/A
