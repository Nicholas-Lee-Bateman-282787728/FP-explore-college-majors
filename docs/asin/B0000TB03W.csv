Strange, I was never a country fan (I live in Asia and country music practically don't exist in this part of the world) but I always knew who Shania is. First heard Any Man of Mine from a compilation CD which features other Grammy Nominees from 1995. Thought that song was fun and catchy. And credit to MTV too. There was a point where That Don't Impress Me Much and You're Still the One are always on TV. Not sure what made me bought this but I don't regret it at all. I do not know 80% of the songs, yet I am enthralled by her performance. Fantastic...I find most artists nowadays hardly give more than 1 and half hour of concert time but Shania gave more than that and with less breaks in between. She just lets her music speaks for themselves! Gotta love her for that. Really wish I was there.",5,Simply breathtaking show!

Samuelson ""Bolski""","[0, 0]","What can I say that hasn't been said about Shania (as long as it's not negative because this woman knows how to perform!)I saw the unfortunately butchered and shortened version of this concert on NBC. I myself had never seen her live before and have only recently started listening to her music. But, from what I've heard (I own her three most recent CDs), I love her music. I've never been a country music fan until recently when I got SO fed up with other performers that were so anti-US. To me, country-western singers still feel rooted in the good 'ol USA and so does Shania, even though she's from Canada and lives overseas. But, her music is still rooted in some very traditional country music styles while mixing in some pop and rock and roll as well.Her music hits home in many areas and her voice is hauntingly beautiful when she sings. For those that have to pan her because she's not pure country, so what? This lady knows how to sing across many genres in the music industry which I believe is one of the main reasons Shania has been able to have such a huge following across the world!This concert is excellent. A wonderful mix of old and new songs, hitting country, pop rock, and rock and roll genres in one concert makes this an wonderfully entertaining show to watch for the whole family! Heck, I could even turn the TV off and just listen to it pump through my stereo.I was hoping this would come out on DVD after watching the concert on TV, and I was so happy to see it on Amazon a month back. Now that I have the package in my hands, I can only say I have no bad feelings about it except that the packaging is pretty plain. No booklet or anything inside the case except the DVD. But hey, I purchased this DVD to watch and listen to her in concert, not read about it.What I'm also glad is that they did NOT interrupt the concert with back-stage material as they did on TV. THe concert is shown without interruption and the sound is awesome in both 5.1 and 2.0 surround sound.I know that my two younger daughters are going to love having this DVD in our collection as they absolutely love her music. My youngest daughter loves Honey I'm Home and she was so disappointed when it wasn't played on TV. Now, she can dance all she wants as she loves to gallop around the room to it. This just shows the effect that Shania's music can have on even the youngest of listeners, and I do not have any qualms letting my daughters listen to Shania as I would with Brittany Spears.Get this DVD and she why Shania is as popular as she is, regardless of what the critics in Nashville and abroad have to say. I say they're just jealous that she has such a huge and loyal following from different regions of the world.Shania and this concert can go nowhere but Up!",5,Excellent concert!,1069113600,"11 18, 2003",2003,2764,"['What', 'can', 'say', ""n't"", 'been', 'said', 'Shania', 'as', 'long', 'not', 'negative', 'woman', 'how', 'perform', 'saw', 'unfortunately', 'butchered', 'shortened', 'version', 'concert', 'NBC', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'live', 'before', 'have', 'only', 'recently', 'started', 'listening', 'music', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'own', 'three', 'most', 'recent', 'CDs', 'love', 'music', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'country', 'music', 'fan', 'recently', 'when', 'got', 'SO', 'fed', 'up', 'other', 'performers', 'were', 'so', 'anti-US', 'country-western', 'singers', 'still', 'feel', 'rooted', 'good', 'USA', 'so', 'Shania', 'even', 'Canada', 'overseas', 'music', 'still', 'rooted', 'very', 'traditional', 'country', 'music', 'styles', 'mixing', 'pop', 'rock', 'roll', 'well.Her', 'music', 'home', 'many', 'areas', 'voice', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'when', 'have', 'pan', 'not', 'pure', 'country', 'what', 'lady', 'how', 'sing', 'many', 'genres', 'music', 'industry', 'believe', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'Shania', 'been', 'able', 'have', 'huge', 'following', 'world', 'concert', 'excellent', 'wonderful', 'mix', 'old', 'new', 'songs', 'hitting', 'country', 'pop', 'rock', 'rock', 'roll', 'genres', 'one', 'concert', 'wonderfully', 'entertaining', 'show', 'watch', 'whole', 'family', 'Heck', 'could', 'even', 'turn', 'TV', 'just', 'listen', 'pump', 'stereo.I', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'watching', 'concert', 'TV', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'see', 'Amazon', 'month', 'back', 'Now', 'have', 'package', 'hands', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'have', 'bad', 'feelings', 'packaging', 'pretty', 'plain', 'booklet', 'anything', 'case', 'DVD', 'hey', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'watch', 'listen', 'concert', 'not', 'read', 'it.What', ""'m"", 'also', 'glad', 'did', 'NOT', 'interrupt', 'concert', 'back-stage', 'material', 'did', 'TV', 'THe', 'concert', 'shown', 'interruption', 'sound', 'awesome', '5.1', '2.0', 'surround', 'sound.I', 'know', 'two', 'younger', 'daughters', 'are', 'going', 'love', 'having', 'DVD', 'collection', 'absolutely', 'love', 'music', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Honey', ""'m"", 'Home', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'played', 'TV', 'Now', 'can', 'dance', 'gallop', 'room', 'just', 'effect', 'Shania', 'music', 'can', 'have', 'even', 'youngest', 'listeners', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'qualms', 'letting', 'daughters', 'listen', 'Shania', 'would', 'Brittany', 'Spears.Get', 'DVD', 'why', 'Shania', 'as', 'popular', 'regardless', 'what', 'critics', 'Nashville', 'abroad', 'have', 'say', 'say', ""'re"", 'just', 'jealous', 'huge', 'loyal', 'following', 'different', 'regions', 'world.Shania', 'concert', 'can', 'go', 'nowhere', 'Up']",N/A

Shania is beautiful, talented and personable, and has an amazingly tight and versatile stage band.  She also interacts very well with her fans; there were a number of ""audience participation"" vignettes, including an adorable accompaniment by three young girls singing ""I'm Gonna' Getcha.""  The rest of the on-stage audience participation was interesting the first time, but one might fast forward through the second time.  Nevertheless, it was classic Shania making her fans part of the show.The sound quality of this disc worked better for me in stereo than in 5.1.  I'm not sure why (I'll check my settings), but the center channel in 5.1 projected a tiny bit too weekly so the vocals didn't punch through consistently like I would have expected.  In CD stereo, everything was crystal clear, and given all the instrumentation of Shania's band, the balance was excellent.In terms of video image, I'd rate this an A+, with vibrant colors and a sharp picture.  I was mildly disappointed with the editing, which I found to be much too rapid throughout the entire performance:  the same camera view rarely stayed on-screen for more than one measure, and I was wishing I had a little more time to dwell on some of the vantage points.

No. I'm giving it two stars because of the appearance of a &quot;cheap&quot; and rushed product this DVD have.How can it be possible that, in the DVD era, Shania release a DVD with absolutely NONE extras, no bonus material, no backstage footage, no interviews, there is not even the names of the band members at the final credits.

And I live in a subrub of Chicago, and I go to Chicago as often as I can, and it is a really good city, and you should check out the town, if you ever come to Illinois, they put in a whole different bandtand for Shania to pefrom on, and since I am from Chicago, I know that there is another bandstand in Chicago that is there, 365 days a year, used or not called the Petrillio Music Shell, and it is not as nice as this one that we see her perfoming on in this concert, and that is why I bet they put it in Grant Park for. The songs are Man! I feel like a Woman!, Up!, Honey, I'm home, She's not just a pretty face, Forever and for always, Ka-Ching!, When you kiss me, Don't be stupid (you know I love you), That don't impress me much, I'm gonna getcha good!, From this moment on, No one needs to know, Thank you baby! (for making someday come so soon), It only hurts when I'm breathing, Juanita, Whose bed have your boots bee under?, Any man of mine, In my car (I'll be the driver), (If you're not in it for love), I'm outta here!, You're still the one, Nah!, Rock this country! Now you might not have to be a big Shania Twain fan to know just what a kind person she is, in this concert, she goes off the stage for a bit, and goes in the adiuence, and lets a couple of women sing along on She's not a pretty face. Also between the songs of Ka-Ching! and When you kiss me, she lets a guy from the aduaince come up on the stage, and she introuces him to the crowd, and then they bring his girlfriend out on stage, and Shania says she has no idea of what is going to happen, and then he gets out a ring in a little box, and it looks like she knows what is going to happen, he gets down on one knee, and aks her to marry him, and with the mircophone, she accpets. I bet this will be one night they will remember, and then she lets them dance when she sings When you kiss me. Also she brings up 3 girls from the aduiance as well, and lets them sing alone with her on I'm gonna getche good. And she even brings up a 2 guys that spells out her first name, in parts on thier chests. And also even through she doesn't play guitar when she sings, she does and has the mike on the stand for 2 songs. Also it is nice to see the skyline of Chicago seen in this concert, and some of the buildings that are in the area of where this concert is pefromed. All together the show is 1 hour and 45 minutes long, and I know that a lot of singers come to Chicago for concerts, both in and outdoors, and it would be nice to see more filmed concerts like this.",4,Shouldn't it be called Shania Twain Up: Taped in Chicago?,1157414400,"09 5, 2006",2006,2758,"['3', '1/2', 'years', 'pefroming', 'concert', 'Shania', 'Twain', 'returns', 'concert', 'stage', 'promote', 'Up', 'album', 'fall', 'spent', 'time', 'tour', 'first', 'place', 'Grant', 'Park', 'Chicago', 'Illinois', 'live', 'subrub', 'Chicago', 'go', 'Chicago', 'as', 'often', 'can', 'really', 'good', 'city', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'town', 'ever', 'come', 'Illinois', 'put', 'whole', 'different', 'bandtand', 'Shania', 'pefrom', 'am', 'Chicago', 'know', 'bandstand', 'Chicago', 'there', '365', 'days', 'year', 'used', 'not', 'called', 'Petrillio', 'Music', 'Shell', 'not', 'as', 'nice', 'one', 'see', 'perfoming', 'concert', 'why', 'bet', 'put', 'Grant', 'Park', 'songs', 'are', 'Man', 'feel', 'Woman', 'Up', 'Honey', ""'m"", 'home', 'not', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'Forever', 'always', 'Ka-Ching', 'When', 'kiss', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'stupid', 'know', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'impress', 'much', ""'m"", 'gon', 'getcha', 'good', 'moment', 'one', 'know', 'Thank', 'baby', 'making', 'someday', 'come', 'so', 'soon', 'only', 'when', ""'m"", 'breathing', 'Juanita', 'Whose', 'bed', 'have', 'boots', 'bee', 'man', 'mine', 'car', ""'ll"", 'be', 'driver', ""'re"", 'not', 'love', ""'m"", 'outta', 'here', ""'re"", 'still', 'one', 'Nah', 'Rock', 'country', 'Now', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'big', 'Shania', 'Twain', 'fan', 'know', 'just', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'concert', 'stage', 'bit', 'adiuence', 'couple', 'women', 'sing', 'along', 'not', 'pretty', 'face', 'Also', 'songs', 'Ka-Ching', 'When', 'kiss', 'guy', 'aduaince', 'come', 'up', 'stage', 'crowd', 'then', 'bring', 'girlfriend', 'out', 'stage', 'Shania', 'idea', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'then', 'out', 'ring', 'little', 'box', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'down', 'one', 'knee', 'marry', 'mircophone', 'bet', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'night', 'will', 'remember', 'then', 'dance', 'when', 'sings', 'When', 'kiss', 'Also', 'up', '3', 'girls', 'aduiance', 'as', 'well', 'sing', 'alone', ""'m"", 'gon', 'getche', 'good', 'even', 'up', '2', 'guys', 'out', 'first', 'name', 'parts', 'thier', 'chests', 'also', 'even', ""n't"", 'play', 'guitar', 'when', 'mike', 'stand', '2', 'songs', 'Also', 'nice', 'see', 'skyline', 'Chicago', 'seen', 'concert', 'buildings', 'are', 'area', 'where', 'concert', 'pefromed', 'together', 'show', '1', 'hour', '45', 'minutes', 'long', 'know', 'lot', 'singers', 'come', 'Chicago', 'concerts', 'outdoors', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'filmed', 'concerts']",N/A
