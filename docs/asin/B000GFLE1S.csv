1002697,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000GFLE1S,A Customer,"[3, 4]","Kinky Boots is supposedly based on a true story, but that doesn't stop it from coming across as absolutely preposterous. Admittedly the film is entertaining, but its also totally predictable and precious, and even a little bit old fashioned. And while it doesn't have the star wattage of Calendar Girls or the originality of The Full Monty, Kinky Boots tries to make up for it by bringing gender-bending Soho to the staid and working class Northampton.In Kinky Boots Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Lola, a flamboyant London transvestite who sings in a cheesy Soho nightclub. She's a big girl, constantly rattling on about sexiness and how her thigh-high red stiletto boots are ""tubular sex."" Life for Lola irrevocably changes when she meets the feckless Charlie (Joel Edgerton) who owns an established footwear company in the north of England.When his father dies, Charlie is dismayed to discover that the business is far from booming. He spends an afternoon firing people until Lauren (Sarah-Jane Potts) a young woman at the factory challenges him to find a better solution. On a trip to London, Charlie encounters the fabulous Lola and through her and her mates he finds a niche market creating sexy boots big enough and tough enough to be worn by cross-dressing adult men.Employing Lola as his design consultant - where against her better judgment she travels to Northampton - the factory has a couple of false starts, but soon it works like a charm and Charlie and his cohorts are off to Milan to model and hopefully sell their new ""kinky boots.""Of course, it's not all-smooth sailing and there's various subplots involving Charlie's narrow-minded and grasping fianc&eacute;, Lola's encounters with the bigoted men at the factory, Lola having to come to terms with her past, and the difficulties of designing a boot that will fit, but the centre of the tale is all about tolerance and working together and all those good things. It's all fairly predictable, but it's pleasant.Directed by Julian Jarrold, the film has a polished and genteel feel to it and he certainly keeps the action moving along nicely - the pacing never lags. The film is reportedly based on a true story. But that doesn't guarantee truthfulness. The facts, whatever they may be, have most likely been beaten into a formulaic, feel-good movie. Right down to its dizzy finale at a Milan fashion show taken over by drag queens, the movie is totally mechanical from the get go.The other main problem is that the talented Ejiofor - who does much of his own singing - isn't that good of a singer, and his drag act come across as a bit cheap and perfunctory. It also doesn't help that he looks rather ugly in a dress. His performance is indeed flamboyant, but only partly convincing because he lacks the vital component - genuine sexual provocation. This drag queen may save the day, but in the end he comes across as a bit of an asexual saint, and that for me is a bit of a cop out.

When a up-and-coming young marketing major, Charlie (played by Joel Edgerton) learns that he has to return and take over the family shoe business, his first reaction is one of feeling trapped, yet again, in his father's dream.  It was a dream he never shared and now it has returned to haunt and confound him.  It turns out that Dad kept a lot of secrets, like the fact that there were no orders coming in. A huge warehouse holds thousands of boxes filled with shoes that had no where to go.  There is no money and no market for the kind of quality shoes his father's factory has made for generations.  Enter the gutsy young factory worker, Lauren (played by Sarah Jane Potts) with an off the cuff remark about &#34;finding your niche market&#34;.  Charlie, desperate for a way to keep the factory going and to create something for himself, recalls a chance meeting with a drag queen in a London alley. (It is not what you think.) The entertainer, Lola, is played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, who wraps himself in the role even as he drapes himself in satins and laces for a on-key solo act.  Boy meets drag queen evolves into boy enlists drag queen to help build a niche market for the factory by making outrageous and man-strong stilettos and high-heeled boots - &#34;The sex is in the heel,&#34; says Lola.  Bumps and grinds create obstacles, but as the boots are built, one stitch at a time, each character grows in synch.

And between the two of them they start to design (Lola) and build (Charlie) a whole new line of...well, kinky boots, long leather strutters that go up almost to the armpit, straight-sewn flashy gadabouts with stilettos as heels that would have all those Judy Garland, Marlene Dietrich and Barbara Streisand impersonators gnashing their teeth to wear. Just zipping these things up might get you arrested.Because this is a feel-good movie, suitable for middle-aged couples to view holding hands, there are life lessons to be learned about mutual understanding and acceptance. There also are at least three conclusions at the end, the most flagrant taking place at a shoe show in Milan. Charlie had shown nervousness at being with Lola at a sedate restaurant. Lola, hurt, has left the factory and returned to his nightclub, where he wows the clientele with unsubtle versions of Cole Porter's Let's Do It. Charlie, his new girl friend (he and his fiance split) and a steady old hand from the factory, now must display the boots on the runway without Lola and her flash. So Charlie, with a suit on from waist up, dons those kinky boots and only manages to fall on his face in front of everyone. But wait...what's that music? It's Lola in full drag, wearing a pair of boots which defy description, backed up by his singing and dancing drag queens from his night club, all prancing and dancing down the runaway. The boots are a hit in Milan! We know the orders will start pouring in. Lola gives up his singing and dancing, but not, we think, his cross dressing, to design more boots. Charlie's factory is saved; the employees keep their jobs. Charlie has learned understanding and acceptance. And Lola is learning to accept who he is. Charlie's marriage to his girl friend can only be months away.If you like this sort of thing, you may find it bearable. The director gave us Calendar Girls not too long ago, another feel-good movie. Calendar Girls' obviousness was redeemed by two great performances from Helen Mirren and Julie Walters. With Kinky Boots, we have an attractive, puzzled performance from Edgerton. But we also have a tour de force from Ejiofor. In full drag, backed by singers and dancers, he gives at least four numbers at the nightclub singing, strutting and challenging anybody who doesn't like his style. Yes, Lola is misunderstood and, yes, Lola had an unhappy childhood. Ejiofor carries off the role with complete confidence. He's edgy but sympathetic. He never winks at the us. If you saw him in Dirty Pretty Things or Inside Man, you're in for an acting revelation. On balance, I think the movie is too predictable and manipulative as it tries to pull our emotional strings. Still, it may be worth seeing just to experience Ejiofor's versatility. And I'm told his name is pronounced Chew-i-tell Edge-o-for.",3,"Entertaining but predictable, with a great performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor",1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,3638,"['Charlie', 'Price', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'problem', 'Dad', 'died', 'leaving', 'quality', 'shoemaking', 'business', 'Northhampton', 'slowly', 'surely', 'going', 'men', 'shoes', 'made', 'care', 'dedicated', 'employees', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'market', 'anymore', 'face', 'imported', 'cheaper', 'goods', 'Charlie', 'good-hearted', 'fellow', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'fiancee', 'who', 'bit', 'money-loving', 'property', 'developer', 'London', 'who', 'sell', 'factory', 'employees', 'need', 'jobs', 'let', 'down', 'let', 'go', 'What', 'should', 'do', 'being', 'feel-good', 'titillating', 'rainbow-at-the-end-of-the-movie', 'kind', 'movie', 'why', 'Charlie', 'Lola', 'big', 'black', 'cross-dressing', 'song-and-dance', 'man', 'played', 'great', 'style', 'verve', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'two', 'start', 'design', 'Lola', 'Charlie', 'whole', 'new', 'line', 'well', 'kinky', 'boots', 'long', 'leather', 'strutters', 'go', 'up', 'almost', 'armpit', 'straight-sewn', 'flashy', 'gadabouts', 'stilettos', 'heels', 'would', 'have', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'Barbara', 'Streisand', 'impersonators', 'gnashing', 'teeth', 'wear', 'Just', 'zipping', 'things', 'up', 'might', 'get', 'arrested.Because', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'suitable', 'middle-aged', 'couples', 'view', 'holding', 'hands', 'are', 'life', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'mutual', 'understanding', 'acceptance', 'also', 'are', 'least', 'three', 'conclusions', 'end', 'most', 'flagrant', 'taking', 'place', 'shoe', 'show', 'Milan', 'Charlie', 'had', 'shown', 'nervousness', 'being', 'Lola', 'sedate', 'restaurant', 'Lola', 'hurt', 'left', 'factory', 'returned', 'nightclub', 'where', 'clientele', 'unsubtle', 'versions', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'Let', 'Do', 'Charlie', 'new', 'girl', 'friend', 'fiance', 'split', 'steady', 'old', 'hand', 'factory', 'now', 'must', 'display', 'boots', 'runway', 'Lola', 'flash', 'So', 'Charlie', 'suit', 'waist', 'up', 'dons', 'kinky', 'boots', 'only', 'fall', 'face', 'front', 'everyone', 'wait', 'what', 'music', 'Lola', 'full', 'drag', 'wearing', 'pair', 'boots', 'defy', 'description', 'backed', 'up', 'singing', 'dancing', 'drag', 'queens', 'night', 'club', 'prancing', 'dancing', 'down', 'runaway', 'boots', 'are', 'hit', 'Milan', 'know', 'orders', 'will', 'start', 'pouring', 'Lola', 'up', 'singing', 'dancing', 'not', 'think', 'cross', 'dressing', 'design', 'more', 'boots', 'Charlie', 'factory', 'saved', 'employees', 'keep', 'jobs', 'Charlie', 'learned', 'understanding', 'acceptance', 'Lola', 'learning', 'accept', 'who', 'Charlie', 'marriage', 'girl', 'friend', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'months', 'sort', 'thing', 'may', 'find', 'bearable', 'director', 'gave', 'Calendar', 'Girls', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'Calendar', 'Girls', 'obviousness', 'was', 'redeemed', 'two', 'great', 'performances', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'Kinky', 'Boots', 'have', 'attractive', 'puzzled', 'performance', 'Edgerton', 'also', 'have', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'Ejiofor', 'full', 'drag', 'backed', 'singers', 'dancers', 'least', 'four', 'numbers', 'nightclub', 'singing', 'strutting', 'challenging', 'anybody', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'style', 'Yes', 'Lola', 'misunderstood', 'yes', 'Lola', 'had', 'unhappy', 'childhood', 'Ejiofor', 'role', 'complete', 'confidence', 'edgy', 'sympathetic', 'never', 'saw', 'Dirty', 'Pretty', 'Things', 'Inside', 'Man', ""'re"", 'acting', 'revelation', 'balance', 'think', 'movie', 'too', 'predictable', 'manipulative', 'pull', 'emotional', 'strings', 'Still', 'may', 'be', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'experience', 'Ejiofor', 'versatility', ""'m"", 'told', 'name', 'pronounced', 'Chew-i-tell', 'Edge-o-for']",N/A

1002731,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000GFLE1S,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 9]","Despite the titillating title, this 2006 only-in-England comedy is quite lackluster and drags (pardon the pun) quite a bit for the first third of its seemingly lengthy 107-minute running time. Directing his first feature film, Julian Jarrold certainly captures the economic woes of Northampton, an industrial town in the Midlands, but he lacks the nimble finesse to make the farcical elements of this true-life story work within that context. The movie wants to be a hybrid ofThe Full Monty,The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desertand yet another variation onRocky, but frankly lacks the depth of any of them.Co-written by Geoff Deane and Tim Firth, the story focuses on Charlie Price, who inherits his family's shoe factory when his father dies. Bound for London and soon to be wed, Charlie seems ill-equipped to run it, especially as dwindling sales and mounting inventory force him to make layoffs. While in London, he saves a drag queen named Lola from some gay-bashers. Lola's inability to save her heel sparks an idea, spurred on by a pert, resourceful worker named Lauren, to have the factory manufacture thigh-high stiletto-heeled boots for transvestites and S&M; lovers, apparently enough of a market to keep the company afloat. Designed by the multi-talented Lola, the boots are flashy, Ziggy Stardust-style concoctions with a convenient sheath to hold a disciplinary riding crop. The film's climax takes place during Milan Fashion Week where Charlie gets to expose his new line to potential buyers and the fashion media.Looking like a cross between Albert Finney circaTwo for the Roadand Conan O'Brien, Australian actor Joel Edgerton is rather tepid as Charlie, barely sustaining interest in a character that goes through a number of lightning-quick transformations through the film. The versatile Chiwetel Ejiofor (Inside Man,Melinda and Melinda) plays Lola with a hearty abandon and provides most of the film's energy, though the character's backstory seems unnecessarily clich&eacute;d. Moreover, he doesn't seem to regale in his variety performances enough to warrant being a paid stage entertainer. Sarah-Jane Potts has that early Kate Beckinsale winsomeness going for her as Lauren, but pouty-lipped Jemima Rooper gets more scenery to chew as Charlie's errant wife Nicola.The movie feels dormant for about forty minutes, at which point the factory workers start producing the boots and the action accelerates accordingly. A late plot turn involving Charlie's ignorance of Lola's reasons behind his cross-dressing seems contrived, though it was obviously designed for the flashy finish and big life lessons.

In a similar situation, where blue collar workers are confronted with a transvestite in their midst, there would be a lot of ugliness and violence. Not the case here. And, as the plot progresses and everyone realizes the score, they all pull together.I was taken aback to see Chiwetel Ejiofor playing the transvestite. I simply couldn't see him pulling it off.

Joel Edgerton was a bit restrained for my taste but it DID make his transformation at the end all the more notable.There is really nothing new about the formula here.

Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","It seems that British cinema has fallen into a rut, at least where comedy is concerned: like numerous other films of the past decade, KINKY BOOTS combines a touch of mischief, a touch of sex, a lot of ""lets feel good,"" and a ""let's root for the underdog"" plot.  But although the formula has become as pedestrian and predictable as last year's high heels, KINKY BOOTS still shines in terms of performances, with Chiwetel Ejiofor leading the cast as a professional drag queen in search of footwear that won't break down in the middle of a nightclub act.Very, very, very loosely suggested by an English shoe factory that faced similar marketing woes and took a similar route, KINKY BOOTS is the tale of Charlie Price (Joel Edgerton), who unwillingly inherits a shoe factory and then discovers that it is on the verge of bankruptcy.  A trip to London leads him to a chance encounter with drag queen Lola (Ejiofor), who has no end of problem with footwear--an encounter that inspires Price to go into the niche market of women's style footwear for men.  Charlie and Lola join forces to design the new line, but needless to say things don't go as smoothly as they wish.  Charlie's bride-to-be opposes the whole thing; the factory workers aren't wild about having a drag queen in their midst; and both Charlie and Lola have personal issues to work through in the process.Although the concept is clever, the script is not: you can easily see around each and every bend and forecast every plot turn long before it arrives on the screen.  But the performances make the thing work.  As previously mentioned, the big noise here is Chiwetel Ejiofor, best known for such films as PRETTY DIRTY THINGS and AMERICAN GANGSTER, who puts over Lola in a major way: from stage act to factory floor, he is entirely believeable, extremely sympathetic, and often downright hilarious.  Edgerton is equally well cast as the conflicted factory owner, and the cast is well-rounded out by such memorable supporting players as Sarah Jane Potts, Jemima Rooper, and Stephen Marcus, to name but a few.When all is said and done, KINKY BOOTS is a charming film that is a shade too formula for its own good--but even so it is worth a look.  The DVD package includes two brief features, one on the factory that inspired the story and a standard ""making of;"" there is also a director and cast commentary.

1002743,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000GFLE1S,Grady Harp,"[2, 4]","KINKY BOOTS has a lot of positive things going for it- a cast that is committed, a pace that is fluid, the presence of some fun song and dance sequences, and a lot of sight gags and moments of introspection and awakening.  The problem is that, for all the sweet ideas the film explores, the story has been repeatedly done: small town folk facing job loss and identity crises turn things 'round to have a jolly ending (Calendar Girls, Billy Elliot, Waking Ned Devine, The Full Monty, etc).  But this film works on many levels and is definitely worth an evening's entertainment.Charley Price (Joel Edgerton) has been groomed since childhood to take over the Price Shoe Factory in Northampton yet when he finishes schooling he is off to London to lead his own life when suddenly his father dies and the shoe factory is doomed unless he returns.  Finding the production of men's brogues in disarray (he is on the dangerous edge of bankruptcy) he begins letting the long-term employees go until one of the spunkier ones Lauren (Sarah-Jane Potts) reprimands him into thinking about finding new avenues for the factory's future.  A tip to London and to a nightclub with Drag Queens sparks the idea of creating high heeled boots that can support a man's weight: the new market will be drag queens.  One star drag queen is Lola/Simon (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is brought to the factory, startles the workers with her style, but comes up with a design for kinky boots that eventually the factory successfully makes and enters into the fashion line at Milan: the factory - and the people who work there - is saved and minds are broadened and changed.The story is at its best when it involves the numerous drag numbers by Chiwetel Ejiofor who is clearly the star of this film.  He is a compassionate person, plays his role with fire and spice and vulnerability and steels every scene he is in.  The remainder of the cast (including the very reliable Linda Bassett - Oscar and Lucinda, The Hours, Calendar Girls, Separate Lies, etc - , Nick Frost, Stephen Marcus, and others) is superb.  So for a storyline idea a bit stale (even though it is based on a true tale), the movie works: it is an ensemble creation.

Lane ""professional audience member""","[0, 0]","Ya know those fun old movies where the underdog, after much heartache and travail, manages to come from behind and ""win the big one""? Well, this is actually a movie like that... It is based on a real story and it is shot in a real shoe factory, using some of the real craftsmen (and women) who really work there. It is an upbeat movie that stars actors with whom I am not familiar, so it is easy for me to suspend disbelief and totally buy into this thing.The only actor I recognize is Chjwetel Ejiofor, and I can't even pronounce HIS name! He has been in ""Dirty Pretty Things"" with Audrey Tautou, and ""Red Dust"" with Hillary Swank, but I haven't seen either of those. He is a pretty good singer, and he can look pretty good in drag, too! (The comments on the DVD case call his character a ""sassy, cross-dressing cabaret singer."")The story is about an English shoe factory that is over 100 years old. The owner suddenly dies, so his reluctant son and heir is saddled with it. Not only does he NOT want to be there, but he quickly discovers that the factory is on the brink of disaster, as one of it's major clients has just gone into receivership, leaving a massive inventory of men's oxfords. His father had made him work all aspects of production while he was growing up, so he not only knows the work, but he has laboured side-by- side with the very people he now finds it necessary to lay off. (Did'ja notice the King's English spelling of ""labour?"" ...nudge, nudge, wink, wink...)What with one thing and another, he desperately clutches at a last straw...making footwear for drag queens, who have been forced to purchase women's shoes, which are...too flimsy...too small...not outrageous enough. Therein lies our tale.The sound track is great fun, from Nina Simone, with her unique little tremolo, to a rousing rendition of ""These Boots Were Made For Walkin'"" with Mr. Ejiofor himself doing the honors. It's surprising how many songs there are that have references to shoes, feet and boots!The movie was shot on location in a shoe factory in England, and in Milan, Italy, where the international footwear show is held each year, so you get to travel a little, too.This is no Oscar-winning art piece, it's just a little feel-good flick that makes you smile...I got my DVD from Amazon.com.",5,A Feel-Good Flick Based on Real Life,1383782400,"11 7, 2013",2013,2292,"['Ya', 'know', 'fun', 'old', 'movies', 'where', 'underdog', 'much', 'heartache', 'travail', 'come', 'behind', 'win', 'big', 'one', 'Well', 'actually', 'movie', 'based', 'real', 'story', 'shot', 'real', 'shoe', 'factory', 'using', 'real', 'craftsmen', 'women', 'who', 'really', 'work', 'there', 'upbeat', 'movie', 'actors', 'whom', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'easy', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'totally', 'buy', 'thing.The', 'only', 'actor', 'recognize', 'Chjwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'pronounce', 'HIS', 'name', 'been', 'Dirty', 'Pretty', 'Things', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'Red', 'Dust', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'pretty', 'good', 'singer', 'can', 'look', 'pretty', 'good', 'drag', 'too', 'comments', 'DVD', 'case', 'call', 'character', 'sassy', 'cross-dressing', 'cabaret', 'singer', 'story', 'English', 'shoe', 'factory', '100', 'years', 'old', 'owner', 'suddenly', 'reluctant', 'son', 'heir', 'saddled', 'Not', 'only', 'NOT', 'want', 'be', 'there', 'quickly', 'factory', 'brink', 'disaster', 'one', 'major', 'clients', 'just', 'gone', 'receivership', 'leaving', 'massive', 'inventory', 'men', 'oxfords', 'father', 'had', 'made', 'work', 'aspects', 'production', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'so', 'not', 'only', 'work', 'laboured', 'side-by-', 'side', 'very', 'people', 'now', 'necessary', 'lay', 'off', ""Did'ja"", 'notice', 'King', 'English', 'spelling', 'labour', 'nudge', 'nudge', 'wink', 'wink', 'What', 'one', 'thing', 'desperately', 'last', 'straw', 'making', 'footwear', 'drag', 'queens', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'forced', 'purchase', 'women', 'shoes', 'are', 'too', 'flimsy', 'too', 'small', 'not', 'outrageous', 'enough', 'Therein', 'tale.The', 'sound', 'track', 'great', 'fun', 'Nina', 'Simone', 'unique', 'little', 'tremolo', 'rousing', 'rendition', 'Boots', 'Were', 'Made', 'Walkin', 'Mr.', 'Ejiofor', 'doing', 'honors', 'surprising', 'how', 'many', 'songs', 'are', 'have', 'references', 'shoes', 'feet', 'boots', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'shoe', 'factory', 'England', 'Milan', 'Italy', 'where', 'international', 'footwear', 'show', 'held', 'year', 'get', 'travel', 'little', 'Oscar-winning', 'art', 'piece', 'just', 'little', 'feel-good', 'flick', 'smile', 'got', 'DVD', 'Amazon.com']",N/A

1002754,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000GFLE1S,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Note: With the smash Tony-winning musical adaptation of Kinky Boots having kicked up renewed interest in the 2005 film, it seems an ideal time to rediscover this likable little non-musical film.The British seem to have the market cornered on a particular type of ""feel good"" film. In these movies, a down-on-his-luck protagonist or group must face the inevitability of their current lifestyle predicament and do something completely unorthodox in order to survive. There is a certain wackiness, however, with what they choose. It's by embracing this unknown and unpredictable new world that our heroes will find redemption, success, and learn to live again. From stripping steelworkers, to gardening prisoners, to calendar posing matrons, to marijuana growing widows, to a coal mining brass band--these films share a formula that rarely varies, but usually succeeds on charm if not originality. The other thing these films have in common is that they are ""inspired"" by true stories. (And let's make the distinction, they aren't ""based"" on real life. The films are not factual, they take an idea from the real world and transform it into a very fictional format!) ""Kinky Boots"" fits comfortably into this sub-genre of British comedy.Inspired by a real event, ""Kinky Boots"" tells the story of Charlie Price. Having grown up in the luxury men's shoe business, he is drawn back into the factory when his father passes away. Never particularly passionate about working for the family company, he is now in charge of everything. But everything isn't much! He discovers that the business is failing, the accounts have dried up, and that his father has kept the crew going fulfilling orders that don't exist. After all but giving up, he is inspired by a lovely young worker (of course!) that apathy isn't an answer--he must find a new niche market. A random encounter with a drag queen, thus, sets a new course in motion. Outrageous Lola, the cabaret performer in question, storms the factory and all must deal with prejudice, change, and teamwork. Can they pull together and assemble a new line of sexy female shoes for men? You'll just have to check it out to see.Playing Lola, Chiwetel Ejiofor received many accolades for his ""against-type"" performance. Again proving a dynamic versatility, Ejiofor is fast becoming one of our more interesting and unexpected actors. He invests Lola with a strength of character, a dignity, and a sassiness you would expect, but more fascinating is the layer of doubt underneath. No less important, and less often talked about, is Joel Edgerton as Charlie. As the film's lead, we are really following his journey here and Edgerton is a compelling and likable protagonist. If we aren't rooting for Charlie (despite Ejiofor's more colorful character) then ""Kinky Boots"" would fail. But, luckily, I did root for him.Of course, there was never much doubt in my mind what would transpire. ""Kinky Boots"" moves forward with such predictability, you've seen it all before. However, even lacking a certain originality, there is an undeniable charm that the performers bring to the piece which make it worth a look. In fact, I'm confident that this tale will win over all but the most cynical of viewers--such is the nature of ""feel good"" cinema. About 3 1/2 stars, I'm rounding up because I liked the film despite myself.

But fate had other plans for Charlie when his father dies and he finds himself in an office overlooking the factory floor, accessible only through a rickety trap door.  It goes from bad to worse when Charlie discovers that the business has been failing for some time and his father was simply covering that up.He swallows hard and begins to inform members of the staff that they have become redundant (that's the polite British way of saying ""you're canned, laid off, surplused!"").  Most take the news with sullen acceptance, however one young lady challenges him with the admonition to ""just do something different!""  Easier said than done, but it's a line that languishes in Charlie's brain as he struggles to sell Price's line of high quality men's shoes against cheaper imports.An encounter with Lola (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor) nurtures an idea.  Lola (or Simon as the case may be) it seems is constantly beset with poor quality footwear that is incapable of supporting his/her body mass atop a sexy stiletto heel without breaking.  Arriving back at the factory, Charlie has an idea and returns to London to recruit Lola/Simon as the designer for a line of shoes to be sold to drag queens.  The change in direction is met with bemused skepticism by most of the factory force, while outright hostility from some of the more traditional males is directed at Lola.The whole effort hinges on the success of the new line at the Milan Footwear Shoe, and the road to that debut is littered with events both comedic and poignant.Ejiofor gives depth to his portrayal of the gender-conflicted Lola/Simon and the rest of the cast (with not a single other face or name I recognized) is marvelous.  Kinky Boots is all about understanding, tolerance and the challenge of the global economy.  Supposedly it's based on a true story, but that really has little to do with the reasons for getting this movie.

His son, upon taking over the reigns, soon realises that the business is facing imminent bankruptcy. His search for new ideas for the business leads him to London and to Lola, a sassy drag queen who thinks that maybe the stuffy old business needs to embrace a new market. Thus, the kinky boots of the title which is just one of the new lines of footwear for drag queens, transvestites and such types, who after all, are a niche market not too many footwear makers are tapping into. It's all a true story, apparently.So is it any good?Well, Chiwetel Ejiofor just nabbed a Golden Globe nomination for his role as Lola. To be honest I only got the DVD for the chance to see my man Chewy in drag. He wears it well, considering his very manly build - imagine a unflattering caricature of Mica Paris (and I'm not sure if that's a compliment to Ejiofor or an insult to Paris, but whatever) - and though he doesn't get top billing, his performance essentially drives the movie. I've said it once and I'll say it again, I have nothing but absolute admiration for any man, especially a black man, who is not afraid to take this kind of real risk in the pursuit of his art. Many wouldn't touch this kind of role with a bargepole.Yes, yes, yes. Enough about Chewy. Is the MOVIE any good?Well, ""The Observer"" called it ""Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert Meets The Full Monty"" but I think they were being generous. It lacks the humour of the former and the heart of the latter but all the same, it is definitely a heart-warming feel-good movie. It's really interesting to see how Lola faces down the usual prejudices and stereotypes, how he relationship between her and Charlie Price (the young owner of the shoe business, played by Joel Edgerton) develops and no, the relationship does not go the way you're thinking. It's basically one of those 'against all odds' stories about ordinary, working class, down-to-earth English folk. It's from the creators of ""Calendar Girls"", so that should tell you something. I won't spoil it for you by giving details but it does have a happy ending.What about DVD extras?Umm, the usual stuff: Audio commentary by the director and cast; a short video called ""Journey Of A Brogue"" (the title speaks for itself); ""The Real Kinky Boots Factory"", a short documentary which tells the story of the real-life shoe factory in Northampton that inspired the movie and then there are some deleted scenes.I'll definitely be watching it again and, as a mad Chiwetel Ejiofor fan, I just had to have this in my collection.

I was made aware of it from its Golden Globe nom (for the amazing Chiwetel Ejiofor) in 2007. I've since become a huge fan of Mr Ejiofor. Based on a true story, it's a fun romp about surpassing insurmountable odds, well written and directed, and Ejiofor is on hand to provide a spot-on interpretation. The main character is played by Joel Edgerton, who is excellent as well, but it's Ejiofor, as Lola, who is the true protagonist and inspiration. His complete and flashy performance commands the most attention (how could a milquetoast compare to a drag queen?; who remembers de Niro in ""Flawless"" opposite P S Hoffman?) The ending is worthy of cheers, very satisfying; overall a great feel-good film. One thing that impressed me was that, aside from masculinity issues, no reference was made regarding Lola's sexual preference, which I thought was refreshing. It's a fine line which was never crossed. Kudos to all involved. Also, a fine supporting performance from Linda Bassett, who played Gertrude Stein in ""Waiting for the Moon"".4-29-14 Update: I'm not alone, apparently, since it's now a hit on Broadway.

And Ejofor is surprisingly amazing as a drag queen - he doesn't try too hard to be girlie. He has just enough sultriness in his portrayal to pull it off and remind folks that there's no hiding the fact that he's a man in a dress.It's a little sad that the reviews for this movie were rather mixed and thus it didn't quite get the love it deserved - at least from my perspective. Sure, it's not exactly a laugh riot, but a lot of British comedies have this sort of subdued tone as well. But the Edgerton certainly did his best to portray the well-meaning but somewhat weak-willed Charlie who only really wanted to do the right thing.The movie does have a bit of a slow start as we spend more time following Charlie around throughout things. The movie really gets into gear once Lola becomes more involved in the manufacturing process given drag queens are just fabulous that way.

His eyebrow-less fiance Nicola would rather he sold the building and move on. But Charlie doesn't want the factory to fold under his watch.When Charlie travels to London, he comes across a lady being mugged, only to find that he's no lady, but rather a drag queen named Lola, who has a bugger of a time finding stiletto's that fit a man's foot just right.

Lola travels to Northampton to oversee design of the shoes that the factory will produce for the upcoming Milan show.

1002789,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000GFLE1S,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","It is true that `Kinky Boots' re-uses a sure-fire formula that can be seen in a series of recent successful British comedies such as `The Full Monty.' In `The Full Monty' you saw five unemployed guys dancing naked on stage (in Sheffield); In `Kinky Boots' you see a young owner of a failing shoe making factory (in Northampton) who designs new boots for drag queens for the fashion show in Milan. In both films, characters find new meaning of life in the most unexpected way.That said, `Kinky Boots' has one good thing, and that is the spirited acting from Chiwetel Ejiofor as `Lola,' a drag queen from London who is asked to give some precious advice about making `kinky' boots for the shoe factory owner Charlie (Joel Edgerton). Charlie needs to create a niche market for his failing company. The plot is not implausible, and it is in fact inspired by the true events.Lola's clever advice actually extends to the dull lifestyle of Charlie and the factory's workers, who at first stare him incredulously. Chiwetel Ejiofor presents a credible portrait of Lola, tough and sensitive at the same time, survivor of the society that is not always kind to him. Lola's first advice is about the big difference between pure red and burgundy red, one of the most hilarious parts of the film.Unfortunately, other characters including Charlie need more improvement. I know Australian Joel Edgerton is a talented actor, but the portrait of Charlie is a bit dull with uninteresting sub-plot about his love, and there is not enough room for the supporting characters played by capable Linda Bassett and Sarah-Jane Potts.`Kinky Boots' lacks subtlety when it depicts the character development, and its satire about the ideas of sexuality does not bite.

Charlie Price (Joel Edgerton) must take over the family shoe business when his father dies. He discovers that the company is failing badly. He finds salvation of sorts when he meets drag queen and cabaret singer Lola (Chiwetel Ejiofor from ""Serenity"" proving his versatility in this role). Lola complains about how the footwear she wears is so poorly designed. Lauren (Sarah-Jane Potts) a former employee has a brainstorm--goes into men's fetish footwear. In other words, women's shoes that men (whether they be drag queens or not) can wear. Suddenly Charles has a niche market to work with and success comes unexpectedly comes knocking at his door. Unfortunately Charles must deal with his fianc&eacute;'s (Jemima Rooper) disapproving attitude and the prejudice of his own employees before success can be fully his.An amusing and poignant film that has just the right mix of drama in it, ""Kinky Boots"" was inspired by a true story. The performances are uniformly excellent throughout with a star making turn from actor Chiwetel Ejiofor as the transvestite Lola. He's not exactly a beautiful transvestite but quite convincing in the role.With a transfer that has the sheen and texture of leather ""Kinky Boots"" looks quite good with minimal digital artifacts. Although some of the darker scenes don't have quite as much detail as they should the overall look of the film in this transfer is quite good with accurate color, skin tones and detail. The 5.1 mix sounds good but most of the action and dialogue (not surprisingly) occurs in the center speaker and two front ones.We get an observant and fact filled commentary track from director Julian Jarrold, stars Chiwetel Ejiofor, Joel Edgerton and Sarah-Jane Potts. Their commentary track was done all at the same time so there's a nice dynamic between the actors and director that keeps the commentary moving along. Although it does occasionally focus on the obvious (nice performance here, etc.) there are nice tidbits of trivia about the production of the film.""The Real Kinky Boots Factory"" featurette focuses on the inspiration for the film in the UK. Producer Nick Barton discusses how they saw a documentary on a family business that was struggling against inexpensive imports and how they found their niche with the cross dressing market. Steve Pateman the current factory owner provides the background on the story and we see quite a bit of their actual product as well as hearing from the actors about how their research influenced the fictional story on screen.""The Journey of a Brogue"" provides a visual montage of the production of the shoes. It's brief but an interesting glimpse into the detail. A pity that it's not longer with comments from actual shoe producers as there is a great story behind the production of shoes and the struggle against inexpensive imports that some manufacturers have waged.We also get four deleted scenes with commentary by director Jarrold. The deleted scenes are primarily character bits where for example Lola bonds with the women and men who work on the shoe production or Charlie reminisces with Lauren and discusses the changes to the factory production. Jarrold points out that while the scenes are quite good they effected the pacing of the film and were cut for that reason. ""The Prettiest Star"" features Lola remembering his childhood and obsession with women's footwear walking along the pier to Bowie's ""The Prettiest Star"".An amusing character comedy ""Kinky Boots"" features stellar performances from a strong cast.

He meets a saucy drag queen and gets the idea to make hot high heels that will support the weight of a man, a heretofore unexplored niche. The two must team up and... You see where this going.The only reason why this movie hasn't played over and over again on TV is because of its title and the presence of said drag queen.So what if this was based on a true story? Reality can be just as predictable. Don't get me wrong. The filming, acting, music, all that--it was good. But the story is so utterly predictable that I couldn't bring myself to finish it. But that's the point, isn't it? I didn't have to.If you like ""power movies"" where the protagonist has his work cut out for him, formulaic plots, and inevitable triumphs with cheesy dialogue interspersed throughout: go for it. This movie is definitely a harmless feel-good flick.But if you're tired of the same cinematic gruel over and over, do yourself a favor and go see something with substance, maybe something made in the '40s. If this sounds like a lecture, it is. Kinky Boots is about an hour and a half of my life I'll never get back. At least the couple of minutes I'm using to write this will, I hope, save someone else the trouble.Also: was surprised by how corny some of the dialogue was. This is an English movie. What happened?Special appearances from Queenie fromLark Rise to Candleford: The Complete Season Oneand the cool sidekick fromHot Fuzz (Widescreen Edition).Finally: if you're a shoe fetishist, you're in for a treat. Lola's liquorice-red boots are to die for.
